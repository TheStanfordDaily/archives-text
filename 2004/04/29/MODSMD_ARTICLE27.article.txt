Senior Lauren Barnikow (31-4) has
gone undefeated in singles dual match play
two years in a row and has not dropped a
match since January.
For the last three years. Barnikow has
been named to the ITA Ail-American dou
bles team, an elite honor granted for being
high-seeded or reaching the Round of 16 in
NCAA Championship competition.
For the last two years, the Cardinal's No.
4 singles player has also made the ITA All-
American singles team.
And, let's be honest, how many of us
skipped high-school P.E. to play interna
tional-caliber tennis in Brazil?
Based on Barnikow's seasoned host of
achievements alone, it's no surprise that
such a confident and collected player comes
along only once in a very rare while. Un
derlying her uncommon success story, how
ever, is a kid-tested, mother-approved
moral that endears us all, even if the rest of
us had to endure the likes of beginning bas
ketball and phys. ed.
As Barnikow finishes her fourth and
final year on the top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team, she can fondly recall
the days when her youthful competitors
were less than kind to her at "Hot Shots"
tennis club near her hometown of Wood
bridge, N.J.
"I remember getting beaten really badly

in the first tournaments I played when I was
12 or 13," Barnikow said. "That's when I
began to get really motivated to improve
myself and win."
Barnikow added with a grin, "My moth
er and I still mention those girls from [Hot
Shots], She used to tell me. They're just
jealous because they can t«ll you're good
and they see you working really hard to
beat them.'"
Without a doubt, home is where the
heart is for Barnikow, who is currently
ranked 50th in the nation. From the earliest
days in her career, her parents came out in
full support, making countless drives
statewide to find coaching on limited in
door court time.
"Tennis was always fun for me and my
parents didn't place a lot of pressure tin
me." Barnikow said. "They just told me two
things: Have a good attitude and always
hustle."
A turning point in Barnikow's career
came after she clinched her first national
title at the USTA Girls' 16 National Cham
pionship in 1997. Ending the juniors season
ranked No. 5, Barnikow had begun Hying to
Atlanta. Ga., for more serious coaching —
not to mention joining the national team,
which travels worldwide for competition.
Barnikow rounded out her run in the ju
nior circuit with a No. 2 ranking in the
Girls' 18 division. In their continued sup-


Senior Lauren Barnikow has dominated this year, compiling a record of 31 -4, and she
will shoot for an individual win at NCAA Championships.
