# Stanford to host track and field meet
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tomorrow, some of the
top athletes in the United
and from around the world
States converge on the Farm
to participate in the Cardinal
Invitiational.
Even though several na
tional records have been set
at the meet over the last cou
ple years, this year's focus is
solely on the Olympics.
The races from 1,500 to
10,(XX) meters arc all set up
to take the fields under the

Olympic A standards, hut
that won't make things any
less exciting. Several colle
giate and Stanford records
are at stake, as are Olympic
berths, as some of Stan
ford's top distance runners
take the center of the colle
giate stage.
And after completing a
dominating cross country
season that saw the Cardinal
sweep the national team ti
tles and the men win by the
largest margin ever with the
second-lowest score in histo
ry, the athletes are out to

show what they can do.
"Indoors was very disap
pointing for our team," said
redshirt junior lan Dobson.
"Almost no one ran as well
as they can, so starting a few
weeks ago we have been on
kind of a mission to prove to
ourselves that we really arc
asgood as we think we are."
Dobson is entered in the
K).(XK) on Friday, along with
senior Louis Luchini. who
broke the 5,000-meter
school record at the Mt. San
Antonio College Relays.
They will be pushed to

their limits and possibly
under the A standard as they
race against 2(XX) Olympian
and Stanford alum Brad
Mauser,s,ooo-meter Ameri
can record-holder Bob
Kennedy and 10,(XX)-meter
American record-holder
Meb Keflezigh.
"My main goal for the
race is to get the Olympic A
standard (27 minutes, 49 sec
onds)," Dobson said.
"That's pretty fast, but it will
be a good race and I think 1
have a shot at it.
"In any case I will run

that pace as long as I can," he
continued. "1 think I have a
very realistic shot at the
school record, so if I don't
get the A standard, I want to
at least get that mark."
And with both Luchini
and Dobson running, the
l(),(XX) meter school record
of 28:08 set by Hauser in
2(XX) is probably all but guar
anteed to be broken.
"In a sense, the I0.1XX)
this Friday is like the

Olympic trials because it is
the last really high-quality
H).(XX) in the United States
before the trials," Dobson
said. "It is pretty likely that
anyone who has the A stan
dard going into the trials in
July will make the team, re
gardless of how they finish."
To qualify for the
Olympics, runners must first
have either the B or the A
standard. The top three at
the trials who have the A
