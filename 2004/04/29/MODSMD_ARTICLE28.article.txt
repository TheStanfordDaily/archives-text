# Stanford to host track and field meet
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tomorrow, some of the
top athletes in the United
and from around the world
States converge on the Farm
to participate in the Cardinal
Invitiational.
Even though several na
tional records have been set
at the meet over the last cou
ple years, this year's focus is
solely on the Olympics.
The races from 1,500 to
10,(XX) meters arc all set up
to take the fields under the

Olympic A standards, hut
that won't make things any
less exciting. Several colle
giate and Stanford records
are at stake, as are Olympic
berths, as some of Stan
ford's top distance runners
take the center of the colle
giate stage.
And after completing a
dominating cross country
season that saw the Cardinal
sweep the national team ti
tles and the men win by the
largest margin ever with the
second-lowest score in histo
ry, the athletes are out to

show what they can do.
"Indoors was very disap
pointing for our team," said
redshirt junior lan Dobson.
"Almost no one ran as well
as they can, so starting a few
weeks ago we have been on
kind of a mission to prove to
ourselves that we really arc
asgood as we think we are."
Dobson is entered in the
K).(XK) on Friday, along with
senior Louis Luchini. who
broke the 5,000-meter
school record at the Mt. San
Antonio College Relays.
They will be pushed to

their limits and possibly
under the A standard as they
race against 2(XX) Olympian
and Stanford alum Brad
Mauser,s,ooo-meter Ameri
can record-holder Bob
Kennedy and 10,(XX)-meter
American record-holder
Meb Keflezigh.
"My main goal for the
race is to get the Olympic A
standard (27 minutes, 49 sec
onds)," Dobson said.
"That's pretty fast, but it will
be a good race and I think 1
have a shot at it.
"In any case I will run

that pace as long as I can," he
continued. "1 think I have a
very realistic shot at the
school record, so if I don't
get the A standard, I want to
at least get that mark."
And with both Luchini
and Dobson running, the
l(),(XX) meter school record
of 28:08 set by Hauser in
2(XX) is probably all but guar
anteed to be broken.
"In a sense, the I0.1XX)
this Friday is like the

Olympic trials because it is
the last really high-quality
H).(XX) in the United States
before the trials," Dobson
said. "It is pretty likely that
anyone who has the A stan
dard going into the trials in
July will make the team, re
gardless of how they finish."
To qualify for the
Olympics, runners must first
have either the B or the A
standard. The top three at
the trials who have the A
qualifying standard are given the spots
on the Olympic team. If only one per
son has the A standard he must win to
get the spot.
It is likely that only two or three
U.S. athletes will hit the A standard
between now and the Olympics be
cause championship races, like the tri
als, are too slow and the trials are too
close to the actual Olympics to chase
the standard afterward.
The women's 10,000 is no less
stacked, with Kenyan Sally Barsosio
leading the way. The U.S. will be
represented by Katie McGreggor,
twins Kate and Laura O'Neill, and
Stanford's Alicia Craig.
With the field targeting the
Olympic A standard of 31:45, Craig,
the reigning NCAA 10,000-meter
champion, may threaten the collegiate
record of 32:17.10 at the distance. Her
school record of 32:40 in the 10,000 will
almost certainly be broken.
The men's 1,500 will be filled with
current and former Cardinal runners
aiming for the Olympic A standard of
3:36.20.
Stanford senior Grant Robison is
currently the only U.S. 1,500 specialist
with the A standard. David Krumme
nacker, who will run the 800 at the
Olympics, also has the standard.
"It's a mixture of feelings to have
the standard," Robison said. "On one
side, it's a relief. It takes a lot of pres
sure off me so I can just race and get
ready for the Olympic trials.
"But it's a double-edged sword,"
he continued. "Getting the standard
has kind of raised expectations of me.
Other people will get the standard. It's
not a free pass for me."
Just like the 10,000 meters, the top
three athletes in the U.S. with the stan
dard will get the spots on the team. But
unlike the 10,000, the United States is
expected to have more than three run
ners hit the A standard in the 1,500.
Robison, the 2003 NCAA 1,500
champion, will be in his first open
1,500 since missing the Indoor Nation
als because of a minor case of plantar
fasciitis in his foot.
"Training's going really well
now," Robison said. "I got the first

race in on it, and it felt good after
wards.
Redshirt junior Don Sage, the 2002
NCAA 1,500 champ, will be in the
race with Robison. Sage will be seek
ing his own A standard mark.
"When Don ran 3:39,1 thought, I
should be able to do that," Robison
said. "And I think I speak for Don
when I say that when I hit 3:35, Don
thought I should be able to do that too.
Don is incredibly talented."
The two current Cardinal run
ners will join Stanford alums
Jonathan Riley, 2000 Olympian
Michael Stember, and 2003 USATF
1,500 meter champion Jason Lunn
in pursuit of the Olympic standard.
"We're not really tapered for this
race, we just run what we can right now
while training hard," Robison said.
"But my goal is to make the Olympic
finals. Everything is focused on that.
There's still some work to do to get
there."
The women's 1,500 will fea
ture American runner Nicole
Teter and former Cardinal Ma
lindi Elmore.
This should be a good rematch of
the 1,500 race at Mt. SAC, wher6 El
more out-kicked Teter to run the sec
ond fastest time in the world this year.
Both women should get near the
Olympic standard of 4:05.80.
Possibly the most exciting event of
the evening will be the women's 5,000
when former Stanford-standout Lau
ren Fleshman will take on Olympian
Elva Dryer and U.S. 5,000 champion
Shayne Culpepper as well as Olympic
silver-medalist Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland.
They will chase the 5,000 standard
of 15:08.70. Currently, no U.S. woman
besides marathoner Dena Drossin has
the mark. Fleshman ran 15:12 last year
at the world championships and is one
of the favorites for the U.S. title this
year.
The men's 5,000 will be headlined
by collegiate star Alistair Cragg of
Arkansas via Ireland who could chase
the collegiate record and will definite
ly challenge for the Olympic standard.
He will be joined by former teammate
and two-time NCAA steeplechase
champion Daniel Lincoln.
Former Colorado runner Steve
Slattery and former Notre Dame
standout Luke Watson will also be in
the race which will almost certainly
crack the 13:21.50 Olympic A stan

dard.
"The meet on Friday is a great time
for some of our athletes to get qualify
ing times here in the United States,"
said men's head coach Robert Weir.
"Even though the Big Meet [the dual
meet between Stanford and Cal] is the
next day, I have to feel that I'm doing
the right thing for the athletes in the
program by running them on Friday."

"The reality of the situation is that
the Olympics are in 2004," he contin
ued. "We have several athletes who
are focused on July."
The meet kicks off at 4:00 with the
B section of the steeplechase. The in
vitational races start at 6:25. Stanford
students enter for free.

ready for the Olympic trials.
"But it's a double-edged sword,"
he continued. "Getting the standard
has kind of raised expectations of me.
Other people will get the standard. It's
not a free pass for me."
Just like the 10,000 meters, the top
three athletes in the U.S. with the stan
dard will get the spots on the team. But
unlike the 10,000, the United States is
expected to have more than three run
ners hit the A standard in the 1,500.
Robison, the 2003 NCAA 1,500
champion, will be in his first open
1,500 since missing the Indoor Nation
als because of a minor case of plantar
fasciitis in his foot.
"Training's going really well
now," Robison said. "I got the first

race in on it, and it felt good after
wards.
Redshirt junior Don Sage, the 2002
NCAA 1,500 champ, will be in the
race with Robison. Sage will be seek
ing his own A standard mark.
"When Don ran 3:39,1 thought, I
should be able to do that," Robison
said. "And I think I speak for Don
when I say that when I hit 3:35, Don
thought I should be able to do that too.
Don is incredibly talented."
The two current Cardinal run
ners will join Stanford alums
Jonathan Riley, 2000 Olympian
Michael Stember, and 2003 USATF
1,500 meter champion Jason Lunn
in pursuit of the Olympic standard.
"We're not really tapered for this
race, we just run what we can right now
while training hard," Robison said.
"But my goal is to make the Olympic
finals. Everything is focused on that.
There's still some work to do to get
there."
The women's 1,500 will fea
ture American runner Nicole
Teter and former Cardinal Ma
lindi Elmore.
This should be a good rematch of
the 1,500 race at Mt. SAC, wher6 El
more out-kicked Teter to run the sec
ond fastest time in the world this year.
Both women should get near the
Olympic standard of 4:05.80.
Possibly the most exciting event of
the evening will be the women's 5,000
when former Stanford-standout Lau
ren Fleshman will take on Olympian
Elva Dryer and U.S. 5,000 champion
Shayne Culpepper as well as Olympic
silver-medalist Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland.
They will chase the 5,000 standard
of 15:08.70. Currently, no U.S. woman
besides marathoner Dena Drossin has
the mark. Fleshman ran 15:12 last year
at the world championships and is one
of the favorites for the U.S. title this
year.
The men's 5,000 will be headlined
by collegiate star Alistair Cragg of
Arkansas via Ireland who could chase
the collegiate record and will definite
ly challenge for the Olympic standard.
He will be joined by former teammate
and two-time NCAA steeplechase
champion Daniel Lincoln.
Former Colorado runner Steve
Slattery and former Notre Dame
standout Luke Watson will also be in
the race which will almost certainly
crack the 13:21.50 Olympic A stan

dard.
"The meet on Friday is a great time
for some of our athletes to get qualify
ing times here in the United States,"
said men's head coach Robert Weir.
"Even though the Big Meet [the dual
meet between Stanford and Cal] is the
next day, I have to feel that I'm doing
the right thing for the athletes in the
program by running them on Friday."

"The reality of the situation is that
the Olympics are in 2004," he contin
ued. "We have several athletes who
are focused on July."
The meet kicks off at 4:00 with the
B section of the steeplechase. The in
vitational races start at 6:25. Stanford
students enter for free.


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily File
The track and field team will shoot for Olympic A standards at the Stanford
Invitational this weekend.
Tomorrow, some of the
top athletes in the United
and from around the world
States converge on the Farm
to participate in the Cardinal
Invitiational.
Even though several na
tional records have been set
at the meet over the last cou
ple years, this year's focus is
solely on the Olympics.
The races from 1,500 to
10,(XX) meters arc all set up
to take the fields under the

Olympic A standards, hut
that won't make things any
less exciting. Several colle
giate and Stanford records
are at stake, as are Olympic
berths, as some of Stan
ford's top distance runners
take the center of the colle
giate stage.
And after completing a
dominating cross country
season that saw the Cardinal
sweep the national team ti
tles and the men win by the
largest margin ever with the
second-lowest score in histo
ry, the athletes are out to

show what they can do.
"Indoors was very disap
pointing for our team," said
redshirt junior lan Dobson.
"Almost no one ran as well
as they can, so starting a few
weeks ago we have been on
kind of a mission to prove to
ourselves that we really arc
asgood as we think we are."
Dobson is entered in the
K).(XK) on Friday, along with
senior Louis Luchini. who
broke the 5,000-meter
school record at the Mt. San
Antonio College Relays.
They will be pushed to

their limits and possibly
under the A standard as they
race against 2(XX) Olympian
and Stanford alum Brad
Mauser,s,ooo-meter Ameri
can record-holder Bob
Kennedy and 10,(XX)-meter
American record-holder
Meb Keflezigh.
"My main goal for the
race is to get the Olympic A
standard (27 minutes, 49 sec
onds)," Dobson said.
"That's pretty fast, but it will
be a good race and I think 1
have a shot at it.
"In any case I will run

that pace as long as I can," he
continued. "1 think I have a
very realistic shot at the
school record, so if I don't
get the A standard, I want to
at least get that mark."
And with both Luchini
and Dobson running, the
l(),(XX) meter school record
of 28:08 set by Hauser in
2(XX) is probably all but guar
anteed to be broken.
"In a sense, the I0.1XX)
this Friday is like the

Olympic trials because it is
the last really high-quality
H).(XX) in the United States
before the trials," Dobson
said. "It is pretty likely that
anyone who has the A stan
dard going into the trials in
July will make the team, re
gardless of how they finish."
To qualify for the
Olympics, runners must first
have either the B or the A
standard. The top three at
the trials who have the A
qualifying standard are given the spots
on the Olympic team. If only one per
son has the A standard he must win to
get the spot.
It is likely that only two or three
U.S. athletes will hit the A standard
between now and the Olympics be
cause championship races, like the tri
als, are too slow and the trials are too
close to the actual Olympics to chase
the standard afterward.
The women's 10,000 is no less
stacked, with Kenyan Sally Barsosio
leading the way. The U.S. will be
represented by Katie McGreggor,
twins Kate and Laura O'Neill, and
Stanford's Alicia Craig.
With the field targeting the
Olympic A standard of 31:45, Craig,
the reigning NCAA 10,000-meter
champion, may threaten the collegiate
record of 32:17.10 at the distance. Her
school record of 32:40 in the 10,000 will
almost certainly be broken.
The men's 1,500 will be filled with
current and former Cardinal runners
aiming for the Olympic A standard of
3:36.20.
Stanford senior Grant Robison is
currently the only U.S. 1,500 specialist
with the A standard. David Krumme
nacker, who will run the 800 at the
Olympics, also has the standard.
"It's a mixture of feelings to have
the standard," Robison said. "On one
side, it's a relief. It takes a lot of pres
sure off me so I can just race and get
ready for the Olympic trials.
"But it's a double-edged sword,"
he continued. "Getting the standard
has kind of raised expectations of me.

solely on the Olympics.
The races from 1,500 to
10,(XX) meters arc all set up
to take the fields under the

Olympic A standards, hut
that won't make things any
less exciting. Several colle
giate and Stanford records
are at stake, as are Olympic
berths, as some of Stan
ford's top distance runners
take the center of the colle
giate stage.
And after completing a
dominating cross country
season that saw the Cardinal
sweep the national team ti
tles and the men win by the
largest margin ever with the
second-lowest score in histo
ry, the athletes are out to

show what they can do.
"Indoors was very disap
pointing for our team," said
redshirt junior lan Dobson.
"Almost no one ran as well
as they can, so starting a few
weeks ago we have been on
kind of a mission to prove to
ourselves that we really arc
asgood as we think we are."
Dobson is entered in the
K).(XK) on Friday, along with
senior Louis Luchini. who
broke the 5,000-meter
school record at the Mt. San
Antonio College Relays.
They will be pushed to

their limits and possibly
under the A standard as they
race against 2(XX) Olympian
and Stanford alum Brad
Mauser,s,ooo-meter Ameri
can record-holder Bob
Kennedy and 10,(XX)-meter
American record-holder
Meb Keflezigh.
"My main goal for the
race is to get the Olympic A
standard (27 minutes, 49 sec
onds)," Dobson said.
"That's pretty fast, but it will
be a good race and I think 1
have a shot at it.
"In any case I will run

that pace as long as I can," he
continued. "1 think I have a
very realistic shot at the
school record, so if I don't
get the A standard, I want to
at least get that mark."
And with both Luchini
and Dobson running, the
l(),(XX) meter school record
of 28:08 set by Hauser in
2(XX) is probably all but guar
anteed to be broken.
"In a sense, the I0.1XX)
this Friday is like the

Olympic trials because it is
the last really high-quality
H).(XX) in the United States
before the trials," Dobson
said. "It is pretty likely that
anyone who has the A stan
dard going into the trials in
July will make the team, re
gardless of how they finish."
To qualify for the
Olympics, runners must first
have either the B or the A
standard. The top three at
the trials who have the A
qualifying standard are given the spots
on the Olympic team. If only one per
son has the A standard he must win to
get the spot.
It is likely that only two or three
U.S. athletes will hit the A standard
between now and the Olympics be
cause championship races, like the tri
als, are too slow and the trials are too
close to the actual Olympics to chase
the standard afterward.
The women's 10,000 is no less
stacked, with Kenyan Sally Barsosio
leading the way. The U.S. will be
represented by Katie McGreggor,
twins Kate and Laura O'Neill, and
Stanford's Alicia Craig.
With the field targeting the
Olympic A standard of 31:45, Craig,
the reigning NCAA 10,000-meter
champion, may threaten the collegiate
record of 32:17.10 at the distance. Her
school record of 32:40 in the 10,000 will
almost certainly be broken.
The men's 1,500 will be filled with
current and former Cardinal runners
aiming for the Olympic A standard of
3:36.20.
Stanford senior Grant Robison is
currently the only U.S. 1,500 specialist
with the A standard. David Krumme
nacker, who will run the 800 at the
Olympics, also has the standard.
"It's a mixture of feelings to have
the standard," Robison said. "On one
side, it's a relief. It takes a lot of pres
sure off me so I can just race and get
ready for the Olympic trials.
"But it's a double-edged sword,"
he continued. "Getting the standard
has kind of raised expectations of me.
Other people will get the standard. It's
not a free pass for me."
Just like the 10,000 meters, the top
three athletes in the U.S. with the stan
dard will get the spots on the team. But
unlike the 10,000, the United States is
expected to have more than three run
ners hit the A standard in the 1,500.
Robison, the 2003 NCAA 1,500
champion, will be in his first open
1,500 since missing the Indoor Nation
als because of a minor case of plantar
fasciitis in his foot.
"Training's going really well
now," Robison said. "I got the first

race in on it, and it felt good after
wards.
Redshirt junior Don Sage, the 2002
NCAA 1,500 champ, will be in the
race with Robison. Sage will be seek
ing his own A standard mark.
"When Don ran 3:39,1 thought, I
should be able to do that," Robison
said. "And I think I speak for Don
when I say that when I hit 3:35, Don
thought I should be able to do that too.
Don is incredibly talented."
The two current Cardinal run
ners will join Stanford alums
Jonathan Riley, 2000 Olympian
Michael Stember, and 2003 USATF
1,500 meter champion Jason Lunn
in pursuit of the Olympic standard.
"We're not really tapered for this
race, we just run what we can right now
while training hard," Robison said.
"But my goal is to make the Olympic
finals. Everything is focused on that.
There's still some work to do to get
there."
The women's 1,500 will fea
ture American runner Nicole
Teter and former Cardinal Ma
lindi Elmore.
This should be a good rematch of
the 1,500 race at Mt. SAC, wher6 El
more out-kicked Teter to run the sec
ond fastest time in the world this year.
Both women should get near the
Olympic standard of 4:05.80.
Possibly the most exciting event of
the evening will be the women's 5,000
when former Stanford-standout Lau
ren Fleshman will take on Olympian
Elva Dryer and U.S. 5,000 champion
Shayne Culpepper as well as Olympic
silver-medalist Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland.
They will chase the 5,000 standard
of 15:08.70. Currently, no U.S. woman
besides marathoner Dena Drossin has
the mark. Fleshman ran 15:12 last year
at the world championships and is one
of the favorites for the U.S. title this
year.
The men's 5,000 will be headlined
by collegiate star Alistair Cragg of
Arkansas via Ireland who could chase
the collegiate record and will definite
ly challenge for the Olympic standard.
He will be joined by former teammate
and two-time NCAA steeplechase
champion Daniel Lincoln.
Former Colorado runner Steve
Slattery and former Notre Dame
standout Luke Watson will also be in
the race which will almost certainly
crack the 13:21.50 Olympic A stan

dard.
"The meet on Friday is a great time
for some of our athletes to get qualify
ing times here in the United States,"
said men's head coach Robert Weir.
"Even though the Big Meet [the dual
meet between Stanford and Cal] is the
next day, I have to feel that I'm doing
the right thing for the athletes in the
program by running them on Friday."

"The reality of the situation is that
the Olympics are in 2004," he contin
ued. "We have several athletes who
are focused on July."
The meet kicks off at 4:00 with the
B section of the steeplechase. The in
vitational races start at 6:25. Stanford
students enter for free.
