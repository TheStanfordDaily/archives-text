# Men's golf last at Pacs
## 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
The men's golf team
wrapped up a sub-par season by
placing 10th yesterday at the Pa
cific-10 Championships at The
Gallery at Dove Mountain in
Tucson, Ariz. It was the first
time the team has ever finished
last in the Pac-10 Champi
onships.
Stanford shot a 1562, over 100
strokes behind first-place Ari
zona. The Cardinal finished the
tournament by shooting a 32-
over-par 392 in the fourth round
after shooting 383 in the first
round, 385 in the second and 402
in the third.
The Wildcats staged a dramat
ic comeback in the fourth and
final round of the tournament yes
terday. They trailed Arizona
State by nine shots going in, but
shot a five-over-par 365 for an
overall score of 1450 — 14 strokes
fewer than Arizona, which shot a
fourth-round 379.
Stanford junior Kevin Blue led

the Cardinal with a 306 (74-74-82-
76), good for 37th in the tourna
ment. Sophomore Kyle Gentry
was second with a 309 (75-74-78-
82). Senior Blake Mastalir fin
ished with a 315 (81-77-79-78),
freshman Brandon Lawson shot a
318 (83-82-84-77) and freshman
Zack Miller finished with a 319
(79-79-79-82) to round out Stan
ford's scoring. Sophomore Scott
Mac Donald — whose score
didn't count, because he finished
sixth in scoring on the team —
shot a 326.
This can be seen as a rebuilding
year for the team, which lost three
of its top four players — Jim Seki,
Ron Won and George Downing
—to graduation last year. Seki
tied for second individually at the
Pac-10 Championships last year,
propelling Stanford to a fourth
place finish.
The good news is that four of
the six players who competed at
Pac-lOs are either sophomores or
freshmen. Mastalir is the team's
only senior.
