# Diamond and Krasner point out Iraq failures
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The Bush Administration did not
have many defenders last night as
Hoover Fellow Larry Diamond and Po
litical Science Prof. Stephen Krasner
both pointed out the numerous failures
of United States policy in Iraq over the
last year.
Diamond, who worked as an advisor
in Iraq for three months earlier this
year, also cited some success in building
governance structures and civil society
in a country that was devoid of the most
basic elements of democracy two years
ago. But while Diamond described cre
ating a bill of rights and a judicial sys
tem, Krasner noted the stark differ
ences between creating a law and actual
ly implementing it.
"Having a law doesn't mean anything
unless there's a coalition to support it,"
Krasner said.
"It's not just good enough to have
women's rights written into the law," he
pointed out as an example. "You have to
have women's groups to support that law."
Diamond was quick to say that he did

not support the war at its inception, and
also that there have never been enough
troops in Iraq. But he said that today
there are opportunities for building at
least the framework for democracy in Iraq.
"I think the administration has not
been honest . . . from the beginning
about the scope of the situation," Dia
mond said.
"Still," he said, "to ask what went
wrong ... is to view it as an autopsy."
He went on to describe a bill of rights,
a parliamentary system with a quota of 25
percent women and a civic-education
campaign that planned on distributing a
million leaflets each week about the
roots of civil society.
"We've invested enormous amounts
of energy, time and resources ... to
foster democratic development," Dia
mond said.
And while he noted that much of his
work was impeded by the security situa
tion, he criticized the media for focusing
on violence and cultural conflict.
"The prosaic story about women's or
ganizations and young people does not
grab headlines," he said. "Much can be
done to help these groups if there is security."

He added. "Groups can't distribute
leaflets, can't organize. . . can't begin to
campaign without an army... if you have
the kind of security environment you
have today."
Krasner was less optimistic, and he
noted the challenges that Iraq faces as a
relatively poor country with oil in what
he characterized as a "bad neighborhood."
Even Diamond, who studies meth
ods of promoting democracy around the
world, noted that the United States is
unlikely to achieve a perfectly stable
Iraq before domestic political support
wanes. Instead, he said, the United
States must focus on the security situa
tion and gaining international coopera
tion fora quick transfer of power and
rapidly forming only the basics of de
mocratic society.
"We're not going to get from Saddam
Hussein to Costa Rica or even India
overnight," he said. "A kind of realistic
goal is Nigeria."
The most heated moment during the
free-ranging discussion came when
Assoc. Prof, of Cultural and Social An
thropology Carol Delaney asked why the
United States had failed to consult citi-

Zens such as herself who knew the work
ings of Iraqi society.
She garnered loud applause as
she asked, "What is this business
about democracy in Iraq when the
problem is Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
our allies?"
Diamond boiled at her assertion
that she knew there were no weapons
of mass destruction in Iraq and no ties
to terrorism.
"How could you have known?" Di
amond asked. "It is no less arrogant
to say that there were no weapons of
mass destruction in Iraq than to say
that there were. There was no way
to know."
He went on to relate his experience
meeting survivors of the past regime,
and explained how that colored
his perspective.
"1 met too many mothers and sisters
who lost husbands and sons to Saddam
Hussein," he said. "This was a really,
really evil regime. It was probably re
sponsible for the deaths of five hun
dred thousand to a million Iraqis."
His response was followed by a more
muted applause.
