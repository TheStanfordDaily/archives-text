# Golf cart thefts 'disrespect the disabled'

Recent campus golf-cart thefts
on campus have some community
members asking whether the Uni
versity and its students properly re
spect the disabled, who rely on
University-owned golf carts for
transportation.
Most students agree that those
who steal the carts do not mean to
harm the injured students who
need them.
"I think that people who take
golf carts do so simply because
they want a golf cart to use," said
freshman Amber McCartney.
"Although it does disrespect the
disabled, I do not think that is
their intention."
According to Teri Adams, assis
tant director of the Office of Ac
cessible Education, the office gives
great consideration to the personal

circumstances of disabled students.
"All accommodations are deter
mined by professional staff who re
view each student's requests in
light of their documented disabili
ty, in combination with detailed
conversations with each student,"
Adams said.
An extensive golf cart service
called "Disgo" is available for use
by temporarily disabled students
on crutches. Rides are available be
tween 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday
through Friday, on a scheduled basis.
In addition to transportation as
sistance, accommodations for stu
dents with disabilities at Stanford
also include academic adjustments
and housing and dining modifica
tions as appropriate.
Students with mobility im
pairments frequently receive
housing accommodations made
in conjunction with Housing As
signment Services.

"They often need to have their
housing assignments relocated to
the first floor if their present assign
ment involves stairs," Adams said.
Those with disabilities can also
be accommodated in the form of a
less demanding academic schedule.
"A temporarily disabled stu
dent may decide to reduce their
courseload for the quarter if
they feel that just dealing with
their disability is taking up a lot
of their time and energy,"
Adams said.
She noted that the dispensation
is not offered to every student.
"This decision usually depends
upon the severity of the temporary
disability," Adams said.
Overall campus awareness of
the challenges faced by disabled
people is debatable. While peo
ple may express concern over
their physically impaired peers,
actions such as golf-cart thefts in

dicate otherwise.
"I often encounter bicycles
that are parked —or just
dropped — in the middle of
pathways, sometimes blocking
curb cuts and door buttons,"
Adams said. "I don't think that
the bike owner left his bike
where he did because he knew
and disregarded the inconve
nience or danger for visually im
paired persons that such an ob
stacle often creates. It simply
doesn't occur to the person be
cause they've never experienced
the receiving end of such action."
According to junior J.T. Batson,
a lack of understanding can lead
to discrimination.
"I don't think we are conscious
enough of how our actions affect
others in general," Batson said. "I
think greater diversity education,
in every sense of the word, would
be a plus."

Some students maintain that golf cart thefts on campus demonstrate dis
regard for the plight of disabled students.
