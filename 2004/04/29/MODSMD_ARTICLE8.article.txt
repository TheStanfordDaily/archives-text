# Space concerns addressed by administration
## 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
In an Asian American Students'
Association (AASA) Town Hall
meeting last night. Vice Provost
Gene Awakuni and Dean of Stu
dents Greg Boardman answered
student questions dealing with
funding and space for community
centers and student groups.
Awakuni and Boardman expressed
sympathy with the students' con
cerns but pointed to the reality of a
University-wide budget crunch.
According to Awakuni, the
community centers were hit by
budget cuts this year because of
general budget cuts to University
programs. Yet he pointed out that
in the two years before this year,
the community centers had been
protected by budget cuts.
"A lot of the money is encum
bered," Awakuni said. "Eighty per
cent of the money is endowed by
benefactors and it must go to cer
tain programs due to conditions of
bequest."
As the chair of the Student Ac
tivities Space Task Force, Awakuni
said he recognized the need for
more space for student groups to
make the campus more vibrant.
However, he said that the Universi
ty needed more money in order to
achieve this goal.
Boardman pointed out that in
the issue of money allocation, there
had to be a collaborative effort in
addition to relying on benefactors,
particularly in the area of special
fees. Boardman also noted that

while Stanford is near the bottom
in terms of funding for student
groups among its rivals, it is at the
top for the number of student
groups on campus — over 600.
"Stanford is very unique in
that regard, having students
choose what they want to fund,"
Boardman said. "Harvard and
Stanford are the only [top-tier]
schools with an optional fee
structure, and Harvard is having
a referendum this year to move
to a mandatory fee structure,
which would leave Stanford as
the only school with an optional
fee structure."
Boardman said that he would
be starting a study group com
posed of approximately 8 to 10
people, including a couple of
students, which would take an
investigative role in addressing
special fees. Jon Denney, direc
tor of the Stanford Fund, has al
ready volunteered to sit on this
committee.
On the issue of the renovating
Old Union, Awakuni said the Uni
versity only had enough money to
cover a small portion of the type of
renovation they hoped for, which
he described as ,"a dynamic plan
that will really revitalize student life."
AASA Treasurer Kevin Gao, a
sophomore, said that he appreciat
ed the fact that the administrators
addressed issues that have a direct
impact on student life.
"There were a lot of questions,
and it helps to have the people who
make the decisions honestly answer
them," Gao said.
