# Roe v. Wade attorney expresses concern over future of abortion
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Sarah Weddington, an attorney in one
of the 20th century's defining court cases,
Roe v. Wade, spoke last night to an inti
mate crowd at Kresge Auditorium. Dur
ing her speech, she expressed concern
about the future of abortion in the Unit
ed States.
Although Roe v. Wade was decided in
1973, it remains a controversial case even
today. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision
ultimately gave women the right to have
an abortion.
Weddington described her experience
before the Supreme Court in vivid terms,
and also discussed the multiple cases that
have threatened to overturn Roe v. Wade
over the past few decades. Many of these
cases, she said, have slowly been "eating
away at the foundation or Roe v. Wade."
Certain cases have fought the specific
wording regarding when the beginning of
life is officially defined, while another
case changed the burden of proof from
the state to the plaintiff, making it more
difficult for women to defend abortion in
the future.
At the conclusion of her talk, Wedding

ton related her views on the future of re
productive rights in the United States.
"People always ask me if Roe v. Wade
will be overturned," she said. "The reality
is that it really depends on who is on the
Supreme Court."
She mentioned that she had heard ru
mors that three of the Supreme Court Jus
tices were considering leaving the Court,
including Chief Justice William H. Rehn
quist, Sandra Day O'Connor and John
Paul Stevens.
"If a judge leaves, the president makes
the decision," Weddington said. "And
based on Bush's record of judge appoint
ments, I think we know what his stance is .
.. That's why the vote is so important — to
protect the Supreme Court decision [of
Roe v. Wade.]"
While Weddington said she was im
pressed with how strong the younger gen
erations were today, she said she was con
cerned with the fact that many younger
people took reproductive rights for granted.
"So many people cannot remember the
tragedies before Roe v. Wade — illegal
abortions, unsafe medical practices . ..
People take things for granted, thinking
things will always stay the same and 1 don't
think that they always wi11... Women in

my generation were shaped by the resis
tance they faced while growing up. People
would say 'Women can't do this,' or
'Women shouldn't do that,' all which made
us stronger."
However, after attending the March for
Women's Lives in Washington D.C. on
Sunday, a rally in support of reproductive
rights, she said she was encouraged by the
crowd.
"It was wonderful to see so many people
under 30 — it was quite inspiring."
Sophomore Neela Penumarthy, who
also attended the march and the event at
Kresge last night, said she inspired by the
diversity of the women present.
"There was such a diverse group of or
ganizers, which led to a very diverse group
of protesters," said Penumarthy.
Penumarthy also echoed Weddington's
thoughts on how abortion had become a
critical issue in the upcoming election.
"There were certainly many groups
with pro-Kerry stickers and posters," said
Penumarthy. "I wish that it wasn't an issue
that was divided along party lines, howev
er, because I think that making it so can
alienate so many people. In the end, it
should really come down to the woman's
right to choose."
