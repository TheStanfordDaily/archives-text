Honor those who have supported and guided you during
your years at Stanford with The Stole of Gratitude.
The Stole is worn during the commencement ceremony. After the ceremony,
present the Stole to a parent, relative, or mentor who has provided extraordinary
influence and support to your experience as a Stanford student. More than one
Stole may be worn during the commencement, symbolizing that there are
multiple persons destined to receive the Stole of Gratitude.
Stoles of Gratitude may be decorated. Presenters often write a few words of love
and appreciation on the back of the Stole using a permanent, fine tipped marker.
Friends and family of the graduate may autograph the front or back.
The Stole of Gratitude is a lasting symbol of love, appreciation, and the
academic accomplishment at Stanford University. It can also be saved as
a personal keepsake item for the graduate.
