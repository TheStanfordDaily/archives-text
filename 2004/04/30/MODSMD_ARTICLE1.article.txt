in The Review
An article and editorial in yester
day's Stanford Review that accused

the campus chapter of
MEChA of support
ing racism has gar
nered a negative re
sponse from Stan
ford's Chicano/Lati
no community.
In an editorial ti
tled "MEChA: Social
Justice Group or
KKK?" The Review
called MEChA "a
racist organization
that advocates revolu
tion and segregation,
dubbing it"the mod
ern-day Ku Klux Klan
of Chicanos."
Stanford MEChA,
or Movimiento Estu
diantil Chicano de
Aztlan, is a Chi
cano/Latino student
group that focuses on
social activism and
cultural awareness.
The group's mem

Clark Center still seeks funding
Now that professors and gradu
ate students are beginning research

in their modular labs in the new
Clark Center, the development of
fice has begun raising money for the
programs in the building. Stanford
has set a goal of raising more than
$125 million for research equip

ment, interdisciplinary grants and
graduate stipends for Bio-X over
the next few years, despite a diffi
cult economy and other simultane
ous fundraising goals.
With the Campaign for Under
graduate Education winding down,
some in the development office are
shifting their focus to the interdisci
plinary biosciences initiatives —
Bio-X and the new bioengineering
department — according to Susan
Abernathy, associate director of
principal gifts.
"The fundraising goal has a very
high priority," Abernathy said. "It's as
near-term as we can make it."
Funding for some programs was
up in the air in 2001 after main donor
Jim Clark suspended $60 million of
his $150 million pledge in protest of
President George W. Bush's policies
on stem-cell research. Now, accord
ing to fundraisers and Bio-X offi
cials, programs are on schedule,
though there is a bigger funding gap
to recoup.
