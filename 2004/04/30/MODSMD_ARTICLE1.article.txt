MEChA upset at KKK comparison
in The Review
An article and editorial in yester
day's Stanford Review that accused

the campus chapter of
MEChA of support
ing racism has gar
nered a negative re
sponse from Stan
ford's Chicano/Lati
no community.
In an editorial ti
tled "MEChA: Social
Justice Group or
KKK?" The Review
called MEChA "a
racist organization
that advocates revolu
tion and segregation,
dubbing it"the mod
ern-day Ku Klux Klan
of Chicanos."
Stanford MEChA,
or Movimiento Estu
diantil Chicano de
Aztlan, is a Chi
cano/Latino student
group that focuses on
social activism and
cultural awareness.
The group's mem
bers said they felt hurt
by the accusations of
the article and editor
ial, which they said
were inaccurate.

Clark Center still seeks funding
Now that professors and gradu
ate students are beginning research

in their modular labs in the new
Clark Center, the development of
fice has begun raising money for the
programs in the building. Stanford
has set a goal of raising more than
$125 million for research equip

ment, interdisciplinary grants and
graduate stipends for Bio-X over
the next few years, despite a diffi
cult economy and other simultane
ous fundraising goals.
With the Campaign for Under
graduate Education winding down,
some in the development office are
shifting their focus to the interdisci
plinary biosciences initiatives —
Bio-X and the new bioengineering
department — according to Susan
Abernathy, associate director of
principal gifts.
"The fundraising goal has a very
high priority," Abernathy said. "It's as
near-term as we can make it."
Funding for some programs was
up in the air in 2001 after main donor
Jim Clark suspended $60 million of
his $150 million pledge in protest of
President George W. Bush's policies
on stem-cell research. Now, accord
ing to fundraisers and Bio-X offi
cials, programs are on schedule,
though there is a bigger funding gap
to recoup.

Daily Board dismisses recall
Ammar Nayfeh from the Coalition

Board of Directors last night to recall
Editor in Chief Ramin Setoodeh, but
the Board did not believe grounds ex

The Daily did,- however, unani

New grad dorm may house 70(1
A large new graduate residence
planned near the Law School to
help remedy a housing shortage
has some members of the Stanford
community concerned.
According to current plans, the
residence will house 600 to 7(X) stu
dents — twice as many as Roble
Hall, which sleeps 311, according to
the ASSU Course Guide.
Mirrielees, the largest under
graduate residence, houses 435 stu
dents, according to the guide.
The residence will also cause the
removal of four houses on Sal
vatierra Walk.
Kathleen Sullivan, dean of the
Law School, stressed that the deci
sion to build the residence has not
yet been finalized and that al
though the project is becoming
more tangible, it remains in its
early stages.

Groping hiatus leaves
community hopeful
It's been more than three
months since the "Serial Groper"
has struck the Stanford campus,
and police and students are opti
mistic that he has moved on to
other haunts.
"He's kind of hard to catch if
he's not hitting," said Sgt. Rick Tip
ton. "He could have moved on."
The groper's last assault, as re
ported to police, was on Oct. 30.
"Part of crime-fighting is to
catch or displace," Tipton said. "He
could be the kind of guy who felt
uncomfortable and quit doing it,
but I doubt it."
Students remarked that they
had stopped worrying about the
groper ever since he became a cam
pus joke.
"People dressed up as him for
Halloween," noted freshman Kris
tie McCracken, who said she gener
ally felt safe on campus.
A sketch of the serial groper was
released a week prior to his last at
tack, and the sketch garnered atten
tion of the San Francisco Chronicle,
the San Jose Mercury News and the
Los Angeles Times.

Week-long campaign to stop
violence against women
continues, but "rape free
/.one" draws controversy
A plan to put up barricade tape
bearing the words "Rape Free
Zone" around fraternities has

drawn criticism lroni members of
the Greek community, who said the
plan plays on stereotypes linking
fraternities to sexual assault. The
"Rape Free Zones" are to he a part
of V-Week, a campaign to elimi
nate violence and sexual assault
against women.
Organizers insisted that while the
connection to fraternity stereotypes
is intentional, its purpose is to in
crease dialogue and awareness
about sexual assault on campus.
"We approached frats in the be
ginning because they have a reputa
tion for being a place where sexual
assault occurs," explained sopho
more Yana Kesala, one of the
event's organizers. "It's a complete
ly wrong stereotype, but a stereo
type nonetheless."
Sophomore Allison McKenzie,
another event organizer, acknowl
edged, "This statement is going to
stir up some controversy."
She pointed to the other non-
Greek houses and locations that would
also be included in the campaign.
"It wasn't our intention to single
frats out," McKenzie said.

ASSU brainstorms, pitches solu
tions for special-fee crunch
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate last night passed four bills de
signed to alleviate the shortage of
money created by this year's record
number of special-fees refund re
quests. The bills, drafted by the ad
hoc Review of Special Fees Com
mittee, addressed both the short
term funds crisis and the long-term
financial stability of Stanford's stu
dent groups, which rely on special

fees to subsidize their programs.
Pending approval by the Gradu
ate Student Council at its meeting
tonight, the bills will go into effect
immediately.
To solve this year's approaching
shortage, the legislation will use the
ASSU's buffer fund to cover actual
special-fees refunds for up to 16
percent of groups' quarterly oper
ating budgets. After that point, the
ASSU will take the money from
groups' reserve accounts, but the
buffer fund will cover refund-in
curred charges once groups' re
serves are exhausted. At the end of
the fiscal year, money left in groups'
operating budgets will go back into
the buffer fund in the amount of
any outstanding refund charge
above 16 percent.
The ASSU will also bolster its
buffer fund by liquidating the re
serves of six groups that have been
inactive for at least two years.

Band gets three-year suspension
The Band has been placed on a
three-year alcohol suspension
through winter quarter 2006-2007
for destruction of private property,
violating University policy and
state law for underage alcohol con
sumption and violating University
travel policy.
The charges stem from a Los An
geles road trip the Band took on
Oct. 10 of last year for a football
game against the University of
Southern California. The travel bus
was left in improper condition, with
broken equipment and vomit in the
bathroom sink.
The Dean of Students Greg

Boardman and the Organizational
Conduct Board placed additional
sanctions on the Band including a
one-year travel probation, 1,500
hours of community service of
which no more than 750 can be mu
sical performances and a ban from
traveling to or performing at the
Oct. 31 football game in Los Ange
les this year.
The "harshness" and volume of
the sanctions surprised the Band be
cause of the proactive steps the man
agement had taken after the road
trip to prevent similar incidents, ac
cording to Band Public Relations
Director Dan Bentley, a senior. The
Band plans to appeal some of the
sanctions in upcoming weeks.

•Potter College 1 to foster research
Aiming to encourage a broad ap
proach to undergraduate student re
search and counter the isolation that
often accompanies such an endeav
or, Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman has an
nounced the creation of Potter Col
lege, a residential community to be
located in Sterling Ouadrangle.
Some students have welcomed
the project, predicting that it will
create a supportive academic com
munity for those engaged in re
search, while others have criti
cized it for its potential to isolate
the dorm's residents in an antiso
cial environment.
"Independent scholarship, cre
ative explorations, thesis writing —
these can all be lonely enterprises,"
Bravman explained. "Our goal is to
provide the most supportive envi
ronment possible for students en

gaged in these endeavors."
Potter College residents will
benefit from staff support through a
Faculty Fellows Program and will
take part in the planning of in-col
lege colloquia. Students do not need
to be part of a particular discipline
to join Potter College, but should
have a desire to extend the academ
ic experience to their residences.

Recording industry sues
Stanford user
For the first time, the recording
industry has targeted an individual
at Stanford for illegally sharing
music through the University's
computer network. The copyright
infringement lawsuit came as part
of a new round of lawsuits that
specifically targeted file-sharers at
universities across the country.
The March 22 complaint filed
by the Recording Industry Asso
ciation of America (RIAA)
against a user on the Stanford
network is known as a "John
Doe" suit because the user is
known only by IP address. Before
the RIAA can force Stanford to
determine and reveal the individ
ual's identity, it must obtain a
subpoena for the action. Though
no subpoena has been issued, the
John Doe suit is the first step in
seeking a court order.
In a March 24 press conference
with college journalists, RIAA
President Cary Sherman stated,
"Obviously, college students are
a big part of the [online piracy]
problem, and therefore it was
only a question of time before
university users would be named
as defendants. That was what hap
pened yesterday. And we hope
that it will send a message to stu
dents across the country that this
activity is illegal and that engag

ing it can have consequences."

Kodrigucz implicated in
election misconduct
Early last evening, 11,746
Stanford e-mail addresses re
ceived an anonymous e-mail enti
tled "The Ugly Side of the ASSU

election." Sent from a Yahoo!
Account with the name "Stanford
TRULY educated voter," the e
mail criticized another message
sent to the Diaspora list support
ing the executive slate of junior
Ajani Husbands and sophomore
Alyssa Schwartz.
An excerpt from the e-mail reads,
"What we have in this election are
two slates that are both qualified and
committed to similar objectives, but
have different ideas about how to
achieve those objectives. One slate,
for example, decided that negative
campaigning was a good way to
achieve its own ends ... don't be
taken in by false campaign ads and
smear tactics."
Editors in Chief of the Stanford
Chaparral, lan Spiro and Steven
Yelderman, both seniors, and cur
rent vice presidential candidate
Matthew Henick, a junior, discov
ered that the e-mail was sent by for
mer ASSU Vice President Nick Ro
driguez, a senior.
Rodriguez emphasized that the e
mail was not affiliated with any of
the candidates and that it was writ
ten of his own volition.

Executive election results rejected;
Schwartz not to run with Husbands
Amid charges of campaign mis
conduct and unfairness, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate last night
voted six to two not to certify the

highly contested results of the ASSU
executive race that took place on
April 8 and 9.
A special election will likely
take place on May 5 and 6; it will
be open to new candidates and
new slates. Junior Ajani Husbands
and sophomore Alyssa Schwartz
have already announced that they
will not run again as a slate; this
does not preclude the possibility
that either of them will run with
another candidate.
All of the results from the spring
election besides the executive race
were certified unanimously.
The Senate's decision has no
precedent in recent electoral his
tory. In 2000 there was an execu
tive runoff when neither of the
two slates in the race obtained a
majority of students' votes, and
last year the race for Senior Class
president was challenged before
the Senate. But in neither case
were the results of the original
election rejected.

Virus hits campus: New bug strikes
library and residential computers
A new computer virus has
struck 600 to 800 campus comput
ers over the span of several weeks.
Commonly known as Gaobot,
Agobot or Phatbot, the virus has
grown through several methods,
taking advantage of un-patched
vulnerabilities last summer, blank

or poorly chosen passwords and
open file shares.
"The viruses are a blend of
dozens of attacks," said Sandra

Senti, executive director of tech
nology, strategy and support. "In
addition to propagating them
selves, they sniff login and pass
word information from the key
board, harvest e-mail addresses,
disable antivirus software and put

the machine under the remote
control of an attacker by listening
for commands on IRC."
This means that while the

virus does not have many direct
effects, it leaves the infected
computer very susceptible to
other viruses.

Kodrigucz implicated in
election misconduct
Early last evening, 11,746
Stanford e-mail addresses re
ceived an anonymous e-mail enti
tled "The Ugly Side of the ASSU

election." Sent from a Yahoo!
Account with the name "Stanford
TRULY educated voter," the e
mail criticized another message
sent to the Diaspora list support
ing the executive slate of junior
Ajani Husbands and sophomore
Alyssa Schwartz.
An excerpt from the e-mail reads,
"What we have in this election are
two slates that are both qualified and
committed to similar objectives, but
have different ideas about how to
achieve those objectives. One slate,
for example, decided that negative
campaigning was a good way to
achieve its own ends ... don't be
taken in by false campaign ads and
smear tactics."
Editors in Chief of the Stanford
Chaparral, lan Spiro and Steven
Yelderman, both seniors, and cur
rent vice presidential candidate
Matthew Henick, a junior, discov
ered that the e-mail was sent by for
mer ASSU Vice President Nick Ro
driguez, a senior.
Rodriguez emphasized that the e
mail was not affiliated with any of
the candidates and that it was writ
ten of his own volition.

Executive election results rejected;
Schwartz not to run with Husbands
Amid charges of campaign mis
conduct and unfairness, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate last night
voted six to two not to certify the

highly contested results of the ASSU
executive race that took place on
April 8 and 9.
A special election will likely
take place on May 5 and 6; it will
be open to new candidates and
new slates. Junior Ajani Husbands
and sophomore Alyssa Schwartz
have already announced that they
will not run again as a slate; this
does not preclude the possibility
that either of them will run with
another candidate.
All of the results from the spring
election besides the executive race
were certified unanimously.
The Senate's decision has no
precedent in recent electoral his
tory. In 2000 there was an execu
tive runoff when neither of the
two slates in the race obtained a
majority of students' votes, and
last year the race for Senior Class
president was challenged before
the Senate. But in neither case
were the results of the original
election rejected.

Virus hits campus: New bug strikes
library and residential computers
A new computer virus has
struck 600 to 800 campus comput
ers over the span of several weeks.
Commonly known as Gaobot,
Agobot or Phatbot, the virus has
grown through several methods,
taking advantage of un-patched
vulnerabilities last summer, blank

or poorly chosen passwords and
open file shares.
"The viruses are a blend of
dozens of attacks," said Sandra

Senti, executive director of tech
nology, strategy and support. "In
addition to propagating them
selves, they sniff login and pass
word information from the key
board, harvest e-mail addresses,
disable antivirus software and put

the machine under the remote
control of an attacker by listening
for commands on IRC."
This means that while the

virus does not have many direct
effects, it leaves the infected
computer very susceptible to
other viruses.

Clark Center still seeks funding
Now that professors and gradu
ate students are beginning research

in their modular labs in the new
Clark Center, the development of
fice has begun raising money for the
programs in the building. Stanford
has set a goal of raising more than
$125 million for research equip

ment, interdisciplinary grants and
graduate stipends for Bio-X over
the next few years, despite a diffi
cult economy and other simultane
ous fundraising goals.
With the Campaign for Under
graduate Education winding down,
some in the development office are
shifting their focus to the interdisci
plinary biosciences initiatives —
Bio-X and the new bioengineering
department — according to Susan
Abernathy, associate director of
principal gifts.
"The fundraising goal has a very
high priority," Abernathy said. "It's as
near-term as we can make it."
Funding for some programs was
up in the air in 2001 after main donor
Jim Clark suspended $60 million of
his $150 million pledge in protest of
President George W. Bush's policies
on stem-cell research. Now, accord
ing to fundraisers and Bio-X offi
cials, programs are on schedule,
though there is a bigger funding gap
to recoup.

Groping hiatus leaves
community hopeful
It's been more than three
months since the "Serial Groper"
has struck the Stanford campus,
and police and students are opti
mistic that he has moved on to
other haunts.
"He's kind of hard to catch if
he's not hitting," said Sgt. Rick Tip
ton. "He could have moved on."
The groper's last assault, as re
ported to police, was on Oct. 30.
"Part of crime-fighting is to
catch or displace," Tipton said. "He
could be the kind of guy who felt
uncomfortable and quit doing it,
but I doubt it."
Students remarked that they
had stopped worrying about the
groper ever since he became a cam

"People dressed up as him for
Halloween," noted freshman Kris
tie McCracken, who said she gener
ally felt safe on campus.
A sketch of the serial groper was
released a week prior to his last at

Week-long campaign to stop

A plan to put up barricade tape
bearing the words "Rape Free

fraternities to sexual assault. The
"Rape Free Zones" are to he a part

against women.
Organizers insisted that while the
connection to fraternity stereotypes
is intentional, its purpose is to in
crease dialogue and awareness
about sexual assault on campus.
"We approached frats in the be

tion for being a place where sexual
assault occurs," explained sopho

event's organizers. "It's a complete

Sophomore Allison McKenzie,

ASSU brainstorms, pitches solu
tions for special-fee crunch
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate last night passed four bills de
signed to alleviate the shortage of
money created by this year's record
number of special-fees refund re
quests. The bills, drafted by the ad
hoc Review of Special Fees Com
mittee, addressed both the short
term funds crisis and the long-term
financial stability of Stanford's stu
dent groups, which rely on special

fees to subsidize their programs.
Pending approval by the Gradu
ate Student Council at its meeting
tonight, the bills will go into effect
immediately.
To solve this year's approaching
shortage, the legislation will use the
ASSU's buffer fund to cover actual
special-fees refunds for up to 16
percent of groups' quarterly oper
ating budgets. After that point, the
ASSU will take the money from
groups' reserve accounts, but the
buffer fund will cover refund-in
curred charges once groups' re
serves are exhausted. At the end of
the fiscal year, money left in groups'
operating budgets will go back into
the buffer fund in the amount of
any outstanding refund charge
above 16 percent.
The ASSU will also bolster its
buffer fund by liquidating the re
serves of six groups that have been
inactive for at least two years.

Band gets three-year suspension
The Band has been placed on a
three-year alcohol suspension
through winter quarter 2006-2007
for destruction of private property,
violating University policy and
state law for underage alcohol con
sumption and violating University
travel policy.
The charges stem from a Los An
geles road trip the Band took on
Oct. 10 of last year for a football
game against the University of
Southern California. The travel bus
was left in improper condition, with
broken equipment and vomit in the
bathroom sink.
The Dean of Students Greg

Boardman and the Organizational
Conduct Board placed additional
sanctions on the Band including a
one-year travel probation, 1,500
hours of community service of
which no more than 750 can be mu
sical performances and a ban from
traveling to or performing at the
Oct. 31 football game in Los Ange
les this year.
The "harshness" and volume of
the sanctions surprised the Band be
cause of the proactive steps the man
agement had taken after the road
trip to prevent similar incidents, ac
cording to Band Public Relations
Director Dan Bentley, a senior. The
Band plans to appeal some of the
sanctions in upcoming weeks.

•Potter College 1 to foster research
Aiming to encourage a broad ap

search and counter the isolation that
often accompanies such an endeav
or, Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman has an
nounced the creation of Potter Col
lege, a residential community to be
located in Sterling Ouadrangle.
Some students have welcomed
the project, predicting that it will
create a supportive academic com
munity for those engaged in re
search, while others have criti
cized it for its potential to isolate
the dorm's residents in an antiso
cial environment.
"Independent scholarship, cre
ative explorations, thesis writing —
these can all be lonely enterprises,"
Bravman explained. "Our goal is to
provide the most supportive envi
ronment possible for students en

gaged in these endeavors."
Potter College residents will
benefit from staff support through a
Faculty Fellows Program and will
take part in the planning of in-col
lege colloquia. Students do not need
to be part of a particular discipline
to join Potter College, but should
have a desire to extend the academ
ic experience to their residences.

Recording industry sues
Stanford user
For the first time, the recording
industry has targeted an individual
at Stanford for illegally sharing
music through the University's
computer network. The copyright
infringement lawsuit came as part
of a new round of lawsuits that
specifically targeted file-sharers at
universities across the country.
The March 22 complaint filed
by the Recording Industry Asso
ciation of America (RIAA)
against a user on the Stanford
network is known as a "John
Doe" suit because the user is
known only by IP address. Before
the RIAA can force Stanford to
determine and reveal the individ
ual's identity, it must obtain a
subpoena for the action. Though
no subpoena has been issued, the
John Doe suit is the first step in
seeking a court order.
In a March 24 press conference
with college journalists, RIAA
President Cary Sherman stated,
"Obviously, college students are
a big part of the [online piracy]
problem, and therefore it was
only a question of time before
university users would be named
as defendants. That was what hap
pened yesterday. And we hope
that it will send a message to stu
dents across the country that this
activity is illegal and that engag

ing it can have consequences."

Band gets three-year suspension
The Band has been placed on a
three-year alcohol suspension
through winter quarter 2006-2007
for destruction of private property,
violating University policy and
state law for underage alcohol con
sumption and violating University
travel policy.
The charges stem from a Los An
geles road trip the Band took on
Oct. 10 of last year for a football
game against the University of
Southern California. The travel bus
was left in improper condition, with
broken equipment and vomit in the
bathroom sink.
The Dean of Students Greg

Boardman and the Organizational
Conduct Board placed additional
sanctions on the Band including a
one-year travel probation, 1,500
hours of community service of
which no more than 750 can be mu
sical performances and a ban from
traveling to or performing at the
Oct. 31 football game in Los Ange
les this year.
The "harshness" and volume of
the sanctions surprised the Band be
cause of the proactive steps the man
agement had taken after the road
trip to prevent similar incidents, ac
cording to Band Public Relations
Director Dan Bentley, a senior. The
Band plans to appeal some of the
sanctions in upcoming weeks.

•Potter College 1 to foster research
Aiming to encourage a broad ap
proach to undergraduate student re
search and counter the isolation that
often accompanies such an endeav
or, Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman has an
nounced the creation of Potter Col
lege, a residential community to be
located in Sterling Ouadrangle.
Some students have welcomed
the project, predicting that it will
create a supportive academic com
munity for those engaged in re
search, while others have criti
cized it for its potential to isolate
the dorm's residents in an antiso
cial environment.
"Independent scholarship, cre
ative explorations, thesis writing —
these can all be lonely enterprises,"
Bravman explained. "Our goal is to
provide the most supportive envi
ronment possible for students en

gaged in these endeavors."
Potter College residents will
benefit from staff support through a
Faculty Fellows Program and will
take part in the planning of in-col
lege colloquia. Students do not need
to be part of a particular discipline
to join Potter College, but should
have a desire to extend the academ
ic experience to their residences.

Recording industry sues
Stanford user
For the first time, the recording
industry has targeted an individual
at Stanford for illegally sharing
music through the University's
computer network. The copyright
infringement lawsuit came as part
of a new round of lawsuits that
specifically targeted file-sharers at
universities across the country.
The March 22 complaint filed
by the Recording Industry Asso
ciation of America (RIAA)
against a user on the Stanford
network is known as a "John
Doe" suit because the user is
known only by IP address. Before
the RIAA can force Stanford to
determine and reveal the individ
ual's identity, it must obtain a
subpoena for the action. Though
no subpoena has been issued, the
John Doe suit is the first step in
seeking a court order.
In a March 24 press conference
with college journalists, RIAA
President Cary Sherman stated,
"Obviously, college students are
a big part of the [online piracy]
problem, and therefore it was
only a question of time before
university users would be named
as defendants. That was what hap
pened yesterday. And we hope
that it will send a message to stu
dents across the country that this
activity is illegal and that engag

ing it can have consequences."

Kodrigucz implicated in
election misconduct
Early last evening, 11,746
Stanford e-mail addresses re
ceived an anonymous e-mail enti
tled "The Ugly Side of the ASSU

election." Sent from a Yahoo!
Account with the name "Stanford
TRULY educated voter," the e
mail criticized another message
sent to the Diaspora list support
ing the executive slate of junior
Ajani Husbands and sophomore
Alyssa Schwartz.
An excerpt from the e-mail reads,
"What we have in this election are
two slates that are both qualified and
committed to similar objectives, but
have different ideas about how to
achieve those objectives. One slate,
for example, decided that negative
campaigning was a good way to
achieve its own ends ... don't be
taken in by false campaign ads and
smear tactics."
Editors in Chief of the Stanford
Chaparral, lan Spiro and Steven
Yelderman, both seniors, and cur
rent vice presidential candidate
Matthew Henick, a junior, discov
ered that the e-mail was sent by for
mer ASSU Vice President Nick Ro
driguez, a senior.
Rodriguez emphasized that the e
mail was not affiliated with any of
the candidates and that it was writ

Executive election results rejected;
Schwartz not to run with Husbands
Amid charges of campaign mis
conduct and unfairness, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate last night
voted six to two not to certify the

highly contested results of the ASSU
executive race that took place on
April 8 and 9.
A special election will likely
take place on May 5 and 6; it will
be open to new candidates and
new slates. Junior Ajani Husbands
and sophomore Alyssa Schwartz
have already announced that they
will not run again as a slate; this
does not preclude the possibility
that either of them will run with
another candidate.
All of the results from the spring
election besides the executive race
were certified unanimously.
The Senate's decision has no
precedent in recent electoral his
tory. In 2000 there was an execu
tive runoff when neither of the
two slates in the race obtained a
majority of students' votes, and
last year the race for Senior Class
president was challenged before
the Senate. But in neither case
were the results of the original
election rejected.

Virus hits campus: New bug strikes
library and residential computers
A new computer virus has
struck 600 to 800 campus comput
ers over the span of several weeks.
Commonly known as Gaobot,
Agobot or Phatbot, the virus has
grown through several methods,
taking advantage of un-patched
vulnerabilities last summer, blank

or poorly chosen passwords and
open file shares.
"The viruses are a blend of
dozens of attacks," said Sandra

Senti, executive director of tech
nology, strategy and support. "In
addition to propagating them
selves, they sniff login and pass
word information from the key
board, harvest e-mail addresses,
disable antivirus software and put

the machine under the remote
control of an attacker by listening
for commands on IRC."
This means that while the

virus does not have many direct
effects, it leaves the infected
computer very susceptible to
other viruses.

Clark Center still seeks funding
Now that professors and gradu

in their modular labs in the new
Clark Center, the development of
fice has begun raising money for the
programs in the building. Stanford
has set a goal of raising more than
$125 million for research equip

ment, interdisciplinary grants and
graduate stipends for Bio-X over
the next few years, despite a diffi
cult economy and other simultane
ous fundraising goals.
With the Campaign for Under
graduate Education winding down,
some in the development office are
shifting their focus to the interdisci
plinary biosciences initiatives —
Bio-X and the new bioengineering
department — according to Susan
Abernathy, associate director of
principal gifts.
"The fundraising goal has a very
high priority," Abernathy said. "It's as
near-term as we can make it."
Funding for some programs was
up in the air in 2001 after main donor
Jim Clark suspended $60 million of
his $150 million pledge in protest of
President George W. Bush's policies
on stem-cell research. Now, accord
ing to fundraisers and Bio-X offi
cials, programs are on schedule,
though there is a bigger funding gap
to recoup.

Groping hiatus leaves
community hopeful
It's been more than three
months since the "Serial Groper"
has struck the Stanford campus,
and police and students are opti
mistic that he has moved on to
other haunts.
"He's kind of hard to catch if
he's not hitting," said Sgt. Rick Tip
ton. "He could have moved on."
The groper's last assault, as re
ported to police, was on Oct. 30.
"Part of crime-fighting is to
catch or displace," Tipton said. "He
could be the kind of guy who felt
uncomfortable and quit doing it,
but I doubt it."
Students remarked that they
had stopped worrying about the
groper ever since he became a cam
pus joke.
"People dressed up as him for
Halloween," noted freshman Kris
tie McCracken, who said she gener
ally felt safe on campus.
A sketch of the serial groper was
released a week prior to his last at
tack, and the sketch garnered atten
tion of the San Francisco Chronicle,
the San Jose Mercury News and the
Los Angeles Times.

Week-long campaign to stop

/.one" draws controversy
A plan to put up barricade tape
bearing the words "Rape Free
Zone" around fraternities has

drawn criticism lroni members of
the Greek community, who said the
plan plays on stereotypes linking
fraternities to sexual assault. The
"Rape Free Zones" are to he a part
of V-Week, a campaign to elimi
nate violence and sexual assault
against women.
Organizers insisted that while the
connection to fraternity stereotypes
is intentional, its purpose is to in
crease dialogue and awareness
about sexual assault on campus.
"We approached frats in the be
ginning because they have a reputa
tion for being a place where sexual
assault occurs," explained sopho
more Yana Kesala, one of the
event's organizers. "It's a complete
ly wrong stereotype, but a stereo
type nonetheless."
Sophomore Allison McKenzie,
another event organizer, acknowl

stir up some controversy."
She pointed to the other non-
Greek houses and locations that would
also be included in the campaign.
"It wasn't our intention to single

ASSU brainstorms, pitches solu
tions for special-fee crunch
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate last night passed four bills de
signed to alleviate the shortage of
money created by this year's record
number of special-fees refund re
quests. The bills, drafted by the ad
hoc Review of Special Fees Com
mittee, addressed both the short
term funds crisis and the long-term
financial stability of Stanford's stu
dent groups, which rely on special

fees to subsidize their programs.
Pending approval by the Gradu
ate Student Council at its meeting
tonight, the bills will go into effect
immediately.
To solve this year's approaching
shortage, the legislation will use the
ASSU's buffer fund to cover actual
special-fees refunds for up to 16
percent of groups' quarterly oper
ating budgets. After that point, the
ASSU will take the money from
groups' reserve accounts, but the
buffer fund will cover refund-in
curred charges once groups' re
serves are exhausted. At the end of
the fiscal year, money left in groups'
operating budgets will go back into
the buffer fund in the amount of
any outstanding refund charge
above 16 percent.
The ASSU will also bolster its
buffer fund by liquidating the re
serves of six groups that have been
inactive for at least two years.

Groping hiatus leaves
community hopeful
It's been more than three
months since the "Serial Groper"
has struck the Stanford campus,
and police and students are opti
mistic that he has moved on to
other haunts.
"He's kind of hard to catch if
he's not hitting," said Sgt. Rick Tip
ton. "He could have moved on."
The groper's last assault, as re
ported to police, was on Oct. 30.
"Part of crime-fighting is to
catch or displace," Tipton said. "He
could be the kind of guy who felt
uncomfortable and quit doing it,
but I doubt it."
Students remarked that they
had stopped worrying about the
groper ever since he became a cam
pus joke.
"People dressed up as him for
Halloween," noted freshman Kris
tie McCracken, who said she gener
ally felt safe on campus.
A sketch of the serial groper was
released a week prior to his last at
tack, and the sketch garnered atten
tion of the San Francisco Chronicle,
the San Jose Mercury News and the
Los Angeles Times.

Week-long campaign to stop
violence against women
continues, but "rape free
/.one" draws controversy
A plan to put up barricade tape
bearing the words "Rape Free
Zone" around fraternities has

drawn criticism lroni members of
the Greek community, who said the
plan plays on stereotypes linking
fraternities to sexual assault. The
"Rape Free Zones" are to he a part
of V-Week, a campaign to elimi
nate violence and sexual assault
against women.
Organizers insisted that while the
connection to fraternity stereotypes
is intentional, its purpose is to in
crease dialogue and awareness
about sexual assault on campus.
"We approached frats in the be
ginning because they have a reputa
tion for being a place where sexual
assault occurs," explained sopho
more Yana Kesala, one of the
event's organizers. "It's a complete
ly wrong stereotype, but a stereo
type nonetheless."
Sophomore Allison McKenzie,
another event organizer, acknowl
edged, "This statement is going to
stir up some controversy."
She pointed to the other non-
Greek houses and locations that would
also be included in the campaign.
"It wasn't our intention to single
frats out," McKenzie said.

ASSU brainstorms, pitches solu
tions for special-fee crunch
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate last night passed four bills de
signed to alleviate the shortage of
money created by this year's record
number of special-fees refund re
quests. The bills, drafted by the ad
hoc Review of Special Fees Com
mittee, addressed both the short
term funds crisis and the long-term
financial stability of Stanford's stu
dent groups, which rely on special

fees to subsidize their programs.
Pending approval by the Gradu
ate Student Council at its meeting
tonight, the bills will go into effect
immediately.
To solve this year's approaching
shortage, the legislation will use the
ASSU's buffer fund to cover actual
special-fees refunds for up to 16
percent of groups' quarterly oper
ating budgets. After that point, the
ASSU will take the money from
groups' reserve accounts, but the
buffer fund will cover refund-in
curred charges once groups' re
serves are exhausted. At the end of
the fiscal year, money left in groups'
operating budgets will go back into
the buffer fund in the amount of
any outstanding refund charge
above 16 percent.
The ASSU will also bolster its
buffer fund by liquidating the re
serves of six groups that have been
inactive for at least two years.

Band gets three-year suspension
The Band has been placed on a
three-year alcohol suspension
through winter quarter 2006-2007
for destruction of private property,
violating University policy and
state law for underage alcohol con
sumption and violating University
travel policy.
The charges stem from a Los An
geles road trip the Band took on
Oct. 10 of last year for a football
game against the University of
Southern California. The travel bus
was left in improper condition, with
broken equipment and vomit in the
bathroom sink.
The Dean of Students Greg

Boardman and the Organizational
Conduct Board placed additional
sanctions on the Band including a
one-year travel probation, 1,500
hours of community service of
which no more than 750 can be mu
sical performances and a ban from
traveling to or performing at the
Oct. 31 football game in Los Ange
les this year.
The "harshness" and volume of
the sanctions surprised the Band be
cause of the proactive steps the man
agement had taken after the road
trip to prevent similar incidents, ac
cording to Band Public Relations
Director Dan Bentley, a senior. The
Band plans to appeal some of the
sanctions in upcoming weeks.

•Potter College 1 to foster research
Aiming to encourage a broad ap
proach to undergraduate student re
search and counter the isolation that
often accompanies such an endeav
or, Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman has an
nounced the creation of Potter Col
lege, a residential community to be
located in Sterling Ouadrangle.
Some students have welcomed
the project, predicting that it will
create a supportive academic com
munity for those engaged in re
search, while others have criti
cized it for its potential to isolate
the dorm's residents in an antiso
cial environment.
"Independent scholarship, cre
ative explorations, thesis writing —
these can all be lonely enterprises,"
Bravman explained. "Our goal is to
provide the most supportive envi
ronment possible for students en

gaged in these endeavors."
Potter College residents will
benefit from staff support through a
Faculty Fellows Program and will
take part in the planning of in-col
lege colloquia. Students do not need
to be part of a particular discipline
to join Potter College, but should
have a desire to extend the academ
ic experience to their residences.

Recording industry sues
Stanford user
For the first time, the recording
industry has targeted an individual
at Stanford for illegally sharing
music through the University's
computer network. The copyright
infringement lawsuit came as part
of a new round of lawsuits that
specifically targeted file-sharers at
universities across the country.
The March 22 complaint filed
by the Recording Industry Asso
ciation of America (RIAA)
against a user on the Stanford
network is known as a "John
Doe" suit because the user is
known only by IP address. Before
the RIAA can force Stanford to
determine and reveal the individ
ual's identity, it must obtain a
subpoena for the action. Though
no subpoena has been issued, the
John Doe suit is the first step in
seeking a court order.
In a March 24 press conference
with college journalists, RIAA
President Cary Sherman stated,
"Obviously, college students are
a big part of the [online piracy]
problem, and therefore it was
only a question of time before
university users would be named
as defendants. That was what hap
pened yesterday. And we hope
that it will send a message to stu
dents across the country that this
activity is illegal and that engag

ing it can have consequences."

Kodrigucz implicated in
election misconduct
Early last evening, 11,746
Stanford e-mail addresses re
ceived an anonymous e-mail enti
tled "The Ugly Side of the ASSU

election." Sent from a Yahoo!
Account with the name "Stanford
TRULY educated voter," the e
mail criticized another message
sent to the Diaspora list support
ing the executive slate of junior
Ajani Husbands and sophomore
Alyssa Schwartz.
An excerpt from the e-mail reads,
"What we have in this election are
two slates that are both qualified and
committed to similar objectives, but
have different ideas about how to
achieve those objectives. One slate,
for example, decided that negative
campaigning was a good way to
achieve its own ends ... don't be
taken in by false campaign ads and
smear tactics."
Editors in Chief of the Stanford
Chaparral, lan Spiro and Steven
Yelderman, both seniors, and cur
rent vice presidential candidate
Matthew Henick, a junior, discov
ered that the e-mail was sent by for
mer ASSU Vice President Nick Ro

Executive election results rejected;
Schwartz not to run with Husbands
Amid charges of campaign mis
conduct and unfairness, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate last night
voted six to two not to certify the

highly contested results of the ASSU
executive race that took place on
April 8 and 9.
A special election will likely
take place on May 5 and 6; it will
be open to new candidates and
new slates. Junior Ajani Husbands
and sophomore Alyssa Schwartz
have already announced that they
will not run again as a slate; this
does not preclude the possibility
that either of them will run with
another candidate.
All of the results from the spring
election besides the executive race
were certified unanimously.
The Senate's decision has no
precedent in recent electoral his
tory. In 2000 there was an execu
tive runoff when neither of the
two slates in the race obtained a
majority of students' votes, and
last year the race for Senior Class
president was challenged before
the Senate. But in neither case
were the results of the original
election rejected.

Virus hits campus: New bug strikes
library and residential computers
A new computer virus has
struck 600 to 800 campus comput
ers over the span of several weeks.
Commonly known as Gaobot,
Agobot or Phatbot, the virus has
grown through several methods,
taking advantage of un-patched
vulnerabilities last summer, blank

or poorly chosen passwords and
open file shares.
"The viruses are a blend of
dozens of attacks," said Sandra

Senti, executive director of tech
nology, strategy and support. "In
addition to propagating them
selves, they sniff login and pass
word information from the key
board, harvest e-mail addresses,
disable antivirus software and put

the machine under the remote
control of an attacker by listening
for commands on IRC."
This means that while the

virus does not have many direct
effects, it leaves the infected
computer very susceptible to
other viruses.

Clark Center still seeks funding
Now that professors and gradu

in their modular labs in the new
Clark Center, the development of
fice has begun raising money for the
programs in the building. Stanford
has set a goal of raising more than
$125 million for research equip

ment, interdisciplinary grants and
graduate stipends for Bio-X over
the next few years, despite a diffi
cult economy and other simultane
ous fundraising goals.
With the Campaign for Under
graduate Education winding down,
some in the development office are
shifting their focus to the interdisci
plinary biosciences initiatives —
Bio-X and the new bioengineering
department — according to Susan
Abernathy, associate director of
principal gifts.
"The fundraising goal has a very
high priority," Abernathy said. "It's as
near-term as we can make it."
Funding for some programs was
up in the air in 2001 after main donor
Jim Clark suspended $60 million of
his $150 million pledge in protest of
President George W. Bush's policies
on stem-cell research. Now, accord
ing to fundraisers and Bio-X offi
cials, programs are on schedule,
though there is a bigger funding gap
to recoup.

Clark Center still seeks funding
Now that professors and gradu
ate students are beginning research

in their modular labs in the new
Clark Center, the development of
fice has begun raising money for the
programs in the building. Stanford
has set a goal of raising more than
$125 million for research equip

ment, interdisciplinary grants and
graduate stipends for Bio-X over
the next few years, despite a diffi
cult economy and other simultane
ous fundraising goals.
With the Campaign for Under
graduate Education winding down,
some in the development office are
shifting their focus to the interdisci
plinary biosciences initiatives —
Bio-X and the new bioengineering
department — according to Susan
Abernathy, associate director of
principal gifts.
"The fundraising goal has a very
high priority," Abernathy said. "It's as
near-term as we can make it."
Funding for some programs was
up in the air in 2001 after main donor
Jim Clark suspended $60 million of
his $150 million pledge in protest of
President George W. Bush's policies
on stem-cell research. Now, accord
ing to fundraisers and Bio-X offi
cials, programs are on schedule,
though there is a bigger funding gap
to recoup.

New grad dorm may house 70(1
A large new graduate residence
planned near the Law School to
help remedy a housing shortage
has some members of the Stanford
community concerned.
According to current plans, the
residence will house 600 to 7(X) stu
dents — twice as many as Roble
Hall, which sleeps 311, according to
the ASSU Course Guide.
Mirrielees, the largest under
graduate residence, houses 435 stu
dents, according to the guide.
The residence will also cause the
removal of four houses on Sal
vatierra Walk.
Kathleen Sullivan, dean of the
Law School, stressed that the deci
sion to build the residence has not
yet been finalized and that al
though the project is becoming
more tangible, it remains in its
early stages.

Groping hiatus leaves
community hopeful
It's been more than three
months since the "Serial Groper"
has struck the Stanford campus,
and police and students are opti
mistic that he has moved on to
other haunts.
"He's kind of hard to catch if
he's not hitting," said Sgt. Rick Tip
ton. "He could have moved on."
The groper's last assault, as re
ported to police, was on Oct. 30.
"Part of crime-fighting is to
catch or displace," Tipton said. "He
could be the kind of guy who felt
uncomfortable and quit doing it,
but I doubt it."
Students remarked that they
had stopped worrying about the
groper ever since he became a cam
pus joke.
"People dressed up as him for
Halloween," noted freshman Kris
tie McCracken, who said she gener
ally felt safe on campus.
A sketch of the serial groper was
released a week prior to his last at
tack, and the sketch garnered atten
tion of the San Francisco Chronicle,
the San Jose Mercury News and the
Los Angeles Times.

Week-long campaign to stop
violence against women
continues, but "rape free
/.one" draws controversy
A plan to put up barricade tape
bearing the words "Rape Free
Zone" around fraternities has

drawn criticism lroni members of
the Greek community, who said the
plan plays on stereotypes linking
fraternities to sexual assault. The
"Rape Free Zones" are to he a part
of V-Week, a campaign to elimi
nate violence and sexual assault
against women.
Organizers insisted that while the
connection to fraternity stereotypes
is intentional, its purpose is to in
crease dialogue and awareness
about sexual assault on campus.
"We approached frats in the be
ginning because they have a reputa
tion for being a place where sexual
assault occurs," explained sopho
more Yana Kesala, one of the
event's organizers. "It's a complete
ly wrong stereotype, but a stereo
type nonetheless."
Sophomore Allison McKenzie,
another event organizer, acknowl
edged, "This statement is going to
stir up some controversy."
She pointed to the other non-
Greek houses and locations that would
also be included in the campaign.
"It wasn't our intention to single
frats out," McKenzie said.

ASSU brainstorms, pitches solu
tions for special-fee crunch
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate last night passed four bills de
signed to alleviate the shortage of
money created by this year's record
number of special-fees refund re
quests. The bills, drafted by the ad
hoc Review of Special Fees Com
mittee, addressed both the short
term funds crisis and the long-term
financial stability of Stanford's stu
dent groups, which rely on special

fees to subsidize their programs.
Pending approval by the Gradu
ate Student Council at its meeting
tonight, the bills will go into effect
immediately.
To solve this year's approaching
shortage, the legislation will use the
ASSU's buffer fund to cover actual
special-fees refunds for up to 16
percent of groups' quarterly oper
ating budgets. After that point, the
ASSU will take the money from
groups' reserve accounts, but the
buffer fund will cover refund-in
curred charges once groups' re
serves are exhausted. At the end of
the fiscal year, money left in groups'
operating budgets will go back into
the buffer fund in the amount of
any outstanding refund charge
above 16 percent.
The ASSU will also bolster its
buffer fund by liquidating the re
serves of six groups that have been
inactive for at least two years.

Band gets three-year suspension
The Band has been placed on a
three-year alcohol suspension
through winter quarter 2006-2007
for destruction of private property,
violating University policy and
state law for underage alcohol con
sumption and violating University
travel policy.
The charges stem from a Los An
geles road trip the Band took on
Oct. 10 of last year for a football
game against the University of
Southern California. The travel bus
was left in improper condition, with
broken equipment and vomit in the
bathroom sink.
The Dean of Students Greg

Boardman and the Organizational
Conduct Board placed additional
sanctions on the Band including a
one-year travel probation, 1,500
hours of community service of
which no more than 750 can be mu
sical performances and a ban from
traveling to or performing at the
Oct. 31 football game in Los Ange
les this year.
The "harshness" and volume of
the sanctions surprised the Band be
cause of the proactive steps the man
agement had taken after the road
trip to prevent similar incidents, ac
cording to Band Public Relations
Director Dan Bentley, a senior. The
Band plans to appeal some of the
sanctions in upcoming weeks.

•Potter College 1 to foster research
Aiming to encourage a broad ap
proach to undergraduate student re
search and counter the isolation that
often accompanies such an endeav
or, Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman has an
nounced the creation of Potter Col
lege, a residential community to be
located in Sterling Ouadrangle.
Some students have welcomed
the project, predicting that it will
create a supportive academic com
munity for those engaged in re
search, while others have criti
cized it for its potential to isolate
the dorm's residents in an antiso
cial environment.
"Independent scholarship, cre
ative explorations, thesis writing —
these can all be lonely enterprises,"
Bravman explained. "Our goal is to
provide the most supportive envi
ronment possible for students en

gaged in these endeavors."
Potter College residents will
benefit from staff support through a
Faculty Fellows Program and will
take part in the planning of in-col
lege colloquia. Students do not need
to be part of a particular discipline
to join Potter College, but should
have a desire to extend the academ
ic experience to their residences.

Recording industry sues
Stanford user
For the first time, the recording
industry has targeted an individual
at Stanford for illegally sharing
music through the University's
computer network. The copyright
infringement lawsuit came as part
of a new round of lawsuits that
specifically targeted file-sharers at
universities across the country.
The March 22 complaint filed
by the Recording Industry Asso
ciation of America (RIAA)
against a user on the Stanford
network is known as a "John
Doe" suit because the user is
known only by IP address. Before
the RIAA can force Stanford to
determine and reveal the individ
ual's identity, it must obtain a
subpoena for the action. Though
no subpoena has been issued, the
John Doe suit is the first step in
seeking a court order.
In a March 24 press conference
with college journalists, RIAA
President Cary Sherman stated,
"Obviously, college students are
a big part of the [online piracy]
problem, and therefore it was
only a question of time before
university users would be named
as defendants. That was what hap
pened yesterday. And we hope
that it will send a message to stu
dents across the country that this
activity is illegal and that engag

ing it can have consequences."

Kodrigucz implicated in
election misconduct
Early last evening, 11,746
Stanford e-mail addresses re
ceived an anonymous e-mail enti
tled "The Ugly Side of the ASSU

election." Sent from a Yahoo!
Account with the name "Stanford
TRULY educated voter," the e
mail criticized another message
sent to the Diaspora list support
ing the executive slate of junior
Ajani Husbands and sophomore
Alyssa Schwartz.
An excerpt from the e-mail reads,
"What we have in this election are
two slates that are both qualified and
committed to similar objectives, but
have different ideas about how to
achieve those objectives. One slate,
for example, decided that negative
campaigning was a good way to
achieve its own ends ... don't be
taken in by false campaign ads and
smear tactics."
Editors in Chief of the Stanford
Chaparral, lan Spiro and Steven
Yelderman, both seniors, and cur
rent vice presidential candidate
Matthew Henick, a junior, discov
ered that the e-mail was sent by for
mer ASSU Vice President Nick Ro
driguez, a senior.
Rodriguez emphasized that the e
mail was not affiliated with any of
the candidates and that it was writ
ten of his own volition.

Executive election results rejected;
Schwartz not to run with Husbands
Amid charges of campaign mis
conduct and unfairness, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate last night
voted six to two not to certify the

highly contested results of the ASSU
executive race that took place on
April 8 and 9.
A special election will likely
take place on May 5 and 6; it will
be open to new candidates and
new slates. Junior Ajani Husbands
and sophomore Alyssa Schwartz
have already announced that they
will not run again as a slate; this
does not preclude the possibility
that either of them will run with
another candidate.
All of the results from the spring
election besides the executive race
were certified unanimously.
The Senate's decision has no
precedent in recent electoral his
tory. In 2000 there was an execu
tive runoff when neither of the
two slates in the race obtained a
majority of students' votes, and
last year the race for Senior Class
president was challenged before
the Senate. But in neither case
were the results of the original
election rejected.

Virus hits campus: New bug strikes
library and residential computers
A new computer virus has
struck 600 to 800 campus comput
ers over the span of several weeks.
Commonly known as Gaobot,
Agobot or Phatbot, the virus has
grown through several methods,
taking advantage of un-patched
vulnerabilities last summer, blank

or poorly chosen passwords and
open file shares.
"The viruses are a blend of
dozens of attacks," said Sandra

Senti, executive director of tech
nology, strategy and support. "In
addition to propagating them
selves, they sniff login and pass
word information from the key
board, harvest e-mail addresses,
disable antivirus software and put

the machine under the remote
control of an attacker by listening
for commands on IRC."
This means that while the

virus does not have many direct
effects, it leaves the infected
computer very susceptible to
other viruses.
