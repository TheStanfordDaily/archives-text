# Eat, drink and be merry
## Dessert comes first 
### 
I remember when I first
arrived on campus, I
thought it just a little
bit unusual that Stan
ford had its own zip code.
And its own post office.
And that the carpool traffic
for the local elementary
school was backed up to my
freshman dorm. I began to
wonder if Stanford did own
everything; if I would be

trapped in this bubble-like existence for the
next four years.
Would I spend all my time chilling at the
CoHo? Would I consider the Treehouse the
hip spot for Friday night dinner? Would I
only see movies at Flicks, where paper rocks
flew at my head and where I could barely
hear the lines over some big-shot's less
than-witty comments?
Worry not, my friends. It's my job and my
pleasure to dispel these fears, to open your
eyes to a whole new world of dining, shop
ping and social opportunities out there be
yond Palm Drive (magic carpet ride not in

eluded). Yes, we live on The Farm, but that in
no way means we have to stay in and milk the
cows every Saturday afternoon. Even Paris
Hilton and Nicole Ritchie got a day off once
in awhile.
So, now usually comes the complaint: "But
I've been on University Ave., and I can only go
to Starbucks and Pluto's so many times before
I turn into a large-farmer's-greens-salad-with
chicken." I know where you're coming from,
trust me. I've even been known to make that
comment myself. But instead of being single
street minded like the majority of students, I
spend my spare time exploring the nooks and
crannies of downtown PA.
Instead of reading my Introduction to the
Humanities book, I would stop in interesting
looking restaurants and read their menus. And
there's not just Palo Alto. "Whoa, don't get too
crazy now," you might say. but it's true. You've
got all of Mcnlo Park, Redwood City and
Mountain View at your wallet's disposal.
Granted, you need a car for these exotic lo
cales. but think about it. When were you ever
able to bike to your favorite cafe or movie the
ater at home?

Face it folks, Palo Alto is not the college
town that you dreamed about. The good stuff
is scattered, hidden and doesn't place coupons
in the Unofficial Guide to Stanford. That's

why I am here to give you the Unofficial Guide
to Get Out of Stanford.
Since I don't have enough space left to do

justice to many of the great finds of Stanford
adjacent, I will have to leave you with a little
teaser. It's called "Yumi Yogurt." Warning: If
you arc not a frozen yogurt fan, do not read on.
But if you love the stuff and can't deal with an
other foamy-textured flavor at @live, your life
just got a little better.
"Yumi Yogurt" is one of those places that
only gets discovered through word-of-mouth,
so in the past, students had to be lucky enough
to know the right people. That was the only
way to hear about Redwood City's hidden
treasure. But now you all know me.
So, the logistics: After it seems like
you've driven forever on El Camino going
north, just go a bit farther. Then give a little
cheer once you pass "Beverages and More"
because you're almost there. Located on
your right side just past "Tacos el Grul
lense," this little yogurt hut is home to the
creamiest, smoothest textured fro-yo that I
have ever tasted. Even the health-conscious
can indulge here: Most flavors are fat-free,
but I promise, you'd never notice if they
didn't tell you.
With mouth-watering flavors such as

Oreo Chcesecake, Chocolate Toffee, Peanut
Butter Cookies, Snickers and Pumpkin,
you'll never settle for plain chocolate again.
They don't skimp on the toppings either —
with such a wide variety you'll have to decide
between chocolate chip cookie dough pieces
or circus animal cookies. However, don't ex
pect to always see your favorite flavor on the
board — I once went there twice within
twenty-four hours and the whole yogurt line
up had changed.
Another word of caution: The portions
are really, really, really big. I'm not joking —
a large comes in a bucket, literally. So if you
ever have spare time to drive 15 minutes into
the shadier part of town, I promise Yumi is
worth it.
Until next week, go and explore the side
streets of Palo Alto yourself. You never know
what you may find.
v!> Yumi Yogurt is located at 947 El Camino
Real, in Redwood City.
