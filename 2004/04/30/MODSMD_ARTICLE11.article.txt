## Is pollution causing mass extinction? 
### 
II you thought our basketball season was intense,
get ready for March Madness on a mass extinction
scale. Right now, the score is 5-1, nature vs. humans.
By the time it takes for you to finish that econ prob
lem set, several species may have become extinct.
There's nothing new about this, over 99 percent of the

species that ever walked on Earth no
longer exist. As a tribute to Disney's
new DVD, the Lion King, it's the cir
cle of life playing out before our eyes.
Paleontologists have hypothesized
that five major extinctions have oc
curred on Earth, each one responsi
ble for the demise of thousands of
species. Two recent studies appear
ing in the journal Science, published
by American Association for the Ad
vancement of Science, even go so far
as to suggest that the world could be

experiencing another mass extinction.
The catch is this one is slightly different.
It is not asteroids and colder temperature shifts that
are to blame but pollution. Industry developments
have depleted nitrogen — an essential nutritious
source — from the soil, creating a fissure in species'
food webs. Scientists from the United Kingdom's Cen
tre for Ecology and Hydrology found that the United
Kingdom and Central Europe may have already lost 20
percent of their species to nitrogen deposition.
Even more frightening, according to a recent issue
of American Scientist magazine, is the fact that species
are becoming extinct at historical rates. The author of
the article. Dr. Donald A. Levin, a botany professor at
the University of Texas, claims that species extinction
is occurring about 100-1,000 times more than normal.
At this rate, he calculated that on average, species are
becoming extinct every 20 minutes!
Just last week, China announced its plan to launch a
moon rover in 2012, Japan's Toshiba Corporation
earned a Guinness World Record for creating the
world's smallest disk drive (the size of a stamp) and
farmers in St. Louis, Mo., have pooled together to pro
duce the first ready-to-eat beef in a can. At the same
time, scientists from the Mauna Loa Observatory in
Hawaii also announced record-high carbon dioxide
emission levels in the atmosphere.
Although not a direct consequence of the afore
mentioned events, pollution is an inevitable byproduct
of our progress. It seems we plow the globe with our
novelties in science, architecture, technology, and too
many other areas to list, at a cost — a very high cost. As
our population numbers and industrial developments
escalate, the living conditions of the Earth's flora and
fauna simultaneously decline. The question is, does our
ability to splice DNA. land on the moon and build im
pressive civilizations justify their destruction?
Perhaps it's no use comparing the value of a
macaque's habitat with Mendelssohn's string sym
phonies. Our achievements surpass the basic instinct of
survival into a desire for commodities. Therein, as
Gandhi once quoted, many of man's struggles deal not
with satisfying his needs, but his greed.
This is what sets us apart from other species: our
ability to exploit our surroundings by choice. The
Greek pantheons, Egyptian pyramids and even New
York's skyscrapers bear witness to a species that is
quite capable of converting natural resources and vir
gin land into almost anything. Now that we have ad
vanced farther than any other civilization on the tech
nological frontier, I think we have a duty to protect the
environment from further degradation.
Our current efforts to wash up the damage arc no
table, but they are not as effective. For example, even
after the establishment of the Endangered Species Act
in 1970 to protect threatened or endangered species,
animals keep on dying. The Tecopa pupfish, the blue
pike and the Santa Barbara song sparrow are examples
of species that have gone extinct in the United States
since the passage of the act. Birds in Kakamega Forest,
Kenya's only rainforest, are dying long after logging ac
tivities have stopped.
It is difficult to come up with feasible alternatives to
our planetary woes. Curbing industrial expansion and
reducing pollution emissions isn't going to work unless
we all work together. Make an effort to be more con
scientious about our environment and look ahead. Our
actions now, believe it or not, determine which species
will survive or forever disappear.
After the past five mass extinctions, scientists have
noted remarkable jump backs in species diversity.
There is still hope that species can and will flourish. All
it takes is assuming responsibility for our advance
ments and respecting the right to live of all animals,
great and small.
For our current bout over mass extinctions, I
wouldn't mind if nature takes the crown.

II you thought our basketball season was intense,
get ready for March Madness on a mass extinction
scale. Right now, the score is 5-1, nature vs. humans.
By the time it takes for you to finish that econ prob
lem set, several species may have become extinct.
There's nothing new about this, over 99 percent of the

species that ever walked on Earth no
longer exist. As a tribute to Disney's
new DVD, the Lion King, it's the cir
cle of life playing out before our eyes.
Paleontologists have hypothesized
that five major extinctions have oc
curred on Earth, each one responsi
ble for the demise of thousands of
species. Two recent studies appear
ing in the journal Science, published
by American Association for the Ad
vancement of Science, even go so far
as to suggest that the world could be

experiencing another mass extinction.
The catch is this one is slightly different.
It is not asteroids and colder temperature shifts that
are to blame but pollution. Industry developments
have depleted nitrogen — an essential nutritious
source — from the soil, creating a fissure in species'
food webs. Scientists from the United Kingdom's Cen
tre for Ecology and Hydrology found that the United
Kingdom and Central Europe may have already lost 20
percent of their species to nitrogen deposition.
Even more frightening, according to a recent issue
of American Scientist magazine, is the fact that species
are becoming extinct at historical rates. The author of
the article. Dr. Donald A. Levin, a botany professor at
the University of Texas, claims that species extinction
is occurring about 100-1,000 times more than normal.
At this rate, he calculated that on average, species are
becoming extinct every 20 minutes!
Just last week, China announced its plan to launch a
moon rover in 2012, Japan's Toshiba Corporation
earned a Guinness World Record for creating the
world's smallest disk drive (the size of a stamp) and
farmers in St. Louis, Mo., have pooled together to pro
duce the first ready-to-eat beef in a can. At the same
time, scientists from the Mauna Loa Observatory in
Hawaii also announced record-high carbon dioxide
emission levels in the atmosphere.
Although not a direct consequence of the afore
mentioned events, pollution is an inevitable byproduct
of our progress. It seems we plow the globe with our
novelties in science, architecture, technology, and too
many other areas to list, at a cost — a very high cost. As
our population numbers and industrial developments
escalate, the living conditions of the Earth's flora and
fauna simultaneously decline. The question is, does our
ability to splice DNA. land on the moon and build im
pressive civilizations justify their destruction?
Perhaps it's no use comparing the value of a
macaque's habitat with Mendelssohn's string sym
phonies. Our achievements surpass the basic instinct of
survival into a desire for commodities. Therein, as
Gandhi once quoted, many of man's struggles deal not
with satisfying his needs, but his greed.
This is what sets us apart from other species: our
ability to exploit our surroundings by choice. The
Greek pantheons, Egyptian pyramids and even New
York's skyscrapers bear witness to a species that is
quite capable of converting natural resources and vir
gin land into almost anything. Now that we have ad
vanced farther than any other civilization on the tech
nological frontier, I think we have a duty to protect the
environment from further degradation.
Our current efforts to wash up the damage arc no
table, but they are not as effective. For example, even
after the establishment of the Endangered Species Act
in 1970 to protect threatened or endangered species,
animals keep on dying. The Tecopa pupfish, the blue
pike and the Santa Barbara song sparrow are examples
of species that have gone extinct in the United States
since the passage of the act. Birds in Kakamega Forest,
Kenya's only rainforest, are dying long after logging ac
tivities have stopped.
It is difficult to come up with feasible alternatives to
our planetary woes. Curbing industrial expansion and
reducing pollution emissions isn't going to work unless
we all work together. Make an effort to be more con
scientious about our environment and look ahead. Our
actions now, believe it or not, determine which species
will survive or forever disappear.
After the past five mass extinctions, scientists have
noted remarkable jump backs in species diversity.
There is still hope that species can and will flourish. All
it takes is assuming responsibility for our advance
ments and respecting the right to live of all animals,
great and small.
For our current bout over mass extinctions, I
wouldn't mind if nature takes the crown.
