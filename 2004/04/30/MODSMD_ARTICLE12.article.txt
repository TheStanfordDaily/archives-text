# CUT THE CREATINE Special focus on men's health

High-protein diets, steroids, even natural sup
plements — they're all game for people trying to
attain the perfect physique. One of the most noto
rious performance-enhancing aids, creatine mono
hydrate, has become increasingly popular among
young males and has made an appearance on dorm
bookshelves between jars of "Whey Pumped" and
"Centrum" vitamins.
But while maker of creatine supplements are
now rolling in mone> and endorsements — includ
ing enthusiastic support from baseball player
Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs — this so-called
"natural" supplement hardly has received similar
positive reviews from nutritionists and researchers,
who suggest that the supplement may be the cause
of more hype than of muscle gain.
Creatine, a three-amino-acid chain, is natural
ly produced by the human liver and is found in
many animal products like meat and fish. Once
produced or ingested (whether in food or supple
ment form), it is stored in muscles as phosphocre
atine, a high-energy molecule that is essential for
maintaining chains of intense, short (less than 30
seconds) bursts of exercise; in fact it is this reput
ed trait that popularized it among sluggers like
Sosa and former St. Louis Cardinals first base
man Mark McGwire.
However, it is perhaps because of this associa
tion with these famous athletes that a common mis
perception has arisen, leading some to believe that
creatine helps people build muscle mass. In reality,
creatine has not been shown to build more muscle
mass or help men build muscle mass faster.
Creatine does initiate a temporary increase in
water retention, causing the user to gain one to
three additional pounds of water after ingestion.
Indeed, this effect caused Dr. Ronald L. Terjung —
who headed a panel on creatine use three years ago
sponsored by the American College of Sports
Medicine — to speculate that creatine users may
benefit derivatively from a placebo effect.
"They look like performers, so they feel like
performers," Terjung reported on WebMD, an on
line medical research resource. "They pushed
themselves to train a little harder, which made
them build real strength. It's conceivable there

might have been a placebo effect."
Placebo effect or not, creatine monohydrate —
the supplement form of creatine — has been at
tributed to causing various gastrointestinal side ef
fects. Common complaints include dehydration,
nausea, dizziness and cramping, especially when
taken immediately before exercise. While cases of
seHous side effects from creatine remain are un
common, an otherwise healthy 20-year-old man
was hospitalized for four days with acute interstitial
nephritis (kidney problems) after beginning a nor
mal daily dosage regimen. Official sports and mili
tary policies on creatine monohydrate, which has
not been approved by the Food and Drug Admin
istration, remain rare or non-existent.
Cardinal sports coaches do not support Stan
ford athletes' use of creatine, but there is no specif
ic policy.
Although some students use creatine, student
athletes reported that they did not feel pressured to
take sports supplements. Freshman Kirk Mc-
Connell, who plays on the Stanford water polo
team, said, "There's no pressure [for team mem
bers to take creatine], so it's not really an issue."
On the other hand, another male Stanford var
sity athlete, who asked not to be identified, admit
ted that he takes it "every now and then." He
added, "Creatine helps your endurance. If you're
an athlete who's training every day, it gets hard to
maintain that same level [of performance]."
Research does not in fact suggest that creatine
alters endurance; however, studies do imply that it
helps athletes recover faster after intense periods
of exercise.
Other students in high-pressure environments
where body physique is important may feel tempt
ed to take creatine, but according to James Liao, a
Stanford freshman in the Army Reserve Officer
Training Core (ROTC), Stanford members gener
ally choose not to.
"People take supplements, but I don't know
about [anyone who takes) creatine," Liao said.
He added that the situation is different, howev
er, for professional military troops: "I don't think
there's any official policy for students [in the
ROTC], but I know that for Navy Seals, if they
catch you with it on you, you get kicked out."
