# PARTNERS IN HEALTH: A conversation with Dr. Paul Farmer
## 
### LAUREN GONG GUEST COLUMNIST 
A conversation about HIV / AIDS pub
lic health work is not complete without
mentioning Dr. Paul Farmer, best known as
co-founder of the non-profit "Partners in
Health" and for his health work in rural
Haiti. Farmer spoke on campus this last
week at the Stanford for Haiti week at the
medical school. I caught this well-renowned
public health figure in between his power
packed schedule to learn a little more about
his work. In an Interview with The Daily,
Farmer commented on global health, cur
rent projects and provided advice for stu
dents who are interested in pursuing ca
reers in the health field.
The Daily: Why did you choose to focus
on Haiti?
Paul Farmer: I had worked with migrant
farm workers — well, not really worked
with migrant farm workers — but I had
been interested in and writing about [farm
workers] as an undergraduate and I met
quite a few Haitians. They were living
under very difficult circumstances and I was
curious as to why they would leave their
home country to come and work in very
poor conditions, so I asked one of the
Haitians just that question. And he said
"Well, have you ever been to Haiti?" And I
said no. So he said, "Well, you should go and
[then] you can ask me again."

Then I went to Haiti and never left. I'm
still working in the same place. In fact, I
still live in the same village I went to in May
of 1983.
TI): What keeps you there?
PF: Now I'm a doctor, and there is just a
huge burden of disease there ... If I got run
over by a truck, the quality of medical care
in Boston, [where I live,] is not going to suf
fer ... I find it very compelling work.
TD: What do you see as a realistic approach
to solving these major global health crises?
What do you think needs the most attention
right now?
PF: Any pragmatic engagement is necessar
ily realistic. [When] you are involved in a
project that takes on global health inequal
ities. it will be realistic based on definition.
Policy can be unrealistic, but projects them
selves tend to be grounded in the everyday
concerns of patients. I just get back to these
first principles of identifying the problem...
[then] being persistent and humble about it.
People say it is not realistic to treat AIDS in
Haiti and Milawi, and you just show that
[way of thinking] to be faulty by doing it.
TI): Zanmi Lasante, the sister organization
of "Partners in Health" (which have both
run programs such as a full-service hospital,
HIV / TB Treatment facilities, a women's
health center, schools and cottage indus
tries) has proven to be a great success in
Haiti. Do you think it is something that can

be replicated to raise the standard of living
in other developing countries?
PF: Sure I do. [Zanmi Lasante] required a
ton of sweat equity and a lot of resources,
but if you can do it in rural Haiti, you can do
it anywhere else. A lot of people who were
formerly unemployed [near my clinic] are
now working in the health care sector so I
think that's good, too.
Tl>: What are some of the obstacles you
faced when creating Zanmi Lasante?
PF: No money, no resources. You have to
have resources to do all of the good will in
the world. If someone is a diabetic and they
don't have insulin, all of the good will in the
world will not be that important if insulin
isn't in the equation.
TI): Right now you have to maintain a bal
ance between being a professor at Har
vard, traveling between Haiti and here
and your other work. How do you main
tain that balance?
PF: Barely. It is very hard. The real answer
is that 1 work with a lot of great people who
are committed to the work. You can only do
this kind of work in teams, right? In Haiti
[for example), if the success of the project
was dependent on my presence, then I
couldn't be here at Stanford.
TI): Do you have any advice for students
who are looking to get involved or who are
looking to promote awareness here on a
college campus?

PF: I would say, be persistent and be hum
ble. I see students who say "I can't get into
this work" or "I don't see a way." But
you're not going to have a prepackaged
form of engagement with some of the
poorest populations in the world. Stu
dents have to make an investment in
shaping those experiences.
I think it's just very difficult work. There
are a lot of disappointments in it and a lot of
defeats which engenders a welcome humil
ity. It's better to be humble if you are in
this line of work, rather than being arro
gant about [the fact that) your prospects
are to change the world or make every
body better.
Another thing I would say is that when
you're a student, your job is to learn and to
study, and I think students should do that...
Don't give up this great time in your life in
order to do something else.
At the same time, there's a way to be
an activist and a way to be engaged in this
stuff even when you're far away from
Haiti or Africa or Oakland — even when
you're in a sanctuary like Stanford. There
are all sorts of challenges close by and far
away, and finding a little bit of time to be
involved in these challenges, I think, is a
good thing.

PF: I would say, be persistent and be hum
ble. I see students who say "I can't get into
this work" or "I don't see a way." But
you're not going to have a prepackaged
form of engagement with some of the
poorest populations in the world. Stu
dents have to make an investment in
shaping those experiences.
I think it's just very difficult work. There
are a lot of disappointments in it and a lot of
defeats which engenders a welcome humil
ity. It's better to be humble if you are in
this line of work, rather than being arro
gant about [the fact that) your prospects
are to change the world or make every
body better.
Another thing I would say is that when
you're a student, your job is to learn and to
study, and I think students should do that...
Don't give up this great time in your life in
order to do something else.
At the same time, there's a way to be
an activist and a way to be engaged in this
stuff even when you're far away from
Haiti or Africa or Oakland — even when
you're in a sanctuary like Stanford. There
are all sorts of challenges close by and far
away, and finding a little bit of time to be
involved in these challenges, I think, is a
good thing.

A conversation about HIV / AIDS pub
lic health work is not complete without
mentioning Dr. Paul Farmer, best known as
co-founder of the non-profit "Partners in
Health" and for his health work in rural
Haiti. Farmer spoke on campus this last
week at the Stanford for Haiti week at the
medical school. I caught this well-renowned
public health figure in between his power
packed schedule to learn a little more about
his work. In an Interview with The Daily,
Farmer commented on global health, cur
rent projects and provided advice for stu
dents who are interested in pursuing ca
reers in the health field.
The Daily: Why did you choose to focus
on Haiti?
Paul Farmer: I had worked with migrant
farm workers — well, not really worked
with migrant farm workers — but I had
been interested in and writing about [farm
workers] as an undergraduate and I met
quite a few Haitians. They were living
under very difficult circumstances and I was
curious as to why they would leave their
home country to come and work in very
poor conditions, so I asked one of the
Haitians just that question. And he said
"Well, have you ever been to Haiti?" And I
said no. So he said, "Well, you should go and
[then] you can ask me again."

Then I went to Haiti and never left. I'm
still working in the same place. In fact, I
still live in the same village I went to in May
of 1983.
TI): What keeps you there?
PF: Now I'm a doctor, and there is just a
huge burden of disease there ... If I got run
over by a truck, the quality of medical care
in Boston, [where I live,] is not going to suf
fer ... I find it very compelling work.
TD: What do you see as a realistic approach
to solving these major global health crises?
What do you think needs the most attention
right now?
PF: Any pragmatic engagement is necessar
ily realistic. [When] you are involved in a
project that takes on global health inequal
ities. it will be realistic based on definition.
Policy can be unrealistic, but projects them
selves tend to be grounded in the everyday
concerns of patients. I just get back to these
first principles of identifying the problem...
[then] being persistent and humble about it.
People say it is not realistic to treat AIDS in
Haiti and Milawi, and you just show that
[way of thinking] to be faulty by doing it.
TI): Zanmi Lasante, the sister organization
of "Partners in Health" (which have both
run programs such as a full-service hospital,
HIV / TB Treatment facilities, a women's
health center, schools and cottage indus
tries) has proven to be a great success in
Haiti. Do you think it is something that can

be replicated to raise the standard of living
in other developing countries?
PF: Sure I do. [Zanmi Lasante] required a
ton of sweat equity and a lot of resources,
but if you can do it in rural Haiti, you can do
it anywhere else. A lot of people who were
formerly unemployed [near my clinic] are
now working in the health care sector so I
think that's good, too.
Tl>: What are some of the obstacles you
faced when creating Zanmi Lasante?
PF: No money, no resources. You have to
have resources to do all of the good will in
the world. If someone is a diabetic and they
don't have insulin, all of the good will in the
world will not be that important if insulin
isn't in the equation.
TI): Right now you have to maintain a bal
ance between being a professor at Har
vard, traveling between Haiti and here
and your other work. How do you main
tain that balance?
PF: Barely. It is very hard. The real answer
is that 1 work with a lot of great people who
are committed to the work. You can only do
this kind of work in teams, right? In Haiti
[for example), if the success of the project
was dependent on my presence, then I
couldn't be here at Stanford.
TI): Do you have any advice for students
who are looking to get involved or who are
looking to promote awareness here on a
college campus?

PF: I would say, be persistent and be hum
ble. I see students who say "I can't get into
this work" or "I don't see a way." But
