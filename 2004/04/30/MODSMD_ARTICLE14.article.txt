# We got the beat
## iTunes brings new music to Stanford 
### MOHAMMED ABDOOLCARIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There is a new tune in town. Walking
down White Plaza, you might notice a few
people wearing sleek white earplugs connect
ed to a cable that disappears mysteriously
into their pocket. Another MP3 player with
trendy earplugs? Not quite; it's the new iPod
from Apple.
The iPod has become the hottest music
device to listen to. It comes in several models
including 15,20 and 40 gigabytes, each enough
to store your entire collection of MP3's.
"The iPod has an even bigger hard-drive
than my computer," said Krista Niles, a junior
majoring in English. Niles is "an avid Apple

fan" and bought both an Apple powerbook
and an iPod.
Compared to other MP3 players, stu
dents have noted better features with the
iPod. Tory Stewart, a junior majoring in Inter
disciplinary Studies in Humanities, found her
new i Pod to be very portable.
"It fits in everything and I can take it
anywhere," she said. "I listen to music in
between classes and even up to the point
when the professor starts talking and I am
forced to turn it off."
Niles emphasized the iPod's special fea
tures. One of these is the random play feature,
which picks "the right song at the right time."
"It seems to know exactly what I want to
hear," Niles said.
Actually, this happens partly because the
iPod software has an algorithm that remem
bers the number of times a user plays
a song.
Stewart said she takes her iPod every
where, including biking and studying, though
claimed that she keeps the volume down so
she can hear the traffic when biking.
Students said the iPod was also worth
while on long drives. Both Stewart and Niles
have used their iPods on several occasions
during road trips. Apple advertises the iPod as
having many other functions.
David Fedor, an undeclared sophomore,

used his iPod when doing his weekly house
chores at Hammarskjold. He plugged his play
er into the radio to play his favorite music as
he was cleaning the dishes.
The downsides of iPod? For Victor
Wong, a fifth-year senior double-majoring in
Computer Science and Economics, it is the
price. "At $3(X) a pop, it simply isn't worth it."
He said he will not buy one until finding more
functionality and the possibility of combining
the iPod with his phone and camera.
Ashni Mohnot, a junior majoring in an
English, said she would also not buy the iPod.
Despite finding the iPod "sleek and sexy" she
said she "[didn't] really care too much."
Marika Knowles, a senior majoring in
English, also said she would not buy the
iPod because she did not have enough
music to make the purchase worth it. She
said nevertheless she found the iPod "very
aesthetically pleasing."
"The iPod is a cool way to organize music
packed into a cute white box and can make my
music more savvy," Knowles said.
What do those people with sleek white
plugs walking on White Plaza want in the next
iPod? "More cool colors like the iMac," Stew
art said.
