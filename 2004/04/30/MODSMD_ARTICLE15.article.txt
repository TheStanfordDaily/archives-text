# Delicious and good for you?
## The
						health benefits of chocolate 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Americans consume an average of 12
pounds of the sweet treat — from rich, dark
chocolate to milk chocolate M&Ms — each
year. Although most people need few excuses
to snack on a chocolate bar, researchers at the
National Academy of Sciences may give some
an extra incentive to indulge. Scientists dis
cussed the possible health benefits of choco
late at an all-day conference this past Tues
day, including the possible protective benefits
to cardiovascular and immunological health.
Chocolate contains special plant chemi
cals known as flavonoids — a complex group
of molecules also found in plant-derived
foods such as red wine, blueberries and tea —
that may protect you from free radicals
(byproducts of normal metabolic processes
that harm cells) and may protect your heart or
lower your risk of cancer. Researchers at UC-
Davis School of Medicine have found that
flavonoids may help relax the inner surface of
blood vessels by promoting the release of ni
tric oxide, and thus possibly lower blood pres
sure and prevent the rupture of coronary
plaques. Additionally, other DC-Davis scien
tists have found that compounds in chocolate
may act as anti-coagulants, guard against fatal

blood clots and
offer the same
type of protec
tion as a baby
aspirin.
A 40-gram
piece of milk

chocolate contains about 400 milligrams of
antioxidants; dark chocolate may have twice
that amount. Although studies have shown
that most chocolate products contain antioxi
dants, the presence of these beneficial chemi
cal compounds depends on the variety, pro
cessing and storage of the chocolate. While
the current research is promising, many stud
ies have been funded by candy companies
such as Mars and Dove and have included
only small sample sizes, limiting the strength
of their results.
Norman K. Hollenberg of Harvard Medi
cal School doesn't believe we should consume
any more [chocolate] than we currently do. In
an interview with CNN, Hollenberg ex
plained: "The issue [today] isn't should we or
should we not be recommending chocolate,
only that people should not feel guilty about
eating it."
