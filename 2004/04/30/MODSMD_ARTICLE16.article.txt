# THE 						BEST OF INTERMISSION
## Intermission interviews one of the sexiest men alive 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
There's something about Ben Affleck. Maybe it's the undeniable
sex appeal. Maybe it's the never-ending romance rumors. Maybe it's
the charming charisma.
Whatever it is, that je ne se quai keeps audiences clamoring
for more.
After co-writing "Good Will Hunting" with childhood pal Matt
Damon, tearing up the movie screen with blockbusters like "Ar
mageddon" and producing the reality television series "Project
Greenlight," it would seem Affleck is more than just another pretty
face. But how does Ben Affleck truly see himself?
"/ think I see myself as somebody who is not totally limited to doing
any of those things, and I am a product of a kind of a time in movies
when a lot of those boundaries were kind of being broken down and
guys like Kevin Smith were sort of doing all these different things in all
these different ways and so it did not seem that unusual for me to take
on a bunch of different roles.
"/ was an actor when I was child so I always sort of think of myself
as an actor, but it is something that I sort of feel like I want to graduate
from for some odd reason. I am not sure if that is rational or if that is my
own insecurity or the fact that I did not graduate, for example, from col
lege so I am just yearning to graduate from somewhere. But that is how
I feel right now."
Affleck's latest role casts him as Michael Jennings, a reverse engi
neer, in the psychological action film "Paycheck." Based on a short
story by Philip K. Dick, who also inspired "Blade Runner" and "Mi
nority Report." and under the direction of John Woo ("MI:2"), Af
fleck considered it a winning combination.
"/ am a huge fan of science fiction in general and Philip K. Dick in
particular, and an enormous fan of John Woo. So it really made the de
cision {to do the film] quite easy...
"I had not read Paycheck' actually until I got the script and 1
thought, ' This is really smart. It is sort of unusually smart for a Holly
wood blockbuster type movie..
"I think I was really excited that you had the combination of a visu
al kind of stylist like John Woo with a really strong story from Philip K.
Dick. It seemed like a real no-brainer to me to do the movie."
One of the perks of working with director John Woo, known for his
characteristic action sequences such as the slow-motion motorcycle
light scene in "Mission Impossible 2," was the chance to do some real
stunt-work. "Paycheck" afforded Affleck the opportunity to bring his
love of motorcycle-riding to the big screen. But did he really do all his
own stunts?
"And if you didn 't why are you such a pussy? Yes, I did some and I
did not do others. What keeps you from doing them is that the insurance
people kind of will not let you to a certain extent. I just think as an actor
it is your job. You should do as much of it as they will let you do. It also
looks better and works better for the movie. Sometimes a stuntman can
be really obvious and it takes me out of the movie and it is hard to sus
pend belief when all of a sudden there is the guy with the bad wig on who
is like flying behind the boat or whatever he is doing. So I think I have
tried to do as much as I possibly can.
"/ think it makes the movie better. When I did not it was because they
said, 'No.' John was very protective and sometimes he would sort of
stop me from trying to do stuff. But I was pretty game to do as much as
I could."
With "Paycheck" in theaters now, what is next for Ben Affleck?
First, a Kevin Smith ("Clerks," "Dogma") film, "Jersey Girl," which
will be released March 19.
"/loved the movie. I think it is easily Kevin Smith s best movie. It is
probably my favorite movie I have ever been in and I just think it is
great. One of the reasons why I did not sweat the sort of cataclysmic dis
astrous reception of 'Gigli' was because I really knew that I had some

thing great coming out. I have that to look forward to and that is a movie
that I am enormously proud of."
And then what? Would he consider reuniting with Matt Damon on
future projects?
"/ would like to collaborate again with Matt Damon. We wrote
'Good Will Hunting' to get ourselves work as actors and so it sort of ful
filled that g0a1... You know, it's like, when we were younger, in our
early 20s it was like all gravy. We all hung around with all of our
friends when we were out of work and then everybody went off and,
like, got jobs and work, and it is harder to see your friends unless you
work with them.
"/ want to write another script with Matt and I look forward to doing
that maybe some time towards the middle of this year, and I would like
to direct it. That is sort of the next evolution. Ultimately I would rather
be I think focusing more on writing and hopefully directing than on act
ing as time goes on."
With "Paycheck" grossing $38.6 million so far, it would seem
Affleck is at the top of his game. But does he have any regrets?
"Gigli" maybe?
"/ do not regret 'Gigli' at all. Actually, for one thing, I made a rela
tionship during that movie that was really important to me and that is
more important than my career. Second of all, 'Gigli' was a real impor
tant movie for me because it was a really risky rote to take on. Since you
take a big risk, you fail. That is sort of inherent in the nature of taking
risks, but it has let me know that I was still taking chances and being
brave and not just sort of, like, doing the same middle of the road type
of stuff, and I also think I really grew a lot as an actor.
"But, you know, I have very few regrets. I regret in some ways that
Jen and I were so available in our relationship in kind of the early stages

when we were just getting to
gether that we were kind of
open about it, and I think that
story sort of metastasized and

took on a life of its own tluiM

then turned around to be sort <>m
mutated and corrupted and not
right. That was sort of disap-

pointing, but again, it is not like I
am not going to make choices in

There's something about Ben Affleck. Maybe it's the undeniable
sex appeal. Maybe it's the never-ending romance rumors. Maybe it's
the charming charisma.
Whatever it is, that je ne se quai keeps audiences clamoring
for more.
After co-writing "Good Will Hunting" with childhood pal Matt
Damon, tearing up the movie screen with blockbusters like "Ar
mageddon" and producing the reality television series "Project
Greenlight," it would seem Affleck is more than just another pretty
face. But how does Ben Affleck truly see himself?
"/ think I see myself as somebody who is not totally limited to doing
any of those things, and I am a product of a kind of a time in movies
when a lot of those boundaries were kind of being broken down and
guys like Kevin Smith were sort of doing all these different things in all
these different ways and so it did not seem that unusual for me to take
on a bunch of different roles.
"/ was an actor when I was child so I always sort of think of myself
as an actor, but it is something that I sort of feel like I want to graduate
from for some odd reason. I am not sure if that is rational or if that is my
own insecurity or the fact that I did not graduate, for example, from col
lege so I am just yearning to graduate from somewhere. But that is how
I feel right now."
Affleck's latest role casts him as Michael Jennings, a reverse engi
neer, in the psychological action film "Paycheck." Based on a short
story by Philip K. Dick, who also inspired "Blade Runner" and "Mi
nority Report." and under the direction of John Woo ("MI:2"), Af
fleck considered it a winning combination.
"/ am a huge fan of science fiction in general and Philip K. Dick in
particular, and an enormous fan of John Woo. So it really made the de
cision {to do the film] quite easy...
"I had not read Paycheck' actually until I got the script and 1
thought, ' This is really smart. It is sort of unusually smart for a Holly
wood blockbuster type movie..
"I think I was really excited that you had the combination of a visu
al kind of stylist like John Woo with a really strong story from Philip K.
Dick. It seemed like a real no-brainer to me to do the movie."
One of the perks of working with director John Woo, known for his
characteristic action sequences such as the slow-motion motorcycle
light scene in "Mission Impossible 2," was the chance to do some real
stunt-work. "Paycheck" afforded Affleck the opportunity to bring his
love of motorcycle-riding to the big screen. But did he really do all his
own stunts?
"And if you didn 't why are you such a pussy? Yes, I did some and I
did not do others. What keeps you from doing them is that the insurance
people kind of will not let you to a certain extent. I just think as an actor
it is your job. You should do as much of it as they will let you do. It also
looks better and works better for the movie. Sometimes a stuntman can
be really obvious and it takes me out of the movie and it is hard to sus
pend belief when all of a sudden there is the guy with the bad wig on who
is like flying behind the boat or whatever he is doing. So I think I have
tried to do as much as I possibly can.
"/ think it makes the movie better. When I did not it was because they
said, 'No.' John was very protective and sometimes he would sort of
stop me from trying to do stuff. But I was pretty game to do as much as
I could."
With "Paycheck" in theaters now, what is next for Ben Affleck?
First, a Kevin Smith ("Clerks," "Dogma") film, "Jersey Girl," which
will be released March 19.
"/loved the movie. I think it is easily Kevin Smith s best movie. It is
probably my favorite movie I have ever been in and I just think it is
great. One of the reasons why I did not sweat the sort of cataclysmic dis
astrous reception of 'Gigli' was because I really knew that I had some

thing great coming out. I have that to look forward to and that is a movie
that I am enormously proud of."
And then what? Would he consider reuniting with Matt Damon on
future projects?
"/ would like to collaborate again with Matt Damon. We wrote
'Good Will Hunting' to get ourselves work as actors and so it sort of ful
filled that g0a1... You know, it's like, when we were younger, in our
early 20s it was like all gravy. We all hung around with all of our
friends when we were out of work and then everybody went off and,
like, got jobs and work, and it is harder to see your friends unless you
work with them.
"/ want to write another script with Matt and I look forward to doing
that maybe some time towards the middle of this year, and I would like
to direct it. That is sort of the next evolution. Ultimately I would rather
be I think focusing more on writing and hopefully directing than on act
ing as time goes on."
With "Paycheck" grossing $38.6 million so far, it would seem
Affleck is at the top of his game. But does he have any regrets?
"Gigli" maybe?
"/ do not regret 'Gigli' at all. Actually, for one thing, I made a rela
tionship during that movie that was really important to me and that is
more important than my career. Second of all, 'Gigli' was a real impor
tant movie for me because it was a really risky rote to take on. Since you
take a big risk, you fail. That is sort of inherent in the nature of taking
risks, but it has let me know that I was still taking chances and being
brave and not just sort of, like, doing the same middle of the road type
of stuff, and I also think I really grew a lot as an actor.
"But, you know, I have very few regrets. I regret in some ways that
Jen and I were so available in our relationship in kind of the early stages

when we were just getting to
gether that we were kind of
open about it, and I think that
story sort of metastasized and

took on a life of its own tluiM

then turned around to be sort <>m
mutated and corrupted and not
right. That was sort of disap-

pointing, but again, it is not like I
am not going to make choices in
my life predicated because I

am afraid they will be

damaging to my

career because I
think that is a .

fast track to
selling your
soul
anyway."

lege so I am just yearning to graduate from somewhere. But that is how
I feel right now."
Affleck's latest role casts him as Michael Jennings, a reverse engi
neer, in the psychological action film "Paycheck." Based on a short
story by Philip K. Dick, who also inspired "Blade Runner" and "Mi
nority Report." and under the direction of John Woo ("MI:2"), Af
fleck considered it a winning combination.
"/ am a huge fan of science fiction in general and Philip K. Dick in
particular, and an enormous fan of John Woo. So it really made the de
cision {to do the film] quite easy...
"I had not read Paycheck' actually until I got the script and 1
thought, ' This is really smart. It is sort of unusually smart for a Holly
wood blockbuster type movie..
"I think I was really excited that you had the combination of a visu
al kind of stylist like John Woo with a really strong story from Philip K.
Dick. It seemed like a real no-brainer to me to do the movie."
One of the perks of working with director John Woo, known for his
characteristic action sequences such as the slow-motion motorcycle
light scene in "Mission Impossible 2," was the chance to do some real
stunt-work. "Paycheck" afforded Affleck the opportunity to bring his
love of motorcycle-riding to the big screen. But did he really do all his
own stunts?
"And if you didn 't why are you such a pussy? Yes, I did some and I
did not do others. What keeps you from doing them is that the insurance
people kind of will not let you to a certain extent. I just think as an actor
it is your job. You should do as much of it as they will let you do. It also
looks better and works better for the movie. Sometimes a stuntman can
be really obvious and it takes me out of the movie and it is hard to sus
pend belief when all of a sudden there is the guy with the bad wig on who
is like flying behind the boat or whatever he is doing. So I think I have
tried to do as much as I possibly can.
"/ think it makes the movie better. When I did not it was because they
said, 'No.' John was very protective and sometimes he would sort of
stop me from trying to do stuff. But I was pretty game to do as much as
I could."
With "Paycheck" in theaters now, what is next for Ben Affleck?
First, a Kevin Smith ("Clerks," "Dogma") film, "Jersey Girl," which
will be released March 19.
"/loved the movie. I think it is easily Kevin Smith s best movie. It is
probably my favorite movie I have ever been in and I just think it is
great. One of the reasons why I did not sweat the sort of cataclysmic dis
astrous reception of 'Gigli' was because I really knew that I had some

thing great coming out. I have that to look forward to and that is a movie
that I am enormously proud of."
And then what? Would he consider reuniting with Matt Damon on
future projects?
"/ would like to collaborate again with Matt Damon. We wrote
'Good Will Hunting' to get ourselves work as actors and so it sort of ful
filled that g0a1... You know, it's like, when we were younger, in our
early 20s it was like all gravy. We all hung around with all of our
friends when we were out of work and then everybody went off and,
like, got jobs and work, and it is harder to see your friends unless you
work with them.
"/ want to write another script with Matt and I look forward to doing
that maybe some time towards the middle of this year, and I would like
to direct it. That is sort of the next evolution. Ultimately I would rather
be I think focusing more on writing and hopefully directing than on act
ing as time goes on."
With "Paycheck" grossing $38.6 million so far, it would seem
Affleck is at the top of his game. But does he have any regrets?
"Gigli" maybe?
"/ do not regret 'Gigli' at all. Actually, for one thing, I made a rela

more important than my career. Second of all, 'Gigli' was a real impor
tant movie for me because it was a really risky rote to take on. Since you
take a big risk, you fail. That is sort of inherent in the nature of taking

brave and not just sort of, like, doing the same middle of the road type

There's something about Ben Affleck. Maybe it's the undeniable
sex appeal. Maybe it's the never-ending romance rumors. Maybe it's
the charming charisma.
Whatever it is, that je ne se quai keeps audiences clamoring
for more.
After co-writing "Good Will Hunting" with childhood pal Matt
Damon, tearing up the movie screen with blockbusters like "Ar
mageddon" and producing the reality television series "Project
Greenlight," it would seem Affleck is more than just another pretty
face. But how does Ben Affleck truly see himself?
"/ think I see myself as somebody who is not totally limited to doing
any of those things, and I am a product of a kind of a time in movies
when a lot of those boundaries were kind of being broken down and
guys like Kevin Smith were sort of doing all these different things in all
these different ways and so it did not seem that unusual for me to take
on a bunch of different roles.
"/ was an actor when I was child so I always sort of think of myself
as an actor, but it is something that I sort of feel like I want to graduate
from for some odd reason. I am not sure if that is rational or if that is my
own insecurity or the fact that I did not graduate, for example, from col
lege so I am just yearning to graduate from somewhere. But that is how
I feel right now."

dents, delivering speeches and gathering re
search for a novel. The trademark white
suit-wearing author, who won the American
book award in 1979 for"The Right Stuff."

speak heartily on the subject of journalism
during his stay at Stanford.
Raymond Carver —"What We Talk

Love," "Cathedral," "Where I'm
Calling From": Best known for his
poetry and short stories. Carver received a

Quiet, Please?" in 1974, Carver was living in
Palo Alto and teaching at UC-Berkeley.
Citing novels such as "Swiss Family
Robinson," and "Frankenstein" as child
hood favorites. Carver grew up to delve into
the over-arching topics of life, love and phi
losophy. Frequently referred to as a "mini

malist master," Carver accomplished the
supremely difficult task of capturing a deep
and meaningful feeling in only a few lines,
displayed most notably in "What We Talk
About When We Talk About Love: Sto
ries." The Sunday Times christened him
"The American Chekhov."

which went on to win the Pulitzer in 1972. As
a prominent western author — loyal to Cal
ifornia — "Angle of Repose" was not re
viewed by The New York Times, in what
was thought to be a brush-off by the eastern
elite. The Stegner Fellowship offered
through the Creative Writing Department
today bears his name.
Larry McMurtry — "Lonesome
Dove," "Terms of Endearment":
A few years after his Stegner fel
lowship from 1960-61 at Stanford,

his experiences as a cowhand to add realism
to his prolific works.

gree in English from Stanford,
Cunningham published a num
ber of articles in magazines such as The
New Yorker and Vogue before also gain

and Meryl Streep.
Vikram Seth — "The Golden
Gate," "A Suitable Boy": Prolif
ic Indian author and poet
Vikram Seth was trained as an
economist at Stanford spending, in his own
words, "11 years [from 1975 to 1986] not
getting an economics doctorate." He took a
year's leave from the economics depart
ment in 1977-78 on a Stegner fellowship
and his journeys in Tibet and China (where
he continued research for his doctoral de
gree at Nanjing University in 1981) served
as a basis for the award-winning travelogue
"From Heaven Lake."
Seth's body of work includes the"The
Golden Gate: A Novel in Verse," praised by
Gore Vidal as "the great California novel" 1
and "A Suitable Boy," the longest novel in
the English language. This epic work about
a family in 1950s India won the W.H. Smith
Literary Award and the Commonwealth
Writers Prize, establishing Seth as a writer of
international repute.
