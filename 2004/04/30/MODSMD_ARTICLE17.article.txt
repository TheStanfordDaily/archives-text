# NOBEL LAUREATE AT S'FORD John M. Coetzee
## 
### ERIN LASHNITS INTERMISSION WRITER 
Of all the obscure facts of John M. Co
etzee's life, probably the least known is
how to correctly pronounce his last name.
For some, it rhymes with tootsie, for oth
ers it's closer to gutsy and here at Stanford
we've added a third syllable for an overall
effect that approximates the second half
of anesthesia spoken like a Brit with a
nasty head cold.
Besides an unpronounceable last
name, Coetzee is also known for his liter
ary scholarship, essays and novels. Her
alded as one of the greatest living writers,
Coetzee won the 2003 Nobel Prize in Lit
erature and is one of only two people to
ever win the Booker Prize, Britain's most
prestigious fiction honor, twice. Most re
cently, Coetzee is appearing as Stanford's
Isaac and Madeline Stein Visiting Writer.
Coetzee was born and raised in Cape
Town. South Africa, of mixed Boer and
English descent. In the 19605, he moved
to England to take a job as a computer
programmer before coming to the Unit
ed States to study literature at the Uni
versity of Texas at Austin. While he
made his literary debut in 1974 with
"Dusklands," which contained two
novellas, it was not until 1980 that he
found international success with his
novel "Waiting for the Barbarians." Co
etzee has subsequently taught English
and English literature at universities
around the U.S. as well as the Universi
ty of Cape Town and the University of
Adelaide, Australia, and has since pub
lished eight novels, a number of critical

essays and two memoirs. He last came to
Stanford as a visiting professor of En
glish in 2002, and now returns to teach
creative writing.
In a reading from his work on
Wednesday, Coetzee treated the stand
ing room only audience at Kresge Audi
torium to a never before heard excerpt
from a work in progress, as well as a
reading of one of his lesser known sto
ries "A House in Spain," which was
originally published in the Architectural
Digest in 20(H).
A formidable figure in his nicely tai
lored charcoal suit and tasteful charcoal

tie, glasses slipping halfway down his long
nose, Coetzee began by reminding the
crowd that while it was enjoyable to hear
a well known story read by the author as
he intended it, it was perhaps more excit
ing to listen to a new, unpublished work in
progress. The excerpt he read from in
cluded the title character of his most re
cent novel, "Elizabeth Costello," in a dif
ferent and less prominent role.
While he spoke slowly, almost reluc
tantly in introduction and transition be
tween the two pieces, with the first sen
tence of reading his voice took on a deep
melody, with the undertone of a smirk as
though he was imparting a not-quite-so
secret secret to the audience. A hint of
irony made its way to the surface in both
pieces, drawing chuckles from the crowd
with one sentence while dropping the last
trace of a smile from each person's face
with the next.
The excerpt from Coetzee's work in
progress revealed some of the most com
mon themes of his work, simultaneously
delighting in and criticizing the absurdity
of people's desires and the lengths to
which they will go to fulfill them. With su
perb control of language and tone, Coet
zee managed to personify the cruelty of
individual vanity and the tension inherent
in public exhibition of private insecurities
using the almost farcical setup of two un
likely characters.
Coetzee's next reading will be a collo
quium open to the general public on May
12 in the Terrace Room of Margaret
Jacks Hall.

Ah, the poignant gaze of a sensitive artist.
The proof is in the white facial hair.
