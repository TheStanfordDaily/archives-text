# Roble/Weekend Party Snooper
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN SUPER SNOOPER EXTRAORDINAIRE 
"We might have met, hut I'm always drunk."
— A chesthair-revealing, white-sliirted, tall junior,
bespectacled in snazzy rainbow-tinted sunglasses
(even while inside).
"Well, at the very least, she
should have been ugly."
— Girl wearing an astonishing amount of pink
(her sweater, shirt and even sandals were the hue
of a freshly gutted salmon).
"I think they should turn the lights out right now,
because at the end of the night people just
aren't looking their best."
— Girl with a tasteful red, white and green-striped
shirt at 1:50 a.m.
"I can't find my bra."
— Girl no. 1, in the shower stall in the girl's
bathroom at SlavDom
"I found mine, but I don't think I'm gonna
wear it anymore."
— Girl no. 2, running around the bathroom topless
"One of my buddies in my dorm was kind of into
her, so 1 let him take over."
— Guy in button-up blue dress shirt and tie,
standing in front of entrance.

Overheard at the Roble party last Saturday:
"I don't want to be, like, a clingy person. 1 saw
Eric — but I don't want to be clingy."
— Asian girl in the hallway, wearing black skirt,
flower print shirt and high heels.
"Who the fuck is Chris Ayer? Does
he go to this school?"
— Tall (6'2") Indian guy in blue shirt,
upon seeing a poster for Chris Ayer's
performance, at that time
in progress in the basement.
"Guys like the 'sucky-sucky.' "
(Said with air quotes.)
— Girl in jeans, black shirt and blue bead neck
lace, to a gaggle of her friends.
"Dude, I'm fucking tired."
— Girl being carried by Asian guy.
"YOU'RE tired?!"
— Incredulous Asian guy, in a jersey and
white sneakers, carrying girl.
