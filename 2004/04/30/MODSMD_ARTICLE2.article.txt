### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
Sandra Day O'Connor, the first female U.S. Supreme
Court Justice and a Stanford alumna, will speak at the 2004
Commencement, Stanford's Senior Class presidents an
nounced on March 9.
"Justice O'Connor received resounding support from
the Senior Class through our nomination process, and we
are absolutely thrilled that she has accepted our invita
tion," the Senior Class presidents said in a written state
ment. "She brings insight and perspective to the Universi
ty community through her experiences as both an under
graduate and graduate student at Stanford. Her life story
— one of courage and integrity in the face of challenges —
provides inspiration to our class as we approach Com
mencement. We are honored and privileged that she will
share this milestone with us."
O'Connor graduated from Stanford magna cum laude
with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1950 and earned her
law degree from Stanford in 1952, finishing third in her class.
Since her appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1981,
she has written crucial judicial opinions on some of the most
contentious political issues of the past two decades.
Senior Class Presidents Mary Himinkool, Mikey Lee
and Ryan Taylor recommended O'Connor to University
President John Hennessy.
"I am extremely pleased and proud to accept the rec
ommendation of the class presidents," Hennessy told
the Stanford News Service. "By suggesting Justice
O'Connor, the Senior Class recognized not only her
role as a central figure in contemporary U.S. history,
they have chosen someone who has deep ties to Stan
ford on an intellectual and personal level. I know that
her reflections will have special meaning for our gradu
ates, and I look forward with great anticipation to hear
ing her speak."
O'Connor graduated from the Stanford Law School in
the same class as U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Wiliam
Rehnquist, who graduated first in the class. She met her
husband, John J. O'Connor 111, while at Stanford, and both
of their sons are also alumni of the University.
Kathleen Sullivan, dean of the Stanford Law
School, told the news service that O'Connor was an in
spired selection.
"Justice O'Connor is a wonderful choice for Commence
ment speaker," Sullivan said. "A great friend to Stanford and
its law school, she has made history twice — once as the first
woman appointed to the Supreme Court, and again through
the strength of her opinions, which have kept the court true
to its historic role as a moderate counterweight to the ex
treme positions often expressed in politics."
Commencement will be held on Sunday, June 13. It is.part
of a two-day celebration for graduates, their families and
friends, and members of the Stanford community.
