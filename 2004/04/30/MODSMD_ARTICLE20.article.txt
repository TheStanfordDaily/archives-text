## Full Moon should not die 
### 
Last Thursday night, Stanford students par
took in the Farm's age-old tradition of Full
Moon on the Quad. For the most part, fresh
man and seniors— and sophomore, juniors
and graduate students, too — enjoyed kisses under
the light of the moon. Meanwhile, the Band played on
and streakers darted across the Quad. Planners exe
cuted a commendable event, downplaying the impor
tance of alcohol by emphasizing alternatives to drink
ing. But we are concerned that the University's efforts
to lessen alcohol usage across campus may have back
fired on Thursday evening, playing a role in the two
arrests and at least four hospitalizations that occurred
early Friday morning.
In past years, alcohol has played a fairly prominent
role in the revelry of Full Moon on the Quad. But this
year, with an increased security presence and dorm
staff members who discouraged drinking, many atten
dees agreed that there was very little alcohol present
at Full Moon on the Quad itself. This result is partly
due to planning by coordinators.
But many — if not most — of Full Moon attendees
consumed alcohol before coming to the Quad. More
importantly, a number of individuals drank excessively
and put themselves and others in danger through their
reckless behavior. The Alcohol Policy has been the
source of great criticism on campus lately, but students
must take the responsibility upon themselves not to en
gage in dangerous drinking practices. If students hope
for the University to lessen its control on campus alco
hol consumption, they should set an example by re
sponsibly conducting themselves at public gatherings.
However, we also question whether this year's in
crease in severe alcohol-related problems might be re
lated to the University's recent campus-wide imple
mentation of the Alcohol Policy. Not including the ar
rests and hospitalizations, other students were intoxi

cated to the point where they needed assistance in stum
bling home. Although there may have been less alcohol
actually consumed on the Quad this year, the number of
extreme cases of drinking seems to have drastically in
creased from last year's Full Moon on the Quad.
On Friday, Assistant Dean and Director of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe said she had serious
reservations about Full Moon on the Quad happening
again. We hope the University does not take action
that will lead to the death of one of Stanford's most
celebrated and revered traditions. Thousands of Stan
ford graduates recall their experiences of Full Moon
on the Quad with pride — and while public drunken
ness at the event has escalated in recent years, cancel
ing Full Moon on the Quad would only sidestep the
larger issues at hand.
University officials must re-examine the revised
Alcohol Policy when deciding why more students
seem to have been hospitalized at this year's event.
While a stricter anti-alcohol attitude probably pre
vented light drinkers from consuming alcohol at Full
Moon on the Quad, such students were never in any
great risk in the first place because they generally
drink responsibly.
On the other hand, those who desired to drink heav
ily likely continued to do so this year, but behind closed
doors instead of more openly among their classmates.
The culture of drinking in private tends to prompt more
intense alcohol consumption over a short period of time,
which should be a concern to the University.
We believe that Full Moon on the Quad should
continue as an annual event long into the future. For
this to occur, both the University and students need to
work together to ensure that everyone involved has a
safe and responsible night.
