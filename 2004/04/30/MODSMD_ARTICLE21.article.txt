# ASSU mishandled election
## 
### 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate last night
sent a message that it will not tolerate ques
tionable campaign tactics in the executive
elections. To allow an election to stand de
spite multiple violations of campaign rules would
have been unfair to the candidates and might have
tarnished the ASSU's reputation, the senators decid
ed. That is a noble sentiment. But the way it was put
into practice is disgraceful.
The campaign violations, in short, consisted of a
few groups and individuals sending unsolicited, elec
tion-related e-mails after the deadline for campaign
ing had passed. Most of these e-mails expressed sup
port for the Lee-Mefford slate, and at least two were
written with Lee and Mefford's consent.
It is unclear whether Lee and Mefford intended to
break the rules — ambiguous wording left a loophole
that the candidates thought they could exploit. But it
certainly would not have been out of line for the Elec
tions Commission to withhold the results, given all
the confusion. The Senate could then have debated
whether or not a re-election was necessary, and they
could have made their decision untainted by the
knowledge of who had won the original vote.
Instead, the Commission announced the results
of the election to the student body and recommend
ed that the Senate certify Lee-Mefford as the win
ners. This, too, was a valid stance. Examining voter
trends before and after the offending e-mails had
been sent, the commission members found no evi
dence that the e-mails affected voting patterns. They
decided that the election results represented the will
of the voters, and that given the ambiguity in the
rules, none of the candidates had committed any
clearly unethical acts.

But last night, the Senate ignored the Elections
Commission's recommendation and called for a re
election. Coming after the results had already been an
nounced, this wasn't just a vote to nullify the election on
the grounds that it was unfair — it was a vote to strip
Lee and Mefford of the presidency and vice presidency.
That's a much more politically charged proposi
tion. and one that implies substantial misdeeds by
Lee and Mefford, personally. That seems like a harsh
judgment, given that the violations essentially
amounted to free political speech by people unaffili
ated with their campaign. But if Lee and Mefford did
indeed act unethically and against the rules, why
aren't they disqualified?
The student body now faces another tedious elec
tion campaign, with perhaps new slates or new com
binations of old slates competing under the same
dysfunctional system of rules. Moreover, the ASSU
has sent mixed messages by implying that Lee and
Mefford did not deserve their victory, yet allowing
them to run again. Worse still, voters have gotten the
message that their votes can be overturned by a
small group of ASSU senators. Ironically, these
same senators who are so concerned about per
ceived flaws in the executive election were them
selves elected through a process that borders on far
cical: Typically, whoever has the cleverest or most
colorful flyers wins.
The ASSU election system does need reform, and
candidates need to understand that breaking the
rules is not a winning strategy. But publicly anointing
a winner and then subsequently calling for a revote
was the wrong way to accomplish those goals.
