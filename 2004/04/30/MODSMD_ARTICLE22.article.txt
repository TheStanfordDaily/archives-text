# The 						Stanford Daily
## Editor in Chief's Note Controversial ads will keep running 
### 
What is appropriate for this newspaper to
run as an advertisement? What's not?
Questions such as these have become
the source of heated debate after Oct.
21, when The Stanford Daily began publishing adver
tisements from the One Truth Foundation, a nation
al advocacy organization, and its Web site
http://www.campustruth.org. Since then, the paper
has received a flood of letters — both from those
who support the ad series and those who vehemently
oppose it.
Our paper's ad policy states we don't publish ads
that "incite violence, [or are) obscene or libelous."
Furthermore, we don't run ads that "cast asper
sions" based on ethnicity, religion or sexual orienta
tion. Racial implications can obviously be found in
any political ad about the Israeli-Palestinian con
flict. But it is our duty as a newspaper to base our
judgment on facts alone — and what is explicitly
presented in an advertisement.

I may not agree with viewpoints expressed by
Campustruth.org. But no single word, phrase or
image in the ads demonstrates prejudice. The ads do
not make any derogatory blanket statements about
the Israeli and Palestinian populations.
Controversial ads are not uncommon in the world
of journalism. The decision to print or reject an ad is
made independent of financial considerations. We
will continue to run the Campustruth.org ads for their
full scheduled duration of five weeks, which will end
on Nov. 21. We will also continue to run letters —
from those who oppose the ads, those who support the
ads and those who fall anywhere in between. We hope
that this exchange of ideas will foster greater under
standing among those in the University community.
