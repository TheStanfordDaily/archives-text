# GO BIG OR GO HOME
## An adventure in office hours 
### 
In the three and a half years I've
been at Stanford, I've never once
stopped by a professor's office
hours. I've hiked the Dish, carved
my initials into a table at the Oasis and
fountain-hopped. I've even viewed an
item at Special Collections. But not once
have I been to office hours.
I hardly even go to class these days,
especially with Senior Class activities
gearing up and ASSU elections looming.
Gotta get stuff done, but it never has any
thing to do with class. Or professors.
So I decided that this week's column
would serve as my excuse to do what I've
wanted to do for a long time: sponta
neously show up at a prof s office and just
start talking. ITiey're smart people —
maybe they'd have their own nuggets of
wisdom that they'd want to share with a
random student dropping by.
My journey begins in the inner Quad,
flip-flops on my feet, t-shirt on my back
and a scruffy mug that I haven't shaved in
a couple days. My hair is greasy and I'm
not even the slightest bit presentable, but
my quest is driven by my deadline to turn
this column in.
First stop: Classics Department. First
open door: a guy whose last name is
Devine. He's out of his office, which is
too bad (think of the tag-lines for this col
umn: "Devine Intervention," or "Wak
ing Prof. Devine").
I move on to the History Corner.
Nearly every door is closed, and Joel
Beinin, expert in Middle Eastern history,
is busy talking to someone. I finally find
an open door and a prof who looks occu
pied. "It's not my office hours," Richard
Roberts (or Robert Richards, I forget
which) says to me apologetically.
Stymied yet again. I begin to worry
that my first attempt to be a reporting
columnist will be a boring, fruitless ad
venture around the Quad. Press on. I say
to myself.
Next stop: Psych building, where I
spent many of my freshman days dab
bling in classes and experiments that
added up to an almost-minor and about

$35.1 start out on the bottom floor and
walk through the haunted hallway
where the infamous Stanford Prison
Experiment took place. No professors

anywhere to be
found. Turning the
corner, I nearly run
straight into Prof.
Phil Zimbardo, the
man behind the
aforementioned
prison experiment.
This freaks me out a

little... but he's on his way out to
teach a class and tells me I should take
it next year.
No problem, I say. After all. I might
still have time to get that minor, consid
ering I'll probably still be in school for
the next five years.
Another door open just a crack. I
knock and am greeted by the puzzled
look on Prof. Barbara Tversky's face.
I've heard the name before, and though
I can't remember what courses she
teaches, I know she's pretty prominent.
And suspicious.
"1... uh, um, this is my first office
hours in four years here at Stanford, and
I just want to talk about something ran
dom. I don't know. Life lessons. Uh ... "
I am trying not to tell her that I'm
planning to write a column about my first
office hours experience.
"Well, I have five minutes," she says.
I ask if I can sit down.
"Sure, but five minutes," she politely
reminds me. "I have a lot of meetings to
go to. I'm probably busier these days
than I was as an undergrad."
She begins by asking me about my
major and my interests. I tell her that I've
done too many extracurriculars, too little
studying and that I'm not sure how I'm
ever going to focus on research or study
ing or graduating. These are the ques
tions I find myself asking over and over
again these days. Questions that I'm sick
of asking and you're sick of hearing, I
know. I'm sorry. Barbara's never heard
them from me before.

"Well, it's good to focus on one
thing," she advises. "Experiences build
on one another, but if you focus on one
thing, you can look back and feel a sense
of accomplishment."
1 tell her that 1 like business, that I'm a
jack-of-all-trades and master of none.
And how this worries me because I don't
know how this will be able to lead me to
feel a sense of fulfillment. She recounts a
story of a friend's father, who was a good
chemist. Good, but not great enough to
go into academia. He was more fit for
business. Ends up that he earns a lot of
money and puts it towards organizations
that he supports and this is how he finds a
sense of fulfillment. "It's not that you
have to do what everyone else does," she
says when I bring up my many friends
who have perfect grades and are off to
grad schools.
We talk about politics, journalism,
parents and careers. She tells me about
her son, a former math major who be
came a video game designer. Now he's
based in London, doing the business side
of things. "He loves his job," she says. She
tells me about her daughter, who went to
Yale and didn't know what she wanted to
do when she graduated. "I'm very proud
of her now," Tversky says. "She's done
very well."
The professor's wisdom is very evi
dent in her well thought-out comments.
"It all falls together," she says. "You'll
land on your feet. You seem to be a doer
and an optimist. That's good."
It's ended up being a fine afternoon
with even finer life advice. And Barbara
Tversky has saved me from disappoint
ment on my adventure.
Over a half hour later, I shake her hand
and thank her for her time. "No problem,"
she says. "Go visit other professors...
maybe ones you know."
I just might do that.

would serve as my excuse to do what I've
wanted to do for a long time: sponta
neously show up at a prof s office and just
start talking. ITiey're smart people —
maybe they'd have their own nuggets of
wisdom that they'd want to share with a
random student dropping by.
My journey begins in the inner Quad,
flip-flops on my feet, t-shirt on my back
and a scruffy mug that I haven't shaved in
a couple days. My hair is greasy and I'm
not even the slightest bit presentable, but
my quest is driven by my deadline to turn
this column in.
First stop: Classics Department. First
open door: a guy whose last name is
Devine. He's out of his office, which is
too bad (think of the tag-lines for this col
umn: "Devine Intervention," or "Wak
ing Prof. Devine").
I move on to the History Corner.
Nearly every door is closed, and Joel
Beinin, expert in Middle Eastern history,
is busy talking to someone. I finally find
an open door and a prof who looks occu
pied. "It's not my office hours," Richard
Roberts (or Robert Richards, I forget
which) says to me apologetically.
Stymied yet again. I begin to worry
that my first attempt to be a reporting
columnist will be a boring, fruitless ad
venture around the Quad. Press on. I say
to myself.
Next stop: Psych building, where I
spent many of my freshman days dab
bling in classes and experiments that
added up to an almost-minor and about

$35.1 start out on the bottom floor and
walk through the haunted hallway
where the infamous Stanford Prison
Experiment took place. No professors

anywhere to be
found. Turning the
corner, I nearly run
straight into Prof.
Phil Zimbardo, the
man behind the
aforementioned
prison experiment.
This freaks me out a

little... but he's on his way out to
teach a class and tells me I should take
it next year.
No problem, I say. After all. I might
still have time to get that minor, consid
ering I'll probably still be in school for
the next five years.
Another door open just a crack. I
knock and am greeted by the puzzled
look on Prof. Barbara Tversky's face.
I've heard the name before, and though
I can't remember what courses she
teaches, I know she's pretty prominent.
And suspicious.
"1... uh, um, this is my first office
hours in four years here at Stanford, and
I just want to talk about something ran
dom. I don't know. Life lessons. Uh ... "
I am trying not to tell her that I'm
planning to write a column about my first
office hours experience.
"Well, I have five minutes," she says.
I ask if I can sit down.
"Sure, but five minutes," she politely
reminds me. "I have a lot of meetings to
go to. I'm probably busier these days
than I was as an undergrad."
She begins by asking me about my
major and my interests. I tell her that I've
done too many extracurriculars, too little
studying and that I'm not sure how I'm
ever going to focus on research or study
ing or graduating. These are the ques
tions I find myself asking over and over
again these days. Questions that I'm sick
of asking and you're sick of hearing, I
know. I'm sorry. Barbara's never heard
them from me before.

"Well, it's good to focus on one
thing," she advises. "Experiences build
on one another, but if you focus on one
thing, you can look back and feel a sense
of accomplishment."
1 tell her that 1 like business, that I'm a
jack-of-all-trades and master of none.
And how this worries me because I don't
know how this will be able to lead me to
feel a sense of fulfillment. She recounts a
story of a friend's father, who was a good
chemist. Good, but not great enough to
go into academia. He was more fit for
business. Ends up that he earns a lot of
money and puts it towards organizations
that he supports and this is how he finds a
sense of fulfillment. "It's not that you
have to do what everyone else does," she
says when I bring up my many friends
who have perfect grades and are off to
grad schools.
We talk about politics, journalism,
parents and careers. She tells me about
her son, a former math major who be
came a video game designer. Now he's
based in London, doing the business side
of things. "He loves his job," she says. She
tells me about her daughter, who went to
Yale and didn't know what she wanted to
do when she graduated. "I'm very proud
of her now," Tversky says. "She's done
very well."
The professor's wisdom is very evi
dent in her well thought-out comments.
"It all falls together," she says. "You'll
land on your feet. You seem to be a doer
and an optimist. That's good."
It's ended up being a fine afternoon
with even finer life advice. And Barbara
Tversky has saved me from disappoint
ment on my adventure.
Over a half hour later, I shake her hand
and thank her for her time. "No problem,"
she says. "Go visit other professors...
maybe ones you know."
I just might do that.

In the three and a half years I've
been at Stanford, I've never once
stopped by a professor's office
hours. I've hiked the Dish, carved
my initials into a table at the Oasis and
fountain-hopped. I've even viewed an
item at Special Collections. But not once
have I been to office hours.
I hardly even go to class these days,
especially with Senior Class activities
gearing up and ASSU elections looming.
Gotta get stuff done, but it never has any
thing to do with class. Or professors.
