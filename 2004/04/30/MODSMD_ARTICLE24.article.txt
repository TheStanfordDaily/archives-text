# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Make the most out of Stanford 
### 
At the turn of the millennium, 1
entered my freshman year of
college wide-eyed and
awestruck. The campus was
overwhelming in its beauty, and the con
cept of college was intimidating even for
a high school hero like me. I was clueless
but optimistic.
Neither of my parents went to col
lege. My father was orphaned around
the age of 18 and hit the work force im
mediately out of high school. My moth
er attended junior college for a year and
studied what women were supposed to
study: secretarial science. She left school
to help raise her brothers and sisters.
Their lack of college experience facili
tated my lack of purpose upon arrival.
I thought of university as a place you
go after high school to learn stuff. So, I
utilized my well-honed problem solving
skills and broke it down into manage
able goals:
1) Go there.
2) Learn stuff.
I hopped on a flight from Logan Air
port to SFO. I sat with a guy who was so
obese he took up both the aisle and the
window seats. 1 sat in the middle. When
we landed, they surgically removed me
from the plane and I hastily hopped on a
Supershuttle and zoomed off to campus.
After I passed a couple of squawking
crazies in front of Florence Moore Hall
who turned out to be the house staff, I
checked off the first mission on my col
lege task list: I had gotten there.
I then shifted all my attention to
"learning stuff." After about 15 hours of
finger twiddling and knuckle cracking, I
realized that this subgoal was a bit too
vague. I mean, I had acquired some
knowledge, but a lot of it was stuff that
didn't seem to apply to my college goal.
It is true that imbibing a mixture of bour
bon, scotch and baking soda leads to dis
robing and hurling brown bananas at
tube-topped party girls, but how crucial
was college to all this? I resolved to re
evaluate my role as an undergraduate.
Thanks to many of my ambitious
peers, I have learned that undergraduate
education is not about life experience.
To gain that, work the railroad. It's not
an academic pursuit. Get a library card.
It's not about making friends. Check out
bars, bus stops, bordellos. College is for
gaining an advantage over less intelli
gent people in the job market. Think of it
as a vocational school on steroids.
To all you freshman who are as naive
and idealistic as I used to be, here is some
insight into how to maximize the utility of
your time on the Farm.
Rule no. 1: Learn to view the world
in terms of your resume.
That girl in line next to you just
dropped her carton of milk. What do

you do?
Well, she's a klutz and so qualifies as
handicapped. You ought to bend down
and retrieve it for her while the oppor
tunity is still there. This is an unreward
ed act of benevolence and so qualifies
as "volunteering." Thus, you "donated
a large portion of your time volunteer
ing to help the handicapped." Remem-

ber, words like
"large" are subjective
and can be strewn
about frivolously.
Did you initiate a
weekly poker game in
your dorm? That con
stitutes a "club" or
even a "successful en
trepreneurship" if
you made a few bucks
in the process.
Another approach

to ensuring a good resume requires
some research on your part. Go out and
identify all the campus clubs that re
quire minimal effort for membership.
Join every single one and then sit back
and let your name sit on the rosters. If
anybody questions your commitment,
tell them your grandmother died.
(Note: you have an upper limit of three
dead grandmothers.)
Here's another ingenious approach.
Simply say you held some prestigious posi
tion like "editor of the The Stanford Re
view" or the "Serial Groper." When po
tential employers can't find your name any
where connected with said position, roll
your eyes, sigh and say as arrogantly as pos
sible, "I operated under a pseudonym."
If you want to engineer anything, en
gineer your GPA. Take a bunch of easy
classes and get straight As. All the col
lege how-to books make it very clear
that As in easy classes look better than
Bs in classes where you like or learn the
material. If at any point your calculations
tell you that you can't graduate with any
thing higher than a 3.9, take the elevator
to the top of Hoover Tower. Step out
onto the ledge. Take a deep breath.
Jump out as far as you possibly can and
freefall. You'll either hit the ground hard
and avoid a miserable life of mediocre
accolades, or you'll be able to fly, which
would make up for it. I like to call this
plan the "Win-Win Situation."
Junior year is the time to attend to job
fairs and networking events. You will in
evitably see lines of students waiting to
talk to representatives of big-money
companies. Don't let a queue deter you
from approaching potential employers
and selling yourself like a waffle iron on
QVC. But, obviously, don't wait in the
lines. That's just absurd.
Here's an effective approach to cir
cumventing lines. Make an effort to

flank the front person on a side that he
or she is not guarding. When this overly
patient imbecile turns and gives you that
look of "What the hell do you think
you're doing?", glare back with an angry
demeanor and mouth the words, "1 will
stab you in the face." This will usually
work. If not, whip out a tazer and elec
trify his / her ass. Whatever employer
you're looking to work for will appreci
ate your competitive spirit while that
other dude is convulsing on the ground
like hickory-smoked bacon.
When it comes to accepting job of
fers, don't be picky about the ethics of
the companies. Ethics should be the last
thing on your mind. If it comes down to
choosing between two employers, ac
cept the offer from whichever company
has the worst ethical record. It's a good
heuristic for identifying companies with
the highest profit potentials.
You can also prepare for your future
by beginning to vote Republican in all
elections. Democrats rarely fight for the
needs of the wealthy, and this just won't
suit you as your portfolio grows almost
as healthily as the Botox culture in your
mistress' face. Do your part in helping to
tip the political scales in favor of the
wealthy. It will pay off down the line.
Some of you might be uncomfortable
with this. You're still young and a tad
foolish (no offense), so you might have
lingering liberal beliefs, at least socially.
Here's a little trick to avoid any cognitive
dissonance and shuck your social aware
ness like a monkey on your back. Every
morning after you wake up, recite the
following four sentences aloud 14 times:
1) I will be dead before the environ
ment matters.
2) Poor people are lazy (and proba
bly stupid, which is also their fault).
3) The only thing better than lots of
money is lots more money.
4) If I don't screw people over, then
somebody else will, and, knowing my
luck, he'll end up being my next-door
neighbor who boasts a fancier nuclear
powered H2 in his driveway, sneering at
me like the dirty rotten son of a bigger
dirty rotten son of a dad.
rhis should adequately prepare you
'07's to get some usefulness out of an
otherwise useless education. When
graduation rolls around and you've got
your six-figure salary job in the bag, in
terrogate your peers about their future
plans and then give your head a quarter
tilt, raise your eyebrows, and nod conde
scendingly at their replies. Your glory
will consume you.
