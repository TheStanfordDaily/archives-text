Probation cramps party scene
The University should remember
that when they place multiple houses
on probation, it closes down potential
social outlets for all students and con
sequently floods any party that actual
ly aoes get held. The crowding makes
it harder for the hosts to enforce any
rules without guest-lists, lines and
pushy hired muscle. Sometimes you
have to wait more than 30 minutes to
get in to a party under these conditions
— unless you know someone living in
the host house. So social activity not
only becomes uncertain, but elitist and
blatantly exclusive as well.
Also, waiting in line for any party
just plain sucks. I wish that someone
would take responsibility for the new
policy and the new brand of enforce
ment. Then students and administra
tors might sit down, discuss it, and
make real progress. As it stands, re
sponsibility is divided among so
many that it is nearly impossible to
even know to whom we might ad
dress our complaints.

Students must lake responsibility
for drinking
While the administration's threats
to eliminate Full Moon on the Quad
due to a few mishaps at this year's
event are completely uncalled for, stu
dents' attribution of those unfortunate
happenings to the new Alcohol Policy
are misguided and ludicrous.
The legal drinking age in the Unit
ed States is 21. Contrary to popular be
lief, the University is not being unrea
sonable or oppressive by "enforcing"
this. The Beastie Boys say you gotta
fight, for your right, to paaaar-tay, so
fight if you must but at least find a bet
ter premise upon which to base your
argument than that it "forces" people
to drink in private. Nobody is being
forced to drink anything here.
By no means should the adminis
tration cater to this infantile mentali
ty. As a reputable institution of learn

ing, it is their duty and obligation to
aim for something a little higher than
the lowest common denominator.
Just because folks are going to drink
doesn't mean that the University
ought to support or enable them. Con
grats to Stanford for having come up
with something resembling an actual
policy to replace the alcohol non-poli
cy of yesteryear.

MEChA not analogous to KKK
The Stanford Review is right to be
wary of supremacist groups. However,
a group that seeks to affirm and sup
port a culture is not a supremacist
group. A supremacist group is one that
seeks to conserve power only for itself.
One cannot truly call MECnA such a
group since people of Mexican descent
in California — and the greater south
west — have seen periods of great lack
of power. With an understanding of

the history in the Americas of the dec
imation of indigenous peoples, I find it
hard to believe that someone at Stan
ford finds it scary that the few remain
ing indigenous peoples on this conti
nent seek to preserve their culture.

ResEd needs to listen to students
When I was a freshman in Larkin,
the Office of Residential Education
used to project itself as something spe
cial — something I bragged about to
high school friends at otner universi
ties. The unique polices on alcohol,
community and education really set
the freshman experience apart from
anywhere else. Given the current
trend of rapid changes and lack of stu
dent input with those changes, it seems
a matter of time before RAs are mere
ly a policeman arm of Residential Ed
ucation. It seems but a matter of time
before the Row program gets thrown

away in favor of something more tame
and controllable, and it seems only a
matter of time before the Greek pro
fram is done away with altogether,
tudents feel like they are under at
tack from above. We nave but a little
voice, no real power and the last thing
anyone wants to do is entrust and edu
cate us to act responsibly. Instead,
these opportunities seem to be quickly
slipping away and taking much of un
dergraduate tradition and character
with it. A tragedy, given how special
Residential Education was only three
years ago when I was a freshman.

Sexual assault policy fails students
The Tri-Delt incident involving un
derage sorority members, alcohol and
allegations of sexual assault is indicative
of now the University falls short of
meeting the needs of women who re
port sexual assault, and the University's

failure to create a standardized system
andpolicy to address sexual assault.
The article explained that a woman
came to the police to report that "she
was coerced into sexual acts," an alle
gation of sexual assault. It appears that
the Santa Clara District Attorney dis
regarded the sexual assault charges in
favor of charging all parties involved -
the suspects who where charged with
sexual assault and the sorority mem
bers who purchased the alcohol —
with a blanket penalty of providing al
cohol to minors.
The current policy on sexual assault
is not very accessible to students. It
should state up front whether or not the
victim will be protected or held liable
for violating alcohol policy and state the
risk of legal action being taken against
the victim. The University should deal
with sexual assault allegations in a way
that encourages reporting and address
es the needs of the victims.
