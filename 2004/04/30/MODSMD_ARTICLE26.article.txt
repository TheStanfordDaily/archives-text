## Card resumes Pac-10 play against WSU 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
No. 2 Stanford will ease back into conference
play this weekend against an opponent it hasn't
lost to in 26 years.
After a four game stretch of non-conference
games, the Cardinal hosts Washington State in a
three-game series starting tonight. They've de
feated the Cougars 17 times in a row dating back
to the 1978 Riverside Classic.
Stanford (31-6, 7-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
leads the conference by two full games over
Washington, which faces third-place Oregon
State this weekend.
The Pac-10 race is far from over, as only one
game separates third from eighth place. And
Stanford's cushion isn't comfy enough for man
ager Mark Marquess by any stretch of the imag
ination.
"We've got 15 league games left, and it is re
ally kind of up for grabs," he said. "There is a
lot of parity and a lot of teams that are still in
the hunt . . . This weekend is big but, really,
every weekend is big because the standings are
so bunched."
Don't think that the Cardinal is going to be
taking the Cougars (23-16,5-7) lightly this week
end. After all, Stanford lost to lowly Sacramen
to State last weekend, and this Washington State
team has improved markedly from a year ago.
The Cougars have already won more games
than they did last year (19), and with two more
conference victories, they would match last year's
Pac-10 total.
Leading the way for Washington State is ju
nior first baseman Grant Richardson, who is the
Cougars' answer to Stanford's Jed Lowrie.
Richardson is second in the conference in home
runs (11, two behind Lowrie), third in RBIs (50,
three behind Lowrie) and eighth in slugging per
centage (.594). More than half of Richardson's
home runs (seven) came during a six-game
stretch during the first week of April.
But Richardson isn't the only offensive
weapon for Washington State. The Cougars may
have enough bats to actually match Stanford's
prolific offense this weekend.
Junior second baseman Jason Freeman's .352
batting average leads six Cougar regulars hitting
over .300. He's hit a blistering .458 in conference
play and has reached base in 17 of his last 18
games.
Left fielder Kaeo Rubin is hitting .340 from
the leadoff spot and is third in the league in
runs scored (46) and ninth in on-base percent
age (.473).
You get the point. This team can hit the
lights out.
Pitching, however, is another story.

The Cougars' hurlers have a troubling 5.22
ERA and have allowed opponents to hit a col
lective .300 against them.
Washington State lost its best starting pitcher,
Bryce Chamberlin (6-1, 56 strikeouts in 48 in
nings) to an odd off-the-field injury. He was as
saulted on April 16th while "attempting to defuse
an argument between two people" and sustained
a broken jaw, according to the Cougars' media re
lations department.
In his stead, Aaron Trolla (4-3, 4.80 ERA)
and Aaron MacKenzie (5-4, 5.09) have tried to
take some of the workload, but have had only
moderate success doing so. The Cougars' best
pitcher has been Garrett Alwert, who has won
his past two Sunday Pac-10 starts, including
holding Southern California scoreless over eight
innings while allowing only four hits.
Not surprisingly, Washington State manager
Tim Mooney knows what his team has to do to
end the long losing streak.
"The key to the weekend will be our pitch
ing," he said.
Speaking of Sunday starters, Stanford manag
er Mark Marquess had still not named someone
to fill that role this weekend as of last night.
Earlier in the week. Marquess said any of sev
eral pitchers — Greg Reynolds and Matt Man
ship among them — could fill the role.
Freshman lefty Blake Holler had previously
held down the third starter spot, but has lasted a
total of only 9 1/3 innings in his previous three
starts.
It seemed Holler had begun to lose his confi
dence, but his performance Tuesday out of the
bullpen in Stanford's 12-8 win over Santa Clara
probably made Marquess think twice about taking
his young left-hander out of the starting rotation
just yet.
Holler entered the game in the ninth and
pitched four flawless innings, allowing no hits
and only one walk, striking out five in his best
outing in weeks.
"He really gave us a chance to win the game,"
Marquess said. "If he doesn't do that, we don't
come back."
Marquess even admitted after the game he
would have wanted to go even longer with
Holler.
"I would have loved for Holler to have fin
ished out the game for us," Marquess said. "But
that's why I took him out, so we could have the
option of using him Sunday."
Stanford must have the third starter spot filled
out by the time the regionals roll around, so it
won't be a surprise if Marquess tries someone be
sides Holler.
The First pitch tonight will be at 6 p.m.
while the Saturday and Sunday games both
begin at 1 p.m.

er Mark Marquess had still not named someone
to fill that role this weekend as of last night.
Earlier in the week. Marquess said any of sev
eral pitchers — Greg Reynolds and Matt Man
ship among them — could fill the role.
Freshman lefty Blake Holler had previously
held down the third starter spot, but has lasted a
total of only 9 1/3 innings in his previous three
starts.
It seemed Holler had begun to lose his confi
dence, but his performance Tuesday out of the
bullpen in Stanford's 12-8 win over Santa Clara
probably made Marquess think twice about taking
his young left-hander out of the starting rotation
just yet.
Holler entered the game in the ninth and
pitched four flawless innings, allowing no hits
and only one walk, striking out five in his best
outing in weeks.
"He really gave us a chance to win the game,"
Marquess said. "If he doesn't do that, we don't
come back."
Marquess even admitted after the game he
would have wanted to go even longer with
Holler.
"I would have loved for Holler to have fin
ished out the game for us," Marquess said. "But
that's why I took him out, so we could have the
option of using him Sunday."
Stanford must have the third starter spot filled
out by the time the regionals roll around, so it
won't be a surprise if Marquess tries someone be
sides Holler.
The First pitch tonight will be at 6 p.m.
while the Saturday and Sunday games both
begin at 1 p.m.

The Cardinal rehjrns to Sunken Diamond after a thrilling extra-innings win at Santa Clara. The team will look tp maintain its
grip on the Pacific 10 Conference lead in its three-game series against the Huskies.
No. 2 Stanford will ease back into conference
play this weekend against an opponent it hasn't
lost to in 26 years.
After a four game stretch of non-conference
games, the Cardinal hosts Washington State in a
three-game series starting tonight. They've de
feated the Cougars 17 times in a row dating back
to the 1978 Riverside Classic.
Stanford (31-6, 7-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
leads the conference by two full games over
Washington, which faces third-place Oregon
State this weekend.
The Pac-10 race is far from over, as only one
game separates third from eighth place. And
Stanford's cushion isn't comfy enough for man
ager Mark Marquess by any stretch of the imag
ination.
"We've got 15 league games left, and it is re
ally kind of up for grabs," he said. "There is a
lot of parity and a lot of teams that are still in
the hunt . . . This weekend is big but, really,
every weekend is big because the standings are
so bunched."
Don't think that the Cardinal is going to be
taking the Cougars (23-16,5-7) lightly this week
end. After all, Stanford lost to lowly Sacramen
to State last weekend, and this Washington State
team has improved markedly from a year ago.
The Cougars have already won more games
than they did last year (19), and with two more
conference victories, they would match last year's
Pac-10 total.
Leading the way for Washington State is ju
nior first baseman Grant Richardson, who is the
Cougars' answer to Stanford's Jed Lowrie.
Richardson is second in the conference in home
runs (11, two behind Lowrie), third in RBIs (50,
three behind Lowrie) and eighth in slugging per
centage (.594). More than half of Richardson's
home runs (seven) came during a six-game
stretch during the first week of April.
But Richardson isn't the only offensive
weapon for Washington State. The Cougars may
have enough bats to actually match Stanford's
prolific offense this weekend.
Junior second baseman Jason Freeman's .352
batting average leads six Cougar regulars hitting
over .300. He's hit a blistering .458 in conference
play and has reached base in 17 of his last 18
games.
Left fielder Kaeo Rubin is hitting .340 from
the leadoff spot and is third in the league in
runs scored (46) and ninth in on-base percent
age (.473).
You get the point. This team can hit the
lights out.
Pitching, however, is another story.

The Cougars' hurlers have a troubling 5.22
ERA and have allowed opponents to hit a col
lective .300 against them.
Washington State lost its best starting pitcher,
Bryce Chamberlin (6-1, 56 strikeouts in 48 in
nings) to an odd off-the-field injury. He was as
saulted on April 16th while "attempting to defuse
an argument between two people" and sustained
a broken jaw, according to the Cougars' media re
lations department.
In his stead, Aaron Trolla (4-3, 4.80 ERA)
and Aaron MacKenzie (5-4, 5.09) have tried to
take some of the workload, but have had only
moderate success doing so. The Cougars' best
pitcher has been Garrett Alwert, who has won
his past two Sunday Pac-10 starts, including
holding Southern California scoreless over eight
innings while allowing only four hits.
Not surprisingly, Washington State manager
Tim Mooney knows what his team has to do to
end the long losing streak.
"The key to the weekend will be our pitch
ing," he said.
