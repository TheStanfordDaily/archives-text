# Softball to battle Arizona, ASU
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 7 Cardinal softball team (38-12, 8-4
Pacific-10 Conference) hopes to build on its
strong performance last weekend when it travels
to Tempe and Tucson this weekend for three
games against the Arizona schools. The Cardinal
will face unranked Arizona State (31-23, 1-9) in
Tempe todaybefore moving on to Tucson to face
top-ranked Arizona (45-2, 9-1) in two games, to
morrow and Sunday.
The Cardinal is coming off some of its strongest
performances of the season after sweeping three
games against No. 4 UCLA (41-7) and No. 6 Wash
ington (32-11) on the road last weekend. Star pitch
er Dana "Lightning D'' Sorensen pitched a four-hit
shutout against UCLA and struck out 14 Huskies
en route to victories in both of her starts last week
end. Stanford's second starter, sophomore Laura
Severson also putin a strong game in the circle to
clinch a win for the Cardinal.
The Stanford offense is as locked-in as it has
been all season, largely a result of the hitting of Na
tional Softball Player of the Week Lauren Lappin,
a sophomore shortstop who batted .471 (8-for-18)
with six RBIs last week as the Cardinal posted a 4-
1 record.
Lappin is now batting .338 on the season and is
second on the team with 38 RBIs, behind only se
nior catcher Jessica Allister, the Cardinal's most
dangerous offensive threat through the Pac-10 sea
son thus far.
Allister is batting .345 on the year with a team
leading six home runs and 39 RBI. Freshman out
fielder and leadoff hitter Jackie Rinehart batted
.375 last weekend and junior third baseman Liz

Bendig ended an offensive drought in a big way
by hitting .375 over the Cardinal's five games last
week. Bendig's hitting, along with the recent of
fensive success of juniors Leah Nelson and
Meghan Sickler, has helped to energize the bot
tom of the Cardinal batting order and keep op
posing pitchers on their toes for every at-bat of
every game.
The Cardinal will need every hit they can muster
against top-ranked Arizona and the Wildcats'
sophomore ace, Alicia Hollowell.
Hollowell boasts an imposing 33-1 record on the
season, with a school-record 409 strikeouts and an
0.75 ERA. Stanford has already faced Hollowell
three times this season, losing each time, including
an 8-0 loss at home two weeks ago.
The Cardinal hopes to build on its disappointing
performance against the Wildcats in the last meet
ing between the two teams, and this time all the
momentum is in Stanford's favor. Not only is the
Cardinal coming off three huge conference victo
ries, but the Wildcats are coming off a loss to Ore
gon last weekend.
However, Stanford head coach John Rittman
said that, for now. the Cardinal will be focused on
today's game versus Arizona State.
"We can't overlook any opponent," Rittman
said. "I think last week was indicative of that, when
we dropped a midweek game to St. Mary's. Right
now, our biggest concern is Arizona State.
"As far as Arizona, we know them pretty well
after having played them three times already, and
we know what we have to do as a team to beat
them," Rittman continued. "But the focus for
now is ASU."
For the Cardinal, winning today's game versus
the Sun Devils should be a much more manageable

task than tomorrow and Sunday's matchups against
the Wildcats.
After starting the season strong, Arizona State
took a nose dive at the start of Pac-10 play. With a
1-9 conference record, the Sun Devils have
dropped from being nationally ranked to not re
ceiving any votes in the most recent poll.
The Cardinal also has the advantage of having
won both of its games against Arizona State this
year. Still, the Sun Devils are not to be overlooked,
boasting a strong batting order led by Phelan
Wright, a two-time finalist for National Player of
the Year.
As the Cardinal learned early last week, no op
ponent can be underestimated — and the Sun Dev
ils are a far better team than St. Mary's.
One additional factor in this weekend's games
will be the Arizona weather. Rittman said that the
temperature for Friday and Saturday's night games
will be somewhere around 90 degrees, and the tem
perature Sunday's afternoon game could reach 100
degrees or higher.
"The hot weather this week here at Stanford
really helped us out, as we were able to get some
practice time in the hot sun to prepare us for this
weekend," Rittman said. "Plus, our players have
been hydrating since Tuesday or Wednesday in
preparation."
The Cardinal's team goal all year has been to
earn an appearance in the College World Series.
With last weekend's clutch victories, the Cardinal
put itself in a position to achieve that goal.
With a victory over Arizona State and even a
split against top-ranked Arizona, the Cardinal will
be on the fast track toward not only making the Se
ries, but possibly towards setting a new school
record for conference wins.

The No. 7 Cardinal softball team (38-12, 8-4
Pacific-10 Conference) hopes to build on its
strong performance last weekend when it travels
to Tempe and Tucson this weekend for three
games against the Arizona schools. The Cardinal
will face unranked Arizona State (31-23, 1-9) in
Tempe todaybefore moving on to Tucson to face
top-ranked Arizona (45-2, 9-1) in two games, to
morrow and Sunday.
The Cardinal is coming off some of its strongest
performances of the season after sweeping three
games against No. 4 UCLA (41-7) and No. 6 Wash
ington (32-11) on the road last weekend. Star pitch
er Dana "Lightning D'' Sorensen pitched a four-hit
shutout against UCLA and struck out 14 Huskies
en route to victories in both of her starts last week
end. Stanford's second starter, sophomore Laura
Severson also putin a strong game in the circle to
clinch a win for the Cardinal.
The Stanford offense is as locked-in as it has
been all season, largely a result of the hitting of Na
tional Softball Player of the Week Lauren Lappin,
a sophomore shortstop who batted .471 (8-for-18)
with six RBIs last week as the Cardinal posted a 4-
1 record.
Lappin is now batting .338 on the season and is
second on the team with 38 RBIs, behind only se
nior catcher Jessica Allister, the Cardinal's most
dangerous offensive threat through the Pac-10 sea
son thus far.
Allister is batting .345 on the year with a team
leading six home runs and 39 RBI. Freshman out
fielder and leadoff hitter Jackie Rinehart batted
.375 last weekend and junior third baseman Liz

Bendig ended an offensive drought in a big way
by hitting .375 over the Cardinal's five games last
week. Bendig's hitting, along with the recent of
fensive success of juniors Leah Nelson and
Meghan Sickler, has helped to energize the bot
tom of the Cardinal batting order and keep op
posing pitchers on their toes for every at-bat of
every game.
The Cardinal will need every hit they can muster
against top-ranked Arizona and the Wildcats'
sophomore ace, Alicia Hollowell.
Hollowell boasts an imposing 33-1 record on the
season, with a school-record 409 strikeouts and an
0.75 ERA. Stanford has already faced Hollowell
three times this season, losing each time, including
an 8-0 loss at home two weeks ago.
The Cardinal hopes to build on its disappointing
performance against the Wildcats in the last meet
ing between the two teams, and this time all the
momentum is in Stanford's favor. Not only is the
Cardinal coming off three huge conference victo
ries, but the Wildcats are coming off a loss to Ore
gon last weekend.
However, Stanford head coach John Rittman
said that, for now. the Cardinal will be focused on
today's game versus Arizona State.
"We can't overlook any opponent," Rittman
said. "I think last week was indicative of that, when
we dropped a midweek game to St. Mary's. Right
now, our biggest concern is Arizona State.
"As far as Arizona, we know them pretty well
after having played them three times already, and
we know what we have to do as a team to beat
them," Rittman continued. "But the focus for
now is ASU."
For the Cardinal, winning today's game versus
the Sun Devils should be a much more manageable

task than tomorrow and Sunday's matchups against
the Wildcats.
After starting the season strong, Arizona State
took a nose dive at the start of Pac-10 play. With a
1-9 conference record, the Sun Devils have
dropped from being nationally ranked to not re
ceiving any votes in the most recent poll.
The Cardinal also has the advantage of having
won both of its games against Arizona State this
year. Still, the Sun Devils are not to be overlooked,
boasting a strong batting order led by Phelan
Wright, a two-time finalist for National Player of
the Year.
As the Cardinal learned early last week, no op
ponent can be underestimated — and the Sun Dev
ils are a far better team than St. Mary's.
One additional factor in this weekend's games
will be the Arizona weather. Rittman said that the
temperature for Friday and Saturday's night games
will be somewhere around 90 degrees, and the tem
perature Sunday's afternoon game could reach 100
degrees or higher.
"The hot weather this week here at Stanford
really helped us out, as we were able to get some
practice time in the hot sun to prepare us for this
weekend," Rittman said. "Plus, our players have
been hydrating since Tuesday or Wednesday in
preparation."
The Cardinal's team goal all year has been to
earn an appearance in the College World Series.
With last weekend's clutch victories, the Cardinal
put itself in a position to achieve that goal.
With a victory over Arizona State and even a
split against top-ranked Arizona, the Cardinal will
be on the fast track toward not only making the Se
ries, but possibly towards setting a new school
record for conference wins.
