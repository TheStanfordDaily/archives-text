# No. 2 Card draws comparisons to '67 team
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
In the 111-year history of baseball on the Farm, Stanford has won two na
tional championships, made 24 NCAA tournament appearances and 15 trips
to the College World Series.
Compiling any sort of list of the greatest Stanford teams of all-time is
enough to make your head spin.
"It's almost impossible to name the best team," said Mark Marquess,
who's been a part of several great Cardinal teams in his 28 years as head
coach and three seasons as a player (1967-69). "I think you always have to say
when we won a national championship in '87 and '88, those were our best
teams because that's what it's measured by."
Two-thirds of the way through the regular season, the 2(X)4 Cardinal's
permanent place in Stanford baseball lore remains to be determined. But al
ready, the names Fuld, Putnam, Mayberry Jr. and Co. will be forever linked
with one of Stanford's greatest teams ever.
With a 10-5 victory over Saint Mary's last week, this year's squad be
came the only team besides the 1967 squad to reach 30 wins in its first
35 games.
"I like this team," said Marquess, who admits he wasn't aware of that dis
tinction and insists the team doesn't get too caught up in numbers during the
season. "This team's work ethic is good, the chemistry is good and there's a
good blend of old and young. Our pitching is probably as young as we've ever
had it. That's probably been the biggest surprise."
All of those aspects, incidentally, were characteristics of the fast-start
ing 1967 team, led by a clutch, switch-hitting first baseman by the name of
Mark Marquess.
The 1967 season was a fitting swan song for legendary Stanford head
coach Dutch Fehring, who guided the Indians to 290 wins during his 12-
year tenure.
Despite losing seven lettermen (including two Ail-Americans), their lead
ing hitter and their top two pitchers from the year before, the Indians finished
36-6-1 in Fehring's final season.
Stanford captured the newly formed Pac-8 title outright and advanced to
the College World Series before falling to Arizona State in 14-innings, 4-3,
just one win shy of the title game.
"They were a great bunch of kids," said the 91-year old Fehring, who
remains a fixture at Sunken Diamond 27 years later. "They pulled for
each other and there were no cliques that I knew of. It was my best year
ever at Stanford."
The Indians' success that season was in large part due to another
"best ever," as in the freshman baseball squad of 1966 (freshman could
not play varsity). That team went 27-1-2 under the direction of
Fehring's successor, Ray Young, and even managed a 5-3 win over the
Stanford varsity team.
Needless to say, Fehring expected big things from his heralded sopho
mores in 1967, a group that included a trio of poised pitchers in Rod Poteete,
Don Rose and Sandy Vance, plus hard-hitting third baseman Bob Boone,
outfielder Bob Gallagher and Marquess.
All paid immediate dividends with the big boys, although Marquess had
arguably the best sophomore season. He led the team in seven offensive cat
egories, including batting average (.404) and total bases (85), and played
flawless defense, earning Ail-American honors.
"That was a very talented team," Marquess said. "My class was a great
class and combine that with Frank Duffy and Mike Schomaker and we had a
really good group there."
Duffy, who turned down an offer from the Atlanta Braves after hitting
.308 as a sophomore, was one of Stanford's eight returning lettermen. The
freckle-faced shortstop's strong arm and range made him one of the finest
defensive infieldersin Stanford history. Fehring called him the best shortstop
he ever coached.
With Duffy and senior second baseman Dick Swan forming a leather wall
up the middle, Stanford boasted a .968 team fielding percentage.
As good as the offense was — it averaged over six runs per game — the
team was perhaps more feared for its pitching.
Poteete and Rose put together impressive sophomore seasons and senior
Daro Quring was dominant, but Vance emerged as the ace of a staff that
boasted a 1.96 ERA. The righthander with the blazing fastball finished 11-0
and earned first team All-League honors, striking out 94 batters in 86 1 / 3 in
nings pitched.
"It was unique because we had a lot of talent and ability but you didn't
have prima donnas," Vance said. "We all just wanted to win ballgames."
And win they did.
The Indians opened the season with back-to-back shutouts over Saint
Mary's and Chico State and were 8-0 before dropping their first game of the

season, 2-1, to Cal Poly-Pomona.
Stanford got a three-hit, 13-strikeout performance from Vance to split a
double-header at Southern California, two of the most important league
games of the season.
At Sunken Diamond one week later, the rubber game of the season series
ended in a 3-3 tie after 14 innings, when the umpire decided it was too dark
to continue. The game was originally stopped after USC batted in the top of
the 14th, but Fehring came out of the dugout, argued his case and convinced
the umpire to change his mind.
The Trojans were the dominant team in the country at the time and the
importance of playing well against USC's usual bunch of scholarship players
and junior college transfers was magnified by the fact that only the Pac-8 win
ner earned the right to play for a trip to Omaha.
"1 was mainly concerned with beating USC," Duffy said. "Going to the
World Series was like gravy on top of that. That was a great year."
After capturing the conference crown with a 10-1 record, the Indians ad
vanced to the World Series in dramatic fashion, dropping the first game of a
best-of-three series against Fresno State before coming back to sweep the
doubleheader the following day.
Stanford won its first two games in Omaha, but a 5-3 loss to Arizona State
put the Indians in the losers bracket. A gutsy 5-3 win over Auburn set the
stage for a rematch with the Sun Devils and a heartbreaking end to a phe
nomenal season.

Reflecting back on one of his finest seasons on the Farm, Marquess put
the 2004 Cardinal's accomplishments thus far in perspective.
"I would say that with the development of college baseball, [winning 30 of
your first 35 games] is harder to do now," Marquess said. "In those days,
there wasn't as much parity."
Still, when asked to imagine a showdown between Vance and his current
team's potent lineup. Marquess doesn't sell his former teammate — or the
importance of pitching — short.
"1 think Sandy Vance would win that battle," Marquess said. "I've always
been a believer that good pitching will get good hitting out. I guarantee that
[Vance] would be the hardest thrower that they would see."
Whether it winds up in the same breath as the '87 and '88 teams —
or even the '97 and '98 teams — in talk of the greatest Stanford teams in
history, the 2004 Cardinal is indeed something special. Like in 1967. the
team has made up for the loss of its best hitters, plays superb defense
and has a young, though not as dominant, pitching staff that is coming
into its own.
"This is a very good Stanford team," said Fehring, who sits in the
press box at most weekend day games. "I think Mark has had more
talent on some of his teams in years past than this year, but hope
fully the pitching depth will get him back through Omaha again. [In
1967] we took it one game at a time and that's what this year's team
is doing."

"It's almost impossible to name the best team," said Mark Marquess,
who's been a part of several great Cardinal teams in his 28 years as head
coach and three seasons as a player (1967-69). "I think you always have to say
when we won a national championship in '87 and '88, those were our best
teams because that's what it's measured by."
Two-thirds of the way through the regular season, the 2(X)4 Cardinal's
permanent place in Stanford baseball lore remains to be determined. But al
ready, the names Fuld, Putnam, Mayberry Jr. and Co. will be forever linked
with one of Stanford's greatest teams ever.
With a 10-5 victory over Saint Mary's last week, this year's squad be
came the only team besides the 1967 squad to reach 30 wins in its first
35 games.
"I like this team," said Marquess, who admits he wasn't aware of that dis
tinction and insists the team doesn't get too caught up in numbers during the
season. "This team's work ethic is good, the chemistry is good and there's a
good blend of old and young. Our pitching is probably as young as we've ever
had it. That's probably been the biggest surprise."
All of those aspects, incidentally, were characteristics of the fast-start
ing 1967 team, led by a clutch, switch-hitting first baseman by the name of
Mark Marquess.
The 1967 season was a fitting swan song for legendary Stanford head
coach Dutch Fehring, who guided the Indians to 290 wins during his 12-
year tenure.
Despite losing seven lettermen (including two Ail-Americans), their lead
ing hitter and their top two pitchers from the year before, the Indians finished
36-6-1 in Fehring's final season.
Stanford captured the newly formed Pac-8 title outright and advanced to
the College World Series before falling to Arizona State in 14-innings, 4-3,
just one win shy of the title game.
"They were a great bunch of kids," said the 91-year old Fehring, who
remains a fixture at Sunken Diamond 27 years later. "They pulled for
each other and there were no cliques that I knew of. It was my best year
ever at Stanford."
The Indians' success that season was in large part due to another
"best ever," as in the freshman baseball squad of 1966 (freshman could
not play varsity). That team went 27-1-2 under the direction of
Fehring's successor, Ray Young, and even managed a 5-3 win over the
Stanford varsity team.
Needless to say, Fehring expected big things from his heralded sopho
mores in 1967, a group that included a trio of poised pitchers in Rod Poteete,
Don Rose and Sandy Vance, plus hard-hitting third baseman Bob Boone,
outfielder Bob Gallagher and Marquess.
All paid immediate dividends with the big boys, although Marquess had
arguably the best sophomore season. He led the team in seven offensive cat
egories, including batting average (.404) and total bases (85), and played
flawless defense, earning Ail-American honors.
"That was a very talented team," Marquess said. "My class was a great
class and combine that with Frank Duffy and Mike Schomaker and we had a
really good group there."
Duffy, who turned down an offer from the Atlanta Braves after hitting
.308 as a sophomore, was one of Stanford's eight returning lettermen. The
freckle-faced shortstop's strong arm and range made him one of the finest
defensive infieldersin Stanford history. Fehring called him the best shortstop
he ever coached.
With Duffy and senior second baseman Dick Swan forming a leather wall
up the middle, Stanford boasted a .968 team fielding percentage.
As good as the offense was — it averaged over six runs per game — the
team was perhaps more feared for its pitching.
Poteete and Rose put together impressive sophomore seasons and senior
Daro Quring was dominant, but Vance emerged as the ace of a staff that
boasted a 1.96 ERA. The righthander with the blazing fastball finished 11-0
and earned first team All-League honors, striking out 94 batters in 86 1 / 3 in
nings pitched.
"It was unique because we had a lot of talent and ability but you didn't
have prima donnas," Vance said. "We all just wanted to win ballgames."
And win they did.
The Indians opened the season with back-to-back shutouts over Saint
Mary's and Chico State and were 8-0 before dropping their first game of the

season, 2-1, to Cal Poly-Pomona.
Stanford got a three-hit, 13-strikeout performance from Vance to split a
double-header at Southern California, two of the most important league
games of the season.
At Sunken Diamond one week later, the rubber game of the season series
ended in a 3-3 tie after 14 innings, when the umpire decided it was too dark
to continue. The game was originally stopped after USC batted in the top of
the 14th, but Fehring came out of the dugout, argued his case and convinced
the umpire to change his mind.
The Trojans were the dominant team in the country at the time and the
importance of playing well against USC's usual bunch of scholarship players
and junior college transfers was magnified by the fact that only the Pac-8 win
ner earned the right to play for a trip to Omaha.
"1 was mainly concerned with beating USC," Duffy said. "Going to the
World Series was like gravy on top of that. That was a great year."
After capturing the conference crown with a 10-1 record, the Indians ad
vanced to the World Series in dramatic fashion, dropping the first game of a
best-of-three series against Fresno State before coming back to sweep the
doubleheader the following day.
Stanford won its first two games in Omaha, but a 5-3 loss to Arizona State
put the Indians in the losers bracket. A gutsy 5-3 win over Auburn set the
stage for a rematch with the Sun Devils and a heartbreaking end to a phe
nomenal season.

Reflecting back on one of his finest seasons on the Farm, Marquess put
the 2004 Cardinal's accomplishments thus far in perspective.
"I would say that with the development of college baseball, [winning 30 of
your first 35 games] is harder to do now," Marquess said. "In those days,
there wasn't as much parity."
Still, when asked to imagine a showdown between Vance and his current
team's potent lineup. Marquess doesn't sell his former teammate — or the
importance of pitching — short.
"1 think Sandy Vance would win that battle," Marquess said. "I've always
been a believer that good pitching will get good hitting out. I guarantee that
[Vance] would be the hardest thrower that they would see."
Whether it winds up in the same breath as the '87 and '88 teams —
or even the '97 and '98 teams — in talk of the greatest Stanford teams in
history, the 2004 Cardinal is indeed something special. Like in 1967. the
team has made up for the loss of its best hitters, plays superb defense
and has a young, though not as dominant, pitching staff that is coming
into its own.
"This is a very good Stanford team," said Fehring, who sits in the
press box at most weekend day games. "I think Mark has had more
talent on some of his teams in years past than this year, but hope
fully the pitching depth will get him back through Omaha again. [In
1967] we took it one game at a time and that's what this year's team
is doing."
