# Allister aims for the top in last year on the Farm
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
In some ways, Jessica Allister's se
nior season is a lot like her freshman
season. She's playing every day, the
Cardinal is making a push toward the
College World Series, and she spends
most of her time on the field catching
the pitches of Dana Sorenson.
But even if the only difference is 90
points in batting average and three
more years of experience, that bodes
pretty well for the Cardinal Softball
team, which is getting its fourth pro
ductive year out of the 5-foot-10
right-handed hitter from Texas.
Allister hit .254 her freshman year
with three home runs and 26 RBIs;
today her stat line reads .345-6-39,
with an impressive .411 on-base per
centage and.593 slugging percentage.
Allister says the improvement in
her game this year is the result of se
lectivity.
"My problem most of my career
was never getting any pitches to hit,"
she said. "So this year 1 just wanted to
focus on seeing the ball well and not
hitting pitchers' pitches."
Ask Allister what her favorite
memory is, and she will quickly tell
you it was her freshman year.
"When we won the Regionals and
went to the World Series, I just re
member every going crazy," she said.
"It was the first time the school had
made it."
Not surprisingly, Allister would

like to close out her career the way she
began it — by helping the Stanford
program reach a higher level.
"Nothing ever makes you com
pletely happy until you win a nation
al championship," she said. "We
should win our regional, we should
made it to the College World Series.
But if we put ourselves in a position
to do it and we go out there and play
well, I'm happy."
Allister is also happy to have had
the talented Sorenson as her battery
mate for the past four years.
"Dana and I know what each other
is thinking before we even say it," Al
lister said. "Sometimes she'll start her
motion before I even really put down
my sign because she knows what I'm
thinking."
This summer, Allister will play in
the new professional softball league —
on the same team as Sorenson. After
that, she wants to get into coaching.
Although it's been a challenge to
compete every day in Pacific-10 Con
ference softball — it's questionable
whether any college sport has a more
dominant conference than softball
does with the Pac-10 — Allister knows
it's made her and her teammates bet
ter prepared in the end.
"It's nice because you know, once
you get to the Pac-10 schedule, there's
nobody else," she said. "There's no
one out there that you're worried
about that you haven't played yet. It's
a really good tool as far as building for
the postseason."

The Cardinal may be building for
the postseason, but Allister does just
fine during the regular season, too.
She racked up a team-high 11
homers and 40 RBIs while being one
of three Cardinal players to appear in
all 67 of the team's games — despite
the physical wear-and-tear of playing
the diamond's second-most strenu
ous position.
"It's just what I do everyday," Al
lister said. "I've gotten to catch ev
eryday for four years, so it's just be
come kind of a routine."
While All ister's consistent, de
pendable production has been a hall
mark of her time on the Farm, she's
enjoying the break from routine that
this year's team has made.
The Cardinal's record sits at an im
pressive 38-12, including an 8-4 mark
in the Pac-10, thanks in part to a sweep
in Washington State last weekend.
Given the rigors of her daily rou
tine, Allister can be forgiven for over
looking the significance of the Cardi
nal's impressive output during the first
half of conference play.
"I guess it didn't really hit me until
this weekend." Allister said. "[But]
this is the best we've done since my
freshman year."
But, with the wisdom of someone
about to spend three days crouched
behind home plate in the hot Arizona
sun, Allister isn't in the mood for cele
bration just yet.
"We can't get too excited," she said.
"We just have to stay steady."

In some ways, Jessica Allister's se
nior season is a lot like her freshman
season. She's playing every day, the
Cardinal is making a push toward the
College World Series, and she spends
most of her time on the field catching
the pitches of Dana Sorenson.
But even if the only difference is 90
points in batting average and three
more years of experience, that bodes
pretty well for the Cardinal Softball
team, which is getting its fourth pro
ductive year out of the 5-foot-10
right-handed hitter from Texas.
Allister hit .254 her freshman year
with three home runs and 26 RBIs;
today her stat line reads .345-6-39,
with an impressive .411 on-base per
centage and.593 slugging percentage.
Allister says the improvement in
her game this year is the result of se
lectivity.
"My problem most of my career
was never getting any pitches to hit,"
she said. "So this year 1 just wanted to
focus on seeing the ball well and not
hitting pitchers' pitches."
Ask Allister what her favorite
memory is, and she will quickly tell
you it was her freshman year.
"When we won the Regionals and
went to the World Series, I just re
member every going crazy," she said.
"It was the first time the school had
made it."
Not surprisingly, Allister would

like to close out her career the way she
began it — by helping the Stanford
program reach a higher level.
"Nothing ever makes you com
pletely happy until you win a nation
al championship," she said. "We
should win our regional, we should
made it to the College World Series.
But if we put ourselves in a position
to do it and we go out there and play
well, I'm happy."
Allister is also happy to have had
the talented Sorenson as her battery
mate for the past four years.
"Dana and I know what each other
is thinking before we even say it," Al
lister said. "Sometimes she'll start her
motion before I even really put down
my sign because she knows what I'm
thinking."
This summer, Allister will play in
the new professional softball league —
on the same team as Sorenson. After
that, she wants to get into coaching.
Although it's been a challenge to
compete every day in Pacific-10 Con
ference softball — it's questionable
whether any college sport has a more
dominant conference than softball
does with the Pac-10 — Allister knows
it's made her and her teammates bet
ter prepared in the end.
"It's nice because you know, once
you get to the Pac-10 schedule, there's
nobody else," she said. "There's no
one out there that you're worried
about that you haven't played yet. It's
a really good tool as far as building for
the postseason."

The Cardinal may be building for
the postseason, but Allister does just
fine during the regular season, too.
She racked up a team-high 11
homers and 40 RBIs while being one
of three Cardinal players to appear in
all 67 of the team's games — despite
the physical wear-and-tear of playing
the diamond's second-most strenu
ous position.
"It's just what I do everyday," Al
lister said. "I've gotten to catch ev
eryday for four years, so it's just be
come kind of a routine."
While All ister's consistent, de
pendable production has been a hall
mark of her time on the Farm, she's
enjoying the break from routine that
this year's team has made.
The Cardinal's record sits at an im
pressive 38-12, including an 8-4 mark
in the Pac-10, thanks in part to a sweep
in Washington State last weekend.
Given the rigors of her daily rou
tine, Allister can be forgiven for over
looking the significance of the Cardi
nal's impressive output during the first
half of conference play.
"I guess it didn't really hit me until
this weekend." Allister said. "[But]
this is the best we've done since my
freshman year."
But, with the wisdom of someone
about to spend three days crouched
behind home plate in the hot Arizona
sun, Allister isn't in the mood for cele
bration just yet.
"We can't get too excited," she said.
"We just have to stay steady."
