# 2003-2004: The year in Cardinal sports
## 
### 
Football starts 2-0
PROVO, Utah —Trent Ed
wards won his first collegiate
start, but not in the manner
he expected.
The redshirt freshman quarter
back, who struggled all night to
throw tHe ball against an unortho
dox Brigham Young defense,
turned a naked bootleg into a go
ahead touchdown with 3:51 remain
ing in the game.
Stanford's defense made a
last-minute stop as the Cardinal
(2-0) matched last year's win
total with a thrilling but ugly 18-
14 road victory.
Junior running back Kenneth
Tolon rushed for a career-high 141
yards on a career-high 32 carries.

Edwards completed only 10-of
-23 passes for 25 yards, threw two in
terceptions and will be remembered
— for now at least — as the signal
caller who led Stanford to its lowest
number of yards passing (56) in
school history.
But despite its offensive woes —
including going only 2-for-16 on
third downs — the Cardinal was
somehow able to escape Provo with
a victory.

Football beats ASU, now 4-4
J.R. Lemon was going through
his usual pre-game routine, when
20 minutes before kickoff, he got

the news. Starting tailback Ken
neth Tolon had an injured right
thumb — and Lemon was going to
be his replacement.
"I was caught a little off-guard."
Lemon admitted.
But the junior running back
took full advantage of his opportu
nity and rushed for a career-high
151 yards on 34 carries and two
touchdowns in powering Stanford
(4-4, 2-4 Pacific 10 Conference) to
a 38-27 victory over Arizona State
in front of 26,950 soaking fans at
Stanford Stadium.
Stanford's offense, maligned for
its poor execution and even poorer
numbers, racked up a season-high
467 yards of total offense, convert
ed over 50 percent of its third
downs and scored five of the six

times it entered the red zone - in
cluding four touchdowns.

The Cardinal's final game of the

5-4-1 Pac-10) wasn't supposed to end like the other four
matches. It was the wrong way to finish the season. It was
the wrong way to send off senior co-captains Mike Wilson
and Abe Geiger.
The contest was supposed to be a statement game for
Stanford. A last stand. One final surge to get a result that re
flected its talent, and not its record.
But after 90 minutes on Maloney Field, the game left the
Cardinal with only that familiar sting. One last 1 -0 heartbreak.

Beavers hand football a record defeat
CORVALLIS, Ore. — Stanford came into Saturday's
matchup with Oregon State riding a two-game winning
streak; it left a rainy Reser Stadium on the wrong end of a
43-3 margin after putting up the second-worst offensive
showing in Stanford history'.
The Beavers (7-3,4-2 Pacific 10 Conference) hit the Car
dinal (4-5,2-5 Pac-10) early and often. Junior quarterback
Derek Anderson threw for 383 yards and four touchdowns,
while junior tailback Steven Jackson rushed for 148 yards
and a score of his own, as the Beavers posted their largest
margin of victory in their 70-game series against Stanford
and their third-highest offensive output (663 yards) in
school history.
Former walk-on receiver Mike Hass torched the Cardi
nal secondary' all day long, catching eight passes for 225
yards — the second-highest total in Oregon State history' —
and two touchdowns. Senior wideout James Newson
caught nine passes for 115 yards and a touchdown — the
20th of his career, breaking a 40-year-old Beavers record.
While the Beavers were breaking records all over the
field, Stanford failed to break the plane of the end zone.
Thanks in part to Oregon State's four sacks and two bad
snaps, Stanford posted minus-12 rushing yards on the day.
The Cardinal did manage to gain 133 yards of total offense,
exceeding 1979's record low of 116 yards against Tulane.
Now, Stanford needs to win its final two games — home
games against California and Notre Dame — to attain bowl
eligibility, something that the Beavers locked up with this win.

Women's soccer loses in first round at NCAAs
Friday night marked a frustrating end to a frustrating sea
son for the Stanford women's soccer team (10-9-2), which
bowed out of the NCAA College Cup in the first round with
a 1 -0 loss to Bay Area rival No. 3 Santa Clara (13-3-5).
The Cardinal has been plagued by injury all season and
Friday was no different - the team was forced to take the
field without its two top forwards, seniors Marcie Ward and
Brittany Oliveira.
While the Stanford defense was stellar all year, the sea
son proved that tight games cannot be won without some
sort of offensive firepower.
The Cardinal stepped up and played its best against top
teams, most notably coming away with scoreless ties against
then-No. 3 UCLA and then-No. 2 Notre Dame, but never
could get that win that would get their season going.
Individually, five Stanford players received All-Pac 10
Honors. Barnhart and Marquand received first team hon
ors. Barnhart recorded seven shutouts, 63 saved and posted
a 0.78 goals allowed average.

Stanford men and women both win
cross-country national championships
After a season of sweat and preparation, the top-ranked
men's cross country team cemented its status as one of the
greatest ever assembled, and the No. 2 women's team
capped its return to glory after a seven-year NCAA Cham
pionship drought.
Both teams won national championships in Waterloo,
Ind., on Monday, seven years to the day after both won titles
in 1996. The men won in convincing fashion despite tempera
tures that dropped to 18 degrees, scoring a scant 24 points to
runner-up Wisconsin's 174. The women wrested the crown
away from BYU, last year's champion, by the slimmest of
margins, scoring 120 points to BYU's 128 in an upset.
The Cardinal men took six of the top 13 spots to secure
its fourth national championship in eight years. Junior Ryan
Hall finished second overall, completing the 10-kilometer
course in 29 minutes, 15.4 seconds.
"To have six guys in the top 13 is unprecedented," said
head coach Andy Gerard. "From a historical perspective,
I'm not sure where we stand. I don't know how you can
compare across generations, but I do know that the guys did
a great job today in comparison to the rest of the field."
The team's 150-point margin of victory was the largest
in NCAA history, and its score was second only to UTEP's
17 in 1981.
Each of Stanford's seven runners were named All-Amer
icans. Seniors Grant Robison, lan Dobson and Louis Luchi
ni finished fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively. Seniors Adam
Tenforde and Donald Sage finished 12th and 13th and se
nior Seth Hejny rounded out the Stanford pack in 33rd.
On the women's side, junior Sara Bei finished third over
all. running the six-kilometer course in 19:49.1. North Car
olina's Shalane Flanagan won the race in 19:30.4. Junior
Alicia Craig finished sixth, and freshmen Katy Trotter, Ar
ianna Lambie and Amanda Trotter placed 21st, 24th and
92nd, respectively to round out Stanford's scoring.
Bei. Craig, Katy Trotter and Lambie received Ail-
American honors. Evans was named NCAA Coach of the
Year for women's cross country, and Gerard received the
honor on the men's side.

Football season ends with loss at hands of former coach
The Stanford football team was hoping to conclude its
season with a morale-boosting win over Notre Dame and
former coach Tyrone Willingham in his first return to the
Farm. The Cardinal was hoping to secure a little positive
momentum heading into the offseason and send out its 13
seniors on a high note.
But instead. Stanford was embarrassed like it had never
been before on its home turf - and the team is left with a lin
gering bitterness over some Irish antics.
Stanford (4-7) ended the 2003 season on Saturday with a hu
miliating. depressing 57-7 pasting at the hands of Notre Dame
— the worst home loss in % years of schwl history.
Notre Dame running back Julius Jones was the star of
the evening. He had 74 yards on the game's opening drive

and finished with a mind-boggling 218 yards and a 9.5 yard
per-carry average. Also, running back Ryan Grant had
three touchdown runs and the Notre Dame defense re
turned two Stanford fumbles for touchdowns.
"We didn't play," said senior quarterback Chris Lewis.
"We didn't tackle, we didn't get first downs [and] we turned
the ball over for touchdowns."

Men's water polo falls in title game to USC
No. 2 Stanford was unable to best No. 1 Southern Cali
fornia in the NCAA Water Polo Championship on Dec. 7
at the Avery Aquatic Center.
Not even an amazing four goals by the nation's top play
er, junior driver Tony Azevedo — who was named the
American Water Polo Coaches Association Player of the
Year for the third time last week — could bring Stanford
the win over the Trojans, though the Cardinal managed to
push the match into overtime.
More than 2,800 spectators crowded the aisles to witness
the hard fought contest that ended with a 9-7 USC victory
and extended the Trojans' winning streak against the Cardi
nal this season to four. While each game was close, Stanford
remained unable to conquer USC's tough, physical play.
Though the Cardinal battled the Trojans to a 7-7 tie at
the end of regulation play, USC would not let Stanford take
control of the game.
Both teams remained scoreless in the first overtime pe
riod. The Trojans' Trevor Clark scored the winning goal
with 56 seconds left in the second overtime period.

Robinson's bu//cr-bcater caps a minute of miracles
for the men's basketball team
They rushed the court at Maples Pavilion on Saturday.
Hands waving, feet stomping, girls crying, the Sixth Man
Club jumped up and down on those bouncy floors like it
never had before, like it never would again.
In reality, that post-game rush on those particular bouncy
floors, after junior forward Nick Robinson hit a 32-foot game
winner over Arizona's Andre Iguodala, might just have been
the Sixth Man Club's last bounce (the floors are being re-

placed this spring as a part of the Maples renovation).
But nobody's talking about that right now.
For the moment, they're already calling this one a classic.
Already marking it down in the history books as one of the
most entertaining and intriguing collegiate games of all time.
And, really, it was all of that — every gut-wrenching,
heart-pounding, hair-pulling bit of No. 2 Stanford's (20-0,
11-0 Pacific-10 Conference) 80-77 win over No. 12 Arizona
(14-6,6-5) on Saturday lived up to that billing.
"I'm starting to think this group might be something spe
cial," Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said. 'That
was just an unbelievable game."

Women's hoops at a crossroads after two losses in Arizona
After Arizona State (15-6, 9-3 Pacific-10 Conference)
flat-out manhandled the No. 7 Stanford women's basket
ball team (17-5,10-3), 73-53, in an astounding 30-point sec
ond half turnaround on Saturday, Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer put things as only she could.
"Our second half was an absolute melt-down," she said.
"There didn't seem to be anything that we did right."
The numbers say the same thing. In the second half, the
Cardinal had 11 turnovers, was out-rebounded 28-25, hit
just six field goals and shot a stunning 16.2 percent from the
field. Stanford, the best three-point shooting team in the
conference, by both percentage and number made, was just

2-of-25 for the game.
And that's just the beginning of the bad news for Stan
ford. When polls come out on Monday, the Cardinal will
have most likely lost its place among the nation's top 10, and
won't see its name atop the Pac-10 leaderboard for the first
time this season, and the fear that once struck the heart of
Stanford's opponents will most likely be gone.
The disastrous weekend has put the Cardinal at what
VanDerveer called a "crossroads" in its season. Stan
ford has three weeks remaining in regular-season con
ference play to regroup and try to regain some of the
momentum it had noing into the season, when it was one

of the handful of teams expected to compete for the na
tional title.

Baseball pets off to spectacular start
If anyone hadn't yet figured out how the Stanford
baseball team has been able to build a 13-2 record and be
come the top-ranked squad in the NCAA, this past week
end revealed it all. The Cardinal used every strength in its
arsenal in its sweep of California (7-9) and showed that
when explaining the team's success, it all comes down to
one thing — versatility.
"When we haven't pitched well we've been able to score
enough runs to give ourselves a chance to win and when we
haven't scored a lot of runs we've been able to pitch well,"
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said. "You've got to
be able to do that... and we've proved that we're capable."
The scries is the fifth straight in which the Cardinal has
bested Cal.

ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily File
Nick Robinson's game-winner over Andre Iguodala on Feb. 7 was the highlight of a 31 -2 season filled with highlights.
Finally? ... Over.
The steak, the dream of an undefeated season, the No. 1
ranking and the endless comparisons with undefeated St.
Joseph's — all the talk about history and all the hoopla
ended Saturday afternoon in front of a national television
audience and a record crowd of 10,086 at Bank of America
Arena in Seattle, where the Stanford men's basketball team
(26-1,17-1 Pacific-10Conference) lost its first game this sea
son, 75-62, to Washington (17-10,12-6).
The loss — the Cardinal's first since March 22. 2003,
when the Cardinal fell 85-74 in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament to Connecticut — ended Stanford's
history-making winning streak and caused the Cardinal
failed to become the only team in Pac-10 history to go 18-0
during the regular season.
Stanford will join Arizona and Oregon State on the list
of Pac-10 teams to complete a 17-1 conference season.
And with that loss, speculation begins. Suddenly ques
tions about the prospects of going undefeated have mor
phed into queries about almost perfect.
"It's just that we were one game away from something
pretty special," added head coach Mike Montgomery be
fore a throng of reporters outside of a quiet Stanford lock
er room. "It might take a little while to get over that."

Alabama washes men's hoops out of NCAA Tournament
SEATTLE, Wash. — A little over two weeks ago, in the
same city that the top-seeded Cardinal lost its first game of
the season to Washington, then-No. 1 Stanford (30-2)
racked up its second and final loss of the year, a 70-67 upset
by eighth-seeded, unranked Alabama in the second round
of the NCAA tournament.
More importantly and perhaps most devastatingly for
Stanford fans, for the second time in three weeks, a Stan
ford fairy tale ended in Seattle.
And, in reality, it had all the makings of a fairy tale — all
the drama and intrigue and seemingly ironic storylines —
an almost-perfect season with the potential to make a re
turn trip to San Antonio for the Final Four.
But it didn't end that way. Instead, the Cardinal failed to
advance past the round of 32 for the third consecutive year.
"It's very difficult to gain some perspective from this
game when we are hurting so badly, and to try to put into
perspective what we've accomplished this year," said Stan

ford head coach Mike Montgomery as he struggled to find
his words. "I can't really help them through that."
"I'm angry," junior swingman Josh Childress added.
"I'm angry and disappointed."
After an even opening period in which the Cardinal
found itself up by two at the half, 39-37, Stanford clawed its
way to a 13-point second half lead with eight minutes left to
play, holding the Crimson Tide to l-of-17 shooting for the
opening 12 minutes of the period.
And then the unthinkable happened — the tide turned
— and Stanford went cold.
Alabama scored 16 consecutive points over the next 4 1
/ 2 minutes to take the lead, 56-53, and Childress picked up
his fifth foul and was forced to watch the remaining three
minutes from the bench. Childress finished with 12 points
and seven boards in what might be his final game in a Stan
ford uniform.

Suininski's buzzer-heater sends women to Elite Eight
NORMAN, Okla. — When the Stanford women's bas
ketball team (29-6) received its draw from the NCAA Se
lection Committee, things looked bleak. A No. 6 seed in the
Midwest, where the Cardinal would be lumped behind
overall No. 1 seed Tennessee, red-hot Oklahoma — many
pundits' dark horse pick to reach the Final Four — and
SEC Tournament Champ Vanderbilt.
Stanford, however, played with a huge chip on its shoul
der and used the Selection Committee's snub to advance to
the Elite Eight yesterday, defeating Vanderbilt in the Sweet
Sixteen, 57-55, on a three-pointer by junior Kelley Sumins
ki with 0.3 seconds on the clock.
The Cardinal jumped out to a nine-point halftime lead
behind the brilliant first half play of Nicole Powell. Powell,
who had a double-double within 12 minutes of tipoff, or
chestrated the Stanford offense to perfection.
Stanford broke down the Commodores' patented
matchup zone defense with ease in the first 20 minutes,
shooting an astounding 61.9 percent from the field in the
first half, including 6-for-10 from long range.

Tara Kirk sets world records as women's swimming
finishes fifth at NCAAs
Though the Auburn women's swimming and diving
squad left College Station, Texas, last week with its third na
tional title in hand, Stanford senior Tara Kirk left the
NCAA Championships just as content as any of the Tigers.
Kirk returned to the Farm with NCAA Swimmer of the
Year honors — making her the fourth Cardinal woman to
win the award — along with her 10th and 11th NCAA ti
tles. She completed her college career with a perfect 35-0
mark in the 100-yard breaststroke. She was a part of a solid
Cardinal team that finished the meet in fifth place — one
spot above its 2003 finish.
Oh yeah, and she broke a world record.
Kirk's 1:04.79 finish in the 100 breast — which was her
fourth consecutive national title in the event — smashed the
world record set in 2003 by Leisel Jones of Australia (1:05.09)
and was the perfect cap to Kirk's illustrious Stanford career.
"I don't think I could have had a better ending [to my
college career]," said Kirk, a possible 2004 Olympian.
Kirk's world record was easily the highlight of the Cham
pionships for the Cardinal, but the team showed depth and
strength in many events that led to its fifth-place finish, just
behind second-place Georgia, Arizona and Florida.

Men's swimming places 2nd at NCAAs
LONG ISLAND, N.Y. — Like the rest of the student
body, the Stanford men's swim team had its weeklong hia
tus from school last week. However, instead of tropical get
aways, snowy mountains, and crazy parties, the team had a
spring break filled with exciting swimming. The break
marked the coming of the NCAA Swimming and Diving
Championships, which were held on Long Island last
Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
With its No. 2 national ranking and an undefeated
record, the Cardinal brought high hopes into the three-day
battle. But in the end. the top-ranked Auburn Tigers came
away with the 2004 championship. Stanford finished sec
ond, ahead of rival Texas in what turned out to be one of the

fastest NCAA meets in recent history.
Although swimmers performed well individually, the
lack of a team championship left some of the team members
feeling disappointed. Additionally, the swimming careers
of Stanford stars Michael Bruce and Bobby O'Bryan came
to a close.. However, the future is bright for the team, as the
swimmers begin to prepare for the Olympic Trials in July
and their chance at Olympic glory.

Gentry wins NCAA Championship at 157
The stakes were higher and the stage grander, but for Stan
ford junior Matt Gentry, the outcome was plenty familiar.
With a late reversal. Gentry defeated Ohio's Jake Perci
val 4-2 in the 157-pound final at the NCAA Wrestling
Championships in St. Louis 10 days ago to cap an undefeat
ed season and become the first national champion in Stan
ford wrestling history.
"It's a great experience, quite an honor," Gentry said.
"Stanford athletics is an amazing program, and I feel grate
ful to be able to wrestle for them."
Stanford head coach Steve Buddie, who placed fourth at
NCAAs as a junior in 1990 before taking the reins at his
alma mater three years ago, is equally grateful to have Gen
try as the cornerstone of a much improved program.
"When your program turns a corner, you just know there
is no turning back, Buddie said. "This was that defining mo
ment for our program."

Women fall just short in Elite Eight
NORMAN. Okla. —The magical run is over. The
Nicole Powell era is over. The Stanford women's basketball
team's up-and-down season has come to a heart-breaking
close at the hands of Tennessee, a team that the Cardinal
just can't seem to close out.
The top overall seed in the NCAA Women's Basketball
Tournament. Tennessee extended its dominance over the
sixth-seeded Stanford women, defeating the Cardinal, 62-
60, to advance to yet another Final Four appearance — and
it took yet another controversial call to do it.
After defeating Baylor in the Sweet Sixteen on free
throws with 0.2 seconds on the clock, the Lady Vols
seemed to get away with an offensive foul that put junior
guard Kelley Suminski on the ground with under a minute
left, setting the stage for a Tasha Butts three, putting Ten
nessee in the lead.
Senior forward Nicole Powell, however, was able to answer
hick with an off-balance, one-handed runner in the lane to tie the
ballgame with 44 seconds remaining on the clock.
Stanford came up with the defensive stop it needed, but
the rebound was swatted off the hands of senior center
Chelsea Trotter, giving Tennessee another opportunity to
take the lead.
Butts caught an inbounds pass and worked one-on-one
against Powell, wrapping around the taller, slower Powell
for a layup from the left block to put Tennessee up by two
with 1.7 seconds remaining.
On the final play, Powell caught a perfect baseball pass
from junior forward T'Nae Thiel and was able to get off a
final shot. The shot was on line, but hit the front of the rim.
There was contact with two Lady Vols on the shot, but no
foul was called.
The game was possibly most heart-breaking for Powell.
Powell played an amazing two halves, finishing with 31
points, 10 rebounds and two blocks on 14-of-24 shooting
from the field.
"That's what was missing — a win," Powell said. "We
played really tough, but they made the plays that count."

Women's gymnastics finishes third in Super Six
The Super Six. To those outside the world of college
gymnastics, it might sound like some weird average of the
Elite Eight and the Final Four. But to college gymnasts, the
Super Six is the be-all and end-all — the last stop on the
road to a national championship.
Stanford's mere appearance made school history; it
was only the second time that the Cardinal has broken
into the Super Six. The last time was in 2002 when the
team qualified by a narrow margin and finished sixth.
This year, Stanford tied for first in the preliminary meet
on Thursday and looked to repeat that winning perfor
mance on Friday.
"Before the meet, I told the team, 'This is our time,'"
said head coach Kristen Smyth, who was named Coach of
the Year by the National Association of Gymnastics

Coaches after the meet. " 'You've been working hard all
year, so why not? Compete with your hearts and have no re
grets. Love the sport and each other.'"
Stanford's total of 197.125 tied the Cardinal with Alaba
ma for third place, just shy of Georgia's 197.2 and a full point
behind UCLA's near-flawless 198.125. Third place is the
best finish ever for Stanford's women's gymnastics program.
The Cardinal also scooped up a school record of 15 Ail-
American honors, almost double last year's record of
eight honors. Senior Lise Leveille and sophomore Natalie
Foley each took home five All-American awards, while
seniors Lindsay Wing and Caroline Fluhrer earned three
and two, respectively.

Softball off to a strong start
The No. 8 Stanford softball team (37-12, 8-4 Pacific-10
Conference) knew going into this weekend's road trip that
this was a defining moment, if not the defining moment, in
its Pacific-10 Conference schedule.
The Cardinal would be traveling hundreds of miles in
three days after a month-long homestand. It would be try
ing to erase the bad taste in its mouth after losing big to
top-ranked Arizona and suffering an upset at unranked
non-conference foe St. Mary's earlier in the week. Most
importantly, the Cardinal would be facing some of the
fiercest competition on its difficult schedule in No. 4
UCLA (29-7,2-6) and No. 6 Washington (32-11,6-4).
The Cardinal answered any questions the last couple of
weeks might have raised with three thrilling victories this
weekend on the road at UCLA and Washington. The Car
dinal won with pitching on Friday, hitting on Saturday and a
little of both on Sunday in a weekend that helped cement
Stanford's place in the upper echelon of the Pac-10 this year.

Women's tennis shines at Pac-lOs, preps for NCAAs
You win some, you lose some, and you won't be shocked
that the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team (23-0) brought
home three titles at this weekend's Pacific-10 Conference
Individual Championships in Ojai Valley, Calif.
This season, as in recent years, winning handily has be
come the default, and winning in a pinch the exception.
In their first time competing together all year, junior Erin
Burdette and sophomore Alice Barnes teamed up in the
main draw to clinch the doubles title over California's No. 13
tandem of Raquel Kops-Jones and Jieun Jacobs, 8-6.
Meanwhile, it was a Stanford shutout in the Pac-10 in
vitational bracket, as freshman Anne Yelsey swept the in
vitational singles title against the Golden Bears' Jessica
Shu, 6-0, 6-1. In invitational doubles, freshman Theresa
Logar and junior Story Tweedie-Yates defeated Southern
California's Bernadette Bayani and Melissa Esmero, 8-4.
The women won the team Pac-10 crown this year as well,
by virtue of their undefeate Pac-10 record.
