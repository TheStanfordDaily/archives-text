# 2003-2004: The year in Cardinal sports
## 
### 
Football starts 2-0
PROVO, Utah —Trent Ed
wards won his first collegiate
start, but not in the manner
he expected.
The redshirt freshman quarter
back, who struggled all night to
throw tHe ball against an unortho
dox Brigham Young defense,
turned a naked bootleg into a go
ahead touchdown with 3:51 remain
ing in the game.
Stanford's defense made a
last-minute stop as the Cardinal
(2-0) matched last year's win
total with a thrilling but ugly 18-
14 road victory.
Junior running back Kenneth
Tolon rushed for a career-high 141
yards on a career-high 32 carries.

Edwards completed only 10-of
-23 passes for 25 yards, threw two in
terceptions and will be remembered
— for now at least — as the signal
caller who led Stanford to its lowest
number of yards passing (56) in
school history.
But despite its offensive woes —
including going only 2-for-16 on
third downs — the Cardinal was
somehow able to escape Provo with
a victory.

J.R. Lemon was going through
his usual pre-game routine, when
20 minutes before kickoff, he got

the news. Starting tailback Ken
neth Tolon had an injured right
thumb — and Lemon was going to
be his replacement.
"I was caught a little off-guard."
Lemon admitted.
But the junior running back
took full advantage of his opportu
nity and rushed for a career-high
151 yards on 34 carries and two
touchdowns in powering Stanford
(4-4, 2-4 Pacific 10 Conference) to
a 38-27 victory over Arizona State
in front of 26,950 soaking fans at
Stanford Stadium.
Stanford's offense, maligned for
its poor execution and even poorer
numbers, racked up a season-high
467 yards of total offense, convert
ed over 50 percent of its third
downs and scored five of the six

times it entered the red zone - in
cluding four touchdowns.
