## Entrepreneurship: not just for Google 
### ANN CHIN STAFF WRITER 
Not long ago, the idea of entre
preneurial education was a foreign
concept at most business schools.
Today, a growing number of univer
sities nationwide, including the
Graduate School of Business, are be
ginning to recognize the importance
of entrepreneurial thinking as part of
general management education.
"Studying management issues
in newer companies is an excellent
way to learn general management
principles in that the processes
and functions of emerging compa
nies are transparent, with fewer
layers of bureaucratic noise," said
Mary Burnham, a director in the
Center for Entrepreneurial Stud
ies at the GSB. "Even students
who will go on to work in large or
ganizations can benefit from en
trepreneurial coursework."
At the same time, many students
do eventually choose to found their
own businesses. According to Burn
ham, a recent study showed that
nearly a third of GSB alumni will
start a company at some point in
their careers.
The GSB's move toward more
entrepreneurial courses is part of a
national trend. According to an
April 1 article in The New York
Times, there were 16 entrepreneur
ship programs at schools nationwide
in 1970. By 2000, the number had
risen to about 1,500.

In 1996, the GSB established the
Center for Entrepreneurial Studies
to promote research on entrepre
neurship and venture capital and to
provide resources for students and
alumni with entrepreneurial inter
ests. About 20 courses on entrepre
neurship are currently offered.
The GSB Career Placement re
port for the Class of 2003 indicated
that 6 percent of students had
founded their own businesses. Of
the remaining 94 percent, it was es
timated that about 30 percent went
into consulting, 5 percent entered
investment banking and 7 percent
entered investment research and
portfolio management.
For those who start their own
businesses, there is no set template.
"The types of businesses started
are all over the map," Burnham said.
"One recent graduate started a new
baseball league, and another pur
chased an adult education school."
Students who decide to become
entrepreneurs tend be those with a
broad range of strengths rather than
those with expertise in one particu
lar area, said Edward Lazear, a pro
fessor of human resources manage
ment and economics.
"Generalists are more likely to be
entrepreneurs," he said. "Those who
are good in mostly one thing are not."
He explained, "Someone who is
great in finance but not great in
human resources may do better
going to an investment bank than starting his or her own
business where many skills are needed. Most people do
not start businesses right out of school. The typical pat
tern is to wait about 10 years, after having gotten varied
experience in an established firm."
Burnham said it was difficult to determine why some
people follow entrepreneurial paths and others do not.
"In our experience, people choose a career based on
some proper combination of risk and reward, entrepre
neurship just being one of those many combinations,"
she said.
GSB professors generally do not endorse any partic
ular careers, but Lazear encourages his students to strike
out on their own rather than join companies.
"It's called taking advantage of option value," he said.
Second-year GSB student Lu Dong said that most
professors actively encourage entrepreneurial thinking.
"Entrepreneurship is not always about starting your
own company," he added. "Running a big company can
be entrepreneurship as well. It's the spirit rather than
the format."

Though there is no clear line between entrepreneurial
training and traditional business training, many entrepre
neurial courses tend to place emphasis on issues such as
raising start-up capital, building a team and establishing
management control systems. They also tend to attract
students by featuring professors with industry experience.
"I was lucky to get in one of the high-demand classes
by Joe Peterson," Dong said. "The key difference be
tween accounting classes and entrepreneurial classes is
that the professors are practitioners rather than acade
mic researchers. Prof. Peterson was CFO and CEO for
many companies, and he has his own real estate and pri
vate equity funds. He sits on 16 company boards, so what
he taught us was (based on] real world experience."
Entrepreneurship programs vary in business schools
across the country, but the GSB has the advantage of
being located in Silicon Valley, which allows it to inte
grate the entrepreneurship community with classroom
experience, Burnham said. This year's teaching staff in
cludes Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google.
In one of the most popular entrepreneurship classes,
"Evaluating Business Opportunities," students research
a business idea with a team that includes at least one
graduate student from another school at Stanford, such
as law or engineering. After evaluating a wide range ol
criteria, the teams present their plans to real venture
capitalists and entrepreneurs for feedback.

ular careers, but Lazear encourages his students to strike
out on their own rather than join companies.
"It's called taking advantage of option value," he said.
Second-year GSB student Lu Dong said that most
professors actively encourage entrepreneurial thinking.
"Entrepreneurship is not always about starting your
own company," he added. "Running a big company can
be entrepreneurship as well. It's the spirit rather than
the format."

Though there is no clear line between entrepreneurial
training and traditional business training, many entrepre
neurial courses tend to place emphasis on issues such as
raising start-up capital, building a team and establishing
management control systems. They also tend to attract
students by featuring professors with industry experience.
"I was lucky to get in one of the high-demand classes
by Joe Peterson," Dong said. "The key difference be
tween accounting classes and entrepreneurial classes is
that the professors are practitioners rather than acade
mic researchers. Prof. Peterson was CFO and CEO for
many companies, and he has his own real estate and pri
vate equity funds. He sits on 16 company boards, so what
he taught us was (based on] real world experience."
Entrepreneurship programs vary in business schools
across the country, but the GSB has the advantage of
being located in Silicon Valley, which allows it to inte
grate the entrepreneurship community with classroom
experience, Burnham said. This year's teaching staff in

In one of the most popular entrepreneurship classes,
"Evaluating Business Opportunities," students research
a business idea with a team that includes at least one
graduate student from another school at Stanford, such
as law or engineering. After evaluating a wide range ol
criteria, the teams present their plans to real venture
capitalists and entrepreneurs for feedback.
Not long ago, the idea of entre
preneurial education was a foreign
concept at most business schools.
Today, a growing number of univer
sities nationwide, including the
Graduate School of Business, are be
ginning to recognize the importance
of entrepreneurial thinking as part of
general management education.
"Studying management issues
in newer companies is an excellent
way to learn general management
principles in that the processes
and functions of emerging compa
nies are transparent, with fewer
layers of bureaucratic noise," said
Mary Burnham, a director in the
Center for Entrepreneurial Stud
ies at the GSB. "Even students
who will go on to work in large or
ganizations can benefit from en
trepreneurial coursework."
At the same time, many students
do eventually choose to found their
own businesses. According to Burn
ham, a recent study showed that
nearly a third of GSB alumni will
start a company at some point in
their careers.
The GSB's move toward more
entrepreneurial courses is part of a
national trend. According to an
April 1 article in The New York
Times, there were 16 entrepreneur
ship programs at schools nationwide
in 1970. By 2000, the number had
risen to about 1,500.

In 1996, the GSB established the
Center for Entrepreneurial Studies
to promote research on entrepre
neurship and venture capital and to
provide resources for students and
alumni with entrepreneurial inter
ests. About 20 courses on entrepre
neurship are currently offered.
The GSB Career Placement re
port for the Class of 2003 indicated
that 6 percent of students had
founded their own businesses. Of
the remaining 94 percent, it was es
timated that about 30 percent went
into consulting, 5 percent entered
investment banking and 7 percent
entered investment research and
portfolio management.
For those who start their own
businesses, there is no set template.
"The types of businesses started
are all over the map," Burnham said.
"One recent graduate started a new
baseball league, and another pur
chased an adult education school."
Students who decide to become
entrepreneurs tend be those with a
broad range of strengths rather than
those with expertise in one particu
lar area, said Edward Lazear, a pro
fessor of human resources manage
ment and economics.
"Generalists are more likely to be
entrepreneurs," he said. "Those who
are good in mostly one thing are not."
He explained, "Someone who is
great in finance but not great in
human resources may do better
going to an investment bank than starting his or her own
business where many skills are needed. Most people do
not start businesses right out of school. The typical pat
tern is to wait about 10 years, after having gotten varied
experience in an established firm."
Burnham said it was difficult to determine why some
people follow entrepreneurial paths and others do not.
"In our experience, people choose a career based on
some proper combination of risk and reward, entrepre
neurship just being one of those many combinations,"
she said.
GSB professors generally do not endorse any partic
ular careers, but Lazear encourages his students to strike
out on their own rather than join companies.
