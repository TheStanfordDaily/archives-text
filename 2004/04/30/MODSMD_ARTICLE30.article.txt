## Entrepreneurship: not just for Google 
### ANN CHIN STAFF WRITER 
Not long ago, the idea of entre
preneurial education was a foreign
concept at most business schools.
Today, a growing number of univer
sities nationwide, including the
Graduate School of Business, are be
ginning to recognize the importance
of entrepreneurial thinking as part of
general management education.
"Studying management issues
in newer companies is an excellent
way to learn general management
principles in that the processes
and functions of emerging compa
nies are transparent, with fewer
layers of bureaucratic noise," said
Mary Burnham, a director in the
Center for Entrepreneurial Stud
ies at the GSB. "Even students
who will go on to work in large or
ganizations can benefit from en
trepreneurial coursework."
At the same time, many students
do eventually choose to found their
own businesses. According to Burn
ham, a recent study showed that
nearly a third of GSB alumni will
start a company at some point in
their careers.
The GSB's move toward more
entrepreneurial courses is part of a
national trend. According to an
April 1 article in The New York
Times, there were 16 entrepreneur
ship programs at schools nationwide
in 1970. By 2000, the number had
risen to about 1,500.

In 1996, the GSB established the
Center for Entrepreneurial Studies
to promote research on entrepre
neurship and venture capital and to
provide resources for students and
alumni with entrepreneurial inter
ests. About 20 courses on entrepre
neurship are currently offered.
The GSB Career Placement re
port for the Class of 2003 indicated
that 6 percent of students had
founded their own businesses. Of
the remaining 94 percent, it was es
timated that about 30 percent went
into consulting, 5 percent entered
investment banking and 7 percent
entered investment research and
portfolio management.
For those who start their own
businesses, there is no set template.
"The types of businesses started
are all over the map," Burnham said.
"One recent graduate started a new
baseball league, and another pur
chased an adult education school."
Students who decide to become
entrepreneurs tend be those with a
broad range of strengths rather than
those with expertise in one particu
lar area, said Edward Lazear, a pro
fessor of human resources manage
ment and economics.
"Generalists are more likely to be
entrepreneurs," he said. "Those who
are good in mostly one thing are not."
He explained, "Someone who is
great in finance but not great in
human resources may do better
