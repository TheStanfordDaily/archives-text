# Dorm helps new homeless shelter
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A center to serve Palo Alto's
homeless population is now a little
closer to reality, thanks to the ef
forts of Lantana's priority residents
and the Community Working
Group (CWG). Last night, the pub
lic service theme dorm presented a
check for $2,000 to representatives
from the CWG's Opportunity Cen
ter, a supportive housing facility,
which is set to begin construction
next week.
The money comes from Lan
tana's second "Arcade Night," one

of the dorm's largest fundraisers.
Around 120 Stanford students at
tended the Arcade Night earlier
this month and played arcade
games. Dance Dance Revolution,
Halo, karaoke and carnival activi
ties, all in the name of charity.
The Opportunity Center of the
Mid-peninsula will provide tempo
rary shelter and a range of social
and medical services to those peo
ple in need of assistance.
Though the Opportunity Center
is one of the CWG's largest projects
since its inception in 1998, the CWG
has been offering numerous services
to Palo Alto's homeless community.

The group was started after the
Urban Ministry of Palo Alto's
"drop-in center"— an area behind
the Red Cross building where
snacks and coffee were served on a
daily basis to the homeless commu
nity — was closed.
Many concerned Palo Alto resi
dents, including Sociology Assoc.
Prof. Don Barr and Linguistics
Prof. Tom Wasow, decided to form
a group in order to provide better
services to the local homeless.
In an interview with Stanford
Magazine, Barr articulated his
goals for the community center as a
safe zone for those in need and de-

scribed a possible
University connec
tion to the center.
"From a compas
sionate and from a
scholarly perspec
tive, there's a very
real potential for
the University to be
a leader in terms of
understanding
more about poverty
and homelessness,"
Barr said. "And stu
dents in service
learning projects
will be able to cre
ate information
about who these
people are, where
they come from,
why they're un
housed and what
happens to them
over time."
Wasow said his
previous experi
ence with the
homeless commu
nity spurred his in-

volvement in the CWG.
"I was active in working on the
issue of homelessness, having
served on a task force on the subject
set up by the City of Palo Alto's
Human Relations Commission a
few years earlier," Wasow said. "So
when Don Barr approached me
about joining the group, 1 immedi
ately said yes."
The process of building the Op
portunity Center has not been fast
or easy. Since the group's forma
tion, the CWG has acquired land on
Encina Way in Palo Alto and the
required government approvals to
construct the Opportunity Center.
The money raised by Lantana
house goes specifically towards an
endowment that will subsidize rents
and help cover maintenance of the
Center.
Lantana's involvement with the
CWG began last year when — as
part of the dorm's focus on home
lessness — Barr came to speak on
the issue.
"We decided as a group that we
wanted to do something to help
support the Opportunity Center
campaign," said Lantana Resident
Fellow A 1 Camarillo, a professor of
history. "Then Jackie Hoang, one
of the students, came up with the
idea of an arcade-night fundraiser."
Hoang, a junior and a Lantana
Focus Assistant, explained, "While
we chaired the event, Lantana's pri
ority residents helped us implement
the event through advertising, fly
ering, finding contact information
for outside sponsors and staffing
the event."
Lantana priority residents have
also been involved in several other

projects including support of Haven
House, a local family homeless shel
ter in Menlo Park. These residents
also work with groups across the
Bay Area such as Urban Ministries,
Habitat for Humanity and various
schools and learning centers.
In the future, Lantana staffers
said they hope to extend the dorm's
involvement to other community
service groups, as it recently did with
the CWG, and its residents remain
an integral part in making and sus
taining such connections.
"This was an entirely student run
event to raise funds for the Oppor
tunity Center," Camarillo said.
"The focus residents of Lantana
worked very hard to pull off a fun
event that raised a considerable
amount of money to donate to a
local cause."

projects including support of Haven
House, a local family homeless shel
ter in Menlo Park. These residents
also work with groups across the
Bay Area such as Urban Ministries,
Habitat for Humanity and various
schools and learning centers.
In the future, Lantana staffers
said they hope to extend the dorm's
involvement to other community
service groups, as it recently did with
the CWG, and its residents remain
an integral part in making and sus
taining such connections.
"This was an entirely student run
event to raise funds for the Oppor

"The focus residents of Lantana
worked very hard to pull off a fun
event that raised a considerable
amount of money to donate to a
local cause."
A center to serve Palo Alto's
homeless population is now a little
closer to reality, thanks to the ef
forts of Lantana's priority residents
and the Community Working
Group (CWG). Last night, the pub
lic service theme dorm presented a
check for $2,000 to representatives
from the CWG's Opportunity Cen
ter, a supportive housing facility,
which is set to begin construction
next week.
The money comes from Lan
tana's second "Arcade Night," one

of the dorm's largest fundraisers.
Around 120 Stanford students at
tended the Arcade Night earlier
this month and played arcade
games. Dance Dance Revolution,
Halo, karaoke and carnival activi
ties, all in the name of charity.
The Opportunity Center of the
Mid-peninsula will provide tempo
rary shelter and a range of social
and medical services to those peo
ple in need of assistance.
Though the Opportunity Center
is one of the CWG's largest projects
since its inception in 1998, the CWG
has been offering numerous services
to Palo Alto's homeless community.

The group was started after the
Urban Ministry of Palo Alto's
"drop-in center"— an area behind
the Red Cross building where
snacks and coffee were served on a
daily basis to the homeless commu
nity — was closed.
Many concerned Palo Alto resi
dents, including Sociology Assoc.
Prof. Don Barr and Linguistics
Prof. Tom Wasow, decided to form
a group in order to provide better
services to the local homeless.
In an interview with Stanford
Magazine, Barr articulated his
goals for the community center as a
safe zone for those in need and de-

scribed a possible
University connec
tion to the center.
"From a compas
sionate and from a
scholarly perspec
tive, there's a very
real potential for
the University to be
a leader in terms of
understanding
more about poverty
and homelessness,"
Barr said. "And stu
dents in service
learning projects
will be able to cre
ate information
about who these
people are, where
they come from,
why they're un
housed and what
happens to them
over time."
Wasow said his
previous experi
ence with the
homeless commu
nity spurred his in-

volvement in the CWG.
"I was active in working on the
issue of homelessness, having
served on a task force on the subject
set up by the City of Palo Alto's
Human Relations Commission a
few years earlier," Wasow said. "So
when Don Barr approached me
about joining the group, 1 immedi
ately said yes."
The process of building the Op
portunity Center has not been fast
or easy. Since the group's forma
tion, the CWG has acquired land on
Encina Way in Palo Alto and the
required government approvals to
construct the Opportunity Center.
The money raised by Lantana
house goes specifically towards an
endowment that will subsidize rents
and help cover maintenance of the
Center.
Lantana's involvement with the
CWG began last year when — as
part of the dorm's focus on home
lessness — Barr came to speak on
the issue.
"We decided as a group that we
wanted to do something to help
support the Opportunity Center
campaign," said Lantana Resident
Fellow A 1 Camarillo, a professor of
history. "Then Jackie Hoang, one
of the students, came up with the
idea of an arcade-night fundraiser."
Hoang, a junior and a Lantana
Focus Assistant, explained, "While
