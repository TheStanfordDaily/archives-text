# New field of astrobiology taking off
## 
### ERIN VITERO 
A new academic field attracting chemists, bi
ologists and geologists alike is gaining popularity
at Stanford. The Earth Systems program is plan
ning a new concentration in astrobiology, and
one undergraduate is pursuing am Individually
Designed Major (IDM) in that field.
Astrobiology is the interdisciplinary study of
the origins of life on Earth and the possibility of
life forms on other planets; it has only recently
started garnering widespread attention.
"Astrobiology is defined by three questions:
where we come from, if we are alone and where
do we go," said Alessandro Airo, president of the
Stanford Astrobiology Association.
Topics within astrobiology range from early
microbial life on Earth, the search for liquid water
under the ice shell of Europa and the possibility of
transforming Mars into a habitable planet.
With recent excitement over missions to

Mars along with the chance to be part of a new,
cutting-edge field, astrobiology draws students
from all disciplines.
"Astrobiology is a synthesis 0f... fields and
that's its great strength," said Kevin Hand, a
second-year graduate student in Geological
and Environmental Sciences (GES). "Get a ge
ologist, biologist, chemist, physicist, as
tronomer and sociologist together and see
where their interesting questions intersect.
That's the fun of astrobiology."
Junior Erin Lashnits is the first undergradu
ate at Stanford to design her own major in astro
biology. When she discovered her interest in the
subject during her freshman year, she realized
that many of the classes relevant to astrobiology
were taught in different departments and did not
fit into the Earth Systems curriculum. Lashnits
then decided to pursue an IDM.
"It's definitely been a lot of extra work to put
together an entire four-year course schedule for

myself," she said. "But it's been worth it."
Lashnits' interest in astrobiology was first
sparked by a course taught by two visiting pro
fessors from the NASA Ames Research Center.
Stanford's proximity to NASA Ames holds
promises for a bright future for astrobiology at
the University, said Airo, who is a GES doc
toral student.
"Traditionally Stanford is not the place
known for astrobiology, but the place is Ames,"
he added, "Right now, de facto, it is the head
quarters of NASA's astrobiology institute . ..
We are so close to Ames ... that we can benefit,
and we already do."
Many of the astrobiology-related classes at
Stanford are taught by scientists from Ames.
Courses related to astrobiology are offered in
the Departments of Geology, Biology, Physics
and Electrical Engineering. A course offered in
department of Geological and Earth Sciences, "GES
120: Physical Constraints of Evolution," provides an in
troduction to astrobiology for upper-level undergradu
ates as well as graduate students. It includes lectures by
Airo, scientists from NASA Ames. UC-Santa Cruz,
UC-Berkeley, as well as Stanford professors such as
Don Lowe —who is currently designing an astrobiology
and planetary science concentration within the earth

systems major.
Alexandra Krull, a second-year GES graduate stu
dent and a member of the Astrobiology Association,
said that astrobiology is a promising field and student in
terest will increase.
"I think there is quite a bit of student interest already
— the freshman and sophomore seminars that are of
fered are wildly popular, plus there are more and more
astrobiology programs starting up at universities all over
the U. 5.," she said. "1 think it will just grow as more mis
sions go out and more data comes back on all of the other
planets in our solar system. The more you find out about
something, the more you want to learn, and this field is
still so young."
