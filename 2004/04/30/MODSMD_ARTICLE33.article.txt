# City debates power plant
## 
### JACK LOVERIDGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With higher energy prices looming and a low
cost power contract expiring at the end of the
year, Palo Alto is weighing the option of building
its own natural-gas-fired power plant. Taking a
cue from Stanford, which has its own indepen
dent power plant, the city is looking to become
more energy self-sufficient.
A committee of four Palo Alto city council
members voted on April 14 to endorse a feasibil
ity study that will examine the logistics of con
structing a 50 megawatt plant in Palo Alto. With
a $300,000 to $500,000 price tag, the year-long
study will first examine the viability of such a pro
ject and then evaluate potential sites for the
plant. The committee's decision to begin the
study must be approved by the full council before
the two-phase process can begin. A date for that
vote has not been set at this time.
"It's going to be a long process from here,"
said Palo Alto Mayor Bern Beecham. "This pro
posal is still in a very early stage and many of the
details remain unclear. The final decision to con
struct the plant would most likely not be made for
the next one to two years. Stanford's participa
tion, whether in funding or researching such a
project, remains unclear at this point."
Palo Alto currently derives approximately 45
percent of its electricity from hydroelectric
sources, a figure that fluctuates depending on
seasonal precipitation. As the city's private con
tract with the Western Area Power Administra
tion expires, Palo Alto's deficit of secured energy
is expected to grow and prices could rise as much
as 50 percent in the long term. The proposed nat
ural gas plant, costing between $50 million and
$150 million, would produce 20 to 40 percent of
the city's electricity needs and could make up for
the deficit. It would be roughly the same size as
the Stanford-owned plant that provides electrici
ty for campus.

"It's certainly a viable project," said Petrole
um Engineering Prof. Roland Home. "Palo Alto
currently has an independent power system and,
in terms of retaining that independence, the city's
options are limited. Hydroelectric sources are
niaxed-out and solar power is not really feasible
for this location. Natural gas is, at least the mo
ment, a reasonably priced energy source, but
costs are highly susceptible to fluctuation."
No sites are currently under official consider
ation, but Michael Closson, executive director of
the environmental group Acterra, said he's con
cerned about the possibility that the city will

build the plant near the Baylands, a local wet
lands preserve,
"My worry is that Palo Alto might not be seri
ously exploring cleaner, less disruptive alterna
tives to natural gas," Closson said. "I want to give
Palo Alto a lot of credit for usually leading the
way on clean energy issues. I think they've put a
lot into finding alternatives to polluting sources,
but at the same time, it's incumbent upon them to
completely explore cleaner sources of energy in
this situation as well."

A new Palo Alto power plant, which has not yet reached the planning stage, would be similar to the
Stanford power plant.
