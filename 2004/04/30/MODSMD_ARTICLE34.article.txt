The Stanford Hawaii Club
would like you to stop making ex
cuses for all those times you
couldn't make it to your tropical
getaway, and settle for the next
best thing tomorrow. With spring
in full swing, the club will host its
24th Annual Luau tomorrow,
May 1, at 12:30 p.m. in the Man
zanita Courtyard.
In past years, the popular
event has attracted a large num
ber of students and local commu
nity members who gather to soak
up the sun and party Hawaii
style. While watching a variety of
dances and performances from
across the Pacific Islands, atten
dees can indulge in a traditional
atmosphere, cuisine and music.
"Luau is a place for people to
come out and have a nice time,"
said sophomore Aaron Quitugua-
Flores, one of five Hawaii Club
members chairing Luau this year.
"You can relax, eat and enjoy a
good show."
This year's theme "Ke Ala
Na'auao," which translates to
"Journeys of Enlightenment,"
will be interpreted on stage by
an eclectic mix of dances show
casing some of the most tradi
tional moves the Hawaiian and
Polynesian cultures have to
offer, interspersed with anec
dotes revealing the histories of
these native groups.

One of the major changes this
year was a push toward including
a show completely produced and
choreographed by Stanford stu
dents, rather than having profes
sional "kumu's," or teachers, put
the performances together. This
adds even more student involve
ment to the event that already
sees planning, dancing, and cook
ing done without any real profes
sional assistance.
Speaking of cooking, don't ex
pect to find Hawaiian pizza or
spam at the serving tables. Event
organizers said they are attempt
ing to provide a menu that is both
delicious and authentic. Among
some of the dishes people can ex
pect are lomi salmon, chicken
long rice, a variety of vegetarian
dishes and haupia, a type of co
conut pudding. Plus, of course,
the food that most people conjure
up when thinking about luaus â€”
ground-roasted kalua pork.
Club chair Jordan Lee, a se
nior, said that one of the most im
portant goals of the Hawaii Club
has been to share the culture of its
members with the Stanford com
munity, while deconstructing
some of the myths and cliches
that exist about the islands.
"It's still shocking to me that in
such an academically rigorous
place like Stanford, stereotypes
still exist," he said. "This is our
biggest event, and we'd like stu
dents to come out and learn more
about our cultures."
