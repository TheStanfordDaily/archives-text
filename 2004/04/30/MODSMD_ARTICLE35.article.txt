Cardinal football player Kenneth Tolon, a senior, was booked for
resisting arrest last Friday at a party on Maddux Avenue in Redwood
City, according to the Redwood City Police.
Officers arrived at the party of over 100 people after neighbors
complained about the noise.
The incident began when Tolon got into a verbal argument with a
friend who did not want him to drive while he was drunk.
"A fight, or more of an argument broke out," said Redwood City
Police spokeswoman Lynne Kettell.
When police tried to stop Tolon, he refused to cooperate.
Tolon was charged with resisting arrest. Kettell also said that Tolon
was drunk in public, but he was not arrested on the latter charge.
No formal charges had been filed as of Wednesday. according to the
San Jose Mercury News.
