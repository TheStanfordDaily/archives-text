# Nuclear material might be removed from Livermore lab

### ADEEL IGBAL DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. — In an effort to
cut down on possible targets for a nuclear terrorist at
tack. the U.S. Department of Energy may remove
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's plutonium
and uranium reserves — a move that could transform
the lab's core mission and its future under University of
California management.
In a congressional hearing Tuesday, representatives
from the General Accounting Office testified that a ter
rorist threat to a nuclear weapons facility may be far
greater than anticipated.
The Department of Energy has traditionally pre
pared for preventing theft of nuclear weapons materi
als, but an accounting office report released Tuesday
suggests that a suicide team of terrorists could barricade
themselves in the facility and detonate a makeshift nu
clear weapon — a concern for Livermore lab, which is
about 40 miles southeast of Berkeley.
"Without question, DOE nuclear warhead produc
tion plants, test facilities, research labs, storage loca
tions and decommissioned sites are attractive targets
for terrorists determined to turn our technology against
us, and willing to die while doing so," Rep. Christopher

Shays, R-Conn„ said at the hearing.
Consolidating nuclear material storage would im
prove security by reducing the number of sites and the
cost of protecting them. Shays said.
Lawrence Livermore lab officials dismissed the con
cerns about a possible terrorist attack, saying the lab is
addressing a number of credible threats and has in
creased its security force.
"We received the highest rating possible through the
Office of Security," said lab spokesperson Lynda
Seaver. "We feel the lab is very safe."
Removing Livermore lab's plutonium reserves
could fundamentally shift the mission of the lab, which
has focused on nuclear weapons defense since its incep
tion in the 19505.
The proposal could spark a shift in opinion about
whether the university should bid to manage the lab,
said Lawrence Pitts, chair of the system-wide Academ
ic Senate, UC's faculty decision-making body.
"If the labs changed their character in their totality,
would that change the bidding process? The answer is
absolutely sure," Pitts said.
Much of the argument against a Livermore lab con
tract bid has centered on whether a public university
should have a hand in developing and stockpiling nu
clear weapons.
