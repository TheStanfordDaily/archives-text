# Fac Sen discusses conflicts of interest
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate delayed a
conflict-of-interest resolution yes
terday afternoon after professors
agreed that $10,000 was too low a
limit for disclosure rules.
The debate centered on a
clause that would require faculty
to disclose investments not man
aged through a third party if they
were greater than $ 10,000. The re
visions to policy were sent back to
committee, which will consider
raising the limit to $100,000.
The purpose of the $10,000 dis
closure clause was to find any po
tential conflicts of interest that fac
ulty have and to minimize govern
ment regulation. But President
John Hennessy said that the clause
would actually do the opposite.
According to Hennessy, pro
fessors who do not know about
the stock that they hold or whose
stock may have appreciated over
the course of the year may make
purchases that would be illegal ac
cording to the new policy. This
sort of information would then

surface in an internal audit and at
tract bureaucratic attention.
"The clause will lead to inno
cent violations of the rules that
won't keep the government out
but invite more government regu
lation," Hennessy said.
Medicine Prof. Stephen
Fortmann said that he opposed
the clause because it would im
pose a large cost of disclosure
upon the faculty. He also ques
tioned whether owning over
$10,000 in a company compro
mises a professor's commitment
to the University.
The senate also debated rules
about professors taking on full
time managerial jobs during sab
batical leave. Although Provost
John Etchemendy said that the
proposed policy would not change
existing rules. Assoc. Prof. Phyllis
Gardner expressed concern about
the wording.
"There are benefits to a man
agerial role," Gardner said, "Peo
ple learn things in practice that
they could not learn in academia
and they take that knowledge
back to Stanford."
