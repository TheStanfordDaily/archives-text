## Lessons in life 
### 
For all of us in the graduating Class of 2004, now is a
time of reflection. We've been in school for at least 18
loooooooooooong years, longer if you couldn't mem
orize your multiplication tables in third grade and had
to be held back.
From reading to writing to 'rithmitic, we've covered it all.
Stanford has been a place to dig deep within our minds and teach
ourselves to fly. But now that Stanford is almost behind us, we
can t help but ask ourselves, has our education given us eveiy
thing we need to make this transition into life?
It's obvious that there are a few holes in our skill set. Those late

nights writing papers, those end
less hours in lab, those early morn
ing practices — all of these times
helped us improve in some way.
But think about it, can you
make yourself a decent meal that
doesn't involve the 99-cent menu
at Jack in the Box? Can you mix
yourself a drink that you definite
ly will need after a long day of
work? Can you tell the difference
between a Chardonnay and a
Cabernet Sauvignon? Do you

know how to do anything with money other than spend it?
If you've answered no to any of these questions, don't worry
your pretty little head. The Senior Class presidents have organized
a program called Senior Essentials. The program consists of a se
ries of classes to teach all of us febo seniors some real life basic
skills. Over the next couple of weeks, as you start to pack up your
room, finish your thesis and finally go home with that girf you
thought was cute at a Theta Chi party sophomore year, attend
some of these Senior Essential workshops. Here's why you should:
As much as you like to complain about the quality of food
served in your dining hall, keep in mind that the food in said din
ing hall was prepared by someone who is supposed to know how
to cook. Do you know how to cook? For any of you who have
eaten at Suites Sunday nights, you know this isn't a problem for
Courtney. But for Caroline and many of you like her, it's an en
tirely different story. Did you know that you can burn pasta? Well
neither did Caroline until sophomore year when she lived in Mir
rielees and her idea of cooking was heating pre-made pasta sauce.
And as much as you crave Arby's or In N' Out, or as much as you
enjoy your Jack attack in the middle of the night, keep in mind that
fast food gets old really quick when you eat it morning, noon and
night. (Although McDonald's breakfast does border on gourmet.)
Fortunately, as part of Senior Essentials, the Stanford Cook
ing Club and Stanford Dining are holding a demonstration at the
Clark Center on Monday, May 3 to show you some of the basics
of cooking.
You've spent the past four years drinking yourself silly.
Don't worry; that won't stop in the real world. But you can't
keep depending on free frat party beer or Winner's Cup to take
you there. You need to start drinking respectable drinks, even if
you're not respectable. Nothing shows lack of culture more than
when you sit down at a business function and order a white zin
fandel. If you think white zin is okay, you have a lot to learn. Go
to the wine tasting event on Thursday, May 20 at 8 p.m. and the
bartending lesson tonight at 7:30 p.m. at Suites.
There's more to managing your personal finances than just
paying your monthly ITSS bill, which, by the way, is now online!
We're the worst people to talk with about sage investment
strategies, since our definition of a good investment is buying a
dress that you may wear more than once. But if you want to learn
the real stuff, go to the finance panel on Finance on Monday,
May 17 at 7 p.m.
Stanford teaches us a lot, in and out of the classroom. But there
are some skills that you just can't get by paying $40,000 a year for
your education. Senior Essentials should pick up the SLAC.

Shout out to Jason Haas, Courtaline's Person of the Week! Keep
up the good work! E-mail us at cciccone@stanford.edu and
chrigham@stanford.edu if you think you deserve to be Person of
the Week.
