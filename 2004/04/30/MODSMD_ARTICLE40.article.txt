Armed with posters, buttons
and matching T-shirts, 15 mem
bers of Stanford Students for
Choice took to the streets of
Washington D.C. on Sunday,
April 24 as participants in The
March for Women's Lives. The
march, sponsored by various na
tional women's organizations,
drew over one million partici
pants wanting to voice their con
cerns about the Bush administra
tion's conservative policy on re
productive rights.
"The goal of the march was to
bring people together to show
the nation that the pro-choice
movement is strong and mobi
lized and that reproductive
rights issues are going to be a big
factor in the upcoming elec
tion," said senior Margaret
Reynolds, a participant in the
march and co-head of Stanford
Students for Choice.
Organizers estimate that there
were over 1.15 million people in
attendance, making it the largest
pro-choice march in history, and
generating a lot of national
media coverage.
"It was incredible to look
ahead and behind and to both
sides, only to be surrounded by
supporters â€” everyone marching
for the same cause," said senior
Emily Flynn.
The event drew not only dedi
cated Stanford students, but peo
ple of different backgrounds from
across the country.
"The most inspiring part of the
march was its diversity, particu
larly because it was multi-genera
tional: Grandmothers, mothers,
and daughters came together to
assert the importance of repro
ductive rights for everyone,"
Reynolds said.
The Stanford participants paid
for the trip with their own person
al funds.
Flynn hopes that their partici
pation in the march will have a
positive effect on the Stanford
community.
"I think the march gave us new
inspiration to reach out to more
Stanford students and drive
home the message that reproduc
tive rights are on the line in this
country more than ever before,"
Flynn said.
Although there were some

plane and in airports heading back
to California, people would see the
posters and pins we were carrying
and would stop to say 'thank you

for going to the march' or ask how
it was or comment on how much
they had wanted to go," Flynn said.

of voter registration and awareness

positive about the experience.
"The feeling was one of over
whelming power and support . . .
and relief that so many people

were mobilized and realized the
dangers this administration
poses to women's health,"
Reynolds said.
Stanford Students for Choice
was founded in 1999 and current
ly has over 250 people on its
mailing list. They hold weekly
meetings and sponsor many on
campus events, including the re
cent visit of Sarah Weddington,
the Roe v. Wade lawyer, whom
they sponsored in conjunction
with the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
Their next major project is to
prepare for the upcoming
November election.
"We are gearing up to do a
lot of voter registration and
awareness-raising events aimed
at addressing the importance
of November's election. The
message on Sunday was: Vote,
vote, vote and don't give up,"
Reynolds said.
