## Minority conference is promising 
### 
Stanford's first-ever Minority Alumni
Conference, "Community, Diversity and
Excellence," has the potential to engage
in meaningful ways alumni and students
of color who wish to address challenges that the
Stanford community continues to face.
Stanford's excellence in many fields — from
engineering to the quality of student affairs —
is unquestionable and often unparalleled. In
recent years, our excellence also has been real
ized through the racial diversity of our student
and, by extension, our alumni populations.
This conference provides a space to celebrate
these accomplishments as a community. Per
haps more importantly, it also offers an oppor
tunity to solidify commitments and a space to
take action to meet ongoing challenges such as
faculty diversity.
The conference underscores the commit
ment by top University leadership to engage
alumni of color. It was Isaac Stein, the chair of
the Board of Trustees, who convened the sec
ond Taskforce on Minority Alumni Relations
that began exploring the possibility of a confer
ence. Prof. Charles Ogletree, a former trustee,
agreed out of his dedication to its vision to
chair this taskforce and to provide leadership
on its projects. And University President John
Hennessy contributed one million dollars to en
sure the conference's funding and programmat
ic success.
Students and alumni alike are in position to

reap the benefits of this conference. For stu
dents— students of color in particular — this
weekend represents an opportunity to connect
with and learn from alumni who have addressed
issues that continue to affect the Stanford com
munity (e.g. funding of community program
ming such as the Stanford Pow-wow or Asian
American student community space concerns.)
Alumni, in turn, will have the opportunity to
hear from the current generation of students,
who are part of the legacy of their efforts. These
students represent both what has changed and
what still needs to change at Stanford. Alumni
hopefully will join with these students to raise
funds for the community at El Centro Chicano's
25th Anniversary Mariachi Benefit Concert this
weekend, and with the public launching of the
Bigger Black Community Services Center pro
ject. Both of these represent new and exciting
opportunities for alumni to contribute to com
munities that have grown and blossomed out of
their advocacy efforts.
The Minority Alumni Conference, which is
the fruition of hundreds of community members'
vision and dedication, can provide current and
future alumni with meaningful opportunities to
acquire a greater sense of ownership in the Uni
versity — ownership ranging from prominence
in the structure of University governance to
partnership in grassroots student funding ef
forts. We encourage all members of the Stanford
community to realize these opportunities.
