# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Bush: Can't live with him 
### 
I have a conservative friend. I
pester her with the same nag
ging question every time we
meet: "Do you still like
George W. Bush? ... Still?"
Can I help it? I honestly can't
fathom how a reasonable person
could think positively of the man.
She explained to me that, while
John Kerry is someone who un
derstands the nuances of a situa
tion, Bush is better suited to be
president because he sees the
world in black and white (or good
and evil, Laverne and Shirley,
etc.), and a president needs to be
able to make quick decisions and
stick to his judgments.
1 think of it this way: You can go
hunting with John Kerry and you
might bring home a duck or two for
dinner. On the other hand. Bush
will shoot down a few hefty quarter
ton bucks, but after the smoke
clears, you find out he also killed
your dad. Whoops.
Bush is so skilled with decisions
that he can make them in advance.
When Tim Russert questioned him
on "Meet the Press" about the pre
emptive invasion of Iraq, our deci
sive leader stressed that Sept. 11
changed the way America had to
deal with the world.
True, but according to members
of his staff, he was preparing to in
vade Iraq as soon as he stepped into
office — well before Sept. 11. Such
clairvoyance.
I admit — I was gunning for the
guy to trip up and look like his
usual foolish self on that Feb. 8 in
terview. But good grief. I should be
careful what I wish for. Bush
seemed to have no grasp of any of
the vital information that, by now,
he ought to know like the back of
his monkey. He performed so dis
gracefully that I felt embarrassed.
And sad.
According to Richard Clarke,
presidential briefs regularly pass
through Vice President Dick Ch
eney's hands before they get to the
Oval Office. I'm not saying that Dick
manhandles Bush's tighty-whiteys,
I'm saying that he's the one who
wears the pants in the relationship.
But then when it comes to inves
tigations, Bush and Cheney are like
obnoxious bosom buddies in a
backyard football draft. You can't
pick just one because they come "as
a package."
The New York Times' columnist
David Brooks complained in a
piece this week entitled "20/20
Hindsight" that these backward
looking investigations are need
lessly consuming too much of

Bush's vital time. (Don't fret, Mr.
Brooks. NASCAR season is in a
lull right now.)
Personally, I don't mind Bush
braking for investigations. I mean,
he's already taken more vacation

time than anyone
in the history of
presidents. This
fortunate son of
sons likes to play
cowboy for
weeks at a time
on his Texan
mega-ranch. It's
not that he's
tough like a cow-

boy (though lying through the teeth
is sort of tough); it's that, like a lone
ranger, he doesn't keep friends.
Cases in point: Paul O'Neill,
Richard Clarke, Europe, Asia, 50
percent of the United States and
that whore Mother Earth.
If he can stop the executive
clock for playing ranchero in the
"Don't Mess" state, then maybe he
can take a breather for more im
portant things.
First, he ought to go sip tea and
eat cake with Queen Elizabeth 11.
The two could chitchat about life as
figureheads without clout.
Then they can invite an amor
phous glob of wealthy energy execs
and go splurge at The Cheesecake
Factory, while Bush foots the bill
with a campaign chest the size of his
gall in cubits. After all, he won't need
the money for the election. Bush
lovers are the cheapest voters on the
bloc and they come in three styles:
1) Those who ignore the news
(like Bush).
2) Those who love the man uncon
ditionally — no matter how far down
the drain they ride (also like Bush).
3) Terrorists.
Seriously, why would terrorists
want Bush out of office? They
know that, in terms of inciting ha
tred for America, bin Laden is the
chafing of the tag on a cotton T
shirt while Bush is the oozy dis
charge of fiery red hives from an in
tergalactic STD of the year 2099.
And bin Laden doesn't mind taking
a backseat to non-imminent threats
like Saddam Hussein.
Another task for Bush's to-do
list should be to buy the book "Sup
porting Our Troops for Dummies."
Pardon my French, but that just
ain't his forte.
He doesn't support troops in
post-service: In the heat of political
battle, he releases his attack force of
GOP loyalists to question the patri
otism of honorable veterans like
Max Cleland, John McCain, John

Kerry and Wesley Clark (perhaps
he's just jealous).
He doesn't support troops dur
ing their service: He's lowered the
pay of the troops, extended their
stays and still lounges lazily about
while he ought to be swallowing his
pride and amassing a real interna
tional coalition.
He doesn't support troops pre
service: When a commander in
chief takes the country to war, he's
got some homework to do — as
sessing the situation, estimating the
cost and devising some kind of opti
mal strategy to prevent the media
from wearing out the word "quag
mire." But, in keeping with the low
academic standards of his youth.
Bush is satisfied with performance
that will be lucky to get a "C" after
grade inflation.
However, Bush does express his
gratitude for the men and women of
the armed forces. He says, "Every
person willing to sacrifice for this
country deserves our praise." Ap
parently he's not on the list of peo
ple willing to sacrifice. Instead of
doing his part to minimize the num
ber of troops who make the Ulti
mate Sacrifice, he minimizes the
number of troops whose coffins get
their pictures in the newspaper.
Thanks.
Bush supports the troops in the
same way 1 supported Alf on Hal
loween 12 years ago. Wide-eyed
with delight, he puts on his fancy
dress and rides on a great big air
craft carrier, throws a great big
party and flies a great big banner
declaring the great big mission "ac
complished."
A year later, the word "not" is
beaten relentlessly into our already
bruised brains — a cankerous rack
et of car bombs, firefights and insur
gency ricochets off our foreheads
nightly during the 10 o'clock news.
Ironically, if Bush, the guy who
questioned the legitimacy of the
United Nations for questioning the
legitimacy of his intelligence,
doesn't win the presidential election
in November, then he will have
never won a presidential election.
I'll vote to give him the time off.
