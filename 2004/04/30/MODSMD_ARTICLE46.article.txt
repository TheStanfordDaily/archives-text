The Daily's depression ads
were insensitive
As someone who struggles daily
with depression, I was offended by
yesterday's ad (which appeared not
once, hut twice) picturing a woman
in her underwear along with the slo
gan, "It's not just a bad day. De
pression: Treat it as if your life de
pended on it."
Depression is in no way repre
sented by this image of a thin, pouty,
platinum-blonde babe with tousled
hair, lounging in bed in nothing but
a bra. The Daily staff seems to spend
a lot of time creating sarcastic filler,
which is often funny, but to joke
about something like depression is
tasteless and thoughtless.
If this ad was actually created and
paid for by an individual or organi
zation, 1 am curious to know why
this was thought to be appropriate.
The slogan is part of the public
awareness campaign of Suicide
Awareness Voices of Education
(SAVE), whose mission "is to edu
cate about suicide prevention, elim
inate stigma and support those
touched by suicide." I sincerely
doubt SAVE would pair such a pic

ture with their slogan.
Although many more people
seek help for depression today
than they did a generation ago, it is
still a disease that is not free of stig
ma. 1 have been determined not to
be ashamed to admit that I struggle
with depression, but it is not always
easy to do so. This ad does nothing
to reassure me and others like me
that we are not alone, that there
are ways to get help and that there
are people who will take our feel
ings seriously. It belittles the gravi
ty of the disease, and presents it as
something that is better joked
about than treated as a legitimate
health problem.
The Daily should have the re
sponsibility and the decency not to
print such material. And to those of
you reading this who may be strug
gling with feelings of depression,
please ignore the ad and believe that
things can and will get better.

As an avid player of the Game, I

was thrilled to read Friday's article
alerting local residents they can play
The Game in San Francisco ("The
Game goes public," April 23).
I am happy to let you know that
you can also play The Game in any
other city. 1 graduated from Stan
ford last year and started a New
York-based company called Per
plex that also plans Games. We do
so primarily for large companies as
a teambuilding event, but we also
planned the Games that Branner
and Lantana will be starting today,
for example.
If you're interested in setting up a
Game in your city, our Web site is
http://www.PerplexLLC.com. Last
year, as a student, I designed the
Oct. 26, 2002 Game, which drew 50
students who were able to solve our
registration clue (currently posted
on our Web site).
I have wonderful memories of
playing the Game at Stanford on
multiple occasions, and I can defi
nitely assure you that the tradition is
alive and well with the current class
of students.
