## Julie's got a shout-out to all the rejects 
### 
Poor Stanford guys. Social dysfunction
reached a new height when sports columnist
Dan McCarthy published an open love / hate
letter to me on Wednesday, in lieu of his regu
lar column.
Dan, 1 can follow the standings, 1 do look
pretty in pink, but I'm taken. Thanks any
way, though!
Dan isn't the only reject at Stanford this
week. As hundreds of students who have been
biting their nails since fall waiting to hear from
law school and . . . you know, other grad
schools, received their fated letters this week,
many of us felt rejection for the first time in our
lives. Hey, Chris Lewis didn't even get drafted
lor the NFL. So this column goes out to all those
Stanford kids who have felt rejection in the last
couple of weeks.
1 didn't even apply to anything, so I
didn't get any rejection letters. It can still
make vou feel kind of un-

wanted, though, when your
peers are Rhodes scholars
and training Olympians
and you're looking at un
paid internships in Moun
tain View. Which I swear
I'm not.
Rejection sucks. I almost
feel like rejection in athletic
competitions is worse than
academic or social rejec-

tion. At least with grad schools or had dates,
you can write them off â€” hey, they don't
even know me! But with NFL prospective
player profiles like "loses his balance when
trying to escape double-team blocking" or
"not fast enough to compensate for his s'B"
stature," at least you know why they didn't
want you, right?
Maybe. Everything is some vague mix of
ability, determination and knowing people. In
some order.
We live in a society where a semi-suc
cessiul movie from the mid-90s dictates our
viewpoint that if you just try hard enough
and really keep trying, you'll get there.
Wherever the hell "there" is. Look at Rudy:
He really, really wanted to play on Notre
Dame's football team, although he was just
a groundskeeper and went to city college
and by the end of the movie, the entire foot
ball stadium plus myself is chanting,
"RUDY! RUDY!"
Was Rudy any kind of viable football play
er? Ehh. Do we prefer Sean Astin as a hobbit?
Questionable. But Rudv got a whole movie
made about him, didn't he?
This is the part where we extract a very twist
ed and not-so-logical moral from the movie: If
you put yourself as the main character in your
own life, you're bound to at least go somewhere
and not fade into the background as an uninter
esting peripheral character. This is also known
as the "don't take no for an answer" strategy,
and people who adopt it either end up success
ful or delusional.
If we could extract something useful out of
"Jerry Maguire," most people would probably
cite the sex scene where Tom Cruise pins his
girlfriend up against a door. And the "Show
me the money!" line, which is about as played
out as "Can't we all just get along?" Jerry
Maguire, of course, is based on the real life of
Leigh Steinberg, one of the biggest sports
agents of our time.
Incidentally, Steinberg is also Chris Lewis's
agent. This is like having a really damn good let
ter of recommendation, for all the grad school
rejects licking your wounds. You can have the
best people on your side and still get rejected.
Congratulations to Stanford players Amon
Gordon, Kirk Chambers and Drew Caylor, by
the way. who become fifth- and sixth-round
picks. Lewis might get a spot anyway, floating
around as a rookie free agent.
As he told USA TODAY, "I'm just look
ing for any way in the door to prove to people
I'm worthy of being a starting quarterback in
the league."
Some might call it delusional, some
might tag Lewis for success, but I would def
initely pay to see his movie. Let's place bets
today and I guarantee you this guy gets into
that door.
For a more accessible example of extreme
determination: My friend's brother was on his
high school wrestling team and hated it. Quit
ting was not an option, nor did he want to com
pete in an upcoming tournament that every
one walked away from damaged and bleeding.
So he practiced diligently for three weeks
without showering or so much as rinsing off
his face, till he finally contracted ringworm
and disqualified himself.
He got where he wanted to go.
So you didn't get in? Screw it. So you can
spend weeks mulling over why you didn't get in
and whether your LSAT score was a point
below the average, or you can suck up and move
on to the next step, wherever that is. Hell, send
me love letters.
