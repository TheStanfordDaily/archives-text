# Track preps for Big Meet
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford and California return to their ri
valry this weekend on the track as the two
teams clash in the 110 th men's and 29th
women's Big Meet.
This year, both sides are looking at a win
and a loss. For the Cardinal, it appears as if a
fourth consecutive sweep of the team titles
will not he possible.
Cal comes to the meet with its most tal
ented men's squad in years and should have
an easy time with the Cardinal, which is not
only lacking in the sprints and field events but
is fielding a distance squad that may not in
clude its Olympic hopefuls, who will race
tonight at the Cardinal Invitational.
On the women's side of things, the out
look is brighter for the Cardinal, which
brings one of the nation's top all-around
programs to Edwards Stadium in Berke
ley tomorrow.
The women are looking to extend their
win streak to a record four straight over
the Bears.
"Right now, 1 have one winning and one
losing," said Cal head coach Chris Huffans.
"But anything can happen at the Big Meet."
And he speaks the truth.
The Stanford men began their current
three-win streak with a unexpected 82-81 vic
tory over the heavily favored Bears in 2001. It
would take another miracle like that day to
keep the men's win streak alive.
"This is a rebuilding year for us," said Stan
ford men's head coach Robert Weir. "The
fact is, they have a better team right now."
And the Cardinal Invitational tonight will
not help matters.
Stanford has no fewer than four men with
legitimate Olympic hopes and many others
who have goals of being elite runners, and
they will compete against some of the top dis
tance runners in world tonight, which means
those runners may not be in top form for Cal
the next day.
"Not to take anything away from Cal or
the Big Meet, but Cal is the favorite, and this

is an Olympic year," Weir said. "I believe 1
am doing what is best for our athletes who are
focused on the Olympic trials."
But the men's competition will not go with
out some big performances for the Cardinal.
Junior Nick Sebes will take on Cal's
Darren Woods and Toby Atawo at 400
and 200 meters, respectively. Sebes ran
second to Woods at an earlier meet at Cal
and placed third in the 400 at the compet
itive Mt. San Antonio College Relays over
Woods and Atawo.
Sophomore Will O'Neill has been steadily
improving his throws in the shot and discus
over the last two weeks and is setting himself
up for some big throws this weekend.
In the javelin, senior Jay Goff should be
the favorite, having thrown 217 feet, five
inches already this season.
In the distance races, despite losing run
ners to the Cardinal Invitational, Stanford
should still be able to dominate the Bears.
The tone for the women's meet was set
last weekend at the Penn Relays when
Stanford and Cal were both entered in the
400 relay and finished 1-2, respectively,
outdistancing the rest of the field by a sig
nificant margin.
"When we lined up. Stanford was in lane
three, Cal was in lane eight," Huffans said.
"No one else in the race mattered. It was just
the two teams. Cal versus Stanford."
And just as the Cardinal won in Penn
sylvania, they should beat the Bears this
weekend, but not without Cal putting up
a fight.
In the sprints, Cal has standout Antonette
Carter. But she will be hard-pressed for vic
tory against one of the deepest sprint squads
in the nation.
Sophomore Nashonme Johnson was an
NCAA qualifier last year at 200 and is one of
the Pacific-10 Conference's best 400 runners,
while freshmen Ashley Freeman and Keisha
Gaines are two of the best Stanford freshmen
ever at 400 meters.

The Big Meet looks to be a split this year, as tfie Cardinal women's squad and the Golden
Bears men's team could be unstoppable.
Davis has made some signif
icant strides and should
challenge for victories in the
100 and 200 while senior
Lindsey Johnson will look to
take the 100- and 400-meter
hurdle titles.
In the weight events, Cal's
Sheni Russell will be a threat.
Having recently set the Cali
fornia school record in the
discus, Russell may be un
stoppable in her event.
She will go up against
Stanford senior Jillian
Camarena, an All-Ameri
can at both the shot and
the discus.
In the distance races, Cal's
Bridget Duffy may be the
only real competition to the
Cardinal. With the top 800-,
1,500-, and 5,000-meter run

ners in the Pac-10, Stanford is
favored to secure victories in
the distance races.
Duffy, however, will not
be overlooked, having run a
4:22 and 2:09 1500-meter
and 800-meter double in the
same day.
"It should be a good
meet," said Stanford
women's head coach
Edrick Floreal. "We're
excited for it. It will be a
chance to really compete
as a team."
The scoring for the meet
will be standard dual scoring,
in which athletes get five
points for first place, three
for second and one for third
in individual events.
The relays are winner
take-all, with five points for
tirst and zero for second.
The meet starts at 10:30
a.m. tomorrw at Edwards
Stadium in Berkeley with
the field events, while run
ning begins at 1 p.m. with
the women's steeplechase.

Junior Nick Sebes will take on Cal's
Darren Woods and Toby Atawo at 400
and 200 meters, respectively. Sebes ran
second to Woods at an earlier meet at Cal
and placed third in the 400 at the compet
itive Mt. San Antonio College Relays over
Woods and Atawo.
Sophomore Will O'Neill has been steadily
improving his throws in the shot and discus
over the last two weeks and is setting himself
up for some big throws this weekend.
In the javelin, senior Jay Goff should be
the favorite, having thrown 217 feet, five
inches already this season.
In the distance races, despite losing run
ners to the Cardinal Invitational, Stanford
should still be able to dominate the Bears.
The tone for the women's meet was set
last weekend at the Penn Relays when
Stanford and Cal were both entered in the
400 relay and finished 1-2, respectively,
outdistancing the rest of the field by a sig
nificant margin.
"When we lined up. Stanford was in lane
three, Cal was in lane eight," Huffans said.
"No one else in the race mattered. It was just
the two teams. Cal versus Stanford."
And just as the Cardinal won in Penn
sylvania, they should beat the Bears this
weekend, but not without Cal putting up
a fight.
In the sprints, Cal has standout Antonette
Carter. But she will be hard-pressed for vic
tory against one of the deepest sprint squads
in the nation.
Sophomore Nashonme Johnson was an
NCAA qualifier last year at 200 and is one of
the Pacific-10 Conference's best 400 runners,
while freshmen Ashley Freeman and Keisha

ever at 400 meters.

The Big Meet looks to be a split this year, as tfie Cardinal women's squad and the Golden
Bears men's team could be unstoppable.
Davis has made some signif
icant strides and should
challenge for victories in the
100 and 200 while senior
Lindsey Johnson will look to
take the 100- and 400-meter
hurdle titles.
In the weight events, Cal's
Sheni Russell will be a threat.
Having recently set the Cali
fornia school record in the
discus, Russell may be un
stoppable in her event.
She will go up against
Stanford senior Jillian
Camarena, an All-Ameri
can at both the shot and
the discus.
In the distance races, Cal's
Bridget Duffy may be the
only real competition to the
Cardinal. With the top 800-,
1,500-, and 5,000-meter run

ners in the Pac-10, Stanford is
favored to secure victories in
the distance races.
Duffy, however, will not
be overlooked, having run a
4:22 and 2:09 1500-meter
and 800-meter double in the
same day.
"It should be a good
meet," said Stanford
women's head coach
Edrick Floreal. "We're
excited for it. It will be a
chance to really compete
as a team."
The scoring for the meet
will be standard dual scoring,
in which athletes get five
points for first place, three
for second and one for third
in individual events.
The relays are winner
take-all, with five points for
tirst and zero for second.
The meet starts at 10:30
a.m. tomorrw at Edwards
Stadium in Berkeley with
the field events, while run
ning begins at 1 p.m. with
the women's steeplechase.
Stanford and California return to their ri
valry this weekend on the track as the two
teams clash in the 110 th men's and 29th
women's Big Meet.
This year, both sides are looking at a win
and a loss. For the Cardinal, it appears as if a
fourth consecutive sweep of the team titles
will not he possible.
Cal comes to the meet with its most tal
ented men's squad in years and should have
an easy time with the Cardinal, which is not
only lacking in the sprints and field events but
is fielding a distance squad that may not in
clude its Olympic hopefuls, who will race
tonight at the Cardinal Invitational.
On the women's side of things, the out
look is brighter for the Cardinal, which
brings one of the nation's top all-around
programs to Edwards Stadium in Berke
ley tomorrow.
The women are looking to extend their
win streak to a record four straight over
the Bears.
"Right now, 1 have one winning and one
losing," said Cal head coach Chris Huffans.
"But anything can happen at the Big Meet."
And he speaks the truth.
The Stanford men began their current
three-win streak with a unexpected 82-81 vic
tory over the heavily favored Bears in 2001. It
would take another miracle like that day to
keep the men's win streak alive.
"This is a rebuilding year for us," said Stan
ford men's head coach Robert Weir. "The
fact is, they have a better team right now."
And the Cardinal Invitational tonight will
not help matters.
Stanford has no fewer than four men with
legitimate Olympic hopes and many others
who have goals of being elite runners, and
they will compete against some of the top dis
tance runners in world tonight, which means
those runners may not be in top form for Cal
the next day.
"Not to take anything away from Cal or
the Big Meet, but Cal is the favorite, and this

is an Olympic year," Weir said. "I believe 1
am doing what is best for our athletes who are
focused on the Olympic trials."
But the men's competition will not go with
out some big performances for the Cardinal.
Junior Nick Sebes will take on Cal's
Darren Woods and Toby Atawo at 400
