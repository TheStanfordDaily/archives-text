# Track preps for Big Meet

### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford and California return to their ri
valry this weekend on the track as the two
teams clash in the 110 th men's and 29th
women's Big Meet.
This year, both sides are looking at a win
and a loss. For the Cardinal, it appears as if a
fourth consecutive sweep of the team titles
will not he possible.
Cal comes to the meet with its most tal
ented men's squad in years and should have
an easy time with the Cardinal, which is not
only lacking in the sprints and field events but
is fielding a distance squad that may not in
clude its Olympic hopefuls, who will race
tonight at the Cardinal Invitational.
On the women's side of things, the out
look is brighter for the Cardinal, which
brings one of the nation's top all-around
programs to Edwards Stadium in Berke
ley tomorrow.
The women are looking to extend their
win streak to a record four straight over
the Bears.
"Right now, 1 have one winning and one
losing," said Cal head coach Chris Huffans.
"But anything can happen at the Big Meet."
And he speaks the truth.
The Stanford men began their current
three-win streak with a unexpected 82-81 vic
tory over the heavily favored Bears in 2001. It
would take another miracle like that day to
keep the men's win streak alive.
"This is a rebuilding year for us," said Stan
ford men's head coach Robert Weir. "The
fact is, they have a better team right now."
And the Cardinal Invitational tonight will
not help matters.
Stanford has no fewer than four men with
legitimate Olympic hopes and many others
who have goals of being elite runners, and
they will compete against some of the top dis
tance runners in world tonight, which means
those runners may not be in top form for Cal
the next day.
"Not to take anything away from Cal or
the Big Meet, but Cal is the favorite, and this

is an Olympic year," Weir said. "I believe 1
am doing what is best for our athletes who are
focused on the Olympic trials."
But the men's competition will not go with
out some big performances for the Cardinal.
Junior Nick Sebes will take on Cal's
Darren Woods and Toby Atawo at 400
and 200 meters, respectively. Sebes ran
second to Woods at an earlier meet at Cal
and placed third in the 400 at the compet
itive Mt. San Antonio College Relays over
Woods and Atawo.
Sophomore Will O'Neill has been steadily
improving his throws in the shot and discus
over the last two weeks and is setting himself
up for some big throws this weekend.
In the javelin, senior Jay Goff should be
the favorite, having thrown 217 feet, five
inches already this season.
In the distance races, despite losing run
ners to the Cardinal Invitational, Stanford
should still be able to dominate the Bears.
The tone for the women's meet was set
last weekend at the Penn Relays when
Stanford and Cal were both entered in the
400 relay and finished 1-2, respectively,
outdistancing the rest of the field by a sig
nificant margin.
"When we lined up. Stanford was in lane
three, Cal was in lane eight," Huffans said.
"No one else in the race mattered. It was just
the two teams. Cal versus Stanford."
And just as the Cardinal won in Penn
sylvania, they should beat the Bears this
weekend, but not without Cal putting up
a fight.
In the sprints, Cal has standout Antonette
Carter. But she will be hard-pressed for vic
tory against one of the deepest sprint squads
in the nation.
Sophomore Nashonme Johnson was an
NCAA qualifier last year at 200 and is one of
the Pacific-10 Conference's best 400 runners,
while freshmen Ashley Freeman and Keisha
Gaines are two of the best Stanford freshmen
ever at 400 meters.
In the shorter sprints, freshman Janice

Bears men's team could be unstoppable.
