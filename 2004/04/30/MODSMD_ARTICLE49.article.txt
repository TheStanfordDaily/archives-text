# Card caps regular season at Georgetown
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After scoring half the number of goals that No. 5 Loy
ola College scored last Saturday, the unranked Stanford
women's lacrosse team is looking for a better outcome this
weekend in Washington. D.C. as it faces No. 7 George
town in its last game of the regular season.
The Cardinal (8-7,4-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) is 2-1 on the road, while the Hoyas are 6-1 on their
own turf this season, with their only home loss coming at
the hands of top-ranked Princeton. Stanford is 26-18 on
the road since 1997 and has only faced Georgetown on one
other occasion, losing to the Hoyas last year at Maloney
Field, 15-7.
However, both teams are just coming off defeats â€”
Stanford lost to the Greyhounds last Saturday and
Georgetown fell to No. 8 James Madison on Tuesday.
Look for Stanford to prey on any hesitation Georgetown
may have as a result of its loss to a lower-ranked team.
In addition to Tuesday's loss to James Madison and its
loss to Princeton earlier this season, Georgetown has only
been defeated by No. 4 Maryland and No. 18 Penn State.
The team has posted 10 wins this year, with victories over
several ranked teams, including a close defeat of No. 5
Duke back in March.
While the Cardinal dropped out of the I WLCA's top 20
this week, Stanford ranks 20th in the nation in scoring de
fense, allowing an average of 8.93 goals per game. Stan
ford's defense has its work cut out for it this weekend, as
the Hoyas have five attackers that have scored at least 20

Stanford will play its final regular season game at Georgetown this weekend. The Hoyas have been solid this season at
home, dropping only one game to top-ranked Princeton.
