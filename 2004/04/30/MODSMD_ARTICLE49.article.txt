# Card caps regular season at Georgetown
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After scoring half the number of goals that No. 5 Loy
ola College scored last Saturday, the unranked Stanford
women's lacrosse team is looking for a better outcome this
weekend in Washington. D.C. as it faces No. 7 George
town in its last game of the regular season.
The Cardinal (8-7,4-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) is 2-1 on the road, while the Hoyas are 6-1 on their
own turf this season, with their only home loss coming at
the hands of top-ranked Princeton. Stanford is 26-18 on
the road since 1997 and has only faced Georgetown on one
other occasion, losing to the Hoyas last year at Maloney
Field, 15-7.
However, both teams are just coming off defeats —
Stanford lost to the Greyhounds last Saturday and
Georgetown fell to No. 8 James Madison on Tuesday.
Look for Stanford to prey on any hesitation Georgetown
may have as a result of its loss to a lower-ranked team.
In addition to Tuesday's loss to James Madison and its
loss to Princeton earlier this season, Georgetown has only
been defeated by No. 4 Maryland and No. 18 Penn State.
The team has posted 10 wins this year, with victories over
several ranked teams, including a close defeat of No. 5
Duke back in March.
While the Cardinal dropped out of the I WLCA's top 20
this week, Stanford ranks 20th in the nation in scoring de
fense, allowing an average of 8.93 goals per game. Stan
ford's defense has its work cut out for it this weekend, as
the Hoyas have five attackers that have scored at least 20

Stanford will play its final regular season game at Georgetown this weekend. The Hoyas have been solid this season at
home, dropping only one game to top-ranked Princeton.

Contributing to Stan
ford's defense is senior Katie
Grube, who leads the team in
caused turnovers with 23 this
season and 101 total caused
turnovers in her time on the
Farm, a school record.
In addition to Stanford's
defense, the rest of the team
must also maintain its inten
sity throughout all 60 min
utes of the game, as intensity
has been a weakness for the
team in the past, especially in
recent games against Duke
and Loyola.
In the game against the
Blue Devils, the team eased
up in the last 1:30 of the first
period, allowing Duke to
score three goals in that short
span. Similarly, in last week

end's game versus Loyola,
Stanford seemed to be hesi
tant until, according to senior
Christina Saikus, the Cardi
nal finally "played [its]
game" in the last 20 minutes
of the second half.
Stanford cannot hold any
thing hack against the Hoyas,
especially since the opposing
team is ranked in the top 10
while Stanford fell out of the
top 20 this week.
"|Against Loyola], we
were a little hesitant, and
that gave them the oppor
tunity to attack some of our
weaknesses," said head
coach Michele Uhlfelder.
Uhlfelder said that the
team will have the best re
sults if they go all-out and
play the whole game with the
mind-set that they "don't
have anything to lose."
Many of the team's family
and friends will be in atten
dance at Saturday's game, to

be played at North Kehoe
Field, particularly because
the Georgetown matchup
marks Stanford's final game
of the regular season, which
is an important event for the
team's six seniors — Kim
Cahill, Tiffany Chao, Larissa
Conte, Grube, Abbi Hills
and Saikus.
Th ese players have
watched Stanford's lacrosse
program mature and gain
depth over the past four
years. More importantly,
these seniors have con
tributed to the Cardinal's
seizing of four consecutive
league titles and have
helped Stanford become the
first West Coast school to
achieve a national ranking.
"[Our team chemistry] is
special," Saikus said. "Every
one has improved greatly
and is really beginning to
step it up."
