# Water polo seeks fourth MPSF title in five years
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After the Stanford women's water polo
team (18-3, 10-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) practiced one last time at
home before heading to the MPSF postsea
son tournament, it decided on one thing.
"It's going to be a team weekend," ex
plained junior two-meter Hannah Luber.
The Cardinal is hoping to stick together,
emotionally and mentally, at Los Alamitos
Joint Forces Training Center for the three
day tournament beginning this morning.
Citing the complications of night games,
the presence of family and the excitement
of the tournament, Stanford has been in
tent on remaining focused until it finally
plays this morning.
With the first round bye given to seeds 1 -
4, Southern California (24-0, 11-0) Stan
ford, UCLA (19-4, 9-2) and San Diego
State (25-7.8-3), the Cardinal will only play
three games.

"With three games, you can just con
centrate on the [teams] you assume
you're going to play, so that's one of the
advantages, [and] it's one less opponent
you have to play," said senior two
meter Wendy Watkins, who also noted
the physical advantages of not playing
four games.
"But I think we're also at a disadvan
tage. because people who have that morn
ing game [today] can get game ready and be
ready to play that bigger night game
(tonight]," Watkins continued.
The Cardinal is still unaware of who it
will be playing in its first match. It will face
the winner of the No. 7 Hawaii vs. No. 10
UC-Irvine morning game. Irvine, ranked
19th in the nation, wrapped up its regular
season with a 7-6 win over Arizona State,
after having lost five in a row.
"We feel like Hawaii is the stronger
team ... We definitely feel like Hawaii has
the talent." said freshman goalkeeper
Meridith McColl. who is ranked number

one in the conference in goals-against aver
age with a 4.(X) mark.
Hawaii might be a little cold. It last
played two weekends ago, when it lost to
UC-San Diego, 9-7. But the Cardinal is tak
ing into account its previous match with
Hawaii, when the Wahine led the Cardinal
and took them into overtime until Stanford
prevailed with 7-6 comeback win.
"I think because we had such a struggle
with Hawaii [previously], we've definitely
focused on them more than we have
Irvine," Watkins said. "We never want to
overlook any opponent, but Hawaii match
es up pretty well with us."
It is important that the Cardinal wins
its first game, as a loss would not give
them anything higher than fifth place in
the tournament and could ruin their run
for the at-large NCAA berth. As pre
dicted by the team, it looks like Stanford
has a good chance at meeting rival
UCLA on Saturday. The Bruins have
won four MPSF titles and last year's na

tional championship.
"Our semifinal game is key," Luber said.
Because the teams faced each other
two weekends ago, the Bruins are still
Iresh in the Cardinal's mind. Stanford
considers that as an advantage but is not
worrying itself too much about its possi
ble opponents.
"We're just going to do what Stanford
water polo does," Luber said.
And what Stanford has been doing this
season has worked out well for the team.
Stanford leads the league in scoring, even
though its top scorer, Watkins (26), doesn't
sit among the top 10 scoring leaders, thanks
to the Cardinal's exceptionally deep and
balanced offensive attack.
Watkins is followed bv Luber with 24
goals, freshman Katie Hansen with 20 and
seven other players with at least 10 goals on
the season. The team also carries a five
game win streak into the tournament.
So in preparing for other teams Watkins said the team will prepare as it
does for all other teams — staying concentrated on itself, while making
small adjustments.
"We want other teams worrying about us and making adjustments [to]
our players," McColl said.
This marks the fourth straight year that Stanford has reached the tour
nament. It already holds three titles, from 2000, 2001 and 2003. The pres
sure to meet expectations could drive the squad to succeed.
"For me, I definitely feel like there is an extra pressure," Watkins said.
"It would he such a bummer and kind of a letdown for our season to end a
week early, especially since were hosting [NCAAs]."
"Even just with MPSFs, we've always come out really strong," Luber
said. "No matter how the season ended at NCAAs, we've always done well
at MPSFs. We want to continue that."
But when asked where it sees itself Sunday night, the Cardinal remains
humble. It would much rather concentrate on preparing for what comes
after the MPSF tournament is over.
"Our priority right now is doing what we need to do to get an extended
season even longer, to make it into NCAAs," Watkins said.
The MPSF title game is set for 6:15 p.m. on Sunday. The champion of
the tournament gets an automatic spot for the national championships held
at Stanford on May 8-9.

Citing the complications of night games,
the presence of family and the excitement
of the tournament, Stanford has been in
tent on remaining focused until it finally
plays this morning.
With the first round bye given to seeds 1 -
4, Southern California (24-0, 11-0) Stan
ford, UCLA (19-4, 9-2) and San Diego
State (25-7.8-3), the Cardinal will only play
three games.

"With three games, you can just con
centrate on the [teams] you assume
you're going to play, so that's one of the
advantages, [and] it's one less opponent
you have to play," said senior two
meter Wendy Watkins, who also noted
the physical advantages of not playing
four games.
"But I think we're also at a disadvan
tage. because people who have that morn
ing game [today] can get game ready and be
ready to play that bigger night game
(tonight]," Watkins continued.
The Cardinal is still unaware of who it
will be playing in its first match. It will face
the winner of the No. 7 Hawaii vs. No. 10
UC-Irvine morning game. Irvine, ranked
19th in the nation, wrapped up its regular
season with a 7-6 win over Arizona State,
after having lost five in a row.
"We feel like Hawaii is the stronger
team ... We definitely feel like Hawaii has
the talent." said freshman goalkeeper
Meridith McColl. who is ranked number

one in the conference in goals-against aver
age with a 4.(X) mark.
Hawaii might be a little cold. It last
played two weekends ago, when it lost to
UC-San Diego, 9-7. But the Cardinal is tak
ing into account its previous match with
Hawaii, when the Wahine led the Cardinal
and took them into overtime until Stanford
prevailed with 7-6 comeback win.
"I think because we had such a struggle
with Hawaii [previously], we've definitely
focused on them more than we have
Irvine," Watkins said. "We never want to
overlook any opponent, but Hawaii match
es up pretty well with us."
It is important that the Cardinal wins
its first game, as a loss would not give
them anything higher than fifth place in
the tournament and could ruin their run
for the at-large NCAA berth. As pre
dicted by the team, it looks like Stanford
has a good chance at meeting rival
UCLA on Saturday. The Bruins have
won four MPSF titles and last year's na

tional championship.
"Our semifinal game is key," Luber said.
Because the teams faced each other
two weekends ago, the Bruins are still
Iresh in the Cardinal's mind. Stanford
considers that as an advantage but is not
worrying itself too much about its possi
ble opponents.
"We're just going to do what Stanford
water polo does," Luber said.
And what Stanford has been doing this
season has worked out well for the team.
Stanford leads the league in scoring, even
though its top scorer, Watkins (26), doesn't
sit among the top 10 scoring leaders, thanks
to the Cardinal's exceptionally deep and
balanced offensive attack.
Watkins is followed bv Luber with 24
goals, freshman Katie Hansen with 20 and
seven other players with at least 10 goals on
the season. The team also carries a five
game win streak into the tournament.
So in preparing for other teams Watkins said the team will prepare as it
does for all other teams — staying concentrated on itself, while making
small adjustments.
"We want other teams worrying about us and making adjustments [to]
our players," McColl said.
This marks the fourth straight year that Stanford has reached the tour
nament. It already holds three titles, from 2000, 2001 and 2003. The pres
sure to meet expectations could drive the squad to succeed.
"For me, I definitely feel like there is an extra pressure," Watkins said.
"It would he such a bummer and kind of a letdown for our season to end a
week early, especially since were hosting [NCAAs]."
"Even just with MPSFs, we've always come out really strong," Luber
said. "No matter how the season ended at NCAAs, we've always done well
at MPSFs. We want to continue that."
But when asked where it sees itself Sunday night, the Cardinal remains
humble. It would much rather concentrate on preparing for what comes
after the MPSF tournament is over.
"Our priority right now is doing what we need to do to get an extended
season even longer, to make it into NCAAs," Watkins said.
The MPSF title game is set for 6:15 p.m. on Sunday. The champion of
the tournament gets an automatic spot for the national championships held
at Stanford on May 8-9.
After the Stanford women's water polo
team (18-3, 10-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) practiced one last time at
home before heading to the MPSF postsea
son tournament, it decided on one thing.
"It's going to be a team weekend," ex
plained junior two-meter Hannah Luber.
The Cardinal is hoping to stick together,
emotionally and mentally, at Los Alamitos
Joint Forces Training Center for the three
day tournament beginning this morning.
