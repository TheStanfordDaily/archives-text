## Dean reflects on primary campaign in Dartmouth interview 
### GRAHAM ROTH THE DARTMOUTH FREE PRESS 
(U-WIRE) HANOVER. NH — Though "The Doc
tor" will not he in the White House next January, former
presidential candidate Howard Dean's immediate im
pact on the Democratic Party is evident. The party has
become much more comfortable addressing gay rights
and criticizing the Bush administration's foreign policy
decisions, and has brought health care back to the na
tional debate in a meaningful way. The Dartmouth Free
Press sat down for an interview with the former governor
last week.
DARTMOUTH FREE PRESS: Gov. Dean, you in
spired a lot of students on this campus to get involved
with politics for the first time. What's your advice to
them, now that you're not a candidate for the presidency
in 2004?
HOWARD DEAN: The first piece of advice is to stay
active in politics. You can work for John Kerry, you can
work for local candidates, you can run yourself. Those
are all things that we're encouraging people to do. And
we have an organization called DemocracyForAmeri

ca.com that is going help train them and organize them.
DFP: Can you explain Democracy For America to me a
bit more?
DEAN: Sure. As you know, we developed a huge grass
roots organization around the country and we want to
keep that going. We want to keep people involved in
their communities. People were really empowered by
this campaign. They began to believe again that they
could change their community and make a difference in
their country and we want to keep that going and
Democracy For America is going to help train people,
it's going to supply some money, and I'm going to do
some fund raising for candidates.
DFP: Do you have any sense so far of how you're going to
choose what types of candidates to fund raise for?
DEAN: We're going to leave that mostly to local organi
zations. Local people will tell us which candidates they
want to support.
DFP: These are the people who are participating in
Democracy For America Meet Ups?

DEAN: Exactly right.
DFP: Going back to the primary campaign — I hate to
relive this moment, probably almost as much as you do,
but people want to know — lowa, the night of the cau
cuses, did you have another speech written?
DEAN: No. That was my speech and we were having
fun. I don't regret that speech for a moment
DFP: 1 know that the crowd couldn't hear because they were
getting really loud. And so...that's just how it happened?
DEAN: Yeah. I had a great speech. I've looked at that
tape. I was having a grand time.
DFP: [Laughter] Yeah, you were up there with
Tom Harkin . , .
DEAN: Yeah, great. We had a great time.
DFP: As they like to say on the 9/11 Commission,
"there are no silver bullets," and you obviously hate to
second guess, but is there any one thing, looking back,
knowing what you know now, that you would have

changed about your primary campaign?
DEAN: We probably wouldn't have gone after Gephardt
in lowa when he was threatening to pass us for the second
time. We would not have attacked him. He was attacking us
so we decided to attack back and I think if we hadn't done
that we might have still had a chance to come in second.
DFP: So you wouldn't have gone negative. Is there any
thing organizationally that you would have changed?
DEAN: Oh I would have changed all kinds of things, but
that's all woulda, coulda, shoulda.
DFP: What do you think the biggest challenge is for the
Democratic Party right now?
DEAN: Keeping grassroots people interested, giving
progressive voters a reason to go to the polls. They're
going to be constantly challenged not to go back to the
politics as usual that got them all those losses.
DFP: In 2002?
DEAN: And starting in 1994.
