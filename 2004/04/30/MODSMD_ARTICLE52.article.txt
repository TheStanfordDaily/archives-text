# UCLA professors reflect on lower black undergraduate admit rates

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES —
As student fees continue to rise
and funding for outreach rapidly
diminishes, the number of black
students at the University of Cali
fornia is dwindling.
A study released Tuesday by the
Ralph J. Bunche Center for
African-American Studies at the
University of California-Los Ange
les found that enrollment of black
students in the LIC system has de
creased steadily since Proposition
209 was implemented in admitting
the freshman class of 19%.
UC admissions data for 2004

indicates that this trend is continu
ing, especially at the most selec
tive campuses.
The study — compiled by the
College Access Project for
African-Americans and called
Separate but Certainly not Equal
— attributed the decline in college
admissions for black students to
racial inequality in public high
schools in conjunction with a de
cline in outreach programs, the re
sult of a budget crisis.
The study states that "racial seg
regation in neighborhoods is rising,
rather than decreasing," and found
that schools with majorities of black
students send many fewer students
to UC schools.

Of 234 public high schools in
California, the study found nine
with Asian and Pacific American
majorities, 10 with black majorities,
34 with white majorities and 95 with
Latino majorities.
Black-majority schools were al
most always in urban areas, offered
the fewest AP courses, had the
fewest number of credentialed
teachers (78.6 percent), and had less
experienced teachers.
The study also found that at
black-majority schools, fewer stu
dents took the SAT — 104.7 per
school as opposed to the high school
average of 138.1 —the average
SAT score was 200 points lower
than the California average, and the

passing rate for AP tests was 18.1
percent as opposed to the state av
erage of 52.2 percent.
These lower success rates ap
plied to all of the students at black
majority schools. For example, the
study found white and Asian stu
dents were much less likely to be ad
mitted to a competitive college
when they attended a black majori
ty school.
These inequalities in high school
education may account for the de
cline in black enrollment at the UC,
which, exacerbated by the 6.7 per
cent cut in freshman admissions,
shows prominently in 2004 admis
sions data.
In comparing the 2004 incoming

freshman to the current freshman
class, seven percent fewer black
students applied to the UC and 15
percent fewer were admitted, with
the decline in black admits espe
cially prominent at the most com
petitive UCs.
UCLA admitted 199 black stu
dents — more than 25 percent
fewer than in 2003 — and Berkeley
admitted 194, a 31 percent drop.
UC officials say cuts in outreach
and increased student fees may
have contributed to the decline in
black admits.
"Some of the campuses where
you see the sharpest declines are
where comprehensive review has
been applied in a more narrow way.

with more weight given to SAT
scores," said Darnell Hunt, director
of the Ralph Bunche Center and a
UCLA sociology professor.
"This is a problem," Hunt added,
alluding to the inequalities in sec
ondary education and SAT prepa
ration, which the study says has dis
advantaged the black community.
"We had a pretty strong applica
tion pool, and there weren't that
many minority applicants in that
part of the p001... so basically they
got squeezed out," said Pamela
Burnett, director of the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions at UC-
Berkeley, adding that outreach can
affect application rates as well as
student preparation.
