# Snap, Crackle, Pop! at the SFMOMA
## 
### CHRIS MEYER INTERMISSION ART CRITIC 
"In the future everyone will he famous for 15
minutes," Andy Warhol once said. In the case of
his own art, Warhol's fame has lasted somewhat
longer than fifteen minutes —it has extended tor
more than forty years.
"Pop! From San Francisco Collections," now
on view at SFMOMA through September 19,
showcases paintings, drawings, and sculptures
from the 1960s art movement known as "Pop
art." This small but snappy exhibit includes works
by those New York artists identified with the
movement: Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Claes
Oldenburg. It also includes pieces by California
artists like Wayne Thiebaud, Ed Ruscha and
Robert Arneson. These artists did not consider
themselves to be under the rubric of "Pop," but
their work nonetheless reveals certain affinities
with that of their New York counterparts when
seen in the same exhibition.
The exhibit's first room displays Warhol's
"Campbells Soup Can (Pepper Pot)" from 1962.
Such Warhol images have become iconic, so it is
easy to forget how provocative they must have
seemed to the art public at the time of their cre
ation. To pick a common everyday commodity
that can be bought in any supermarket, blow it up
and put it on a canvas was the most audacious of
artistic gestures. The intrusion of "popular" ob
jects threatened the sophistication and elitism of
the "fine" arts.
As his famous "15 minutes" comment indi
cates, one of Warhol's favorite subjects was
celebrity (those of others as well as his own). In
"Velvet Underground" (1963), we see Elizabeth
Taylor riding a horse in a film still taken from the
1944 film "National Velvet." The film still is re
peated over and over, gradually disintegrating
from top to bottom. Warhol was well-aware of
the fleetingness of celebrity, even if he continued
to crave it for himself.
Lichtenstein borrowed images from another

popular format not usually considered "high art":
mass-produced newspaper comics. The enlarge
ment of Ben Day dots used in newspaper printing
makes the reference explicit. Lichtenstein's
paintings justify the exclamation point in the ex
hibit's title. Their simple forms and discrete areas
of bright colore demand your attention, (note to
Lichtenstein fans: SFMOMA recently an
nounced a Lichtenstein exhibition slated to open
on Oct. 23).
r rhe Pop artists explicitly acknowledged that
they were reacting against the Abstract Expres
sionists who had preceded them. Claes Olden
burg said in 1964, "I think that the reaction to the
painting of the last generation, which is generally
believed to have been a highly subjective genera
tion, is impersonality. So one tries to get oneself
out of the painting..." When Oldenburg said
that he tried to get himself "out of the painting,"
he meant that he wanted to remove stylistic char
acteristics such as visible brushstrokes that are
generally considered expressive of an individual
artist's personality (think of Van Gogh). Pop
artists chose techniques that minimized such ex
pressiveness.
After visiting "Pop!", the most interesting dif
ference between the '60s Pop artists and their Ab
stract Expressionist predecessors was not stylistic.
The wit and playfulness of the Pop artists was an
immense change from the solemnity of such
artists as Pollock and De Kooning. Their lively
and prankish attitude does not mean that we
should not take them seriously. The Pop artists
were offering both a critique and an acknowl
edgement of the saturation of popular culture in
our society. With these artists, pop culture had ex
tended its tendrils into the most unlikely of places:
the fine arts museum. It is evident from the ait
work that these artists loved Pop culture. Licht
enstein loved comics and Warhol loved celebri
ties; one could find artistic inspiration in the
funny pages and the other could find aesthetic
value in a soup can. Their enthusiasm makes
"Pop!" worth a visit.
