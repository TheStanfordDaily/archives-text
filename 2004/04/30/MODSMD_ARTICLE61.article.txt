# The 						legacy of my appendix Or how I learned to stop worrying and love organ removal
## 
### ANNA NORTH INTERMISSION WRITER 
It wasn't my favorite organ. That
honor would have to go to that hum
ble workhorse, the liver, or perhaps
the mysterious and musically named
duodenum. But in the category of lit
tle bits of flesh that have no obvious
use, it came out on top. Unlike my
pesky tonsils, my appendix had never
given me any trouble.
Then came Easter, a day I spent
wondering if the chocolate bunny I'd
eaten had sprung to life and begun
gnawing my insides. Wonder became
panic became a trip to the emergency
room, and I found myself suddenly
unable to fulfill my duties to Inter
mission— or, given the amount of
morphine they pumped me up with,
any duties at all.
Not to worry, dear readers. I
haven't been able to review a movie
this week, interview any vegans or ex
plore any of the pressing cultural is
sues you're used to pondering over
your Friday morning cereal. But I
haven't been idle. Resourceful jour
nalist that 1 am, I've kept a record of
my experiences. Keep it in your wallet
for emergencies — it might make
good hospital reading.
Appendicitis, I learned from Dr.
Luigi Santacroce's article on the dis
ease at eMedicine.com, affects mostly
people in their 20s and 30s. Its causes
are various, usually an obstruction in
the intestine caused by infection, para
sites, or irritable bowel disease. Its
main symptom, as Santacroce puts it, is
"periumbilical or epigastric pain mi
grating to the right lower quadrant
(RLQ) of the abdomen."
For me, that translated roughly as
"the feeling of a sharp rock poking
me in the guts." The poking got
worse when doctors at Stanford Hos
pital, as Santacroce recommends,
performed "palpation in the RLQ
over the Mcßurney point" — that is,
pressed my stomach real hard and
nodded sagely.
About 20 people did this, at about
half-hour intervals over the seven or so
hours it took to diagnose me. In be
tween, I waited and listened. The
woman two rooms over — the rooms
in the Stanford ER are actually sort of
cubicles divided by non-soundproof
pastel curtains — was two months
pregnant and had some sort of buildup
of fluid on her abdomen. Orderlies
were throwing around words like "ec
topic" — I shivered.
Then I listened to the little kid next
to me crying about his inflamed left
eye. Soon an avuncular doctor pre
scribed him Benadryl and told his fa
ther that yes, some Chinese herbal tea
would be fine too. I felt a little better.
Between palpations came tests. In
accordance with that fine Vaden tra
dition, they screened me for pregnan
cy — then continued to ask me all
night about the date of my last period

until it became as familiar as my
name. They gave me an ultrasound,
which, for the uninitiated, involves
getting smeared with warm jelly and
then poked with a device that feels
like a bladeless shaver.
It was only after the C.T. scan — a
space-age procedure involving X
rays and radioactive iodine — that
the diagnosis came. It was 6 a.m. I'd
checked into the E.R. at 9 p.m. the
night before. At this point, I sort of
felt like I'd won something.
What I'd won was more morphine,
and a trip to the operating room for
three little incisions in my stomach. I
don't remember any of it — not even
what the O.R. looked like. I could've
been abducted by aliens.
What I do remember is what came
after: a period in which my current
identity seemed fused with that of a 6-
year-old girl.
In the hospital, I found myself
spooning cherry Jell-0 while a doctor
asked me about my alcohol habits.
One nurse called me her "sick little
princess." Another gave me an organ
donor form. And, for the first time
since grade school, my mom was feel
ing my forehead and making sure I
took my medicine.
"Did you have your painkillers?"
"Yes, Mother."
"And your vitamin?"
"Yes, Mother."
"What about your birth-control pill?"
Having Mom monitor my contra
ception was certainly creepy, and I
wasn't too happy when I needed her to
tie my shoes. But there was something
comforting in my newfound ability to
crawl at least partway back into the
womb. Santacroce says appendicitis
patients often draw their knees up to
reduce their pain. I remember doing
this, and the result looked a lot like the
fetal position.
I turned 21 two months ago. It's a
milestone that America in general,
and college America in particular,
treat as the final entree into the adult
world. Your driver's license is magic
all of a sudden, the country is your
oyster, you go into a bar and they
"have to serve you" because "you are
a grown-up."
Which is all fine. I'm not one of
those people who romanticize child
hood; when other people talk about
Popsicles and play dates, I tend to re
call the time the popular girls com
manded me to buy new shoes. But
what appendicitis reminded me of —
apart from the precise location of my
colon — was that being taken care of
was part of childhood too. The best
part, probably, and also the part I'm al
lowed to return to sometimes if I need
to. It's good to know that, even as a
legal adult, I can still get my shoes tied
from time to time.
I bet this thought will be especially
comforting when I turn 40. I hope I
haven't forgotten it by then. If I have,
there's always my tonsils.
