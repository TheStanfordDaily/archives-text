"I don't dress how I feel; I dress how every
body else dresses. I'm trying to convince
everyone else I'm normal - so if everyone else
is wearing miniskirts, I'm going to wear a
miniskirt. Sometimes if I dressed the way I
really felt, I'd be dressed in all black."
— Lilly Wolfson, sophomore




"Everyone wears flip-flops. They're very California."
— Erica Hanson, sophomore
"I like wearing heels but it's hard to wear them because people ask, "Why are you so
dressed up?"
— Morgan Craven, sophomore
