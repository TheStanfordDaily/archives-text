"The other day, this Pro Fro was talking
about how everybody at Stanford dresses the
same. It's funny; I don't think we do."
— Jessica Goldman, junior (right)


"I've noticed that when the weather
goes above 75 degrees, most pieces of
clothing become optional. For guys,
the bare minimum is a pair of shorts.
For girls, it's a bikini. Once you hit
that, you're passable. Anything be
yond that is just conservative."
— Morgan Springer, sophomore


Trevor Izzo was standing, in front of the Bookstore
when we spied his good looks from across White
Plaza and accosted him: Do people actually listen
to My Bloody Valentine at Stanford? No, it turns
out. Trevor is 15 and was touring campus with a
bunch of fellow underage Robert Smith and Sid
Vicious look-alikes. Trevor says he uses Rusk gel
and (a shitload of) hairspray to get his hair to stay
this way. "My parents are hairdressers so they cut
it for me."


Sophomore Rayna
Wiles bought this
look-at-me ring in a
boutique in Venice,
Italy. "It's made of
resin, so if you heat it,
you can bend it." Cool?
If you're a product de
sign major, like Rayna.


Senior Margaret Shear
bought this dress six years
ago in Cambridge, Mass.
and then layered a skirt over
it to hide its age.


"Everybody seems really laid-back. I don't get the sense that every
body spends hours and hours primping themselves before going
to class."
— Kadavy, Pro Fro (left)


Senior Oliver Rizk is wear
ing Zara pants and a hand
me-down shirt from former
Intermission editor Ryan
Sands. "I respect anyone
that puts effort into what
they're wearing."


Kaicie Flores, 15, stapled
the bottoms of these l.e.i.
jeans for a cool-again Sid
and-Nancy look.


Junior Jenny Zhang has
an uncanny ability to
match every outfit she
wears with the green Con
verse she just brought
back from Spring Break in
New York. The jacket and
shirt are from H&M; the
skirt used to belong to
Mom. "And then I cut it
to make it shorter."
