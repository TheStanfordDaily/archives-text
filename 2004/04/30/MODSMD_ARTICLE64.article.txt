Spring is here, and it's suddenly 100 hot to sport those
drawstring sweatpants and Nikes. The girls of Stan
ford stare at their closets. They have their Reefs and
Nalgene bottles ready to go, but nothing to match.

The Skirt. You can wear it to the beach, to sorority for

Pro Fro pointed out, it even serves a practical purpose:
It's short enough to go fountain hopping and keep your
dotfies dry. So, is it always appropriate —or is it
never appropriate? Stanford answers.
