# Don't Forget about...

### MIKE ORME INTERMISSION HIPSTER 
Last quarter, I wrote a series of articles entitled "Don't Forget About
focusing on little-known artists of the past five years. While I've long run out
of ideas for this column (next on my list: RADIOHEAD?!), I haven't
stopped following the artists I've written about. Many of the acts have re
leased albums in the past few months or are gearing up to do so soon. Here's
a rundown on some of those artists and their new albums that, well, you
shouldn't forget about.

Dacdclus: "Of Snowdonia"
This L.A.-based found-sound IDM emcee spent most of
last year working in the avant-garde hip-hop arena. High-pro
file releases like "The Weather," featuring rappers Busdriver
and Radioinactive, created quite a stir among the underground
hip-hop world, and delivered on the promise Daedelus showed
in "Quiet Party," his 2003 collaboration with Madlib.

On Daedelus's latest full-length "Of Snowdonia," he comes back to the
showtune-era sampling that made 2001 's "Invention" so enchanting. How
ever, the "Weather" and "Quiet Party" trysts have left him with stronger hip
hop ties. Daedelus manages throughout the entire album to coax unique
beats organically from his source material, animating the rusted jazz drums
and classical melodies he throws in his collage.
Although "Of Snowdonia" doesn't quite reach the dreamy heights
achieved on "Invention," it still shows the exciting musical growth of this
still-young DJ. It also indicates that perhaps that for all of his Showtunes
styling, Daedelus has always been a hip-hopper, and it is his audience that
must come to understand him and not the other way around.

Phoenix: "Alphabetical"
After spending the past four years in virtual hibernation,
Phoenix has come out of hiding with a new album, "Alpha
betical," and has managed to redefine its sound while still
drawing on the same influences that fans will recognize from
its first album, "United."

Traces of Steely Dan can still be found on tracks like "Run Run Run,"
which offers a startlingly accurate play on '70s R&B-influenced radio rock.
However, "Alphabetical" favors low-key, slow beats more so than "United,"
which often strayed into club beats and occasionally into garage punk.
If any criticism can be found of the album, it is that most songs stay in the
same tempo and fail to get loud, but this criticism falls flat against the smart
radio-rock of "Everything is Everything" and "Holdin' on Together."
"Alphabetical" brings together many Phoenix staples like muted guitar,
disco beats and AM-radio melodies that made "United" a fan favorite. But
this album sees Phoenix embracing their softer sensibilities to create a lik
able album with some surprises. As long as Phoenix can keep offering offer
ing this kind of earnest '70s tribute music, they'll keep getting my business.
The Frames: "Setlist"

Someone in the States really wants the Frames to become
popular here. In the past year, Dublin's newest supergroup
has released a best-of compilation, "From Roads Out
grown," which was marketed specifically for the New World.
Now they have released this live album detailing their great
est hits, taken from four nights in Dublin in late 2002.

The band performs cuts from their four studio albums, and most immedi
ately apparent is the band's huge popularity with their Irish audience. The
audience can be heard singing many of the songs word-by-word, adding ex
citement to tame studio cuts like "Lay Me Down" and "Santa Maria."
Whereas their recent "For the Birds" offered mostly quiet folk-influenced
cuts, on "Setlist" they are updated for a live crowd and sped up to match the
rock of the rest of The Frames' discography.
While this is no groundbreaking album like "Live at Budokan," it offers
a number of choice numbers played with The Frames' trademark intensity
and is buoyed by the band's always-energetic audiences. This is the Frames'
"Unplugged in New York" — a fine snapshot of a band at peak form, trying
their best to get noticed by the big audience they deserve.

the others, one of these tilings is
