# 'Mean Girls': Tina Fey and attractive teenagers. What could go wrong?

### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
The jocks. The math
geeks. The burnouts. The
lame-o teachers. The
nerdy Asians. The cool
rice-rocket Asians. The
plasties. The new kid.
Sounds like a typi
cal suburban high school,
doesn't it? More perti
nently, sounds like your
typical high school come
dy, doesn't it?
After 45 minutes
(give or take) of being
above your average mun

teen flick, "Mean Girls"
(directed by Mark Waters)
gives in to temptation and

and often-hilarious script (based on Rosalind Wiseman's novel "Queen
Bees and Wannabes") from "Saturday Night 1 .ive" savior Tina Fey and
fcmtasticcomedic performances from "SNL" vets like Tim Meadows can't
keep "Mean Girls" from veering onto the path more traveled.
In a smart and honest portrayal, Lindsay Lohan plays Cady, a
sweet 16-year-old entering the metaphorical jungle of the public
school system for the first time after returning from a literal jungle
in Africa where she had been home-schooled by her college pro
fessor parents. Her first day at school proves predictably miserable,
but Cady soon becomes the object of non-sexual crushes both from
a queer counter-culture cadre and from the "plastics," the school's
iiber-popular yet intellectually stultifying chick clique.

Knowing full well that her
IQ is probably double that of the
three plastics combined, Cady be
gins hanging out with these cool
girls so she and the artsy kids can
laugh at them later behind their
backs. This plan is all well and
good until Cady develops a crush
(of the overtly sexual variety) on

hottie Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett). With this pronounce
ment, Cady's life as a self-respecting kid (as well as the movie's
plot) start heading into a deep dark jungle. Cady becomes one of
the plastics herself, discarding her two cool friends and her good

grades in the process. The tried and true lessons come to light: Be
true to yourself, and don't talk shit behind your friends' backs.
"Mean Girls" would have done itself a favor of it took advice from
"Dazed and Confused" and abandoned a plot altogether. What pre
vented that 1993 flick from becoming just another cliched account of
high school (other than: "I keep gettin' older, they stay the same age")
was its entire lack of plot. "Dazed" made social commentary of life in
high school with basically nothing happening. "Mean Girls" works best
when characters are brought forth just to be laughed at, and with no plot
advancement. Tim Meadows's wishy-washy principal and Amy
Poehler's Mrs. George and her contemptible mothering techniques are
just two examples of the subtle and frolicsome satire Fey employs.
"Mean Girls" has moments of clairvoyant honesty. The film
lampoons some of America's overlooked establishments with
brutal truthfulness. Halloween is indeed an excuse for girls to real
ly slut themselves out, pre-pubescent girls are over-sexualized, and
public high schools do follow the rules of the African wilderness.
Hilarious though it may be, "Mean Girls" proselytizing is just
aggravating. No moral telling you not to backstab your friends was
really needed here. By succumbing to an it's-been-done-before
plot of girls needlessly being mean to each other (hence the movie's
title), "Mean Girls" falls short of its genre-busting aspirations.
By the film's denouement, in which a fart joke is actually told,
"Mean Girls" has become just another teen comedy. But for just
another teen comedy, at least this one's funny.


The bunny ears show Amanda
Seyfried knows what the future has
in store for her.
