# 'Laws of Attraction': Marriage first, love later
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION FILM GODDESS 
After about 45 minutes of getting to know the two lawyers /
lovers Audrey Woods (Julianne Moore) and Daniel Rafferty
(Pierce Brosnan), we end up with them in the middle of a dense
fog, at midnight, in an abandoned trailer in Ireland. If this was
any other type of movie, we the audience would be scared out of
our minds — just knowing there was someone with a chainsaw
lurking right on the other side of the foggy woods. But, we are in
romantic comedy territory. And by golly, it's nice here.
Forgoing the chainsaws, we are left with only razor-sharp wit.
most of it coming from the mouth of Moore's Audrey. As a
prominent New York City lawyer (she graduated first in her class
at Yale, thank you very much) Audrey has never lost a case. She
is always impeccably dressed, always well-spoken, and always
right. She is, what some would term, "a hard-ass." That is, until
she meets Daniel. He is always late, always messy, and also, al
ways right. He is, what some would term, "rough and tumble."
Pitted against each other in court, their relationship unfolds
like a prize-fight. In this corner, the prim and proper pale
princess, Audrey Woods! And her opponent, Ragamuffin Raf
ferty! But, if it starts as a prize-fight, it quickly turns into a bar
fight. "Bar fight" meaning — a fight that takes place in a bar, and

where the stakes are set in terms of alcohol consumption. Meet
ing for a friendly dinner, Audrey and Daniel quickly get into a
drinking competition. As one can guess, fighting plus alcohol can
only lead to one thing: prison. I mean, love-making.

While "Laws of Attraction"
spells out its basic premise and
characters as any romantic come
dy does (two big-time lawyers try
ing to figure out if they love each
other or not), it is the more subtle

and svelte details that give the movie instances of brilliance. Bros
nan's Rafferty is extremely Likeable, and makes carefully stated and
extremely apropos observations about Moore's sometimes bratty
and neurotic character — he is our insight into her inner-workings.
Moore's Audrey (who eats more than Brad Pitt in "Ocean's
Eleven") is a bit harder to digest, as she is engulfed in "self-serv
ing paranoia" and hen-pecked by her fabulous Cosmo-reading
youth-obsessed mother (Frances Fisher). But, when you put
them together and add a couple of dozen shots of alcohol, well,
you'll just have to see what happens.
The bottom line is that "Laws of Attraction" really shines in
the moments when it's not being formulaic. Given the premise,
you may be thinking: "I object! Isn't it bad for opposing lawyers
to become romantically involved?" Outside of romantic come
dies, I'd say yes, but for all movie purposes, I say, "Objection
overruled." Brosnan's compassionate Rafferty and the film's
moments of witty dialogue give it just enough edge that we're
willing to suspend our disbelief. Herein, the defense rests.
