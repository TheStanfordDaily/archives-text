# 'Godsend': Seen one freaky kid, seen 'em all
## 
### FARIS ALI MOHIUDDIN INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
If you ask me, little kids are not only ill-mannered and irritat
ing... but also just a tad on the evil side. Though this stance has
brought me much crap over the years, it's comforting to know that
Hollywood has got my back. Since the "Sixth Sense," a slew of
films have capitalized on disturbed, deranged, even demonic lit
tle tykes. Though my once scoffed at opinion has now been glori
ously vindicated ... movies are starting to pay the price.
Every new scary movie either has a murderous half-pint at
center stage, or paranormally clairvoyant half-pint quivering in
fear. Though "Godsend" overtly revolves around current issues

of bioethics and moral concerns about cloning, the
true fear factor is the same Faustian endeavor
gone wrong scenario that we've seen a dozen times
in the last few years.
The film opens with a (surprise!) perfect family
that (surprise!) falls victim to tragedy. Within days
of their beloved son's accidental death, Paul (Greg
Kinnear) and Jessie (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos)

Duncan are offered the chance to effectively bring their son hack
to life through cloning. Dr. Richard Wells (Robert DeNiro ...
thankfully not attempting to be funny) gives the grief stricken
parents three days to decide whether or not to play Yahtzee with
fabric of life. Surprise, surprise, after an obligatory cloning de
bate, they agree to proceed. All is splendid until their son, Adam
(version 2.0), approaches the age when his former incarnate was
killed. In the time after his original death-day (ironically, his
Birthday) Adam begins to experience violent, disturbing visions
at night and begins to suspect Mommy and Daddy have been
withholding more than the facts of life.
These nocturnal disturbances accompany violent mood
swings especially directed at his parents ... and this kid hasn't
even hit puberty yet. Once more, surprise, as the parents voice
their complaints, Dr Wells' ulterior motives begin to crystallize.
It's at around this point that we know, the Duncans, like so many
others, are about to get an oldfashioned schooling in the ways
bioethics. Beyond its promising setup, the pattern of events be
comes all too clear only to end in a way that is unsatisfying to say

the least. It is reported that half a dozen endings
were shot; maybe on the DVD you can pick out an
ending that will do the film for justice, until then,
you'll be left feeling gypped.
In general, "Godsend" is well made, well acted
and clearly had the potential to be something spe
cial. Director Nick Hamm establishes and sustains
a beautiful yet ominous mood using bleak scenery

and scant lighting. Kinnear, DeNiro and Roniijn-Stamos (0r... is
it back to Romijn?) all deliver solid performances; it's a pity that
the plot leaves them so little to do that we haven't seen before.
Despite all the great elements, as the plot progresses, "Godsend"
degenerates into an amalgam of other horror movies. A movie
cannot be thrilling, let alone scary, unless the audience lacks as
surance of how things will turn out. In the grand tradition of "Pet
Semetary" where cheating death precipitated more death, "God
send" offers nothing new except a current context. Adam's scenes
of internal confusion and terror are derivative of what the "Sixth
Sense" et al had to offer half a decade ago.
Ironically, "Godsend" is really just a genetically spliced
clone of other horror movies that blazed new trails and were
thus far more effective in their time. Nowadays, we live in a
word replete with real things to be terrified of. For movies to
sustain the same thrill, they'll need to devise new ways to elicit
fear rather than regurgitating tactics and masking them with a
modern twist. "Godsend" was definitely a decent movie, but it
deserved to be better.
