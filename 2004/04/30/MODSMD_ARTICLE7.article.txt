## Fireside Chats Protest this 
### 
Yesterday, The Daily published a news arti
cle about the "Books Not Bombs II"
protest. Upon reading the article, we Hash
backed to last year. In March 2003, the cam
pus, the country and the world were in crisis about the
possibility of war with Iraq, and Stanford students
and community members rallied at a protest called
"Books Not Bombs." There were some real issues
on hand at the time. Was pre-eminent attack a le
gitimate type of warfare? Did Iraq really have
weapons of mass destruction?

But this year, we're a
little confused. Last we
heard, Bush had de
clared war on Iraq,
battles were fought,
shit hit the fan, and
Saddam Hussein
crawled out of a hole
and into American
custody looking like
many of the male resi
dents of Synergy. And
now we're still in Iraq,

trying to put things hack in order. The point is, the war
happened. So what exactly is "Books Not Bombs II"
protesting this time around?
The freshman organizer of yesterday's protest,
Nancy Wang, stated that the point was to show "how
the war in Iraq affects the Stanford community and
how the war has been influenced by policies produced
by the Hoover Institution, and that students take re
sponsibility for this connection."
Sorry Nancy, but we think you've got it all wrong.
We certainly don't take responsibility for the
Hoover Institution. We do, however, take responsi
bility for the success of the Stanford Shopping Center
through weekly, if not bi-weekly, visits. We take re
sponsibility for Moonbean's thriving business by
drinking at least one chai a day. We take responsibil
ity for Charles Shaw's booming enterprise (and after
consumption of their product take no absolutely no
responsibility for anything).
We feel that the majority of Stanford students do
not feel a direct connection to the Hoover Institute.
We'd venture to guess that a good number of under
grads don't even know what it does, including Court
ney. So Nancy, why assume that students take respon
sibility for a thinktank that most students simply associ
ate with a giant phallic symbol in the middle of campus?
Sure, there are some people at Stanford who sup
port the war, and yes, we all pay taxes that go to
the government. But whether you agree with war
or not, it's doubtful that your feeble opinion actu
ally matters to President George W. Bush and his
policymakers anyway.
We're not saying it's silly to protest against a
cause that you believe in or that grass-roots activism
doesn't have the potential to cause social change. It's
just important to protest something that actually mat
ters now. We're not even sure what this protest was
about. Against war in general? Or against the war
with Iraq (which already happened)? Or perhaps
against the present occupation of Iraq by American
troops? Again, we're not sure. And it would seem
that the organizing committee of the event isn't so
sure either. Because if they are, it wasn't well com
municated.
The title of the protest itself, "Books not Bombs,"
doesn't give us any clues. It'd be nice if it were more
explanatory, but it's not. Books and bombs are not
mutually exclusive, as far as we know. Also, if they're
protesting in defense of education, it makes no sense
to skip classes, especially on a campus where the ma
jority of the faculty was against the war to begin with.
There's a lot of faulty logic here. The small num
ber of super-conservative Stanford affiliates are fo
cused on all the time. Condoleeza Rice does not repre
sent Stanford as a whole, because for every Condie there
are at least a couple Joel Beinins (a well known liberal
professor in the department of History).
We're not trying to make a political judgment
here; we clearly don't have the vocabulary or facility
to engage in that discussion, so if you're thinking
about writing us a letter about our politics, don't
bother — we won't write back with anything im
pressive. We'll probably just try to score a free din
ner out of it. We don't even agree with each other
on this issue.
But we do agree that we're in confusion on what
this protest was all about. Come on, Books Not
Bombs was SO 2003.

by the Hoover Institution, and that students take re
sponsibility for this connection."
Sorry Nancy, but we think you've got it all wrong.
We certainly don't take responsibility for the
Hoover Institution. We do, however, take responsi
bility for the success of the Stanford Shopping Center
through weekly, if not bi-weekly, visits. We take re
sponsibility for Moonbean's thriving business by
drinking at least one chai a day. We take responsibil
ity for Charles Shaw's booming enterprise (and after
consumption of their product take no absolutely no
responsibility for anything).
We feel that the majority of Stanford students do
not feel a direct connection to the Hoover Institute.
We'd venture to guess that a good number of under
grads don't even know what it does, including Court
ney. So Nancy, why assume that students take respon
sibility for a thinktank that most students simply associ
ate with a giant phallic symbol in the middle of campus?
Sure, there are some people at Stanford who sup
port the war, and yes, we all pay taxes that go to
the government. But whether you agree with war
or not, it's doubtful that your feeble opinion actu
ally matters to President George W. Bush and his
policymakers anyway.
We're not saying it's silly to protest against a
cause that you believe in or that grass-roots activism
doesn't have the potential to cause social change. It's
just important to protest something that actually mat
ters now. We're not even sure what this protest was
about. Against war in general? Or against the war
with Iraq (which already happened)? Or perhaps
against the present occupation of Iraq by American
troops? Again, we're not sure. And it would seem
that the organizing committee of the event isn't so
sure either. Because if they are, it wasn't well com
municated.
The title of the protest itself, "Books not Bombs,"
doesn't give us any clues. It'd be nice if it were more
explanatory, but it's not. Books and bombs are not
mutually exclusive, as far as we know. Also, if they're
protesting in defense of education, it makes no sense
to skip classes, especially on a campus where the ma
jority of the faculty was against the war to begin with.
There's a lot of faulty logic here. The small num
ber of super-conservative Stanford affiliates are fo
cused on all the time. Condoleeza Rice does not repre
sent Stanford as a whole, because for every Condie there
are at least a couple Joel Beinins (a well known liberal
professor in the department of History).
We're not trying to make a political judgment
here; we clearly don't have the vocabulary or facility
to engage in that discussion, so if you're thinking
about writing us a letter about our politics, don't
bother — we won't write back with anything im
pressive. We'll probably just try to score a free din
ner out of it. We don't even agree with each other
on this issue.
But we do agree that we're in confusion on what
this protest was all about. Come on, Books Not
Bombs was SO 2003.
