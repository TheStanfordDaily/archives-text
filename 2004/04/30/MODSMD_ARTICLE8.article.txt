# All the cool kids are doing it
## Thousands of Stanford students join facebook Web site 
### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
Classes are being skipped. Work is
being ignored. Students are spending hours
in front of their computers in utter fascina
tion. Thefacebook.com craze has swept
through campus.
As of publishing time, there were over 2,815
Stanford students registered on the newly
launched http:// www.thefacebook.com.
Modeled after social networking Web
sites like Friendster.com, this site provides
Stanford students with a network of their
peers. Students post and browse pictures of
themselves along with brief descriptions of
anything from gender and year in school to
music, movie tastes and relationship status.
"The online facebook is just what Stan
ford needs. It's a brilliant idea because it
connects names to photos and provides a
way to find out about someone without
even approaching them," said sophomore
Mike Rothenberg, who has over 115 friends
on the site.
Students have the ability to add and con
firm others as their friends. Friends of
friends become part of an extended social
network that can be visualized on the site.
The more friends one adds, the larger his or
her extended network becomes. A student
with just over 100 friends can have a net
work of over 1,500 people.
"I signed up on Tuesday morning and I
was immediately addicted," Rothenberg
said. "Nothing validates your social exis
tence like the knowledge that someone else
has approved you or is asking for your per
mission to list them as a friend. It's bonding
and flattering at the same time."
The site was created by Harvard Univer
sity sophomore Mark Zuckerberg. A dou

hie major in computer science and psychol
ogy, Zuckerberg wrote all of the code for
the site by himself in one week.
"There has been a bunch of hype at Har
vard for the last few months about the ad
ministration putting together an online
facebook for everyone in the school,"
Zuckerberg said. "I got tired of waiting for
them to finally put it up, so 1 just threw this
site together myself."
He launched the site on Feb. 6 at Har
vard, Feb. 25 at Columbia University, Feb.
26 at Stanford and Feb. 29 at Yale Universi
ty. Zuckerberg picked schools where the
site would generate a good response. He
told a few of his friends at each of these
schools to tell their friends about it, and the
rest is history.
More than 7,000 people have signed up
in less than a month at Harvard, including
85 percent of the school's undergraduates.
There have been over 1.5 million profile
views. In less than a week at Stanford, users
have viewed profiles almost 267,000 times.
There are over 10,000 users registered at
the four schools combined.
Zuckerberg wants'to build a huge net
work throughout many schools. The next
schools on his list are Cornell and Dartmouth,
whose sites should be up by tomorrow.
'i know it sounds corny, but I'd love to
improve people's lives, especially socially,"
Zuckerberg said.
The site seems to be expanding students'
romantic options. According to one ac
count, an anonymous Stanford male, a
sophomore, invited an attractive girl that he
didn't know to be his friend. She "con
firmed" the friendship (the standard proce
dure when an e-mail of friendship is sent)
and proceeded to ask the male out. They
are set to go out on their first date tonight.

Zuckerberg
has also received e
mails from people
telling him about
new relationships
they're in as a result
of the Web site.
"I'm not exact
ly sure how they come
about, but the site does
have a strange way of
bringing people to
gether," Zuckerberg
said. "I think that the
site also gives people a
better sense of those in
the communities
around them, and as
one Stanford student
wrote in an e-mail, 'it

brings classes to life' since he now knows
more about the students in them." The site
can also be used to connect with other stu
dents in your classes or who share your in
terests. Students can add the classes that
they are taking to their profiles. Sopho
more Greg Laughlin used'the site to find a
ride to the Coachella Valley Music Festi
val, as he guessed that there would be other
Radiohead music fans that would want to
go. He ended up receiving several e-mails
from students offering and requesting rides
to the concert.
"One person replied to the whole list to
say that she thought we should start some
sort of club based around this kind of
music," Laughlin said. "Another girl wrote
to say that there were a few concerts com
ing up at a place she likes and asked if some
people wanted to join her. In my opinion,
this is the point of the facebook concept.
Sure, its fun to look at a bunch of pictures
and interesting connections, but what really
matters is the facilitation of social interac
tion like this."
It is costing Zuckerberg $85 per month
to rent the server, with the money coming
out of his own pocket. He initially devel
oped the site just for Harvard students, but
it ran so efficiently that Zuckerberg realized
he could run other colleges off of the same
server for no additional cost. There are no
immediate plans for recuperating the start
up costs.
"In the future we may sell ads to get the
money back, but since providing the service
is so cheap, we may choose to not do that for
a while," Zuckerberg said.
There are many features unique to the
facebook.com that appeal specifically to
college students. When viewing some
one's profile, there are also links to Stan
ford Daily articles that the person has ap
peared in. If someone posts their AOL In
stant Messenger screenname, then the
person's most recent away message also
appears next to his or her profile. The site
also allows students to send messages to
one another.
This Web site is the latest addition to
Zuckerberg's repertoire of Web creations.
He was accused of breaching security, vio
lating copyrights and violating individual
privacy and faced school expulsion with his
last site conception, http://www.facemash.com,
which used photos from Harvard dorms'
online facebooks without permission and
placed pictures of two random Harvard un
dergraduates next to each other, asking
users to choose the "hotter" person.
This time, Zuckerberg has taken care
to ensure that he does not violate anyone's

privacy. Users can pick which parts of
their profile will be displayed to other
users and friends. In addition, only people
with stanford.edu or stanfordalumni.org
e-mail addresses can sign up for the Stan
ford Web site.
"1 really went out of my way to build ro
bust privacy settings so users have control
over who gets to see every part of their in
formation," Zuckerberg said.
He faced some scaling issues when the
Harvard site first went up, as he hadn't
expected more than a couple hundred
people to be using it at once. On some
nights, 10 percent of the university's stu
dents were online at the same time. After
receiving the overwhelming response,
Zuckerberg has worked to make things run
faster. So far, there haven't been any seri
ous technical problems.
"The server hasn't crashed â€” we've
been pretty good about that," Zuckerberg
said. "Sometimes we take the site down for
a few minutes to update parts of it, but
that's really the only time it's ever offline."
Some students are resisting theface
book.com craze, calling it a waste of time.
"It's a system designed for people who feel
insecure and need to numerically quantify
their friends." said senior Alejandro Foung.
For users intrigued by the ambiguity of
the "poking" function, the site's fre
quently asked questions section offers lit
tle explanation.
"We have about as much of an idea [of
what poking is] as you do," the site says.
"We thought it would be fun to make a fea
ture that has no specific purpose and to see
what happens from there. So mess around
with it, because you're not getting an expla
nation from us."
