## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
John Bravman
is the Bing Centen
nial Professor in
the departments of
Materials Science
and Engineering
and Electrical En
gineering (by cour
tesy). Bravman has

received both the School of Engineering
Distinguished Adviser Award and the Gores
Award for Excellence in Teaching. He
serves as the Freeman-Thornton Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education but
he still finds time to be dean of the residen
tial Freshman / Sophomore College.
With so much on his plate, we
thought we'd hit Bravman with our 10
random questions.
1) Yoii wake up at 4:30 a.m. to check e-mails
and don't go hack to sleep. Explain.

John Bravman: 1 don't sleep that much.
Maybe 30 hours a week.
2) What's the most boring part of your day?
1 think I'd be making something up. I rarely
find myself bored, although occasionally I
could use a little boredom, it feels like. But
frankly, I'd be making something up.
3) You have the world's largest collection of
DVDs, and you lend them out to students.
Doesn't that technically make you responsi
ble for the demise of FLiCKS-to-go?
Free market for video.
4) If you could change one thing about The
Daily, what would it he?
The Daily needs to employ fact-checkers
the way all responsible journalists or pa
pers do.
5) You've been at Stanford almost as long
as dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Why?

I've been at Stanford since 1975. Came as a
student, stayed for my doctorate, and then
joined the faculty. The real answer is, given
the opportunities, why leave?
6) People call you a bad-ass dean. Is that be
cause you're bad — or, something else?
This was a nickname invented by a stu
dent during the first year of FroSoCo
which has stuck.
7) Sources say you were at Full Moon on
the Quad, snapping photos of the
streakers. Was that... err ... for facul
ty purposes?
I was at Full Moon on the Quad shoot
ing pictures of everything. I haven't
been in about 10 years and so, 1 just
wanted to check it out. It was a great
time. A great tradition.
8) Hypothetical situation: You're on Stan
ford Administrators' Survivor and you have
to vote off Assistant Dean of Students and

Director of the Office of Student Activities
Nanci Howe or Associate Dean of Students
Morris Graves. Who'd get the boot —
and why?
I'm not going to answer that.
9. You host extravagant late-night study
breaks with Pizza Chicago. Aren't those
toppings damn weird?
They sure are.
10. Stanford kids say that you guys in
FroSoCo are cut off from the rest of society.
So — tell us the truth. How do you guys re
ally party down?
You'll have to ask the students how they
party. Rumor has it that it's uphill both
ways to FroSoCo and it always snows there.
But come visit the sunny warm west side of
campus and you'll find out.
