Erica Jong - always our keenest-eyed chronicler of the wonders and vagaries of sex and love - has found the perfect
subject fora witty and sensuous tale of a passionate woman ahead of her time. A generation of readers who have been
moved to laughter and recognition by Jong's heroines will be enchanted anew by her re-creation of the immortal poet.
Fear of Flying - Originally published in 1973, the groundbreaking, uninhibited story of Isadora Wing and her desire
to fly free caused a national sensation. It fueled fantasies, ignited debates, and even introduced a notorious new phrase
to the English language. Now, after thirty years, the revolutionary novel known as Fear of Flying still stands as a
timeless tale of self-discovery, liberation, and womanhood.
Sappho's Leap: A Novel - Sappho's Leap is a journey back 2,600 years to inhabit the mind of the greatest love
poet the world has ever known. At the age of fourteen, Sappho is seduced by the beautiful poet Alcaeus, plots with him
to overthrow the dictator of their island, and is caught and married off to a repellent older man in hopes that
matrimony will keep her out of trouble. Instead, it starts her off on a series of amorous adventures with both men and
women, taking her from Delphi to Egypt, and even to the Land of the Amazons and the shadowy realm of Hades.

Stanford Humanities Center and ASSU Speakers Bureau present Isabel Allende - "A Sense of Place"
Like many of her fictional characters, Isabel Allende has spent her life traveling to and living in many places. She was horn to diplomat parents in Lima in 1942, and when not in her Chilean
homeland, lived in Europe, Lebanon and Bolivia. Following the 1973 overthrow of Salvador Allende, Chile's president and Isabel's uncle, she lived in exile in Caracas for thirteen years. Since 1987,
when she met and married San Francisco lawyer William Gordon, she has lived and worked in Northern California. Allende's life in letters reflects the migrations of her personal life. It was from her
Caracas exile that she began on January 8, 1981 writing a "spiritual letter" to her dying grandfather. This text soon became her debut novel, La Casa de los espirittis (The House of the Spirits), and that
date has become a ceremonial and ritualistic starting point in the creation of all her subsequent works. We are fortunate, indeed, to welcome Isabel Allende to Stanford as a 2004 Presidential Lecturer.
