# SANS slate intends to appeal to all, reform ASSU
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
An all-male executive slate hasn't won a certi
fied ASSU election in at least the last four years.
But this isn't stopping sophomore Mark "Bergy"
Berghausen and junior Ethan Cantil-Voorhees in
their bid for the ASSU presidency and vice presi
dency, respectively.
"We have the utmost respect for women,"
Berghausen said. "Our doors will always be open to
all students, regardless of age, gender, race, ethnici
ty, sexual orientation, religion, creed, gender identi
ty, socioeconomic class or any other kind of division
you can imagine. We are about unifying the Stanford
student body, not dividing it.and that means we will
address women's issues without hesitation as though
they were our own."
Berghausen and Cantil-Voorhees said they are
running because they feel like the ASSU ignores stu
dent opinions and doesn't benefit most people on
campus. Instead of just sitting around and complain
ing about the problems, they decided to do some
thing about it.
"Special fees are too high, election turnouts are too
low and the only people who seem to run anymore are
The Chappie and people who are too involved in the
ASSU to have the perspective necessary to change the
system for the better," Berghausen said. "When the pre
vious election fell apart, we asked ourselves, if these
people can't run a campaign, should they really be run
ning the ASSU?'"
Berghausen is a double major in classics and linguis
tics. He is in the Band, a member of the Stanford Shake
speare Society and the Stanford Gaming Society and he

works for Stanford Sierra Camp. Cantil-
Voorhees is a public policy major and is
also in the Stanford Gaming Society. He
is from Prince of Wales Island, in South
east Alaska, where he has a pet deer.
Berghausen and Cantil-Voorheesare
calling their slate "SANS â€” Students for
ASSU Not Sucking," and their motto is
"Reasonably serious guys for seriously
reasonable change."
Berghausen and Cantil-Voorhees
said they were far from pleased with the
events of the April election.
"The last election was an example
of what can go wrong when those who
seek ASSU office put their own ambi
tions above their respect for the rules
and their fellow students,"
Berghausen said. "Because of this, we
don't think that the Gore /Cheney
style unification ticket [of Mikey Lee
and Alyssa Schwartz] has the respect
of most of campus. Although they
may have name-recognition, their
partner-dropping and rule-dodging
show that they don't have the strong
vision, integrity or leadership to guide
the ASSU."
Berghausen and Cantil-Voorhees
don't see any other slate as especially
threatening to their bid for presidency.
"Our most formidable competition,
however, is not any other slate, but
rather the apathy, frustration and dispas
sion that have been sown in the student
body by years of skyrocketing special
fees and distant ASSU leadership,"
Berghausen said.
The main goal of SANS is to unify

the campus behind an ASSU with a
renewed sense of purpose and direc
tion. They hope to accomplish this by
reforming the special-fees system to
make groups who receive funding re
sponsible to the entire campus. They
want to increase voter turnout by link
ing voting with refunds and by better
advertising the elections.
They also plan to make the ASSU
more visible and relevant to the stu
dent body by publicizing ASSU deal
ings in a bathroom newsletter and
seeking student opinion about their
actions. They want to talk to the Uni
versity administration to "resolve the
needs and injustices of the Stanford
campus," like getting sororities
housed on the Row, expanding the
points system, lowering Stanford Din
ing's overhead cost and increasing
graduate student participation in cam
pus activities and student life.
Part of the SANS campaign strate
gy is to break with the typical ASSU
campaign style.
"Rather than pushing pamphlets
on students in White Plaza, we will
have spectacles and visuals, over
which we will discuss our philosophy
and our position on the issues with
passersby," Berghausen said. "Be
cause we believe the ASSU should be
a place where students are comfort
able expressing their problems and is
sues, not a bothersome presence giv
ing students unwanted wastes of paper
and time, we will run our campaign in
accordance with our views. After all,
students can tell from a campaign what
kind of leadership to expect."
To reduce the cost of living, which is
just "too damned high," according to
Berghausen, SANS wants to bring in
more outside businesses like Subway
and reduce Stanford Dining overhead,

which makes one dining point cost $1.40.
They also plan to talk with Transporta
tion Services about expanding its dis
counted Caltrain pass program for grad
uate and undergraduate students to
make the surrounding area "more acces
sible for far less money." They also want
to talk to Residential Computing about
offering no-cost Internet access to stu
dents in their rooms.
"I will be voting for the SANS
slate," said sophomore Claire Milligan.
"Their ideas for bringing both the un
dergraduates and grad students togeth
er with the ASSU and their measures to
make housing and dining more afford
able for students made them stand out
in my mind. They would be a breath of
fresh air for the ASSU that could bring
in a new perspective without being to
tally ridiculous."
To improve student life, SANS
wants to talk to the president and
vice provosts about having better en
forcement of an Alcohol Policy
through a heavy enjphasis on individ
ual student responsibility. They ob
ject to the possible cancellations of
the Mausoleum Party or Full Moon
on the Quad because of the fear of
people drinking irresponsibly when
they could instead have better alco
hol education seminars during New
Student Orientation and over the
course of the year.
"We feel that student life has been
damaged by the administration in recent
years," Berghausen said. "Not that stu
dent life at all depends or revolves
around alcohol, but the atmosphere of
social repression that the administra
tion's ever-tightening restrictions on par
ties and the freshman experience has cre
ated is an ever-worsening problem for
the whole campus, not just fraternities
and freshman dorms."
