# SANS slate intends to appeal to all, reform ASSU
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
An all-male executive slate hasn't won a certi
fied ASSU election in at least the last four years.
But this isn't stopping sophomore Mark "Bergy"
Berghausen and junior Ethan Cantil-Voorhees in
their bid for the ASSU presidency and vice presi
dency, respectively.
"We have the utmost respect for women,"
Berghausen said. "Our doors will always be open to
all students, regardless of age, gender, race, ethnici
ty, sexual orientation, religion, creed, gender identi
ty, socioeconomic class or any other kind of division
you can imagine. We are about unifying the Stanford
student body, not dividing it.and that means we will
address women's issues without hesitation as though
they were our own."
Berghausen and Cantil-Voorhees said they are
running because they feel like the ASSU ignores stu
dent opinions and doesn't benefit most people on
campus. Instead of just sitting around and complain
ing about the problems, they decided to do some
thing about it.
"Special fees are too high, election turnouts are too
low and the only people who seem to run anymore are
The Chappie and people who are too involved in the
ASSU to have the perspective necessary to change the
system for the better," Berghausen said. "When the pre
vious election fell apart, we asked ourselves, if these
people can't run a campaign, should they really be run
ning the ASSU?'"
Berghausen is a double major in classics and linguis
tics. He is in the Band, a member of the Stanford Shake
speare Society and the Stanford Gaming Society and he
