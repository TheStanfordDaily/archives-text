## My journey to and at Stanford 
### JOHN HENNESSY UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT 
A few years back, during the "gold rush" years of the dot
com boom, quite a few students watched as fortunes
were made in Silicon Valley and wondered whether they
were squandering a great opportunity to "make it rich."
Of course, in hindsight, we know that many of those fortunes were
illusory, lost in the subsequent "dot-bomb" years.
But without the benefit of that 20 / 20 hindsight, I know many
students considered whether they should leave Stanford and
make a go of it elsewhere.

During that time period, I was fond of saying
that the second best thing I did in my career was
to start a company in Silicon Valley. I would then
make the point that the best thing I ever did was
to become a professor — and more specifically,
come to Stanford. I felt this observation was an
especially important one to make during a time
when many students were tempted to leave their
studies for the "greener pastures" of the Valley.
When I discuss my experience in a start-up with
groups of students, the next question invariably
asked is why I came back to Stanford, rather than

choosing to continue a promising career in industry. To under
stand that decision, it is important to understand how I decided to
pursue a doctorate and how I "decided" to come to Stanford.
Like most "big decisions" many factors played a part. But per
haps the most critical points in making the decision that led to
pursuing a doctorate came in my sophomore and junior years.
As a sophomore, 1 received my first real exposure to my major
— electrical engineering. I found it an intriguing subject and a
welcome switch from courses that were more preparatory in na
ture. It was also in that year that my love of teaching was Ignited
by the opportunity to work with other undergraduates, assisting
them in their first programming courses. As 1 began to take more
advanced courses, especially in computing, my interests in com
puter science grew.
During my junior year, I had the opportunity to get involved
in an undergraduate research project, working on the ideas that
preceded the modern microprocessor. It has a fascinating project
that further stimulated by interest in pursuing a doctorate in com
puter science. My own experience with undergraduate research
has convinced me of the importance of providing such opportuni
ties for Stanford undergraduates.
From the moment I entered graduate school, I knew that I
wanted to pursue a career as a professor, but where I would end
up was uncertain. I had the good fortune of settling on a thesis
topic early and of choosing a topic that increased in importance as
I neared completion of my thesis.
Stanford was the last of more than a dozen universities that I
interviewed at. I had many choices, but as you can guess, when I
received an offer from Stanford's Department of Electrical Engi
neering, I eagerly accepted!
Most of my 27 years at Stanford has been spent on teaching
and research. I have taught a range of undergraduate and gradu
ate courses, acted as advisor for more than 25 doctorate students
as well as a large number of master's and undergraduate students,
and co-authored both a graduate textbook and an undergraduate
textbook in computer architecture.
Today, those books are my primary connection to my disci
pline. Updating the material for new editions forces me to keep
up with the field and stay in touch with my colleagues across the
country, and I still enjoy seeing the texts, which are available in
more than eight languages, being used around the world.
When the time came to return to Stanford after my brief leave
in Silicon Valley from 1984 until 1985, it was not a difficult deci
sion. I enjoyed spending time in industry, working with talented
engineers on exciting products, but I did not want to spend my ca
reer there.
I would miss the interaction with students — in the classroom
and in the laboratory — too much. I would miss the freedom to
pursue new ideas that were revolutionary and far from ready for
commercialization. I would miss the free and wide ranging intel
lectual debate, which is the lifeblood of our campus.
So I returned to pursue my teaching and research during the
next eight or nine years with a new focus on parallel computing.
Starting almost ten years ago, I began serving in a series of pro
gressively more demanding administrative roles beginning with
chairman of Computer Science, moving on to dean of Engineer
ing and then to provost, and as president for the past three and
one-half years.
Why — you might ask — would someone who absolutely
loved teaching and research, who came back to campus to pur
sue those joys, accept a major administrative post? The answer
is complex.
It invariably includes dedication to Stanford and gratitude for
the opportunities that Stanford provided, as well as an interest in
serving the University. I have found the jobs of dean, provost and
president to be both challenging and immensely rewarding. The
exposure to Stanford's intellectual breadth and excellence is ex
citing. The complexity of the challenges is engaging. And the
range and capability of the members of the Stanford community
with whom you work is astonishing.
The job of president is by far the most challenging and most
exciting job I could imagine.
When I visit informally \Vith students, they often ask what ad
vice I might give them as they plan their time at Stanford, select a
major or contemplate a career. I share the advice that I followed:
Find something you love to do — something which engages you
deeply and passionately. Stanford offers so many opportunities.
Choose a few that you are truly committed to and build a founda
tion on which you can make an important positive contribution to
the world.

and research. I have taught a range of undergraduate and gradu
ate courses, acted as advisor for more than 25 doctorate students
as well as a large number of master's and undergraduate students,
and co-authored both a graduate textbook and an undergraduate
textbook in computer architecture.
Today, those books are my primary connection to my disci
pline. Updating the material for new editions forces me to keep
up with the field and stay in touch with my colleagues across the
country, and I still enjoy seeing the texts, which are available in
more than eight languages, being used around the world.
When the time came to return to Stanford after my brief leave
in Silicon Valley from 1984 until 1985, it was not a difficult deci
sion. I enjoyed spending time in industry, working with talented
engineers on exciting products, but I did not want to spend my ca
reer there.
I would miss the interaction with students — in the classroom
and in the laboratory — too much. I would miss the freedom to
pursue new ideas that were revolutionary and far from ready for
commercialization. I would miss the free and wide ranging intel
lectual debate, which is the lifeblood of our campus.
So I returned to pursue my teaching and research during the
next eight or nine years with a new focus on parallel computing.
Starting almost ten years ago, I began serving in a series of pro
gressively more demanding administrative roles beginning with
chairman of Computer Science, moving on to dean of Engineer
ing and then to provost, and as president for the past three and
one-half years.
Why — you might ask — would someone who absolutely
loved teaching and research, who came back to campus to pur
sue those joys, accept a major administrative post? The answer
is complex.
It invariably includes dedication to Stanford and gratitude for
the opportunities that Stanford provided, as well as an interest in
serving the University. I have found the jobs of dean, provost and
president to be both challenging and immensely rewarding. The
exposure to Stanford's intellectual breadth and excellence is ex
citing. The complexity of the challenges is engaging. And the
range and capability of the members of the Stanford community
with whom you work is astonishing.
The job of president is by far the most challenging and most
exciting job I could imagine.
When I visit informally \Vith students, they often ask what ad
vice I might give them as they plan their time at Stanford, select a
major or contemplate a career. I share the advice that I followed:
Find something you love to do — something which engages you
deeply and passionately. Stanford offers so many opportunities.
Choose a few that you are truly committed to and build a founda
tion on which you can make an important positive contribution to
the world.

A few years back, during the "gold rush" years of the dot
com boom, quite a few students watched as fortunes
were made in Silicon Valley and wondered whether they
were squandering a great opportunity to "make it rich."
Of course, in hindsight, we know that many of those fortunes were
illusory, lost in the subsequent "dot-bomb" years.
But without the benefit of that 20 / 20 hindsight, I know many
students considered whether they should leave Stanford and
make a go of it elsewhere.

During that time period, I was fond of saying
that the second best thing I did in my career was
to start a company in Silicon Valley. I would then
make the point that the best thing I ever did was
to become a professor — and more specifically,
come to Stanford. I felt this observation was an
especially important one to make during a time
when many students were tempted to leave their
studies for the "greener pastures" of the Valley.
When I discuss my experience in a start-up with
groups of students, the next question invariably
asked is why I came back to Stanford, rather than

choosing to continue a promising career in industry. To under
stand that decision, it is important to understand how I decided to
pursue a doctorate and how I "decided" to come to Stanford.
Like most "big decisions" many factors played a part. But per
haps the most critical points in making the decision that led to
pursuing a doctorate came in my sophomore and junior years.
As a sophomore, 1 received my first real exposure to my major
— electrical engineering. I found it an intriguing subject and a
welcome switch from courses that were more preparatory in na
ture. It was also in that year that my love of teaching was Ignited
by the opportunity to work with other undergraduates, assisting
them in their first programming courses. As 1 began to take more
advanced courses, especially in computing, my interests in com
puter science grew.
During my junior year, I had the opportunity to get involved
in an undergraduate research project, working on the ideas that
preceded the modern microprocessor. It has a fascinating project
that further stimulated by interest in pursuing a doctorate in com
puter science. My own experience with undergraduate research
has convinced me of the importance of providing such opportuni
ties for Stanford undergraduates.
From the moment I entered graduate school, I knew that I
wanted to pursue a career as a professor, but where I would end
up was uncertain. I had the good fortune of settling on a thesis
topic early and of choosing a topic that increased in importance as
I neared completion of my thesis.
Stanford was the last of more than a dozen universities that I
interviewed at. I had many choices, but as you can guess, when I
received an offer from Stanford's Department of Electrical Engi
neering, I eagerly accepted!
Most of my 27 years at Stanford has been spent on teaching
and research. I have taught a range of undergraduate and gradu
ate courses, acted as advisor for more than 25 doctorate students
as well as a large number of master's and undergraduate students,
and co-authored both a graduate textbook and an undergraduate
