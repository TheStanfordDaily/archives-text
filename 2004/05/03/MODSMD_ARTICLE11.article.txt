# NEW BALLER IN TOWN
## Students found group for non-varsity competitive tennis 
### ERIK J. HOPE 
Stanford sports enthusiasts know the varsi
ty tennis team for its excellence on the court.
They may also know that few opportunities
exist for competitive players who are unable
to play at the varsity level. Founders of the
Stanford Competitive Tennis Club sopho
more Vinay Mahagoakar and freshman
Michael Chow hope to fill this void.
The two first met at the Northern Califor
nia Championship co-ed team tennis tourna
ment held at Stanford last fall. The tourna
ment was designed for non-varsity tennis
players, and eight teams from schools in the
area competed. After learning that the tour
nament was to be held at Stanford, Ma
hagoakar and Chow worked separately to
gather players to represent Stanford on
a team.
At the tournament, Chow and Mahagoakar
realized that they both felt that there were
not enough opportunities on campus for non
varsity tennis players to play competitively.
After seeing the organized Cal club team
take first and second place. Chow and Ma
hagoakar decided that they wanted to start a
similar club at Stanford.
Chow and Mahagoakar said they were frus
trated with the situation for non-varsity ten
nis players at Stanford.
"The varsity team here is one of the best
in the country, but when I arrived on campus
I noticed that if you weren't on the team,
you really didn't get to play tennis," Ma
hagoakar said.
After the tournament, Chow and Ma
hagoakar started working on forming the
club. They met with the head of the tennis
portion of Stanford's physical education cur
riculum, Anne Gould, to discuss their idea for
the new club.
Gould agreed with Chow and Mahagoakar
that the opportunities for non-varsity tennis
players were insufficient.
"There are many excellent tennis players at
Stanford who have not had a way to continue
competing who really would like to. The Stan
ford Club Tennis Team gives them this oppor
tunity," Gould said.
Gould told Mahagoakar and Chow that
since there already was a varsity tennis team

open to anyone
who is interested
in attending.

at Stanford, the new club team was not eligi-

ble for University funding. This meant that

the club needed to find an alternative

source of support. Gould, Chow and

Mahagoakar worked together to ex-

plore the options, and together

they decided to approach the
Stanford Tennis Club, or

STC, about forming a
competitive team.

The STC has been

active on campus
since October
2000, and is

officially recognized as a student
group. It provides an opportunity
for Stanford students to meet and
play tennis, and also has a ladder
and holds occasional tournaments.
It had never supported a competi
tive intercollegiate team before,

and its leadership happily accept
ed Mahagoakar and Michael's
proposal to found one.
From the beginning, Gould
has played an extremely impor
tant role in realizing the club, ac-

cording to the founders. She helped
Chow and Mahagoakar reserve courts

for practice, and she advertised the team
by announcing its formation and practice
times to all of her classes. Despite her contri
butions, Gould said that it was the initiative
on the part of Chow and Mahagoakar that got
the team started.
"I give Mike and Vinay all the credit for
forming the team. They took an idea of theirs
and made it a reality," Gould said.
The team held its first informational meet
ing earlier in the quarter. The meeting showed
a lot of interest, according to Mahagoakar and
Chow. About 40 people came to the meeting,
and there are now regularly 20 players at each
practice. While the founders are thrilled with
the success of their club, the number of play
ers who are interested in the team poses its

The club only has four courts avail
able, and with as many as 40 poten-

tial players, it is difficult to get ev
eryone time on the court at prac-

tice. The team also has a ladder
to determine who will play

competitively since the
number of players re-

quired fora competitive

team is fewer than the
number of players who

come to practice.
Despite the diffi-

culties in accommo
dating all of the
players, practice is

'The varsity team here is one of the
best in the country, but, when I
arrived on campus, I noticed that
if you weren't on the team, you
really didn't get to play tennis."

"Ideally, we want as many people to come out
and hit whenever they want," Mhagoakar said.
On Saturday, April 24, the team played its
first scheduled match against UC-Berkeley.
Stanford compiled a 3-8 record in singles and
a 1-4 record in doubles. Despite the loss, the
team considers its first match a success and is
looking forward to playing more in the future.
Since schools on the semester system are
finishing their school years now, Stanford will
probably not play its next match until next
year. The team hopes to play other club teams
from schools like UC-Berkeley and UC-Los
Angeles, as well as varsity teams from Divi
sion 111 schools.
In addition to these immediate plans,
Chow and Mahagoakar have more ambitious
goals for the team. They hope to host a club
tournament at Stanford to bring
more tennis to campus as well as raise money.
The organizers also hope to form a"club
league" to coordinate club tennis teams and
make it easier for schools to form their
own teams.
For the remainder of the school year, the
team will continue to hold open practices
every Tuesday and Thursday at the west
campus courts.
