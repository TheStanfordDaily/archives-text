## Loan policies need revision 
### 
As ('ongress debates the merits of reautho
rizing the Higher Education Act this year,
it has encountered one of the most con
tentious questions of the term: How
should college debt be structured? We believe that
loans must be offered with a low interest rate for stu
dents who struggle to pay for college. Such students
should not face the same fluctuating interest rates
that the wider population does — they should be able
to incur debt without having to worry about high mar
ket interest rates. I lowever, change does need to take
place, for the current system is flawed.
College students today can consolidate their loans
and be guaranteed interest rates as low as 3.5 percent.
When market rates fall below that fixed rate, the
lenders keep the additional profit. When market
rates rise above that fixed rate, however, the federal
government makes up the difference to lenders.
This has become an increasingly expensive re
sponsibility for the government. According to the
General Accounting Office, the cost of subsidizing
student loans rose to $2.1 billion in the 2003 fiscal
year from $650 million in the 2002 fiscal year. In re
sponse. House Democrats have proposed legislation
to replace the fixed rates with variable rates that
would fluctuate as the market does. This would in
crease the total amount college graduates had to pay
by $3,115 to $5,484. according to the Congressional
Research Service.
Meanwhile, House Republicans have proposed
requiring lenders to give the profits earned from stu
dent loans to the government. They claim that the
current system provides excessive subsidies to
lenders. Turning the profits over to the government
would ease the government's burden in making up
the rate deficit, or the funds could be used for pro
grams to make college more affordable for low- and
middle-income students.
Both parties agree that reform is necessary, but
the shape that reform will take is still unclear as the
proposals remain hypothetical and controversial.
Both proposals also enjoy bipartisan support. Propo
nents of the proposed Democratic reform believe
that the current beneficiaries of the debt program are
working adults who can afford to pay market interest
rates and that the government should use this money
to help current students struggling to pay for college.
Critics charge that Congress should not create legis
lation making college more expensive while big banks
reap the benefits of high interest rates.
Proponents of the Republican plan believe it will
help the government provide the necessary financial
resources to students without further burdening tax
payers. Critics argue that a large portion of some
lenders' profits come from the discrepancy in interest

rates and they will lose an incentive to lend if they do
not have the possibility of earning interest above mar
ket rates.
We believe that Congress has not given the issue
sufficient consideration. This has the potential to af
fect tens of thousands of college graduates each year.
While all of the nuances of the debate have yet to
come to light, it appears that the college debt / loans
system does need to be reworked. The government
cannot afford to continue paying the difference in in
terest each year.
At the same time, however, many students will be
more hesitant to take out college loans if they are not
guaranteed the low interest rates they are currently
offered. This would then put further financial strains
on students — it is unfair that students who qualify
for financial aid in the form of loans may be burdened
with the same loan interest rates as those who do not
qualify for financial aid. Student loans should not be
saddled with market interest rates. If possible, anoth
er solution must be found that will ease the govern
ment's financial burden without putting undue finan
cial pressure on 18-year-olds.
We propose a combination of these two reforms,
with some alterations. Recent college graduates
should be guaranteed a fixed interest rate until they
are able to establish themselves in the workfoice and
earn a steady income. This can be determined either
by years out of school or income. Once students have
been out of school fora certain number of years, to be
established by Congress, they should be able to sup
port themselves and should not have to rely upon the
generous low interest rates granted them while they
were students.
Alternatively, if years out of school seems too sub
jective a criterion. Congress can set a baseline income
level at which point graduates' access to the low in
terest rate will be terminated. This may have the un
desirable side effect, however, of discouraging gradu
ates from attaining jobs with this salary level. This
consequence is unlikely, however, as the higher
salaries should provide more than enough compensa
tion incentive to take the job. Either option should
prompt students and recent graduates to pay off their
loans quickly, before their interest rates are subject to
market fluctuations.
As long as students and recent graduates are sub
ject to the fixed interest rate, we agree with House
Republicans that the amount in excess of the market
rate (as occurs when the market rate is below the
fixed rate) should be returned to the government.
Ideally, however, this fixed rate would only apply to
students and recent graduates fora few years, so the
money made by the government under this new poli
cy would be minimal.

This has become an increasingly expensive re
sponsibility for the government. According to the
General Accounting Office, the cost of subsidizing
student loans rose to $2.1 billion in the 2003 fiscal
year from $650 million in the 2002 fiscal year. In re
sponse. House Democrats have proposed legislation
to replace the fixed rates with variable rates that
would fluctuate as the market does. This would in
crease the total amount college graduates had to pay
by $3,115 to $5,484. according to the Congressional
Research Service.
Meanwhile, House Republicans have proposed
requiring lenders to give the profits earned from stu
dent loans to the government. They claim that the
current system provides excessive subsidies to
lenders. Turning the profits over to the government
would ease the government's burden in making up
the rate deficit, or the funds could be used for pro
grams to make college more affordable for low- and
middle-income students.
Both parties agree that reform is necessary, but
the shape that reform will take is still unclear as the
proposals remain hypothetical and controversial.
Both proposals also enjoy bipartisan support. Propo
nents of the proposed Democratic reform believe
that the current beneficiaries of the debt program are
working adults who can afford to pay market interest
rates and that the government should use this money
to help current students struggling to pay for college.
Critics charge that Congress should not create legis
lation making college more expensive while big banks
reap the benefits of high interest rates.
Proponents of the Republican plan believe it will
help the government provide the necessary financial
resources to students without further burdening tax
payers. Critics argue that a large portion of some
lenders' profits come from the discrepancy in interest

rates and they will lose an incentive to lend if they do
not have the possibility of earning interest above mar
ket rates.
We believe that Congress has not given the issue
sufficient consideration. This has the potential to af
fect tens of thousands of college graduates each year.
While all of the nuances of the debate have yet to
come to light, it appears that the college debt / loans
system does need to be reworked. The government
cannot afford to continue paying the difference in in
terest each year.
At the same time, however, many students will be
more hesitant to take out college loans if they are not
guaranteed the low interest rates they are currently
offered. This would then put further financial strains
on students — it is unfair that students who qualify
for financial aid in the form of loans may be burdened
with the same loan interest rates as those who do not
qualify for financial aid. Student loans should not be
saddled with market interest rates. If possible, anoth
er solution must be found that will ease the govern
ment's financial burden without putting undue finan
cial pressure on 18-year-olds.
We propose a combination of these two reforms,
with some alterations. Recent college graduates
should be guaranteed a fixed interest rate until they
are able to establish themselves in the workfoice and
earn a steady income. This can be determined either
by years out of school or income. Once students have
been out of school fora certain number of years, to be
established by Congress, they should be able to sup
port themselves and should not have to rely upon the
generous low interest rates granted them while they
were students.
Alternatively, if years out of school seems too sub
jective a criterion. Congress can set a baseline income
level at which point graduates' access to the low in
terest rate will be terminated. This may have the un
desirable side effect, however, of discouraging gradu
ates from attaining jobs with this salary level. This
consequence is unlikely, however, as the higher
salaries should provide more than enough compensa
tion incentive to take the job. Either option should
prompt students and recent graduates to pay off their
loans quickly, before their interest rates are subject to
market fluctuations.
As long as students and recent graduates are sub
ject to the fixed interest rate, we agree with House
Republicans that the amount in excess of the market
rate (as occurs when the market rate is below the
fixed rate) should be returned to the government.
Ideally, however, this fixed rate would only apply to
students and recent graduates fora few years, so the
money made by the government under this new poli
cy would be minimal.
As ('ongress debates the merits of reautho
rizing the Higher Education Act this year,
it has encountered one of the most con
tentious questions of the term: How
should college debt be structured? We believe that
loans must be offered with a low interest rate for stu
dents who struggle to pay for college. Such students
should not face the same fluctuating interest rates
that the wider population does — they should be able
to incur debt without having to worry about high mar
ket interest rates. I lowever, change does need to take
place, for the current system is flawed.
College students today can consolidate their loans
and be guaranteed interest rates as low as 3.5 percent.
When market rates fall below that fixed rate, the
lenders keep the additional profit. When market
rates rise above that fixed rate, however, the federal
government makes up the difference to lenders.
