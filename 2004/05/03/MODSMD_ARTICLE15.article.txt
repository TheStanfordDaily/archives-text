# YANKEES SUCK
## Cops must stop stopping bikers 
### 
So I'm riding down (he street
on my bike on a lovely
spring day when out of
nowhere this woman in a
green suit leaps out of the bushes
and yells, "Stop your bike!" I try to
ignore her and just keep on biking,
but she is relentless and starts chas
ing me down the street, like the
mongoose to my snake. When I
think I'm about to escape, a man in
an identical green suit pops out of
the other side of the bushes in front
of me, rendering my resistance fu
tile. Dejectedly. I pull to the side of
the road as the green suited bush
jumpers close in on me.
This may sound like a nightmare
to you, but to many-a-resident of
West Campus, this scene is all too
real. I have to be honest and admit
that I have not personally incurred
the wrath of the green-suited bike
police, but I have seen more than
one unsuspecting biker broadsided
by this stop-sign trap before.
Call it the gauntlet: the one
block stretch on Santa Teresa
Street from the front of the Roble
parking lot to the intersection with
Lomita Drive, notorious for its
seemingly omnipresent Stanford
police stake-outs. If you're riding
after 8 p.m. and don't have a bike
light. I suggest you find an alternate
route unless you have some bling to
spare. And you can be almost guar
anteed that the one day you're
rushing to class — especially dur
ing midterms or finals season —
the bike battalion is lying in wait. If
they snipe you. you'd better be pre
pared to fork over $100 plus.
Now this tactic has been moder
ately effective. As a two-year West
Campus resident, 1 have gotten in
the habit of the rolling stop, making
me the butt of jokes for East and
Central Campus riding companions
who are unaware of the existence of
this police state.

And I can understand why obliv
ious bikers do pose a legitimate safe
ty concern. When I'm not on my
bike, I tend to zip around in my

Green Torpedo,
which has come
dangerously close
to ramming er
rant cyclists (as
well as the girl
lying in the Casa
Italiana parking
lot talking on the
phone the other
day who I almost

didn't see, but that's another story).
But as the stake-outs become
more and more frequent, it's time to
stop and realize that this situation is
nothing short of ludicrous.
Here's a true story to illustrate
the point: A friend who wishes to
remain anonymous because he's
not sure his case has yet been offi
cially cleared from the F. 8.1, files is
riding toward Tresidder. He may
or may not have run a stop sign. He
is stopped by the green-suits and
subsequently given an $85 ticket.
Livid at this violation of his Eighth
Amendment protection against
cruel and unusual punishment, he
appeals his case. After pleading no
contest, a judge tells him he was
fined at the automobile-level and
reduces the fine to bike-level: $10.
But our biker never receives notifi
cation to pay his fine and leaves the
country to pursue other academic
endeavors. In his absence, he is
sent notice that he needs to post
bond of over $200 and several
months later is told a warrant was
issued for his arrest.
I'm sure that'd go over well in
prison: "Yeah. 1 got four days of
hard time for running a stop sign on
my bicycle."
And the situation is only getting
worse. Now the run-of-the-mill
stop-sign violation of bicycle rid

ers carries a $140 fine.
Students are finding ways to
cope. West Lag residents, for exam
ple, have deployed the dorm chat
list to alert fellow residents when
stake-outs are afoot. Some people
have just resorted to walking their
hike if they're around streets to
avoid inadvertently getting a ticket
for breaking a rule they weren't
even aware of.
To the credit of the Department
of Public Safety, in the last week
there have at least been efforts to
warn unsuspecting students (who
tend not to have $140 to spare) that
the green-suits are lurking down the
road. Somebody has spray painted
"Bikes Must Stop" along Santa
Teresa before the stop signs, and
last time the cops were on the prowl,
they set up signs telling bikers that
traffic enforcement was ahead.
But this is treating the symptoms
rather than the problem. 1 get per
turbed when I have to pay a $15
Green Library fine when a DVD is
two hours overdue. Getting a bike
ticket for $20 would be just as likely
to get me to start braking on my way
to class as a ticket for $140. The only
difference is the second one makes
students resent the campus police,
waste time appealing their ticket in
court and generally bolster their de
sire to fight The Man.
Safety's a necessary goal, but there
are certainly more reasonable ways
to achieve it than by ripping off half a
quarter's worth of textbook money
from harried college students.
Hear that, round two ASSU ex
ecutive candidates? Fix that shizzity
and I'll hook you up with my vote.

Jen Graham is a junior who is more
than happy to tell you about her sim
ilarly ludicrous $336 parking ticket
that she got at 1:20 a.m. If you know
how to escape the green-suits, e-mail
