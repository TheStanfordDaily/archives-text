# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## Daily 'endorses' Chris Holt 
### 
There are many slates run
ning this year, and many of
them very well qualified.
Historically, The Daily's
editorial staff has supported an in
sider in the ASSU for the executive
slate. But this year, we support the
outsider, the person who has no
ASSU experience and is therefore
not bogged down in petty politics.
This year, we feel Chris Holt is just
such an inexperienced outsider.
Holt has never served on the
ASSU. Nor has he served in his high
school's student government. In ele
mentary school, he wasn't even
elected to lead the class out to re
cess. In fact, in pretty much any race
he has ever run.he has lost. There
fore, this man is free of any of the
ties of interest groups, and we can
not foresee him panhandling to any
organization. No. he has boldly re
mained on the outside: shrugging
the ties of loyalty, the bonds of re
sponsibility and the votes that would
make him a politician.
The Daily acknowledges the
great works of the other candidates.
Lee / Schwartz provided weeks of
entertainment during the last elec
tion, especially with their realistic
looking mudslinging and opponent
bashing. We're glad they could put
that behind them to form the Ex-
Husbands slate. However, those
two-timing, lazy, sleep-with-his-sec
retary-while-I-take-the-kids-to-soc-
cer-practice bastards don't get my
vote. Only my alimony bills.
Mark Berghausen and Ethan
Cantil-Voorhees's slate "SANS" is
interesting. "SANS" means "with
out" in French. This is ironic, of
course, because they have a good
four-letter edge in the "longest can
didate name" category. Their slogan
is appropriate though, because their
posters are "sans" color. What does

it say about their commitment that
they wouldn't spend the extra five
cents at Kinkos for color?
Chioke Borgelt-Mose and Kory
Vargas Caro's have formed the
"Let's Get Real" slate. This is the
story of two Stanford students who
stopped being polite and starting
getting real. By "getting real" of
course, they mean engaging in the
childish, petty, knock-down drag
out soap opera that is the executive
election. Any resemblance to
MTV's "The Real World" is tragi
cally coincidental.
Barrett Sheridan and Tam Vo's
"BS-TV" has already been marred
by controversy. The ticket is split
over the issue of: "How sober are
we?" While Vo initially stated that
they are more sober than The
Chappie, Sheridan recanted the
statement later, and said that he in
fact is less sober than The Chap
pie, but more sober than SAE. Be
sides sending mixed messages to
the voters, we also must denounce
Sheridan for ruining a perfectly
good joke.
The Chappie slate's Matt
Henick and Charlie Stockman are
running once more. When they
first ran a few weeks ago. Stock
man was a senior and Henick was a
junior. In last Tuesday's Daily,
("Motley crew runs for ASSU ex
ecutive slate in special election,"
April 27) they were listed as both
juniors. Politics has apparently
made Stockman younger, defying
the medical condition known as
"Nixonism." As always, their sati
rizing of the ASSU election pro
cess is "refreshing." Even if they do
it every year.
As great as all these candidates
are, none of their campaigns are
particularly groundbreaking.
Holt's strategy, however, is noth

ing short of revolutionary. He ac
tively campaigned among the
profros last weekend, seeking out
the class of '08's vote. While other
candidates have been claiming that
they are making plans for the fu
ture, he is the only one to actually
listen to the future generation of
Stanford students. Holt explained:
"The profros are our future. I want
ed to understand their perspective
on special fees, the isolation of the
ASSU and the meal plan system.
They have the purest view of it all
because they have no idea what
these issues are."
Holt has no affiliations with The
Daily's staff. None whatsoever.
Until next week, that is, when peo
ple will figure out that he has in fact
worked for The Daily for quite some
time. Therefore, our endorsement
of him is completely meaningless.
The whole affair will become a big
brouhaha, but in the end that won't
affect the election at all. Except for
whert it goes before the Undergrad
uate Senate and Graduate Student
Council, in which case this entire
process will start over again.
When reached for comment
about why he chose to run. Holt
stated: "Well, at dusk a couple of
days ago, I saw White Plaza in its
naked beauty. The walls around the
Claw were spotless, the sun was just
setting and the fountain was
rustling peacefully. I just thought.
Hey, this place needs more cam
paign fliers.' "

This editorial expresses the views of
the entire Daily staff (not really).
But he's not running. So vote for
SANS, US-TV. or The Chappie in
stead. E-mail him at cholt@stan
ford.edu before the campaign dead
line; he doesn't want to pull a Nick
Rodriguez.

days ago, I saw White Plaza in its
naked beauty. The walls around the
Claw were spotless, the sun was just
setting and the fountain was
rustling peacefully. I just thought.
Hey, this place needs more cam
paign fliers.' "

This editorial expresses the views of
the entire Daily staff (not really).
But he's not running. So vote for
SANS, US-TV. or The Chappie in
stead. E-mail him at cholt@stan
ford.edu before the campaign dead
line; he doesn't want to pull a Nick
Rodriguez.
There are many slates run
ning this year, and many of
them very well qualified.
Historically, The Daily's
editorial staff has supported an in
sider in the ASSU for the executive
slate. But this year, we support the
outsider, the person who has no
ASSU experience and is therefore
not bogged down in petty politics.
This year, we feel Chris Holt is just
such an inexperienced outsider.
Holt has never served on the
ASSU. Nor has he served in his high
school's student government. In ele
mentary school, he wasn't even
elected to lead the class out to re
cess. In fact, in pretty much any race
he has ever run.he has lost. There
fore, this man is free of any of the
ties of interest groups, and we can
not foresee him panhandling to any
organization. No. he has boldly re
mained on the outside: shrugging
the ties of loyalty, the bonds of re
sponsibility and the votes that would
make him a politician.
The Daily acknowledges the
great works of the other candidates.
Lee / Schwartz provided weeks of
entertainment during the last elec
tion, especially with their realistic
looking mudslinging and opponent
bashing. We're glad they could put
that behind them to form the Ex-
Husbands slate. However, those
two-timing, lazy, sleep-with-his-sec
retary-while-I-take-the-kids-to-soc-
cer-practice bastards don't get my
vote. Only my alimony bills.
Mark Berghausen and Ethan
Cantil-Voorhees's slate "SANS" is
interesting. "SANS" means "with
out" in French. This is ironic, of
course, because they have a good
four-letter edge in the "longest can
didate name" category. Their slogan
is appropriate though, because their
posters are "sans" color. What does

it say about their commitment that
they wouldn't spend the extra five
cents at Kinkos for color?
Chioke Borgelt-Mose and Kory
Vargas Caro's have formed the
"Let's Get Real" slate. This is the
story of two Stanford students who
stopped being polite and starting
getting real. By "getting real" of
course, they mean engaging in the
childish, petty, knock-down drag
out soap opera that is the executive
election. Any resemblance to
MTV's "The Real World" is tragi
cally coincidental.
Barrett Sheridan and Tam Vo's
"BS-TV" has already been marred
by controversy. The ticket is split
over the issue of: "How sober are
we?" While Vo initially stated that
they are more sober than The
Chappie, Sheridan recanted the
statement later, and said that he in
fact is less sober than The Chap
pie, but more sober than SAE. Be
sides sending mixed messages to
the voters, we also must denounce
Sheridan for ruining a perfectly
good joke.
The Chappie slate's Matt
Henick and Charlie Stockman are
running once more. When they
first ran a few weeks ago. Stock
man was a senior and Henick was a
junior. In last Tuesday's Daily,
("Motley crew runs for ASSU ex
ecutive slate in special election,"
April 27) they were listed as both
juniors. Politics has apparently
made Stockman younger, defying
the medical condition known as
"Nixonism." As always, their sati
rizing of the ASSU election pro
cess is "refreshing." Even if they do
it every year.
As great as all these candidates
are, none of their campaigns are
particularly groundbreaking.
Holt's strategy, however, is noth

ing short of revolutionary. He ac
tively campaigned among the
profros last weekend, seeking out
the class of '08's vote. While other
candidates have been claiming that
they are making plans for the fu
ture, he is the only one to actually
listen to the future generation of
Stanford students. Holt explained:
"The profros are our future. I want
ed to understand their perspective
on special fees, the isolation of the
ASSU and the meal plan system.
They have the purest view of it all
because they have no idea what
these issues are."
Holt has no affiliations with The
Daily's staff. None whatsoever.
Until next week, that is, when peo
ple will figure out that he has in fact
worked for The Daily for quite some
time. Therefore, our endorsement
of him is completely meaningless.
The whole affair will become a big
brouhaha, but in the end that won't
affect the election at all. Except for
whert it goes before the Undergrad
uate Senate and Graduate Student
Council, in which case this entire
process will start over again.
When reached for comment
about why he chose to run. Holt
stated: "Well, at dusk a couple of
