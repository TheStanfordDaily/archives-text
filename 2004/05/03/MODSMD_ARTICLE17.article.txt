Daily's columnists lack respect for
international faculty, lAs
I am writing in response to two recent
columns. "101 Things to do at Stanford"
(April 28) written by Mac Levine and
"Education's future is in reruns" (April
23), by A.J. Magnuson express the
columnists' perspectives on non-native
English speaking students and teaching
assistants on campus. As a TA from
Hong Kong, I find Levine's and Magnu
son's comments, corftain certain racial
and discriminatory comments that war
rant readers' attention. It is dishearten
ing to learn that Stanford undergraduate
education fails to teach students what di
versity on campus is actually about.
First, Magnuson wjites in his article
that the undecipherable Chinese accent
of his calculus' professor makes lecture
useless, despite the fact that he and his
classmate try their best to "replicate the
sounds to extract meaning out of it." I
wonder whether Magrruson has actual
ly lifted his strong biceps to ask the pro
fessor to repeat what he says, instead of
complaining about it with classmates. I
am not writing to deny the fact that
some international TAs have strong ac
cents and may hurt the delicate ears of
some students, including Levine and
Magnuson. Rather, I am here to suggest
students learn to listen to people that

speak with an accent. We live in a di
verse and globalized society, and the
majority of the world does not speak
English with an American accent. 1 sin
cerely hope that Magnuson will never
have to travel to or work in a non-En
glish speaking countiy and speak the
country's language using what he learns
from tapes or courses. Imagine being
laughed at by someone when you are
trying to speak Chinese or Japanese or
German with an American accent.
Don't blush or feel unhappy about it.
Just remember that we laugh at you the
way that you laugh at us. We have no
idea what you are saying with your
American accent. However, at least we
try very hard to listen and ask you to
speak slowly and repeat it.
Second, I feel sorry that I missed the
valuable opportunity to be a TA for
Magnuson's sociology class, of which
the lectures consist of "50 minutes of a
blinding white light from a projector re
fracting off an old timer's nude head."
Maybe next time, Magnuson should
ask his professors to remove all lecture
notes from the Web site so that he can
actually pay some attention in class to
copy the notes. I think students should
realize that professors or lecturers have
no obligation to put their lecture notes
online. This service should not serve as
an encouragement for students to skip

class. If Magnuson finds the lectures so
useless, he should start a petition and
ask the professors either to disappear
or to stop posting the lecture notes on
the Weh.
Levine has to be the best buddy of
Magnuson, because both of them have
serious problems dealing with non-na
tive English speakers on campus.
Levine states in his original article that
the new admits should "take one econ
section that is taught by aTA whose na
tive language is English." Even though
I am not an econ graduate student, per
haps 1 should apologize on behalf of the
Economics Department to all Stanford
students who have taken an econ sec
tion with a non-native speaking TA or
professor. I should also take this chance
to apologize to all students who have
been in my sociology sections for hav
ing to endure me fora full quarter.
By the way, Levine should consult
Magnuson to come up with a list of
courses and companies that have non
native instructors for the sake of pro
tecting their hearing. 1 pray that they
will not have to take any classes in grad
uate schools (if they do attend) or join a
company that has any non-native
speakers. I think their hearing sensation
trumps the importance of learning how
to live in a diverse environment with no
stigmas, prejudice and discriminations.

If Levine and Magnuson prefer, I am
willing to write to University President
Hennessy to recommend new admis
sion policies to the Board of Trustees
that only international students with a
strong American accent can be accept
ed to graduate programs, faculty and
staff positions on campus. It would not
be fun to see a headline in The New
York Times claiming that Stanford stu
dents need to wear hearing aids because
of the damage caused by non-native
speaking people on campus.

GSC election should not
have been certified
At the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) meeting on April 21,1 saw the
face of corruption, and it looked like a
regular graduate student. Or a number
of them, actually. That day, the GSC
voted unanimously (save one person)
to certify the 2004-2005 GSC members
elected in an invalid election — the bal
lot was wrong.
I ran as a candidate in this year's
GSC election, and by mistake I was
placed as a candidate for the social sci
ences district representative rather than
for the natural sciences district repre

sentative. Yet I am enrolled as a natural
sciences student. The problem is that
the design of the ballot made it impossi
ble for students in natural sciences to
vote for me at as their representative.
When I voted, I realized this and e
mailed Steven Allison, the GSC chair
and the person who had been commu
nicating with the candidates about the
election. He responded, "1 thought
about it, and decided that statistics was
closer to social science ..Well, the di
visions within Humanities and Sciences
are listed on their Web site.
In essence, I was told this mistake
on the ballot wasn't a problem because
no one had intended any ill will. Addi
tionally, it was implied that the fault
was my own, since I should have let
them know about the ballot mistake
before the election. Considering the
seriousness of this issue, it was a stun
ning double non sequitur.
So, natural sciences students were
disenfranchised, and there was no indi
cation that this would be rectified. I
asked Allison and Elections Commis
sioner Ellie Martin in person not to
publicly announce the results of the two
affected races. Again, they reiterated
the two above reactions.
I learned from Allison that I could
come to the GSC meetings and present
my views. I did this. The members did

take the problem seriously, but the
overriding concern seemed to be with
the impact of the solution, not with the
problem. Because of the interwoven
nature of the races, the election for all
GSC positions would need to be rerun.
In the words of one council member,
"We would be laughed at."
Here is the crux of the issue — em
barrassment. Perhaps if the little prob
lem with the ballot gets ignored, all this
might go away. Who, after all, will no
tice that this election wasn't fair? It
hasn't been reported in The Daily, even
though a reporter was present at the
meeting. So there's little incentive to
vote fora reelection — council mem
bers certainly don't want to be embar
rassed or bring further work on them
selves. The reasons I heard in favor of
certifying were: "Rerunning the elec
tion disenfranchises students who vote
again," "We'd be laughed at" and"It
would be a lot of work."
This experience has shown me
that ordinary people can forget their
principles for expediency's sake.
Whatever happened to rational dis
course? Or principle, for that matter?
Is it something that only turns up
under a spotlight?
