## Physical play makes for a better NBA 
### 
The NBA is back. Sure, Shaq and Tim Duncan
combined to make 7-of-24 free throws yesterday,
and road teams have fewer wins than Tamar Slay
has postseason minutes, but it's not overall quali
ty of play I'm concerned with here.
No, what I'm talking about is trash-talk, bad blood, on
court donnybrooks and all the other things that used to
make playoff basketball exciting regardless of how the se
ries was going. And while Minnesota-Denver and Miami-
New Orleans hardly bring to mind the memories of the end
less IWOs slugfests featuring Chicago, New York, Miami
and Indiana, it has become clear that some teams in this
year's playoffs are serious about getting serious. And, not
surprisingly, these teams have been involved in some of the
most entertaining games.
Anytime Robert Traylor is involved in anything, it's
probably a good thing, and the Hornets realized this just in
time. After three straight DNP-CDs, Tractor came off the
bench yesterday and quickly made his presence felt, throw
ing Eddie Jones to the floor and receiving a technical foul,
at which point he barked at the Miami bench until the refs
had to throw him out.
Sure, he's "only" 6-8 and is pushing four bills, but Trac
tor has made the most of his 36 postseason minutes.
But don't think that the mojo lies entirely on the Hor
nets' side. Firstly, they are coached by Tim Floyd. Floyd

possesses less positive energy than any
coach this side of John Lucas.
Secondly, though, the Heat are the
Heat — the franchise that Pat Riley
somehow made more of a bruising, hit
and-run squad than his legendary New
York Knicks teams. Sure, Riley abdicat
ed his job this year, but that was only so
that a man named Van Ciundy could
take over. I've yet to figure out whether
it's better to be Stan or Jeff, but either
way, you can't question the Heat's cred.

Especially not when Andl streetball legend Rafer Al
ston is in the mix. In Game Five, the sharpshooter was part
of a double technical after a loose ball resulted in a shoving
match. Then, in the third quarter, he was thrown out of the
game for poking Hornets guard David Wesley in the groin.
In the words of Heat star Lamar Odom. "Both teams
were ready to do whatever they had to do to win the
game. Scratch, cuss, fight, pull, grab, whatever. But we
got it done."
Yes, they did. And they won, too.
Miami is a harder team than New Orleans, but the Hor
nets hold an X-factor in P.J. Brown, an original Eastern
Conference Warrior who has played for both the Heat and
Knicks, has publicly lamented the lack of physical play in re
cent years, talking about how he's had to tone down his
Beast of the East act. When prime-time cheap-shot articles
like Kenyon Martin eschew the "thug" label, it's nice to see
someone embrace their identity.
Which brings us, inevitably, to Latrell Sprewell. You
might have caught his nose-to-nose shouting match with
Jon Barry after Timberwolves-Nuggets Game Four, but
did you notice Spree looking at the camera out of the cor
ner of his eye during the spat? Spree is a little Hollywood
in that regard, but if and when the T-wolves play — and
get stomped by — the Spurs, we might see Latrell turn up
the heat.
The standout in the Nuggets-Wolves series, though, had
to be Francisco Elson, who said Kevin Garnett hit him in
the groin in Game Four. Among other things, Elson
claimed, in a quote for the ages, that, "That was a cheap shot
by a low type of player, a low-class type of player... No re
spect for the Nuggets at all and no respect for me on my
part. We're going to retaliate. I don't want his respect. 1
don't care about him, anyway. Who is he?"
Well, he's about to be named MVP, but you can't say
Elson didn't try to cover every possible base — from the
fact that Garnett's disrespect must be punished to Francis
co's lack of concern with KG. Elson also questioned Gar
nett's sexual orientation for "touching me in the private
parts," but that of course elicited a typically terse public
apology from Elson and a big, fat DNP-CD for Francisco in
the final game of the series.
Don't think, though, that I simply want to see people get
knocked around for 48 minutes. Part of the fun of a physi
cal playoff series is seeing if anyone can rise above it and let
their game shine. Reggie Miller, who really was too skinny
to fight anyone, is the exemplar of this trait. What this man
did to the New York Knicks year after year, despite taking
an incredible pounding game after game, is one of the most
impressive things the golden-age NBA ever witnessed.
The main reason I never complained about all the
Knicks-Heat matchups of the late 1990s or other grind-it
out tactics during the closing of the NBAs golden age was
because it raised the level of intensity. And that's why I
favor physical play. Because when you get knocked on your
ass, it wakes you up. The NBA refuses to admit it, but it pro
duces great rivalries and exciting matchups. The Knicks
never won an NBA title, and I am obligated to hate them,
but let's be honest — they made the playoffs exciting, year
after year.
Maybe true champions like the Spurs don't particularly
need additional incentive, but don't underestimate the
worth of guys like Bruce Bowen, who brings defensive in
tensity and almost nothing else to that squad. Even the
greatest team of all time, the 19%-1997 Chicago Bulls, re
lied on Dennis Rodman to throw opponents off their game.
There has been a lot of talk about how boring this
year's first round was in general — something its every
third-day schedule had a lot to do with — but, thanks to
the intensity generated by physical play, Hornets-Heat
has become the best series of the entire round, and
Wolves-Nuggets ended up being a lot more entertaining
than a top-seed vs. bottom-seed matchup usually is. I
know this year's NBA can't compare to the great squads
of the last decade, but a step in the right direction remains
a step in the right direction.
Create an atmosphere that allows you to thrive. Get in
your opponents' heads, let one of your less essential players
do some damage and then it's time for your stars to step up
and shine.

point out that in the List SO second-round series, the Game

because it raised the level of intensity. And that's why I
favor physical play. Because when you get knocked on your
ass, it wakes you up. The NBA refuses to admit it, but it pro
duces great rivalries and exciting matchups. The Knicks
never won an NBA title, and I am obligated to hate them,
but let's be honest — they made the playoffs exciting, year
after year.
Maybe true champions like the Spurs don't particularly
need additional incentive, but don't underestimate the
worth of guys like Bruce Bowen, who brings defensive in
tensity and almost nothing else to that squad. Even the
greatest team of all time, the 19%-1997 Chicago Bulls, re
lied on Dennis Rodman to throw opponents off their game.
There has been a lot of talk about how boring this
year's first round was in general — something its every
third-day schedule had a lot to do with — but, thanks to
the intensity generated by physical play, Hornets-Heat
has become the best series of the entire round, and
Wolves-Nuggets ended up being a lot more entertaining
than a top-seed vs. bottom-seed matchup usually is. I
know this year's NBA can't compare to the great squads
of the last decade, but a step in the right direction remains
a step in the right direction.
Create an atmosphere that allows you to thrive. Get in
your opponents' heads, let one of your less essential players
do some damage and then it's time for your stars to step up
and shine.

The NBA is back. Sure, Shaq and Tim Duncan
combined to make 7-of-24 free throws yesterday,
and road teams have fewer wins than Tamar Slay
has postseason minutes, but it's not overall quali
ty of play I'm concerned with here.
No, what I'm talking about is trash-talk, bad blood, on
court donnybrooks and all the other things that used to
make playoff basketball exciting regardless of how the se
ries was going. And while Minnesota-Denver and Miami-
New Orleans hardly bring to mind the memories of the end
less IWOs slugfests featuring Chicago, New York, Miami
and Indiana, it has become clear that some teams in this
year's playoffs are serious about getting serious. And, not
surprisingly, these teams have been involved in some of the
most entertaining games.
Anytime Robert Traylor is involved in anything, it's
probably a good thing, and the Hornets realized this just in
time. After three straight DNP-CDs, Tractor came off the
bench yesterday and quickly made his presence felt, throw
ing Eddie Jones to the floor and receiving a technical foul,
at which point he barked at the Miami bench until the refs
had to throw him out.
Sure, he's "only" 6-8 and is pushing four bills, but Trac
tor has made the most of his 36 postseason minutes.
But don't think that the mojo lies entirely on the Hor
nets' side. Firstly, they are coached by Tim Floyd. Floyd

possesses less positive energy than any
coach this side of John Lucas.
Secondly, though, the Heat are the
Heat — the franchise that Pat Riley
somehow made more of a bruising, hit
and-run squad than his legendary New
York Knicks teams. Sure, Riley abdicat
ed his job this year, but that was only so
that a man named Van Ciundy could
take over. I've yet to figure out whether
it's better to be Stan or Jeff, but either
way, you can't question the Heat's cred.

Especially not when Andl streetball legend Rafer Al
ston is in the mix. In Game Five, the sharpshooter was part
of a double technical after a loose ball resulted in a shoving
match. Then, in the third quarter, he was thrown out of the
game for poking Hornets guard David Wesley in the groin.
In the words of Heat star Lamar Odom. "Both teams
were ready to do whatever they had to do to win the
game. Scratch, cuss, fight, pull, grab, whatever. But we
got it done."
Yes, they did. And they won, too.
Miami is a harder team than New Orleans, but the Hor
nets hold an X-factor in P.J. Brown, an original Eastern
Conference Warrior who has played for both the Heat and
Knicks, has publicly lamented the lack of physical play in re
cent years, talking about how he's had to tone down his
Beast of the East act. When prime-time cheap-shot articles
like Kenyon Martin eschew the "thug" label, it's nice to see
someone embrace their identity.
Which brings us, inevitably, to Latrell Sprewell. You
might have caught his nose-to-nose shouting match with
Jon Barry after Timberwolves-Nuggets Game Four, but
did you notice Spree looking at the camera out of the cor
ner of his eye during the spat? Spree is a little Hollywood
in that regard, but if and when the T-wolves play — and
get stomped by — the Spurs, we might see Latrell turn up
the heat.
The standout in the Nuggets-Wolves series, though, had
to be Francisco Elson, who said Kevin Garnett hit him in
the groin in Game Four. Among other things, Elson
claimed, in a quote for the ages, that, "That was a cheap shot
by a low type of player, a low-class type of player... No re
spect for the Nuggets at all and no respect for me on my
part. We're going to retaliate. I don't want his respect. 1
don't care about him, anyway. Who is he?"
Well, he's about to be named MVP, but you can't say
Elson didn't try to cover every possible base — from the
fact that Garnett's disrespect must be punished to Francis
co's lack of concern with KG. Elson also questioned Gar
nett's sexual orientation for "touching me in the private
parts," but that of course elicited a typically terse public
apology from Elson and a big, fat DNP-CD for Francisco in
the final game of the series.
Don't think, though, that I simply want to see people get
knocked around for 48 minutes. Part of the fun of a physi
cal playoff series is seeing if anyone can rise above it and let
their game shine. Reggie Miller, who really was too skinny
to fight anyone, is the exemplar of this trait. What this man
did to the New York Knicks year after year, despite taking
an incredible pounding game after game, is one of the most
impressive things the golden-age NBA ever witnessed.
The main reason I never complained about all the
Knicks-Heat matchups of the late 1990s or other grind-it
out tactics during the closing of the NBAs golden age was
because it raised the level of intensity. And that's why I
