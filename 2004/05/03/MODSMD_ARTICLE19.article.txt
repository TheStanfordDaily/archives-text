# Softball knocks off top-ranked U of A
## Sorensen pitches a two-hitter in Cardinal victory at Tucson 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 7 Cardinal softball team (40-13,10-
5 Pacific-10 Conference) played national No. 1
University of Arizona (48-3,13-2) for the fourth
and fifth time last weekend. Including Satur
day's 4-0 loss in Tucson, the Cardinal came into
yesterday afternoon's matchup having already
lost four times to the dominant Wildcats, who
garnered all 40 first-place votes in the most re
cent National Softball Association poll and
have been ranked No. 1 every single week thus
far this season.
Talk about saving your best for last.
In Sunday's fifth and final regular season
matchup between the two teams, Stanford de
feated Arizona, 2-1, to hand the Wildcats only
their third loss of the season and their second in
Pac-lOplay.
The game was a classic pitchers' duel, as Car
dinal ace Dana Sorensen bested Arizona All-
American Alicia Hollowell to earn her 25th vic
tory in grand fashion. Despite allowing only two
runs, Hollowell allowed a stunning 13 Cardinal
hits while taking the loss, dropping her record to
33-2 on the season.
Meanwhile, Sorensen shut down the vaunt
ed Wildcat offense — four Arizona hitters are
batting over .4(X) on the season — by allowing
only two hits and a run in a complete-game vic
tory while striking out seven. "Lightning D"
held Pac-10 batting leader Autumn Champion
hitless in three at-bats and did not allow a run
until the final inning, when Wildcat second base
man Samantha Quintero hit a solo home run
with two outs to end Sorensen's shutout bid.
The Cardinal lineup was able to hit the pre
viously unhittable Hollowell (who entered the
contest with a .107 opponents' batting average)
yesterday, thanks to strong offensive perfor

mances throughout the batting order. In fact,
six Cardinal starters had multiple hits in Sun
day's game: left fielder Jackie Rinehart, short
stop Lauren Lappin, third baseman Liz
Bendig, second baseman Meghan Sickler, des
ignated player Heather Shook and catcher Jes
sica Allister. Junior first baseman Leah Nelson
had the Cardinal's only RBI on a second-inning
single up the middle that scored Lappin from
third base. Stanford scored its final run in the
fourth inning on a Wildcat fielding error that
plated Jessica Allister.
Saturday's game versus the Wildcats in
Tucson did not go nearly as well as Sunday's
performance, though, as the Cardinal was shut
out, 4-0, behind a two-hitter by Hollowell. The
Arizona ace struck out 11 Stanford batters, al
lowing only two hits and walking none en route
to her 33rd victory. Sophomore starter Laura
Severson took the loss for the Cardinal, allow
ing 11 Wildcat hits and four runs, all earned.
Coming into the weekend. Cardinal
head coach John Rittman cautioned his team
not to overlook unranked Arizona State (31-
25,1-11) despite having defeated the Sun Dev
ils twice already this season. This caveat proved
to be accurate, as the Sun Devils put a scare into
the Cardinal in a Friday night nailbiter in which
Stanford eventually came out victorious by the
slimmest of margins, 7-6.
Sorensen, who started Friday's game,
ran into trouble in the fifth inning, allowing
four Sun Devil runs before even getting an out.
She did settle down enough to get out of the in
ning with the Cardinal's lead intact and Laura
Severson came in to pitch the sixth and seventh
innings to earn her first save of the year.
Sophomore outfielder Catalina Morris went 2-
for-4 with a home run and two RBIs in the
Stanford victory.
With Friday's win over Arizona
State and Sunday's huge victory over top
ranked Arizona, the Cardinal is on the cusp
of something no Softball team has done in
Stanford history — contending fora Pac-10

Senior pitcher Dana Sorensen threw a two-hitter to lead the No. 7 Cardinal
over top-ranked Arizona yesterday in Tucson.
Conference title. The Cardinal's
10-5 conference record going
into the final two weekends of
conference play leaves it three
games behind the Wildcats for
the top record in conference
play. With the Wildcats owning
the tie breaker, an outright con
ference title is unlikely barring
an Arizona meltdown over the

last six games of the regular sea
son, but even a second- or third
place finish in the Pac-10 would
mark the best finish in Cardinal
history and would give Stanford
an excellent seeding in the
NCAA Regional Tournament.
At the beginning of the year,
the Cardinal got together and set a
collective goal of making it to the
College World Series. After win
ning again and again against elite
competition, the Cardinal is look
ing more and more like it has a le
gitimate shot at meeting or even
exceeding this goal.

Tucson did not go nearly as well as Sunday's
performance, though, as the Cardinal was shut
out, 4-0, behind a two-hitter by Hollowell. The
Arizona ace struck out 11 Stanford batters, al
lowing only two hits and walking none en route
to her 33rd victory. Sophomore starter Laura
Severson took the loss for the Cardinal, allow
ing 11 Wildcat hits and four runs, all earned.
Coming into the weekend. Cardinal
head coach John Rittman cautioned his team
not to overlook unranked Arizona State (31-
25,1-11) despite having defeated the Sun Dev
ils twice already this season. This caveat proved
to be accurate, as the Sun Devils put a scare into
the Cardinal in a Friday night nailbiter in which
Stanford eventually came out victorious by the
slimmest of margins, 7-6.
Sorensen, who started Friday's game,
ran into trouble in the fifth inning, allowing
four Sun Devil runs before even getting an out.
She did settle down enough to get out of the in
ning with the Cardinal's lead intact and Laura
Severson came in to pitch the sixth and seventh
innings to earn her first save of the year.
Sophomore outfielder Catalina Morris went 2-
for-4 with a home run and two RBIs in the
Stanford victory.
With Friday's win over Arizona
State and Sunday's huge victory over top
ranked Arizona, the Cardinal is on the cusp
of something no Softball team has done in
Stanford history — contending fora Pac-10

Senior pitcher Dana Sorensen threw a two-hitter to lead the No. 7 Cardinal
over top-ranked Arizona yesterday in Tucson.
Conference title. The Cardinal's
10-5 conference record going
into the final two weekends of
conference play leaves it three
games behind the Wildcats for
the top record in conference
play. With the Wildcats owning
the tie breaker, an outright con
ference title is unlikely barring
an Arizona meltdown over the

last six games of the regular sea
son, but even a second- or third
place finish in the Pac-10 would
mark the best finish in Cardinal
history and would give Stanford
an excellent seeding in the
NCAA Regional Tournament.
At the beginning of the year,
the Cardinal got together and set a
collective goal of making it to the
College World Series. After win
ning again and again against elite
competition, the Cardinal is look
ing more and more like it has a le
gitimate shot at meeting or even
exceeding this goal.
The No. 7 Cardinal softball team (40-13,10-
5 Pacific-10 Conference) played national No. 1
University of Arizona (48-3,13-2) for the fourth
and fifth time last weekend. Including Satur
day's 4-0 loss in Tucson, the Cardinal came into
yesterday afternoon's matchup having already
lost four times to the dominant Wildcats, who
garnered all 40 first-place votes in the most re
cent National Softball Association poll and
have been ranked No. 1 every single week thus
far this season.
Talk about saving your best for last.
In Sunday's fifth and final regular season
matchup between the two teams, Stanford de
feated Arizona, 2-1, to hand the Wildcats only
their third loss of the season and their second in
Pac-lOplay.
The game was a classic pitchers' duel, as Car
dinal ace Dana Sorensen bested Arizona All-
American Alicia Hollowell to earn her 25th vic
tory in grand fashion. Despite allowing only two
runs, Hollowell allowed a stunning 13 Cardinal
hits while taking the loss, dropping her record to
33-2 on the season.
Meanwhile, Sorensen shut down the vaunt
ed Wildcat offense — four Arizona hitters are
batting over .4(X) on the season — by allowing
only two hits and a run in a complete-game vic
tory while striking out seven. "Lightning D"
held Pac-10 batting leader Autumn Champion
hitless in three at-bats and did not allow a run
until the final inning, when Wildcat second base
man Samantha Quintero hit a solo home run
with two outs to end Sorensen's shutout bid.
The Cardinal lineup was able to hit the pre
viously unhittable Hollowell (who entered the
contest with a .107 opponents' batting average)
yesterday, thanks to strong offensive perfor

mances throughout the batting order. In fact,
six Cardinal starters had multiple hits in Sun
day's game: left fielder Jackie Rinehart, short
stop Lauren Lappin, third baseman Liz
Bendig, second baseman Meghan Sickler, des
ignated player Heather Shook and catcher Jes
sica Allister. Junior first baseman Leah Nelson
had the Cardinal's only RBI on a second-inning
single up the middle that scored Lappin from
third base. Stanford scored its final run in the
fourth inning on a Wildcat fielding error that
plated Jessica Allister.
