### ALBERT CHIOU STAFF WRITER 
El Centro Chicano celebrated its 25th anniver
sary yesterday with a mariachi concert featuring
the Grammy-nominated Mariachi Sol de Mexico,
Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles and Stanford's
own Mariachi Cardenal and Ballet Folklorico.
Hosted in Memorial Auditorium, the concert drew
a near capacity crowd, including many Stanford
alumni attending the University's first-ever alumni
of color conference.
El Centro was first established in 1978 and
serves as the center of activity for many Chicano
and Latino groups. Its programs range from speak
er presentations to study nights, and the communi
ty center also sponsors campuswide events such as
the Cesar Chavez commemoration and the Cinco
de Mayo celebration.
According to Carmen Gutierrez, one of the
center's program directors. El Centro provides a
sense of continuity for the Chicano and Latino
community at Stanford.
"It's a home away from home fora lot of us,"
Gutierrez said. "It's a flexible environment â€” a per
fect place for academics and community, as well as for
informal relationships."
Stanford's Mariachi Cardenal opened El Centro's

anniversary concert, and was later joined by El Ballet
Folklorico fora potpourri written by Mariachi Car
denal's Danny Herrera.
The two groups were followed by Mariachi Reyna
de Los Angeles, the nation's first all-female mariachi
group. The group drew laughs from the crowd as its
singers made light of love and men. At one point, a
performer went into the crowd and sang to individual
members of the audience.
Reyna was followed by the headline group Mari
achi Sol De Mexico. Sol is recognized as an innova
tive group that is willing to blend traditional mariachi
music with different genres, drawing both praise and
criticism from traditionalists. During the concert,
Sol's music ranged from extremely traditional
rancheras such as "El Rey" and "Volver" to an un
orthodox mariachi rendition of swing.
Both Reyna and Sol featured music written by
Jose Hernandez, who was referred to as "a visionary"
by the concert's master of ceremonies. Hernandez,
the director of both groups, is a prolific mariachi com
poser that has also written arrangements for other
well known musical groups such as Mariachi Los
Camperos and Mariachi Los Galleros.
The anniversary concert was sponsored by Andy
and Mary-Lou Camacho, the parents of two Stanford
graduates. All of the proceeds from the event will go
towards funding El Centro's activities.
