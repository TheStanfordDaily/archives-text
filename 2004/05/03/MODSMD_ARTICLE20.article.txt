# Mercy rule used in Card's 17-3 win over WSU
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
The only things hotter than the game-time
temperatures at Sunken Diamond this week
end were No. 2 Stanford's blistering bats. The
Cardinal (35-6, 10-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
exploded for 38 runs en route to its sixth se
ries sweep of the season, dominating visiting
Washington State (23-19,5-10).
Stanford's three wins, coupled with No. 1
Texas's two losses to Missouri, will likely put
the Cardinal back atop the latest national
rankings, which will be released later today.
The offensive onslaught in Sunday's 17-3
rout likely would've been greater if not fora
Pac-10 rule that allows the game to be called
if one team is ahead by 12 runs after seven in
nings in the final game of the series, subject to
an agreement between head coaches prior to
the game.
"It would've been nice to get some other
guys in there," said catcher Donny Lucy, who
finished the day 3-for-4 a triple shy of the
cycle, with three RBIs.
As it were, Stanford built a 14-0 lead after
four innings and increased its dominance
over the Cougars to 20 straight games in the
shortened series finale that lasted just less
than two hours.
"It was just one of those days where ev
erything we hit was hard, and even when we
didn't hit it hard, it fell," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess.
Eight of the Cardinal's 19 hits fell over the
fence, shattering the team's previous season
high of five home runs. Junior left fielder
Danny Putnam blasted a pair of round-trip
pers, the first of which gave the Cardinal a 2-
0 lead in the second inning and senior Sam
Fuld connected on his second long ball of the
year. John Mayberry Jr., back in the lineup
after sitting out Friday and Saturday, went
deep in the third.
Senior Brian Hall flew out to centerfield in
the second inning yesterday, ending a streak
of eight consecutive hits in the series. The
right fielder, who had his career-high 21-
game hit streak snapped last Saturday at
Sacramento State, walked his next time up
and added a double and a solo home run to
finish 10-for-ll in the series. Hall is hitting

.638 (30-for-47) in Pac-10 play.
"Last week I was definitely pressing, try
ing to get hits every at-bat and every game,"
Hall said. "[Having my hit streak snapped]
was definitely a blessing in disguise."
Eight Cardinal starters had multi-hit
games, including sophomore Chris Lewis,
who started at third base and homered as part
of the Cardinal's five-run fifth. The lone ex
ception was Stanford's leading hitter Jed
Lowrie, who singled in five trips to the plate.
Freshman Greg Reynolds, making the
third start of his young Stanford career,
picked up his third win after allowing just one
runner to reach base through the first four in
nings. The Cougars took advantage of three
walks in the fifth to score their only three runs
of the game.
"I felt really comfortable the first four in
nings," Reynolds said. "I was moving the ball
in and out. I guess I got a little fatigued."
Fellow freshman Blake Holler took over
in the sixth and allowed one hit and struck out
three in his two innings of work.
The 2,000-plus fans in attendance at Sat
urday's game got their nine-inning money's
worth in Stanford's 13-11 victory.
Chris Carter tied career-highs with three
hits and four RBIs while Lucy, despite having
his 15-game hitting streak ended, walked
three times and scored four runs.
After Washington State opened up a 3-0
lead against Cardinal sophomore starter Jeff
Gilmore in the first, Stanford's offense an
swered back in the bottom half of the inning
with three unearned runs.
Gilmore settled down a bit after his shaky
first inning and left with two outs in the sixth
and the Cardinal ahead 8-5 to pick up his sev
enth win of the season.
Stanford got what would turn out to be
some crucial insurance runs in the sixth in
ning when sophomore Chris Minaker de
posited the first pitch he saw from reliever
Wayne Daman Jr. over the left-field fence for
the first grand slam of his career. Lowrie hit
his conference-leading 14th home run of the
season in the seventh.
Freshman reliever Jeff Stimpson struggled
fora second consecutive outing, allowing five
