# Stanford hits record-setting eight homers
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
It could be daytime or nighttime; you could throw
a righty or a lefty; you could pitch to them or around
them. But one thing's for certain: the Stanford hitters
are going to take you downtown.
Just ask the Washington State pitching staff.
Five Cougar hurlers — three right-handed, two
left-handed — gave up a combined 12 home runs
over the course of the three-game series, including
an unprecedented eight in yesterday's seven-in
ning matchup.
People have been saying since the season's start
that this 2004 Cardinal team is special — and it looks

like the squad will get to prove it in the record books.
The in-your-face crack of the Stanford bats this
weekend boosted the team's season home-run
total to 71 — the squad has failed to homer in only
nine of its 41 games — and places the offense on
pace to break the school's single-season record for
home runs.
The 1997 Cardinal, which finished third in the na
tion at the College World Series, swung its way to 102
round-trippers in 65 games.
If the 2004 Stanford team maintains its signature
power-hitting routine, the Cardinal will chalk up 97
homers by the end of the 56-game regular season-and
will hit the 102 mark in only 59 games.
"There's been a little talk about [the home-runs

record] around the dugout," said junior catcher
Donny Lucy, who posted a two-run blast in both Fri
day's and yesterday's games. "It would be really nice
to get, even though it's not something we think about
when we're at bat."
After a disappointing 2-1 loss to Sacramento State
last weekend, it might have seemed like the Cardi
nal's offense was finally returning to mortal levels of
production.
But this weekend proved otherwise. We're not
just talking about a couple of extraordinary bats here.
We're talking about nine of them.
All nine of yesterday's starters recorded at least
one hit in the series against Wash
ington — Lucy, junior Danny Put
nam and senior Brian Hall each
had two — proving that, top to
bottom, this lineup will punish any
pitching mistake it encounters.
"You can't overlook any guy on
this team," sophomore shortstop
Chris Minaker said.
Minaker showed that to the
Cougars Saturday afternoon,
when the Washington coaches
chose to intentionally walk 3-for-3
junior Chris Carter and load the
bases with two outs in the bottom
of the sixth.
The coaching staff was appar
ently willing to take its chances
with Minaker, who to that point
had been 0-for-7 on the series.
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess said a couple of words to Mi
naker before the at-bat.
"He said 'I want you to try to hit
a line drive up the middle,"' Mi
naker said. "He usually says that so
that I stay on plane with my swing
and don't try to do too much with
the pitch."
But when the Cougars tossed a
changeup across Minaker's belt, he
teed off and sent the ball over the
left field wall for his first career
grand slam and his second homer
of the season.

Minaker is just one of the Cardi
nal players that have transformed
from tough outs to potential power
threats this season.
Sophomore Jed Lowrie, the
Pac-10 leader in homers, has 14
bombs so far this season after
hitting zero last season. Sopho
more John Mayberry Jr. hit four
home runs in his rookie cam
paign and already has 1 1 this
year. Lucy has racked up 10 this
season after hitting only two in
all of 2003.
You get the idea.
"So many of the guys that didn't
play that much last year have
stepped up nicely," Lucy said.
"Some of us were on-and-off last
year, but knowing that you're
starting every day helps."
Lucy also cited the work of the
team's strength coach, Nate Peo
ples, as a reason for the team's abil
ity to charge after the 1997 team's
place in the record books.
"We're all a lot stronger and it
shows out there on the field,"
Lucy said.
While the team may not see an
other eight-homer explosion in
the near future — even the 1997
Cardinal had a single-game high
of only seven jacks — Stanford
shows no sign of slowing on the
way to 102.
"Our approach the whole time
is to put the pressure on all game,
score as many runs as we can each
inning and not sit on a lead," Put
nam said. "Because you never
know what's going to happen."
