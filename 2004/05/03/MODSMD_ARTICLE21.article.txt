# Stanford hits record-setting eight homers
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
It could be daytime or nighttime; you could throw
a righty or a lefty; you could pitch to them or around
them. But one thing's for certain: the Stanford hitters
are going to take you downtown.
Just ask the Washington State pitching staff.
Five Cougar hurlers — three right-handed, two
left-handed — gave up a combined 12 home runs
over the course of the three-game series, including
an unprecedented eight in yesterday's seven-in
ning matchup.
People have been saying since the season's start
that this 2004 Cardinal team is special — and it looks

like the squad will get to prove it in the record books.
The in-your-face crack of the Stanford bats this
weekend boosted the team's season home-run
total to 71 — the squad has failed to homer in only
nine of its 41 games — and places the offense on
pace to break the school's single-season record for
home runs.
The 1997 Cardinal, which finished third in the na
tion at the College World Series, swung its way to 102
round-trippers in 65 games.
If the 2004 Stanford team maintains its signature
power-hitting routine, the Cardinal will chalk up 97
homers by the end of the 56-game regular season-and
will hit the 102 mark in only 59 games.
"There's been a little talk about [the home-runs

record] around the dugout," said junior catcher
Donny Lucy, who posted a two-run blast in both Fri
day's and yesterday's games. "It would be really nice
to get, even though it's not something we think about
when we're at bat."
After a disappointing 2-1 loss to Sacramento State
last weekend, it might have seemed like the Cardi
nal's offense was finally returning to mortal levels of
production.
But this weekend proved otherwise. We're not
just talking about a couple of extraordinary bats here.
We're talking about nine of them.
All nine of yesterday's starters recorded at least
