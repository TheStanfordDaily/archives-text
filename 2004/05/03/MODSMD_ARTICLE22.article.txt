# Stanford's Craig sets collegiate-record in 10,000 meters

### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was nothing less than a magical weekend for
track and field as world bests and collegiate records
fell on Friday night at the Cardinal Invitational and
two of the nation's top track programs collided at the
110 th Big Meet.
And in the middle of this magic, redshirt Alicia
Craig responded with a collegiate record in the 10,000
meters. Her time of 32 minutes, 19.97 seconds was three
seconds better than the old record held by Villanova's
Carol Zajac.
It was only the third 10,000 race ever by the reigning
NCAA 10,000-meter champion, who appears to have
found her specialty distance very quickly.
"It felt comfortable, like a workout," Craig said. "I
was hoping the packs wouldn't spread out like they did.
I was just running by myself a lot."
Craig will now move on to the Olympic Trials in
July, where the Cardinal hopes that the field will run
under the Olympic A standard of 31:45, allowing
Craig a chance to grab a ticket to the Olympic Games
in Athens.
"Workouts are going really well," Craig said.
"I'll probably run the 10,000 at NCAA Champi
onships and the Olympic Trials, and we'll see if I
can get the standard."
Craig's performance came after another phenome
nal performance earlier in the day by senior Jillian Ca
marena. Camarena took a huge step toward qualifying
for the Olympics by throwing a personal-best by nearly
two feet in the shot put. Her mark of 59 feet, 6.75 inch
es makes her the collegiate leader and tied with Kristin
Heaston, the reigning U.S. outdoor champion, for the
top U.S. mark this season.
Camarena is now just over a foot shy of the Olympic
A standard.

"Making the team had always been a possibility,"
Camarena said. "But now, it is even closer. I mean,
being right there with Kristin is really exciting. She is
such a good thrower."
In his outdoor debut, redshirt junior lan Dobson ran a
personal best 28:15.66 in the 10,000, which qualifies him
for both the NCAA Championships and the Olympic Tri
als. Dobson, an All-American at the 10,000, will attempt
to run under the Olympic A standard at the Trials in July
to qualify for the U.S. team.
But the story of the 10,000 was Colorado's Dathan
Ritzenhein running an American collegiate record of
27:38.50. Ritzenhein is a favorite for the Olympic team
this year.

Nike's Meb Keflezighi, an Olympic qualifier in the
marathon, won the event in the second-fastest time in
the world this year, 27:24.10. In total, nine athletes, in
cluding five Americans, ran under the difficult 27:49
Olympic A standard.
Redshirt junior Don Sage finished fourth to three Stan
ford alums in the fast heat of the 1,500. His time of 3:40.31
is the fastest in the NCAA this year.
Cardinal alum Jason Lunn ran 3:38.96 for the win,
while senior Grant Robison posted a solid 3:41.43
for eighth.
In the C section of the 1,500, sophomore Jacob Gomez

ran a personal-best 3:43.37 for ninth, while redshirt junior
Chris Emme also had a personal best on the night with his
13:53.19 in the 5.000.
As if the excitement of the Cardinal Invitational were
not enough, Stanford and California met at Edwards Sta
dium the very next day, with both teams bringing a fa
vored squad: the Stanford women and the Cal men.
And, as expected, the Stanford women and the Cal
men took home the titles, 108-55 and 96-66, respectively.
Despite the team outcome, there were still fantastic per
formances and the competitive dramas that always ac
company the rivalry.

Unexpected, though, was that both teams would
clinch their titles on second-place finishes in the
200 meters that would put them above the 82
points needed to win the meet.
Stanford sophomore Nashonme Johnson in fin
ishing second in the 200 to Cal's Antonette Carter
boosted the Cardinal women's score from 81 to 84
points, while Cal senior Ahmad Wright's second
place showing to Stanford junior Nick Sebes gave
the Bears 84 points as well.
"The middle-distance and distance squads did
a great job for us, especially considering the in
vitational last night," said head men's coach
Robert Weir. "But this is what happens when
we don't have the sprinters, jumpers and throw
ers as well.
"The football players did a great job for
us," Weir continued. "We won the 100, 200
and 400 with football players, but we didn't
have the depth. We didn't have the time to
prepare them."
Junior Stanley Wilson was one of the surprises
of the meet, appearing in a Stanford track uni
form for the first time since last year's Big Meet
and taking the 100 in a wind-aided 10.49 seconds.
The mark is a Regional qualifying time.
In the men's steeplechase, Cal's Kevin Davis
scored a narrow victory over first-time Steepler
sophomore David Vidal, 9:06.72 to 9:06.92, to get
the crowed fired up.
The next race, the women's 1,500 saw freshman
Ari Lambie and junior Sara Bei break down Cal's
Bridget Duffy over the final 400 meters to take first
and second in what was a very slow and tactical
race, silencing the crowd.
Cal freshman Darrel Brown who defeated Sebes
in the 400 back on April 10th, had the favor re
turned as Sebes posted a season-best 46.74 to beat
the field by nearly a second.
Junior Undine Becker returned from injury

to post a long jump of 20 feet, 4.5 inches, while senior
Jay Goff threw a personal-best 217-10 in the javelin.
In the 5,000, sophomore Anita Siraki and freshman
Amanda Trotter both posted Regional qualifying marks
of 16:52.52 and 16:51.71, respectively.
To cap off the meet, the Stanford women posted a
decisive victory over a struggling Cal relay, 3:40.94
to 3:44.74.
The Cardinal now enter a two-week period of solid
training in preparation for the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships, where the men will seek the title they lost
last year and the women will seek their first crown.
