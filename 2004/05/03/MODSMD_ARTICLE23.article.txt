# Report releases average pay for faculty, effect on tuition

According to the 2(X)3-2CK)4 edition of "The Annual
Report on the Economic Status of the Profession," Stan
ford is doing an exceptional job at maintaining or increas
ing faculty salaries, although this may he under threat in
the midst of a national slump.
The report, issued by the American Association of Uni
versity Professors (AAUP), showcases the increase and
decrease of salaries at institutions around the nation.
Titled "Don't Blame Faculty for High Tuition," the re
port states that both private and public institutions blame
the annual increase in tuition on rising salaries for faculty
members. While the AAUP acknowledged that faculty
salaries do impact hikes in tuition, the group argued that
they are not the sole cause. From 1990-1941 to 2002-2003,
average tuition and fees at four-year private colleges and
universities such as Stanford increased by 5.9 percent. Dur
ing that same time period, average faculty salaries in
creased by only 3.S percent.
The AAUP attributed the 2.1 percent rise not linked to
faculty pay to the rise in the national unemployment rate
from 5.8 percent in June 2002 to 6.4 percent in June 2003.
This jump in unemployment prompted an increase in the
number of students applying for need-based financial aid.
Endowment spending in the 2003-2(X)4 year was reduced
due to the stock market decline. In March of last year,
when facing the deficits for the upcoming year, Stanford
froze faculty and staff salaries at their 2002-2003 levels.
"Stanford was unusual last year in virtually freezing
salaries," said Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, the special as
sistant to the provost for faculty recruitment and retention.
" This was part of an adjustment to the national situation
and the need for budget reduction within the University."
According to the report, there was an increase of 2.2
percent in faculty salaries at public doctoral institutions,
with positions including professor, associate professor, as
sistant professor and instructor. The average salary of a
faculty member at a doctoral institution this past academ
ic year was $71,901. Private doctoral institutions such as
Stanford boasted a 3.5 percent increase over last year's
salaries with an average salary of $91,915.
Faculty across the nation reported an increase in salary
of only 2.1 percent over the previous year, the lowest in

crease in more than three decades. When cost of living is
factored in, the raise drops to a mere 0.2 percent increase.
"As the report notes, the average increase in faculty
salaries around the nation last year was the lowest in quite
a while," Weisberg said. "The major reason was the gener
al decline in the economy. The major factor was the bad
performance of the stock market, since many universities,
especially private ones, dominantly depend on returns
from their equity investments in their endowment."
Stanford ranks fourth behind Harvard, Rockefeller
and Princeton for the highest-paid full professor positions
in the nation, with an average salary of $142,300. Howev
er, Stanford's average salary for full professor positions is
higher than the top-ranked public institution — UC-
Berkeley, which has an average annual salary of $123,000
— as well as the top- ranked liberal arts college and the
top-ranked community college.
The report highlights a 3.8 percent gap in pay between
male and female faculty members. In each position, male
faculty members are reported to have higher salaries than
their female counterparts.
Another trend highlighted by the report was the need
for non-tenure track faculty positions at both public and
private institutions. Since 1989, a growing number of full
time and part-time faculty members are off the tenure
track. From 1989 to 2001, the number of faculty members
not on the tenure track increased from 19.1 percent to 28.1
percent in public institutions and from 23.5 percent to 30.9
percent in private institutions.
For full professors in law, computer science and engi
neering — which the report cites as the best-paying disci
plines— increases in overall salary over the past two
decades resulted in a steady, albeit slow, increase of around
$20,000 overall. Some new assistant professors hired in
those same three fields reported dramatic losses over the
past 10 years, including $ 10,000 for engineering professors.
Other assistant-professor salaries have jumped dramati
cally; business faculty, for example, have seen their salaries
increase by $40,000.
"The expectation was always that we would return to
reasonable salary increases soon thereafter," Weisman
said. "And that's where we are. The salary-setting process
for 2004-2005 is now underway. The freeze has been lifted,
and the average increase is likely to be in the range it was
in the five or so years before the freeze."
