## 
### MATT SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Scholars from around the globe will be gathering at
Stanford's Tresidder Union today and throughout the
week to celebrate one of Russia's most notable poets
and authors. Boris Pasternak. The international confer
ence, titled "Hostage of Eternity," will present panel
discussions and speakers addressing different aspect of
Pasternak's life and work.
"Boris Pasternak is one of the greatest, perhaps the
greatest Russian poet of the 20th century," said con
ference organizer Lazar Fleishman, a professor of
Slavic languages.
Through Friday, events will be held commemorating
Pasternak, who best known for his epic novel "Dr.
Zhivago." In 1958. Pasternak became the first writer in
the Soviet Union to receive the Nobel Prize in litera
ture, primarily for his poetry, which deals with themes
of destiny in a rapidly changing society. This is also a
prominent theme in "Dr. Zhivago," in which Pasternak
follows a man through the turmoil of love and the Russ
ian Revolution.
Communist officials initially forced Pasternak tode
cline the Nobel Prize as punishment for his negative
portrayal of life under the Soviet system. For the same
reason, "Dr. Zhivago" was not printed in the Soviet
Union until 1987, when the Union of Soviet Writers re
instated Pasternak following his death. The author's
son finally accepted the prize for his father in 1989 at a
ceremony in Stockholm.
Among the scholars visiting throughout the week
will be Pasternak's son, Evgeny Pasternak, Russia's
foremost poet Andrey Voznesensky, UCLA scholar
Vyacheslav Ivanov, San Francisco artist and writer

Olga Carlisle, University of Venice Prof. Vittorio
Strada and Sorbonne Prof. Michel Aucouturier. At
tendees will participate in an evening of recollections
and discussion about Pasternak led by Bliss
Carnochan. The event will take place on Tuesday at
4:30 p.m. at Tresidder.
Conference speakers will include Kevin Piatt
from the University of Pennsylvania, Irina Sheve
lenko from Petersburg and graduate students Ilja
Gruen and Alex Fishkin, who have taken part in the
Pasternak graduate seminar at Stanford, which is led
by Fleishman.
Pasternak has been the subject of Fleishman's stud
ies for more than 40 years. Over the course of his career,
Fleishman has spent time with Pasternak's family, ex
amining its archive in Moscow and working on books
about the poet and author.
In addition to the conference, Fleishman has been
involved in constructing the Pasternak display in
Hoover's Exhibit Pavilion. The collection is made up
of the private archive of Josephine Pasternak, the
poet's sister and of the private collection of benefactor
Irwin Holtzman.
"The Hoover Institution has amassed a terrific col
lection of the poet's manuscripts and rare editions, the
largest outside Russia," Fleishman said. "And there
fore became a very important center of the Pasternak
scholarship, indispensable for international scholars
and the United States specialists alike."
Panels will be held throughout the week in both
English and Russian. Three generations of scholars will
be in attendance, including graduate students from the
University of Hungary and the University of Sweden.
The Pasternak exhibit in Hoover will open to the gen
eral public on May 6.
