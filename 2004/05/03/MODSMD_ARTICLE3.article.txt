# Borgelt-Mose, Vargas Caro stress arts and diversity
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITORS 
Envisioning her role as ASSU president,
Chioke Borgelt-Mose said she wants students to
come up and tell her, "My food is terrible in
Flo Mo"and ask what she can do to make that
change. She hopes that by increasing ASSU visibil
ity around campus and connecting personally with
students, she'll have similar chance encounters
leading to grassroots ideas.
Borgelt-Mose and Kory Vargas Caro, both
sophomores, said the key to their platform is out
reach. They want a jump in arts visibility, more focus
on diversity and they would like more interaction
with student-group leaders.
Borgelt-Mose just became involved with
the ASSU this year, sitting on the Nomina
tions Commission.
"Before, [the ASSU] was kind of this thing that I
knew it was there but 1 didn't quite know what it did,"
she said. "We want to make outreach for the ASSU a
priority, so that freshmen right away when they come
in know what the ASSU does."
Both candidates have some experience with
outreach through the community centers and the
Career Development Center. Borgelt-Mose
works at the Black Community Service Center, fo
cusing on programming. Vargas Caro is a multi
cultural affairs coordinator at the CDC and is ac
tive in El Centro Chicano.
Their work at the community centers and
with other students has led the candidates to
focus not just on reaching out, but also on con
necting communities.
"Diversity can only be achieved when communi-

ties start collaborating with one anoth
er," they said in an e-mail addressing
their platform.
"There's a lot of overlap on this
campus and that comes from commu
nities not working together, being
timid or shy about going to communi
ties that don't exactly look like them
or aren't in the same kind of genre,"
Borgelt-Mose said. "A lot of times
that can work."
Borgelt-Mose, an African and
African-American studies major,
explained that being biraciai is an
important part of her life. Vargas
Caro, a cultural and social anthro
pology major, is from Maryland but
lived in Bolivia — his father's home
country — for six years, has worked
on multicultural affairs and is co
president of the Class of '06's Lati
no Council.
But the two candidates don't want
to be limited to working within certain
communities or just for certain
groups, they said.
"We consider everyone a special
group," Vargas Caro said.
"Whether or not people realize it,
they fall into a certain niche, and within

that certain niche they have special is
sues," Borgelt-Mose explained.
Their campaign, titled "Let's Get
Real," aims to inform students about a
different issue each day, six issues
total. On Saturday, they distributed
fliers describing how they will address
sexual awareness and arts visibility,
and later in the week they plan on
tackling cost of living. Absolute Fun
and student space.
Sophomore Nneka Chike-Obi,
who is working on their campaign —
and in The Daily's advertising de
partment— explained that she sup
ports the two of them because they
will make good leaders. She said that
Vargas Caro had stood up at the large
MEChA meeting after the group's
special-fees rejection and presented a
number of comprehensive ideas for
how to regain funding.
"I was impressed with his leadership
ability," she said.
Chike-Obi also explained that
Borgelt-Mose would make a good
leader because she's accessible.
"She doesn't take herself too seri
ously," Chike-Obi said. "She's not os
tentatious. She really knows what
she's doing."
One thing that sets their platform
apart is its focus on Absolute Fun.
Borgelt-Mose and Vargas Caro ex
plained that they would make Absolute
Fun a voluntary student organization

and take the burden for running it out of
the ASSU's hands. This would fix the
"small inefficiencies of the program this
past year," they said.
As with the other candidates,
Borgelt-Mose and Vargas Caro
plan on spending much of their time
addressing special-fees issues. They
want to increase funding for cam
pus arts initiatives and LGBT inter
est groups. They also want to ex
plore ways to coordinate between
groups, reducing the cost of renting
spaces for events and searching for
alternative funding for ethnic
groups after the loss of MEChA's
special fees.
Borgelt-Mose and Vargas Caro said
they are being careful only to suggest as
many changes and events as they can
feasibly accomplish.
"Our close partnership with the cur
rent administration allows us to im
prove their programming without suf
fering from their pitfalls," they said in an
e-mail to The Daily.
They also said that while they
wanted votes based on their plat
form, people should place more
emphasis on their personal leader
ship ability.
"We both come into this campaign
not as politicians, but as students who
are running because we truly care about
Stanford," Borgelt-Mose said. "We
keep it real."
