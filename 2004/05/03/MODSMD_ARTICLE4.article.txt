# Gaobot virus continues to infect thousands of campus computers
## 
### JOHN SHEN 
The notorious Gaobot computer virus contin
ues to spread across campus. It has infected almost
a thousand computers and is responsible for slow
ing down Stanford network connections last week
— some students were unable to access the net
work at all.
The truth is that Stanford easily susceptible to
the spread of computer viruses, according to ju
nior Jim Rodgers, a resident computer consul
tant (RCC).
"Big network, personal computers and limited
University control leads to vulnerable machines,"
Rodgers said.
In fact, most of the other networks infected by
this same virus are either large school campuses or
business networks.
When one computer has the virus it tries to hack
into other systems within the same network.
Spreading at incredible speeds, the virus can try out
thousands of passwords for user accounts in a com
puter in any given minute. This slows down the gen

eral speed of the Internet for network users and in
terferes with access to off-campus sites, which
means everyone loses the fast Internet speed.
Because the virus doesn't cause any other ob
servable complications, the infected computers
continue to function and all user data is retained.
This is one reason why it is so difficult to detect in
fected systems.
After infection, the Gaobot finds a way to com
municate with "Botmasters," which are probably
owned by the author of the virus. These Botmasters
instruct the virus how to act. Access to two of these
systems have already been detected and blocked off
by University networks.
All RCCs receive updated lists of IP addresses
that could potentially be infected. Users with in
fected computers can either reformat everything
and use the system safely on the network again or
hope that an update patch from Windows or Syman
tec Virus Definitions is released for the Gaobot
virus and its 50 major derivatives in the near future.

When freshman Matt Janes
learned that his computer was in
fected, he had an I-Hum paper
due, forcing him to continue work
ing with the infected machine.
"Well, other than the fact that
I can't use the Internet in my
room, I haven't checked my e
mail in three days and this paper
is due very, very soon, I'm al
right," he said.
For an undetermined reason,
the virus has been particularly dis
ruptive for students living on the
west side of campus.
When Rodgers was asked how
he felt about the whole scenario,
he laughed and replied. "It's a
bit stressing."

gests that the best way to prevent
getting infected by the virus is to
change easy user account pass
words — passwords should incor
porate numbers and non-English
words. Students should also make
sure they have all the online Win
dows updates if they use PCs.
Alternatively, virus writers
often don't think to attack Mac
operating systems. Without re
