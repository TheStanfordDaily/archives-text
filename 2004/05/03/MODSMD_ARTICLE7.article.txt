## Students lobby for Martha 
### HOLLY WELLS ARIZONA DAILY WILDCAT 
(U-WIRE) TUCSON, Ariz. — Christine
Alexander was never much of a Martha Stewart fan.
But she decided to use her own entrepreneur
ial skills to rally support for Stewart after the con
troversial homemaker was convicted for obstruc
tion of justice.
Alexander, a 38-year-old theatre arts senior, has
created a "Free Martha Stewart" T-shirt to convey
how unfairly she feels one of the most successful fe
male entrepreneurs has been treated.
"I remember seeing Winona Ryder wearing a
'Free Winona' T-shirt on the cover of Rolling Stone
magazine and thought it was a fun way of making a
statement," she said.
Stewart was convicted March 5 lor obstruction
of justice after reportedly lying to investigators
about why she sold ImClone stock the day before
the stock crashed. Stewart was not charged with
insider trading, which she was originally investi
gated for.
"1 respected her as a business woman and
admired the empire she built," she said. "When
the conviction came, I was disgusted. They've
wasted so much time and money, and I don't
understand why there's so much hatred to
wards her."
If it had been anyone other than Stewart, the pub
lic wouldn't have gone after her. Alexander said.
Alexander said she felt a connection with Stew

art because she's been in the business world and
knows it's tough.
"Its OK fora man to be aggressive, but women
have to tiptoe around," she said.
According to The Associated Press, Stewart
is expected to be sentenced to less than a year
in prison.
Alexander said instead of going to jail, Stewart
should have to do community service.
"What a waste of taxpayers' money to put her in
jail," she said. "She should have to do workshops
with small business owners telling them how to
make an idea profitable."
Alexander said she started out with 48 shirts and
that her supply has nearly run out.
Alexander said she can fill the shirt orders. Shirts
are also available at Silver Sea, 137 E. Congress St.,
for $17.95 plus tax.
Elizabeth Mead, owner of Silver Sea, said the
shirts have been popular.
"People will first laugh. Then they'll want a shirt
to show their support," she said, "There's only been
one negative response."
Mead said Alexander has reprinted the shirt
three times with different designs, and customers
often come in with suggestions for new "Free
Martha Stewart" T-shirts.
Alexander said when she wears the shirt, she gets
a lot of laughs and positive reactions.
Alexander said she has a few black and white
shirts left and won't print up any more shirts unless
Stewart appears in the news again.
