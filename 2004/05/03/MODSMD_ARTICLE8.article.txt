(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J. — A resident of
the Stanworth apartment complex, which houses
some faculty, was arrested Saturday following an in
vestigation by Princeton University Borough Police
into alleged credit card fraud.
Randy Baadhio, 38, was charged with credit card
fraud, forgery, identity theft and theft by deception.
The investigation began when A1 Limousine,
which was conducting business with Baadhio and
suspected him of fraudulent credit card use, alerted
University Public Safety of their suspicions.
Baadhio acquired at least seven credit cards
under different identities and may have used them to
obtain between $2,00() and $4,000, Borough Police
Lt. Dennis McManimon said.
According to the Borough Police's press release,
the apartment complex in which Baadhio was living
is subsidized by the University and reserved for fac
ulty and staff.
University media relations manager Patty Allen
confirmed that Baadhio had falsified information on
his application for faculty housing and had been pay
ing rent for an apartment on Stanworth Lane.
The University Housing Department declined to
discuss its application review procedure, citing secu
rity concerns.
Public Safety investigator Charles Peters worked

with the Mercer County prosecutor to ensure that
the charges of defrauding the University had been
filed, McManimon said.
Baadhio was brought up on similar charges in
Massachusetts and California. According to an
August 2002 San Francisco Chronicle article, he
had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison
for impersonating Harvard University and Uni
versity of Colorado employees in order to open
credit card accounts.
But Baadhio is a legitimate academic who fo
cuses on such issues as "global gravitational
anomalies" and "quantum topology," the Chron
icle reported.
"As far as we can tell, he does have a Ph.D. in
quantum physics, but this pays more," McManimon
said, referring to Baadhio's recent activities.
The Secret Service and the State Department
have opened subsequent investigations into addi
tional charges of fraud and identity theft.
The State Department is currently looking into
how Baadhio acquired a valid U.S. passport under an
assumed identity.
The Secret Service field office in Trenton de
clined to comment about its investigation when con
tacted Thursday.
The residence which Baadhio rented was de
scribed by Allen as "a furnished transitional apart
ment, normally reserved for faculty and staff who
will later move to a permanent residence."
