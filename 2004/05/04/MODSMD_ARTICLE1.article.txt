# Chappie slate runs again, deems itself 'doctors of democracy'
## 
### ANTHONY HA MANAGING EDITOR 
After being eliminated in the first round of
voting in April's ASSU executive election,
The Stanford Chaparral's ticket of senior
Charlie Stockman and junior Matthew Henick
now faces four new slates, including candi
dates from the two slates that beat them in the
last election. But are Stockman and Henick
worried? Nope — at least not about convert
ing the supporters of senior Mikey Lee and
sophomore Alyssa Schwartz.
"Actually, changing the minds of Lee and
Schwartz supporters might not be necessary,"
Stockman said. "We are simply planning to se
cure their second-place votes with our good

natured jest.
"Then, with any luck, Mikey will be unable to
control his urges to commit campaign infractions
and he will in turn get them disqualified," Stockman
continued. "Our second-place votes will become
first-place votes, and we'll be strolling to the resume
bank with a brand new office in our pockets."
Students are generally uncertain about how
seriously to take the Chappie's annual bid for the
presidency, which in the past has included stunts
like a "Donut Jesus" in White Plaza and regular
heckling of the other candidates. But Stockman
and Henick told The Daily that their campaign
was absolutely serious.
"Death and serious illness will lurk around
every corner," they said. "We also plan on cont
aminating the water supply with a mix of a dead

ly disease and heavy water . . . only supplying the
anecdote when we win. That's pretty serious."
The recent scandal over campaign misconduct
has given the slate a second shot at executive of
fice. Stockman compared the current special elec
tion to using antibiotics without a prescription.
"In many ways, our opposing slates resemble
the opportunistic diseases that feed on an al
ready sickly person," Stockman said.
He went on to note the resemblance between
Mark Berghausen and Ethan Cantil-Voorhees'
motto, "SANS — Students for the ASSU Not
Sucking" to "the 'Students for the ASSU Really
Sucking' slate, SARS, that rocked this campus and
much of Eastern Asia last year." Stockman also


Matthew Henuk (left) and Charlie Sto<kman
claimed that the slate of Intermission
editors Barrett Sheridan and Tarn
Vo should be correctly titled, "the
BSTD slate — Barrett's STDs."
Stockman asked, "What else
would one expect from Intermis
sion's Roxy Sass, whose horrific
sexual exploits have cost him not
only the ability to write, but also
his venereal well-being?"
However, Stockman warned,
neither of these slates are as dan
gerous as the Lee-Schwartz slate.
"This retrovirus will be difficult
for the ASSU to combat, since it has
combined the two deadliest ele
ments of the last election," Stock
man said.
He added that instead of hold
ing a special election, the ASSU
should have called on Henick and
himself — self-described "Doctors
for Democracy" — for aid.
When asked why students should
support a Stockman-Henick execu
tive ticket, Chappie editor Steve Yel
derman, a senior, cited Stockman's
experience in ASSU elections.
"At this point. Stockman and
Henick have the perfect balance
between ASSU-insidership and
fresh outsider perspective,"
Yelderman said. "After all the
campaigns they've been through

— this is Stockman's third —
they have gotten a pretty good
idea of how the ASSU operates.
All that experience, and not
once tainted by the arrogance of
victory."
Stockman wasn't focused solely
on bashing his opponents, though.
For example, he offered a "modest
proposal" for dealing with the
ASSU's special-fees dilemma, as
students ask for refunds on the
money that campus groups use to
fund their programs.
"As we know there are several
special-fee groups such as Axe
Comm that did not receive special
fees and can no longer subsist,"
Stockman said. "How often do we
see the leaders of such groups in
White Plaza, donning rags, with
five or six of their constituents
trailing behind them, caked in even
greater filth? . . . They pose a terri
ble burden on this institution,
which is already falling into a de
plorable state with the recent elec
tion catastrophes."
But Stockman said he had
a solution.
"I have heard from a friend at
Harvard University that such a
group, which has grown soft over
the years from excessive funding,
can make fora most delicious and
wholesome meal," he said. "Per
sonally. I cannot wait for the Solar
Car Project, which has become
plump and juicy in its slothfulness,
to lose funding"
