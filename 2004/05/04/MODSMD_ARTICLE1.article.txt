# Chappie slate runs again, deems itself 'doctors of democracy'

### ANTHONY HA MANAGING EDITOR 
After being eliminated in the first round of
voting in April's ASSU executive election,
The Stanford Chaparral's ticket of senior
Charlie Stockman and junior Matthew Henick
now faces four new slates, including candi
dates from the two slates that beat them in the
last election. But are Stockman and Henick
worried? Nope — at least not about convert
ing the supporters of senior Mikey Lee and
sophomore Alyssa Schwartz.
"Actually, changing the minds of Lee and
Schwartz supporters might not be necessary,"
Stockman said. "We are simply planning to se
cure their second-place votes with our good

natured jest.
"Then, with any luck, Mikey will be unable to
control his urges to commit campaign infractions
and he will in turn get them disqualified," Stockman
continued. "Our second-place votes will become
first-place votes, and we'll be strolling to the resume
bank with a brand new office in our pockets."
Students are generally uncertain about how
seriously to take the Chappie's annual bid for the
presidency, which in the past has included stunts
like a "Donut Jesus" in White Plaza and regular
heckling of the other candidates. But Stockman
and Henick told The Daily that their campaign
was absolutely serious.
"Death and serious illness will lurk around
every corner," they said. "We also plan on cont
aminating the water supply with a mix of a dead

ly disease and heavy water . . . only supplying the
anecdote when we win. That's pretty serious."
The recent scandal over campaign misconduct
has given the slate a second shot at executive of
fice. Stockman compared the current special elec
tion to using antibiotics without a prescription.
"In many ways, our opposing slates resemble
the opportunistic diseases that feed on an al
ready sickly person," Stockman said.
He went on to note the resemblance between
Mark Berghausen and Ethan Cantil-Voorhees'
motto, "SANS — Students for the ASSU Not
Sucking" to "the 'Students for the ASSU Really
Sucking' slate, SARS, that rocked this campus and
much of Eastern Asia last year." Stockman also
