# Hurray to the Google IPO?
## 
### JOSEPH MAYER GUEST COLUMNIST 
Last Thursday's announcement by Google's founders that they
will be taking their innovative Websearch company public was a
highly anticipated event at Stanford, across Silicon Valley and
throughout America, but I would bet that my personal joy at the
IPO news surpasses a large majority of you happy Websearchers out
there. No .., it's not because my first name is Sergey. It's not Larry
either, and the closest I've come to landing a Google job, or even
one of their good-as-gold stock options, was while I slept through
the first week of CSIO6A as a freshman — currently, even to land an
HR job at the Googleplex, it seems that one must have at least a doc
torate in electrical engineering, computer science or have donated
garage-time to the Google boys during the early years.
All joking aside, I wish those guys the best-of-luck in taking their
company public, but personally, I'm most thrilled that Page and Brin fi
nally gave into IPOing so I don't have to read, hear, or think about their
"unique," "quirky," "founded in a garage" goldmine of a company any
more, except when I'm using it. Over the past few weeks, every friend,
family member and friend-of-a-friend that I've ever met has e-mailed
me a Google-IPO article, probably because they've read that Brin and
Page were Stanford dropouts and figure that I might have been in the
right place, at the right time, to grab a piece of the Google-pie.
My experience is not unique and let me be the first to announce;
Google-lization is a global phenomenon. Fora 24-hour time-frame
from pre-IPO, to IPO-announcement and then a few hours post-
IPO announcement, there were approximately 2,400 articles found
on Google News for the search term "Google IPO" and more than
500,000 hits for the same search term during a basic Google Web
search immediately following the announcement. In short, the
media's marathon coverage leading up to yesterday's IPO filing has
been astonishing in its volume and practically messianic in its
rhetoric. I think everyone, myself included, is getting a pretty accu
rate preview of what an over-Googled world might look like after
the company actually IPOs in a few months.
I've been day-dreaming about a world flooded by Google fora
few days now, ever since I found myself browsing a Web site called
Google Fan (http://www.googlefan.com) and came across quotes
like, "Millions of surfers love Google — it is one of those rare Web
sites that folk get emotional about. The quality of my life has im
proved immensely since the arrival of the Google search engine,
and it is worthy of much praise."
Love? Emotion? Life improving? This sounds like it's straight
out of a Richard Simmons video, and while I believe that Google
the company was groundbreaking in its use of technology and psy
chology too refine websearch, most of the emotion I see expressed
over Google comes from banks like CSFB, Morgan Stanley, VCs
on Sand Hill Road, and a few investors who are about to win the
IPO lottery. Bill Gates gets pretty emotional over Google too.
Frankly, even Brin and Page don't seem in tune with the mania sur
rounding their IPO, probably because they are exceptionally smart
managers when it comes to the websearch sector.
Brin and Page believe in their product of course, and they have
nurtured it into what may be the ideal blend fora technology and
high-tech marketing company, but as they prepare to go public,
Brin and Page should make every possible attempt to keep the
Google brand from the media-fed trap known as overexposure. In
other words, don't let Google-lization get out of hand. But in light
of the last few weeks of non-stop Google coverage, including
dozens of front-page snapshots featuring Brin & Page as if they
were the next Starsky & Hutch, I fear that they are already teeter
ing too close to the edge of overexposure to turn back. Remember,
Google hasn't actually IPOed yet, but when it does in a few months
in an online Dutch auction that will award shares to the highest bid
ders, its logo will be everywhere: in those Cheescake Factory menu
inserts; on a special-edition Nike basketball shoe; and even as a
sponsor of a Google: Girls Gone Wild video.
At the end of the day, the media-driven overexposure encom
passing the Google IPO will elevate the stock-price into a new
galaxy, making Brin, Page, early institutional investors and found
ing-class option holders a few extra billion, but it could also alien
ate Google's largest customer base — me, you and everybody else
who uses Google Websearch on a daily basis — and ultimately it
will devalue the Google brand-name through the basic principle of
"too much of a good thing." These conclusions, however, are spec
ulative, and there is only one certainty about the outcome of media
driven Google-lization — the madness and market value generat
ed by the overexposure leading up to, during and immediately after
Google's long-awaited IPO will make Microsoft more bloodthirsty
and more aggressive as they enter the search engine sector, where
Google just became the official king of the hill.

My experience is not unique and let me be the first to announce;
Google-lization is a global phenomenon. Fora 24-hour time-frame
from pre-IPO, to IPO-announcement and then a few hours post-
IPO announcement, there were approximately 2,400 articles found
on Google News for the search term "Google IPO" and more than
500,000 hits for the same search term during a basic Google Web
search immediately following the announcement. In short, the
media's marathon coverage leading up to yesterday's IPO filing has
been astonishing in its volume and practically messianic in its
rhetoric. I think everyone, myself included, is getting a pretty accu
rate preview of what an over-Googled world might look like after
the company actually IPOs in a few months.
I've been day-dreaming about a world flooded by Google fora
few days now, ever since I found myself browsing a Web site called
Google Fan (http://www.googlefan.com) and came across quotes
like, "Millions of surfers love Google — it is one of those rare Web
sites that folk get emotional about. The quality of my life has im
proved immensely since the arrival of the Google search engine,
and it is worthy of much praise."
Love? Emotion? Life improving? This sounds like it's straight
out of a Richard Simmons video, and while I believe that Google
the company was groundbreaking in its use of technology and psy
chology too refine websearch, most of the emotion I see expressed
over Google comes from banks like CSFB, Morgan Stanley, VCs
on Sand Hill Road, and a few investors who are about to win the
IPO lottery. Bill Gates gets pretty emotional over Google too.
Frankly, even Brin and Page don't seem in tune with the mania sur
rounding their IPO, probably because they are exceptionally smart
managers when it comes to the websearch sector.
Brin and Page believe in their product of course, and they have
nurtured it into what may be the ideal blend fora technology and
high-tech marketing company, but as they prepare to go public,
Brin and Page should make every possible attempt to keep the
Google brand from the media-fed trap known as overexposure. In
other words, don't let Google-lization get out of hand. But in light
of the last few weeks of non-stop Google coverage, including
dozens of front-page snapshots featuring Brin & Page as if they
were the next Starsky & Hutch, I fear that they are already teeter
ing too close to the edge of overexposure to turn back. Remember,
Google hasn't actually IPOed yet, but when it does in a few months
in an online Dutch auction that will award shares to the highest bid
ders, its logo will be everywhere: in those Cheescake Factory menu
inserts; on a special-edition Nike basketball shoe; and even as a
sponsor of a Google: Girls Gone Wild video.
At the end of the day, the media-driven overexposure encom
passing the Google IPO will elevate the stock-price into a new
galaxy, making Brin, Page, early institutional investors and found
ing-class option holders a few extra billion, but it could also alien
ate Google's largest customer base — me, you and everybody else
who uses Google Websearch on a daily basis — and ultimately it
will devalue the Google brand-name through the basic principle of
"too much of a good thing." These conclusions, however, are spec
ulative, and there is only one certainty about the outcome of media
driven Google-lization — the madness and market value generat
ed by the overexposure leading up to, during and immediately after
Google's long-awaited IPO will make Microsoft more bloodthirsty
and more aggressive as they enter the search engine sector, where
Google just became the official king of the hill.

Last Thursday's announcement by Google's founders that they
will be taking their innovative Websearch company public was a
highly anticipated event at Stanford, across Silicon Valley and
throughout America, but I would bet that my personal joy at the
IPO news surpasses a large majority of you happy Websearchers out
there. No .., it's not because my first name is Sergey. It's not Larry
either, and the closest I've come to landing a Google job, or even
one of their good-as-gold stock options, was while I slept through
the first week of CSIO6A as a freshman — currently, even to land an
HR job at the Googleplex, it seems that one must have at least a doc
torate in electrical engineering, computer science or have donated
garage-time to the Google boys during the early years.
All joking aside, I wish those guys the best-of-luck in taking their
company public, but personally, I'm most thrilled that Page and Brin fi
nally gave into IPOing so I don't have to read, hear, or think about their
"unique," "quirky," "founded in a garage" goldmine of a company any
more, except when I'm using it. Over the past few weeks, every friend,
family member and friend-of-a-friend that I've ever met has e-mailed
me a Google-IPO article, probably because they've read that Brin and
Page were Stanford dropouts and figure that I might have been in the
right place, at the right time, to grab a piece of the Google-pie.
