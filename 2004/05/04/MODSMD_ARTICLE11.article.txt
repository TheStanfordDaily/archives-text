# Countering bioterrorism
## Stanford professor influential in shaping national policy 
### JAZIB ZAHIR 
The heightened fear within the
United States of the ability of
"rogue" states and terrorists to en
gage in chemical warfare has re
sulted in a concrete effort to be pre
pared to defend the country in the
case of such an attack.
There is nothing new to the idea
of technology being used as a ma
lignant tool.
"All of science is dual use. Ev
erything that has the potential for
help also has a harmful side to it.
Wheels are used in both carts and
cannons, after all," said Steve
Block, professor of Applied
Physics. "Gene therapy will help us
cure Parkinson's disease, but it also
has the potential to let us insert bad
genes into people."
Block is a scientist actively in
volved in developing national poli
cy to counter bioterrorism. He
serves on a number of government
committees, such as the Biotech
Futures Committee, which is con
cerned with the possible threat of
biological warfare. The purpose of
such committees is to help pass leg
islation in Congress that will allow
the United States to be best pre
pared in case such a bioterrist
emergency should arise.
There are two existing models
of security: obscurity and trans
parency. Obscurity requires con

cealing sensitive results from tech
nological discovery in the hope
that they may never fall into the
wrong hands. Transparency re
quires releasing all relevant infor
mation into the public domain in
the hope that the ready availability
of information will facilitate the
speedy development of counter-

Regulations tie the hands of the good guys and
prevent them from developing useful applications."

measures to attack.
"We need to follow the model of
transparency," said Block. "Obscu
rity doesn't work since there is al
ready enough information on the
technology relevant to bioterror
ism out in the open. We just can't
put the genie back into the bottle."
Congress is responsible for de
ciding which biological agents can
be used in laboratory research and
which are outlawed. The decision
to outlaw some agents comes from
the belief that such agents pose
threats as biological weapons and
that research cannot be conducted

that may allow us to better harness
their potential.
"Legislation isn't helping the
cause of research," said Block.
"Regulations tie the hands of the
good guys and prevent them from
developing useful applications. But
the bad guys aren't constrained by
legislation and so they still have ac
cess to all the materials they need
for their purposes."
Current legislation has also
been suggested to be ineffective
since it focuses on outlawing chem
icals like anthrax within the United
States, which are still easily avail
able outside the country. Legisla
tion also fails to prioritize the out
lawing of drugs adequately. For ex
ample, the danger of the non-con
tagious diseases stemming from
anthrax are emphasized at the ex
pense of chemicals that could
cause disease to spread much more
rapidly among populations.
Legislative control over re
search directions is not well re
ceived by the scientific community.
A growing number of scientists
complain that the $6 billion ear
marked by Congress for fighting
bioterrorism is excessive, is being
doled out with little oversight and
is detracting from efforts to combat
problems that are much more
deadly — for example, AIDS and
malaria are already killing millions

of people.
The current strategy of devel
oping some specific national labo
ratories for the purpose of re
searching anti-toxins has met with
some opposition. In Boston, ac
tivists are trying to halt construc
tion of a $168 million lab at Boston
University. They fear something
akin to what health inspectors sus
pect occurred recently in China:
that SARS escaped from a Beijing
laboratory and made its way into
the Chinese heartland.
There is also concern that
while Congress has allotted

funding to appropriate research,
it has not provide firm guidance
in this regard.
"We do need these labs," said
Ken Alibek, a former top scientist
in the Soviet biological weapons
program who defected to the Unit
ed States in 1992. "But I've never
seen any well-defined plan of what
exactly we need, how many labs are
necessary and what they should be
designed to do."
A treaty limiting the production
of chemical weapons was signed as
early as 1972 with all the concerned
nations — including the United
States, Soviet Union and North
Korea — participating in the
agreement. But it proved to have
little enforcing power, with signa
tories still capable of carrying out
clandestine research with little fear
of reprisal.
"We need to see a more effec
tive treaty in place and I see the
United States taking a leadership
role in this regard," said Block.
"But a treaty alone is insuffi
cient," he added. "Treaties are only
between nations and don't limit
terrorists from taking action. Our
belief that secrecy is the best way to
limit the threat is guided by
decades of fear of nuclear warfare.
The best way to limit that threat
was to just not let the information
get into the wrong hands. But that
didn't really work since other coun
tries like India and Pakistan man
aged to join the nuclear arms race."
Alibek continued, "What we
need is legislation that gives our
scientists a free hand to do re
search that bears relevance to
bioterrorism. Having all the infor
mation out there along with a con
certed effort to nimbly develop
antidotes will not only keep us safe
but will also buttress our health
care system."
Some researchers are looking
for solutions in the design of exotic
sensors and biomimetic robots
trained to detect deadly chemicals.
"But in the short run, that
doesn't really help," Block said.
"We need to start by focusing on
the low hanging fruit. Terrorists
can only use relatively mundane
techniques, like anthrax in an enve
lope. At the moment, we can only
face things as complicated as multi
drug resistant anthrax. It is coun
tering such threats that we need to
focus our efforts on."

measures to attack.
"We need to follow the model of
transparency," said Block. "Obscu
rity doesn't work since there is al
ready enough information on the
technology relevant to bioterror
ism out in the open. We just can't
put the genie back into the bottle."
Congress is responsible for de
ciding which biological agents can
be used in laboratory research and
which are outlawed. The decision
to outlaw some agents comes from
the belief that such agents pose
threats as biological weapons and
that research cannot be conducted

that may allow us to better harness
their potential.
"Legislation isn't helping the
cause of research," said Block.
"Regulations tie the hands of the
good guys and prevent them from
developing useful applications. But
the bad guys aren't constrained by
legislation and so they still have ac
cess to all the materials they need
for their purposes."
Current legislation has also
been suggested to be ineffective
since it focuses on outlawing chem
icals like anthrax within the United
States, which are still easily avail
able outside the country. Legisla
tion also fails to prioritize the out
lawing of drugs adequately. For ex
ample, the danger of the non-con
tagious diseases stemming from
anthrax are emphasized at the ex
pense of chemicals that could
cause disease to spread much more
rapidly among populations.
Legislative control over re
search directions is not well re
ceived by the scientific community.
A growing number of scientists
complain that the $6 billion ear
marked by Congress for fighting
bioterrorism is excessive, is being
doled out with little oversight and
is detracting from efforts to combat
problems that are much more
deadly — for example, AIDS and
malaria are already killing millions

of people.
The current strategy of devel
oping some specific national labo
ratories for the purpose of re
searching anti-toxins has met with
some opposition. In Boston, ac
tivists are trying to halt construc
tion of a $168 million lab at Boston
University. They fear something
akin to what health inspectors sus
pect occurred recently in China:
that SARS escaped from a Beijing
laboratory and made its way into
the Chinese heartland.
There is also concern that
while Congress has allotted

funding to appropriate research,
it has not provide firm guidance
in this regard.
"We do need these labs," said
Ken Alibek, a former top scientist
in the Soviet biological weapons
program who defected to the Unit
ed States in 1992. "But I've never
seen any well-defined plan of what
exactly we need, how many labs are
necessary and what they should be
designed to do."
A treaty limiting the production
of chemical weapons was signed as
early as 1972 with all the concerned
nations — including the United
States, Soviet Union and North
Korea — participating in the
agreement. But it proved to have
little enforcing power, with signa
tories still capable of carrying out
clandestine research with little fear
of reprisal.
"We need to see a more effec
tive treaty in place and I see the
United States taking a leadership
role in this regard," said Block.
"But a treaty alone is insuffi
cient," he added. "Treaties are only
between nations and don't limit
terrorists from taking action. Our
belief that secrecy is the best way to
limit the threat is guided by
decades of fear of nuclear warfare.
The best way to limit that threat
was to just not let the information
get into the wrong hands. But that
didn't really work since other coun
tries like India and Pakistan man
aged to join the nuclear arms race."
Alibek continued, "What we
need is legislation that gives our
scientists a free hand to do re
search that bears relevance to
bioterrorism. Having all the infor
mation out there along with a con
certed effort to nimbly develop
antidotes will not only keep us safe
but will also buttress our health
care system."
Some researchers are looking
for solutions in the design of exotic
sensors and biomimetic robots
trained to detect deadly chemicals.
"But in the short run, that
doesn't really help," Block said.
"We need to start by focusing on
the low hanging fruit. Terrorists
can only use relatively mundane
techniques, like anthrax in an enve
lope. At the moment, we can only
face things as complicated as multi
drug resistant anthrax. It is coun
tering such threats that we need to
focus our efforts on."

The heightened fear within the
United States of the ability of
"rogue" states and terrorists to en
gage in chemical warfare has re
sulted in a concrete effort to be pre
pared to defend the country in the
case of such an attack.
There is nothing new to the idea
of technology being used as a ma
lignant tool.
"All of science is dual use. Ev
erything that has the potential for
help also has a harmful side to it.
Wheels are used in both carts and
cannons, after all," said Steve
Block, professor of Applied
Physics. "Gene therapy will help us
cure Parkinson's disease, but it also
has the potential to let us insert bad
genes into people."
Block is a scientist actively in
volved in developing national poli

serves on a number of government
committees, such as the Biotech
Futures Committee, which is con

biological warfare. The purpose of
such committees is to help pass leg

the United States to be best pre

emergency should arise.
