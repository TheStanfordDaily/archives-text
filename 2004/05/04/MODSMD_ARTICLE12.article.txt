# GRAVITY PROBE B: A test of more than just relativity
## 
### SU FEN LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It has been almost a week since Gravity
Probe B, or GP-B, was launched. Until the
first real scientific data is obtained more than
a month from now, however, GP-B would
not have had the chance to test Einstein's
theory of relativity. It has, however, tested
the patience and persistence of the many
people who have worked on this project.
For one, it took 45 years of work for GP-
B to be successfully launched. There are es
sentially two reasons for the delay, according
to Karl Stahl, a graduate student in Mechan
ical Engineering, who has been working on
GP-B since last summer.
When the project was first conceived,
"the technology necessary to make such
an ultra-precise experiment possible sim
ply did not exist," Stahl said. "Over the
years, technology gradually developed to
meet the daunting demands for the preci
sion required."
One of the most important advances was
the invention of superconducting quantum
interference devices, or SQUIDs, which
could measure the exquisitely small changes
in the direction of the gyroscopes' spin axis
predicted by Einstein's theory.

Other necessary advances included the
ability to manufacture extremely spherical
gyroscopes, the means of locating the satel
lite accurately (i.e. GPS), and methods for
isolating the experiment from myriad minis
cule, but potentially devastating, environ
mental disturbances.
"Which is the reason they put the experi
ment in a satellite in the first place, instead of
just doing it on Earth," Stahl said.
"The other reason is quite simply fund
ing. It has been a tremendous effort to keep
the project moving through all of NASA's
whims over the years," Stahl added.
According to Stahl, Francis Everitt, the
principal investigator, has managed to resus
citate the project after repeated cancella
tions. He has also repeatedly succeeded in
convincing the government pocketbook
holders that the many untried technologies
used on the satellite are in fact feasible and
that the experiment is vitally important.
When Stahl started working on GP-B last
summer, he took part in an effort to analyze
data from a thermal vacuum test.
"That's where the folks at Lockheed Mar
tin put the satellite in a big vacuum chamber
and checked to see if heated up excessively,"
Stahl said. "Everything was A-OK, but it
took $10 million and many months of effort
to find that out."

Stahl heard about the position through
word of mouth. The quarter before, he took
a class called "Precision Engineering" in the
Mechanical Engineering Department. This
class was taught by Dr. Dan Debra, who was
involved in the GP-B experiment.
For the class, Stahl worked in conjunction
with several other students to build a proto
type of a microradian tilting mirror stage
that is being used as part of a small-scale ex

periment related to the GP-B project.
"Afterwards, as the summer rolled
around, and I was still frantically looking
for something cool to do, 1 asked around to
see if there might be any jobs available on
GP-B, and what do you know, there were,"
Stahlsaid
Currently, Stahl works on the data pro
cessing aspects of GP-B.
"All of the actual hardware of the satellite
was built long before I arrived on the scene,
so now it's just a matter of collecting and in
terpreting the data that gets sent down."
Stahlsaid.
Even though GP-B has finally been
launched, there is still plenty for Stahl to do.
"Actually, now is when the real fun starts
— because up till now all the data we were
working with came from a simulator (a fancy
bunch of electronics sitting in a room at
Lockheed Martin in Sunnyvale)," he said.
In fact, Stahl has been offered a full-time
job at GP-B which he plans on taking, and
will be working on GP-B for at least anoth
er year.
"Now that the satellite is in omit, the data
are real, which makes the job much more ex
citing. Right now they are in the process of
calibrating the satellite's thrusters, adjusting
the direction in which it points, making fine
adjustments to its orbit and ensuring that the

gyroscopes are behaving as planned — a
process which will take a total of 40 days.
Not until all this is completed will we get any
real scientific data."
The satellite receives an almost continu
ous feed of data through the Tracking and
Data Relay Satellite System. In addition,
there is a digital data recorder on the satellite
that stores information over several hours. It
then beams the data down to various ground
stations around the world as it is passing over
them. The data include information from a
selection of the thousands of sensors and
monitors mounted throughout the satellite
and include data on the gyroscopes, temper
atures, currents, voltages, pressures, atti
tude, etc.
The experiment is expected to last ap
proximately a year and a half — or until
the liquid helium runs out. Liquid helium
maintains extremely cold (superconduct
ing) temperatures around the experiment.
To maximize the effect of Earth's gravita
tional field, the satellite is in a rather low
orbit. This means that after only a few
years, atmospheric drag will pull the satel
lite out of orbit.
"This is an experiment in pure science,"
Stahl said. "If it succeeds, it will take us one
step closer to understanding the inner work
ings of our universe.
