## In ASSU executive election, Chioke / Kory the best choice 
### 
As the ASSU executive special election
approaches, many students are con
fused. Old candidates are running
again — some on the same slates, oth
ers in freshly formed pairs — and entirely new
slates have thrown their hats into the race as
well. Moreover, with five pairs in competition
for next year's executive positions, it has be
come all the more difficult for students to dis
cern the differences between the slates and to
decide which to support.
This space's prior executive election endorse
ment on April 7 suggested that Lee / Schwartz
would have made a stronger candidate slate than
either Lee / Mefford or Husbands / Schwartz. Out
of the candidates available at the time, this ap
peared to be the most desirable alternative. But
since then, two notable developments have affect
ed the race. First, campaign violations caused the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate to not certify the
original results. More important, however, has
been the entry of new candidate pairs.
As stated in our previous editorial, students
should still choose "action over advocacy." Lee
and Schwartz borrowed from the Lee / Mefford
campaign by adopting many of the specific pro
posals that were developed in the latter's plat
form. We appreciate this specificity. However,
adequate planning does not alone bring about ef
fective action; strong leadership and networking
abilities to carry plans through are also required.
While Chioke Borgelt-Mose and Kory Vargas
Caro currently lack the detailed vision that Lee
and Schwartz offer, they are two promising candi
dates who seem to work well together and with
others. Students should vote for Borgelt-Mose /
Vargas Caro in this week's special election be
cause their leadership skills show the greatest po
tential for uniting diverse interests to carry out
their plan of action.
It is apparent that Borgelt-Mose and Vargas
Caro have the energy and dedication that serv
ing as ASSU executives would require. They
have each held significant leadership roles in
student groups and have formed strong on-cam
pus connections that would serve the ASSU
well. They are effective at communicating and
collaborating with other students. The impres
sive amount of support they have built around
their campaign in the short time since becoming
candidates is one such testament to their savvy.
By contrast, Lee and Schwartz have an impres
sive leadership record but have had less direct
and consistent involvement with student groups.
Additionally, their decision to join forces after
the original election is a move that feels more
political than ideological.
By no means do Borgelt-Mose and Vargas
Caro make up the perfect slate. Their platform,
which includes issues like University outreach,
lowering students' cost of living, arts visibility
and promoting leadership, lacks the kind of ex
haustive specificity that we have seen from Lee /
Schwartz. But while Lee and Schwartz have been
working on their campaign for months, Borgelt-
Mose and Vargas Caro were not a part of the orig
inal election cycle and therefore have had far less
time to prepare. Given the circumstances of the
original election and the fact that they had
planned to run next year anyway, Borgelt-Mose
and Vargas Caro's decision to enter the special
election makes sense.
Despite its flaws, the platform set forth by
Borgelt-Mose / Vargas Caro is a respectable
starting point. It contains realistic and workable
proposals like an ASSU equipment rental pro
gram for student groups and a shadowing pro
gram to put freshmen in contact with campus

leaders. We have faith that, if elected, Borgelt-
Mose / Vargas Caro could take a cue from Lee /
Schwartz and fashion their set of proposals into
a detailed and specific plan of action by meeting
with more administrators, ASSU officials and
various student communities. Borgelt-Mose /
Vargas Caro's record of experience and their ex
cellent working dynamic provide two good rea
sons to be optimistic about their potential.
Although Lee and Schwartz could certainly
do a competent job as ASSU executives, their part
nership has significant weaknesses. Chiefly, their
platform seems to be a forced hybrid of the Lee I
Mefford and Husbands / Schwartz campaigns that
lacks the focus and clarity of the original slates.
Aside from the vague idea of "unity", it is difficult
to tell what Lee and Schwartz truly stand for.
Additionally, both Lee and Schwartz arguably
chose the wrong running mates for the original
election. We still wish that the two had run to
gether in the first place — but in the second
place, it isn't the same. Their poor judgment in se
lecting running partners is a troubling indicator
of their ability to make critical decisions as ASSU
executives. And we wonder how members from
two different slates that were vocally criticizing
one another just a few weeks ago could suddenly
turn around and say that together they are best
for the job. This reversal calls into question their
arguments against one another from the original
election, which in turn lessens the credibility of
their present criticisms of other campaigns. On
the other hand, a refreshing characteristic of
the Borgelt-Mose / Vargas Caro slate is that it
does not appear to be a politically engineered
combination of candidates, but a partnership of
individuals who have a history of working with
each other.
Finally, as mentioned before, there is Lee's
troubling involvement in campaign violations —
violations that brought about the new election.
Although Lee said he did not know there was
anything illegal about the endorsements from the
Junior and Senior Class presidents that were e
mailed to class lists, at the very least he should
have read the Campaign Practice Code more
thoroughly and asked the elections commission
ers if he was unclear on any of the CPC's specific
rules. This oversight in and of itself warrants seri
ous reconsideration of any slate of which Lee is a
part. However, credit must be given to Lee /
Schwartz for running a clean special-election
campaign and for providing ideas that should be
explored regardless of who wins the race.
The Chaparral slate of Charlie Stockman and
Matthew Henick also deserves credit for being
the only slate from the regulation election to run
again in its original form and to not violate any
CPC rules in either campaign, but we still have
the same concern over their lack of a serious
platform. This also goes for the Intermission
slate of Barrett Sheridan and Tam Vo. Of the
two other new slates, SANS and Borgelt-Mose /
Vargas Caro, only the latter has enough fresh,
clearly articulated ideas to pose a legitimate
challenge to the Lee / Schwartz slate that arose
from the dissolution of Lee / Mefford and Hus
bands / Schwartz.
Borgelt-Mose / Vargas Caro is a strong
choice not only for those seeking a fresh alter
native to candidates from the regular election,
but also for those who would like to see things
get done by the ASSU. They have campus con
nections, a strong working bond and a knack for
coming up with realistic ideas. That said, we
hope that, if elected, they will take time to give
more breadth and definition to their platform
before setting to work.
