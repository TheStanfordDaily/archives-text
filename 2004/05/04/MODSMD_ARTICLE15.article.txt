## One child, one dollar 
### CAMMIE LEE 
One child dies of measles every
minute in Africa. By the time you
have finished reading this article,
four more will have perished from
an easily preventable disease. As
the United States focuses its atten
tion on the war on terrorism, it
seems to have neglected the rela
tively more day-to-day causes of
death in the world today.
United Nations Secretary Gener
al Kofi Annan said in a January
speech, "In the daily lives of most
people in the world today, terrorism
and weapons of mass destruction
are remote and hypothetical threats.
The fears that stalk most people are
those of poverty, starvation, unem
ployment and deadly disease."
Measles is the leading cause of
death among unvaccinated children
in Africa. A highly contagious air
borne disease, it can cause brain
damage, blindness, pneumonia,
throat infections and diarrhea. In
fact, measles is the leading cause of
blindness in Africa.
In the United States and much
of the developed world, measles
immunizations are standard re
quirements for all children. The
vaccine's efficacy is demonstrated
by the fact that there have been no

reported cases of measles in the
United States. In stark contrast,
measles kills 1,200 African chil
dren every day, and 450,000 every
year — considerably higher figures
than those for AIDS, malnutrition
or tuberculosis.
The Measles Initiative Partner
ship was established in 2001 to ad
dress this growing epidemic, with
the aim of saving 1.2 million lives by
the end of 2005. The ultimate goal:
no deaths from measles in 2006.
Together, the American Red
Cross, the United Nations Founda
tion, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), the World
Health Organization (WHO) and
the United Nations Children's
Fund, (UNICEF) have launched
mass vaccination campaigns in
Africa. Since its inception, the
Measles Initiative has reached 14
African countries, and has vacci
nated over 90 million children in
two years.
Despite such impressive
progress, there are currently still
about 100 million children in Africa
at risk of contracting measles.
Every one of their lives can be
saved by a vaccination that costs
less than a dollar. Vaccinations are
the most cost-effective public
health intervention.

Average cost of vaccinating a
child during a measles campaign in
Africa, according to igures from the
Measles Initiative and UNICEF.:
Measles Vaccine — $0.15
Syringe — $0.10
Operational Cost — $0.40
Social Mobilization — $0.15
TOTAL — $0.80
Just think: If every American
gave a one-time donation of $2, all
these children's lives would be
saved. To learn more about this
life-saving campaign and to con
tribute, come to White Plaza this
Wednesday and Thursday between
11 a.m. and 4 p.m. In addition, to
hear a first-person perspective,
come listen to Sandy Tesch's per
sonal experiences, as part of the
Red Cross team in The Gambia. In
just 10 days, her team vaccinated
over 740,000 Gambian children
against measles.
One child, one dollar — for less
than the cost of a bottle of Coke, we
can do our part and vaccinate a child
for life.
