Stanford's astrobiology program
should involve itself witn NASA
It is nice to see that planetary sci
ence at Stanford is finally taking off
in the new astrobiology studies pro
gram ("New field of astrobiology
taking off," April 30). In my ten
years of research in planetary sci
ence, I had the pleasure of working
with Stanford researchers on plane
tology topics in the late 1980s and
early 19905. Under the direction of
people such as Prof. Don Lowe of
the Department of Geological and
Environmental Sciences, the Stan
ford program should quickly be
come one of the best in the field of
astrobiology.
The Stanford astrobiology pro
gram must be concerned and active
with NASA's funding policy. Un
manned missions to Mars and Eu
ropa need to be emphasized as im
portant programs in NASA's agen
da. The proposed manned space
flight program to the Moon and
Mars by President Bush promises
to end NASA's Planetary Explo
ration Program.

Open letter to an anti-Zionist
protester
The Stanford Daily's strong
front-page Israeli Independence
Day article ("Israeli independence
celebrated," April 27) included a
picture of four protesters. Their
posters say that Zionism is racism
and that a Jewish state doesn't de
serve to exist. One proclaims, "I am
deeply ashamed! I am a Jew."
I have a very dear old friend in Is
rael who would certainly say she's
deeply ashamed of what some Jews
have done there in the name of the
state (though I doubt she'd string
such a poster around her neck). But
this woman has lived and worked in
the state of Israel during half a cen
tury. She helped found the Israeli
women's movement, led a progres
sive Orthodox girls' school and
raised children who served in the Is
rael Defense Forces.
My friend's hard-earned right to
say she's ashamed and angered isn't
simply a matter of Jews inside versus
Jews outside of Israel. The differ
ence here, as I see it, involves gen
uine knowledge of the historical
case and thoroughgoing personal
experience. In short: understanding,
commitment, integrity.
To call Zionism racism and to
deny a Jewish state, as happens here
and abroad, joins historical oblivi
ousness to blithe hypocrisy. This is
what's truly shameful.

Daily columnist apologizes for
remarks interpreted as racist
After reading Antony Liu's let
ter to the editor ("Daily's colum
nists lack respect for international

faculty, TAs," May 2), I realized
that my column on class lectures
("Education's future is in reruns,"
April 23) was insensitive to lecturers
and teaching assistants for whom
English is not their first language. I
don't agree that acknowledging that
non-native speakers are sometimes
difficult to understand is a product
of racism or discrimination, but I do
see how my comments are discour
aging to people who are trying their
best to communicate. In reality, I do
try my best to understand what peo
ple are saying. The offensive com
ments were merely an attempt at
humor that I have no business trying
to defend. I apologize.

Graduate students who struggle
with English should not teoch
I am writing in response to
Antony Yiu's recent letter ("Daily's
columnists lack respect for interna
tional faculty, TAs," May 3) which
criticizes two Daily columnists for
their supposedly racist and "dis
criminatory" comments regarding
the sub-par English skills (and re
sulting ineffective teaching) of some
non-native English speaking TAs
and faculty members.
In sarcastically and unfairly de
riding the two Daily columnists as
lazy, racist and intolerant of non-
American accents, Yiu misses the
point that TAs and faculty members
who can scarcely be understood
(very different from simply speak
ing with foreign accents) have no
business teaching undergraduates in
the first place. Though the majority
of my own experience with graduate
student TAs has been overwhelm
ingly positive, I have been in discus
sion sections with TAs clearly inca
pable of teaching effectively in En
glish. The result is a frustrating
waste of time.
My problem is not with the inter
national student TAs themselves,
who I am sure are invariably hard
working and well meaning, but
rather with the English for Foreign
Students (EFS) staff who certify un
qualified graduate students for
teaching positions. Yiu's dismissal
of such concerns as "racist" and un
appreciative of diversity is a dishon
est tactic that overlooks the real
issue of identifying certain areas of
Stanford's undergraduate educa
tion that ought to be improved.
Surely it is not unreasonable for
Stanford students to expect instruc
tion from teachers who are compe
tent English speakers.

Anti-Semitism to become illegal
For the third time over the last
year or so, I have faced battery from
a supporter of Israel. At a Stanford
demonstration protesting Israeli In
dependence Day last Monday, a
young man told me that he was
going to beat me up, started shoving

me and butted me lightly on the
head with his head. I backed away
and yelled about 10 times for the po
lice to help. My assailant ran off, and
no police intervened.
A few minutes later, as I resumed
my location with a sign signaling Is
rael's connection to the war in Iraq
war), a Stanford employee asked me
to move over to the other side of the
area reserved for the protest. I re
sisted a bit, and another man then
revealed his undercover Stanford
police identity and also asked me to
move. I asked him if he saw the as
sault / battery event. He replied,
"Yes ... uh, no." I asked if he heard
me yelling for police assistance, and
he said he had heard it.
His companion, the Stanford
staff person, told me later in a phone
call that both of them had witnessed
the event and had seen that my as
sailant "was in your face." The cop,
Detective Bryan Michael, appeared
amused by the event. He did noth
ing but later intervened to get me
moved to another location. Police
impartiality at its best.
I have filed a police complaint
with Stanford's Department of Pub
lic Safety. If I had assaulted or
shoved a Jew at this demonstration,
with this Stanford cop witnessing
the event, where do you think I
would be at this moment? At this
moment, Ernst Zundel, a Holocaust
revisionist, bides his time in solitary
confinement in a Canadian prison,
for unfree speech. All over Western
Europe, you go to jail for Holocaust
denial or other writings which might
incite racial hatred, etc.
Such a loss of liberties is around
the corner. Sen. Hillary Clinton is
trying to craft legislation that will
punish anti-Semitism. Criticize a
Jew or Israel, go to jail. And Jewish
writers who demonize Arabs â€”
send them to jail? No, let them retire
to South Florida.
JOE WEBB
Student calls for "best
of ads" section
I was sadly disappointed with Fri
day's commencement preview edi
tion of The Daily. The editorial
staff, in its selection of the year's
highlights, ignored the backbone of
the paper: the advertisements. As
the structural center of the news,
these small or large squares of joy
give me the emotional drive to make
it through the day. When 1 feel lone
ly or depressed, the smiling faces of
the upcoming ASSU speakers help
me to know that I am something
special; the sperm donor advertise
ments give me hope for the future;
and, as I carefully cut out every
coupon for my wallet, 1 realize that
there are companies that care. I
hope that you will remedy this situa
tion and give paid advertisements
the full appreciation they deserve,
perhaps with a "best of" edition
dedicated exclusively to these boxes
of inspiration, of happiness, of glory.
