## Spencer loves the way Aaron Carter holds it down 
### 
UA nd it goes, And it goes. And it
goes a little something like
/ % this!" So begins one of the
JL JL greatest songs of my genera
tion. A staple musical interlude between
Sponge Bob and the Fairly Odd Parents on
Nickelodeon, this song really captured all the
beauty of basketball, from its schoolyard
roots to its present NBA incarnation. Featur
ing Shaquille O'Neal in one of the finest act
ing performances of all time, a young musi
cian was able to accomplish the one feat that
separates Yao Ming from superstardom.
With rhymes like "I put it in the hoop like
slam / , I heard the crowd screaming out
•Jam,' " Aaron Carter tells us, "That's how I
beat Shaq."
"Aaron's in the house / Yo guys, check it
out / Guess what happened to me

"(Another crazy story,
Come on A.C.) / I was hang
ing at the court / Just playing
some ball / Working on my
game / (Yeah, we heard it
all) / 1 heard the fans scream
ing / 1 thought it was for me /
But then I saw a shadow / It
was 12-foot-3 / It was
Shaquille O'Neal / (What?
What did he say?) / (How
bout some one-on-one. Do

you wanna play?) / I told him why not /1 got
some time / But when I beat you real bad /
Try not to cry."
Ok, so maybe this isn't the greatest song of
all time. Maybe I just wasted 99 cents on the
iTunes music store download. Maybe I'm
ashamed that anyone on South Campus can
now see that my playlist includes a song off
the album "Aaron's Party (Come Get It)"
(get "what" exactly, is never specified on the
album, but I doubt Aaron's "it" is synony
mous with 50 Cent's).
But more importantly, this is just one of a
whole slew of songs that either feature or star
prominent sports figures.
You may have heard of "The Super Bowl
Shuffle," but do you remember the Fridge deliv
ering the immortal line, "You're lookin' at the
Fridge. I'm the rookie /1 may be large, but I'm
no dumb cookie."
Do you know that Shaquille O'Neal appar
ently thought he had enough hits to merit a
"Best of" album? Do you know that Friday
columnist Julie Ruvolo is actually quite
charming in person?
These are all good questions, all good
knowledge for the true sports fan, and all in
dire need of me to comment on them.
But I'm not here to judge, nor rank, nor
criticize the life choices of sports stars. I'm
here to mock. And so without further ado, let
the mocking begin.
Let me just finish up with my man Aaron
Carter. This kid, as you may know, is market
ing his career on the line "Younger Brother of
Backstreet Boy Nick Carter", which never re
ally gave him a whole lot of cred to begin with,
and is now losing appeal by the minute. How
ever, with "That's how I beat Shaq", he really
reaches a new low.
Owing to a horrendous non-call on a bla
tant double-dribble, Aaron should not take
his victory to heart, and in my opinion, should
spend as much time on his jumpshot as he
does on looking like a tool. Nice highlights.
They're so hot right now. Like Paris Hilton,
soon to be his sister-in-law, so hot.
Second, Bernie Williams. As you may
know, the Yankees center fielder released
an album last year of his own acoustic guitar
stylings, with such canciones as "La Salsa En
Mi," "Samba Novo" and "Stranded On the
Bridge." Notoriously absent is "Mi Jefe es el
Diablo," "Gary Sheffield Tiene Muchas
Problemas Personales" y "Pedro Martinez
will be a Yankee next year if the Red Sox
don't get their act together," which is a per
sonal favorite of mine. But to tell the truth,
the guy has skills; his version of "Dust in the
Wind" may be even better than the Will Fer
rell version. But his "Just Because" is dread
ful. Celine Dion dreadful.
And Bernie, I'm not so sure I want to
hear a song that translates to "The Sauce in
Me." Yecch.
Third, this is a borderline column (Edi
tor's note: VERY borderline . . . walk-on
borderline), so why not throw in a border
line athlete? In perhaps the worst collabora
tion of all time. The Rock had the bright
idea of hooking up with Wyclef to give us
"It Doesn't Matter", with such classic lines
as "It doesn't matter if you just bought a
fresh Bentley!"
Thanks, Dwayne. I appreciate all your
hard work in the studio. It paid off.
There are of course many others. Who
can forget Deion Sanders's album "Prime
Time," Barry Zito's soothing acoustic gui
tar or "What the Kidd Did" by Jason Kidd.
But of course, the quintessential sports rap
per, or rappers, are the Super Bowl Cham
pion '85 Chicago Bears, who want to just re
mind us that "We're not here to start no
trouble / We're just here to do the Super
Bowl Shuffle." Nearly 20 years later, it's
just as true today.

borderline), so why not throw in a border
line athlete? In perhaps the worst collabora
tion of all time. The Rock had the bright
idea of hooking up with Wyclef to give us
"It Doesn't Matter", with such classic lines
as "It doesn't matter if you just bought a
fresh Bentley!"
Thanks, Dwayne. I appreciate all your
hard work in the studio. It paid off.
There are of course many others. Who
can forget Deion Sanders's album "Prime
Time," Barry Zito's soothing acoustic gui
tar or "What the Kidd Did" by Jason Kidd.
But of course, the quintessential sports rap
per, or rappers, are the Super Bowl Cham
pion '85 Chicago Bears, who want to just re
mind us that "We're not here to start no
trouble / We're just here to do the Super
Bowl Shuffle." Nearly 20 years later, it's
just as true today.

UA nd it goes, And it goes. And it
goes a little something like
/ % this!" So begins one of the
JL JL greatest songs of my genera
tion. A staple musical interlude between
Sponge Bob and the Fairly Odd Parents on
Nickelodeon, this song really captured all the
beauty of basketball, from its schoolyard
roots to its present NBA incarnation. Featur
ing Shaquille O'Neal in one of the finest act
ing performances of all time, a young musi
cian was able to accomplish the one feat that
separates Yao Ming from superstardom.
With rhymes like "I put it in the hoop like
slam / , I heard the crowd screaming out
•Jam,' " Aaron Carter tells us, "That's how I
beat Shaq."
"Aaron's in the house / Yo guys, check it
out / Guess what happened to me

"(Another crazy story,
Come on A.C.) / I was hang
ing at the court / Just playing
some ball / Working on my
game / (Yeah, we heard it
all) / 1 heard the fans scream
ing / 1 thought it was for me /
But then I saw a shadow / It
was 12-foot-3 / It was
Shaquille O'Neal / (What?
What did he say?) / (How
bout some one-on-one. Do

you wanna play?) / I told him why not /1 got
some time / But when I beat you real bad /
Try not to cry."
Ok, so maybe this isn't the greatest song of
all time. Maybe I just wasted 99 cents on the
iTunes music store download. Maybe I'm
ashamed that anyone on South Campus can
now see that my playlist includes a song off
the album "Aaron's Party (Come Get It)"
(get "what" exactly, is never specified on the
album, but I doubt Aaron's "it" is synony
mous with 50 Cent's).
But more importantly, this is just one of a
whole slew of songs that either feature or star
prominent sports figures.
You may have heard of "The Super Bowl
Shuffle," but do you remember the Fridge deliv
ering the immortal line, "You're lookin' at the
Fridge. I'm the rookie /1 may be large, but I'm
no dumb cookie."
Do you know that Shaquille O'Neal appar
ently thought he had enough hits to merit a
"Best of" album? Do you know that Friday
columnist Julie Ruvolo is actually quite
charming in person?
These are all good questions, all good
knowledge for the true sports fan, and all in
dire need of me to comment on them.
But I'm not here to judge, nor rank, nor
criticize the life choices of sports stars. I'm
here to mock. And so without further ado, let
the mocking begin.
Let me just finish up with my man Aaron
Carter. This kid, as you may know, is market
ing his career on the line "Younger Brother of
Backstreet Boy Nick Carter", which never re
ally gave him a whole lot of cred to begin with,
and is now losing appeal by the minute. How
ever, with "That's how I beat Shaq", he really
reaches a new low.
Owing to a horrendous non-call on a bla
tant double-dribble, Aaron should not take
his victory to heart, and in my opinion, should
spend as much time on his jumpshot as he
does on looking like a tool. Nice highlights.
They're so hot right now. Like Paris Hilton,
soon to be his sister-in-law, so hot.
Second, Bernie Williams. As you may
know, the Yankees center fielder released
an album last year of his own acoustic guitar
stylings, with such canciones as "La Salsa En
Mi," "Samba Novo" and "Stranded On the
Bridge." Notoriously absent is "Mi Jefe es el
Diablo," "Gary Sheffield Tiene Muchas
Problemas Personales" y "Pedro Martinez
will be a Yankee next year if the Red Sox
don't get their act together," which is a per
sonal favorite of mine. But to tell the truth,
the guy has skills; his version of "Dust in the
Wind" may be even better than the Will Fer
rell version. But his "Just Because" is dread
ful. Celine Dion dreadful.
And Bernie, I'm not so sure I want to
hear a song that translates to "The Sauce in
Me." Yecch.

tor's note: VERY borderline . . . walk-on
