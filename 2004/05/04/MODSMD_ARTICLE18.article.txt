# No. 1 Cardinal set to face San Jose St.
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford baseball team will
begin the week once again as the top
ranked team in the country.
The Cardinal (35-6, 10-2 Pacific-10
Conference) returned to the top spot in
both the Baseball America and Colle
giate Baseball polls released yesterday
after it swept Washington State and
former No. 1 Texas lost two-of-three at
Missouri over the weekend.
Stanford was the nation's unani
mous No. 1 for two weeks in March and
topped the Baseball America poll Feb.
23- April 5.
The bigger tests for Mark Mar
quess's squad, however, will be this
weekend when Stanford travels to
Seattle fora matchup with the Pac-10's
second-place team. No. 21 Washington
(26-14-1, 10-5).
But today, the Cardinal will play its
seventh Tuesday game of the season
when it hosts local nonconference rival
San Jose State (19-25).
The Spartans are coming off their
first series win in over a month, taking
two of three from Cal State-Sacramen
to over the weekend. San Jose State
took the rubber game Sunday when
freshman Justin Santich-Hughes deliv
ered a run-scoring single in the bottom
of the ninth inning to give the Spartans
a 9-8 win.
"The win was good for us," said
Spartan manager Sam Piraro. "We had
to scrap to come back."
It was the San Jose State's first se
ries win since March 26-28 against
Nevada in Reno.
This weekend will provide Stanford
fans the first time to see legendary
Spartan manager Piraro since he
missed all of the 2003 season with bone
marrow cancer.
His return to the field was supposed
to give a big boost to the Spartan pro
gram, which reached the College
World Series in a magical 2000 run
through the postseason, but this season
has been nothing short of disappointing
for San Jose State.
Senior Matt Durkin had All-Ameri
can potential coming into this season,
but has struggled thus far, going a
mediocre 6-4 with a 4.84 ERA. He
leads the Spartan staff in innings
pitched, complete games and strike

outs, but has walked nearly one batter
every two innings. On Sunday, Durkin
lasted only four innings, giving up
seven runs on five hits while walking
four and hitting three batters.
"He wasn't sharp, and sometimes
that takes the team down a little be
cause they expect so much out of
Matt," Piraro said.
Jose Amaya was supposed to be the
team's closer but has alternated be
tween relief and the rotation the en
tire season. Instead, San Jose State's
stopper has been Brad Kilby, who
leads the club in appearances (20) and
has posted a solid 1.80 ERA with
five saves.
Offense has been even harder to
come by for the Spartans, who have
hit only 24 home runs as a team. Stan
ford, on the other hand, reached one
third of that total in a single game
this weekend.
The Spartans, who were ranked in
the top 30 in the nation in defense be
fore a string of error-prone games,
have at least been consistent behind
their pitchers.
"Defensively, this year we have
played very well," Piraro said. "That's
probably been the strong point of our
team this year, our interior defense."
Stanford will obviously present the
utmost challenge for the Spartans.
The latest check of the national stat
categories has Stanford 11th in bat
ting average (.330), ninth in runs per
game (9.0) and eighth in fielding per
centage (.974).
The story of the weekend was the
hot hitting of senior Brian Hall, who
went 10-for-ll with a double, two
round-trippers and eight RBls after
having two consecutive four-hit games
to start the weekend.
For his efforts against Washington
State and earlier in the week against
Santa Clara, Hall was named National
Player of the Week for the first time in
his career. He is the second Cardinal
player to receive the honor this year.
(The first was Jed Lowrie.)
Hall raised his season average to
.399 and has hit safely in 25 of his last
26 games, adding nine homers, 46 RBIs
and a team-high 10 stolen bases. He is
hitting an astounding .638 (30-47) in 12
Pac-10 contests, with five homers, 19
RBIs and four stolen bases.
The Cardinal now has two players —

Hall and Lowrie — hovering around
the .400 mark. Stanford has never had
two players hit .400 in the same season.
Stanford has also won 11 of its last
12 games overall, all 11 of its three
game series this season and has won 16

consecutive regular season three-game
series dating back to last year. In addi
tion, the Cardinal has a 13-game home
win streak.
Tonight's first pitch is scheduled for
6 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.

After regaining tfte top spot in the polls, Greg Reynolds and the Stanford baseball team are
ready to take on struggling San Jose State.
The Stanford baseball team will
begin the week once again as the top
ranked team in the country.
The Cardinal (35-6, 10-2 Pacific-10
Conference) returned to the top spot in
both the Baseball America and Colle
giate Baseball polls released yesterday
after it swept Washington State and
former No. 1 Texas lost two-of-three at
Missouri over the weekend.
Stanford was the nation's unani
mous No. 1 for two weeks in March and
topped the Baseball America poll Feb.
23- April 5.
The bigger tests for Mark Mar
quess's squad, however, will be this
weekend when Stanford travels to
Seattle fora matchup with the Pac-10's
second-place team. No. 21 Washington
(26-14-1, 10-5).
But today, the Cardinal will play its
seventh Tuesday game of the season
when it hosts local nonconference rival
San Jose State (19-25).
The Spartans are coming off their
first series win in over a month, taking
two of three from Cal State-Sacramen
to over the weekend. San Jose State
took the rubber game Sunday when
freshman Justin Santich-Hughes deliv
ered a run-scoring single in the bottom
of the ninth inning to give the Spartans
a 9-8 win.
"The win was good for us," said
Spartan manager Sam Piraro. "We had
to scrap to come back."
It was the San Jose State's first se
ries win since March 26-28 against
Nevada in Reno.
This weekend will provide Stanford
fans the first time to see legendary
Spartan manager Piraro since he
missed all of the 2003 season with bone
marrow cancer.
His return to the field was supposed
to give a big boost to the Spartan pro
gram, which reached the College
World Series in a magical 2000 run
through the postseason, but this season
has been nothing short of disappointing
for San Jose State.
Senior Matt Durkin had All-Ameri
can potential coming into this season,
but has struggled thus far, going a
mediocre 6-4 with a 4.84 ERA. He
leads the Spartan staff in innings
pitched, complete games and strike

outs, but has walked nearly one batter
every two innings. On Sunday, Durkin
lasted only four innings, giving up
seven runs on five hits while walking
four and hitting three batters.
"He wasn't sharp, and sometimes
that takes the team down a little be
cause they expect so much out of
Matt," Piraro said.
Jose Amaya was supposed to be the
team's closer but has alternated be
tween relief and the rotation the en
tire season. Instead, San Jose State's
stopper has been Brad Kilby, who
leads the club in appearances (20) and
has posted a solid 1.80 ERA with
five saves.
Offense has been even harder to
come by for the Spartans, who have
hit only 24 home runs as a team. Stan
ford, on the other hand, reached one
third of that total in a single game
this weekend.
The Spartans, who were ranked in
the top 30 in the nation in defense be
fore a string of error-prone games,
have at least been consistent behind
their pitchers.
"Defensively, this year we have
played very well," Piraro said. "That's
probably been the strong point of our
team this year, our interior defense."
Stanford will obviously present the
utmost challenge for the Spartans.
The latest check of the national stat
categories has Stanford 11th in bat
ting average (.330), ninth in runs per
game (9.0) and eighth in fielding per
centage (.974).
The story of the weekend was the
hot hitting of senior Brian Hall, who
went 10-for-ll with a double, two
round-trippers and eight RBls after
having two consecutive four-hit games
to start the weekend.
For his efforts against Washington
State and earlier in the week against
Santa Clara, Hall was named National
Player of the Week for the first time in
his career. He is the second Cardinal
player to receive the honor this year.
(The first was Jed Lowrie.)
Hall raised his season average to
.399 and has hit safely in 25 of his last
26 games, adding nine homers, 46 RBIs
and a team-high 10 stolen bases. He is
hitting an astounding .638 (30-47) in 12
Pac-10 contests, with five homers, 19
RBIs and four stolen bases.
The Cardinal now has two players —

Hall and Lowrie — hovering around
the .400 mark. Stanford has never had
two players hit .400 in the same season.
Stanford has also won 11 of its last
12 games overall, all 11 of its three
game series this season and has won 16

consecutive regular season three-game
series dating back to last year. In addi
tion, the Cardinal has a 13-game home
win streak.
Tonight's first pitch is scheduled for
6 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
