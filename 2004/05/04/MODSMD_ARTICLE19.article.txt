# Carter Morris leads the Stanford men's tennis team in his final year on the Farm
## 
### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The time is drawing near for seniors to say their
goodbyes to the old Farm and perhaps move on to big
ger and better things. For the No. 9 men's tennis team,
however, it is especially hard to say goodbye to one of
its most beloved players.
Originally from Washington, DC, redshirt senior Carter

Morris came to Stanford five years ago. The outstanding
prep player carried the distinction of being ranked within
the top 50 in the nation and first in his section, but it was clear
to him which university would be his perfect match.
"I liked the feel of (Stanford's] campus when I visited,
and it has the best mix of academics and tennis," Morris
said. "I also wanted a chance to be on a team with some of
the best players in the country."
Since his entrance into the college tennis scene, Morris
has been a critical component of the Stanford team.
As a player, Morris is a fierce competitor, and the light

hearted gentleman off the courts describes his "incredible
intimidation skills" as his best skill on the courts.
His ferociousness on the courts isn't the only thing that
impresses his coaches, however.
"He's given everything he has for five years, there's
been a lot of stuff he's been through," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "I just can't really ask for more. He's
meant so much to the team in so many ways."
The team recently showed their appreciation for Mor-

ris's contributions and leadership when they named him
team captain for the 2003-2004 season.
"His teammates really respect his work ethics," Gould
said. "He's an outstanding doubles player but he's a great
person too and we are really going to miss him next year."
The first tennis tournament that Morris ever won
might have been under slightly amusing circumstances,
but it was the beginning of an outstanding tennis career for
one of Stanford's brightest.
"The 'D.C. Championships'... was only for people
who live in Washington, D.C.," Morris said. "Half the

guys I played didn't know the rules, so I'd hit serves to the
baseline, and they'd be like, 'Good shot.' "
Morris had a few idols growing up, like most aspiring
tennis players, but he also admires a few of Stanford's
most distinguished tennis alumni.
"Like every other American kid, I loved Agassi and
Sampras," Morris said. "I also really liked Becker and
Rafter. In my area there were a couple guys who always
did really well nationally that I looked up to — Paul Gold
stein and Alex Kim."
As a singles player, Morris is someone the team can al
ways count on. Last weekend, he proved his skills to the
tennis world by making his way to the finals of the Pac-10
Invitational singles event in Ojai, Calif. Even so. Morris
still favors his doubles game.
"[I like playing] doubles, as long as my partner isn't
throwing his racquet when I miss shots," Morris said.
"Doubles is fun because it's intense all the way through
since it's only an eight-game pro set."
"The finals were pretty disappointing, because it was
my last match at Ojai and it was also [Coach Gould's] last
match — he was on the court with me. I had a lead and
ended up losing it, so that hurt."
Morris's tennis career got sidelined during the 2001-
2002 season when he was forced to redshirt the year after
he came down with mononucleosis. However, he bounced
right back to finish the 2002-2003 season with an impres
sive 16-8 singles record, 21-4 doubles record and was dis
tinguished as a member of the Pac-10 All-Academic sec
ond team.
"Nobody works harder than Carter, and that may be
why he got sick with mono," Gould said. "He gives every
thing he's got 100 percent of his time."
Morris won't be the only person to leave the team.
Senior teammate Joe Kao and coach Gould will also
say their farewells after the NCAA tournament at the
end of May.
Gould will assume the role of Director of Tennis after
retiring from the position of head coach. Gould has led the
Stanford team to 17 NCAA Championships in his 38 years
of coaching and his absence will be felt when he steps
down at the end of the season.
"I've learned so much from [Gould and associate head
coach John Whitlinger] — about how to compete, how to
deal with life issues and how to be part of a team," Morris
said. "I've probably learned more from them than anyone
else at Stanford."
Morris will move on to an internship after he leaves
the Farm, but there are a few things he will miss most
about Stanford.
"The girls," Morris said. "And also [freshman team
mate] James Wan's 'weaselish hair game.' "
There is no question that Morris has a bright future
ahead of him, but his personal motto gives us a hint as to
how he became the outstanding athlete and exceptional
individual he is today:
"Remember who you arc and what you represent."

"I liked the feel of (Stanford's] campus when I visited,
and it has the best mix of academics and tennis," Morris
said. "I also wanted a chance to be on a team with some of
the best players in the country."
Since his entrance into the college tennis scene, Morris
has been a critical component of the Stanford team.
As a player, Morris is a fierce competitor, and the light

hearted gentleman off the courts describes his "incredible
intimidation skills" as his best skill on the courts.
His ferociousness on the courts isn't the only thing that
impresses his coaches, however.
"He's given everything he has for five years, there's
been a lot of stuff he's been through," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "I just can't really ask for more. He's
meant so much to the team in so many ways."
The team recently showed their appreciation for Mor-

ris's contributions and leadership when they named him
team captain for the 2003-2004 season.
"His teammates really respect his work ethics," Gould
said. "He's an outstanding doubles player but he's a great
person too and we are really going to miss him next year."
The first tennis tournament that Morris ever won
might have been under slightly amusing circumstances,
but it was the beginning of an outstanding tennis career for
one of Stanford's brightest.
"The 'D.C. Championships'... was only for people
who live in Washington, D.C.," Morris said. "Half the

guys I played didn't know the rules, so I'd hit serves to the
baseline, and they'd be like, 'Good shot.' "
Morris had a few idols growing up, like most aspiring
tennis players, but he also admires a few of Stanford's
most distinguished tennis alumni.
"Like every other American kid, I loved Agassi and
Sampras," Morris said. "I also really liked Becker and
Rafter. In my area there were a couple guys who always
did really well nationally that I looked up to — Paul Gold
stein and Alex Kim."
As a singles player, Morris is someone the team can al
ways count on. Last weekend, he proved his skills to the
tennis world by making his way to the finals of the Pac-10
Invitational singles event in Ojai, Calif. Even so. Morris
still favors his doubles game.
"[I like playing] doubles, as long as my partner isn't
throwing his racquet when I miss shots," Morris said.
"Doubles is fun because it's intense all the way through
since it's only an eight-game pro set."
"The finals were pretty disappointing, because it was
my last match at Ojai and it was also [Coach Gould's] last
match — he was on the court with me. I had a lead and
ended up losing it, so that hurt."
Morris's tennis career got sidelined during the 2001-
2002 season when he was forced to redshirt the year after
he came down with mononucleosis. However, he bounced
right back to finish the 2002-2003 season with an impres
sive 16-8 singles record, 21-4 doubles record and was dis
tinguished as a member of the Pac-10 All-Academic sec
ond team.
"Nobody works harder than Carter, and that may be
why he got sick with mono," Gould said. "He gives every
thing he's got 100 percent of his time."
Morris won't be the only person to leave the team.
Senior teammate Joe Kao and coach Gould will also
say their farewells after the NCAA tournament at the
end of May.
Gould will assume the role of Director of Tennis after
retiring from the position of head coach. Gould has led the
Stanford team to 17 NCAA Championships in his 38 years
of coaching and his absence will be felt when he steps
down at the end of the season.
"I've learned so much from [Gould and associate head
coach John Whitlinger] — about how to compete, how to
deal with life issues and how to be part of a team," Morris
said. "I've probably learned more from them than anyone
else at Stanford."
Morris will move on to an internship after he leaves
the Farm, but there are a few things he will miss most
about Stanford.
"The girls," Morris said. "And also [freshman team
mate] James Wan's 'weaselish hair game.' "
There is no question that Morris has a bright future
ahead of him, but his personal motto gives us a hint as to
how he became the outstanding athlete and exceptional
individual he is today:
"Remember who you arc and what you represent."

Senior Carter Morris and head coach Dick Gould are winding down their final seasons with the Stanford men's tennis team
Morris reached the finals of the Pac-10 Invitational this past weekend.
The time is drawing near for seniors to say their
goodbyes to the old Farm and perhaps move on to big
ger and better things. For the No. 9 men's tennis team,
however, it is especially hard to say goodbye to one of
its most beloved players.
Originally from Washington, DC, redshirt senior Carter

Morris came to Stanford five years ago. The outstanding
prep player carried the distinction of being ranked within
the top 50 in the nation and first in his section, but it was clear
to him which university would be his perfect match.
