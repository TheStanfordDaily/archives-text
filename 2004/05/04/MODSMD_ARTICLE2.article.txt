While many new candidates have jumped into
the upcoming special election, senior Mikey Lee
and sophomore Alyssa Schwartz are entering the
home stretch of what has been a long and gruel
ing process. The pair announced their decision to
run together a little over a week ago after split
ting from former running mates juniors Dylan
Mefford and Ajani Husbands, respectively. In
joining forces, Lee and Schwartz have rebuilt
their platforms to include what they considered
to be the strengths of their previous campaigns.
"Everyone is okay about how things turned
out," Schwartz said of the controversy surround
ing the slate's unification. "It was a little tough at
the beginning but there were no bad intentions
on anyone's part."

According to Lee, Mefford helped the pair post
flyers and played an important role in deciding
which issues to include in the new platform.
As in his previous campaign, Lee said the
slate benefits from his outsider status, having
never worked within the Undergraduate Sen
ate. Alternatively, Schwartz has held a posi
tion in the ASSU as a member of the previous
Undergraduate Senate.
"Mikey brings his experience talking to the
administration and the enthusiasm it takes to
make real change," Schwartz said. "I know how
things work on the inside."
In constructing their new platform, presiden
tial candidate Lee and vice-presidential candidate
Schwartz said they incorporated the aspects that
had worked for them in the first election. They
both added that the new platform is more moder
ate and based more on compromise. In the previ

ous campaign, Lee and Mefford emphasized the
need to match grants for student groups and
dorms as part of the ASSU Absolute Fun pro
gram, while Husbands and Schwartz wanted to
funnel money toward social events. The new slate
attempts to strike a balance between the two.
The new platform also underscores advoca
cy efforts. According to Schwartz, the slate in
tends to work on behalf of underrepresented
groups on campus — especially ethnic commu
nity centers, the queer community and students
with disabilities — to make their concerns
more visible. She added that the slate is cur
rently working to introduce changes to New
Student Orientation and resident assistant
training in order to highlight and cater to the
needs of these groups on campus.
