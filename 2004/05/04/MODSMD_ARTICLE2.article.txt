# Lee, Schwartz join forces, combine ideas second time around
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
While many new candidates have jumped into
the upcoming special election, senior Mikey Lee
and sophomore Alyssa Schwartz are entering the
home stretch of what has been a long and gruel
ing process. The pair announced their decision to
run together a little over a week ago after split
ting from former running mates juniors Dylan
Mefford and Ajani Husbands, respectively. In
joining forces, Lee and Schwartz have rebuilt
their platforms to include what they considered
to be the strengths of their previous campaigns.
"Everyone is okay about how things turned
out," Schwartz said of the controversy surround
ing the slate's unification. "It was a little tough at
the beginning but there were no bad intentions
on anyone's part."

According to Lee, Mefford helped the pair post
flyers and played an important role in deciding
which issues to include in the new platform.
As in his previous campaign, Lee said the
slate benefits from his outsider status, having
never worked within the Undergraduate Sen
ate. Alternatively, Schwartz has held a posi
tion in the ASSU as a member of the previous
Undergraduate Senate.
"Mikey brings his experience talking to the
administration and the enthusiasm it takes to
make real change," Schwartz said. "I know how
things work on the inside."
In constructing their new platform, presiden
tial candidate Lee and vice-presidential candidate
Schwartz said they incorporated the aspects that
had worked for them in the first election. They
both added that the new platform is more moder
ate and based more on compromise. In the previ

ous campaign, Lee and Mefford emphasized the
need to match grants for student groups and
dorms as part of the ASSU Absolute Fun pro
gram, while Husbands and Schwartz wanted to
funnel money toward social events. The new slate
attempts to strike a balance between the two.
The new platform also underscores advoca
cy efforts. According to Schwartz, the slate in
tends to work on behalf of underrepresented
groups on campus — especially ethnic commu
nity centers, the queer community and students
with disabilities — to make their concerns
more visible. She added that the slate is cur
rently working to introduce changes to New
Student Orientation and resident assistant
training in order to highlight and cater to the
needs of these groups on campus.

"In the short term there are
things that we know we can do for
sure and in the long term we can set
the groundwork for future execu
tive slates," Lee said.
Both candidates have been in
conversation with the Office of the
President and the Office of the
Vice Provost for Student Affairs,
lobbying for an extra $25,000 to
augment the ASSU Absolute Fun
program. In addition, Lee said the
slate hopes to cultivate the arts
community on campus by aiding in
space reservations and increasing
the visibility of student art.
The heart of the new platform is
Lee and Schwartz's 60-day plan, a
list of goals they hope to accom
plish immediately after they take
office. The list includes lowering
prices at the Stanford Bookstore,
re-instating the Mausoleum Party,
extending the Caltrain subsidy to
undergraduates, reducing the price
of Big Game tickets and re-evaluat
ing the current special-fees system.
"We're really hoping to get
the chance to implement all of
these ideas," Lee said. "If we're
going to improve things, we need
to start now. We're ready to
launch right in."
Both Lee and Schwartz cited
close ties to the administration
as a major campaign strength
that has helped them determine
what is important and feasible.
The relationships built with key
officials will also allow them to
serve as better link between the
University and the student
body, Lee added.
"As direct representatives of
the student body it would be our
responsibility to make sure the
administration is aware of stu
dents concerns and needs,"
Schwartz said, adding that the
major complaint about the Hus
bands-Schwartz slate was that it
was too distant from the adminis
tration, while critics of the Lee-
Mefford slate said it was too re
moved from the students. Both

candidates expressed their hope
that the new unified ticket will
ease these problems.
At the same time, Lee said he
didn't want students to think the
slate's relations with the adminis
tration would compromise their
duty to students.
"It always boils down to doing
as much as you can to make sure
the students know what is going
on." he said, taking the Universi
ty's Alcohol Policy as an example.
"We'll talk to the administration
and communicate what they say to
the students. In this way we'll re
ally act as a liaison between them.
If there's anyone who can go to
the administration and say this is
what needs to be done, we hope
it's us."
Having weathered the full cycle
of the first election, both candi
dates said they will be happy when
the process is complete regardless
of the outcome. At the same time.
Schwartz said the special election
actually provided the slate with
more time to narrow its focus on
determine what students really
care about.
"If anything our ideas have been
strengthened," she said. "We know
what needs to happen and what we
can make happen."
In response to the various other
slates jumping into the mix, both
Lee and Schwartz said they know
and respect many of the candidates.
Even so. they expressed worry that
the informal tone of some of their
competitors might compromise the
significance of the ASSU leadership
and the issues at hand.
"I really love The Chappie, but
it seems like it is all becoming a
joke, people saying "who cares,
vote for anyone,'" Schwartz said.
"People need to be able to make an
educated decision."
Lee stressed his concern that
many students don't know a special
election is being held at all and that
if anything all of the competing
slates need to encourage students
to get out and vote.
"The election needs to be taken
seriously," Schwartz said. "At the

more democracy."

funnel money toward social events. The new slate
attempts to strike a balance between the two.
The new platform also underscores advoca
cy efforts. According to Schwartz, the slate in
tends to work on behalf of underrepresented
groups on campus — especially ethnic commu
nity centers, the queer community and students
with disabilities — to make their concerns
more visible. She added that the slate is cur
rently working to introduce changes to New
Student Orientation and resident assistant
training in order to highlight and cater to the
needs of these groups on campus.

"In the short term there are
things that we know we can do for
sure and in the long term we can set
the groundwork for future execu
tive slates," Lee said.
Both candidates have been in
conversation with the Office of the
President and the Office of the
Vice Provost for Student Affairs,
lobbying for an extra $25,000 to
augment the ASSU Absolute Fun
program. In addition, Lee said the
slate hopes to cultivate the arts
community on campus by aiding in
space reservations and increasing
the visibility of student art.
The heart of the new platform is
Lee and Schwartz's 60-day plan, a
list of goals they hope to accom
plish immediately after they take
office. The list includes lowering
prices at the Stanford Bookstore,
re-instating the Mausoleum Party,
extending the Caltrain subsidy to
undergraduates, reducing the price
of Big Game tickets and re-evaluat
ing the current special-fees system.
"We're really hoping to get
the chance to implement all of
these ideas," Lee said. "If we're
going to improve things, we need
to start now. We're ready to
launch right in."
Both Lee and Schwartz cited
close ties to the administration
as a major campaign strength
that has helped them determine
what is important and feasible.
The relationships built with key
officials will also allow them to
serve as better link between the
University and the student
body, Lee added.
"As direct representatives of
the student body it would be our
responsibility to make sure the
administration is aware of stu
dents concerns and needs,"
Schwartz said, adding that the
major complaint about the Hus
bands-Schwartz slate was that it
was too distant from the adminis
tration, while critics of the Lee-
Mefford slate said it was too re
moved from the students. Both

candidates expressed their hope
that the new unified ticket will
ease these problems.
At the same time, Lee said he
didn't want students to think the
slate's relations with the adminis
tration would compromise their
duty to students.
"It always boils down to doing
as much as you can to make sure
the students know what is going
on." he said, taking the Universi
ty's Alcohol Policy as an example.
"We'll talk to the administration
and communicate what they say to
the students. In this way we'll re
ally act as a liaison between them.
If there's anyone who can go to
the administration and say this is
what needs to be done, we hope
it's us."
Having weathered the full cycle
of the first election, both candi
dates said they will be happy when
the process is complete regardless
of the outcome. At the same time.
Schwartz said the special election
actually provided the slate with
more time to narrow its focus on
determine what students really
care about.
"If anything our ideas have been
strengthened," she said. "We know
what needs to happen and what we
can make happen."
In response to the various other
slates jumping into the mix, both
Lee and Schwartz said they know
and respect many of the candidates.
Even so. they expressed worry that
the informal tone of some of their
competitors might compromise the
significance of the ASSU leadership
and the issues at hand.
"I really love The Chappie, but
it seems like it is all becoming a
joke, people saying "who cares,
vote for anyone,'" Schwartz said.
"People need to be able to make an
educated decision."
Lee stressed his concern that
many students don't know a special
election is being held at all and that
if anything all of the competing
slates need to encourage students
to get out and vote.
"The election needs to be taken
seriously," Schwartz said. "At the
same time, the more slates, the
more democracy."
While many new candidates have jumped into
the upcoming special election, senior Mikey Lee
and sophomore Alyssa Schwartz are entering the
home stretch of what has been a long and gruel
ing process. The pair announced their decision to
run together a little over a week ago after split
ting from former running mates juniors Dylan
Mefford and Ajani Husbands, respectively. In
joining forces, Lee and Schwartz have rebuilt
their platforms to include what they considered
to be the strengths of their previous campaigns.
"Everyone is okay about how things turned
out," Schwartz said of the controversy surround
ing the slate's unification. "It was a little tough at
the beginning but there were no bad intentions
on anyone's part."

According to Lee, Mefford helped the pair post
flyers and played an important role in deciding
which issues to include in the new platform.
As in his previous campaign, Lee said the
slate benefits from his outsider status, having
never worked within the Undergraduate Sen
ate. Alternatively, Schwartz has held a posi
tion in the ASSU as a member of the previous
Undergraduate Senate.
"Mikey brings his experience talking to the
administration and the enthusiasm it takes to
make real change," Schwartz said. "I know how
things work on the inside."
In constructing their new platform, presiden
tial candidate Lee and vice-presidential candidate
Schwartz said they incorporated the aspects that
had worked for them in the first election. They
both added that the new platform is more moder
ate and based more on compromise. In the previ

ous campaign, Lee and Mefford emphasized the
need to match grants for student groups and
dorms as part of the ASSU Absolute Fun pro
gram, while Husbands and Schwartz wanted to
funnel money toward social events. The new slate
attempts to strike a balance between the two.
The new platform also underscores advoca
cy efforts. According to Schwartz, the slate in
tends to work on behalf of underrepresented
groups on campus — especially ethnic commu
nity centers, the queer community and students
with disabilities — to make their concerns
