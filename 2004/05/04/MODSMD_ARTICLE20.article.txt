# USC defeats women in overtime of MPSF Finals
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Just by looking at their rankings, it was no sur
prise to see No. 2 Stanford (20-4, 10-1 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) and No. 1 Southern Califor
nia (27-0,11-0) tace off once again in the finals of the
MPSF women's water polo tournament.
And although it was a weekend that followed the
trends of the season — as the No. 1 Trojans managed
to best the Cardinal for the fourth time — the loss
was only a small blow to Stanford.
The C ardinal kicked off the tournament with a
convincing 10-3 win over No. 7 Hawaii (13-15, 7-4)
Fiiday night. Stanford expected to play the stronger
Hawaii squad instead of UC-Irvine (10-21, 3-8) and
showed how well it had prepared for the match. Due
to the impressive performances of sophomore driver
Scotti Shafer, who notched three goals, and fresh
man driver Katie Hansen, who added two of her
own, the Stanford defense had an easier job of keep
ing Hawaii's biggest offensive threats — Beth
Novick and Darcy Scott-Hasaka — at bay.
After an uncharacteristically low-scoring first pe
riod in which the Cardinal managed only one goal.
Stanford came back in the second and outscored the
Rainbow Wahine to end the half with a 6-1 lead.
The game was already wrapped up when the Car
dinal added four more goals in the second half to
move on to the semifinals and eliminate Hawaii's
hopes of advancing.
In the semifinal game, rival UCLA (21-5, 9-2)
faced Stanford for the third time this season, and
fell, 3-2.
In its previous matches, Stanford defeated the
Bruins in close games, 6-5 and 5-3, respectively. Sat
urday night's game didn't prove to be any different.
The win came down to the last minutes of the match,
with Hansen's shot finding the cage as the fourth pe
riod wound down.
Senior two-meter defender Wendy Watkins and

sophomore two-meter defender Nancy El-Sakkary
put the Cardinal up 2-0 after a scoreless first period
before the Bruins' Kristina Kunkel and Molly Cahill
tied the game in the third.
Hansen continued her impressive tournament
showing as she scored on a 6-on-5 with a minute left
in the match to end the Cardinal's two period offen
sive drought. UCLA had the chance to send the
game into overtime, but Kunkel's final shot sailed
too high.
Stanford found itself in the MPSF championship
game for the fourth consecutive year on Sunday
night. With USC defeating host Long Beach State 8-
5 the previous day, Stanford was presented another
chance to defeat the Women of Troy this season, as
all of Stanford's previous losses had come at the
hands of USC.
Both teams played a solid game, as evidenced
early by the first period ending in a 2-2 tie. Junior
two-meter Kelty Luber's back-to-back goals in the
second period, however, gave the Cardinal a 5-3 lead
in the second.
Anna Pardo led the Women of Troy with three
goals, one of which tied the match 5-5 in the third
period. Things continued to go back and forth be
tween the top-ranked teams until freshman two
meter Christina Hewko's goal retook the lead for
Stanford, 6-5.
USC answered back in the fourth period, which
was scoreless for the Cardinal. Brittany Hayes, who
had two goals on Saturday, sent her team into over
time with a 6-on-5 goal.
After goals by Pardo and Moriah Van Norman
put the Women of Troy up by two, senior driver Lau
ren Faust scored her third goal of the game. Unfor
tunately for Stanford, Southern California kept the
Cardinal at bay for the remainder of the game.
The 8-7 Southern California win reflected the
Cardinal's woes against the Women of Troy this sea
son. The loss ended Stanford's seven-game win
streak but extended its losing streak to four against

the Women of Troy.
USC earned its first MPSF title and extended
their astounding season to a perfect 27-0. They head
to the NCAA Championships this weekend, which

will be held at Stanford's Avery Aquatic Center.
Stanford has one more chance to get the Trojans
and an opportunity for redemption, as Stanford re
ceived the NCAA at-large berth.

Despite taking a 5-3 second period lead, Hie No. 2 women's water polo team was unable to defeat the Women of Troy,
eventually falling 8-7 in overtime.
Just by looking at their rankings, it was no sur
prise to see No. 2 Stanford (20-4, 10-1 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) and No. 1 Southern Califor
nia (27-0,11-0) tace off once again in the finals of the
MPSF women's water polo tournament.
And although it was a weekend that followed the
trends of the season — as the No. 1 Trojans managed
to best the Cardinal for the fourth time — the loss
was only a small blow to Stanford.
The C ardinal kicked off the tournament with a
convincing 10-3 win over No. 7 Hawaii (13-15, 7-4)
Fiiday night. Stanford expected to play the stronger
Hawaii squad instead of UC-Irvine (10-21, 3-8) and
showed how well it had prepared for the match. Due
to the impressive performances of sophomore driver
Scotti Shafer, who notched three goals, and fresh
man driver Katie Hansen, who added two of her
own, the Stanford defense had an easier job of keep
ing Hawaii's biggest offensive threats — Beth
Novick and Darcy Scott-Hasaka — at bay.
After an uncharacteristically low-scoring first pe
riod in which the Cardinal managed only one goal.
Stanford came back in the second and outscored the
Rainbow Wahine to end the half with a 6-1 lead.
The game was already wrapped up when the Car
dinal added four more goals in the second half to
move on to the semifinals and eliminate Hawaii's
hopes of advancing.
In the semifinal game, rival UCLA (21-5, 9-2)
faced Stanford for the third time this season, and
fell, 3-2.
In its previous matches, Stanford defeated the
Bruins in close games, 6-5 and 5-3, respectively. Sat
urday night's game didn't prove to be any different.
The win came down to the last minutes of the match,
with Hansen's shot finding the cage as the fourth pe
riod wound down.
Senior two-meter defender Wendy Watkins and

sophomore two-meter defender Nancy El-Sakkary
put the Cardinal up 2-0 after a scoreless first period
before the Bruins' Kristina Kunkel and Molly Cahill
tied the game in the third.
Hansen continued her impressive tournament
showing as she scored on a 6-on-5 with a minute left
in the match to end the Cardinal's two period offen
sive drought. UCLA had the chance to send the
game into overtime, but Kunkel's final shot sailed
too high.
Stanford found itself in the MPSF championship
game for the fourth consecutive year on Sunday
night. With USC defeating host Long Beach State 8-
5 the previous day, Stanford was presented another
chance to defeat the Women of Troy this season, as
all of Stanford's previous losses had come at the
hands of USC.
Both teams played a solid game, as evidenced
early by the first period ending in a 2-2 tie. Junior
two-meter Kelty Luber's back-to-back goals in the
second period, however, gave the Cardinal a 5-3 lead
in the second.
Anna Pardo led the Women of Troy with three
goals, one of which tied the match 5-5 in the third
period. Things continued to go back and forth be
tween the top-ranked teams until freshman two
meter Christina Hewko's goal retook the lead for
Stanford, 6-5.
USC answered back in the fourth period, which
was scoreless for the Cardinal. Brittany Hayes, who
had two goals on Saturday, sent her team into over
time with a 6-on-5 goal.
After goals by Pardo and Moriah Van Norman
put the Women of Troy up by two, senior driver Lau
ren Faust scored her third goal of the game. Unfor
tunately for Stanford, Southern California kept the
Cardinal at bay for the remainder of the game.
The 8-7 Southern California win reflected the
Cardinal's woes against the Women of Troy this sea
son. The loss ended Stanford's seven-game win
streak but extended its losing streak to four against

the Women of Troy.
USC earned its first MPSF title and extended
their astounding season to a perfect 27-0. They head
to the NCAA Championships this weekend, which

will be held at Stanford's Avery Aquatic Center.
Stanford has one more chance to get the Trojans
and an opportunity for redemption, as Stanford re
ceived the NCAA at-large berth.
