## 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With its 12-3 loss to No. 7 Georgetown, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team leveled its wins and losses at eight
this past Saturday in Washington, D.C.
While the team displays double eights in its record, it
was the number six that the Cardinal (4-0 Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation) struggled with at North Kehoe Field
as the Hoyas twice scored six unanswered goals. This loss
also evens Stanford's record on the road at 2-2 while im
proving Georgetown's record on its home turf to 7-1.
"Although the score may not have reflected [it], I do
think that we were matched up better this year," said se
nior midfielder Abbi Hills. "Last year, I thinkwe ap
proached the game with more fear, [but this weekend] we
approached the game with more of a risk-willing, experi
enced mindset."
The Hoyas had no trouble bouncing back from their
loss earlier last week to No. 8 James Madison. George
town junior att acker Sarah Oliphant scored the first goal of
the game just under six minutes into the first period. Fol
lowing herinitial goal, Oliphant and four other Hoyas pro
ceeded to score five more goals to bring the lead to 6-0.
Finally, with 2:40 left in the period, Stanford buckled
down. After Georgetown's goalie, Sarah Robinson, hur
ried behind the goal fora ground ball. Cardinal junior
midfielder Claire Calzonetti checked the ball free from
Robinson and shot it into the open goal to finally put Stan
ford on the scoreboard.
After Calzonetti's breakthrough goal, Stanford en
tered the second period with a vengeance.
At 26:34, Abbi Hills marked her seventh assist of the
season when she spotted and passed to sophomore
Megan Burker, who then tallied her 25th goal, ranking
second on the team only to Hills' 31 goals.

Hills took matters into her own hands and went to
work on her own, netting an unassisted goal three minutes
after Burker's goal to cut the Stanford deficit to 6-3.
Georgetown, however, was able to bounce back with
yet another devastating six-goal scoring streak.
"The frustrating part for our players was we know how
to attack that, but we weren't able to do it against George
town," said head coach Michele Uhlfelder.
In the latter period, senior midfielder Gloria Lozano
commemorated the Hoyas' Senior Day with her second
and third goals of the game and Oliphant tacked on an
other goal to bring her total on the day to three.
On Saturday, Georgetown's offense lived up to its
strong statistics — the Hoyas boast five attackers who
have scored at least 20 goals this season. In addition to
Lozano and Oliphant's hat tricks, three other Hoyas
helped display the team's depth by scoring in the sec
ond period, with the last goal netted with only 44 sec
onds remaining.
"We got a couple very good posessions and started to
get fiied up at the beginning of the second half," Uhlfelder
said. "However[our attacking] was frantic; we felt pres
sured and didn't make good decisions with the ball."
While Stanford could not tally a win, senior goalie
Christina Saikus turned away 16 Hoya shots, adding to
her total of 147 saves this year. Also contributing to the
Cardinal's defense was senior defender Katie Grube, who
increased her numbers in the caused turnovers column,
adding to the nine posted previously this season.
Although many of the team's family and friends were in
attendance at Saturday's game (many of Stanford's players
hail from the lacrosse-friendly East Coast), the Cardinal
could not come up with the win over the Hoyas in the regu
lar season finale. Despite this weekend's loss, look for
Stanford to have a strong showing at the upcoming MPSF
Championships, at which the Cardinal is the top seed.
