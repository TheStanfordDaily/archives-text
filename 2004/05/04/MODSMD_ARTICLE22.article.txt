"Rachel opposed hate and racism and oppression
wherever she found it," said Cindy Corrie during a
tribute to her daughter last night. The young Ameri
can activist was killed by a bulldozer in Gaza while
trying to prevent the demolition of a Palestinian
home. Cindy and her husband Craig Corrie's talk, ti
tled "A Tribute to Rachel Corrie," was part of Pales
tine Awareness Month, which is sponsored by the
Coalition for Justice and the Muslim Student Aware
ness Network.
According to Mrs. Corrie, Rachel, a 23-year-old
from Olympia, Wash, was always seen as an activist
to her hometown. As a 10-year-old she delivered a
speech in which she described a mission for peace
that stressed the importance of understanding.
"We've got to understand that people in third-world

countries think and care and smile and cry just like
us," Rachel said in a home video that her father
shared with the audience.
Mrs. Corrie said that Rachel never believed that
protesting was an extreme action.
"For Rachel, it was all about the Palestinians' suf
fering," Mrs. Corrie said.
She claimed that it was the terrorist attacks on
Sept. 11,2001 that jump-started Rachel's active par
ticipation in what she considered to be the quest to
world peace. It was shortly after these attacks that
she began to reflect on the U.S war on terrorism and
the U.S government's role and impact on the world,
Mrs. Corrie said. Soon Rachel joined several world
peace groups, one of which led her to Israel and even
tually her death.
Mrs. Corrie remained calm as she described first
hearing about her daughter's death.
"I still remember the headline on the television,"

she said. "'Olympia woman killed in the Gaza Strip,'"
which was later updated to "Rachel Corrie killed in
the Gaza Strip."
Mrs. Corrie said that after Rachel's death, she and
her husband wanted to travel to the Middle East to ex
perience firsthand what the situation was really like.
They visited the home of the family in which Rachel was
staying with. Mrs. Corrie said that the family showed
her where Rachel used to eat and sleep.
Their daughter's death has prompted Craig and
Cindy Corrie to try to continue her work. They have
convinced their congressperson to propose to the
House of Representatives an independent U.S in
vestigation into Rachel Corrie's death, which Mrs.
Carrie said that the U.S. government had been "no
tably quiet" about.
She added, "Rachel stood there that day because the
U.S and Israel rejected a proposal in the U.N. to send in
ternational human rights monitors to the region."
