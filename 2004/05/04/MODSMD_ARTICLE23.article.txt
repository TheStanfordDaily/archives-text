# Another horse attacked by mountain lion
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
A horse was attacked by what experts suspect was a
mountain lion last Friday on the south side of Page Mill
Road in the second such attack this week. The previous
attack took place the previous Friday west of Interstate
280. Both attacks txxurred on Stanford property.
The most recent attack has many of the characteris
tics of a mountain lion attack, including close, superficial
scratches and scratches that occur on top of the horse
and down the flanks, where no other animal could reach.
"I'm trying to convince myself it could be from
barbed wire but it's too difficult," said Elaine Carpen
ter, a veterinarian who is currently treating the horse.
The most recent incident occurred around dusk,
and the horse was found that evening, scared and
with serious injuries that resulted mostly from run
ning into barbed wire as it escaped.
Giselle Turchet — manager of Page Mill Pas

tures, where the horse was held — pointed out that
the evidence remains inconclusive.
"I certainly don't want to excuse the idea, but we have
had no sightings t in the property," she siiid. "You'd think
[the lionsj would get a goat before they get a horse."
The Department of Fish and Game did not find
any tracks near the location where the horse had
been held. An investigator did find a tuft of tan-col
ored hair on the barbed wire where the horse had es
caped. but department representatives said they had
not yet analyzed the hair.
"In both of these cases we don't have definitive in
formation," Fish and Game Lt. Dennis Baldwin said.
Even without a definite cause of the attacks, the De
partment of Fish and Game is considering issuing a li
cense for the owner of the ranch or of the horse to hunt
and kill the possible mountain lion. They have not yet de
cided on a course of action. Baldwin said, because load
codes may prevent hunting on Stanford land. According
to Stanford Police Sgt. Rick Tipton, Stanford is designat-

Ed as a game refuge, where no hunting is allowed.
The injuries to the horse were more inconclusive in
the first attack which occurred April 23 near Felt Lake.
"The animal had injuries that were consistent
with what a mountain lion attack looks like," Bald
win said. "They could also have been injuries from
some other source, such as barbed wire."
The first incident occurred in the early afternoon,
a rare time fora mountain lion since the animals usu
ally hunt at night.
If confirmed, these would be the first mountain
lion attacks on Stanford land in five years.
According to a Department of Public Safety bul
letin issued after the first incident, mountain lion at
tacks on people are rare, as the animals usually attack
smaller prey. People who encounter a mountain lion,
the alert said, should make themselves seem as large
as possible and fight back if attacked.
Mountain lion sightings are not uncommon in the
area, and deer are killed fairly often, Baldwin noted.
