# BS-TV slate proposes eliminating squirrels around campus

### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
According to ASSU presidential and vice presi
dential candidates Barrett Sheridan and Tam Vo,
both sophomores, the most frequent complaints
from the student body are related to dining, laundry
and the lack of dating at Stanford.
Thus, their first action as ASSU executives will be
the creation of a Stanford-based matchmaking ser
vice that, fora flat fee, also provides year-long access
to laundry services and better food.
Instead of campaigning this weekend, the BS-TV
slate was at the Coachella music festival in Southern
California. Their campaign plans include targeting
the Stanford population that also attended Coachel
la and getting the rest of the voters interested during
the remaining day before voting begins.
"I was hoping to challenge the executive slates to

a game of DDR or Twister, but since we're not hav
ing a debate and the election is so soon, my strategy
is to seduce freshmen, politely invade people's per
sonal space and promise baked goods in exchange for
votes," Vo said.
The slate does not seem to see or even want victo
ry in its horizon.
"Personally, I hope we don't win," Sheridan said.
"That would be a catastrophe, both on a personal
level and a campus-wide level. Vote for The Chappie
instead."
Sheridan and Vo expressed disappointment over
the controversy surrounding the last election.
"It could've been way more scandalous, involving
sex, lies and videotape," Vo said. "However, it was
dealt with pretty efficiently by most students who im
mediately deleted those now infamous e-mails and
promptly forgot about them within five minutes."
Sheridan expressed similar dissatisfaction with

the Lee-Schwartz "unification" slate.
"That whole thing is pretty fucked up," Sheridan
said. "I don't really understand it. They used to be op
ponents, but then they dropped their running mates
to join together? I don't know whether it's back-stab
bing or just politics. Maybe both."
When asked about what he felt was the biggest
problem facing the campus, Sheridan answered,
"The squirrels. I plan on building squirrel traps this
weekend to begin tackling the problem."
The BS-TV slate's platform contrasts sharply
with most of their opponents' platforms. For ex
ample, it has a unique outlook on the issue of di
versity on campus.
"Calls for diversity have been marginalizing the
less diverse groups on campus," Vo said. "We will
work with the administration to combine all
