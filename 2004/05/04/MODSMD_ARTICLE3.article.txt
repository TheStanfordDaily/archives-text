# BS-TV slate proposes eliminating squirrels around campus
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
According to ASSU presidential and vice presi
dential candidates Barrett Sheridan and Tam Vo,
both sophomores, the most frequent complaints
from the student body are related to dining, laundry
and the lack of dating at Stanford.
Thus, their first action as ASSU executives will be
the creation of a Stanford-based matchmaking ser
vice that, fora flat fee, also provides year-long access
to laundry services and better food.
Instead of campaigning this weekend, the BS-TV
slate was at the Coachella music festival in Southern
California. Their campaign plans include targeting
the Stanford population that also attended Coachel
la and getting the rest of the voters interested during
the remaining day before voting begins.
"I was hoping to challenge the executive slates to

a game of DDR or Twister, but since we're not hav
ing a debate and the election is so soon, my strategy
is to seduce freshmen, politely invade people's per
sonal space and promise baked goods in exchange for
votes," Vo said.
The slate does not seem to see or even want victo
ry in its horizon.
"Personally, I hope we don't win," Sheridan said.
"That would be a catastrophe, both on a personal
level and a campus-wide level. Vote for The Chappie
instead."
Sheridan and Vo expressed disappointment over
the controversy surrounding the last election.
"It could've been way more scandalous, involving
sex, lies and videotape," Vo said. "However, it was
dealt with pretty efficiently by most students who im
mediately deleted those now infamous e-mails and
promptly forgot about them within five minutes."
Sheridan expressed similar dissatisfaction with

the Lee-Schwartz "unification" slate.
"That whole thing is pretty fucked up," Sheridan
said. "I don't really understand it. They used to be op
ponents, but then they dropped their running mates
to join together? I don't know whether it's back-stab
bing or just politics. Maybe both."
When asked about what he felt was the biggest
problem facing the campus, Sheridan answered,
"The squirrels. I plan on building squirrel traps this
weekend to begin tackling the problem."
The BS-TV slate's platform contrasts sharply
with most of their opponents' platforms. For ex
ample, it has a unique outlook on the issue of di
versity on campus.
"Calls for diversity have been marginalizing the
less diverse groups on campus," Vo said. "We will
work with the administration to combine all

housed fraternities and sororities
into the CSSC (Caucasian Students
Services Center) to make room for
the ethnic, unhoused and other-in
terest Greek organizations."
BS-TV is also the only slate in
this election that is advocating a re
duction rather than an increase in
student space.
"We want to eliminate space," Vo
said. "Stanford is more fortunate than
many universities who cannot guaran
tee four years of housing. At least
we're not UCLA, where they cram
three students, their beds, their com
puters and their desks into the space
smaller than a typical freshman dou

hie. Of course, a lot of them are small
er and Asian so they compensate."
Another BS-TV initiative is to de
crease communication between the
ASSU and student body.
"We will restrict communication so
that certain individuals such as Nick
Rodriguez will not be allowed to make
unsolicited campaign announce
ments," Vosaid. "We will also cooper
ate with The Chappie to make sure
that the ASSU is not violating the Fun
damental Standard or any laws and
statutes of this institution."
The pair, also Intermission co-ed
itors at The Daily, decided to run for
ASSU executive office after coming
to the conclusion that the Intermis
sion section was neither useful or
tasteful.
Vo said, "A few hours before the
mandatory ASSU candidate meeting.

I told Barrett, 'We're running. We are
the two most completely dispensable
staff members that this publication has
and we owe it to t he few readers of In
termission and the general apathetic
public.' And with initials like BS and
TV, how much more honest can we
get?"
Sheridan's reply to Vo was, "[l'll
run] as long as I don't have to get any
signatures or do any real work."
This, according to Vo, reflects what
most presidents do.
"Don't most political decisions
arise out of boredom anyway?" Vo
said. "And with Mikey Lee and The
Chappie always visiting our office, it
seemed convenient that I would never
actually have to go to The Daily to in
terview or talk to the editorial board
since 1 live there already."
Sheridan is an economics major

from Yorba Linda, Calif., a Yu
goslavia representative for Model
UN and an intern for the Stanford
Magazine. Vo is from Downey, CA
— home to the oldest operating
and existing McDonald's and the
hometown of Weird Al. She is the
sobriety consultant and cowbell
coach for The Stanford Band, a
Ram's Head Theatrical Society pit
percussionist and tambourinist and
a pastry chef. Neither have any pre
vious criminal records.
"General student body apathy is
the most formidable challenge of this
election, and convincing people that
a special election is occurring at all is
only half the obstacle," Vo said. "If
we could only battle this out with a
game of Twister or Taboo, we could
really select the best ASSU executive
slate of all."

percussionist and tambourinist and
a pastry chef. Neither have any pre
vious criminal records.
"General student body apathy is
the most formidable challenge of this
election, and convincing people that
a special election is occurring at all is
only half the obstacle," Vo said. "If
we could only battle this out with a
game of Twister or Taboo, we could
really select the best ASSU executive
slate of all."
According to ASSU presidential and vice presi
dential candidates Barrett Sheridan and Tam Vo,
both sophomores, the most frequent complaints
from the student body are related to dining, laundry
and the lack of dating at Stanford.
Thus, their first action as ASSU executives will be
the creation of a Stanford-based matchmaking ser
vice that, fora flat fee, also provides year-long access
to laundry services and better food.
Instead of campaigning this weekend, the BS-TV
slate was at the Coachella music festival in Southern
California. Their campaign plans include targeting
the Stanford population that also attended Coachel
la and getting the rest of the voters interested during
the remaining day before voting begins.
"I was hoping to challenge the executive slates to

a game of DDR or Twister, but since we're not hav
ing a debate and the election is so soon, my strategy
is to seduce freshmen, politely invade people's per
sonal space and promise baked goods in exchange for
votes," Vo said.
The slate does not seem to see or even want victo
ry in its horizon.
"Personally, I hope we don't win," Sheridan said.
"That would be a catastrophe, both on a personal
level and a campus-wide level. Vote for The Chappie
instead."
Sheridan and Vo expressed disappointment over
the controversy surrounding the last election.
"It could've been way more scandalous, involving
sex, lies and videotape," Vo said. "However, it was
dealt with pretty efficiently by most students who im
mediately deleted those now infamous e-mails and
promptly forgot about them within five minutes."
Sheridan expressed similar dissatisfaction with

the Lee-Schwartz "unification" slate.
"That whole thing is pretty fucked up," Sheridan
said. "I don't really understand it. They used to be op
ponents, but then they dropped their running mates
to join together? I don't know whether it's back-stab
bing or just politics. Maybe both."
When asked about what he felt was the biggest
problem facing the campus, Sheridan answered,
"The squirrels. I plan on building squirrel traps this
weekend to begin tackling the problem."
The BS-TV slate's platform contrasts sharply
with most of their opponents' platforms. For ex
ample, it has a unique outlook on the issue of di
versity on campus.
"Calls for diversity have been marginalizing the
less diverse groups on campus," Vo said. "We will
work with the administration to combine all

housed fraternities and sororities
into the CSSC (Caucasian Students
Services Center) to make room for
the ethnic, unhoused and other-in
terest Greek organizations."
BS-TV is also the only slate in
this election that is advocating a re
duction rather than an increase in
student space.
"We want to eliminate space," Vo
said. "Stanford is more fortunate than
many universities who cannot guaran
tee four years of housing. At least
we're not UCLA, where they cram
three students, their beds, their com
puters and their desks into the space
smaller than a typical freshman dou

hie. Of course, a lot of them are small
er and Asian so they compensate."
Another BS-TV initiative is to de
crease communication between the
ASSU and student body.
"We will restrict communication so
that certain individuals such as Nick
Rodriguez will not be allowed to make
unsolicited campaign announce
ments," Vosaid. "We will also cooper
ate with The Chappie to make sure
that the ASSU is not violating the Fun
damental Standard or any laws and
statutes of this institution."
The pair, also Intermission co-ed
itors at The Daily, decided to run for
ASSU executive office after coming
to the conclusion that the Intermis
sion section was neither useful or
tasteful.
Vo said, "A few hours before the
mandatory ASSU candidate meeting.

I told Barrett, 'We're running. We are
the two most completely dispensable
staff members that this publication has
and we owe it to t he few readers of In
termission and the general apathetic
public.' And with initials like BS and
TV, how much more honest can we
get?"
Sheridan's reply to Vo was, "[l'll
run] as long as I don't have to get any
signatures or do any real work."
This, according to Vo, reflects what
most presidents do.
"Don't most political decisions
arise out of boredom anyway?" Vo
said. "And with Mikey Lee and The
Chappie always visiting our office, it
seemed convenient that I would never
actually have to go to The Daily to in
terview or talk to the editorial board
since 1 live there already."
Sheridan is an economics major

from Yorba Linda, Calif., a Yu
goslavia representative for Model
UN and an intern for the Stanford
Magazine. Vo is from Downey, CA
— home to the oldest operating
and existing McDonald's and the
hometown of Weird Al. She is the
