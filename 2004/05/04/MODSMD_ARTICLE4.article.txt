# Mefford's former roommate files suit over election
## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
Junior Dylan Mefford will bring a suit to the ASSU Constitu
tional Council tonight, arguing that the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate's decision not to validate last month's presidential election
results was unconstitutional because the flood of e-mails on the
eve of the election were a protected form of free speech. He is ask
ing that the initial election results be validated.
Mefford's counsel for the case will be Henry Towsner, who
graduated last year and is now studying at Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity. Towsner and Mefford are former roommates.
"The argument is that the Senate violated the ASSU Constitu
tion by overturning the election since both the content and timing
of all the e-mails sent out were protected speech, which the ASSU
isn't allowed to punish." Towsner explained.
He added, "Mefford is asking the Council to reinstate the elec
tion results since no rules were actually broken during the cam
paign, and there's nothing illegitimate about the election."
Towsner has had extensive experience with the ASSU Consti
tution, having successfully brought two cases to the ASSU Consti
tutional Council last year, one against the ASSU Elections Com
mission and the other against Viennese Ball. The verdicts affected
ASSU enforcement of flyering and the practices of organizations
applying for special fees.
Towsner also had a case brought
against him in 2002, when he was ac
cused of breaking into the ASSU elec
tions database.
All of the presidential candidates
had initially agreed to not contest the
Senate's decision to invalidate the elec
tion results. However, senior Mikey
Lee switched running mates two weeks
ago from Mefford to sophomore and
rival vice presidential candidate Alyssa
Schwartz. In response, Mefford filed his
current suit last week.
Junior Chris Lin. the newly elected
Senate chair, also revealed at last
night's Senate meeting that last week's
appointment of Monica Hcnestroza
to the ASSU Constitutional Council
was unofficial because the new Senate
was not technically in session. She was
reintroduced as a candidate and elect
ed unanimously again.
The next bill proposed the appoint
ment of a fifth Constitutional Council
member, graduate student Ying

Wong, to complete the committee.
Particularly vocal in support of this
move was Bill Curry, a third-year grad
uate student and chair of the Council.
"Having an even number of people
is never ideal," he said.
At this time, the impending Mef
ford case was revealed to the Senate,
which added relevance to Wong's ap
pointment. With only four Council
members, Mefford's chances for victo
ry are slightly diminished, as a 2-2 tie
would result in a loss for his suit.
The Mefford issue struck a chord
with several senators, and seemed to
influence some votes.
"Now that I know what's going on,
1 didn't vote for [Wong]," said fresh
man Adia Gooden.
The subsequent vote failed to
achieve the two-thirds margin neces
sary for Wong's appointment, leaving
just four Constitutional Council mem
bers for tonight's hearing.
If the Constitutional Council rules
in favor of Mefford, the crisis will like
ly deepen, as it is unclear whether the
Council alone can validate the first
presidential election or whether the
matter would go back to the Senate.
