# Mefford's former roommate files suit over election
## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
Junior Dylan Mefford will bring a suit to the ASSU Constitu
tional Council tonight, arguing that the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate's decision not to validate last month's presidential election
results was unconstitutional because the flood of e-mails on the
eve of the election were a protected form of free speech. He is ask
ing that the initial election results be validated.
Mefford's counsel for the case will be Henry Towsner, who
graduated last year and is now studying at Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity. Towsner and Mefford are former roommates.
"The argument is that the Senate violated the ASSU Constitu
tion by overturning the election since both the content and timing
of all the e-mails sent out were protected speech, which the ASSU
isn't allowed to punish." Towsner explained.
He added, "Mefford is asking the Council to reinstate the elec
tion results since no rules were actually broken during the cam
paign, and there's nothing illegitimate about the election."
Towsner has had extensive experience with the ASSU Consti
tution, having successfully brought two cases to the ASSU Consti
tutional Council last year, one against the ASSU Elections Com
mission and the other against Viennese Ball. The verdicts affected
ASSU enforcement of flyering and the practices of organizations
applying for special fees.
