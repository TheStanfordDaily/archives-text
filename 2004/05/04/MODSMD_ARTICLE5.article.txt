### JENNIE KIM STAFF WRITER 
California State Controller Steve Westly dis
cussed the controversial California recall and em
phasized the importance bi-partisanship in an
event sponsored by the Stanford Democrats enti
tled "Fixing California Politics." Westly, a Stan
ford alumnus and former faculty member, is con
sidered to be one of the leading Democrats vying
for candidacy in the 2006 gubernatorial race.
Westly drew attention to the historical significance
of the state's "circus-like recall," calling it "truly ex
traordinary" and unlikely to ever happen again.
"It's not often you get someone who has coin
cidentally been a nine-time Mr. Universe, and the
largest box office-grossing movie star in the
world, and the head of the world's fifth-largest
economy all together," he remarked, eliciting
laughter from the crowd.
Originally from Menlo Park, Westly earned
both his bachelor's and business degrees at Stan
ford and then spent five years teaching public
management at the Graduate School of Business
before earning a fortune as the senior vice presi
dent of e√üay.
Yet his ties to the University remain strong.
"I am the ultimate Stanford person," Westly
said. "I put up with the food at Lagunita for 19

years," he joked, referring to his previous tenure
as Lagunita's academic advisor.
Additionally, Westly praised the efforts of
Stanford students in his past campaigns and ex
pressed the desire to "recruit more of you to come
on board."
Westly added, "I urge you to think about going
into public service as a career. The potential to
change the world is huge, and the world is crying
out for people with your kind of intellect."
Kai Stinchcombe, a first year graduate student
in political science and president of the Stanford
Democrats, discussed his group's working rela
tionship with Westly.
"We run all of his campaigns; we staff his of
fice," Stinchcombe said. "He knows how to work
with us and what we're worth."
Toward the end of his speech, Westly criticized
the contentious nature of partisanship when he
spoke about his decision to work with Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger to pass Propositions 57 and 58,
California's Economic Recovery Bond Act and
Balanced Budget Act, respectively. The paired ini
tiative eventually passed by 24 points last March,
but the partnership drew ire from party stalwarts.
"I was not about to let the state of California run out
of money over petty partisan bickering," he said.
