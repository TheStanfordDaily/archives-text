# Hennessy kicks off API month
## 
### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
Asian Pacific Islander (API) Heritage Month of
ficially began with a luncheon yesterday. API Her
itage Month is a nationwide celebration and recog
nition of Asian American issues, culture and histo
ry. The month will be celebrated on campus with 25
events organized and funded by a number of on-

campus Asian Pacific Islander organizations.
"API Heritage Month is an opportunity for the
community to come together and to not only display
diversity but also come together on Asian American

issues and to explore what it means to be Asian
American," said junior Howard Chiou, amemberof
the API Heritage Month Organizing Committee
and an ethnic theme associate (ETA) in Okada.
API Heritage Month began as a week declared
nationally by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. In
1990, President George H. W. Bush extended the
event to a month. Director of the Asian American
Activities Center Richard Yuen said that the event
has been celebrated at Stanford ever since its na
tional inception.
The types of events range widely, from artistic
performances to lectures to social events. The fo
cuses of the events are also diverse, emphasizing
Asian American history and culture as well as cur
rent issues. Yuen, who is also an assistant dean of
students, said this year's program offerings are
"extremely vibrant and diverse."
"If you look at the calendar, the events on it are
really from all over, which I feel reflects the diver
sity of the Asian American diaspora," Chiou said.
He noted the sheer quantity of groups participat
ing this year, reflecting a growing number of active
API groups on campus. Three years ago. API Her
itage Month had only one-fourth the number of
the events being held this year. Yuen added that
the API community on campus has changed con
siderably from only six student API organizations
when he first came to the University in 1989 to
close to 40 organizations today.
However. Chiou said that this variety is also a
weak point of the month.
"This year, our month is all over the place,"
Chiou said. "It's huge, but it doesn't leave as much
of a resonance on campus as we would like it to."
Chiou said that in the future the month should
have an organizing principle so it will be a better
vehicle to explore issues and to build unity within
the community.
Yuen said that while API Heritage Month is usu
ally placed in the category of the three "F"s —
food, faces and fun — organizers are trying to add
' advocacy to the events.
"One thing we can plan for future API Heritage
Months is making the theme more than a celebrato
ry one by having more discussions and taking stock
in what direction the API community on campus is
going," Yuen said, adding that currently advocacy

underlies many of the events.
Specifically, he said API issues on campus in
clude more API curricular studies, increased Asian
American faculty diversity and greater focus on
South Asian studies.
This was the first year there was a kickoff
lunch for API Heritage Month, which Chiou said
he was part of the effort to make the month more
centralized.
"With the lunch, we are trying to increase visibil
ity and move from a bunch of events that happen to
be during API Heritage Month to an entire API her
itage month celebration," said senior Julius
Panoringan, a member of the API Heritage Month
committee and an ETA in Okada.
Yuen and President John Hennessy spoke at
the lunch, attended by close to 150 students, fac
ulty, staff and other community members. It was
organized by the Asian American Activities Cen
ter, Asian Staff Forum and the API Heritage
Month Committee.
At the luncheon, Hennessy emphasized Asian
Americans have always been part of the Stanford
community, as students and staff from the open
ing of the university and as faculty beginning in
the early 1900's.
Hennessy said student as well as international in
terest in Asia and Asian studies is growing. He high
lighted how global awareness has changed since he
was younger. When he was entering college, he had
only been to Canada, while now most students have
been to Europe but not Asia and Africa.
"The world has become a global village," he
said. "Our real question is how we will prepare
people to operate in that global village, how to
appreciate different cultures and also be at home
in those environments."
Hennessy said that Stanford has made a commit
ment to a stronger program and conversations have
started about a possible overseas campus in India.
Yuen said the lunch was exciting because it is rare for
faculty, staff and students to coordinate an event to
gether. It also was an example of how cultural celebra
tion could have undertones of advocacy, as Hennessy
was addressing some key areas of concern.
"These types of interaction, however brief, are
critical in planting seeds for development in the fu
ture," he said.

community, as students and staff from the open
ing of the university and as faculty beginning in
the early 1900's.
Hennessy said student as well as international in
terest in Asia and Asian studies is growing. He high
lighted how global awareness has changed since he
was younger. When he was entering college, he had
only been to Canada, while now most students have
been to Europe but not Asia and Africa.
"The world has become a global village," he
said. "Our real question is how we will prepare
people to operate in that global village, how to
appreciate different cultures and also be at home
in those environments."
Hennessy said that Stanford has made a commit
ment to a stronger program and conversations have
started about a possible overseas campus in India.
Yuen said the lunch was exciting because it is rare for
faculty, staff and students to coordinate an event to
gether. It also was an example of how cultural celebra
tion could have undertones of advocacy, as Hennessy
was addressing some key areas of concern.
"These types of interaction, however brief, are
critical in planting seeds for development in the fu
ture," he said.

Asian Pacific Islander (API) Heritage Month of
ficially began with a luncheon yesterday. API Her
itage Month is a nationwide celebration and recog
nition of Asian American issues, culture and histo
ry. The month will be celebrated on campus with 25
events organized and funded by a number of on-

campus Asian Pacific Islander organizations.
"API Heritage Month is an opportunity for the
community to come together and to not only display
diversity but also come together on Asian American

issues and to explore what it means to be Asian
American," said junior Howard Chiou, amemberof
the API Heritage Month Organizing Committee
and an ethnic theme associate (ETA) in Okada.
API Heritage Month began as a week declared
nationally by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. In
1990, President George H. W. Bush extended the
event to a month. Director of the Asian American
Activities Center Richard Yuen said that the event
has been celebrated at Stanford ever since its na
tional inception.
The types of events range widely, from artistic
performances to lectures to social events. The fo
cuses of the events are also diverse, emphasizing
Asian American history and culture as well as cur
rent issues. Yuen, who is also an assistant dean of
students, said this year's program offerings are
"extremely vibrant and diverse."
"If you look at the calendar, the events on it are
really from all over, which I feel reflects the diver
sity of the Asian American diaspora," Chiou said.
He noted the sheer quantity of groups participat
ing this year, reflecting a growing number of active
API groups on campus. Three years ago. API Her
itage Month had only one-fourth the number of
the events being held this year. Yuen added that
the API community on campus has changed con
siderably from only six student API organizations
when he first came to the University in 1989 to
close to 40 organizations today.
However. Chiou said that this variety is also a
weak point of the month.
"This year, our month is all over the place,"
Chiou said. "It's huge, but it doesn't leave as much
of a resonance on campus as we would like it to."
Chiou said that in the future the month should
have an organizing principle so it will be a better
vehicle to explore issues and to build unity within
the community.
Yuen said that while API Heritage Month is usu
ally placed in the category of the three "F"s —
food, faces and fun — organizers are trying to add
' advocacy to the events.
"One thing we can plan for future API Heritage
Months is making the theme more than a celebrato
ry one by having more discussions and taking stock
in what direction the API community on campus is
going," Yuen said, adding that currently advocacy

underlies many of the events.
Specifically, he said API issues on campus in
clude more API curricular studies, increased Asian
American faculty diversity and greater focus on
South Asian studies.
This was the first year there was a kickoff
lunch for API Heritage Month, which Chiou said
he was part of the effort to make the month more
centralized.
"With the lunch, we are trying to increase visibil
ity and move from a bunch of events that happen to
be during API Heritage Month to an entire API her
itage month celebration," said senior Julius
Panoringan, a member of the API Heritage Month
committee and an ETA in Okada.
Yuen and President John Hennessy spoke at
the lunch, attended by close to 150 students, fac
ulty, staff and other community members. It was
organized by the Asian American Activities Cen
ter, Asian Staff Forum and the API Heritage
Month Committee.
At the luncheon, Hennessy emphasized Asian
Americans have always been part of the Stanford
community, as students and staff from the open
ing of the university and as faculty beginning in
