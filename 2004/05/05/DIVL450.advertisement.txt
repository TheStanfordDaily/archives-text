The Office for Religious Life presents:
What Matters to Me and Why
Diane Middlebrook
Professor of English, Emerita
Wednesday, May 5th
12:00-1:00 P.M.
Side Chapel in Memorial Church.
Please feel free to bring your lunch.
Middlebrook became Professor of English, Emerita, in 2002. She taught
courses in poetry and poetics, Feminist Studies, Continuing Studies, and
Introduction to the Humanities. She is currently developing a new program with
the Alumni Association: the Stanford Book Salon, a virtual book group and
online threaded discussion. Her most recent book is HER HUSBAND: Hughes
& Plath, a Marriage, a biography of the creative partnership of Ted Hughes and
Sylvia Plath, published in October 2003. Her previously-published books
include Suits Me, the story of Billy Tipton, a female jazz musician who lived as a
man for fifty years, and Anne Sexton, a Biography, a book about the American
poet who was a friend of Sylvia Plath. Her next book will be a biography of the
Roman poet Ovid.
What Matters to Me and Why is a discussion and lecture series that encourages reflection
within the Stanford community on matters of personal values, beliefs, and motivations in
order to better understand the lives and inspirations of those who shape the University.
All are welcome.
