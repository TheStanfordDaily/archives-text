The Sacred and the Ordinary:
Stanford Staff Book Discussion
Things Seen and Unseen,
A Year Lived in Faith
by Nora Gallagher
Thursday, May 6. Noon - 1 p.m.
The Round Room, behind Memorial Church
Join us as we meet to explore the "sacred and the ordinary" for an inaugural
book discussion of Nora Gallagher's hook that draws upon a world of jour
neys and mysteries. Gallagher uses the events of a year in the life of one
particular religious community and her own spiritual journey to reflect on
faith and its meaning, uncertainty and suffering, grace, commitment, and
community.
All Stanford Staff are welcome. Please feel free to bring your lunch.
Book available at Stanford Bookstore.
Note: Ms. Gallagher will also be at Stanford as the preacher for an Episcopal-
Lutheran Ascension service in Memorial Church on May 20 at 7:30 p.m.
