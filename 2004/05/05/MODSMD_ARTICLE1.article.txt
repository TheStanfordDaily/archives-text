# Labor committee's efficacy questioned
## 
### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It has been a year since the Pres
ident's Advisory Committee on
Labor Practices was formed, and
although the committee has been
busy collecting data, some students
say they are frustrated that it has
not begun to effectively address
the issues surrounding low-wage
labor at Stanford.
The Committee was initially es
tablished last May. after six stu
dents fasted fora week as part of
the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion's (SLAC) two-year campaign
to establish a Code of Conduct for
labor practices at Stanford.
"From SLAC's perspective, the
formation of the committee was a
major victory because it represent
ed the first time that the Stanford
administration agreed to formu
late labor policy with the input of
both students and workers," said
SLAC representative Molly Gold
berg, a junior. "Up to that point,
President Hennessy had refused to

meet with workers present."
The temporary committee was
established to research and advise
the President's Office and Office
of Human Resources on campus
labor guidelines. Although the
committee was scheduled to con
vene in September of last year, it
did not actually meet until January
of this year.
The committee consists of
University employees, faculty
and three students selected by
President John Hennessy. The
committee chairs are Economics
Prof. John Pencavel and Human
Resources Executive Director
Diane Peck.
Among the committee's areas
of focus are the living-wage policy
and affordable benefits; the use of
subcontracting, educational and
training opportunities for workers;
and the right to organize.
Committee members said
they are gathering information
and data on current labor prac
periods of repression under Pinochet.
"Workers were seeing the dis
mantling of their rights, including
the ability to engage in collective
bargaining, to strike, to join federa
tions, or to have a reliable financial
base," said Birns in a Sept. 1998
press release for the Institute for
Public Accuracy.
Freshman Celen Zepeda said
that Pencavel's appointment to the
commission was ironic given his
previous role.
"It makes you question whether
Pencavel will fulfill his duty as the
chair of a committee to working to
ward workers' rights," she said.
As United Stanford Workers
President Zev Kivitky, a member of
the committee, pointed out, the
committee must overcome limited
time, decentralization and bud
getary constraints in order to
achieve its goals.
"The time required to digest the
volume of information we're gath
ering is quite large and the infor
mation is highly decentralized,
which makes the gathering a time
consuming and difficult process,"
said Kivitky.
"Any recommendations must
also be consistent with the Universi
ty's existing operating budget,
which may pose a significant chal
lenge," he added.
Nevertheless. Kivitky said he
remains hopeful that the com
mittee will be able to instigate
positive change.
"1 hope that as a member of the
committee, 1 can help formulate
policies that will make Stanford a
better place to work for all who
give their labor to Stanford,
whether or not they are direct em
ployees," he said.
The committee is currently solic

"We are implementing a survey
of University employees to under
stand their conditions, wants and
needs," said committee member
Oliver Kaplan, a doctoral student in
political science.
"We are also compiling infor
mation from University records
and are looking into collecting in
formation on the use of contracted
workers," he said.
However, SLAC members said
they are frustrated by the fact that
the committee has not released
any of the employment data it has
collected and has not held a town
hall meeting to receive communi
ty input.
SLAC members noted that no
low-wage worker — which they de
fine as someone who earns less than
the recommended living wage — ac
tually sits on the committee.
Pencavel, on the other hand, said
that the committee has sought the
opinion of workers, students and ad
ministrators, and that it has heard pre
sentations from several people who
have been able to provide insight into
policies regarding the concerns of
low-wage workers at Stanford.
He also said that the committee's
primary purpose is "an informative
one — providing the Stanford com
munity with systematic information
about Stanford as an employer."
Also problematic to some stu
dents is the fact that Prof. Pencavel
served as chief advisor to Chile's
Labor Minister under the dictator
Agusto Pinochet.

public affairs officer for the United
Nations Economic Commission for
Latin America, the trade union

"We are implementing a survey

Oliver Kaplan, a doctoral student in

However, SLAC members said
they are frustrated by the fact that
the committee has not released
any of the employment data it has
collected and has not held a town
hall meeting to receive communi
ty input.
SLAC members noted that no
low-wage worker — which they de
fine as someone who earns less than
the recommended living wage — ac
tually sits on the committee.
Pencavel, on the other hand, said
that the committee has sought the
opinion of workers, students and ad
ministrators, and that it has heard pre
sentations from several people who
have been able to provide insight into
policies regarding the concerns of
low-wage workers at Stanford.
He also said that the committee's
primary purpose is "an informative
one — providing the Stanford com
munity with systematic information
about Stanford as an employer."
Also problematic to some stu

served as chief advisor to Chile's
Labor Minister under the dictator
Agusto Pinochet.

It has been a year since the Pres
ident's Advisory Committee on
Labor Practices was formed, and
although the committee has been
busy collecting data, some students
say they are frustrated that it has
not begun to effectively address
the issues surrounding low-wage
labor at Stanford.
The Committee was initially es
tablished last May. after six stu
dents fasted fora week as part of
the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion's (SLAC) two-year campaign
to establish a Code of Conduct for
labor practices at Stanford.
"From SLAC's perspective, the
formation of the committee was a
major victory because it represent
ed the first time that the Stanford
administration agreed to formu
late labor policy with the input of
both students and workers," said
SLAC representative Molly Gold
berg, a junior. "Up to that point,
President Hennessy had refused to

meet with workers present."
The temporary committee was
established to research and advise
the President's Office and Office
of Human Resources on campus
labor guidelines. Although the
committee was scheduled to con
vene in September of last year, it
did not actually meet until January
of this year.
The committee consists of
University employees, faculty
and three students selected by
President John Hennessy. The
committee chairs are Economics
Prof. John Pencavel and Human
Resources Executive Director
Diane Peck.
Among the committee's areas
of focus are the living-wage policy
and affordable benefits; the use of
subcontracting, educational and
training opportunities for workers;
and the right to organize.
Committee members said
they are gathering information
and data on current labor prac
periods of repression under Pinochet.
"Workers were seeing the dis
mantling of their rights, including
the ability to engage in collective
bargaining, to strike, to join federa
tions, or to have a reliable financial
base," said Birns in a Sept. 1998
press release for the Institute for
Public Accuracy.
Freshman Celen Zepeda said
that Pencavel's appointment to the
commission was ironic given his
previous role.
"It makes you question whether
Pencavel will fulfill his duty as the
chair of a committee to working to
ward workers' rights," she said.
As United Stanford Workers
President Zev Kivitky, a member of
the committee, pointed out, the
committee must overcome limited
time, decentralization and bud
getary constraints in order to
achieve its goals.
"The time required to digest the
volume of information we're gath
ering is quite large and the infor
mation is highly decentralized,
which makes the gathering a time
consuming and difficult process,"
said Kivitky.
"Any recommendations must
also be consistent with the Universi
ty's existing operating budget,
which may pose a significant chal
lenge," he added.
