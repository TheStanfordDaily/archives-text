Spinning the bottle — on reliving our youth

Remember all those fun games we played as
kids? Monopoly. Candy Land. Hungry Hungry
Hippos. Well, some of us remember those good
times all too clearly, as we recall the events of
the past week. Before we get into details, we would like
to apologize to anyone unfortunate enough to have been
within a 100-foot radius of our drawmates as we redis
covered the joy (and racket) that four plastic marble-eat
ing hippopotamuses could provide. Of course we felt the
need to put a little collegiate twist on the game and trans
form it into yet another excuse to consume large
amounts of alcohol. The rules were simple: Take the
number of marbles your hippo consumes and divide it by
two, then make your opponents take that many drinks.
Not quite what Milton Bradley had envisioned, but a
good time was definitely had by all. Thirsty Thirsty Hip
pos proved to be just what we were looking fora —a

fierce battle of strategy
and strength where every
one was a winner in the
end (although some peo
ple's livers didn't agree).
Drinking games aside,
the point is that we were
wildly and rapturously en
tertained by a toy intend
ed for three to six year
olds. Before you roll your
eyes and decide that we're

retarded, we challenge you to put your marbles where
your (hippo's) mouth is and try it. If you can't get your
hands on this pricey $20 indulgence, thrift stores along El
Camino readily sell used board games like Candy Land,
Chutes & Ladders and Operation for just a few bucks.
Come on — when was the last time you played Doctor?
In an effort to become more adult and less like cer
tain columnists, our sorority sister Mandi was preparing
for questions she might be asked in an upcoming job in
terview by listing her strengths and weaknesses. Peering
over her shoulder 1 immediately thought what any ratio
nal preteen girl would think — let's play Slam! For those
of you who never underwent the intense pleasure and
subsequent emotional scarring that comprise this slum
ber party favorite, the basic idea is to take turns leaving
the room while your best friends discuss and anony
mously compile a written list of your bad qualities in ex
cruciating detail. At the end, each girl (boys are not
stupid or creative enough to play this game) reads her
list, inevitably bursts into tears and calls her mother to
come pick her up. Good times. To the credit of mean
girls everywhere, little Shirley Hendrickson's table man
ners did improve markedly after this incident, and we
hope she is very happy in Canada, where she moved
shortly thereafter. (True story. Piano Texas, 1994).
Luckily, Mandi was quick to point out that playing
Slam now would be a lost cause, since all college-age girls
tend to have the same two bad qualities — being slutty
and high-maintenance. Oh, and not to mention we are
far too mature for such cattiness toward our bosom bud
dies — nowadays when we want to "mix things up" we
just block people on instant messenger or go to third
base with each other's boyfriends.
Well, maybe it's kind of nice to be past seventh grade.
But just because we're in college doesn't mean we have
to start taking ourselves so seriously. All too often we get
caught up in finishing papers and problem sets, in choos
ing the right major and the impressive summer job.
Along the way we lose sight of the simpler things that life
has to offer — the small triumphs that only a child could
fully appreciate. And only a college kid could drink to.
While we can't regain our youthful innocence, we can
certainly revel in the fact that we are at a glorious point
in our lives where we still find time to act like idiots and
enjoy the company of other high-quality idiots. Even
though our beloved friends are not above eating our
marbles or awarding themselves URO grants from the
Monopoly bank, when it comes down to it we know
they're always here to help us find our way out of Lol
lipop Woods or pull us out of Molasses Swamp.

ners did improve markedly after this incident, and we
hope she is very happy in Canada, where she moved
shortly thereafter. (True story. Piano Texas, 1994).
Luckily, Mandi was quick to point out that playing
Slam now would be a lost cause, since all college-age girls
tend to have the same two bad qualities — being slutty
and high-maintenance. Oh, and not to mention we are
far too mature for such cattiness toward our bosom bud
dies — nowadays when we want to "mix things up" we
just block people on instant messenger or go to third
base with each other's boyfriends.
Well, maybe it's kind of nice to be past seventh grade.
But just because we're in college doesn't mean we have
to start taking ourselves so seriously. All too often we get
caught up in finishing papers and problem sets, in choos
ing the right major and the impressive summer job.
Along the way we lose sight of the simpler things that life
has to offer — the small triumphs that only a child could
fully appreciate. And only a college kid could drink to.
While we can't regain our youthful innocence, we can
certainly revel in the fact that we are at a glorious point
in our lives where we still find time to act like idiots and
enjoy the company of other high-quality idiots. Even
though our beloved friends are not above eating our
marbles or awarding themselves URO grants from the
Monopoly bank, when it comes down to it we know
they're always here to help us find our way out of Lol
lipop Woods or pull us out of Molasses Swamp.

If you'd like to Slam Alia and Lizzie or join them for an
innocent game of strip scrabble, e-mail them at
allag@stanford.edu and Epstein@stanford.edu.
