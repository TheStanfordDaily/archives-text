# Getting sloshy spring quarter
## Not your average kick ball game 
### MICHAEL DUCA 
"For me, sloshball is the smell of
beer and grass and being hungover at
6 p.m.," said graduate student — and
sloshball enthusiast — Jing Cai.
"It is an idealized metaphor for life.
Sloshball is a journey, not a destina
tion," Cai said.
If you are still unconvinced, just ask
one of the countless sloshball athletes
— sloshletes — around Stanford.

Better yet, participate in a game.
"A game like sloshball is what
makes this campus a great place,"

said senior Tom Feliz.
Sports stars Josh Childress
and Ogonna Nnamani may

garner accolades for their
athletic prowess, but basket
ball and volleyball merely de-

mand speed, hand-eye coordi
nation, quick reflexes, clever
ness, physical strength and the

ability to jump three feet in the
air from a stand-still position.
Sloshletes possess all of these

skills and more. To win there-

spect of their teammates and fans,
players must chug, swig, guzzle

slurp and slosh with the same rapid
ity it takes the Stanford Alumni As
sociation to begin soliciting dona-

tions from graduating seniors.
Most simply, sloshball combines the
rules of kickball with a keg (or two) of
beer. Teams gather on a grassy field and
alternate as kickers and fielders. Players
score points by kicking the ball into the
field and running around the four bases,
arranged in a diamond pattern. Fielders
try to stop the runners from scoring
points by tagging or pegging runners
with the ball as they run between bases.
Good, old-fashioned beer is what
makes sloshball unique. A keg sits at
second base, and usually another is at
home base. Players must, at all times,
hold a cupful of beer in their hand —
whether kicking, fielding or standing
at the sidelines — and the rules of play
ensure that players continuously
drink. When kickers approach home
plate, their beers must be filled. If run
ners make it as far as second base, they
must guzzle their current beer and re
fill before moving on. (An alternate
rule requires runners to drink their en
tire beer before reaching second base,
which brings to the game a complicat
ed drink-and-run element).
Contested plays are settled in a
"challenge," also known as a "chug
off" or "boat race." All parties in
volved in the dispute congregate at

second base and the first party to fin
ish their beer gets the call.
Sloshball combines the social ele
ment of drinking a brewski with

your buddies and the compet
itive element of kicking their
asses. The blood, sweat and
tears of traditional sports

unite on the sloshball

field with

laugh

ter

an d
fun.

"Sloshball is a

sport where kids

of all ages can cele-

brate the joining of two of the great
est activities of all time: drinking and
heckling others to drink," senior Alec
Sheehy said.
This enthusiastic description,
though, does not convey the athleti
cism required to be a good sloshlete.
"Precision, strategy, defense, coor
dination and being able to handle your

alcohol are all important factors in the
game. It definitely is a game of more
strategy that it appears," Feliz said.
Stories from the field punctuate

Feliz's point. He describes a play he

observed earlier this year, in

which a female runner had round-

Ed third base and, as she was

about to reach home base.

the catcher re-

ceived

th e

ball

She re-

alized her

sudden vul-

nerability,

and reacted by

throwing her cup of beer
into the catcher's eyes, which enabled
her to complete the run.
"1 don't know how legitimate that
[kind of play] is, but it seemed to
work," Feliz said.
Getting beer in your eyes is not the
only danger sloshball poses. As players
chug beers, their coordination and bal

ance become ever more challenged.
They must avoid tripping while run
ning drunkenly between bases or get
ting knocked in the head by a stray ball.
Even when game play ends, the danger
still lurks. Senior Doug McCune
learned this the hard way when, riding
back from a sloshball game two weeks
ago, the front wheel of his bike fell off.
He landed on the sidewalk and sus
tained facial lacerations and bruises.
"I knew the wheel wasn't securely
attached when I got on, but I thought I
could fix it when I got home," Mc-

Cune said.

Sloshball has dangers, but
players also report curative ef
fects. Junior Natalie Sanderson
recounted the time when she
suffered from a painful
headache, and her roommates
dragged her, against her will to
play a game of sloshball.
"As I got more and more into

the game and began getting com
petitive with the other team, I had
quickly forgotten about the mon-

strous headache I was suffering
from, and was having the time of my

life. Sloshball cured one of the worst
hangovers I have ever had," Sander
son said.

The presence of alcohol com
plicates the process of arranging offi
cial sloshball events on campus, given
the possibility that underage drinkers
could participate. Fraternities, for ex
ample, often sponsor "kickball" events
but rely on others to bring the kegs.
Varsity sports teams, likewise, arrange
such unofficial events for bonding pur
poses but do not involve their coaches
or the Athletic Department.
Despite such hurdles, the sport
claims a diverse following of partici
pants. Fraternities, row houses and cam
pus cooperatives regularly organize
weekend sloshball events. Varsity, club
and intramural teams break from their
typical sober routines for afternoons of
team bonding with sloshball. There is
even a 40-person mailing list, slosh
ball@lists.stanford.edu, which connects
Stanford's most devoted sloshletes with
a forum to share stories, plan events, and
"organize Ernie's runs."
Sadly, there are surely some slosh
ball memories you will never hear
about. Admits Sheehy, "Some of the
best stories may be lost forever due to
the memory impairment frequently
associated with the game."
More eloquently, senior sloshlete
Arihant Jain commented, "So sloshed.
Such a big ball."

beer and grass and being hungover at

Sadly, there are surely some slosh
ball memories you will never hear
about. Admits Sheehy, "Some of the
best stories may be lost forever due to
the memory impairment frequently
associated with the game."
More eloquently, senior sloshlete
Arihant Jain commented, "So sloshed.
Such a big ball."

"For me, sloshball is the smell of
beer and grass and being hungover at
6 p.m.," said graduate student — and
sloshball enthusiast — Jing Cai.
"It is an idealized metaphor for life.
Sloshball is a journey, not a destina
tion," Cai said.
If you are still unconvinced, just ask
one of the countless sloshball athletes
— sloshletes — around Stanford.

Better yet, participate in a game.
"A game like sloshball is what
makes this campus a great place,"

said senior Tom Feliz.
Sports stars Josh Childress
and Ogonna Nnamani may

garner accolades for their
athletic prowess, but basket
ball and volleyball merely de-

mand speed, hand-eye coordi
nation, quick reflexes, clever
ness, physical strength and the

ability to jump three feet in the
air from a stand-still position.
Sloshletes possess all of these

skills and more. To win there-

spect of their teammates and fans,
players must chug, swig, guzzle

slurp and slosh with the same rapid
ity it takes the Stanford Alumni As
sociation to begin soliciting dona-

tions from graduating seniors.
Most simply, sloshball combines the
rules of kickball with a keg (or two) of
beer. Teams gather on a grassy field and
alternate as kickers and fielders. Players
score points by kicking the ball into the
field and running around the four bases,
arranged in a diamond pattern. Fielders
try to stop the runners from scoring
points by tagging or pegging runners
with the ball as they run between bases.
Good, old-fashioned beer is what
makes sloshball unique. A keg sits at
second base, and usually another is at
home base. Players must, at all times,
hold a cupful of beer in their hand —
whether kicking, fielding or standing
at the sidelines — and the rules of play
ensure that players continuously
drink. When kickers approach home
plate, their beers must be filled. If run
ners make it as far as second base, they
must guzzle their current beer and re
fill before moving on. (An alternate
rule requires runners to drink their en
tire beer before reaching second base,
which brings to the game a complicat
ed drink-and-run element).
Contested plays are settled in a
"challenge," also known as a "chug
off" or "boat race." All parties in
volved in the dispute congregate at

second base and the first party to fin
ish their beer gets the call.
Sloshball combines the social ele
ment of drinking a brewski with

your buddies and the compet
itive element of kicking their
asses. The blood, sweat and
tears of traditional sports

unite on the sloshball

field with

laugh

ter

an d
fun.

"Sloshball is a

sport where kids

of all ages can cele-

brate the joining of two of the great
est activities of all time: drinking and
heckling others to drink," senior Alec
Sheehy said.
This enthusiastic description,
though, does not convey the athleti
cism required to be a good sloshlete.
"Precision, strategy, defense, coor
dination and being able to handle your

alcohol are all important factors in the
game. It definitely is a game of more
strategy that it appears," Feliz said.
Stories from the field punctuate

Feliz's point. He describes a play he

observed earlier this year, in

which a female runner had round-

Ed third base and, as she was

about to reach home base.

the catcher re-

ceived

th e

ball

She re-

alized her

sudden vul-

nerability,

and reacted by

throwing her cup of beer
into the catcher's eyes, which enabled
her to complete the run.
"1 don't know how legitimate that
[kind of play] is, but it seemed to
work," Feliz said.
Getting beer in your eyes is not the
only danger sloshball poses. As players
chug beers, their coordination and bal

ance become ever more challenged.
They must avoid tripping while run
ning drunkenly between bases or get
ting knocked in the head by a stray ball.
Even when game play ends, the danger
still lurks. Senior Doug McCune
learned this the hard way when, riding
back from a sloshball game two weeks
ago, the front wheel of his bike fell off.
He landed on the sidewalk and sus
tained facial lacerations and bruises.
"I knew the wheel wasn't securely
attached when I got on, but I thought I
could fix it when I got home," Mc-

Cune said.

Sloshball has dangers, but
players also report curative ef
fects. Junior Natalie Sanderson
recounted the time when she
suffered from a painful
headache, and her roommates
dragged her, against her will to
play a game of sloshball.
"As I got more and more into

the game and began getting com
petitive with the other team, I had
quickly forgotten about the mon-

strous headache I was suffering
from, and was having the time of my

life. Sloshball cured one of the worst
hangovers I have ever had," Sander
son said.

The presence of alcohol com
plicates the process of arranging offi
cial sloshball events on campus, given
the possibility that underage drinkers
could participate. Fraternities, for ex
ample, often sponsor "kickball" events
but rely on others to bring the kegs.
Varsity sports teams, likewise, arrange
such unofficial events for bonding pur
poses but do not involve their coaches
or the Athletic Department.
Despite such hurdles, the sport
claims a diverse following of partici
pants. Fraternities, row houses and cam
pus cooperatives regularly organize
weekend sloshball events. Varsity, club
and intramural teams break from their
typical sober routines for afternoons of
team bonding with sloshball. There is
even a 40-person mailing list, slosh
ball@lists.stanford.edu, which connects
Stanford's most devoted sloshletes with
a forum to share stories, plan events, and
"organize Ernie's runs."
