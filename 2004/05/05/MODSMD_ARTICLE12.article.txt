# Eat, drink and be merry
## Midafternoon at the Oasis ... and Zott's 
### 
Now if someone told you to dress fora garden
party, you would think (as a proper prep
should) a breezy summer dress (for girls) or a
pastel polo shirt paired with khakis (for guys).
Simple, right?
What if I told you the requisite attire was frayed
jeans. Rainbow sandals and that stained Old Navy shirt
you found in the bottom of your closet when laundry
was about a week overdue. (Damn quarters. Why do

you gotta be like that?)
What kind of garden party is this?
It's the West Coast kind, baby. It's a
beer garden party.
At first, I was skeptical about this
unusual idea. First, the image of but
lers serving pristine bottles of Corona
came to mind. Or perhaps, a lovely
backyard with trees sprouting pitchers
of Samuel Adams. Neither of these,
unfortunately, is true.
What you do find, at least in Palo

Alto, are two popular hangouts —
Oasis and Zott's. Lush landscapes are exchanged fora
dusty interior, hors d'oeuvres fora burger and fries and
a mimosa fora 40-ounce bottle of — you guessed it —
beer. Now while I feel like everyone has at least heard of
the Oasis (sports bar, good pizza, nice patio, big screen
TVs, pitchers ...), not many have heard of Zott's.
This little hole-in-the-wall is probably best described
as a sports bar. With a narrow interior, and an even nar

rower patio area, the place is equipped with plenty of
big-screen televisions, perfect for watching the games
on a Saturday afternoon. The best part about Oasis is in
deed the small patio area — there are enough picnic ta
bles to go with a group of friends, yet the space is small
enough to forge a camaraderie with your fellow viewers.
Or at least close enough so you can reach over to steal
some of the leftover cheese on their pizza tray.
You really don't go to the Oasis for the food, but it's
pretty good once you are there. The pizza takes about 20
minutes to make, so don't order it if you are in a hurry.
But it's so good and cheesy that it's worth the wait. I se
riously have never seen so much cheese on one pizza in
my life. 1 have never ordered the hamburgers, but peo
ple say they are delicious. And the same, apparently, for
the chef salad (which pairs perfectly with that 10-carb
beer. Delish). But the food is an afterthought.
The picnic tables are always a subject of great fasci
nation once you arrive, because over the years people
have carved their names, pictures, Greek symbols (works
for frats, sororities and math majors) or anything and ev
erything into the wooden slab that is your dining surface.
I wouldn't suggest eating inside — it can get a little
biker-ish. or it can get the middle-age sports fanatics sit
ting at the veneered bar. pounding for another round.
Outside, on the other hand, is the place to be for good
drinks and good friends.
Now, welcome to Zott's (short for Rozzotti's). which
is now strangely called the Alpine Inn. Although this
dive bar is only about a seven-minute drive from cam

pus, once there, it seems as if you have left civilization.
I would never know this place existed, if it weren't
for the senior living next to me who kept talking about
how Zottie's was such a Stanford tradition that just died
out; that it needs to be brought back to life; that old
alums would be shocked to hear that no one went any
more. So while Zott's was first introduced to my mind
in the fall, it took me two quarters to eventually get my
self over there.
Well it's my mission today to bring back the glory of
this institution known as Zott's (or Zottie's). The youth
of Stanford today need to continue on the tradition that
their ancestors have created and frequented oh-so-often.
Zott's is the funniest, most interesting mix of frat
guys, football players, bikers (both Harley riders and cy
clists) and little children running around with dirt under
their eyes and dirty hair while their parents sit drinking
40-ounce bottles of Coors Light. Again, this is another
place where the outside area makes the experience. The
patio is huge, but instead of the Oasis's paved floor, Zot
ties' tables are just on the dirt — the dust billows around
your feet as you walk to your friends with your tray of
food. 1 don't want to give the impression that it's dirty (be
cause it's not), but it definitely has that rustic atmosphere.
Zott's is a great place to spend a sunny, warm after
noon-into-evening. People are pretty friendly, and even
if the regulars give you looks, they actually respect you
for forging into the unknown. The bikers even asked us
if we liked the food as we left.
And the food is good. Don't expect anything too

fancy — hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, veggie burg
ers, grilled cheese, etc. The fries are amazingly warm
and crisp on the outside yet firm and smooth on the in
side (seasoned perfectly). And while I have seen grilled
chicken go terribly wrong and rubbery in my life, my
chicken was sliced perfectly thin, and cooked to perfec
tion. The hamburgers are shaped in rectangles, to fit the
grilled ciabatta-like rolls they use instead of buns. Their
grilled onions are just sweet enough, and the prices are
even sweeter. My entire meal of burger and fries only
cost around five dollars, and seeing as how a pitcher only
costs six dollars, this meal won't burn out your wallet.
So the next time you crave a hamburger, it's sunny
outside and all you want to do is chill with your friends
in a friendly and extremely amusing atmosphere, visit
Zott's and keep alive the flame of a Stanford tradition
that shouldn't die out.
Alpine Inn (Zott's) is located at 3915 Alpine Road,
in Portola Valley.
OU Oasis Beer Garden is located at 241 El Camino
Real, in Mcnlo Park.

If you have an extra invite to a real garden party, let Jen
nie know at jbroder@stanford.edu. She has a breezy sum
mer dress that she is dying to wear somewhere. So fold
those collars up, don the pastels and break out those
khakis. And please, do your laundry if you haven't yet.
