## Constitution must be upheld 
### 
The ASSU is a mess. In the first executive
election, rules were broken by the candi
dates and their supporters, and the Under
graduate Senate decided to nullify the Lee /
Mefford slate's victory. But the Constitutional Coun
cil found last night that it was unconstitutional for the
ASSU to enforce those rules that restricted campaign
related e-mails. Such regulations have repeatedly
been deemed unconstitutional in past years because
they violate a clause in the ASSU Constitution that
prohibits restrictions on students' free speech.
Given that a new special election with new candi
dates is already underway, the Senate may be tempted
to disregard the Constitutional Council's ruling and
refuse again to certify the Lee / Mefford win. We be
lieve that would be a serious mistake. At this point, the
Constitution is the only legitimate source of authority
in the ASSU, and for the Senate to ignore it would un
dermine the credibility of the entire organization.
The Constitutional Council's ruling did not arise
out of nothing. This is the third time in the past five
years that the Council has struck down attempts by the
Senate to enforce rules that restrict campaign speech.
The fact that the Senate has not abandoned its efforts

to enforce these rules shows either inexcusable igno
rance or a willful disregard for the Constitution. The
current, newly elected Senate cannot be blamed for the
mistakes of its predecessors. But we hope it avoids re
peating them and decides to certify the original Lee /
Mefford win.
This does not mean we see Lee / Mefford as a
stronger slate than Borgelt-Mose / Vargas Caro,
whom we have endorsed in the special election. But if
the Senate were to flout the Constitution, this would
be far more troubling than for the student body to
elect a less-than-optimal slate. If the Senate refuses to
confirm Lee / Mefford for any reason related to the
campaign e-mails, it will set up a standoff with the
Constitutional Council — a conflict that could lead to
an ugly, extended stalemate and destroy whatever
credibility the ASSU still has.
The Senate should follow the recommendation of
both the Elections Commission and the Constitution
al Council and certify the original Lee / Mefford vic
tory. It should not announce the results of the special
election, which ends tomorrow night. And the ASSU
should unite behind Lee and Mefford and move on
with at least the integrity of its Constitution intact.
