# STILL MAC, STILL DANGEROUS
## All hail 'The OC' 
### 
Britney Spears could stroll
topless through the hall
ways of my fraternity
house at 9 p.m. tonight and
nary a soul would get up to meet her
with open arms. Some guys here and
there may turn their necks to catch a
quick glimpse of a boob, but that's it.
Instead, my SAE brethren will have
something much more important on
their minds: the season finale of
"The OC."
You see, much like the crack epi
demic that ravaged inner cities during
the Reagan years. Fox's "The OC"
has infiltrated my house this year,
mowing down helpless victims one
after another.
And I'm not ashamed to admit that
I too am a fallen soldier, with my eyes
glued to the television and my hands
clutching the remote control as if it
were a steaming crack pipe for that di
vinely inspired hour of television one
night a week.
For those of you who have the re
sisted the temptation to watch thus far,
I will provide a brief 411 as best as
I can.
The show takes place in Orange
County, depicting the lives of a
group of good-looking, well-off and
morally bankrupt characters. At
the center of it all is the Cohen clan
— not the tribe of Israel, but an ex
tended family of six. Sandy and
Kirsten are the biological parents of
Seth and the guardians of Ryan,
whom they brought into their home
last summer from the other side of
the train tracks in Chino. Kirsten's
father is Caleb, the real estate king
of Newport, and her younger sister
is Hailey, a smoking-hot wild-child
who just returned from a stripping
gig in Hollywood.
One house away is the Cooper
clan. Jimmy and Julie are the par
ents, who got divorced after invest
ment manager Jimmy pulled a quick
Enron move on some of his clients
and lost all of their money. And
their daughter is Marissa, the
quintessential "girl next door,"
whose best friend is Summer, an air
headed but sweet-natured girl who
has occupied a place in my heart
that Jeannie Garth once held se
cure. More on that later.
The relationships between the
two families are odder than the
Jackson family with a redneck twist.
Ryan and Marissa are young pup
pies in love, as are Seth and Sum
mer. Julie is about to marry

Kirsten's father after a couple
weeks of going to bone-town in a
motel room with her daughter's ex
boyfriend. And Jimmy is with
Kirsten's sister, complicating his 25-
year-long crush on Kirsten.
If you aren't already hooked, let
me heap some serious praise on the

show — and trust
me, this is about as
much as I compli
ment anything, so
savor the flavor.
The writing is
as fresh and witty
as anything on
television, per
haps because the
show's creator.
Josh Schwartz,
was the youngest

person to ever get a production deal
for primetime at the age of 26. The
storylines, while increasingly con
voluted, are almost always enter
taining— although I can do with
out Ryan's old flame Theresa jump
ing back into the picture every
other episode. And unlike its pre
decessor, "Beverly Hills 90210,"
the show brilliantly intertwines its
adult characters into the drama,
which is good since I am pretty
much at the point when looking
lustily at high school girls makes me
feel gross. That even goes for the
Olsen twins.
Maybe I'm unjustly patting my
self on the back, but I think it takes
some serious cojones fora guy to
come out and say he is obsessed with
"The OC." But 1 did it since, as Rick
James would say, it's one helluva of
a show.
Now that I think about it, I'm
pretty sure 1 can blame my older sis
ter for my seemingly deviant ways,
since she got me hooked on
"90210" when I was just a young
whippersnapper. Fora couple
years, "90210" was an alternate re
ality in her life, and 1 gladly sat
there with her and watched the on
going drama of Brandon, Brenda,
Dylan, Kelly and the gang. I got so
into it, pretty soon 1 wondered why
none of my friends were bulimic
victims of date rape.
In fact, it was while watching
"90210" that I first realized that I
was attracted to girls. I was probably
in fourth grade, the character was
Kelly Taylor, and for my pre
pubescent curious mind, Kelly
might as well have been Helen of

Troy. That crush whetted my ap
petite for the show, and before I
knew it, I was still watching it almost
a decade later.
It's clear that "The OC" has
ripped off "90210" almost as much
as Jennifer Garner's new movie
"13 Going On 30" ripped off "Big."
There's the wealthy SoCal setting
with no work and all play, an inces
tuous group of friends and family,
and a cast full of 25-year-olds play
ing 16-year-olds. But, I dare to say
that "The OC" has improved the
formula and is simply a better
show. Try me for blasphemy and
burn me at the stake. I don't care.
It's true.
The writing is realer, the characters
are better developed and the girls are
hotter — it's "90210" with a faster en
gine and some 22-inch rims.
Truthfully, there really aren't that
many things that bridge the gap be
tween males and females our age —
things both genders can call their own.
Off hand, I can only think of a few: a
fondness for Long Island Iced Teas, a
crush on Angelina Jolie, and now, a
love for"The OC."
So, watch me branch out into an
area I was pretty sure I would
never enter — the world of rela
tionship advice.
Here goes nothing: Guys, if
you're on the down-and-outs with
your lady-friend, or simply on the
lookout fora down-to-Mars girl, in
vite that special someone over
tonight to watch the season finale.
Dim the lights, break open a bottle
of Two-Buck-Chuck and bond over
the transgressions of hot, rich and
dysfunctional misfits.
At the beginning of the episode,
if a girl asks you what you think of
Summer's outfit, simply stare at
Summer's chest and mumble some
thing incoherently. By the 30-
minute mark, jointly ponder how
many Viagra tablets Caleb needs to
pop in order to pleasure Julie for
ten minutes. And, by the end, confi
dently voice your opinion about
whether Ryan should choose
Marissa or Theresa as his high
school sweetheart.
Just don't call me and ask me any
thing during the show. I don't like to
be interrupted during game day.

voluted, are almost always enter
taining— although I can do with
out Ryan's old flame Theresa jump
ing back into the picture every
other episode. And unlike its pre
decessor, "Beverly Hills 90210,"
the show brilliantly intertwines its
adult characters into the drama,
which is good since I am pretty
much at the point when looking
lustily at high school girls makes me
feel gross. That even goes for the
Olsen twins.
Maybe I'm unjustly patting my
self on the back, but I think it takes
some serious cojones fora guy to
come out and say he is obsessed with
"The OC." But 1 did it since, as Rick
James would say, it's one helluva of
a show.
Now that I think about it, I'm
pretty sure 1 can blame my older sis
ter for my seemingly deviant ways,
since she got me hooked on
"90210" when I was just a young
whippersnapper. Fora couple
years, "90210" was an alternate re
ality in her life, and 1 gladly sat
there with her and watched the on
going drama of Brandon, Brenda,
Dylan, Kelly and the gang. I got so
into it, pretty soon 1 wondered why
none of my friends were bulimic
victims of date rape.
In fact, it was while watching
"90210" that I first realized that I
was attracted to girls. I was probably
in fourth grade, the character was
Kelly Taylor, and for my pre
pubescent curious mind, Kelly
might as well have been Helen of

Troy. That crush whetted my ap
petite for the show, and before I
knew it, I was still watching it almost
a decade later.
It's clear that "The OC" has
ripped off "90210" almost as much
as Jennifer Garner's new movie
"13 Going On 30" ripped off "Big."
There's the wealthy SoCal setting
with no work and all play, an inces
tuous group of friends and family,
and a cast full of 25-year-olds play
ing 16-year-olds. But, I dare to say
that "The OC" has improved the
formula and is simply a better
show. Try me for blasphemy and
burn me at the stake. I don't care.
It's true.
The writing is realer, the characters
are better developed and the girls are
hotter — it's "90210" with a faster en
gine and some 22-inch rims.
Truthfully, there really aren't that
many things that bridge the gap be
tween males and females our age —
things both genders can call their own.
Off hand, I can only think of a few: a
fondness for Long Island Iced Teas, a
crush on Angelina Jolie, and now, a
love for"The OC."
So, watch me branch out into an
area I was pretty sure I would
never enter — the world of rela
tionship advice.
Here goes nothing: Guys, if
you're on the down-and-outs with
your lady-friend, or simply on the
lookout fora down-to-Mars girl, in
vite that special someone over
tonight to watch the season finale.
Dim the lights, break open a bottle
of Two-Buck-Chuck and bond over
the transgressions of hot, rich and
dysfunctional misfits.
At the beginning of the episode,
if a girl asks you what you think of
Summer's outfit, simply stare at
Summer's chest and mumble some
thing incoherently. By the 30-
minute mark, jointly ponder how
many Viagra tablets Caleb needs to
pop in order to pleasure Julie for
ten minutes. And, by the end, confi
dently voice your opinion about
whether Ryan should choose
Marissa or Theresa as his high
school sweetheart.
Just don't call me and ask me any
thing during the show. I don't like to
be interrupted during game day.

Britney Spears could stroll
topless through the hall
ways of my fraternity
house at 9 p.m. tonight and
nary a soul would get up to meet her
with open arms. Some guys here and
there may turn their necks to catch a
quick glimpse of a boob, but that's it.
Instead, my SAE brethren will have
something much more important on
their minds: the season finale of
"The OC."
You see, much like the crack epi
demic that ravaged inner cities during
the Reagan years. Fox's "The OC"
has infiltrated my house this year,
mowing down helpless victims one
after another.
And I'm not ashamed to admit that
I too am a fallen soldier, with my eyes
glued to the television and my hands
clutching the remote control as if it
were a steaming crack pipe for that di
vinely inspired hour of television one
night a week.
For those of you who have the re
sisted the temptation to watch thus far,
I will provide a brief 411 as best as
I can.
The show takes place in Orange
County, depicting the lives of a
group of good-looking, well-off and
morally bankrupt characters. At
the center of it all is the Cohen clan
— not the tribe of Israel, but an ex
tended family of six. Sandy and
Kirsten are the biological parents of
Seth and the guardians of Ryan,
whom they brought into their home
last summer from the other side of
the train tracks in Chino. Kirsten's
father is Caleb, the real estate king
of Newport, and her younger sister
is Hailey, a smoking-hot wild-child
who just returned from a stripping
gig in Hollywood.
One house away is the Cooper
clan. Jimmy and Julie are the par
ents, who got divorced after invest
ment manager Jimmy pulled a quick
Enron move on some of his clients
and lost all of their money. And
their daughter is Marissa, the
quintessential "girl next door,"
whose best friend is Summer, an air
headed but sweet-natured girl who
has occupied a place in my heart
that Jeannie Garth once held se
cure. More on that later.
The relationships between the
two families are odder than the
Jackson family with a redneck twist.
Ryan and Marissa are young pup
pies in love, as are Seth and Sum
mer. Julie is about to marry

Kirsten's father after a couple
weeks of going to bone-town in a
motel room with her daughter's ex
boyfriend. And Jimmy is with
Kirsten's sister, complicating his 25-
year-long crush on Kirsten.
If you aren't already hooked, let
me heap some serious praise on the

show — and trust
me, this is about as
much as I compli
ment anything, so
savor the flavor.
The writing is
as fresh and witty
as anything on
television, per
haps because the
show's creator.
