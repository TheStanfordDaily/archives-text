# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Letter was anti-Semitic
I'd like to think that Stanford is a
place where tolerance and diversity
are accepted. I'd like to think that The
Stanford Daily does its best to uphold
this spirit. I guess on that second point,
I thought wrong.
Yesterday's letter by Joe Webb, a
neighborhood resident, contained a
number of blatantly anti-Semitic accu
sations linked to "Jewish power" as if
there were some conspiracy by Jews to
dominate the United States and the
world. This is the same hate and anti-
Semitism that was shouted in Nazi
Germany and is currently being shout
ed by only the most extreme of Pales
tinian extremists.
His letter then legitimized the absurd
yet growing practice of Holocaust denial
(i.e. Jews made the whole thing up). Fi
nally, he mentions legislation that is in
tended to curb anti-Semitism, and sug
gests that legislation against racial hatred
should be acceptable, and punishing it
results in a "loss of liberties."
Joe Webb has a long history of anti-
Semitic activity in the area, and while I
don't have the opportunity to detail it,
I'll just say he's gone as far as to plaster
entire neighborhoods with fliers con
taining nasty ethnic slurs against Jews.
At nearly every anti-Israel event or

rally in the Bay Area, Joe Webb is the
one holding up the sign that goes far
beyond criticism of Israel (like, for ex
ample, signs that say "Jews are Nazis")
I do not appreciate The Daily's hav
ing given a voice to such intolerance.
Hate speech is not free speech. The
Daily needs to be more responsible
with what it publishes in the letters sec
tion. and 1 am offended by the content
of this letter. This has no place in an aca
demic, progressive and respectful insti
tution like Stanford.

GSC look ballot mistake seriously
I'd like to respond to the points
raised by Victoria Stodden in Mon
day's letter "GSC election should not
have been certified." First, Stodden is
correct in stating that she was placed
on the social sciences ballot instead of
the natural sciences ballot in this
year's GSC election. I sincerely apolo
gize for this mistake.
When candidates from the School
of Humanities and Sciences filed their
intent to run for the GSC, they were
not required to declare the district to
which they belong (i.e. natural science
or social science). I made a judgment

call and placed Stodden on the social
science ballot.
Knowing I was unsure, 1 sent the bal
lot out on March 16 and asked the can
didates to verify that they were in the
correct districts. I received no correc
tions. A few days before the election,
the GSC sent the prospective ballot to
the entire student population. Not hear
ing any complaints, the Elections Com
mission proceeded with the election.
During the election, voters from the
natural sciences did not see Stodden's
name listed for their district. However,
she was listed in the at-large section of
the ballot and students also had the op
tion to vote for her as a write-in candi
date. No write-in votes were cast, al
though I acknowledge that most voters
are unlikely to write in candidates.
In voting to certify the election, the
GSC was aware of the ballot problem,
and we took it very seriously. We dis
cussed the certification in two public
meetings, the first of which Stodden did
not attend. My decision to certify was
not based on expediency or to avoid
embarrassment. Rather, I felt that run
ning another election would not be
more fair overall, since a second elec
tion would likely have lower turnout
and fewer candidates. In looking at the
election results, I also felt that there was
a low probability that the mistake af

fected the election outcome.
Students should know that the GSC
considered this issue fully, with much
"rational discourse." Ultimately, the
GSC decided that there was no ideal so
lution to the ballot mistake, and that
certifying the election was the best
course of action.

Column displayed disregard
for law, safety
The arrogance displayed by Jen
Graham, in her May 3 column ("Cops
must stop stopping bikers") attempting
to ridicule the police for enforcement of
traffic rules on bicycles, is matched only
by her indifference to the safety of oth
ers. I have no wish to interfere if she and
her friends want to put premature ends
to their own lives, but they have no right
to take with them others who have not
consented. They have clearly earned
every citation they have received, and I
earnestly hope that in the future the law
enforcers will be less lenient.
The Stanford police should certainly
continue their commendable effort; the
attitude of those like Graham, who con
sider themselves above the law and all
responsibility, offers good ground to in

tensify that effort. Many of us value our
lives and our limbs, and cherish a wish to
walk and cycle on the campus in an or
derly way and in reasonable safety.

Editor's Note: The headline of the col
umn, "Cops must stop stopping bik
ers, " was written by an editor, not by
Jen Graham, and it did not accurately
reflect the content of her column. Gra
ham's intention was to argue for less
stiff penalties, not an outright end to bi
cycle enforcement.
Tresidder renovation
has its downside
The commercialization and renova
tion of Tresidder Union has its advan
tages and disadvantages, and I would
like to discuss the disadvantages I have
encountered recently. Although I be
lieve it to be a nice convenience to be
able to drink a Peets Coffee swirl while
studying for my midterms, I would find
it an even greater bonus if I could con
tinue to study for these midterms past
6:30 p.m. on a Sunday night.
In addition, I am greatly disserviced
as a 21st century user of wireless ethemet

via laptop when I find there to be only
four outlets in an approximately 6,400
square-foot study area. Finally, the inter
mittent light outages during study ses
sions are enough to put me over the edge.
I believe that Tresidder was better
before when we lacked the advantages
of Peet's Coffee and Subway sandwich
es but also the three-headed monster of
a study-stopper I have described above.

Vote Kirchofer / Mountain Lion
for ASSU executive
I would like to propose a write-in
slate for ASSU executive of Former
Stanford Basketball Star Joe Kirchofer
and The Mountain Lion That Has
Been Attacking Horses. They would
get the job done.
Speaking of that mountain lion,
does anyone else think that this is shap
ing up to be a Christopher Pike novel
where some ancient evil has been un
earthed and it actually isn't a mountain
lion that is attacking horses, but some
person who drank cursed water from
The Claw? Just a thought.
