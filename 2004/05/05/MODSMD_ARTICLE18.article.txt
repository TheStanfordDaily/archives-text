## The 						horror of leaving Stanford 
### MICHAEL DUCA 
I want to wake up now. 1 don't like
this dream. In this dream, the worst
dream ever, I graduate and move to
what some people call the real world.
This real world isn't the one that MTV
tries to sell me, where everyone is hot and
nobody pays rent. In this real world, 1
send out cover letters to potential em
ployers, search endlessly on Craigslist for
unaffordable apartments, and ponder
what — or who — 1 will have to do to get
dental insurance. I don't floss.
In this dream, the lovable-but-clumsy
me gets figuratively bitch-slapped by the
efficient but grumpy BeelzebubCorp job
recruiter who glares across the vast ex
panse of her immaculate oak-wood desk
and states, "We are concerned by the
gaps in your resume. You had no em
ployment during the past two summers?"
"Yes, I worked, but the work I did
cannot be conveyed on a resume. I did
a lot of thinking, you know, and writ
ing. Can I do an interpretive dance of
what I learned?"
She arches one eyebrow, smirks
at me, and glances critically back at

my resume.
My desperation building, I blurt,
"Your Website says you're an equal op
portunity employer. 1 don't like labels,
because I find them constricting and,
frankly, arbitrary, and I pity those peo
ple who willingly pigeon-hole them
selves into such constricting categories,
but... excuse me? Yes, I'll hurry up. I'm
gay. So gay. Does that help my chances
of getting hired?"
Fora moment, her face softens as she
seems to consider this. I wink at her with
a smile that says, "If you hire me, we can
be best friends and you can be my Hag."
But hope flickers as her lips slowly tight
en and she says, "We prefer to hire grad
uates with degrees in the sciences."
Next, in this dream, the she-devil re
cruitress sprouts razor-sharp wings and
flings me with her talons off the 99th
floor of the towering BeelzebubCorp
skyscraper. Her cackling echoes in my
ears as I fall.
The concrete rushes toward me, and
1 notice for the first time the scattered
lifeless bodies of other unsuccessful job
seekers who came — and fell — before
me. (Isn't that Stacy from the poetry

writing workshop? Noooooo!) How
did I not notice those corpses when I
first arrived? Was 1 too concentrated on
my goal to notice the obvious warning
signs? Why did I ever like Hootie and
the Blowfish?
Now I have awoken and 1 am reel
ing. The dream meant something, but I
can't figure out what. Perhaps the
dream sought to instruct me to avoid all
companies that use human blood for
ink. No, that can't be it. 1 do that all the
time. Perhaps it sought to teach me that
Stanford career fairs will never have
companies that could hire me. Yes, but
no. That can't be it, either.
Wait a moment! I believe have found
the answer. Or the path to the answer.
Yes, perhaps I should search within my
self to find the significance of my dream,
instead of trying to blame outside people
or forces for my shortcomings. Yes, it is
my own fault I ruined my life!
It is because 1 didn't choose a major
like computer science or electrical engi
neering or, at the very least, economics.
Truly, who cares if economics majors
are stingy, self-centered pigs — they
shall be the ones chuckling as they dan

gle their Sacagawea dollar pieces before
my dripping, needy eyes. Indeed, this is
what my dream showed me: 1 am my
own razor-taloned she-devil.
Actually, my CAPS therapist tells
me I haven't ruined my life. Why? I ask
him, but it is too late; he tells me our time
is up. He also says this is my 10th session,
and my free sessions are finished, and
that if I ever want to see him again, I will
have to pay a lot of money.
"More than you can afford," he
chuckles. "Sorry, we don't do charity
here for unemployed graduates."
I begin to protest, but he holds up a
hand. I try, at the very least, to give him
a parting hug, but he grimaces and then
sneezes. As I shut the door behind me,
tears pouring down my cheeks, I hear
my therapist mutter, "Would you like
fiies with that ?"
These parting words linger in my
mind. I feel dizzy as I stumble through
White Plaza and pass a tour group pranc
ing through. All of the young visitors'
faces are delighted to have discovered
such a beautiful place. I settle on the
glowing countenance of one strikingly at
tractive young lad who looks particularly

taken aback by his surroundings.
Then I see something that is shock
ing. This boy is me — not the me that
exists now, but the me that arrived at
Stanford four years ago. This version of
me has come as my replacement.
Reality finally hits me. I am leaving
Stanford fora darker, scarier place. I
cannot diminish the enormity of the
transition I am about to make — the en
tire Class of 2004 is about to make —
with rationalizations or cheerful lessons.
My life will never be the same. Nay,
I will never again have the luxury of
waking up at 11 a.m. every day of the
week, sneaking into the faculty swim
ming club on weekends or chatting with
a professor about what jobs I might pur
sue after I graduate.
Suddenly, a host of voices fills my
head. They are the voices of my fifth
grade arch-nemesis, my biological father
and the scary clown from the opening se
quence of Are You Afraid of the Dark?
They are screeching and moaning words
— bad, offensive words — such as "cof
fee," "photocopy" and "backrub." My
composure shatters, and I crumble right
here in front of the passing tour group.

Among the crowd, which has stopped
to witness my breakdown, I spy my
younger alter-ego nervously laughing. 1
can tell he is excited about the scene he is
observing. He sees now that Stanford is a
happening place where students not only
learn in the classroom, but on the streets
as well. He wonders what is going
through my mind, my psychology. He re
alizes that he can learn all about it—he
can take "Intro to Psychology" with Zim
bardo when he matriculates in the fall!
"Don't do it," I yell, with spittle drip
ping down my chin. "Do not take psy
chology! Zimbardo will hypnotize you!
Take CSIO6A. And that electrical engi
neering course. Yes, the hard one! And
take that math class that everyone
hates. Yes! You will hate them, but you
will find a job. Just look at me! You
don't want to end up like me!"

Michael Duca is a senior majoring in
Urban Studies. When he graduates in
June, he will be unhoused and unem
ployed. lie may have his dignity. E

ink. No, that can't be it. 1 do that all the
time. Perhaps it sought to teach me that
Stanford career fairs will never have
companies that could hire me. Yes, but
no. That can't be it, either.
Wait a moment! I believe have found
the answer. Or the path to the answer.
Yes, perhaps I should search within my
self to find the significance of my dream,
instead of trying to blame outside people
or forces for my shortcomings. Yes, it is
my own fault I ruined my life!
It is because 1 didn't choose a major
like computer science or electrical engi
neering or, at the very least, economics.
Truly, who cares if economics majors
are stingy, self-centered pigs — they
shall be the ones chuckling as they dan

gle their Sacagawea dollar pieces before
my dripping, needy eyes. Indeed, this is
what my dream showed me: 1 am my
own razor-taloned she-devil.
Actually, my CAPS therapist tells
me I haven't ruined my life. Why? I ask
him, but it is too late; he tells me our time
is up. He also says this is my 10th session,
and my free sessions are finished, and
that if I ever want to see him again, I will
have to pay a lot of money.
"More than you can afford," he
chuckles. "Sorry, we don't do charity
here for unemployed graduates."
I begin to protest, but he holds up a
hand. I try, at the very least, to give him
a parting hug, but he grimaces and then
sneezes. As I shut the door behind me,
tears pouring down my cheeks, I hear
my therapist mutter, "Would you like
fiies with that ?"
These parting words linger in my
mind. I feel dizzy as I stumble through
White Plaza and pass a tour group pranc
ing through. All of the young visitors'
faces are delighted to have discovered
such a beautiful place. I settle on the
glowing countenance of one strikingly at
tractive young lad who looks particularly

taken aback by his surroundings.
Then I see something that is shock
ing. This boy is me — not the me that
exists now, but the me that arrived at
Stanford four years ago. This version of
me has come as my replacement.
Reality finally hits me. I am leaving
Stanford fora darker, scarier place. I
cannot diminish the enormity of the
transition I am about to make — the en
tire Class of 2004 is about to make —
with rationalizations or cheerful lessons.
My life will never be the same. Nay,
I will never again have the luxury of
waking up at 11 a.m. every day of the
week, sneaking into the faculty swim
ming club on weekends or chatting with
a professor about what jobs I might pur
sue after I graduate.
Suddenly, a host of voices fills my
head. They are the voices of my fifth
grade arch-nemesis, my biological father
and the scary clown from the opening se
quence of Are You Afraid of the Dark?
They are screeching and moaning words
— bad, offensive words — such as "cof
fee," "photocopy" and "backrub." My
composure shatters, and I crumble right
here in front of the passing tour group.

Among the crowd, which has stopped
to witness my breakdown, I spy my
younger alter-ego nervously laughing. 1
can tell he is excited about the scene he is
observing. He sees now that Stanford is a
happening place where students not only
learn in the classroom, but on the streets
as well. He wonders what is going
through my mind, my psychology. He re
alizes that he can learn all about it—he
can take "Intro to Psychology" with Zim
bardo when he matriculates in the fall!
"Don't do it," I yell, with spittle drip
ping down my chin. "Do not take psy
chology! Zimbardo will hypnotize you!
Take CSIO6A. And that electrical engi
neering course. Yes, the hard one! And
take that math class that everyone
hates. Yes! You will hate them, but you
will find a job. Just look at me! You
don't want to end up like me!"

I want to wake up now. 1 don't like
this dream. In this dream, the worst
dream ever, I graduate and move to
what some people call the real world.
This real world isn't the one that MTV
tries to sell me, where everyone is hot and
nobody pays rent. In this real world, 1
send out cover letters to potential em
ployers, search endlessly on Craigslist for
unaffordable apartments, and ponder
what — or who — 1 will have to do to get
dental insurance. I don't floss.
In this dream, the lovable-but-clumsy
me gets figuratively bitch-slapped by the
efficient but grumpy BeelzebubCorp job
recruiter who glares across the vast ex
panse of her immaculate oak-wood desk
and states, "We are concerned by the
gaps in your resume. You had no em
ployment during the past two summers?"
"Yes, I worked, but the work I did
cannot be conveyed on a resume. I did
a lot of thinking, you know, and writ
ing. Can I do an interpretive dance of
what I learned?"
She arches one eyebrow, smirks
at me, and glances critically back at

my resume.
My desperation building, I blurt,
"Your Website says you're an equal op
portunity employer. 1 don't like labels,
because I find them constricting and,
frankly, arbitrary, and I pity those peo
ple who willingly pigeon-hole them
selves into such constricting categories,
but... excuse me? Yes, I'll hurry up. I'm
gay. So gay. Does that help my chances
of getting hired?"
Fora moment, her face softens as she
seems to consider this. I wink at her with
a smile that says, "If you hire me, we can
be best friends and you can be my Hag."
But hope flickers as her lips slowly tight
en and she says, "We prefer to hire grad
uates with degrees in the sciences."
Next, in this dream, the she-devil re
cruitress sprouts razor-sharp wings and
flings me with her talons off the 99th
floor of the towering BeelzebubCorp
skyscraper. Her cackling echoes in my
ears as I fall.
The concrete rushes toward me, and
1 notice for the first time the scattered
lifeless bodies of other unsuccessful job
seekers who came — and fell — before
me. (Isn't that Stacy from the poetry

writing workshop? Noooooo!) How
did I not notice those corpses when I
first arrived? Was 1 too concentrated on
my goal to notice the obvious warning
signs? Why did I ever like Hootie and
the Blowfish?
Now I have awoken and 1 am reel
ing. The dream meant something, but I
can't figure out what. Perhaps the
dream sought to instruct me to avoid all
companies that use human blood for
ink. No, that can't be it. 1 do that all the
time. Perhaps it sought to teach me that
Stanford career fairs will never have
companies that could hire me. Yes, but
