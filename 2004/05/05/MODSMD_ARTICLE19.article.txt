## Williams still the measuring stick for hitters 
### 
£ £ utstanding;" "unmatched;"
I 1 "unreal;" "ludicrous." As the
relentless search for superla
tives with which to describe Barry Bonds's
annihilation of National League pitching con
tinues, his efforts still pale in comparison to
the ghost of hitters past. Ted Williams, two
time winner of the Triple Crown and the self
styled Greatest Hitter of All Time, remains
the standard for excellence in swinging the
stick.
Nobody has hit .400 since Williams did
so in 1941. There has been talk of Bonds ap
proaching the Splendid Splinter's mark this
year after his torrid start. This is not un
thinkable, due to the inevitable failure of
other teams to pitch to him, particularly
when he is surrounded in the lineup by
beer-league Softball players masquerading
as Giants.
By the middle of last week, Bonds had

swung and missed nine
times all year — and hit
nine home runs. Though
you can see flashes of
Williams in Bonds — the
barely-concealed distaste
for his teammates' failures,
the stony silence toward
the media — I would pay
twice the outrageous cost
of admission to SBC Park

to see Williams in his prime.
Every time Bonds steps to the plate, the
air becomes charged with an electricity that
no other hitter can match. Even from the
bleacher seats, you can almost see the
pitcher's sphincter clench up and his
thought bubble form: "Don't get embar
rassed." His mere presence changes the
game, placing the pressure squarely on the
pitcher in a situation where it would other
wise be on the hitter. But, occasionally, you
can tell Barry might rather be on the links
or with his son than out in left field, where
his once-stellar defense is rapidly becoming
more Johnny Knoxville than Johnny
Damon.
Ted Williams was Barry Bonds before
Barry was born. Like Bonds, Williams spent a
career filled with individual records futilely
chasing a championship ring and answering
questions about the relationship between his
own excellence and his team's failures.
While Barry chooses to sulk in postgame
reverie in his clubhouse recliner, Williams felt
no reason to hide his hatred for the media.
Bonds is an enigma, a superstar detached
from his stardom who chooses to insulate
himself from the world of sport. He exists on
his own plane, apart from his fans, the writers
and even his teammates, who treat him more
like a respected guest than an equal.
Where Bonds is the emotionless rock for
the Giants, Williams immersed himself in
the Red Sox' struggles with such tenacity
that the media feared rather than pestered
him. He spat at fans, staunchly refused to tip
his cap to the "bastard" throngs of Fenway
and exploded on writers who questioned his
abilities. Williams strung expletives togeth
er to form the kind of caustic poetry that
made him a larger-than-life hero in Boston,
albeit one with a well-documented love
hate relationship with the city.
Williams was a ballplayer to the core; his
life off the field was almost entirely devoted
to preparing for the next pitcher he would
face. Alternating between a maniacal desire
to succeed and an explosive rage at his own
failure and the shortcomings of his team,
Williams became baseball incarnate. He
was Ernest Hemingway with a bat, sharing a
fierce passion for the sea and competition.
For every Hemingway story. Williams has a
trump card. While Papa Hemingway en
joyed hunting shark in Bimini with subma
chine guns — so much so, in fact, that he
once shot himself in both legs doing so —
Williams, after a tough game, took a shot
gun and blasted out the "Strike" and "Ball"
signs on the hallowed Fenway scoreboard.
Before Pat Tillman, there was Ted
Williams, a man who was shot down in
Korea, guided his damaged plane to an
American airfield and then leaped from the
burning wreckage to be met by his com
manding officer who wanted an autograph.
He gave up five years in the prime of his ca
reer to serve in the Air Force in both World
War II and Korea and returned disgusted by
those who would give him a standing ovation
simply for doing what his country asked of
him,
Williams asked for nothing and gave more
than other men could; he exuded the snarling,
sullen confidence of a pit bull and demanded
superiority from himself.
The sweet swing you see on grainy high
light reels, the flawless arc serving as the
template for thousands of boys across
America, remains the standard by which all
others should be judged. Williams is the
benchmark, the man's man, the hitter.
Though Bonds is a Giant among boys, his
legend will be one of performance and not
of desire. Williams will continue to stand
alone.

hate relationship with the city.
Williams was a ballplayer to the core; his
life off the field was almost entirely devoted
to preparing for the next pitcher he would
face. Alternating between a maniacal desire
to succeed and an explosive rage at his own
failure and the shortcomings of his team,
Williams became baseball incarnate. He
was Ernest Hemingway with a bat, sharing a
fierce passion for the sea and competition.
For every Hemingway story. Williams has a
trump card. While Papa Hemingway en
joyed hunting shark in Bimini with subma
chine guns — so much so, in fact, that he
once shot himself in both legs doing so —
Williams, after a tough game, took a shot
gun and blasted out the "Strike" and "Ball"
signs on the hallowed Fenway scoreboard.
Before Pat Tillman, there was Ted
Williams, a man who was shot down in
Korea, guided his damaged plane to an
American airfield and then leaped from the
burning wreckage to be met by his com
manding officer who wanted an autograph.
He gave up five years in the prime of his ca
reer to serve in the Air Force in both World
War II and Korea and returned disgusted by
those who would give him a standing ovation
simply for doing what his country asked of
him,
Williams asked for nothing and gave more
than other men could; he exuded the snarling,
sullen confidence of a pit bull and demanded
superiority from himself.
The sweet swing you see on grainy high
light reels, the flawless arc serving as the
template for thousands of boys across
America, remains the standard by which all
others should be judged. Williams is the
benchmark, the man's man, the hitter.
Though Bonds is a Giant among boys, his
legend will be one of performance and not
of desire. Williams will continue to stand
alone.

£ £ utstanding;" "unmatched;"
I 1 "unreal;" "ludicrous." As the
relentless search for superla
tives with which to describe Barry Bonds's
annihilation of National League pitching con
tinues, his efforts still pale in comparison to
the ghost of hitters past. Ted Williams, two
time winner of the Triple Crown and the self
styled Greatest Hitter of All Time, remains
the standard for excellence in swinging the
stick.
Nobody has hit .400 since Williams did
so in 1941. There has been talk of Bonds ap
proaching the Splendid Splinter's mark this
year after his torrid start. This is not un
thinkable, due to the inevitable failure of
other teams to pitch to him, particularly
when he is surrounded in the lineup by
beer-league Softball players masquerading
as Giants.
By the middle of last week, Bonds had

swung and missed nine
times all year — and hit
nine home runs. Though
you can see flashes of
Williams in Bonds — the
barely-concealed distaste
for his teammates' failures,
the stony silence toward
the media — I would pay
twice the outrageous cost
of admission to SBC Park

to see Williams in his prime.
Every time Bonds steps to the plate, the
air becomes charged with an electricity that
no other hitter can match. Even from the
bleacher seats, you can almost see the
pitcher's sphincter clench up and his
thought bubble form: "Don't get embar
rassed." His mere presence changes the
game, placing the pressure squarely on the
pitcher in a situation where it would other
wise be on the hitter. But, occasionally, you
can tell Barry might rather be on the links
or with his son than out in left field, where
his once-stellar defense is rapidly becoming
more Johnny Knoxville than Johnny
Damon.
Ted Williams was Barry Bonds before
Barry was born. Like Bonds, Williams spent a
career filled with individual records futilely
chasing a championship ring and answering
questions about the relationship between his
own excellence and his team's failures.
While Barry chooses to sulk in postgame
reverie in his clubhouse recliner, Williams felt
no reason to hide his hatred for the media.
Bonds is an enigma, a superstar detached
from his stardom who chooses to insulate
himself from the world of sport. He exists on
his own plane, apart from his fans, the writers
and even his teammates, who treat him more
like a respected guest than an equal.
Where Bonds is the emotionless rock for
the Giants, Williams immersed himself in
the Red Sox' struggles with such tenacity
that the media feared rather than pestered
him. He spat at fans, staunchly refused to tip
his cap to the "bastard" throngs of Fenway
and exploded on writers who questioned his
abilities. Williams strung expletives togeth
er to form the kind of caustic poetry that
made him a larger-than-life hero in Boston,
albeit one with a well-documented love
hate relationship with the city.
