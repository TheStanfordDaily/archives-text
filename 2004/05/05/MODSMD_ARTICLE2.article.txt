# Senate to reconsider Lee / Mefford win
## Council requests that results of special election remain secret 
### DAVID HERBERT JENNIFER MARTINEZ 
The ASSU Constitution
al Council drafted a ruling
late last night stating that the
Undergraduate Senate's re
fusal to certify last month's
executive election was un
constitutional because it in
fringed on free-press rights.
The Council further recom
mended that the results of
this week's special election
be kept secret while the Sen
ate reconsiders whether to
validate last month's elec
tion results.
The Council will finalize
its ruling in a meeting at 11
a.m. on Saturday, May 8.
"We're in a mess here,"
said council member Robert
Rudnitsky, a doctoral candi
date in applied physics, sum

ming up the mood of the six
hour hearing last night,
which ran from 6:30 p.m. to
just after midnight.
The meeting stemmed
from a petition by former
vice presidential candi
date Dylan Mefford, a ju
nior, and his counsel
Henry Towsner, Class of
'03. Former Senate Chair
Josh Shipp, a junior, was
the respondent to Mef
ford's petition.
Soon after the clock
struck midnight, the Council
concluded that last month's
executive election would be
sent back to the Senate for
certification. This week's
special election, they further
decided, will go ahead as
planned, but they recom
mended that the Elections
Commission keep the results
secret until the issue of certi
fication is resolved.
If the Senate validates
the first election. Mefford
and senior Mikey Lee will
become vice president and
president, respectively. In

that scenario, the Council
recommends that the spe
cial election results re
main secret.
If the Senate again refuses
to validate last month's elec
tion, and the new grounds for
its decision are constitutional,
then the special-election re
sults will go to the Senate for
certification.
When ruling that the Sen
ate's decision was unconsti
tutional, the Council con
cluded that the dissenting
senators had largely based
their decision on the flurry of
last-minute e-mails that pre
ceded the election, which are
currently discouraged by
the Campaign Practice Code
(CPC) because they violate
University policy. These
e-mails, they determined,
were a form of free speech
protected by the ASSU
Constitution. This distinc
tion will be key when the first
election goes back to the
Senate for certification.
"We will kindly point
out that issues of free

speech are protected in the
[ASSU] Constitution and
cannot be considered," said
Council Chair Bill Curry, a
fourth-year doctoral stu
dent in geophysics.
Towsner — who has suc
cessfully brought two cases
before the Council before,
and who participated via
a conference call from
Carnegie Mellon University,
where he is currently a grad
uate student — was the first
to speak at the hearing. He
claimed that the Senate vio
lated Article 1 of the ASSU
Constitution by restricting
freedom of press because the
e-mails sent out to the stu
dent lists should be protect
ed by this clause. Townser
then said the Senate does not
have the power to not certify
the election results based on
the e-mails.
After Towsner's opening
statement, Shipp brought up
the point that in its decision
to not certify the election,
"the Senate did not turn
down anything."

"1 cannot read [the sena
tors'] minds and I'm not try
ing to get into people's
heads and why they voted,"
Shipp said. "If you want to
know why the Senate voted
why they did, you should
ask them."
The Council reviewed the
Senate's meeting minutes to
find some indication of the
reasoning behind the deci
sion. One of the repeating
concerns in the minutes was
the controversy surrounding
the e-mails sent out in sup
port of various candidates.
Articles and editorials pub
lished in The Daily were con
sidered secondary evidence
to corroborate what was stat
ed in the Senate minutes.
Mefford had submitted
two sets of Senate minutes
as evidence to the council.
The first set was approved
by the outgoing fifth Under
graduate Senate, while the
second set was not. When
the council questioned him
