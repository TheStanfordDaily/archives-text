# No. 1 Card downs Spartans
## 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess employed
the familiar tactic of using as many pitchers as possi
ble during a non-conference Tuesday game and, as
usual, the Cardinal staff showed off its depth. Seven
pitchers combined on a four-hitter to beat San Jose
State last night, 7-2, improving the top-ranked Cardi
nal's record to 36-6 and running its home winning
streak to 14 games.
Freshman hurler Matt Leva got the start and
earned his fourth win despite having pitched only 14
2/3 innings this season. He allowed one unearned
run in three innings.
The Stanford bats were not as potent as usual and
not near as hot as they were on Sunday against Wash
ington State, when the team scored 17 runs on eight
home runs in only six innings before the game was
called. But the pitching was good enough that it didn't
matter.
Stanford struck first in the bottom of the first in
ning when junior second baseman Jed Lowrie hit his
15th homer of the season, scoring Chris Minaker.
Lowrie leads the Pacific-10 Conference in both home
runs and RBIs, with 56, and has flirted with the .400
mark all season.
He was, however, partly responsible for San
Jose State's first run in the top of the third, when he
committed an uncharacteristic fielding error that
allowed Ryan Angel to advance from first to third.
Angel scored when the next batter, leadoff hitter
Kevin Frandsen, grounded into a double play.
Stanford tacked on two runs to take a 4-1 lead in
the fourth when junior designated hitter Chris Carter
doubled off the right field wall and came around to
score on two wild pitches. Sophomore Chris Lewis
then drove a fastball over the left field scoreboard for
his third homer of the year and his second in two
games.
"Lewis is a good hitter, and he has been swinging
the bat well," Marquess said. "He's worked hard on
his swing recently."
Marquess added that Lewis's versatility could earn
him more playing time down the stretch. The sopho
more started at third base yesterday, but he can also
play both middle infield positions and outfield, if need
be.
San Jose State did not prove much of an offensive
threat over the rest of the contest, especially because
Marquess could seemingly call on any pitcher to get
the job done if the Cardinal ran into trouble.
There was a scary moment in the fifth when Drew
Ehrlich hit Angel in the head, but the Spartan left
fielder jumped up immediately and ran to first base.
He came around to score to bring San Jose State to
within two.
Other than that, the game itself did not provide
much drama. Unless, of course, you consider a John
Mayberry Jr. home run dramatic — which you proba
bly do if you have seen one before. The two-run shot,
his 12th of the year, was a blast to left field in the sev
enth that accounted for the final score.
Mayberry seems fully recovered from a bruised
shoulder he suffered in a game against Santa Clara
last Tuesday. He pinch-hit on Saturday against Wash
ington State and played on Sunday. Mayberry said
that the shoulder felt fine, and Marquess said that he

isn't worried about his star first baseman.
"He's fine," Marquess said.
It clearly helps to have Mayberry back, but the
Stanford lineup is one of the most versatile in col
lege baseball and was able to handle the slugger's
two-game absence without a major slow-down.
Four Cardinal players have 10 or more home runs,
and Brian Hall has nine. Six are batting over .340.
"Our lineup is definitely a threat from top to bot
tom," Mayberry said. "The opposing pitchers have to
spot everything well with every hitter in our lineup."
The pitching staff also demonstrated its versatil
ity, as five of the seven pitchers yesterday — Kodi
ak Ouick, Jeff Stimpson, Mark Jecmen, Blake
Holler and Matt Manship — did not give up a run.
The staff's ERA is 3.91. For comparison's sake, the
second-best mark in the Pac-10 is Arizona State's
4.59.
Count Marquess among the many admirers of his
staff.
"We have a lot of guys who have been effective for
us," he said. "1 won't hesitate to go to anybody in an
important situation."
