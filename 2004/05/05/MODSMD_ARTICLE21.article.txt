# Hester thrives as backup backstop
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
In many respects, Tuesday
games at Sunken Diamond are
business as usual for the Cardi
nal. A couple of Stanford home
runs, some impressive arms out
of the bullpen and yet another
win for the top-ranked team.
But behind the plate, Tues
days are a whole different story.
Junior catcher Donny Lucy
takes a breather during mid

week contests and hands re
ceiving duty off to sophomore
John Hester, who started for
the third time this season last
night against San Jose State.
Hester plays a role on the
Stanford squad that no other
player does. While many pitch
ers and position players are
vying for time on the field be
cause of the ever-changing na-
ture of the starting lineup, the 6-
foot-4 sophomore is simply sitting in
the wings behind Lucy, waiting for
his chance to shine.
It's a situation that Lucy knows
better than anyone, as he spent his
first two years at Stanford in the
shadow of former Cardinal Ail-
American catcher Ryan Garko.
"Ryan set a great example for me
as far as leadership and the way he
caught and I try to carry on that with
John," Lucy said. "We work well to
gether. I try to teach him everything
I know and he helps me out too.
"Catchers here at Stanford, it's
just a good bond we have," Lucy
continued. "We're competitive, but
we're probably closer than any other
unit on the team."
Hester said that both Garko and
Lucy have helped him fine-tune his
game over the past two seasons and
that the experience of working with
both of them has made him a better
catcher. Defensively, his exception
al talent is already apparent.
For now, though, the Tuesday
game has become Hester's opportu
nity to show Stanford's trademark
depth behind the plate. The role is a
challenging one to fill, because, as
any Cardinal player will tell you,
practices and games are two very
different things.
And as Hester saw last night,
Tuesday games demand catching
many different pitchers — Stanford
threw seven hurlers over the course
of nine innings against the Spartans.
"It is difficult," said Hester of
catching so many different personal
ities within the span of a game. "Ba
sically you've got to know your

pitchers: what kind of pitches they
throw, what kind of approach they
like to take."
Thus far, Hester has been hold
ing his own defensively — in addi
tion to being able to adjust mid
game to every arm out of the Cardi
nal bullpen, the Roswell, Ga., native
has yet to commit an error since his
arrival on the Farm.
While his defensive skills make
him a perfect backup to Lucy in the
field, Hester's hitting to date shows
that he may also be able to develop
into the offensive threat that Lucy
has become. After going l-for-4 last
night — and recording the first
stolen base of his career, just for
kicks — Hester is hitting a solid .273
on the season.
"I'm actually pretty happy with
[the way I've been hitting]," Hester
said. "It's pretty hard when you
don't have consistent at-bats,
though I'm getting kind of used to
playing Tuesdays now. It's just easi
er the more at-bats you get. I feel I
can see the ball better now."
Despite the strong performances
that Hester has had, he admits that
the knowledge that his hard work
will likely not translate into a start
ing position this season is sometimes
a source of frustration.
"But seeing Donny go through
the same thing and seeing what's
happened with him this year...
That's encouraging," Hester said.
"He's having a great year."
Hester said that the most impor
tant thing for him to focus on is the
fact that his time in practice and his
Tuesday starts are all valuable learn
ing experiences for when he takes
the reigns behind the plate.
"Each day I try to get something
out of it, so when my time does
come I'm ready to go," Hester said.
"And I know that I'm going to get
my shot."
