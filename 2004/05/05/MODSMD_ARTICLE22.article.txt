Cycling
Last weekend, the Car
dinal competed in the West
ern Collegiate Cycling Con
ference and managed a
spectacular end to the sea
son by leapfrogging up from
fifth place to finish third be
hind California and UC-
Davis.
After a very early wake
up call on Saturday morn
ing. the team headed out to
Creston, Calif., for the start
of the competition, which
was hosted by Cal Poly. In
the team time trial, the
women came in third, while
the men's A took fourth and
the men's B (comprising two
teams) fifth. The road race
brought impressive finishes
from Sheela Singla (third in
the women's B) and Amber
Rais (fifth in her first
women's A on a tough, hilly
course). Last but not least,
Chris Montague-Breakwell
took first in the men's A
road race. In the men's B,
Rand Miller and Uyen
Block both performed well.
sprinting to exciting finishes.
On Sunday, a few extra hours
of sleep meant a later start and
cycling during the heat of the
day. The 0.9-mile course was on
an old military base. In the
women's B, there were two big
crashes, which stopped the race
and resulted in four riders being
taken to hospital. Having fallen
in the first accident, Stanford's
Sheela Singla picked herself
back up and finished eighth.
Rand Miller formed part of a
five-man breakaway in the men's
B that almost lapped the field
and brought him fifth place,
while Uyen Block led the pack to
bring home sixth-place honors.
A few attempts at breakaways in

the women's A failed as the pack
caught the leaders, setting up a
decisive sprint in which Mary
Haw took second place. Finally,
in the men's A, Dave Pierce
broke early hut was eventually
held up behind an accident and
dropped back to 10th.
Special note must go to team
member Tyler Heston, who
showed great dedication by driv
ing back and forth in support
while also putting in some great
racing. The next big challenge for
the team will be the upcoming
Nationals in Madison, Wis. Four
local teams, including Stanford,
will compete.
