Cycling
Last weekend, the Car
dinal competed in the West
ern Collegiate Cycling Con
ference and managed a
spectacular end to the sea
son by leapfrogging up from
fifth place to finish third be
hind California and UC-
Davis.
After a very early wake
up call on Saturday morn
ing. the team headed out to
Creston, Calif., for the start
of the competition, which
was hosted by Cal Poly. In
the team time trial, the
women came in third, while
the men's A took fourth and
the men's B (comprising two
teams) fifth. The road race
brought impressive finishes
from Sheela Singla (third in
the women's B) and Amber
Rais (fifth in her first
women's A on a tough, hilly
course). Last but not least,
Chris Montague-Breakwell
took first in the men's A
road race. In the men's B,
Rand Miller and Uyen
Block both performed well.
