### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
It is certain is that the road to the women's golf
NCAA Championships will go through Stanford.
By the completion of the 2004 NCAA West Re
gional Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal women's
golf team could find itself on that road or simply the
sad hosts of a three-day bon voyage party.
Twenty-one teams, plus three additional individ
ual qualifiers, will compete in the three-day tourna
ment at the Stanford Golf Course beginning tomor
row and wrapping up on Saturday. The top eight
teams and two individuals from each of three Re
gional will qualify for the NCAA Championships,
which will be held May 18-21 at Auburn University.
Among the Cardinal's main competition will be
Pacific-10 Conference champion UCLA, Big-10
champion Ohio State, Big-12 champion Texas, Cali
fornia and Georgia.
Two weeks removed from a seventh-place finish at
the Pac-10 Championships in Los Angeles, Stanford
hopes to find its stroke at home.
Senior Kim Kouwabunpat, who tied for 28th at
Pac-lOs. will enter Thursday's opening round as the
Cardinal's most consistent contributor this season.
Her 75.8 stroke average is tops on the team.
Meanwhile, Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana will
look to build on her string of two consecutive top-20
finishes. The freshman finished seventh at fac-lOs
after firing an even-par 72 in the final round.
Tangtiphaiboontana placed fifth at the Peg Barnard
Collegiate held at Stanford last month.
Stanford will need strong performances from ju
nior Wendra Liang and senior Angela Rho to get
back toNCAAs.
The Cardinal advanced to NCAAs for the 20th
time in school history after placing eighth at the 2003
West Regional in Tempe, Ariz., with a three-round
total of 905.
Southern California fired a team-total of 873 to
win last year's West Regional, seven strokes ahead of
second-place Oklahoma State.
Kim Rowton, Class of '03, placed 20th individual
ly to pace the Cardinal, while then-freshman Kelly
Husted placed 25th. Kouwabunpat placed 34th and
senior Angela Rho finished tied for 43rd.
Tee times for this year's tournament begin at 7:30
a.m. each day from the first and 10th tees.
