## U. of Iowa game cancelled over mascot controversy 
### PHIL DAVIDSON THE DAILY IOWAN 
(U-WIRE) lOWA CITY,
lowa — Adhering to a policy
instituted 10 years ago, but
not always followed, the
University of lowa athletics
department recently can
celed a baseball game with
Bradley University of Peo
ria, 111., because of the
school's mascot.

The game was originally
scheduled to be played
today, but the athletics de
partment canceled the non
conference game in Febru
ary, recognizing that
Bradley's nickname — the
Braves — falls under the
University's policy to not
schedule nonconference
games with teams that have
American Indian mascots.
Steve Roe, a UI associate

director of Sports Informa
tion, said the University's
Board in Control of Athlet
ics implemented the policy
in April 1994 in a response
to those who were outraged
by the stereotypical por
trayal of American Indians
in sports.
"At the time, that was an
issue that some universities
talked about," Roe said.
"Some acted, some didn't.

We did."
According to the policy,
"In recognition of the UI pol
icy on human rights, the Uni
versity bans from its athletics
facilities any mascot that de
picts or represents Native
Americans."
Though Bradley got rid of
its mascot in 1989, Parker said,
the UI did not have much
choice in the matter, adding
that University of Wisconsin-

Madison is the only other
school that won't schedule
games against Bradley.
The issue of using Ameri
can Indian names as mascots
or nicknames has sparked
much recent debate. Bradley
University President David
Broski announced last week
that Bradley's nickname
would remain for at least
three to five years.
According to the campus

paper, the Bradley Scout,
Broski's decision came in re
sponse to a Student Senate
resolution passed in April in
favor of finding a new mas
cot. The resolution passed in
the wake of an overwhelming
student vote not to change
the Braves' name.
At the University of Illi
nois at Urbana-Champaign,
which is not held to the Ul's
policy because of contract

and Big Ten conference
obligations, results from a
March poll show that 13,000
students — 69 percent —
voted in favor of keeping that
school's controversial Chief
Illiniwek mascot.
However, last week, Illi
nois Senate President Emil
Jones, D-Chicago, said he
would consider blocking state
funding to the University if
Chief Illiniwek is not retired.
