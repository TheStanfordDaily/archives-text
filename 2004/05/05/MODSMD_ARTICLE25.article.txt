# Colo. schools to get fixed tuition

### CHRIS KAMPFE KYLE ENDRES ROCKY MOUNTAIN COLLEGIAN 
(U-WIRE) FORT
COLLINS, Colo. â€”
Four-year college stu
dents could pay an un
changing tuition amount
every year under a bill
passed by the state legis
lature on Monday.
House Bill 1207, bar
ring Colorado Gov. Bill
Owens' veto, will allow
students to sign a con
tract upon admission to
state higher-education
institutions that would
grant them a fixed-tu
ition rate if they promise
to graduate in a certain
amount of time.
"It's to try to even out
price increases and tu
ition increases so a fami
ly can plan their budget
and say we know that for
the next four years.
We've got to come up
with this amount of
money,"' said Rick
O'Donnell, executive di

rector of the Colorado
Commission on Higher
Education.
The fixed rate would
be strictly optional for
students.
"In my own opinion,
in the way I've seen the
bill most recently,
though it hasn't passed
yet, it makes it optional
to offer these fixed-tu
ition contracts to stu
dents, and it makes it
optional for students to
participate," said Ger
ard Bomotti, vice presi
dent for Administra
tive Services.
The bill was pro
posed by Rep. Nancy
Spence, R-Centenni
ai, and co-drafted
with Ryan McMaken,
executive director of
the Colorado Student
Association.
McMaken said he be
lieves state universities
support the idea.
"It isn't a mandate,"
McMaken said. "It's
something they wanted
to do in the past."

Bomotti is wary of
implementing such con
tracts in unpredictable
economic times.
"An institution can
best offer a fixed-tuition
program over a four
year period if the envi
ronment is more stable."
Bomotti said. "Now, the
financial environment in
Colorado is not stable."
The bill's implemen
tation is contingent on
the passage of the Col
lege Opportunity Fund,
which is also awaiting
Owens' approval. This
bill would grant stipends,
or vouchers, to in-state
students for use at state
universities, rather than
universities receiving
funding directly from
the state.
Some stipend sup
porters say the College
Opportunity Fund pro
vides the opportunity
for universities to attain
enterprise status, which
would give them more fi
nancial flexibility.
Owens is expected to

approve the bill this
month, O'Donnell said.
He said the fixed-tu
ition rate would offer
students and families
more choices in paying
for college.
"Not every student or
family's going to want it,
but it was an option that
the institutions saw they
could offer that some
students would maybe
find (is) an easier way to
be able manage the cost
of college," he said.
But Sen. Peggy
Reeves, D-Larimer
County, agrees with Bo
motti that the fixed-tu
ition contract bills tim
ing is questionable.
"I think that we're in
a great state of flux with
in higher education right
now," she said. "I think
we need to implement
the college-opportunity
vouchers and under
stand how that mecha
nism works and how that
shakedown works be
fore we implement this
proposal."
