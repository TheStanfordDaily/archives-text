# Texas schools vie for Bush library

### KRYSTAL DE LOS SANTOS DAILY TEXAN 
(U-WIRE) AUSTIN,
Texas — While Baylor Uni
versity administrators have
made attempts in recent
weeks to persuade President
George W. Bush to choose
their campus as the location
for his presidential library,
University of Texas at Austin
officials said t hey have no im
mediate plans to actively
pursue it.
Texas A&M University,
Southern Methodist Uni
versity and the city of Ar
lington are also vying for
Bush's library.
U. Texas President Larry
Faulkner wrote a letter to
Bush in August 2001 sug
gesting two locations for the
library, one west of the
Pickle Research campus
and another across from the
Bob Bullock Texas State
History Museum.
"Your presidential library
will be a magnet for scholars
and for casual visitors. It will

be both an archive and a mu
seum. It needs a location
where it can have a strong, el
egant presence, but also one
where access is assured,"
Faulkner said in the letter.
Since receiving a response
from one of Bush's staff
members, "We just left it at
that," said Charles Roeckle,
Faulkner's deputy.
Baylor University has
taken a different approach.
In October. 100 Central
Texas mayors sent a letter to
Bush endorsing Baylor. A
month later, Baylor formed
a steering committee to plan
and raise funds for its efforts
to land the library. In March,
the number of mayors who
endorsed Baylor had grown
to 400.
"We feel like it would be
a great stopping-off point
from Dallas to Austin,"
said Tommye Lou Davis,
director of Baylor's Bush li
brary project.
Davis said Baylor is
also a good fit for the li
brary because the univer
sity and the president have
similar ideologies.

"We're a faith-based insti
tution and believe in his
faith-based initiatives,"
Davis said.
Baylor is prepared to
offer 150 acres of Brazos
riverfront property for the
new library.
"It would make us a
repository of history just like
UT is with the LBJ library,"
Davis said. "The confer
ences, dignitaries and sym
posia that it would bring
would be a great addition to
our campus."
Every president since
Herbert Hoover has a presi
dential library managed by
the U.S. National Archives
and Records Administration
— except Richard Nixon,
whose library is privately op
erated. said William Harris,
a spokesman for NARA's
office of presidential li
braries. NARA also over
sees the libraries' design and
construction, ensuring that
the building is fit to house
presidential documents.
Not all presidential li
braries are on university
campuses. Dwight D. Eisen

hower's library is in Abilene,
Kansas, the former presi
dent's home town.
"It's all up to the presi
dent." Harris said. "It just de
pends on who makes the best
offer and what the presi
dent's feelings are."
The Texas Rangers have
even offered to donate land
should the president decide
to locate his library in Arling
ton. Southern Methodist
University is also a likely
choice for the library because
first lady Laura Bush gradu
ated from SMU and serves
on its board of trustees.
Though Baylor seems to be
lobbying more aggressively for
the library, UT officials have
not given up on becoming the
first university to house two
presidential libraries, said Pa
tricia Ohlendorf, vice presi
dent for institutional relations
and legal affairs.
"Our letter to him is still
pending, and we expect that
when he is closer to making
a decision about the loca
tion, that we will be in touch
with his representatives,"
Ohlendorf said.
