# Post office doors broken over a month
## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
Two side doors at the
post office that have been
locked for over a month
have angered some stu
dents, but post-office offi
cials said they hope to have
them open by the end of
the week.
"The doors were com
ing off their hinges and
ready to fall off," said Jean
Biancalana, manager of
the Stanford post office.
"The reason we locked
them was so that no one
would get hurt."
The delay is attributable
to the Postal Service's "bu
reaucratic" and lengthy re
pair process, as well as a
complication in getting the
right parts.
"I'm hoping they will be
fixed within a week," Bian
calana added.
Still, some students said
they felt hindered by the

restricted access.
"It's obnoxious,"
said junior Schuyler
Ullman. "I can't tell
you how many times
I've walked to the
side door to realize it
is closed."
Other students
claimed that the
broken doors had a
broader effect than
personal inconve
nience.
"I think it's the
cause of a general de
cline in morale on
campus," posited
freshman Jarret
Guajardo. "When I
get out of a long, hard
day of class, I know I

don't feel like walking
around to the other side. It
gets to you."
Student irritation also
manifested itself in angry
and sarcastic remarks scrib
bled on a post-office sign an
nouncing that the doors

were broken. That sign was
taken down yesterday.
Most students, however,
appear to be coping with the
nuisance.
"It's not that big of a
deal to use the main
door," said freshman
Priyanka Goel.
