# District searches for superintendent
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Ravenswood School
District's search fora new
superintendent has entered
its last stages, as school
board members interview
finalists competing to fill the
position. Current Superin
tendent Floyd Gonella will
leave the position when his
contract expires at the end
of June.
The Ravenswood ad
ministration has long been
a target of controversy. Pre
vious Superintendent Char
lie Mae Knight's 17-year
tenure was fraught with dif
ficulties, including near
bankruptcy and state
takeover. An assistant was
also charged with the mis
use and embezzlement of
school funds.
In an effort to improve
the district and its reputa
tion, Gonella was hired as
Knight's replacement in
December 2002. During
his 18-month stay. Gonel
la has been credited with
fiscally stabilizing the
school district.
According to Gonella,

although the new superinten
dent will lie taking the reins of
a more financially stable
school system, he or she still
has to work to improve in
struction for the 3.000-plus
student population.
"It is up to the new su
perintendent to expand
upon the level of education
in the Ravenswood dis
trict," Gonella said. "We
need to raise test scores as
well as improve reading and
writing skills."
However, a lack of ade
quate funds means that the
Ravenswood Board cannot
offer a competitive salary
when compared with other
school districts.
In an interview with the
San Jose Mercury News,
Ravenswood School Board
President Todd Gaviglio
discussed the effect the low
funds were having on the
job search.
"The underlying conun
drum is that those children
that need the best leader
are often in those districts
that are least able to afford
one," Gaviglio said. "It re-
mains to he seen what kind of pack
age we can get together to attract a
top-tier candidate. We want to get
someone who can lead and inspire
the whole community. A lot rides
on this."
Currently, the board is asking
various foundations to help cover
the extra cost.
The search fora new superinten

dent also affects Stanford students
who — through service and tutoring
programs such as Ravenswood
Reads — regularly volunteer with
children in the school district.
Over the years, Ravenswood
Reads has been well received by
Ravenswood students and ad
ministrators, and the tutors said
they hope that the new superin
tendent will continue to support
the program.
"'The Ravenswood City School
District is our community partner,
so the selection of a new superinten
dent is of great importance to us,"

said Ravenswood Reads Director
Jesse Moya. "We hope that the new
superintendent will he able to effec
tively lead the district towards meet
ing its stated mission of providing all
the district's children with a quality
educational program."
Senior Sonali Murarka, one
of the program's tutoring coordi
nators, worked with some of
the schools in East Palo Alto dur
ing the corruption scandal. She
said that the district's students
were not significantly impacted
hy the scandal.
"1 believe a large part of this can

be attributed to the fact that most of
the administration and teachers at
the schools work extremely hard
and are very dedicated to providing
high quality education for their stu
dents," Murarka said.
Despite the district's many prob
lems, Gonella said he remains opti
mistic about its future.
"Ravenswood has a lot of great
people," he said. "The kids are won
derful, and the parents only want
the best for their children. The dis
trict has come a long way, and hope
fully it will continue to grow and
make progress."
