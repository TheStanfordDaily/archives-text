The week-long "Mind,
Body and Soul of Palestine"
exhibit — designed to show
the mood, emotions and cul
ture of the Palestinian peo
ple through photographs —
arrived on the second floor
of Tresidder on Monday.
"We essentially want to
shed light on the Palestin
ian essence in a way that
hasn't been done before at
Stanford," said sophomore
Tanya Haj-Hassan, who
organized the display of
the exhibition at Stanford.
"We want to open the eyes
of the Stanford population
to the spirit of a vibrant
people and culture in the
context of their unique his
tory through these beauti
ful photographs."
The exhibit consists of 12
photos — those represent
ing the "mind" of Palestine
are designed to reflect the
everyday life of the ordinary
Palestinian citizen; the pho
tos representing the "body"
are meant to convey the
uniqueness and historical
significance of the Palestin
ian landscape; and the pho

tos representing Palestine's
"soul" show the struggle the
Palestinian people have un
dertaken in their quest for
self-determination.
"When people look at
Palestine, they often over
look the amazing culture
and beautiful landscape that

exists there," Haj-Hassan
said. "We hope this exhibi
tion shows students the
human side of the Palestin
ian people."
