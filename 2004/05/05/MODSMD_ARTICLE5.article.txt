The week-long "Mind,
Body and Soul of Palestine"
exhibit — designed to show
the mood, emotions and cul
ture of the Palestinian peo
ple through photographs —
arrived on the second floor
of Tresidder on Monday.
"We essentially want to
shed light on the Palestin
ian essence in a way that
hasn't been done before at
Stanford," said sophomore
Tanya Haj-Hassan, who
organized the display of
the exhibition at Stanford.
"We want to open the eyes
of the Stanford population
to the spirit of a vibrant
people and culture in the
context of their unique his
tory through these beauti
ful photographs."
The exhibit consists of 12
photos — those represent
ing the "mind" of Palestine
are designed to reflect the
everyday life of the ordinary
Palestinian citizen; the pho
tos representing the "body"
are meant to convey the
uniqueness and historical
significance of the Palestin
ian landscape; and the pho

tos representing Palestine's
"soul" show the struggle the
Palestinian people have un
dertaken in their quest for
self-determination.
"When people look at
Palestine, they often over
look the amazing culture
and beautiful landscape that

exists there," Haj-Hassan
said. "We hope this exhibi
tion shows students the
human side of the Palestin
ian people."

ney, all renowned for their work.
The exhibit is organized by Al-
PHAN (Palestinian Humanities and
Arts Now), a not-for-profit organi
zation dedicated to promoting
Palestinian artists. The "Mind, Body

and Soul" display has traveled
throughout the United States since
January 2003. On campus, the Mus
lim Students Awareness network
(MS AN) is running the exhibit.
"The organizers of AI-PHAN
said that this exhibit has been one of
the bright spots of their movement
to make people aware of the Pales
tinian culture and history," Haj-
Hassan said.
The exhibition kicks off the start

of Palestinian Awareness Month.
Part of the exhibition's purpose is to
show Stanford students a new di
mension of Palestinian life.
"Few people — especially at
Stanford — acknowledge and un
derstand the Palestinian culture,"
Haj-Hassan said. "Sadly, it is a cul
ture that is being devastated."
Haj-Hassan added that MSAN
does not intend for the pictures to
generate any sort of controversy.

"The photos are designed to
show the truth,"he said. "It's hard
to talk to about the Palestinian
people and ignore what they are
going through."
MSAN member Omar Shakir, a
freshman, predicted that the Stan
ford community would react posi
tively to the exhibition.
" It should open people's eyes and
show them the human side of this
conflict," he said.
