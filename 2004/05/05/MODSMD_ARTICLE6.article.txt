# Mountain lion cannot be hunted with guns
## Law prohibits use of firearms on preserve 
### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
In the event that a mountain
lion was responsible for the in
jury of two horses on Stanford
property in the past two weeks,
firearms will not be used to cap
ture or kill it. Senior Assistant to
the President Jeff Wachtel an
nounced yesterday.
"It's our intention to not have
firearms here or anywhere on
campus," Wachtel said from the
Stanford Ave. entrance to the
Dish. "We don't want people
deputized to go out and hunt on
our campus."
In 1916, the Stanford Board
of Trustees passed a resolution
making the land on which the
horses were injured a preserve,
and in 1927 the state legislature

turned the resolution into law,
prohibiting any hunting on the
land. Wachtel said that the land
is a preserve because it is a place
of research, but "more impor
tant than that," he said, "is the
issue of safety."
Despite the fact that the in
juries to both horses were char
acteristic of a mountain lion at
tack, it is still unclear whether or
not a mountain lion is responsi
ble for the injuries. A tuft of hair
found caught on barbed wire
after the second incident is cur
rently being analyzed in an at
tempt to confirm the attack.
"We're waiting for the test to
come back on this hair sample,"
Wachtel said. "We don't know if
it's a lion at all. We heard that
they usually pray on smaller ani
mals, so that raised questions in
people's minds."
For the time being, Stanford
officials are collaborating with
the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment, the Department of Fish
and Game and other local au
thorities to keep the area safe.
"We're still trying to figure
this out, but we want to proceed
with caution," Wachtel said.
