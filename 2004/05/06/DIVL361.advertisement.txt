lications Building for the purpose of electing the President of the Corporation and members of
the Board of Directors.
To THE JERK-OFF FRAT BOY WHO TOOK ONE OF THE DAILY'S GOLF CARTS LAST NIGHT:
Congratulations, you got the cart and didn't get caught. Now I have one
REQUEST FOR YOU. RUN AND HIDE, ASSHOLE. RUN AND HIDE. IF YOU SHOULD BE PICKED
UP NEXT WEEK LIFTING A CART FROM 5-SURE, I AM GOING TO BE SUPREMELY
DISAPPOINTED. BECAUSE I WANT MY PEOPLE TO FIND YOU, AND WHEN THEY DO, REST
ASSURED WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAND YOU OVER TO THE POLICE.
SO, MY ADVICE TO YOU AGAIN IS THIS. RUN AND HIDE.
