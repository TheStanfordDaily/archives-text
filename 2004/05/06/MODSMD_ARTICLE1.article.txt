### JASON FLANNICK 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) elected Moriah Thomason,
a graduate student in neuro
sciences, to be its new chair last
night. Thomason served last year
as the School of Medicine repre
sentative; she said she wants to
raise awareness of the GSC and ad
vocate for an independent GSC
trust. Thomason beat Roger Stan
ley, a student at the Graduate
School of Business and the School
of Education.
"It is great to see the new face of
the new GSC, feel the developing
energy and share with the new
GSC the accomplishment and pas
sion of the outgoing GSC,"
Thomason said. "I feel lucky to be
walking this bridge from one gen
eration to the next."
Thomason's said her chief
goal as chair will be to promote
awareness of the GSC through
the new Graduate Community
Center (GCC), scheduled to open
in September.
"One of our major goals can be
to make the presence of the GSC
more known and develop our pro
gramming arm," Thomason said.
"We're in a strategic position to be
able to do that because we have a
huge building opening."
Thomason also plans to focus
on financial goals and communi
cating to Stanford's development
office the GSC's desire for an inde
pendent trust. However, the suc
cess of the GCC remains the most
visible goal.
"We have to make this building
successful," Thomason said. "We
have to make it a place where stu
dents want to come to. That's
going to mean advocating for de
tails. A lot of graduate students
don't even know where that build
ing is right now."
Outgoing GSC chair Steve Alli
son, a doctoral student in biologi
cal sciences, expressed his confi
dence in Thomason.
"I have utmost confidence in
Moriah and extreme faith that
she'll do a wonderful job," Alli
son said. "She's extremely qual
ified and excited about being
chair and I think we have her
full commitment."

For Allison, last night sig
naled the end of his tenure as
chair. He, too, cited the GCC as a
major accomplishment.
"In particular, the GCC is the
highlight of my term, although
that's a part of a very long ongo
ing effort of many GSCs," Alli
son said. "I measure my accom
plishments as accomplishments
for the whole group. Hopefully
there are some exciting things
that will happen as a part of Mo
riah's term as a result of what
we've accomplished."
Allison said that it was unusual
for two GSC members to run for
the position of chair.
"The chair position is a big re
sponsibility," Allison said. "It's not
common that you have two people
who are that dedicated and excited
about taking on that responsibility."
The opposing candidate,
Stanley, said he supports Thoma
son fully.
"I felt that regardless of how the
election turned out it was going to
be good for the GSC," Stanley
said. "I'm ultimately confident in
Moriah's ability and happy to serve
with her as the chair. She's going to
be a great chair."
According to Thomason, first
on her agenda is meeting with the
administration and creating a
roadmap for the year ahead.
"What I have to do is step
back and create priorities with
the new GSC," she said. "We've
come up with a very long list of
goals this year; we need to com
mit to what the most important
items are. We should start acting
on those because chances are
that they'll take longer than any
of us imagine."
However, Thomason said she
knows that her foremost responsi
bility is to represent graduate stu
dents as best she can.
"I want to encourage gradu
ate students to become a part of
the graduate community by
contributing their desires, im
pressions and goals because re
ally our job as the GSC is ulti
mately to support them," she
said. "Unless students come
forward and say what they actu
ally care about, I may never
learn about it."

about taking on that responsibility."
The opposing candidate,
Stanley, said he supports Thoma
son fully.
"I felt that regardless of how the
election turned out it was going to
be good for the GSC," Stanley
said. "I'm ultimately confident in
Moriah's ability and happy to serve
with her as the chair. She's going to
be a great chair."
According to Thomason, first
on her agenda is meeting with the
administration and creating a
roadmap for the year ahead.
"What I have to do is step
back and create priorities with
the new GSC," she said. "We've
come up with a very long list of
goals this year; we need to com
mit to what the most important
items are. We should start acting
on those because chances are
that they'll take longer than any
of us imagine."
However, Thomason said she
knows that her foremost responsi
bility is to represent graduate stu
dents as best she can.
"I want to encourage gradu
ate students to become a part of
the graduate community by
contributing their desires, im
pressions and goals because re
ally our job as the GSC is ulti
mately to support them," she
said. "Unless students come
forward and say what they actu
ally care about, I may never
learn about it."
