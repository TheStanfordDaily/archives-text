### 
Yoga classes are offered in
many types of styles, levels
— even temperatures. Trying
out different classes will help you
find the type of yoga that spits your
own style. The yoga centers listed
below offer some or all of these
styles. Here's how to navigate
through your yoga class schedule:
»
I •
Anusara: Founded by John Friend
in 1997, Anusara, which means
"going with the flow," combines
an awareness with alignment of
the body with a philosophy to re
connect with the spiritual part of
yoga. Deep relaxation at tne end
of trie practice is included to allow
the student to reflect on the con
nections made between the mind
and the body.
Vinyasa: Also known as "flow
yoga." is a series of poses com
bined with synchronized breath
ing (known as the pranayama).
Students often repeat "sun saluta
tions" with different variations in
order to brina energy to different
types of the body. Vinyasa is a
great option for those who are
looking for an energy-intense
workout and who want to build en
durance and strength.
Ashtanga: A powerful yoga
practice, Ashtanga is much like
Vinyasa yoga except that each

yoga practice is nearly identical,
following what is known as the
Primary Series of poses, followed
by the Secondary Series. Ashtan
ga is not recommended for be
ginners. as it requires much
strength, flexibility and en
durance, as well as familiarity
with all of the poses, all whicn
come from practice from other
forms of yoga.
Iyengar: A style of yoga founded
by well-known yoga master. B.K.S.
Iyengar, Iyengar yoga focuses
heavily on alignment. Iyengar
classes often use props such as
foam blocks and cotton straps to
help students achieve the most har
monious alignment with their bod
ies and avoid injury. Practicing
Iyengar yoga is a good way to
master the poses before moving on
to the faster-paced Vinyasa or
Ashtanga styles.
Bikram: The "hot" style of yoga.
A specific series of poses is prac
ticed in a room heated to 104 de
grees. The heat allows many stu
dents to achieve maximum flexi
bility. Bring ample amounts of
water to a Bikram class and know
your limits — pushing your body
too hard in heated conditions can
be dangerous.
