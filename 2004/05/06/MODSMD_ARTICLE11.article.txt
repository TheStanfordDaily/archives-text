# Venturing off-campus to get your yoga fix
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Having practiced yoga for several years now I've
taken a sampling of classes to find my preferred stu
dios around Palo Alto. Every person has a different
opinion of what makes fora 'great" yoga class, but
most agree on certain aspects: A class should not be
overly crowded, allowing the instructor to pay atten
tion to each student and correct poor alignment; a
yoga instructor should ask everyone in the class if they
nave a specific injury, so as to avoid poses that may ex
acerbate the problem; and an instructor should never
pressure a student into doing a pose she or he is un
comfortable doing. Here are my picks for the best
yoga centers around the area:
Avalon Yoga
With a full range of classes, from a soothing restorative
class to what has been deemed "one of the hardest yoga
classes in the Bay Area," Avalon is a beautiful and
peaceful place to practice yoga. The vinyasa class of
fered on Tuesday and Thursday nights is one of my fa
vorite classes at Avalon. A drop-in class costs $15, but

you can buy a five class pass or a 10-class pass and
save. Ask for the student discount — they've offered a
10 percent discount in the past.
370 California Ave. Palo Alto. (650) 324-2517.
Yoga Source
The classes offered in this studio are fairly intense.
The bikram and power yoga classes are strenuous
and are a guaranteed good workout — if you can
make it through them. Drop-in classes cost $15, but
students can purchase a 1 J class pass for $1 20.
158 Hamilton Ave. Palo Alto. (650) 328-9642.
California Yoga Center
A studio focused on the Iyengar tradition, the Cali
fornia Yoga Center features many levels of classes for
the ultimate beginner to the yoga master. Ann Merlo
— who teaches an intermediate level class at Stan
ford — teaches a great multi-level class on Tuesday
and Thursday nights. Drop-in classes cost $17 ana
an eight class pass costs $112.
