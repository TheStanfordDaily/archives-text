## Another election mistake 
### 
The controversy surrounding the ASSU execu
tive election has largely overshadowed the ef
fects of another mishandled election in the
Graduate Student Council. No, the GSC will not
be holding a re-election. Still, a serious mistake was made,
and a candidate had a legitimate complaint that it may
have affected her chances of being elected. If such inci
dents can provide any kind of lesson, it is the importance
of having clear procedures that candidates and election of
ficials thoroughly understand before the elections start.
Unlike the Undergraduate Senate, GSC candidates
are voted into office by district, so whether a candidate is
from the Graduate School of Business or the School of
Humanities and Sciences is an important distinction. The
Elections Commission and current GSC Chair Steve Alli
son made the unfortunate error of listing Victoria Stod
den, a graduate student in statistics, as a candidate in the
social sciences district on the ballot. Statistics is considered
a natural science, and Stodden, for reasons that may or
may not have been related to the error, lost the election.
For their part, Allison and the Elections Commission
made an honest mistake, in contrast to some of the more
questionable campaign activities associated with the
ASSU executive election. Allison, knowing he was unsure
about some of the districts, sent out an e-mail to all the can-

didates asking them to verify that they had been placed in
the right districts. Although it would have been ideal if the
candidates had looked more closely at this e-mail, the re
sponsibility for an accurate ballot does not ultimately rest
with them. The Elections Commission especially should
have realized the importance of the getting the districts
correct and spent more time analyzing the ballot.
There is no such thing as a perfect election. However,
this year the ASSU had an especially hard time producing
uncontroversial results. When things like the ASSU exec
utive election controversy and the GSC misunderstanding
occur, it is not always necessary to automatically reject the
results — and in the GSC case, we agree with Allison that
certification was warranted. That's especially true since the
problem could have been avoided had Stodden followed
Allison's suggestion and double-checked the ballot's accu
racy. Regrettable as her situation was, spending weeks and
months squabbling over a re-election would have done far
more harm than good. Rather, the proper course of action
is to go back to the election rules and procedures, find out
where the problems lie and fix them for next time.
Most importantly, everyone involved in the elections
should make sure they know what they can and cannot do
and what needs to be double-checked — regardless of
who is officially responsible.
