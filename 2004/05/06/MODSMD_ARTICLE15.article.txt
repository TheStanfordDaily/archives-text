# THE
						BROOKLYN BRAT
## Draw-number judgment day 
### 
Your roommate just joined a
housed sorority, your best
friend is going abroad fall
quarter and you're stuck in
a Draw group with three people from
your hall who you've only spoken to
twice all year. F6r you, today is the
most important day of the year. If you
haven't already logged into Axess
three times to see whether your Draw
number has been posted yet, you're
probably camped out in front of your
housing office waiting for the list to be
taped to the wall.
As much as people try to downplay
the importance of getting a good
Draw number, and as often as Red Ed
says "there is no such thing as bad
housing at Stanford," the truth re
mains that where you live may very
well affect the rest of your life — or at
least a year of it.
I'm not saying that if you didn't
draw under 50 and can't live in Bob or
Xanadu that you might as well spend
next quarter in Chile. As it turns out,
living on the Row isn't necessarily the
best choice. Having drawn into 557 as
a sophomore, I am happy that my year
of weekly hashing, post*party clean
ups and fighting over the house's one
washing machine is over. Sure, living
across a parking lot from all the frat
houses made it easy to walk to a party
in a tank top and mini skirt at mid
night, but now that I have 5-SURE on
speed dial, even that is not a concern.
When it comes to housing, Stan
ford does actually have a lot of choic
es. There's Manzanita Park if you like

to be left alone, Roble and the other
four-class dorms if you like freshmen
and co-ops if you like drinking out of

jars and baking
bread — naked.
But it seems to
me that all of this
diversity in hous
ing just goes to
determine social
circles for the up
coming year.
Is it that all of
the cool kids hap
pen to draw well

enough to live on the lower Row, or
does living in a house across the street
from Sigma Chi automatically make
you a cool kid?
I would have to say the latter, be
cause everyone who lives on the Row
inevitably makes up the "Party 500"
— Stanford's version of the popular
table from high school. Even if these
guys called SLE and FroSoCo home
when they were freshmen, living in the
prime party spots all of a sudden gives
them control of the all-powerful in
vite-only lists. In the end, you either
need to live on the Row or be sleeping
with someone on the Row to be able
to get in anywhere between Wednes
day and Saturday nights.
Once all of the spots on the Row
are filled, housing is pretty much
downhill in terms of social opportuni
ty. Nevertheless, even the most anti
social of residences can have their
benefits. Rumor has it that most ath
letes live in Mirrielees, so even if

you're a mile away from the Quad,
you're hound to share an elevator with
someone who has been on ESPN. If
that's the sort of thing that excites you,
it might just be worth it.
If you drew above 2,500 and are
looking at a year in Wilbur or Stern,
there is still a very slim silver lining for
you. While the rooms are small, the
buildings are made with cinderblock
and there is no respectable patch of
grass for "laying out," at least you get
stellar all-you-can-eat brunches on
weekends (for the mornings after not
being invited to any parties on the
Row). And of course there is the com
forting knowledge that even a year
sandwiched in between freshman
dorms is not as bad as being banished
to the furthest ends of campus and
having to live in Robinson or Potter.
As for the finer details of in-house
draws, just remember that two-room
doubles are overrated, one-room dou
bles are worse and it never pays to live
next to the guys with a new subwoofer
to show off. Aside from that, if you get
really desperate, before you decide to
run home and spend the quarter living
with Mom and Dad, remember that
you can always adopt a living partner
(i.e. pretend to be gay) and live in Es
condido Village and party it up with
the grad students.
