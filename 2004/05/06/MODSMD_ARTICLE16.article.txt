## Circus: an election retrospective 
### 
As both of my regular read
ers know, I suggested a
few weeks ago that the
ASSU elections would be
way more exciting if, instead of having
students vote for qualified candidates,
chimpanzees vied for positions by per
forming outrageous feats of stupidity.
Little did I expect that my suggestions
would be immediately implemented.
That's the kind of responsive govern
ment 1 can get behind.
For anyone who hasn't been fol
lowing the rolling barrel of monkeys
that has been this year's election, I
thought I'd use this week's column to
give readers a look back at the major
events of the campaign season: *
Tuesday, April 6: Candidates de
bate campaign issues at the CoHo. Lee
/ Mefford stresses commitment to
working with the administration, while
Husbands / Schwartz focuses on stu
dent diversity issues. Despite being
originally told the debate was being
held in the broom closet in the base
ment of Varian, the Chappie slate also
makes an appearance.
Wednesday, April 7: In a turn of
events that rivals Watergate, former
ASSU vice president Nick Rodriguez
sends an e-mail to a bunch of his fellow
students. This outrageous e-mail in
cludes blatantly inflammatory lan
guage, such as "What we have in this
election are two slates that are both
qualified and committed to similar ob
jectives," and "Decide whose ideas
you like best, and vote at ballot.stan
ford.edu." Clearly an e-mail intended
to incite outrage. .
Thursday, April 8: Students are in
formed by The Daily that they have
been rocked by election scandal, much

to their chagrin. Expecting to hear that
Mikey Lee has buried an intern in the
desert or that Ajani Husbands accept
ed an under-the-table donation from
NAMBLA, students are disappointed
to learn that just about any damn thing
constitutes a shocking election devel
opment around this place. Oh, the
horrors of unsolicited e-mail.
Friday, April 9: The Lee / Mefford
slate is announced as having won the
general election, and the ASSU Elec
tions Commission recommends that
the election be certified. Analysts fa
miliar with the Commission report that
this recommendation followed a
lengthy debate that culminated with
the eloquent conclusion, "Hey, it's just
the ASSU â€”What the hell."
Tuesday, April 20: In an exercise of
sheer legislative power reminiscent of
the time they gave away ice cream in
White Plaza, the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate votes not to certify the elec
tion. A student body mesmerized by
the possibility of watching the ASSU
violently implode fora second time ap
plauds the bold move.
Wednesday, April 21: Something
important probably happened on this
day, but between trolling Internet chat
rooms for column ideas and watching
11 episodes of Law and Order on the
Tivo, I'll be damned if I caught it.
Thursday, April 22: Referring to
him as "the Garfunkel to my Simon,"
Mikey Lee announces that Dylan Mef
ford will not be joining him in the spe
cial election. In an even more shocking
maneuver, the two ordinary slates that
ran in the first election combine to
form a Lee / Schwartz super-slate, ca
pable of campaign violations that pre
vious candidates could only dream

about. Meanwhile, the Chappie slate
remains intact and irrelevant.
Monday, May 3: Proving once and
for all that some people just can't resist
getting involved in mass idiocy, three
new slates enter the ASSU special
election. When asked why anyone
would want to be a part of such a mess,
one candidate responded anonymous
ly: "Well, my mom's always bitching at
me to get involved in some extra-cur
riculars, and it was either this or Taiko.
Banging those drums seemed like a lot
of work, so I decided to take the easy
way out."
Tuesday, May 4: Worried that
someone on campus didn't yet consid
er the ASSU a laughingstock, the
ASSU Constitutional Council orders
the Senate to reconsider their non-cer
tification of the first election. Next on
their agenda? A vote to consider form
ing an executive committee tasked
with considering whether the Senate
should re-evaluate its decision to name
May 8 "Stanford O-Tip Day."
How is this saga going to end? I'll be
damned if 1 know. 1 can tell you one
thing with absolute certainty, though:
If this thing gets any sillier, we might as
well replace the whole damn system
with dogs wearing clown suits while
playing calliopes. At least then I'd be
able to explain my school's govern
ment to friends at other schools with a
straight face.
