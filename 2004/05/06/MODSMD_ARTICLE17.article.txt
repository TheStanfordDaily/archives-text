Iraqi prison abuses shatter pride in
American troops
For the first time tonight, I tracked
down the photos of the prisoners
abased by the American army in the
Iraqi prison of Abu Ghraib. They make
me want to cry. Despite my disagree
ment on many fronts with the war in
Iraq and with the Bush administration's
handling of foreign policy, I can still
manage to feel pride in the fact that we
have many thousands of young Ameri
cans willing to fight when the govern
ment of their country asks them to.
And while I think that our military
should not be in Iraq, I can be com
fortable in certain ways with the war
because I am confident that our mili
tary and our soldiers conduct war in as
responsible a manner as any military
on the planet, and perhaps as responsi
bly as any decisively powerful military
in history.

But seeing Iraqi men forced into a
naked mass of bodies, their heads cov
ered in plastic bags, while American
soldiers wearing American fatigues
grin proudly — this makes me cry with
shame. Seeing an Iraqi man standing
naked on a box, his head also covered
in a plastic bag and his body connected
to wires while forced (according to re
ports) to remain on the box lest he fall
off and the wires electrocute him —
this makes me cry with shame.
I could say plenty about the truly
awful pragmatic consequences that
such photographs will have globally
and particularly among the (rightfully
outraged) Arab world. And I could say
plenty about my dark fear that such
shameful atrocities are not, as Colin
Powell and other members of the Bush
administration maintain, isolated acts,
but are rather part of a series that could
only occur in a military culture that
would shatter any of the proud feelings

I expressed above.
It is more important today, though,
that I express the most poignant and
deepest shame as an American that I
have yet to feel in my 22 years.

Graduate Student, French
Letter loaded with false claims
Joe Webb's letter to the editor in
The Stanford Daily on May 3 ("Anti-
Semitism to become illegal") is both
shocking and angering given that it is
loaded with false claims about the inci
dent on campus and contains mislead
ing, if not preposterous, conclusions.
I was standing in line fora falafel in
White Plaza as the event Webb de
scribed unfolded five feet away from
me. Webb was parading through the
middle of the plaza, contrary to the
other peaceful protesters who were

standing in the area accorded to
protesters right next to the main event.
Apparently seeking out controver
sy, Webb walked in between the stu
dents in the plaza, chanting inflamma
tory remarks. When a student verbally
responded to Webb, a heated discus
sion ensued, but there was no physical
contact whatsoever between Webb
and the student, contrary to Webbs
claim in his letter.
It should also be pointed out that
Webb carried a sign with a swastika
during the parade, in contrast to the
other protesters, who chose to show
their support for the Palestinian state
and their disapproval of the Israeli cel
ebration while refraining from evoking
Nazism and racism in its most egre
gious form.
Webb, a community member seem
ingly unconnected with Stanford, clear
ly went out of his way to provoke and
incite. He could have learned somc

thing from the students present, where
members from both sides who are also
part of the Stanford interfaith council
talked peacefully, as at least colleagues
and perhaps friends, during the event.
Lastly, the conclusions that Webb
draws out of his fabricated tale are
ridiculous. This incident, even as de
scribed, comes far from demonstrating
that "a loss of liberties is around the
corner." His reference to a Holocaust
"revisionist" is unrelated to anything
else he has to say, and this term is only
used by those who deny that the Holo
caust occurred, a preposterous claim.
Webb should also learn a bit more
about the legal systems in European
countries such as Germany and
France, and consider the history under
lying their laws, before bemoaning
these countries policies. Lastly, while
making an effort to get his facts straight
in the future, Webb might also consid
er sparing us his unfounded doomsday

predictions and scare tactics.

Daily should not have
publisned offensive letter
Try as I might to feel proud at hav
ing published a letter in The Daily,
well, Joe Webb got published too. Now
that The Daily has lowered the bar by
achieving journalistic balance between
anti-Semites and Jews, what is next? A
published debate between Ujamaa
and the KKK?
The Fundamental Standard does
not apply to Webb, who is not, as far as
anyone can tell, a Stanford student.
However, it does apply to the Daily
editors. Perhaps the editors were sim
ply trying to show the full range of
opinion extant on campus. I would
hope that tomorrow's issue will con
tain an apology by the editorial staff to
those that they have offended with
their poor judgment.

Mountain lion should not be killed
This is in response to the article on
the cougar on Stanford campus in this
morning's newspaper. I was surprised,
disappointed and somewhat angered
to read that such an established univer
sity would view killing the animal (if it
were even possible to determine that
specific mountain lion from others) as
the only option to solve this dilemma.
I would expect the University to take
advantage of something like this and re

search the animal and learn about what
we are living with — track it or some
thing and find out how to make it possi
ble for us to live together. Despite what
some think, it is possible for us to coex
ist with these types of animals.
1 think that Stanford needs to hu
manely capture the animal and send it
to a wildlife preserve somewhere. It is
not necessary to kill this animal, and I
would also expect Stanford to care
about what kind of image they are pro
jecting. Killing the animal would defi
nitely turn some people away.
And although this is a different situ
ation, if it was a human who mauled
these two horses, there would be no
hunt to kill the human. There would
only be a court case with little punish
ment, if a court case at all. This kind of
cruelty happens so often with other an
imals and with animal testing, it's not
necessary and it's not practical to just
kill the mountain lion. I hope that the
University will make the right decision.

Officers' behavior is hypocritical
This letter is in response to Robert
Finn's letter to the editor yesterday
with the heading "Column displayed
disregard for law, safety." Prof.
Robert Finn is right: Bicyclists at
Stanford ride with a disregard for mo
torists and others, and it's a big prob
lem, both for safety and for the flow
of traffic.
Flowever, Prof. Finn ought to real
ize something else: The very same
Stanford police officers he commends
for their ability to uphold the rule of
law by valiantly writing citations are
the police officers I see rolling through
stop signs on a daily basis.
These are the same police officers I
see encamped alongside the Stern
parking lot hoping to catch a student in
an incomplete stop, only to engage in
DiMaggio-like streaks of countless
consecutive rolling stops themselves.
I've even seen police officers ap
proach the four-way stop at Escondi
do Road, where another car is already
stopped at the cross street, and stick

their arms out of the window, motion
ing for the other car to stay put, as they
usurp the right of way and leisurely
coast through the intersection.
It's not as if these are emergencies;
sirens are never blaring, and the police
cars never exceed their apparently
government-mandated maximum
speed of 20 miles per hour. Many times
they're just returning to the station,
that is, if they're not busy tailgating stu
dent drivers in hopes of inducing a
minor ticketable offense.
It's the same case of hypocritical ir
responsibility as when I see a Student
Housing van parked in the fire lane
right next to an empty, reserved Service
Vehicle spot.
If Stanford officials honestly believe
that the irresponsible behavior of bik
ers and motorists around campus is
such a grave danger and they want to
lay down the law, no exceptions grant
ed, maybe they should try setting a bet
ter example first.

Iraqi prison abuses shatter pride in
American troops
For the first time tonight, I tracked
down the photos of the prisoners
abased by the American army in the
Iraqi prison of Abu Ghraib. They make
me want to cry. Despite my disagree
ment on many fronts with the war in
Iraq and with the Bush administration's
handling of foreign policy, I can still
manage to feel pride in the fact that we
have many thousands of young Ameri
cans willing to fight when the govern
ment of their country asks them to.
And while I think that our military
should not be in Iraq, I can be com
fortable in certain ways with the war
because I am confident that our mili
tary and our soldiers conduct war in as
responsible a manner as any military
on the planet, and perhaps as responsi
bly as any decisively powerful military
in history.

But seeing Iraqi men forced into a
naked mass of bodies, their heads cov
ered in plastic bags, while American
soldiers wearing American fatigues
grin proudly — this makes me cry with
shame. Seeing an Iraqi man standing
naked on a box, his head also covered
in a plastic bag and his body connected
to wires while forced (according to re
ports) to remain on the box lest he fall
off and the wires electrocute him —
this makes me cry with shame.
I could say plenty about the truly
awful pragmatic consequences that
such photographs will have globally
and particularly among the (rightfully
outraged) Arab world. And I could say
plenty about my dark fear that such
shameful atrocities are not, as Colin
Powell and other members of the Bush
administration maintain, isolated acts,
but are rather part of a series that could
only occur in a military culture that
would shatter any of the proud feelings

I expressed above.
It is more important today, though,
that I express the most poignant and
deepest shame as an American that I
have yet to feel in my 22 years.

Mountain lion should not be killed
This is in response to the article on

morning's newspaper. I was surprised,
disappointed and somewhat angered
to read that such an established univer
sity would view killing the animal (if it
were even possible to determine that
specific mountain lion from others) as
the only option to solve this dilemma.
I would expect the University to take
advantage of something like this and re

search the animal and learn about what
we are living with — track it or some
thing and find out how to make it possi
ble for us to live together. Despite what
some think, it is possible for us to coex
ist with these types of animals.
1 think that Stanford needs to hu
manely capture the animal and send it
to a wildlife preserve somewhere. It is
not necessary to kill this animal, and I
would also expect Stanford to care
about what kind of image they are pro
jecting. Killing the animal would defi
nitely turn some people away.
And although this is a different situ
ation, if it was a human who mauled
these two horses, there would be no
hunt to kill the human. There would
only be a court case with little punish
ment, if a court case at all. This kind of
cruelty happens so often with other an

these countries policies. Lastly, while
making an effort to get his facts straight
in the future, Webb might also consid
er sparing us his unfounded doomsday

predictions and scare tactics.

Daily should not have
publisned offensive letter
Try as I might to feel proud at hav
ing published a letter in The Daily,
well, Joe Webb got published too. Now
that The Daily has lowered the bar by
achieving journalistic balance between
anti-Semites and Jews, what is next? A
published debate between Ujamaa
and the KKK?
The Fundamental Standard does
not apply to Webb, who is not, as far as
anyone can tell, a Stanford student.
However, it does apply to the Daily
editors. Perhaps the editors were sim
ply trying to show the full range of
opinion extant on campus. I would
hope that tomorrow's issue will con
tain an apology by the editorial staff to
those that they have offended with
their poor judgment.

Mountain lion should not be killed
This is in response to the article on
the cougar on Stanford campus in this
morning's newspaper. I was surprised,
disappointed and somewhat angered
to read that such an established univer
sity would view killing the animal (if it
were even possible to determine that
specific mountain lion from others) as
the only option to solve this dilemma.
I would expect the University to take
advantage of something like this and re

search the animal and learn about what
we are living with — track it or some
thing and find out how to make it possi
ble for us to live together. Despite what
some think, it is possible for us to coex
ist with these types of animals.
1 think that Stanford needs to hu
manely capture the animal and send it
to a wildlife preserve somewhere. It is
not necessary to kill this animal, and I
would also expect Stanford to care
about what kind of image they are pro
jecting. Killing the animal would defi
nitely turn some people away.
And although this is a different situ
ation, if it was a human who mauled
these two horses, there would be no
hunt to kill the human. There would
only be a court case with little punish
ment, if a court case at all. This kind of
cruelty happens so often with other an
imals and with animal testing, it's not
necessary and it's not practical to just
kill the mountain lion. I hope that the
University will make the right decision.

Officers' behavior is hypocritical
This letter is in response to Robert
Finn's letter to the editor yesterday
with the heading "Column displayed
disregard for law, safety." Prof.
Robert Finn is right: Bicyclists at
Stanford ride with a disregard for mo
torists and others, and it's a big prob
lem, both for safety and for the flow
of traffic.
Flowever, Prof. Finn ought to real
ize something else: The very same
Stanford police officers he commends
for their ability to uphold the rule of
law by valiantly writing citations are
the police officers I see rolling through
stop signs on a daily basis.
These are the same police officers I
see encamped alongside the Stern
parking lot hoping to catch a student in
an incomplete stop, only to engage in
DiMaggio-like streaks of countless
consecutive rolling stops themselves.
I've even seen police officers ap
proach the four-way stop at Escondi
do Road, where another car is already
stopped at the cross street, and stick

their arms out of the window, motion
ing for the other car to stay put, as they
usurp the right of way and leisurely
coast through the intersection.
It's not as if these are emergencies;
sirens are never blaring, and the police
cars never exceed their apparently
government-mandated maximum
speed of 20 miles per hour. Many times
they're just returning to the station,
that is, if they're not busy tailgating stu
dent drivers in hopes of inducing a
minor ticketable offense.
It's the same case of hypocritical ir
responsibility as when I see a Student
Housing van parked in the fire lane
right next to an empty, reserved Service
Vehicle spot.
If Stanford officials honestly believe
that the irresponsible behavior of bik
ers and motorists around campus is
such a grave danger and they want to
lay down the law, no exceptions grant
ed, maybe they should try setting a bet
ter example first.
