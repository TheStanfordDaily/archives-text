Iraqi prison abuses shatter pride in
American troops
For the first time tonight, I tracked
down the photos of the prisoners
abased by the American army in the
Iraqi prison of Abu Ghraib. They make
me want to cry. Despite my disagree
ment on many fronts with the war in
Iraq and with the Bush administration's
handling of foreign policy, I can still
manage to feel pride in the fact that we
have many thousands of young Ameri
cans willing to fight when the govern
ment of their country asks them to.
And while I think that our military
should not be in Iraq, I can be com
fortable in certain ways with the war
because I am confident that our mili
tary and our soldiers conduct war in as
responsible a manner as any military
on the planet, and perhaps as responsi
bly as any decisively powerful military
in history.

But seeing Iraqi men forced into a
naked mass of bodies, their heads cov
ered in plastic bags, while American
soldiers wearing American fatigues
grin proudly — this makes me cry with
shame. Seeing an Iraqi man standing
naked on a box, his head also covered
in a plastic bag and his body connected
to wires while forced (according to re
ports) to remain on the box lest he fall
off and the wires electrocute him —
this makes me cry with shame.
I could say plenty about the truly
awful pragmatic consequences that
such photographs will have globally
and particularly among the (rightfully
outraged) Arab world. And I could say
plenty about my dark fear that such
shameful atrocities are not, as Colin
Powell and other members of the Bush
administration maintain, isolated acts,
but are rather part of a series that could
only occur in a military culture that
would shatter any of the proud feelings

I expressed above.
It is more important today, though,
that I express the most poignant and
deepest shame as an American that I
have yet to feel in my 22 years.

Letter loaded with false claims
Joe Webb's letter to the editor in
The Stanford Daily on May 3 ("Anti-
Semitism to become illegal") is both
shocking and angering given that it is
loaded with false claims about the inci
dent on campus and contains mislead
ing, if not preposterous, conclusions.
I was standing in line fora falafel in
White Plaza as the event Webb de
scribed unfolded five feet away from
me. Webb was parading through the
middle of the plaza, contrary to the
other peaceful protesters who were

standing in the area accorded to
protesters right next to the main event.
Apparently seeking out controver
sy, Webb walked in between the stu
dents in the plaza, chanting inflamma
tory remarks. When a student verbally
responded to Webb, a heated discus
sion ensued, but there was no physical
contact whatsoever between Webb
and the student, contrary to Webbs
claim in his letter.
It should also be pointed out that
Webb carried a sign with a swastika
during the parade, in contrast to the
other protesters, who chose to show
their support for the Palestinian state
and their disapproval of the Israeli cel
ebration while refraining from evoking
Nazism and racism in its most egre
gious form.
Webb, a community member seem
ingly unconnected with Stanford, clear
ly went out of his way to provoke and
incite. He could have learned somc

thing from the students present, where
members from both sides who are also
part of the Stanford interfaith council
talked peacefully, as at least colleagues
and perhaps friends, during the event.
Lastly, the conclusions that Webb
draws out of his fabricated tale are
ridiculous. This incident, even as de
scribed, comes far from demonstrating
that "a loss of liberties is around the
corner." His reference to a Holocaust
"revisionist" is unrelated to anything
else he has to say, and this term is only
used by those who deny that the Holo
caust occurred, a preposterous claim.
Webb should also learn a bit more
about the legal systems in European
countries such as Germany and
France, and consider the history under
lying their laws, before bemoaning
these countries policies. Lastly, while
making an effort to get his facts straight
in the future, Webb might also consid
er sparing us his unfounded doomsday

predictions and scare tactics.

Daily should not have
publisned offensive letter
Try as I might to feel proud at hav
ing published a letter in The Daily,
well, Joe Webb got published too. Now
that The Daily has lowered the bar by
achieving journalistic balance between
anti-Semites and Jews, what is next? A
published debate between Ujamaa
and the KKK?
The Fundamental Standard does
not apply to Webb, who is not, as far as
anyone can tell, a Stanford student.
However, it does apply to the Daily
editors. Perhaps the editors were sim
ply trying to show the full range of
opinion extant on campus. I would
