## Emily says West Side is still the best side 
### 
Ahhh, May / April / June. Time to sit
back and watch the drama that is the
NBA playoffs. They may drag on for
an incessantly long time, but it's the
one time of year us West-Coasters can declare
absolute supremacy in the world of sports —
even though we may have to rely on Satan's
seven-foot tall minions, otherwise known as the
Los Angeles Lakers, to do it.
Ever since the days of MJ's Bulls, the East has
been a flat-out junior-varsity league — and
that's being generous.
Entering this year's playoffs, things looked
like they could be different for the East. Instead
of winning 70-plus games as a team with four fu
ture Hall of Famers should, the Lakers have self
imploded amidst a sea of injuries, egos, rape tri
als, certain shooting guards proving points about
shot selection and anonymous teammates run
ning their mouths to the media. The Kings are
trying to get by with a gimpy Chris Webber —

although chances are it'll
work to their advantage
knowing Mike Bibby is their
go-to-guy. And the T-
Wolves? Does anyone really,
honestly think they're going
to get past the second round?
A Western Conference
team didn't even have the best
record in the NBA — and the
only team out West that

looked good down the stretch was San Antonio.
(Writer's note: The Spurs are clearly going to win
the title, which makes this column a little irrele
vant, hut at least you '11 know why the East is going
to fail miserably once again.)
Things looked so good for the East coming
into the playoffs. Three teams —Indiana,
New Jersey and Detroit — looked like they
might be decent enough to put up a fight in
the NBA Finals.
The Pacers got themselves a real coach in
Rick Carlisle — Zeke, you're one of my all-time
favorite players, but c'mon, you're a player. Joe
Dumars pulled off one of the most lop-sided
trades in the history of trades and ended up with
Rasheed Wallace, who seems to have finally
found a place that doesn't make him crazy. And
the Nets finally ditched Byron Scott — who I am
convinced didn't know a thing about basketball,
but was great at standing on the sidelines in a suit
and looking self-important, which probably kept
him from getting fired for three and a half years.
But, as happens so often, with the beginning
of the playoffs began a separation of the men
from the boys.
Yes, the Nets swept the Knicks, but is that re
ally such an accomplishment? The Knicks didn't
even have a winning record in the regular sea
son. Anything less than a sweep would have
been absolutely pathetic. The only good thing
that came out of that series was the Tim Thomas-
Kenyon Martin-Jason Collins saga.
And while I originally had the Pistons com
ing out of the East, they dropped two games to
the Bucks. And the Bucks didn't even have T.J.
Ford. This is a team whose leading scorer
(Michael Redd) has to be the highest-scoring
player in the NBA who can't create his own shot
—oh wait, that's Peja Stojakovic — actually
plays Toni Kukoc (who I thought was dead) and
has the unfortunate fate of employing Keith
Van Horn.
Coming into the conference semifinals, it
seemed as if the experience of the Nets might
once again carry them through the Eastern Con
ference after Detroit's first-round struggles. But
that was before Monday night. The Nets get not
one, but two strikes for their embarrassing 56-
point output.
Kenyon Martin, who — if you listen to the
delusional idiocies that come out of his mouth —
was the biggest, baddest thing to descend upon
New York City since Rudy Giuliani. But he
proved once again that although he whines every
time he's not mentioned in the same breath as
Tim Duncan, Ben Wallace, Shaq, Jermaine
O'Neal and Kevin Garnett, he can't compete
with any of the elite power forwards / centers in
the league. Jason Kidd showed that he can't run
a half-court offense against a good defensive
team and Richard Jefferson made Tayshaun
Prince look like Michael Jordan.
That leaves the Pacers. They have currently
escaped being branded with a strike, but then
again, they played Boston — whose general
manager was obviously trying to tank his team's
season —in the first round. And since they
haven't played in what seems like decades, Ron
Artest has probably gone crazy due to inactivity.
I'll give you 2:1 odds at least one of the Pacers-
Heat series' box scores reads: Artest, Ron DNP-
Suspended by league.
And while there's plenty wrong with the
Kings, Timberwolves, Lakers and even Spurs,
unfortunately for the Pacers, Nets and Pistons,
they have to be nearly perfect if they're going to
compete with any of the Western Conference
teams — and that is clearly not in the cards. The
West just has more talent, which is why the NBA
Playoffs are great. West Side, baby.

her column with "West side, baby." E-mail

how wrong she is. On a totally unrelated
note, she wants to give props to Stan Van
Gundy for calling out the Miami media after
they bashed his Heat.

compete with any of the Western Conference
teams — and that is clearly not in the cards. The
West just has more talent, which is why the NBA
Playoffs are great. West Side, baby.

how wrong she is. On a totally unrelated

Gundy for calling out the Miami media after
they bashed his Heat.

Ahhh, May / April / June. Time to sit
back and watch the drama that is the
NBA playoffs. They may drag on for
an incessantly long time, but it's the
one time of year us West-Coasters can declare
absolute supremacy in the world of sports —
even though we may have to rely on Satan's
seven-foot tall minions, otherwise known as the
Los Angeles Lakers, to do it.
Ever since the days of MJ's Bulls, the East has
been a flat-out junior-varsity league — and
that's being generous.
Entering this year's playoffs, things looked
like they could be different for the East. Instead
of winning 70-plus games as a team with four fu
ture Hall of Famers should, the Lakers have self
imploded amidst a sea of injuries, egos, rape tri
als, certain shooting guards proving points about
shot selection and anonymous teammates run
ning their mouths to the media. The Kings are
trying to get by with a gimpy Chris Webber —

although chances are it'll
work to their advantage
knowing Mike Bibby is their
go-to-guy. And the T-
Wolves? Does anyone really,
honestly think they're going
to get past the second round?
A Western Conference
team didn't even have the best
record in the NBA — and the
only team out West that

looked good down the stretch was San Antonio.
(Writer's note: The Spurs are clearly going to win
the title, which makes this column a little irrele
vant, hut at least you '11 know why the East is going
to fail miserably once again.)
Things looked so good for the East coming
into the playoffs. Three teams —Indiana,
New Jersey and Detroit — looked like they
might be decent enough to put up a fight in
the NBA Finals.
The Pacers got themselves a real coach in
Rick Carlisle — Zeke, you're one of my all-time
favorite players, but c'mon, you're a player. Joe
Dumars pulled off one of the most lop-sided
trades in the history of trades and ended up with
Rasheed Wallace, who seems to have finally
found a place that doesn't make him crazy. And
the Nets finally ditched Byron Scott — who I am
convinced didn't know a thing about basketball,
but was great at standing on the sidelines in a suit
and looking self-important, which probably kept
him from getting fired for three and a half years.
But, as happens so often, with the beginning
of the playoffs began a separation of the men
from the boys.
Yes, the Nets swept the Knicks, but is that re
ally such an accomplishment? The Knicks didn't
even have a winning record in the regular sea
son. Anything less than a sweep would have
been absolutely pathetic. The only good thing
that came out of that series was the Tim Thomas-
Kenyon Martin-Jason Collins saga.
And while I originally had the Pistons com
ing out of the East, they dropped two games to
the Bucks. And the Bucks didn't even have T.J.
Ford. This is a team whose leading scorer
(Michael Redd) has to be the highest-scoring
player in the NBA who can't create his own shot
—oh wait, that's Peja Stojakovic — actually
plays Toni Kukoc (who I thought was dead) and
has the unfortunate fate of employing Keith
Van Horn.
Coming into the conference semifinals, it
seemed as if the experience of the Nets might
once again carry them through the Eastern Con
ference after Detroit's first-round struggles. But
that was before Monday night. The Nets get not
one, but two strikes for their embarrassing 56-
point output.
Kenyon Martin, who — if you listen to the
delusional idiocies that come out of his mouth —
was the biggest, baddest thing to descend upon
New York City since Rudy Giuliani. But he
proved once again that although he whines every
time he's not mentioned in the same breath as
Tim Duncan, Ben Wallace, Shaq, Jermaine
O'Neal and Kevin Garnett, he can't compete
with any of the elite power forwards / centers in
the league. Jason Kidd showed that he can't run
a half-court offense against a good defensive
team and Richard Jefferson made Tayshaun
Prince look like Michael Jordan.
That leaves the Pacers. They have currently
escaped being branded with a strike, but then
again, they played Boston — whose general
manager was obviously trying to tank his team's
season —in the first round. And since they
haven't played in what seems like decades, Ron
Artest has probably gone crazy due to inactivity.
I'll give you 2:1 odds at least one of the Pacers-
Heat series' box scores reads: Artest, Ron DNP-
Suspended by league.
And while there's plenty wrong with the
Kings, Timberwolves, Lakers and even Spurs,
unfortunately for the Pacers, Nets and Pistons,
they have to be nearly perfect if they're going to
compete with any of the Western Conference
teams — and that is clearly not in the cards. The
West just has more talent, which is why the NBA
Playoffs are great. West Side, baby.
