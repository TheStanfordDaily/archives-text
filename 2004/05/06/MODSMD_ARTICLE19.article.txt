# Water Polo to play for title
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
They have played in tournaments at
home and away, they have faced the 2004
Olympic team, they have traveled to Hawaii
and up and down the West Coast but this is
where they belong: the NCAA Champi
onships.
The No. 2 Stanford women's water polo
squad (20-4, 10-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) hopes to cap off its season with
a national title this weekend at Avery
Aquatic Center, where the team expects to
see a lot of fans in a four-team tournament
that will also include Southern California,
Loyola-Marymount and Hartwick College.
Stanford takes on Loyola-Marymount in
the first game tomorrow.
The Cardinal should be accustomed to
playing on such a big stage. This is the
fourth consecutive time that Stanford has
reached the national championships,
which have been officially in existence
since 2001. The Cardinal hopes fora re
peat of the 2002 finals, in which it won the
title.
"Our program has had a history of play
ing well at NCAAs," said freshman driver
Katie Hansen. "It was our goal the whole
year. It's nice to get here, but we were plan
ning on it, too."
Stanford earned a spot in the NCAAs
after a stellar season, marked by only four
losses, all to Southern California. Stanford
made sure to wrap up the berth as it closed
the regular season with five consecutive
wins, but one of the more important points
in securing the at-large berth came mid-sea
son during the Santa Barbara tournament.
"We knew a month and a half ago that if
we won our semifinal game we would go,"
said head coach John Tanner. "So as soon as
we beat UCLA at the Santa Barbara tour
nament it was just more or less a question of
if USC kept winning, and we would just
have to beat UCLA in the semifinal to be
in."
The five game win streak that Stanford
carried into the MPSF tournament was ex
tended to seven games in the tournament
last week until the Cardinal lost a tough
overtime match 8-7 in the final game to
USC, after beating UCLA the previous
day.
Stanford attributes its success to plan
ning early on in the season, with new players
meeting older ones, and the setting of ex
pectations for the season.
"We make it a goal that this be the end
result," said senior 2-meter defender
Wendy Watkins. "We want to be in NCAAs
and we want to be competing for the NCAA
Championship. Anything less than that is
kind of a step down, so we set that as our bar
and make sure that we get there each year."
Watkins, who leads the Cardinal with
27 goals and was named All-MPSF along
with junior 2-meter / defender Hannah
Luber, freshman goalkeeper Meridith
McColl, freshman 2-meter Christina
Hewko and Hansen, is also intent on
claiming the championship in her final
year.

Top-ranked USC claims the first seed in
the NCAAs after winning the conference
championship on Sunday with a perfect 27-
0 record, including 11-0 in the MPSF. The
Trojans are led by Moriah Van Norman,
who earned MPSF Player of the Year hon
ors, and goalkeeper Kelly Graff.
No. 2 Stanford gets the second seed,
while Loyola Marymount (24-5), winner of
the Western Water Polo Association, takes
the third seed. The Collegiate Water Polo
Association is represented by conference
champion Hartwick, which rounds out the
field as the fourth seed.
"60 teams start out the season and now
there are just four left," Tanner said. "We
are very proud to be one of those four
teams, and we look forward to the opportu
nity to show that we are the best."

Facing Loyola-Marymount tomorrow
could be a challenge for the Cardinal, as
this is the first time they have faced the
Lions in a few months. Devon Wright
poses a threat, coming off a weekend in
which she netted seven goals in three
games, as do her fellow senior teammates
Jaime Kroeze and Teresa Guidi. Stan
ford's plan is to adjust as the game goes
along.
"There are always some worries or fears
when you're playing other teams that you
haven't faced yet," Watkins said. "But our
coaches do a good job of checking out other
teams before and prepping us for anything
we are going to face, so we always feel very
comfortable when we play new opponents."
"In general, we just have to do our own
thing and play our own game plan and that

will work out," Hansen said.
While the Cardinal is preparing for all
three teams, it looks as if it is preparing for
the Women of Troy especially. Stanford has
one more chance to lift its part in the rivalry
by finally beating the Trojans.
If it seems like it's too early to make pre
dictions about the final game, Tanner notes
that the MPSF conference is considered the
best conference in the country. It would
only be suitable for that conference's best
teams to play each other for the national
championship.
"We are very close [to accomplishing the
goals we set for the season]," Watkins said.
"[lt] requires a win — against USC — and
we are really excited to play them again and
finally get that win."
