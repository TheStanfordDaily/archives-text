# Profs explain role of language in politics
## 
### ANDREW GAY BY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night, two well-known lin
guists, Deborah Tannen and Geof
frey Nunberg, discussed the language
of American politics and how it
shapes political debate. In particular,
they emphasized the polarization of
political discussion and the tendency
to view politics as conflict-driven.
They also described President
George W. Bush's rhetorical tech
niques for garnering support for the
war in Iraq.
Tannen, a linguistics professor at
Georgetown University and author
of 19 books, explained how language
frames political debates.
"Politicians believe that you can
do anything you want; it doesn't mat
ter what you do as long as you use the
right words," she said. "In speaking of
his education reform act. Bush used
very effective, emotionally evocative
language and so he didn't have to ac
tually fund the program or put money
into it."
Tannen also discussed how lan
guage relates to other topics, such
as abortion.
"The fact that abortion-rights
supporters do not use the word
[abortion] is because the pro-life
movement has been so successful in
making 'abortion' a bad word," she
said. "The very concept of abortion
now is associated with the image of
partial-birth abortions. That use of
the word confirms the image people
have of a baby ready to be born but
killed instead."
Tannen also pointed out that in
framing the argument as between
pro-choice and pro-life factions,
the opponents of abortion have
been successful in winning the bat
tle of language.
"The words pro-choice imply that
there is a choice, that it is something
frivolous," she said. "By refusing to
use the word abortion, they continue
the stigma of abortions as a negative
thing. Also, pro-life is excellent lan
guage because no one wants to be
pro-death."
Nunberg, a senior researcher at
the Center for the Study of Language
and Information and a linguistics pro
fessor at Stanford, said that in the dia
logue of U.S. politics, the right has
neutralized the left.
"The right has taken language
from the left," he said. "Words like
'inclusive' and 'discrimination,' which
are typically liberal words, are now

[conservative] when President Bush
says 'we cannot discriminate against
people of faith.'"
Nunberg also remarked on lin
guistic parallels between the Viet
nam War and the current Iraqi con
flict, saying that the only words
used to speak of a conflict like Iraq
are words that were used in refer
ence to Vietnam.
"The current administration uses
phrases such as 'support the troops'
and 'the hearts and minds of the Iraqi
people,' " Nunberg said. "When you
start a conversation with those
words, it is inevitable that some
where down the road we will start
talking about 'quagmires.' Oppo
nents of the war will then use 'exit
strategies' and label Iraq 'Bush's
Vietnam' to attack the War."
The moderator. Communications
Director Alan Acosta, focused the
debate on the polarization of the
news and of political debate. He
noted that since news serves as enter
tainment, discussions often feature
participants from opposing political

poles with no common ground.
Tannen gave a number of rea
sons for the increase in polarization
and personal attacks, saying that the
media feels obligated to provide
two sides of every story and that
fighting is more exciting than nor
mal news coverage
"News is competitive, and so the
most entertaining thing to do is to get
spokespersons from the two most ex
treme views possible and have them
fight it out," Tannen said. "You are
supposed to show both sides, so you
work hard to get two from extreme
viewpoints. People who claimed that
the Holocaust did not occur have the
most support in the United States be
cause we have it so ingrained by the
news media that there are two sides to
every story."
She also pointed out that fighting
is an undercurrent in our society. The
"war on cancer," "war on poverty"
and "war on drugs" are all examples
of our society's tendency to view
events as conflicts, Tannen said.
Nunberg also pointed out that at

tacks have become more personal in
recent years.
"Political attacks really have a
different tenor then they had in
other periods," he said. "It really
isn't about politics; politics is just
standing in for some greater attack
on lifestyle. The word 'liberal' means
"middle class, white, self-indulgent
Volvo drivers.' 'Liberal' only stands
in for this much broader lifestyle that
they are attacking. That's why the at
tacks feel much more personal in
more recent years."
The discussion was part of the Au
rora Forum, which is sponsored by
Stanford Continuing Studies and is an
ongoing series of inclusive town hall
meetings on topics ranging from flag
burning to the American presidency.
In closing the debate, Acosta
described the function that Au
rora serves in modern democrat
ic discussion.
"We are looking fora national
conversation that leans more toward
synthesis than toward angry polar
ized partisanship," he said.
