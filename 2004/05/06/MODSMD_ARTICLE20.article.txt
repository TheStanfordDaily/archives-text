# Triathlon club ninth at Nationals
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Lake Havasu, Ariz. — The beginning of
a race or a game is one of the most beau
tiful moments in sport. The air hangs
thick with anticipation and a nervous si
lence spreads over the line-up. No one
has won, no one has lost: It's all dreams
waiting for the chance to come true.
"Bang," the starting gun unleashes the
hounds.
In no sport other than triathlon, does
that beautiful moment turn so ugly so
fast. It's called the break-out — over 60
people start swimming in a pack at the
same time in open water. Goggles are jos
tled, elbows are thrown, people swim
over and across each other, and the ag
gressive ones try to swim through their
competitors.
On April 24, 38 Stanford graduates
and undergraduates on the triathlon club
team fought through the break-out and
then swam under the London Bridge at
the U.S.A. Triathlon collegiate nationals
in Lake Havasu, Arizona.
After the "breathless, floundering
around, oh-my-god-I-think-I'm-going
to-drown part at the beginning," as junior
Julia Nelson put it, the team members
went on to complete the mile swim, the 40
kilometer bike and the 10 kilometer run.
The women finished sixth and the
men took 13th fora combined finish of
ninth place out of 21 teams. The Uni
versity of Colorado won the combined
race and California finished a close
second.
Graduate student Ashley Fouts was
the fastest woman for the Cardinal with a
time of 2:23:21 and a 12th place finish.
Sophomore John Ducci led the Stanford

men in 37th place with a time of 2:06:56.
The top three male and female finishers
on each team determine the team scores.
Graduate student Cherie Stancik, junior
Kristen Bell, graduate student Pete Kli
mas and senior Tom Burrow rounded out
the effort for Stanford.
Shannon Dunn won the exhibition
race, but the third-fastest Stanford
woman could not count for the team
score because she is a post-doctoral stu
dent.
Last year Stanford took third at nation
als, but the team graduated five of its six
top finishers.
"We fulfilled our potential this year
and that is always what the spirit of the
sport is," said coach Eric Bean, who
won nationals last year but was ineligi
ble to race this year since he has gradu
ated.
This year everyone was able to finish
the race.
"In contrast to last year, we had no
bike crashes, no heatstroke and no heli
copter rides to the hospital," said club co
president senior Ben Abadi.
"This was very much a rebuilding
year," continued Bean "Our attitude was
certainly different... we focused more
on developing athletes for the future
rather than winning nationals."
The team has grown since last year
and particularly over the past two
years. It welcomes any experience
level, from novices to ex-varsity ath
letes.
"The last time I checked, we had over
90 members on our roster and 250 on our
e-mail list," Abadi said. "Fora team that
didn't exist four years ago, that's fantas
tic."
A club at the Graduate School of

Business has also formed in recent years.
The GSB club sent over 15 people to the
Wildflower Invitational Triathlon this
past Saturday to race in 102-degree
weather.
Triathlon's popularity has been grow
ing at other schools, too. A Northern Cali
fornia Triathlon Conference was created
this year to accommodate that growth. Al
though still in its fledging stages, the con
ference includes Stanford, California,UC-
Davis and Sacramento State. Stanford fin
ished second in the conference after Cal.
"A lot of the sport's growth can be
credited to TV coverage of the Ironman
Hawaii Event in the 19905, as well as the
recent inclusion in the Olympics,"Abadi
said.
Or maybe people just dig the gear
from wetsuits that athletes spray with
Pam cooking spray so they slip off quick
ly, to bikes with aerobars and souped-up
wheels, to running shoes with elastic
laces made fora quick transition between
the bike and run. Teammates pay for all
the gear, but they get discounts from the
club's various sponsors.
"The triathlon gear is really funny; ac
tually — it is borderline ridiculous,"
Stancik said. "When I get into my cycling
outfit and leave my office for our Tues
day brick, my co-workers always laugh at
me, as it looks like I'm wearing a cos
tume. I never thought I would get all the
gear and clothes and eat Gu while riding
a bike, but it's just addictive."
Gu? Just one of the many options
triathletes have for consuming needed
calories during the race.
Ducci eats Gu during his races, but be
fore practices his regimen is quite differ
ent.
"I've trained my stomach to take two

blueberry-cake donuts, a peanut-butter
sandwich, and [to] wash it down with a
glass of milk before I go out to run half an
hour later," he said.
Whether it was the eating, training or
the daily practices— swimming four
times a week, running three times a week
and biking twice a week — Ducci im
proved a great deal this year, dropping 10
minutes from his race time and going
from 78th to 37th place.
Co-president junior Laura Sherman
also had a standout performance. Sher
man has been competing since she was a
freshman, but dehydration and injuries
prevented her from finishing the race at
nationals until this year. A knee injury
kept her from doing any running training
this year. She had planned to walk the run
portion at the race, but changed her mind
on the course.
"When I got in the race situation, I just
wanted to run it, even if it would be a
slow, painful jog," she said. "It wasn't a
fun experience, but it's just amazing for
me to finish it, since I'd never finished na
tionals before."
Added Stanick: "In any endurance
event, there is that moment in the race
where you feel a sense of elation — you
realize that you will in fact reach the fin
ish line, which is always the first and fore
most goal."
Stancik set a personal record of
2:25:37 with a blistering 10K run split of
43:58. "It is then that you realize that you
need to search for the strength to finish
strong and proud, enabling you to meet
yOour secondary goals of time and
place."

a bike, but it's just addictive."
Gu? Just one of the many options
triathletes have for consuming needed
calories during the race.
Ducci eats Gu during his races, but be
fore practices his regimen is quite differ
ent.
"I've trained my stomach to take two

blueberry-cake donuts, a peanut-butter
sandwich, and [to] wash it down with a
glass of milk before I go out to run half an
hour later," he said.
Whether it was the eating, training or
the daily practices— swimming four
times a week, running three times a week
and biking twice a week — Ducci im
proved a great deal this year, dropping 10
minutes from his race time and going
from 78th to 37th place.
Co-president junior Laura Sherman
also had a standout performance. Sher
man has been competing since she was a
freshman, but dehydration and injuries
prevented her from finishing the race at
nationals until this year. A knee injury
kept her from doing any running training
this year. She had planned to walk the run
portion at the race, but changed her mind
on the course.
"When I got in the race situation, I just
wanted to run it, even if it would be a
slow, painful jog," she said. "It wasn't a
fun experience, but it's just amazing for
me to finish it, since I'd never finished na
tionals before."
Added Stanick: "In any endurance
event, there is that moment in the race
where you feel a sense of elation — you
realize that you will in fact reach the fin
ish line, which is always the first and fore
most goal."
Stancik set a personal record of
2:25:37 with a blistering 10K run split of
43:58. "It is then that you realize that you
need to search for the strength to finish
strong and proud, enabling you to meet
yOour secondary goals of time and
place."

Lake Havasu, Ariz. — The beginning of
a race or a game is one of the most beau
tiful moments in sport. The air hangs
thick with anticipation and a nervous si
lence spreads over the line-up. No one
has won, no one has lost: It's all dreams
waiting for the chance to come true.
"Bang," the starting gun unleashes the
hounds.
In no sport other than triathlon, does
that beautiful moment turn so ugly so
fast. It's called the break-out — over 60
people start swimming in a pack at the
same time in open water. Goggles are jos
tled, elbows are thrown, people swim
over and across each other, and the ag
gressive ones try to swim through their
competitors.
On April 24, 38 Stanford graduates
and undergraduates on the triathlon club
team fought through the break-out and
then swam under the London Bridge at
the U.S.A. Triathlon collegiate nationals
in Lake Havasu, Arizona.
After the "breathless, floundering
around, oh-my-god-I-think-I'm-going
to-drown part at the beginning," as junior
Julia Nelson put it, the team members
went on to complete the mile swim, the 40
kilometer bike and the 10 kilometer run.
The women finished sixth and the
men took 13th fora combined finish of
ninth place out of 21 teams. The Uni
versity of Colorado won the combined
race and California finished a close
second.
Graduate student Ashley Fouts was
the fastest woman for the Cardinal with a
time of 2:23:21 and a 12th place finish.
Sophomore John Ducci led the Stanford

men in 37th place with a time of 2:06:56.
The top three male and female finishers
on each team determine the team scores.
Graduate student Cherie Stancik, junior
Kristen Bell, graduate student Pete Kli
mas and senior Tom Burrow rounded out
the effort for Stanford.
Shannon Dunn won the exhibition
race, but the third-fastest Stanford
woman could not count for the team
score because she is a post-doctoral stu
dent.
Last year Stanford took third at nation
als, but the team graduated five of its six
top finishers.
"We fulfilled our potential this year
and that is always what the spirit of the
sport is," said coach Eric Bean, who
won nationals last year but was ineligi
ble to race this year since he has gradu
ated.
This year everyone was able to finish
the race.
"In contrast to last year, we had no
bike crashes, no heatstroke and no heli
copter rides to the hospital," said club co
president senior Ben Abadi.
"This was very much a rebuilding
year," continued Bean "Our attitude was
certainly different... we focused more
on developing athletes for the future
rather than winning nationals."
The team has grown since last year
and particularly over the past two
years. It welcomes any experience
level, from novices to ex-varsity ath
letes.
"The last time I checked, we had over
90 members on our roster and 250 on our
e-mail list," Abadi said. "Fora team that
didn't exist four years ago, that's fantas
tic."
A club at the Graduate School of

Business has also formed in recent years.
The GSB club sent over 15 people to the
Wildflower Invitational Triathlon this
past Saturday to race in 102-degree
weather.
Triathlon's popularity has been grow
ing at other schools, too. A Northern Cali
fornia Triathlon Conference was created
this year to accommodate that growth. Al
though still in its fledging stages, the con
ference includes Stanford, California,UC-
Davis and Sacramento State. Stanford fin
ished second in the conference after Cal.
"A lot of the sport's growth can be
credited to TV coverage of the Ironman
Hawaii Event in the 19905, as well as the
recent inclusion in the Olympics,"Abadi
said.
Or maybe people just dig the gear
from wetsuits that athletes spray with
Pam cooking spray so they slip off quick
ly, to bikes with aerobars and souped-up
wheels, to running shoes with elastic
laces made fora quick transition between
the bike and run. Teammates pay for all
the gear, but they get discounts from the
club's various sponsors.
"The triathlon gear is really funny; ac
tually — it is borderline ridiculous,"
Stancik said. "When I get into my cycling
outfit and leave my office for our Tues
day brick, my co-workers always laugh at
me, as it looks like I'm wearing a cos
tume. I never thought I would get all the
gear and clothes and eat Gu while riding
a bike, but it's just addictive."
