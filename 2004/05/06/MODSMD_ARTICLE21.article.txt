# Lacrosse favored in conference playoffs
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Having just returned from a trip to Wash
ington, D.C., the Stanford women's lacrosse
team hits the road again as it travels to Den
ver, Colo., to play in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Championship today and
on Saturday.
Stanford is scheduled to play UC-Davis
today and California faces tournament-host
Denver. The semifinal winners meet in the fi
nals on Saturday at 1 p.m. while the losers of
the semis face off in the consolation finals
earlier that day, at 11 a.m.
The Cardinal enters this weekend's cham
pionship as the top seed, followed by Califor
nia, Denver and UC-Davis, respectively.
Losing 20-10 to California last weekend in
MPSF play, St. Mary's failed to qualify for
this weekend's tournament and closed out its
season with a record of 4-12.
After a tough loss to Georgetown, Stan
ford has used the past couple days to rest up
for this weekend's tournament.
"Our best opportunity is to refresh our
selves," said head coach Michele Uhlfelder.
"Some of our players have had midterms,
and it's been a long year. We want to make

sure that we're as rested as we can possibly
be."
The MPSF conference is comprised of
Stanford (8-8, 4-0 MPSF), Cal, Denver, St.
Mary's and UC-Davis. The five teams com
peted together in 2002 and 2003 as the Moun
tain Pacific Lacrosse League (MPLL) and
have also played together in the past as the
Western Women's Lacrosse League
(WWLL). Oregon shall join these five teams
in the 2004-2005 season to bring the confer
ence membership to six. With the addition of
Oregon, the teams may be able to gain auto
matic qualification to NCAA post-season
play in upcoming years.
Stanford won the MPLL title in 2003 for
the second year in a row with a narrow 15-14
defeat of Cal to finish the year with a 14-4
record. If the Cardinal faces the Bears in the
finals on Saturday, the meeting would be the
fourth consecutive conference championship
match between the two teams.
In the season's opening game, the Cardi
nal crushed UC-Davis on Valentine's Day
with a score of 15-4. Stanford scored 12 times
in the second period of that game, with
sophomore Megan Burker netting four
goals.
If the Cardinal women can dominate

against the Aggies again, they will face either
Cal or Denver in the finals, both of whom
Stanford has marked wins against earlier this
season. The team edged out the Bears on
Cal's home turf, 9-6, in February and again at
Maloney Field, 15-12, in April; the Cardinal
also recorded a win against the Pioneers in
March in Denver, 16-5.
As Stanford returns to Denver, the team
will focus on its midfield transition and shoot
ing, especially since its midfield transition
was the Card's downfall last Saturday in the
game againlst the Hoyas. Also, the team is
working on creating and taking higher per
centage shots and "relying on [its] own goal
keeper's feedback from practice to show [the
team] how to be smarter in [its] shots,"
Uhlfelder said.
On Tuesday, Uhlfelder was named MPSF
Co-Coach of the Year with Cal's Jill Malko.
Also honored on Tuesday were All-MPSF
team members — Burker and seniors Katie
Grube, Nina Pantano and Christina Saikus.
Should the Cardinal advance, NCAA
play begins next Thursday.
"The team goal is to improve every day and
get better with each day," Uhlfelder said. "Win
or lose, the team is very honest and very willing
to work on [its] weaknesses."
