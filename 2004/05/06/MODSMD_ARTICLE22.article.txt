## Students at Chico consider solar power alternative 
### ASHLEY COLEMAN THE ORION 
(U-WIRE) CHICO. Calif. â€”
The California State University
at Chico Bell Memorial Union
could be getting a million-dol
lar makeover.
In an effort to reduce energy use
and convert the BMU to renewable
sources of power, a committee of
students will decide this month
whether to proceed with a plan to
replace the roof of the BMU with
solar panels.
Mario Sagastume, commissioner
of activity fee, will be presenting a
cost-benefit research study about
solar panels at the BMU committee
meeting Wednesday.
The solar panels would cost A.S.
about $1.2 million. But Sagastume

said there are financial benefits and
social costs, like cleaner air, which
factor into the decision.
"Solar panels are sexy right
now," he said. "Everyone is jumping
on using them."
In Sagastume's research, he stud
ied the BMU's monthly FG&E bills,
which charge 8 cents per kilowatt
hour. He compared the bills to the
cost (in kilowatt hours) to install
solar power, spread out over the life
of a 15-year loan, he said.
If the committee votes in favor
of the plan, A.S. could either hold a
special election in the fall for stu
dents to vote on a S3 to $8 union
fee increase, or build reserves in
the next few years and purchase
solar panels when they become
more affordable.
If A.S. holds a special election

and students vote for the measure,
the construction would be finished
by summer 2005, Sagastume said.
Executive Vice President Adam
Dondro said he is uncomfortable
asking students for more money
during the current budget crisis. He
said A.S. needs to be responsible
with student money. But he said he
thinks solar paneling would be a so
cially responsible decision.
The BMU's average monthly
PG&E bill between December
2002 and October 2003 was
$18,036, Sagastume said. But with
the solar-panel roof, A.S. will save
money on the energy bill. A.S. will
also receive a rebate from PG&E
for half of what the panel installa
tion costs, he said. PG&E cus
tomers who use solar roofing can
apply for the rebate.

The solar panels are 8 feet by 8
feet each and have a life span of 30
to 40 years, Sagastume said. The
company Power Light would install
the solar panels.
Senior Stacey Hinz said she
would be in favor of a fee increase to
pay for the solar panels. It would
save A.S. money overall and it
would be beneficial for the environ
ment, she said.
Senior Rich Fonseca said he
would also vote fora fee increase.
But, he said, A.S. would need to
show a business plan that proved
the solar panels would be feasible
to pay for. In the past, A.S. has
started projects like construction
for the BMU but needed extra
money for it, he said. If the solar
panel project passes, he would want
to be sure the fee increase would

cover the entire project.
Fonseca said it's important for
A.S. to switch to solar power be
cause of the environmental impact
of using nonrenewable energy re
sources.
In the A.S. elections last year,
students voted to spend $32,000 in
research costs to develop the plan,
recognizing that it might require a
temporary fee increase or reduction
in union programs.
Mark Stemen's environmental
studies capstone class put this mea
sure on the ballot last year. Then the
environmental and natural resource
economics class began the research
into alternative sources of energy.
Sagastume continued the research
this semester at an internship
through the economics department.
He said there is a lot more re

search he has to present to the
BMU committee before a decision
can be made. But he won't reveal
his complete cost-benefit analysis
until the meeting.
"This [solar panel roof] sends a
clear message to the university and the
state that we want to go forward with
it," Sagastume said, "even though the
time to do it was decades ago."
