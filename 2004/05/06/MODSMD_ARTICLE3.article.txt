### JESSICA BOROWICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 33rd annual Stanford Powwow, spon

pants and viewers to the Stanford Campus from
across North and South America this weekend.
Spectators from within and outside the
Stanford community are invited to watch Na
tive American dancers representing hun
dreds of tribes from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. Friday,

11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday and 11 a.m. to 6

Denni Woodward, assistant director of The

music and dancers from hundreds of
tribes, performing in adult, teen and
junior competitions. There will also
be drum contests and special smoke
and grass dances.
Attendees will be able to visit
approximately 100 booths featur
ing native artwork, food and edu

take place over Mother's Day
weekend, and according to Wood
ward, "It's a great place to buy a
Mother's Day present."
Students involved in Stanford's
Native American community look
to the event as the culmination of a
yearlong effort.
"Powwow is a really exciting
time for us to share our culture and
history with the community," said
junior Nikki Marquez, a program
ming assistant at the Native Amer
ican Cultural Center and active
member of the Native community.
"It's like our homecoming."

University funding for the Pow
wow has come from the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs in the
form of one-time financial support.
This funding is not sufficient to
completely offset the cost of cam
pus services and equipment, but
University administrators and the
Powwow Committee plan to con
tinue fundraising discussions.
The Powwow will be held on
campus at the corners of El
Camino and Embarcadero in the
Eucalyptus Grove, west of the
Stanford Stadium. The event is
free and all dances are open to
the public.
