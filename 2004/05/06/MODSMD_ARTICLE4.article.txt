# Police target specific areas; cyclists claim a 'crackdown'
## 
### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Thousands of students bike
across campus each day as they
rush to morning lectures, go to
practice or try to make it back to
their dorms in time to catch the sea
son finale of "The 0.C." Recently,
students have been complaining
that police officers have cracking
down on bicyclists, but Lt. Del
Bandy of the Stanford Police De
partment said this perception prob
ably had more to do the depart
ment's new policy of targeting spe
cific areas rather than an actual in
crease in citations.
"It seems to me that there's defi
nitely been an increase in the
amount of cops ticketing bikers,"
said freshman Tracy White.
According to Bandy, however,
officers have not been issuing a dras
tically larger number of citations.
Instead, they have been practicing
an enforcement method whereby
officers will concentrate on specific
areas fora few days at a time.
Last week, the Police Department
targeted areas along Santa Teresa.
In all, the Stanford Police De
partment has 31 sworn-in officers.
Depending on the amount of other
cases pending, there can be any
where from one to five officers out
citing bicyclists at any given time.
Bandy, who hatched this direct
enforcement idea last year, said the
Police Department's logic is that

people are more likely to take no
tice of officers they see repeatedly in
one area.
"If we target one location for an
entire week, the message of biking
safely will get saturated into the
minds of everyone who goes by
that area," Bandy said. "It really
helps us get an entire neighbor

hood all at once."
Student comments indicate
that police are succeeding in get
ting noticed.
"I've started avoiding those in
tersections and go on a longer ride

To reduce bicycle collisions, the Police Department has been heavily en
forcing bike laws in local areas, making some students feel targeted.
