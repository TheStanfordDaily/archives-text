# Police target specific areas; cyclists claim a 'crackdown'
## 
### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Thousands of students bike
across campus each day as they
rush to morning lectures, go to
practice or try to make it back to
their dorms in time to catch the sea
son finale of "The 0.C." Recently,
students have been complaining
that police officers have cracking
down on bicyclists, but Lt. Del
Bandy of the Stanford Police De
partment said this perception prob
ably had more to do the depart
ment's new policy of targeting spe
cific areas rather than an actual in
crease in citations.
"It seems to me that there's defi
nitely been an increase in the
amount of cops ticketing bikers,"
said freshman Tracy White.
According to Bandy, however,
officers have not been issuing a dras
tically larger number of citations.
Instead, they have been practicing
an enforcement method whereby
officers will concentrate on specific
areas fora few days at a time.
Last week, the Police Department
targeted areas along Santa Teresa.
In all, the Stanford Police De
partment has 31 sworn-in officers.
Depending on the amount of other
cases pending, there can be any
where from one to five officers out
citing bicyclists at any given time.
Bandy, who hatched this direct
enforcement idea last year, said the
Police Department's logic is that

people are more likely to take no
tice of officers they see repeatedly in
one area.
"If we target one location for an
entire week, the message of biking
safely will get saturated into the
minds of everyone who goes by
that area," Bandy said. "It really
helps us get an entire neighbor

hood all at once."
Student comments indicate
that police are succeeding in get
ting noticed.
"I've started avoiding those in
tersections and go on a longer ride

forcing bike laws in local areas, making some students feel targeted.
just to avoid the police," said fresh
man Danny Deasis. "I think it's
stupid because people will just be
concerned about looking for cops,
instead of looking for other bikers
or cars."
Freshman Matt Shin com
plained. "The other day, I saw my
TA get pulled over for running a
stop sign as 1 was on my way to her
class. While the officer was giving
her a citation, I saw a bunch of
other people run that same stop
sign and the officer didn't care. It
was ridiculous."
Running stop signs is among the
top bicycle-related violations that
people get cited for on campus. The
fine for running a stop sign can be as
high as $140.
According to Bandy, the offi
cers are not responsible for deter
mining fines. He noted that bicy
clists are cited with the same viola
tion codes as those of cars, but the

tickets also include a "hike author
ity code" to distinguish them.
From there, it is up to the court to
set the fine.
"The Police Department has
no authority on what the court
sets as a fine," Bandy said. "I
would love for the court to charge
only $20 as long as it gets the same
message across."
Bandy stressed that bicyclists
have all the rights and responsibili
ties of drivers and therefore must
obey all the same rules, including
stopping at stop signs, yielding
when it is appropriate and riding on
the correct side of the street.
The other top two bicycle-relat
ed violations are biking without a
light at night and having an unli
censed bicycle.
California state law mandates
that all bicycles be licensed. Ac
cording to Carolyn Helmke, bicycle
program coordinator at the Depart
ment of Parking and Transporta
tion, anyone can register a bike for
$3.50. She estimates that about
12.000 people bike on campus and
to date, her office has issued over
20,000 licenses.
"Our department is committed
to improving bicycle safety on cam
pus," Helmke said. "We give away

reflective leg hands and blinking
rear lights to everyone who regis
ters their hike. We also conduct free
hike safety road shows at any resi
dence that is interested and work to
educate cyclists about safer ways to
ride to prevent crashes."
Last year the University Presi
dent's Office purchased thousands
of bike lights that the Department
of Parking and Transportation dis
tributed to new students, which
Bandy cites as evidence that the
administration takes bike safety
very seriously.
Bandy said that over the past
two years, the Stanford Police have
been trying to increase awareness
of bicycle safety to reduce the num
ber of bike collisions through edu
cation and enforcement.
In the past, the Police Depart
ment has placed public service
ads in The Daily and produced a
number of leaflets and flyers to
distribute to new students. Bandy
also said that at the beginning of
the academic year, officers issued
many warnings and would give
flyers on bike safety, information
for bike registration and a
coupon fora free headlight to
people they stopped rather than
ticketing them.

just to avoid the police," said fresh
man Danny Deasis. "I think it's
stupid because people will just be
concerned about looking for cops,
instead of looking for other bikers
or cars."
Freshman Matt Shin com
plained. "The other day, I saw my
TA get pulled over for running a
stop sign as 1 was on my way to her
class. While the officer was giving
her a citation, I saw a bunch of
other people run that same stop
sign and the officer didn't care. It
was ridiculous."
Running stop signs is among the
top bicycle-related violations that
people get cited for on campus. The
fine for running a stop sign can be as
high as $140.
According to Bandy, the offi
cers are not responsible for deter
mining fines. He noted that bicy
clists are cited with the same viola
tion codes as those of cars, but the

tickets also include a "hike author
ity code" to distinguish them.
From there, it is up to the court to
set the fine.
"The Police Department has
no authority on what the court
sets as a fine," Bandy said. "I
would love for the court to charge
only $20 as long as it gets the same
message across."
Bandy stressed that bicyclists
have all the rights and responsibili
ties of drivers and therefore must
obey all the same rules, including
stopping at stop signs, yielding
when it is appropriate and riding on
the correct side of the street.
The other top two bicycle-relat
ed violations are biking without a
light at night and having an unli
censed bicycle.
California state law mandates
that all bicycles be licensed. Ac
cording to Carolyn Helmke, bicycle
program coordinator at the Depart
ment of Parking and Transporta
tion, anyone can register a bike for
$3.50. She estimates that about
12.000 people bike on campus and
to date, her office has issued over
20,000 licenses.
"Our department is committed
to improving bicycle safety on cam
pus," Helmke said. "We give away

reflective leg hands and blinking
rear lights to everyone who regis
ters their hike. We also conduct free
hike safety road shows at any resi
dence that is interested and work to
educate cyclists about safer ways to
ride to prevent crashes."
Last year the University Presi
dent's Office purchased thousands
of bike lights that the Department
of Parking and Transportation dis
tributed to new students, which
Bandy cites as evidence that the
administration takes bike safety
very seriously.
Bandy said that over the past
two years, the Stanford Police have
been trying to increase awareness
of bicycle safety to reduce the num
ber of bike collisions through edu
cation and enforcement.
In the past, the Police Depart
ment has placed public service
ads in The Daily and produced a
number of leaflets and flyers to
distribute to new students. Bandy
also said that at the beginning of
the academic year, officers issued
many warnings and would give
flyers on bike safety, information
for bike registration and a
coupon fora free headlight to
people they stopped rather than
ticketing them.
Thousands of students bike
across campus each day as they
rush to morning lectures, go to
practice or try to make it back to
their dorms in time to catch the sea
son finale of "The 0.C." Recently,
students have been complaining
that police officers have cracking
down on bicyclists, but Lt. Del
Bandy of the Stanford Police De
partment said this perception prob
ably had more to do the depart
ment's new policy of targeting spe
cific areas rather than an actual in
crease in citations.
"It seems to me that there's defi
nitely been an increase in the
amount of cops ticketing bikers,"
said freshman Tracy White.
According to Bandy, however,
officers have not been issuing a dras
tically larger number of citations.
Instead, they have been practicing
an enforcement method whereby
officers will concentrate on specific
areas fora few days at a time.
Last week, the Police Department
targeted areas along Santa Teresa.
In all, the Stanford Police De
partment has 31 sworn-in officers.
Depending on the amount of other
cases pending, there can be any
where from one to five officers out
citing bicyclists at any given time.
Bandy, who hatched this direct
enforcement idea last year, said the
Police Department's logic is that

people are more likely to take no
tice of officers they see repeatedly in
one area.
"If we target one location for an
entire week, the message of biking
safely will get saturated into the
