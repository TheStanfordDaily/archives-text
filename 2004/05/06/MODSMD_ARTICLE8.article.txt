# Students getting all twisted up... Yoga, craze hits campus
## 
### LAUREN GONG 
We've all seen them around,
strapped to backpacks, tucked
under arms, taking up your foot
room in chemistry lecture: those
multi-colored yoga mats. From the
nearly übiquitous nature of these
mats, it seems like every other stu
dent at Stanford has decided to take
up the art of yoga.
So what's the craze about? Is it
just me or does everyone who car
ries a mat seems more ... calm, re
laxed and focused. Indeed, yoga has
been proven to have many health
benefits, including stress relief,
greater flexibility and increased
concentration. Some coaches and
athletes are taking yoga outside of
the studio, as athletic trainers have
discovered the benefits of yoga for
serious athletes.
Yoga is based on three struc
tures: exercise, breathing and med
itation. The word comes from the
Sanskrit word "yuj," which trans
lates to the idea "to join or yoke to
gether." Spiritual practitioners of
yoga see themselves uniting their
soul with the Supreme Soul and
their individual will with the greater
Cosmic Will.
Yet this interpretation of yoga
may have come later: Contrary to
popular belief, yoga has no roots in
Hinduism. It evolved separately
and was later incorporated into reli
gious practices. Yoga is primarily an
exercise that focuses on the pos
tures — "asanas," as they are re
ferred to in Sanskrit — and breath

ing, the pranayama. Combining
fluid breath with the static or dy
namic postures leads to strength
building and greater flexibility.
Although yoga has existed for
thousands of years in India, it first
became popular in the United
States in the 1960s and, in the last
decade, it has become a mainstream
form of home exercise promoted by
movie stars like Madonna.Yoga
studios have cropped up every
where and new forms of yoga have
been created and fused with other
related exercises, such as combining
yoga and Pilates into "yogilates."
The yoga-craze is understandable:
Yoga can offer many benefits, both
spiritual and physical, to those who
choose to practice.
"The benefits of yoga are perva
sive," explained Stanford yoga in
structor Nancy Conniff. "They're
about the whole person. For me,
the biggest benefit has been, beside
the other health benefits of being
more flexible and having a stronger
core, its just being calmer. It's tak
ing time for yourself every day."
Conniff has been a group exer
cise instructor for 25 years and start
ed practicing yoga 8 years ago. She
has taught yoga and Pilates at Stan
ford for four years and especially
recommends flexibility exercises
for student athletes and those with
back pain.
Many Stanford students choose
to take Pilates Mat instead of yoga,
which has a similar foundation but
has many differences from yoga. Pi
lates was developed by Joseph Pi

lates for dancers as a series of core
strengthening techniques to im
prove abdominal and back strength.
"Pilates really helped me athlet
ically," said sophomore Rachel
Hsu. "Before, I never used to
stretch before running, but after
doing Pilates I learned some good
ways to get more flexible and relax
at the same time."
Conniff says the difference be
tween Pilates and yoga is that the
latter is more spiritual. Pilates, she
explained, uses the mind and the
body where as yoga is mind, body
and spirit."
The world is bigger than just us.
Yoga is tied to so many different
things... Yoga is about being part
of the class and also being your self
as parj of the group," Conniff said.
In its many forms (see top
box), yoga can be beneficial for
everyone but has proven espe
cially beneficial for both novice
and professional athletes.
"There have been studies that
have proven that not just yoga, but
any flexibility exercise for someone
who has a workout as arduous as
some of the student athletes at Stan
ford, can speed the recovery time by
30 percent," said Conniff. "People
that are doing some really heavy
duty training and tearing of their
muscles" could be back on the field
or on the court in a much shorter
amount of time, Conniff explained.
Freshman Michael Chow prac
ticed yoga while on his high school
tennis team.
"To make the stretching more

interesting, the coach incorporated
yoga into our stretching," Chow
said. "We would do mostly standing
poses, like tree pose where we had
to balance on one leg and stretch
somehow. The poses that we did in
high school mainly helped us with
balance and some flexibility,"
Chow said.
After playing four years of
high school tennis, Chow decided
to take intermediate yoga be
cause he hoped it would improve
his tennis game.
"I have found that doing inten
sive yoga on the side tremendous
ly increases flexibility, strength
and balance, makes you more
aware of your body, and encour
ages relaxation," he said. "I highly
recommend it for all athletes, es
pecially for [those engaged in]
sports that need quick movements
that require balance such as tennis
and football."
Conniff echoed Chow's com
ments, citing the other benefits of
yoga besides just greater flexibility
and strength.
"The sense of calm you get from
practicing yoga on a regular basis
can transfer onto the field where the
pressure's on which could be very
helpful for student athletes at Stan
ford," said Conniff.
Whether student athletes or
just students, Conniff added that
everyone should take advantage
of the yoga and Pilates classes of
fered at Stanford.
Students that cannot take yoga
at Stanford due to scheduling con
flicts have plenty of options around
Palp Alto (see box below) and
many forms, levels and intensities to
choose from.
According to Coniff, yoga class
once or twice a week may a great
stress-relief tool on campus.
She explained: "What I've heard
from some of my students is that
they don't get as stressed out as
much. They are able to float with
things better."

form of home exercise promoted by
movie stars like Madonna.Yoga
studios have cropped up every
where and new forms of yoga have
been created and fused with other
related exercises, such as combining
yoga and Pilates into "yogilates."
The yoga-craze is understandable:
Yoga can offer many benefits, both
spiritual and physical, to those who
choose to practice.
"The benefits of yoga are perva
sive," explained Stanford yoga in
structor Nancy Conniff. "They're
about the whole person. For me,
the biggest benefit has been, beside
the other health benefits of being
more flexible and having a stronger
core, its just being calmer. It's tak
ing time for yourself every day."
Conniff has been a group exer
cise instructor for 25 years and start
ed practicing yoga 8 years ago. She
has taught yoga and Pilates at Stan
ford for four years and especially
recommends flexibility exercises
for student athletes and those with
back pain.
Many Stanford students choose
to take Pilates Mat instead of yoga,
which has a similar foundation but
has many differences from yoga. Pi
lates was developed by Joseph Pi

lates for dancers as a series of core
strengthening techniques to im
prove abdominal and back strength.
"Pilates really helped me athlet
ically," said sophomore Rachel
Hsu. "Before, I never used to
stretch before running, but after
doing Pilates I learned some good
ways to get more flexible and relax
at the same time."
Conniff says the difference be
tween Pilates and yoga is that the
latter is more spiritual. Pilates, she
explained, uses the mind and the
body where as yoga is mind, body
and spirit."
The world is bigger than just us.
Yoga is tied to so many different
things... Yoga is about being part
of the class and also being your self
as parj of the group," Conniff said.
In its many forms (see top
box), yoga can be beneficial for
everyone but has proven espe
cially beneficial for both novice
and professional athletes.
"There have been studies that
have proven that not just yoga, but
any flexibility exercise for someone
who has a workout as arduous as
some of the student athletes at Stan
ford, can speed the recovery time by
30 percent," said Conniff. "People
that are doing some really heavy
duty training and tearing of their
muscles" could be back on the field
or on the court in a much shorter
amount of time, Conniff explained.
Freshman Michael Chow prac
ticed yoga while on his high school
tennis team.
"To make the stretching more

interesting, the coach incorporated
yoga into our stretching," Chow
said. "We would do mostly standing
poses, like tree pose where we had
to balance on one leg and stretch
somehow. The poses that we did in
high school mainly helped us with
balance and some flexibility,"
Chow said.
After playing four years of
high school tennis, Chow decided
to take intermediate yoga be
cause he hoped it would improve
his tennis game.
"I have found that doing inten
sive yoga on the side tremendous
ly increases flexibility, strength
and balance, makes you more
aware of your body, and encour
ages relaxation," he said. "I highly
recommend it for all athletes, es
pecially for [those engaged in]
sports that need quick movements
that require balance such as tennis
and football."
Conniff echoed Chow's com
ments, citing the other benefits of
yoga besides just greater flexibility
and strength.
"The sense of calm you get from
practicing yoga on a regular basis
can transfer onto the field where the
pressure's on which could be very
helpful for student athletes at Stan
ford," said Conniff.
Whether student athletes or
just students, Conniff added that
everyone should take advantage
of the yoga and Pilates classes of
fered at Stanford.
Students that cannot take yoga
at Stanford due to scheduling con
flicts have plenty of options around
Palp Alto (see box below) and
many forms, levels and intensities to
choose from.
According to Coniff, yoga class
once or twice a week may a great
stress-relief tool on campus.
She explained: "What I've heard
from some of my students is that
they don't get as stressed out as
much. They are able to float with
things better."

We've all seen them around,
strapped to backpacks, tucked
under arms, taking up your foot
room in chemistry lecture: those
multi-colored yoga mats. From the
nearly übiquitous nature of these
mats, it seems like every other stu
dent at Stanford has decided to take
up the art of yoga.
So what's the craze about? Is it
just me or does everyone who car
ries a mat seems more ... calm, re
laxed and focused. Indeed, yoga has
been proven to have many health
benefits, including stress relief,
greater flexibility and increased
concentration. Some coaches and
athletes are taking yoga outside of
the studio, as athletic trainers have
discovered the benefits of yoga for
serious athletes.
Yoga is based on three struc
tures: exercise, breathing and med
itation. The word comes from the
Sanskrit word "yuj," which trans
lates to the idea "to join or yoke to
gether." Spiritual practitioners of
yoga see themselves uniting their
soul with the Supreme Soul and
their individual will with the greater
Cosmic Will.
Yet this interpretation of yoga
may have come later: Contrary to
popular belief, yoga has no roots in
Hinduism. It evolved separately
and was later incorporated into reli
gious practices. Yoga is primarily an
exercise that focuses on the pos
tures — "asanas," as they are re
ferred to in Sanskrit — and breath

ing, the pranayama. Combining
fluid breath with the static or dy
namic postures leads to strength
building and greater flexibility.
Although yoga has existed for
thousands of years in India, it first
became popular in the United
States in the 1960s and, in the last
decade, it has become a mainstream
form of home exercise promoted by
movie stars like Madonna.Yoga
