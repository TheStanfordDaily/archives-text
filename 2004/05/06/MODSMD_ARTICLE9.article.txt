## Jealousy woes 
### VINNI INTERSIMONE SEX COLUMNIST 
"A competent and self-confident person is
incapable of jealousy in anything. Jealousy is
invariably a symptom of neurotic insecurity,"
said novelist Robert Heinlein.
According to him, then, I'm not only in
competent and insecure, I'm also neurotic.
He's probably right. I'm the most jealous
boyfriend you'll ever meet. I can't stand it
when my boyfriend mentions that another
guy is cute, I cringe when he hugs his guy
friends and I have emotional breakdowns
when he goes to gay clubs. Jealousy for me
is an uncontrollable wrenching of the stom
ach, a feeling like someone just punched
me in the heart. My reaction is not to keel
over in pain, but to attack back in anger.
Microsoft Word's dictionary defines
"neurotic" as "overanxious, oversensitive
or obsessive about everyday things." Hein
lein got it wrong: Jealousy is not just "a
symptom of neurotic insecurity," jealousy
is neurotic insecurity.
I'm not just jealous, I'm dictatorially
jealous. My boyfriend comes from a gay

culture very different from my own. He's
used to kissing his guy friends on the lips
when he greets them. Barely being able to
deal with him hugging guys, at the begin
ning of our relationship I quickly negotiat
ed a compromise: no kissing on the lips,
only on the cheeks. Thanks to his under
standing nature, he readily accepted.
You could liken it to how some girls ex
citedly hug every guy they are friends with
— is it always sexual? I don't think so. In
both cases, it is part of the culture.
Even so, I am left with a question that
hangs over my head: Should I have made him
change his behavior because of my jealousy?
Heinlein notes that a competent person
would not be capable of jealousy, but I'm a
fairly competent person. I've had success
ful relationships in the past and I couldn't
be happier in my current relationship. He
also notes that a self-confident person
would not be jealous, but the fact that 1
have absolutely no fears that my boyfriend
would ever cheat on me or leave me for
someone else is evidence of my confidence
in our relationship.
So what gives? If I'm a reasonably com

petent and self-confident person, why am I
neurotically insecure?
Jealousy is irrational. I know my

"Ifyou find yourself checking
your partner's AIM 'away'
messages at all times of the day
to double-check where he or
she is; then you may need to
identify why your jealousy is
getting out of control"

boyfriend finds me attractive. I know he
loves me and would not leave me. I also
know that if he ever did decide to leave me,
he would simply tell me, not cheat on me.
Jealousy doesn't stem from rational
thought It is simply a part of who I am.
Everyone experiences jealousy at some
point. Perhaps you catch your partner

glancing at someone else or you wonder
where he or she is when you can't seem to
get a hold of them. It is a part of caring for
other people. While some of these thoughts
may be reasonable, sometimes your jeal
ousy can get out of hand — like mine often
does — and identifying exactly what it is
that makes you jealous can keep a relation
ship healthy. Once you and your partner
find what is making you turn green with
envy or jealousy, you can help each other
by making small changes in the way each of
you acts.
As long as it doesn't strain the relation
ship, asking your partner to modify certain
behaviors is OK. What is not OK is to
keep track of your partner at any and all
times. If you find yourself checking your
partner's AIM "away" messages at all
times of the day to double-check where
she or he is, then you may need to identify
why your jealousy is getting out of control.
Perhaps your significant other's behavior
is overly flirtatious. Or perhaps you are
just overreacting. The key is compromise.
Could the two of you identify what is lead
ing to your insecurity?

My boyfriend and I have come to an
agreement: I'll restrain my jealousy as much
as I can, I'll tell him when I feel jealous and
we'll come up with ways to deal with it. For
the most part I've found that the first two
provisions of the compromise usually elimi
nate the problem. Telling myself to remain
calm and that I am simply being irrational
usually minimizes the pain.
Additionally, talking things over with my
boyfriend helps me realize how much he
cares about me, quieting down the green
eyed monster inside. When both of these
methods fail, my boyfriend and I come up
with a solution that is reasonable for both of
our emotions.
The moral of the story? I'm imperfect. I
can't control all of my emotions, but I owe it
to my boyfriend to try and he owes it to me to
help me try. Relationships are as much about
love and sex as they are about growing as a
person. I'm still jealous, but with the help of
my boy, I'm learning to deal with it.

or obsessive about everyday things." Hein
lein got it wrong: Jealousy is not just "a
symptom of neurotic insecurity," jealousy
is neurotic insecurity.
I'm not just jealous, I'm dictatorially
jealous. My boyfriend comes from a gay

culture very different from my own. He's
used to kissing his guy friends on the lips
when he greets them. Barely being able to
deal with him hugging guys, at the begin
ning of our relationship I quickly negotiat
ed a compromise: no kissing on the lips,
only on the cheeks. Thanks to his under
standing nature, he readily accepted.
You could liken it to how some girls ex
citedly hug every guy they are friends with
— is it always sexual? I don't think so. In
both cases, it is part of the culture.
Even so, I am left with a question that
hangs over my head: Should I have made him
change his behavior because of my jealousy?
Heinlein notes that a competent person
would not be capable of jealousy, but I'm a
fairly competent person. I've had success
ful relationships in the past and I couldn't
be happier in my current relationship. He
also notes that a self-confident person
would not be jealous, but the fact that 1
have absolutely no fears that my boyfriend
would ever cheat on me or leave me for
someone else is evidence of my confidence
in our relationship.
So what gives? If I'm a reasonably com

petent and self-confident person, why am I
neurotically insecure?
Jealousy is irrational. I know my

"Ifyou find yourself checking
your partner's AIM 'away'
messages at all times of the day
to double-check where he or
she is; then you may need to
identify why your jealousy is
getting out of control"

boyfriend finds me attractive. I know he
loves me and would not leave me. I also
know that if he ever did decide to leave me,
he would simply tell me, not cheat on me.
Jealousy doesn't stem from rational
thought It is simply a part of who I am.
Everyone experiences jealousy at some
point. Perhaps you catch your partner

glancing at someone else or you wonder
where he or she is when you can't seem to
get a hold of them. It is a part of caring for
other people. While some of these thoughts
may be reasonable, sometimes your jeal
ousy can get out of hand — like mine often
does — and identifying exactly what it is
that makes you jealous can keep a relation
ship healthy. Once you and your partner
find what is making you turn green with
envy or jealousy, you can help each other
by making small changes in the way each of
you acts.
As long as it doesn't strain the relation
ship, asking your partner to modify certain
behaviors is OK. What is not OK is to
keep track of your partner at any and all
times. If you find yourself checking your
partner's AIM "away" messages at all
times of the day to double-check where
she or he is, then you may need to identify
why your jealousy is getting out of control.
Perhaps your significant other's behavior
is overly flirtatious. Or perhaps you are
just overreacting. The key is compromise.
Could the two of you identify what is lead
ing to your insecurity?

My boyfriend and I have come to an
agreement: I'll restrain my jealousy as much
as I can, I'll tell him when I feel jealous and
we'll come up with ways to deal with it. For
the most part I've found that the first two
provisions of the compromise usually elimi
nate the problem. Telling myself to remain
calm and that I am simply being irrational
usually minimizes the pain.
Additionally, talking things over with my
boyfriend helps me realize how much he
cares about me, quieting down the green
eyed monster inside. When both of these
methods fail, my boyfriend and I come up
with a solution that is reasonable for both of
our emotions.
The moral of the story? I'm imperfect. I
can't control all of my emotions, but I owe it
to my boyfriend to try and he owes it to me to
help me try. Relationships are as much about
love and sex as they are about growing as a
person. I'm still jealous, but with the help of
my boy, I'm learning to deal with it.

"A competent and self-confident person is
incapable of jealousy in anything. Jealousy is
invariably a symptom of neurotic insecurity,"
said novelist Robert Heinlein.
According to him, then, I'm not only in
competent and insecure, I'm also neurotic.
He's probably right. I'm the most jealous
boyfriend you'll ever meet. I can't stand it
when my boyfriend mentions that another
guy is cute, I cringe when he hugs his guy
friends and I have emotional breakdowns
when he goes to gay clubs. Jealousy for me
is an uncontrollable wrenching of the stom
ach, a feeling like someone just punched
me in the heart. My reaction is not to keel
over in pain, but to attack back in anger.
