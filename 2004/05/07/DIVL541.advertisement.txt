Hey, Gamers. Is it in you? Because, if it really is in
YOU ALREADY, 1 JUST HOPE THAT YOU THOUGHT THINGS
THROUGH AND ANTICIPATED THE CHALLENGES THAT LIE
AHEAD. IF IT ISN'T IN YOU YET. YOU'LL KNOW WHEN IT'S A
GOOD TIME TO LET YOUR THIRST FOR A QUICK SOLUTION
BE YOUR GUIDE. ANYWAY, I GUESS WE CAN ALL AGREE
THAT FATIGUE IS A FORMIDABLE FOE. BUT IF YOU WOULD
REALIZE THAT SOMETIMES THE ANSWER REALLY IS RIGHT
IN FRONT OF YOU, YOU'LL BE MOVING ON IN NO TIME.
Stay safe out there, kids. Don't drive drowsy
