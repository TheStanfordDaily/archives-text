# Prof. helps get voting machines in state decertified
## 
### ANN CHIN STAFF WRITER 
After more than a year of pressure from leaders like Computer Science Prof.
David Dill, California Secretary of State Kevin Shelley banned the use of touch
screen voting machines in four counties last Friday and decertified all touch
screen voting systems in the state until security concerns have been resolved.
Dill, who called the stale's use of electronic voting machines "reckless,"
founded the Web site http://www.verifiedvoting.org a year ago to lobby for
paper records of electronic votes.
Dill's organization is largely credited with bringing the problems of electron
ic voting to the attention of the state government.
"I think we started the whole issue in California," he said, 'it wasn't an issue
until we made it one."
The idea for VerifiedVoting.org started with a petition on Dill's Stanford
Web site to prevent the use of voting equipment that cannot be audited. Dill said
that so far more than 7,000 people have signed the resolution.
Voters fear that insecure machines could make elections vulnerable to hack
ing, or that faulty software could lead to inaccurately tallied votes, Dill said.
"The problem with electronic voting is too much reliance on computer tech
nology," he explained. "You have no idea whether your vote is recorded accu
rately or not, and there's no way to check because there's no record ... It's like
eliminating the accounting department from a bank and then claiming there's no
embezzlement going on."
According to a May 1 article in the New York Times, more than 14.000 ma
chines made by Diebold Inc. were banned in California for the upcoming No
vember election after some malfunctioned during primary elections in March.
The state accused Diebold of installing software on its machines in several
counties without testing them at the state or federal level, thereby violating
state laws.
Dill and other computer scientists sparked the statewide debate when Santa
Clara County announced that it was going to install electronic voting machines.
" People who know about computers know that they're not perfect," Dill said.
"What really bothers me is not having the ability to verify election results."
The group's actions led the Secretary of State to create the Taskforce on
Touch-Screen Voting and played a major role in the decision to improve touch
screen machines statewide.
"There will be a paper trail for every single vote cast in the state of California,
and it will happen on my watch," Shelly said in a press release last week. "By May
30, the state of California will have standards in place for Accessible, Voter-Ver
ified Paper Audit Trail."
Because local governments have most authority over voting methods, the use
of electronic voting varies widely across the country.
Georgia has already adopted statewide electronic voting, but New Hamp
shire recently passed a resolution not to allow electronic voting without a paper
trail. Dill said. In California, electronic systems were first introduced in River
side County but have now spread to a total of 10 counties in the state.
Electronic voting was originally introduced to make it easier and more con
venient for all eligible voters, including those with disabilities, to cast ballots.
Many opponents of the current system favor an alternative that would allow
voters to use touch-screen machines that also record votes on paper.
"The minimum condition is to have a paper ballot that voters can review for
accuracy," Dill said.
He suggested designing a machine that derives the electronic record from the
paper record and performing enough recounts to double check the accuracy of
the machine.
This past March was the first time touch-screen voting was used for a major
election in Santa Clara County.
An overwhelming majority of voters gave positive feedback on the new ma
chines because they were easier to use, said Elma Rosas, a spokesperson for
the Santa Clara County Registrar
of Voters.
"We haven't had problems with
it," she added. "We were one of the
counties selected by the state for par
allel monitoring in the last election,
and our system performed with 100
percent accuracy."
The county's former system of
punch-card voting has also been de
certified by the state, so the county
plans on continuing to use electronic
voting. Voters who do not want to
use the touch-screens can use an op
tical scan process to record their
paper votes.
The county is now moving to meet
the requirements issued by the Secre
tary of State last week, Rosas said.
Many Stanford students have also

expressed favorable responses to the
new electronic voting system, espe
cially with new safeguards.
"I think the most important thing
is that there's a paper trail in case an
election is contested, so the public
can legitimize the results," said
sophomore Jonathan Elkin, who
used touch-screen voting in the re
cent Democratic primaries. "Call me
naive, but I'm less concerned about
hacking because if it was ever ex
posed, it would be so politically de
structive that the risks would out
weigh the benefits."
Junior Alex Marshall, who also
voted in the primaries, said he was
not at all worried about the risks of
electronic voting.
"It seems a lot easier because
there's no ambiguity, fewer errors
and faster results than when people
count ballots by hand," he said. "Nei
ther system is perfect, and there's a
lot more convenience involved in the
electronic system."

" People who know about computers know that they're not perfect," Dill said.
"What really bothers me is not having the ability to verify election results."
The group's actions led the Secretary of State to create the Taskforce on
Touch-Screen Voting and played a major role in the decision to improve touch
screen machines statewide.
"There will be a paper trail for every single vote cast in the state of California,
and it will happen on my watch," Shelly said in a press release last week. "By May
30, the state of California will have standards in place for Accessible, Voter-Ver
ified Paper Audit Trail."
Because local governments have most authority over voting methods, the use
of electronic voting varies widely across the country.
Georgia has already adopted statewide electronic voting, but New Hamp
shire recently passed a resolution not to allow electronic voting without a paper
trail. Dill said. In California, electronic systems were first introduced in River
side County but have now spread to a total of 10 counties in the state.
Electronic voting was originally introduced to make it easier and more con
venient for all eligible voters, including those with disabilities, to cast ballots.
Many opponents of the current system favor an alternative that would allow
voters to use touch-screen machines that also record votes on paper.
"The minimum condition is to have a paper ballot that voters can review for
accuracy," Dill said.
He suggested designing a machine that derives the electronic record from the
paper record and performing enough recounts to double check the accuracy of
the machine.
This past March was the first time touch-screen voting was used for a major
election in Santa Clara County.
An overwhelming majority of voters gave positive feedback on the new ma
chines because they were easier to use, said Elma Rosas, a spokesperson for
the Santa Clara County Registrar
of Voters.
"We haven't had problems with
it," she added. "We were one of the
counties selected by the state for par
allel monitoring in the last election,
and our system performed with 100
percent accuracy."
The county's former system of
punch-card voting has also been de
certified by the state, so the county
plans on continuing to use electronic
voting. Voters who do not want to
use the touch-screens can use an op
tical scan process to record their
paper votes.
The county is now moving to meet
the requirements issued by the Secre
tary of State last week, Rosas said.
Many Stanford students have also

expressed favorable responses to the
new electronic voting system, espe
cially with new safeguards.
"I think the most important thing
is that there's a paper trail in case an
election is contested, so the public
can legitimize the results," said
sophomore Jonathan Elkin, who
used touch-screen voting in the re
cent Democratic primaries. "Call me
naive, but I'm less concerned about
hacking because if it was ever ex
posed, it would be so politically de
structive that the risks would out
weigh the benefits."
Junior Alex Marshall, who also
voted in the primaries, said he was
not at all worried about the risks of
electronic voting.
"It seems a lot easier because
there's no ambiguity, fewer errors
and faster results than when people
count ballots by hand," he said. "Nei
ther system is perfect, and there's a
lot more convenience involved in the
electronic system."
After more than a year of pressure from leaders like Computer Science Prof.
David Dill, California Secretary of State Kevin Shelley banned the use of touch
screen voting machines in four counties last Friday and decertified all touch
screen voting systems in the state until security concerns have been resolved.
Dill, who called the stale's use of electronic voting machines "reckless,"
founded the Web site http://www.verifiedvoting.org a year ago to lobby for
paper records of electronic votes.
Dill's organization is largely credited with bringing the problems of electron
ic voting to the attention of the state government.
"I think we started the whole issue in California," he said, 'it wasn't an issue
until we made it one."
The idea for VerifiedVoting.org started with a petition on Dill's Stanford
Web site to prevent the use of voting equipment that cannot be audited. Dill said
that so far more than 7,000 people have signed the resolution.
Voters fear that insecure machines could make elections vulnerable to hack
ing, or that faulty software could lead to inaccurately tallied votes, Dill said.
"The problem with electronic voting is too much reliance on computer tech
nology," he explained. "You have no idea whether your vote is recorded accu
rately or not, and there's no way to check because there's no record ... It's like
eliminating the accounting department from a bank and then claiming there's no
embezzlement going on."
According to a May 1 article in the New York Times, more than 14.000 ma
chines made by Diebold Inc. were banned in California for the upcoming No
vember election after some malfunctioned during primary elections in March.
The state accused Diebold of installing software on its machines in several
counties without testing them at the state or federal level, thereby violating
state laws.
