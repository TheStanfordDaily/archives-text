# Int'l students hit roadblocks at Cal

(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. — UC-Berkeley ju
nior and ASUC Senator Imad Ahmed knows all too well
the difficulties of being an international student in post-
Sept. 11,2001 America.
Little more than a year ago, he spent several sleepless
nights worrying about whether he would be able to meet
his rapidly approaching registration deadline with the
Bureau of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services so
that he could continue his studies at UC Berkeley.
"During that time. 1 was waking up in cold sweats,"
said Ahmed, a Pakistani-born English citizen who had
to undergo a special registration process aimed at male
visa-holders of predominantly Muslim nationalities.
Ahmed is not alone in his frustration with what many
international students consider an unwelcoming and in
efficient U.S. immigration service.
Sixty percent of international students and scholars
at UC Berkeley experienced significant delays at U.S.
consulates or embassies in obtaining visas for entering
the country, according to a campus-wide study released
by the Graduate Division last week.
More than 40 percent of survey respondents said they
encountered difficulties in arranging for family and
friends to visit from abroad, and almost three-fifths re
ported trouble in making plans to travel to or from the
United States once they had acquired visas.
The study, conducted through an anonymous e-mail
survey, received feedback from more than 1,688 UC
Berkeley international students and scholars.
Many members of a campus task force that analyzed
the data said the findings were expected, considering the
various immigration policy changes initiated by the fed
eral government since September 2001.

Many critics of the current immigration process fear
that the hostile atmosphere encountered by internation
al students has already caused a "brain drain" in U.S.
academics, particularly in scientific fields, said Robert
Price, assistant vice chancellor for research.
"Our stature as the premier center for cutting edge
research in science and engineering is under threat,"
Price said. "The best and the brightest from around the
world who would look for the United States are now
going to start looking elsewhere."
New requirements for foreign students include
mandatory interviews prior to visa authorization and
approval from a federal panel for international schol
ars entering "sensitive fields of study" such as nu
clear engineering.
The study also included personal testimony from stu
dents describing the hostility they met when first enter
ing the United States.
University officials say there is little they can do to
change immigration policy and ease the strain on for
eign students.
However, UC-Berkeley officials are participating in
a nationwide lobbying effort to reduce many of the bu
reaucratic hurdles, although the prospects for significant
policy change remain slim. Price said.
On campus, the task force on international students
responded to the survey with several tentative recom
mendations aimed at creating a friendlier environment
for foreign students.
The committee proposed creating an online service
akin to Bear Facts that would allow students to check
the status of their visa paperwork and other docu
ments, as well as an increase in staff devoted to advis
ing foreign students.
The recommendations are set for official approval
later this week.
