School spirit
Stanford is seriously in need of some school spir
it. Sure, we all love our school for everything it
has to offer. Our stand-out sports teams, our
top-of-the-line academics, our beautiful cam
pus. Everyone has a special place in her heart for her
good ol' alma mater.
But we're not talking about rah-rah-go-Stanford
kind of school spirit. We're talking the other kind of
spirit: ghosts. Stanford is desperately in need of an offi
cial school ghost.
Just kidding. We're not that desperate for column
ideas. Okay, maybe we are. But what we're really talk-

ing about is spirit in the
finest sense of the word:
distilled liquor.
On Tuesday, the Al
abama Senate voted to
make Conecuh Ridge
Fine Alabama Whiskey
the official state spirit,
overriding Governor
Bob Riley's veto against
the proposition. This de
cision ranks the whiskey
among other official state

symbols, like the yellowhammer state bird, the large
mouth bass as the official fresh water fish and the pecan
as the official state nut.
Now, we're not saying that Stanford is in any way its
own state, or that if it were it would be anything re
motely like Alabama. We just think that Alabama has
caught onto something really big, and we don't think
Stanford should be left behind.
The question is, what would Stanford's school spirit
be? We know that Santa Clara's official drink would be
Hooch, obviously. UC-Berkeley's would clearly be
Winner's Cup, because as much as they'd like to believe
they're cool, they're actually just a cheap imitation of a
good thing. We think Harvard's should be Dom
Perignon — not because it's the best, but because it's
overpriced, pretentious and too much of it gives you a
horrible hangover.
It's not an easy task to sum up everyone's unique,
personal Stanford experience into one little shot — but
we're going to try. Hennessy comes to mind as the obvi
ous choice. But how many of us really interact with
Hennessy on a daily basis? Only when you go to Ernie's
to pick up some Hypnotiq on your birthday and they
throw in a free mini-bottle of the stuff so you can make
the Incredible Hulk, but that's only once a year.
It really depends on what kind of people we think
most accurately represent Stanford as a whole. Corona
with lime might work — any pussy can drink it. Kahlua
would work for the hardcore students — that coffee fla
vor brings them back to all those late nights in the
Meyer 24-hour study room. Rubbing alcohol, for all the
desperate freshman that have to rely on last resorts due
to the new Alcohol Policy. Jack Daniels, the only man
that any woman at Stanford can count on — he'll al
ways give you what you want, when you want it and
you're in control (as long as you want to be).
What about something that encompasses all of Stan
ford students? Hot Damn would be a good option — we
already mentioned our stellar academics and athletics,
and then there's the fact that Stanford women are wide
ly known as the most attractive college students in the
country. Goldschlager, not to be confused with Gold
man Sachs, is also in the running, because we all hope
that our expensive Stanford educations will bring us
more than just a couple specks of gold in the future. We
like Kirschwasser, because even though we don't know
what it is, it kind of sounds like Kirchofer and everyone
loves Stanford basketball. Captain Morgan's is always
nice, because pirates were SOO in this 2003-2004 school
year and because it's the first thing Caroline ever drank
(and, coincidentally, the first thing she threw up).
But then again, this discussion is pretty irrelevant.
Nobody drinks at Stanford; everyone just studies! We'll
leave this important decision up to the Board of
Trustees, the real drinkers at Stanford. The students
just don't have time.

and then there's the fact that Stanford women are wide
ly known as the most attractive college students in the
country. Goldschlager, not to be confused with Gold
man Sachs, is also in the running, because we all hope
that our expensive Stanford educations will bring us
more than just a couple specks of gold in the future. We
like Kirschwasser, because even though we don't know
what it is, it kind of sounds like Kirchofer and everyone
loves Stanford basketball. Captain Morgan's is always
nice, because pirates were SOO in this 2003-2004 school
year and because it's the first thing Caroline ever drank
(and, coincidentally, the first thing she threw up).
But then again, this discussion is pretty irrelevant.
Nobody drinks at Stanford; everyone just studies! We'll
leave this important decision up to the Board of
Trustees, the real drinkers at Stanford. The students
just don't have time.
