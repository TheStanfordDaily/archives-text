# Happy Wednesday
## Getting over the hump with live music and beer (but only if you're over 21 and have SUID) 
### MIKE DUCA 
On Wednesday nights, when
many Stanford students are still
stabbing pencils into their eyes
deep in the bowels of Green Li
brary, a cheerful crowd can always
be found across campus in the
smelly halls of campus co-op EBF.
Although the whip-yielding
puritans over at the Office of Stu
dent Activities may have forced
EBF to officially call their night
"Happy Wednesday," to regulars
it will always just be Happy Hour.
Depending on whom you ask,
Happy Hour is either the best or
the smelliest party on campus,
and sometimes both. Each week,
there's either a DJ spinning or a
band jamming. Whether the
music is reggae, trance or techno,
a healthy crowd of diverse-look
ing partiers get their groove on
in the common room-turned
dance floor. Yes, their dancing
may look like ritualistic prayer,
but they are 110 percent harm
less. There hasn't been a sacri
fice for years.
"I love going when they have
reggae music, and 1 dig the hippie
boys too," said senior Emily Yette.
Happy Hour reveals the other
side of Stanford parties — the side
that does not include Top 40
Radio hits or even those hot new
Prada purses. Still, the occasional
frat boy does sneak in.
"It's good for a mellow party
atmosphere, which is in stark con
trast to parties at the fraterni
ties,"said senior Phil Sayegh.
"Also, it's great to have a regu
lar party on Wednesdays when
there is usually nothing else hap
pening. It's a chill break right in the
middle of the hectic school week. It
helps you get over the hump."
Many fans of Happy Hour
claim that the music is the biggest
draw. Senior Emily Nahas says
that "it's a great opportunity to
hear great bands."
The social manager of EBF, se
nior lan Comfort, says music is at
the heart of the weekly parties.
"We bring an eclectic variety of
musical acts to campus that
wouldn't otherwise be playing
here," Comfort said.
He added, "(Happy Hour| fos
ters the Stanford music scene — it
serves as an inroad for campus

bands. We love having Stanford
bands play here, and I think we do
those bands a service by giving
them a venue. Many campus
bands have started out playing
at EBF and moved on to bigger
gigs elsewhere."

"Happy Hour reveals the other
side of Stanford parties — the
side that does not include Top
40 Radio hits or even those hot
new Prada purses."

Despite the music, there are
many who do not feel Happy Hour
fits their needs. Strange smells top
the list of complaints.
"I went for a couple of weeks,
but it just reeks," rhymed senior
Adriane Gamble.

Others agree that smelliness
taints the Happy Hour experi
ence, particularly the smells of
smoke — cigarettes, incense and
sometimes even marijuana.
EBF's reputation as a "hippie,
druggie" place has some merit, al-

though residents universally ac
knowledge that drug prevalence is
much less than in years past.
Nevertheless, a strong contin
gent of cigarette smokers gener
ally is found socializing on the
main deck.

Happy Hour tends to attract
partiers who feel disenfran
chised by the regular party scene
at Stanford.
"I prefer EBF because there
are a lot of upperclassmen, and
they dress normally. People want
to talk to me, not freak me,"
Nahas said.
"People come by EBF in the
middle of the week not because
they want to impress a lot of peo
ple or get roaring drunk, but be
cause they want to relax a little be
fore facing Thursday and Friday
classes," Comfort said.
The party generally extends be
yond the main deck and common
room into the hallways and bed
rooms of individual residents. In
many ways Happy Hour is not just
one party, but many small parties
put together.
"I invite a lot of friends to
Happy Hour every week. A lot
of the people wouldn't normal
ly come to EBF, but they have
fun hanging out in my room be
cause there's always a little
crowd, and people come and go,"
said junior Guillermo Vargas, an
EBF resident.
