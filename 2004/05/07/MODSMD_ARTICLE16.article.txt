## Go to Stanford Powwow 
### 
The 33rd annual Stanford Powwow, hosted
by the Stanford American Indian Organi
zation (SAIO), represents one of our
campus' best events. We encourage stu
dents, faculty and staff to attend its activities over
the next three days.
Stanford Powwow promotes community and
cultural awareness with the celebration of native
cultures through traditional and modern songs,
dances, art and programming. Further, it does all
this on an impressive scale. Powwow annually at
tracts over 30,000 participants of both American
Indian and non-American Indian descent. This
makes it one of the largest student-run powwows
in the United States, and the largest on the West
Coast. Its attraction extends beyond the immedi
ate event, as Stanford leverages this event in stu
dent recruitment, particularly among American
Indian and other student of color populations.
These successes exemplify the highest quality
of student programming at Stanford â€” Pow
wow's many events are organized, coordinated
and hosted by American Indian undergraduate
and graduate students at Stanford. Powwow
preparations are meticulous and extensive; plan
ning is a year-long project and begins as soon as
the previous powwow is over. We commend this

year's committee chairs, Jerold Blain and Grace
Bull Tail, as well as this year's treasurer. Crystal
Ipalook, for their dedication and hard work.
This year. Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni, Provost John Etchemendy and
President John Hennessy deserve particular
praise for committing University funds. These
funds served as a financial backbone for the Pow
wow. and ensured its continuance as a free event
open to the public.
Fundraising for the Stanford Powwow previ
ously has come at the expense of American Indi
an students. University support such as this year's
funding is critical in alleviating the financial bur
den on these students. For this reason, we hope
that the University can continue its financial sup
port in future years.
We strongly urge Stanford students to check
out the Powwow this weekend and support the
efforts of SAIO and the many volunteers. Stu
dents need to express their interest in the widely
celebrated, long-standing tradition of the Pow
wow weekend. This will both show gratitude for
the many hours our peers have put into its plan
ning and carrying out, as well as encourage Uni
versity officials to continue their financial sup
port of Powwow.
