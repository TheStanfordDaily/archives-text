# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Be reasonable, pleasonable

Tolerance is a skill that re
quires years of diligent in
trospection. As with any
skill, there are those who
take pride in their own talents no
matter how embarrassingly remedi
al they are. To me, the sound of a
person spurting the phrase "I don't
tolerate the intolerant" is like
William Hung mutilating that al
ready-stupid song, "She Bangs".
The phrase itself has that cute
symmetry of sound that gives aspir
ing "tolerants" a catchy way to dis
tance themselves from that
monotonous glob of "intolerants"
who ought to be opposed, silenced
and shunned. To tolerance-ama
teurs it sounds noble, but the state
ment is glaringly hypocritical.
Suppose 1 approach you at a
demonstration in White Plaza and
say. "1 tolerate French taxi driving
bigamists with eyebrow-less off
spring. No one else." Wouldn't
you consider me "intolerant" for
all the people for whom my toler
ance doesn't apply? This isn't a
question of a half-full / half-empty
glass of water. Optimists and pes
simists should agree — tolerance
is either thoroughly inclusive or it
doesn't count.
When you dismiss someone's ar
guments based on preconceptions
of how he thinks, you get a whop
ping "Close, but no cigar" sticker in
the tolerance column on your moral
report card.
This doesn't mean you can't dis
agree with people or engage in pas
sionate dialogue. Intolerance is a
mutable quality to which we are all
susceptible; it can be addressed
with hearty portions of reasonable
debate. The problem with political

correctness is that racially hyper
sensitive people silence that debate
by dropping linguistic bombs like
"racism" and "discrimination" with

the caution of a
whiskey - i m -
bibed rhinoceros
in a rat-ridden
china closet.
It's hurtful
and dumb.
The word
"racist" is as
much a weapon
in discourse as
any epithet you
can imagine —

and it can burn some innocent peo
ple. Many of us have a tendency to
bite our lips when someone unrea
sonably attributes the actions of this
person or that institution to some
inherent cureless discriminatory
disease called "hate." The burden is
on us to counter him or her with
sound, valid arguments.
D.J. Hanson did just that in a let
ter to the editor this week ("Daily's
columnists lack respect for interna
tional faculty, TAs," May 2), ad
dressing Antony Liu's claims that
Mac Levine and I had written
columns with "racial and discrimi
natory" language.
I admit that my column was in
sensitive in regards to lecturers
(you shouldn't just ignore them if
they've already got the job), but
Antony attempted to support his
argument with one of our genera
tion's most powerful stigmas — ex
ploiting our sensitivity to the
world's race issues. None of it was
relevant, however, and I'm glad
that D.J. slapped Antony back
down in his chair like a little bitch

— to think it over some more.
Perhaps I am just a suburban
raised white kid, but I think that
race issues are often over-inflated in
the context of our fight for a happy
world. Amid eruptions of contro
versy over Abercrombie & Fitch t
shirts or the under-representation
of certain ethnicities in The Daily's
Full Moon on the Quad photo col
lage last year, 1 think of the mental
ly ill eating donuts out of garbage
cans, bankrupt family men who
have their brains blown out for life
insurance plans and the millions of
people around the world who are
oppressed by real whips, real guns
and real famine.
It's good for perspective.
I find it sad that so many avid tol
erance-enthusiasts suffer from such
a lack of creativity. Anybody can
identify intolerance in regards to
race or religion, but how many peo
ple are clever enough to see it in less
mainstream genres: physical attrac
tiveness, social skills, weight, height,
interests, privilege, occupation, po
litical perspective, degree of en
lightenment ... ?
I'll confess that I'm weak in some
of those categories — like when I
rant about big business or reality
TV contestants — but who doesn't
have room to improve?
My advice (and I will heed it,
too): Try to address your own intol
erance before you pounce on your
peers. And confine your pounce to
justified bounds.

AJ Magnuson is as racist as the
Dalai Lama. Before e-mailing
him at ajmagnu@stanford.edu,
take a few deep breaths and, per
haps, an anti-depressant.
