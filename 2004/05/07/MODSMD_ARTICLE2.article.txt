# Draw results delayed until today, deadline moved for house choices

Students expecting to find their Draw numbers posted at hous
ing offices or on Axess in the past couple of days were disappoint
ed, as the much-anticipated yearly release of these numbers was de
layed yesterday due to computer glitches. The numbers should be
released today, according to Todd Benson, director of Housing As
signment Services.
The reason for the delay, according to Benson, is to ensure that
the new system being used to assign housing is working properly
before any draw numbers are released.
"We needed to run some checks and make a few tweaks to the
system in order to make sure that the random number process was
working correctly before actually posting the numbers," he said.
The main difference between the new and old system is the type
of server that is being used. The old system was based on a main
frame — one of the last systems to use the now defunct computer
— while the new system is run on Linux servers.
"After we roll out the system this year, we're hopeful that the
new system will allow some real advantages to students," Benson

said. "In the future, for example, we hope to increase the number
of housing choices from 8 to either 12 or 16."
Although several students have complained about difficulties
with the new system, Benson emphasized that given the complexi
ties of Stanford's housing application process, every year there is
an occasional glitch or bug.
"This was true even with the old system, which was refined and
tested over a 10-year period," he said.
"This year's no different — we have had a few bugs with the sys
tem, which is to be expected with a new piece of software," Benson
said. "There isn't anything which we anticipate will affect the hous
ing assignment process, which we expect will run in much the same
way as it has done in the past."
In order to remedy the delay in the release of draw numbers,
Housing is moving the deadline to enter housing preferences back
from this Sunday night, May 9, to Tuesday, May 11 at 11:59 p.m.
Some students said they still felt left in the dark.
"Housing doesn't even inform the students what's going on,"
said sophomore Brian Nguyen. "It's annoying not knowing when
Draw numbers are coming out or when deadlines have changed.
They should at least send e-mails out to keep students informed."
