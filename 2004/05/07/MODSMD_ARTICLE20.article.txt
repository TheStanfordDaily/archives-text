Don't mess with Ben.
Straight out of the 19705,
Ben and his sideburns
preside over the Bing
Wing exit of Green Library until
midnight, Sunday through Thurs
day. If you're thinking of trying to
sneak unchecked-out library books
past him, think again. You don't
want Alfonso — a man of portly
stature and quiet authority — to
have to come over from the East
Wing exit to deal with you.
These are the kind of things
you think about when spending all
together too much time in the
Stanford University library sys
tem. If you're not often there
yourself, perhaps you have a
friend who hasn't been around too
much in the past weeks as the
specter of a thesis deadline looms
large. Perhaps he's been thinking
these same thoughts.
As for me, I've been thinking
about Europe. While the lead-up to
the war in Iraq made the idea of a
common European security policy
seem farcical, such a policy does in
fact exist, and its shape has been de
termined in large part by the United
States. Viewing Iraq from a histori
cal perspective extending from the
end of the Cold War, a pattern of
communication between the United
States and the European Union
(E.U.) emerges.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall,
the United States sought to convert
the North Atlantic Treaty Organi
zation (NATO) from a defense or
ganization into a political club that
"secured" the influence of U.S. pol
icy in Europe. The United States

consistently encouraged European
military integration from the 1991
Maastricht treaty, which ambitious
ly declared a Common Foreign and

Security Policy,
to the 1999 adop
tion of plans for a
Rapid Reaction
Force. However,
the United States
has continued to
stress that all de
velopments must
respect the domi
nant position of
NATO — and by
extension the

United States — in Europe.
The United States has done this
by trying to focus Europe on the de
velopment of its capabilities (e.g.
building transport planes and train
ing quickly-deployable troops) and
by discouraging the creation of au
tonomous European structures
(like a separate headquarters or in
telligence-gathering outside of the
NATO structure).
Yet for all that influence, the
United States has gotten exactly the
opposite of what it wanted in Eu
rope. E.U. capabilities remain high
ly limited, but the political sensibili
ty that surrounds its defense policy
has blossomed, and Europe increas
ingly defines itself as separate from
the United States. The result is what
one might call the Transatlantic Se
curity Paradox.
The epitome of this paradox
came in the form of a little-discussed
European peacekeeping mission to
Bunia, Congo last year. After many
observers of the Iraq crisis heralded

the death of the common European
security policy, the first ever wholly
European force (both headquarters
and troops) traveled to Africa to
keep the peace in the face of a brew
ing civil war.
That the leaders of Congo actual
ly invited the 1,800 E.U. peacekeep
ers to handle the insurrection indi
cates that the Transatlantic Security
Paradox is more about foreign poli
cy than about defense. Prussian
King Frederick the Great once said,
"diplomacy without armaments is
like music without instruments."
His words ring true, today. The ex
periences of the Gulf, Balkan and
Iraqi wars taught E.U. leaders that
when the United States supplies the
force, it dictates the policy as well.
In an era when, for the first time,
Europe and the United States seek
potentially different objectives in
international affairs, the E.U. has
learned that robust foreign policy
requires a minimum of muscle be
hind it. The E.U. has the United
States to thank both for that lesson
and for the resurgent political iden
tity that is founded upon the contin
ued development of an independent
security policy.
As for those thesis-writers of the
world, we can be secure in knowing
that Ben and the library crew will be
there as we endure a few more
sleepless nights. While things in Eu
rope are just beginning; luckily, for
me it's almost over.
