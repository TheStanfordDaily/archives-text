Protester explains sign that
expressed shame at being Jewish
Signs carried at demonstra
tions are at best a limited means
of communication, so I would like
to explain why I carried the sign
John Felstiner objected to in his
letter of May 4 ("Open letter to
an anti-Zionist protester"). The
occasion was "Israel Pride Day."
Because Israel's actions fill me
with shame rather than pride, my
sign said, "I am ashamed, and I
am a Jew."
I am ashamed that a state that
purports to represent Jews every
where is undermining the precepts
and values that for thousands of
years have been traditional to the
Jewish people: justice, tolerance
and compassion. I am ashamed of a
Jewish state that has robbed anoth
er people of their land and water,
destroys their homes and imprisons
them behind walls. I am ashamed of
a state that allows young soldiers to
humiliate and torment people at

checkpoints, carries out assassina
tions with helicopter missiles that
kill innocent people and sends F-16
jets to bomb crowded apartment
houses. And I am ashamed of a
country where a rabbi can face three
years in jail for protesting the demo
lition of a home.
Prof. Felstiner writes of an Is
raeli friend's "hard-earned right
to say she's ashamed and an
gered." and suggests others don't
have that right. But as an Ameri
can whose government supports
and subsidizes Israel's actions,
and as a Jew who deplores the
crimes being committed in the
name of the Jewish people, I have
not only the right, but the obliga
tion to protest.

Professor responds to criticisms
of his involvement in Chile
I was disappointed with your ar
ticle titled "Labor committee's ef

ficacy questioned" (May 5). At this
time, it would be inappropriate for
me to write on behalf of the com
mittee, so let me restrict myself to
the article's uncomplimentary
comments that were directed to
me personally.
Your article thoroughly misrep
resents my role. You state that I
served "as chief advisor to Chile's
Labor Minister under the dictator
Augusto Pinochet". Permit me to
give you more precise information.
Pinochet had made collective bar
gaining illegal; my task was to help
restore collective bargaining. I visit
ed Santiago for just under a month
in the spring of 1979 and my advice
to the minister of labor was limited
to those weeks, nothing before and
nothing after.
When I arrived, no collective
bargaining involving labor unions
was permitted and unions were re
pressed. Within a week or so of my
departure, collective bargaining in
volving labor unions was legal. My
role was to provide the minister of
labor with information about collec

tive bargaining and unionism in
other countries and to advise about
how best to structure the collective
bargaining system. The principal
goal was to reestablish collective
bargaining in Chile.
1 advised a system that gave
unions a considerable amount of
freedom to organize and bargain
with firms. Not all my advice was
accepted, but a large measure of it
was. I regard it as a success that,
after democracy was restored in
Chile, the system I advocated re
mains largely intact. In other
words, successive democratic gov
ernments in Chile have chosen to
retain the system I helped to de
sign. It is a system that has helped
make Chile the best economic per
former in Latin America with a
growth in real incomes for workers
that other Latin American work
ers would envy.
I have never kept my role for
those few weeks in Chile a secret.
Far from it, I am pleased to have had
a significant hand in designing a sys
tem that has proved durable, that

has served workers' interests and
that has been advocated as a model
for other countries. My visit to Chile
appears on mv curriculum vitae and
I have been invited to write articles
based on the experience. If you
want to read what I advised, you
may consult an article I wrote for a
1997 Brookings Institution volume:
"The Legal Framework for Collec
tive Bargaining in Developing
Countries," in Labor Markets in
Latin America: Combining Social
Protection with Market Flexibility.
I should add that 1 have offered the
very same advice to democratic gov
ernments such as South Korea and,
recently. Indonesia.
I am also confused as to why this
single brief experience involving
Chile 25 years ago selected to char
acterize me. There is much else
that I have done. For instance, I
have served as expert witness in
many discrimination cases, almost
always representing workers
claiming discrimination. Or you
might have selected a monograph I
wrote for the Russell Sage Foun

dation three years ago. In this, I
make the case for worker owner
ship and worker control of deci
sion-making within firms. Is this
also "problematic?"
Finally, this mischaracterization
would not have arisen if your re
porter had troubled to contact me
about these interpretations of my
role in Chile. Before publishing
their articles, professional re
porters usually give an individual
an opportunity to respond to the
unflattering depictions of him
drawn by others.

Stanford needs ta adopt a
workers' Code of Conduct
I'm writing to elaborate on a
statement made in Wednesday's
Article, "Labor Committee's Effi
cacy Questioned" (May 5). The ar
ticle states that "no low-wage
worker —which [SLAC] defines
as someone who earns less than the
recommended living wage — actu
ally sits on the committee." 1 find it
ridiculous that a committee was
created in order to examine work
ing conditions of low-wage work
ers, only to exclude people from
that population on the committee.
Who better to speak to the prob
lems and areas being examined by
the committee than workers them
selves? It would undoubtedly be
thought absurd if a committee was
created in order to examine faculty
life on campus, but then no faculty
were on the committee.
I think the lack of worker
voice in this process is illustrative
of Stanford's overall poor treat
ment of the workers who ensure
that life on campus runs smooth
ly. I would love to see Stanford
set a positive example for univer
sities across the country by
adopting a comprehensive Code
of Conduct that would show Stan
ford truly values all who con
tribute to this community.

Police do good job but should
spend less time chasing bikers
I've been reading with some am
bivalence the debate regarding the
role of the Stanford Department of
Public Safety in enforcing traffic
laws on campus. As a member of
the public emergency services sys
tem, 1 have friends who are law en
forcement officers, but at the same
time I am also a Stanford student
who would like to be able to get to
class and back without having to
worry about getting a ticket. So
here are my two cents.
First, in response to Noah
Veltman's description in yester
day's issue of deputies' disregard
for traffic laws, I would like to ex
plain to him that many times, a
law enforcement official is going
somewhere in a sort of "half
emergency" state. What this
means is that it's not worth the
risk involved in driving with lights
and sirens (which often forces in
experienced or stupid drivers to
crash into one another . . . yield
to the right if you ever see an
emergency vehicle behind you,
not left, and certainly don't slam
your brakes right in front of the
driver.) Rather, the officer is en
route to a call which requires him
to get there fast. When things
haven't gotten too hairy yet, but
might very soon, this involves

providing backup to a partner.
If Veltman ever witnesses an of
ficer run a stop sign in order to get
back to the station earlier, I encour
age him to file a citizen's complaint.
Believe me, they care about those.
But be careful before judging, be
cause the job as not as simple as
many people would like to believe,
and keeping up public impressions
is very hard.
Now my issue with the sheriff's
office: Enforcing bike laws should
be part of their job; sometimes,
however, it feels like it is too much
a part of their jobs. I realize that on
a college campus, there aren't a
whole lot of meth dealers to bust
or crime scenes to investigate and
that it may seem to many deputies
that bicycle citations are the only
thing to do.
So I would like to remind the
Stanford police that in order to
serve the community, they need
to maintain an image of service.
Excessive enforcement of bicycle
laws destroys this image, replac
ing it with one of harassment. Do
what you have to do, but don't be
mean about it. I hope that the
deputies try to remember that
they did not become cops only to
give out bike tickets. Hopefully
this realization will curb bike
ticket writing to a more reason
able level.

I am also confused as to why this

that I have done. For instance, I
have served as expert witness in
many discrimination cases, almost
always representing workers
claiming discrimination. Or you
might have selected a monograph I
wrote for the Russell Sage Foun

make the case for worker owner
ship and worker control of deci
sion-making within firms. Is this
also "problematic?"
Finally, this mischaracterization

Stanford needs ta adopt a
workers' Code of Conduct
I'm writing to elaborate on a
statement made in Wednesday's
Article, "Labor Committee's Effi
cacy Questioned" (May 5). The ar
ticle states that "no low-wage
worker —which [SLAC] defines
as someone who earns less than the
recommended living wage — actu
ally sits on the committee." 1 find it
ridiculous that a committee was
created in order to examine work
ing conditions of low-wage work
ers, only to exclude people from
that population on the committee.
Who better to speak to the prob
lems and areas being examined by
the committee than workers them
selves? It would undoubtedly be
thought absurd if a committee was
created in order to examine faculty
life on campus, but then no faculty
were on the committee.
I think the lack of worker
voice in this process is illustrative
of Stanford's overall poor treat
ment of the workers who ensure
that life on campus runs smooth
ly. I would love to see Stanford
set a positive example for univer
sities across the country by
adopting a comprehensive Code
of Conduct that would show Stan
ford truly values all who con
tribute to this community.

Police do good job but should
spend less time chasing bikers
I've been reading with some am
bivalence the debate regarding the
role of the Stanford Department of
Public Safety in enforcing traffic
laws on campus. As a member of
the public emergency services sys
tem, 1 have friends who are law en
forcement officers, but at the same
time I am also a Stanford student
who would like to be able to get to
class and back without having to
worry about getting a ticket. So
here are my two cents.
First, in response to Noah
Veltman's description in yester
day's issue of deputies' disregard
for traffic laws, I would like to ex
plain to him that many times, a
law enforcement official is going
somewhere in a sort of "half
emergency" state. What this
means is that it's not worth the
risk involved in driving with lights
and sirens (which often forces in
experienced or stupid drivers to
crash into one another . . . yield
to the right if you ever see an
emergency vehicle behind you,
not left, and certainly don't slam
your brakes right in front of the
driver.) Rather, the officer is en
route to a call which requires him
to get there fast. When things
haven't gotten too hairy yet, but
might very soon, this involves

providing backup to a partner.
If Veltman ever witnesses an of
ficer run a stop sign in order to get
back to the station earlier, I encour
age him to file a citizen's complaint.
Believe me, they care about those.
But be careful before judging, be
cause the job as not as simple as
many people would like to believe,
and keeping up public impressions
is very hard.
Now my issue with the sheriff's
office: Enforcing bike laws should
be part of their job; sometimes,
however, it feels like it is too much
a part of their jobs. I realize that on
a college campus, there aren't a
whole lot of meth dealers to bust
or crime scenes to investigate and
that it may seem to many deputies
that bicycle citations are the only
thing to do.
So I would like to remind the
Stanford police that in order to
serve the community, they need
to maintain an image of service.
Excessive enforcement of bicycle
laws destroys this image, replac
ing it with one of harassment. Do
what you have to do, but don't be
mean about it. I hope that the
deputies try to remember that
they did not become cops only to
give out bike tickets. Hopefully
this realization will curb bike
ticket writing to a more reason
able level.

Protester explains sign that
expressed shame at being Jewish
Signs carried at demonstra
tions are at best a limited means
of communication, so I would like
to explain why I carried the sign
John Felstiner objected to in his
letter of May 4 ("Open letter to
an anti-Zionist protester"). The
occasion was "Israel Pride Day."
Because Israel's actions fill me
with shame rather than pride, my
sign said, "I am ashamed, and I
am a Jew."
I am ashamed that a state that
purports to represent Jews every
where is undermining the precepts
and values that for thousands of
years have been traditional to the
Jewish people: justice, tolerance
and compassion. I am ashamed of a
Jewish state that has robbed anoth
er people of their land and water,
destroys their homes and imprisons
them behind walls. I am ashamed of
a state that allows young soldiers to
humiliate and torment people at

checkpoints, carries out assassina
tions with helicopter missiles that
kill innocent people and sends F-16
jets to bomb crowded apartment
houses. And I am ashamed of a
country where a rabbi can face three
years in jail for protesting the demo
lition of a home.
Prof. Felstiner writes of an Is
raeli friend's "hard-earned right
to say she's ashamed and an
gered." and suggests others don't
have that right. But as an Ameri
can whose government supports
and subsidizes Israel's actions,
and as a Jew who deplores the
crimes being committed in the
name of the Jewish people, I have
not only the right, but the obliga
tion to protest.
RACHELLE MARSHALL
Stanford, Calif.
Professor responds to criticisms
of his involvement in Chile
I was disappointed with your ar
ticle titled "Labor committee's ef

ficacy questioned" (May 5). At this
time, it would be inappropriate for
me to write on behalf of the com
mittee, so let me restrict myself to
the article's uncomplimentary
comments that were directed to
me personally.
Your article thoroughly misrep
resents my role. You state that I
served "as chief advisor to Chile's
Labor Minister under the dictator
Augusto Pinochet". Permit me to
give you more precise information.
Pinochet had made collective bar
gaining illegal; my task was to help
restore collective bargaining. I visit
ed Santiago for just under a month
in the spring of 1979 and my advice
to the minister of labor was limited
to those weeks, nothing before and
nothing after.
When I arrived, no collective
bargaining involving labor unions
was permitted and unions were re
pressed. Within a week or so of my
departure, collective bargaining in
volving labor unions was legal. My
role was to provide the minister of
labor with information about collec

tive bargaining and unionism in
other countries and to advise about
how best to structure the collective
bargaining system. The principal
goal was to reestablish collective
bargaining in Chile.
1 advised a system that gave
unions a considerable amount of
freedom to organize and bargain
with firms. Not all my advice was
accepted, but a large measure of it
was. I regard it as a success that,
after democracy was restored in
Chile, the system I advocated re
mains largely intact. In other
words, successive democratic gov
ernments in Chile have chosen to
retain the system I helped to de
sign. It is a system that has helped
make Chile the best economic per
former in Latin America with a
growth in real incomes for workers
that other Latin American work
ers would envy.
I have never kept my role for
those few weeks in Chile a secret.
Far from it, I am pleased to have had
a significant hand in designing a sys
tem that has proved durable, that

has served workers' interests and
that has been advocated as a model
for other countries. My visit to Chile
appears on mv curriculum vitae and
I have been invited to write articles
based on the experience. If you
want to read what I advised, you
may consult an article I wrote for a
1997 Brookings Institution volume:
"The Legal Framework for Collec
tive Bargaining in Developing
Countries," in Labor Markets in
Latin America: Combining Social
Protection with Market Flexibility.
I should add that 1 have offered the
very same advice to democratic gov
ernments such as South Korea and,
recently. Indonesia.
I am also confused as to why this
single brief experience involving
Chile 25 years ago selected to char
acterize me. There is much else

Excessive enforcement of bicycle

Protester explains sign that
expressed shame at being Jewish
Signs carried at demonstra
tions are at best a limited means
of communication, so I would like
to explain why I carried the sign
John Felstiner objected to in his
letter of May 4 ("Open letter to
an anti-Zionist protester"). The
occasion was "Israel Pride Day."
Because Israel's actions fill me
with shame rather than pride, my
sign said, "I am ashamed, and I
am a Jew."
I am ashamed that a state that
purports to represent Jews every
where is undermining the precepts
and values that for thousands of
years have been traditional to the
Jewish people: justice, tolerance
and compassion. I am ashamed of a
Jewish state that has robbed anoth
er people of their land and water,
destroys their homes and imprisons
them behind walls. I am ashamed of
a state that allows young soldiers to
humiliate and torment people at

checkpoints, carries out assassina
tions with helicopter missiles that
kill innocent people and sends F-16
jets to bomb crowded apartment
houses. And I am ashamed of a
country where a rabbi can face three
years in jail for protesting the demo
lition of a home.
Prof. Felstiner writes of an Is
raeli friend's "hard-earned right
to say she's ashamed and an
gered." and suggests others don't
have that right. But as an Ameri
can whose government supports
and subsidizes Israel's actions,
and as a Jew who deplores the
crimes being committed in the
name of the Jewish people, I have
not only the right, but the obliga
tion to protest.

Professor responds to criticisms
of his involvement in Chile
I was disappointed with your ar
ticle titled "Labor committee's ef

ficacy questioned" (May 5). At this
time, it would be inappropriate for
me to write on behalf of the com
mittee, so let me restrict myself to
the article's uncomplimentary
comments that were directed to
me personally.
Your article thoroughly misrep
resents my role. You state that I
served "as chief advisor to Chile's
Labor Minister under the dictator
Augusto Pinochet". Permit me to
give you more precise information.
Pinochet had made collective bar
gaining illegal; my task was to help
restore collective bargaining. I visit
ed Santiago for just under a month
in the spring of 1979 and my advice
to the minister of labor was limited
to those weeks, nothing before and
nothing after.
When I arrived, no collective
bargaining involving labor unions
was permitted and unions were re
pressed. Within a week or so of my
departure, collective bargaining in
volving labor unions was legal. My
role was to provide the minister of
labor with information about collec

tive bargaining and unionism in
other countries and to advise about
how best to structure the collective
bargaining system. The principal
goal was to reestablish collective
bargaining in Chile.
1 advised a system that gave
unions a considerable amount of
freedom to organize and bargain
with firms. Not all my advice was
accepted, but a large measure of it
was. I regard it as a success that,
after democracy was restored in
Chile, the system I advocated re
mains largely intact. In other
words, successive democratic gov
ernments in Chile have chosen to
retain the system I helped to de
sign. It is a system that has helped
make Chile the best economic per
former in Latin America with a
growth in real incomes for workers
that other Latin American work
ers would envy.
I have never kept my role for
those few weeks in Chile a secret.
Far from it, I am pleased to have had
a significant hand in designing a sys
tem that has proved durable, that

has served workers' interests and
that has been advocated as a model
for other countries. My visit to Chile
appears on mv curriculum vitae and
I have been invited to write articles
based on the experience. If you
want to read what I advised, you
may consult an article I wrote for a
1997 Brookings Institution volume:
"The Legal Framework for Collec
tive Bargaining in Developing
Countries," in Labor Markets in
Latin America: Combining Social
Protection with Market Flexibility.
I should add that 1 have offered the
very same advice to democratic gov
ernments such as South Korea and,
recently. Indonesia.
I am also confused as to why this
single brief experience involving
Chile 25 years ago selected to char
acterize me. There is much else
that I have done. For instance, I
have served as expert witness in
many discrimination cases, almost
always representing workers
claiming discrimination. Or you
might have selected a monograph I
wrote for the Russell Sage Foun

dation three years ago. In this, I
make the case for worker owner
ship and worker control of deci
sion-making within firms. Is this
also "problematic?"
Finally, this mischaracterization
would not have arisen if your re
porter had troubled to contact me
about these interpretations of my
role in Chile. Before publishing
their articles, professional re
porters usually give an individual
an opportunity to respond to the
unflattering depictions of him
drawn by others.

Stanford needs ta adopt a
workers' Code of Conduct
I'm writing to elaborate on a
statement made in Wednesday's
Article, "Labor Committee's Effi
cacy Questioned" (May 5). The ar
ticle states that "no low-wage
worker —which [SLAC] defines
as someone who earns less than the
recommended living wage — actu
ally sits on the committee." 1 find it
ridiculous that a committee was
created in order to examine work
ing conditions of low-wage work
ers, only to exclude people from
that population on the committee.
Who better to speak to the prob
lems and areas being examined by
the committee than workers them
selves? It would undoubtedly be
thought absurd if a committee was
created in order to examine faculty
life on campus, but then no faculty
were on the committee.
I think the lack of worker
voice in this process is illustrative
of Stanford's overall poor treat
ment of the workers who ensure
that life on campus runs smooth
ly. I would love to see Stanford
set a positive example for univer
sities across the country by
adopting a comprehensive Code
of Conduct that would show Stan
ford truly values all who con
tribute to this community.

Police do good job but should
spend less time chasing bikers
I've been reading with some am
bivalence the debate regarding the
role of the Stanford Department of
Public Safety in enforcing traffic
laws on campus. As a member of
the public emergency services sys
tem, 1 have friends who are law en
forcement officers, but at the same
time I am also a Stanford student
who would like to be able to get to
class and back without having to
worry about getting a ticket. So
here are my two cents.
First, in response to Noah
Veltman's description in yester
day's issue of deputies' disregard
for traffic laws, I would like to ex
plain to him that many times, a
law enforcement official is going
somewhere in a sort of "half
emergency" state. What this
means is that it's not worth the
risk involved in driving with lights
and sirens (which often forces in
experienced or stupid drivers to
crash into one another . . . yield
to the right if you ever see an
emergency vehicle behind you,
not left, and certainly don't slam
your brakes right in front of the
driver.) Rather, the officer is en
route to a call which requires him
to get there fast. When things
haven't gotten too hairy yet, but
might very soon, this involves

providing backup to a partner.
If Veltman ever witnesses an of
ficer run a stop sign in order to get
back to the station earlier, I encour
age him to file a citizen's complaint.
Believe me, they care about those.
But be careful before judging, be
cause the job as not as simple as
many people would like to believe,
and keeping up public impressions
is very hard.
Now my issue with the sheriff's
office: Enforcing bike laws should
be part of their job; sometimes,
however, it feels like it is too much
a part of their jobs. I realize that on
a college campus, there aren't a
whole lot of meth dealers to bust
or crime scenes to investigate and
that it may seem to many deputies
that bicycle citations are the only
thing to do.
So I would like to remind the
Stanford police that in order to
serve the community, they need
to maintain an image of service.
Excessive enforcement of bicycle
laws destroys this image, replac
ing it with one of harassment. Do
what you have to do, but don't be
mean about it. I hope that the
deputies try to remember that
they did not become cops only to
give out bike tickets. Hopefully
this realization will curb bike
ticket writing to a more reason
able level.
