Protester explains sign that
expressed shame at being Jewish
Signs carried at demonstra
tions are at best a limited means
of communication, so I would like
to explain why I carried the sign
John Felstiner objected to in his
letter of May 4 ("Open letter to
an anti-Zionist protester"). The
occasion was "Israel Pride Day."
Because Israel's actions fill me
with shame rather than pride, my
sign said, "I am ashamed, and I
am a Jew."
I am ashamed that a state that
purports to represent Jews every
where is undermining the precepts
and values that for thousands of
years have been traditional to the
Jewish people: justice, tolerance
and compassion. I am ashamed of a
Jewish state that has robbed anoth
er people of their land and water,
destroys their homes and imprisons
them behind walls. I am ashamed of
a state that allows young soldiers to
humiliate and torment people at

checkpoints, carries out assassina
tions with helicopter missiles that
kill innocent people and sends F-16
jets to bomb crowded apartment
houses. And I am ashamed of a
country where a rabbi can face three
years in jail for protesting the demo
lition of a home.
Prof. Felstiner writes of an Is
raeli friend's "hard-earned right
to say she's ashamed and an
gered." and suggests others don't
have that right. But as an Ameri
can whose government supports
and subsidizes Israel's actions,
and as a Jew who deplores the
crimes being committed in the
name of the Jewish people, I have
not only the right, but the obliga
tion to protest.

Professor responds to criticisms
of his involvement in Chile
I was disappointed with your ar
ticle titled "Labor committee's ef

ficacy questioned" (May 5). At this
time, it would be inappropriate for
me to write on behalf of the com
mittee, so let me restrict myself to
the article's uncomplimentary
comments that were directed to
me personally.
Your article thoroughly misrep
resents my role. You state that I
served "as chief advisor to Chile's
Labor Minister under the dictator
Augusto Pinochet". Permit me to
give you more precise information.
Pinochet had made collective bar
gaining illegal; my task was to help
restore collective bargaining. I visit
ed Santiago for just under a month
in the spring of 1979 and my advice
to the minister of labor was limited
to those weeks, nothing before and
nothing after.
When I arrived, no collective
bargaining involving labor unions
was permitted and unions were re
pressed. Within a week or so of my
departure, collective bargaining in
volving labor unions was legal. My
role was to provide the minister of
labor with information about collec

tive bargaining and unionism in
other countries and to advise about
how best to structure the collective
bargaining system. The principal
goal was to reestablish collective
bargaining in Chile.
1 advised a system that gave
unions a considerable amount of
freedom to organize and bargain
with firms. Not all my advice was
accepted, but a large measure of it
was. I regard it as a success that,
after democracy was restored in
Chile, the system I advocated re
mains largely intact. In other
words, successive democratic gov
ernments in Chile have chosen to
retain the system I helped to de
sign. It is a system that has helped
make Chile the best economic per
former in Latin America with a
growth in real incomes for workers
that other Latin American work
ers would envy.
I have never kept my role for
those few weeks in Chile a secret.
Far from it, I am pleased to have had
a significant hand in designing a sys
tem that has proved durable, that

has served workers' interests and
that has been advocated as a model
for other countries. My visit to Chile
appears on mv curriculum vitae and
I have been invited to write articles
based on the experience. If you
want to read what I advised, you
may consult an article I wrote for a
1997 Brookings Institution volume:
"The Legal Framework for Collec
tive Bargaining in Developing
Countries," in Labor Markets in
Latin America: Combining Social
Protection with Market Flexibility.
I should add that 1 have offered the
very same advice to democratic gov
ernments such as South Korea and,
recently. Indonesia.
I am also confused as to why this
single brief experience involving
Chile 25 years ago selected to char
acterize me. There is much else
that I have done. For instance, I
have served as expert witness in
many discrimination cases, almost
always representing workers
claiming discrimination. Or you
might have selected a monograph I
wrote for the Russell Sage Foun

dation three years ago. In this, I
make the case for worker owner
ship and worker control of deci
sion-making within firms. Is this
also "problematic?"
Finally, this mischaracterization
would not have arisen if your re
porter had troubled to contact me
about these interpretations of my
role in Chile. Before publishing
their articles, professional re
porters usually give an individual
an opportunity to respond to the
unflattering depictions of him
drawn by others.
