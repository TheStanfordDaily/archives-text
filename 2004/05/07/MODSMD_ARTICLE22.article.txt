## The
						constant hush-hush on college hazing 
### 
I was shocked when I saw the "torture
photos" taken at Abu Ghraib prison
outside of Baghdad. Naive, I know, but I
didn't expect that "our soldiers" would
do that. Not because 1 buy into the ideology
that the U.S. is "good" and everyone else is
"evil." but because I had faith that the infras
tructure of military operations over in Iraq
would be accountable.
Silly me. My biggest surprise, however, is
that the information ever became public.
Sexual humiliation has a long history at
U.S. universities in the form of hazing. Prison
torture does not equate to university-level
hazing, but they are not without similarities.
Sexual humiliation has been the most high
profile type of athletic and Greek hazing in
recent years. This is a delicate transition, but
work with me.
First, the obvious differences. Greek

pledges and new team
members are joining a
group on their own accord
— they're not in prison —
and when they cross over to
normal member status,
they are empowered to do
the same shit to the next
generation. Also, sports
and Greek hazing is inter
nal: The hazed and the haz-

ers are in the same organiza
tion and not from separate, warring countries.
And most university-level hazers are not stupid
enough not to take incriminating photos.
Second, not all hazing is created equal. We
hear about the worst cases, like at Mepham
High School in Long Island, where a few guys
on the football team were sodomized with
broomsticks and golf balls in 2003. Or the
University of Vermont's hockey team, which
had its new members do an "elephant walk"
connected by each other's genitals, which re
sulted (among other things) in its season
being cut short and the university paying one
hazed player $80,000 in a court settlement.
These kinds of incidents are few and far be
tween. but 1 have to wonder how many inci
dents never go public.
What about Stanford? Stanford is the
land of petty hazing and confidentiality. A
study by Alfred University and the NCAA
estimated that 80 percent of college ath
letes are hazed, and I am not surprised,
since hazing includes getting wasted. This is
the kind of hazing that goes on at Stanford
and most of it stays under the radar. My
friend freshman year joined a club sport
and they had her drink beer out of a shoe.
Only she doesn't drink alcohol, so they
gave her some soda. She had fun, they had
fun, what's the big deal?
Too bad it's not all beer and funny fluo
rescent costumes. While the Office of Stu
dent Affairs is investigating incidents of
champagne and strawberries in hot tubs,
they've missed a big thing or two in the last
few years. I know, because all of us students
know things the administration doesn't find
out about.
The OSA doesn't go out looking for in
formation, but rather processes the infor
mation that comes to them. This is part of
why most hazing stays under the radar —
most of us don't tell on each other. Inciden
tally, athletic hazing is not handled by the
OSA, since sports teams are not registered
student organizations, although the set-up
is under review. So who the hell knows what
happens with athletes.
Most of us on campus are in the dark about
what the administration does discover. The
OSA's policy is to keep problems private and
confidential, except in cases where the student
organization goes to the press first. So for the
large part, they don't know what we know and
we don't know what they know.
Aside from petty hazing (who cares), the
more troubling stuff I have heard about in
the last four years includes group vomiting,
being forced to refrain from your extracur
ricular commitments, social probation (that
means you can't talk to anyone), relocation
from your housing, physical beatings and,
okay, rumors of forced nudity and anal pen
etration. But none of this stuff is public
knowledge at Stanford. We don't tell on our
friends and the administration doesn't tell
on our friends. It remains precisely at the
level of hearsay.
Most seniors don't even know that a
member of our class was hazed to the point
of hospitalization our freshman year. His
fraternity was severely reprimanded, his
pledge class doesn't like him. he never
made it in the fraternity anyway and the
people who do know about it wonder how
the hell you found out.
Is anyone noticing a trend? This is the
same campus where I still feel safe walking
around alone late at night because we never
hear about the sexual assaults and rapes that
do go on. It's like a bubble within a bubble.
But how can we ask for more disclosure
without also expecting crackdowns on the
hazing we don't want them to know about,
or that no one cares to see punished?

Should hazing infractions he public information ?
Who should disclose them? E-mail Julie, a senior,
your thoughts at julieoUMstanford.edu.
