# Card to battle No. 21 Huskies
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford baseball team has a chance to all
but wrap up the conference title in its biggest series
in the Northwest in years. But it won't be easy.
Starting today, the top-ranked. Pacific-10 Con
ference-leading Cardinal plays a three-game series
at second-place No. 21 Washington. Stanford has a
11/2 game lead in the Pac-10 standings, so a Car
dinal sweep would all but end the Huskies' title
hopes with only six games remaining on their con
ference schedule.
"This is probably an ideal scenario," senior clos
er David O'Hagan said. "A sweep would really seal
the league off."
But Stanford (35-6. 10-2 Pac-10) has never swept
a three-game series in Seattle and is only 3-5 in the
Emerald City since 1998.
Seattle has been especially cruel to Stanford
sports in recent years —just ask the football and
men's basketball teams — so there's even more mo
tivation for the 2004 Cardinal baseball squad.
Washington (26-14-1, 10-5) might be the only
team in the conference that can actually match
Stanford bat-for-bat. All you have to do is look to
last Saturday's game in Corvallis, in which the
Huskies entered the ninth trailing 14-13 and scored
a whopping 13 runs in the frame to blow the game
wide open.
"They're a very physical team," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "It was an unusual in
ning, but that's something they're capable of."
Added O'Hagan: "It was pretty impressive.
Hopefully we won't stumble upon something
like that."
Leading the way offensively for the Huskies is
sophomore outfielder Zack Clem, who is fourth in
the conference in batting average (.387). home-runs
(10) and slugging percentage (.662) and third in on
base percentage (.500).
Junior first baseman Kyle Larsen had six RBIs in
the crazy win against Oregon State and is hitting .362
with nine home runs, in addition to ranking 10th in
the conference with 38 RBIs.

Washington also has strong team speed. The
Huskies are second in the conference in stolen
bases, led by senior second baseman Greg Isaac
son (14 steals) and sophomore outfielder Brent
Lillibridge (13).
Washington's pitching staff, however, has strug
gled. Its staff is second-to-last in the conference in
ERA (5.49) and starts two freshmen and a sopho
more in its rotation.
One of those freshmen, Tim Lincecum, howev
er, has been one of the most dependable starters
in the conference. The 5-foot-l 1 righthander was
Washington state high school baseball player of
the year in 2003, and he's showed why in his first
collegiate campaign.
Lincecum is 5-1 with a 3.74 ERA, ranks seventh
in the conference in innings pitched (742 / 3), and —
here's the rub — the freshman is first in the confer
ence and second in the nation in strikeouts with 112.
In fact, Lincecum is only 19 strikeouts away from
tying the Washington single-season record set by
Jeff Heaverlo in 1999.
Though Lincecum is clearly Washington's best
starter, he won't pitch until Sunday. Lincecum start
ed a midweek game against Oregon State three
weeks ago, and Washington head coach Ken Knut
son has not had an off day with which to reshuffle his
rotation. The move also gives the Huskies a good
chance to win the series if they happen to split the
first two games.
Husky closer Will Fenton has been something of
a disappointment this season. After a 2003 campaign
in which he was named a third-team Ail-American
and led the Pac-10 in saves with 12 — without giving
up a single run — in 32 and 1 / 3 innings, Fenton has
struggled mightily by his standards.
While he is third in the conference with six saves
and is tied for fourth with six wins, Fenton has a 5.47
ERA and has issued 21 walks in 24 and 2 / 3 innings
of work.
Meanwhile, the Stanford pitching staff has a
plan for facing such a potent lineup. According to
O'Hagan, teams from the Northwest generally

take a lot of batting practice in the
fall, and thus they're expert fast
ball hitters.

"Hopefully, we'll be able to ex
pose them with breaking balls,"
O'Hagan said.
Also, Marquess still has not
named a Sunday starter. For him,
it's not a matter of someone hav
ing establish himself, but a matter
of matchups.

"Sure, it's in flux, but I've got
a lot of options I can go to," he
said. "I probably won't announce
the starter until after Saturday's
game, because if they're swing
ing better against Gilniore and
not so well against Romanczuk,
I'd throw |Blake] Holler. Or, if
it's vice-versa. I might go with
[Greg] Reynolds. I could go a lot
of ways."

ed a midweek game against Oregon State three
weeks ago, and Washington head coach Ken Knut
son has not had an off day with which to reshuffle his
rotation. The move also gives the Huskies a good
chance to win the series if they happen to split the
first two games.
Husky closer Will Fenton has been something of
a disappointment this season. After a 2003 campaign
in which he was named a third-team Ail-American
and led the Pac-10 in saves with 12 — without giving
up a single run — in 32 and 1 / 3 innings, Fenton has
struggled mightily by his standards.
While he is third in the conference with six saves
and is tied for fourth with six wins, Fenton has a 5.47
ERA and has issued 21 walks in 24 and 2 / 3 innings
of work.
Meanwhile, the Stanford pitching staff has a
plan for facing such a potent lineup. According to
O'Hagan, teams from the Northwest generally

take a lot of batting practice in the
fall, and thus they're expert fast
ball hitters.

"Hopefully, we'll be able to ex
pose them with breaking balls,"
O'Hagan said.
Also, Marquess still has not
named a Sunday starter. For him,
it's not a matter of someone hav
ing establish himself, but a matter
of matchups.

"Sure, it's in flux, but I've got
a lot of options I can go to," he
said. "I probably won't announce
the starter until after Saturday's
game, because if they're swing
ing better against Gilniore and
not so well against Romanczuk,
I'd throw |Blake] Holler. Or, if
it's vice-versa. I might go with
[Greg] Reynolds. I could go a lot
of ways."
The first pitch of the series is
set for 6:30 p.m. tonight at Husky
Ballpark. The games tomorrow
and Sunday are both scheduled
for 1:00 p.m.
The Stanford baseball team has a chance to all
but wrap up the conference title in its biggest series
in the Northwest in years. But it won't be easy.
Starting today, the top-ranked. Pacific-10 Con
ference-leading Cardinal plays a three-game series
at second-place No. 21 Washington. Stanford has a
11/2 game lead in the Pac-10 standings, so a Car
dinal sweep would all but end the Huskies' title
hopes with only six games remaining on their con
ference schedule.
"This is probably an ideal scenario," senior clos
er David O'Hagan said. "A sweep would really seal
the league off."
But Stanford (35-6. 10-2 Pac-10) has never swept
a three-game series in Seattle and is only 3-5 in the
Emerald City since 1998.
Seattle has been especially cruel to Stanford
sports in recent years —just ask the football and
men's basketball teams — so there's even more mo
tivation for the 2004 Cardinal baseball squad.
Washington (26-14-1, 10-5) might be the only
team in the conference that can actually match
Stanford bat-for-bat. All you have to do is look to
last Saturday's game in Corvallis, in which the
Huskies entered the ninth trailing 14-13 and scored
a whopping 13 runs in the frame to blow the game
wide open.
"They're a very physical team," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "It was an unusual in
ning, but that's something they're capable of."
Added O'Hagan: "It was pretty impressive.
Hopefully we won't stumble upon something
like that."
Leading the way offensively for the Huskies is
sophomore outfielder Zack Clem, who is fourth in
the conference in batting average (.387). home-runs
(10) and slugging percentage (.662) and third in on
base percentage (.500).
Junior first baseman Kyle Larsen had six RBIs in
the crazy win against Oregon State and is hitting .362
with nine home runs, in addition to ranking 10th in
the conference with 38 RBIs.

Washington also has strong team speed. The
Huskies are second in the conference in stolen
bases, led by senior second baseman Greg Isaac
son (14 steals) and sophomore outfielder Brent
Lillibridge (13).
Washington's pitching staff, however, has strug
gled. Its staff is second-to-last in the conference in
ERA (5.49) and starts two freshmen and a sopho
more in its rotation.
One of those freshmen, Tim Lincecum, howev
er, has been one of the most dependable starters
in the conference. The 5-foot-l 1 righthander was
Washington state high school baseball player of
the year in 2003, and he's showed why in his first
collegiate campaign.
Lincecum is 5-1 with a 3.74 ERA, ranks seventh
in the conference in innings pitched (742 / 3), and —
here's the rub — the freshman is first in the confer
ence and second in the nation in strikeouts with 112.
In fact, Lincecum is only 19 strikeouts away from
tying the Washington single-season record set by
Jeff Heaverlo in 1999.
Though Lincecum is clearly Washington's best
starter, he won't pitch until Sunday. Lincecum start
ed a midweek game against Oregon State three
weeks ago, and Washington head coach Ken Knut
son has not had an off day with which to reshuffle his
rotation. The move also gives the Huskies a good
