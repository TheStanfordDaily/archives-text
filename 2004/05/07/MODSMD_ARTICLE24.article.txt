# Softball takes on Washington, UCLA
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 6 Cardinal Softball team (40-13, 10-5 Pacific
-10 Conference) returns from two wildly successful week
ends on the road to face a crucial homestand this week
end against two of the best teams in the country.
When the Cardinal squares off against No. 8 Wash
ington (34-12, 8-5) tonight and No. 3 UCLA (34-7, 7-6)
tomorrow and Sunday, it will do so after having won
seven of its last eight conference games for the first time
in school history.
There is a buzz about this year's Cardinal squad that
first started building two weeks ago, after Stanford went
3-0 on the road against Washington and UCLA.
Last weekend's win over top-ranked Arizona in Tuc
son brought the excitement surrounding Stanford soft
ball to a fevered pitch. Though no one on the team dares
to mention it, the Cardinal is looking at completing its
best season in the history of the softball program and has
an outside chance at a conference title.
It would be understandable if the softball team got
caught up in its recent high-profile victories and the up
coming NCAA Regionals. But, thanks to head coach
John Rittman, the team members remain focused on
only one thing â€” winning right now.
"We've got to take things one game at a time,"
Rittman said. "You know, I think everyone on our
team knows that the Arizona victory [is] in the past.
We can't think about that right now. Right now, our
sole focus is on the present. We're thinking about
Washington (tonight]."
Rittman and the Cardinal have a difficult task ahead
of them against the Huskies and the Bruins this weekend.
Washington, which lost two close games to the Cardi
nal in Seattle two weeks ago, will come into Stanford
looking for revenge. The Huskies have traditionally
dominated the Cardinal and hold a 24-11 edge in the all
time series between the two schools, so both teams will
be confident going into Friday's game. For the Huskies,
winning against Stanford would mean avoiding a season
sweep at the hands of the Cardinal and retaining a chance
at finishing second in the Pac-10.
The Bruins, too, should be especially dangerous this

weekend as their vaunted lineup and pitching staff are
just starting to come around after a surprisingly slow
start to their conference season. UCLA has won five
games in a row. including two against No. 5 California,
since the Bruins' narrow 1-0 loss to the Cardinal two
weekends ago.
In addition. Stanford will face UCLA twice this week
end. Only Arizona has been able to defeat the Bruins on
consecutive days this season.
History also favors the Bruins, as the all-time se
ries between Stanford and UCLA stands overwhelm
ingly in favor of the latter, with the Bruins holding a
27-7 advantage.
This weekend's homestand marks the Cardinal's
final regular season home games of the year, which
could prove helpful for Stanford as it faces such diffi
cult competition.
"The road has been good to us so far, but it's still
nice to be back home to play," Rittman said. "There's
a lot less stress on the academic side [playing at home]
and we have Senior Day on Sunday, so this should be
good for us."
The Cardinal will look to its ace pitcher, Dana
Sorensen, to contain the potent Bruins and Huskies as
effectively as she did earlier this season in victories
over both team. Sorensen was outstanding in a two-hit
victory over Arizona last weekend and was subse
quently voted Pac-10 Pitcher of the Week for the sec
ond time this season after notching two victories
against the Arizona schools. "Lightning D" is regard
ed as a big-game pitcher, and this weekend's games
definitely fit that description.
The Cardinal hitters have been remarkably able in the
last two weekends to come up with what Rittman calls
the "timely hit," scoring just enough for their team to eke
out victories. Last weekend's 7-6 victory over Arizona
State and 2-1 victory over Arizona are perfect examples
of the Cardinal's uncanny ability to generate just enough
run production to win in big games.
Overall, this weekend will be a challenge for the Car
dinal. but not one that the team cannot overcome.
"Every game is a battle," Rittman said. "We just
have to go out and execute our game plan, to do what
we do best."
