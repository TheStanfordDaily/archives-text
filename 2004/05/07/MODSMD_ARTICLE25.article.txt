# Throwers, jumpers, sprinters prep for Pac-10s
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Stanford is mentioned in the track and field
community, the first thing that enters everyone's mind is
"distance powerhouse."
And with two NCAA cross-country team titles, three
individual track titles and over 40 Ail-American honors
earned over the last three years, the reaction is justified.
But while the distance squad can provide a solid core
for the track team, Stanford cannot hope to claim its third
Pacific-10 Conference title in the last four years without
the help of its sprinters, jumpers and throwers.
"The distance squad is the core of the team." said
men's head coach Robert Weir. "The other events are the
arms and legs that carry that body to victory. Without the
other events, we cannot be competitive in the Pac-1 0 or at
the national level."
While Stanford lost some of its biggest stars in these
"other" events after last year, a strong contingent of
young athletes has moved up to take their place.
In the discus, junior Will O'Neill has improved upon

his personal best hy nearly 10 feet and is ranked seventh
in the Pac-10, within striking distance of third place.
"Pac-lOs have been the focus of my entire season."
O'Neill said. "I've been training for this since last sum
mer. I hope to throw 175 feet at Pac-lOs, give or take,
which should have me around third or fourth."
Joining O'Neill in the throws is senior Jay Goff, who
entered Stanford as a decathlete but has focused on
javelin after suffering a foot injury that has kept him from
running for the last two years.
"I'm definitely ready for Pac-lOs," Goff said. "My foot
was hurting right before Big Meet, so I was only expect
ing around 204 feet, but ended up throwing a personal
best (217 feet, 10 inches).
"My chances at Pac-lOs are really good." Goff con
tinued. "I'm definitely within reach of a first or second
place finish."
And with the focus primarily on the distance squad,
both O'Neill and Goff feel little pressure or expectation
going into the conference meet.
"It takes all the pressure off me," O'Neill said. "Ev
eryone expects the distance team to score so many points

and win events. So, there is little expectation on me, and
if and when I score points, it is just an added bonus."
On top of scoring points for the Cardinal, both ath
letes will also be able to scope out some of the top com
petition that they will face at the Regional meet two
weeks later, when they will attempt to qualify for the
NCAA Championships.
"My goal is to reach nationals," Goff said. "I will get to
see some of the top guys in the region at Pac-lOs. Last
year, it took 225 feet to make the Regional finals, and it
should be that good again.
For the jumps, sophomore Solomon Welch has quick
ly established himself as one of the best jumpers in Stan
ford history.
The reigning U.S. Junior Champion in the triple jump
will look to make an impact at Pac-lOs after suffering a
groin injury earlier in the season.
"I'm looking at [a] top-three [finish]," Welch said.
"I'm just trying to come back from injury. It's been get
ting better each week."
