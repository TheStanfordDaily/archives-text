# Throwers, jumpers, sprinters prep for Pac-10s
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Stanford is mentioned in the track and field
community, the first thing that enters everyone's mind is
"distance powerhouse."
And with two NCAA cross-country team titles, three
individual track titles and over 40 Ail-American honors
earned over the last three years, the reaction is justified.
But while the distance squad can provide a solid core
for the track team, Stanford cannot hope to claim its third
Pacific-10 Conference title in the last four years without
the help of its sprinters, jumpers and throwers.
"The distance squad is the core of the team." said
men's head coach Robert Weir. "The other events are the
arms and legs that carry that body to victory. Without the
other events, we cannot be competitive in the Pac-1 0 or at
the national level."
While Stanford lost some of its biggest stars in these
"other" events after last year, a strong contingent of
young athletes has moved up to take their place.
In the discus, junior Will O'Neill has improved upon

his personal best hy nearly 10 feet and is ranked seventh
in the Pac-10, within striking distance of third place.
"Pac-lOs have been the focus of my entire season."
O'Neill said. "I've been training for this since last sum
mer. I hope to throw 175 feet at Pac-lOs, give or take,
which should have me around third or fourth."
Joining O'Neill in the throws is senior Jay Goff, who
entered Stanford as a decathlete but has focused on
javelin after suffering a foot injury that has kept him from
running for the last two years.
"I'm definitely ready for Pac-lOs," Goff said. "My foot
was hurting right before Big Meet, so I was only expect
ing around 204 feet, but ended up throwing a personal
best (217 feet, 10 inches).
"My chances at Pac-lOs are really good." Goff con
tinued. "I'm definitely within reach of a first or second
place finish."
And with the focus primarily on the distance squad,
both O'Neill and Goff feel little pressure or expectation
going into the conference meet.
"It takes all the pressure off me," O'Neill said. "Ev
eryone expects the distance team to score so many points

and win events. So, there is little expectation on me, and
if and when I score points, it is just an added bonus."
On top of scoring points for the Cardinal, both ath
letes will also be able to scope out some of the top com
petition that they will face at the Regional meet two
weeks later, when they will attempt to qualify for the
NCAA Championships.
"My goal is to reach nationals," Goff said. "I will get to
see some of the top guys in the region at Pac-lOs. Last
year, it took 225 feet to make the Regional finals, and it
should be that good again.
For the jumps, sophomore Solomon Welch has quick
ly established himself as one of the best jumpers in Stan
ford history.
The reigning U.S. Junior Champion in the triple jump
will look to make an impact at Pac-lOs after suffering a
groin injury earlier in the season.
"I'm looking at [a] top-three [finish]," Welch said.
"I'm just trying to come back from injury. It's been get
ting better each week."
Welch, like his teammates, is not sole
ly focused on Pac-lOs, but is looking to
make a postseason appearance as well.
"I'm definitely looking to qualify for
nationals," Welch said. "My goal for the
year is about 16 meters, about 52-5."
"The Pac-10 is one of the top confer
ences in the triple jump," Welch contin
ued. "The top three or four at conference
should be in the top six at Regionals, so
I'm definitely right there."
For all individual events, the top five
finishers in each region along with the
six or seven best marks in the nation
not qualified through a region will go to
nationals.
The sprint squad is led this year by
former a football player turned track
star, junior Nick Sebes, a double
champion in the 200 and 400 at the Big
Meet, and one of the top 400 runners
in the conference.
"I'm really excited to get out there at
Pac-lOs," Sebes said. "I haven't really
had the opportunity to run against top
competition. It will be good to be in a
race with some people who have run 45s
for 400."
While Sebes's personal best is only
46.74. he placed third at Mt. San Anto
nio in poor track conditions against ex
tremely tough 400-meter competition
and won the Big Meet, where he set his
personal best, by nearly a second.
"I feel I'm on the verge of a big one,"
Sebes continued. "I'm finishing
stronger than ever. Training for track
has been much easier without having to
worry about spring football. Also, the

focus that used to be on football is on
the track."
These four athletes, along with sever
al of the "other" athletes on the team,
could help push the Cardinal back to the
top of the Pac-10 this year. With football
players like junior Stanley Wilson help
ing out in the 100- and 400-meter relays
and with 400 specialist junior Curt
Goehring set to run a solid split in the
1,600-meter relay, the "other" athletes
might make all the difference in Arizona
next weekend.
"I feel we have a very good shot at a
team title," Welch said. "If everything
goes as planned, we should do well."
Added Goff: "A lot depends on how
we show up that day. But we have a
team that rises to the occasion, and be
cause of that, we always have a great
shot at winning."
This weekend, as a final tune-up, sev
eral athletes will travel to Modesto to
throw, jump or sprint as the Cardinal
tries to qualify a few more athletes.
Senior Jillian Camarena highlights
the women's shot put field, while ju
nior Jessica Pluth and sophomore
Sarah Hopping of Stanford's incredi
ble hammer group will seek the elusive
200-foot barrier against a star-studded
field.
Junior Evan Fox will attempt to hit
the Pac-10 and Regional qualifying mark
in the 800, while the men's 400-relay
team hopes to post a Regional qualifying
mark as well.
Sophomore Ahimsa Hodari and ju
nior Nick Taylor will compete at the
Pac-10 heptathlon and decathlon, re
spectively, to open what should be con
ference title runs for both the women's
and men's squads.
