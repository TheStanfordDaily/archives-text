# 2004 baseball season proves to be the year of'Hallywood'

### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
An indelible image adorns the cover of every pro
gum sold at Sunken Diamond this season — a collection
of arms and legs, clenched fists and a player who has lit
erally gone head-over-heels as part of the pileup that en
sued after Stanford advanced to the College World Se
ries for a fifth consecutive time last June.
Front and center is wide-smiling Brian Hall, mid-leap,
light aim extended and making the No. I sign, staring
straight at the camera.
Nearly one year later, with the Cardinal in the midst
of another journey it hopes — and believes — will cul
minate in Omaha, Hall is front and center, with reason to
smile, once again.
1 he senior right fielder was named the Louisville
Slugger National Player of the Week after batting .688
with a double, two home runs, 10 RBIs, seven runs
scored and a 1.125 slugging percentage last week, as
Stanford reclaimed the top spot in the national rankings.
A career .284 hitter entering this season, Hall is current
ly batting .395 with a career-high nine home runs and 46
RBIs to go along with 10 stolen bases.
It was Wee Willie Keeler who once said, "1 keep my
eves clear and I hit 'em where they ain't"' when someone
asked the diminutive Baltimore Orioles shortstop how
he managed to hit .432 in 1897.
As part ol his career week. Hall hit 'em where they
weren t 10 out of 11 times in Stanford's three-game
sweep of Washington State, an astounding .909 series
average to up his clip in 12 Pac-1() games to an unreal
.638 (30-for-47).
"Everything was kind of taking place in slow motion,"
Hall said. "Everything just slows down and it seems like
every pitch is over the good part of the plate. You just get
a confidence at the plate, and it's fun to hit when you're
going like that."
The slowed pace that the Carlsbad. N.M., native de
scribes at the plate is in stark contrast to the rapid ascent
of his batting average after a tepid start.
"When I was hitting .200, I was definitely pressing a
lot," said Hall, who has hit safely in 26 of his last 27
games. "The biggest difference for me has been help

from my teammates and my coaches and adjusting my
swing. I became more relaxed at the plate and concen
trated on getting in a better hitting position."
Despite hitting over .500 each of his last three seasons
at Carlsbad High School, where he led the Cavemen to
two state championships and hit a school-record .647 as
a senior. Hall has improved his overall hitting approach
while at Stanford.
"In high school, I was a dead pull hitter and I didn't
know how to hit the ball to the right of the shortstop,"
Hall said. "1 definitely learned how to use the whole field
and have become a more complete hitter."
That was evidenced in last Saturday's game when
Hall singled up the middle in his first at-bat, singled
through the left side of the infield in the fifth inning,
lashed another single to left in the sixth and found the
hole between first and second in the eighth.
Remarkably, the consistency with which Hall has
swung the bat over the past month has coincided with his
not always knowing where he will be playing in the field.
With Jonny Ash still nursing an injured finger back to
health. Hall started at third base two weeks ago against
Sacramento State and made some fine defensive plays at
first base while giving John Mayberry Jr. a couple of days
off last weekend.
"I definitely like to settle into one position, and right
field is the most comfortable for me," Hall said. "But first
and foremost, 1 want to be in the lineup anywhere. What
ever I need to do to do that and help out the team, I'm
willing to do."
Playing different positions is nothing new to Hall,
who split his 63 starts last season between third base
(23 times), left field (23) and first base (17), while bat
ting .293.
Where Hall plays in the field has no bearing on the
head- and leg-tapping routine he engages in before step
ping into the batter's box, a quirk evocative of Nomar
Garciaparra, the professional baseball player he most
enjoys watching.
"I don't know why I tap the head, but I used to tap the
leg to try to remind myself to stay back and not get out
on my front side," Hall said. "I don't even realize I'm
doing it."
There's no doubt that Hall tapped away before his

walk-off grand slam to beat Kansas earlier this season, a
memory that ranks right up there with hitting a home run
in his first College World Series game as a freshman.
While the 22-year old Hall would like to pursue a ca
reer in professional baseball, right now he is excited
about the prospects of his final weeks on the Farm.
"I think this is the best team I've played on since
I've been here, and we've taken home two second
places and a third place [at the College World Series],

so that speaks volumes about this team." Hall said. "I
think we're just barely starting to come together and
play the way we can. That'll be scary for other teams if
we can put it all together."
Scary indeed, and potentially the makings of an even
more picture-perfect pileup in Omaha to punctuate a
stellar Stanford career.
"It would be amazing to get back there and actually
win it," Hall said.
