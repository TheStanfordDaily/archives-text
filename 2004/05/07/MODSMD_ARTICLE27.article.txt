# Experience makes Lappin deadly at the plate in sophomore campaign
## 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After earning All-Pacific-10 Conference honors and traveling with the
U.S. national team during her first year at Stanford, it was not all that un
reasonable to wonder how much more Lauren Lappin could hope to ac
complish the second time around.
Any doubts that may have been lingering, though, have all been
cleared away by now.
The sophomore shortstop from Anaheim, Calif., has had a stellar sec
ond season at the Farm, avoiding the dreaded "sophomore slump" and
leading the Cardinal to a top-10 national ranking.
"1 didn't really think about it too much," Lappin said of the possibili
ty of a second-year jinx. "1 just wanted to build on last year, and 1 knew
we had a great team coming in."
Lappin flourished last year as a freshman, leading the team with a
.339 batting average and 58 hits. The shortstop also posted a .401 on
base percentage and .417 slugging percentage, earning second team
AU-Pac-10 honors.
Despite her sparkling numbers from last season, Lappin has improved
in every major statistical category this year. Last year, Lappin hit two
home runs with 31 runs scored and 16 RBIs. With two weeks remaining
in this season, Lappin has already matched or topped last year's totals
with two home runs, 34 runs scored, and 38 RBIs.
Lappin credits experience as the leading factor behind this sea
son's improvement.
In addition to having one year of collegiate play under her belt,
Lappin also spent the fall playing with the national team. At 19, Lap
pin was the youngest player selected to join the 18-woman roster. She
and former Stanford teammate Jessica Mendoza helped lead the team
to the Japan Cup title.
Lappin, selected as an alternate from the field of 18 for the Olympic
games, will be traveling with the national team as it heads to Athens this
summer to compete in the Olympics.

Excited as she is about the Olympics, Lappin's focus is on the current
season, as Stanford plans to make a run for the College World Series. The
No. 7 Cardinal (40-13, 10-5 Pac-10) is in second place in the stacked Pac
-10 conference behind top-ranked Arizona. The Pac-10 boasts seven
teams in the top 25 with five of those teams holding top-10 rankings.
"The last place team can beat the first place team on any given day,"
Lappin said. "We'll need a little help from other teams to pass Arizona
since we don't play them any more this season, but as long as we stick to
our plan, we should have a shot to win [the Pac-10 title]."
The Cardinal's quest for a national championship ended in the
regional tournament last year in Alabama when they dropped two
games on the second day of the tournament. With the Cardinal
hosting the regional tournament this year, the team will have
home-field advantage.
"Hosting the regional tournament can be an advantage if we let it be,"
Lappin said. "Being in our own stadium and having our own fans will add
a comfort level that's unattainable if we were to travel."
Regardless of how the team finishes, Lappin feels that this year's
squad already has much of which to be proud. She cites the Cardinal's
win over the Wildcats last weekend as being one of the team's top ac
complishments thus far.
"Its really tough to play in Arizona," Lappin said. "They always have
sellout crowds and the fans really heckle the players. That was a great
performance for us."
Lappin was named National Player of the Week in mid-April for
her performance against UCLA and Washington. Lappin led the Car
dinal that weekend by going 5-for-10 with three RBIs, including one
that proved to be the game winner against the Bruins. It was the first
time ever that the Cardinal defeated both UCLA and Washington in
the same weekend.
But even with all the awards and accolades, Lappin still wants that for
which all athletes ultimately compete: a national title.
"We have a great shot," she said. "We just need to continue to work
hard and progress the rest of the season."
