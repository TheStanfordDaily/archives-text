# SLAC Scientists discover maximum speed for hard drive storage slower than expected
## 
### LISE MARKEN 
Scientists at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) have demonstrated the limits of
computer storage speed in an experiment far-re
moved from normal computer hard drives. The
experiment used the linear accelerator to simulate
computer storage with beams of electrons fired at
magnetic recording material.
In a discovery with implications for future
computer storage capacity, Stanford researchers
found that the highest speed at which magnets can
reliably be made to switch poles is about 1 .(XX)
times slower than theorized. Since magnetic-pole
switching is fundamental to how computers
record information, their findings will impact the
development of computer hard-drive technology.
Researchers at the Stanford Synchrotron Ra
diation Laboratory (SSRL) simulated the process
of switching magnetic poles that occurs in a com
puter's hard drive. The accelerator produced a
beam of electrons that was used to act like a hard
drive's writing head, while magnetic detectors
simulated the hard drive.
In a computer, the writing head contains an
electric current that creates a series of magnetic
impulses. These impulses arrange the poles of mi

croscopic magnets on a disk's surface in one of
two directions, producing the binary code that
computers use to store information.
Because the linear accelerator is able to pro
duce extremely short magnetic impulses of only
two picoseconds — in other words, two trillionths
of a second — researchers were able to explore
the limits of magnetic pole switching. The experi
ment showed that the behavior of the magnets on
the recording surface becomes random — and
therefore useless for recording purposes — at
speeds up to 1,000 times slower than the re
searchers expected.
The speeds reached in the linear accelerator
are well beyond current computer technology, so
little has been discovered about the upper limit of
computer data recording until now.
"People have done a lot of research on the size
limits of computing technology but less on the
speed limits because they can't be reached tech
nologically," said Deputy Director of the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory Joachim
Stohr. "We used a two-mile long [linear accelera
tor! to reach these speeds. No one has a clue how
to get up to these speeds inside a computer, so it
hasn't been studied as much. The physical limit
that this experiment discovered may be hard to

reach technologically."
Stohr explained that there is an important differ
ence between processing speed and storage speed.
"Text editing, for example, happens in the
memory of the computer," he said. "It's saved
electronically on a silicon chip, not magnetically.
When you want to save a document, on the other
hand, you say 'save' and the computer writes it to
the hard drive magnetically. Our experiment had
to do with data storage speed."
Though this experiment doesn't have direct
implications for the limits of computer speeds, it
does have consequences for the understanding of
data recording in general and could lead to other
technological innovations. Heat-assisted record
ing, where a portion of the recording material is
heated to increase the speed at which its magnets
can switch poles, is one example of future tech
nology the research might lead to.
According to Stohr, this experiment was a highly
unusual and innovative use of the linear accelerator.
"The linear accelerator is built for high energy
physics," he said. "It's not typically used for study
ing the materials used in technology today. This
was a unique way to use a tool of high energy
physics for an experiment that addresses techno
logical questions."
