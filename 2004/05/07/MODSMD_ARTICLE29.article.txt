Three yoga pictures on the Features page yesterday should have been
credited to Angela Nava.
A picture that ran on Wednesday was incorrectly labeled. The
photo is not of the "Mind, Body and Soul of Palestine" exhibit. In
stead, it shows the exhibit of the history of the LGBT-CRC on the
second floor of Tresidder. The Palestinian exhibit is behind the
other exhibit.
