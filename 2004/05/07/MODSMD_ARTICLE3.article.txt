# Iris Chang addresses genocide and oppression in China and America
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Chinese-American historian Iris Chang em
phasized the connection between remembering
genocide and preventing it at a lecture last night
to a packed audience in the History Corner.
Recalling her work on the bestselling book
"Rape of Nanking," she described looking over
photos of the 1937 massacre and being "haunt
ed" by the idea that it might be forgotten.
Chang recounted her experience researching
and writing about the war crimes committed in
China. Her grandparents fled from the Nanking
as the violence was beginning, and Chang called
the Nanking massacre "part of my childhood."
At the time she began her research, the events
were unacknowledged in Japan and little-known
to the rest of the world.
Still, today, many aspects of her book are con
troversial, and she is challenged by conspiracy
theorists in Japan who deny Japanese massacres
in China.
Chang recounted how one of the book's de
tractors "suggests that I am a secret agent for the
People's Republic of China ... I've always want
ed to know: what was a secret agent doing in
Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, for the first 20
years of her life?"
For her research, Chang recounted combing
through books, interviewing survivors and
searching government archives for information
about what happened. She ultimately amassed

thousands of pages of raw material in
several languages.
In her book, Chang placed the death
toll in the Nanking massacre at 300,000,
a number greater than the civilian ca
sualty count of World War II in Eng
land, France and Belgium combined,
she said.
"I bring up these crimes to remind
us of the potential for evil that lives in
us all," Chang said. "The Pacific War
was not some tragic flaw but an indi
cation of a universal condition of
human nature."
Chang also described her new
book, "The Chinese in America,"
which traces the history of Chinese
communities in the United States up to
the present day.
"All of my books are linked to China
in some way," she said. "But more sig
nificantly, they are all studies in power.
My books illuminate the struggle of
people against oppressive power."
Chang went on to speak about the
tendency of countries to move to
wards dictatorship in times of eco
nomic crisis. Dictatorships then turn
minority groups into scapegoats for
the country's problems, setting the
stage for genocide.
