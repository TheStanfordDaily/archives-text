# Colorado faculty get resolution on athletic department reform
## 
### ADAM EWING COLORADO DAILY 
(U-WIRE) BOULDER, Colo. (May 6) — The
University of Colorado-Boulder faculty had the
chance today to send a clear message to administrators
and the athletic department that they want athletics
reform — now.
The Boulder Faculty Assembly's Special Commit
tee on Athletics Reform will present its draft report to
the faculty governance organization outlining what it
sees as the future of athletics on campus and the role
academics should play.
CU anthropology and ethnic studies Professor De
ward Walker said it is time for change.
"I think faculty are pretty unified in requesting
changes and reform in the athletic program to include
more direct oversight by faculty and administration,"
Walker said.
He said CU is almost sure to act on the recommendations.
"Given the amount of public pressure right now. it
would be unwise for the university not to take the sug
gested reforms seriously," Walker added.
Several faculty members presented a draft report to
the faculty's executive committee Monday during a

meeting closed to reporters. The Colorado Daily ob
tained a copy of the report following the meeting.
"We cannot simply wait for system-wide rules
changes to trickle down from the Big 12 or NCAA be
fore the university reasserts its authority over the ath
letic program," said the report, which was compiled by
a committee chaired by CU political science professor
Scott Adler.
"We at UCB have no choice; we must lead or be
judged a failure in the eyes of the entire nation," the re
port said.
Adler did not return calls from the Colorado Daily
this week.
The report recommended a number of changes in
the draft form the Daily obtained. It is unknown
what changes might have been made in the draft by
faculty since Monday, but the initial recommenda
tions included:
Faculty taking a more active role in student-athlete
recruitment;
Restricting the number of athletic scholarships, and
post-season play for those who have poor academic
performance;
Consolidating responsibility for CU-Boulder inter
collegiate athletics into the Office of the Chancellor;

Requiring the CU athletics director report to the
provost and executive vice chancellor;
Requiring student-athletes to meet the same admis
sions standards as other students
The BFA draft report says "financial pressures," the
lure of national exposure and extraordinary booster
support "eroded the once-clear standing of academics
as the fundamental purpose of the university..."
Several steps need to be taken to halt the athletics
"arms race," the report said.
CU should reconsider athletic scholarships — by
considering a reduction of the number available or
moving to a more need-based system of financial aid
for athletes.
The report also said "coaches' salaries have spiraled
out of control."
It said paying coaches more than $1 million (CU
head football coach Gary Barnett makes $1.6 mil
lion annually, including deferred compensation)
per year sends the message that athletic victories
are valued well beyond academic achievement. The
university, it said, needs to assess how such com
pensation packages fit in with the institution's pri
orities and goals.
Pauline Hale, CU-Boulder spokeswoman, said ad

ministrators would take seriously the recommenda
tions made by the BFA.
"We don't want to pre-empt the faculty who will
be considering this draft proposal this week," Hale
said. "We won't have a detailed comment at this
time other than to say we appreciate all of the hard
work and careful deliberation that's gone into this
draft proposal. These recommendations will be con
sidered among others received as a result of the var
ious investigations."
Dave Plati, athletic department spokesman, said
Tharp has met with the report's authors and has been
in conversation with them all along.
He added that it would be premature to comment on
the recommendations because Tharp continues to
work with the committee members.
The proposed recommendations send a clear mes
sage from faculty that it is time for academics to take a
priority over athletics.
"Unfortunately, intercollegiate athletics has come
to operate almost independently of the academic en
terprise," the report said. "This is an intolerable situa
tion. Athletics must be restored to its role as a compo
nent of, and not separate from, the academic mission of
the university."
