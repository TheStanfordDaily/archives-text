# Who said Asians can't drive?
## Intermission editor Tom Vo braves the 1-5 in pursuit of Coachella glory 
### TAM VO INTERMISSION EDITOR, COACHELLA SURVIVOR 
The odds were stacked against me. Not only
did I have to drive the 500-plus miles from
Stanford down to the middle-of-nowhere
(Indio, Calif.) for Coachella, I would have to
do it alone, in a slightly dinged-up Nissan
Quest minivan that had seen better days. Add
the handicaps of being 1) small, 2) Asian and
3) female, and most people would say that Bar
rett Sheridan might be the only current Inter
mission editor to survive Coachella. After
failed attempts to cajole and blackmail friends
into carpooling, I resigned myself to a solo
road trip (without a CD player or any good
music and an unreliable air conditioning sys
tem). A lot of smelly cows were waiting for me
on the Interstate 5 freeway — I had to get
going. The Pixies would wait for no one.
So I missed most of Coachella, never arriv
ing before 6:30 p.m. on both Saturday and Sun
day. At least I beat the heat. I had a lot of time
to reflect on the past 19 years of my life on the
road. Kerouac would be proud. I hauled ass
down and up the 101, the 152, the 210 and the
10. Twelve-hundred-plus miles covered in four
days. Some lessons learned on the road may
serve to entertain and/or educate you:
1) DO bring craploads of open kitchen food
hoarded for such an occasion. Of course, our
house manager kept buying the same stuff
from Costco over and over and over again
until residents hounded him to go to Safeway,
so this meant I had a healthy assortment of
Gushers fruit snacks, Rice Krispies treats,
Ritz crackers and gumrni worms for nourish
ment. Don't buy the $5 bag of Flaming Hot
Cheetos from that roadside gas station, they
expired in 2002.
2) DON'T be an asshole to other drivers. If
someone is kissing your rear bumper like the
I-Hum kid to your TF last year, yield so that
they can hound the car in front of you. That
way you don't look like an impatient jerk, and
you'll get the luxury of someone else doing the
work (i.e. clearing the lane in front of you be
cause they are a speed demon) while you drive
relaxed. I learned that you should also be pa
tient and stay in the left most lane most of the
times, because you'll run into a truck as soon
as you signal right. Also, staying in your lane is
a good way to piss off other cars who DO
change lanes to the right (in a two-lane situa
tion) and have to slow down after two seconds
of going 90 mph because of the big rig travel
ing at tortoise speed in front of it. They'll be
forced to switch lanes back to yours, BEHIND
you, and you get to chuckle at their wasted en
ergy. Also, never drive through Compton any
time after the sun goes down.
3) DO bring toys (I'm not suggesting anything
kinky here, that's Roxy Sass's domain) to
amuse yourself because you will inevitably run
into that thing called LA Traffic — Rubix
cubes for you analytical types, Playdoh and
Etch-a-Sketch for nostalgia, hell, maybe even
a textbook or two to catch up on reading. Who
am I kidding, I'm on provisional registration. I
spent my time not moving by drumming on the
wheel with Vic Firth 2B sticks, which prompt
ed many drivers to glance over, one of which
screamed, "Play tight!" to which I screamed
back, "I'm lefthanded!" When you want to
punch someone's lights out, the best coping
method is drumming out instead.
4) DON'T drive sleepy, because Dr. Dement
will hunt you down and you will be a poster
child for What's Wrong with Overworked and
Sleep-Deprived College Students Every
where. I suppose Red Bull, caffeine pills or
speed are an option for some, but I prefer to
pull over into well-lit areas and nap. Remem
ber drivers ed and how you should crack the
window for some cold air to keep you alert.
Apparently "Ride of the Valkryies" is the

most dangerous song to drive to, because it in
duces higher blood pressure, but maybe it will
keep your drowsiness at bay.
5) DO observe all the landmarks and scenic as
pects of the areas you're driving through.
Mmm ... 1 heard Gilroy is now importing gar
lic harvested by little Chinese kids these days,
cuts down on costs. Over 200 miles of brown,
brown brown await you on the 1-5. On the 10?
Those windmills near Indio aren't really for al
ternative sources of power, they're a modern
tribute to Don Quixote. A huge brontosaurus
and T-Rex guard a gas station in Palm Springs.
Feeling lucky? Casino Morongo, 40 miles
south of Claremont / Pomona, is the closest
you'll get to Vegas, for at least several hundred
miles. Are you a shopping addict? Then don't
stop at the massive designer outlets next to the
casino. Of course, if you're going down the 5.
STOP AT CASA DE FRUTA for me, please
(Casa De Wine, Casa De Choo Choo Train,
Casa De Sweets and Casa De RV Park are just
a few more incentives).
6) DO peoplewatch. Make up stories about all
the freaks and crazy people you see speeding
down the freeway. When at a standstill in traf
fic, make eye contact with attractive looking
drivers and quickly glance away when they no
tice you've been staring at them for over a
minute. Wipe the drool off your face. I chal
lenged a guy in a flimsy rice rocket to race on
the 5. The soccer mom minivan won.
Voyeurism has its dangers, however, a notable
one of them being witness to that thing we call
ROADHEAD. I counted four cases of road
head while on my trip, two of which caused ex
tremely reckless driving on the receiver's end.
If you're going to engage in this act while at
high speeds, could you please not put others
lives in danger? Pull the fuck over, your girl
friend is going to get bruises on her neck from
your erratic shifting of the gears. Roadhead is
a serious public safety issue, people.
7) DON T talk on your cell phone. I don't care
how skilled a multitasker you might be — you
can't pay full attention to what's going on the
road when you're having phone sex or begging
your roomie to sign you up for the Draw. Peo
ple on their cell phones swerve within lanes
and appear to be 1) drunk, 2) retarded and 3)
like they're just got their learners' permit and
can't drive a straight line. Even my grandma
drives better, and she has no arms!
8) DO start talking to yourself, because you
shouldn't be on your phone for more than a
few minutes at a time, if ever. Think out loud.
I know you do it in your room when your
roomie isn't there. Sing along to the voices in
your head, or radio, if there is even anything
decent to listen to (not when you get in the
range of Fresno) that isn't Tejano I Mariachi
polka, booty rap / R&B, endless commercials
or Radio Disney. Practice asking that cute
guy/girl from your PoliSci lecture out, stutter
ing isn't all that attractive. Besides, with the
windows rolled up, people won't know you're
going completely insane.
9-10) DO drive really fast because solo road
trips really suck, and you want it to end as
quickly as humanly possible (i.e. without
causing a massive wreck involving a tiny
clown car, the Heineken beer truck and the

T ropicana
swimsuit model
bus). Oh, and
watch out for
the other guy
because you
were the negli
gent bicyclist
who almost ran
me and my
longboard over
in the Intersec
tion of Death
last week. Jerk.

clown car, the Heineken beer truck and the

T ropicana
swimsuit model
bus). Oh, and
watch out for
the other guy
because you
were the negli
gent bicyclist
who almost ran
me and my
longboard over
in the Intersec
tion of Death
last week. Jerk.

The odds were stacked against me. Not only
did I have to drive the 500-plus miles from
Stanford down to the middle-of-nowhere
(Indio, Calif.) for Coachella, I would have to
do it alone, in a slightly dinged-up Nissan
Quest minivan that had seen better days. Add
the handicaps of being 1) small, 2) Asian and
3) female, and most people would say that Bar
rett Sheridan might be the only current Inter
mission editor to survive Coachella. After
failed attempts to cajole and blackmail friends
into carpooling, I resigned myself to a solo
road trip (without a CD player or any good
music and an unreliable air conditioning sys
tem). A lot of smelly cows were waiting for me
on the Interstate 5 freeway — I had to get
going. The Pixies would wait for no one.
So I missed most of Coachella, never arriv
ing before 6:30 p.m. on both Saturday and Sun
day. At least I beat the heat. I had a lot of time
to reflect on the past 19 years of my life on the
road. Kerouac would be proud. I hauled ass
down and up the 101, the 152, the 210 and the
10. Twelve-hundred-plus miles covered in four
days. Some lessons learned on the road may
serve to entertain and/or educate you:
1) DO bring craploads of open kitchen food
hoarded for such an occasion. Of course, our
house manager kept buying the same stuff
from Costco over and over and over again
until residents hounded him to go to Safeway,
so this meant I had a healthy assortment of
Gushers fruit snacks, Rice Krispies treats,
Ritz crackers and gumrni worms for nourish
ment. Don't buy the $5 bag of Flaming Hot
Cheetos from that roadside gas station, they
expired in 2002.
2) DON'T be an asshole to other drivers. If
someone is kissing your rear bumper like the
I-Hum kid to your TF last year, yield so that
they can hound the car in front of you. That
way you don't look like an impatient jerk, and
you'll get the luxury of someone else doing the
work (i.e. clearing the lane in front of you be
cause they are a speed demon) while you drive
relaxed. I learned that you should also be pa
tient and stay in the left most lane most of the
times, because you'll run into a truck as soon
as you signal right. Also, staying in your lane is
a good way to piss off other cars who DO
change lanes to the right (in a two-lane situa
tion) and have to slow down after two seconds
of going 90 mph because of the big rig travel
ing at tortoise speed in front of it. They'll be
forced to switch lanes back to yours, BEHIND
you, and you get to chuckle at their wasted en
ergy. Also, never drive through Compton any
time after the sun goes down.
3) DO bring toys (I'm not suggesting anything
kinky here, that's Roxy Sass's domain) to
amuse yourself because you will inevitably run
into that thing called LA Traffic — Rubix
cubes for you analytical types, Playdoh and
Etch-a-Sketch for nostalgia, hell, maybe even
a textbook or two to catch up on reading. Who
am I kidding, I'm on provisional registration. I
spent my time not moving by drumming on the
wheel with Vic Firth 2B sticks, which prompt
ed many drivers to glance over, one of which
screamed, "Play tight!" to which I screamed
back, "I'm lefthanded!" When you want to
punch someone's lights out, the best coping
method is drumming out instead.
4) DON'T drive sleepy, because Dr. Dement
will hunt you down and you will be a poster
child for What's Wrong with Overworked and
Sleep-Deprived College Students Every
where. I suppose Red Bull, caffeine pills or
speed are an option for some, but I prefer to
pull over into well-lit areas and nap. Remem
ber drivers ed and how you should crack the
window for some cold air to keep you alert.
Apparently "Ride of the Valkryies" is the

most dangerous song to drive to, because it in
duces higher blood pressure, but maybe it will
keep your drowsiness at bay.
5) DO observe all the landmarks and scenic as
pects of the areas you're driving through.
Mmm ... 1 heard Gilroy is now importing gar
lic harvested by little Chinese kids these days,
cuts down on costs. Over 200 miles of brown,
brown brown await you on the 1-5. On the 10?
Those windmills near Indio aren't really for al
ternative sources of power, they're a modern
tribute to Don Quixote. A huge brontosaurus
and T-Rex guard a gas station in Palm Springs.
Feeling lucky? Casino Morongo, 40 miles
south of Claremont / Pomona, is the closest
you'll get to Vegas, for at least several hundred
miles. Are you a shopping addict? Then don't
stop at the massive designer outlets next to the
casino. Of course, if you're going down the 5.
STOP AT CASA DE FRUTA for me, please
(Casa De Wine, Casa De Choo Choo Train,
Casa De Sweets and Casa De RV Park are just
a few more incentives).
6) DO peoplewatch. Make up stories about all
the freaks and crazy people you see speeding
down the freeway. When at a standstill in traf
fic, make eye contact with attractive looking
drivers and quickly glance away when they no
tice you've been staring at them for over a
minute. Wipe the drool off your face. I chal
lenged a guy in a flimsy rice rocket to race on
the 5. The soccer mom minivan won.
Voyeurism has its dangers, however, a notable
one of them being witness to that thing we call
ROADHEAD. I counted four cases of road
head while on my trip, two of which caused ex
tremely reckless driving on the receiver's end.
If you're going to engage in this act while at
high speeds, could you please not put others
lives in danger? Pull the fuck over, your girl
friend is going to get bruises on her neck from
your erratic shifting of the gears. Roadhead is
a serious public safety issue, people.
7) DON T talk on your cell phone. I don't care
how skilled a multitasker you might be — you
can't pay full attention to what's going on the
road when you're having phone sex or begging
your roomie to sign you up for the Draw. Peo
ple on their cell phones swerve within lanes
and appear to be 1) drunk, 2) retarded and 3)
like they're just got their learners' permit and
can't drive a straight line. Even my grandma
drives better, and she has no arms!
8) DO start talking to yourself, because you
shouldn't be on your phone for more than a
few minutes at a time, if ever. Think out loud.
I know you do it in your room when your
roomie isn't there. Sing along to the voices in
your head, or radio, if there is even anything
decent to listen to (not when you get in the
range of Fresno) that isn't Tejano I Mariachi
polka, booty rap / R&B, endless commercials
or Radio Disney. Practice asking that cute
guy/girl from your PoliSci lecture out, stutter
ing isn't all that attractive. Besides, with the
windows rolled up, people won't know you're
going completely insane.
9-10) DO drive really fast because solo road
trips really suck, and you want it to end as
quickly as humanly possible (i.e. without
causing a massive wreck involving a tiny
clown car, the Heineken beer truck and the

T ropicana
swimsuit model
bus). Oh, and
watch out for
the other guy
