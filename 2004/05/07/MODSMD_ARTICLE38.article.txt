# Mary Kate and Ashley are legal on June 13: almost a 'NY Minute'

Since I'm not a prepu
bescent teenybopper or a
horny middle-aged guy, I
don't naturally fit into the
Olsen twin's targeted de
mographic. Yet from

somewhere deep within me, I had an urge to see "New York
Minute." Hence, I decided to boldly represent the once-mar
ginalized horny-nineteen-year-old-repressed-teenybopper
demographic and accept an invitation to the press screening
for "New York Minute."
With an Olsen movie, all standard criteria for evaluating
cinema must go out the window. I'm not expecting Mary-
Kate and Ashley (who, I swear, is somehow hotter) to get all
Meryl Streepy on my ass, but anything, and I mean ANY
THING, other than the standard twin movie shtick would
more than "tickle my pickle." But here I am, post-screening,
my pickle still very much un-tickled. Perhaps my expecta
tions were too lofty. First of all, this movie was rated — get
this — PG for "mild sensuality" (can you say "Frenchin' ac
tion?") and, even better, "thematic elements." Once an
MP A A screener spots "thematic elements," you know some
bad shit is goin' down.
The plot goes something like this: Long Island twins Lisa

and Roxy (surprise!) couldn't be more different. A series of misunderstandings send them on an ad
venture in the Big City. Throw in a college scholarship on the line, a possible record deal at a Sim
ple Plan concert and lingering issues over the loss of their mother (the Olsen twins have it written in
their contract that their mother must always be dead) and you've got quite a train wreck.
This movie did, however, introduce me to a fun new game: Stereotype Spotting! All Chinese peo-

pie give pedicures while covertly distributing pirated media, of
course. Indian people do nothing but own convenience stores.
Black people offer pimp attire and hairdos for free at the aptly
titled "House of Bling." Even more benign stereotypes about
academics and "rockers" are ignorant to say the least.
A parade of well-known supporting actors do little to im
prove "New York Minute." The girls' obligatory clueless single
dad figure is played by Loveline's Dr. Drew Pinsky. (If Dr.
Drew is their dad, you know they get freaky — but with cau
tion.) Andy Richter delivers the most intentionally half-assed
Asian accent ever caught on film; he gave up Conan for this?
Eugene Levy comes off as creepy, and not in the endearing
way. He gave up another teen sex romp for this? Even Full
House alum Bob Saget appears for three seconds.
The horny middle-aged male group will be appeased since
the Olsen twins spend half the movie in towels, although they
stay miraculously in place despite some physical vigor. (No, not
that kind of physical vigor.) There's even a scene where Mary
Kate (or Ashley, but who really cares) spends some quality
naked time in the shower with a snake. That's right, those kinky
vixens run buck wild with that PG rating!
The most glaringly disastrous part of this movie comes in its
direction. The camera work gives a convincing portrayal of At
tention Deficit Disorder. Sad, oft-imitated action effects (i.e.
Matrix-style bullet time) don't add anything. This movie seri
ously looks like the crappy final project of a film student trying
to rip off every stylistic technique imaginable. If one word can

describe the entire effort, it would be amateur.
If the Olsen twins wanted to transcend their string of straight-to-video releases and can
celled sitcoms, they'll need to do more than French kiss guys in towels. More skin-err, plot - and
fewer gimmicks might develop their acting assets. For now, it seems that the Olsens are pleasing no
one but teenyboppers and pseudo-pedophiles.


I see 'Frisco, I see France — I can almost see Mary Kate and Ashley's un
derpants! Gasp!
