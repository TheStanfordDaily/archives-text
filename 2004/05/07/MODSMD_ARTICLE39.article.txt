### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Strolling along the outer edge of the Quad last week, I began to notice the
presence of a rather persistent pestilence that causes irregular heartbeats,
lungs short of breath, and piles of wadded up Kleenex. But it's not what you
think. My allergies were acting up, and it was all I could do to not sneeze
stringy snot all over the swimmer who was on his knees for me. We've
reached that time of year where I have to carry anti-histamines along with
my nipple clamps 24 / 7 in my bag. that delicious season called spring.
With only a few weeks until graduation, the flowers are blooming around
campus, along with some raging hard-ons. I used to be suspect of spring

quarter hook-ups: how genuine can they be, when that object of lust will be taking off for the summer,
leaving you to your own devices and vibrators? But then, as I was walking by Old Union, I noticed that

the Registrar's Office started printing time schedules reading "Mad Dash for Ass
Quarter," so I guess I stand corrected.
Has campus really turned into an endorphin-induced fuckfest? Old hook-ups
e-mailing you out of the blue, asking how things have been and, oh yeah, sorry for
not calling six months ago, maybe we'll run into each other at that Row party?
Your next door neighbor, normally only seen in a towel en route to and from the
bathroom, writing a message on your door asking if you want to go to Jack in the
Crack for a late night snack? That extra long stare that your TA gave you in lab or
section the other day, the day that you wore your particularly super skin-reveal
ing tanktop? Yes, my dear readers, spring is in the air, and along with it comes
(mathematically speaking) more hookups than campaign infractions committed
by Mikey Lee. Well, almost.
It works like this: with spring comes the end of the school year, and with the
end to anything comes a sense of hopelessness, and with this despair, all sorts of
seemingly improbable things happen. The guy down the hall that you thought
was straight is suddenly willing to reevaluate his sexuality. That girl from your
10 a.m. lecture wears a turtleneck in 85 degree weather to hide her baseball
sized hickeys. Chi Omega girls get laid. It's as if the entire campus finally decides
to take a stand and spread their legs before the arrival of summer, when all of
our wonderfully socially awkward prospects don't have the Foam party or econ
sections to help them forge a meaningful, short-term connection with some
other equally despondent partner.
I, for one, don't understand. Why are Stanford students so willing to embrace
ass in its many forms — high quality ass, embarrassing ass, drug-induced co-op ass
— at this late point in the quarter, as opposed to the other 75 percent of the school
year? As Stanford students, we were smart enough to merit admission to this cam
pus, why can't we be smart enough to distinguish between the thrill of the chase

and sheer desperation? Have we lost faith in our ability to search out physical lovin' throughout the
year, only to release that pent-up sexual frustration in wild bursts (pun fully intended) during study
breaks and sketchy Sigma Chi parties? Maybe I should simply be happy that so many of you are final
ly getting laid, but at the same time I can't help but notice a bit of hypocrisy in not having the courage
to go and seek out ass earlier on in the year, only to finally settle for springtime scraps and leftovers.
They certainly didn't explain this strategy to me during New Student Orientation years ago; if this trend
keeps up I might have to offer a "Suck and Swallow in September" tutorial in defense of prurience.
Some may claim that all that winter quarter time spent sitting in Green, chained to your books and
papers, has merited a lighter spring quarter — but let's face it, you were all stalking people on the Face
book anyway. Others of you have put the first few weeks of April to good use, lounging at Wilbur Field
basking in sunlight rather than passing Math 51, and may want to put the sexy skin to even better use.
But for the rest of us, we can shamelessly flirt with the guy that we refused to go with to Junior Formal
last year, let our fingers run wild at Exotic Erotic on May 15 and, with a little luck, indulge in last-chance
ass for an entire week before graduation brings us back down to reality.
