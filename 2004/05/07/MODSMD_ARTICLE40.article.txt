# Good Morning, Tresidder!
## Creators enjoy squirrels, Vanessa Williams, and exploding palm trees 
### MATT YAZZIE INTERMISSION HEAD CHEF 
Depressed monkeys, rampant drug use, kid
napping, gambling and a 70s slow motion fight
sequence over Girl Scout cookies? Welcome to
Good Morning Tresidder Union (GMTU) the
newest addition to the Stanford television lineup.
Think Punk'd with a touch of Totally Hidden
Video and a splash of Saturday Night Live (mid
' Bos) for good measure. GMTU is the brainchild
of juniors Mike Love and Andrew Nielsen, both
of whom probably survived equally boring sub
urban lives. Yet this makes for some fabulous, ad
dictive and sometimes sketchy content.
Judging from the happy intro song, "It's a
beautiful morning here at Tresidder Union ...
" I found myself surprised when each skit
began. The depressed monkey skit at the be
ginning of their fourth episode reminded me of
Memento with a touch of Martin Scorsese cam
era work. How can this be funny? Then the
plot thickens and you learn of the reason for
monkey depression. I continued laughing well
into the next skit.
Love admits that the fourth episode is a de
parture from the regular slapstick style in the pre
vious three. While watching an earlier episode,
only once did 1 ask myself, "Why am I watching
this?" and that was during a skit involving the re
peated spitting of orange juice on poor Love.
Admittedly, the content does improve drastically
with each new episode. The talents of Love and
Nielsen shine through and one would only imag
ine the possibilities if each were given state of the
art equipment and an unlimited budget.
However, a mini digital camcorder and Mac
video editing software will have to suffice for the
time being. Each well-planned episode with its
superb editing, great music and comedic stupidi
ty will have you actually waiting for the next one.
It's only a matter of time before its popularity
takes it to the internet. Catch it on SCBN before
that happens.
1 had the opportunity to talk to the show's cre
ators and its executive producer Matt Dyer:
INTERMISSION: Matt, as executive producer,
what made GMTU stand out for you, and why
have you guys chosen to air it?

MATT DYER: We are always looking for stu
dents to produce original programming, and
there are plenty of students who have expressed
interest. However, few students have what it
takes to produce a show. Mike Love is a rare ex
ception. He has the initiative to take charge of all
the elements of production that go into making a
student TV show. SCBN requires this type of ini
tiative from its producers. No show could be
made without it.
INT: Andrew and Mike, how did you come up
with the show's name, if it airs at night?
MIKE LOVE: Andrew came up with the
show's name. It's a spoof on Good Morning,
America because Tresidder Union is the most
happy place on campus.
ANDREW NIELSEN: That's not true. I don't
think they'll know you're sarcastic, but it is based
on GMA.
INT: How have you been involved in film before?
ML: Andrew and 1 made a documentary freshman
year about freshman life in the freshman dorms.
INT: Any other projects?
ML: Last year, I was heavily involved in this ani
mation for a weekend ...
AN: You did so many.
ML: 1 did an animation about this song 1 found on
the BBC kids' website called "Because We're
Friends." That's how 1 got the scar on my face. 1
was so busy doing the show; I passed out one day
and hit my head on a window. 1 also made a birth
day video for my brother about squirrels, I just
taped squirrels and set it to "Save the Best for
Last" by Vanessa Williams.
INT: Is that true?
AN: Yeah.
ML: Maybe.
INT: Mike, what do you and Andrew do on and
off the show?
AN: I'll answer this. I write the funny skits, Mike
writes the other funny skits. Oh, and Mike films,
edits, produces and funds the show... and di
rects it.

ML: For a while I had the idea that we would
switch off episodes and I would do the odd ones
and Andrew would do the even ones...
AN: We're still going to do that.
ML: Whatever
INT: What are your favorite skits you've done for
the show so far and why?
ML: My favorite skit is definitely "Explosions,"
because it was a concept that had been going
through my head for a long time. Palm trees look
like bombs, bombs exploding.
AN: You kind of have to watch it. My favorite
skit is Zak in the library with the Spanish tape
... my idea by the way.
ML: Well I wrote the song, so there's that.
AN: No, you didn't.
ML: 1 wrote the notes and the song is just the title.
AN: I wrote the lyrics.
ML: You didn't write the lyrics. You just said
them out loud while you were singing.
AN: That's called writing the lyrics.
INT: Do you run into controversy with your left
wing approach to Stanford life?
AN: That's a bad question, huh?
ML: Umm, the Girl Scout mom really didn't want
us to film the Girl Scouts. 1 don't know if that's
about politics though.
INT: How have people responded, and how do
you reply to all of those e-mails AND still finish
your math major?
ML: I'm not going to answer that.
AN: Let me say something.
ML: Super.
AN: We don't get e-mail because the show's just
started.
INT: How many episodes have there been?
AN: Four.
ML: One aired, we've taped six though.
INT: Why should people watch GTMU?
ML: It's GMTU, but whatever...
AN: Because Friends just got cancelled!
ML: Because how else are you going to see hot
young men on Stanford campus
AN: Mnim ...
INT: What is SCBN doing to promote the station,
and this new show?
MI): We put some new posters up in the window
a few weeks ago to spruce up the look of the sta
tion. We air a lot of good movies also. Howev
er, promoting a show is entirely up to the show's
producers. This is just another one of the student
producer's responsibilities.
INT: So Matt, how are you involved with the
show production-wise, and where do you see
your involvement headed?
MI): For the most part, Mike and Andrew have
been in full charge of this boat; they are in com
plete creative control over this show. I've stuck
my head in at a few points in the process to see
what they've been up to, and they accost me at
just about every party 1 go to on campus to ask
me about programming issues, and one time
Andrew indirectly made fun of me in his car
toon in The Daily because I was taking so much
time in getting their show on the air, but overall
they're independent and able to guide the
progress of the show on their own, and through
this process they have developed a sound
knowledge of TV production and a unique style
for their show.
INT: So Andrew and Mike, on that note, what's in
store for the rest of the quarter and next season?
ML: Oh, so much â€” Andrew, you respond. You
come up with the funny skits anyways.
AN: Ok, we are going to interview President
John Hennessey. We're going to do more stuff
around Palo Alto and play more jokes on people,
but no more on Mike.
ML: Oh yeah, I need to get my revenge for when
Andrew hogtied me.

into the next skit.
Love admits that the fourth episode is a de
parture from the regular slapstick style in the pre
vious three. While watching an earlier episode,
only once did 1 ask myself, "Why am I watching
this?" and that was during a skit involving the re
peated spitting of orange juice on poor Love.
Admittedly, the content does improve drastically
with each new episode. The talents of Love and
Nielsen shine through and one would only imag
ine the possibilities if each were given state of the
art equipment and an unlimited budget.
However, a mini digital camcorder and Mac
video editing software will have to suffice for the
time being. Each well-planned episode with its
superb editing, great music and comedic stupidi
ty will have you actually waiting for the next one.
It's only a matter of time before its popularity
takes it to the internet. Catch it on SCBN before
that happens.
1 had the opportunity to talk to the show's cre
ators and its executive producer Matt Dyer:
INTERMISSION: Matt, as executive producer,
what made GMTU stand out for you, and why
have you guys chosen to air it?

MATT DYER: We are always looking for stu
dents to produce original programming, and
there are plenty of students who have expressed
interest. However, few students have what it
takes to produce a show. Mike Love is a rare ex
ception. He has the initiative to take charge of all
the elements of production that go into making a
student TV show. SCBN requires this type of ini
tiative from its producers. No show could be
made without it.
INT: Andrew and Mike, how did you come up
with the show's name, if it airs at night?
MIKE LOVE: Andrew came up with the
show's name. It's a spoof on Good Morning,
America because Tresidder Union is the most
happy place on campus.
ANDREW NIELSEN: That's not true. I don't
think they'll know you're sarcastic, but it is based
on GMA.
INT: How have you been involved in film before?
ML: Andrew and 1 made a documentary freshman
year about freshman life in the freshman dorms.
INT: Any other projects?
ML: Last year, I was heavily involved in this ani
mation for a weekend ...
AN: You did so many.
ML: 1 did an animation about this song 1 found on
the BBC kids' website called "Because We're
Friends." That's how 1 got the scar on my face. 1
was so busy doing the show; I passed out one day
and hit my head on a window. 1 also made a birth
day video for my brother about squirrels, I just
taped squirrels and set it to "Save the Best for
Last" by Vanessa Williams.
INT: Is that true?
AN: Yeah.
ML: Maybe.
INT: Mike, what do you and Andrew do on and
off the show?
AN: I'll answer this. I write the funny skits, Mike
writes the other funny skits. Oh, and Mike films,
edits, produces and funds the show... and di
rects it.

ML: For a while I had the idea that we would
switch off episodes and I would do the odd ones
and Andrew would do the even ones...
AN: We're still going to do that.
ML: Whatever
INT: What are your favorite skits you've done for
the show so far and why?
ML: My favorite skit is definitely "Explosions,"
because it was a concept that had been going
through my head for a long time. Palm trees look
like bombs, bombs exploding.
AN: You kind of have to watch it. My favorite
skit is Zak in the library with the Spanish tape
... my idea by the way.
ML: Well I wrote the song, so there's that.
AN: No, you didn't.
ML: 1 wrote the notes and the song is just the title.
AN: I wrote the lyrics.
ML: You didn't write the lyrics. You just said
them out loud while you were singing.
AN: That's called writing the lyrics.
INT: Do you run into controversy with your left
wing approach to Stanford life?
AN: That's a bad question, huh?
ML: Umm, the Girl Scout mom really didn't want
us to film the Girl Scouts. 1 don't know if that's
about politics though.
INT: How have people responded, and how do
you reply to all of those e-mails AND still finish
your math major?
ML: I'm not going to answer that.
AN: Let me say something.
ML: Super.
AN: We don't get e-mail because the show's just
started.
INT: How many episodes have there been?
AN: Four.
ML: One aired, we've taped six though.
INT: Why should people watch GTMU?
ML: It's GMTU, but whatever...
AN: Because Friends just got cancelled!
ML: Because how else are you going to see hot
young men on Stanford campus
AN: Mnim ...
INT: What is SCBN doing to promote the station,
and this new show?
MI): We put some new posters up in the window
a few weeks ago to spruce up the look of the sta
tion. We air a lot of good movies also. Howev
er, promoting a show is entirely up to the show's
producers. This is just another one of the student
producer's responsibilities.
INT: So Matt, how are you involved with the
show production-wise, and where do you see
your involvement headed?
MI): For the most part, Mike and Andrew have
been in full charge of this boat; they are in com
plete creative control over this show. I've stuck
my head in at a few points in the process to see
what they've been up to, and they accost me at
just about every party 1 go to on campus to ask
me about programming issues, and one time
Andrew indirectly made fun of me in his car
toon in The Daily because I was taking so much
time in getting their show on the air, but overall
they're independent and able to guide the
progress of the show on their own, and through
this process they have developed a sound
knowledge of TV production and a unique style
for their show.
INT: So Andrew and Mike, on that note, what's in
store for the rest of the quarter and next season?
ML: Oh, so much â€” Andrew, you respond. You
come up with the funny skits anyways.
AN: Ok, we are going to interview President
John Hennessey. We're going to do more stuff
around Palo Alto and play more jokes on people,
but no more on Mike.
ML: Oh yeah, I need to get my revenge for when
Andrew hogtied me.

Depressed monkeys, rampant drug use, kid
napping, gambling and a 70s slow motion fight
sequence over Girl Scout cookies? Welcome to
Good Morning Tresidder Union (GMTU) the
newest addition to the Stanford television lineup.
Think Punk'd with a touch of Totally Hidden
Video and a splash of Saturday Night Live (mid
' Bos) for good measure. GMTU is the brainchild
of juniors Mike Love and Andrew Nielsen, both
of whom probably survived equally boring sub
urban lives. Yet this makes for some fabulous, ad
dictive and sometimes sketchy content.
Judging from the happy intro song, "It's a
beautiful morning here at Tresidder Union ...
" I found myself surprised when each skit
began. The depressed monkey skit at the be
ginning of their fourth episode reminded me of
Memento with a touch of Martin Scorsese cam
era work. How can this be funny? Then the
plot thickens and you learn of the reason for
monkey depression. I continued laughing well
