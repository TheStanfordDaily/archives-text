# Intermission interviews
## Ben Kweller 
### JENNIE KIM INTERMISSION SNOR 
Ben Kweller is a real good kid. It doesn't matter that he's 23, married,
and an eight-year veteran of the music business with three solo albums

under his belt — boyhood sticks to him like lint on a butterscotch
disk.

Before recording his latest CD, "On My Way," Kweller
toured with Ben Folds and Ben Lee. Appropriately, the group
called themselves "The Bens" and released an EP earlier this
year.
"On My Way," features a more thoughtful Ben, one
who is still rough around the edges, but is like, you know, aware

of it. Less faux-naif than his 2002 effort, "Sha Sha," the

album successfully strikes a balance between poise and
incorrigibility, a position best and most tenuously held
together by a skein of rakishness running through his
voice.
Kweller is currently on a nationwide tour
with Ben Gibbard's band. Death Cab For Cutie.
Ever friendly, he talked to Intermission about
Texas, his cat and Bright Eyes before his perfor

mance at the Fillmore last Monday.
That Ben Kweller — he's not a girl, not yet
a woman. He's just a real good kid.

INTERMISSION: My friend Heather worked at
Nordstrom one summer, and they already had anoth
er Heather working in her department, so they made
her change her name to Faith. I feel like you can relate,
touring with so many Bens.
BEN KWELLER: Well you know, I call him Gibbard
and he calls me Kweller. It's funny cuz one of our man
agers is named Ben too. Oh and, you know, the same
sort of thing with Ben Folds and Lee

INT: How did you and Death Cab For
Cutie get together?
BK: Well, our friend Conor from
Bright Eyes was sort of the connector
for us, and my booking agent and
Death Cab's agent are really close, so
that helped. But yeah, Conor intro
duced us first.
INT: Have you heard the new Bright
Eyes EP with Neva Dineva?
BK: Yeah, yeah, I've heard songs off it
— it's great. He's doing this folk
album next, but like, to dance music.
INT: If you could only live in one place
for the rest of your life, would you
choose Texas or New York?
BK: Man that's a fuckin' hard ques
tion. Would I be able to travel?
INT: Um, 1 guess so, but you can
only live in one place — all your
shit's there.

BK: Well, I'm tempted to move into the countryside
outside of Austin, and have a farm and raise a family.
But also, 1 have so many friends in NY. I mean, all my
friends are there... But for the rest of my life? I'd
have to say NY.
INT: Maybe you could move to Texas when you get old.
BK: Exactly. Actually, I'll probably move to Texas in
a few years to raise a family, but I'll only do that if I get
to keep an apartment in New York too.
INT: Tell us more about the city in "My Apartment,"
where "the sidewalk knows your face."
BK: It started five years ago when I moved to Brook
lyn, and 1 lived on Smith St. I'd just walk everywhere
— walk to the F-train, get to the Lower East Side. It
was great.
INT: Are you going to tour outside the U.S. soon?
BK: We're going to Europe after this tour, then we're
going to Tokyo with the White Stripes. Kyoto and
Tokyo, well — Japan in general is my favorite. It's so
culturally different, and it's just really amazing. 1 love

the culture and the art, it's awesome... And I think
we might go to Brazil for the first time, which I'm real
ly excited about.
INT: You've been touring for, what, eight years now?
Aren't you jaded yet?
BK: Naw, you get into a routine the more you do it...
I like to go fishing in my spare time, so I have different
people in different towns that take me fishing when I
come through.

The best thing about touring is, I
love when you're in a city — like L.A.
or random, like Minneapolis or some
thing — and there's another band that
you're friends with in town, and you're
both playing. It's great to play new
songs for each other when your on
your own.
INT: When you're playing a show, does
it ever weird you out to see the audi
ence all singing along to some of your
more personal lyrics? Or is it compli
mentary that your fans know your life
so well?
BK: It's flattering. I can't believe all
these people know these songs that I
wrote sitting on my bed at home, you
know? Or in my backyard hanging out
with my cat. It feels like they're so per
sonal. It's really flattering, it hits me
hard, in a good way.

INT: A lot has been said about your offbeat, unique
songwriting skills over the years. Do you think people
read too much into your lyrics sometimes?
BK: I like when people read into lyrics. It doesn't
mean that that's what the song's really about, but
it shows that people are using their imagination
and really thinking. Music is such a great way to
express yourself.
I'm a music-listener too, it's such a great outlet, a
great way to use your imagination. Cuz I love listening
to my favorite bands and wondering what they're talk
ing about too, you know? So I don't mind it at all. I
mean, most of my lyrics are sort of stream of con
sciousness anyway. Sometimes 1 don't even know
what I'm trying to say!
INT: Any new artists you'd like to recommend?
BK: There's this guy named Willy Mason, who Conor
of Bright Eyes just signed. My favorite band right now
is the Kings of Leon.
INT: Thanks for the interview.
BK: Naw, thank you! Have a good day at school!

album successfully strikes a balance between poise and
incorrigibility, a position best and most tenuously held
together by a skein of rakishness running through his
voice.
Kweller is currently on a nationwide tour
with Ben Gibbard's band. Death Cab For Cutie.
Ever friendly, he talked to Intermission about
Texas, his cat and Bright Eyes before his perfor

mance at the Fillmore last Monday.
That Ben Kweller — he's not a girl, not yet
a woman. He's just a real good kid.

INTERMISSION: My friend Heather worked at
Nordstrom one summer, and they already had anoth
er Heather working in her department, so they made
her change her name to Faith. I feel like you can relate,
touring with so many Bens.
BEN KWELLER: Well you know, I call him Gibbard
and he calls me Kweller. It's funny cuz one of our man
agers is named Ben too. Oh and, you know, the same
sort of thing with Ben Folds and Lee

INT: How did you and Death Cab For
Cutie get together?
BK: Well, our friend Conor from
Bright Eyes was sort of the connector
for us, and my booking agent and
Death Cab's agent are really close, so
that helped. But yeah, Conor intro
duced us first.
INT: Have you heard the new Bright
Eyes EP with Neva Dineva?
BK: Yeah, yeah, I've heard songs off it
— it's great. He's doing this folk
album next, but like, to dance music.
INT: If you could only live in one place
for the rest of your life, would you
choose Texas or New York?
BK: Man that's a fuckin' hard ques
tion. Would I be able to travel?
INT: Um, 1 guess so, but you can
only live in one place — all your
shit's there.

BK: Well, I'm tempted to move into the countryside
outside of Austin, and have a farm and raise a family.
But also, 1 have so many friends in NY. I mean, all my
friends are there... But for the rest of my life? I'd
have to say NY.
INT: Maybe you could move to Texas when you get old.
BK: Exactly. Actually, I'll probably move to Texas in
a few years to raise a family, but I'll only do that if I get
to keep an apartment in New York too.
INT: Tell us more about the city in "My Apartment,"
where "the sidewalk knows your face."
BK: It started five years ago when I moved to Brook
lyn, and 1 lived on Smith St. I'd just walk everywhere
— walk to the F-train, get to the Lower East Side. It
was great.
INT: Are you going to tour outside the U.S. soon?
BK: We're going to Europe after this tour, then we're
going to Tokyo with the White Stripes. Kyoto and
Tokyo, well — Japan in general is my favorite. It's so
culturally different, and it's just really amazing. 1 love

the culture and the art, it's awesome... And I think
we might go to Brazil for the first time, which I'm real
ly excited about.
INT: You've been touring for, what, eight years now?
Aren't you jaded yet?
BK: Naw, you get into a routine the more you do it...
I like to go fishing in my spare time, so I have different
people in different towns that take me fishing when I
come through.

The best thing about touring is, I
love when you're in a city — like L.A.
or random, like Minneapolis or some
thing — and there's another band that
you're friends with in town, and you're
both playing. It's great to play new
songs for each other when your on
your own.
INT: When you're playing a show, does
it ever weird you out to see the audi
ence all singing along to some of your
more personal lyrics? Or is it compli
mentary that your fans know your life
so well?
BK: It's flattering. I can't believe all
these people know these songs that I
wrote sitting on my bed at home, you
know? Or in my backyard hanging out
with my cat. It feels like they're so per
sonal. It's really flattering, it hits me
hard, in a good way.

INT: A lot has been said about your offbeat, unique
songwriting skills over the years. Do you think people
read too much into your lyrics sometimes?
BK: I like when people read into lyrics. It doesn't
mean that that's what the song's really about, but
it shows that people are using their imagination
and really thinking. Music is such a great way to
express yourself.
I'm a music-listener too, it's such a great outlet, a
great way to use your imagination. Cuz I love listening
to my favorite bands and wondering what they're talk
ing about too, you know? So I don't mind it at all. I
mean, most of my lyrics are sort of stream of con
sciousness anyway. Sometimes 1 don't even know
what I'm trying to say!
INT: Any new artists you'd like to recommend?
BK: There's this guy named Willy Mason, who Conor
of Bright Eyes just signed. My favorite band right now
is the Kings of Leon.
INT: Thanks for the interview.
BK: Naw, thank you! Have a good day at school!



Is your Husky too husky? Well? IS IT?


Whatever you kids are listening to today is just noise to me,


Ben says: Stay in school.
Ben Kweller is a real good kid. It doesn't matter that he's 23, married,
and an eight-year veteran of the music business with three solo albums

under his belt — boyhood sticks to him like lint on a butterscotch
disk.

Before recording his latest CD, "On My Way," Kweller
toured with Ben Folds and Ben Lee. Appropriately, the group
called themselves "The Bens" and released an EP earlier this
year.
"On My Way," features a more thoughtful Ben, one
who is still rough around the edges, but is like, you know, aware

of it. Less faux-naif than his 2002 effort, "Sha Sha," the

album successfully strikes a balance between poise and
incorrigibility, a position best and most tenuously held
