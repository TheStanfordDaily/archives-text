House of Nan King
919 Kearny Street
415.421.1429
Closed 4/15/04 to 5/15/04
M-F, 11 -10; Sat, 12 -10; Sun, !2 - 9.30
Throw away the menu and leave
your taste buds in the hands of the
server and chef. I have never been
disappointed in their recommenda
tions. Be aware, however, that if
they say an item is hot, they really
mean it. Make sure you let them
know when you order what your
taste preferences are. Even with my
aversion to anything with onions,
the chef at the House of Nan King
always surprises me by creating deli
cious non-describable dishes (liter
ally, I don't know what goes in them
and I don't care, so long as there are
no onions). You'll probably even
get a lesson on how to properly eat
your dish. Expect wait times for
groups of four or more.
For all you elitists out there who
feel the House of Nan King is just a
tourist trap, please go two doors down
to Chef Jia's at 925 Kearny. While
you're in the neighborhood, visit
Pearlina at 210 Columbus Avenue for
some great Peppermint Iced Tea.
Liguria

We've all seen and known that an
noying dorky kid who can do his CS
106B programming assignment like
no one's business. Yet, pretty much
that's all he can do as he is severely
lacking in any conversation and/or so
cial skills whatsoever. Nor can he
write any IHUM or policy paper
worth reading. He is only good at CS
and nothing else.
While I've just described your
worst curve nightmare, I've also de
scribed a great focaccia place, Lig
uria, near Washington Square Park
in Little Italy. I accidentally ran
across this small store while trekking
up to Coit Tower on a Saturday af
ternoon. All they serve is focaccia,
nothing more. In fact, here's their
entire menu:
Pizza Focaccia $3.25
Raisin Focaccia $3.25
Onion Focaccia $3.(X)
Plain Focaccia $3.00
Garlic Focaccia $3.25
Make sure you get a piece before
they run out, which often happens up
to one hour before closing. Once it's
gone, throw the store hours out the
window, they shut down and head
out. Grab your focaccia and hike up
to Coit tower. Or better yet walk on
over to the cool toy store, Dou
blepunch, at 180 Powell street. While
there, visit several of the awesome t

shirt and clothing stores on the same
block to round out your afternoon.
The Grove
2016 Fillmore Street (California and Pine)
415.474.1419
M - F, 7 am - 11.45 pm; Sat & Son, 8 am ■
11 pm
You probably better visit this
place soon as it has quickly be
come a popular yuppie hangout.
Order a drink and meal, grab a
chessboard, and head on over to a
table. I lost once at chess before
our meal even arrived (it wasn't a
long wait time, I just really suck at
chess). The simple wooden tables
and fireplace provide the perfect
atmosphere for relaxing. I always
order the classic Caesar salad with
roasted chicken ($8.95) and a large
iced tea. This leaves just enough
room for their awesome desserts.
The servings may not be as large as
in a regular restaurant, but for a
small cafe with a great atmos
phere, The Grove is definitely a
great stop.
Across the street at 1919 Fill
more is Hydra, one of the best soap
stores in San Francisco. With its 15
foot long by 7 foot tall tub and a col
lection of "Seven Soapy Sins" (Glut
tony is Chocolate scented), you
would be a fool to not stop by. Soaps
are sold by weight with cutting and
packaging resembling what you

would experience in a deli. If a soap
is a bit out of your price range, don't
be afraid to ask them to trim it down
and be sure to take some samples on
your way out.

Lunch: T-F, 11.30 am - 3 pm

(Call for Bakery and Wine Bar hours.)
Get the chicken pot pie. Get the
desserts. Get the chicken pot pie.
Get anything on the menu. And
don't forget to get the chicken pot
pie. Servings are great and the
food is absolutely fantastic. Reser
vations are not taken, so expect a
little wait if you arrive at peak
lunch or dinner times. Liberty
Cafe has the best vegetarian op
tions for all my non-meat eating
friends. The house blends in per
fectly with this small often unex
plored neighborhood of Bernal
Heights and provides a wonderful
cozy inviting environment to enjoy
time with your friends.
If you still feel like their desserts
haven't satisfied you enough, run
across the street to Maggie Mudd at
903 Cortland Avenue. With flavors
like Triple Chocolate Aftershock to
Cotton Candy to Jalapeno, you are
sure to find at least one flavor for your

sweet tooth. Low Fat-No Sugar, Soy
Cream, Gelato, and Sherbet varieties
also available.

Only a few blocks away from
Union Square, this small Parisian
restaurant makes any day ab
solutely perfect. The art on the
wall changes almost weekly and
the staff is always helpful and un
usually chirpy even at the latest
hour. Reservations are recom
mended for Friday and Saturday
jazz nights. Start with the Onion
Soup (6), which 1 hear is magnifi
cent (again, I avoid the onions).
For lunch, I recommend the Savo
yard (8). For dinner, the Truit
(Trout, 13) or Caille (Quail, 14)
may hit the spot. Or if you are ad
venturous, go for the Escargot
(Snails, blech, 8). For dessert, go
with the Creme Brulee (6). You
cannot go wrong at this restaurant
— 1 never had a friend complain.
Even my most picky friend,
Sheila, whom I was most afraid of
taking here because 1 thought she
would hate it, actually loved it.
Believe me; you must eat here
once before leaving Stanford.
