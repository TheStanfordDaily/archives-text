# Not exactly sex, lies and videotape: Stanford student films
## 
### ANNA NORTH INTERMISSION STAFF WRITER 
It's time to film the band scene, and director Jimmy Mosque
da wants me to play drums. Never mind that I can't keep a beat;
he just needs someone to wave the sticks around while the Gut
ter Kings belt out their rendition of the song "My House."
Except singer Tyler Gutierrez is actually lip-synching.
Chuck Woodhull's guitar isn't plugged in. And the bassist is a
guy from Yost who's never plucked a string in his life.
Welcome to the world of "Sold America," one of the films in
Stanford's Student Filmmakers Workshop (SFW). It's a world
where leading ladies are freshmen, budgets are $50 and a hip
party scene takes place in the Yost R.F.'s apartment. And for
Mosqueda, it's a world without sound. A malfunction in the
audio recording equipment means he'll have to dub his entire
film after shooting, adding audio to video in the editing room.
Mosqueda's not fazed, however. Between takes, which he
shoots himself on a Sony video camera, he offers advice like a
seasoned director. He tells the band members to "move into the
rhythms" and "ham it up a little bit." Explaining Gutierrez's
motivation, he says, "You're just totally into the music. You just
totally don't care."
Not caring isn't something Mosqueda knows a whole lot
about. He's spent countless hours already writing the script,
storyboarding and selecting the cast. And when shooting is fin
ished, he'll log even more time — probably more than 30-
hours — in the editing room. The final product: a film just 11-
minutes long.
Mosqueda describes this film as the fulfillment of a long-held
dream, a chance to "actually really do something as opposed to
thinking about it." When asked if the experience was worth the
long hours, he replied without hesitation: "Definitely."
His cast would likely agree. During the band scene shoot, a
playful atmosphere relieves what might otherwise be a monot
onous process. At one point Gutierrez and Woodhull joke
about forming a Weezer cover band, then launch into a rendi
tion of "El Scorcho."
At an earlier shoot, this one set in a car parked behind La
gunita Hall, actor Jon Lawler listed the perks of appearing in
"Sold America."
"I get to be tied up," he told me, "I get to have blood smeared
on my face, and I get guns pointed at me."
His primary job throughout these trials was to "look scared

and not laugh."
Freshman Sophia Powers, the film's star, had the opposite
job. In the car scene, she was to rock her head back and deliver
a long, contented chuckle. Mosqueda ran take after take, shoot
ing Powers now through the window, now from an awkward po
sition in the front passenger seat. He encouraged her to be
crazy, then coy — and then the battery ran out.
While Mosqueda picked up a charger, Powers told me about
her acting pedigree. Before "Sold America," she'd had a role in
a semiprofessional film called "Right of the Meridian." This

small-town dark comedy featured a scene in a frigid river that
nearly gave her hypothermia. Mosqueda's film, she said, was
"much lower pressure."
Lawler also praised the low stress of his role. Battery
mishaps notwithstanding, the mood of the shoot was friendly
and easygoing, something that's been pretty much par for the
course. Lawler recalled an earlier shoot in which "everyone got
the giggles."

Mosqueda may be partly responsible for this levity. Despite
setbacks such as late actors, he never seems to get frustrated. In
stead, he adjusts, even if it means asking a journalist to fill in for
an absent drummer.
Unwilling to compromise my journalistic impartiality, I po
litely decline. Soon, however, the real drummer shows up, fol
lowed by a crew of dancers recruited from among Mosqueda's
friends. One problem is solved, but it's not the last one Mosque
da will face. "Sold America" may be low-pressure for its actors,
but Mosqueda has some "pretty scary" times ahead.
A few weeks after the band scene shoot, I catch up with
Mosqueda in the Stanford Film Society office behind the Toyon
eating clubs. It is 9:30 on a Friday night; this is a dedicated man.
His task tonight, which will prove the hardest part of the pro
duction process, is matching audio with video.
After shooting wrapped, the actors recorded all of their
lines. Just like the visual portion of the film, the audio required
multiple takes — the actors had to speak their lines at just the
right speed, watching their mouths move on a monitor.
Now Mosqueda has to match lines to mouths exactly, using
Apple's Final Cut Pro. The same software many editors use
on feature films, Final Cut Pro has an interface like a series of
timelines stacked on top of each other. This system allows
Mosqueda to layer audio tracks and video tracks on top of one
another. The video track on the top timeline is what the view
ers see; the top audio track is what they hear. Mosqueda has
to be careful; his worst fear is that the final product will look
"cheesy, obviously dubbed."
Though the most frightening part of making "Sold Ameri
ca," editing is also Mosqueda's favorite. "You have every
thing here," he says, "You're actually putting it together."
When the process is finished, "Sold America" will have
metamorphosed from a collection of silent scenes and record
ed voices into "a kind of commentary on the college admis
sions process." Mosqueda doesn't want to reveal too much
about the film before it airs but, he promises, "it'll resonate
with every single Stanford student."
This promise won't be tested until May 20 and 21, when all
the SFW films will be screened at the Student Film Festival.
For now, however, one thing is obvious: "Sold America" res
onates deeply with Mosqueda. As the film takes shape on the
computer screen, he speaks of it with the quiet enthusiasm
I've come to expect from him.
"Wow," he says,"this is an actual movie now."
