# Streetlight Records Recommends . . .
## 
### MIKE ORME INTERMISSIONARY 
Streetlight Records in San Jose, lo
cated on 980 South Bascom, some
times gets lost in the sea of Bay Area
independent record stores due to its
relatively small size. But the store of
fers a good selection of new and used
CDs, DVDs, and vinyl, perhaps the
best selection of any store within a
half-hour drive from campus. And
they have a cool staff recommenda-

tion system in which staff members place personalized endorsement
stickers on the new albums that they really like. This week, I'll be
taking a look at three albums that I picked up solely on the strength
of these little "Recommended by..." stickers. Whose recommen
dation will come out on top?
Experimental Dental School — "Hideous Dance Attack!"
Recommended by: Moses
Based in Oakland, EDS plays a particular brand of spastic art
punk, drawing influences from surf, Latin music and, of all things,
the circus. The songs on "Hideous Dance Attack!" aren't tied down
to any particular beats, and their meanderings provide for a pretty
interesting listen. Frontman Jesse Hall's vocals, while adequate in

their distorted squabblings, tend to wander into John Spencer Blues
Explosion territory.
But it's those synths, man, something about those synths that
bring these guys down. Overused, over-mixed and needlessly disso
nant, the incessantly Dada-ist nature of the organ-like synths un
dercuts the real genre-hopping and energy that works well for ESD.
In the end, "Hideous Dance Attack" sounds like a shameful art
punk foray into the realm of novelty acts like the Squirrel Nut Zip
pers. Shame on you. Experimental Dental School, for cheapening
your music so. And shame on you Moses for recommending this
album to me and having the nerve to come up and tell me "these
guys are great live" in the check-out line.
Eledrelane — "The Power Out"
Recommended by: Jeff
England's Electrelane are a group of four women from Brighton
who play like Stereolab. There's not much getting around that. Lis
ten to the breathy vocals, elliptical guitar figure and synths on the
opener "Gone Under Sea" and the similarities will be immediately
apparent. That said, "The Power Out" is a decent record with a few
enchanting melodies.
Like Stereolab, Electrelane takes many cues from Kraut-rock,
featuring many simply strummed guitar passages laid over a driving
rhythm section; however, Electrelane manages to keep the Moog
histrionics and faux lounge-pop to a minimum, while still offering
glossy pop takes on their psychedelic rock idols. "The Power Out"

ends up sounding a lot like Buffalo Daughter's "New Rock," only
much less experimental. And if that's your cup of tea, consider pick
ing up this album.
The Calculators — " Circuit Breaking Silence/Simplicity and Style"
Recommended by: Sandra
The Calculators are a now-defunct Bay Area band bearing much
resemblance in form and music to current dance-punk it-girls the
Rapture. Rapture founding members Vito Roccoforte and Luke
Jenner paid their dues in the Calculators in the late nineties and ev
idently formed their unique post-punk/new wave hybrid while still
in the Calculators.
The disc brings together two hard-to-find Calculators EPs from
the late nineties, "Circuit Breaking Silence" and "Simplicity and
Style," two albums literally brimming with new wave influences.
Shades of Devo pop out all over the place and vintage synths cut
through just about every track prominently, with four of the band's
five members listed as playing synths on at least one track.
While tying themselves closely to their influences, the Calcula
tors were literally bursting with creativity and experimentalism,
bouncing from synth-headed punk to early Eno. Though Jeffrey
Fare's barking vocals and the sometimes meandering synth hooks
become a bit overbearing at times, it is balanced by great moments
paying tribute to Kraftwerk, Gary Numan and just about every
other eighties rock band to front a few vintage keyboards.
SANDRA WINS.
