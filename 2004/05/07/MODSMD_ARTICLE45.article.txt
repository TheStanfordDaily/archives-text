# Our theater critic really, really likes 'The Blue Room'
## 
### MERRITT FORREST BAER INTERMISSIONARY 
Most classes at Stanford are taught
before nightfall; however, this week
there are master classes being offered
nightly in the Drama Department. Se
niors Alexis Boozer and Cody Jensen
Page are offering classes in the art of
character study, cleverly disguised as
a play-namely "The Blue Room" by
David Hare. The erotic play, which
opened last night in Prosser Studio, is
a spectacular chance for both Boozer
and Page to flaunt their fantastic act

ing abilities.
Based on Schnitzler's "La Ronde,"
"The Blue Room" is a two person,
daisy chain of sexual encounters that
conies full circle in its tales of seduc
tion and lust. For example, in the first
scene, woman A meets man A; in
scene two, man A meets woman B; in
scene three, woman B meets man B;
and so on. Performed on Broadway by
Nicole Kidman and lain Glen, this two
person show allows each actor to per
form a multitude of roles.
Edgy and sexy, it's easy to fall
captive to the natural aphrodisiacs

this play provides. Directed by the
creative James C. Lyons, this mini
malist staging allows the perfor
mances to shine through, rather than
obscuring the fine work of two in
credible talents. Using suggestive
rather than literal scenery, Lyons al
lows the audience to fill in the
blanks. In such a steamy production,
this is not a difficult task.
Alexis Boozer parades her acting
chops from character to character.
This series of carnal vignettes allows
her to morph into five outrageously
sexy and colorful women. Employing

an array of accents, Boozer glows
from her first entrance, finding not
only different voices for each charac
ter, but also wildly different gestures
and mannerisms for each. Quite the
artist. Boozer has painted five unique
portraits, each dramatic and com
pelling. The actress, the au pair, the
prostitute, the married woman and
especially the teen model all come to
life thanks to the ample experience of
the leading lady.
Cody Jensen Page also holds up his
end of the bargain, creating five out
standing characters as well. Page intuits
Hare's somewhat convoluted dialogue
and rhythms. His variations between
subtle and outlandish are a joy to watch
as he steps into a diverse group of men,
from a cross-dressing politician to a
New Jersey cab driver. However, the
student character is definitely his most
natural role, and it's easy to love and
understand his boyish frustrations as
Page finds truth in innocence.
The chemistry between Boozer and
Page is nearly electric, and the fact that
they can connect through so many dif
ferent characterizations is only a testa
ment to their strong onstage partner
ship. At moments, the performances
have a dizzying effect, scoring hit after
hit, as each presents what can only be
considered a tour de force. Lyons has
done an amazing job at finding the in
timacy in this ambitious piece.
The only downfall of choosing
such a difficult work is the constraints
of the script. Unfortunately, Hare has
written for a play that is nearly impos
sible in the workings of Prosser Stu
dio. He asks for massive set and cos
tume changes that are only achieved
through the creative simplicity ap
plied here. To enhance the tone, mu
sician Chris Ayer plays original works
on his guitar between scenes. His mu
sical intuitions are dead on, as he ex

plores the true colors of the play
through his interpretive music, which
perfectly complements the acting.
"The Blue Room" is a great exer
cise in the nuance of character devel
opment. Both Boozer and Page grasp
their characters solidly in this titillat
ing production that delivers in each
and every scene. Beautifully stylized,
"The Blue Room" forces us to
question the motivations in our own
relationships, and the relationships of
those we care most about. The divi
sion between love and lust is blurred
in this sleek play, and the allure of sex
is considered from all angles. Howev
er, it is the incredibly complex, lay
ered performances that are the true
gift of this production, making it
more than just an evening of endless
sexcapades, but rather an evening of
great theatre.


Believe it or not, you're going to
conie to love this little guy. Give
him a name, for Chrissake!

only different voices for each charac
ter, but also wildly different gestures
and mannerisms for each. Quite the
artist. Boozer has painted five unique
portraits, each dramatic and com
pelling. The actress, the au pair, the
prostitute, the married woman and
especially the teen model all come to
life thanks to the ample experience of
the leading lady.
Cody Jensen Page also holds up his
end of the bargain, creating five out
standing characters as well. Page intuits
Hare's somewhat convoluted dialogue
and rhythms. His variations between
subtle and outlandish are a joy to watch
as he steps into a diverse group of men,
from a cross-dressing politician to a
New Jersey cab driver. However, the
student character is definitely his most
natural role, and it's easy to love and
understand his boyish frustrations as
Page finds truth in innocence.
The chemistry between Boozer and
Page is nearly electric, and the fact that
they can connect through so many dif
ferent characterizations is only a testa
ment to their strong onstage partner
ship. At moments, the performances
have a dizzying effect, scoring hit after
hit, as each presents what can only be
considered a tour de force. Lyons has
done an amazing job at finding the in
timacy in this ambitious piece.
The only downfall of choosing
such a difficult work is the constraints
of the script. Unfortunately, Hare has
written for a play that is nearly impos
sible in the workings of Prosser Stu
dio. He asks for massive set and cos
tume changes that are only achieved
through the creative simplicity ap
plied here. To enhance the tone, mu
sician Chris Ayer plays original works
on his guitar between scenes. His mu
sical intuitions are dead on, as he ex

plores the true colors of the play
through his interpretive music, which
perfectly complements the acting.
"The Blue Room" is a great exer
cise in the nuance of character devel
opment. Both Boozer and Page grasp
their characters solidly in this titillat
ing production that delivers in each
and every scene. Beautifully stylized,
"The Blue Room" forces us to
question the motivations in our own
relationships, and the relationships of
those we care most about. The divi
sion between love and lust is blurred
in this sleek play, and the allure of sex
is considered from all angles. Howev
er, it is the incredibly complex, lay
ered performances that are the true
gift of this production, making it
more than just an evening of endless
sexcapades, but rather an evening of
great theatre.


Believe it or not, you're going to
conie to love this little guy. Give
him a name, for Chrissake!
