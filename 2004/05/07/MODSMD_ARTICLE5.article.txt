# Cardinal Care costs jump
## 
### ERICK FLORES STAFF WRITER 
Amid rising tuition, increasing room and board
fees and even soaring book prices, students will
have to cope with one more increase next year:
health care.
In a mailing to students last week, the Universi
ty announced that next years Cardinal Care rates
for undergraduates will rise by 20 percent over last
year's premiums to $516. Although the notices
made no explicit mention of a cost change, students
will now be paying nearly 40 percent more than
what they paid two years ago. In 2001-2002, stu
dents were charged $368 per quarter, and this year,
students were charged $432 per quarter.
An increase in health-care costs and the high
price of technological advancements have made
significant impacts both on students' Cardinal Care
insurance programs and on the University budget,
administrators said.
Ira Friedman, director of Vaden Student Health
Center, cited swelling hospital and physician prices,
the proliferation of expensive medical technology
and the growing use of new and expensive prescrip
tion drugs as explanations for the double-digit in
creases in health care the nation has seen over the
past three years. He said that Stanford's location in
the Bay Area is also a factor.
Currently, 60 percent of the undergraduate
population and 75 percent of graduate students are
covered by Cardinal Care, and despite rising costs,
enrollment for both groups has remained relative
ly unchanged, Friedman said. Graduate students
tend to have a higher participation rate because
their age generally makes them ineligible for cov
erage under their parents' plans and because they
often receive partial University subsidies. Increas
es in plan premiums will end up costing the Uni

versity more, as it continues to provide assistance
to these students, he added.
With tuition increases and a battered economy
causing higher demand for financial aid, it remains
to be seen how additional costs tacked on to stu
dents' bills will contribute to their struggle.
Junior Ayla Dillard is a member of Cardinal
Care who was forced to take advantage of her plan
after a series of ailments and injuries affected her
health and campus lifestyle this year. She was un
surprised by the change in costs next year because
of similar increases in tuition and housing and din
ing. She noted that the service is generally worth
the cost.
"I think the quality of care provided is generally
pretty good because it's accessible, the doctors and
staff are very polite and concerned, and you don't
have to pay that much for each consultation," she
said. "But I will definitely have to see how I'm doing
financially and health-wise next year before I de
cide to continue paying for coverage."
A change in the quality or quantity of benefits
being offered is one of the things students will not
have to worry about, Friedman claimed.
"We work hard to assure that Cardinal Care rep
resents excellent quality of health care and I think
students recognize that," he said. "The increasing
costs of insurance have not impacted the quality of
care, but in the outside world I think the answer
would be entirely different."
Students are not the only ones who have felt the
burden of rising health care costs. Last October,
Provost John Etchemendy addressed budget con
cerns and changes that were a result of the nation
wide health care crisis. He noted that the Univer
sity's cost of providing health care would increase
18 percent in 2004. At the same time, he warned
