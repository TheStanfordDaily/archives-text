# Dancing, food, fashion at I-Fest

Venezuelan food. Turkish dancing and a Pakistani
fashion show are just a few of the events that will dazzle
visitors at tomorrow's International Festival at the
Bechtel International Center.
The festival, also known as I-Fest, is the culmination
of International Week, a series of talks, movies and
workshops that emphasize cultural awareness. The
week kicked off on Monday with an exhibition from
Brazilian artist Silvia Poloto. Events so far have includ
ed a Philippine dance workshop, a Jamaican reggae
night and a Venezuelan music session.
The annual celebration of cultures has been a Stan
ford tradition for 24 years.
"Events like this are important because of the
large international student body at Stanford," said
Buki Papillon, an 1-Fest coordinator. "It allows
them to showcase their culture . . . and feel like part
of the community."
For more than five years, the week has also featured
Brazilian Week, and almost every day showcases some
aspect of Brazilian culture from music to cooking.
"The Brazilian Student Association has held its
Brazilian Week during the same week as the I-Center's
International Week for several years now," said Bech
tel Foreign Student Advisor and I-Fest organizer Lynn
Kroner. "It works out quite well for both the Brazilian
Student Association and the I-Center in terms of mutu
al publicity."
The festival itself will include performances and
food — newly added to the menu this year: Turkish and
Venezuelan cuisine — as well as cultural display tables
at which international students can share their culture
with others.

"The performances are always wonderful," Kroner
said. "This year we have dances from Mexico, the
Philippines, Turkey. Egypt. Thailand, Greece, India
and Brazil, as well as a Pakistani fashion show. Indian
songs, a Hindi a cappella group, Turkish and Arabic
classical music and Stanford's own Mariachi group.
"All of the performing groups have some sort of
Stanford connection," she added. "Either they were in
vited to perform by an international organization at
Stanford or they are Stanford students themselves."
Traditionally both International Week and Brazilian
Week conclude with a performance of Brazilian danc
ing group Roda de Capoiera, which is always a "real
crowd-pleaser," Kroner said.
"The Brazilian Students Association considers the
Brazilian performance at the festival as the apex of the
Brazilian Week," said geophysics graduate student
Jaime Urban, a member of the Brazilian Students As
sociation and a two-time attendee of the festival. "The
organizers of the festival say that the Brazilian perfor
mance is the biggest highlight of the event."
The International Festival is the Bechtel Center's
biggest event of the year, drawing people from the sur
rounding community as well as Stanford faculty, staff
and students.
Kroner pointed out that the International Festival
allows people to discover cultures about which they
know very little.
"It provides an excellent opportunity for the Stan
ford community to become aware of the many cultures
represented by the international student population
and to learn a little about those cultures," she said. "It's
a fun way for everyone to learn about some of the coun
tries and cultures that Stanford's international students
come from."
