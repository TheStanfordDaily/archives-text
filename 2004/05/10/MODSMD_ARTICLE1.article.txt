# Election results to be determined by Senate
## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU's special-election results are unknown,
and could remain that way permanently if the Under
graduate Senate certifies the Lee / Mefford ticket's vic
tory in the first executive election tonight.
Last Tuesday, the ASSU Constitutional Council
ruled that the special executive election was to continue,
but requested that the results be kept confidential. The
Elections Commission has so far respected that wish,
despite the tense political climate.
"A lot of people are pressuring me, asking me who
won, but we are not going to look at the results until we
need to," said ASSU Elections Commissioner Ellie
Martin, a junior.
The ball is now in the Senate's court, Martin added.
"The whole election thing is out of my hands,"
she said.

The matter goes before the Senate tonight, when a
fresh crop of senators will decide whether to certify last
month's executive election. If the Senate validates the
first election results, senior Mikey Lee and junior Dylan
Mefford will automatically become president and vice
president, explained Constitutional Council Chair Bill
Curry, a fourth-year doctoral candidate in geophysics.
If the Senate again chooses to not validate the elec
tion results, then the outcome of the special election will
be revealed and go before the Senate for certification.
However, the Senate's grounds for refusing to certify
the initial election results cannot be tied to the contro
versy surrounding the flurry of banned e-mails dis
patched by affiliates of the Lee / Mefford campaign, be
cause the Council found that line of reasoning to uncon
stitutionally violate free-press rights.
Senator Katie Salisbury, a freshman, said this deci
sion is going to be a difficult one.
"This really puts the Senate in a tough place, espe

cially since we have only been in office for two weeks
and a lot of us weren't around when the original elec
tion was not certified," she said. "There are problems
of continuity but I feel like at this point, we really need
to consider the certification based on the merits of the
case, not based on the fact that we've already had a
special election."
Presidential candidate Mikey Lee, a senior, argued
that the Senate needs to certify the original election.
"Now that the Constitutional Council has inter
preted e-mails as protected under the ASSU's own
constitution, it would be a mistake for the Senate to
not certify," Lee said.
Senator Adia Gooden, a freshman, agreed that it
would be a tough decision and pointed out the conse
quences of certification.
"If we choose not to certify but take into account
the e-mails, then the Constitutional Council can ad
dress that again and it could go back and forth,"

Gooden said. "If we do choose to certify the last elec
tion, everyone who ran for the special elections wast
ed their time, energy and money. I think it's really dif
ficult to do because throughout all the discussions to
certify or not certify everybody discussed the e-mails.
It is very hard to separate how you feel about the over
all election and what you should do based on what the
Constitutional Council says."
Despite the repercussions for all candidates, vice
presidential candidate Alyssa Schwartz, a sophomore,
agreed with the Council's decision.
"It is really frustrating for everybody because it has
worked out miserably," Schwartz said. "For the Senate
to make the decision that the results were not valid, de
spite 4,000 people choosing, I have a problem with that.
At this point there is really no great way for it to turn
out, someone is going to be unhappy but once the elec-
tion results were announced, we
should have stuck with that."
Despite over a month of infight
ing within the ASSU and uncer
tainty about next year's leadership,
new Senate Chair Chris Lin pre
dicted that once the results are cer
tain, the Senate will resume busi
ness as usual.
"I think that whenever the dust
finally settles, the president and

vice president, whoever they may
be, will be able to serve effective
ly," said Lin, a junior.
"This past month should in no
way define the ASSU for this up
coming year," he added. "I know
we'll all be ready to move on, fix
the mistakes of the past and get
back to work."
Some students did not share
Lin's optimism.
"Everyone loses: the candidates,
the groups and the student body,"
said junior Josh Seifert. "The ASSU
as a body has lost its legitimacy."
