## Stanford students meet former president of Mexico, another student wins a trip to the Playboy Mansion 
### KATIE BEARMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's the middle of spring quar
ter, and life on campus is a bit fren
zied. Stanford students are scram
bling to balance steady streams of
midterms and problem sets with
insane amounts of club meetings,
performances, rush events and job
interviews. ASSU election scan
dals, Draw number results and
news about parties such as Exotic
Erotic dictate conversation.
Undoubtedly, Stanford-relat
ed gossip and events begin to de
fine students' everyday existence
as they dash through the last
month of the year. With perfect
weather and energetic student
groups advertising in White Plaza,
it is easy to become completely
caught up in one's routine on the
Farm. Remarkably, however,
many Stanford students are par
ticipating in activities that are not
affiliated with the University.
Dinner with the former
president of Mexico
Sophomores Angel Saad and
Agustin Cervantes are two such
students. Although busy with
many Stanford activities, Saad and
Cervantes recently had the oppor
tunity to talk extensively with
Ernesto Zedillo, who served as the
president of Mexico from 1994-
2000, at a UC-Berkeley event.
Emanuel Pleitez, who graduated
from Stanford in 2001, accompa
nied Saad and Cervantes.
They learned of the opportuni
ty to hear Zedillo speak through
an e-mail that circulated via vari
ous Stanford lists.

"We were unsure of whether
to attend or not, but one hour be
fore the event we decided that it
would be a once in a lifetime op
portunity we had to take advan
tage of," Saad said.
Zedillo spoke to over 500
people, and after his presenta
tion, there was a reception for
the general public. Saad, Cer
vantes and Pleitez, however,
were lucky enough to attend a
small dinner with Zedillo follow
ing the reception.
"Zedillo was very friendly, and
we took the opportunity to ap
proach him," Saad said. "My fa
ther and he have been good
friends since Zedillo's early polit
ical career, and they worked to
gether in the late 1980s. 1 told
Zedillo who 1 was, and through
these contacts, we were invited to
join Mr. Zedillo and other Cal fac
ulty at Cal's VIP dinner."
Over dinner, the three Stan
ford students asked the former
president about NAFTA, U.S.-
Mexico immigration, the effects
of globalization on the future of
PEMEX and Mexico's opinion on
U.S. intervention in Iraq.
Saad commented that former
president Zedillo "really allowed
us to expand our views beyond
what the media and government's
rhetoric have told us all along. He
did not give his personal opinion
on many of the matters —after all,
he is a good politician — but he
did raise some other factors that
the general public did not take
into consideration — i.e. a little
inside information."
While Saad, Cervantes and
Pleitez gained new insights from
this internationally well known
figure, Saad emphasized the fact

that Zedillo was
very interested in
what they, as young
students, had to say.
"We were defi
nitely not expecting
that from someone
of such importance,"
Saad remarked.
According to
Saad. Zedillo is
interested in be
coming a visiting
professor at Stan
ford in the future.
At Saad and Cer
vantes' request,
Zedillo also agreed
to try to give a
presentation here
at Stanford.
Winning a
trip to the
Playboy Mansion
Budding artist
Sophomore Luis
Vargas is another

student who has
taken advantage of exciting
opportunities.
Vargas has been drawing fora
long time, and took an art class at
the University winter quarter.
He found out that Playboy
was sponsoring an art contest
for college students in honor of
its 50th anniversary of print.
He had no problem entering a

contest sponsored
by Playboy.
"Playboy is an in
ternationally- recog
nized magazine,"
Vargas said. "I also
believe that the mag
azine is tasteful."
Playboy asked stu
dents to send "artistic
tributes" to the maga
zine, and the winner
would win a trip to
the Playboy mansion
in Los Angeles as well
as a $500 cash prize.
"I thought about
entering fora while,
but I couldn't find
time. I finished my
fall quarter finals
pretty early, and I was
sticking around until
the end. I like draw
ing in my free time, so
I decided to submit
something to the con
test," Vargas said.
Vargas drew a por
trait of a young Hugh
Hefner holding the
first Playboy.
"1 drew it by writ
ing all of the play
mates' names in the
history of Playboy. I
just varied the thick-

ness of the lettering so one can
see the image from far away,"
Vargas said.
Although Vargas thought
that he was wasting his money
by sending in his drawing to
Playboy, he ended up winning
the contest. Vargas lives within
driving distance of the mansion,
so he will receive full limo ser
vice to and from the haven of
beautiful people.
While most guys would brag
endlessly about this once-in-a
lifetime occasion, Vargas said
that he has tried not to make a
big deal about it.
"My friends are basically
the ones telling everyone.
They're excited for me because
my personality really doesn't
fit the prize. I'm the nice,
quiet, and maybe a little shy
type" Vargas commented.
On June 17, Vargas, his step
father and his brother will go to
the mansion and have lunch
with two playmates. Although
he's a shy guy, I'm sure that
Vargas is looking forward to
the trip.
The moral of this article: As
you enjoy what is left of spring
quarter and find yourself en
grossed in the world that is
Stanford, remember to pick
your head up once in awhile —
you might just come across
some interesting off-campus
events in which to participate.
