Questions and photographs by
COURTNEY BRIGHAM


"Mary Kate, by far. She's
got so much more to offer,
you know, like another
name."
MARIO MOYA
Third Year Law Student


"Barf. I can't stand either
one of them."
MEGAN
BAUMGARTNER
Senior, Human Biology


"Ashley, because that's my
sister's name."
TIFFANY TANAKA
Sophomore, Biology


"That's a tough one. In
the first two seasons of
Full House, it was only
Mary Kate on screen, so
for all of us with a two
year-old fetish, she's
clearly the favorite."
STEPHEN COHEN
Junior, Computer Science


"Neither. It scares me that
they just came out with a
new movie."
CRISTINA LASH
Sophomore,
Comparative Literature


"Who are they? Oh yeah,
the annoying girls."
