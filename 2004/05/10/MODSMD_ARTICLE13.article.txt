## Fix post office doors 
### 
The United States Postal Service continues
to drag its feet on fixing the Stanford post
office's south-side doors, severely irking
many students by creating an inconve
nience to their already-busy days. We would like to
see definitive progress on this, aside from replacing

ployees, and not just the bureaucracy in general.
Although the campus' post office has made
numerous improvements over the past few years,
we feel that the Stanford community deservesbet

branch of the U. S. Postal Service to expedite the
repair of its south-side doors, in order to better
serve community members who provide large rev
enues for this branch and who lack an alternative
mail service to which they can turn as a means to
express their current disapproval with the Stan
ford branch.
