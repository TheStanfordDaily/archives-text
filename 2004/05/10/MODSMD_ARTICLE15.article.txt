## Mother's Day confessions 
### 
Yesterday was Mother's Day
and 1 didn't send a card or a
present. 1 called, but that's
really scraping the bottom
of the barrel. And truth be told, this
isn't an isolated incident. In general. I
am more or less delinquent.
So here's my only shot at redemp
tion: This column shall serve as a col
lective apology from all neglectful
college students to their mothers (and
especially mine), appropriately one
day late.
Mom, for what it's worth, I'm not
the only bad one.
Stanford is actually a hotbed of
guilt-ridden offspring, especially when
that Sunday in May rolls around.
In most cases, we really do have
divine intentions, they are just cou
pled with bewilderingly abysmal fol
low-throughs.
"I usually remember to send my
mom a Mother's Day card and present
on, like, Mother's Day, and then it
takes me another week or so to get it
sent out — I blame it on how slow our
post office is," said an anonymous se
nior who is afraid of a firm whupping
from his father. "She sends me Easter
and Halloween packages and asks me
to pick them up like the day before
Easter or Halloween. I usually don't
pick them up until like four days later
when the holiday is completely over. I
used to try to blame that on the slow
post office, so she started doing this
kind of express mail where she can
check when it arrived at the Stanford
post office. So much for that excuse."
Others are a little cockier about how
good they are to their mothers, even
though more inadequate children like
myself would question their motives.
"Sometimes I call her everyday,"
sniped one veritable cherub who de
scribed herself as "such a good daugh-

ter." "Like last week, when I was try
ing to figure out my plane tickets, I
called her everyday. And each time
she was so surprised, she was like
'Ooh, it's you again.'"
In the end, though, even these fa-

milial overachiev
ers must admit
that they have
dropped the ball
more than once.
One prototypi
cal first child —
"I'm not delin
quent, I'm a really
good kid" —
boasted that he
called his mother

once a week, each Sunday. (Then
again, he relayed this to me electroni
cally as he was on the phone with her,
so it is doubtful that she gets his undi
vided attention.)
And even this alpha-son is not
perfect: "I almost forgot about
Mother's Day, if that helps. 1 sent a
card on Thursday, but apparently
my mom didn't get it yet," he admit
ted sheepishly. "I also sent my dad
money and had him pick out a gift
for her, so I'm lazy."
But communal slacking doesn't ab
solve me from the wrongs I've com
mitted, so I figured the best thing I
could do was 'fess up to my inadequa
cies. That's right. I called up my mom
and asked her to give me a swift kick in
the ass, so to speak.
"You really want to hear this?" she
said when I asked her to tell me how 1
had failed her as a daughter. "You
don't call unless you need something.
You don't return calls unless I call suf
ficiently to annoy you, so then I be
come an annoying mother. You don't
return e-mails.
"Except for the fact that you've cut

communication from us, you're fine."
(For the record, our "La la la I-call
my-mom-everyday" cherub from be
fore read this and responded "My
mommy wouldn't say that about me.
Actually, I'm gonna call her just to see
what she would say ... Oh! She said
I'm not delinquent! I am the sweetest
thing!" Reminds you of the kids you
always wanted to beat up on the play
ground, huh?)
So, as a first step in trying to make
it up to my mother. I figured the best
belated Mother's Day gift I could
giver her was the opportunity to ad
dress all Stanford students (presum
ably including me ...) and give them
her perspective on how they can be
better to their mothers.
Behold. Susan Graham's gospel.
Try one: "Oh, wow, you're giving
me a soap box? Huh. Huh. Huh-huh
huh. Huh. I don't know, honey, why
don't you write something about
Admit Weekend?"
Try two: "Let your parents live
vicariously through you, at least a
little bit."
Try three, the real advice: "It would
be nice to reply to phone messages
within 12 hours, and e-mail messages
within eight hours, since we know
you're online all the time."
Kids, the mothers have spoken,
gauntlets have been thrown. Are we
up to the challenge? I can't make any
promises, but at least we know where
to start now.
Happy Mother's Day.a day late.

belated Mother's Day gift I could
giver her was the opportunity to ad
dress all Stanford students (presum

her perspective on how they can be
better to their mothers.
Behold. Susan Graham's gospel.
Try one: "Oh, wow, you're giving
me a soap box? Huh. Huh. Huh-huh
huh. Huh. I don't know, honey, why
don't you write something about
Admit Weekend?"
Try two: "Let your parents live
vicariously through you, at least a
little bit."
Try three, the real advice: "It would
be nice to reply to phone messages
within 12 hours, and e-mail messages
within eight hours, since we know
you're online all the time."
Kids, the mothers have spoken,
gauntlets have been thrown. Are we
up to the challenge? I can't make any
promises, but at least we know where
to start now.
Happy Mother's Day.a day late.

Yesterday was Mother's Day
and 1 didn't send a card or a
present. 1 called, but that's
really scraping the bottom
of the barrel. And truth be told, this
isn't an isolated incident. In general. I
am more or less delinquent.
So here's my only shot at redemp
tion: This column shall serve as a col
lective apology from all neglectful
college students to their mothers (and
especially mine), appropriately one
day late.
Mom, for what it's worth, I'm not
the only bad one.
Stanford is actually a hotbed of
guilt-ridden offspring, especially when
that Sunday in May rolls around.
In most cases, we really do have
divine intentions, they are just cou
pled with bewilderingly abysmal fol
low-throughs.
"I usually remember to send my
mom a Mother's Day card and present
on, like, Mother's Day, and then it
takes me another week or so to get it
sent out — I blame it on how slow our
post office is," said an anonymous se
nior who is afraid of a firm whupping
from his father. "She sends me Easter
and Halloween packages and asks me
to pick them up like the day before
Easter or Halloween. I usually don't
pick them up until like four days later
when the holiday is completely over. I
used to try to blame that on the slow
post office, so she started doing this
kind of express mail where she can
check when it arrived at the Stanford
post office. So much for that excuse."
Others are a little cockier about how
good they are to their mothers, even
though more inadequate children like
myself would question their motives.
"Sometimes I call her everyday,"
sniped one veritable cherub who de
scribed herself as "such a good daugh-

ter." "Like last week, when I was try
ing to figure out my plane tickets, I
called her everyday. And each time
she was so surprised, she was like
'Ooh, it's you again.'"
In the end, though, even these fa-

milial overachiev
ers must admit
that they have
dropped the ball
more than once.
One prototypi
cal first child —
"I'm not delin
quent, I'm a really
good kid" —
boasted that he
called his mother

once a week, each Sunday. (Then
again, he relayed this to me electroni
cally as he was on the phone with her,
so it is doubtful that she gets his undi
vided attention.)
And even this alpha-son is not
perfect: "I almost forgot about
Mother's Day, if that helps. 1 sent a
card on Thursday, but apparently
my mom didn't get it yet," he admit
ted sheepishly. "I also sent my dad
money and had him pick out a gift
for her, so I'm lazy."
But communal slacking doesn't ab
solve me from the wrongs I've com
mitted, so I figured the best thing I
could do was 'fess up to my inadequa
cies. That's right. I called up my mom
and asked her to give me a swift kick in
the ass, so to speak.
"You really want to hear this?" she
said when I asked her to tell me how 1
had failed her as a daughter. "You
don't call unless you need something.
You don't return calls unless I call suf
ficiently to annoy you, so then I be
come an annoying mother. You don't
return e-mails.
"Except for the fact that you've cut

communication from us, you're fine."
(For the record, our "La la la I-call
my-mom-everyday" cherub from be
fore read this and responded "My
mommy wouldn't say that about me.
Actually, I'm gonna call her just to see
what she would say ... Oh! She said
I'm not delinquent! I am the sweetest
thing!" Reminds you of the kids you
always wanted to beat up on the play
ground, huh?)
So, as a first step in trying to make
it up to my mother. I figured the best
belated Mother's Day gift I could
giver her was the opportunity to ad
dress all Stanford students (presum
ably including me ...) and give them
