# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## Mountain lion has spring fever 
### 
The current strain of mountain
lion attacks near the Dish is
frightening a lot of people.
Our horses are being at
tacked, and with gas prices being so
high, the mountain lion is striking at
our best means of transportation. So,
solutions are being proposed. Some
have suggested hunting down the lion
and killing it. Some have suggested
electing it to public office. But I have
several other ideas.
I, for one, am not for killing any liv
ing creature. It's a wild animal, a fellow
being of the Earth, and I feel we have
no right to kill it. And I'm guessing that
since we haven't seen any other lions
up there, it's pretty lonely. In a way,
Stanford students in spring aren't very
different from the lion. We're all seek
ing mates, and when we can't find
them, we resort to other things to
channel our energy, such as playing
Halo or living vicariously through the
characters of "The 0.C."
So there have been some horses at
tacked. These attacks may not be pre
meditated, however. I mean, if the
lion is in the spirit of the season, and
desperate, it could do something it
would regret. He may be just coming
off a long-term relationship and
couldn't even get any at Kappa Sig's
foam party. He may just have been
desperate for any kind of hook-up.
I'm guessing the horse wasn't too into
the idea though. After getting shot

down, the lion doesn't have Halo to
compensate for his social rejection.
Instead, he has claws.

While friends
of the lion have
been urging him to
go to The Bridge
to talk about his
problems, he con
tinues to use his
claws in a destruc
tive fashion, both
hurting himself
and others.
So again, I don't

want to hurt the lion. He's having a
tough enough time. You know if you
got shot down by Mr. Ed, you proba
bly wouldn't want to get shot at, too.
Your humiliation is probably pretty
unbearable as it is.
Now I'm trying to think of a con
structive way to deal with this situation.
Since airmailing him a mate doesn't
seem feasible, I think we probably
should put him in a wildlife reserve: a
supporting and nurturing environment
that has a great singles scene.
But I don't want him to go quite
yet. It's not everyday we have a lion
around The Farm. And the USC Tro
jan Marching Band was on campus
this weekend for the women's water
polo tournament. I'm not suggesting
anything here. I'm just saying they
have a horse named "Traveler," and if
they chose to walk to the Dish with

Traveler bathed in BBQ sauce — er, I
had nothing to do with it.
I guess what I'm saying here is that
we should make the best of this situa
tion. We shouldn't think of the moun
tain lion as a problem, but as a possible
answer to some of our troubles.
Let's take those repeating stop
sign violators, for instance. If these
bikers had to spend a night by the
Dish wearing nothing but flank steak
pants, we might have a drastic reduc
tion in bike accidents.
And what about all those a cappel
la groups? There's an old saying here:
"Music is able to tame the wildest of
beasts." I agree completely. But let's
test that. There's no better audience
than a mountain lion to see if your
cover of Britney Spears' "Toxic" is
suitable for listeners.
Well, these are all humble sugges
tions here. Admittedly, some of them
probably wouldn't pan out. Subjugat
ing the lion to a cappella may be an an
imal rights abuse. Similarly, since ev
eryone gets bike citations, the lion
would have too much work to do.
And as for the USC Trojan Marching
Band — 0.K., I still think this is a
good idea.

Chris Holt hopes the election gets certi
fied just so he can see how the mountain
lion did. Maybe with a public office, it
can finally meet someone. Send com

bly wouldn't want to get shot at, too.
Your humiliation is probably pretty
unbearable as it is.
Now I'm trying to think of a con
structive way to deal with this situation.
Since airmailing him a mate doesn't
seem feasible, I think we probably
should put him in a wildlife reserve: a
supporting and nurturing environment
that has a great singles scene.
But I don't want him to go quite
yet. It's not everyday we have a lion
around The Farm. And the USC Tro
jan Marching Band was on campus
this weekend for the women's water
polo tournament. I'm not suggesting
anything here. I'm just saying they
have a horse named "Traveler," and if
they chose to walk to the Dish with

Traveler bathed in BBQ sauce — er, I
had nothing to do with it.
I guess what I'm saying here is that
we should make the best of this situa
tion. We shouldn't think of the moun
tain lion as a problem, but as a possible
answer to some of our troubles.
Let's take those repeating stop
sign violators, for instance. If these
bikers had to spend a night by the
Dish wearing nothing but flank steak
pants, we might have a drastic reduc
tion in bike accidents.
And what about all those a cappel
la groups? There's an old saying here:
"Music is able to tame the wildest of
beasts." I agree completely. But let's
test that. There's no better audience
than a mountain lion to see if your
cover of Britney Spears' "Toxic" is
suitable for listeners.
Well, these are all humble sugges
tions here. Admittedly, some of them
probably wouldn't pan out. Subjugat
ing the lion to a cappella may be an an
imal rights abuse. Similarly, since ev
eryone gets bike citations, the lion
would have too much work to do.
And as for the USC Trojan Marching
Band — 0.K., I still think this is a
good idea.

Chris Holt hopes the election gets certi
fied just so he can see how the mountain
lion did. Maybe with a public office, it
can finally meet someone. Send com
plaints to Chris at cholt@stanford.edu.
