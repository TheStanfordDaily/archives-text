## ASSU should vote to certify April's executive election results 
### MIKEY LEE DYLAN MEFFORD 
While this quarter has been a long
one for both of us, the past few days
have given us a renewed feeling of
hope for the future of the ASSU, be
ginning with tonight's Undergraduate
Senate meeting. Newly elected sena
tors will decide tonight whether or not
to certify the results of the executive
portion of the April election in which
they were elected
Tonight's decision is a very impor
tant one in light of this year's election
controversy, where the most recent
development was the ASSU Constitu
tional Council's ruling that the previ
ous Senate's decision to not certify the
election based on endorsement and
campaign e-mails was a violation of
free-speech rights protected under the
Constitution. (The Constitutional
Council serves as the Supreme Court
like body of the ASSU.)
In question is the future of the

ASSU as an institution — its integri
ty and its role as the sole organization
that represents every student as a li
aison between students and Univer
sity administrators.
The first thing we want to clarify,
though, is the relationship between
the two of us. Mikey's decision to run
with Alvssa Schwartz in this past
week's special election was in no way
personal toward Dylan, and was done
in response to the negative stigma cre
ated by the past Senate's decision to
not certify the first election. Dylan was
in support of Mikey throughout the
special election process, helping him
flyer and working to build the Lee-
Schwartz platform. The two of us have
been very gixid friends since we met,
and we remain so even through the
events that have taken place in the last
few weeks.
The second thing to clarify is our
position on the current state of affairs,
which includes a potentially disastrous
result if the Senate goes against the

recommendation of its own law-inter
preting body and votes again to not
certify the original election results. We
feel that beginning tonight, the priori
ty of the ASSU should be to take the
first steps toward solving these prob
lems. The real issue at hand is election
reform, and in the face of this, the two
of us are already looking into potential
models of working groups to figure out
how to best restructure the election
system so that an episode like this will
never again happen. One such model
would comprise legal experts, elec
tions commissioners and candidates
involved in the past election. This
working group would be required to
print its initial product in The Daily
before the end of this year.
What is most important is that the
original vote was the accurate repre
sentation of student sentiment. Every
one of the 4,020 votes was cast by an in
dividual acting on his or her own free
will, and we feel that there is nothing
less democratic than having the elect

ed representatives of the people eras
ing the votes of the people.
Many have made allegations of
campaign violations. While these alle
gations were based almost completely
on e-mails that are legally and consti
tutionally protected, we acknowledge
that they may still be viewed as con
troversial. Elections bring out person
al feelings and often submerge ratio
nality, logic and respect for law under
emotional expressions. We fully ex
pect that the supporters of our former
opponents — as well as others — may
not want to see us take office, despite
our clear victory.
Yet, should the Senate vote to cer
tify the election results tonight, and
should the Graduate Studeht Council
vote to certify the election results on
Wednesday — as it already did once
before — we will take office as your
ASSU president and vice president. In
that case, we will seek to represent all
students, and will embrace all commu
nities on this campus in order to unite

the student body behind clear vision
and values.
We will return your government
to you by engaging your talents, ideas
and initiatives to improve your Stan
ford experience. This has been our
promise and our commitment to all
Stanford students from the very outset
of this entire process. Your opinion of
us personally — while important — is
less important than your vision for the
ASSU. Should we be certified, we ask
that you ask much of us and allow us to
ask much of you. We believe that the
strength of any government is mea
sured by the extent to which it engages
the very people it claims to represent
in the decision-making process.
In certifying the election, we hope
the Senate will send a strong message to
you that your vote does count. Togeth
er, we will restore democracy, strength
en justice and uphold our Constitution.
Finally, we want to make it clear
that this is not about a line on a resume
or money or power. It's about our com

mitment to better student life in all of
its aspects. It's also about doing a job
and committing to serve over 14,(X)0
students by providing a resource
whose boundaries are very extensive.
We look forward to following through
with that, and sincerely hope that the
Senate will certify the election results
so that we can get to the work that we
committed to do in the first place.
We urge the new Undergraduate
Senate to make its decision not on the
basis of bias or consideration of a spe
cial election that stemmed from an un
constitutional decision by the old Sen
ate. but on the basis of its own law —
the ASSU Constitution — now that an
area that was gray has been clarified by
those in charge of interpreting that law.

We will return your government
to you by engaging your talents, ideas
and initiatives to improve your Stan
ford experience. This has been our
promise and our commitment to all
Stanford students from the very outset
of this entire process. Your opinion of
us personally — while important — is
less important than your vision for the
ASSU. Should we be certified, we ask
that you ask much of us and allow us to
ask much of you. We believe that the
strength of any government is mea
sured by the extent to which it engages
the very people it claims to represent
in the decision-making process.
In certifying the election, we hope
the Senate will send a strong message to
you that your vote does count. Togeth
er, we will restore democracy, strength
en justice and uphold our Constitution.
Finally, we want to make it clear
that this is not about a line on a resume
or money or power. It's about our com

mitment to better student life in all of
its aspects. It's also about doing a job
and committing to serve over 14,(X)0
students by providing a resource
whose boundaries are very extensive.
We look forward to following through
with that, and sincerely hope that the
Senate will certify the election results
so that we can get to the work that we
committed to do in the first place.
We urge the new Undergraduate
Senate to make its decision not on the
basis of bias or consideration of a spe
cial election that stemmed from an un
constitutional decision by the old Sen
ate. but on the basis of its own law —
the ASSU Constitution — now that an
area that was gray has been clarified by
those in charge of interpreting that law.

While this quarter has been a long
one for both of us, the past few days
have given us a renewed feeling of
hope for the future of the ASSU, be
ginning with tonight's Undergraduate
Senate meeting. Newly elected sena
tors will decide tonight whether or not
to certify the results of the executive
portion of the April election in which
they were elected
Tonight's decision is a very impor
tant one in light of this year's election
controversy, where the most recent
development was the ASSU Constitu
tional Council's ruling that the previ
ous Senate's decision to not certify the
election based on endorsement and
campaign e-mails was a violation of
free-speech rights protected under the
Constitution. (The Constitutional
Council serves as the Supreme Court
like body of the ASSU.)
In question is the future of the

ASSU as an institution — its integri
ty and its role as the sole organization
that represents every student as a li
aison between students and Univer
sity administrators.
The first thing we want to clarify,
though, is the relationship between
the two of us. Mikey's decision to run
with Alvssa Schwartz in this past
week's special election was in no way
personal toward Dylan, and was done
in response to the negative stigma cre
ated by the past Senate's decision to
not certify the first election. Dylan was
in support of Mikey throughout the
special election process, helping him
flyer and working to build the Lee-
Schwartz platform. The two of us have
been very gixid friends since we met,
and we remain so even through the
events that have taken place in the last
few weeks.
The second thing to clarify is our
position on the current state of affairs,
which includes a potentially disastrous
result if the Senate goes against the

recommendation of its own law-inter
preting body and votes again to not
certify the original election results. We
feel that beginning tonight, the priori
ty of the ASSU should be to take the
first steps toward solving these prob
lems. The real issue at hand is election
reform, and in the face of this, the two
of us are already looking into potential
models of working groups to figure out
how to best restructure the election
system so that an episode like this will
never again happen. One such model
would comprise legal experts, elec
tions commissioners and candidates
involved in the past election. This
working group would be required to
print its initial product in The Daily
before the end of this year.
What is most important is that the
original vote was the accurate repre
sentation of student sentiment. Every
one of the 4,020 votes was cast by an in
dividual acting on his or her own free
will, and we feel that there is nothing
less democratic than having the elect

ed representatives of the people eras
ing the votes of the people.
Many have made allegations of
campaign violations. While these alle
gations were based almost completely
on e-mails that are legally and consti
tutionally protected, we acknowledge
that they may still be viewed as con
troversial. Elections bring out person
al feelings and often submerge ratio
nality, logic and respect for law under
emotional expressions. We fully ex
pect that the supporters of our former
opponents — as well as others — may
not want to see us take office, despite
our clear victory.
Yet, should the Senate vote to cer
tify the election results tonight, and
should the Graduate Studeht Council
vote to certify the election results on
Wednesday — as it already did once
before — we will take office as your
ASSU president and vice president. In
that case, we will seek to represent all
students, and will embrace all commu
nities on this campus in order to unite

the student body behind clear vision
and values.
We will return your government
to you by engaging your talents, ideas
and initiatives to improve your Stan
ford experience. This has been our
