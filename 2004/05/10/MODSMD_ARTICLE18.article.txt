## Students should commemorate North Korean Human Rights Week 
### SUNG LEE 
During this week last year, eye
opening facts — such as how many
hours a day political prisoners are
forced to work in North Korean prisons
(17) or how many grams of food are ra
tioned daily to an average North Kore
an citizen (250) — were displayed in
White Plaza. Since last May, however, a
number of events have testified to the
increasing severity of North Korean
human rights violations.
First, while the international com
munity rushed to help the victims of last
month's train explosion, which claimed
hundreds of lives and injured thou
sands, the World Food Program
(WFP) emphasized that North Korea's
humanitarian crisis extends beyond
Ryongchon. A recent fall-off in contri
butions has forced WFP to halt vital ra
tions to millions of North Korea's hun

griest children, women and elderly peo
ple. Without additional pledges, the
number of this vulnerable population
not receiving WFP grain is set to rise
from the one million who currently do
no receive aid to 3.8 million in October.
This is in a country where, according to
the United Nations, famine has de
stroyed 12 to 15 percent of the total
population in the last decade.
Second, a number of defectors testi
fied to witnessing chemical experi
ments being carried out on political
prisoners in specially constructed gas
chambers in North Korea. These alle
gations were verified by BBC News
with "letters of transfer" that read:
"The above person is transferred from
Camp 22 for the purpose of human ex
perimentation with liquid gas for chem
ical weapons." The concentration
camps in North Korea are reported to
hold 200,000 political prisoners today.

Third, international media reported
that a North Korean defector was shot
dead by a Chinese border guard while
attempting to escape to Mongolia from
China on April 2. Seventeen others in
volved in the escape attempt were cap
tured and detained by Chinese border
guards. The men went on a hunger
strike, demanding, for fear of persecu
tion, that they not be sent back to North
Korea. This incident demonstrated
Beijing's flagrant disregard for its obli
gation under international law to pro
tect refugees. The Chinese government
has continued to search for and repatri
ate North Korean refugees in China,
who number as many as 300,000 today
according to Human Rights Watch.
This fear of repatriation has made
North Korean refugees in China ex
tremely vulnerable to violation of their
physical rights. In particular. North Ko
rean women have become victims of an

increasingly organized sexual traffick
ing network.
Millions dying of starvation, chemi
cal experimentation on fellow human
beings and the fatal shooting of a
refugee in his attempt to seek freedom
— these phrases should outrage us.
The reality of life of a North Korean
should distress us, infuriate us, move us
to ask what needs to be done and ulti
mately to do something. However,
North Korea is still most likely to come
up in our conversations only in the con
text of its nuclear threat to outsiders.
The 22 million North Korean peo
ple deserve to have their voices heard.

They deserve to have their needs and
desperations addressed.
This week, a number of events will
be held to raise awareness of these is
sues and create a space for response to
that awareness. The special lecture this
afternoon and a panel on Wednesday
will gather the foremost experts on
human rights in North Korea, including
Larry Diamond — former ambassador
to China and South Korea, former di
rector of Amnesty International, cur
rent director of U.S. Committee for
Human Rights in North Korea and
Stanford professor. These events, and
the screening of a documentary filmed

inside North Korea, will provide excel
lent opportunities to learn more about
the human rights abuses that occur in
side this isolated country, and will en
gage community members in an impor
tant debate on how to approach this
problem. This week will also provide
many opportunities to translate these
concerns into tangible actions to help
North Koreans. By participating in the
student rally tomorrow at noon or at
tending Thursday's benefit concert or
joining Friday's lunch last, you can
stand in solidarity with North Korean
people. Above all, be sure to stop by
our table at White Plaza at least once
this week and sign the petitions.
We invite all members of the Stan
ford community to seek more aware
ness and action for human rights of
North Koreans. In face of such an
egregious human rights tragedies, the
last place you want to be in is a state
of indifference.

During this week last year, eye
opening facts — such as how many
hours a day political prisoners are
forced to work in North Korean prisons
(17) or how many grams of food are ra
tioned daily to an average North Kore
an citizen (250) — were displayed in
White Plaza. Since last May, however, a
number of events have testified to the
increasing severity of North Korean
human rights violations.
First, while the international com
munity rushed to help the victims of last
month's train explosion, which claimed
hundreds of lives and injured thou
sands, the World Food Program
(WFP) emphasized that North Korea's
humanitarian crisis extends beyond
Ryongchon. A recent fall-off in contri
butions has forced WFP to halt vital ra
tions to millions of North Korea's hun

griest children, women and elderly peo
ple. Without additional pledges, the
number of this vulnerable population
not receiving WFP grain is set to rise
from the one million who currently do
no receive aid to 3.8 million in October.
This is in a country where, according to
the United Nations, famine has de
stroyed 12 to 15 percent of the total
population in the last decade.
Second, a number of defectors testi
fied to witnessing chemical experi
ments being carried out on political
prisoners in specially constructed gas
chambers in North Korea. These alle
gations were verified by BBC News
with "letters of transfer" that read:
"The above person is transferred from
Camp 22 for the purpose of human ex
perimentation with liquid gas for chem
ical weapons." The concentration
camps in North Korea are reported to
hold 200,000 political prisoners today.

Third, international media reported
that a North Korean defector was shot
dead by a Chinese border guard while
attempting to escape to Mongolia from
China on April 2. Seventeen others in
volved in the escape attempt were cap
tured and detained by Chinese border
guards. The men went on a hunger
strike, demanding, for fear of persecu
tion, that they not be sent back to North
Korea. This incident demonstrated
Beijing's flagrant disregard for its obli
gation under international law to pro
tect refugees. The Chinese government
has continued to search for and repatri
ate North Korean refugees in China,
who number as many as 300,000 today
according to Human Rights Watch.
This fear of repatriation has made
North Korean refugees in China ex
tremely vulnerable to violation of their
physical rights. In particular. North Ko
rean women have become victims of an

increasingly organized sexual traffick
ing network.
Millions dying of starvation, chemi
cal experimentation on fellow human
beings and the fatal shooting of a
refugee in his attempt to seek freedom
— these phrases should outrage us.
The reality of life of a North Korean
should distress us, infuriate us, move us
to ask what needs to be done and ulti
mately to do something. However,
North Korea is still most likely to come
up in our conversations only in the con
text of its nuclear threat to outsiders.
The 22 million North Korean peo
ple deserve to have their voices heard.

They deserve to have their needs and
desperations addressed.
This week, a number of events will
be held to raise awareness of these is
sues and create a space for response to
that awareness. The special lecture this
afternoon and a panel on Wednesday
will gather the foremost experts on
human rights in North Korea, including
Larry Diamond — former ambassador
to China and South Korea, former di
rector of Amnesty International, cur
rent director of U.S. Committee for
Human Rights in North Korea and
Stanford professor. These events, and
the screening of a documentary filmed

inside North Korea, will provide excel
lent opportunities to learn more about
the human rights abuses that occur in
side this isolated country, and will en
gage community members in an impor
tant debate on how to approach this
problem. This week will also provide
many opportunities to translate these
concerns into tangible actions to help
North Koreans. By participating in the
student rally tomorrow at noon or at
tending Thursday's benefit concert or
joining Friday's lunch last, you can
