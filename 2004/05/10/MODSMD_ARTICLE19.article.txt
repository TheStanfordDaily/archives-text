## Corporate sponsors take over ballparks 
### 
The Texas Rangers joined an ever-expanding
club on Friday when they sold the naming rights
for The Ballpark in Arlington to Ameriquest
Mortgage Company. It's not a big deal, I sup
pose, since 69 other American and Canadian sports
teams have sold their naming rights, too.
But, in the wake of the Spiderman 2 controversy —
in which Major League Baseball announced plans to
place stickers advertising the sequel on the bases dur
ing the All-Star Game, before backing off after a pub
lic outcry — it's clear that corporate stadium names
are far from an anomaly.
Recent years have seen the advent of revolving ad
vertisements behind home plate or along midcourt, a
million team sponsors (Don't you want to take the offi
cial natural fiber supplement of the NHL?) and the pro
liferation of a million commemorative patches — a
dizzying practice that culminated in the Devil Rays and
Yankees wearing RICOH advertisements on their caps
during their Japan tour.
It's understandable why teams sell their stadium nam
ing rights. I mean, if you own the Calgary Flames and you
can get a million American dollars a year to play your
games in the Pengrowth Saddledome, don't you jump at
the chance? Well, okay, you're from Calgary, so I guess
it's irrelevant. But you know what I mean.

The thing with corporate sponsor
ship, though, is that fans know they're
supposed to dislike it. Is there anyone
on the face of the earth not affiliated
with the transacting parties who would
rather it be Ameriquest Field in Ar
lington than the good old Ballpark?
No.
And when you think about it, how
many things on the face of the earth are
there that inspire such unanimity? An
ugly, sell-out of a stadium name is triv-

ial compared to events of real historical impact, yet it in
spires such a universal and wholehearted condemnation,
from Fan A to Fan Z.
So, then, does it really make business sense fora com
pany to forcibly associate itself with such negative
thoughts? Is the enmity that a Rangers fan has for
Ameriquest because of the naming deal going to be made
up for by the fact that he or she will at least be familiar
with the company's name?
I think the fallacy is that naming rights actually in
crease fan awareness. I know the 49ers play in 3Com
Park, but I to this day have absolutely no idea what 3Com
is. Probably an energy firm or a consulting outfit, but so
what? Am I going to do business with them just because
t hey blew seven figures on naming a concrete donut ? Un
likely — and particularly not if saying the stadium name
makes me feel somehow tainted. (
The key to naming a stadium is to make the name un
obtrusive and not too blatantly commercial. For example,
the Bulls and Blackhawks play in the United Center.
Sure, it's an airline; but it's also a stand-alone name.
"United Center" is nice enough to say, involves real
words, isn't obviously commercial, and is generally a pret
ty low-key way for Chicago's airline to say, hey, we do
business here and we like the Bulls, too.
A very clever name is Cincinnati's Great American
Ball Park. Who knew? I thought they just called it that for
bravado — I've been to Cincy, and the park is a gorgeous
edifice, right down by the river, in the heart of America or
whatever, so the name makes sense on its own.
Turns out, though, that the park is sponsored by Great
American Insurance. Clever, understated and still a de
cent name. Fans don't mind things like that so much; the
Reds get some extra cash to pay for all of Ken Griffey's
visits to the orthopedic surgeon, and the fans don't have
to get pissed every time they mention the ballpark.
The best examples of commercial stadium names are,
by design, not the first that come to mind. That honor is
reserved for the truly horrendous names, those which
make fans clench their teeth.
One key addendum to the low-profile criteria we've
already established is that the stadium needs to be named
after something respectable-sounding. Airlines and fi
nancial services groups often make decent stadium
names for this reason.
The worst kind of name, of course, is that of a cell
phone company. The White Sox have one of the most
egregious stadium names: U.S. Cellular Field. I still call
it Comiskey Park. Yes, Comiskey was a blackguard, but
at least he was successful; U.S. Cellular is not even a de
cent cell-phone company. U.S. Cellular Field could be
the next Pro Player Stadium, the Marlins and Dolphins
structure named after a product line that went bankrupt
in 1998.
Then there is the silly-name factor. Usually the names
aren't outright ridiculous, but rather faux-tech concoc
tions painfully reminiscent of the 19905. Ameriquest is a
bit of a silly name, and stadiums named after 3Com, In
vesco and Xcel are no better.
I'd argue that the worst stadium name in American
and Canadian sports comes out of Nashville, where
the NHL's Predators play in the Gaylord Entertain
ment Center.
I mean, first off. you're going to see a hockey game in
Nashville, which lacks legitimacy to begin with. Then,
you're going to see an event at an "Entertainment Cen
ter." What is this, the WWE? I know it's hockey, but it's
still a sport; it certainly isn't "entertainment" (and yes you
can take that one both ways... I sure did, anyway).
As with most corporate partners. I had no idea what
Gaylord Entertainment actually did, so I checked out
their Web site. They provide convention services and
"leisure experiences." Fantastic. I can't wait until Carni
val Cruise Lines names a soccer field.
Shelling out millions of dollars to slap your name on an
arena isn't going to suddenly buy you legitimacy or any
thing more than the most hollow name recognition. Sta
dium naming rights are best invested in by companies
with brand equity and recognizable nameplates.
If you're American Airlines and you want to name an
arena, it will probably work for you. But if you're
Ameriquest Mortgage, it's kind of a stretch. Because
America values its parks and arenas, and it wants them to
have respectable names.
