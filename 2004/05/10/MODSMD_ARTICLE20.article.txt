# Stanford falls flat in rubber game
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
In April 2002. the Washington Huskies stunned the
Stanford baseball squad in Seattle, taking two of three
games as one pitcher, Shawn Kohn. picked up both victories
in the series.
Over the weekend at Husky Ballpark, No. 21 Washington
(28-15-1, 12-6 Pacific-10 Conference) shocked the top
ranked Cardinal (37-8,11-4) with a repeat of this trend.
After splitting the first two games — the Huskies came
away with a 3-2, 10-inning win on Friday while Stanford
collected a 7-2 Saturday victory — Washington drummed
up its best offensive contest of the weekend to win Sun
day's game, 9-2, and hand the Cardinal its first series loss of
the 2004 season.

Both wins improved the record of one hurler, Washington
ace Tim Lincecum. The freshman threw the final two frames
of Friday nights game and, on just one day's rest, tossed eight
strong innings yesterday afternoon.
The Cardinal turned in a wide spectrum of performances
beginning with a series start that featured a strong outing by
sophomore ace Mark Romanczuk. The lefty made getting
the stick on the ball tough for the Huskies, giving up only two
runs on six hits with eight strikeouts in a season-high nine in
nings of work.
Unfortunately for Stanford, Washington starter Kyle
Parker had the same kind of evening on the mound, giving up
two runs on five hits before surrendering his role to Lince
cum in the ninth.

The Stanford baseball team lost two out of three games this past weekend against Washington in Seattle. The
Huskies moved within a half game of the first place Cardinal in the Pacific-10 Conference standings.
The 10th frame was a reliever's
battle for the Pac-10 rivals, and, in the
end, Lincecum outdid Stanford's
freshman duo of Blake Holler and
Jeff Stimpson (who took the loss).
"I thought Romanczuk pitched
well," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "We just gave them
too much."
The rout was the Cardinal's first
extra-innings loss of the season.
While Friday's pitching was tight
and its hitting sparse, everything came
together for the Cardinal on Saturday.
Though sophomore starter Jeff
Gilmore faced a rough situation — he
was feeling sick the day of the game in
addition to having to deal with a 57-
minute rain delay in the fifth inning —
the righthander allowed only two runs
on six hits in his seven-inning stint.
"Every pitch was a battle uphill, es
pecially against these hitters,"
Gilmore said. "They're not so much a
groundball hitting team. They're
going to get the ball up in the air even
if you throw it down there, and fortu

nately I kept it low enough to keep the
ball in the yard."
Gilmore's outing gave the Stan
ford bats a chance to rev up — which
they did in typical Cardinal fashion.
Sophomore infielder Jed Lowrie led
the way with his 3-for-4 day at the
plate, as he became the first Stanford
player this season to hit three dou
bles in a game. Sophomore infielder
Chris Minaker also chipped in three
hits with an RBI, while senior center
fielder Sam Fuld and junior leftfield
er Danny Putnam — who was the
only Stanford player with multiple
hits on Friday — each posted a pair
of safeties.
Yesterday, though, the Cardinal
flailed while up against the arm of
Lincecum. Thirteen Stanford batters
went down on strikes in Lincecum s
eight innings, and though seven Car
dinal players collected base knocks
(Putnam was once again the only
batsman with more than one hit), the
team could not register timely hits in
the contest.
"We heard that [Lincecum] was
pretty wild," Putnam said. "But he
was throwing all three pitches for
strikes [yesterday]. Some of the guys
on the Washington team said he was
working on his change and he had his
change working all day. He was on
his game."

Only two home runs — one from
Putnam, one from junior designated
hitter Chris Carter — saved the Car
dinal from a shut out. The 9-2 decision
was the first time this season that Stan
ford lost by more than three runs.
Five Stanford pitchers tried to con
tain the Washington hitters: freshman
starter Greg Reynolds went 2 1 / 3 in
nings and gave up four runs before
stepping aside for Holler, freshman
Matt Leva, sophomore Matt Manship
and sophomore Kodiak Quick. Only
Quick was able to avoid giving up a
run or a hit.
Washington scored in each of the
first five frames, including a four-run
fifth that boosted its run total to nine.
Third baseman John Otness dropped
the biggest bomb on the Cardinal, col
lecting three hits with three RBIs, two
runs scored and a homer. Second
baseman Greg Isaacson and DH Matt
Lane each connected for two base hits
to add to the Huskies' assault.
The Cardinal has now lost seven of
its last 11 games against Washington
in Seattle, but maintains a large ad
vantage in the all-time series, 32-14.
Stanford returns home this week

morrow before embarking on an
other Pac-10 road trip, this time to
Tucson fora three-game series

fora game against Santa Clara to

other Pac-10 road trip, this time to
Tucson fora three-game series
against Arizona.
In April 2002. the Washington Huskies stunned the
Stanford baseball squad in Seattle, taking two of three
games as one pitcher, Shawn Kohn. picked up both victories
in the series.
Over the weekend at Husky Ballpark, No. 21 Washington
(28-15-1, 12-6 Pacific-10 Conference) shocked the top
ranked Cardinal (37-8,11-4) with a repeat of this trend.
After splitting the first two games — the Huskies came
away with a 3-2, 10-inning win on Friday while Stanford
collected a 7-2 Saturday victory — Washington drummed
up its best offensive contest of the weekend to win Sun
day's game, 9-2, and hand the Cardinal its first series loss of
the 2004 season.

Both wins improved the record of one hurler, Washington
ace Tim Lincecum. The freshman threw the final two frames
of Friday nights game and, on just one day's rest, tossed eight
strong innings yesterday afternoon.
The Cardinal turned in a wide spectrum of performances
beginning with a series start that featured a strong outing by
sophomore ace Mark Romanczuk. The lefty made getting
the stick on the ball tough for the Huskies, giving up only two
runs on six hits with eight strikeouts in a season-high nine in
nings of work.
Unfortunately for Stanford, Washington starter Kyle
Parker had the same kind of evening on the mound, giving up
two runs on five hits before surrendering his role to Lince
cum in the ninth.

The Stanford baseball team lost two out of three games this past weekend against Washington in Seattle. The
Huskies moved within a half game of the first place Cardinal in the Pacific-10 Conference standings.
The 10th frame was a reliever's
battle for the Pac-10 rivals, and, in the
end, Lincecum outdid Stanford's
freshman duo of Blake Holler and
Jeff Stimpson (who took the loss).
"I thought Romanczuk pitched
well," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "We just gave them
too much."
The rout was the Cardinal's first
extra-innings loss of the season.
While Friday's pitching was tight
and its hitting sparse, everything came
together for the Cardinal on Saturday.
Though sophomore starter Jeff
Gilmore faced a rough situation — he
was feeling sick the day of the game in
addition to having to deal with a 57-
minute rain delay in the fifth inning —
the righthander allowed only two runs
on six hits in his seven-inning stint.
"Every pitch was a battle uphill, es
pecially against these hitters,"
Gilmore said. "They're not so much a
groundball hitting team. They're
going to get the ball up in the air even
if you throw it down there, and fortu

nately I kept it low enough to keep the
ball in the yard."
Gilmore's outing gave the Stan
ford bats a chance to rev up — which
they did in typical Cardinal fashion.
Sophomore infielder Jed Lowrie led
the way with his 3-for-4 day at the
plate, as he became the first Stanford
player this season to hit three dou
bles in a game. Sophomore infielder
Chris Minaker also chipped in three
hits with an RBI, while senior center
fielder Sam Fuld and junior leftfield
er Danny Putnam — who was the
only Stanford player with multiple
hits on Friday — each posted a pair
of safeties.
Yesterday, though, the Cardinal
flailed while up against the arm of
Lincecum. Thirteen Stanford batters
went down on strikes in Lincecum s
eight innings, and though seven Car
dinal players collected base knocks
(Putnam was once again the only
batsman with more than one hit), the
team could not register timely hits in
the contest.
"We heard that [Lincecum] was
pretty wild," Putnam said. "But he
was throwing all three pitches for
strikes [yesterday]. Some of the guys
on the Washington team said he was
working on his change and he had his
change working all day. He was on
his game."

Only two home runs — one from
Putnam, one from junior designated
hitter Chris Carter — saved the Car
dinal from a shut out. The 9-2 decision
was the first time this season that Stan
ford lost by more than three runs.
Five Stanford pitchers tried to con
tain the Washington hitters: freshman
starter Greg Reynolds went 2 1 / 3 in
nings and gave up four runs before
stepping aside for Holler, freshman
Matt Leva, sophomore Matt Manship
and sophomore Kodiak Quick. Only
Quick was able to avoid giving up a
run or a hit.
Washington scored in each of the
first five frames, including a four-run
fifth that boosted its run total to nine.
Third baseman John Otness dropped
the biggest bomb on the Cardinal, col
lecting three hits with three RBIs, two
runs scored and a homer. Second
baseman Greg Isaacson and DH Matt
Lane each connected for two base hits
to add to the Huskies' assault.
The Cardinal has now lost seven of
its last 11 games against Washington
in Seattle, but maintains a large ad
vantage in the all-time series, 32-14.
