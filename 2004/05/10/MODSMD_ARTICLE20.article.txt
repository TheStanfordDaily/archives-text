# Stanford falls flat in rubber game
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
In April 2002. the Washington Huskies stunned the
Stanford baseball squad in Seattle, taking two of three
games as one pitcher, Shawn Kohn. picked up both victories
in the series.
Over the weekend at Husky Ballpark, No. 21 Washington
(28-15-1, 12-6 Pacific-10 Conference) shocked the top
ranked Cardinal (37-8,11-4) with a repeat of this trend.
After splitting the first two games — the Huskies came
away with a 3-2, 10-inning win on Friday while Stanford
collected a 7-2 Saturday victory — Washington drummed
up its best offensive contest of the weekend to win Sun
day's game, 9-2, and hand the Cardinal its first series loss of
the 2004 season.

Both wins improved the record of one hurler, Washington
ace Tim Lincecum. The freshman threw the final two frames
of Friday nights game and, on just one day's rest, tossed eight
strong innings yesterday afternoon.
The Cardinal turned in a wide spectrum of performances
beginning with a series start that featured a strong outing by
sophomore ace Mark Romanczuk. The lefty made getting
the stick on the ball tough for the Huskies, giving up only two
runs on six hits with eight strikeouts in a season-high nine in
nings of work.
Unfortunately for Stanford, Washington starter Kyle
Parker had the same kind of evening on the mound, giving up
two runs on five hits before surrendering his role to Lince
cum in the ninth.
