# Cardinal losses heat up Pac-10
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
The race for the Pacific-10 Conference
baseball title is a marathon, not a sprint.
With the finish line too far for worry and
too close for comfort, top-ranked Stan
ford suddenly has some uncomfortable
company breathing down its neck.
One week removed from a dominating
sweep of Washington State and winner of
five straight overall, Stanford (37-8, 11-4
Pac-10) traveled to Seattle with a golden
opportunity to gain a stranglehold on the
conference's top spot with a three-game
series against No. 21 Washington (28-15-
1, 12-6).
Leading the Huskies by 1 1/2 games,
the Cardinal would have been sitting
pretty heading home after a sweep at
Husky Ballpark and likely would have
been delighted even taking two-of-three
in the Northwest.
Instead, Stanford returned to campus
last night after suffering its most lopsided
loss of the season, 9-2, in the rubber game
of what turned out to be the first series
the Cardinal has dropped all season. Most
importantly, the gap separating Stanford
and Washington atop the Pac-10 stand
ings has dwindled to a mere half-game.
"It's an important series, but no more
important than last week or next week,"
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said
after the Cardinal evened the series with
a 7-2 win on Saturday.
Heading into the homestretch of the
Pac-10 race, though, the importance of
every remaining conference game is
magnified.
The Cardinal and Huskies are the pri
mary contenders for the title, with third
place UCLA (26-23,8-7) hanging around
and a logjam of teams — Arizona State,
Oregon State, Arizona and Southern
California — tied for fourth with identi
cal 7-8 records standing on the outside
looking in.
In its penultimate nonconference
game of the season, Stanford will
be home this week fora tune-up
tomorrow against pesky Santa
Clara, which gave the Cardinal
all it could handle in a 14-inning
game two weeks ago. Stanford
won that game, 12-8, and has
outscored the Broncos in three
wins this season, 42-15.
The heat will be turned up a
notch as the Cardinal travels to
Tucson, Ariz., fora three-game
series against the Wildcats that
begins Saturday rather than Fri
day to accommodate Arizona's
final-exam schedule.
Stanford dropped two-of
three to the Wildcats at Sunken
Diamond last year but won two
of-three when it visited Kindall
Field in 2002. That series includ
ed an 18-inning marathon in the
series opener, a 5-4 Stanford win.
Arizona (25-20-1, 7-8) is re
turning home after a nine-game
stretch of road games that saw
the Wildcats go 4-5. After drop

ping last weekend's series open
er to UCLA, 7-3, Arizona re
sponded to win the final two
games, 20-9 and 11-2, respective
ly, as sophomore John Meloan
tossed a complete-game two-hit
ter in the rubber game. The se
ries did not count toward either
team's conference record.
As for the Huskies, head
coach Ken Knutson's squad will
hit the road next weekend as
well. After playing host to Port
land on Tuesday and Wednes
day, the Diamond Dawgs head to
Los Angeles fora three-game set
against Southern California (21-
24, 7-8). The Huskies swept the
Trojans in Seattle last season, in
cluding a 26-2 drubbing in the se
ries opener. USC has been idle
since a 10-5 loss to San Diego
State on May 3 due to final
exams. Washington will wrap up
its Pac-10 slate one week later at
home against UCLA.
If the Cardinal can survive the
desert heat and remain in first
place after next weekend, it will
return home with the inside track
to a conference title. Stanford is
a remarkable 20-1 at Sunken Di
amond this season, including
sweeps of California and Wash
ington State in its two home con

ference series, and has won 29 of
its last 30 home games.
Stanford will play its last
seven regular season games of
the year at Sunken Diamond, in
cluding two conference series
against USC and Arizona State
(32-13, 7-8). The Cardinal took
two-of-three from the Trojans
earlier this season at Dedeaux
Field in nonconference action
and won two-of-three against the
Sun Devils last season.
Arizona State has won nine of
its last 11, including two games
against then-No. 10 Wichita
State to move back into the na
tional rankings at No. 20. The
Sun Devils, tabbed to finish sec
ond in the preseason coaches'
poll, have played just 10 games
away from home this season and
are 8-2 in those games.
Stanford is no stranger to
tight Pac-10 races. Last year's
squad did not clinch the Pac-10
title outright until its final con
ference game of the season, a
dramatic 9-8 win over UCLA. If
the Cardinal returns to the level
of play it has showcased all sea
son, this year's squad can sepa
rate itself from the rest of the
conference a little earlier this
time around.

ference series, and has won 29 of
its last 30 home games.
Stanford will play its last
seven regular season games of
the year at Sunken Diamond, in
cluding two conference series
against USC and Arizona State
(32-13, 7-8). The Cardinal took
two-of-three from the Trojans
earlier this season at Dedeaux
Field in nonconference action
and won two-of-three against the
Sun Devils last season.
Arizona State has won nine of
its last 11, including two games
against then-No. 10 Wichita
State to move back into the na
tional rankings at No. 20. The
Sun Devils, tabbed to finish sec
ond in the preseason coaches'
poll, have played just 10 games
away from home this season and
are 8-2 in those games.
Stanford is no stranger to
tight Pac-10 races. Last year's
squad did not clinch the Pac-10
title outright until its final con
ference game of the season, a
dramatic 9-8 win over UCLA. If
the Cardinal returns to the level
of play it has showcased all sea
son, this year's squad can sepa
rate itself from the rest of the
conference a little earlier this
time around.
The race for the Pacific-10 Conference
baseball title is a marathon, not a sprint.
With the finish line too far for worry and
too close for comfort, top-ranked Stan
ford suddenly has some uncomfortable
company breathing down its neck.
One week removed from a dominating
sweep of Washington State and winner of
five straight overall, Stanford (37-8, 11-4
Pac-10) traveled to Seattle with a golden
opportunity to gain a stranglehold on the
conference's top spot with a three-game
series against No. 21 Washington (28-15-
1, 12-6).
Leading the Huskies by 1 1/2 games,
the Cardinal would have been sitting
pretty heading home after a sweep at
Husky Ballpark and likely would have
been delighted even taking two-of-three
in the Northwest.
Instead, Stanford returned to campus
last night after suffering its most lopsided
loss of the season, 9-2, in the rubber game
of what turned out to be the first series
the Cardinal has dropped all season. Most
importantly, the gap separating Stanford
and Washington atop the Pac-10 stand
ings has dwindled to a mere half-game.
"It's an important series, but no more
important than last week or next week,"
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said
after the Cardinal evened the series with
a 7-2 win on Saturday.
Heading into the homestretch of the
Pac-10 race, though, the importance of
every remaining conference game is
magnified.
The Cardinal and Huskies are the pri
mary contenders for the title, with third
place UCLA (26-23,8-7) hanging around
and a logjam of teams — Arizona State,
Oregon State, Arizona and Southern
California — tied for fourth with identi
cal 7-8 records standing on the outside
looking in.
In its penultimate nonconference
game of the season, Stanford will
be home this week fora tune-up
tomorrow against pesky Santa
Clara, which gave the Cardinal
all it could handle in a 14-inning
game two weeks ago. Stanford
won that game, 12-8, and has
outscored the Broncos in three
wins this season, 42-15.
The heat will be turned up a
notch as the Cardinal travels to
Tucson, Ariz., fora three-game
series against the Wildcats that
begins Saturday rather than Fri
day to accommodate Arizona's
final-exam schedule.
Stanford dropped two-of
three to the Wildcats at Sunken
Diamond last year but won two
of-three when it visited Kindall
Field in 2002. That series includ
ed an 18-inning marathon in the
series opener, a 5-4 Stanford win.
Arizona (25-20-1, 7-8) is re
turning home after a nine-game
stretch of road games that saw
the Wildcats go 4-5. After drop

ping last weekend's series open
er to UCLA, 7-3, Arizona re
sponded to win the final two
games, 20-9 and 11-2, respective
ly, as sophomore John Meloan
tossed a complete-game two-hit
ter in the rubber game. The se
ries did not count toward either
team's conference record.
As for the Huskies, head
coach Ken Knutson's squad will
hit the road next weekend as
well. After playing host to Port
land on Tuesday and Wednes
day, the Diamond Dawgs head to
Los Angeles fora three-game set
against Southern California (21-
24, 7-8). The Huskies swept the
Trojans in Seattle last season, in
cluding a 26-2 drubbing in the se
ries opener. USC has been idle
since a 10-5 loss to San Diego
State on May 3 due to final
exams. Washington will wrap up
its Pac-10 slate one week later at
home against UCLA.
If the Cardinal can survive the
desert heat and remain in first
place after next weekend, it will
return home with the inside track
to a conference title. Stanford is
a remarkable 20-1 at Sunken Di
amond this season, including
sweeps of California and Wash
ington State in its two home con

ference series, and has won 29 of
its last 30 home games.
