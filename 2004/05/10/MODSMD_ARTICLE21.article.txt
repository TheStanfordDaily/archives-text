# Cardinal losses heat up Pac-10
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
The race for the Pacific-10 Conference
baseball title is a marathon, not a sprint.
With the finish line too far for worry and
too close for comfort, top-ranked Stan
ford suddenly has some uncomfortable
company breathing down its neck.
One week removed from a dominating
sweep of Washington State and winner of
five straight overall, Stanford (37-8, 11-4
Pac-10) traveled to Seattle with a golden
opportunity to gain a stranglehold on the
conference's top spot with a three-game
series against No. 21 Washington (28-15-
1, 12-6).
Leading the Huskies by 1 1/2 games,
the Cardinal would have been sitting
pretty heading home after a sweep at
Husky Ballpark and likely would have
been delighted even taking two-of-three
in the Northwest.
Instead, Stanford returned to campus
last night after suffering its most lopsided
loss of the season, 9-2, in the rubber game
of what turned out to be the first series
the Cardinal has dropped all season. Most
importantly, the gap separating Stanford
and Washington atop the Pac-10 stand
ings has dwindled to a mere half-game.
"It's an important series, but no more
important than last week or next week,"
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said
after the Cardinal evened the series with
a 7-2 win on Saturday.
Heading into the homestretch of the
Pac-10 race, though, the importance of
every remaining conference game is
magnified.
The Cardinal and Huskies are the pri
mary contenders for the title, with third
place UCLA (26-23,8-7) hanging around
and a logjam of teams — Arizona State,
Oregon State, Arizona and Southern
California — tied for fourth with identi
cal 7-8 records standing on the outside
looking in.
