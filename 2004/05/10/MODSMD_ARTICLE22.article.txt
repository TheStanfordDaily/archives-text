# Card upset in NCAA semis; finish season third
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Describing it as an unpleasant sur
prise can't describe the upset. It can't
be called a setback. Instead, try a dis
appointing shock.
That is exactly what Loyola Mary
mount (24-5) gave the Stanford
women's water polo team (20-5) and
the Cardinal fans Saturday night when
the Lions defeated Stanford, 5-4, at
Avery Aquatic Center in the NCAA
semifinal game. Stanford would later
defeat Hartwick College to claim third
place in the nation.
Stanford went into the national
championships, after claiming the at
large berth, with much confidence. Its
confidence was backed by its excellent
season, in which it had only suffered
losses against one team, top-ranked
Southern California (24-0), but had
otherwise dominated all others with
solid defense.
So what happened against LMU
can still seem confusing, because.
Stanford head coach John Tanner
said, the Cardinal had 40 percent
more shots and still came up short on
the scoreboard.
"It's about chance and great
plays and strange bounces," Tanner
said. "Our team had been riding on
this wave, feeling great with things
going our way. Yesterday, some
things didn't."
Things looked good for the Cardi
nal as it jumped to a 2-0 lead with goals
from sophomore driver Scotti Shafer
and freshman 2-meter Christina
Hewko. However, the Lions played
better in the second period and were
able to hold the Cardinal scoreless as
they shot ahead, 3-2.
In the third period, goals by Faust
and freshman driver Katie Hansen put
Stanford up, 4-3, but the fourth proved
pivotal. Stanford can count missed op
portunities, including a 6-on-5 and
penalty shot, as a factor in the loss. The
Cardinal was held scoreless while the
Lions came back to tie the game.

The shocking blow was dealt
at the last second, making the loss
all the more appalling for the Cardi
nal. With less than 30 seconds left,
LMU got a woman-up advantage.
Stacia Peterson lobbed the ball over
senior Wendy Watkins and fresh
man goalkeeper Meridith McColl
at the buzzer, leaving no chance for
the Cardinal to come back.
"I was wide open and didn't
want to go into overtime," said Pe
terson, whose team moved on to the
first NCAA championship game in
its history.
To win its consolation
game, Stanford had to switch
mentalities in order to play its
final season game in domination.
The Cardinal was successful as it
dominated Hartwick, 12-2, yes
terday afternoon.
"We're pleased to rebound
from yesterday's disappoint
ment and play at a high level,"
Tanner said.
The Cardinal got off to a
smoking start with eight goals that
went unanswered until the end of
the half. Senior driver Lauren
Faust got the first goal of the
match, followed quickly by sopho
more driver Laurel Champion. A
quick breakaway by Shafer gave
Stanford a 3-0 lead and freshman 2-
meter defender Alsion Gregorka
continued the dismantling of
Hartwick with her goal with 1:14
left in the first period. Faust scored
for the second time on a penalty
shot to round out the first with an
already outstanding 5-0 lead.
"We wanted to play our last
game of the season like the last
game," Faust said. "We put every
thing into the last game."
The shaky defense seen in
Saturday's game was gone yester
day. McColl provided good blocks
throughout the game and the rest
of the team held the Hawks score
less for the first and fourth peri
