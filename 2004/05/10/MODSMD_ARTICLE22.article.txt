# Card upset in NCAA semis; finish season third
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Describing it as an unpleasant sur
prise can't describe the upset. It can't
be called a setback. Instead, try a dis
appointing shock.
That is exactly what Loyola Mary
mount (24-5) gave the Stanford
women's water polo team (20-5) and
the Cardinal fans Saturday night when
the Lions defeated Stanford, 5-4, at
Avery Aquatic Center in the NCAA
semifinal game. Stanford would later
defeat Hartwick College to claim third
place in the nation.
Stanford went into the national
championships, after claiming the at
large berth, with much confidence. Its
confidence was backed by its excellent
season, in which it had only suffered
losses against one team, top-ranked
Southern California (24-0), but had
otherwise dominated all others with
solid defense.
So what happened against LMU
can still seem confusing, because.
Stanford head coach John Tanner
said, the Cardinal had 40 percent
more shots and still came up short on
the scoreboard.
"It's about chance and great
plays and strange bounces," Tanner
said. "Our team had been riding on
this wave, feeling great with things
going our way. Yesterday, some
things didn't."
Things looked good for the Cardi
nal as it jumped to a 2-0 lead with goals
from sophomore driver Scotti Shafer
and freshman 2-meter Christina
Hewko. However, the Lions played
better in the second period and were
able to hold the Cardinal scoreless as
they shot ahead, 3-2.
In the third period, goals by Faust
and freshman driver Katie Hansen put
Stanford up, 4-3, but the fourth proved
pivotal. Stanford can count missed op
portunities, including a 6-on-5 and
penalty shot, as a factor in the loss. The
Cardinal was held scoreless while the
Lions came back to tie the game.

The shocking blow was dealt
at the last second, making the loss
all the more appalling for the Cardi
nal. With less than 30 seconds left,
LMU got a woman-up advantage.
Stacia Peterson lobbed the ball over
senior Wendy Watkins and fresh
man goalkeeper Meridith McColl
at the buzzer, leaving no chance for
the Cardinal to come back.
"I was wide open and didn't
want to go into overtime," said Pe
terson, whose team moved on to the
first NCAA championship game in
its history.
To win its consolation
game, Stanford had to switch
mentalities in order to play its
final season game in domination.
The Cardinal was successful as it
dominated Hartwick, 12-2, yes
terday afternoon.
"We're pleased to rebound
from yesterday's disappoint
ment and play at a high level,"
Tanner said.
The Cardinal got off to a
smoking start with eight goals that
went unanswered until the end of
the half. Senior driver Lauren
Faust got the first goal of the
match, followed quickly by sopho
more driver Laurel Champion. A
quick breakaway by Shafer gave
Stanford a 3-0 lead and freshman 2-
meter defender Alsion Gregorka
continued the dismantling of
Hartwick with her goal with 1:14
left in the first period. Faust scored
for the second time on a penalty
shot to round out the first with an
already outstanding 5-0 lead.
"We wanted to play our last
game of the season like the last
game," Faust said. "We put every
thing into the last game."
The shaky defense seen in
Saturday's game was gone yester
day. McColl provided good blocks
throughout the game and the rest
of the team held the Hawks score
less for the first and fourth peri

ods. Things would not go the
Hawks' way, as many of their shots
were wide.
Hartwick's only scores came at
the end of the first half, when Carly
Strub lobbed one over the head of
McColl, and at the start of the sec
ond half with Sheri Johnson's low
shot into the right corner of the net.
"It was a tough one," said
Hartwick head coach Alan Huckins,
who also mentioned how tough the
season has been due to the threat of
Hartwick being demoted to Division
111. "Being here was the biggest bat
tle we had to fight all season."
As the game moved on, the goals
kept coming. Sophomore Nancy El-
Sakkary scored one of two goals
from two meters out, with an assist
from junior Kelty Luber. Faust led
the team with her third goal in the
third period and junior Hannah
Luber had a last-second goal.
Fresh minds aided in the win, as
Champion mentioned that the team
would play all-out "regardless of
what game it is".
The fourth quarter provided a
good time to transition the play
ers, as older ones gave way to
newer players.
While a final win is what the Car
dinal was searching for, it is still a bit

tersweet moment. Stanford had
been looking forward all year to
playing for the national title, espe
cially against USC. Now the Cardi
nal must look to the future.
Seniors Watkins, Faust and driv
er Shannon Averett played their
final game and their seasons didn't
end the way they had hoped for, but
the squad is already optimistic about
the next season.
"We have experience coming
back," Champion said.
In the championship match fol
lowing Stanford's win, USC beat
LMU, 10-8, to become the first na
tional champion to finish its season
with a perfect record.
While it could have been pre
dicted that the Trojans would win
their first NCAA title, after beating
Hartwick, 12-4, the previous day,
the close game was a nice surprise
to those who expected a USC
blowout. Cara Colton helped the
Lions out with four goals, including
back-to-back scores in the fourth to
bring her team within one score of
tying the match. LMU, however,
was never able to catch up to the
Trojans after the Trojans took the
lead in the first.
Brittany Hayes found the back
of the cage for the fourth time,
shooting from within seven meters
in the fourth period, to give the
Women of Troy an insurance goal.
The Trojans were able to hold off
LMU for the final minutes, leading
to a celebration in the pool, clothed
coaches and all.
