# Bruins bounce back from early season loss to beat Card
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When the No. 6 Cardinal Softball team
(41-15, 11-7 Pacific-10 Conference) defeat
ed No. 3 UCLA (36-9, 9-8) in Westwood
two weeks ago, the once top-ranked Bruins
were reeling, having lost six of their first
eight conference games. Since that game,
the Bruins have won seven of their last
eight games and have been playing like one
of the top teams in the country.
For the Cardinal, this spelled bad news,
as Stanford dropped both of its weekend
games versus the Bruins — 6-2 and 7-1, re
spectively — at home in conference play.
Although the Cardinal did win its Friday
game versus No. 8 Washington (35-13, 11-
5) by a 5-1 margin, the weekend was
soured by Saturday and yesterday's losses
to the Bruins.
The last loss was especially galling, as
Cardinal ace Dana Sorensen was in the cir
cle before a large home crowd on Senior
Day at Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadi
um. Sorensen never was able to find her
rhythm, though. With very few pitches on
the corners being called strikes, Sorensen
was forced to give the dangerous UCLA
lineup pitches to hit, and this proved to be
disastrous. Three Bruins hit towering
home runs to left field, including two back
to-back round trippers in a three-run sec
ond inning for UCLA.
While Sorensen seemed off-balance all
afternoon. Bruins ace Keira Goerl
cruised through Cardinal lineup, getting
ahead of Stanford hitters in almost every
at-bat. Stanford head coach John Rittman
bemoaned the lack of plate discipline by
his team.
"Goerl is awfully tough to hit when she's
on," Rittman said. "When Goerl is on —
and she definitely was [yesterday] — the

only way to hit her is to really wait and set on a
pitch. Today, we swung at a lot of first pitches and

were just pretty impatient. Instead of setting on a
pitch to hit, we were swinging at her pitches."

The Bruins relied on power hitting in their victo
ries over the Cardinal, hitting five home runs off

Stanford pitchers sophomore Laura Severson
and Sorensen this weekend. In Saturday's 6-2
loss to the Bruins, Severson allowed 10
baserunners and four runs in six innings to
take the loss. Sorensen was hit hard in relief
on Saturday in addition to yesterday's loss, al
lowing a total of nine runs in eight innings
against the Bruins.
Both pitchers got into trouble by giving up
walks and home runs against UCLA, but
Rittman was confident that both Severson and
Sorensen would regain their footing.
"The UCLA hitters hit a lot of home runs,
but Dana and Laura will bounce back,"
Rittman said. "They have shown remarkable
resilience all season, even after tough losses."
Friday's game against No. 8 Washington
went much better than the rest of the weekend
for the Cardinal, with Stanford taking a 5-1 vic
tory behind a complete game five-hitter by
Sorensen, who earned her 26th victory of the
year. Senior catcher Jessica Allister and junior
first baseman Leah Nelson each had an RBI for
the Cardinal, while junior Michelle Thiry dou
bled home two runs as a pinch hitter in the
fourth inning.
As far as the Cardinal's upcoming schedule,
Rittman stuck to his familiar mantra of focus
ing on the present.
"Right now, we are focused on Oregon for
Friday," he said. "We're going up to Eugene
Friday and hopefully we can just play our
game. Oregon is a very good team, so they're
our only focus for now."
The Cardinal will play both No. 10 Oregon
(35-14) and No. 17 Oregon State (39-21) on the
road this weekend to wrap up its Pac-10 season. If
Stanford can win just one of these three games,
this year will mark the Cardinal's best conference
record since the switch to a 21-game Pac-10 sched
ule in 2000. However, this weekend's losses to
UCLA exposed some weaknesses which can be

exploited by elite opponents, so there are many
improvements which need to be made to fine
tune the Cardinal before NCAA Regionals in two
weeks at Smith Family Stadium.
