# Political groups to debate at History Corner
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Students representing the major
political parties will go head-to
head tomorrow during the Campus
Political Group Battle Royale. Pre
sented by Stanford in Government,
the event will kick off at 7:30 p.m.
at the History Corner. The debate
will feature students from the Stan
ford Democrats, the College Re
publicans and the Greens at Stan
ford and will tackle a range of cur
rent issues.
"We are organizing this event
in order to allow students and
other community members to get
a glimpse at campus political
groups and the issues that are im
portant to them," said debate
moderator Aron Kirschner, a
sophomore. "We hope that those
who come might be inspired by
the issues being discussed."
Pairs of students representing

each group will deliver opening
and closing statements and field
questions pitched by the modera
tor. The issues discussed will in
clude both domestic and foreign
policy concerns, Kirschner said.
"The debate will primarily
contain national issues, but may
hit on some state issues as well,"
he added. "Foreign policy will
definitely be an important part of
the debate, including the current
situation in Iraq. As far as I know,
there has never been an event of
this type on campus."
Students participating in the
debate said they chose to throw
their hats into the ring because
they enjoy arguing with peers and
feel like they have knowledge to
share on relevant issues.
"College students are apathet
ic, and given the current political
climate, inaction is a privilege we
can no longer afford," said junior
Anne Friedman, who will repre

sent the Stanford Democrats.
"The next four years could mean
the reversal of Roe v. Wade and
reinstitution of the draft. These
are issues that matter both on
campus and off."
Junior Will Hudson, who will
represent the College Republi
cans, also expressed his hope
that the debate will reach stu
dents who don't follow the polit
ical scene.
"Stanford is fairly uneven in its
political landscape," he said. "On
the one hand there are a lot of stu
dents who talk about and who are
interested in politics, but if you're
just posting flyers or holding
protests it's all sort of impersonal
and unthinking. Debates are more
fun and a lot more productive
given the upcoming election than
just drawing lines in the middle of
White Plaza and having support
ers of the various candidates stand
in their respective boxes and

shout their tired slogans and accu
sations at one another."
Many of the debaters cited for
eign policy and national defense
as key issues they hope to address
during tomorrow's event.
"Our generation has no idea
how bad things can get," said Stan
ford Democrats representative
Kai Stinchcombe, a first-year grad
uate student in political science.
"We've never seen drafted young
people dying fora war America
can't win. We've never seen back
alley abortions going wrong.
We've never seen financial crisis or
international depression, which is
what we're going to get if we keep
running up the debt like this."
Hudson said he hopes to clear
up confusion related to America's
involvement in the Middle East,
especially Iraq, since this infor
mation is often misinterpreted.
"It's a poorly understood area
that doesn't receive much help

because politicians have to whit
tle down theories and policies
into easily digestible morsels," he
said. "If we could have a frank
discussion about it, I'd be happy."
As a representative of the
Stanford Greens, freshman
Daniel Herriges said he hopes to
broach issues of corporate domi
nation, environmental conserva
tion and fossil-fuel dependence.
While debaters will refer to the
candidates in the upcoming gen
eral election, several of them em
phasized that they will express
their own political views tomor
row, and not simply those of their
respective parties.
"I'm not interested in towing
the party line or rephrasing
White House press statements,"
Hudson said. "I think it'll also be
very apparent that Republicans
can have different ways of deal
ing with the same problems, and
while that may surprise some

people, it really shouldn't.
There's a lot of room for diversi
ty of thought and perspective."
In recent years, campus De
mocrats and Republicans have
clashed over a variety of issues
from war to employee rights, beg
ging the question whether this de
bate will spark hostilities between
the varied parties.
"There will be areas of differ
ence, to be sure," Hudson said. "No
doubt the Democrats and Greens
will have contrary perspectives
when it comes to tax cuts, for exam
ple, but in other areas I think you'll
see that we agree in a lot of ways."
While other candidates said
they didn't foresee conflict,
Stinchcombe said he predicted
a clash.
"We will wipe the floor with
Bob Sensenbrenner [the other
representative of the College Re
publicans], but we'll do it respect
fully," he said.
