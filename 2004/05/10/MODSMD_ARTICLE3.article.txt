# Council votes down Senate ruling on original election
## 
### ANDREW GAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During its meeting on Saturday, the ASSU Con
stitutional Council decided unanimously to reject
the ruling of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate to not
certify the original executive election. The opinion
stated that the Senate's decision violated the free
speech clause of the ASSU Constitution.
This ruling finalizes a decision the Council
reached on Tuesday.
According to the Council, free speech protects
the e-mails that were sent out in the original election
after the end-of-campaigning deadline in the Cam
paign Practice Code. The Senate will reexamine cer
tifying the original election and has been given in
structions not to consider the late e-mails.

Council Chair Bill Curry, a fourth-year geophysics
doctoral student, described the ruling as a straight
forward decision to uphold the ASSU Constitution.
"If the Senate overturns the election results it
should have a reason for that," Curry said. "That
reason should be constitutional. The only reason list
ed in the [Undergraduate Senate Meeting] minutes
was these three e-mails. E-mails are free speech and
protected by the ASSU Constitution. "
Curry said that before deciding to certify the elec
tion, the Undergraduate Senate received a packet
which included two previous Constitutional Council
cases, Towsner v. ASSU Elections Commission and
Hartke v. Young, which both designated e-mail to be
protected free speech in an election.
