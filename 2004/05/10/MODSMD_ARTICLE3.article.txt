# Council votes down Senate ruling on original election
## 
### ANDREW GAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During its meeting on Saturday, the ASSU Con
stitutional Council decided unanimously to reject
the ruling of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate to not
certify the original executive election. The opinion
stated that the Senate's decision violated the free
speech clause of the ASSU Constitution.
This ruling finalizes a decision the Council
reached on Tuesday.
According to the Council, free speech protects
the e-mails that were sent out in the original election
after the end-of-campaigning deadline in the Cam
paign Practice Code. The Senate will reexamine cer
tifying the original election and has been given in
structions not to consider the late e-mails.

Council Chair Bill Curry, a fourth-year geophysics
doctoral student, described the ruling as a straight
forward decision to uphold the ASSU Constitution.
"If the Senate overturns the election results it
should have a reason for that," Curry said. "That
reason should be constitutional. The only reason list
ed in the [Undergraduate Senate Meeting] minutes
was these three e-mails. E-mails are free speech and
protected by the ASSU Constitution. "
Curry said that before deciding to certify the elec
tion, the Undergraduate Senate received a packet
which included two previous Constitutional Council
cases, Towsner v. ASSU Elections Commission and
Hartke v. Young, which both designated e-mail to be
protected free speech in an election.
In the Council's official opinion
on Towsner v. The ASSU Elec
tions Commission, it declared that
the stipulation of narrow cam
paign periods in the Campaign
Practice Code was a clear abridge
ment of free speech.
The ASSU has no bylaws or
practices that disallow late e

mails due to this ruling, Curry
said. He added that the e-mails
were a violation of the Campaign
Practice Code, which is enforced
by the University.
The Senate will meet on Monday
to reconsider its decision to not cer
tify the election. If the Senate certi
fies the results of the original elec
tion. the outcome of the special elec
tion will remain undisclosed. If the
Senate chooses not to certify, bar
ring any further suits, the results of
the special election will be an
nounced as the 2(X)4-2005 ASSU ex
ecutive slate.
Last week, the Senate voted
against adding a fifth member —

graduate student Ying Wong — to
the Constitutional Council, which
would have made a split vote im
possible. The senate discussed this
bill in light of the recent suit
brought by Mefford.
According to several senators,
their decision to vote for Wong was
influenced by their knowledge off
Mefford's case — a split Council
vote of 2 to 2 would strike down the
Mefford suit.
The bill did not pass, which kept
the Council at its current four mem
bers, despite the support of the
council's chair.
"I think it is unfortunate that we
only had four members," Curry said.

"If it splits down the middle it fails,
so there is a predisposition to fail
with an even-numbered Council."
Curry acknowledged that spe
cial-election candidates' efforts
may have been rendered fruitless
by the Council's ruling, but he said
that the special election was the re
sult of an Senate decision that was
unconstitutional.
"The efforts of all the people
who ran in the general election
have been negated in an unfair
fashion," Curry said. "While it is
unfortunate that the special elec
tion sprouted from the Undergrad
uate Senate's decision, the vote was
made in bad faith."
