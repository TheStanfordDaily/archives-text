Stanford Law School Prof. Jennifer Martinez
is representing Jose Padilla, a USA PATRIOT
Act detainee, in a U.S. Supreme Court case that
pits national security against civil liberties.
For Martinez. Padilla's case is symbolic of
the larger push to check presidential authority.
"Never before in American history has the
president been given the unilateral right to im
prison." Martinez said. She added that customary
rights given to someone arrested, such as the
right to a lawyer and the right to remain silent,
"doesn't apply to Padilla."
Hamdi v. Rumsfeld and Rumsfeld v. Padilla
both bring into question presidential authority

over the limitless detainment of American citi

Supreme Court on April 28 — seek to challenge

"enemy combatants." American citizens Padilla
and Yaser Hamdi have been held under stipula
tions of the USA PATRIOT Act in a South Car
olina naval brig for an indefinite amount of time
without the right to see a lawyer or to hear the
charges against them.
Padilla was arrested at Chicago's O'Hare In
