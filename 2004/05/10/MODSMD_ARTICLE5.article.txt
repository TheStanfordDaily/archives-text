## 
### BEN WHALEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Bestselling author Isabel Allende will discuss
the immigrant experience and her book "My In
vented Country: A Nostalgic Journey Through
Chile" tonight at 7 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium,
and the immigrant experience in today's presi
dential and endowed lecture. Tomorrow she will
participate in an open-forum discussion at the
Humanities Center.
The book links two tragedies that occurred on
Sept. 11. The first was the military coup's over
throw of her uncle Salvador Allende's democrat
ically elected Chilean government in 1973. which
resulted in her forced immigration to America.
"Overnight 1 became a foreigner in my own
land, until finally 1 had to leave because I
couldn't live and bring up my children in a coun
try where terror reigned and where there was no
place for dissidents like myself," Allende said.
"1 waited for years to return once democracy
was restored."
The second event was the attack on the
World Trade Center, which, according to Al
lende, "scarred the national psyche of my
adoptive country."
Each year, a different University department
is given the opportunity to nominate a speaker for
the Presidential Lecture series. Past speakers
have included artist Maya Lin and scientist
Stephen Jay Gould; the Stanford Humanities
Center was responsible for this year's program.
Allende's lecture is also the first to be co-spon
sored by the ASSU.

"From the start. Presidential Lectures have as
pired to a global perspective." said John Bender,
the director of the Stanford Humanities Center.
"Isabel Allende's appearance will enhance this
crucial dimension of the series."
He noted. "Speakers are asked to address, di
rectly or indirectly, the question of the future of
the humanities and arts in higher education from
the perspective of your own discipline, your own
current work, even your own biography."
Allende was born in Lima, Peru in 1942. Be
cause her parents were diplomats, Allende trav
eled frequently during her childhood and moved
between her native Chile, Europe, Lebanon and
Bolivia. After the overthrow of her uncle. Al
lende lived in exile in Caracas, Venezuela. In 1987
she moved to the United States and settled in
northern California to begin writing.
She actually began writing her first book while
in exile. The work was to become a "spiritual let
ter" to her dying grandfather in the form of "La
Casa de los Espiritus" or "The House of Spirits."
Published in Spanish in 1982, the book was soon
translated into French, German and English. It
became a worldwide bestseller, launching Al
lende's career as one of Latin America's pre
miere authors.
Since then she has penned 13 books in a range
of genres. While it is true that Allende has written
novels known for their strong female protagonists
such as "Eva Luna" and "Daughter of Fortune,"
she has also written a collection of short stories
and fantasy fiction for children and young adults.


Bestselling author Isabel Allende will be speaking about her new book today and participating in an open forum discus
sion group at the Stanford Humanities Center tomorrow.
"In every interview during the
last few years I encountered two
questions that forced me to define
myself as a writer and human being:
Why do I write? And who do I write
for?" Allende said. "In the process
of writing the anecdotes of the past,
and recalling emotions and pains of
my fate, and telling part of the his-

Tory of my country, I found life be
came more tolerable. Maybe the
most important reason for writing is
to prevent the erosion of time, so
that memories will not be blown
away by the wind. Write to register
history, and name each thing. Write
what should not be forgotten."
By 1998,30 million copies of Al
lende's books in over 27 languages
were in circulation.
"Isabel Allende is a marvelous
writer whose profound knowledge
both of Latin America and North
America establishes her as a writer
of the Americas in the largest
sense," Bender said.
