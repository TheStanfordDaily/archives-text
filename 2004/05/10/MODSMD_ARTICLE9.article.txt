## What in the world is our nation doing? 
### PROF. DOUGLAS OSHEROFF DEPT. OF PHYSICS 
When President Bush began pushing for the invasion of Iraq in the fall of
2002, the justification was that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass de
struction that threatened our national security. No such weapons have ever
been found, despite a year of occupation by U.S. forces. It is clear that Iraq
posed no imminent threat to the United States, and thus that there was no jus
tification for the invasion.
Why, then, did President Bush push so hard for the invasion of Iraq, even
to the point of alienating most of our allies from Desert Storm and leaving
the United States to shoulder nearly the entire burden of establishing a

peaceful and stable Iraq in the absence of its despotic lead
er? Was the timetable perhaps driven by the 2004 presi
dential election? Why has the administration been so re
luctant to share control of post-war Iraq with other nations
that might assist in the process of re-building the country
and its government? Could it be the desire by the Bush
Administration to control the Iraqi oil?
Very plausible answers to these questions can be found if one
studies documents from and regarding the Project For The New
American Century 1 (PNAC). Google the letters PN AC you can
learn a lot more. Start with the article by Bernard Weiner.
The PNAC, formed in the spring of 1997 by a group of
neo-conservative strategists, has proposed a very aggres-

o ■. I j — ~~J - OC
sive U.S. world strategy. Its authors included Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld
and a number of other members of the present Bush Administration.
Paul Wolfowitz, a member of this group, suggested' as early as 1992 that
the United States, as the only remaining super power, should exert its military
and economic might to preserve its position of world power and to secure its
national interests, including its access to Middle East oil. Bush has adopted
much of this strategy in his foreign policy" 1 .
This new foreign policy gives the United States a green light to impose its
will throughout the world by economic and/or military means. It is assumed
that we are always right, and that our way of living is best for all people. It is
a stark departure from the benign foreign policy of the Clinton White House.
A similar doctrine would have rationalized Germany's invasion of Poland
and its subsequent conquest of most of the rest of Europe during World War
11. These are not obscure documents, yet most people in this country haven't
even heard of PNAC.
Why is the statement of such an important and dangerous new policy al
most totally ignored by the popular media? I have no clear answer to this
question, but most possibilities seem very sobering indeed.
Regardless what the Bush administration's rational was for invading Iraq,
it vastly underestimated the hatred that many Iraqis feel for the United States,
for its 15 years of imposed economic hardship, the killing of tens of thousands
of Iraqis in two lopsided wars and the present occupation, and now for the hu
miliating treatment of Iraqi detainees by some of the U.S. forces there.
To the Iraqis we must appear as ogres or barbarians. Muslim extremists
have now united, and are willing to wage a long war of attrition with their in
vader to take control. The United States has already lost more soldiers in the
occupation of Iraq than in the war itself, and the burden on our brave fighting
troops has been great. The road to peace seems long and perilous.
However, to leave Iraq to the extremists would be to leave Iraq and the en
tire Middle East much less stable politically than it was before the invasion. In
short, the Bush administration has committed this country to a long and cost
ly struggle. The only comforting thought in all this is that it may force the Bush
administration to re-think its Middle East policy of conquest.
How has the Bush administration been able to alter longstanding U.S. for
eign policy so abruptly and to such an extreme position? Part of the answer to
this question lies in the paranoia following 9/11. Criticizing the president and
his policies is suddenly considered to border on treason. New laws enacted to
control the terrorist threat can also threaten those who oppose the govern
ment and its new policies.
The real or perceived erosion of civil liberties may ultimately become
more dangerous to our way of life than any potential foreign aggressor. In
deed, the free and open discourse that has made this nation great has been sti
fled. Democracy is not dormant, but its voice has been muffled.
It is time that the citizens of our nation begin to openly debate its future.
The most important voice in our great land is the voice of the people on elec
tion day. I urge that the citizens of this country all vote on Nov. 4, and make
their choices based on a firm understanding of the issues which face us.
