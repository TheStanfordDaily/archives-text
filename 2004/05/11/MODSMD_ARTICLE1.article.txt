# Senate again refuses to certify election
## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate voted last night to
not certify last month's executive election fora second
time, this time alleging that e-mails sent to the Class of
2004 group list endorsing the Lee / Mefford ticket rep
resented an abuse of power by senior Mikey Lee, who at
the time was a Senior Class president. With last week's
special-election results stil 1 secret and junior Dylan Mef
ford contemplating filing a new suit with the Constitu
tional Council, the Senate's decision throws into serious
doubt who will assume executive responsibilities for the
ASSU next year.
The final vote was four in favor of certification, ten op
posed and one abstaining. The senators opposed to certi
fication met after the meeting to draft an official opinion.
"We found that an abuse of power led to an avoid
able and influential deviation," the statement read. "In

this case, a candidate actively sought the endorsement
of the Senior Class presiding body with the intent that
they use their Senior Class president status to endorse
that candidate's slate to an unsolicited body with invol
untary membership."
Despite the resounding majority decision, there were
dissenting voices within the Senate. Freshman Omar
Shakir, who voted for certification, argued that whatev
er improprieties occurred did not merit overturning the
original election results.
"I felt the result of the original election would have
been the same regardless of the violations," he said.
"I am concerned that not certifying will set a danger
ous precedent that the voice of over 4,000 students
should be trumped by a weak standard that could justi
fy the non-certification of almost every election in
ASSU history," Shakir added.
Before deliberations began on the issue of certifica
tion, Constitutional Council Chair Bill Curry, a doctor

al candidate in geophysics, read from last week's Coun
cil decision regarding the free-speech clause in the
ASSU Constitution.
"The Council reminds the Undergraduate Senate
that constitutional reasons must be provided for not cer
tifying an election, and that votes cannot be based on is
sues that are protected by Article I, Section 3, Clause 2
of the ASSU Constitution," he read.
Some senators, however, expressed doubt that they
had to necessarily abide by the Council's decision.
"It is a decision that we have," said sophomore
Dan Stringer.
Throughout the meeting, a host of individuals
chimed in with opinions, ranging from former senators,
current ASSU President Nadiya Figueroa, current Vice
President Joey Natoli and friends of Lee and Mefford,
to unidentified interested parties.
"4,020 people voted of their own free will," Mef
ford said. "I think that's an overwhelming argument

for certification."
Lee / Mefford supporters, despite their sparse num
bers, made their voices heard.
"It isn't your place to go back and second guess [the
voters]," said junior Jimmy Olujmi.
The mood of the meeting was anything but cordial,
however, as both senators and spectators sniped at Lee
and his supporters.
"What fraternity are you in?" junior Josh Shipp, a
former Senate chair, asked Olujmi.
When Olujmi replied that he was in Sigma Nu, Shipp
asked Lee the same question, inciting laughter from the
audience and eye-rolls from the Lee contingent.
Others at the meeting could barely conceal their neg
ative opinions of Lee.
"A lot of us have this sentiment that something went
wrong, but we don't know how to put our finger on it,"
said freshman Adia Gooden.
Several senators seemed to
search for reasons to not certify last
month's election results.
"Does anybody know of any valid
reason the Undergraduate Senate
could use to not certify the elec
tion?" sophomore Adrian Boscolo-
Hightower asked his fellow senators.
Both Gooden and Boscolo-High
tower later voted against validating
the election results.
Junior Matthew Henick, The
Stanford Chaparral slate's vice pres
idential candidate and ASSU publi

cations director, offered a potential
reason. He argued that the endorse
ment of the Lee / Mefford ticket by
the Senior Class presidents repre
sented an "abuse of power."
Shipp agreed, stating, "The Se
nior Class presidents knew the im
pact this would have."
Lee vented his frustrations with the
Senate after the meeting dispersed.
"I feel that tonight's decision was
an attempt to find a way to circum
vent the ruling of the Constitutional
Council,"he said." Abuse of power'
is what the Senate came up with."
He added, "1 think that it'scomplete
ly ridiculous, since 'abuse of power' does
not exist in the Constitution."
Henick expressed a more positive
view of last night's decision.
"I think the Senate is doing every

thing in their power to make the right
decision and restore the ASSU's in
tegrity," he said.
It is likely that the Senate's rea
sons for not certifying the election
results will again go before the Con
stitutional Council.
"I would expect to [bring a new
case)," Mefford said after the meeting.
If a new case is brought to the
Council and is rejected, the spe
cial-election winners will likely
be announced. Curry explained.
However, if the Council strikes
down last night's Senate decision
again. Curry is uncertain what
will happen.
"All I know is, I want a raise," he
said, before rounding up interested
parties and heading to the Coffee
House for beer.

cial-election winners will likely
be announced. Curry explained.
However, if the Council strikes
down last night's Senate decision
again. Curry is uncertain what
will happen.
"All I know is, I want a raise," he
said, before rounding up interested
parties and heading to the Coffee
House for beer.
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate voted last night to
not certify last month's executive election fora second
time, this time alleging that e-mails sent to the Class of
2004 group list endorsing the Lee / Mefford ticket rep
resented an abuse of power by senior Mikey Lee, who at
the time was a Senior Class president. With last week's
special-election results stil 1 secret and junior Dylan Mef
ford contemplating filing a new suit with the Constitu
tional Council, the Senate's decision throws into serious
doubt who will assume executive responsibilities for the
ASSU next year.
The final vote was four in favor of certification, ten op
posed and one abstaining. The senators opposed to certi
fication met after the meeting to draft an official opinion.
"We found that an abuse of power led to an avoid
able and influential deviation," the statement read. "In

this case, a candidate actively sought the endorsement
of the Senior Class presiding body with the intent that
they use their Senior Class president status to endorse
that candidate's slate to an unsolicited body with invol
untary membership."
Despite the resounding majority decision, there were
dissenting voices within the Senate. Freshman Omar
Shakir, who voted for certification, argued that whatev
er improprieties occurred did not merit overturning the
original election results.
"I felt the result of the original election would have
been the same regardless of the violations," he said.
"I am concerned that not certifying will set a danger
ous precedent that the voice of over 4,000 students
should be trumped by a weak standard that could justi
fy the non-certification of almost every election in
ASSU history," Shakir added.
Before deliberations began on the issue of certifica
tion, Constitutional Council Chair Bill Curry, a doctor

al candidate in geophysics, read from last week's Coun
cil decision regarding the free-speech clause in the
ASSU Constitution.
"The Council reminds the Undergraduate Senate
that constitutional reasons must be provided for not cer
tifying an election, and that votes cannot be based on is
sues that are protected by Article I, Section 3, Clause 2
of the ASSU Constitution," he read.
Some senators, however, expressed doubt that they
had to necessarily abide by the Council's decision.
"It is a decision that we have," said sophomore
Dan Stringer.
Throughout the meeting, a host of individuals
chimed in with opinions, ranging from former senators,
current ASSU President Nadiya Figueroa, current Vice
President Joey Natoli and friends of Lee and Mefford,
to unidentified interested parties.
"4,020 people voted of their own free will," Mef
ford said. "I think that's an overwhelming argument

for certification."
Lee / Mefford supporters, despite their sparse num
bers, made their voices heard.
"It isn't your place to go back and second guess [the
voters]," said junior Jimmy Olujmi.
The mood of the meeting was anything but cordial,
however, as both senators and spectators sniped at Lee
and his supporters.
"What fraternity are you in?" junior Josh Shipp, a
former Senate chair, asked Olujmi.
When Olujmi replied that he was in Sigma Nu, Shipp
asked Lee the same question, inciting laughter from the
audience and eye-rolls from the Lee contingent.
Others at the meeting could barely conceal their neg
ative opinions of Lee.
"A lot of us have this sentiment that something went
wrong, but we don't know how to put our finger on it,"
said freshman Adia Gooden.
Several senators seemed to
search for reasons to not certify last
month's election results.
"Does anybody know of any valid
reason the Undergraduate Senate
could use to not certify the elec
tion?" sophomore Adrian Boscolo-
Hightower asked his fellow senators.
Both Gooden and Boscolo-High
tower later voted against validating
the election results.
Junior Matthew Henick, The
Stanford Chaparral slate's vice pres
idential candidate and ASSU publi

cations director, offered a potential
reason. He argued that the endorse
ment of the Lee / Mefford ticket by
the Senior Class presidents repre
sented an "abuse of power."
Shipp agreed, stating, "The Se
nior Class presidents knew the im
pact this would have."
Lee vented his frustrations with the
Senate after the meeting dispersed.
"I feel that tonight's decision was
an attempt to find a way to circum
vent the ruling of the Constitutional
Council,"he said." Abuse of power'
is what the Senate came up with."
He added, "1 think that it'scomplete
ly ridiculous, since 'abuse of power' does
not exist in the Constitution."
Henick expressed a more positive
view of last night's decision.
"I think the Senate is doing every

thing in their power to make the right
decision and restore the ASSU's in
tegrity," he said.
It is likely that the Senate's rea
sons for not certifying the election
results will again go before the Con
stitutional Council.
"I would expect to [bring a new
case)," Mefford said after the meeting.
If a new case is brought to the
Council and is rejected, the spe
cial-election winners will likely
be announced. Curry explained.
