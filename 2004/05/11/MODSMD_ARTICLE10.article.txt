# FROM DISTRESS TO DE-STRESS: The science behind stress

I'm sure you're familiar with the sleep de
prived,fast-paced, heart-racing schedule of

Stanford students. Whether
you're doing 15 different
extra-curricular activities,
problem sets that never
seem to end and getting
your sleep down to "twen
ties" or "thirties," our jam
packed to-do lists can
be pretty daunting. A
friend and fellow Stanford
student went so far as call
ing us neurotic.

That's part of the reason why Stanford
held an SOS — Stressed Out Students —
conference on campus for 15 different local
high schools in San Mateo and Santa Clara
County. Sponsored by the School of Educa
tion and the Lucile Packard Foundation for
Children's Health, the conference was orga
nized to promote a less academically stress
ful and more relaxed mindset for future col
lege students. Parents, teachers and princi
pals also gained insight into reducing stress
ful situations in school.
The $75,000 effort was a necessary step in
combating the taxing lifestyle that many
Stanford students put on themselves.

According to local reports, in 2002, near
ly twice as many students sought help for
managing drugs at the University health cen
ter for psychiatric problems than they did in
the year 2000. Even more upsetting, an in
creasing number of Stanford students are
being hospitalized, taking antidepressants
and considering suicide.
The adverse effects of stress on the body
have been well documented. During a
stressful situation, your body produces addi
tional adrenaline, causing your to heart to
beat faster, your breathing to become shal
lower and your digestive system and im
mune system to be inhibited. These respons
es are generally adaptive when we're facing
a threat, but after prolonged activation,
stress can disrupt the body's internal bal
ance (known as homeostasis).
The real problem emerges when the
mechanisms we use to keep us alert and ac
tive don't work correctly. According to on
line Web Doctors Bruce McEwen, Ph.D.,
and Dean Krahn, M.D, there are several
ways in which the body's homeostasis is al
tered: The body returns to its normal state
after the stressful event has passed, the
body become over-aroused to stress or the
body becomes under-aroused to stress. The
price we pay, over-use or under-use, is
known as the "allostatic load" we place on
the body.
Abnormal allostatic loads put the body

under serious strain. During an over-active
response to stress, increasing secretions of
Cortisol, the "stress hormone," produce ele

vated blood sugar levels, a condition known
as hyperglycemia. This can cause insulin, a
hormone utilized to direct glucose into the
body's cells, to be downregulated — the
pancrease can cease its production of insulin
or cells are no longer able to respond to in
sulin. As a result, after prolonged periods of
elevated blood sugar levels, stress hyperac
tivity can cause the onset of Type 2 Diabetes,
a disease caused by insulin resistance and a
defect in the production of insulin.
The advent of hyperglycemia and hy
perinsulinemia (too much insulin in the
blood) due to stress can lead to high blood
pressure and increasing levels of LDL
(bad) cholesterol. HDL (good) cholesterol
can also drop, which may cause the arteries
to harden faster, a condition known as ar
teriosclerosis. This is the primary cause of
heart attacks.
Chronic stress also plays a role in reduc
ing our spatial and verbal memories. During
abnormal allostatic loads, the excitability of
certain nerve cells is impaired, and neurons
in the hippocampus (the memory-center in
our brain) are atrophied.
Abnormal allostatic loads that turn off
the body's stress responses also have serious
consequences. The absence of Cortisol circu
lating throughout the body causes certain in
flammatory agents in our immune system
(that are usually cortisol-contained) to be
come hyperactive. These agents will then

begin attacking our own body, known as an
autoimmune response, which leads to dam
age in our internal cellular environment.
Stress also has a negative influence on our
emotions. A study by the British Journal of
Psychiatry two years ago found that men and
women with demanding jobs and low social
support tended to have higher levels of de
pression than their co-workers.
Reducing our level of stress isn't as easy
as it sounds. Many of us try to de-stress by
using pick-me-ups, i.e. substances that give
our brain a brief sense of respite and relax
ation. Though they offer relief, there are
other ways to establish permanent lower
stress levels. At the top of the list, should be
learning how to say "no." Appreciate the
time you have with friends and family, and
most importantly, enjoy having time for
yourself. Sometimes I think the most im
portant times in our lives are when we can
just chill and relax.
Spring quarter is halfway done and we
have a little more than one month left. The
weather is beautiful and the days are sunny
and bright. Take some time off, enjoy the
end of this hectic school year and get some
real sleep this time.

as it sounds. Many of us try to de-stress by
using pick-me-ups, i.e. substances that give
our brain a brief sense of respite and relax
ation. Though they offer relief, there are
other ways to establish permanent lower
stress levels. At the top of the list, should be
learning how to say "no." Appreciate the
time you have with friends and family, and
most importantly, enjoy having time for
yourself. Sometimes I think the most im
portant times in our lives are when we can
just chill and relax.
Spring quarter is halfway done and we
have a little more than one month left. The
weather is beautiful and the days are sunny
and bright. Take some time off, enjoy the
end of this hectic school year and get some
real sleep this time.

I'm sure you're familiar with the sleep de
prived,fast-paced, heart-racing schedule of

Stanford students. Whether
you're doing 15 different
extra-curricular activities,
problem sets that never
seem to end and getting
your sleep down to "twen
ties" or "thirties," our jam
packed to-do lists can
be pretty daunting. A
friend and fellow Stanford
student went so far as call
ing us neurotic.

That's part of the reason why Stanford
held an SOS — Stressed Out Students —
conference on campus for 15 different local
high schools in San Mateo and Santa Clara
County. Sponsored by the School of Educa
tion and the Lucile Packard Foundation for
Children's Health, the conference was orga
nized to promote a less academically stress
ful and more relaxed mindset for future col
lege students. Parents, teachers and princi
pals also gained insight into reducing stress
ful situations in school.
The $75,000 effort was a necessary step in
combating the taxing lifestyle that many
Stanford students put on themselves.

According to local reports, in 2002, near
ly twice as many students sought help for
managing drugs at the University health cen
ter for psychiatric problems than they did in
the year 2000. Even more upsetting, an in
creasing number of Stanford students are
being hospitalized, taking antidepressants
and considering suicide.
The adverse effects of stress on the body
have been well documented. During a
stressful situation, your body produces addi
tional adrenaline, causing your to heart to
beat faster, your breathing to become shal
lower and your digestive system and im
mune system to be inhibited. These respons
es are generally adaptive when we're facing
a threat, but after prolonged activation,
stress can disrupt the body's internal bal
ance (known as homeostasis).
The real problem emerges when the
mechanisms we use to keep us alert and ac
tive don't work correctly. According to on
line Web Doctors Bruce McEwen, Ph.D.,
and Dean Krahn, M.D, there are several
ways in which the body's homeostasis is al
tered: The body returns to its normal state
after the stressful event has passed, the
body become over-aroused to stress or the
body becomes under-aroused to stress. The
price we pay, over-use or under-use, is
known as the "allostatic load" we place on
the body.
Abnormal allostatic loads put the body

under serious strain. During an over-active
response to stress, increasing secretions of
Cortisol, the "stress hormone," produce ele

vated blood sugar levels, a condition known
as hyperglycemia. This can cause insulin, a
hormone utilized to direct glucose into the
body's cells, to be downregulated — the
pancrease can cease its production of insulin
or cells are no longer able to respond to in
sulin. As a result, after prolonged periods of
elevated blood sugar levels, stress hyperac
tivity can cause the onset of Type 2 Diabetes,
a disease caused by insulin resistance and a
defect in the production of insulin.
The advent of hyperglycemia and hy
perinsulinemia (too much insulin in the
blood) due to stress can lead to high blood
pressure and increasing levels of LDL
(bad) cholesterol. HDL (good) cholesterol
can also drop, which may cause the arteries
to harden faster, a condition known as ar
teriosclerosis. This is the primary cause of
heart attacks.
Chronic stress also plays a role in reduc
ing our spatial and verbal memories. During
abnormal allostatic loads, the excitability of
certain nerve cells is impaired, and neurons
in the hippocampus (the memory-center in
our brain) are atrophied.
Abnormal allostatic loads that turn off
the body's stress responses also have serious
consequences. The absence of Cortisol circu
lating throughout the body causes certain in
flammatory agents in our immune system
(that are usually cortisol-contained) to be
come hyperactive. These agents will then

begin attacking our own body, known as an
autoimmune response, which leads to dam
age in our internal cellular environment.
Stress also has a negative influence on our
emotions. A study by the British Journal of
Psychiatry two years ago found that men and
women with demanding jobs and low social
support tended to have higher levels of de
pression than their co-workers.
