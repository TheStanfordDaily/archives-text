## Shame on you, senators 
### 
Last night's decision to not certify April's
ASSU executive election proved beyond a
reasonable doubt the Undergraduate Sen
ate's incompetence as an elected body. Its
decision was based on obscure reasoning, and it
seems obvious that senators were searching for an
excuse to not certify. With its decision, senators have
effectively taken power out of the voters' hands and
claimed it for themselves. They have overturned the
popular vote for no valid reason.
When asked by The Daily about the reasoning
behind their "nay" votes, dissenting senators de
clined to explain, saying they would respond after
they had conferred with the other senators who had
voted against confirming the election. This raises the
question of why they had voted at all if they were un
sure of the reasons behind their decisions. Maybe
they were unprepared to defend their viewpoints. Or
perhaps the reasons for their votes were not some
thing they wanted to see attached to their names, and
they desired more time to think of a better rationale.
Further, the debate regarding "abuse of power" in
April's election is ludicrous. The Senate decided that
Mikey Lee, as Senior Class president at the time of
the Senior Class presidents' endorsement of the Lee /
Mefford slate, abused his power. However, Lee de
nies writing the endorsement e-mail, and it is ques
tionable whether or not he directly used his power to
forcibly bring about the endorsement. Even if he had,
neither the ASSU Constitution nor the Campaign
Practice Protocol condemns power abuse, so this ar
gument is flawed and probably unconstitutional.
Of course, the Lee-Mefford slate is far from irre
proachable. Lee and Dylan Mefford did commit
campaign protocol infractions and engaged in ques
tionable political actions (such as Lee's switch from
Mefford to Alyssa Schwartz as running mate for the
second election). However, nothing they did was suf-

ficient grounds for overturning the election in the
opinion of numerous ASSU and election officials.
It appears that the Senate was seeking a reason to
reject an election that selected a slate with which it was
not happy. The Elections Commission recommended
last month that the election he certified. Then, when
the election was rejected on campaign practice viola
tions, the Constitutional Council deemed this justifi
cation for rejection unconstitutional. Essentially,
then, it seemed a certainty that the Senate should and
would certify April's election last night.
The Senate, however, did not follow the logical
path, instead citing cryptic arguments. At times, it
seemed senators had personal vendettas against Lee
and were looking for any way to not certify the elec
tion. Even if private interest is not the reason for sen
ators' votes, it is inexcusable for them to vote on such
an important issue without a stronger explanation.
Campus sentiment toward the ASSU is decidedly
negative, and the elections controversies of the past
month have done nothing to improve the organiza
tion's image among students. Students have every
right to he fed up with the election and to be angry
with the ASSU for unnecessarily drawing out this
whole debacle. The ASSU only further alienated it
sell from students last night. By deciding yet again to
go against the popular vote and to continue the elec
tions delay, the ASSU has indicated its disregard for
what the majority of students want.
Another suit may be brought against the ASSU as
a result of last night's decision. While this second suit
only reiterates the bizarreness of the whole situa
tion, we think it is necessary. The ASSU must be
held accountable to a higher organization for its ac
tions. If legal counsel must be sought to knock some
sense into the ASSU, so be it — at least then the law,
and not the bungling ASSU. will make the ultimate
elections decision.
