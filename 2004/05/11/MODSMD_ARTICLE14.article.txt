## Cardinal Care costs raise questions 
### JAMES METCALF 
I read with dismay the announce
ment in Friday's Daily that Cardinal
Care premiums will jump another 20
percent for the 2(XW-2005 academic
year ("Cardinal Care costs jump," May
7). According to the Cardinal Care
Web site, reasons behind the increase
are "factors like increases in hospital
and physician prices, the rising use of
promising but expensive medical tech
nology and the growing use of new,
more expensive prescription drugs."
While all of these assertions hold merit,
they do not necessarily apply to Stan
ford's situation. Instead, they should
state the truth, which is that Cardinal
Care rates are rising by 20 percent be
cause low-cost health care is not a pri
ority for the University.
First, it is definitely true that there
have been increases in hospital and
physician fees, but has Stanford forgot
ten that it owns the hospital? It sets the
fees and then complains they are too
high. The vast majority of students on
the health care plan receive all of their
services from some combination of
Vaden and the Stanford Hospital. You
would think that this would make lower
rates for Cardinal Care members much
more probable than plans which must
negotiate with outside hospitals and
service providers.
Second, the support of promising
but expensive medical technology
does play a role in raising rates; how
ever. I am curious what kind of tech
nologies and treatments they are dis
cussing. If the equipment and treat
ments in question are primarily used
for ailments and conditions more
commonly occurring later in life, then
they do not necessarily pertain to the
average Cardinal Care member. The
vast majority of people on Cardinal
Care are young and relatively healthy.

not exactly the demographic that has
a high incidence of serious or long
term illnesses, nor are most of us at a
stage in our life where degenerative
diseases are very probable. Most of us
need insurance for regular checkups
and the occasional freak accident;
very few of us require any intensive
long-term care.
Finally, the assertion that our insur
ance premiums must increase because
of more expensive prescription drugs
fails for the same reason as the "new
and expensive advancements in ex
pensive medical technology" argu
ment. 1 am sure that some students
have expensive medications, but since
students tend to belong to one of the
healthiest groups of people, these situ
ations are probably rare. I will volun
teer that if the cost of my prescriptions
is the reason that my premium had to
increase 40 percent over the past two
years then why not just raise my co
payment? I am sure that new drugs are
expensive, but how many are actually
applicable to the average student in his
20s or 30s?
Let me be clear, I am not arguing
that the cost of medical services has not
increased, but that the reasons present
ed by Cardinal Care are flawed. Health
insurance premiums are increasing be
cause low-cost health care is not a pri
ority for the University. If it were pure
ly a factor of the Bay Area, then you
would expect other local colleges and
universities to have similar costs for
their students. UC-Berkeley, however,
has somehow managed to keep their
rates at less than $1,000 per year ($916
for graduate students and $774 for un
dergraduates), and that includes dental
coverage. Although their prices have
increased, they are still significantly less
expensive that the Cardinal Care plan,
and they don't even own a hospital.
Looking at other local universities and

colleges such as San Francisco State,
San Jose State, Santa Clara University
and Mills College, you are hard
pressed to find any other student plan
that is close to the cost of Cardinal Care.
Somehow, other public and private
schools manage to keep costs down, but
here that is not the case. In fact, our un
subsidized premiums are now more ex
pensive than comparable plans offered
by HMOs such as Kaiser Permanente.
This is not what you would expect from
low cost student health.
This being said, I still consider my
self lucky. My department has thank
fully helped cover the rising costs over
the past few years. Who knows, though,
how much longer that can continue?
My costs have stayed reasonable, but
only due to departmental generosity.
Imagine, though, the situation of those
students who don't have that subsidy.
Or even worse, if your spouse is on the
plan, your rate next year is going up 38
percent. That's $350 more a month and
$4200 more a year.
I see no reason why Cardinal Care
premiums should be increasing at their
current rate, or why other schools
which do not have their own facilities
have managed to offer much more af
fordable (and in some cases more com
prehensive) care for their'students. Per
haps it is because those schools feel that
a healthy student population that can
afford reasonable health care is a high
priority. If my reasoning is flawed, 1
would greatly appreciate a more thor
ough explanation from Cardinal Care
as to the reasons behind such drastic
rate increases. A 40 percent increase
over two years deserves more than a
vague paragraph on their Web site.
