## Google should expand its offerings 
### GALEN PANGER 
Google lias a plethora of search
tools designed to put the Web's store
house of information at your finger
tips. As just about every computer
user in the world (and certainly every
Stanford student) knows. You can use
Google to search the Web for pages
relevant to your search terms, you can
search for images, search newsgroups,
check out the latest news across a
broad spectrum of news source and
you can even use Google (well,
Froogle) to compare prices on prod
ucts you're looking to buy.
Those are just Google's main
tools. I could go on forever about its
blog tools, Web page translator, Web
alerts, its wireless phone search capa
bilities ... At times it seems that there
is nothing Google can't find — at your
command or e-mailed to you as it
comes in. Every Web page I've ever
designed has been picked up by
Google's Web crawlers within days.
Want an instant background check on
someone? Google them.
Actually, there are things Google
can't search. But, well, they're work
ing on that, too. A recent interview
with Google's director of technology,
Craig Silverstein, on CNet Tech
News, hints at all kinds of new things
Google wants to search — among
them, audio and video. In the inter
view, Silverstein even talks about
having a "search pet" that can act like
your own research librarian, with all
the skills and intelligence of a re
search librarian.
They even want your search pet
to tailor search results to your emo
tional state. I can imagine my Google
pet. Poogle, coming up to me one day,
reading my emotional state, and of
fering "You should try Zoloft" or
"Don't worry about writing that SLE
paper. You can get one for free right
now off of Cheat House.com." Could
be annoying. On the other hand, it
definitely could be useful. Either way,
it's fun to imagine what will be possi
ble when the realms of artificial intel
ligence and search technology over
lap. Actually. 1 believe the two realms
go hand in hand.
And then we can talk about
Gmail, Google's new free Web-based
e-mail system (still in the testing phas
es). which offers each user a gigabyte
of storage, and is perfectly designed to
utterly decimate the e-mail offerings
of Microsoft and Yahoo. I recently
had an opportunity to try it out. It is
extremely fast in every sense of the
word, and it very nicely arranges your
conversations into neat conversation
threads — meaning, every e-mail you
write and receive with a particular

subject line gets grouped together so
that you can view the entire history of
that conversation. (This works very
much like Apple's Mail program, ex
cept Gmail helpfully also includes
messages you've sent.)
Other interesting capabilities in
clude almost-full keyboard opera
tion of Gmail's interface, a spam fil
ter and the ability to search through
old e-mails using Google's search
technology. Before using the e-mail
system, I was wary of the ads I knew
Gmail was going to place next to
every e-mail of mine (this is how
they'll pay for that gigabyte of stor
age, after all), offering up products
related to my conversation.
I thought this would be intrusive,
but it's not. At least not yet. I couldn't
get Gmail to offer up any provocative
ads. I talked about pizza, porn, music,
Michael Jackson, abortion, birth con
trol, renting movies, food, Chicago,
New York—you name it, I talked
about it. And Gmail didn't serve me
ads about any of it. About the only
thing I could consistently get was an
ad about Stanford's summer pro
grams. And I wasn't even trying to get
that to come up. Of course, maybe no
one has bought ads just yet. Maybe
I'm testing the system prematurely.
With so much going for Google
(did I mention their IPO?), it would
seem that there is almost no room for
criticism. And truly, it would seem un
fair to criticize it, seeing how much
they are doing in an industry that is so
wide-ranging, full of potential and still
largely unexplored. But in the inter
ests of helping a company that em
ploys droves of Stanford students
every year, I'd like to offer up a few
criticisms and suggestions.
We'll start small. I think Gmail's
emphasis on searching e-mails, rather
than filing them, is a mistake. I like the
idea of being able to search my e-mail
(which is already a feature of every
non-Web-based e-mail program on
the market, though not a feature in
Hotmail or Yahoo Mail), but I also
think it is ridiculous to have to per
form a search every time I want to see
e-mails about frequently discussed
subjects, like a club I'm a part of or a
design I'm working on. I'd rather just
have Gmail put them in a separate
folder as they come in and then allow
me view them as the need arises. I also
like having my e-mail program put my
incoming e-mail into pre-designated
folders so that I know what kind of e
mail I'm getting, when it's important
to read my e-mail and when I can just
ignore it (like in Apple's Mail). This is
just a small quibble, but an important
one to me.
I also think Gmail's interface is a

bit unconventional and disorienting.
If it works out better for users in the
end, though, I'm all for it.
Moving on to bigger topics, I real
ly think it is time for Google to gradu
ate to different sources of information
besides just what it's crawlers can get
their hands on. Amazon.com's ability
to search within some of the books in
its catalogue has enormous potential.
It would be amazing if we were one
day able to search the entire Library
of Congress right from our browsers.
It would be a huge undertaking, but it
would put unparalleled amounts of in
formation at the world's fingertips. It
would also be nice to search other
(for-pay) databases for information
all in one place. Though it would cost
Google, I wonder whether it wouldn't
be possible. Perhaps Google could
charge a small fee for central access to
some of the best online databases.
Regarding the process of getting
information, Google could harness
some of the advances in artificial intel
ligence to preempt you with informa
tion before you ever asked for it.
Imagine typing a paper on, say.
Magritte's Golconda, and getting arti
cles, Web pages and images served up
to you in a small sidebar before you
even asked for it. Though it is always
wise to do research before you start
writing, it would be fantastic to be pre
sented with information that could en
rich your essay. And then, perhaps
while reading an article about Donald
Rumsfeld, Google could again pre
sent you with more information, more
pictures and more opinions about
Donald Rumsfeld — further broad
ening and enhancing your knowledge
of the war chief.
Even Gmail should take advan
tage of this. Imagine debating some
thing with a friend over e-mail and
getting ammo for the fight right next
to the e-mail. Gmail does provide a
few "related links" underneath its "re
lated ads," but they're paltry. They
need to be expanded. By the way, I
saw all of this technology I've men
tioned already in action in one form or
another when I visited Northwestern
University's Info Lab last year.
The field of information retrieval is
large and expanding. Right now.
Google is leading the field and thinking
big — but I think that they could think
bigger, implementing ideas and innova
tions that are tangible and possible
today. I've talked about a few of those
ideas, but perhaps Google has even big
ger ideas in the works. Given Google's
track record, I wouldn't be surprised.

Google lias a plethora of search
tools designed to put the Web's store
house of information at your finger
tips. As just about every computer
user in the world (and certainly every
Stanford student) knows. You can use
Google to search the Web for pages
relevant to your search terms, you can
search for images, search newsgroups,
check out the latest news across a
broad spectrum of news source and
you can even use Google (well,
Froogle) to compare prices on prod
ucts you're looking to buy.
Those are just Google's main
tools. I could go on forever about its
blog tools, Web page translator, Web
alerts, its wireless phone search capa
bilities ... At times it seems that there
is nothing Google can't find — at your
command or e-mailed to you as it
comes in. Every Web page I've ever
designed has been picked up by
Google's Web crawlers within days.
Want an instant background check on
someone? Google them.
Actually, there are things Google
can't search. But, well, they're work
ing on that, too. A recent interview
with Google's director of technology,
Craig Silverstein, on CNet Tech
News, hints at all kinds of new things
Google wants to search — among
them, audio and video. In the inter
view, Silverstein even talks about
having a "search pet" that can act like
your own research librarian, with all
the skills and intelligence of a re
search librarian.
They even want your search pet
to tailor search results to your emo
tional state. I can imagine my Google
pet. Poogle, coming up to me one day,
reading my emotional state, and of
fering "You should try Zoloft" or
"Don't worry about writing that SLE
paper. You can get one for free right
now off of Cheat House.com." Could
be annoying. On the other hand, it
definitely could be useful. Either way,
it's fun to imagine what will be possi
ble when the realms of artificial intel
ligence and search technology over
lap. Actually. 1 believe the two realms
go hand in hand.
And then we can talk about
Gmail, Google's new free Web-based
e-mail system (still in the testing phas
es). which offers each user a gigabyte
of storage, and is perfectly designed to
utterly decimate the e-mail offerings
of Microsoft and Yahoo. I recently
had an opportunity to try it out. It is
extremely fast in every sense of the
word, and it very nicely arranges your
conversations into neat conversation
threads — meaning, every e-mail you
write and receive with a particular

subject line gets grouped together so
that you can view the entire history of
that conversation. (This works very
much like Apple's Mail program, ex
cept Gmail helpfully also includes
messages you've sent.)
Other interesting capabilities in
clude almost-full keyboard opera
tion of Gmail's interface, a spam fil
ter and the ability to search through
old e-mails using Google's search
technology. Before using the e-mail
system, I was wary of the ads I knew
Gmail was going to place next to
every e-mail of mine (this is how
they'll pay for that gigabyte of stor
age, after all), offering up products
related to my conversation.
I thought this would be intrusive,
but it's not. At least not yet. I couldn't
get Gmail to offer up any provocative
ads. I talked about pizza, porn, music,
Michael Jackson, abortion, birth con
trol, renting movies, food, Chicago,
New York—you name it, I talked
about it. And Gmail didn't serve me
ads about any of it. About the only
thing I could consistently get was an
ad about Stanford's summer pro
grams. And I wasn't even trying to get
that to come up. Of course, maybe no
one has bought ads just yet. Maybe
I'm testing the system prematurely.
With so much going for Google
(did I mention their IPO?), it would
seem that there is almost no room for
criticism. And truly, it would seem un
fair to criticize it, seeing how much
they are doing in an industry that is so
wide-ranging, full of potential and still
largely unexplored. But in the inter
ests of helping a company that em
ploys droves of Stanford students
every year, I'd like to offer up a few
criticisms and suggestions.
We'll start small. I think Gmail's
emphasis on searching e-mails, rather
than filing them, is a mistake. I like the
idea of being able to search my e-mail
(which is already a feature of every
non-Web-based e-mail program on
the market, though not a feature in
Hotmail or Yahoo Mail), but I also
think it is ridiculous to have to per
form a search every time I want to see
e-mails about frequently discussed
subjects, like a club I'm a part of or a
design I'm working on. I'd rather just
have Gmail put them in a separate
folder as they come in and then allow
me view them as the need arises. I also
like having my e-mail program put my
incoming e-mail into pre-designated
folders so that I know what kind of e
mail I'm getting, when it's important
to read my e-mail and when I can just
ignore it (like in Apple's Mail). This is
just a small quibble, but an important
one to me.
I also think Gmail's interface is a

bit unconventional and disorienting.
If it works out better for users in the
end, though, I'm all for it.
Moving on to bigger topics, I real
ly think it is time for Google to gradu
ate to different sources of information
besides just what it's crawlers can get
their hands on. Amazon.com's ability
to search within some of the books in
its catalogue has enormous potential.
It would be amazing if we were one
day able to search the entire Library
of Congress right from our browsers.
It would be a huge undertaking, but it
would put unparalleled amounts of in
formation at the world's fingertips. It
would also be nice to search other
(for-pay) databases for information
all in one place. Though it would cost
Google, I wonder whether it wouldn't
be possible. Perhaps Google could
charge a small fee for central access to
some of the best online databases.
Regarding the process of getting
information, Google could harness
some of the advances in artificial intel
ligence to preempt you with informa
tion before you ever asked for it.
Imagine typing a paper on, say.
Magritte's Golconda, and getting arti
cles, Web pages and images served up
to you in a small sidebar before you
even asked for it. Though it is always
wise to do research before you start
writing, it would be fantastic to be pre
sented with information that could en
rich your essay. And then, perhaps
while reading an article about Donald
Rumsfeld, Google could again pre
sent you with more information, more
pictures and more opinions about
Donald Rumsfeld — further broad
ening and enhancing your knowledge
of the war chief.
Even Gmail should take advan
tage of this. Imagine debating some
thing with a friend over e-mail and
getting ammo for the fight right next
to the e-mail. Gmail does provide a
few "related links" underneath its "re
lated ads," but they're paltry. They
need to be expanded. By the way, I

ligence to preempt you with informa
tion before you ever asked for it.
Imagine typing a paper on, say.
Magritte's Golconda, and getting arti
cles, Web pages and images served up
to you in a small sidebar before you
even asked for it. Though it is always
wise to do research before you start
writing, it would be fantastic to be pre
sented with information that could en
rich your essay. And then, perhaps
while reading an article about Donald
Rumsfeld, Google could again pre
sent you with more information, more
pictures and more opinions about
Donald Rumsfeld — further broad
ening and enhancing your knowledge
of the war chief.
Even Gmail should take advan
tage of this. Imagine debating some
thing with a friend over e-mail and
getting ammo for the fight right next
to the e-mail. Gmail does provide a
few "related links" underneath its "re
lated ads," but they're paltry. They
need to be expanded. By the way, I
saw all of this technology I've men
tioned already in action in one form or
another when I visited Northwestern
University's Info Lab last year.
The field of information retrieval is
large and expanding. Right now.
Google is leading the field and thinking
big — but I think that they could think
bigger, implementing ideas and innova
tions that are tangible and possible
today. I've talked about a few of those
ideas, but perhaps Google has even big
ger ideas in the works. Given Google's
track record, I wouldn't be surprised.
