## It's chill for soccer in KA Kickball Classic 
### 
Bases loaded. Last inning. No outs. Championship
Game. Dramatic two-word sentence fragments.
Fighting to hold a 6-3 lead against a blonde, sexy
and half-naked team, we found ourselves facing
insidious questions running through our minds. Would we
win the title? Could we stop the rally? Would Ryan con
vince Theresa to have an abortion and get back with Maris
sa in the 0.C.? Where in God's name was Seth sailing to?
All good questions. Yet only two would be answered in
the next few minutes. With a live version of "Stairway to
Heaven" blasting out of speakers deep in right field, Todd
Leber delivered the pitch, only to watch it driven hard to
our shortstop, Kyle Hency. With agility reminiscent of a
jungle cat, Hency dove to his left, catching the red Voit
esque rubber ball, holding all the runners after what
seemed like a dangerous kick.
Wait, wait, wait. Spencer, what the hell are you talking
about? Kick? Voit? Jungle cat?
What, you thought I was going to talk about real sports?
Please.
When you face the mens water polo team in the final
game of the KA Kickball Classic (motto: "It's chill"), it's
definitely deserving of a column, no matter what my editor,
critics or conventional wisdom may say.
Let's set the stage.
Arriving at Roble Field at 10:15 a.m. on Saturday, I
stepped out of my car and into a mission. Playing for the

Varsity Soccer squad, we were commit
ted to repeat last year's victory. Howev
er, we had one obstacle in our way — the
Stanford varsity water polo team.
My nemesis: water polo. We meet again.
After a detente in the "hottest man on cam
pus" debate, we found ourselves eye to eye
once more. In fact, we'd meet twice during
the day, in our first and last games.
So after we started our 10:30 game at
the crack of 11:23 (KA timekeeping: It's

chill), and watched as polo put up two runs early, we got a bit
scared. But with a flourish, we clawed back, scoring four
runs late to finish out the game, 4-2.
Lunch had arrived at the double-elimination tourna
ment, and with the free Baja burritos came a whole smor
gasbord of people. Actually, I don't know what smorgas
bord means, but I saw it on Jeopardy! once and I thought it
sounded funny.
Pi Phi made a strong showing, losing to Roble, 14-2.
Stanford President John Hennessy made a cameo appear
ance, accounting for Pi Phi's two runs, both solo shots to
left. Really? No, not really.
Nic Markman, who was largely in charge of sending
poor Pi Phis out for slaughter, was very enthusiastic about
the participation. "This event was for the Muscular Dystro
phy Association", Markman said, "which is chill. We raised
about $73,000 for charity, so that was extra chill. And this is
the 157 th annual classic, which makes it the only charity
event held here that outdates Stanford."
In other news, resident hot girl and record holder of the
"most used athlete picture in The Daily" Jeane Goff was there,
so that was a real plus for all involved. More on her to follow.
Bu let's fast forward. After narrowly beating Ben Hus
ton's Ferocious Alligators squad in a hotly contested game
that nearly led to the ruin of our close, friendly, and yet
strictly platonic relationship, it was Soccer against Water
Polo in the final game.
And after being told that despite our undefeated record,
Water Polo would not have to beat us twice (KA's thoughts
on double elimination: It's Chill), we knew we had to step it
up a notch.
There were a couple of special rules for the final game.
Most importantly, to score a run, you had to slip-'n'-slide
into home. The only other special rule seemed to be that if
you were on the Water Polo team, you had to be barefoot,
bare-chested and well-tanned. Well, everyone except Al
fonso Pulido, who explained, "Well, I'm not 'technically' on
the polo team, but I had been playing some polo at the West
Valley junior college pool that morning, so I thought, hey,
why not?" (Editor's query: Are walk-ons 'technically' on
the men's soccer team?) Dressed in a black shirt, black
warmups and a pair of Adidas soccer cleats, "Fonz" seri
ously tarnished the Water Polo look.
Hardly chill, Mr. Pulido, hardly chill.
But back to the game. Polo opened up an early three
run lead, despite a Web Gem from this young columnist.
However, it was Water Polo's own mistakes that proved to
be the turning point in the game. As sophomore Marcello
PantulihavealongnamethatSpencerdoesn'tknowhow
tospellcorrectly rounded third base with two outs, it
looked like he would follow the cleated Pulido on the slip
n-slide. but in a error of magnificent proportions, Marcel
lo eschewed the slippery surface, tiptoeing around the yel
lowing water (hardly chill, Mr. Pulido), thereby trading a
run for an out.
"I don't know what I was thinking," Marcello would
later say, "I saw Jeane. didn't want to mess up my hair... it
was tragic. I kept thinking to myself, WWSCD? — What
would Seth Cohen do?' I just got flustered."
I love the kid, but what a bonehead by Marcello. I mean,
if Water Polo had any advantage on us, it was in the water
and he completely blew it.
Combine this with a two-out, two-run error when Sam
Tyre and the Fonz crashed into each other (ayyyy!) allow
ing two runs to score after my fantastic slide put us ahead,
4-3, on the previous play and we could smell victory.
But this is kickball, so you can't take anything for granted.
Bases loaded. Last inning. One out. Championship
Game. More dramatic two-word sentence fragments.
Leber bounced the Voit in, and watched it rocket down the
right-field line. If it goes through, the game is tied. Caught, and
we live for another out. But in the greatest play of his soccer
career, first baseman Galen Thompson caught the drive and
beat the runner back to first base, securing the victory.
And you know, while I enjoyed winning the MVP of the
title game, holding that glorious trophy (the second-place
trophy to the IMWO U-12 boys soccer tournament, what
ever that was) and posing fora fake photographer, we
didn't do it for the glory.
We did it to beat Water Polo.
Very chill.

Wait, you're still reading? If you are one of the nine ran
dom names Spencer dropped in this column, e-mail your
brah at porters@stanford.edu to tell him how sick, wicked
and tight it all was.

the men's soccer team?) Dressed in a black shirt, black
warmups and a pair of Adidas soccer cleats, "Fonz" seri
ously tarnished the Water Polo look.
Hardly chill, Mr. Pulido, hardly chill.
But back to the game. Polo opened up an early three
run lead, despite a Web Gem from this young columnist.
However, it was Water Polo's own mistakes that proved to
be the turning point in the game. As sophomore Marcello
PantulihavealongnamethatSpencerdoesn'tknowhow
tospellcorrectly rounded third base with two outs, it
looked like he would follow the cleated Pulido on the slip
n-slide. but in a error of magnificent proportions, Marcel
lo eschewed the slippery surface, tiptoeing around the yel
lowing water (hardly chill, Mr. Pulido), thereby trading a
run for an out.
"I don't know what I was thinking," Marcello would
later say, "I saw Jeane. didn't want to mess up my hair... it
was tragic. I kept thinking to myself, WWSCD? — What
would Seth Cohen do?' I just got flustered."
I love the kid, but what a bonehead by Marcello. I mean,
if Water Polo had any advantage on us, it was in the water
and he completely blew it.
Combine this with a two-out, two-run error when Sam
Tyre and the Fonz crashed into each other (ayyyy!) allow
ing two runs to score after my fantastic slide put us ahead,
4-3, on the previous play and we could smell victory.
But this is kickball, so you can't take anything for granted.
Bases loaded. Last inning. One out. Championship
Game. More dramatic two-word sentence fragments.
Leber bounced the Voit in, and watched it rocket down the
right-field line. If it goes through, the game is tied. Caught, and
we live for another out. But in the greatest play of his soccer
career, first baseman Galen Thompson caught the drive and
beat the runner back to first base, securing the victory.
And you know, while I enjoyed winning the MVP of the
title game, holding that glorious trophy (the second-place
trophy to the IMWO U-12 boys soccer tournament, what
ever that was) and posing fora fake photographer, we
didn't do it for the glory.
We did it to beat Water Polo.
Very chill.

Wait, you're still reading? If you are one of the nine ran

Bases loaded. Last inning. No outs. Championship
Game. Dramatic two-word sentence fragments.
Fighting to hold a 6-3 lead against a blonde, sexy
and half-naked team, we found ourselves facing
insidious questions running through our minds. Would we
win the title? Could we stop the rally? Would Ryan con
vince Theresa to have an abortion and get back with Maris
sa in the 0.C.? Where in God's name was Seth sailing to?
All good questions. Yet only two would be answered in
the next few minutes. With a live version of "Stairway to
Heaven" blasting out of speakers deep in right field, Todd
Leber delivered the pitch, only to watch it driven hard to
our shortstop, Kyle Hency. With agility reminiscent of a
jungle cat, Hency dove to his left, catching the red Voit
esque rubber ball, holding all the runners after what
seemed like a dangerous kick.
Wait, wait, wait. Spencer, what the hell are you talking
about? Kick? Voit? Jungle cat?
What, you thought I was going to talk about real sports?
Please.
When you face the mens water polo team in the final
game of the KA Kickball Classic (motto: "It's chill"), it's
definitely deserving of a column, no matter what my editor,
critics or conventional wisdom may say.
Let's set the stage.
Arriving at Roble Field at 10:15 a.m. on Saturday, I
stepped out of my car and into a mission. Playing for the

Varsity Soccer squad, we were commit
ted to repeat last year's victory. Howev
er, we had one obstacle in our way — the
Stanford varsity water polo team.
My nemesis: water polo. We meet again.
After a detente in the "hottest man on cam
pus" debate, we found ourselves eye to eye
once more. In fact, we'd meet twice during
the day, in our first and last games.
So after we started our 10:30 game at
the crack of 11:23 (KA timekeeping: It's

chill), and watched as polo put up two runs early, we got a bit
scared. But with a flourish, we clawed back, scoring four
runs late to finish out the game, 4-2.
Lunch had arrived at the double-elimination tourna
ment, and with the free Baja burritos came a whole smor
gasbord of people. Actually, I don't know what smorgas
bord means, but I saw it on Jeopardy! once and I thought it
sounded funny.
Pi Phi made a strong showing, losing to Roble, 14-2.
Stanford President John Hennessy made a cameo appear
ance, accounting for Pi Phi's two runs, both solo shots to
left. Really? No, not really.
Nic Markman, who was largely in charge of sending
poor Pi Phis out for slaughter, was very enthusiastic about
the participation. "This event was for the Muscular Dystro
phy Association", Markman said, "which is chill. We raised
about $73,000 for charity, so that was extra chill. And this is
the 157 th annual classic, which makes it the only charity
event held here that outdates Stanford."
In other news, resident hot girl and record holder of the
"most used athlete picture in The Daily" Jeane Goff was there,
so that was a real plus for all involved. More on her to follow.
Bu let's fast forward. After narrowly beating Ben Hus
ton's Ferocious Alligators squad in a hotly contested game
that nearly led to the ruin of our close, friendly, and yet
strictly platonic relationship, it was Soccer against Water
Polo in the final game.
And after being told that despite our undefeated record,
Water Polo would not have to beat us twice (KA's thoughts
on double elimination: It's Chill), we knew we had to step it
up a notch.
There were a couple of special rules for the final game.
Most importantly, to score a run, you had to slip-'n'-slide
into home. The only other special rule seemed to be that if
you were on the Water Polo team, you had to be barefoot,
bare-chested and well-tanned. Well, everyone except Al
fonso Pulido, who explained, "Well, I'm not 'technically' on
the polo team, but I had been playing some polo at the West
Valley junior college pool that morning, so I thought, hey,
why not?" (Editor's query: Are walk-ons 'technically' on
