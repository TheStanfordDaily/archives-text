# Cardinal looks to regain momentum
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford baseball team will try to re
bound from its first series loss of the season when it
faces Arizona this weekend. But first things first —
the Cardinal will try to get its momentum back in an
other Tuesday non-conference game.
The Cardinal, which saw their Pacific-10 Confer
ence lead over Washington shrink to a half-game after
losing two of three in Seattle, will attempt to sweep
the four-game season series with Santa Clara tonight.
Stanford (37-8, 11-4 Pac-10) scored 42 runs
in its three previous games against the Bron
cos in 2004, but that probably means little to
head coach Mark Marquess and company after
the bats didn't show up in two losses this
weekend — especially Sunday, when Wash
ington starter Tim Lincecum struck out 13
Cardinal batters in eight innings of work in a
9-2 win over Stanford.
"We really didn't get much going at all the entire
game," Marquess said.
What it means is that with nine games remaining
in the Pac-10 season, Stanford will be in a heated
race until the postseason.
"It's good to have a challenge every year before the
postseason," junior outfielder Danny Putnam said. "The
key will be to see how we respond to that challenge."
The Cardinal's response begins tonight with a
game against Santa Clara (22-27), which is six games
off the lead in the West Coast Conference, behind
Pepperdine.
The Broncos offense is led by junior outfield
er Nic Crosta, a transfer from Texas who leads
the team in batting average (.374), home runs
(11), RBIs (43) and slugging percentage (.626).
Junior first baseman Will Thompson (.323-11-
40) is the team's other power threat.

As of last night, the Broncos had not announced a
starter for the contest.
Santa Clara's stalwart in the bullpen has been
closer Anthony Rea, who is tied for second in the
nation with 12 saves. With his saves and three
wins, Rea has helped account for 15 of the 22
Santa Clara wins. Rea is 3-1 and leads the stall in
ERA (1.94), opponents' batting average (.204)
and strikeout-to-walk ratio (5.9) and is second in
appearances (25).
Stanford sophomore Jed Lowrie is probably
looking forward to facing the Broncos after a
rough weekend in Seattle. In three games against
Santa Clara, the sophomore second baseman has
hit .563 (9-for-16) with three home runs, three
doubles, 10 RBIs and nine runs scored.
In other news. Marquess also addressed the status
of two of Stanford's biggest offensive stars, who have
both been missing from the lineup recently. Jonny
Ash, who hasn't played since April 20 against St.
Mary's, has a hairline fracture in his right index fin
ger. John Mayberry Jr., who played only one of three
games this past weekend, is still suffering from a
bruised left shoulder that he suffered two weeks ago
against Santa Clara.
With only eight hits on Sunday, Stanford's bat
ting average dropped two points to .332, which is
five percentage points behind the school record of
.337 posted by the 1981 team.
Also on Sunday, senior Sam Fuld picked up the
340 th hit of his career to move within 28 of all-time
Stanford and Pac-10 record holder John Gall
(1997-2000). Fuld's four at-bats also moved his ca
reer total to 1,112, just 15 shy of Gall's school
record of 1,027.
Until this past weekend, the Cardinal had not lost a se
ries since Arizona — this weekend's foe — took two-of
three from Stanford at Sunken Diamond in April 2003.
The first pitch tonight is scheduled for 6 p.m.
