# Stanford sprinters have attitude to match speed
## 
### EMIL. MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
Besides the huge amount of talent and
sheer number of incredible sprinters on the
Stanford women's track team this year, there
is one thing that sets this group apart from
years past: attitude.
"These girls have the attitude, the sprint
er's mentality," said women's head coach
Edrick Floreal. "I think that one thing mat
ters as much anything else. They get revved
up for races. It gives them the opportunity to
be themselves."
Going into the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships, these women will certainly
bring their attitude but plan on letting their
feet do most of the talking.
"We're not really looked at as a sprinting
team," said sophomore Chinny Offor, one of
the conference favorites in the 800 meters.
"We're very confident, though. We definite
ly want to show teams like UCLA that they
need to look at us."
At last year's Pac-10 Championships, the
Bruins beat the Cardinal women, 155-140.
while third-place Southern California man
aged just 101 points. The race is expected to
be similarly lopsided this year, with UCLA
and Stanford the heavy favorites for the team
crown once again.
"UCLA is going to have to bring their 'A'
game," said junior Undine Becker, who re
turned to competition at the Big Meet after
an injury that sidelined her in March. Her
long-jump mark ranks her second in the Pac
-10 in the event.
And the Bruins probably know what
awaits them. At the Texas Relays in April,
Stanford's 1,600-meter relay won in a school
record three minutes, 33.98 seconds, finishing
just 0.8 seconds behind UCLA.
"At Texas, I think people were shocked,"
said sophomore Nashonme Johnson, who
last year was Stanford's first sprinter to qual

ify for the NCAA Championships since
Olympic gold medalist Chryste Gaines in
1992. "We were a team of three freshmen and
a sophomore. It's going to be very, very close
at conference. We're still young, we're going
to grow. We're definitely better now than we
were at Texas."
In fact, the only senior on the team is hur
dler Lindsey Johnson, who has been coming
back strong after a season-ending injury at
the Big Meet last year.
"And let me remind everyone that we
are the defending Pac-10 champions in the
11,600-meter relay]," added junior Chris
tine Moschella.
Many of the team's goals seemed cen
tered around the 1.600-meter relay. And
with six athletes who have run under 55
seconds for the 400, those goals seem
well focused.
"We have a lot of girls our coach can make
a [1,600-meter] relay team out of, and any
four can get at least 3:39 or 3:40," Offor said.
Besides repeating as the Pac-10 champi
ons in the event, the Cardinal has other large
goals. After narrowly missing a spot in the
NCAA finals last year, the women want to be
sure that doesn't happen again.
The women may also have a shot at the
NCAA finals in the 400-meter relay, as they
are currently the ninth-ranged team in that
event, showing the true breadth of strength in
the women's sprint program that is growing
on the Farm.
And in the end, probably the only thing
that may hurt this close-knit and very talent
ed team is its youth.
"I like that we are a young team," fresh
man Ashley Freeman said. "There's room
for improvement. We've had a few people in
jured and we're struggling little by little, but
we're moving up. We're out there beating a
lot of people."
Added Floreal: "I think their chances for

They're learning to let go, to take
chances. They're young, and they
might make mistakes, but that'll get
them to the next level."
But most importantly, these
women are a team. Their casual atti
tude toward and respect for each
other will undoubtedly help them as
they face some of the most talented
teams in the nation in the coming
weeks at the conference, regional and
national levels.
"When we're honest with each
other, the more we win and the better

we are together," said Nashonme
Johnson. "It's not a few individuals. All
the women together make the team."
To prepare for the challenges at
the Pac-10 Championships this week
end, the women sprinters spent last
weekend training and making final
preparations.
Some athletes not on the women's
sprint squad garnered final qualifying
marks for the primaiy portion of the
conference championships next week
and junior Nick Taylor opened up the
men's Pac-10 Championship title run
in the decathlon.
Taylor finished ninth in the event
with a career-best 6351 points.
Senior Mian Camarena won the
women's shot put at the renowned

Modesto Relays with a throw of 57-
5.75, while sophomore Sarah Hopping
finished a solid fourth in the hammer
with a throw of 194-10, within striking
distance of UCLA's Cari Soong and
Jessica Crosby.
At the Sacramento State Open, ju
nior Evan Fox recorded a Pac-10 and
NCAA Regional qualifying time of
1:50.51 in the 800 while junior Stanley
Wilson won the 100 in 10.69.
To cap off the weekend, Stanford
swept the women's discus at Sacra

an injury that sidelined her in March. Her
long-jump mark ranks her second in the Pac
-10 in the event.
And the Bruins probably know what
awaits them. At the Texas Relays in April,
Stanford's 1,600-meter relay won in a school
record three minutes, 33.98 seconds, finishing
just 0.8 seconds behind UCLA.
"At Texas, I think people were shocked,"
said sophomore Nashonme Johnson, who
last year was Stanford's first sprinter to qual

ify for the NCAA Championships since
Olympic gold medalist Chryste Gaines in
1992. "We were a team of three freshmen and
a sophomore. It's going to be very, very close
at conference. We're still young, we're going
to grow. We're definitely better now than we
were at Texas."
In fact, the only senior on the team is hur
dler Lindsey Johnson, who has been coming
back strong after a season-ending injury at
the Big Meet last year.
"And let me remind everyone that we
are the defending Pac-10 champions in the
11,600-meter relay]," added junior Chris
tine Moschella.
Many of the team's goals seemed cen
tered around the 1.600-meter relay. And
with six athletes who have run under 55
seconds for the 400, those goals seem
well focused.
"We have a lot of girls our coach can make
a [1,600-meter] relay team out of, and any
four can get at least 3:39 or 3:40," Offor said.
Besides repeating as the Pac-10 champi
ons in the event, the Cardinal has other large
goals. After narrowly missing a spot in the
NCAA finals last year, the women want to be
sure that doesn't happen again.
The women may also have a shot at the
NCAA finals in the 400-meter relay, as they
are currently the ninth-ranged team in that
event, showing the true breadth of strength in
the women's sprint program that is growing
on the Farm.
And in the end, probably the only thing
that may hurt this close-knit and very talent
ed team is its youth.
"I like that we are a young team," fresh
man Ashley Freeman said. "There's room
for improvement. We've had a few people in
jured and we're struggling little by little, but
we're moving up. We're out there beating a
lot of people."
Added Floreal: "I think their chances for

success are a lot higher than last year.
They're learning to let go, to take
chances. They're young, and they
might make mistakes, but that'll get
them to the next level."
But most importantly, these
women are a team. Their casual atti
tude toward and respect for each
other will undoubtedly help them as
they face some of the most talented
teams in the nation in the coming
weeks at the conference, regional and
national levels.
"When we're honest with each
other, the more we win and the better

we are together," said Nashonme
Johnson. "It's not a few individuals. All
the women together make the team."
To prepare for the challenges at
the Pac-10 Championships this week
end, the women sprinters spent last
weekend training and making final
preparations.
Some athletes not on the women's
sprint squad garnered final qualifying
marks for the primaiy portion of the
conference championships next week
and junior Nick Taylor opened up the
men's Pac-10 Championship title run
in the decathlon.
Taylor finished ninth in the event
with a career-best 6351 points.
Senior Mian Camarena won the
women's shot put at the renowned

Modesto Relays with a throw of 57-
5.75, while sophomore Sarah Hopping
finished a solid fourth in the hammer
with a throw of 194-10, within striking
distance of UCLA's Cari Soong and
Jessica Crosby.
At the Sacramento State Open, ju
nior Evan Fox recorded a Pac-10 and
NCAA Regional qualifying time of
1:50.51 in the 800 while junior Stanley
Wilson won the 100 in 10.69.
To cap off the weekend, Stanford
swept the women's discus at Sacra
mento State with a 1-2-3 finish by se
nior Kitty Currier, junior Lindsay
Brisbain and freshman Stephanie Be
night.
The Cardinal continues with Pac-10
action in Arizona this weekend.
Besides the huge amount of talent and
sheer number of incredible sprinters on the
Stanford women's track team this year, there
is one thing that sets this group apart from
years past: attitude.
"These girls have the attitude, the sprint
er's mentality," said women's head coach
Edrick Floreal. "I think that one thing mat
ters as much anything else. They get revved
up for races. It gives them the opportunity to
be themselves."
Going into the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships, these women will certainly
bring their attitude but plan on letting their
feet do most of the talking.
"We're not really looked at as a sprinting
team," said sophomore Chinny Offor, one of
the conference favorites in the 800 meters.
"We're very confident, though. We definite
ly want to show teams like UCLA that they
need to look at us."
At last year's Pac-10 Championships, the
Bruins beat the Cardinal women, 155-140.

aged just 101 points. The race is expected to
be similarly lopsided this year, with UCLA
and Stanford the heavy favorites for the team
crown once again.
"UCLA is going to have to bring their 'A'
game," said junior Undine Becker, who re
turned to competition at the Big Meet after
an injury that sidelined her in March. Her
long-jump mark ranks her second in the Pac
