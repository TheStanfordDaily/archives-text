# Women's lax drops heartbreaker to Cal
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Once again, the number six proved
unlucky for the Stanford women's
lacrosse team.
Last weekend, in its game against
No. 7 Georgetown, the Cardinal (9-9)
lost as the Hoyas went on two sepa
rate scoring streaks of six unan
swered goals.
At the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration Championship in Denver,
Colo., this past Saturday, the final six
seconds of the game doomed the top
seeded Cardinal, as California scored
the deciding goal within those last sec
onds of the game to win, 11-10.
Stanford advanced to the title game
with a 17-3 win over UC-Davis in the
first round on Thursday. It was the
Cardinal's second win over the Aggies
this season. In the other semifinal
matchup, tournament-host Denver
fell to California. 17-12, to set up Sat
urday's Bay Area showdown.
Stanford got on the hoard first as
sophomore Megan Burker scored off
an assist from Bach less than two min

ute> into the game. The rival teams
headed into halftime tied 4-4, as senior
Kim Cahill, freshman Michelle
DeChant and freshman Liz Piselli also
netted goals in the first period.
In recent games, the women have
come out strong after the break, and
Saturday was no exception. Within the
first four minutes of the latter period,
Stanford scored twice as Piselli tallied
her second goal of the day and junior
Kelsey Twist scored on a free-position
shot.
Over the next eight minutes, howev
er, Cal fought back and managed to tie
the game at 7-7.
After Burker traded goals with Cal's
Jocelyn Paul, she followed with an
unassisted goal and then fed teammate
Claire Calzonetti for another score to
push Stanford's lead to 10-8.
Cal's Laura Cavello cut the deficit
to 10-9 before teammate Colleen
O'Mara tied the game at 10-10 with
38 seconds remaining in the game.
With six seconds left in the game, the
Bears' Leanne Zilioli netted the
final goal of the game to secure the
MPSF Championship.

"Cal knew they had to score and
went all out for the last five or six min
utes of the game," senior goalkeeper
Christina Saikus said.
Saikus tallied a game-high 12 saves
and was named to the MPSF All-Tour
nament Team along with Burker, Pisel
li and Cahill.
"What we found out this weekend
was [that] we had to learn how to play
tired, to function on all cylinders on
maximum effort," said Stanford head
coach Michele Uhlfelder. "We were
doing that and still we didn't win. We
had to learn the hard way. We mislead
ourselves into thinking our hard work
would always lead us to a win. I expect
that next year, that'll be something that
stays with [the team]."
While Stanford was disappointed
with its first conference loss during
Uhlfelder's four-year tenure, at
least the Cardinal's contest against
UC-Davis last Thursday was much
more affirming.
The team started out strong in the
first period as Burker, Cahill and Twist
tallied two goals apiece. Contributing
to the Cardinal's 11-1 lead at halftime

were Calzonetti, junior Nina Pantano,
sophomore Sarah Bach, DeChant and
Piselli. who each scored once.
Stanford maintained the momen
tum in the second half. Burker netted
her third goal of the game and the first
of six unanswered goals from Stanford.
The Stanford onslaught continued as
Calzonetti, Pantano and Piselli all
notched their second goals of the game.
Senior Abbi Hills and junior Julia Cal
zonetti also scored for Stanford.
In addition to her three goals, Burk
er also tallied two assists, while Piselli
and Twist finished with two goals and
an assist apiece.
Last week, Uhlfelder said that she
wanted to see "more people getting in
volved" offensively. With 10 different
players scoring in Thursday's game, she
felt as though the team was "more of a
scoring threat."
"When push came to shove, when
our backs were against the wall, there
were a few individuals who stepped up,"
Uhlfelder said. "It was good to see dif
ferent people take some opportunities."
