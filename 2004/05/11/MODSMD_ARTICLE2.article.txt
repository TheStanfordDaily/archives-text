### EUGENIE KIM STAFF WRITER 
Storytelling is like making love â€” memory and imagination often
work together to relate a narrative, and everybody has a story to tell,
said world-renowned writer Isabel Allende to a standing-room-only
crowd in Kresge Auditorium last night.
"I think the perfect lover is a matter of luck." she said. "Getting him
or her to perform is a matter of seduction. Storytelling is like that. Find
ing the story is a stroke of luck. But to get the characters to perform, I

have to seduce them."
Audience members, including University President John Hennessy,
filled the seats and lined the auditorium walls. Those who could not fit
inside the spilled out into the lobby. The speech was part of the Stanford
Humanities Center's Presidential Lecture Series, which was co-spon
sored for the first time by the ASSU Speakers Bureau, and the audience
was comprised of approximately equal parts students and older com
munity members.
Allende expressed her appreciation to the students who helped to
bring her to Stanford, saying, "Thank you for being here today, and
thank you for inviting me, especially the students... I hate to be invit
ed by the old farts."
From the moment the petite novelist stepped onto the podium to
begin her lecture entitled "A Sense of Place," she charmed her audience
with jokes and insight about being a foreigner in the United States.
"For years, I didn't see the difference between Democrats and Re
publicans," she said. "It took George [W.] Bush to wake me up."
But she also emphasized that her identity now is, in some senses,
more American than anything else, despite her dissatisfaction with cer
tain aspects of the country.
"We are seen as bullies, if not as criminals," she said. "Although I am
critical about many things about this country, I am proud to be an
American citizen. I have the right to try to change what I don't like, and
I have a voice."
A native of Chile, Allende spoke about her experiences living in dif
ferent countries and finally settling in Marin County after she was exiled
from her homeland when her uncle, Chilean president Salvador Al
lende, was assassinated in a military coup supported by the CIA.
It was this experience that inspired her first novel, "The House of
Spirits," in 1985. Her further travels around the world instigated her de
sire to write in a way that could be related to by all. According to Al
lende, her work is always grounded in a strong sense of place, though
that place is not necessarily always familiar or recognizable.
"Why did I choose to write about such faraway places? Maybe be
cause I wanted to take my readers out of their comfort zone," she said.
"It is good to experience the world. In doing so we learn that every
where people are similar. Everybody wants the same things. Everybody
experiences love, shame, fear, greed, hope, pain, in the same way."
Yet in the end, Allende spoke most often about herself and how her
