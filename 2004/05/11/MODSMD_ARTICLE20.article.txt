## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR

With the top eight teams plus two individuals
moving on to next week's NCAAs, the Cardinal fin

ished third with a three-round total of 883, eight
strokes better than its previous best mark this sea
son.
Stanford, which will make its 21st appearance at
NCAAs, shot a season-low round of 293 on Friday
and followed that up with a 297 on Saturday. It
would have taken a complete collapse for the Cardi
nal to fall out of the top eight on Sunday, but the
team showed no signs of complacency in putting to
gether another impressive 293.

UCLA took home the team title with
a three-under par 861, which was seven
strokes better than runner-up California.
The Bruins' Hannah Jun captured
the individual title with a seven-under
par 209 and UCLA also got a strong per
formance from Charlotte Mayorkas, who
finished tied for third with a 214.
Sophomore Stephanie Liu led the
Cardinal with a three-over par 219, good
for 10th place. Freshman Jennifer
Tangtiphaiboontana fired a final-round
71 to tie for 11th with a 220 and fellow
freshman Lauren Todd tied for 21st with
a 223. Senior Kim Kouwabunpat tied for
25th with a 225 and senior Angela Rho
completed Stanford's scoring with a 227
to tie for 38th.
The NCAA Championships will be
held May 18-21 at the Grand National
Lake Course in Opelika, Ala. Twenty
four teams, eight from each of the three
Regionals, will compete. Reigning cham
pion Southern California advanced fora
chance to defend its title with a fourth
place finish in the Central Regional. The
Cardinal placed 16th last season.
Meanwhile, the Stanford men's
golf team was selected as the No. 16 seed
in the West Regional to be held at the
Crosswater Club at Sunriver Resort in
Sunriver, Ore., on May 20-22. The Cardi
nal is coming off a lOth-place finish at the
Pacific-10 Conference Championships in
late April.
Twenty-seven teams will compete
at three different Regionals with 10
teams from each Regional advancing to
the NCAA Championships to be held
June 1-4 in Hot Springs, Va.
Stanford will square off against
some familiar opponents in its quest to
qualify for NCAAs, including UCLA,
Arizona State, Arizona and USC, which
were named the top-four seeds. The
Cardinal finished tied for 15th at last
year's West Regional.
