# Penguin falls to Oremus, files campaign grievance
## Penguin accuses Oremus of violating SSCCC rules; Oremus denies charges and drinks cheap champagne 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN INTERNATIONAL PLAYBOY 
"This isn't over," Jules R. Penguin swore at the close
of yesterday's tightly contested election for Volume 226
editor in chief of The Stanford Daily.
Although current Opinions Editor Will Oremus, a se
nior, crushed the polar biped in the actual vote count, 46-
2 with two abstentions. Penguin said he would bring a suit
before The Daily's Board of Directors, charging that Ore
mus unfairly employed his vocal chords, in violation of the
publishing corporation's Super Secret Codes for Cam
paign Conduct (SSCCC).
"I can't talk," Penguin said. "It's just not fair for me,
and that's just the end of it. Obviously, the talking was
what swayed the election."
He added, "Oremus' decision to use forceful, complex
arguments — when I can't even speak — was pretty
damn unsportsmanlike."
Oremus maintained that he did not violate the
SSCCC, contrary to the Penguin's claims.
"It is true that the SSCCC in most circumstances
does not allow for the use of one's vocal chords during
the campaign period," Oremus said. "But according to
Article 8, Section c. Subsection 22(a), as long as one
does not say anything substantive, these provisions do
not apply.
Penguin conceded that what Oremus said was
"a load of shit," although he argued that the clause which
Oremus cited did not apply because it wasn't "relevant to
the matter at hand."
"How can it be relevant to the matter at hand," Pen
guin continued, "when I don't even have hands?"
Oremus stated that he has no regrets regarding his
campaign conduct.
"I was just trying to get out my message in a manner
that was consistent with the SSCCC," he said. "Appar

ently. Penguin can't handle the truth — that being my
platform, of course."
"I am also planning to provide Penguin with much
needed 'companionship' for the evening," he added.
In past election cycles, it has been customary for the
losing party to receive companionship from the win
ning candidate.
"We decided to break that rule last volume," said cur
rent Editor in Chief Brendan Marten, a junior. "Not that
1 didn't think my opponent [junior Mark Thoma] was hot
or anything like that."

Marten has been in a monogamous relationship with
junior coed Timnit Gebru since April 2001.
The Daily is forming a special commission to ascer
tain if any campaign codes were violated. The Student
Commission Regarding Election Winners (SCREW)

will consist of two members
of The Daily staff in order
that a majority is more diffi
cult to achieve.
SCREW Chair Eric Rosser
Eldon explained that since there
would be two members, the com
mittee would likely consist of
himself and one other member.
"With two people, and see
ing as I'm the designated chair,
it's really hard to see it being
any other way," Eldon said.
"And seeing as I never show
up, it's hard to see how any
thing will get done at all. Fuck."
Daily Business Manager
Ezra Callahan, Class of '03,
said that he was happy with
the election result.

"lt's good that Will got elected," he said. "With the
two-editor system and my hot new girlfriend, life is look
ing pretty sweet."
On the other hand, Oremus. who dates a professional
model, said that he is used to having a hot girlfriend.
"She might not be 'new,' but she's built, if you know
what I mean," he said.
Daily staffers expressed uncertainty as to what Ore
mus meant by "built."
"I heard his AIM screen name is i11wi11272,'" said
freshman Brendan Selby, editorial board staff writer.
"Two-seventy-two pounds sounds pretty 'built'
to me."
Oremus protested that the number did not refer to his
girlfriend's weight.
"No, it's the horsepower of my car," he claimed. "Well
actually, the horsepower of my car is 263, but I was in high
school at the time. We all make stupid mistakes in high
school. Don't we?"
The election, which yielded 50 votes, barely met The
Daily's Bylaw-mandated quorum requirement.
"With 88 voters on the list and 45 voters needed to

meet quorum, we had a pretty close shave there," said
Orernus, who rarely shaves at all. "I was almost more
worried that I might get edged out by a lack of partici
pation among voters rather than the competition.'
The few who did vote for Penguin expressed unhappi-

ness with the result.
"It's sad to see an
election process tainted by an
individual who actually had
the nerve to write a platform
under 10 pages," said senior
Andy Cox. "1 mean.comeon.
We run newspapers everyday
longer than that. That's why I
cast my vote for Penguin."
Penguin's platform
was only seven pages.
Senior Erin Archerd,
head copy editor, said that she
hopes Oremus will focus on
staff development issues.
"I see a lot of poten
tial in Will's staff," she said.
News Editor Camille
Ricketts. a junior, disagreed.

"I'm just happy I'm going to be away studying in
Washington, DC., next volume." she said. "Although, it
probably couldn't be any worse than this volume."
