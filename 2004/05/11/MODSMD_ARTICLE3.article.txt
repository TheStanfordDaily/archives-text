# Prof. Hyatt starts TV network with Gore
## 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
Business Prof. Joel Hyatt has joined
A1 Gore and a group of investors in
purchasing the News World Interna
tional (NWI) television network. Hyatt
and Gore intend on gradually shifting
the content of the network toward a
young adult audience.
"[The network] will mark their ca
reers, their relationships, the culture
in which they live, the issues of the day
â€” in a voice that young people recog
nize because it will be their voice,"
Hyatt said.
NWI is currently broadcast to 17
million subscribers across the United
States and to anyone with DirecTV
satellite abroad. Despite of the
breadth of NWI, network chairman
Gore and CEO Hyatt will need sub
stantial financial backing in order to
relaunch the network.
The company's backers are known
collectively as INdTV Holdings LLC,
and include venture capital firm Blum
Capital and Yucaipa Companies, in ad
dition to a number of prominent Holly
wood and Silicon Valley figures like
Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy,
former Warner Home Video president
Warren Lieberfarb and"The West

Wing" actor Bradley Whitford.
The new network does not intend
on having a political affiliation and
Hyatt firmly maintains that A1 Gore's
partnership does not mean a Democ
ratic bias.
"It isn't intended to be a political
channel at all," Hyatt said. "Points of
view will be expressed, but it will be
points of view of that generation."
In a press conference, Gore ex
pressed his hope that this news chan
nel would provide a fresh and inde
pendent voice, serving as an alterna
tive to a media industry run by large
conglomerates.
"We seek to be bold, to be irreverent
and we're going to be funny and excit
ing," said Hyatt. "We will share the
power of the television platform with
young adults."
The target age of the channel will be
the 20-something audience, and Hyatt
has already solicited the help of former
Graduate School of Business student
Jamie Daves and current student Maria
Porad in helping to research and devel
op the channel.
Hyatt will continue to conduct stud
ies among Stanford students for the
network in order to, in Hyatt's words,
facilitate discussion in "their own voice
with their own peers."
