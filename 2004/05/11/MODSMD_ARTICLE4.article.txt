# Number of undeclared sophomores increases
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
Ice cream has become the University's
latest incentive to encourage students to
declare their majors early. Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education John Brav
man offered Klondike bars at a Sopho
more Welcome held last September to all
sophomores who would declare their ma
jors by the end of the year.
According to Bravman. the number of
undeclared sophomores has risen by over
100 percent in the last two years, although
the increase has been less dramatic school
wide. As of fall quarter 2003,57.7 percent
of students were undeclared according to
Registrar Roger Printup, compared to
56.5 percent the year before.
"The bad news is that the number is
above 50 percent, and has been fora
decade," Bravman said. "Students lose out
on a great deal of department-specific ad
vice and also lose the chance to join a new
community of students when they delay
declaration. Given that you can change
your major, there should be little incentive
to delay."
The ice cream was given to approxi
mately 80 sophomores who declared their
majors at a Sophomore Reorientation
held in April, which was pegged as a "cele
bration of declaration."
"I didn't go there with the intention of
declaring, but seeing all of my friends de
claring and the excitement of the event
made me declare," said sophomore Payam

Cherchian. "It was really easy to do it on
Axess, but I haven't really noticed any
benefits from declaring yet."
Declaring on Axess is the easier part
of the process. Students often get stuck
on the next step — going in to their de
partments and finding or meeting with
an advisor.
"I'm just too lazy to declare," said

After the entire process is com
plete, students can experience tan
gible benefits, including invitations
to departmental lunches and sub
scription to the department e-mail
list offering internships and speak
er announcements. Unfortunately,
this is not enough incentive if stu
dents don't know what they want to
major in.
"1 haven't found something I'm
passionate about, which basically
means 1 haven't found something
that I'm both interested in and good
at that I can major in and get a job
after graduation," said sophomore
Emily Chang.
Students are asked to choose a
major at the end of their sophomore

year, usually after six quarters at
Stanford and after having complet
ed 85 units, including transfer work
-and units for advanced placement.
Students are allowed to change
their majors if their interests shift.
"I think some students are re
luctant to make the decision,"
Printup said. "For some, it repre
sents a closing off of choices. I
think students know that they can
change majors if they want, but
changing majors becomes more
difficult as time goes on."
At the end of the sophomore
year, the University is allowed to
place an undeclared student on a
registration hold. Current practice
is to grant an automatic one-quar
ter grace period, not including the
summer. Students have until the
end of fall quarter of their junior
year to declare. After that, their
registration is put on hold, prevent

ing the student from enrolling in
classes.
"In comparison to other universi
ties, the major declaration process at
Stanford is really quite easy," Print
up said. "Some departments have
students complete statements of
purpose, but I do not view that as an
onerous process given that the
major is going to comprise at least
one-third or one-half of a student's
undergraduate program."
Declaring a major can still be dif
ficult because of the perceived grav
ity of the decision.
"[Declaring a major] is a fear of
commitment with too many un
knowns — like marrying a girl be
fore you know how she performs
in bed," said sophomore David
Corcoran.

Students are allowed to change
their majors if their interests shift.
"I think some students are re
luctant to make the decision,"
Printup said. "For some, it repre
sents a closing off of choices. I
think students know that they can
change majors if they want, but
changing majors becomes more
difficult as time goes on."
At the end of the sophomore
year, the University is allowed to
place an undeclared student on a
registration hold. Current practice
is to grant an automatic one-quar
ter grace period, not including the
summer. Students have until the
end of fall quarter of their junior
year to declare. After that, their
registration is put on hold, prevent

ing the student from enrolling in
classes.
"In comparison to other universi
ties, the major declaration process at
Stanford is really quite easy," Print
up said. "Some departments have
students complete statements of
purpose, but I do not view that as an
onerous process given that the
major is going to comprise at least
one-third or one-half of a student's
undergraduate program."
Declaring a major can still be dif
ficult because of the perceived grav
ity of the decision.
"[Declaring a major] is a fear of
commitment with too many un
knowns — like marrying a girl be
fore you know how she performs
in bed," said sophomore David
Corcoran.
