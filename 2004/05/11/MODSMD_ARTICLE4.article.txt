# Number of undeclared sophomores increases

Ice cream has become the University's
latest incentive to encourage students to
declare their majors early. Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education John Brav
man offered Klondike bars at a Sopho
more Welcome held last September to all
sophomores who would declare their ma
jors by the end of the year.
According to Bravman. the number of
undeclared sophomores has risen by over
100 percent in the last two years, although
the increase has been less dramatic school
wide. As of fall quarter 2003,57.7 percent
of students were undeclared according to
Registrar Roger Printup, compared to
56.5 percent the year before.
"The bad news is that the number is
above 50 percent, and has been fora
decade," Bravman said. "Students lose out
on a great deal of department-specific ad
vice and also lose the chance to join a new
community of students when they delay
declaration. Given that you can change
your major, there should be little incentive
to delay."
The ice cream was given to approxi
mately 80 sophomores who declared their
majors at a Sophomore Reorientation
held in April, which was pegged as a "cele
bration of declaration."
"I didn't go there with the intention of
declaring, but seeing all of my friends de
claring and the excitement of the event
made me declare," said sophomore Payam

Cherchian. "It was really easy to do it on
Axess, but I haven't really noticed any
benefits from declaring yet."
Declaring on Axess is the easier part
of the process. Students often get stuck
on the next step â€” going in to their de
partments and finding or meeting with
an advisor.
"I'm just too lazy to declare," said
