Hubble's final days
A mission to service the Hubble was cancelled because NASA deemed
that it was not worth repairing the telescope. John Grunsfeld, NASA's chief

scientist, cited safety as the primary reason. He said that
the Hubble is very important, but NASA did not want to
risk astronaut's lives — the next time the telescope be
comes defective, that is it. If the Hubble were to be ser
viced again it might last till 2011, but now its lifespan is un
certain. Hubble has surprised everyone, though — it was
launched in 1990 with a defective mirror alignment, which
was eventually fixed, and it has since worked better than
the most expectations.
The Big Bird Race

UK's Conservation Foundation andTasmanian scientists have teamed up
to promote The Big Bird Race, also known as the Ultimate Flutter. The idea
is to track the migration of 18 juvenile Tasmanian albatrosses, a reclusive, en
dangered species, from Tasmania to South Africa. People will be able to bet
on individual birds and accompany their journey via satellite. The organizers
themselves will not make any money from the race, but they are hoping the
publicity will bring attention to seabird conservation.
Proteins preventing plaques
The proteins apolipoprotein E (apoE) and clusterin seem to act as chap
eronins in clearing hazardous molecules from the brain. Chaperonins are
critical because, as the name implies, they assist the actual molecule that
does the work. Importantly, apoE and clusterin may help in clearing the
plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's. David H. Holtzman, professor of
neurology, said, "Our findings suggest it is worthwhile to explore the use of
drugs or therapies to alter or perhaps increase the expression of these proteins
as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease." The study was done by sci
entists from Washington University and published in the journal Neuron.
Polymers on my fingernail
You have a new dress, but you're not sure which color fingernail polish is the
best match. If you're Carlos Baena, a researcher at the Center of Technology
Research in Electrochemistry in Basque country, you would have a system cap
ture an image of the dress, place your finger on an electrode and voila, your nails
are set. The idea won the innovation prize at a recent competition. And it has
more applications than just fingernails — the technology can be used to change
the color of your car, windows in your office or the display on your computer
screen. The secret lies in electrochemical materials, which change color when an
electric current passes through them. The challenges are to make the materials
so that the color change will be instantaneous and not fade after recurrent use.
Particle physicists win prize
Robert Brout and Francois Engler of the Universite Libre de Bruxelles
in Belgium and Peter Higgs of Edinburgh University were awarded the
Wolf Prize for explaining how fundamental particles can acquire mass in the
Standard Model. The $ 100,000 prize, awarded by the Wolf Foundation in Is
rael, is considered the most prestigious prize in physics after the Nobel. Prior
to this work, physicists were unable to explain why some particles seemed to
have mass and others did not. Brout, Engler and Higgs theorized in the early
1960s that particles carrying the weak force (one of the four fundamental
forces) could gain mass by electromagnetic interactions. Although the phe
nomenon has not been observed experimentally, many physicists hope it
will be seen in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC is a large accel
erator scheduled for completion in 2007 in CERN, which is operated by 20
European countries and located near the Swiss-French border.
The active Sun
Geophysicists in Finland and Germany have calculated that the Sun is more
magnetically active right now than in the last 1,000 years. They calculated solar
magnetism by measuring the concentration of beryylium-10 in polar ice. This
isotope is produced when cosmic rays interact with the Earth's atmosphere —
a strong solar field means less of these interactions and less beryllium-10. Using
modeling techniques, the team extended these measures as far back as 850 AD
and found that there has been a sharp increase in sunspots in the 20th century.
This was the first study of its kind that used direct physical measurements
rather than statistical analysis. Until now, scientists described solar activity by
counting sunspots, which are produced by the Sun's magnetic activity.
