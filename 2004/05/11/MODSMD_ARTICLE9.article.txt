# I Lawyer, I Entrepreneur
## An in-depth look at founding companies in Silicon Valley 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
Mark White, co-founder and a
partner at White & Lee LLP,
works with many aspiring and sea
soned entrepreneurs in Silicon
Valley who want to build compa
nies. White took a few minutes
during an interview to reflect on
entrepreneurship and share ad
vice with students interested in
forming companies.
"Focus on the business, he
said. "Don't focus on law and the
structure of the company from a
legal perspective. Ask a lot of
questions about how to get the
company funded and what in
vestors what to hear."
White's firm. White & Lee
LLP. is a corporate law firm head

quartered in Menlo Park. It has
represented such clients as Hot-
Mail, Classmates Online and
Selby Ventures.
White said that a lawyer must
find how he fits into the larger pic
ture of entrepreneurship.
"[Ask yourself] what advice a
lawyer or any other kind of
vender can provide that will add
value to the enterprise itself and
help you build your organiza
tion", White said. "You don't
want to get a lawyer or accountant
or consultant that doesn't ask you
questions about the business."
Making mistakes early can be
harder to fix later.
"Problems include taking on
the wrong staff or taking on too
much infrastructure before you
have sales," White said. "It's not
being flexible in your strategic

thinking about what the company
ought to do and looking at your
competition. A company's success
is measured relative to other com
petitors in the same space. You
have to constantly monitor your
customers and adjust your strate
gy as you go along."
White provides an interesting
perspective in that he is not only
an attorney; he has a strong busi
ness background as well. He ma
jored in economics at Rutgers,
then graduated from the Harvard
Business School in the late 70s
and worked in international man
agement for five years.
The turning point for him came
during the Iran-Iraq war. After
being put on house arrest in
Kuwait he decided he wanted to
change career paths.
"In business, you get slotted for
a particular type of responsibility
you take on," White said. "And I
was in international management
at the time and every opportunity I
had would take me out of the coun
try, so law seemed pretty interest
ing at the time. Working with busi
nesses is something I've always
wanted to do and I've been doing
that since I got out of school."
White decided to pursue a
law degree, graduating in 1987
from Berkeley.
Creating a business requires

"Good ideas are in abundance and the ability to
execute on an idea, to build an organization, is
something that is not native to any of us."

many people working together.
"I think the most successful en
trepreneurs are those persons that
have a technical or business back
ground," White said. "No one has
the entire skill set to be successful
in any enterprise. You've got to
surround yourself with good peo
ple. You've got to know what
you're good at and what you're
not good at."

He stressed the benefits of
working in Silicon Valley.
"No one has a lock on good
ideas," he said. "Good ideas are in
abundance and the ability to exe
cute on an idea, to build an orga
nization, is something that is not
native to any of us. The Valley is a
very forgiving place and the beau
ty of being here is that everyone
has failed a couple times before
they made it."
Chihiro Taketomi, the market
ing manager at White & Lee,
graduated from Stanford in 2001
with a double-major in interna
tional relations and comparative
literature and a co-terminal mas
ter's in sociology. She described
the draw of White & Lee.
"White & Lee has thrived as
the go-to corporate boutique for
many entrepreneurs because it
creates the best working environ
ment for its staff, and that colle
gial ambience is embraced by its
clients," she said.
Taketomi, who still main
tains ties to Stanford, serves as a
bridge between Stanford stu
dents and White & Lee and has
helped the firm support Stan
ford student groups that are in
volved in entrepreneurial or
law-related activities.
One of White & Lee's long
time clients, Velocityll, which

was founded by Stanford alumni,
was recently funded by Mayfield, a
notable venture fund in the Valley.
While Stanford provides a
great educational environment,
there is much to be said for real
world experience.
"Literally, your education,
and your track record, starts
when you graduate from Stan
ford," White said.
