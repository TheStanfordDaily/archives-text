Bela Fleck, banjo, and Edgar Meyer, bass
Memorial Auditorium | 2:30 pm
When these Grammy-winners and longtime friends last played together at
Stanford in 2001, their brilliant renditions of classical music, bluegrass, and
jazz drew thunderous ovations from the sold-out audience. Small wonder
that they also are frequent collaborators with some of the world's finest
artists, including Yo-Yo Ma, the Chieftains, Garth Brooks, and Joshua Bell.
Don't miss the captivating energy and downright fun as they feature music
from their brand-new CD Music for Two.
STANFORD STUDENT PRICE: $24/$2O/$l5
"Fleck's banjo and Meyer's bass were
handled with great verve, and their
interplay was at times dazzling."
—The Tennessean
