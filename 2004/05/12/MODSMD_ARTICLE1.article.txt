### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The Bush administration has used scien
tific confusion to roll back a national envi
ronmental compact that the American public
had agreed to for over three decades, said
Sierra Club President Carl Pope in a speech
yesterday afternoon.
Focusing on his recent book "Strategic Ig
norance," Pope's talk, held in the History
Corner, described specific instances of right
wing politicians encouraging President
George W. Bush to abandon his environ
mental campaign promises and of the federal
government suppressing scientific reports in
the name of politics.
"These people are willing to say anything,
do anything, lie about anything to carry out
their ideological objectives," he said.
Pope said that for 30 years the American
public favored environmental regulation,
and that the nation had found improvements
to be surprisingly easy to execute. He argued
that contrary to what the Bush administra
tion says, additional environmental policies
are economically beneficial and can still be
achieved with little sacrifice.
"It's not a completely free lunch, but a
much cheaper lunch than you might think,"
he said.
In his view, the impediments are fossil
fuel companies and automakers who survive
on subsidies and are slow to adapt. He

pointed out that environmental regulations will hurt
these companies, but will not impact most others, citing
Intel as an example.
Pope also discussed how the Sierra Club plans on mo
bilizing voters in 11 key cities this fall by focusing on local
issues. He said the key to winning the election for Demo
cratic Senator John Kerry — who the Sierra Club en

dorsed yesterday — will not be in convincing voters who
to vote for, but instead in convincing them just to vote.
He praised Kerry's environmental plans as more am
bitious than A1 Gore's. Pope also targeted his message of
voting directly at students, who made up half of the ap-

proximately 75-person audience.
"First, you know more about the
environment than any generation
before you. Second, you votel," he
said, pausing for emphasis, "at the
lowest level of any generation in
American history. Third, you don't
see any contradiction between those
two facts."
Pope did not take a dire view of
the future. Although he expressed
concern about global warming and
other environmental problems, Pope
claimed that most of Bush s environ

mental actions could be repealed
within six months of a Kerry admin
istration, as Bush has ushered few
environmental bills through Con
gress.
Still, Pope said that the key to
electing a more environmentally
friendly administration is educating
voters about real science and cutting
through government rhetoric.
According to Pope, carefully con
trolled rhetoric turned "global
warming" into "climate change." He
read a passage from his book citing
an administration memo arguing
that "there is still a window of oppor
tunity to challenge the science." In
Pope's view, the Bush administration
has taken advantage of science by ex
ploiting the uncertainty that is inher
ent to all scientific conclusions.
