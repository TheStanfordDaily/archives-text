The Bush administration has used scien

the name of politics.
"These people are willing to say anything,
do anything, lie about anything to carry out
their ideological objectives," he said.
Pope said that for 30 years the American
public favored environmental regulation,
and that the nation had found improvements
to be surprisingly easy to execute. He argued
that contrary to what the Bush administra

are economically beneficial and can still be
achieved with little sacrifice.

much cheaper lunch than you might think,"
he said.
In his view, the impediments are fossil
fuel companies and automakers who survive
on subsidies and are slow to adapt. He

pointed out that environmental regulations will hurt
these companies, but will not impact most others, citing
Intel as an example.
Pope also discussed how the Sierra Club plans on mo

dorsed yesterday — will not be in convincing voters who
to vote for, but instead in convincing them just to vote.
He praised Kerry's environmental plans as more am
bitious than A1 Gore's. Pope also targeted his message of
voting directly at students, who made up half of the ap-
