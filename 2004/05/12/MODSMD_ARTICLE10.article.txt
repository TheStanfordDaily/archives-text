## Special Assistant for Diversity Outreach Laura Selznick 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Laura Selznick took over a new post as special assistant for diversity outreach
last fall after many years as an associate director in the Undergraduate Research
Programs office. She speaks French, Russian, a tad of Japanese and German, and
is taking her first Spanish class this quarter.
1) You've been an adviser for an astounding 25 years. What was your worst ad
vising experience?
This was pretty bad, actually. I had a situation where an advisee had come to
Stanford under false pretenses and it was discovered. Then there were various
things that happened to make that person leave Stanford. For somebody that re
ally cares about students, that was a really hard experience.

2) 25 years... That means some of your earliest advisees arc in
their 40s now. Do you know what any of them are doing?
The oldest one that I'm still in touch with is Anastasia
Watson, who was among the first group, and she had a hard
freshman year because she had a medical problem and had to
take time off and then came back and graduated with her class
and she's been fine ever since. Now she's an attorney in Los An
geles — in Pasadena, actually.
One of my former advisees is Danzy Senna, who has a
brand new book that's just come out. [Picks up a hardcover
book.] This is her first book, "Caucasia." This book is very cool.

She has a new one out. She's one of my more famous advisees.

3) Use one word to describe the ASSU election fiasco.
Unbelievable.
4) As the former undergraduate research guru, I have a question for you. I'm an
econ major, so could I get a research grant to test the marginal utility of a 24-pack
of Coronas on a group of my friends?
Probably not.
5) You're in charge of diversity outreach now. What do you think of pro-fro Sarah
Ball's piece in The Washington Post, in which she lambasts ethnically themed
dorms and events?
I didn't see that. I'll answer in a broader way. Diversity at Stanford is for ev
erybody. In fact, one of the ideas that I've had which I'm hoping for in the future
is that there could be some kind of a panel or conversation about diversity at
Admit Weekend, so it isn't just that you're depending on the community centers
to provide the vision of diversity at the University. A student who feels alienated
by the diversity needs a conversation to understand how to participate in the di
versity. Everybody contributes.
Diversity isn't about sectioning people off and assigning them an identity, be
cause so many people have different identities and connect in different ways. I
think that's one of the beauties of Stanford — that you can connect.
6) What do you think of my use of the word "lambasts"?
You're a Stanford student. Words are great.
7) Do you have any plans for "diversifying" Exotic Erotic this weekend [ May 15]?
You should show up just to, you know, make sure things are diverse.
I hadn't thought about it, actually.
8) Could you help me "diversify" my stock portfolio?
That's why you're an econ major.
9) What's your favorite building or location on campus?
Probably the arches in front of Old Union. There's something about the bird
bath fountain in the middle. It makes a nice space — we've done some really nice
events there. It also reminds me of when my kids were little, they liked to walk
around and around the fountain and I was always worried that they would fall in.

10) Name one of the best things and one of the worst things about The Stanford Daily.
It keeps you up-to-date with what's going on. I like the front page — I read it
every morning. I always check out the sports and read the columns more or less.
Letters to the editor are always entertaining. One of my favorite kind of articles is
the one that was in today's paper talking about the new election of the editor. I like
The Daily because it's a reflection of the student take on the University, and when
they do a good job they can do some really good news coverage.
The one [thing] that's open to the most improvement is reporters keeping their
quotes straight. Editors have control over the editorial content, but sometimes they
can misquote you or put your quote in the wrong context. But this year, The Daily's
been pretty good. The article that they wrote about me, when I got this new job,
was in some ways better than the article that was in The Stanford Report. It was a
really nice article. That was a delicate transition and they handled it really nicely.
