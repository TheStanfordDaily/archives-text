# All that jazz

### MELISSA CHEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's been a busy year for Stan
ford's Jazz Orchestra (SJO).
This fall, the group put the fin
ishing touches on their new CD.
More recently, they struggled to
get on the ASSU funding ballot
and now SJO is preparing for
their European tour. All this and
it's only a one unit class.
The group is a unique com
pilation of individuals. Accord
ing to the SJO Web site, mem
bers are brought together with
the common goal of keeping
the tradition of big band jazz
alive at Stanford. Although pri
marily undergrads, it's not ex
clusive. For the last few years,
the lead trumpet player has not
been a student.

"Very few
members of
the Jazz Or
chestra are
music ma
jors," said
Fred Berry, di-

rector of SJO, lecturer

and professional jazz

trumpeter. "For many of
the people in the band this is

probably their richest music
experience they'll ever have in
their life."
Berry has directed the group
for the last 14 years. As a for
mer Stanford student, he was
even a teaching assistant for the
class.
"Fred Berry has built this
program into something the
school can be proud of," said se
nior Justin Williams.
Sophomore Julie Spiegel said
the love of jazz is what brings to
gether students from various
academic niches, including
physics, engineering and politi
cal science.
This July, SJO will take
their love of jazz abroad.
Through diligent fundraising,
SJO's two week tour will take
them to Paris, Lyon, Perugia,
Siena and Rome to play in
various festivals.
"When on tour, they'll have
the opportunity to perform at
world-class venues," Berry said.
"It's a culturally-enriching expe
rience as well as a musically-en
riching experience."
It's no mistake that the group
CD "Bridging the Gap" just
came out this year.
"(Our CD release] hinges on

tour," Berry said. "We try to
coordinate the CD [to come
out] in the school year prior to
our summer tour."
The album has 11 tracks and
costs $10. It also highlights local
Bay Area artists as well as John
Worley, Michael Zisman and
Marty Werner.
"The album is called 'Bridg
ing the Gap' because we play a
song on the album with this title
[and also] we are literally bridg
ing the gap between last year and
this year," Williams said.
The recording process was
twofold. SJO recorded eight
songs last spring and another
three this year.
Senior Michael Deeringer
vividly remembers the recording
session last May.
"We spent a long three-day
weekend laying down most of
the tracks for the album, living
off take-out pizza and doing our
best to get in some study time
during the breaks," he said.
Despite the long hours,
Deeringer considers his time

well-spent.
"There's something electri
fying about the recording engi
neer mixing down your sound
and playing it back to you,"
Deeringer said. "You hear

yourself playing ten times
better than you thought you

ever could."
However, Deeringer
said the finishing process

can only take the quality

so tar.
"The players
on this album are
phenomenal," he
said. "I couldn't

A CD release party was
held at at Yoshi's Jazz Club in
Oakland on Feb. 17.
"It [wasj quite an honor to
play at such a prestigious
Bay Area jazz club,"
Williams said.
Their next performance
is at Relay for Life on May 15
at the Stanford Stadium â€”
just one of a variety of cam
pus performances.
"I think it's important to
have a jazz culture on cam
pus in order to provide good
music in the jazz tradition
for students who enjoy it;
and to expand the musical
opportunities of those who
haven't heard much jazz or
big band music before,"
Williams said.
Now with SJO's funding
secure after passage of their
special fees, all future jazz or
chestra concerts will be free
to Stanford students.
"Our ASSU fees [help]
bring world-renown guest
artists to give clinics and per
form concerts with us,"
Williams said.
For Williams, SJO simply
offers the chance to do some
thing he loves.
"I've been a jazz musi
cian all my life and I will
never stop playing,"
Williams said.
Auditions for prospec
tive members will be held in
the fall.
