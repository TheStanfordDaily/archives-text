# Eat, drink and be merry
## The
						Euro vibe 
### 
There are those restaurants that define your high
school experience — where you look back with
the "Wonder Years" shade of nostalgia, and re
call the multiple times when you and your
friends would linger for hours, doing nothing really but
ordering a measly $5 coffee or order of potato skins —
something just to keep the waitress off your back.

Some kids spent these hours at an
old school diner, or maybe that 24-
hour deli that was perfect for post-9
p.m. movie outings. Maybe if you're
from Eagle, Colo., you chill at the gas
station. Gotta love that collection of
gas fumes that has accumulated in
your lungs.
If you can't remember what high
school was like, I urge you to take a
break at noon on a weekday and head

over to Longs in Town and Country Village. That is if
you can fit through the throngs of acne-ridden, self-con
scious and both under- and over-achieving 9th-12th
graders. The mass pile of backpacks outside Longs
gives the hangout away, along with the general excla
mations of "penis" followed by uncontrollable laugh
ter. Yea, don't we all want to be back in high school.
Such great times.
Anyway, I keep forgetting that many of my friends
actually grew up around here — they're either from
20 minutes that way, or just 10 minutes down El
Camino. So sometimes, 1 find that they are great re

sources for inexpensive, casual eateries at where you
can study or just laze around on a warm Sunday after
noon. And hopefully they don't tell me about that re
ally inexpensive gas station snack sjiop next to Taco
Bell. Yum.
So one random Thursday night I was standing in our
open kitchen, picking out the crackers in the Japanese
snack mix, when one of my friends who had gone to the
Menlo School joined me. We were in the midst of a con
versation when she off-handedly mentioned this place
that I kept hearing about — Cafe Barrone. When I
asked her about it, she went off on this long, gushing
praise of how she sat there everyday after-school trying
to avoid doing her homework.
Hmm. sounds like just what 1 need.
So to switch up my usual Starbucks routine, of sitting
in the packed parking lot for 10 minutes, secretly hating
at the guard for Barbecues Galore (seriously, how many
people are buying barbecues on 1 p.m. on Tuesday af
ternoon), only to wait inside for another 15 minutes for
an open table — I try out Cafe Barrone.
If you've ever wondered why there are only 15
some odd tables at Starbucks, it's because they all left
to belong to this charming, quasi-European cafe. I've
never seen such a huge expanse of a patio before, and
the inside area has quite the collection of tables as
well. Beware though, the indoor table surface area
isn't all that big, so if you are planning on bringing
your laptop and massive organic chemistry text book,
I'd think again.

But it's perfect for one of their creamy lattes and a
book from Hemingway, Hurston, Faulker or Fitzergald.
Search for something intelligent to say for your weekly
office hours visit.
Cafe Barrone's huge windows (that basically serve as
one of the walls) look out onto the patio and create a
sense of space and peacefulness. You are not enclosed in
some library, where you have to search for that tiny win
dow crevice to see if it has gotten dark yet. If you want,
you can catch the sunset while outlining your IHUM
paper — without the nasty grass bugs that emerge when
the sky starts to dim.
But it's not only the patio / table / chair ratio that
creates the appeal. The food itself is worth a visit. You
order your food at the counter, after browsing the giant
chalkboard menu that is hanging several feet above the
cash registers. You might end up straining your neck
because there are so many options. You will be looking
at the menu for quite some time.
Once you order, the person behind the counter gives
you a number that you set on the table you choose.
Then you can sit down, relax and wait for the waiter to
find you with your food and silverware. So it's a bit
more casual then a normal sit-down cafe, but definitely
nicer and more chic than a Quizno's or other fast-food
type of place.
Cafe Barrone has a huge array of menu options, from
sandwiches to salads, to appetizer plates and daily soup,
panini, quiche and entfee specials (like a grilled veg
etable lasagna). My absolute favorites are the chicken

salad sandwich and the spinach salad, which blend to
gether perfectly, in case you're really hungry.
The sandwich is full of sizeable chunks of chicken,
softly suspended in creamy mayonnaise, with bits of cel
ery, green apple and walnut pieces mixed throughout. It
is served between thin pieces of lightly toasted cinna
mon raisin bread, which sounds somewhat odd at first,
but actually provides the perfect hint of sweetness to
complement the chicken salad's texture.
The spinach salad is another great order — the ten
der leaves of greens are lightly dressed in a walnut vinai
grette, with cranberry, goat cheese and toasted walnuts
tossed throughout.
So whether it's for that Euro coffee vibe, or that
pseudo-intellectual leisure vibe, make Cafe Barrone a
stop on your road through life. And as a plus, it's right
next door to BBC, so if you get kicked out of there, you
know you have someplace to chill while your friends are
having a good time.
Cate Barrone is located at 1149 hi Camino Real,
in Menlo Park.

If you have been to Eagle, Colo, recently, let Jennie
know at jbroder@stanford.edu. She would like to
know what's going on with these kids that hang out at
gas stations.
