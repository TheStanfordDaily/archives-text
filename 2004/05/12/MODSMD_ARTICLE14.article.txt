## Senior Gift tactics questionable 
### 
Organizers cite several reasons why seniors
should contribute their money to the Senior
Gift. For example, seniors may have bene
fited from the Stanford Fund via financial
aid or student activity funding, and now want to sym
bolically or materially give back. Or students may feel
enough goodwill toward Stanford to give the Universi
ty some of their money.
Alternatively, they may share the Stanford Alumni
Association's desire to increase the overall alumni do
nation rate, which is a large part of the U.S. News and
World Report college ranking formula Organizers be
lieve that students giving as seniors are more likely to
give in subsequent years, as alumni.
However, at this time of the year, the seven "chairs"
of the Senior Gift Participation Committee appear to
have abandoned appeals to seniors' rationality and are
instead resorting to seedy marketing tactics. Each com
mittee member is asked to "solicit 10 classmates" —
typically people with whom the committee member has
a personal relationship —to contribute to the gift.
These solicitations have included personal e-mails,
phone calls and even residence visits.
Network marketing is the practice of selling through
representatives who peddle products to their network
of friends and acquaintances and / or recruit them to

marketing include Cutco knives and Excel telecommu-

short-term profit.
Network marketing is associated with pyramid
schemes, hurt feelings and lost friends. For those being
solicited, network marketing than mean being forced
into an uncomfortable position where your friends are
asking you to participate in a transaction as a favor. In
the case of the Senior Gift, many students who do not
wish to contribute are pressured to feel guilty by their
friends, which impairs relationships for all involved.
It is unnecessary and morally questionable for the
Stanford Alumni Association, the Senior Gift chairs or
other beneficiaries of the Senior Gift to raise money
through such tactics. This is unfair to the Class of 2004,
and there are plenty of more appropriate ways to advo
cate giving to the Senior Gift.
Based on the number of seniors who donated to last
year's Gift, it is likely that a majority of the Class of 2004
will choose not to contribute. These students, as well as
donors who are rightly uncomfortable with the tactics
the participation committee is using, should make their
opinions heard. The Alumni Association reminds us
that Stanford University is a world-class institution; it
should have enough class to discourage fundraising
strategies that rely on harassment and guilt trips.
