Senate undermined electoral process
The ASSU Senate's decision
against certifying the election is a vote
of no-confidence in the judgment of
the voters. It undermined the elective
process and has set a precedent for pet
tiness. The result is the expansion of an
already large division between the
ASSU and the student body.
The constitutional laws are unam
biguous: The first election must be cer
tified. This deviation from the judicial
order could only be a result of person
al conflicts and overambitious sena
tors. Let me remind you, it is the peo
ple who elect a presidential candidate
— not a senate.

Senators acted in bad faith
ASSU undergraduate senators, un
less you have a drastically different
version of the events that took place
Monday night, you ought to seriously
question your responsibilities as elect
ed representatives.
As someone who has lived on this
campus for three years and been in
volved with the ASSU off and on dur
ing that time, I have found that the Sen
ate is most prone to embarrassing itself
when senators put their own personal
feelings above their duty to serve.
Monday night you had a job: to de
termine whether or not the original
election should have been certified.
However, rather than approach
this task as judges, looking for the fair
solution to the problem at hand, many
of you decided to take on the role of
prosecutors, looking, in your own
words, for any reason not to certify the
election. That attitude, that blatant
partiality, makes it impossible for any
student to expect that concerns that

they have will be undertaken seriously
by the Senate, and undermines any
confidence the student body had in
your ability to give a fair hearing those
who bring complaints.
Again, the contention is not with
your final decision, but with the atti
tude that led you to that decision.
Many of you went into that meeting in
bad faith, knowing your decision al
ready and trying to find a way to justify
it. Well, you've prosecuted your case,
now it's your turn to be on trial. Stand
up and defend yourselves.

ASSU senators were the ones
who abused power
Last night's vote by the ASSLJ indi
cated that most senators used their
personal desires to not vote for
Lee/Mefford, and completely failed in
their moral and legal responsibility to
evaluate the legality of the election.
There is a clear difference be
tween "improper" and "illegal."
What the Lee / Mefford campaign
did was "improper"; clear guidelines
should be set for future elections so
that these actions (which are now
"improper") become illegal. Howev
er, in order to overturn a lawful vote
by the student body, the ASSU must
supply the burden of proof that Lee
and Mefford acted illegally accord
ing to the ASSU constitution. They
did not.
If the Lee / Mefford campaign ex
ploited vagaries in the campaign
guidelines to try and drum up sup
port, it means that those vagaries
should be codified. It does not mean
that the ASSU can set an arbitrary
standard after the election to over
turn the slate that the individual sen
ators did not want.

The fact that a former senator
tried to shoot down a student's valid
points because that student was a
friend of Lee indicated more that the
senator was going by his personal
prejudices than the student. Affilia
tion with Lee does not invalidate an
objective argument.
Lastly, I would imagine that most
of the ASSU was horrified when the
U.S. Supreme Court ratified the vote
for George W. Bush four years ago.
If that is true, then the ASSU is en
gaging in both hypocrisy and abuse
of power of the most base and igno
ble kind.

Daily should avoid insignificant
editorial topics
A daily newspaper is a bit like a
marriage — above humdrum petty de
tails and squabbles, it's important to
take a longer view and see the point of
the whole operation. This thought
crossed my mind as I read The Daily's
recent editorial "Fix Post Office
Doors" (May 10). The piece reduced
the editorial page of the flagship news
paper of a world-class university to a
maintenance update.
The challenge of a daily newspa
per is to be the constant companion of
a community and at the same time re
main significant through its reporting
and its editorializing. Seek signifi
cance, then, o Daily gods, else the
blandishments and censure of the
dear old rag our community's wedded
to (for better or worse) will begin to
sound like the white noise of a cou
ple's bickerings just before the di
vorce court.
