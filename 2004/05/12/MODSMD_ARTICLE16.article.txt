# STILL MAC, STILL DANGEROUS
## Bush, the miracle president 
### 
At a certain point, you've got
to give President Bush
some credit. He's superhu
man — a Bionic Man with
nine (x 1 million) lives and unlimited
superpowers. He has survived more
thorny issues than 50 Cent has survived
drive-bys, and he's still charging full
speed ahead. As we all know, not only
is he still president of this fine nation,
but somehow he's still leading the polls
for November's election.
Hell, his predecessor was im
peached for getting head. But no one
can touch Dubya. In fact, the only ones
on their knees in this whole charade
are the Iraqi prisoners, and who really
cares about them?
In the sports world, the 1980 U.S.
Olympic hockey team's run was called
the "Miracle on Ice" because of its leg
endary upset of the Soviet Union en
route to the improbable gold medal.
But it's about time that those boys lost
their claim to the nickname — the
Bush administration has got to be the
team of miracles.
Maybe the Bushies have the genie's
lamp from "Aladdin" or a Beltway
version of Lil' Bow Wow's sneakers
from "Like Mike" that turned the five
foot-tall teenager into an NBA super
star. Whatever it is, it's clear that
they've got more magic on their side
than David Blaine.
Who would have thunk it?
A president is elected with the
slimmest (negative) majority in U.S.
history. From the televised debates, it
looks like he could get stuck on page
seven of "Goodnight Moon" for hours.
The man is barely able to utter a co
herent sentence with a subject and a
predicate sans Karl Rove's help. He
consistently stumbles his way through
interviews, forgets the names of major
world leaders and makes his lack of
qualifications abundantly clear.
At the time, I would have bet the
barn that, if Bush pulled off the upset,
one big screw-up would have him on
the street in no time. It seemed a surer
thing than the Osbourne kids ending
up in rehab.
But over the past three-plus years,
George Herbert Walker Bush has
proven himself to be slippery, to say
the least. He has dodged countless hay
makers that surely would have
knocked out previous presidents with
bob-and-weave moves that make
Muhammad Ali look like Butterbean.

When you break it down, it's truly re
markable — albeit, in the same way
that mayonnaise is remarkable when
it's been sitting out in 90 degree weath
er fora week.
He jetted around the campaign trail
on an Enron plane, and then watched
as the Enron-led corporate scandals

rocked America
without affecting
his approval rat
ings at all.
He convinced
all of Middle
America that he
was a plain-speak
ing American ev
eryman, despite
the fact that he
was born with a sil-

ver spoon jammed down his throat; at
tending a prestigious Northeastern
boarding school, Yale for an under
graduate degree and Harvard for an
MBA; and amassing more "Gentle
man C's" than "dirrty" Christina
Aguilera has STDs.
He has tried to ban stem cell re
search, ignoring pleas from what seems
to be a group of every Nobel Prize
winning scientist on the planet.
He stood in front of the infamous
"Mission Accomplished" banner
more than a year ago doing his best
"Maverick" impression from "Top
Gun" — while the war still rages on,
the body count increases, our allies de
crease and WMDs are still nowhere to
be found.
He was on watch during 9/11,
turned Iraq into Mess o' Potamia (as
the "Daily Show" has so aptly named
it) and yet still has the cojones to run as
a successful "war president." Bush has
even gone so far as to attack the military
credentials of a verifiable war hero in
John Kerry, forgetting that he himself
went AWOL during his action-packed
stint in the Texas Air National Guard.
What about the economy, stupid?
He walked into the Oval Office with a
$5.6 trillion dollar surplus forecast for
the next 10 years, and now the 10-year
forecast is a $1.1 trillion deficit. Ac
cording to many economists, with the
exception of the two world wars, this is
the single greatest destruction of public
wealth in the history of the world — all
in less than four years' work.
He pushed through a massive tax
cut while increasing government
spending, leaving an entire generation

(hint: ours) scratching its head wonder
ing who will be forced to finally foot the
bill (answer: us).
His environmental policy has collec
tively consisted of one huge crap on the
rainforests, and his education policy has
left more children behind than OF Dirty
Bastard and Shawn Kemp combined.
He has launched a ludicrous war
on civil liberties and tried to amend
the Constitution to include a ban on
gay marriage.
Someone in his administration
leaked the name of a CIA agent for
political reasons, another (Rumsfeld)
has already acknowledged responsi
bility for the horrendous human rights
violations at Abu Ghraib prison, and
yet another (Cheney) cozied up to en
ergy executives on the eve of the en
ergy crisis yet still refuses to disclose
what was discussed by this infamous
energy task force.
When Bush was running for presi
dent, it was funny to joke that his
biggest mistake was trading Sammy
Sosa for George Bell when he was
owner of the Texas Rangers. At this
point, Bush could have thrown in
Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Alex
Rodriguez and Albert Pujols for
George Bell, and the deal wouldn't
even crack his top-100 blunders.
But suppose Bush had made that
even-more-horrible trade. If his stint as
owner of the Rangers were anything
like his time as president. Rangers fans
wouldn't have cared. So what if their
team couldn't pitch, field or hit a lick
since he took over? So what if the team
that was once the pride of the Ameri
can League West had begun squander
ing every lead it got.
The manager would definitely keep
his job, as would the general manager
and the entire front office. One player
might be cut if he dared to open his
mouth about the horrible moves, but
who needs a backup catcher anyway?
One thing's for sure. Bush would keep
on truckin' — much to the dismay of
baseball fans like myself.
When the U.S. hockey team did the
impossible and beat the Soviets, A1
Michaels asked, "Do you believe in
miracles?" I do, but hopefully our pres
ident's stash is close to empty.

exception of the two world wars, this is
the single greatest destruction of public
wealth in the history of the world — all
in less than four years' work.
He pushed through a massive tax
cut while increasing government
spending, leaving an entire generation

(hint: ours) scratching its head wonder
ing who will be forced to finally foot the
bill (answer: us).
His environmental policy has collec
tively consisted of one huge crap on the
rainforests, and his education policy has
left more children behind than OF Dirty
Bastard and Shawn Kemp combined.
He has launched a ludicrous war
on civil liberties and tried to amend
the Constitution to include a ban on
gay marriage.
Someone in his administration
leaked the name of a CIA agent for
political reasons, another (Rumsfeld)
has already acknowledged responsi
bility for the horrendous human rights
violations at Abu Ghraib prison, and
yet another (Cheney) cozied up to en
ergy executives on the eve of the en
ergy crisis yet still refuses to disclose
what was discussed by this infamous
energy task force.
When Bush was running for presi
dent, it was funny to joke that his
biggest mistake was trading Sammy
Sosa for George Bell when he was
owner of the Texas Rangers. At this
point, Bush could have thrown in
Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Alex
Rodriguez and Albert Pujols for
George Bell, and the deal wouldn't
even crack his top-100 blunders.
But suppose Bush had made that
even-more-horrible trade. If his stint as
owner of the Rangers were anything
like his time as president. Rangers fans
wouldn't have cared. So what if their
team couldn't pitch, field or hit a lick
since he took over? So what if the team
that was once the pride of the Ameri
can League West had begun squander
ing every lead it got.
The manager would definitely keep
his job, as would the general manager
and the entire front office. One player
might be cut if he dared to open his
mouth about the horrible moves, but
who needs a backup catcher anyway?
One thing's for sure. Bush would keep
on truckin' — much to the dismay of
baseball fans like myself.

impossible and beat the Soviets, A1

At a certain point, you've got
to give President Bush
some credit. He's superhu
man — a Bionic Man with
nine (x 1 million) lives and unlimited
superpowers. He has survived more
thorny issues than 50 Cent has survived
drive-bys, and he's still charging full
speed ahead. As we all know, not only
is he still president of this fine nation,
but somehow he's still leading the polls
for November's election.
Hell, his predecessor was im
peached for getting head. But no one
can touch Dubya. In fact, the only ones
on their knees in this whole charade
are the Iraqi prisoners, and who really
cares about them?
In the sports world, the 1980 U.S.
Olympic hockey team's run was called
the "Miracle on Ice" because of its leg
endary upset of the Soviet Union en
route to the improbable gold medal.
But it's about time that those boys lost
their claim to the nickname — the
Bush administration has got to be the
team of miracles.
Maybe the Bushies have the genie's
lamp from "Aladdin" or a Beltway
version of Lil' Bow Wow's sneakers
from "Like Mike" that turned the five
foot-tall teenager into an NBA super
star. Whatever it is, it's clear that
they've got more magic on their side
than David Blaine.
Who would have thunk it?
A president is elected with the
slimmest (negative) majority in U.S.
history. From the televised debates, it
looks like he could get stuck on page
seven of "Goodnight Moon" for hours.
The man is barely able to utter a co
herent sentence with a subject and a
predicate sans Karl Rove's help. He
consistently stumbles his way through
interviews, forgets the names of major
world leaders and makes his lack of
qualifications abundantly clear.
At the time, I would have bet the
barn that, if Bush pulled off the upset,
one big screw-up would have him on
the street in no time. It seemed a surer
thing than the Osbourne kids ending
up in rehab.
But over the past three-plus years,
George Herbert Walker Bush has
proven himself to be slippery, to say
the least. He has dodged countless hay
makers that surely would have
knocked out previous presidents with
bob-and-weave moves that make
Muhammad Ali look like Butterbean.

When you break it down, it's truly re
markable — albeit, in the same way
that mayonnaise is remarkable when
it's been sitting out in 90 degree weath
er fora week.
He jetted around the campaign trail
on an Enron plane, and then watched
as the Enron-led corporate scandals

rocked America
without affecting
his approval rat
ings at all.
He convinced
all of Middle
America that he
was a plain-speak
ing American ev
eryman, despite
the fact that he
was born with a sil-

ver spoon jammed down his throat; at
tending a prestigious Northeastern
boarding school, Yale for an under
graduate degree and Harvard for an
MBA; and amassing more "Gentle
man C's" than "dirrty" Christina
Aguilera has STDs.
He has tried to ban stem cell re
search, ignoring pleas from what seems
to be a group of every Nobel Prize
winning scientist on the planet.
He stood in front of the infamous
"Mission Accomplished" banner
more than a year ago doing his best
"Maverick" impression from "Top
Gun" — while the war still rages on,
the body count increases, our allies de
crease and WMDs are still nowhere to
be found.
He was on watch during 9/11,
turned Iraq into Mess o' Potamia (as
the "Daily Show" has so aptly named
it) and yet still has the cojones to run as
a successful "war president." Bush has
even gone so far as to attack the military
credentials of a verifiable war hero in
John Kerry, forgetting that he himself
went AWOL during his action-packed
stint in the Texas Air National Guard.
What about the economy, stupid?
He walked into the Oval Office with a
$5.6 trillion dollar surplus forecast for
the next 10 years, and now the 10-year
forecast is a $1.1 trillion deficit. Ac
cording to many economists, with the
exception of the two world wars, this is
the single greatest destruction of public
wealth in the history of the world — all
in less than four years' work.
