# WALLACE WORLD
## Diversity still misunderstood 
### 
While out on a run this
weekend, 1 stumbled
•across the multi-tribe
pow-wow held on cam
pus. The ominous drum beat and
crowds encouraged me to stop fora
minute and look around. The Indian
tacos and fry bread covered with straw
berries convinced me to stay.
Running be damned, I took my
plateful of food over to the crowd
filling in around the dance circle.
Several different tribal dance groups
took a turn in the circle, stepping and
singing to drum beats. Eating my fry
bread, I watched as authentic Aztec
dancers, wearing loincloths made of
animal skins and exotic headdresses
with feathers shooting in every di
rection took the dance circle, mov
ing to the drumbeat in the ancient
Aztec tradition.
It was entrancing and raw and so
different from the constrained Euro
pean way of dancing and socially inter
acting. It wasn't difficult to fathom how
Europeans who came to the New
World would be ... well, shocked and
scared out of their minds upon en
countering the locals.
Forget culture shock, the Native
American way of life was whole plane
tary systems apart from the rigid social
customs of the Old World, making the
resulting culture clash inevitable. Eu
ropean sentiments of the ' unnatural, 1 '
"fiend-like" and "hellish" rituals of
Native Americans are well-document
ed. To the colonists, different was la
beled as evil, and the only hope for the
"savages" — as the Europeans saw it -
was to clothe them, get them into prop
er homes (preferably far apart from
the homes of the colonists) and bring
them Jesus.
As I enjoyed the Aztec dance, I
thought of how much the world has
changed since the colonial period of
the America; how today cultural diver

sity is celebrated rather than feared. I
wondered about how differently —
how enthusiastically — the natives
would be met if a latter-day Christo
pher Columbus happened upon a
strange society of people with very dif
ferent customs.
The self-satisfied thought lasted
about a minute until I remembered
the latest American empire-building

venture in Iraq.
Granted the inva
sion began with
the premise that
Saddam Hussein
was a terrorist,
and removing
him from power
was a national se
curity issue. But
in the fruitless
search for the
WMDs the Bush

administration went searching for
another mandate: bringing freedom
to the people of Iraq, and thus a bet
ter life.
Democratizing the Middle East
was never an American policy, until
now. We are supposed to be mentally
fortified against the deadly images of
loss and pain we receive daily from
Iraq by the comforting thought that
Iraq is free and the people better off
with the new regime.
Our purpose in Iraq is question
able on several levels. At the basic
level, though, is shipping our system
of government around the world just
the modern version of domesticating
the "savages" and bringing them reli
gion? In the same way Europeans
brought "proper" living to the hea
thens, are we misguided in our view
that the world really wants our
democracy, and that we must "liber
ate" other cultures, thrusting our
lifestyle upon them through power
and force?

It's a tricky question that requires a
little humility. 1 was speaking to a
friend today about the Saudi Arabian
culture that basically prohibits free
movement for the women. In Saudi
Arabia, women must be accompanied
by a man to even step outside their
homes, to work, to travel. Are these
women happy with their lot? My
friend suggested that some of the
women would like more freedom to
work and move about as they please,
but also enjoy the respect females are
accorded in that culture, a respect that
is more or less absent in the American
way of equality.
Not everyone wants the American
lifestyle or a capitalistic democracy.
Not every one in the world wanted to
be Roman either. Our style of freedom
has a price not everyone is interested in
paying. And not everything about our
system is perfect.
The colonists, for instance, could
have learned from the environmental
ly friendly lives or the guileless public
dealings of the Native Americans. It is
arrogant to assume our way is the best
way and that all people are willing to
trade their current lifestyles, customs
and systems to have ours.
When exporting democracy,
maybe we should consider the will of
those we seek to liberate. Cultural
change should come from within, not
from a superpower across an ocean
with questionable intentions.
Really, things haven't changed
much from the time the first English
settlers landed in Jamestown, Va. Di
versity is still misunderstood; the pow
erful still believe their way is the most
enlightened and feel most comfort
able when everyone behaves the way
they do.
