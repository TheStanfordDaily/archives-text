## Feminist Studies lecture unacademic 
### STEPHANIE EARLY 
Monday night I attended the talk
"Dude, Where's My Gender?", an
event sponsored by the Feminist Stud
ies Department in Margaret Jacks
Hall. I went to the talk in hopes of hear
ing an intellectually rich discussion
about gender issues. However, 1 was
utterly disappointed and a bit mad
dened by Judith Halberstam's flimsy
and mean-spirited discussion of the
film "Dude, Where's My Car?" as a
lens for understanding the "White
Male Stupidity" that is, according to
Halberstam, taking over the world.
In her lecture, Halberstam at
tempted to use the astoundingly
dumb film as the basis fora serious
academic examination of White
Male Stupidity, a phenomenon that
she labeled a "tool of domination"
against which academics must strug
gle. Even accepting Halberstam's
questionable argument that the film
"Dude," because of its very dumb
ness, can be used as an "unknowing
text" to reveal truths about dominant
societal paradigms, her overall
premise remains seriously flawed
and somewhat troubling.
The main problem with Halber
stam's argument is that she fails to de
fine White Male Stupidity in terms of
Whiteness or Maleness. What makes
Jesse and Chester (the dim-witted pro
tagonists of "Dude") representatives
of White Male Stupidity specifically?
Why aren't they simply representing

plain old Stupidity?
Is it because the characters are
white and male? By this logic, the film
"Romy and Michelle's High School
Reunion" would be an example of
White Female Stupidity, since the
characters are white women. By the
same token. Damon Wayans would
be a representative of Black Male Stu
pidity for his dramatic rendering of
Handi-Man, the mentally challenged
superhero on the show "In Living
Color." I submit that this type of gen
eralization is completely unwarranted
and rather offensive.
Halberstam wrongly assumes that
her entire audience is on board with
her claim that there is something par
ticularly insidious about the type of stu
pidity manifested by certain white
males, and fails to explain how one's
gender or race could possibly temper
one's basic stupidity or intelligence.
The closest that Halberstam came
to defending her claim that White
Male Stupidity is categorically differ
ent from Plain Old Stupidity was by
quoting Joseph Roach, who said that
the process of forgetting is an "oppor
tunistic tactic of whiteness." I have
never read Roach's work, so I don't
know if Halberstam is depriving the
quote of its proper context, but on the
surface, this argument fails miserably.
If forgetting is the exclusive proper
ty of maleficent white men, then how
does Halberstam explain the recent
Rwandan policy of official forgetful
ness? The Rwandan government has

enacted a policy designed to essential
ly "erase" the concept of ethnicity from
people's memories. The act of forget
ting in this case is an official tactic that
is being used opportunistically by
(non-white) Rwandan policy-makers
— many of whom were complicit in
the horrific 1994 genocide — who
would thus benefit from the Rwandan
populace's collective amnesia.
What is truly troubling to me
about the Roach quote as presented
by Halberstam is that she wasn't at
tempting to provide a justification for
her singling out of White Male Stu
pidity, she was simply using Roach's
argument to shed light on an amnesia
sequence in "Dude."
It worries me that it has become so
commonplace in academia to belittle
white males that Halberstam didn't
even think to temper her language for
fear of alienating audience members.
The ignorance and intolerance inher
ent in Halberstam's premise disturbed
me, especially since she opened her
lecture by expressing her concern
about the dearth of academics in the
public sphere. She pointed out that
media pundits like A1 Franken and
Michael Moore have replaced aca
demics as the public, political voices in
our society.
But apparently Halberstam has
bought into the punditry a bit more
than she'd like to admit, since it ap
pears that she has taken more than one
page from Moore's book "Stupid
White Men."

Although Halberstam attempted
to conceal the underlying bitterness of
her message with a cute and irreverent
approach to her subject, she not only
failed to convince me of her position
but instead made me wary about at
tending events sponsored b the Femi
nist Studies Department in the future.
Looking around at other audience
members during the lecture, I saw peo
ple tittering at Halberstam's frequent
jabs at white men, nodding and smiling
when she referred again and again to
the utter dumbness of white dudes. To
me, this is not true academic discourse,
it's narrow-minded, superficial pseu
do-intellectualism.
Halberstam's over-reliance on aca
demic jargon — she threw out con
cepts like "lived hegemony" and
"doubling effects" without providing
any theoretical framework or context
for them — does not ameliorate the
unwarranted generalizations she
made based on race and sex. Perhaps
next time she should title her talk
more honestly so that people interest
ed in real academic discourse will
know to steer clear.
My suggestion is "We Already
Know White Men are Stupid, So Lets
Have a Laugh About It." If Michael
Moore wants to attend, he can take
my seat.
