## MLB should find a way to cut advertising 
### 
Last week. Major League Baseball
approved a plan to put Spiderman 2
logos on the bases during a June se
ries between the Yankees and
Padres (damn you, interleague play).
Though the idea has since been scaled back
to a blitz including between-inning pitches,
trailers on the Jumbotron and PA an
nouncements, this highlights a troubling
trend: the smearing of advertisements all
over professional sports. As if 12-foot-tall
Michelin men presiding over the outfield
wall weren't enough, the powers that be
have decided that even the bases were not
exempt from commercialism.
Geoffrey Ammer, president of market
ing for Columbia-Tristar and the evil genius
behind this monstrosity, said that he balked
at the idea after seeing statistics saying that
81 percent of fans disapproved of it. What's
ludicrous is that Ammer, at one point, must

have thought people would
buy it.
If you're imagining the
Columbia focus groups say
ing, "Gosh, I bet baseball
fans are just dying fora
'marriage of two favorite
American pastimes:
moviegoing and baseball,'"
— exactly the phrase that
Ammer used to describe
the situation in a press re-

lease — you are probably incorrect. My
guess is that it was Ammer, sitting on a
throne built from human skulls and unsold
DVDs, saying, "Those idiots will watch any
thing. Let's just remind the drones every
waking second that Spiderman 2 is coming
out and profit from the controversy itself."
After all, any publicity is good publicity, so
even though they won't get ads on the bases,
Columbia is still getting lots of attention.
Now, I consider myself a prime example
of the average baseball fan that MLB is los
ing more of every day, and the last thing I
need is a "marriage of moviegoing and
baseball." MLB, if you're going to nakedly
abandon any pretense of respect for base
ball, then so be it, but don't try to sugarcoat
your greed.
My first instinct was to wonder how
Ammer ascended to become the marketing
king of a gigantic firm while OKing ideas that
result in 19-percent approval ratings. The
most important thing to realize here, though,
is that regardless of how repulsive such an
idea is to baseball fans, MLB will still buy it
for the right price. Advertising succeeds not
from positive impressions, but from om
nipresence; as long as it is noticed, the adver
tiser wins. Hence, MLB doesn't care what
you think. If $2.7 million is to be made by de
facing the field of play, why should they?
The easiest way to respond to this situa
tion is to say that MLB is destroying the pu
rity of the game and that they're disrespect
ing a hundred years of tradition. But it's re
ally our fault, as fans. This is an abusive re
lationship. MLB knows from experience
that its fans will come back, and it exploits
them ruthlessly.
As the advertising presence within the
game grows (stadium signage, sponsors for
every call to the bullpen and visit to the
mound), the importance of the attendee's
dollar dwindles to the point where baseball
could care less whether you choose to attend.
More and more revenue is made from televi
sion spots, corporate naming rights, rotating
ads behind the plate, and various deals out
side the ballpark than gate receipts.
Capitalism is about choice, and as long
as the consumers continue to support a
product that has watered itself down and
focused all its energies on making itself
more marketable to the ignorant and the
banal, that product will continue to flour
ish. As baseball loses young fans to the
NFL and (gag) the NBA, it wonders where
it went wrong.
Baseball executives aren't stupid —
they're doing their job of sniffing out cash,
which is not in the hands of those who appar
ently care about the game. But still, just be
cause we're halfway to seeing Van Helsing
make a relief pitching appearance or watch
ing the Detroit General Motors play the
Seattle Microsofts doesn't mean we have to
accept it.
What saddens me isn't that this is happen
ing, because when you turn a sport into a
mass-marketable commodity, advertising is
inevitable. However, when the fans accept
the corporate-sponsored ass sandwich that is
being shoved down their throats now, they
are encouraging the systematic destruction
of baseball's soul.
The only way to rectify this situation is to
make it so financially unpalatable for adver
tisers to deface the playing field that they
cease to do so. And if this means a steady
trickle of sports fans away from ballparks to
ward football stadiums, motocross
arenas,and even hockey rinks, then so be it.
Baseball will continue to endure its long,
slow death as the national pastime. But you
know what, MLB? You had it coming.
