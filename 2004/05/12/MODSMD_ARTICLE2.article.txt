### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
Justin Fishner-Wolfson, a coterminal student
in computer science, has been selected to be
ASSU financial manager and the CEO of Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE) for the 2004-
2005 year.
Fishner-Wolfson described his appointment as
an "extraordinary opportunity" given the scope
of his responsibilities next year.
"There is no other job that would allow a re
cent graduate to run an entire company and be re
sponsible fora multimillion-dollar endowment
that provides funding for an independent student
government," he said. "This position will be an
unsurpassed learning experience, as well as pro
vide an opportunity to make a positive contribu
tion to the Stanford community."
The interview process for the position is rigor
ous, with three stages â€” an initial interview with
the current CEO / financial manager and a repre
sentative from the ASSU, followed by a written
portion and finally a business plan presented to
the CEO selection committee defining the candi
date's priorities for SSE in the upcoming year.
According to Kyle Alisharan, the outgoing
CEO and financial manager, selection criteria for
the position includes significant independent
leadership experience and demonstrated skills in
numerical analysis, project management and
team building.

Fishner-Wolfson was the final selection from a
pool of seven candidates who Alisharan de
scribed as "truly outstanding."
"It was his entrepreneurial spirit, intelligence,
keen business sense," Alisharan said. "He has
great ideas for strengthening the organization
while building on our successes this year."
Fishner-Wolfson was born in Chicago and has
lived in Chapel Hill, N.C. and Piano, Texas. One
of the highlights of Fishner-Wolfson's extensive
work experience was at Texas Instruments,
where he worked to develop a system to track
production and pricing information and train
business units, factories and assembly/test facili
ties worldwide.
Fishner-Wolfson said he plans on continuing
the positive work done in SSE this year, particu
larly relating to the special-fees system. He in
tends to reinvigorate core business and de-em
phasize the non-strategic services SSE offers in
order to increase profits that will be reinvested
in products and services the Stanford communi
ty needs.
He also expressed optimism about working
with the new SSE team.
"I am fortunate to have an exceptional group
of people working with me to continue to build
SSE into a stronger organization," he said. "I
know that there is much to be gained from this ex
perience and expect the entire SSE team will
learn a great deal about business, competition,
community and service."
