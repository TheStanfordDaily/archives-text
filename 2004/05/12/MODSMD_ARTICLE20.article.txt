# No. 2 Card defeats SCU
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
David O'Hagan is so calm when he
enters the game that he only focuses on
the batter — and nothing else distracts
him. So when the Stanford closer en
tered the game Monday night with the
bases loaded, none out and his team
ahead in the eighth inning, O'Hagan
didn't even flinch.
He embraced the challenge.
The senior right-hander got the Car
dinal out of a huge jam by retiring the
next three batters and then pitched a
perfect ninth for his fifth save as Stan
ford beat Santa Clara, 3-1, last night at
Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal (38-8), which dropped
to No. 2 in the Baseball America poll
after losing two-of-three to Washington
over the weekend, rebounded nicely in
the place where it's most comfortable.
Stanford ran its home winning streak to
15 games and is now 22-1 at Sunken Di
amond, with its only loss coming to cur
rent No. 1 Texas.
As with most Tuesday games, Stan
ford manager Mark Marquess used a
bevy of arms.
The Cardinal used seven pitchers and
no pitcher threw more than two innings.
"It was good to get guys that hadn't
pitched much some work," Marquess
said. "The Tuesday game forces you to
get them some innings."
Freshman Blake Holler (4-2) pitched
an effective first inning and was credited
with the win when his team scored all three
of its runs in the bottom of the frame.
Jeff Stimpson and Kodiak Quick
pitched two innings of shutout ball each,
then Mark Jecmen and Pete Duda threw
one scoreless inning each.
Santa Clara only had one hit through
seven innings.
Then Marquess inserted sophomore
reliever Matt Manship, who threw
upwards of 40 pitches in Sunday's loss
to Washington.
His fatigue showed.
Manship gave up a leadoff home run
to pinch-hitter Nathan Faulkner, then
two Santa Clara singles and a hit batsman
loaded the bases with none out and Stan
ford clinging precariously to a 3-1 lead.
Enter O'Hagan, who has been Stan
ford's most effective and most consis
tent reliever all year long.
A key to O'Hagan's success this

spring has been the take-no-prisoners at
titude he displays on the mound. That's
exactly what he was thinking when he
stepped onto the mound to face Santa
Clara pinch-hitter Shawn Epidendio.
"The best thing about pitching is that
you have the ball in your hand, so you
control when the play starts," he said.
"I've been in this kind of situation be
fore. I like to go as hard as I can fora
short amount of time."
O'Hagan struck out Epidendio on a
nasty breaking ball on the inside.
Santa Clara's leading hitter, Nic
Crosta, then hit a pop-up that was
dropped by Brian Hall in fair ground —
but with the bases loaded, the infield fly
rule was invoked, and Hall was credited
with a putout.

Then, for the last act of his magic tri
fecta, O'Hagan induced Broncos
cleanup hitter Michael Thompson into a
groundout to second.
No sweat, right?
"To be honest, the hitter feels just as
much pressure as the pitcher because he
doesn't want to be the guy to strike out
in the key situation," he said.
Stanford scored all three of its runs in
the first inning. Danny Putnam hit a two
run double and Donny Lucy knocked in
Putnam with a double of his own.
But fora team that scored 42 runs against
the Broncos in three previous meetings, it
was a continuing of a recent trend.
The offense, relatively speaking, has
been cooling off recently.
For the third time in four games,

Stanford didn't reach double digits in
hits. This is from a team that has reached
double figures in hits in 36 of its 45
games and is only eight points shy of the
all-time single-season school record for
team batting average (.337).
The final meeting of the four game
series with the Broncos — which Stan
ford swept — was a far cry from the
other games. In the first two games,
Stanford pounded Santa Clara, 18-4 and
12-3, respectively.
Then, three weeks ago, Stanford beat
Santa Clara 12-8 in its longest game of
the season (five hours and 18 minutes).
But with all the effective pitching and
only nine hits combined between the two

teams, this game went only 2:23.
Putnum had his team-leading
25th multiple-hit game of the sea
son with his double and a third-in
ning single.
Brian Hall, who was hitting
.561 in Pac-10 play entering the
game and had struck out only nine
times in 15 conference games,

went 0-for-2 with two strikeouts.
Marquess said third baseman
Jonny Ash, who has been out of
the lineup since April 20 with a
hairline fracture of his right index
finger, will see a doctor either
today or tomorrow fora re-evalu
ation. If he's cleared, he could
begin workouts and possibly be in
the line-up this weekend.
First baseman John Mayberry
Jr. is still day-to-day with a left
shoulder bruise.
The Cardinal will play in Tuc

game series beginning Saturday.

The offense, relatively speaking, has

For the third time in four games,

Stanford didn't reach double digits in
hits. This is from a team that has reached
double figures in hits in 36 of its 45
games and is only eight points shy of the
all-time single-season school record for
team batting average (.337).
The final meeting of the four game
series with the Broncos — which Stan
ford swept — was a far cry from the
other games. In the first two games,
Stanford pounded Santa Clara, 18-4 and
12-3, respectively.
Then, three weeks ago, Stanford beat
Santa Clara 12-8 in its longest game of
the season (five hours and 18 minutes).

teams, this game went only 2:23.
Putnum had his team-leading
25th multiple-hit game of the sea
son with his double and a third-in
ning single.
Brian Hall, who was hitting
.561 in Pac-10 play entering the
game and had struck out only nine
times in 15 conference games,

went 0-for-2 with two strikeouts.
Marquess said third baseman
Jonny Ash, who has been out of
the lineup since April 20 with a
hairline fracture of his right index
finger, will see a doctor either
today or tomorrow fora re-evalu
ation. If he's cleared, he could
begin workouts and possibly be in
the line-up this weekend.
First baseman John Mayberry
Jr. is still day-to-day with a left
shoulder bruise.
The Cardinal will play in Tuc
son against Arizona fora three
game series beginning Saturday.
David O'Hagan is so calm when he
enters the game that he only focuses on
the batter — and nothing else distracts
him. So when the Stanford closer en
tered the game Monday night with the
bases loaded, none out and his team
ahead in the eighth inning, O'Hagan
didn't even flinch.
He embraced the challenge.
The senior right-hander got the Car
dinal out of a huge jam by retiring the
next three batters and then pitched a
perfect ninth for his fifth save as Stan
ford beat Santa Clara, 3-1, last night at
Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal (38-8), which dropped
to No. 2 in the Baseball America poll
after losing two-of-three to Washington
over the weekend, rebounded nicely in
the place where it's most comfortable.
Stanford ran its home winning streak to
15 games and is now 22-1 at Sunken Di
amond, with its only loss coming to cur
rent No. 1 Texas.
As with most Tuesday games, Stan
ford manager Mark Marquess used a
bevy of arms.
The Cardinal used seven pitchers and
no pitcher threw more than two innings.
"It was good to get guys that hadn't
pitched much some work," Marquess
said. "The Tuesday game forces you to
get them some innings."
Freshman Blake Holler (4-2) pitched
an effective first inning and was credited
with the win when his team scored all three
of its runs in the bottom of the frame.
Jeff Stimpson and Kodiak Quick
pitched two innings of shutout ball each,
then Mark Jecmen and Pete Duda threw
one scoreless inning each.
Santa Clara only had one hit through
seven innings.
Then Marquess inserted sophomore
reliever Matt Manship, who threw
upwards of 40 pitches in Sunday's loss
to Washington.
His fatigue showed.
Manship gave up a leadoff home run
to pinch-hitter Nathan Faulkner, then
two Santa Clara singles and a hit batsman
loaded the bases with none out and Stan
ford clinging precariously to a 3-1 lead.
Enter O'Hagan, who has been Stan
ford's most effective and most consis
tent reliever all year long.
A key to O'Hagan's success this

spring has been the take-no-prisoners at
titude he displays on the mound. That's
exactly what he was thinking when he
stepped onto the mound to face Santa
Clara pinch-hitter Shawn Epidendio.
"The best thing about pitching is that
you have the ball in your hand, so you
control when the play starts," he said.
"I've been in this kind of situation be
fore. I like to go as hard as I can fora
short amount of time."
O'Hagan struck out Epidendio on a
nasty breaking ball on the inside.
Santa Clara's leading hitter, Nic
Crosta, then hit a pop-up that was
dropped by Brian Hall in fair ground —
but with the bases loaded, the infield fly
rule was invoked, and Hall was credited
with a putout.

Then, for the last act of his magic tri
fecta, O'Hagan induced Broncos
cleanup hitter Michael Thompson into a
groundout to second.
No sweat, right?
"To be honest, the hitter feels just as
much pressure as the pitcher because he
doesn't want to be the guy to strike out
in the key situation," he said.
Stanford scored all three of its runs in
the first inning. Danny Putnam hit a two
run double and Donny Lucy knocked in
Putnam with a double of his own.
