# Baseball avoids losing streak
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Heading into last night's nonconference tilt with
Santa Clara, the No. 2 Stanford baseball team had five
winning streaks of five games or more to its credit and
nary a two-game skid.
With a 3-1 victory on the heels of a loss to Washing
ton, the Cardinal kept it that way and hopes it sparked
another long string of Ws in the process.
"It's our goal to win every game, and when you lose
one, you don't want anything to snowball," said sopho
more shortstop Chris Minaker. "You don't even want
to give it a chance. The way we look at it is that if we
don't lose two in a row, we're hopefully winning two
out of three. When we get into playoff time, you have
to win two before you lose two, so that's the attitude we
take all year long just to be ready."
Four of the Cardinal's eight losses this season have
come in the final game of a series, including three loss
es on Sunday and one on Saturday in the second half of
a home-and-home series with Sacramento State. Last
night's win pushed the Cardinal's record in Tuesday
games to 7-0.
The only Stanford team to finish a season without
suffering back-to-back losses was the 1967 squad
that finished 36-6-1 and tied for third at the College
World Series.
Stanford has not lost two straight since late April of last
season, when it dropped the final game of a three-game se
ries against Arizona and was then shutout by Santa Clara,
2-0, two days later. The 2003 Cardinal also lost three
straight at Cal State-Fullerton early in the season.
The Broncos made a bid to deal the Cardinal con
secutive losses two weeks ago when Stanford headed
into Buck Shaw Stadium fresh off its loss to Sacramen
to State. Five hours, 18 minutes and 14 innings later,
Stanford emerged with a 12-8 victory.
However fatigued the team may have been after
that marathon, the momentum seemed to carry over
into a three-game sweep of Washington State the
next weekend.
The Cardinal took care of business in about half the
time last night, gathering steam fora three-game show
down at Arizona one week after dropping its first series
of the season against second-place Washington.
"I think the importance of [last night's game] was
just to make sure we got our intensity back at the right
level," Minaker said. "Coming off [the series) in Wash
ington, it could have been a big letdown."
Duda debuts;
Santa Clara's Matteucci, too
Sophomore right-hander Pete Duda made his first
career appearance in a Stanford uniform, pitching one

inning of perfect baseball after taking over in the top of
the seventh with the Cardinal leading, 3-0. The Bay
onne, N.J., native was brought along slowly and did not
see any action as a freshman after suffering an arm in
jury late in his prep career.
"It was just exciting to get out there," Duda said.
"I've been working real hard at it and it was nice to get
out there and help the team out. There was a lot of
adrenaline pumping."

got a little help from his defense. Shortstop Chris Mi

the diamond to get Thompson by
half a step.
"The first two balls I threw
were a relief," Duda said. "When
Minaker made that awesome play
to get the first out, that was anoth
er big relief. And once I got that
behind me, it made me feel a little
bit better."
Added Minaker: "It felt good
to make a play behind Pete just be
cause it was his first time out there.
He did a real good job, but it was
good to get that first out for him."
Will Thompson followed with a

deep drive to left field that Danny
Putnam ran down on the warning
track. Duda managed to retire the
final hitter of the inning in less
dramatic fashion, as Dustin Reali
ni grounded out to short. An ener
getic line of high-fives greeted
Duda as he sprinted off the field.
Duda was not the only player to
make his first pitching appearance
last night. Santa Clara's Jason Mat
teucci, who started the game at
designated hitter and is hitting .280
this season, came on in relief of
starter Bryan Fleming with two
outs in the fifth inning, two runners
on and Putnam at the plate. Put

field, but Nic Crosta made a diving
catch to save a couple of runs and
end the inning. Matteucci was lift

start of the next inning.

"I think the importance of [last night's game] was
just to make sure we got our intensity back at the right
level," Minaker said. "Coming off [the series) in Wash
ington, it could have been a big letdown."
Duda debuts;
Santa Clara's Matteucci, too
Sophomore right-hander Pete Duda made his first
career appearance in a Stanford uniform, pitching one

inning of perfect baseball after taking over in the top of
the seventh with the Cardinal leading, 3-0. The Bay
onne, N.J., native was brought along slowly and did not
see any action as a freshman after suffering an arm in
jury late in his prep career.
"It was just exciting to get out there," Duda said.
"I've been working real hard at it and it was nice to get
out there and help the team out. There was a lot of
adrenaline pumping."

his feet and rifled a strike across
the diamond to get Thompson by
half a step.
"The first two balls I threw
were a relief," Duda said. "When
Minaker made that awesome play
to get the first out, that was anoth
er big relief. And once I got that
behind me, it made me feel a little
bit better."
Added Minaker: "It felt good
to make a play behind Pete just be
cause it was his first time out there.
He did a real good job, but it was
good to get that first out for him."
Will Thompson followed with a

deep drive to left field that Danny
Putnam ran down on the warning
track. Duda managed to retire the
final hitter of the inning in less
dramatic fashion, as Dustin Reali
ni grounded out to short. An ener
getic line of high-fives greeted
Duda as he sprinted off the field.
Duda was not the only player to
make his first pitching appearance
last night. Santa Clara's Jason Mat
teucci, who started the game at
designated hitter and is hitting .280
this season, came on in relief of
starter Bryan Fleming with two
outs in the fifth inning, two runners
on and Putnam at the plate. Put

field, but Nic Crosta made a diving
catch to save a couple of runs and
end the inning. Matteucci was lift

start of the next inning.
Heading into last night's nonconference tilt with
Santa Clara, the No. 2 Stanford baseball team had five
winning streaks of five games or more to its credit and
nary a two-game skid.
With a 3-1 victory on the heels of a loss to Washing
ton, the Cardinal kept it that way and hopes it sparked
another long string of Ws in the process.
"It's our goal to win every game, and when you lose
one, you don't want anything to snowball," said sopho
more shortstop Chris Minaker. "You don't even want
to give it a chance. The way we look at it is that if we
don't lose two in a row, we're hopefully winning two
out of three. When we get into playoff time, you have
to win two before you lose two, so that's the attitude we
take all year long just to be ready."
Four of the Cardinal's eight losses this season have
come in the final game of a series, including three loss
es on Sunday and one on Saturday in the second half of
a home-and-home series with Sacramento State. Last
night's win pushed the Cardinal's record in Tuesday
games to 7-0.
The only Stanford team to finish a season without
suffering back-to-back losses was the 1967 squad
that finished 36-6-1 and tied for third at the College
World Series.
Stanford has not lost two straight since late April of last
season, when it dropped the final game of a three-game se
ries against Arizona and was then shutout by Santa Clara,
2-0, two days later. The 2003 Cardinal also lost three
straight at Cal State-Fullerton early in the season.
The Broncos made a bid to deal the Cardinal con
secutive losses two weeks ago when Stanford headed
into Buck Shaw Stadium fresh off its loss to Sacramen
to State. Five hours, 18 minutes and 14 innings later,
Stanford emerged with a 12-8 victory.
However fatigued the team may have been after
that marathon, the momentum seemed to carry over
into a three-game sweep of Washington State the
next weekend.
The Cardinal took care of business in about half the
time last night, gathering steam fora three-game show
down at Arizona one week after dropping its first series
of the season against second-place Washington.
"I think the importance of [last night's game] was
just to make sure we got our intensity back at the right
level," Minaker said. "Coming off [the series) in Wash
