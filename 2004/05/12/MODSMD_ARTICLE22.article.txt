### THOMAS TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER Badminton 
At the Collegiate Nationals on campus last
weekend, the Stanford badminton team turned in
a solid fourth place finish. California schools
dominated the competition in general, with UC-
Irvine, UC-Berkeley and UC-San Diego finishing
ahead of Stanford.
Notable results from the team's strong pres
ence include graduate students Jay Simon and
Oren Shiran taking third in the men's doubles,
followed by sophomores David Wang and
Mike Nguyen in fourth. Additionally, Tianli
Chu took first place in the men's exhibition
singles competition.
Ultimate Frisbee
At last weekend's Northwest Regional Tour
nament in Corvallis, Ore., both the men's and
women's teams (named Bloodthirsty and Super
fly, respectively) won bids to the National Cham
pionships. It wasn't a perfect weekend, with both
teams losing tight games in the finals, but through
a "backdoor" additional game they each managed
to snag nationals tickets.
Bloodthirsty was knocked off by top-ranked
California, 15-11, in the final, but then came back
to crush the University of British Columbia, 15-8,
in the backdoor final to finish second in the
Northwest Region. Meanwhile, Superfly was de
feated by UC-Davis, 15-10, but responded with a
15-8 victory over arch-rival Cal.
The Stanford men will now be battling for their
second national title in three years.
The Collegiate National Ultimate Frisbee
Championships will be held in Seattle, Wash.,
over Memorial Day weekend.
