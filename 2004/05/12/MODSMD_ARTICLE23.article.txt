# Nike makes Bret's childhood dreams come true with new ad campaign
## 
### 
It s like they read our minds. Randy Johnson, a
championship bowler. Serena Williams, a dominat
ing beach volleyball player. Lance Armstrong,
Ihe Texas lickler. Everyone's had these conver
sations before: Throw Clemens in a rodeo and see what
happens. Toss Michael Andretti in a bobsled and see
how dominating the United States will be at the next
Winter Olympics. Nike just put it on the screen.
The What It? campaign Nike recently unveiled
builds off of the winter's videogame reenactment fea
turing Michael Vick and Terrell Owens juking, power
bursting, bullet passing and hurdling overly tenacious
defenders. The most recent pitch throws together a
handlul of the world s greatest male and female athletes
playing a sport that's probably totally foreign to them,
bringing to life all the scenarios we've daydreamed
about since first grade.
Despite any explanation of the television spot besides
a swoosh filling the screen, the message is resoundigly
clear. T he heart of a champion, the superhuman, success.
That's Nike. What can't you do in a swooshed shirt?
Clearly the message is not entirely realistic. Michael
Jordan could do anything on the basketball court, but he
couldn't hit a curveball out of Don Zimmer's paw. Bo
Jackson tore up the gridiron and the diamond for nearly
a decade, but Nike made millions subliminally jesting at
his ability to swing a golf club or tennis racquet.
In the respect of athletic role shifting, it is only ap
propriate to assemble the group of the top athletes to
still realistically succeed if their primary sport did not

exist. I start with none other than Red Sox outfielder
Johnny Damon.
The fleet-footed centerfielder has the speed and
natural instinct to track down balls we wouldn't be-

lieve catchable in our wildest
dreams. He also features a 30-mph
arm that wouldn't throw out his own
son on a sacrifice fly on a little
league diamond. Additionally, he
possesses the brain power of the very
Neanderthal he physically resem
bles, often running into teammates,
laughing after strikeouts, and sprint
ing from first to third on infield pop
ups with no outs. His loyalty is un
heralded. Last Monday after team-

mate Manny Ramirez blasted a 460-foot home run
five rows from exiting Jacobs Field and got into a
verbal lashing with the pitcher for admiring his
clout. Damon jumped to his aid and added, "Manny
deserves to pimp. I hope to see him pimp a lot more
this year."
His shaggy cut places him closer to a sheep dog than
The Last Samurai. For Damon's loyalty, ability only to
catch, likeable yet dense demeanor and physical ap
pearance, it is clear Damon is poised to become the
most decorated Frisbee-catching champion The Great
Outdoor Games and the Outdoor Life Network have
ever witnessed.
Next up, Shaquille O'Neal. Shaq has been the most

physically dominating player in the NBA for years. The
man owns anything inside the key: he'll box you out until
you're at the 3-point line. Shaq's game features light
ning-quick spin moves to elude defenders, ferociously
aggressive attacks on the rim and a free throw style that
turns even the sturdiest of stomachs. He sweats nearly a
gallon a minute in competition and pounds Nestle
Crunch bars for energy. He knows the fighting ways of
the Orient from his video game Shaq-Fu and his raps
highly resemble a foreign language. Add to these traits a
sneaker line featured at Wal-Mart that no one would be
caught dead wearing and it is clear that without the NBA
Shaq is bound fora glorious career in the barefoot sport
of sumo wrestling.
Roger Clemens. The ace. Features one of the biggest
bulldog staredowns in sport. He's also one of the most in
telligent athletes out there competing. Growing increas
ingly tired of the Boston atmosphere in the mid '90s, he
posted a few "sub-Cy Young seasons" poor enough to
convince the front office he'd lost it for good.
A trade to the Blue Jays and 20 million dollars later,
Clemens "magically regained" Cy Young status. He also
possesses the ability to leave the game early with a "groin
pull" or "ankle discomfort" when in tough situation be
fore he gets really roughed up. The man's simple ability
to win is unfounded. Name a situation when he hasn't
come out on top in the end. Got a ring with the Yanks,
pulled 300 wins, had the good guys and the Evil Empire
love him en route to striking out 4,000-plus.
It is clear that, without baseball, Clemens would still

be on ESPN most nights as ringleader of the World Se
ries of Poker. He's got the staredown, he knows early
when to fold, and the guy always comes out on top. Look
out Stu Unger.
Michael Andretti. Andretti possesses one of the most
outstanding records in racing history, and carries a name
synonymous with excellence. He holds all-time records
for career wins and laps led over a 20-year career. He re
tired in 2003 to run the family's $10 million business in
terests. He commercialized the racing world, and led the
United States to victory.
Andretti is poised for placement in the cockpit on the
U.S. Bobsled team. Singlehandedly he can steer the
United States, to the top of the world ranks, past the
dreaded German powerhouse and never look back from
setting track and lap records for years to come. Bobsled
will turn into a multi-million-dollar sport Americans of
all ages shapes and sizes will enjoy.
Odds are Nike's not going to sign Damon, Shaq,
Clemens or Andretti anytime soon, so the shot at seeing
a more representative advertisement of cross-sport hy
brid athletes is minimal. But as far-fetched as Marion
Jones launching off a gymnastics vault or Michael Vick
and Brian Urlacher heading up an NHL line may seem,
the athletes are out there and the "What if?" in our heads
is not as ridiculous as it may seem.
