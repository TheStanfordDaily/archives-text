## UCLA's Taco Bell fails to turn in report on labor 
### SHAUN BISHOP DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES — Taco Bell failed to
submit a report on tomato pickers' working conditions
by Monday, breaking an agreement made with the
University of California-Los Angeles nearly six
months ago and threatening the popular eatery's fu
ture on campus.
The Associated Students of UCLA — which man
ages Taco Bell and other on-campus restaurants — told
the fastfood giant to investigate complaints of unfair
labor practices originating from employees of the restau
rant's tomato suppliers.
The tomato pickers, located in the Immokalee region
of Florida, complained of low wages, poor working con

ditions and being forced to work overtime without pay.
Laurie Schalow, spokeswoman for Taco Bell, said
earlier last month that the restaurant was on target to
have the report in by the deadline.
But Bob Williams, interim executive director of
ASUCLA, said Monday that the association, which orig
inally requested the report in December, had not re
ceived anything from Taco Bell.
Without the report, Taco Bell faces losing its contract
to operate on campus.
Schalow confirmed that Taco Bell had not submitted
a report as of early Monday afternoon, but said she was
scheduled to speak on the phone with Williams to discuss
the situation and declined further comment. She could
not be reached at the end of the day.
The Mexican eatery had also asked the ASUCLA

board of directors fora 30-day extension on the report's
deadline three weeks ago but declined to state a reason
why. The association denied the request, with several
board members critical of the restaurant's progress on
its promise.
Under the agreement, Taco Bell was supposed to
hire a third-party investigator approved by the Coali
tion of Immokalee Workers, a worker's rights orga
nization that is also spearheading a boycott against
the restaurant.
But as of Monday, Nick Laskowski, a volunteer with
the coalition, said Taco Bell has had nocontact with CI W
regarding the situation at UCLA.
"Taco Bell is not interested in talking to us. They
haven't been, and they won't be," Laskowski said.
While he said he isn't surprised that Taco Bell hasn't

contacted the CIW, Laskowski said he had hoped the
restaurant would be more responsive to the issues facing
UCLA's location.
Roy Champawat, associate director of on-campus
restaurants, noted Taco Bell's request for an extension
three weeks ago as a consideration for the report's fail
ure to be submitted.
"I know they had asked fora little more time, so ob
viously they were a little pressed," Champawat said.
Taco Bell is one of the most popular eating establish
ments on campus, serving more than 1,000 customers
per day.
Students at other universities across the country, in
cluding Notre Dame and the University of Florida, have
held multi-day hunger strikes to support the removal of
the restaurant on their own campuses.
