(U-WIRE) ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. —
As the war rages in Iraq, many college stu
dents have become more concerned about
their uncertain future, this according to a
Harvard University Study.
A national poll conducted by researchers
at Harvard's Institute of Politics showed
that out of 1,205 college students polled,
John Kerry has a 48 percent approval rate
compared to a 38 percent approval rate for
President George W. Bush.
"Dissatisfaction with the war in Iraq, a
continued weak job market and the presi
dent's opposition to gay marriage appear to
be moving students toward Sen. Kerry,"
said Dan Glickman, director for Harvard's
Institute of Politics.
Among college students, support for the
war has dropped, two-thirds believe that
they will have a hard time finding a job
after graduation, and many support gay
marriage. This compiled with the fact that
62 percent of college students polled indi

cated that they plan on voting in the up
coming election, led researchers to say that
the candidates must begin to reach out to
the nearly 5.1 million college students in
the United States.
Although many students are leaning to
ward Kerry, it was made clear that nearly 40
percent felt that they did not know enough
about the senator from Massachusetts.
Kerry appears to be well aware of this
problem and plans on launching a new ad
vertising campaign aimed on defining him
self to the American public.
"A lot of people don't really know who I
am. The level of communication we need to
establish here is enormous," Kerry said at a
fund-raising breakfast.
Kerry plans on sweeping colleges across
the country, which included a visit to
Howard University in Washington. During
his college tour Kerry will focus on promot
ing his plan to give a free college education
to students who agree to public service.
Even with this important issue at the helm,
questions about the Iraq war have taken
precedence over all else.

Students are raising tough questions on
his and Bush's policies concerning the war.
The Iraq war is a touchy issue for Kerry who
actually voted in 2002 for the congressional
resolution that authorized Bush to utilize
force in Iraq. Since the start of the war a lit
tle more than a year ago, Kerry has begun to
become more critical of Bush's manage
ment of the war, but is trying to remain sup
portive of the operation.
Kerry claims that stability in Iraq is his
top priority and indicates that he does not
support the immediate withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Iraq.
"I think the vast majority of the Ameri
can people understand that it's important to
not just cut and run. I don't believe in a cut
and-run philosophy," Kerry said.
With more than six months to go before
the Nov. 2 election, this is a crucial time for
both Bush and Kerry to establish and main
tain their credibility concerning the war in
Iraq and other important issues to voters.
The candidate that wins the public's trust
may well be the candidate to win the up
coming election.
