# Three freshmen's luck of the draw
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three freshman girls living in
Gavilan received the thrill of
which most Stanford students
only dream when the spring hous
ing season comes along — Draw
number 0001.
Freshman Sonia Nagala en
tered the Draw with the expecta
tion that — like most other fresh
men — her Draw group would
receive a decent lottery number,
low enough to be able to live in
Toyon Hall. She never expected
that she and her other two draw
mates, Eileen Ho and Sarah Fair
bank, also freshmen, would re
ceive the covetous number one
spot and the option to live in lit
erally any undergraduate resi
dence on campus.
"We definitely weren't expect
ing to draw very well," Nagala
said. "We didn't expect too much,
and I think that's what makes get
ting number one feel so great."
In fact, the group had even
considered the prospects of get
ting the highest — and therefore
worst — preferred numbers pos
sible in the Draw.
"We had a lot of Draw drama
in our dorm and were positive
that we would be cursed or
jinxed," Fairbank said. "In fact.

we even made fun of ourselves
and decided that we would be
living in FloMo again next year
for sure."
Nagala first discovered her
Draw number when she had her
older sister Sarala Nagala, a ju
nior, look up the housing informa
tion on Axess.

"I thought she [Sarala] was just
kidding, but when I finally be
lieved her I started screaming and
woke up Eileen and Sarah," Na
gala said. "We were basically
screaming and jumping around
fora good hour after we found out

we got no. 1. It was such a memorable moment
— definitely one of the highlights I will have
here at Stanford."
Fairbank and Ho were equally shocked and
surprised upon discovering their good luck in
the housing Draw.
"I can't even describe the full extent of my
excitement when I saw 'Your number is 0001'
on the housing Web site," Fairbank said. "I'm
not usually superstitious, but the night before
we found out draw numbers, Sonia and I ate at
PF Chang's and my fortune cookie read 'Luck
will be yours when you least expect it.' I
laughed it off at the time. All I can say now is

never underestimate a fortune cookie. There
may be more truth to it then there initially ap
pears to be."
The group has yet to decide where they
want to live. After visiting Toyon and the Row
houses Bob and Xanadu, they have narrowed
down their choices to either Bob or Xanadu.
Fairbank explained that her Draw group is
leaning more towards Bob, since the house
has "the potential of being a very social and
fun environment for next year," though the
group has not reached a final decision.
"A lot will depend on in which place we'll
have better luck with the in-house Draw," Na
gala said. "At this point, I don't think we
could go wrong in either place."
Due to several glitches in the computerized
lottery system, the announcement of Draw
numbers was delayed. However, group mem
bers said the extra anticipation made the news
even mpre rewarding.
Nagala, Fairbank and Ho, though excited

to have won the number one spot, said they
are even more thrilled to have won it together
as a group.
"Even if we hadn't drawn number one, I
know we would still be happy wherever we
would be," Nagala said. "I admit it's really
awesome to win the draw, but all that really
matters is that we are together. 1 can't wait
until next year!"
