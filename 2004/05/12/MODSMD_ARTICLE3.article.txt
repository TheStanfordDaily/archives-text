# Three freshmen's luck of the draw

### ALIYYA HAQUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three freshman girls living in
Gavilan received the thrill of
which most Stanford students
only dream when the spring hous
ing season comes along — Draw
number 0001.
Freshman Sonia Nagala en
tered the Draw with the expecta
tion that — like most other fresh
men — her Draw group would
receive a decent lottery number,
low enough to be able to live in
Toyon Hall. She never expected
that she and her other two draw
mates, Eileen Ho and Sarah Fair
bank, also freshmen, would re
ceive the covetous number one
spot and the option to live in lit
erally any undergraduate resi
dence on campus.
"We definitely weren't expect
ing to draw very well," Nagala
said. "We didn't expect too much,
and I think that's what makes get
ting number one feel so great."
In fact, the group had even
considered the prospects of get
ting the highest — and therefore
worst — preferred numbers pos
sible in the Draw.
"We had a lot of Draw drama
in our dorm and were positive
that we would be cursed or
jinxed," Fairbank said. "In fact.

we even made fun of ourselves
and decided that we would be
living in FloMo again next year
for sure."
Nagala first discovered her
Draw number when she had her
older sister Sarala Nagala, a ju
nior, look up the housing informa
tion on Axess.

"I thought she [Sarala] was just
kidding, but when I finally be
lieved her I started screaming and
woke up Eileen and Sarah," Na
gala said. "We were basically
screaming and jumping around
fora good hour after we found out
