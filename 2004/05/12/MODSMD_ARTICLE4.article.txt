It's a breezy spring afternoon as students lounge in
the sun, surfing the Internet. That's right, surfing the In
ternet outdoors. Wireless Internet has become the latest
craze on campus since the free service was made avail
able in all dorms and departments. Wireless is now also
available on the half-mile strip of University Ave. clos
est to campus fora small fee.
However, it seems unlikely that students will
pay fora service downtown that they receive for
free on campus.
Max Vangeli, executive vice president of sales at An
chor Free, said that his company is the first in all of
northern California to offer wireless Internet to an en
tire downtown area.
"We want to give people the freedom to not be tied
down to a Starbucks," Vangeli said of the company's
service, which is being offered for $4.99 a month.
Torrefazione Italian Coffee Cafe is one of the Uni
versity Ave. locations that will now offer wireless
through Anchor Free.
Rafael Xavier, assistant manager at Torrefazione,
said, "[Wireless is] a courtesy to extend to customers
who might want to check their e-mail on their lunch
break or look up movie times."
Anchor Free hopes to also entice students off campus
with wireless access at low prices; the company's goal is
to eventually expand to all of Palo Alto.
Despite the low cost, most students agree that they
would not use AnchorFree's services unless they were
free. Karl Goodman, a junior who does not use wireless,
said that the new services did not entice him to go down
town, but they did make him consider getting a laptop
with wireless capabilities.
Junior Arturo Caballero, the resident computer
consultant (RCC) at Casa Zapata, said, "I could just go
to the Co Ho. Of course, [the Co Ho doesn't] have pani

ni sandwiches."
Freshman Rebecca Pratt said that wireless was be
coming more necessary for classes and her job.
"I initially thought I wouldn't need it, but now I'm
considering making the investment," Pratt said.
Earlier this year, RCCs were given a handful of wire
less cards to hand out to their residents for the remain
der of the year, the only cost being a survey on how stu
dents liked using the card.
"[Wireless is] really convenient," Caballero said. "Of
course, you need a laptop for it to be worthwhile, [and]
it's often not as fast as regular Internet."
Junior Jonathan Huang said he uses his wireless "at
least 24 hours a day, possibly more" and said that Inter
net usage is becoming as essential to student life as cell
phones.
"[Students] would be lost without their Internet"
Huang said.
Deedee Perez-Granados, an resident fellow at Casa
Zapata and a faculty member in the School of Educa
tion, said wireless access at Stanford is important be
cause it creates more venues for students to do their
work.
"Students can study in their room or at the library,
but wireless makes these options limitless" Perez-
Granados said. "It's been really helpful in class. I take
my work wherever I want to be, from the moment I
wake up until midnight."
Yet even Perez-Granados said she was not enticed
by AnchorFree's and Torrefazione's services.
"When I go off-campus I want to get away from my
work," Perez-Granados said. "[Even] when I go off
campus to work, I want to be away from email, to iso
late myself."
Caballero argued that Torrefazione should make its
wireless service free.
"Students would go all the time, get hungry and
buy a panini," he said. "They'd make more money
that way."
