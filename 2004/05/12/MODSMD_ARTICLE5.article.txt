# Interdisciplinary project pieces together third-century Roman map

Stanford professors and students have been
working to piece together an ancient map of Rome
as part of the Forma Urbis Romae Project, which
brings together the Departments of Computer Sci
ence and Classics. The project, which began in 1999,
uses advanced computer technology to reconstruct
"the world's oldest jigsaw puzzle" â€” an enormous
and detailed marble map of Rome as it existed in the
third century CE.
The map, which is also called the Severan Mar
ble Plan of Rome, has been in the hands of archeol
ogists since the 16th century. The 1,186 fragments
currently being catalogued make up an estimated
10 to 15 percent of the original, which depicted the
ancient Roman capital in great detail. However,
piecing together the fragments proved to be an
enormous task. Before Stanford's Digital Forum

Project took over, archeologists working by hand
found matches at the rate of about one every few
years. The Stanford project now averages one
match per month, compressing decades' worth of
progress into a span of weeks.
Designer David Koller explained that the pro
gram attacks the puzzle from multiple angles. A
computer looks at several features of each fragment
when searching for its neighbor.
"The first technique we tried used the shape of
the fractured geometry on the edges of the frag
ments, and the computer searched our database of 3-
D scans of the fragments to find matching fracture
shapes," Koller explained. "Unfortunately, many of
the edges are very heavily eroded."
Another algorithm looks at the features of the
map itself, tracing carved lines depicting walls,
streets and aqueducts onto companion pieces.
"The computer searches the other fragments for
ones that have the same features intersecting their

boundary at the same angles," Koller explained.
"Using this technique, I've found about 10 new
matches among the fragments."
A third algorithm exploits information about the
wall on which the map originally hung.
"Scholars have made detailed measurements of
the clamp holes and other features which held the
marble slabs onto the wall," Koller said. The pro
gram searches the database for these marks as well.
"Some of my recent work has involved tying all of
these different types of matching algorithms into a
single framework so that the computer can combine
all these clues," he added. "In the last year, we've
found about a dozen new matches."
According to Computer Science Prof. Marc
Levoy, the project's goal is two-fold: on the one
hand, its aim is to reconstruct as much of the map as
possible. The larger goal, however, is to create a
comprehensive fragment database of unprecedent
ed size.

The final result will be approximately 100 times
bigger than any other three-dimensional online
database, incorporating huge numbers of polygons
which store information about three-dimensional
objects. So far, three billion out of an estimated
eight billion of these polygons have been up
loaded. Levoy called progress on the database
"slow but steady."
Levoy said he hopes that making the information
available on the Web will mean that others can par
ticipate in the project as well.
"Every match is gravy, and something we didn't
expect to come up with," Levoy said. "We don't ex
pect to piece together the whole map by ourselves."
The Forma Urbis Project will be presenting its
most recent findings later this month at William*
Symposium on Classical Architecture in Rome. The
database, which includes three-dimensional models
and bibliographies of 400 map fragments, is avail
able online at http://formaurbis.stanford.edu.
