# U. of Maryland notes trend of skipping meals before drinking
## 
### MEGAN MCILROY THE DIAMONDBACK 
(U-WIRE) COLLEGE PARK, Md —
A typical night out for University of Mary
land sophomore physiology and neurobiolo
gy major Kendra Klein starts at 11:00 p.m.
She usually goes to the College Park bars
with her friends and drinks a few light beers
throughout the night. But Klein doesn't
make time for dinner on the nights she goes
out — she wants to save room for the beer.
"If I don't eat right before I go out, I can
drink five or six," Klein said.
Klein's not alone, though — she's part of
an emerging population of university
women consciously skipping meals before
they go out fora night of drinking, accord
ing to the University of Maryland Health
Center dietitian and eating disorders pro
gram coordinator.

"I do know that it's a common practice,
and clients say they are doing it to save calo
ries," health center dietitian Jane
Jakubczak said.
Julie Parsons coordinates the University's
eating disorder program and has also noticed
the trend — although neither could disclose
exact statistics.
"I have had many people talk about not
eating before they go out either because they
feel more comfortable in clothes or because
they will have a lot of caloric intake because
of drinking," Parsons said.
Both caloric intake and comfort keep se
nior finance major Suzanne Bradley from in
dulging in a meal before a night at the bars.
"Food makes me feel bloated when I
drink," Bradley said.
But Jakubczak warns that skipping din
ner before drinking may not actually con
serve calories.
"It usually ends up boomeranging. Girls

will get hungry and tend to have a lot of re
bound eating — because when we restrict we
overcompensate," she said.
Indeed, Klein said she usually winds up
eating at Danny's Sub Shop — which has be
come a pit stop for drunken university stu
dents who crave grease late at night — after
a night of drinking and forgoing dinner.
Jakubczak also warned that trying to
manage or lose weight while consistently
drinking alcohol is difficult, because alcohol
has many empty calories and is almost as
calorically dense as fat. Alcohol has seven
calories per gram and fat has nine calories
per gram.
Parsons said sacrificing food for alcohol is
not a choice she encourages students to make
regularly. Although students who make this
choice probably don't have a full-blown eat
ing disorder, they should be wary of their be
havior, since significantly altering eating
habits for fear of gaining weight is a sign of

distorted eating, Parsons said.
"Sacrificing good nutrition is a sign that
someone's relationship with food and their
body may not be in complete harmony," Par
sons said.
"I would not dismiss it as being nothing. It
is something to explore and wonder about
it," she said.
Leah McGrath, the director of the alcohol
and other drug education programs on the
campus, said skipping dinner before a night
of drinking is also probably not indicative of
an alcohol problem, but it could be a warning
sign of one.
"It's hard to tell from just one piece of the
puzzle — but skipping dinner before drink
ing can definitely increase the risk of a hang
over and maybe even alcohol poisoning,"
McGrath said.
This is because the human body metabo
lizes alcohol differently on an empty stom
ach, according to Jakubczak. When there is

nothing in the stomach to absorb the alco
hol, it goes into the blood system much
faster. Having something in the stomach
prevents what Jakubzcak calls a "shock to
the system."
Instead of skipping dinner, Jakubczak
recommends eating a light dinner with a mix
of protein, carbohydrates and healthy fat,
such as peanut butter and jelly with a glass
of milk, yogurt and a piece of toast and an
apple with peanut butter, or even a bowl of
cereal. She also encourages students to
order drinks they will be inclined to sip,
rather than gulp down and to alternate
water in between their drinks.
But some students say skipping dinner
before drinking just makes sense, especially
financially.
"It's not a huge deal," senior animal sci
ence major Kathryn Bonistalli said, "Espe
cially if I know I am going out with friends and
not wanting to spend a lot of money."
