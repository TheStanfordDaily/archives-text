10 Random Questions
Special Assistant for Diversity Outreach Laura Selznick
By BARRETT SHERIDAN
DESK EDITOR
Laura Selznick took over a new post as special assistant for diversity outreach
last fall after many years as an associate director in the Undergraduate Research
Programs office. She speaks French, Russian, a tad of Japanese and German, and
is taking her first Spanish class this quarter.
1) You've been an adviser for an astounding 25 years. What was your worst ad
vising experience?
This was pretty bad, actually. I had a situation where an advisee had come to
Stanford under false pretenses and it was discovered. Then there were various
things that happened to make that person leave Stanford. For somebody that re
ally cares about students, that was a really hard experience.
2) 25 years... That means some of your earliest advisees arc in
their 40s now. Do you know what any of them are doing?
The oldest one that I'm still in touch with is Anastasia
Watson, who was among the first group, and she had a hard
freshman year because she had a medical problem and had to
take time off and then came back and graduated with her class
and she's been fine ever since. Now she's an attorney in Los An
geles — in Pasadena, actually.
One of my former advisees is Danzy Senna, who has a
brand new book that's just come out. [Picks up a hardcover
book.] This is her first book, "Caucasia." This book is very cool.
She has a new one out. She's one of my more famous advisees.
3) Use one word to describe the ASSU election fiasco.
Unbelievable.
4) As the former undergraduate research guru, I have a question for you. I'm an
econ major, so could I get a research grant to test the marginal utility of a 24-pack
of Coronas on a group of my friends?
Probably not.
5) You're in charge of diversity outreach now. What do you think of pro-fro Sarah
Ball's piece in The Washington Post, in which she lambasts ethnically themed
dorms and events?
I didn't see that. I'll answer in a broader way. Diversity at Stanford is for ev
erybody. In fact, one of the ideas that I've had which I'm hoping for in the future
is that there could be some kind of a panel or conversation about diversity at
Admit Weekend, so it isn't just that you're depending on the community centers
to provide the vision of diversity at the University. A student who feels alienated
by the diversity needs a conversation to understand how to participate in the di
versity. Everybody contributes.
Diversity isn't about sectioning people off and assigning them an identity, be
cause so many people have different identities and connect in different ways. I
think that's one of the beauties of Stanford — that you can connect.
6) What do you think of my use of the word "lambasts"?
You're a Stanford student. Words are great.
7) Do you have any plans for "diversifying" Exotic Erotic this weekend [ May 15]?
You should show up just to, you know, make sure things are diverse.
I hadn't thought about it, actually.
8) Could you help me "diversify" my stock portfolio?
That's why you're an econ major.
9) What's your favorite building or location on campus?
Probably the arches in front of Old Union. There's something about the bird
bath fountain in the middle. It makes a nice space — we've done some really nice
events there. It also reminds me of when my kids were little, they liked to walk
around and around the fountain and I was always worried that they would fall in.
10) Name one of the best things and one of the worst things about The Stanford Daily.
It keeps you up-to-date with what's going on. I like the front page — I read it
every morning. I always check out the sports and read the columns more or less.
Letters to the editor are always entertaining. One of my favorite kind of articles is
the one that was in today's paper talking about the new election of the editor. I like
The Daily because it's a reflection of the student take on the University, and when
they do a good job they can do some really good news coverage.
The one [thing] that's open to the most improvement is reporters keeping their
quotes straight. Editors have control over the editorial content, but sometimes they
can misquote you or put your quote in the wrong context. But this year, The Daily's
been pretty good. The article that they wrote about me, when I got this new job,
was in some ways better than the article that was in The Stanford Report. It was a
really nice article. That was a delicate transition and they handled it really nicely.

All that jazz
By MELISSA CHEE
CONTRIBUTING WRITER
It's been a busy year for Stan
ford's Jazz Orchestra (SJO).
This fall, the group put the fin
ishing touches on their new CD.
More recently, they struggled to
get on the ASSU funding ballot
and now SJO is preparing for
their European tour. All this and
it's only a one unit class.
The group is a unique com
pilation of individuals. Accord
ing to the SJO Web site, mem
bers are brought together with
the common goal of keeping
the tradition of big band jazz
alive at Stanford. Although pri
marily undergrads, it's not ex
clusive. For the last few years,
the lead trumpet player has not
been a student.
"Very few
members of
the Jazz Or
chestra are
music ma
jors," said
Fred Berry, di-
rector of SJO, lecturer
and professional jazz
trumpeter. "For many of
the people in the band this is
probably their richest music
experience they'll ever have in
their life."
Berry has directed the group
for the last 14 years. As a for
mer Stanford student, he was
even a teaching assistant for the
class.
"Fred Berry has built this
program into something the
school can be proud of," said se
nior Justin Williams.
Sophomore Julie Spiegel said
the love of jazz is what brings to
gether students from various
academic niches, including
physics, engineering and politi
cal science.
This July, SJO will take
their love of jazz abroad.
Through diligent fundraising,
SJO's two week tour will take
them to Paris, Lyon, Perugia,
Siena and Rome to play in
various festivals.
"When on tour, they'll have
the opportunity to perform at
world-class venues," Berry said.
"It's a culturally-enriching expe
rience as well as a musically-en
riching experience."
It's no mistake that the group
CD "Bridging the Gap" just
came out this year.
"(Our CD release] hinges on
when we're anticipating a

tour," Berry said. "We try to
coordinate the CD [to come
out] in the school year prior to
our summer tour."
The album has 11 tracks and
costs $10. It also highlights local
Bay Area artists as well as John
Worley, Michael Zisman and
Marty Werner.
"The album is called 'Bridg
ing the Gap' because we play a
song on the album with this title
[and also] we are literally bridg
ing the gap between last year and
this year," Williams said.
The recording process was
twofold. SJO recorded eight
songs last spring and another
three this year.
Senior Michael Deeringer
vividly remembers the recording
session last May.
"We spent a long three-day
weekend laying down most of
the tracks for the album, living
off take-out pizza and doing our
best to get in some study time
during the breaks," he said.
Despite the long hours,
Deeringer considers his time
well-spent.
"There's something electri
fying about the recording engi
neer mixing down your sound
and playing it back to you,"
Deeringer said. "You hear
yourself playing ten times
better than you thought you
ever could."
However, Deeringer
said the finishing process
can only take the quality
so tar.
"The players
on this album are
phenomenal," he
said. "I couldn't

of folks to work with."
A CD release party was
held at at Yoshi's Jazz Club in
Oakland on Feb. 17.
"It [wasj quite an honor to
play at such a prestigious
Bay Area jazz club,"
Williams said.
Their next performance
is at Relay for Life on May 15
at the Stanford Stadium —
just one of a variety of cam
pus performances.
"I think it's important to
have a jazz culture on cam
pus in order to provide good
music in the jazz tradition
for students who enjoy it;
and to expand the musical
opportunities of those who
haven't heard much jazz or
big band music before,"
Williams said.
Now with SJO's funding
secure after passage of their
special fees, all future jazz or
chestra concerts will be free
to Stanford students.
"Our ASSU fees [help]
bring world-renown guest
artists to give clinics and per
form concerts with us,"
Williams said.
For Williams, SJO simply
offers the chance to do some
thing he loves.
"I've been a jazz musi
cian all my life and I will
never stop playing,"
Williams said.
Auditions for prospec
tive members will be held in
the fall.
Eat, drink and be merry
The Euro vibe
There are those restaurants that define your high
school experience — where you look back with
the "Wonder Years" shade of nostalgia, and re
call the multiple times when you and your
friends would linger for hours, doing nothing really but
ordering a measly $5 coffee or order of potato skins —
something just to keep the waitress off your back.
Some kids spent these hours at an
old school diner, or maybe that 24-
hour deli that was perfect for post-9
p.m. movie outings. Maybe if you're
from Eagle, Colo., you chill at the gas
station. Gotta love that collection of
gas fumes that has accumulated in
your lungs.
If you can't remember what high
school was like, I urge you to take a
break at noon on a weekday and head
over to Longs in Town and Country Village. That is if
you can fit through the throngs of acne-ridden, self-con
scious and both under- and over-achieving 9th-12th
graders. The mass pile of backpacks outside Longs
gives the hangout away, along with the general excla
mations of "penis" followed by uncontrollable laugh
ter. Yea, don't we all want to be back in high school.
Such great times.
Anyway, I keep forgetting that many of my friends
actually grew up around here — they're either from
20 minutes that way, or just 10 minutes down El
Camino. So sometimes, 1 find that they are great re
sources for inexpensive, casual eateries at where you
can study or just laze around on a warm Sunday after
noon. And hopefully they don't tell me about that re
ally inexpensive gas station snack sjiop next to Taco
Bell. Yum.
So one random Thursday night I was standing in our
open kitchen, picking out the crackers in the Japanese
snack mix, when one of my friends who had gone to the
Menlo School joined me. We were in the midst of a con
versation when she off-handedly mentioned this place
that I kept hearing about — Cafe Barrone. When I
asked her about it, she went off on this long, gushing
praise of how she sat there everyday after-school trying
to avoid doing her homework.
Hmm. sounds like just what 1 need.
So to switch up my usual Starbucks routine, of sitting
in the packed parking lot for 10 minutes, secretly hating
at the guard for Barbecues Galore (seriously, how many
people are buying barbecues on 1 p.m. on Tuesday af
ternoon), only to wait inside for another 15 minutes for
an open table — I try out Cafe Barrone.
If you've ever wondered why there are only 15
some odd tables at Starbucks, it's because they all left
to belong to this charming, quasi-European cafe. I've
never seen such a huge expanse of a patio before, and
the inside area has quite the collection of tables as
well. Beware though, the indoor table surface area
isn't all that big, so if you are planning on bringing
your laptop and massive organic chemistry text book,
I'd think again.
But it's perfect for one of their creamy lattes and a
book from Hemingway, Hurston, Faulker or Fitzergald.
Search for something intelligent to say for your weekly
office hours visit.
Cafe Barrone's huge windows (that basically serve as
one of the walls) look out onto the patio and create a
sense of space and peacefulness. You are not enclosed in
some library, where you have to search for that tiny win
dow crevice to see if it has gotten dark yet. If you want,
you can catch the sunset while outlining your IHUM
paper — without the nasty grass bugs that emerge when
the sky starts to dim.
But it's not only the patio / table / chair ratio that
creates the appeal. The food itself is worth a visit. You
order your food at the counter, after browsing the giant
chalkboard menu that is hanging several feet above the
cash registers. You might end up straining your neck
because there are so many options. You will be looking
at the menu for quite some time.
Once you order, the person behind the counter gives
you a number that you set on the table you choose.
Then you can sit down, relax and wait for the waiter to
find you with your food and silverware. So it's a bit
more casual then a normal sit-down cafe, but definitely
nicer and more chic than a Quizno's or other fast-food
type of place.
Cafe Barrone has a huge array of menu options, from
sandwiches to salads, to appetizer plates and daily soup,
panini, quiche and entfee specials (like a grilled veg
etable lasagna). My absolute favorites are the chicken
salad sandwich and the spinach salad, which blend to
gether perfectly, in case you're really hungry.
The sandwich is full of sizeable chunks of chicken,
softly suspended in creamy mayonnaise, with bits of cel
ery, green apple and walnut pieces mixed throughout. It
is served between thin pieces of lightly toasted cinna
mon raisin bread, which sounds somewhat odd at first,
but actually provides the perfect hint of sweetness to
complement the chicken salad's texture.
The spinach salad is another great order — the ten
der leaves of greens are lightly dressed in a walnut vinai
grette, with cranberry, goat cheese and toasted walnuts
tossed throughout.
So whether it's for that Euro coffee vibe, or that
pseudo-intellectual leisure vibe, make Cafe Barrone a
stop on your road through life. And as a plus, it's right
next door to BBC, so if you get kicked out of there, you
know you have someplace to chill while your friends are
having a good time.
Cate Barrone is located at 1149 hi Camino Real,
in Menlo Park.
If you have been to Eagle, Colo, recently, let Jennie
know at jbroder@stanford.edu. She would like to
know what's going on with these kids that hang out at
gas stations.
