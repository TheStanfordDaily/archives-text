# Housing disputes Draw gender-bias claims
## 
### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While flipping through the 2004-
2005 upperclass housing information
packet, distributed by the University's
Housing Assignment Services (HAS),
some students noticed a difference be
tween last year's cutoff numbers for
males and females in many houses on
the Row. This discrepancy — com
bined with the University's decision to
give another Row house to a fraternity
this year — led some females'to call the
Draw unfairly biased toward males.
HAS representatives, however, claim
that they compensate for the number of
all-male houses by allowing more fe
males into other Row houses, leading
to a gender-balanced Row.
"The Draw is sexist because there
are seven frats and because they count
the Cowell Cluster as part of the Row,"
said junior Mary Stone. "That's the
only reason they get balanced numbers
of men and women on the Row."
In 680 Lomita, a Row house filled
with two-room doubles, there is an ad
vantage of over 100 points for men. An
other noticeable difference occurs in
Mars, which is located on the upper
Row, where the cutoffs for women run
from the mid-300s to mid-200s, while
the cutoff for men ranges from about
1,337 to 571, depending on group size.
Similar trends with cutoff numbers
occur in 717 Dolores, the Grove Hous
es and Durand.
Michelle Shane, a freshman who is

hoping to get into 680 Lomita for its
rooms, social life and location, said she
worries about making the cut in light of
the different cutoffs.
"I don't think that housing assign
ments should be based op sex," Shane
said. "Maybe it should just be depen
dent on Draw number because people
should get in where they want."
Students expressed a range of rea
sons for their desire to live on the Row.
"The Row presents a different expe
rience," said freshman Sharon Cu.
"Whether it's a self-op or co-op, the
house has an open kitchen, an expected
lively environment and a central loca
tion. It's the place to party. It's social."
According to Executive Director of
Student Housing Rodger Whitney,
there is no disparity between the num
ber of males and females who end up on
the Row.
"Men and women are allocated
spaces in housing according to their
ratio in the student population apply
ing for upperclass housing in the
Draw," Whitney said. "For instance, to
account for the all-male spaces in fra
ternities and all-female spaces in soror
ities and Roth House, on the Row, the
number of spaces in remaining Row
houses are allocated in houses in a
ratio to reflect gender equity in the
Row-at-large."
Therefore, Whitney asserts that the
non-Greek houses on the Row general
ly have more spots allocated to women.
The addition of all-female sororities to
the Cowell Cluster — which HAS in

eludes as part of the Row — made it
easier to balance gender on the Row
than in the past.
According to Director of HAS
Todd Benson, there are seven housed
fraternities with roughly 340 bed
spaces and three housed sororities with
about 170 spots.
HAS actually assigns more women
than men to the approximately 30 non-
Greek houses on the Row in its efforts
to make sure that the percentage of
men and women on the Row is as close
as possible to the nearly equal gender
balance of the Draw population.
"Draw cutoffs are not a very reliable
way to measure the equity of housing
assignments," Benson said. "They are
heavily influenced by which residences
students choose on their Draw applica
tions, the number of groups in the

Draw and the group retention choices
of students applying."
Benson cites that the numbers can
vary greatly depending on the popular
ity of a house among men or women
any given year.
"Overall, Housing Assignment Ser
vices strives for gender equity when
looking at all of the Row houses to
gether," Whitney said. "This is a tricky
process, and normally there are several
trial runs before an acceptable balance
that works correctly to keep gender
parity on the Row and across all other
upperclass housing types is achieved."
Benson estimates that his office re
ceived about 4,350 housing applica
tions. As of now, in spite of the previous
delays, he said that HAS plans on pub
licly releasing the results of the Draw
on Mav 22.

2005 upperclass housing information
packet, distributed by the University's
Housing Assignment Services (HAS),
some students noticed a difference be
tween last year's cutoff numbers for
males and females in many houses on
the Row. This discrepancy — com
bined with the University's decision to
give another Row house to a fraternity
this year — led some females'to call the
Draw unfairly biased toward males.
HAS representatives, however, claim
that they compensate for the number of
all-male houses by allowing more fe
males into other Row houses, leading
to a gender-balanced Row.
"The Draw is sexist because there
are seven frats and because they count
the Cowell Cluster as part of the Row,"
said junior Mary Stone. "That's the
only reason they get balanced numbers
of men and women on the Row."
In 680 Lomita, a Row house filled
with two-room doubles, there is an ad
vantage of over 100 points for men. An
other noticeable difference occurs in
Mars, which is located on the upper
Row, where the cutoffs for women run
from the mid-300s to mid-200s, while
the cutoff for men ranges from about
1,337 to 571, depending on group size.
Similar trends with cutoff numbers
occur in 717 Dolores, the Grove Hous
es and Durand.
Michelle Shane, a freshman who is

hoping to get into 680 Lomita for its
rooms, social life and location, said she
worries about making the cut in light of
the different cutoffs.
"I don't think that housing assign
ments should be based op sex," Shane
said. "Maybe it should just be depen
dent on Draw number because people
should get in where they want."
Students expressed a range of rea
sons for their desire to live on the Row.
"The Row presents a different expe
rience," said freshman Sharon Cu.
"Whether it's a self-op or co-op, the
house has an open kitchen, an expected
lively environment and a central loca
tion. It's the place to party. It's social."
According to Executive Director of
Student Housing Rodger Whitney,
there is no disparity between the num
ber of males and females who end up on
the Row.
"Men and women are allocated
spaces in housing according to their
ratio in the student population apply
ing for upperclass housing in the
Draw," Whitney said. "For instance, to
account for the all-male spaces in fra
ternities and all-female spaces in soror
ities and Roth House, on the Row, the
number of spaces in remaining Row
houses are allocated in houses in a
ratio to reflect gender equity in the
Row-at-large."
Therefore, Whitney asserts that the
non-Greek houses on the Row general
ly have more spots allocated to women.
The addition of all-female sororities to
the Cowell Cluster — which HAS in

eludes as part of the Row — made it
easier to balance gender on the Row
than in the past.
According to Director of HAS
Todd Benson, there are seven housed
fraternities with roughly 340 bed
spaces and three housed sororities with
about 170 spots.
HAS actually assigns more women
than men to the approximately 30 non-
Greek houses on the Row in its efforts
to make sure that the percentage of
men and women on the Row is as close
as possible to the nearly equal gender
balance of the Draw population.
"Draw cutoffs are not a very reliable
way to measure the equity of housing
assignments," Benson said. "They are
heavily influenced by which residences
students choose on their Draw applica
tions, the number of groups in the

Draw and the group retention choices
of students applying."
Benson cites that the numbers can
vary greatly depending on the popular
ity of a house among men or women
any given year.
"Overall, Housing Assignment Ser
vices strives for gender equity when
looking at all of the Row houses to
gether," Whitney said. "This is a tricky
process, and normally there are several
trial runs before an acceptable balance
that works correctly to keep gender
parity on the Row and across all other
upperclass housing types is achieved."
Benson estimates that his office re
ceived about 4,350 housing applica
tions. As of now, in spite of the previous
delays, he said that HAS plans on pub
licly releasing the results of the Draw
on Mav 22.
