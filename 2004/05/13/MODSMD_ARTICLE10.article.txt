# Dartmouth draws students from top public and private high school pools
## 
### ZACHARY GOLDSTEIN THE DARTMOUTH 
(U-WIRE) HANOVER. N.H.
— From SAT tutoring to private
college counseling, families are
willing to pay almost anything to
get their children into the college
of their dreams. Some take it a
step further, paying upwards of
$20,000 annual tuition at some of
the most elite private schools in
the country to prepare their chil
dren for top colleges.
While statistics seem to show
that attending an elite high school
improves chances of admission to
college, there seems to be very little
distinction between public and pri
vate. Statistics suggest that it may
even be slightly more difficult to get
into Dartmouth coming from a pri
vate school.
Nearly 65 percent of the appli
cants for the Class of 2(X)8 came
from public schools and were ac
cepted at rate just slightly above
Dartmouth's overall rate. 18.8 per
cent of public school applicants
were accepted compared to 18.3
percent of overall applicants. By
comparison, only 18.1 percent of pri
vate school applicants and 13.9 per
cent of parochial school applicants
— also technically private schools
— were given admission.
Dean of Admissions Karl
Furstenberg dismissed any no
tion that there was preference
given along public versus private
school lines.
"There's no point in having a
preference for public school or
private school," he said. "The
preference is for interesting and
talented kids."
At Phillips Andover Academy in
Massachusetts, one of the most
prestigious private schools in the
country. 16 of the 40 students who
applied for the Class of 2006 were
admitted — a full 40 percent.
But the acceptance rate for
Stuyvesant High School in New
York City, an elite public school,
was even higher. Of 73 seniors who
applied to Dartmouth, 32 got in.
In her book "A is for Admission"
Michele Hernandez, a former Dart
mouth admissions officer and cur
rently a private college consultant,
reported similar numbers form
other top schools in the mid-19905.

She recalled a year during which the
Thomas Jefferson High School for
Science and Technology, a selective
public magnet school in Virginia,
sent 29 applicants to and got 14 ac
cepted — nearly 50 percent.
Whether public or private, it
seems clear that students attending
any elite school do appear to be re
ceiving a benefit — though not
necessarily in the admissions
process itself.
It is the increased educational
opportunity at these elite high
schools that improves an appli
cant's chances, not any benefit
given to the applicant during the ad
missions process itself, according to
Stephen Singer, director of college
counseling at Horace Mann School
in New York City. He speculated
that it may even be more difficult
for students from elite schools to
stand out as exceptional among the
overall applicant pool because they
face more competition from within
their own school.
Furstenberg, however, said that
applicants are not compared to
others applying from the same
high school.
But, he said, some are miffed
when they find that receiving a
diploma from a prestigious private
school does not guarantee admis
sion to Dartmouth — even if the
high school has a history of sending
many of its students to the College.
"A lot students and families at
elite private schools feel like part of
what they're buying is access to the
kind of schools like Dartmouth. But
you just can't afford to have any
kind of special relationship with any
school based upon history," he said.
"Admissions is a very future-orient
ed activity. What's relevant to us is
where are the talented students?"
It is because of this "class war
fare" in admissions and because of
debates over race-based affirmative
action that people like Hernandez
are proposing replacing race as a
factor in admissions with a consider
ation of income.
"If socio-economic class were
considered instead of race, you
would pick up minorities in that
pool, and it would be a more fair
evaluation," said Hernandez.
Furstenberg admitted that there
were "educational arguments" and
"fairness arguments" for giving an

advantage to first-generation col
lege students and low-income stu
dents who "as a national population
haven't had as much access to edu
cational opportunities." However,
two things in particular make it diffi
cult, he said.
First, it's difficult to turn down
yet another highly-qualified appli
cant in order to accept a student who
has not yet had an opportunity to
prove himself.
Second, admitting more first-gener
ation low-income students adds
strain to the financial aid budget. Fi
nancial aid is a major expense for
the College and has been growing at
a double digit rate, according to
Furstenberg.
"I think you'd have to consider
very carefully about just how you
are going to do this because you
don't want to, all of a sudden, add
$5 million to your financial aid
budget."
But a third, unmentioned com
plication is need-blind admissions.
Most of the best colleges and uni
versities now use need-blind admis
sions, meaning they do not take an
applicant's financial aid needs into
account when reviewing an applica
tion. However, need-blind admis
sions also prevent the admissions of
fice from definitively knowing
whether an applicant is low-income
and has missed out on educational
advantages other, more affluent stu
dents had.
Even without consideration of
socio-economic background, Dart
mouth has managed to incorporate
a large number of low income and
first-generation college students.
Accot ding to rough figures from the
admissions office, 16 percent of
Dartmouth students are first-gener
ation college. Meanwhile, 15 per
cent of the college — though not
necessarily the same group — come
from families with annual incomes
below $45,000.
"Essentially a third of our finan
cial aid candidates are in this low in
come category, and that's more than
other Ivies," Furstenberg said.

economic class plays in admissions.
