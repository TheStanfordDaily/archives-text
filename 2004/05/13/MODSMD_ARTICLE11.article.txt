A new study led by Terrence Ket
ter, an associate professor of psychi
atry and behavioral sciences, re
vealed stronger positive results for
manic depressives who receive early
treatment and diagnosis for their ill
ness than for those who receive late
diagnosis or who have a first-degree
relative with the disorder.
The study assessed the progress
of 42 Stanford students who were
being treated at Stanford's Bipolar
Disorders Clinic. Ketter, who
heads this clinic, says that many of
these bipolar students showed sig
nificant progress while being treat
ed at the clinic under the Systemat
ic Treatment Enhancement Pro
gram for Bipolar Disorder, which is
the largest study ever conducted
for the illness.
Researchers in this study found
that these students' Clinical Glob
al Impression scores decreased sig
nificantly as a result of effective
treatment. According to Ketter,
this treatment included medica
tion, psychoeducation, and psy
chotherapy. On average, these col
lege-age patients required roughly
2.5 medications fewer than un
treated adults, and suffered a de
crease in the frequency of manic
depressive episodes.
Although students generally im
proved under treatment conditions.

some subgroups improved more
than others.
"We have found some markers
of poorer overall response such as
having a first-degree relative with
bipolar disorder," Ketter said.
"Such markers should help us
identify a baseline for patients at
risk for doing less well, and alert
us that we should provide them
with extra monitoring and aggres
sive treatment."
The disorder, which typically
emerges during adolescence, is
characterized by alternating moods
of mania and depression. In a manic
episode, a person generally experi
ences emotions of grandeur, irri
tability, distractibility, and often ex
hibits impulsive behavior. In a de
pressive episode, a person suffers
from sleep disturbances and chron
ic feelings of depression.
Nationally, bipolar disorder is a
slowly growing epidemic, yielding a
15 percent suicide rate among
manic-depressives.
"Since the Second World War,
bipolar disorder incidence is increas
ing and the age of onset is decreas
ing," Ketter said. "It is a major prob
lem that requires crucial early and
professional treatment."
If left untreated, evidence has
shown that the disease can grow pro
gressively worse. Episodes often in
crease in severity, frequency, and
can eventually become resistant to
medication. Ketter said.

Inappropriate treatment and
misdiagnosis often occur because
symptoms of bipolar disorder may
overlap with those of other ill
nesses such as major depressive
disorder, schizophrenia and atten
tion deficit hyper disorder. Misla
beling bipolar disorder for depres
sion in particular can have detri
mental results.
"By administering antidepres
sants or stimulants for depression in
the absence of mood stabilizers,
these medications can actually desta
bilize mood," Ketter cautioned.
Although lifestyle changes, exer
cise, and avoiding illegal substances
can help facilitate a patient's speedy
recovery, these modulations are not
effective substitutes for medication
and psychotherapeutic techniques,
Ketter said. Ultimately, when fol
lowing these necessary steps, the
study shows that early and profes
sional treatment can provide manic
depressive patients with improved
mood stability and overall psycho
logical health.
Concerning future treatment op
tions for those suffering from bipolar
disorder. Ketter and his colleagues
are currently conducting research to
develop new therapies with the aid
of advances in genetics, neuroimag
ing, psychopharmacology and psy
chotherapy.
"With the use of these new ad
vances, we will most definitely en
hance outcomes," Ketter said.
