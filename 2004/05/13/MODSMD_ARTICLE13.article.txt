# Students travel abroad to explore international health
## An interview with former World Health Organization intern Johanna Choi 
### LAUREN GONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From helping train barefoot doctors in
Vietnam to interning at international govern
ing bodies, Stanford students have access to
health-related internships across the globe.
The summer after her junior year, senior
Johanna Choi interned at the World Health
Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland
in the traditional medicine department. While
her first experience working in Geneva was
only three months long, she did further con
tract work for the traditional medicine de
partment and even got flown to a SARS con
ference in China last October.
Her experience working for the WHO
helped shape her path through the health field
and in an interview with The Daily, she gives
advice to other Stanford students interested in
doing international health work abroad.
The Daily: So why did you choose an interna
tional internship versus an organization based
in the United States?
Johanna Choi: My parents are avid travelers
and we've never spent a vacation at home. I've
always been fascinated by other cultures,
probably because 1 grew up constantly ex
posed to different ones.
TD: How did you come across this internship?
JC: Pure serendipity. I read about the WHO's
traditional medicine team in The New York
Times and wanted more information, so I e
mailed the WHO. By the time the message got
to the traditional medicine team, they thought
I was a doctor who wanted to collaborate with
them, so when I told them I was an undergrad,
they invited me to work with them fora sum
mer.
TD: What was it like to live in Geneva?
JC: It was so much fun [that] 1 did not want to
go home! There are tons of interns there dur
ing the summer, so it was exciting to meet
other people my age who were also interested
in international health, and since Geneva is in
such a great location, we got to take cool
weekend trips to the Swiss Alps, Italy and
France.
TD: How was your experience at the WHO?
JC: It was very cool going to work every day
and being able to speak English, French, Chi
nese and Japanese — the fact that everyone
there was from everywhere and could speak
five languages fluently was amazing to me. I
loved the fact that every project I was given fo
cused on a different part of the world. It was
never boring.
TD: Did you ever feel lost in the bureaucracy?
JC: Sometimes it was frustrating to see great
ideas get bogged down in all the layers of bu
reaucracy that are inherent to a huge interna

tional organization like the WHO. While I did
not have to deal too much with it, I thought
the hoops our secretaries had to go through to
get anything approved was a bit ridiculous.
TD: What were your responsibilities as part of
the traditional medicine team?
JC: My responsibilities included coordinat
ing two international expert consultations
meetings, consulting with government offi
cials to implement traditional medicine pro
grams in their countries and determining
global guidelines for various safety aspects
of medicinal plans.
TD: What were the major pros and cons of
your internship?
JC: The pros included doing substantial work
for the WHO (the Guidelines on Good Agri
cultural Practices for Medicinal Plants I
worked on just got published) and meeting
traditional medicine experts and making
friends from all around the world. On the
other hand, the cons included adjusting to the
slower pace of a large bureaucracy and seeing
that politics are everywhere, even in some
thing as universal as health. Also, the WHO is
very removed from the policies they make, so
I often wondered what the real impact of our
policies were.
TD: How did you get interested in traditional
medicine?
JC: My mother is from Taiwan and my father
is from Hong Kong, so I grew up seeing both a
pediatrician and a Traditional Chinese
Medicine doctor. Both medical disciplines
have their strengths and weaknesses, and I al
ways wondered why people didn't try to com
bine them instead of holding them at odds
with each other. I think their very different ap
proaches towards healing are fascinating, and
I'm glad that people are becoming more open
to the idea of integrative medicine.
TD: How do you plan to incorporate integra
tive medicine into your future and what are
your plans in the upcoming years?
JC: I'm going to take a year off before contin
uing on to medical school; at the moment, I'm
planning to do the Community Health Corps
up in San Francisco and work at a health clin
ic to help medically underserved populations
through health education and outreach.
Eventually I would love to go back to the
WHO, but that won't be fora while.
TD: What is your advice for students interest
ed in getting involved with international
health?
JC: Go out there and get some experience!
You can either go out into the field and work
in a developing country like many of my peers
have done or just contact someone at the
WHO and get some more Stanford represen
tation out there.

very removed from the policies they make, so
I often wondered what the real impact of our
policies were.
TD: How did you get interested in traditional
medicine?
JC: My mother is from Taiwan and my father
is from Hong Kong, so I grew up seeing both a
pediatrician and a Traditional Chinese
Medicine doctor. Both medical disciplines
have their strengths and weaknesses, and I al
ways wondered why people didn't try to com
bine them instead of holding them at odds
with each other. I think their very different ap
proaches towards healing are fascinating, and
I'm glad that people are becoming more open
to the idea of integrative medicine.
TD: How do you plan to incorporate integra
tive medicine into your future and what are
your plans in the upcoming years?
JC: I'm going to take a year off before contin
uing on to medical school; at the moment, I'm
planning to do the Community Health Corps
up in San Francisco and work at a health clin
ic to help medically underserved populations
through health education and outreach.
Eventually I would love to go back to the
WHO, but that won't be fora while.
TD: What is your advice for students interest
ed in getting involved with international
health?
JC: Go out there and get some experience!
You can either go out into the field and work
in a developing country like many of my peers
have done or just contact someone at the
WHO and get some more Stanford represen
tation out there.
From helping train barefoot doctors in
Vietnam to interning at international govern
ing bodies, Stanford students have access to
health-related internships across the globe.
The summer after her junior year, senior
Johanna Choi interned at the World Health
Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland
in the traditional medicine department. While
her first experience working in Geneva was
only three months long, she did further con
tract work for the traditional medicine de
partment and even got flown to a SARS con
ference in China last October.
Her experience working for the WHO
helped shape her path through the health field
and in an interview with The Daily, she gives
advice to other Stanford students interested in
doing international health work abroad.
The Daily: So why did you choose an interna
tional internship versus an organization based
in the United States?
Johanna Choi: My parents are avid travelers
and we've never spent a vacation at home. I've
always been fascinated by other cultures,
probably because 1 grew up constantly ex
posed to different ones.
TD: How did you come across this internship?
JC: Pure serendipity. I read about the WHO's
traditional medicine team in The New York
Times and wanted more information, so I e
mailed the WHO. By the time the message got
to the traditional medicine team, they thought
I was a doctor who wanted to collaborate with
them, so when I told them I was an undergrad,
they invited me to work with them fora sum
mer.
TD: What was it like to live in Geneva?
JC: It was so much fun [that] 1 did not want to
go home! There are tons of interns there dur
ing the summer, so it was exciting to meet
other people my age who were also interested
in international health, and since Geneva is in
such a great location, we got to take cool
weekend trips to the Swiss Alps, Italy and
France.
TD: How was your experience at the WHO?
JC: It was very cool going to work every day
and being able to speak English, French, Chi
nese and Japanese — the fact that everyone
there was from everywhere and could speak
five languages fluently was amazing to me. I
loved the fact that every project I was given fo
cused on a different part of the world. It was
never boring.
TD: Did you ever feel lost in the bureaucracy?
JC: Sometimes it was frustrating to see great
ideas get bogged down in all the layers of bu
reaucracy that are inherent to a huge interna

tional organization like the WHO. While I did
not have to deal too much with it, I thought
the hoops our secretaries had to go through to
get anything approved was a bit ridiculous.
TD: What were your responsibilities as part of
the traditional medicine team?
JC: My responsibilities included coordinat
ing two international expert consultations
meetings, consulting with government offi
cials to implement traditional medicine pro
grams in their countries and determining
global guidelines for various safety aspects
of medicinal plans.
TD: What were the major pros and cons of
your internship?
JC: The pros included doing substantial work
for the WHO (the Guidelines on Good Agri
cultural Practices for Medicinal Plants I
worked on just got published) and meeting
traditional medicine experts and making
friends from all around the world. On the
other hand, the cons included adjusting to the
slower pace of a large bureaucracy and seeing
that politics are everywhere, even in some
thing as universal as health. Also, the WHO is
very removed from the policies they make, so
I often wondered what the real impact of our
policies were.
