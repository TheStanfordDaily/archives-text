# Getting a safe tan
## Why forgetting your sunscreen may be more dangerous than you think 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
The bright blue skies and shining
sunny days of spring quarter inevitably
result in many changes to the Farm:
Courseloads lighten up, miniskirts crop
up right and left, and suntanning be
comes an extracurricular activity prac
ticed at all possible times. Yet choosing
to soak up the sun sans sunscreen can
be a costly activity — not only at night
when you're slapping on the aloe vera
and swearing that you'll never let your
self get that burned again — but also
later on in life in the form of wrinkles
and cancer.
According to Susan Swetter, assistant
professor of dermatology at Stanford
Medical School, most people receive
nearly 80 percent of their total lifetime
sun exposure by the time they hit 18
years of age.
"Hollywood and the fashion indus
try dictate what young adults wear, and
when bare midriffs, short skirts and
tank tops are fashionable, younger peo
ple will inevitably be more exposed to
the sun," said Swetter. "Additionally,
the myth still exists that a golden-tan
color is healthy."
Younger people are the ones that
are also the least likely to listen to
warnings about skin cancer and other
harmful consequences of unprotected
sun exposure, said Alfred Lane, profes
sor and chair of Stanford Dermatology
department and a pediatric dermatolo
gist at the Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital in a previous interview with
The Stanford Report.
"It's just part of the adolescent psyche
to not see the far-reaching effects of
what they do," said Lane.
Rather than focusing on skin cancer

— which is indeed a serious concern for
young people, as it is the most prevalent
cancer in women ages 25 to 29 — derma
tologists are focusing on something that
scares the young even more: wrinkles.
"Teens and young adults just don't lis
ten to warnings about getting skin can
cer, so the current public health cam
paigns are focusing on the cosmetic as
pect of aging instead," Swetter said.
"[The campaigns] show pictures of aged
skin, demonstrating how wrinkled a per
son will get if they are exposed to the sun
for extended periods of time."
Is it necessary to avoid the sun alto
gether, then? Not if you are careful and
choose a good sunscreen. Forget the
bronzing oils and accelerated tanning
products — the latter which are actually
not approved by the Food and Drug Ad
ministration. Instead, choose a sun
screen with a SPF (Sun Protection Facto
r) of at least 15.
"Any sunscreen with a SPF under 15,
however, is useless," Swetter said. "Peo
ple should use a sunscreen with a SPF of
15 to 30. Because the SPF numbers work
on a logarithmic scale, though, sun
screens with a SPF above 30 are not pro
viding much more protection and are re
ally only recommended for people with
very fair skin."
The SPF number increases the
amount of time that you can spend in the
sun before getting burned, she ex
plained. Applying a sunblock with a SPF
of 15 will increase the amount of time
you can spend in the sun by 15 times. But
after this time period, more sunscreen
will not equal more protection.
Additionally, avoiding direct expo
sure between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4
p.m. or wearing light colored, tightly
woven clothes that cover the skin — as
well as a hat — is a good way to avoid

sunburn. Swetter added.
For those who want that perfect
bronzed look before Saturday's Exotic
Erotic party, or who just want to avoid
the consequences of traditional suntan
ning, sunless tanners can be a great op
tion. These products, available in drug
stores. cosmetics counters and even in
salons, work by interacting with the
amino acids on the surface on the skin,
effectively adding a layer of pigment,
giving the skin a tanned appearance.
Sunless tanners "are in no way dam
aging to the skin," Swetter explained.
"The only danger is that people will
spend more time in the sun, thinking
that this superficial pigment will pro
tect them from sunburn, but the truth is
that your skin can burn even if you look
perfectly tanned [from the sunless tan
ner]."
As long as people remember to put on
sunscreen even when they look tan, sun
less tanners are an excellent alternative
to laying out for hours under the sun
without adequate sun protection.
Tanning booths, on the other hand,
"are just bad news," Swetter said. "They
use a combination of UVA and UVB
light and are completely unregulated by
the FDA since they are considered a cos
metic service. We have actually seen an
increase in melanomas — skin cancers
— in frequent users of tanning booths."
In order to help people detect can
cers before they become deadly or
spread, the Stanford Medical School's
Dermatology Department is holding a
free skin cancer screening this Satur
day, May 15 at the Stanford Health Li
brary in the Stanford Shopping Center.
The event will run from 9 a.m. to noon.
No registration is necessary; partici
pants will be seen on a first-come, first
served basis.

sor and chair of Stanford Dermatology
department and a pediatric dermatolo
gist at the Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital in a previous interview with
The Stanford Report.
"It's just part of the adolescent psyche
to not see the far-reaching effects of
what they do," said Lane.
Rather than focusing on skin cancer

— which is indeed a serious concern for
young people, as it is the most prevalent
cancer in women ages 25 to 29 — derma
tologists are focusing on something that
scares the young even more: wrinkles.
"Teens and young adults just don't lis
ten to warnings about getting skin can
cer, so the current public health cam
paigns are focusing on the cosmetic as
pect of aging instead," Swetter said.
"[The campaigns] show pictures of aged
skin, demonstrating how wrinkled a per
son will get if they are exposed to the sun
for extended periods of time."
Is it necessary to avoid the sun alto
gether, then? Not if you are careful and
choose a good sunscreen. Forget the
bronzing oils and accelerated tanning
products — the latter which are actually
not approved by the Food and Drug Ad
ministration. Instead, choose a sun
screen with a SPF (Sun Protection Facto
r) of at least 15.
"Any sunscreen with a SPF under 15,
however, is useless," Swetter said. "Peo
ple should use a sunscreen with a SPF of
15 to 30. Because the SPF numbers work
on a logarithmic scale, though, sun
screens with a SPF above 30 are not pro
viding much more protection and are re
ally only recommended for people with
very fair skin."
The SPF number increases the
amount of time that you can spend in the
sun before getting burned, she ex
plained. Applying a sunblock with a SPF
of 15 will increase the amount of time
you can spend in the sun by 15 times. But
after this time period, more sunscreen
will not equal more protection.
Additionally, avoiding direct expo
sure between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4
p.m. or wearing light colored, tightly
woven clothes that cover the skin — as
well as a hat — is a good way to avoid

sunburn. Swetter added.
For those who want that perfect
bronzed look before Saturday's Exotic
Erotic party, or who just want to avoid
the consequences of traditional suntan
ning, sunless tanners can be a great op
tion. These products, available in drug
stores. cosmetics counters and even in
salons, work by interacting with the
amino acids on the surface on the skin,
effectively adding a layer of pigment,
giving the skin a tanned appearance.
Sunless tanners "are in no way dam
aging to the skin," Swetter explained.
"The only danger is that people will
spend more time in the sun, thinking
that this superficial pigment will pro
tect them from sunburn, but the truth is
that your skin can burn even if you look
perfectly tanned [from the sunless tan
ner]."
As long as people remember to put on
sunscreen even when they look tan, sun
less tanners are an excellent alternative
to laying out for hours under the sun
without adequate sun protection.
Tanning booths, on the other hand,
"are just bad news," Swetter said. "They
use a combination of UVA and UVB
light and are completely unregulated by
the FDA since they are considered a cos
metic service. We have actually seen an
increase in melanomas — skin cancers
— in frequent users of tanning booths."
In order to help people detect can
cers before they become deadly or
spread, the Stanford Medical School's
Dermatology Department is holding a
free skin cancer screening this Satur
day, May 15 at the Stanford Health Li
brary in the Stanford Shopping Center.
The event will run from 9 a.m. to noon.
No registration is necessary; partici
pants will be seen on a first-come, first

The bright blue skies and shining
sunny days of spring quarter inevitably
result in many changes to the Farm:
Courseloads lighten up, miniskirts crop
up right and left, and suntanning be
comes an extracurricular activity prac
ticed at all possible times. Yet choosing
to soak up the sun sans sunscreen can
be a costly activity — not only at night
when you're slapping on the aloe vera
and swearing that you'll never let your
self get that burned again — but also
later on in life in the form of wrinkles
and cancer.
According to Susan Swetter, assistant
professor of dermatology at Stanford
Medical School, most people receive
nearly 80 percent of their total lifetime
sun exposure by the time they hit 18
years of age.
"Hollywood and the fashion indus
try dictate what young adults wear, and
when bare midriffs, short skirts and
tank tops are fashionable, younger peo
ple will inevitably be more exposed to
the sun," said Swetter. "Additionally,
the myth still exists that a golden-tan
color is healthy."
Younger people are the ones that
are also the least likely to listen to
warnings about skin cancer and other
harmful consequences of unprotected
sun exposure, said Alfred Lane, profes
sor and chair of Stanford Dermatology
department and a pediatric dermatolo
gist at the Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital in a previous interview with
