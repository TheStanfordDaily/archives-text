## The 						rise of Viagra 
### CHARLES FENG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
One fateful day in March of 1998, porn stars and old
geezers everywhere joined hands and rejoiced, singing
the gospel of Viagra and basking in its shimmering
promises of renewed sexual bliss. It was on this day that
the Federal Drug Administration. FDA, had approved
Viagra, leading Pfizer Inc. to join the ranks of those who
dominate the pharmaceutical world, while simultane
ously leading to the formation of countless beleaguered
old wives' groups. The litany of bad late-night jokes
aside, the medical community welcomed Viagra with
open arms — impotence for some men, after all, was on
par with castration.
In order to bring Viagra to the market, scientists had
to pass a rigid hierarchy of FDA-approved tests to en
sure the drug's safety and efficacy. In the first phase of
trials, after having shown early promise when tested on
animals, the drug was given to a few dozen healthy vol
unteers to determine preliminary physiological reper
cussions, such as the side effects associated with in
creased doses.
When Viagra was deemed safe, it moved on to phase
11, where the effectiveness of the drug was closely moni
tored in well-controlled studies involving hundreds of
people. Finally, in phase 111 studies, performed on thou
sands of volunteers, scores of clinical trials were con
ducted to paint a clear picture of its overall potential ben

efits to the general population. Pending phase 111 clear
ance, untold of millions of dollars awaited the scientists
and Pfizer Inc.
Carefully conducted clinical trials are integral to ad
vancing medical knowledge. They are the fastest way
to find new treatments for ravaging ailments like can
cer and AIDS. Oftentimes, however, the trials intro
duce treatments or medications that are so cutting
edge that scientists may be unsure of potentially dele
terious side effects. So an implicit agreement is forged
between the doctor and volunteer. Having given his in
formed consent, a volunteer acknowledges that he un
derstands the purpose, methodology and benefits and
risks of the trial in which he will participate. The doc
tor must minimize the risks in the trial, and bring it to
an abrupt halt should he detect even an inkling of ad
verse consequences above the acceptable risk inherent
in any study involving humans.
In rare circumstances, however, you'll have an ambi
tious physician who, in his quest to rescue the world from
death s grip, could err towards the side of risk. Or you
could have a doctor performing a clinical trial who holds
a disconcertingly keen interest in making sure a drug
jumps through hoops as swiftly as possible, perhaps due
to increased funding for other trials from a pharmaceuti
cal conglomerate. In these cases of conflicting alle
giances, the institution must stop the trial before some
thing important such as patient safety is compromised.
Thus, every clinical trial in the United States is ap

proved and monitored by an Institutional Review Board,
IRB, which is composed of an independent committee of
physicians and community members who ensure that a
clinical trial is ethical, and, more importantly, that the
rights and safety of the study participants are protected.
With the voluminous amount of research occurring at
the Medical School, it is not surprising that Stanford has
three IRBs — one of which. I am a member of.
The IRB that approved the clinical trials involving
Viagra must have done so with a smirk — and. if they
were professors emeriti, perhaps also with a glimmer of
hope. The scientific community was initially skeptical
of a magical pill that could cure erectile dysfunction.
Scientists believed that impotence stemmed from un
resolved psychological issues. Such a thought was dis
pelled during an American Urological Association
meeting, however, when a psychiatrist dropped his
pants to demonstrate to skeptics once and for all that a
penile injection of phenoxybenzamine — a compound
found in Viagra — could cause an erection. There was
a sudden burst of interest, and clinical trials came out
of the works at a punishing pace.
In 1994, during phase II investigations, the drug
worked so well that men fought relentlessly to get
themselves into trials and refused to return unused
pills. Even after the trials ended, Pfizer continued to
dispense tablets out of compassion: Divorced men
were sending poignant letters of how impotence had
broken up their first marriage, and how they didn't

want it to happen again.
Since the FDA's approval, 16 million people have
used the pill to improve their sexual well-being. On its
Web site, the FDA warns that a number of side effects
have been reported for Viagra use, including heart at
tack, stroke, chest pain and increased blood pressure.
These warnings should be seriously contemplated: A few
years back, I remember reading that an older gentleman,
after taking a double-dose of Viagra, croaked while in
the middle of his performance.
I wasn't sure if 1 felt more sympathy for the man or for
his partner.
The FDA, additionally, lists two special notes: "Via
gra can cause a rare but serious condition of prolonged
erection (priapism). It is important to contact your
health care provider immediately if your erection lasts
longer than four hours."' And, understatedly: "Men for
whom sexual activity is inadvisable may not be good can
didates for Viagra."
So there you have it. Important information straight
from the venerable FDA, culled from studies pub
lished by the near slave labor of inadequately paid sci
entists and medical professors testing the safety and ef
ficacy of the drug so that you, the consumer, could be
sufficiently forewarned.
