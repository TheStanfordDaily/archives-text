## CDC an underutilized resource 
### 
Students who use the Career Development
Center regularly find it extremely valuable in
guiding them to jobs and career paths, but for
various reasons many students do not take full
advantage of its resources. Students need to be more
proactive in seeking out the CDC's services, but the
University also has a role to play in helping the center
to increase awareness and visibility on campus.
Many students attend CDC-sponsored career
fairs or use its MonsterTrak services, but these well
publicized offerings launch careers for only a small
minority of students. Fewer students realize that the
CDC's resource library provides job-search tips for
nearly every career imaginable, as well as more gen
eral advice regarding networking, interviewing and
salary negotiation. Career counselors are available
for general consultations, resume reviews and mock
interviews, and they even set aside time for same
day appointments.
We urge graduating seniors, as well as students
searching for internships, to take advantage of not
only the Cardinal Recruiting and Cardinal Careers re
sources, but also all the additional — and often more
valuable — resources mentioned above. The first step
in this process is to call the center and make an ap

pointment with a career counselor. Even for under
classmen, it is not too early to start thinking about in
ternships or life after Stanford.
A compelling argument could be made for the CDC
to receive more funding and more attention from the
University to expand its services and student outreach
efforts. The center's potential value is immense, not
only to students in the short-term but to the University
in the long-term. A better-funded and more widely uti
lized CDC may not only improve the careers of Stan
ford graduates, but also generate increased goodwill
among alumni. For example, according to University
statistics, there seems to be a correlation over the past
decade between Senior Gift contributions and the frac
tion of seniors who graduate with a job.
The CDC has been forced to tighten its belt after
suffering budget cuts the past two years. In today's
economy, with high unemployment among college
graduates, the CDC needs more funding, not less.
Now that the worst of budget cuts have passed, senior
University administrators should consider increasing
CDC funding to allow the center to do more to publi
cize its services. At this point, a lack of awareness is the
main obstacle to a more widely utilized and more ef
fective CDC.
