'Stalinisf Daily can't bully
ASSU Senate
The ASSU Senate should be con
gratulated on being the only sensible
figure in this crudely fashioned circus
of campus politics. Despite The Daily's
incessant attempts to frighten the Sen
ate into voting in favor of Lee / Mefford
with a horde of editorial articles hap
hazardly touting the words "free
speech" (keeping in mind that the en
tire Daily editorial board are vehe
ment Lee / Mefford supporters), the
Senate was able to fight past intimida
tion and do what they knew was right.
By refusing to certify the original
elections yet again, they have shown that
they will not tolerate those who violate
the rules. More so, they have set a prece
dent by showing that they will not be bul
lied by the Constitutional Council and
the Stalinist Stamford Daily into endors
ing an election that negatively impacted
more than 12,000 Stanford students.
The Daily can continue to take out
of context the quotes of ethnic-minori
ty senators and not so subtly add cre
dence to the Lee / Mefford arguments,
but it cannot take away from the justice
that the ASSU Senate has done amidst
a wave of unjust and ludicrous campus
political proceedings.

ASSU must resolve power struggle
Is anyone in charge here ? I ask be
cause it doesn't appear so from the
handling of this year's ASSU executive
election. The recent decision of the
Undergraduate Senate to reject the ad
vice of the Constitutional Council and
thereby refuse, fora second time, to
certify the result of the original ASSU
Executive election proves the point.
A month ago the Senate decided
not to certify the original election.
Weeks later, the Constitutional Coun
cil found no constitutional basis for the
decision not to certify and recommend
ed the Senate reverse its decision.
Then, this past Monday, the Senate

reaffirmed its previous decision while
still not providing any constitutional
justification for that decision. And, ac
cording to Tuesday's lead article,
"Senate again refuses to certify elec
tion," it appears entirely possible for
the Constitutional Council to again
strike down the Senate's decision.
Should that occur, how will the Senate
respond? Will it once again refuse to
certify the original results? Will that
decision he reviewed by the Constitu
tional Council? Will this back and
forth ever end?
It is clear to me that the ASSU Con
stitution must be amended to clarify
the relationship between the Senate
and the Constitutional Council so that
this fiasco can be avoided in the future.
In my opinion, the Constitutional
Council should be the final arbiter of
all constitutional issues, including
those of campaign misconduct. If the
ASSU Constitution is based on the
United States Constitution, let's make
the Constitutional Council our version
of the Supreme Court. I urge the Sen
ate and the Graduate Student Council
to act on this issue immediately.
In the meantime, I say we acknowl
edge that this year's ASSU executive
election has been damaged beyond re
pair. We should put an end to this back
and forth and go without an ASSU
president and vice president for the
2004-2005 academic year. Instead, the
Senate chair and the Graduate Stu
dent Council chair can split the re
sponsibilities of the ASSU executive.
At this point, they possess more legiti
macy that any of the possible ASSU
executive slates.
With this matter finally closed, the
ASSU can focus its energy on regain
ing the respect and trust of both the stu
dent body and administration.

Eve 6 a bod choice for spring concert
Yesterday evening, I had the privi
lege of witnessing two members of the
SCN pasting up the now-übiquitous
posters for our Spring Fling free con

cert at Frost Amphitheatre. Exciting!
Last year, we got Ozomatli, which
rocked. I heard that before I got here,
they got Phil Lesh (and that he even
volunteered to come again). But this
year, we bear witness to the musical
stylings of — get excited — Eve 6!
If you are a) not impressed, b) disap
pointed ore) completely, obscenely and
(admittedly inappropriately) outraged,
then you are sane and your soul is still in
one piece. On behalf of every student
here who remembers feeling like this
band was a little derivative of already
derivative bands such as Seven Mary
Three and Marcy Playground, I just
want to ask the Stanford Concert Net
work: "What the hell happened?"
The only thing we expect the SCN
to do annually is throw one kick-ass
concert for free, in the spring, at the un
derused-but-awesome Frost Am
phitheatre. Instead, we are getting a
mediocre (at best) concert on Wilbur
Field. This is what our special-fees
money has purchased? I mean. Eve 6?
Is that some horrifying belated April
Fool's joke? I apologize to all the Eve 6
fans out there and those hard workers
over at the SCN, but this absolutely,
unequivocally sucks.
To those super-sleuth investigative
reporters at The Daily, find out where
all the Stanford Concert Network's
money went. Because it certainly
didn't go towards booking cool and ac
tually enjoyable bands.

Berkeley has women, not girls
You really refer to your female stu
dents as "girls" in your paper ("Three
freshmen's luck of the draw," May
12)? Nice. Man, I'm glad I work at Cal
and not Stanford. I like working with
women. And men. We don't have any
boys or girls at Berkeley.
When people ask me about the dif
ference between Cal and Stanford, this
is the kind of thing I point out.
