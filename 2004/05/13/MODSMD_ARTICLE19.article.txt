# THE 						BROOKLYN BRAT
## Time to release your inner freak 
### 
This week, there will be no ice
cream, cookies or cake in my
kitchen. I have cut back on
my 10 snacks a day and
changed my morning bike route to
avoid the temptation of Moonbeans.
Last night, I did 200 crunches before
going to bed, and for the first time in
over a year, I might even find my way
to the gym by the end of the week. No,
I don't have a newfound appreciation
for healthy living; I am just prepping
for this weekend's Exotic Erotic party.
While it may not be on the official
list of 101 things to do before graduat
ing, going to Exotic Erotic is a must —
even if it's just for five minutes to catch
a glimpse of the sketchy security
guards patting down partygoers
dressed only in their edible body paint.
Last year alone, there were at least
five guys walking around in just their
tuxedos (condoms, that is) and more
than a handful of girls donning body
tape in the place of clothing. Two
years ago, there was the famous girl
who taped her pigtails to her chest as a
shirt, and of course every year at least
a few people stroll over from Synergy
in nothing more than their birthday
suits — an all-too-familiar scene for
anyone who has ever gone to Full
Moon on the Quad.
The party isn't just about what peo
ple may or may not be wearing. There
is honestly no better place to strike up

a conversation with the cute person
from your Monday night discussion
section, and if you have ever wondered

what your best
friend looks like
naked, just make
sure they are
going to Exotic
Erotic, and then
tag along.
If you still
aren't convinced
to strip down to
your test pair of
tighty-whiteys or

your laciest, most see-through bra, re
member that with the new Alcohol
Policy, an increasingly strict Office of
Student Activities and the conser
vatism of Hoover Tower casting a
shadow on the campus, a party like Ex
otic Erotic is our only reminder that we
do in fact live in the Bay Area, the Lib
eral Capital of the World.
Hearing about Exotic Erotic for the
first time as a freshman, 1 had decided
that it was just too raunchy for my taste.
But when a friend came over with her
collection of body stockings and
crotch-less panties, 1 decided to just
give it a go. By the end of the night 1 had
been flashed over a dozen times, intro
duced to the guy wearing just a sock
and given a ride home on the roof of a
golf cart. And since you can't get that
everv day sitting in a dorm lounge, I fig

ured the night was well worth it for me.
This year promises to be equally ex
citing and even boasts a few guest ap
pearances by Stanford VIPs, including
members of the Stanford PD, the
OS A's Joey Greenwelt, the groper and,
if we're really lucky, the mountain lion.
I'm sure that by now I have whet
your appetite and you are dreaming of
corsets and condoms and chains, oh
my! But before you dust off your tae
bo tapes and try to cram MTV's three
month "flab to fab" regime into just a
few days, consider first a trip to the
mall. Savers, or your drawmates' clos
ets. After all, there is a very strict dress
code: one article of clothing for men
and two for ladies.
If in the end you decide not to
spend $300 on the new leather-and
lace combo at Victoria's Secret, re
member that the mini skirt every girl
wears to lecture will probably prove to
be very fitting for the occasion. As for
me, if my workout regime doesn't
leave me looking like J. Lo, my two
items of clothing might just be jeans
and a sweatshirt.

diet or exercise but still plans to strip
down Saturday night. E-mail her at
