## Let's get creative with classes 
### 
I can remember the exact moment
I decided that Stanford was the
place I was going to spend the
next four years of my life. I was
on a plane from Newark, N.J. to
Houston, Texas, having just finished
six consecutive days of Admit Week
end visits, and I realized that dreary
winters and competitive colleagues
couldn't beat sunny weather and laid
back students. As best as I can re
member, I was pretty pleased with my
choice back then, and have been ever
since; well, until yesterday that is.
What, you might ask, could cause
such a drastic reversal? A cowing
confrontation with a Cowell Cluster
co-ed? Never. A failing foray into
French philosophy? Pshaw. No, the
event that triggered my own change
of heart was much more biting than
any romantic or academic setback.
The disaster that I am referring to is
my harrowing discovery that right
now, as I write this column, students
at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in
Troy, New York, are minoring in
video game studies.
Video game studies. You can't
imagine with what great pain I write
this. Here I am, studying Kantian eth
ical theory and Hamiltonian mechan
ics like a damned chump, and over
one hundred students at RPI are at
tending lectures on X-Box and Grand
Theft Auto. This is like Michael Jor
dan realizing he's attending a college
that doesn't have a basketball pro
gram. The word devastating doesn't
even begin to describe the sordid
emotional cocktail that this discovery
poured down my figurative throat.
After eventually recovering from
this shock — and it is important to

note that I am using the word "recov
er" in the same way that one might
say "I hope My Uncle Cletus is recov
ers from losing his legs in that freak
deli-slicer incident" — I realized how
shortsighted my friends at RPI were
being. Once you've had the monu
mental idea that a topic such as video
games is worthy of departmental sta
tus, how can you stop there? How can
you leave so many other equally tan
talizing pursuits on the outside look
ing in?
To remedy this tremendous over
sight, I have compiled a list of the top
three fields of study that, in this
columnist's humble opinion, deserve
to be similarly recognized as worthy
of academic status:
Number 1: Sports observation
It's a damn shame that we attend
one of the premier athletic and aca
demic institutions in the world, and
yet so rarely do the twain converge.
Well, if 1 had my way, that would be a
problem no longer. Intro-level classes
in fascinating topics such as "Why Do
Those Guys in Funny Outfits Keep
Banging Into Each Other?" could
give way to upper-division seminars
like "Advanced Peanut Shelling II"
and "Chants From the Stands: Child
ish Banter or Sophisticated Psych-
Outs?"
Number 2: Interdisciplinary stud
ies in Beirut
How is it possible that the Univer
sity is overlooking such a brilliant op
portunity to both capture the hearts
and minds of the student body and to
combine such a compelling variety of
fields? Classes within ISB would
range from topics in the hard sci
ences, like "ISB Aerodynamics B:

Cup Blowing" to more fuzzy subjects
like "Drunken Hookups: The role of
alcohol as social lubricant." I can't be
the only person itching to write his
honors thesis on the ritualistic inter
pretations of various rejection proce
dures, can I? Let's get this done, peo
ple.
Number 3: Comparative studies in
reality television
Tolstoy? Camus? Dickens? Could
these guys be more irrelevant to mod
ern society? Students these days are
way more interested in ElimiDate
than L'Etranger, Why haven't our
academic departments caught up
with them? How is it possible that I
can study "The Culture of Tragedy in
a Comparative Perspective" in a re
spected department, but if I'm inter
ested in the changing role in conflict
from the original Real World to Sur
vivor All-Stars, I have to go under
ground? And we call this a world
class research institution.
Now, obviously I don't expect the
University to adopt all of these
changes right away. Not only would it
be a gigantic administrative task, but
I also have a strong feeling that it
would lead to a lot of empty class
rooms in our more "traditional" de
partments. In the meantime, howev
er, 1 invite all of you to join me in
racking up RPI transfer credits on the
Play Station.
