# OP-ED
## Pro fro's op-ed warrants discussion 
### ROBIN MAMLET 
I know that many of you have read
a commentary from last Sunday's
Washington Post written by a prospec
tive freshman who recently visited
campus during Admit Weekend. Stan
ford is not cast in a particularly positive
light from this student's vantage point,
and I know that some current students
and other Admit Weekend guests feel
upset by some of the comments.
I see this article as an invitation for
discussion as a community, not for
discouragement or disappointment.
The devotion and commitment that
some 1,500 current students, nearly
100 faculty members and dozens of
staff members and administrators
made to our newest admits was truly
remarkable. Your love of Stanford
was obvious and your desire to ex
tend the Stanford spirit to every visi
tor was inspiring.

At the foundation of our communi
ty is a commitment to dialogue and
openness. The opportunity we all now
have to engage in a meaningful conver
sation about Admit Weekend togeth
er, to be respectful in our assessments
and genuine in our views, is an oppor
tunity we should welcome.
1 hope that you will read this stu
dent's personal experiences and dis
cuss the issues she raises with your
friends, classmates and colleagues.
Does Admit Weekend allow visitors
to see the real side of Stanford?
What else can we do to encourage
admits to truly experience if this
campus is the best fit for them? How
can we balance a packed three-day
schedule that showcases all our re
sources with a high school senior's
desire for independence?
Many of you have already dis
cussed such questions around dinner
tables and on campus lists. We on the

admission staff were thinking seriously
about some of these concerns even be
fore they appeared in the national
press. We recognize that some stu
dents could be turned off by an indi
vidual piece of the weekend, and we
are always striving to improve the full
three-day program.
Can the overall Admit Weekend
experience be strengthened in the fu
ture? Of course. And with the contin
ued support and energy that you give
to this open discussion, I have every
confidence that it will.
I thank you for the thoughtful con
tributions many of you have already
made to this conversation, and I look
forward to hearing your additional
thoughts and reactions.
