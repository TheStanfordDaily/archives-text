## Tale of a jaded pro fro 
### YAMANDA WRIGHT 
Imagine my surprise Monday after
ntxrn when I checked my e-mail and
came upon a piece in the Washington
Post written by my former pro fro,
Sarah Ball, caustically criticizing Admit
Weekend. The title of the article, "This
Pro-Fro's A No-Go," was almost as
rudimentary as its content.
Her argument was essentially that
Stanford's Admit Weekend gives an
unrealistic, exaggerated representa
tion of campus life to prospective
frosh. 1 promptly gagged on my bite
sized Snickers at this brashly oversim
plified assertion. Like-minded stu
dents join the chorus in asking what
the hell she expected.
Indeed, it is quite unfortunate that
the University cannot host prospective
freshmen for an entire year so they
may experience campus life in its most
raw form; that house hosts don't cus
tomize programming to each high
school senior's social anxieties and
food allergies; and that the sun was un
realistically bright that Thursday
morning. Such is life.
Note to self: Remind the University

to showcase its racists, boring classes
and leftover, post-Parent-Weekend
dining next year.
Admittedly, as a pro fro last year 1
found Admit Weekend to be over
cooked and overwhelming, but I un
derstood that embellishment is the na
ture of these types of events. Practical
pro fros come to take the hustle and
bustle of Admit Weekend in stride, un
derstanding that Stanford freshmen
don't play name games and walk into
the middle of the Quad belting "ohhh
hh-eight!" at the top of their lungs for
everyday recreation.
The four-day extravaganza is not a
lie marathon for which administrators
hire phony professors and enthusiastic
actor-students, but a hyper-concen
trated presentation of Stanford's best
resources. Many of the students who
look back merrily on their Admit
Weekend experience remember the
time spent with their peers in between
scavenger hunts and ego-boosting wel
come speeches.
Then I remembered: Stop the
presses, Sarah was only here for one
day! She dropped her bags off in my
room Thursday afternoon and told me

that she was flying back to her home
town early the next morning because
her high school crew team had a regat
ta that weekend.
It seemed a bit strange to me that a
pro fro would travel clear across the
country fora one-day visit; however, I
chocked it up to a dedication to rowing.
Maybe she wrote about crew in her ap
plication essay, who knows.
But when she proceeded to tell me
that she wanted to take a run around
Campus Drive during dinner and in
house programming, I began to sus
pect either an ulterior agenda or a syn
drome. Funny how Sarah could form
such a passionate opinion of campus
life and Stanford students based on a
single day of dragging luggage, jogging
alone and sitting awkwardly on a couch
in the Branner lounge for two hours.
She complained that HoHos and
RoHos were too enthusiastic in wel
coming and introducing the pro fros, as
if iciness and disinterest would have
made the campus more hospitable.
Her claim that "ethnic" and LGBT
events excluded heterosexual white
people was based solely on their focus
on non-white cultural themes and

queer issues, not from actually visiting
and being ostracized. There is a fine
line between feeling uncomfortable in
social settings and applying that awk
wardness to dismiss the entire Admit
Weekend program.
Ball was pleasant enough during her
whopping 10-hour stay at Stanford not
three weeks ago, replete with thank
you's and a few "it was a-MAY-zing"
statements of her own. I still ask myself
what turned this soft-spoken high
school senior from Alexandria, Va.
into a mordant critic.
Despite her unapologetically
tweaked, jaded retelling of the Admit
Weekend events, what angered me
(and presumably most students) most
was the tone of the article. She seemed
to take pride in rejecting Stanford, as if
her refusal was a devastating blow to
the school itself. I will stoop to her level
in saying that choosing to go to Duke
may well be the best decision she has
made since April. Merry Christmas,
North Carolina.

room Thursday afternoon and told me

that she was flying back to her home
town early the next morning because
her high school crew team had a regat
ta that weekend.
It seemed a bit strange to me that a
pro fro would travel clear across the
country fora one-day visit; however, I
chocked it up to a dedication to rowing.
Maybe she wrote about crew in her ap
plication essay, who knows.
But when she proceeded to tell me
that she wanted to take a run around
Campus Drive during dinner and in
house programming, I began to sus
pect either an ulterior agenda or a syn
drome. Funny how Sarah could form
such a passionate opinion of campus
life and Stanford students based on a
single day of dragging luggage, jogging
alone and sitting awkwardly on a couch
in the Branner lounge for two hours.
She complained that HoHos and
RoHos were too enthusiastic in wel
coming and introducing the pro fros, as
if iciness and disinterest would have
made the campus more hospitable.
Her claim that "ethnic" and LGBT
events excluded heterosexual white
people was based solely on their focus
on non-white cultural themes and

queer issues, not from actually visiting
and being ostracized. There is a fine
line between feeling uncomfortable in
social settings and applying that awk
wardness to dismiss the entire Admit
Weekend program.
Ball was pleasant enough during her
whopping 10-hour stay at Stanford not
three weeks ago, replete with thank
you's and a few "it was a-MAY-zing"
statements of her own. I still ask myself
what turned this soft-spoken high
school senior from Alexandria, Va.
into a mordant critic.
Despite her unapologetically
tweaked, jaded retelling of the Admit
Weekend events, what angered me
(and presumably most students) most
was the tone of the article. She seemed
to take pride in rejecting Stanford, as if
her refusal was a devastating blow to
the school itself. I will stoop to her level
in saying that choosing to go to Duke
may well be the best decision she has
made since April. Merry Christmas,
North Carolina.
