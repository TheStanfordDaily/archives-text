## NBA's best should show for Olympics 
### 
The excuses are piling up like the calls for
Donald Rumsfeld to resign. Jason Kidd's
knee needs time to heal. Kevin Garnett
can't be bothered to make the commit
ment. Vince Carter is getting married. Shaq just
doesn't want to go. Karl Malone fears for his safe
ty. Kobe Bryant has to be at his rape trial — I
guess that's a legitimate excuse (well, he could
have just kept his dick in his pants, but he is an
NBA superstar, so he really should be excused).
Any way you look at it, U.S.A. Basketball
won't be sending its best over to Athens for the
2004 Summer Games.
Kidd's knee certainly looked okay when he put
up that triple-double in Tuesday's win over De
troit. Carter couldn't have planned his wedding at
a different time? The Diesel couldn't just get off
his lazy ass?
Maybe all these guys are all legitimately con
cerned about their safety and just don't want to
take anv kind of risk. But it's not

like they bothered to show up at
last year's World Champi
onships when the United States
finished an embarassing sixth,
so it's hard to say that the $1.18
billion that is being spent on se
curity in Athens is the problem.
Although, why should these
guys take any kind of risk? Most
of them are wrapped up in $100
million dollar contracts with
their respective NBA teams.

Why should Shaq care about representing his
country? After all, he already has his souvenir gold
medal. He's put in his time.
But when did putting on a U.S.A. jersey be
come a chore? It used to be that the Olympics
were the pinnacle of athletic achievement. And
for athletes competing in sports like track and
field, gymnastics and swimming, they still are.
However, for most potential members of the
U.S.A. Senior National men's basketball team,
their primary loyalty is to their NBA team, rather
than to their country. An NBA Championship is
the ultimate achievement, not a gold medal.
The problem is, the phenomenon is hardly lim
ited to the sport of basketball or American ath
letes. In virtually any Olympic sport where ath
letes have great monetary opportunities, athletes
are running from the Summer Games faster than
Damon Stoudamire and Ty Law run from the po
lice.
Kim Clijsters isn't competing because the Bel
gian tennis team has an apparel contract with Adi
das and she is signed with Fila. Is that for real?
There's someone who really needs a new rep. I
could have told her that a fake injury would have
served her better.
And while Venus and Serena Williams have as
sured the public that they will be in attendance,
both have made statements that have hinted oth
erwise.
Sure, there are the exceptions. Amare
Stoudemire is practically begging to be on the U.S.
team — and he will most likely get his wish, thanks
to Karl Malone, Elton Brand and Kevin Garnett.
Stoudemire is about the only NBA player who
displays the attitude of a true Olympic athlete.
"You're taking a chance in anything you do in
life. I just want to play for my country,"
Stoudemire told Marc Stein.
Andy Roddick is another athlete who shows
the same selflessness as Stoudemire. When asked
what he would most like to win this year, Roddick
wanted a gold medal at the Olympics — not Wim
bledon and the £602.500 that go along with that
title.
But because athletes like Stoudemire and Rod
dick are so few and far between in the big-money
sports, the Olympics aren't what they should be in
those events.
The Olympic Games are supposed to be a com
petition between the absolute best. Instead, it's a
competition between the best who actually care
enough to show up.
In tennis and men's basketball (the women still
seem happy to be there), Olympic competition
should just be scrapped altogether. It's an embar
rassment to the sport, a slap in the face to the
Olympics — and who really wants to be one of the
athletes who has to hear, "Well, the United States
would have run all over the competition if the
Americans had Shaq rather than Kenyon Mar
tin."
K-Mart may think he's as good as Shaq, but
he's surely the only one.
Yeah. I realize that we were all spoiled by the
first Dream Team, but why should we expect any
thing less?
While there's no doubt that international
teams have improved, the United States is still the
premiere source of hoops talent. It's tough to
imagine why Stu Jackson can't manage to put to
gether a dominant team.
Even U.S. head coach Larry Brown has
seemed to concede that there's a strong possibility
the U.S. team won't being seeing gold this sum
mer.
"The four years that have transpired since Syd
ney, the [other) teams have gotten better, the play
ers have gotten better," Brown told the Associat
ed Press. "And maybe we're not sending the very
best, but we'll be well represented and I'm confi
dent they'll do well."
That's a far cry from 1988, when gold was a
foregone conclusion and the actual Games served
as highlight reel for M.J. and Co.
And while I don't know what can be done
about the further slide of basketball and tennis as
Olympic sports, I do know one thing — those are
two things I won't be in front of the television for
come August.

bledon and the £602.500 that go along with that
title.
But because athletes like Stoudemire and Rod
dick are so few and far between in the big-money
sports, the Olympics aren't what they should be in
those events.
The Olympic Games are supposed to be a com
petition between the absolute best. Instead, it's a
competition between the best who actually care
enough to show up.
In tennis and men's basketball (the women still
seem happy to be there), Olympic competition
should just be scrapped altogether. It's an embar
rassment to the sport, a slap in the face to the
Olympics — and who really wants to be one of the
athletes who has to hear, "Well, the United States
would have run all over the competition if the
Americans had Shaq rather than Kenyon Mar
tin."
K-Mart may think he's as good as Shaq, but
he's surely the only one.
Yeah. I realize that we were all spoiled by the
first Dream Team, but why should we expect any
thing less?
While there's no doubt that international
teams have improved, the United States is still the
premiere source of hoops talent. It's tough to
imagine why Stu Jackson can't manage to put to
gether a dominant team.
Even U.S. head coach Larry Brown has
seemed to concede that there's a strong possibility
the U.S. team won't being seeing gold this sum
mer.
"The four years that have transpired since Syd
ney, the [other) teams have gotten better, the play
ers have gotten better," Brown told the Associat
ed Press. "And maybe we're not sending the very
best, but we'll be well represented and I'm confi
dent they'll do well."
That's a far cry from 1988, when gold was a
foregone conclusion and the actual Games served
as highlight reel for M.J. and Co.
And while I don't know what can be done
about the further slide of basketball and tennis as
Olympic sports, I do know one thing — those are
two things I won't be in front of the television for
come August.

The excuses are piling up like the calls for
Donald Rumsfeld to resign. Jason Kidd's
knee needs time to heal. Kevin Garnett
can't be bothered to make the commit
ment. Vince Carter is getting married. Shaq just
doesn't want to go. Karl Malone fears for his safe
ty. Kobe Bryant has to be at his rape trial — I
guess that's a legitimate excuse (well, he could
have just kept his dick in his pants, but he is an
NBA superstar, so he really should be excused).
Any way you look at it, U.S.A. Basketball
won't be sending its best over to Athens for the
2004 Summer Games.
Kidd's knee certainly looked okay when he put
up that triple-double in Tuesday's win over De
troit. Carter couldn't have planned his wedding at
a different time? The Diesel couldn't just get off
his lazy ass?
Maybe all these guys are all legitimately con
cerned about their safety and just don't want to
take anv kind of risk. But it's not

like they bothered to show up at
last year's World Champi
onships when the United States
finished an embarassing sixth,
so it's hard to say that the $1.18
billion that is being spent on se
curity in Athens is the problem.
Although, why should these
guys take any kind of risk? Most
of them are wrapped up in $100
million dollar contracts with
their respective NBA teams.

Why should Shaq care about representing his
country? After all, he already has his souvenir gold
medal. He's put in his time.
But when did putting on a U.S.A. jersey be
come a chore? It used to be that the Olympics
were the pinnacle of athletic achievement. And
for athletes competing in sports like track and
field, gymnastics and swimming, they still are.
However, for most potential members of the
U.S.A. Senior National men's basketball team,
their primary loyalty is to their NBA team, rather
than to their country. An NBA Championship is
the ultimate achievement, not a gold medal.
The problem is, the phenomenon is hardly lim
ited to the sport of basketball or American ath
letes. In virtually any Olympic sport where ath
letes have great monetary opportunities, athletes
are running from the Summer Games faster than
Damon Stoudamire and Ty Law run from the po
lice.
Kim Clijsters isn't competing because the Bel
gian tennis team has an apparel contract with Adi
das and she is signed with Fila. Is that for real?
There's someone who really needs a new rep. I
could have told her that a fake injury would have
served her better.
And while Venus and Serena Williams have as
sured the public that they will be in attendance,
both have made statements that have hinted oth
erwise.
Sure, there are the exceptions. Amare
Stoudemire is practically begging to be on the U.S.
team — and he will most likely get his wish, thanks
to Karl Malone, Elton Brand and Kevin Garnett.
Stoudemire is about the only NBA player who
displays the attitude of a true Olympic athlete.
"You're taking a chance in anything you do in
life. I just want to play for my country,"
Stoudemire told Marc Stein.
Andy Roddick is another athlete who shows
the same selflessness as Stoudemire. When asked
what he would most like to win this year, Roddick
wanted a gold medal at the Olympics — not Wim
bledon and the £602.500 that go along with that
title.
