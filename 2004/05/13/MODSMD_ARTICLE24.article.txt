# No. 1 Card hosts NCAAs
## 
### MIA LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's a case of May madness for the top
ranked Stanford women's tennis team (23-
0) as it enters the first round of NCAA
Championships at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium tomorrow.
The Cardinal has been a cornerstone of
the national tournament since its debut in
1982, finishing in fourth place or higher
every year except one. For the last five
years, Stanford's domineering courtside
manner has landed it in the finals.
But despite its stellar, decades-old track
record, defeat was a bitter pill for Stanford
to swallow in 2003, when it dropped the
final decision to Florida on Gator turf. 4-3.
Now, after a flawless regular season run
in 2004, the Cardinal's NCAA battle scars
have all but healed. Stanford's lone re
minder of loss takes the form of a second
seeding in the NCAA tournament, behind
top-seeded Florida.
While old match results die hard and the
taste of revenge should be ever-so-sweet,
the Cardinal's visions of final victory cur
rently lie just beyond the horizon, just be
yond tomorrow's homecourt showdown
against Quinnipiac (16-4).
Wait, Quinnipi-who? After staging a 4-
0 shutout of Long Island in late April, the
Northeast Conference Champions re
ceived an automatic bid into NCAA action
for the first time in their history.
In fact, tomorrow's first-round match
will mark the first time Quinnipiac has ever
faced Stanford in any sporting event.
Not to be underestimated, the No. 74
squad's head coach, Mike Quitko, has 13
years of experience, which came to un
precedented fruition this year. Doubling as
head coach of the Bobcats' men's tennis
team, Quitko has the honor of sending both
men's and women's teams off to 2004
NCAAs.
"Being at a fabulous place like Quinnip
iac and to experience this with the kids ...
I'm just ecstatic right now," Quitko said in
a recent press release.
With 17 consecutive Pacific-10 Confer
ence titles, the Cardinal's lineup, led by
head coach and Pac-10 Coach of the Year
Lele Forood, has experience and prestige
that will be nearly impossible to beat.
With the odds stacked strongly in Stan
ford's favor, both teams are excited and
ready to give it their all.
"During the year we play a mixture of
tough teams and ones that aren't so
strong," said Stanford's Alice Barnes, a
sophomore. "We're professional about it

in the sense that we have the mindset to
maintain focus against any opponent. This
match will be a great opportunity to prac
tice being aggressive."
Dominating in the No. 2 singles slot,
Barnes (33-6) is No. 10 in the national rank
ings and has never been ranked lower than
No. 21 in her collegiate career. Barnes has
dropped only one dual match in her career
and her accomplishments have earned her
First-Team All-Pac-10 honors.
Barnes's doubles partner, sophomore
Amber Liu, has also been named First
Team All-Pac 10 as a result of her singles
and doubles prowess. No. 7 Liu, the de
fending NCAA singles champion, has tal
lied a 15-4 record and is poised to lead the
team through any challenges that come
their way.
" Right now, I don't feel like there's a lot
of pressure because of our seeding and be
cause we've been working so hard," Liu
said. "I have a lot of confidence in [myself]
and the rest of my team that we're going to
show up to play 100 percent. It's more of a
comforting feeling."
With a three-week lull in match play
since Pac-10 Individual Championships in
April, the team has enjoyed the opportuni
ty to step up practice routines.
"Everything's going really well,"
Barnes said. "It's really nice to have the
break and catch up on any of the technical
aspects of your game that might be going
wrong. When you play a lot of matches, you
get really match-fit but can lose some ag
gressiveness."
Taking second place in the Pac-10 Indi
viduals, Barnes's most recent match was a
strong showing in the finals against Califor
nia's top-ranked Raquel Kops-Jones.
Barnes fought hard but lost in straight sets,
6-3,6-4.
"It feels good to just get to review your
game, check everything and come out more
confident," Barnes said.
Building confidence had received spe
cial emphasis in the doubles arena this sea
son â€” because a doubles win last year
could have made all the difference against
Florida.
With all three of its doubles teams
ranked No. 56 or higher, Stanford has built
a powerhouse of tandem talent. In the reg
ular season, where doubles matches pre
cede singles and set the tone for the rest of
the dual match, Stanford lost the doubles
point only once.
Stanford's top-ranked duo of senior
Lauren Barnikow and junior Erin Bur
dette (27-2) has been named the Pac-10
Doubles Team of the Year for the second

season in row.
Meanwhile, Barnes teamed up with
Burdette for the first time at Pac-10 Indi
viduals, and came out with a title and a No.
15 ranking.
"More than anything, our team's suc
cesses show that we're flexible," Barnes

said. "We can all play with different part
ners and it really shows the depth of our
team."
Match play begins at 10 a.m. tomorrow,
with Stanford also hosting a Denver-Michi
gan showdown. The Stanford-Quinnipiac
match will follow at 2 p.m.
