# Women's lacrosse misses playoffs
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was a season of one-goal heart breakers
for the Stanford women's lacrosse team.
The Cardinal (9-9) lost four games this sea
son by a single goal, including last week
end's Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
championship game against California, 1 1-
10.
Cal's narrow win was the first one out of
four consecutive attempts as Stanford had

prevailed in the past three conference cham
pionships, qualifying the Cardinal for
NCAAs.
"Getting to the NCAAs last year, our
players hoped for that again," said head
coach Michele Uhlfelder. "It was a goal we
didn't reach, something we didn't attain,
and that's definitely disappointing."
In addition to Saturday's defeat at the
hands of the Golden Bears, the team also
lost by one goal in an overtime game against
Ohio State and in back-to-back contests

against Vanderbilt and Dartmouth. Al
though they were tallied in the wrong col
umn, these games prove that Stanford has
the ability to compete with the best, as the
three teams were ranked in the top 20 at the
time of play.
"We had a national schedule this season,
and our team should be given credit for the
amount of times we put ourselves on the
line," Uhlfelder said. "Game after game,
we're always preparing for the next big
team. We know that makes us better, but we
also know that we're going to take our
lumps."
The year's tough schedule took its toll on
the team as it struggled with its intensity
level during some of the games toward the
end of the season.
"We were battling some fatigue,"
Uhlfelder said. "We were battling it well,
but we were battling it for the latter portion
of our season."
Against No. 8 Northwestern on April 9,
the earnestness did not emerge until the last
10 minutes or so of the game, causing the
Cardinal to lose, 11-5.
Similarly, No. 4 Loyola came out strong
at the beginning on April 24 and nabbed an
early lead. Despite its efforts, the Cardinal
did not put up a tough fight until the final 20
minutes against the Greyhounds and lost,
16-8.
"That's something that's plagued us all
year," Uhlfelder said." I think it's just a mat
ter of us needing to work harder and need
ing to have a higher tolerance for hard
work."
Despite the tough schedule, the team
learned some invaluable lessons this year.
Stanford's improvement in shot selection
began to show at the MPSF tournament last
weekend. Bad shot selection doomed the
team in past games as the players often felt
pressured, rushing to take shots instead of
waiting for better opportunities.
"(Last weekend], we had some players
who realized 'that's a bad shot to take' and
didn't take [those shots], and that's a big vic
tory for our team," Uhlfelder said. "People
executed the play and held that she t to wait
and get what we really wanted. However,

we still had players taking bad shots on Sat
urday, but when you lose at the end of the
season in a hard fought match, the law of re
cency says maybe that [lesson | might stick
for next year."
Using this season to guide them, the
team is already looking ahead and prepar
ing for next year. The coaches are working
to help the players gain perspective about
"what skills they want to accomplish and
what contributions they want to make,"
Uhlfelder said. She wants to help "each
player [become] aware of one thing for their
game that would really improve our team."
Stanford has shown talent despite the
fact that the program is still young in com
parison to most of the top-ranked lacrosse
schools; this season was also the first time
that Stanford earned a pre-season national
top-20 ranking. Also, two of the team's play
ers were honored this year by being named
MPSF Players of the Week. Senior Abbi
Hills was selected for the week of March 22-
28, and junior teammate Kelsey Twist was
given the honor the following week. In addi
tion, this past weekend in Denver, seniors
Kim Cahill and Christina Saikus, sopho
more Megan Burker. and freshman Liz
Piselli were named to the MPSF All-Tour
nament Team.
All statistics and technical terms aside,
the team has also matured in other aspects.
"There are a lot of significant things that
happened within our program that are true
successes in terms of our team culture and
some of our leadership on and off the field,"
Uhlfelder noted.
The Cardinal hopes to maintain its chem
istry and talent level when the squad loses
six seniors after this year. Among those
leaving are two of the team's top scorers,
midfielders Cahill and Mills. Stanford will
also be losing goalkeeper Saikus, who tal
lied over 150 saves this season, including a
game-high 12 saves this past weekend
against Cal.
"I will undoubtedly miss playing and
being with all of my teammates, but this sea
son gave us an opportunity to play against
the top teams in the nation and show that we
can compete with all of them," Saikus said.

six seniors after this year. Among those
leaving are two of the team's top scorers,
midfielders Cahill and Mills. Stanford will
also be losing goalkeeper Saikus, who tal
lied over 150 saves this season, including a
game-high 12 saves this past weekend
against Cal.
"I will undoubtedly miss playing and
being with all of my teammates, but this sea
son gave us an opportunity to play against
the top teams in the nation and show that we
can compete with all of them," Saikus said.

Senior Katie Grube (pictured here acjainst Loyola College) and the rest of the women's
lacrosse team ended their season witfi a one-goal loss to California in last weekend's
Moutain Pacific Sports Federation Championship.
It was a season of one-goal heart breakers
for the Stanford women's lacrosse team.
The Cardinal (9-9) lost four games this sea
son by a single goal, including last week
end's Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
championship game against California, 1 1-
10.
Cal's narrow win was the first one out of
four consecutive attempts as Stanford had

prevailed in the past three conference cham
pionships, qualifying the Cardinal for
NCAAs.
"Getting to the NCAAs last year, our
players hoped for that again," said head
coach Michele Uhlfelder. "It was a goal we
didn't reach, something we didn't attain,
and that's definitely disappointing."
In addition to Saturday's defeat at the
hands of the Golden Bears, the team also
lost by one goal in an overtime game against
Ohio State and in back-to-back contests

against Vanderbilt and Dartmouth. Al
though they were tallied in the wrong col
umn, these games prove that Stanford has
the ability to compete with the best, as the
three teams were ranked in the top 20 at the
time of play.
"We had a national schedule this season,
and our team should be given credit for the
amount of times we put ourselves on the
line," Uhlfelder said. "Game after game,
we're always preparing for the next big
team. We know that makes us better, but we
also know that we're going to take our
lumps."
The year's tough schedule took its toll on
the team as it struggled with its intensity
level during some of the games toward the
end of the season.
"We were battling some fatigue,"
Uhlfelder said. "We were battling it well,
but we were battling it for the latter portion
of our season."
Against No. 8 Northwestern on April 9,
the earnestness did not emerge until the last
10 minutes or so of the game, causing the
Cardinal to lose, 11-5.
Similarly, No. 4 Loyola came out strong
at the beginning on April 24 and nabbed an
early lead. Despite its efforts, the Cardinal
did not put up a tough fight until the final 20
minutes against the Greyhounds and lost,
16-8.
"That's something that's plagued us all
year," Uhlfelder said." I think it's just a mat
ter of us needing to work harder and need
ing to have a higher tolerance for hard
work."
Despite the tough schedule, the team
learned some invaluable lessons this year.
Stanford's improvement in shot selection
began to show at the MPSF tournament last
weekend. Bad shot selection doomed the
team in past games as the players often felt
pressured, rushing to take shots instead of
waiting for better opportunities.
"(Last weekend], we had some players
who realized 'that's a bad shot to take' and
didn't take [those shots], and that's a big vic
tory for our team," Uhlfelder said. "People
executed the play and held that she t to wait
and get what we really wanted. However,

we still had players taking bad shots on Sat
urday, but when you lose at the end of the
season in a hard fought match, the law of re
cency says maybe that [lesson | might stick
for next year."
Using this season to guide them, the
team is already looking ahead and prepar
ing for next year. The coaches are working
to help the players gain perspective about
"what skills they want to accomplish and
what contributions they want to make,"
Uhlfelder said. She wants to help "each
player [become] aware of one thing for their
game that would really improve our team."
Stanford has shown talent despite the
fact that the program is still young in com
parison to most of the top-ranked lacrosse
schools; this season was also the first time
that Stanford earned a pre-season national
top-20 ranking. Also, two of the team's play
ers were honored this year by being named
MPSF Players of the Week. Senior Abbi
Hills was selected for the week of March 22-
28, and junior teammate Kelsey Twist was
given the honor the following week. In addi
tion, this past weekend in Denver, seniors
Kim Cahill and Christina Saikus, sopho
more Megan Burker. and freshman Liz
Piselli were named to the MPSF All-Tour
nament Team.
All statistics and technical terms aside,
the team has also matured in other aspects.
"There are a lot of significant things that
happened within our program that are true
successes in terms of our team culture and
some of our leadership on and off the field,"
Uhlfelder noted.
