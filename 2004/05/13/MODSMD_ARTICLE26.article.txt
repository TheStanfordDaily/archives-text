# Stanford favored for track titles at Pac-10s
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
The Pacific-10 Conference track and
field championships will be contested this
weekend in Arizona, and the Cardinal
men and women will once again compete
as favorites for the team titles.
Stanford's men are currently ranked
No. 12 in the nation, just behind No. 8 Ari
zona State, while the women sit in the No.
10 position, behind No. 2 UCLA. But na
tional rankings don't have much bearing
on the outcome of league championships.
Anything can happen in the Pac-10,
often considered one of the top track-and
field conferences in the nation.
This year, the Stanford men will be
looking to avenge a one-point loss to Ore
gon last year, which ended the Cardinal
men's two-year win streak.
But Oregon is already making a title
run difficult for the Cardinal and every
other team in the Pac-10. In the Pac-10
multi-event competition held last week
end, Oregon scored an astounding 25
points, 17 more than second-place Ari
zona State, which may prove insurmount
able to the Ducks' competition as they try
to close the gap during the main events
this weekend.
Stanford, however, returns four Pac-10
champions from last year: sophomore
Justin Romaniuk in the 800 meters, senior
Grant Robison in the 1,500, junior lan
Dobson in the 3,000-meter steeplechase
and senior Louis Luchini in the 5,000 and
10,000.
But their titles will not be easy to de
fend. Arizona's Robert Cheseret is prov
ing that he is a force to be reckoned with,
currently sitting with the No. 1 and No. 2

5,0()0- and 10,000-meter times, respective
ly, in the conference this year.
Dobson, who holds the conference's
top time in the 10,000, is expected to com
pete in the steeplechase but has not com
peted in the event this year. Meanwhile,
Brett Holts of Oregon has run 8 minutes,
44.57 seconds in the event, good enough
for ninth in the nation.
In the 800. Romaniuk comes in as the
underdog behind a trio of UCLA runners
and two Southern California stars, but
hopes to surprise people just as he did last
year when he out-kicked the field to claim
an unexpected title for the Cardinal.
The 1,500 has been dominated by Car
dinal runners since 2000, and it appears as
if it will continue. Junior Don Sage looks
to be Robison's top competition in the
event, but with UCLA's Jon Rankin and
Eric Garner of Washington having solid
seasons, Stanford's hold on the event is
not safe.
The men will also need some strong
performances from the sprinters, jumpers
and throwers to take back the conference
crown.
Juniors Nick Sebes and Curt Goehring
will be leading the long sprints at confer
ence. The 400-meter specialists should be
able to help bring in points in the 400,400-
meter relay and 1,600-meter relay.
Sophomore Solomon Welch will look
to complete his comeback from injury by
placing well at the Pac-lOs, but he will
have to contend with one of the nation's
top triple-junipers in USC's Allen Sims.
In the throws, senior Jay Goff and ju
nior Will O'Neill will look to make an im
pact in the javelin and discus, respectively.
Goff is in position to challenge for second
but will also be in the running for the con

ference title should Arizona's Matt Wagn
er falter in the slightest.
O'Neill currently sits seventh in the
conference but is within striking distance
of third place.
The Stanford women are coming in
poised to end UCLA's eight-year win
streak. With the deepest sprinting squad
ever assembled on the Farm accompanied
by the strength of the distance runners and
the throwers, Stanford probably has the
best chance it has ever had to claim its first
team title.
Both relays are considered contenders
for Pac-10 and national accolades while
some of the sprinters, like freshmen Janice
Davis and Ashley Freeman, sophomores
Nashonme Johnson and Chinny Offor
and junior Christine Moschella, are poised
to score in individual events from 100 to
800 meters.
Senior Lindsey Johnson should be a
contender in both the 100 hurdles and the
400 hurdles.
The sprinters will face tough challenges
from sprinting powers UCLA and USC.
But Stanford will not rest its champi
onship hopes on just one talented group of
women.
In the distance events, Stanford is bar
none the most accomplished school in the
Pac-10. Sophomore Alicia Craig is the col
legiate record holder in the 10,000, while
she and junior Sara Bei are ranked first
and second, respectively, in the confer
ence at 5,000.
Freshman Ari Lambie has been mak
ing some noise this season, posting the
conference's top 1,500 time and setting a
freshman school record at Stanford in that
event.
With UCLA's Lena Nilsson out with

an injury, Lambie is the favorite for the
Pac-10 crown at 1,500 and could score
major points at 800 as well.
Freshman Katy Trotter is the confer
ence's No. 2 runner in the steeplechase.
She will look to overtake Arizona State's
Amy Hastings to score a win for the Car
dinal.
In the shot put, senior Jillian Camarena
will look to avenge last year's conference
loss to UCLA's Jessica Crosby. Camarena
may also join senior Kitty Currier in the
discus, where the duo could score some
big points for the Cardinal.
The hammer trio of sophomore Sarah
Hopping, junior Jessica Pluth and senior
Donielle Colich should challenge Crosby
and Kari Soong of UCLA as well as USC's
duo.
Erin Merriman, who holds the Stan
ford record in the javelin, is also looking to
make an impact for the Cardinal at the
conference championships, as she is cur
rently ranked seventh.
"We don't try to put pressure on our
athletes like setting specific goals for each
race," said women's head coach Edrick
Floreal. "We just try to get them into the
finals, and if we are close in the team race,
if it looks like we are in position, then
hopefully they will get excited.
"The athletes feed off of other's per
formances," Floreal continued, "but we
also don't want someone in the shot put to
be in first and realize that we need more
points for the team, get distracted, and fin
ish second."
Events begin with the women's ham
mer at 2:30 p.m. tomorrw and conclude on
Saturday with the women's and men's
1,600-meter relays.

able to help bring in points in the 400,400-
meter relay and 1,600-meter relay.
Sophomore Solomon Welch will look
to complete his comeback from injury by
placing well at the Pac-lOs, but he will
have to contend with one of the nation's
top triple-junipers in USC's Allen Sims.
In the throws, senior Jay Goff and ju
nior Will O'Neill will look to make an im
pact in the javelin and discus, respectively.
Goff is in position to challenge for second
but will also be in the running for the con

ference title should Arizona's Matt Wagn
er falter in the slightest.
O'Neill currently sits seventh in the
conference but is within striking distance
of third place.
The Stanford women are coming in
poised to end UCLA's eight-year win
streak. With the deepest sprinting squad
ever assembled on the Farm accompanied
by the strength of the distance runners and
the throwers, Stanford probably has the
best chance it has ever had to claim its first
team title.
Both relays are considered contenders
for Pac-10 and national accolades while
some of the sprinters, like freshmen Janice
Davis and Ashley Freeman, sophomores
Nashonme Johnson and Chinny Offor
and junior Christine Moschella, are poised
to score in individual events from 100 to
800 meters.
Senior Lindsey Johnson should be a
contender in both the 100 hurdles and the
400 hurdles.
The sprinters will face tough challenges
from sprinting powers UCLA and USC.
But Stanford will not rest its champi
onship hopes on just one talented group of
women.
In the distance events, Stanford is bar
none the most accomplished school in the
Pac-10. Sophomore Alicia Craig is the col
legiate record holder in the 10,000, while
she and junior Sara Bei are ranked first
and second, respectively, in the confer
ence at 5,000.
Freshman Ari Lambie has been mak
ing some noise this season, posting the
conference's top 1,500 time and setting a
freshman school record at Stanford in that
event.
With UCLA's Lena Nilsson out with

an injury, Lambie is the favorite for the
Pac-10 crown at 1,500 and could score
major points at 800 as well.
Freshman Katy Trotter is the confer
ence's No. 2 runner in the steeplechase.
She will look to overtake Arizona State's
Amy Hastings to score a win for the Car
dinal.
In the shot put, senior Jillian Camarena
will look to avenge last year's conference
loss to UCLA's Jessica Crosby. Camarena
may also join senior Kitty Currier in the
discus, where the duo could score some
big points for the Cardinal.
The hammer trio of sophomore Sarah
Hopping, junior Jessica Pluth and senior
Donielle Colich should challenge Crosby
and Kari Soong of UCLA as well as USC's
duo.
Erin Merriman, who holds the Stan
ford record in the javelin, is also looking to
make an impact for the Cardinal at the
conference championships, as she is cur
rently ranked seventh.
"We don't try to put pressure on our
athletes like setting specific goals for each
race," said women's head coach Edrick
Floreal. "We just try to get them into the
finals, and if we are close in the team race,
if it looks like we are in position, then
hopefully they will get excited.
"The athletes feed off of other's per
formances," Floreal continued, "but we
also don't want someone in the shot put to
be in first and realize that we need more
points for the team, get distracted, and fin
ish second."
Events begin with the women's ham
mer at 2:30 p.m. tomorrw and conclude on
Saturday with the women's and men's
1,600-meter relays.

The women's lacrosse team was one point away from a
NCAA berth, losing to Cal in the MrSF Championship
game last weekend.
The Pacific-10 Conference track and
field championships will be contested this
weekend in Arizona, and the Cardinal
men and women will once again compete
as favorites for the team titles.
Stanford's men are currently ranked
No. 12 in the nation, just behind No. 8 Ari
zona State, while the women sit in the No.
10 position, behind No. 2 UCLA. But na
tional rankings don't have much bearing
on the outcome of league championships.
Anything can happen in the Pac-10,
often considered one of the top track-and
field conferences in the nation.
This year, the Stanford men will be
looking to avenge a one-point loss to Ore
gon last year, which ended the Cardinal
men's two-year win streak.
But Oregon is already making a title
run difficult for the Cardinal and every
other team in the Pac-10. In the Pac-10
multi-event competition held last week
end, Oregon scored an astounding 25
points, 17 more than second-place Ari
zona State, which may prove insurmount
able to the Ducks' competition as they try
to close the gap during the main events
this weekend.
Stanford, however, returns four Pac-10
champions from last year: sophomore
Justin Romaniuk in the 800 meters, senior
Grant Robison in the 1,500, junior lan
Dobson in the 3,000-meter steeplechase
and senior Louis Luchini in the 5,000 and
10,000.
But their titles will not be easy to de
fend. Arizona's Robert Cheseret is prov
ing that he is a force to be reckoned with,
currently sitting with the No. 1 and No. 2

5,0()0- and 10,000-meter times, respective
ly, in the conference this year.
Dobson, who holds the conference's
top time in the 10,000, is expected to com
pete in the steeplechase but has not com
peted in the event this year. Meanwhile,
Brett Holts of Oregon has run 8 minutes,
44.57 seconds in the event, good enough
for ninth in the nation.
In the 800. Romaniuk comes in as the
underdog behind a trio of UCLA runners
and two Southern California stars, but
hopes to surprise people just as he did last
year when he out-kicked the field to claim
an unexpected title for the Cardinal.
The 1,500 has been dominated by Car
dinal runners since 2000, and it appears as
if it will continue. Junior Don Sage looks
to be Robison's top competition in the
event, but with UCLA's Jon Rankin and
Eric Garner of Washington having solid
seasons, Stanford's hold on the event is
not safe.
The men will also need some strong
performances from the sprinters, jumpers
and throwers to take back the conference
crown.
Juniors Nick Sebes and Curt Goehring
will be leading the long sprints at confer
ence. The 400-meter specialists should be
able to help bring in points in the 400,400-
meter relay and 1,600-meter relay.
