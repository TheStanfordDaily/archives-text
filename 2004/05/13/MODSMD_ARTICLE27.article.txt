# Men's tennis starts NCAAs at home
## 
### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford men's tennis
team won't have to travel far for
some decent tennis action this
weekend.
The NCAA Championships and
all their glory will be showered down
upon the Taube Family Tennis Sta
dium this Saturday and Sunday,
since the Cardinal won the bid to
host the first and second rounds.
New Mexico, Pacific and Washing
ton will all travel to the Farm and try
to battle their way to the next stage
of competition.
"We are delighted to be able to
host [the tournament], stay at home
and not have to miss a few days to
travel," head coach Dick Gould said.
"We're used to our trainers here and
everything else."
Stanford, seeded 10th, will take
on unranked Pacific at 12 p.m. on
Saturday.
Pacific will enter this weekend's
matches with a 15-9 overall season
record. The Tigers last met Stanford
in the 2001 tournament, suffering a
4-0 loss to the Cardinal. The Tigers
are looking more optimistic this time
around after clinching their bid to
the NCAAs by winning the Big
West Conference championship.
The first game held on Cardinal
territory will be a match between No.
64 New Mexico and No. 23 Washing
ton. The two teams, unseeded in the
tournament, will hit the courts on
Saturday morning at 9 a.m.
New Mexico is 17-6 on the season
and hasn't made an appearance in
the tournament since 1999, when the
team lost to Pepperdine in the first

round, 4-0. The Lobos gave their
best showing in the 1996 and 1998
championships, when they worked
their way up to the round of 16.
The Lobos will rely heavily on
No. 22 senior Divian Coetzee and
the doubles pair of David Kowalski
and Ryan Stotland to carry the team
to a win over the Huskies. Up until
now, New Mexico has never played
Stanford, Washington or Pacific in
NCAAs.
Washington has had better luck in
past NCAA tournaments, entering
this year's championships for the
10th straight time. The Huskies are
14-8 on the season and are fourth in
the Pacific-10 Conference. The last
time New Mexico and Washington
met, the Huskies swept the dual
match, 7-0.
Washington will look to No. 10
junior All-American Alex Vlaski
and the freshman duo of Daniel Chu
and Alex Slovic to lead the team to a
victory over the Lobos.
In the likely event that No. 9
Stanford defeats its unranked adver
sary, the Cardinal will have to face
either the Huskies or the Lobos on
Sunday at 12 p.m.
The odds are in favor of the Stan
ford men, who have proven in past
matches against both teams that the
rankings do reflect talent.
The Cardinal holds an impressive
27-2 all-time record against the
Huskies, most recently claiming a 6-1
victory when the squads met in March.
"We haven't played a dual match
in four weeks," Gould said. "We
may have a real tough match with
Washington. We beat them at home
earlier and if we don't play really
well on Saturday we won't be able to

go on past this weekend."
No. 8 junior Sam Warburg agreed
that Sunday will be a real test for the
team.
"I think Saturday will be more of
a warm-up for us, [Pacific isn't] real
ly a threat," he said. "Washington is
really good team and it's definitely
[going to be) one of the toughest sec
ond-round matches of the tourna
ment."
New Mexico hasn't fared any bet
ter against the Stanford men. The
two teams have not met since 1997,
when the Cardinal obliterated the
Lobos with a 7-0 shutout. The teams
have only played four times against
each other, with the Cardinal claim
ing a 3-1 advantage.
"Watch out, we could be a fac
tor [in the tournament], but we
have to get through this weekend
to do that," Gould said. "This
match on Saturday could be as
tough as any match in nationals."
Warburg, the 2004 Pac-10 Player
of the Year, will lead Stanford into
the NCAA fray. He was recognized
by the league's coaches for his out
standing 2003-2004 season, capped
by his Pac-10 Singles Championship
title.
"I was really excited, it is a big
honor," Warburg said. "It's been a
fun year so far and hopefully we can
still keep it going."
Also leading the Cardinal are
No. 65 All-American K.C. Corkery,
who collected Second-Team AU-
Pac-10 honors for his sophomore
year, and No. 102 freshman James
Wan. who was voted the 2004 Pac
-10 Co-Newcomer of the Year. Wan
shared the award with Washing
ton's Alex Slovic.

on unranked Pacific at 12 p.m. on
Saturday.
Pacific will enter this weekend's
matches with a 15-9 overall season
record. The Tigers last met Stanford
in the 2001 tournament, suffering a
4-0 loss to the Cardinal. The Tigers
are looking more optimistic this time
around after clinching their bid to
the NCAAs by winning the Big
West Conference championship.
The first game held on Cardinal
territory will be a match between No.
64 New Mexico and No. 23 Washing
ton. The two teams, unseeded in the
tournament, will hit the courts on
Saturday morning at 9 a.m.
New Mexico is 17-6 on the season
and hasn't made an appearance in
the tournament since 1999, when the
team lost to Pepperdine in the first

round, 4-0. The Lobos gave their
best showing in the 1996 and 1998
championships, when they worked
their way up to the round of 16.
The Lobos will rely heavily on
No. 22 senior Divian Coetzee and
the doubles pair of David Kowalski
and Ryan Stotland to carry the team
to a win over the Huskies. Up until
now, New Mexico has never played
Stanford, Washington or Pacific in
NCAAs.
Washington has had better luck in
past NCAA tournaments, entering
this year's championships for the
10th straight time. The Huskies are
14-8 on the season and are fourth in
the Pacific-10 Conference. The last
time New Mexico and Washington
met, the Huskies swept the dual
match, 7-0.
Washington will look to No. 10
junior All-American Alex Vlaski
and the freshman duo of Daniel Chu
and Alex Slovic to lead the team to a
victory over the Lobos.
In the likely event that No. 9
Stanford defeats its unranked adver
sary, the Cardinal will have to face
either the Huskies or the Lobos on
Sunday at 12 p.m.
The odds are in favor of the Stan
ford men, who have proven in past
matches against both teams that the
rankings do reflect talent.
The Cardinal holds an impressive
27-2 all-time record against the
Huskies, most recently claiming a 6-1
victory when the squads met in March.
"We haven't played a dual match
in four weeks," Gould said. "We
may have a real tough match with
Washington. We beat them at home
earlier and if we don't play really
well on Saturday we won't be able to

go on past this weekend."
No. 8 junior Sam Warburg agreed
that Sunday will be a real test for the
team.
"I think Saturday will be more of
a warm-up for us, [Pacific isn't] real
ly a threat," he said. "Washington is
really good team and it's definitely
[going to be) one of the toughest sec
ond-round matches of the tourna
ment."
New Mexico hasn't fared any bet
ter against the Stanford men. The
two teams have not met since 1997,
when the Cardinal obliterated the
Lobos with a 7-0 shutout. The teams
have only played four times against
each other, with the Cardinal claim
ing a 3-1 advantage.
"Watch out, we could be a fac
tor [in the tournament], but we
have to get through this weekend
to do that," Gould said. "This
match on Saturday could be as
tough as any match in nationals."
Warburg, the 2004 Pac-10 Player
of the Year, will lead Stanford into
the NCAA fray. He was recognized
by the league's coaches for his out
standing 2003-2004 season, capped
by his Pac-10 Singles Championship
title.
"I was really excited, it is a big
honor," Warburg said. "It's been a
fun year so far and hopefully we can
still keep it going."
Also leading the Cardinal are
No. 65 All-American K.C. Corkery,
who collected Second-Team AU-
Pac-10 honors for his sophomore
year, and No. 102 freshman James
Wan. who was voted the 2004 Pac
-10 Co-Newcomer of the Year. Wan
shared the award with Washing
ton's Alex Slovic.
The No. 9 Stanford men's tennis
team won't have to travel far for
some decent tennis action this
weekend.
The NCAA Championships and
all their glory will be showered down
upon the Taube Family Tennis Sta
dium this Saturday and Sunday,
since the Cardinal won the bid to
host the first and second rounds.
New Mexico, Pacific and Washing
ton will all travel to the Farm and try
to battle their way to the next stage
of competition.
"We are delighted to be able to
host [the tournament], stay at home
and not have to miss a few days to
travel," head coach Dick Gould said.
"We're used to our trainers here and
everything else."
Stanford, seeded 10th, will take
on unranked Pacific at 12 p.m. on
