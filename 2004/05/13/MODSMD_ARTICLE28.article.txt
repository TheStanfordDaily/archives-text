### FROM STAFF REPORTS KANSAS STATE COLLEGIAN 
(U-WIRE) MANHATTAN,
Kan. — Kansas State University
Student Publications employees and
Collegian staff members were look
ing for answers Tuesday as to why
their director and adviser is being re
moved from his position.
Instead, they got few.
"We don't feel our voice is being
heard by anybody at all," Collegian
news editor Edie Hall said.
Student Publications representa
tives met with Provost James Coff
man and Dean of Arts and Sciences
Stephen White on Tuesday morning
in response to Collegian adviser Ron
Johnson's dismissal. Johnson most
likely will be reappointed to a teach
ing position.
Members of the Board of Direc
tors of Student Publications Inc.
were upset because Todd Simon, di
rector of the A.Q. Miller School of
Journalism and chair of the board,
made a recommendation to reassign
Johnson on behalf of the board.
"Dr. Simon stated he made this deci
sions on behalf of the board, but the
board was not in the know," said Jen
Calvert, Collegian assistant ad man
ager and ex-officio member.
Lindsey Thorpe, ex-officio mem
ber, said if the board isn't informed
on the corporation's activities, then
there is no point in setting up a
board.
"What then is the role, if Dr.
Simon makes a recommendation for

the board without the board know
ing about it," Thorpe said. "There
are members that have an invest
ment in student publications and
know Ron. Why are we here, if not to
help in those decisions?"
Linda Puntney, assistant director
of Student Publications, said she and
the students were searching fora so
lution to Simon's concerns that did
not include firing Johnson.
"Surely there must be a more pos
itive outcome than the one we are
facing today," she said.
White said the decision to dismiss
Johnson and reassign him elsewhere
was final.
"His last day is May 24 as director.
That's final," he said.
Coffman said he was not able to
discuss the specific situation.
"I am not going to say much about
this,"he said. "You don't have pub
lic discussion about personnel. Indi
vidual people have access to the uni
versity handbook individual appeal
and grievance process."
Students, though, said they
should have had a say in the direc
tor's evaluation process.
"If it's going to be called Student
Publications," Jeanel Drake, ex-offi
cio member, said, "then students
should have a say in student publica
tions."
However, Coffman said it would be
difficult to legally involve students in
personnel matters.
"It's more than checking bylaws;
it's a broad look," he said. "For the
board to get involved in personnel is

sues, the makeup of the board would
have to be evaluated."
While students were fighting for
their adviser's job, national journal
ism organizations were taking action
as well.
College Media Advisers will send
an advocacy team to campus Thurs
day. The organization supports ad
visers of newspapers, magazines,
yearbooks and electronic media.
Johnson said he has been on the
phone all day with national media
outlets and Collegian alumni.
Collegian editor in chief Katie
Lane said she had received more
than 60 e-mails from alumni out
raged with Johnson's dismissal.
The story has appeared in news
papers across the country, including
the New York Times, Kansas City
Star, Seattle Post, San Jose Mercury
News and the Wichita Eagle.
Johnson has a meeting with
White this morning, although he said
he did not know what about.
Lawyers from the Student Press
Law Center are reviewing the case to
determine whether the dismissal was
content-driven.
"Broad matter concerning Colle
gian content were the focus of
Simon's letter to Dean White,"
Johnson said.
Lane said the Collegian is waiting
to hear from lawyers before going
further.
"We are waiting for more infor
mation on the situation," she said,
"but it's definitely a step we are will
ine to take if it comes to that.
