# Arizona faces tortilla problem
## 
### THUBA NGUYEN ARIZONA DAILY WILDCAT 
(U-WIRE) TUCSON, Ariz.—
Instead of sending e-mails to gradu
ating students asking them not to
throw tortillas, administrators are
asking officials at each college to ad
vise students not to engage in the
practice at this year's ceremonies.
President Peter Likins said he has
asked the deans of each college to
persuade the graduating seniors not
to throw the tortillas during the cer
emony.
"These are intelligent young men
and women who are graduating
from our university," Likins said.
"They're not deliberately giving of
fense. They're just having fun."
But Likins said the fun should
end when it is at the expense of oth
ers.
The practice of throwing tortillas
during the ceremony offends peo
ple, he said, especially people of cer
tain ethnic groups.
"In some people's memories,
tossing the tortillas is a historic slur.
It's stereotyping the Mexican-
American community in ways that
some people find offensive," Likins
said.
Last year, Likins and Provost
George Davis sent e-mails to gradu
ating students requesting that they

not to throw tortillas because the
practice had gotten out of hand.
Likins said when he started at the
UA in 1997, students threw tortillas
in the air at the end of the cere
monies to celebrate their gradua
tion, but in more recent years, tor
tillas seem to constantly fly every
where.
He said the airborne tortillas un
nerve speakers who are unfamiliar
with the practice, and embarrass the
university because it is a "childish"
and wasteful act that graduating stu
dents should stop.
"For some speakers, it's just not a
problem. ... But for other speakers,
it's unimaginable," Likins said.
"You feel like you're getting toma
toes thrown at you when you're try
ing to deliver a speech. You don't
know quite how to handle that."
Likins said he found the act
amusing back in 1997 but has since
realized that the practice is offensive
to the Mexican and American Indi
an community.
"It was for me a combination of
the tortilla-throwing getting to be
more and more of a continuous ac
tivity, and I began to get negative
feedback from the community," he
said.
Socorro Carrizosa, director of
Chicano/Hispano Student Affairs,
said she does not like the practice

because it is wasteful and reflects J
poorly on the attitudes of the stu-;
dents at the UA.
"I find it more offensive in that/
it's such a waste, that it makes such a!
negative statement about our Amer-;
ican culture, our youth," Carrizosa*
said.
Angel Ramirez, a political sci-I
ence senior, said he finds tortilla-J
throwing more wasteful than offen-J
sive,
"The fact that people are sneak-!
ing it in is a little disrespectful. It is a!
waste of food," he said.
Ramirez, who is graduating, said
he doesn't plan on sneaking any tor- •
tillas into the ceremony.
Graduating communication se-;
nior Lizz Bozorgmehr said she does*
not think the practice is rude or of
fensive unless it's deliberately de-.
meaning.
"I would think it's a form of cele
bration," she said. "If they threw
baguettes, would the French people
get mad?"
Although the immediate end to
the practice is not in the near fu
ture, Likins is encouraged by the
fact that last year, no one from the
College of Education threw any
tortillas
"That's what I think we have to
accomplish here, college by col
lege," he said.
