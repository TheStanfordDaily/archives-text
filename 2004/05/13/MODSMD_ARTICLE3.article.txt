# Lockyer defends state prison abuse record
## 
### MELANIE CORBETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
State Attorney General Bill Lockyer came to Stanford yesterday
to discuss civil rights, gay marriage, environmental law and corporate
crime, but his speech was largely eclipsed by dialogue with a group
protesting alleged prisoner abuse in California.
Lockyer, who has expressed interest in running for California gov
ernor in 2006, discussed the roles and progress made by the Office of
the Attorney General, which he leads. In particular, he highlighted
the progress made in law enforcement using DNA labs.
"Five years ago, the DNA lab in Berkeley was basically a mailing
address," Lockyer said. "Now, we're catching more than one [crimi
nal] a day."
He cited several of his disputes with U.S. Attorney General John
Ashcroft, including those over medicinal marijuana and guns. Lock
yer attributed his support of the former to "personal experience" —
his mother and sister both had leukemia and he witnessed firsthand
their painful experiences with
chemotherapy.
"With respect to medicinal mari
juana, it won't end until the Feds
change the policy," Lockyer said.
"The idea that marijuana is the same
as heroin is absurd."
Lockyer said he also defended
California's gun investigation laws
to the Attorney General. Ashcroft
has called California's investigative
methods illegal, hut Lockyer insists
that Ashcroft is "wrong" and with
out legal basis.
On the issue of gay marriage,
Lockyer in the past has declared
that halting same-sex unions in San
Francisco was not the state's top
law-enforcement priority. Howev
er, Lockyer acknowledged his
doubt that San Francisco Mayor
Gavin Newsom's case would win in
a state lawsuit.
"San Francisco will probably
lose, because the Mayor does not
have the authority [to marry gay
couples]," Lockyer said.
Stanford Democrats President
Kai Stinchcombe, a doctoral student
in political science, said he was ex
cited about Lockyer's presence on
campus to give students an "insider
perspective." However, he noted, "I
was surprised not to see more envi
ronmentalists and gay-rights advo

cates there, for example, to hear him
speak and ask questions."
The vocal protesters became in
volved in the discourse when Lock
yer brought up a highly publicized
violent conflict between guards and
wards in a Stockton youth prison. A
group of approximately 15 people
raised neon signs displaying the
image of a guard beating an inmate
from the California Youth Authori
ty (CYA), the state's largest youth
prison system.
The prison conflict arose when
guards used physical force to settle a
conflict with inmates, allegedly
pushing them to the ground and hit
ting one of them 28 times in the face.
"With guards repeatedly beating
them and kicking them in the face, if
you don't prosecute, doesn't it send
the message that this is OK?" asked
one protester. "Children were help
less at this point."
Lockyer responded to these crit
ical comments as well as personal
stories of prison abuse by attempt
ing to highlight his progress in the
domain, especially the implementa
tion of drug treatment and counsel
ing programs in prisons.
"I've been a prison reformer con
sistently," said Lockyer.
Many demonstrators claimed
that political motives caused Locky
er to avoid specifically addressing
the Stockton allegations.
"You're running for governor,
so do your thing," said one man in
dissatisfaction.
Finally agreeing to discuss his in
volvement in the Stockton case.

Lockyer said that he "saw the video
tape, probably 15 times. I agree that
excessive force was used."
Lockyer's claim that there was
"no dispute" that the wards at
tacked the guards was received by
several protesters shouting, "It's not
on the video."
Lockyer told them, "It is on the
video, from someone who has seen
it slow and enhanced."
He went on to say that based on
photographs and medical reports,
the two wards experienced no phys
ical injuries, and that this compels "a
jury that hears conflicting stories" to
side with the guards.
Discussing the protestors after
the talk, Stinchcombe said he was
glad to see advocates for a more hu
mane prison system.
"The tough-on-crime crowd so
often dominates in the media and so
you rarely get to hear the other side
of the story," he explained. "But I
think it's a tactical mistake for them
to be going after Lockyer, who has
been one of the state's most outspo
ken and effective advocates for a
justice system that works better."
After the protestors exited the
building, Lockyer stayed and dis
cussed what he described his chosen
crime-prevention strategy, a pro
gram called "Safe from Start."
"Safe from Start addresses the
fact that violent families incubate
violent kids," said Lockyer.
"Being exposed to violence
changes brain chemistry so kids
are more predisposed to reacting
to situations with violence."

ty (CYA), the state's largest youth
prison system.
The prison conflict arose when
guards used physical force to settle a
conflict with inmates, allegedly
pushing them to the ground and hit
ting one of them 28 times in the face.
"With guards repeatedly beating
them and kicking them in the face, if
you don't prosecute, doesn't it send
the message that this is OK?" asked
one protester. "Children were help
less at this point."
Lockyer responded to these crit
ical comments as well as personal
stories of prison abuse by attempt
ing to highlight his progress in the
domain, especially the implementa
tion of drug treatment and counsel
ing programs in prisons.
"I've been a prison reformer con
sistently," said Lockyer.
Many demonstrators claimed
that political motives caused Locky
er to avoid specifically addressing
the Stockton allegations.
"You're running for governor,
so do your thing," said one man in
dissatisfaction.
Finally agreeing to discuss his in
volvement in the Stockton case.

Lockyer said that he "saw the video
tape, probably 15 times. I agree that
excessive force was used."
Lockyer's claim that there was
"no dispute" that the wards at
tacked the guards was received by
several protesters shouting, "It's not
on the video."
Lockyer told them, "It is on the
video, from someone who has seen
it slow and enhanced."
He went on to say that based on
photographs and medical reports,
the two wards experienced no phys
ical injuries, and that this compels "a
jury that hears conflicting stories" to
side with the guards.
Discussing the protestors after
the talk, Stinchcombe said he was
glad to see advocates for a more hu
mane prison system.
"The tough-on-crime crowd so
often dominates in the media and so
you rarely get to hear the other side
of the story," he explained. "But I
think it's a tactical mistake for them
to be going after Lockyer, who has
been one of the state's most outspo
ken and effective advocates for a
justice system that works better."
After the protestors exited the
building, Lockyer stayed and dis
cussed what he described his chosen
crime-prevention strategy, a pro
gram called "Safe from Start."
"Safe from Start addresses the
fact that violent families incubate
violent kids," said Lockyer.
"Being exposed to violence
changes brain chemistry so kids
are more predisposed to reacting
to situations with violence."
State Attorney General Bill Lockyer came to Stanford yesterday
to discuss civil rights, gay marriage, environmental law and corporate
crime, but his speech was largely eclipsed by dialogue with a group
protesting alleged prisoner abuse in California.
Lockyer, who has expressed interest in running for California gov
ernor in 2006, discussed the roles and progress made by the Office of
the Attorney General, which he leads. In particular, he highlighted
the progress made in law enforcement using DNA labs.
"Five years ago, the DNA lab in Berkeley was basically a mailing
address," Lockyer said. "Now, we're catching more than one [crimi
nal] a day."
He cited several of his disputes with U.S. Attorney General John
Ashcroft, including those over medicinal marijuana and guns. Lock
yer attributed his support of the former to "personal experience" —
his mother and sister both had leukemia and he witnessed firsthand
their painful experiences with
chemotherapy.
"With respect to medicinal mari
juana, it won't end until the Feds
change the policy," Lockyer said.
"The idea that marijuana is the same
as heroin is absurd."
Lockyer said he also defended
California's gun investigation laws
to the Attorney General. Ashcroft
has called California's investigative
methods illegal, hut Lockyer insists
that Ashcroft is "wrong" and with
out legal basis.
On the issue of gay marriage,
Lockyer in the past has declared
that halting same-sex unions in San
Francisco was not the state's top
law-enforcement priority. Howev
er, Lockyer acknowledged his
doubt that San Francisco Mayor
Gavin Newsom's case would win in
a state lawsuit.
"San Francisco will probably
lose, because the Mayor does not
have the authority [to marry gay
couples]," Lockyer said.
Stanford Democrats President
Kai Stinchcombe, a doctoral student
in political science, said he was ex
cited about Lockyer's presence on
campus to give students an "insider
perspective." However, he noted, "I
was surprised not to see more envi
ronmentalists and gay-rights advo

cates there, for example, to hear him
speak and ask questions."
The vocal protesters became in
volved in the discourse when Lock
yer brought up a highly publicized
violent conflict between guards and
wards in a Stockton youth prison. A
group of approximately 15 people
raised neon signs displaying the
image of a guard beating an inmate
from the California Youth Authori
ty (CYA), the state's largest youth
prison system.
The prison conflict arose when
guards used physical force to settle a
