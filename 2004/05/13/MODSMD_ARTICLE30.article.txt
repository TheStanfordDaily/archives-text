# Congressman calls for Rumsfeld's resignation
## 
### FROM STAFF REPORTS COLORADO DAILY 
(U-WIRE) BOULDER, Colo. —
Congressman Mark Udall, D-Colo., called
Monday for the resignation of Secretary of
Defense Donald Rumsfeld, citing Rums
feld's alleged mismanagement of the scan
dal over the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at the
Abu Ghraib prison.
Udall also called for the appointment
of a more "non-partisan" secretary of de
fense and suggested former Sen. Sam
Nunn. a Georgia Democrat, and current
Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republi
can, as two worthy candidates for the job.
Rumsfeld testified before Congress in
the Abu Ghraib matter last week and the
fallout over the scandal has resonated in
both the U.S. House and Senate ever
since.
"In his testimony last week. Secretary

Rumsfeld rightly said he is responsible
for the achievements and the failures of
his department — and the world now
knows there have been serious failures,"
Udall said in a statement released by his
office Monday afternoon.
"I find it troubling that the Pentagon
didn't respond to these reports sooner,
and even more disturbing that Secretary
Rumsfeld did not share this information
with Congress — or the president for that
matter — until after it was brought to light
by media reports."
Udall said in the statement that while
"no one has suggested that Secretary
Rumsfeld is in any way personally re
sponsible for the abuses at Abu Ghraib,
the Secretary's handling of the matter has
made the job in Iraq harder."
He said that the images of prisoner
abuse at Abu Ghraib "have given Islamic
militants a powerful weapon to use against

America in the eyes of the world."
"Aside from this appalling public rela
tions disaster, there is troubling evidence
of concern about Secretary Rumsfeld's
leadership within the ranks of our mili
tary. I believe there is a question now
about his continued effectiveness. For
these reasons, I have come to the conclu
sion that Secretary Rumsfeld should re
sign and clear the way fora new leader at
the Pentagon."
Udall said Rumsfeld's resignation
would "send a critical message to the
world that human rights abuses — no
matter where or by whom they are perpe
trated — are unacceptable," and said he
didn't share the view of some that "Rums
feld is indispensable."
"In fact, I am increasingly of the view
that replacing Secretary Rumsfeld with
someone of less ideological, and more bi
partisan stature — like former Senator

Sam Nunn of Georgia or Arizona Senator
John McCain — would not only help the
administration by restoring confidence,
new leadership at the Pentagon would
help the effort in Iraq."
President George W. Bush on Mon
day appeared with Rumsfeld at his side
in Washington. The president earlier in
the day viewed more photos reportedly
showing abused prisoners at Abu
Ghraib.
Bush praised Rumsfeld, saying, "You
are courageously leading our nation in
the war against terror. You are doing a
superb job."
Bush repeated a message he first is
sued last week to Iraqis on Arab televi
sion that criminal investigations in the
abuse scandal will be thorough and trans
parent. Bush said Monday that the Unit
ed States remains committed to Iraqi in
dependence and "national dignity."
