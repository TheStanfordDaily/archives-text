### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Only four days before the Stanford School of Law's gradua
tion, Larry Kramer, current associate dean at New York Univer
sity School of Law, was appointed to replace Kathleen Sullivan as
the new dean.
The search for Sullivan's successor began in October when Sul
livan announced her decision to step dow . She will head the new
Stanford Center on Constitutional Law following her return from
a one-year sabbatical. President John Hennessy pieced together a
committee comprised of law faculty members, a history professor
and Provost John Etchemendy.
"The committee met from January till the last couple of
weeks," said Law Prof. Michael Klausner, who worked with
Kramer at NYU and served on the selection committee. "We
interviewed all faculty and gathered ideas for deans from both
in and outside the University. Larry was always a prominent
candidate."
The committee narrowed the search to five candidates and
Hennessy made the final decision.
"Professor Kramer is a dynamic and thoughtful legal scholar
and educator," Hennessy said. "This combination of outstanding
scholarship and commitment to training the next generation of
lawyers makes him a compelling choice for Stanford Law School
because those values are at the core of the school's mission."
Kramer, who specializes in areas of constitutional law and his
tory, and civil procedure, will assume his new position on Sept. 1.
"Stanford is probably unique in having an unbroken run of
four constitutional scholars at the helm of its law school over the
last generation," Etchemendy told the Stanford News Service.
In addition to NYU, Kramer has also taught at the University
of Michigan, as well as the University of Chicago where he worked
with former Stanford president Gerhard Casper. Kramer spent
his undergraduate years at Brown and received his own law de
gree from the University of Chicago School of Law. He has been
a member of the NYU faculty since 1994.
"He is an outstanding scholar and teacher," Klausner said of
Kramer. "He is well connected to the outside profession."
According to Klausner, the Law School is looking to recruit
many new faculty members in upcoming years.
"Kramer is very broad minded in respect to faculty and he's
very good at recruiting," he said. "I think he will strengthen the re
lationships between the law school and alumni and build links be
tween the Law School and the rest of the student body."
Klausner cited the gradual rise in the NYU law school's
national ranking as proof of Kramer's ability to build an ef
fective faculty.
"Thirty new faculty members joined the staff while he was
there, and he played an instrumental role in attracting them,"
Klausner said. "He was important in building the internal culture
of the school, and this is critical in recruiting faculty."
Klausner acknowledged that Stanford doesn't have as
much room to move up when it comes to rankings, but he said
that there is still a lot of ambitious action planned for the next
several years.
"Professor Kramer brings strong academic values and exciting
new ideas from his experience at three great law schools, where he
has worked with a string of great deans," Sullivan said. "In an in
creasingly competitive race to attract and retain the best faculty
and students, his comparative experience will be invaluable."
