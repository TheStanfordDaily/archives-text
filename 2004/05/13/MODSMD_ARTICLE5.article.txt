# Frats rewarded for good conduct

### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
The Greek Housing Review
Board (GHRB) has rewarded two
fraternities for good behavior.
Sigma Chi, having improved its
kitchen management and estab
lished explicit leadership-role guide
lines, has been taken off the housing
probation that began in Feb. 2003.
In addition. Kappa Sigma received a
letter of commendation "for its ex
cellent performance as a model stu
dent-managed housed Greek chap
ter" in the 2002-2003 academic year,
according to a press release.
"Sigma Chi is excited to be re
moved from housing probation,"
said Sigma Chi President Graham
Gilmer, a junior. "We are pleased
that the University has recognized
the significant steps we have made
to improve living conditions within
our house."
Sigma Chi's housing probation
was extended indefinitely after an
annual review in February. The
GHRB recommended that Sigma
Chi improve its kitchen, summer
housing management and residen
tial education program — and doc
ument these changes in writing —
in order to achieve a measure of
sustainability.
In response to the suggestions,
Sigma Chi hired a professional

kitchen hasher, created leadership
manuals outlining the duties of the
individual officers within the house
and improved its communication
with the administration by providing
monthly status reports.
"I think continued communica
tion with the University is key to
help keep us off housing probation,"
Gilmer said.
The chapter appeared before the
GHRB again in April, in a more in
formal setting, in which Gilmer ad
dressed each of the GHRB's con
cerns. In taking the fraternity off
probation, the Board cited "im
proved operation and maintenance
of the chapter house, leadership
structure, its leader transition and
orientation program and the fre
quency and breadth Residential Ed
ucation programming."
Housing probation does not af
fect a fraternity's ability to organize
social activities such as parties. In
stead, housing probation is a warn
ing to fraternities, pressuring them
to improve residential and program
ming issues to avoid losing their
housing, which may occur after re
peated years of probation.
"Housing probation did not af
fect the overall attitude of the chap
ter very much," Gilmer said.
Greek houses are subject to an
nual reviews of various criteria in
cluding their financial status, occu

pancy, membership, community ser
vice projects, residential program
ming, conduct and leadership. A
house can be placed on housing pro
bation if it has a pattern of signifi
cant shortcomings in multiple areas.
The University can also choose
to commend Greek chapter houses
for repeated successes in these areas
— a practice that began with the
2001-2002 year when the Delta
Delta Delta sorority received a let
ter of commendation from the Uni
versity. This year, Kappa Sig was
the only Greek chapter to receive
the recognition.
"We are very proud to have our
efforts as a house recognized by the
University," said junior Mike Al
banese, Kappa Sig president. "We
hope to maintain the high standards
and continue with this recent suc
cess. We also hope that our success
can speak to the responsibility and
leadership of Stanford's Greek com
munity as a whole."
The University commendation
comes along with tangible benefits,
as well.
"I am informed that we will re
ceive a commemorative plaque,"
said Albanese, who also works as
an advertising representative for
The Daily. "We will also enjoy the
good will and gratitude of the Uni
versity, the benefits of which can
not be underestimated."
