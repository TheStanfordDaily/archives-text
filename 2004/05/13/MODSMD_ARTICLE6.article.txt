# Historic Encina Gym being torn down
## 
### DANDAN WU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Few students on campus have
heard of Encina Gym and — with its
ongoing demolition — they probably
won't learn about it any time soon.
The structural framework of this 90-
year-old building on Galvez Mall
started going down early this month,
and it will completely be gone by
June, making way fora new multi
functional Arrillaga Family Recre
ation Center.
The recreation center is expected
to be completed by the summer of
2005.
"Encina Gym was constructed of
unreinforced brick masonry, which is
not stable in a seismic event," said
Project Manager Mark Bonino.
"Therefore, a county ordinance in
2000 required closure of the build
ing."
Besides safety, inefficiency stood
out as the other major reason for de
molition. According to Bonino, the
school carefully investigated Encina's
use as a recreation center for the past
10 years and found that the inefficient
floor layout and lack of high ceiling
space did not allow for the gym to be
used effectively. There was only one
big gym room and too many locker
rooms. In addition, several large posts
hindered the practice of various
sports such as martial arts.
According to Campus Archaeolo
gist Laura Jones, the gym no longer

met students' demand for quality
sports space. Jones served as the cul
tural resources manager for the de
molition project.
The Encina Gym was designed by
the well-known west-coast architec
ture firm Bakewell & Brown in 1915.
The architects designed 19 other
buildings on campus including
Hoover Tower, Green Library, Old
Union, Memorial Hall and Branner

Hall. The original portion of the gym
was constructed in 1915 with basket
ball courts added in 1921 and several
wings added through 1929.
"The Encina Gym was originally
designed as the men's gym, with the
Roble Gym as the women's gym on
the other side of the campus," Jones
explained. "It is a relic of a time on
campus when men's and women's

recreation and residence options
were separated."
Jones also cited the famous anec
dote that men at the time had the op
lion to swim nude in the men's pool
near the Encina Gym, since the en
tire area was restricted to males.
"It was a very different time,"
Jones said.
Because the Encina Gym was
noted for its romantic "beaux arts"
architectural style, the University
has hired a professional photogra

pher to carefully document all of its
aesthetic features. However, there
are three other buildings on campus
— including the Bing Wing of
Green Library — which share the
same architectural style, adding an
other reason for the University to
demolish it, Jones said.
According to Bonino, the demoli
tion proposal went through an exten
sive two-year review process with Santa
Clara County and the community.
The Department of Project
Management has been making a
dedicated effort to salvage as much
of the building as is efficiently and
effectively possible for reuse on
other projects on campus and with
in the community. Bonino said. Sal
vage crews have been on site since

February stripping the interior of
lumber, drywall and other construc
tion and architectural materials.
Right now, the building has been
peeled to its rafters.
"Coordinating salvage with de
molition presents some challenges,
but the project has been running very
smoothly so far," Bonino said.
Jones said she shares Bonino's
excitement, describing some fea
tures of the new gym, including ex
ercise rooms, several gyms and
even a climbing wall. She expressed
some sadness, however, at this his
toric moment.
"I love old things," Jones said.
"But we are a university, not a muse
um which preserves all old buildings.
We have to make a choice."
