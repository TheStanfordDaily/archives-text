Where do we draw the line between an individual's right to free speech and a democratic
society's need to be informed? The Daily has published several controversial advertisements
this year, including the ads placed by the One Truth Foundation in October that ignited
campus-wide debate. This panel invites Stanford faculty and media professionals to discuss
the proper extent of free speech and inflammatory content.

Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting in 1999.
Ted Glasser is a professor of communication and director of the Graduate Program in Journalism at Stanford University, where he is also
affiliated with the Modern Thought and Literature Program. Glasser's research focuses on press practices and performance, with emphasis
on questions of media responsibility and accountability. Professor Glasser recently commented on the Stanford Daily's policies towards
campus paper advertising in a piece titled "The Campus Press and Pernicious Speech: The Case Against Stupid Advertisements".

sexuality and the law; and civil procedure. Professor Wolff clerked for the Honorable Betty Binns Fletcher and the Honorable William A.
