# Obstacles may slow Junipero Serra speeding
## 
### JENNIFER MARTINEZ 
Students speeding along Junipero
Serra Boulevard will run into more ob
stacles if a traffic plan local residents
favor is implemented. The plan calls for
changes to the road between Campus
Drive East and Stanford Avenue that
would force traffic to travel closer to
the posted 35 mph speed limit.
The Santa Clara County Roads
and Airports Department recently
approved plans that neighborhood
residents had been advocating since
1995, but no source of funding has yet
been identified.
The area along Junipero Serra is pri
marily a residential area inhabited most
ly by Stanford faculty and staff. Speed
ing has long been a concern of residents.
"1 live in the neighborhood and
some other neighbors and I have
worked over some period of time with
the University and the county (to ad
dress this problem]," said Jeannie Sieg
man, a retired associate director of
computer networking at Stanford. "It's
taken a long time to get everyone's at
tention at the same time."
Data on speeding from a study last
spring shocked neighborhood resi
dents, and helped spur the plan.
"While there's a certain amount of
speeding on this road, the graph of
numbers of cars at certain speeds nor
mally gets you a bell curve," Siegman
said. "But in this case, it's more like a
two humped camel. The first case [is
the] kind of speeding we've all gotten
used to around these roads. This sec
ond hump [consists] of pretty appalling

speeding, 160
cars a day are
going faster than
65 miles an
hour."
The data also
showed that the
time in which the
speeding occurs
is equally distrib
uted throughout
the day, occur
ring most in the
late morning or
afternoon.
The county
will keep the 35
mph speed limit,
but plans on in
stalling new ob
stacles to slow
down those
going faster than
the speed limit.
The plan in
cludes a combi
nation of chi
canes and medi
ans to slow down
traffic. Chicanes
are sharp bends
that will help to

turn the traffic at an angle, forcing dri
vers to slow their speed. Siegman also
noted that the bicycle lane will be col
ored and more obvious, making the
road safer for bicyclists.
"The design features are fairly mod
est and were developed after two com
munity outreach meetings the county
held with residents and users of that

stretch of roadway," said Andy Coe,
outgoing director of community rela
tions at Stanford.
The new additions to the road will
slow down those driving 35 mph just
four seconds. But for drivers who don't
follow the posted speed, the medians
and chicanes will slow them down by
more than four and half seconds, Sieg

man said. The plan hopes to make it
more beneficial for drivers to follow
the posted speed.
"At this point there is no funding to
support the implementation of the pro
jects. The county will attempt to obtain
special grant money for the project,"

The stretch of Junipero Serra from Campus Drive East to Stanford Avenue may be improved to slow
down traffic. But any changes are years away, as no funding has yet been found.
Coe said. "It could be several years
before monies are found and or the
project is implemented."
Sand Hill Road
improvements underway
Along another edge of campus,
Stanford is funding an improvement
that will speed up traffic instead of
slowing it down.

In construction that started last
month, Sand Hill Road is being
widened to accommodate four lanes
extending all the way to El Camino
Real. This plan was approved by the
City of Palo Alto in 1997, but is just
being implemented this year.
The other phase of the Sand Hill
Road project includes expanding the
road into Menlo Park from the Palo
Alto line to Santa Cruz Avenue, and
improving the Santa Cruz Avenue
and Sand Hill intersection and Ju
nipero Serra and Alpine Road inter
section. This plan was just approved
by the city of Menlo Park last year.
"The improvements to Sand Hill
Road are very popular and have

been long overdue. While impacts of
construction during the project are
often of concern to those living and
traveling in the area, most will agree
that this project will be a real benefit
when it is completed," Coe com
mented. "It will reduce congestion
on Sand Hill Road, improve travel
time and take cut-through traffic off
residential streets."
The project is being paid for en
tirely by Stanford. The widening of
the road to four lanes began in April
and is scheduled to finish this No
vember. The improvements to the
two intersections are planned to
begin in April of next year and end
that November.

Coe said. "It could be several years
before monies are found and or the
project is implemented."
Sand Hill Road
improvements underway
Along another edge of campus,
Stanford is funding an improvement
that will speed up traffic instead of
slowing it down.

In construction that started last
month, Sand Hill Road is being
widened to accommodate four lanes
extending all the way to El Camino
Real. This plan was approved by the
City of Palo Alto in 1997, but is just
being implemented this year.
The other phase of the Sand Hill
Road project includes expanding the
road into Menlo Park from the Palo
Alto line to Santa Cruz Avenue, and
improving the Santa Cruz Avenue
and Sand Hill intersection and Ju
nipero Serra and Alpine Road inter
section. This plan was just approved
by the city of Menlo Park last year.
"The improvements to Sand Hill
Road are very popular and have

been long overdue. While impacts of
construction during the project are
often of concern to those living and
traveling in the area, most will agree
that this project will be a real benefit
when it is completed," Coe com
mented. "It will reduce congestion
on Sand Hill Road, improve travel
time and take cut-through traffic off
residential streets."
The project is being paid for en
tirely by Stanford. The widening of
the road to four lanes began in April
and is scheduled to finish this No
vember. The improvements to the
two intersections are planned to
begin in April of next year and end
that November.
Students speeding along Junipero
Serra Boulevard will run into more ob
stacles if a traffic plan local residents
favor is implemented. The plan calls for
changes to the road between Campus
Drive East and Stanford Avenue that
would force traffic to travel closer to
the posted 35 mph speed limit.
The Santa Clara County Roads
and Airports Department recently
approved plans that neighborhood
residents had been advocating since
1995, but no source of funding has yet
been identified.
The area along Junipero Serra is pri
marily a residential area inhabited most
ly by Stanford faculty and staff. Speed
ing has long been a concern of residents.
"1 live in the neighborhood and
some other neighbors and I have
worked over some period of time with
the University and the county (to ad
dress this problem]," said Jeannie Sieg
man, a retired associate director of
computer networking at Stanford. "It's
taken a long time to get everyone's at
tention at the same time."
Data on speeding from a study last
spring shocked neighborhood resi
dents, and helped spur the plan.
"While there's a certain amount of
speeding on this road, the graph of
numbers of cars at certain speeds nor
mally gets you a bell curve," Siegman
said. "But in this case, it's more like a
two humped camel. The first case [is
the] kind of speeding we've all gotten
used to around these roads. This sec
ond hump [consists] of pretty appalling

speeding, 160
cars a day are
going faster than
65 miles an
hour."
The data also
showed that the
time in which the
speeding occurs
is equally distrib
uted throughout
the day, occur
ring most in the
late morning or
afternoon.
The county
will keep the 35
mph speed limit,
but plans on in
stalling new ob
stacles to slow
down those
going faster than
the speed limit.
The plan in
cludes a combi
nation of chi
canes and medi
ans to slow down
traffic. Chicanes
are sharp bends
that will help to

turn the traffic at an angle, forcing dri
vers to slow their speed. Siegman also
noted that the bicycle lane will be col
ored and more obvious, making the
road safer for bicyclists.
"The design features are fairly mod
est and were developed after two com
munity outreach meetings the county
held with residents and users of that

stretch of roadway," said Andy Coe,
outgoing director of community rela
tions at Stanford.
The new additions to the road will
slow down those driving 35 mph just
four seconds. But for drivers who don't
follow the posted speed, the medians
and chicanes will slow them down by
more than four and half seconds, Sieg

man said. The plan hopes to make it
more beneficial for drivers to follow
the posted speed.
"At this point there is no funding to
support the implementation of the pro
jects. The county will attempt to obtain
special grant money for the project,"

The stretch of Junipero Serra from Campus Drive East to Stanford Avenue may be improved to slow
down traffic. But any changes are years away, as no funding has yet been found.
