In "Martinez argues Fadilla case" (May 10), The Daily incorrectly described Law School Prof. Jennifer Mar
tinez's role in the case Rumsfeld v. Padilla. Martinez was asked to be co-counsel by Jose Pad ilia's court-ap
pointed lawyers. In addition, Padilla is being detained under the Authorization for Use of Military Force,
not the USA PATRIOT Act.
