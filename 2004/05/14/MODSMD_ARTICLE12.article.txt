Take it off
Just in case you didn't get bombarded with flyers and e
mails ol hot naked people, we thought it'd be a good idea
to remind everyone — in Stanford's favorite column —
that Exotic Erotic is this Saturday.
Some people came to Stanford with dreams of a 4.0 GPA,
others with visions of a bound thesis and some with Olympic as
pirations. Courtney came with enthusiasm and ambition to be
the best darned Exotic Erotic-goer all four years. Introduced to
her as a recruit, along with other glorious Stanford traditions
such as Full Moon on the Quad and Big Game, this clothing-op
tional event captivated and intrigued her; just as it has intrigued

many others.
Every year after the big
party, there's a lot of talk about
the problems that surround it,
including sexual harassment,
crowd control and, most dan
gerously, flammable decora
tions. Last year there was such
an uproar at the way the party
was run that both administra
tion and students thought that
maybe Exotic Erotic's time had
run out.

We say, let the tradition live on. And thankfully, it will, at
least for this year. Exotic Erotic is an important contribution to
campus life for many reasons. It's probably the most talked
about party all year. Even if you weren't aware of its existence
pre-Stanford, you quickly learned about this legendary event
and secretly anticipated it all year long. There's a reason why Ex
otic is always the only party on its scheduled night: No one wants
to compete.
On sexual harassment: Sure, a little skin is going to get you a
whistle or two, or maybe a little groping of the ass. But that's
something you could get riding your bike around campus any
way. We don't think Exotic is ail that much sketchier than any
typical frat party. Girls are always dressed up a little skanky
when they head out to have a good time. At least at this party the
guys are dressed as slutty as the girls — no polo shirts and chinos
to hide those white-ass legs. Think of it as everyone being in the
same boat.
One of the best things about Exotic is that it is hosted by 680
Lomita, which is not a fraternity. Sure, the tradition started when
the Phi Delts lived there, but the fact that the tradition has lived
on far past the frat boys' tenure in that house is very impressive.
Not that we have anything against frat parties, but it's great that
just a regular Row house is able to put on such a good party. It
gives girls the opportunity to live in a residence where a frat
party-esque event is thrown. We like being in on the action.
Let's get something clear: The two-item clothing limit is not
enforced. Sure, it's great to get into the spirit of things, but if you
just want to go check things out, zip up your snowsuit or throw on
your Burka and head over to 680 Lomita. Besides, two items of
clothing, while in general satisfying the naked theme, doesn't
necessarily make fora creative costume. No one cares what your
underwear looks like — we want to see what brilliant Stanford
minds can come up with at the most well-received costume party
on campus.
Exotic is about creativity, not simply about showing skin.
Let's delve into our library of past creations: Freshman year,
Caroline stunned crowds as an Olympic gold medalist (clearly a
fantasy) while Courtney regulated the scene as a sheriff, holsters
and all.
Sophomore year, Caroline's Dominatrix costume featured
permanent marker on her back in the form of Gothic art, which
had mysteriously rubbed off by the morning. Courtney tested the
literary knowledge of the Stanford population as Hester Prynne,
complete with a red duct tape scarlet A plastered across her
ample bosom. (Sadly enough, some Stanford students did not
understand the allusion — a few had never even heard of
Nathaniel Hawthorne's "Scarlet Letter.")
Junior year, the red duct tape made a reappearance across
Caroline's not-so-ample bosom as a red anchor to compliment
her sailor cap and skirt. Courtney was welcomed with many alo
has thanks to the Hawaiian leis that had been strategically draped
across her chest. This year ... ? You'll have to wait and see.
The point is, Exotic Erotic is an important Stanford tradition
for many people. Even if you think it might not be your scene,
come check it out anyway. You have to see it to believe it.
