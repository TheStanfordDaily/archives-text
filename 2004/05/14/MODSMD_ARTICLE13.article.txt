# Personalizing Health care
## APAMSA illuminates issues in Asian-American health 
### ARAM HUR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While most of Stanford was fast
asleep on the morning of May 8,
TCSEQ bustled with life at 8:30 a.m.
These early birds were a diverse
crowd, ranging from high schoolers to
leading professionals in the medical
field. From all over the West coast,
these minds convened at Stanford for
the very first 2004 Western Regional
Conference hosted by the Asian Pacif
ic American Medical Student Associ
ation of Stanford (APAMSA).
The APAMSA is a national medi
cal organization, representing over
15,000 Asian Pacific American medi
cal students. Its mission statement is to
improve health care for the Asian
community. Founded in 1995 in re
sponse to the worries of Asian medical
students that their voices were being
ignored, the group strives to build a
strong, collective organization for the
Asian medical community. Among its
numerous programs is its annually
held national conference.
Jolene Nakao and Bory Kea —
both medical graduate students at
Stanford and co-chairs of this year's
Western Regional Conference —
were inspired by the national medical
conference in Washington, D.C., and
decided to organize one especially for
the West coast. In conjunction with
the University of California and San
Francisco's Asian Health Caucus, the
students launched the conference
under the theme of "Stepping Up: Ac
tions to Improve Asian American and
Pacific Islander Health."
"Asian Pacific Islander" is an ex
tremely broad term, which encom
passes over 50 nationalities, 100 di
alects and countless generational, cul
tural and medical histories. Such di
versity within the group asks for cus
tom-tailored care and different ap
proaches to each Asian in terms of
health care. Not only is there a signifi
cant lack of research done on a unique
population basis, but often the ugly
facets of health conditions in the
Asian population are overlooked, hid
den beneath the myth of Asians being
the model minority with the highest
median income. In reality, Asians
have the lowest per capita income and
a huge portion of Asians are not even
medically insured, said B.J. Lee, a
Stanford medical student and the con
ference's campus liaison
"Oftentimes people forget that the
Asian Pacific American community is
very diverse within itself and that dif

ferent sects within it have different
needs," Lee said.
The conference tried to bring
awareness to differences which are
usually glossed over under the com
mon name of Asian.
"Our goal was to provide an expe
rience from which attendees would
gain not only knowledge of issues per
tinent to Asian American and Pacific
Islander (AAPI), health, but also use
ful, concrete ideas on how to imple
ment action based on that knowledge
in whatever project about which they
may feel passionate. This was our
hope," co-chairs Nakao and Kea said,
in a statement.
The conference successfully pro
vided a liaison between professionals
and the broader community, and also
addressed the latent issues that the
Asian community faces. It generated
much positive feedback from the med
ical community, drawing over 100 par
ticipants as well as numerous speak
ers. Among the presenters were
prominent leaders of the medical
field, such as the founders of the Pacif
ic Free Clinic and the President and
CEO of the Asian Pacific Islander
American Health Forum. This facili
tated in networking and building soli
darity among colleagues in the field of

Asian American medicine.
"The conference allowed students
to begin to build relationships with
faculty, community physicians and
professionals with similar concerns
and interests on which future projects
and endeavors can be built," the state
ment said.
Lee also said that the conference
was an opportunity to collaborate on a
workshop with the founders of the Pa
cific Free Clinic, all current medical
students at Stanford.
"It was extremely informative for
the attendees of this session as there
were some students who were looking
for advice in starting their own free
clinics at their schools," Lee said.
Moreover, the conference success
fully brought to the surface pertinent is
sues of Asian health status which, if not
for such a conference, would not have a
platform to be discussed or presented.
Speakers spoke on many issues, rang
ing from "Dispelling the Myth of the
Model Minority: AAPI Health Care"
to "Asian American Careers in Psychi
atry: Why, What and How."
"Many different topics were dis
cussed, including policy / advocacy,
public health outreach, media, free
clinics, mental health, domestic vio
lence, community service and ac

tivism," the statement said.
The co-chairs highlighted the pre
sentation of Dr. Samuel So, Lui Hac
Minh Professor at the Stanford
School of Medicine. Dr. So not only
talked about the problem of Hepati
tis Band liver cancer in the general
Asian population, but also touched
upon his own groundwork for ad
dressing the problem.
"His talk embodied the type of
presentation this conference aspired
to offer," the statement said.
Asked if the conference would
continue to become an annual event,
the co-chairs gave optimistic answers.
"Since this is a regional confer
ence, there is a good chance the con
ference will continue either at Stan
ford or at a different venue in the west
ern region," the statement said.
Continuing such an event depends
on having a dedicated group of people
who are willing to take the initiative.
Perhaps the most important accom
plishment of the 2004 Western Re
gional Conference was paving the way
and successfully laying down the
groundwork for future conferences
and other educational networking op
portunities to come on the subject of
Asian Pacific American health.

in whatever project about which they
may feel passionate. This was our
hope," co-chairs Nakao and Kea said,
in a statement.
The conference successfully pro
vided a liaison between professionals
and the broader community, and also
addressed the latent issues that the
Asian community faces. It generated
much positive feedback from the med
ical community, drawing over 100 par
ticipants as well as numerous speak
ers. Among the presenters were
prominent leaders of the medical
field, such as the founders of the Pacif
ic Free Clinic and the President and
CEO of the Asian Pacific Islander
American Health Forum. This facili
tated in networking and building soli
darity among colleagues in the field of

Asian American medicine.
"The conference allowed students
to begin to build relationships with
faculty, community physicians and
professionals with similar concerns
and interests on which future projects
and endeavors can be built," the state
ment said.
Lee also said that the conference
was an opportunity to collaborate on a
workshop with the founders of the Pa
cific Free Clinic, all current medical
students at Stanford.
"It was extremely informative for
the attendees of this session as there
were some students who were looking
for advice in starting their own free
clinics at their schools," Lee said.
Moreover, the conference success
fully brought to the surface pertinent is
sues of Asian health status which, if not
for such a conference, would not have a
platform to be discussed or presented.
Speakers spoke on many issues, rang
ing from "Dispelling the Myth of the
Model Minority: AAPI Health Care"
to "Asian American Careers in Psychi
atry: Why, What and How."
"Many different topics were dis
cussed, including policy / advocacy,
public health outreach, media, free
clinics, mental health, domestic vio
lence, community service and ac

tivism," the statement said.
The co-chairs highlighted the pre
sentation of Dr. Samuel So, Lui Hac
Minh Professor at the Stanford
School of Medicine. Dr. So not only
talked about the problem of Hepati
tis Band liver cancer in the general
Asian population, but also touched
upon his own groundwork for ad
dressing the problem.
"His talk embodied the type of
presentation this conference aspired
to offer," the statement said.
Asked if the conference would
continue to become an annual event,
the co-chairs gave optimistic answers.
"Since this is a regional confer
ence, there is a good chance the con
ference will continue either at Stan
ford or at a different venue in the west
ern region," the statement said.
Continuing such an event depends
on having a dedicated group of people
who are willing to take the initiative.
Perhaps the most important accom
plishment of the 2004 Western Re
gional Conference was paving the way
and successfully laying down the
groundwork for future conferences
and other educational networking op
portunities to come on the subject of
Asian Pacific American health.

Students and colleagues mingle at the Western Regional Conference entitled "Stepping Up: Actions to Improve
Asian American and Pacific Islander Health," held at Stanford on May 8.
While most of Stanford was fast
asleep on the morning of May 8,
TCSEQ bustled with life at 8:30 a.m.
These early birds were a diverse
crowd, ranging from high schoolers to
leading professionals in the medical
field. From all over the West coast,
these minds convened at Stanford for
the very first 2004 Western Regional
Conference hosted by the Asian Pacif
ic American Medical Student Associ
ation of Stanford (APAMSA).
The APAMSA is a national medi
cal organization, representing over
15,000 Asian Pacific American medi
cal students. Its mission statement is to
improve health care for the Asian
community. Founded in 1995 in re
sponse to the worries of Asian medical
students that their voices were being
ignored, the group strives to build a
strong, collective organization for the
Asian medical community. Among its
numerous programs is its annually
held national conference.
Jolene Nakao and Bory Kea —
both medical graduate students at
Stanford and co-chairs of this year's
Western Regional Conference —
were inspired by the national medical
conference in Washington, D.C., and
decided to organize one especially for
the West coast. In conjunction with
the University of California and San
Francisco's Asian Health Caucus, the
students launched the conference
under the theme of "Stepping Up: Ac
tions to Improve Asian American and
Pacific Islander Health."
"Asian Pacific Islander" is an ex
tremely broad term, which encom
passes over 50 nationalities, 100 di
alects and countless generational, cul
tural and medical histories. Such di
versity within the group asks for cus
tom-tailored care and different ap
proaches to each Asian in terms of
health care. Not only is there a signifi
cant lack of research done on a unique
population basis, but often the ugly
facets of health conditions in the
Asian population are overlooked, hid
den beneath the myth of Asians being
the model minority with the highest
median income. In reality, Asians
have the lowest per capita income and
a huge portion of Asians are not even
medically insured, said B.J. Lee, a
Stanford medical student and the con
ference's campus liaison
"Oftentimes people forget that the
Asian Pacific American community is
very diverse within itself and that dif

ferent sects within it have different
needs," Lee said.
The conference tried to bring
awareness to differences which are
usually glossed over under the com
mon name of Asian.
"Our goal was to provide an expe
rience from which attendees would
gain not only knowledge of issues per
tinent to Asian American and Pacific
Islander (AAPI), health, but also use
ful, concrete ideas on how to imple
ment action based on that knowledge
in whatever project about which they
may feel passionate. This was our
hope," co-chairs Nakao and Kea said,
in a statement.

vided a liaison between professionals
