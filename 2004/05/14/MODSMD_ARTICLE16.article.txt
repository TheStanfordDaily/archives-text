## Advising changes well-advised 
### 
Vice Provost John Bravman and Director
of Undergraduate Advising Steven Zip
perstein have presented a plan to the
Faculty Senate for sweeping changes in
pre-major advising at Stanford. These changes
are long overdue and will help the University
raise its advising standards to equal those of peer
institutions such as Wellesley College and the
University of Pennsylvania.
Bravman was absolutely correct when he told
the Senate that "our advising programs fall well
below the standards we have set and achieved
throughout most of our other undergraduate re
forms." Indeed, advising has developed a notori
ously bad reputation among many freshmen and
undeclared sophomores, who perceive it to be in
adequate to their needs. Bravman's refreshing
honesty shows that the University is serious
about change.
The Senate presentation identified many of
the major problems with the current pre-major
advising system, such as its low level of direct
faculty involvement, decentralized infrastruc
ture and Byzantine advising guidelines. To ad
dress these issues, Bravman and Zipperstein un
veiled a plan for short- and long-term reforms
that is both ambitious and sensible. The renam
ing of the Undergraduate Advising Center to
"Undergraduate Advising Programs", in the
spirit of the successful Freshman and Sophomore
Programs, is emblematic of the multi-pronged
approach of these reforms.
By removing the confining mandate that advi
sors socialize with their advisees as a group. Un
dergraduate Advising Programs will be able to
recruit more faculty members as advisors. While
we hope all advisors will still try to interact with
their advisees, this should help lessen the Uni
versity's dependence on volunteer advisors —
who, while kind and enthusiastic people, often
provide little help to students beyond the occa
sional free meal in Palo Alto. Also, by giving the
Office of Freshmen and Transfer Students a
leading role in pre-major advising, the Universi
ty can translate the Office's close rapport with
students —Dean Julie Lythcott-Haims' popu
larity is a good example of this — into concrete
academic improvements.
Perhaps most exciting is the pilot program to

place a lull-time academic director in Wilbur
Hall, which is home to about twenty-five percent
of freshmen. By bringing centralized, profession
al advising to freshman residences, the Universi
ty can help students take advantage of its vast re
sources and ensure that no one falls through the
cracks. If the program is successful — and we are
optimistic that it will be — it should be extended
to all freshman residences in the future.
Among the other reforms unveiled yesterday,
we are glad to see plans for the creation of an
Undergraduate Advising Programs Advisory
Board consisting of prominent members of the
faculty and administration. We hope that the
Board will continue to seek student input and
perhaps even consider creating permanent seats
for one or two undergraduates. Also, their
planned efforts to use more detailed informa
tion to pair advisors and advisees on the basis of
shared intellectual interests will be a significant
improvement over the current system of throw
ing people together haphazardly.
Right now, pre-major advising is at best a pro
cedural formality and at worst a hassle. Many stu
dents receive all of their academic advice through
friends and dorm mates, a system that causes ed
ucational "inertia," in the words of Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences Sharon Long. At a univer
sity like Stanford, this is simply unacceptable.
The advising program should be an academic and
personal mentorship that provides meaningful
contact between students and advisors. Yester
day's presentation showed that we are on the
right path.
In the long-term, the University should also
continue to review other, more stubborn areas for
improvement in advising. One example is the way
sprawling residential configurations, which lack
continuity from year to year, prevent the forma
tion of sustained intellectual relationships.
Bravman. Zipperstein and Associate Vice
Provost Carol Porter — the three administrators
who put together the reforms — deserve a
tremendous amount of credit for taking a strong,
open approach to correcting Stanford's advising
failures. We have every hope and expectation
that the University will see these changes
through, to the benefit of the entire undergradu
ate community.
