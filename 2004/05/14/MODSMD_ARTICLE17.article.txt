# Don't videotape Exotic Erotic
## 
### 
Police videotaped attendees and entered to
award MIPs at last year's Exotic Erotic, an
offensive move that infuriated students
and caused a campus uproar. We sincerely
hope that Stanford's Department of Public Safety
has taken last year's criticisms to heart and does
not intend a repeat of such voyeurism.
Though intended for use as evidence of under
age drinking, last year's videotaping understand
ably made scantily-clad students feel uncomfort
able. Tight security is appreciated at such a large
party, and we applaud police efforts to ensure
student safety. Last year's private security did
not show up until 10:30 p.m. and proved inade
quate in controlling the event — so they ended
up calling Stanford police for back up. Unfortu
nately, the police thought that videotaping was
an appropriate means of ensuring partiers' re
straint, and that citing students for underage
drinking inside a campus residence was necessary
to maintain order.
This year, there should be no need for this
kind of invasive policing. The residents of 680
Lomita have worked closely with the Office of
Student Activities to ensure that University safe
ty guidelines are followed to the letter. Outside
security has been hired and directed to arrive

early; a professional bartender will check IDs be
fore serving students alcohol; there will be no
VIP room with hard liquor; and everyone who is
in the house before the party will be forced to
leave at 9:45 to wait in line and re-enter.
Under such circumstances, we see little need
for an extensive police presence. Obviously, Stan
ford police should be on patrol around campus.
However, the professional security hired and the
extra precautions taken this year should be ade
quate to ensure student comfort and safety — at
least as much as can be expected at such an infa
mous party.
By all means, if the security this year is as un
professional as last year's, the police should be
called into action. But we still think it is inappro
priate and unnecessary for police officers to film
near-naked coeds. Police Chief Laura Wilson has
cautioned students not to expect privacy at such a
public event and not to wear clothes they are not
willing to be seen in during a local news broadcast.
Yet last year's police actions inside the party creat
ed a scandal that could easily be avoided this year.
Of course, the police have the right to act as they
see fit. However, if only for the sake of bettering
relations with the University community, we would
advise that they avoid filming students tomorrow.
