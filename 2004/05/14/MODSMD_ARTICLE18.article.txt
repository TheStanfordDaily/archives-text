## Berg's murder is not fault of U.S. 
### 
After the disclosure of the
Abu Ghraib torture pho
tos, our president offered
this response: "It's a stain
on our country's honor and our
country's reputation. I am sickened
by what I saw and sickened that peo
ple got the wrong impression."
This was amid investigations al
ready in progress, public hearings
and statements by almost every
American politician on record con
demning the acts.
Yet, after release of video
footage of the grisly beheading of
Nick Berg on Tuesday, the Arab
world is largely mute. Many Arab
papers played down the story —
some not even covering it at all.
Representative Tom Tancredo
(R) of Colorado said, "I am eagerly
awaiting public apologies and con
demnation from leaders in the Arab
world expressing their own personal
outrage at the barbaric murder of
Nick Berg, an innocent civilian."
1 am too, but we shouldn't hold
our breath. Nour al-Huda Zaki, an
Egyptian columnist, writes, "In
normal circumstances, 1 could con
demn the slaughtering of the
American, but we are living in ab
normal circumstances. I cannot
condemn it now."
The Arab world's only condem
nations of the brutal act have come
from Hamas and Hezbollah —
groups given terrorist status by the
U.S. government, whose aims to
distance themselves are clearly po
litical. You can get a whiff of the
agenda in the following comments
hy Osama Hamdan, the Hamas rep
resentative in Lebanon: "I con
demn this brutal act and sympa
thize with the family of the slain
American man, who I consider a
victim of the wrong U.S. policies in
the region," Hamdan told the Asso
ciated Press. "U.S. President
George Bush and [Berg's] killers
are equally responsible."
That's about all the response that
Americans are likely going to get —
qualified condemnations or lack of
sympathy altogether. Hatred for the
United States and opposition to this
war has eclipsed reasoning.
A 45-year-old Iraqi woman said,
"As Muslims we can't accept it, but
we don't blame them. It was a natural
reaction to the human rights viola
tions we have seen at Abu Ghraib."
Natural reaction, huh? In the
video, five masked men forced
Nicholas Berg down on a table as
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi sawed his
head off with a large knife. al-Zar

qawi was sickeningly nonchalant —
taking at least thirty seconds and
three meticulous cleaves to the back
of Berg's neck before the bloodcur
dling screams went dead silent. al-
Zarqawi diligently finished off the
job and held Berg's dripping head up

to the camera
while the men
chanted "God is
Great" in Arabic.
Still, we get
reactions like
that of Sawsan
Al-Masri, 24,
from Gaza City:
"[Nicholas Berg]
deserved it . . .
Do you think

what the Americans did to the de
tainees was less ugly?"
As a matter of fact, I do. Equat
ing the atrocities at Abu Ghraib
with that repulsive butchering re
quires a seriously fucked-up per
spective. I would much prefer to
trade places with the Abu Ghraib
detainees than to suffer a death like
Nick Berg's — which devastated
his family and will surely haunt
them for the rest of their lives.
Imagine your father collapsed in
tears on his front lawn after hearing
the details of that sort of death for
his child.
However, Al-Wafd, an Egyptian
newspaper, asserts that the blood is
on our hands: "The brutal viola
tions practiced by the American
and British occupying forces
against Iraqi prisoners at Abu
Ghraib prison led to retaliating re
sponses against Americans in Iraq.
The pictures of rape and torture ...
forced Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's
group to execute an American citi
zen by the sword."
This is a sad and disgusting argu
ment. What, then, "forced" the
people of Falluja to char and muti
late the bodies of four civilian con
tractors and string them up like
pinatas over the Euphrates, and
then dance around them like it was
some kind of a fiesta? What
"forced" the terrorists of Sept. 11 to
exploit America's value for civil lib
erties and general trust in the good
will of people by sneaking box cut
ters onto planes with the secret ob
jective of mass murder?
The Arab world is suffering from
a serious lack of introspection.
Their leaders and media hold the
United States up to American stan
dards, yet simultaneously apply a
separate and lower set of standards
to themselves. The United States

condemned the torture at Abu
Ghraib, and rightly so. Our country
is confronting its mistakes there and
stating loud and clear that nothing
justifies them.
But there should be a limit to
how much external criticism the
United States has to take on issues
of human rights — especially from a
region of the world where Saddam
Hussein was held up as a symbol of
defiance. At Abu Ghraib, Saddam's
men cut out prisoners' tongues and
drilled holes into their heads.
The reaction to Berg's slaughter
is an example of how the Arab world
miscasts blame for counterproduc
tive insurgencies led by fiends like
Abu al-Mosad al-Zarqawi. What al
lows for it? Hubris? Denial? Preju
dice? Delusion? Whatever it is, au
tonomy for Iraq won't happen be
fore it is confronted.
Nick Berg's death was not our
fault — you will see that if you
watch the video (I did). Watch how
chillingly unaffected Zarqawi is in
carving a head off the body of a liv
ing human being. He did not need to
do that — he wanted to do that. It
forces you to understand the danger
in allowing the Arab world to mis
takenly blame the United States for
the despicable behavior of people
who mutilate and murder and burn
and bomb for the sole purpose of
angering the West.
To the protesters who drama
tized the Abu Ghraib abuse in
White Plaza last week: Return to
White Plaza next week, but, remove
your black hoods. Put on orange
jumpsuits instead. Give adequate
treatment to May 11 's wholly unjus
tifiable murder of Nicholas Berg.
To Americans (especially those
who opposed the war from the
start): We need to acknowledge
the validity of the argument that
Iraqis will be better off if we ac
complish our mission. We can't let
our politics get in the way. Ends
won't justify means and the archi
tects of this war should still lose
their jobs, but we can't view bad
news in Iraq as good news for the
presidential election. Bad news in
Iraq is bad news. Period.
We ought to be critical of our
own government, but it is impera
tive that we stick up for our country
when others cross the line.
