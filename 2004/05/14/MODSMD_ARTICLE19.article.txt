# THE 						WORLD ACCORDING TO DAN
## ASSU senators' decision is justified 
### 
It's time fora reversal. While
this column normally attempts
to break through the Stanford
bubble and examine the
world's politics, this week offers a
unique opportunity. The controver
sy surrounding the ASSU executive
elections has sparked a level of po
litical debate in on campus that I for
one, have rarely seen in my four
years at Stanford.
This second election has
breeched the walls of student apathy
in more ways than one. Not only
were students talking about the
election, they were suddenly partic
ipating in it as well. While the first
election pitted the two typical slates
of ASSU insiders against the satiri
cal Chappie slate, the second round
included five teams of students from
a wider range of classes that ad
dressed a wider range of issues.
With all the attention on the elec
tion, the newly-elected ASSU sena
tors did themselves and the legiti
macy of the ASSU a great service
Monday night as their deliberations
upheld the last decision of the out
going senators. With the initial de
certification and now a potential re
certification of the original elec
tions, the ASSU is in danger of be
coming a Chappie-esque caricature
of itself.
The crime of the original win
ners? Not following the ASSU'sown
election guidelines. The problem of
not certifying because of that? It
turns out the ASSU's election guide
lines don't jive with the ASSU's own
constitution. Is this for real?
The current debate revolves
around whether or not the ASSU
election guidelines unfairly limit

"free speech," which includes e
mails. Not allowing campaigning
during a certain time frame sur
rounding the elections should not
be considered an unfair limit on
free speech. Instead, this method

ensures fair
elections and
protects the
democratic, stu
dent-run spirit
of the ASSU
elections.
The U.S.
Constitution
also protects
free speech, yet
it is illegal for

candidates or their representatives
to campaign within a certain dis
tance of polling areas. Similar to the
ASSU election guidelines, this is not
an undue intrusion on our first and
favorite right.
Unfortunately, the ASSU's Con
stitutional Committee, force-fed
two preceding cases which protect
ed e-mails as part of free-speech,
saw the issue too narrowly and de
cided that the fact that candidates
broke the ASSU's rules by writing
ill- timed e-mails could not be a rea
son not to certify. Luckily, the
newest crop of senators realized the
stakes and found another way of
protecting the previous senators'
decision by citing the corruption of
Lee / Mefford's use of the Senior
Class president's official e-mail list
to advertise themselves.
The estranged couple of Lee and
Mefford, re-united by a spirit of mu
tual opportunism, published an op-ed
in this paper earlier this week to ad
vocate their original victory ("ASSU

should vote to certify April's execu
tive election results," May 9). While
the two candidates stressed their ded
ication to making the ASSU more re
sponsive to students, and their plans
not to make their presidency a mere
notch on their resume, they should
consider putting their actions before
their words.
The ASSU is a student-run orga
nization, and if the students decided
that there should be no electioneer
ing — e-mail or otherwise — from
a certain cutoff point on, then Lee
and his revolving slate should re
spond to that. They knew the rules
when breaking them, and if their
dedication to the ASSU is so un
tempered, they should resign from
the running and leave the post open
to the winner (or runner-up, as the
case may be) of the second election,
or to The Chappie.
In keeping with the reversal of
this column, I end with a compari
son to the outside world. On Sept.
12,2002, President George W. Bush
approached the United Nations
General Assembly with an ultima
tum: Support his war on Iraq or face
irrelevancy. In the end, the U.N.'s
biggest fault was not in failing to
support the war, but instead in fear
ing its own powerlessness in the face
of U.S. unilateralism. In the end, the
ASSU, too, is on the brink of irrele
vancy. The senators who upheld its
election rules should be commend
ed, and the second election results
should be announced and certified.

It's time fora reversal. While
this column normally attempts
to break through the Stanford
bubble and examine the
world's politics, this week offers a
unique opportunity. The controver
sy surrounding the ASSU executive
elections has sparked a level of po
litical debate in on campus that I for
one, have rarely seen in my four
years at Stanford.
This second election has
breeched the walls of student apathy
in more ways than one. Not only
were students talking about the
election, they were suddenly partic
ipating in it as well. While the first
election pitted the two typical slates
of ASSU insiders against the satiri
cal Chappie slate, the second round
included five teams of students from
a wider range of classes that ad
dressed a wider range of issues.
With all the attention on the elec
tion, the newly-elected ASSU sena
tors did themselves and the legiti
macy of the ASSU a great service
Monday night as their deliberations
upheld the last decision of the out
going senators. With the initial de
certification and now a potential re
certification of the original elec
tions, the ASSU is in danger of be
coming a Chappie-esque caricature
of itself.
The crime of the original win
ners? Not following the ASSU'sown
election guidelines. The problem of
not certifying because of that? It
turns out the ASSU's election guide
lines don't jive with the ASSU's own
constitution. Is this for real?
The current debate revolves
around whether or not the ASSU
election guidelines unfairly limit

"free speech," which includes e
mails. Not allowing campaigning
during a certain time frame sur
rounding the elections should not
be considered an unfair limit on
free speech. Instead, this method

ensures fair
elections and
protects the
democratic, stu
dent-run spirit
of the ASSU
elections.
The U.S.
Constitution
also protects
free speech, yet
it is illegal for

candidates or their representatives
to campaign within a certain dis
tance of polling areas. Similar to the
ASSU election guidelines, this is not
an undue intrusion on our first and
favorite right.
Unfortunately, the ASSU's Con
stitutional Committee, force-fed
two preceding cases which protect
ed e-mails as part of free-speech,
saw the issue too narrowly and de
cided that the fact that candidates
broke the ASSU's rules by writing
ill- timed e-mails could not be a rea
son not to certify. Luckily, the
newest crop of senators realized the
stakes and found another way of
protecting the previous senators'
decision by citing the corruption of
Lee / Mefford's use of the Senior
Class president's official e-mail list
to advertise themselves.
The estranged couple of Lee and
Mefford, re-united by a spirit of mu
tual opportunism, published an op-ed
in this paper earlier this week to ad
vocate their original victory ("ASSU

should vote to certify April's execu
tive election results," May 9). While
the two candidates stressed their ded
ication to making the ASSU more re
sponsive to students, and their plans
not to make their presidency a mere
notch on their resume, they should
consider putting their actions before
their words.
The ASSU is a student-run orga
nization, and if the students decided
that there should be no electioneer
ing — e-mail or otherwise — from
a certain cutoff point on, then Lee
and his revolving slate should re
spond to that. They knew the rules
when breaking them, and if their
dedication to the ASSU is so un
tempered, they should resign from
the running and leave the post open
to the winner (or runner-up, as the
case may be) of the second election,
or to The Chappie.
