Students respond to accusation of
Daily's 'Stalinist 7 tendencies
Many concerned people have
written to The Daily asking for well
reasoned, warranted constitutional
reasons from the Undergraduate
Senate to why they have failed to
certify the results. Letters like Ajani
Husbands' (" 'Stalinist' Daily can't
bully ASSU Senate," May 13) only
feed the image that the ASSU
doesn't serve students, but rather in
dividual self-interest and power.
Husbands resorts to name call
ing, going so far to call The Daily
"Stalinist." Was this really neces
sary? I'm sure that many other peo
ple share The Daily's viewpoint on
the issue, and would have liked a
real argument in response, rather
than a five-year-old's methods of
persuasion. Further. Husbands only
asserts that ASSU senators "did
what was right" without explaining

what was right about their policy.
Husbands' letter reads like a session
of chest-thumping and yelling "Re
spect my authority!" to the Consti
tutional Council, the 4,000 plus vot
ers who voted and the many people
who wonder if the ASSU has any le
gitimacy left as a body.
Much political science literature
argues that political systems will
tend to scapegoat or blame others
for their own errors. Husbands' let
ter is like the ASSU's stance on spe
cial fees: Blame the voters, blame
the running candidates, but as long
as you don't blame the government
itself (at all), everything is great. As
long as no one points the fingers at
the rules makers, everything's fine.
Husbands had an opportunity to
explain in a rational, well-explained
way that there was a legitimate, con
stitutional reason to reject certifica
tion. Instead, Husbands chose to
feed the stereotypes about how

meaningless the ASSU has become.

The attempt by Ajani Husbands
to make a coherent argument yes
terday (" 'Stalinist' Daily can't bully
ASSU Senate," May 13) was laugh
able at best. The "Stalinist" Daily?
Where's the body count? And then
Husbands insidiously tries to play
the race card. Of course, there's no
actual support for this claim. Maybe
your allegedly-misquoted "ethnic
minority" senators should speak up
for themselves, rather than give you
the floor. Husbands.

Thank you for printing former
ASSU presidential candidate Ajani
Husband's letter yesterday (" 'Stal
inist' Daily can't bully ASSU Sen
ate," May 13). It reminded me why 1
did not vote for him in the initial
election. Anyone who considers a
newspaper editorial to be a form of
"intimidation" toward the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate should not
be in a position of authority in the
ASSU. I've always thought of edito
rials as forms of free speech. Of
course. Husbands argues against
free speech by arguing against up
holding the initial election. But hey,
at least he admits his own insensibil
ities by calling the Senate the "only
sensible figure in this crudely fash
ioned circus of campus politics."

Alumnus urges consideration
of prorro's views
I read with interest Sarah Ball's
opinion concerning Admit Week
end in the May 9 Washington Post
Her descriptions of the weekend,
and the methods used to impress
prospective students, are troubling.
I suppose that a weekend devot
ed to introducing prospective stu
dents to Stanford has laudable pur
poses. I can't imagine, however, that
being led by zealous rah-rah types
through the campus fountains
serves any of them. Yes, it's great to

"bond," but doesn't that happen
after an admit decides to attend?
Perhaps in Stanford's unceasing
quest to admit the "best and the
brightest" (however ill-defined),
those who administer the process
have lost sight of what I hope Stan
ford still offers — the independence
to find time to engage in contempla
tion and reflection with others.
Stanford would benefit from the
likes of Ball.

Students show lock of class in
reactions to profro's opinions
I am baffled by the reaction stu
dents are having to the ProFro's
Washington Post opinions piece
about Admit Weekend. Yes, Sarah
Ball slammed Stanford in a national
publication. Yes, her opinions were
based on something like 10 hours of
actual time here. Fine, I understand
that this is bothersome — I was an
Admit Weekend coordinator two
years ago, so I love Stanford and
have a vested interest in the school.
What I don't get is how so many
people saw fit to excoriate this girl in
such a way that ends up making
Stanford and its students look even
worse than in the article she wrote.
How many people out there re
ceived forwarded e-mails with let
ters either sent directly to Sarah Ball
or to the editors of the Washington
Post? Did anyone else think they
were just a wee bit overblown?
This is the usual format of the
letters people have sent this girl:
"Dear Ms. Ball, I am first going to
tell you how disappointed I am that
you will not be coming to Stanford.
I will then tell you how this is not
hate mail, and that I am only writing
you this letter to educate you about
the wonderment of Stanford and
how all your opinions are wrong
and unfounded — but it's for your
benefit, not my ego, I swear. I will
then proceed to detail what makes
Stanford so special, and how only
very special people go here. Lastly,
I will tell you that you are a psycho
hose beast, and that 1 hope your
awful personality doesn't get in the
way of future success and happi
ness. Have a fun summer! Sincere
ly, CardinalFan4EVA"
Seriously — who does that? You
might as well just come out and say
you hope she contracts an STD her
first week at Duke. Does anyone ac
tually think this makes Stanford
look better? Does anyone think
Sarah Ball is going to read some
thing like this and think, "You
know, I had Stanford pegged all
wrong. I should have totally gone

there. They're not really nice so
much as petty and mean-spirited. I
would have fit right in."
Too bad she is already going to
Duke, and these letters will have no
practical impact, aside from justify
ing in her mind her decision to high
tail it out of here. All that these let
ters do is cloak the author's sense of
wounded pride in the guise of show
ing Ball the error of her ways.
And don't even get me started on
the photo of her that is circulating
on many e-mail lists. It seems this
photo was chosen to maximize our
sense of her total wrongness — and,
of course, the easiest way of doing
that is saying in countless, creative
ways that she's unattractive. I mean,
thank goodness she's not totally hot,
otherwise we'd have to listen to
what she had to say and be sad she
decided not to come. Now we can
just hate her without remorse.
Again, 1 am definitely bothered
by the fact that this girl saw fit to
splatter the pages of a widely read
newspaper with her unfounded
Stanford-hate, but I am even more
bothered by the student reaction. I
expect much better from Stanford
students than hate mail and saying
she looks like a gremlin. If we can
not expect better from each other,
what are we all defending in the
first place?

Administration needs to take more
active steps to support diversity
Like many students, I was deeply
troubled by Sarah Ball's article re
garding Admit Weekend. Particu
larly outrageous were her attacks
on the diversity that makes Stan
ford a unique institution among the
elite universities.
Ball considers events aimed at
making marginalized communities
feel welcome at Stanford examples
of "sticking to their own." My ques
tion to Ball is, if she really was in
terested in her "potential friends,"
why didn't she go to Chill Night?
Yet she laments that the purpose
was to "coalesce and learn from
each other." Perhaps it didn't occur
to Ball that she could have made
friends at Okada, as well. It seems
to me that what she really wants is
diversity on her own terms, in her
own space.
Attacking multiculturalism and
diversity seems to be the thing to do
these days. Considering the attacks
on MEChA and Stanford American
Indian Organization earlier this
year. The Stanford Review's revival
of the Stanford Indian, the refusal to

put Masque on the special-fees bal
lot by the exiting ASSU Senate,
MEChA's loss of special fees, racist
and nativist demands for TAs with
accents to stop teaching and the
perennial attacks on ethnic theme
dorms and six community centers,
it's about time that students, faculty
and especially the administration
take a strong stand in support of di
versity at Stanford.
According to Dean of Admission
and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet,
Ball's article "warrants discussion."
It certainly does, but if diversity is
truly valued at Stanford, the admin
istration must take aggressive steps
to clearly restate its commitment to
building a multicultural community
and to lay out its plan for accom
plishing that.
Doing so would facilitate in
formed dialogue on issues of race,
gender and sexuality, both during
Admit Weekend and during the
regular school year. To do other
wise would lead to misunderstand
ing of such issues, and, at worst, in
crease attacks on minority commu
nities at Stanford.

Exotic Erotic is always
disappointing
Every year it's the same old hype,
and honestly, I just don't get it. It
used to be one of the greatest col
lege campus parties in the United
States (so said "Rolling Stone"), but
I can't find someone who thinks Ex
otic Erotic even measures up as one
of the best parties on this campus. I
mean, my fraternity threw a party
that drew almost 1.500 people in one
night, and all we had were black
lights and beer (cans, so it wasn't
flat, foamy and warm)... we might
have had a theme too.
Back in the day, when it was on
Rolling Stone's radar screen and a
fraternity ran the party, it was the
party of the year. Of course, said
fraternity has since been donkey
punched out of existence by the
very pro-Greek atmosphere here
at Stanford. But when the fraterni
ty ran it and had its biggest mem
bers outside telling people to strip
down to one (or two) pieces of
clothing, nobody ended up cover
ing up much by the time they were
in the party.
I'll probably end up going. But
until then, I'll just laugh at 680 Lomi
ta residents as they try to deal with
the University's party guidelines.
