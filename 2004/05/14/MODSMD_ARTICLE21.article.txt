## Julie's guide to lying your way into EV 
### 
It's that time of year again on the Farm, when
most students get screwed over by the housing
Draw in some kind of statistical impossibility.
Some students simply resign themselves to
upperclassman hell in a Flo-Mo double, others opt
for living off-campus in Dead Houses and a select
few athletes relocate to Escondido Village.
Escondido Village is, hands-down, the best
housing at Stanford. It's an undergraduate
paradise: sprawling grassy lawns, one and two
bedroom apartments, private bathrooms and
kitchens . . . too bad it's only for couples and
graduate students.
Over the past four years at Stanford, I have
had 12 couples of undergraduate friends in EV.
One friend was legitimately married, one was a
gay dancer living with his "friend who is a girl"
and eight pairs were athlete "couples." Can we
do the math? Escondido Village has a colorful
and scandalous past of undergraduate athlete
occupancy that some administrators would
rather put behind them.

The most celebrated case
happened some number of
years ago when a football play
er was interviewed on TV with
his female fiance at his side, at
which point someone realized
his gay partner was probably
neither his partner nor gay.
This goes down in the Stanford
"Did that really happen?" an
nals along with other things that

the University doesn't like to
share with its students, like the math doctorate stu
dent who finally lost it some eight years ago and
took a hammer to a professor's head. I can't verify
the details or even call the football story reliable,
because Stanford doesn't talk about student sui
cides, rapes and scandals, but the part about the
murdered math professor is definitely legit.
Things have come a long way since the days of
Stanford football players feigning gay partnership
with each other, although I am still unsure how that
ever got past the EV housing administration in the
first place. Now there are more clever ways to lie.
Take the heterosexual couple. They seem like
more plausible couple than a pair of gay lineback
ers, right? The heterosexual couple is usually an
athlete and his or her friend of the opposite sex,
who is often also an athlete. They get along, they
get premium housing, they decide who gets the
inner bedroom in the apartment, it works out.
Riskier variations on the heterosexual couple
include guy-girl couples where one of them is
openly gay in the Stanford community.
My personal favorite was a friend who claimed
he was living with his non-Stanford girlfriend and
moved his football-player friend in instead. I must
say, this has been one of the most successful strate
gies for getting into EV.
On one hand, it's completely unethical to take
housing spots from poor grad students. Graduate
housing at Stanford is even more dismal than the
undergraduate scene, and each apartment rented
by fakers is one more grad couple put out on the
overpriced streets of Palo Alto.
On the other hand, it's hard to blame them.
And even harder to detect them these days. Il
legitimate undergrads are keeping a lower profile,
and I'm willing to wager that the only legal athlete
residents in EV are the Mormon couples.
Apparently the days of rampant abuse in
EV are over, after the TV scandal turned into a
mass football exodus from Eden. Or so the
hearsay goes. But I personally blame the con
tinued athlete presence in EV on the renova
tion of Mirrielees in the beginning of the 2001
school year. I lasted eight weeks in the repaint
ed. extra-occupancy hell before I sunk into a
deep depression and reassigned myself.
Mirrielees. for all you lowerclassmen. was once
the hallowed "Athlete's Ghetto." "Athlete's" be
cause some of the higher-profile baseball, football
and soccer players lived there, and "ghetto" be
cause the building was in less-than-perfect form,
complete with dark plastic curtains instead of clos
et doors. The Athlete's Ghetto used to be the place
to Draw, with private bathrooms, no meal plan and
even a patio for the first floor residents, until it
turned into an architectural nightmare, with an
extra person stuffed into each apartment and extra
beds and desks crammed in places they didn't fit.
Mirrielees dropped to the bottom of everyone's
housing list, right down there with Eucalipto, and
the exodus to EV intensified.
So here we find ourselves, with tightened but
hardly intimidating EV entrance procedures, bet
ter faking strategies and an increasingly mediocre
selection of housing options. And for the under
grads left in EV — "lesbian" partners, "engaged"
athletes and the Mormon couples — remember
how lucky you are.

wants Mirrieless to be returned to its former glory,
like former Vice Provost Jim Montoya said it
would be in a 2(K)1 interview.
