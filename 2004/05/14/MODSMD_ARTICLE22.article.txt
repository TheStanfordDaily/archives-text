# Baseball travels to face Arizona
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
With only a slim, half-game lead
over Washington in the Pacific-10
Conference race, the heat is on for
the No. 2 Stanford baseball team
(38-8, 11-4 Pac-10) as it travels to
the desert for its final conference
road series of the season against
Arizona (25-20-1,7-8).
"It's going to be great," said
sophomore shortstop Chris Mi
naker. "They're going to be ready
to play at their place, it'll be packed
and hopefully we can separate our
selves from the rest of the Pac-10."
To do so, Stanford can ill afford
a repeat of last weekend, which saw
the Cardinal drop two of three to
the Huskies on the road.
This weekend's series, which will
begin tomorrow and conclude on
Monday to accommodate Ari
zona's final exam period, will pro
vide a good test fora Cardinal line
up that has seen its production
slump of late.
Every offense, even one averag
ing close to nine runs per game and
leading the conference in nearly
every statistical category like Stan
ford's, is bound to struggle from
time to time, but the next three
games should shed some light on
whether the recent dip at the plate is
an anomaly or a worrisome trend.
After scoring just 11 runs in
three games in Seattle, the offense
sputtered again on Tuesday night in
a 3-1 win over Santa Clara. The Car
dinal did all of its damage in the first
inning with three runs on three hits
but was held to just two singles over
the next seven innings.
The Cardinal was without the
services of Jonny Ash, who was bat
ting .374 before suffering a hairline
fracture in his left hand that caused
him to miss the past 12 games, and
John Mayberry Jr., who was side
lined with a shoulder injury. Ash
was scheduled to see a doctor yes

terday and the timetable for his re
turn remains uncertain. Mayberry is
day-to-day, according to head
coach Mark Marquess.
In their absence, extra weight
falls on the shoulders of players like
junior outfielder Danny Putnam,
who has taken over the team lead in
batting average with a .393 mark,
sophomore second baseman Jed
Lowrie (.390) and senior right field
er Brian Hall (.380).
The good news for Stanford's
hitters is that they will not have to
face Washington's Tim Lince
cum, who was named a national
player of the week and played a
large role in quieting the Cardinal
bats last weekend.
Instead, they'll have to contend
with Arizona's top starter, Koley
Kolberg (7-4,3.93 ERA). Kolberg,
who spent the past two seasons at
Navarro (Texas) junior college,
where he was named to the junior
college all-star team, leads the Pac
-10 in innings pitched (103) and is
third in strikeouts (91).
Stanford will counter with its
own ace, sophomore lefthander
Mark Romanczuk (9-1,3.63). Ro
manczuk gave up six hits and two
runs over nine innings last Friday,
picking up a no-decision in a game
the Cardinal went on to lose in extra
innings, 3-2.
Righthander Kevin Guyette
(6-5, 6.24) will be on the mound
for the Wildcats on Sunday. He
will be opposed by Stanford
sophomore righthander Jeff
Gilmore (8-2, 4.30). Despite feel
ing under the weather, Gilmore
was masterful last Saturday, giv
ing up two runs and recording a
career-high eight strikeouts over
seven strong innings to pick up
the win in Stanford's 7-2 victory.
Arizona sophomore John
Meloan, who pitched a complete
game two-hitter in a 2-1 victory over
UCLA last weekend, will get the
nod on Monday night.

Marquess has yet to name a
starter for the potential rub
ber game.
"We'll have achance tosee their
hitters and who's a better match,"
Marquess said. "We've got
Reynolds who can go, Holler who
can g0... We'll wait and see and
then go from there."
The Wildcats, who lead the Pac
-10 with 57 stolen bases this season,
have scored 31 runs in their past two
games and have turned on the
power of late.
Junior John Hardy is Arizona's
leading hitter with a .364 average.
Recently moved to the leadoff spot
after batting ninth for most of the
season, Hardy is batting .437 during
his last 20 games (31-for-71) with
three home runs, 19 RBIs and 21
runs scored.
Sophomore Jordan Brown is
batting .342 with eight home runs
and 47 RBIs and was named the
Pac-10 Player of the Week for his
efforts against UCLA last week
end. Brown belted three home runs,
scored five runs and drove in 10
more as the Wildcats took two of
three from the Bruins in a noncon
ference series.
"They've really swung the bat
well," Marquess said. "They
haven't necessarily been a power
team, but they hit a lot of home runs
against UCLA. I think they're
probably playing their best baseball
offensively right now."
No. 15 Washington will be in
Los Angeles this weekend fora
three-game series against South
ern California. With Stanford con
trolling its own destiny, however,
scoreboard-watching will not pre
occupy the team.
"We know that as long as we
take care of business, we're
going to be where we need to
be," Minaker said.
Tomorrow and Sunday's games
begin at 6 p.m. The first pitch on
Monday is scheduled for 1 p.m.
