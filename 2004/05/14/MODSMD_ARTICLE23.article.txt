# Softball ends Pac-10 play in Oregon
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend marks the end of Pacific
-10 Conference play for the No. 7 Cardinal
softball team (41-15,11-7 Pac-10) before it

hosts one of 16 NCAA regionals May 21-23
at Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadium.
With its lofty ranking and strong confer
ence record, the Cardinal will likely be
seeded first in its region — and the winner
of each region goes on to the College

World Series.
Stanford head coach John Rittman re
fuses to look ahead, however, and with
good reason — the Cardinal has three dif
ficult games on the road against the Ore
gon teams to close out Pac-10 play. Friday's
game against No. 12 Oregon (37-37,9-9) in
Eugene presents a particular challenge for
the Cardinal, but Saturday's douhleheader
in Corvallis also features a marquee oppo
nent in No. 18 Oregon State (40-23.4-14).

Heather Shook said that this is a crucial
weekend for the Cardinal.
"This is a pretty big weekend for us,"
she said. "Both our opponents are top-20
teams, and we have a shot at clinching sec
ond place in the Pac-10 for the first time in
the history of the program. Everyone's ex
cited, but we're not looking any further
than Friday's game versus Oregon."
Friday's matchup against the Ducks is
the rubber game in the season series be
tween Stanford and Oregon. The schools
split two games at Smith on the weekend
of April 2-3, with the Cardinal losing, 1 -0,
on Saturday and then defeating the
Ducks, 6-1, on Sunday. The all-time series
between the two teams stands at 15-14,
with the Ducks holding a one-game edge
over the Cardinal.
"Oregon is a really good team," Shook
said. "They beat [top-ranked) Arizona ear
lier in the year and after splitting with them
in April, we want to win the season series."
Saturday's doubleheader against the
Beavers features a scrappy opponent that
has faltered somewhat against the brutal
Pac-10 schedule, but has still managed to
eke out victories against No. 8 Washington
and No. 4 Cal this year. Obviously, this is a
Beaver squad that knows how to pull an
upset, but the Cardinal will be ready.
"Oregon State is a good-hitting team
that has beat some quality opponents. We
know we can't overlook them," Shook said.

The Cardinal will be going on the road
after a difficult homestand last weekend
that saw Stanford drop two games to No. 3
UCLA at Smith.
"As for last weekend, well, that's in the
past," Shook said. "We had some lessons
we learned the hard way, hut now we're
itching for the opportunity to prove our
selves again."
But Shook maintained that the team is
still upbeat both about this weekend's road
trip and the team's prospects overall.
"We're pretty excited to go on the
road," she said. "It helps us to stay fo
cused. We like to think of it as a business
trip — we have a job to do. Plus, our goal
all season has been to make it to the
World Series, and that's on the road, so
this is good preparation.
If the Cardinal is to prove itself against
the Oregon schools, it will have to pitch
better than it did last weekend. Starting
pitchers Dana Sorensen and Laura Sever
son were hit hard by an excellent UCLA
lineup in Saturday and Sunday's losses, giv
ing up five Bruin home runs.
However, the power exhibition put on
by UCLA was partly attributable to um
piring, as very few corner pitches were
called strikes in either game, forcing
Sorensen and Severson to pitch right over
the plate against one of the best offensive
teams in the country. Still, the Cardinal
will have to figure out some way to limit
opposition scoring to come out of its Ore
gon trip victorious.
Overall, the outlook for Stanford going
into next week's regional will hinge largely
upon this weekend's games.
"This weekend is a good opportunity to
gain momentum going into the postsea
son." Shook said. "Most importantly, we
have to stay together and play together as a
team. We're excited to have the opportuni
ty to get back on the field and prove that we
can play again."

Senior ace Dana Sorensen will lead the No. 7 Cardinal into its final Pacific-10 Confer
ence series of the season. The weekend's outcome will likely affect the team's momentum
heading into NCAA Regionals later this month.
