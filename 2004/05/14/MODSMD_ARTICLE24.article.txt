# Morris makes impact for second straight year
## 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With two standout seniors having
tremendous farewell seasons, it can be easy
to overlook the contributions made by first
and second-year players. In the case of the
Stanford softball team, however, it is clear
that younger players have had a huge impact

on the team's success this year.
Sophomore center fielder Catalina Mor
ris exemplifies this fact better than anyone.
The Sonoita, Ariz., native, who broke
into the Pacific-10 Conference last year with
a stellar rookie season, has played a huge
role in leading the Cardinal to its Pac-10 suc
cess and top-10 national ranking.
Except for her 311 batting average, which is a

mere 13 points lower than last season's average,
Morris has managed to match or top last year's
totals in nearly every major statistical category.
Last season, Morris scored 38 runs and
recorded a .520 slugging percentage, both
team-highs. She also drove in 28 runs while
belting out 10 doubles and six home runs.
This season, Morris has found a way to
improve on those already-stellar numbers.

scoring a team-leading 43 runs while racking
up 34 RBIs. The centerfielder has also con
nected for 10 doubles and 6 home runs, lead
ing to a .555 slugging percentage.
With six triples, Morris has taken over the
record books as well, breaking the former
Stanford record of five triples in a season. A
two-season total of eight triples also puts her
third all-time in Stanford history.

Morris was recognized for her success
lasl season, earning Second-Team All-Pac
-10 honors along with fellow sophomore
Lauren Lappin. The sophomore outfielder
was also named First Team All-Pacific re
gion and earned NFCA Third-Team All-
American honors.
While many players spend their summers
playing in club leagues or for nation
al teams, Morris opted not to play
any offseason softball. Instead, she
chose to spend her time at home, re
covering from a long and exhausting
first season.
"I worked out a lot at home and
lifted and ran," Morris said of her
summer. "I think your freshman year
is really overwhelming and it's nice to

step back a bit and recover."
Along with the restful offseason,
Morris believes that having one year of
collegiate softball under her belt has im
proved her game, both offensively and
defensively. The center fielder feels
more comfortable in her surroundings,
which has translated into a more ag
gressive approach to the game.
"I think I'm better with big games
[now], especially in the Pac-10," Mor
ris said. "I'm better at controlling my
emotions and getting myself mental
ly prepared for big games."
With help from Morris and the
rest of the squad, the Cardinal can set
a new Stanford record for the most

Pac-10 victories in a season with a win
this weekend in Oregon. The team
has tied the 2001 mark with 11 con
ference victories.
Even if the Cardinal fails to reach
the new mark, Morris believes that
this team has already come a long
way. She cites Stanford's sweep of
UCLA and Washington in one April
weekend as being her most memo
rable event of the season.
Morris helped the Cardinal in a
big way that weekend, going 2-for-3
while scoring four runs and knock
ing in two RBls en route to a 12-9
win over Washington. She finished
2-for-5 with two walks in the other

two games.
"We had a really great week
end when we went out 1 to UCLA
and Washington," Morris said.
"We really played well as a team.
It was probably the best we've
played all season."
Morris believes that the Cardi
nal's success this season can be at
tributed to a strong sense of team
unity. She hopes that the team's pos
itive dynamics will translate into a
long post-season.
"We work well together," Morris
said. "1 think we have the potential to
go to the College World Series, and
hopefully we can do well there."

this team has already come a long
way. She cites Stanford's sweep of
UCLA and Washington in one April
weekend as being her most memo
rable event of the season.
Morris helped the Cardinal in a
big way that weekend, going 2-for-3
while scoring four runs and knock
ing in two RBls en route to a 12-9
win over Washington. She finished
2-for-5 with two walks in the other

two games.
"We had a really great week
end when we went out 1 to UCLA
and Washington," Morris said.
"We really played well as a team.
It was probably the best we've
played all season."
Morris believes that the Cardi
nal's success this season can be at
tributed to a strong sense of team
unity. She hopes that the team's pos
itive dynamics will translate into a
long post-season.
"We work well together," Morris
said. "1 think we have the potential to
go to the College World Series, and
hopefully we can do well there."
