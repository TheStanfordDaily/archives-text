With two standout seniors having
tremendous farewell seasons, it can be easy
to overlook the contributions made by first
and second-year players. In the case of the
Stanford softball team, however, it is clear
that younger players have had a huge impact

on the team's success this year.
Sophomore center fielder Catalina Mor

The Sonoita, Ariz., native, who broke

Morris has managed to match or top last year's
totals in nearly every major statistical category.
Last season, Morris scored 38 runs and
recorded a .520 slugging percentage, both

belting out 10 doubles and six home runs.
This season, Morris has found a way to
improve on those already-stellar numbers.

scoring a team-leading 43 runs while racking
up 34 RBIs. The centerfielder has also con

Stanford record of five triples in a season. A
two-season total of eight triples also puts her
third all-time in Stanford history.

Morris was recognized for her success

-10 honors along with fellow sophomore
Lauren Lappin. The sophomore outfielder
was also named First Team All-Pacific re
gion and earned NFCA Third-Team All-
American honors.
