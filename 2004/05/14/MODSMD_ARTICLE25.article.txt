# O'Hagan takes no prisoners in closing role
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Look out onto the pitcher's mound at
Sunken Diamond during the late innings of a
close game. If you see a Stanford hurler that
seems completely poised as he baffles oppos
ing batters, it's probably senior reliever David
O'Hagan. The righthander closer has estab
lished himself as one of the fiercest competi
tors on the Cardinal squad.
Then again, peer into the Stanford dugout
on any given day and if you see a single play
er smiling, laughing or playfully wrestling
with one of the Cardinal bat boys, the odds
are that it's O'Hagan.
Moral of the story: If you ever meet
O'Hagan, you better hope that it's off the field
rather than on.
"There's a lot of respect for the guy,"
sophomore Jeff Gilmore said. "He's a fun
loving guy, everyone likes him, but when it
comes time to do his job, there's no one more
competitive, no one more intense than him.
That's something that everyone strives for
and not many are going to replicate."
O'Hagan's intensity is visible when he
steps out of the bullpen, and it is just as evi
dent in his season statistics. He ranks third on
the team in wins — he is 5-0 out of the
bullpen — in addition to leading the team
and the Pacific-10 Conference in ERA (1.59)
and opponents' batting average (.159) in 49
innings of work. O'Hagan also paces the
team in saves with five and is third in strike
outs with 51.
"David's always been very competitive
and very emotional, which I like in a closer,"
said Stanford head coach Mark Marquess.
"We could have made him a starter, and he
would have been a good starter. But our feel
ing was that he was a lot more valuable to the
team out of the bullpen, even though he's one
of our top two pitchers."
And, according to O'Hagan, he's thrilled
to be the Cardinal closer.
After all, the righty pitched only 121/3 in
nings in his sophomore season and didn't
throw a single pitch in his rookie campaign.
"A lot of people here probably never

thought I'd play in one game," O'Hagan said.
"But [pitching coach Tom Kunis] always took
the time to work with me, so I owe a lot to him
... He always believed in me."
When O'Hagan showed up at Stanford,
he joined a pitching staff that included the
star arms of hurlers like Jeremy Guthrie and
John Hudgins — a far cry from the 2004 Car
dinal's young staff. While this season's fresh
men are already getting opportunities to
make contributions to the team — the fresh
man trio of Blake Holler, Matt Leva and
Greg Reynolds has combined for 16 starts
and an 11-3 record — O'Hagan only had a
few chances for relief innings.
By the end of his sophomore year, he had
nine appearances and a shabby 5.11 ERA.
Hardly the line of an up-and-comer.
But last season, O'Hagan broke loose and
became a force out of the bullpen, compiling
a 7-1 record with three saves and notching a
win in his only decision in the Cardinal's Col
lege World Series charge. He was a solid re
liever in postseason play — when Stanford
needed it the most — appearing four times
and throwing eight and 1 / 3 scoreless innings.
O'Hagan's metamorphosis from bench
warmer to star closer is something that Mar
quess has yet to see from another player in his
time on the Farm.
"He's just really matured," Marquess
said. "It's a harder for someone to do that in
a relief role ... [As a reliever], if you make
one mistake it gets magnified, whereas if
you're a starter you can give up five or six hits
and still pitch well. I don't know that I've ever
had a player that had not pitched and then
gone on to have the year that [O'Hagan] has
had this year."
The way that O'Hagan has evolved in his
four years on the Farm has made him a role
model for his teammates, though the senior
doesn't see it that way.
"I have a reputation for joking around a lot
and 1 think [my teammates] have trouble tak
ing me seriously," O'Hagan said sheepishly.
"So 1 hope I can lead by example on the field
because my off-the-field is not quite as good."
Gilmore completely disagreed with
O'Hagan, though, citing the hard work that

his teammate put into becoming a
better pitcher, even when his time
on the mound was sporadic.
"He's been a big inspiration for
me because he came in as a zero re
cruit and wasn't given any chances.
But he worked harder than every
one else in the weight room and
stayed involved with his pitching,"
Gilmore said. "And now he's one
of the top relievers in the country."
Marquess said that he believes
O'Hagan is especially an inspira
tion for this year's freshmen pitch
ers, who are encountering the nor
mal up-and-downs of adjusting to
college play.
"[The freshman] think, 'Well,
[O'Hagan] didn't pitch at all and
look at him now." And that speaks
volumes," Marquess said. "Here's
a guy who really didn't come into
his own or have a lot of success
until the end of last season. And to
go from that to being our best
pitcher... that says a lot to the
freshmen."
According to Marquess, the
biggest change in O'Hagan from
2001 to this season has been the se
nior's ability to gain control of
every one of his pitches.
O'Hagan arrived with a good
fastball in the high 80s and a strong
curve, but has since improved his
velocity to the low 90s and this sea
son added a slider that has become
his most effective pitch.

"I kinda picked [the slider] up over Christ
mas," O'Hagan said. "I don't know if Santa
Claus was just being really good to me or
what."
After discovering his slider in an indoor
game of catch with his brother — no play
ing outdoors in winter for the Wayzata,
Minn, native — O'Hagan tried the pitch
out in intrasquad games, and when it
worked, he immediately made it part of his
everyday arsenal.
The other addition that O'Hagan has

made to his pitching performance has zero ef
fect on his ability to fan batters, though it has
become a bit of a trademark. The senior emits
a grunt on his follow-through that can be
heard all over the diamond.
"I'm a huge Monica Seles fan," O'Hagan
said straight-faced before telling the real
story. "It's just one of those subconscious
things. [Former Stanford pitcher] Ryan Mc-
Cally used to do it, and then someone pointed
out that 1 did too."
Now that O'Hagan is nearing the end of

his Stanford career, he is looking ahead to a
possible professional career, an option that he
never thought would present itself when he
was a freshman hoping for just an opportuni
ty to play.
But first things first — getting back to the
College World Series is the most important
item on the agenda of this year's seniors.
"We've been here for so long that we have
a heightened attachment to the game,"
O'Hagan said. "Our time's running out, and
we want every action to count."

the Pacific-10 Conference in addition to leading the StanforcTpitching staff in opponent's batting av
erage and saves.
Look out onto the pitcher's mound at
Sunken Diamond during the late innings of a
close game. If you see a Stanford hurler that
seems completely poised as he baffles oppos
ing batters, it's probably senior reliever David
O'Hagan. The righthander closer has estab
lished himself as one of the fiercest competi
tors on the Cardinal squad.
Then again, peer into the Stanford dugout
on any given day and if you see a single play
er smiling, laughing or playfully wrestling
with one of the Cardinal bat boys, the odds
are that it's O'Hagan.
Moral of the story: If you ever meet
O'Hagan, you better hope that it's off the field
rather than on.
"There's a lot of respect for the guy,"
sophomore Jeff Gilmore said. "He's a fun
loving guy, everyone likes him, but when it
comes time to do his job, there's no one more
competitive, no one more intense than him.
That's something that everyone strives for
and not many are going to replicate."
O'Hagan's intensity is visible when he
steps out of the bullpen, and it is just as evi
dent in his season statistics. He ranks third on
the team in wins — he is 5-0 out of the
bullpen — in addition to leading the team
and the Pacific-10 Conference in ERA (1.59)
and opponents' batting average (.159) in 49
innings of work. O'Hagan also paces the
team in saves with five and is third in strike
outs with 51.
"David's always been very competitive
and very emotional, which I like in a closer,"
said Stanford head coach Mark Marquess.
"We could have made him a starter, and he
would have been a good starter. But our feel
ing was that he was a lot more valuable to the
team out of the bullpen, even though he's one
of our top two pitchers."
And, according to O'Hagan, he's thrilled
to be the Cardinal closer.
After all, the righty pitched only 121/3 in
nings in his sophomore season and didn't
throw a single pitch in his rookie campaign.
"A lot of people here probably never

thought I'd play in one game," O'Hagan said.
"But [pitching coach Tom Kunis] always took
the time to work with me, so I owe a lot to him
... He always believed in me."
When O'Hagan showed up at Stanford,
he joined a pitching staff that included the
star arms of hurlers like Jeremy Guthrie and
John Hudgins — a far cry from the 2004 Car
dinal's young staff. While this season's fresh
men are already getting opportunities to
make contributions to the team — the fresh
man trio of Blake Holler, Matt Leva and
Greg Reynolds has combined for 16 starts
and an 11-3 record — O'Hagan only had a
few chances for relief innings.
By the end of his sophomore year, he had
nine appearances and a shabby 5.11 ERA.
Hardly the line of an up-and-comer.
But last season, O'Hagan broke loose and
became a force out of the bullpen, compiling
a 7-1 record with three saves and notching a
win in his only decision in the Cardinal's Col
lege World Series charge. He was a solid re
liever in postseason play — when Stanford
needed it the most — appearing four times
and throwing eight and 1 / 3 scoreless innings.
O'Hagan's metamorphosis from bench
warmer to star closer is something that Mar
quess has yet to see from another player in his
time on the Farm.
"He's just really matured," Marquess
said. "It's a harder for someone to do that in
a relief role ... [As a reliever], if you make
one mistake it gets magnified, whereas if
you're a starter you can give up five or six hits
and still pitch well. I don't know that I've ever
had a player that had not pitched and then
gone on to have the year that [O'Hagan] has
had this year."
The way that O'Hagan has evolved in his
four years on the Farm has made him a role
model for his teammates, though the senior
doesn't see it that way.
"I have a reputation for joking around a lot
and 1 think [my teammates] have trouble tak
ing me seriously," O'Hagan said sheepishly.
"So 1 hope I can lead by example on the field
because my off-the-field is not quite as good."
Gilmore completely disagreed with
O'Hagan, though, citing the hard work that

his teammate put into becoming a
better pitcher, even when his time
on the mound was sporadic.
"He's been a big inspiration for
me because he came in as a zero re
cruit and wasn't given any chances.
But he worked harder than every
one else in the weight room and
stayed involved with his pitching,"
Gilmore said. "And now he's one
of the top relievers in the country."
Marquess said that he believes
O'Hagan is especially an inspira
tion for this year's freshmen pitch
ers, who are encountering the nor
mal up-and-downs of adjusting to
college play.
"[The freshman] think, 'Well,
[O'Hagan] didn't pitch at all and
look at him now." And that speaks
volumes," Marquess said. "Here's
a guy who really didn't come into
his own or have a lot of success
until the end of last season. And to
go from that to being our best
pitcher... that says a lot to the
freshmen."
According to Marquess, the
biggest change in O'Hagan from
2001 to this season has been the se
nior's ability to gain control of
every one of his pitches.
O'Hagan arrived with a good
fastball in the high 80s and a strong
curve, but has since improved his
velocity to the low 90s and this sea
son added a slider that has become
his most effective pitch.

"I kinda picked [the slider] up over Christ
mas," O'Hagan said. "I don't know if Santa
Claus was just being really good to me or
what."
After discovering his slider in an indoor
game of catch with his brother — no play
ing outdoors in winter for the Wayzata,
Minn, native — O'Hagan tried the pitch
out in intrasquad games, and when it
worked, he immediately made it part of his
everyday arsenal.
The other addition that O'Hagan has

made to his pitching performance has zero ef
fect on his ability to fan batters, though it has
become a bit of a trademark. The senior emits
a grunt on his follow-through that can be
heard all over the diamond.
"I'm a huge Monica Seles fan," O'Hagan
said straight-faced before telling the real
story. "It's just one of those subconscious
things. [Former Stanford pitcher] Ryan Mc-
Cally used to do it, and then someone pointed
out that 1 did too."
Now that O'Hagan is nearing the end of

his Stanford career, he is looking ahead to a
possible professional career, an option that he
never thought would present itself when he
was a freshman hoping for just an opportuni
ty to play.
But first things first — getting back to the
College World Series is the most important
item on the agenda of this year's seniors.
"We've been here for so long that we have
a heightened attachment to the game,"
O'Hagan said. "Our time's running out, and
we want every action to count."
