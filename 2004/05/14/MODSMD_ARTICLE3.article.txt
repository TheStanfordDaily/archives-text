# Bravman explains freshman advising
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate discussed major reforms to under
graduate advising — with a focus on freshman advising —
in its meeting yesterday afternoon. First-year Director of
Undergraduate Advising Steven Zipperstein and Vice
Provost John Bravman said that the changes to the advising
system will be both procedural and organizational, as the
program reexamines its mission and role.
One of the changes deals with how freshman academic
advisers will interact with students.
"You've got to get that socializing component out,"
Bravman said. "The idea that I am going to go out and have
lunch and entertain this group of people where less than
half are going to show up and the rest are going to shuffle
their feet is something that I don't want to do."
According to Bravman, the academic adviser's role
should be to emphasize academic and intellectual partner
ships and to redirect procedural and policy-driven discus
sions elsewhere.
Prof. Andrea Goldsmith, agreed with Bravman when it
came to redirecting mundane freshman questions.
"Freshman ask which I-Hum class they should take, and
sure I can comment on that, but that is not something that
is as important," Goldsmith said.
Removing the social aspect of
the student-academic adviser rela
tionship is one solution to a situa
tion that Bravman said is problem
atic. He noted that students and
faculty have false expectations
about what the relationship is going
to be, and that there is also a lack of
interest from both the faculty and
the students.
"Everyone is busier than ever,
and advising simply does not hold
sufficient, sustained value for many
— but not all — of those involved;
that includes advisers and students,"
Bravman said, noting that from his
experience over 20 percent of stu
dents would miss appointments to
see him.
At the same time, Bravman said

that advisers arc facing student is
sues of increased complexity. He
cited as an example the fact that 10
to 15 percent of students at Stanford
are taking medication to deal with
psychological problems.
According to Zipperstein, the
freshman-adviser relationship is
also one that is hard to monitor for
improvements.
"It is a relationship that can't he
tracked, that is impervious to super
vision, that is one of the most impor
tant relationships that a students
forms," he said.
Bravman and Zipperstein also
said they were working to increase
faculty involvement in freshman ad
vising. Currently, only about 15 per
cent of advisers are faculty.
Although faculty complain that
they are not compensated for time
commitments as freshman advisers,
the University will create honors
and awards to supplant cash pay
ment. Provost John Etchemendy
noted that there are other rewards.
"It can be a real kick to be a fresh
man adviser," Etchemendv said.

Aside from procedural change,
Bravman added that the University
is making organizational reforms to
deal with decentralized, overlapping
responsibilities.
"At our peer institutions there
are people that have total access to
the application files to the universi
ty, to anything that had to deal with
disciplinary matters, to the tran
script, to all sorts of information that
at Stanford is held at different of
fices and frankly by policy is very
difficult to get," Bravman said. "As
vice provost of education I have no
right to look at students admission
files. We have this fragmented infor
mation that sits in four, five, six of
fices around campus."
To deal with some of this frag
mentation, the Dean of Freshman
and Transfer Students has now been
relocated from under the Vice
Provost of Student Affairs to the Of
fice of the Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education.
In the future, there will also be
more work to match up advisers and
students based on mutual interest.

In a trial program, next year the
University is hiring an academic di
rector in Wilbur Hall where roughly
25 percent of the freshman class is
located. The new director's job will
be to help coordinate advising. Be
cause the director is located where
many freshman live, Bravman said
that students will not be "ping
ponged" to various locations across
campus. In the future, academic di
rectors could be put in place in other
locations on campus.
Bravman added that over 950
upperclassmen are involved in
freshman advising in some capaci
ty, partly because roles are dupli
cated and student responsibilities
overlap. To further centralize the
advising system, Bravman said that
he wants to restore the resident as
sistant's role as a primarily acade
mic adviser.
As another part of the reforms,
the Undergraduate Advising Center
will be renamed the Undergraduate
Advising Program to reflect the fact
that there are multiple advising pro
grams and no real headquarters.

difficult to get," Bravman said. "As
vice provost of education I have no
right to look at students admission
files. We have this fragmented infor
mation that sits in four, five, six of
fices around campus."
To deal with some of this frag
mentation, the Dean of Freshman
and Transfer Students has now been
relocated from under the Vice
Provost of Student Affairs to the Of
fice of the Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education.
In the future, there will also be
more work to match up advisers and
students based on mutual interest.

In a trial program, next year the
University is hiring an academic di
rector in Wilbur Hall where roughly
25 percent of the freshman class is
located. The new director's job will
be to help coordinate advising. Be
cause the director is located where
many freshman live, Bravman said
that students will not be "ping
ponged" to various locations across
campus. In the future, academic di
rectors could be put in place in other
locations on campus.
Bravman added that over 950
upperclassmen are involved in
freshman advising in some capaci
ty, partly because roles are dupli
cated and student responsibilities
overlap. To further centralize the
advising system, Bravman said that
he wants to restore the resident as
sistant's role as a primarily acade
mic adviser.
As another part of the reforms,
the Undergraduate Advising Center
will be renamed the Undergraduate
Advising Program to reflect the fact
that there are multiple advising pro
grams and no real headquarters.
The Faculty Senate discussed major reforms to under
graduate advising — with a focus on freshman advising —
in its meeting yesterday afternoon. First-year Director of
Undergraduate Advising Steven Zipperstein and Vice
Provost John Bravman said that the changes to the advising
system will be both procedural and organizational, as the
program reexamines its mission and role.
One of the changes deals with how freshman academic
advisers will interact with students.
"You've got to get that socializing component out,"
Bravman said. "The idea that I am going to go out and have
lunch and entertain this group of people where less than
half are going to show up and the rest are going to shuffle
their feet is something that I don't want to do."
According to Bravman, the academic adviser's role
should be to emphasize academic and intellectual partner
ships and to redirect procedural and policy-driven discus
sions elsewhere.
Prof. Andrea Goldsmith, agreed with Bravman when it
came to redirecting mundane freshman questions.
"Freshman ask which I-Hum class they should take, and
sure I can comment on that, but that is not something that
is as important," Goldsmith said.
Removing the social aspect of
the student-academic adviser rela
tionship is one solution to a situa
tion that Bravman said is problem
atic. He noted that students and
faculty have false expectations
about what the relationship is going
to be, and that there is also a lack of
interest from both the faculty and
the students.
"Everyone is busier than ever,
and advising simply does not hold
sufficient, sustained value for many
— but not all — of those involved;
that includes advisers and students,"
Bravman said, noting that from his
experience over 20 percent of stu
dents would miss appointments to
see him.
At the same time, Bravman said

that advisers arc facing student is
sues of increased complexity. He
cited as an example the fact that 10
to 15 percent of students at Stanford
are taking medication to deal with
psychological problems.
According to Zipperstein, the
freshman-adviser relationship is
also one that is hard to monitor for
improvements.
"It is a relationship that can't he
tracked, that is impervious to super
vision, that is one of the most impor
tant relationships that a students
forms," he said.
Bravman and Zipperstein also
said they were working to increase
faculty involvement in freshman ad
vising. Currently, only about 15 per
cent of advisers are faculty.
Although faculty complain that
they are not compensated for time
commitments as freshman advisers,
the University will create honors
and awards to supplant cash pay
ment. Provost John Etchemendy
noted that there are other rewards.
"It can be a real kick to be a fresh
man adviser," Etchemendv said.

Aside from procedural change,
Bravman added that the University
is making organizational reforms to
deal with decentralized, overlapping
responsibilities.
"At our peer institutions there
are people that have total access to
the application files to the universi
ty, to anything that had to deal with
disciplinary matters, to the tran
script, to all sorts of information that
at Stanford is held at different of
fices and frankly by policy is very
difficult to get," Bravman said. "As
vice provost of education I have no
right to look at students admission
files. We have this fragmented infor
mation that sits in four, five, six of
fices around campus."
