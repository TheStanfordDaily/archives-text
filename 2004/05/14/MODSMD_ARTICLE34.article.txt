# Wilco's back from the dead on 'Ghostâ€™

You can't yet buy "A Ghost is
Born," Wilco's fifth album and follow
up to 2002's brilliant "Yankee Hotel
Foxtrot." The album won't be available
this week, next week or even the week
after. It has played host to more delays,
leaks and rumors than "Star Wars:
Episode 1." In fact, after Wilco front
man Jeff Tweedy checked himself into
rehab for addiction to painkillers, the
release date for "Ghost" was pushed
back from June 8 to June 22, and some
speculate that it might not even make
that date.
Why then, you ask, does this record
deserve a pre-emptive review? For any
other beautiful, thought-provoking
record, we still wait for its release to
write it up. But this is Wilco we're talk
ing about here, the group who under
went a near odyssey to release "Yan
kee." And lately, release dates tend not
to matter much in Wilco's routinely
groundbreaking output.
Of course, the new record has not
yet faced the obstacles which " Yankee"
dealt with over the course of its eight
month delay. Originally slotted for an
unfortunate September 11, 2001 re
lease, it was rejected by Wilco's label for
its experimental departures, and the
band streamed the album online from
their Web site as they struggled to find a

new label. "Yankee" subsequently built
a huge online following and when it was
finally released by Nonesuch it received
critical raves and climbed to No. 13 on
the Billboard charts.
"A Ghost is Born" continues the
post-rock / alt-country experimenta
tion of its predecessor. Avant-garde
producer Jim O'Rourke once again
mans the boards on "Ghost," and it is
his creative elixir that motivates the
band's sound. Like "Yankee," this
album features the dissonance and
sonic experimentation that are
O'Rourke's trademarks.
What hasn't changed is Jeff
Tweedy's twittering voice and honest
pop-song writing. On "Ghost," they are
recast as minimalist Kraut-rock and
psychedelia. The ten minute "Spiders
(Kidsmoke)" revolves around a Neu
esque driving beat and Tweedy himself
sounds like a psychedelic rocker, but
around the four minute mark a hoe
down guitar progression crashes in. The
genres mix tightly, creating a kind of fu
turistic twang-rock.
Sweeter songs also abound. "Muz
zle of Bees," a lilting sit-down ditty,
showcases Tweedy's earnest voice and
a new, reserved sound. "I'm a Wheel,"
written as a classic country rock song,
morphs into a 10-fi power-pop gem, re
vealing delicate shades of punk.
Throughout, "Ghost" shows that
Wilco is truly bound for bigger things

than the alt-country crown. The new
album may not feature as many big win
ners as "Yankee," but the songs feel
more intimate, and it ultimately stands
as a worthy successor. Wilco's depar
ture from its country roots recalls the
psychedelic experimentation of the
Beatles or the damaged, ambient ex
ploration of Bowie's "Berlin Trilogy"
and point to a possible future with the
creative significance of both.
Though the album has not been re
leased yet, it is available online. Wilco is
streaming the entire album on their
Web site, http://www.wilcoworld.net,
and most of the songs have been avail
able on file-sharing networks since
early April. Those who object to ille
gal file-sharing can assuage their con
science by looking at Wilco's position
on the subject at fan Ronen Givony's
site, Justafan.org. The site offers ille
gal downloaders a chance to give back
by donating to Wilco's charity of
choice, Doctors Without Borders.
Whether you listen to "A Ghost is
Born" via Kazaa or the Wilco-sanc
tioned streaming on Wilcoworld.net,
you simply must check it out and join in
its well-deserved pre-release hype.
Wildly experimental yet conceptually
sure, it solidifies Wilco's position as one
of today's most important post-rock
outfits while still retaining the introspec
tive Americana from which they can't
escape. That Wilco just can't seem to
release an album on time to save their
lives is a minor point, and it doesn't
matter that much when you consider
that it's probably more fitting to
download this album online rather
than spinning it on CD.

Whether you listen to "A Ghost is
Born" via Kazaa or the Wilco-sanc
tioned streaming on Wilcoworld.net,
you simply must check it out and join in
its well-deserved pre-release hype.
Wildly experimental yet conceptually
sure, it solidifies Wilco's position as one
of today's most important post-rock
outfits while still retaining the introspec
tive Americana from which they can't
escape. That Wilco just can't seem to
release an album on time to save their
lives is a minor point, and it doesn't
matter that much when you consider
that it's probably more fitting to
download this album online rather
than spinning it on CD.

You can't yet buy "A Ghost is
Born," Wilco's fifth album and follow
up to 2002's brilliant "Yankee Hotel
Foxtrot." The album won't be available
this week, next week or even the week
after. It has played host to more delays,
leaks and rumors than "Star Wars:
Episode 1." In fact, after Wilco front
man Jeff Tweedy checked himself into
rehab for addiction to painkillers, the
release date for "Ghost" was pushed
back from June 8 to June 22, and some
speculate that it might not even make
that date.
Why then, you ask, does this record
deserve a pre-emptive review? For any
other beautiful, thought-provoking
record, we still wait for its release to
write it up. But this is Wilco we're talk
ing about here, the group who under
went a near odyssey to release "Yan
kee." And lately, release dates tend not
to matter much in Wilco's routinely
groundbreaking output.
Of course, the new record has not
yet faced the obstacles which " Yankee"
dealt with over the course of its eight
month delay. Originally slotted for an
unfortunate September 11, 2001 re
lease, it was rejected by Wilco's label for
its experimental departures, and the
band streamed the album online from
their Web site as they struggled to find a

new label. "Yankee" subsequently built
a huge online following and when it was
finally released by Nonesuch it received
critical raves and climbed to No. 13 on
the Billboard charts.
"A Ghost is Born" continues the
post-rock / alt-country experimenta
tion of its predecessor. Avant-garde
producer Jim O'Rourke once again
mans the boards on "Ghost," and it is
his creative elixir that motivates the
band's sound. Like "Yankee," this
album features the dissonance and
sonic experimentation that are
O'Rourke's trademarks.
What hasn't changed is Jeff
Tweedy's twittering voice and honest
pop-song writing. On "Ghost," they are
recast as minimalist Kraut-rock and
psychedelia. The ten minute "Spiders
(Kidsmoke)" revolves around a Neu
esque driving beat and Tweedy himself
sounds like a psychedelic rocker, but
around the four minute mark a hoe
down guitar progression crashes in. The
genres mix tightly, creating a kind of fu
turistic twang-rock.
Sweeter songs also abound. "Muz
zle of Bees," a lilting sit-down ditty,
showcases Tweedy's earnest voice and
a new, reserved sound. "I'm a Wheel,"
written as a classic country rock song,
morphs into a 10-fi power-pop gem, re
vealing delicate shades of punk.
Throughout, "Ghost" shows that
Wilco is truly bound for bigger things

than the alt-country crown. The new
album may not feature as many big win
ners as "Yankee," but the songs feel
more intimate, and it ultimately stands
as a worthy successor. Wilco's depar
ture from its country roots recalls the
psychedelic experimentation of the
Beatles or the damaged, ambient ex
ploration of Bowie's "Berlin Trilogy"
and point to a possible future with the
creative significance of both.
Though the album has not been re
leased yet, it is available online. Wilco is
streaming the entire album on their
Web site, http://www.wilcoworld.net,
and most of the songs have been avail
able on file-sharing networks since
early April. Those who object to ille
gal file-sharing can assuage their con
science by looking at Wilco's position
on the subject at fan Ronen Givony's
site, Justafan.org. The site offers ille
gal downloaders a chance to give back
