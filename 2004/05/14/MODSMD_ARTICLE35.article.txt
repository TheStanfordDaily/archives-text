### CHRIS LEE INTERMISSIONARY TO THE STARS 
Jim Jarmusch occupies a rare cachet among
today's film directors: lauded for the fiercely unex
citing realism of his movies, he has managed to gar
ner indie cred and the loyalty of several big-name
actors, all while maintaininga minimalist's sense of
production and aesthetics. His films come across as
refreshingly unassuming artifacts we admire for

their cool per
ception but are
hesitant to whol
ly embrace.
"Coffee
andCigarettes,"
which opens
today in select
cities, is not re-

ally a Jarmusch movie but an assorted collection
of Jarmusch moments which stay with us — to
varying degrees of success. It is comprised of 11
shorts, some of which were shot more than a
decade ago and premiered at film festivals on
their own. The central thread among all the
scenes, easily surmised, is that they feature char
acters having coffee and cigarettes — often in a
diner and usually in substitution fora meal, a fact
that several of them end up getting scolded for.
What is most disappointing about the film
is that witnessed together the scenes have
very little to unify them. Occasionally certain
snippets of dialogue will resurface to helpful
ly re-orient the viewer — in the first and old
est piece, 1986's "Strange to Meet You," co

median Steven Wright remarks to a typically
convulsive Roberto Benigni that he likes to
drink coffee before he goes to sleep because it
makes him dream faster. This sentiment is
echoed in "Delirium," a more recent short
that features (of all juxtapositions) the rap
pers RZA and GZA and a remarkably game
Bill Murray.
But Jarmusch's calling card has always been
filming those lingering moments that exist be
tween the cinematic moments, the meaningless

spaces that don't necessarily give insight into
the characters so much as the reality of their
worlds. Chopped into ten minute segments, the
effect is diminished; since we never stay with
any of the characters, we have less a sense of
their emptiness and more a sense of our own
displacement as we jump from setting to setting.
The standard Jarmusch elements are all there
— most scenes take place in deserted rooms
with only two or three speaking actors to fill the
frame, and all pieces feature an overhead table

shot, with cigarettes and coffee elements laid
out as on a chessboard or a strategic battlemap
— but these are mostly MacGuffins. In nearly
all cases, it's up to the actors themselves to
make or break the scene.
Thankfully, Jarmusch has assembled a stel
lar cast that make the most of their time on
screen: Cate Blanchett does a remarkable dou
ble turn as both a Hollywood actress and the
slummy cousin she takes off time from her hotel
press junket to meet; Alfred Molina and Steve
Cougan play nice caricatures of themselves in
"Cousins," one of the funnier shorts that never
theless shamelessly plays on Hollywood stereo
types; and Meg and Jack White are actually sur
prisingly serviceable actors in their short,
though Jarmusch can't resist making Jack spout
ersatz technobabble about a Tesla coil he has
built. The film ends with the poignantly simple
"Champagne," featuring a pair of octogenari
ans who claim they can hear Mahler's "I've Lost
Track of the World" in the ether.
It's a common conceit that the cigarette is
the actor's greatest prop, and there are sever
al moments during "Coffee and Cigarettes"
that make you feel like you're watching impro
vised acting exercises. It occurred to me after
wards that the film might have benefited great
ly from at least a couple scenes featuring re
curring characters to bookend the whole
movie; having Steven Wright and Roberto Be
nigni together again some 17 years after the
original would have seemed inspired but alas
— it's not Jarmusch's way to ever give us clo
sure of that sort.


"One of these things is riot like the other, one of these things is not quite the same... " ponders Bill
Murray. And it's not the silver teapot on the table.
