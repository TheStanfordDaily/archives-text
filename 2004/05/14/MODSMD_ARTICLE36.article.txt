# Brad Pitt's Brazilian wax makes its debut in 'Troy’

### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSIONARY FILM CRITIC 
Why must characters in big-screen epics set in ancient times
speak with a British accent? I swear that we Americans have
some sort of complex whereby it's cool to speak like a Yank only
in films that take place on American soil, and only then after
1776. What the hell? Did they speak English in Ancient Greece?

And even if they did, who's to say that Trojans
should speak more like some Victorian bloke than
a newsie from South Boston?
This is Troy's fundamental problem; the film
seems to go out of its way to match the epic subject
matter (which, according to the end credits, is "in
spired by" Homer's Iliad) with epic sounding high
brow accents, epic love stories, music, battle scenes
and facial expressions, not to mention the epic,

butt-torturing length.
So I'm pretty sure that all you Stanford types know the Iliad
sufficiently well enough to render the following summary point
less. and, as such, I'll attempt to write it with a scarcity of verbiage
to spice it up a bit. Here goes. Trojan Paris steals Spartan Helen.
Greeks Agamemnon, Menelaus = mad. Invasion of Troy.
Agamemnon = asshole. Achilles = badass. Fights fellow badass
Hector. Paris = pussy. Must fight Achilles. Add sex, lots of grunt
ing, a big horse, Peter O'Toole and you've got 2004's version of
"inspired by the Iliad."
While not cinematic brilliance by any stretch of the imagina
tion, director Wolfgang Peterson's overblown Troy is undoubt
edly a lot of fun. Brad Pitt's sassy Achilles, the alpha male of the
flick, is first introduced in bed with two women, bothering to rise
only to knife a really big dude to death. In a movie devoted to the
constant display of eye-candy, Pitt is shot in such angles that he
must have shaved down there get this one by the MPAA.
All the other characters are equally one-dimensional. Helen's
(German looker Diane Kruger) one dimension is being hot,
though probably hot enough only to launch three or four hun
dred ships, not quite the whole thousand. In addition to sheer sex
iness, Kruger shares with Pitt the complete inability to speak in a

passing British accent.
Orlando Bloom's Paris is a spineless wuss-breath. Hector
(The Hulk's Eric Bana), unlike his lame-o younger brother
Paris, is a tough, pragmatic family man, used as a foil to the re
bellious Achilles. Agamemnon (Brian Cox) is a conniving war
monger who speaks out of the side of his mouth. The list goes on.
There is no character in the film (save perhaps Peter O'Toole as
the regal Trojan King Priam) who can't be described adequate-

ly in a one-clause sentence.
The film's other intrigue-inducing character
is Briseis (Rose Byrne), a Trojan princess made
into a Greek slave, who, upon Achilles' falling in
love with her, screws everything up. It's as if Bri
seis (a minor character in Homer's work) is stuck
in just to make the story just a little less misogy
nistic. Though Helen is a helpless, whiny brat
and though the line "women have a way of com-

plicating things" is actually said, Briseis's feistiness is there to
make Troy a little more femme-friendly. They're fooling no one.
But who am I kidding here? Not one of the eight or so million
Americans who will attend Troy this weekend is interested in
character arcs full of moral ambiguities or vestiges of feminism.
Instead, they want to see some gory battle scenes (which are cer
tainly awesome, save Achilles' imitations of a ballet dancer
crossed with Jackie Chan) and the awe-inspiring realism of the
Trojan Horse. The themes of being remembered for thousands
of years for being a ruthless warrior and of women getting in the
way aren't exactly thought provoking, but are absolutely A-Ok
for summer blockbuster fare.
Troy manages to recycle aspects of two of the best epic films
in the last five years. The enormous computer-generated armies
as well as the city of Troy itself seem derivative of the Lord of the
Rings' battle of Minas Tirith, and the seemingly omnipresent
woman yodeling in the score is straight out of Gladiator.
However, the lack of originality seems almost contrived in
order to make Troy appear even more like the epic it strives to
be. Troy harkens back to the glory days of the Hollywood stu
dio system when large-scale toga films were more common. Just
lose the British accents already.
