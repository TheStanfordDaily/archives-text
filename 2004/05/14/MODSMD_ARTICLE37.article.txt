# Flirting for Dummies
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Greetings, dear readers. I know
you're all excited to read what salacious,
scandalous stories Roxy has in store for
you today. Normally, I like to get myself
off by writing about vibrators, sex. men
in loincloths, sex, threesomes, sex and
you know, S-E-X. But today's going to
be a little different. Don't get me wrong.
This column is still all about sex — 1
mean, come on, what isn't? But I think
that a lot of you out there need some
lessons in the basics before you go and
play with the big girls and the (hopeful
ly) big boys.
You know your Roxy is all about the
wham, bam, thank you, He-Man. But
you can't get to the wham, much less the
bam, without some good old fashioned
flirting. Penetrating a new relationship
is much easier and more fun with a little
help from some flirting lube. Whether it
is the ever popular dry-hump-frat
party-mating dance (which looks a lot
more "smooth" if you've tossed down a
few shots) or subtle secretive eye con
tact across a crowded lecture hall, flirt
ing is an essential precursor to all forms
of sexual fulfillment... unless you're
paying for you kicks, in which case, good
business communication skills are the
order of the day. So, here for your learn
ing pleasure, Roxy presents her Flirta
tion Guide for the Sexually Impaired
and I or Repressed.
To begin, I'll give you some simple
moves that every girl / boy / primate can
master to establish a firm (000, firm!)
flirtation foundation. I encourage indi
viduality. Everyone needs to have his I
her own flirting moves. But the most im
portant part of any move you attempt
must be the eye contact. Rox herself is a
fan of the "downturned eyes" look.
Head tilted down, eyes facing up... fol
lowed by an easy transition into a slow
smile. Try it in class, at Starbucks, any
where really. It's coy, it's come hither, it
brings proven results! Practice in front of
the mirror. Sounds silly, 1 know, but
would Roxy ever steer you wrong? I'm
really good at steering things. Steering,
whipping, same difference.

Next comes the stroking. No, not that
kind of stroking... not yet, at least. Rox
is talking about a little ego stroking.
Compliments, compliments, compli
ments. But not overkill. Be subtle.
Embed your compliment in a joke or a
sarcastic remark. Combine with down
turned eyes to establish an "inside con
nection," making the compliment / joke
appear to be just between the two of you.
Finally, I present you, dear readers,
with Roxy's magic key to flirting. Drum
roll, please. The number one answer is..
. spontaneity! Yes, that's "spontaneity."
It might be a difficult word for some us to
understand, lost amidst a world of plan
ners, post-it notes and spreadsheets —
the physical manifestations of our des
perate attempts to organize our busy
busy lives. But if you want to get busy,
you need to let go every once and awhile
and throw those post-it's out the win
dow. Wait, throw the organizer, not the
post-its. We can come up with some in
teresting uses for those later.
For the intellectuals out there, I'll
provide a spontaneity case study. Say
it's a weekday night. The stars are shin
ing, the air is cool and crisp and you're
outside with a seriously sexy girl. Let's
say she's a dancer. And daaaymn, she's
hot. So you're outside, in a field, and
the sprinklers come on. This willing
and able women squeals in delight and
says, "Oh, my cute object of flirtation,
come run through the sprinklers with
me!" Pop quiz, what do you do? RUN,
MAN, RUN WITH HER. Do not say,
"But I'll get cold." Do not hesitate, just
run. Remember the lesson of spontane
ity. Cause it you don't go for it, it'll just
be you and your old friend — your
hand—spending yet another lonely
night together.
It's spring quarter, kids. Flowers and
hormones are in full bloom. And hey.
Exotic Erotic is tomorrow night. Even
if you're not yet ready to use some of
the tits and tidbits I've suggested, you
can still get some play at Exotic. Bring
home that sexy stud in the chaps, plant
one on him, and (taking a tip from my
roommate), pull that cowboy into the
shower with you. Stir briskly and ride
him till he drops.

For the intellectuals out there, I'll
provide a spontaneity case study. Say
it's a weekday night. The stars are shin
ing, the air is cool and crisp and you're
outside with a seriously sexy girl. Let's
say she's a dancer. And daaaymn, she's
hot. So you're outside, in a field, and
the sprinklers come on. This willing
and able women squeals in delight and
says, "Oh, my cute object of flirtation,
come run through the sprinklers with
me!" Pop quiz, what do you do? RUN,
MAN, RUN WITH HER. Do not say,
"But I'll get cold." Do not hesitate, just
run. Remember the lesson of spontane
ity. Cause it you don't go for it, it'll just
be you and your old friend — your
hand—spending yet another lonely
night together.
It's spring quarter, kids. Flowers and
hormones are in full bloom. And hey.
Exotic Erotic is tomorrow night. Even
if you're not yet ready to use some of
the tits and tidbits I've suggested, you
can still get some play at Exotic. Bring
home that sexy stud in the chaps, plant
one on him, and (taking a tip from my
roommate), pull that cowboy into the
shower with you. Stir briskly and ride
him till he drops.

Greetings, dear readers. I know
you're all excited to read what salacious,
scandalous stories Roxy has in store for
you today. Normally, I like to get myself
off by writing about vibrators, sex. men
in loincloths, sex, threesomes, sex and
you know, S-E-X. But today's going to
be a little different. Don't get me wrong.
This column is still all about sex — 1
mean, come on, what isn't? But I think
that a lot of you out there need some
lessons in the basics before you go and
play with the big girls and the (hopeful
ly) big boys.
You know your Roxy is all about the
wham, bam, thank you, He-Man. But
you can't get to the wham, much less the
bam, without some good old fashioned
flirting. Penetrating a new relationship
is much easier and more fun with a little
help from some flirting lube. Whether it
is the ever popular dry-hump-frat
party-mating dance (which looks a lot
more "smooth" if you've tossed down a
few shots) or subtle secretive eye con
tact across a crowded lecture hall, flirt
ing is an essential precursor to all forms
of sexual fulfillment... unless you're
paying for you kicks, in which case, good
business communication skills are the
order of the day. So, here for your learn
ing pleasure, Roxy presents her Flirta
tion Guide for the Sexually Impaired
and I or Repressed.
To begin, I'll give you some simple
moves that every girl / boy / primate can
master to establish a firm (000, firm!)
flirtation foundation. I encourage indi
viduality. Everyone needs to have his I
her own flirting moves. But the most im
portant part of any move you attempt
must be the eye contact. Rox herself is a
fan of the "downturned eyes" look.
Head tilted down, eyes facing up... fol
lowed by an easy transition into a slow
smile. Try it in class, at Starbucks, any
where really. It's coy, it's come hither, it
brings proven results! Practice in front of
the mirror. Sounds silly, 1 know, but
would Roxy ever steer you wrong? I'm
really good at steering things. Steering,
whipping, same difference.

Next comes the stroking. No, not that
kind of stroking... not yet, at least. Rox
is talking about a little ego stroking.
Compliments, compliments, compli
ments. But not overkill. Be subtle.
Embed your compliment in a joke or a
sarcastic remark. Combine with down
turned eyes to establish an "inside con
nection," making the compliment / joke
appear to be just between the two of you.
Finally, I present you, dear readers,
with Roxy's magic key to flirting. Drum
roll, please. The number one answer is..
. spontaneity! Yes, that's "spontaneity."
It might be a difficult word for some us to
understand, lost amidst a world of plan
ners, post-it notes and spreadsheets —
the physical manifestations of our des
perate attempts to organize our busy
busy lives. But if you want to get busy,
you need to let go every once and awhile
and throw those post-it's out the win
dow. Wait, throw the organizer, not the
post-its. We can come up with some in
teresting uses for those later.
