We are entering a new era of McCarthyism.
In Indianapolis, one radio station will no longer let the words
"damn" and "urinate" air on Rush Limbaugh's talk show. Radio
station empire Clear Channel has fired Howard Stern for talking
about anal sex. U2 pop-rock sensation Bono let one wayward
"fuck" slip at last year's Golden Globes and earned NBC a mas
sive fine. And apparently timid America can't handle the pruri
ence of England's "Masterpiece Theater" â€” U.S. viewers will no
longer have the option of viewing the unedited British version.
Today's fascistic purveyor of cultural Puritanism is Michael
Powell, chair of the Federal Communications Commission (and
son to Secretary of State Colin). He presides over a realm of cul
tural conservatism vacated fifty years ago by Senator Joseph P.
McCarthy, who smothered First Amendment (and other) rights
in his own, hectoring, anti-Communist way.
Looking back on the last two months, it's a little unbelievable
that Mr. Powell's name was virtually unknown until Feb. 1,2004,
a date that will live on in history as the Sept. 11 of free speech in
the media. It was on Feb. 1 that that vixen of traditional American
values, Janet Jackson, bared her metal-adorned breast to the 90
million-strong Super Bowl audience and provoked a maelstrom
of conservative backlash.
Since then. Congress, at the behest of Mr. Powell, has in
creased the fines for rule-breaking broadcasters eighteen-fold,
from $27,500 to $500,000 per violation, and a speech-stomping
chill has settled over the United States' hegemonic media em
pires, a chill so cold it's best measured in Kelvins.
But perhaps this should come as little surprise. After all, the
culture wars that have been simmering in recent years began roil
ing as soon as President Bush took office. From stem cell research
to gay marriage to "distasteful" speech, we are witnessing the be
ginnings of a new Republican Crusade to stomp "un-Christian"
values, acts and ideas.
If you're as unhappy about this as I am, tell Mr. Powell what
you think. His e-mail address is Michael.P<mcll@fec.gov. Let's re
define "distasteful" speech for him.


Lady Liberty 's looking quite busty these days. Don't wait for her
to pull a Janet Jackson and flash her assets, though. She's no slut.
