# The 						Art of Porn
## Larry Sultan's photography at the SFMOMA 
### ANNA NORTH INTERMISSONARY EXTRAORDINAIRE 
Our Porn Stars, Ourselves. "This exhibition
contains explicit images," reads the placard at the
entrance of "Larry Sultan: The Valley," "SFMO
MA recommends that adults preview the exhibi
tion before sharing it with children." At first, it's
hard to tell what they're talking about. The first
image in the gallery is called "Backyard Film Set,"
and includes a lush lawn, a rather innocuous trash
can and an elm tree bathed in ethereal light. Puz
zling, perhaps, but hardly explicit.
Stick with the show, however, and you'll dis
cover what the placard means. The film in progress
on "Film Set" isn't, say, a suburban family drama.
It's an adult movie, one of many routinely shot in

rented tract homes in LA's
San Fernando Valley. These
homes form the setting for
Sultan's latest project. His
human subjects are those
deities of American popular
mythology, porn stars.
Sultan understands this
mythology, characterizing
the actors he met as the sexu
al icons of American high
schools. "We all remember
those," he says, "who found
ways of using their bodies to
get what they needed."
But "The Valley"
doesn't indulge our adoles
cent fantasies.
Says Sultan, "I'm not in
terested in the come shot."
The kinds of shots he is
interested in are the ones
that reveal not fluids, but
psyches. The San Fernando
Valley, where Sultan grew
up, isn't just the capital of
our country's porn industry.
It's also a classic example of
American suburbia, and the
intersection of these two
worlds is what motivates
Sultan's work.

In "Den, Santa Clarita," a naked posterior juts
out into what is otherwise a normal living room,
complete with home entertainment system. "West
Valley Studio #3" features a lush-haired, partly
naked actress — and an exercise bike. And in
"Child's Bedroom," the titular room contains a
shelf of dolls, some family photographs and, re
flected in the mirror, the lush blond hair of some
one decidedly not a child.
Despite their differences (after all, a porn film
may be the opposite of a family film). Sultan's
work explores a connection between pornogra
phy and family life. In many of his tract-home set
tings, it seems that one family has moved out, only
to be replaced by a new one — stranger, perhaps,
but no less close.
"Tasha's Third Film" shows a woman in curlers
reclining on a couch. Flanking her are two men
sleeping like babies — the effect is one of people
totally comfortable with one another. In "Patio,
Delita Drive," two women sit on deck chairs, both
naked but partially covered. Physically, they are as
similar as sisters, and their calm, slightly amused

expressions suggest Sultan has interrupted an inti
mate conversation.
"Intimate," in fact, is a word Sultan uses to
characterize the sets he visited. And it's not a eu
phemism for him. He describes the cast and crew
of a porn film as united by surprisingly close rela
tionships, likening them to "a circus family."
Given the exhibition's subject matter, the com
parison seems fitting. Adjusting each other's cos
tumes, relaxing together on a patio or couch, the
people in"The Valley" often display a heart
warming tenderness. But Sultan never lets us for
get that these subjects are performers, that even in
their most private moments the show is going on.
Sometimes this show is obvious. Sex acts are
visible in many of the images — a masked man en
ters a woman from behind, a threesome takes

place beside a pool, a quiet living room scene gets
a dose of oddness from a knot of writhing forms
outside.
But not all the photographs contain naked bod
ies. In those more suitable for children, the eroti
cism comes through in Sultan's skill with color and
light. Lawns are emerald green. The red uphol
stery of a couch takes on the depth and luster of
apple skin. And more often than not, light appears
to come directly from Heaven.
Pornography, for Sultan, isn't just an aid to ado
lescent masturbation. It's also the expression of
our collective fantasies, a way of "compensating
lor the isolation of the suburbs." It's not just the ac
tors who are on display here, but the Valley itself,
and, as Sultan's photographs reveal, it becomes a
kind of Eden.
This Edenic quality is perhaps most obvious —
and problematic —in "Woodland Hills Back
yard." Shot in slanting afternoon light, the yard is
a vision of green turf and pink flowers. A woman
in a black bikini faces the setting sun, which bathes
her in a golden glow.

The foreground of the photograph, though,
shows a man and a woman, seated far apart, di
recting at each other sidelong glances that suggest
mistrust. The woman in the bikini may be a figure
of fantasy, but this couple seems decidedly Earth
ly. If they are Adam and Eve, this is after the Fall.
Despite its closeness, the porn family is not ex
actly a happy one. As performance, pornography
is grueling — Sultan is careful to note the enor
mous physical stress porn actors suffer in their
work. That this stress has recently exploded into
outright danger comes as no surprise to him at all.
Asked to comment on the recent rash of HIV
infections among the Valley's porn actors — five
cases have been confirmed in the past month,
four linked to a single infected star — Sultan de
scribed the problem as "unfortunate," but "not

shocking." While per
formers were required to
produce records of STD
tests before each shoot,
these records were not
foolproof. Sultan's subur
ban paradises take on a dif
ferent character when we
insert into them the ever
present threat of disease.
Beautiful bodies em
bracing in heavenly light
may glamorize suburban
life. However, they also re
veal suburban appetites
whose satiation sometimes
comes at terrible cost. In
the end, porn actors take
risks no family can protect
them from. They are not
guests in the Valley's tract
houses, making themselves
at home while the residents
arc away. Rather, they are
there to service these resi
dents' desires.
The most disturbing
image in"The Valley" is
called "Little Cinderella."
Its subject is a waiflike
blond woman lost in a gray

sweatshirt, standing on a
rundown Valley street. Gone are the support sys
tem of costars and crew. Gone are the beautiful
saturated colors. "Cinderella is alone in an un
friendly, unlovely world.
If we see "Cinderella" as a porn actress, her
image exemplifies the pain of her profession. Mar
ginalized like circus performers, women like her
satisfy the cravings of others at the cost of their
own safety. If. on the other hand, she's an ordinary
suburban woman, she might embody the reason
for these cravings.
Nowhere is "the isolation of the suburbs"
more apparent than in the eyes of "Little Cin
derella." Nowhere is the need fora fantasy of rich
color and reckless coupling more obvious than in
the drainage ditches and empty yards of the street
behind her.
Larry Sultan spends much of "The Valley" ex
amining how pornography creates the illusion of a
suburban Eden. But the most powerful of his im
ages may be the least Eden-like. Only when he
strips away the illusion do we see why we might so
desperately desire it.

bowls and dildos. Naked man not included.


As one might expect, there are a lot of beds and couches on porn sets. Also as expected, not much sleep
ing goes on in them.
