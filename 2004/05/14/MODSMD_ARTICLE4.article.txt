# Security up for Exotic
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
The most infamous of Stan
ford parties is also the toughest
to plan. While most students
are preparing their outfits for
Exotic Erotic, to be held to
morrow, the 680 Lomita staff
has been creating a party plan
that they hope will ensure the
safety of all attendees and min
imize the chaos that transpired
last year.
One of the biggest changes
this year will be a total evacu
ation of residents and guests
at 10 p.m., when the party be
gins. Everyone will have to re
enter through the standard se
curity entrance along with all
other guests.
"Exotic Erotic tends to
draw a large crowd, which can
create challenges for the party
planners regarding crowd con
trol," said Associate Director
of Student Activities Joey
Greenwell. "We also want to
make sure that unwanted
guests — outsiders to the Uni
versity— do not attend and
cause any problems for the 680
Lomita residents."
In line with the emphasis on
good party-planning, all 680
residents had to go through a
party-planning workshop after
dinner last week with Associ
ate Director of Student Activi
ties Joey Greenwell.
"The vast majority of the
residents have not had the expe
rience of hosting such a large
event," Greenwell said. "I
wanted to provide the same in
formation to all residents to as
sist the party planners. I have
been asked to do similar work
shops for other houses before
and found they have found it
very helpful in assisting with
their parties."
According to a resident,
Greenwell said he was worried
because there are always sexual
assault complaints at Exotic
Erotic — something that
doesn't happen at other parties.
He also explained that last
year's security was a mess. In
addition, unlike fraternities, the
makeup of 680 changes every
year and the people who are
knowledgeable about planning
don't live there anymore, which
makes it harder to plan events
as large as Exotic Erotic.
Police Chief Laura Wilson
said she is somewhat wary of

the party.
"Exotic Erotic is a popular
on-campus party with a long
history," Wilson said. "Some
of that history includes over
crowding, blatant violations of
state alcohol laws, excessive al
cohol consumption and re
ports of sexual assaults taking
place during or immediately
after the party."
Still, she said, "I don't think
anyone in the University or the
police department wants to
prevent students from having a
good time. Collectively, our
goal is to educate students so
they will make decisions that do
not result in physical, emotion
al or psychological harm to
themselves or others."
Last year's Exotic Erotic
created an extra uproar be
cause of the police entry into
the party with video cameras,
recording violations of under
age drinking.
"There was no specific plan
to videotape the event last year,
nor is there a specific plan to
videotape the event this year,"
Wilson said. "When officers ar
rived at the party last year, they
observed several public safety
issues and wanted to document
those concerns. Videotape
memorializes an incident in a
way that leaves little room for
interpretation of the facts."
Wilson warned students
that that there is no legal expec
tation of privacy when you are
in a public place.
"My best advice for students
who are concerned about being
videotaped by the police or
anyone else for that matter is
don't leave your room wearing
something that your mother
would be ashamed to see you
wearing if she saw you on the 11
o'clock news," Wilson said.
In other party changes,
there will be no VIP room this
year. There are not enough 680
residents over the age of 21 to
have a VIP room serving hard
alcohol or mixed drinks.
"Instead of a VIP party
room the residents will have a
lounge for their use," Green
well said.
In compliance with a Uni
versity rule requiring one
sober monitor for every 50
guests, there will be 20 sober
monitors per hour, as the
house is expecting 1,000
