# An essential hip-hop triumvirate
## 
### ANDREW NIELSEN INTERMISSIONARY 
Let's flash back to 1988. The gold
en era of hip-hop was at its peak.
Run-DMC had just released their
last commercially successful record,
"Tougher than Leather," and Public
Enemy was on the cutting edge of the
political and sonic assault of rap. As

rap began to take a back seat and the
decade turned, major labels began to
take wind to this "alternative thing."
DGC released "Nevermind" and
every label wanted a Nirvana.
This was something new and dif
ferent to the mainstream pop of the
late '80s, before the genre was
squeezed to death and reduced to an
unchallenging background of corpo

rate elevator muzak and Matchbox
20. Right now, however, it might be
safe to say that underground hip-hop
is the new "alternative" of this decade
— the necessary antithesis to Usher
and Nickelback. But, as with Nirvana,
it won't be long before the major la
bels take this developing, emerging
genre and run with it.
Right now, however, it's an excit-

ing time for the
genre — a time
when, all at once, it's
innocent, wise and
mind-blowing, as the
new DJ Signify, An
ticon and Madvillain
records suggest.
DJ Signify's
"Sleep No More"
(Lex Records) is an
instrumental album
that features the mad
skills of the Non-
Prophets' Sage Fran
cis and Toronto rap
per Buck-65. Signify
cuts it up under a
gothic, post-industri
al sample bed, calling
to mind El-P's work
with Company Ilow.
but with a more ex-

perimental and jazzy approach.
"Haunted House Party" is a party-type
track and Sage drops coffeehouse
rhymes over the lurching beat. "Shatter
& Splatter" is all over the place, with
recorded and manipulated samples of
children's toys — an intriguing fusion
that somehow works. "Winter's
Going" drives with a violin sample and
a nylon string guitar while Buck-65
reminiscences on past relationships
with a (low that is more Tom Waits
than KRS-One. In short, the album
stands out, not only for its product
value, but for Signify's decision to ask
Sage and Buck to rhyme on the record.
The new CD from Anticon, the
East Bay rap collective, is a five-year
retrospective that highlights some of
the label's best work. Formed by
Berkeley graduate emcee Sole, Anti
con has recently been getting much
deserved props, both nationally and
abroad, and has been dubbed as "the
most exciting, unstable [label] out of
North America right now" (Wire).
What is so dope about the "Anti
con Label Sampler: 1999-2004" is
that it really traces the label's evolu
tion, exploring influences that are as
likely to stem from indie rock as from
hip-hop. The two Passage tracks
sound like catchy indie pop, but on
further listen one realizes that it is a
bizarre new wave of indie hip-hop
that doesn't exist yet: Anticon is in
venting it. Slug (of Atmosphere)
makes a guest appearance on the
Deep Puddle Dynamics track, his
verse a poignant reminder that even
the Jim Morrison of emo rap started
out in the Anticon world.
Sage Francis raps like a banshee on
"Crack Pipes," a standout song about
domestic abuse. He says, "it's like a
whirlwind of emotion when dads and
moms fight... When extreme tem
perature changes and fluctuations
have been known to crack pipes."
With such underground stars as these
and a diverse palette of music, this
compilation reinforces the label's

seminal presence in the scene.
Finally, the Madvillain album
"Madvillainy" (Stones Throw
Records) reminds us that not only is
their artistic experimentation and in
trospective poetry coming out of the
underground, there is raw emcee tal
ent here. The album, a much-anticipat
ed collaboration between DJ Madlib
and rapper MF Doom, is a 22 track
tour-de-force. "Accordion" is a dope
track that samples a *surprise* accor
dion (without sounding like Weird
Al's polka version of "The Real Slim
Shady"). It is a cool jazzy track, with
Doom rhyming, "Living off borrowed
time the clock ticks faster / That'll be
the hour they knock the sick blaster."
"Do Not Fire" is based on sam
ples from Michael Jackson's
"Thriller" and Street Fighter 2 (the
video game). And guess what? It
works. "All Caps" drives with a jazzy
piano line, and on "Great Day"
Doom says, "Looks like it's gonna be
a great day today / To get some fresh
air like a stray on a straightaway."
With this outstanding crop of new
music, it's a great day indeed.
Proving itself as the next "alterna
tive," it may not be long before the
underground hip-hop crosses over,
the Anticon crew begins selling cars
and DJ Madlib scores Coke commer
cials. Let's just hope that by that time,
the genre has begun to suck, and we'll
be ready for the major labels to take
it away from us. For now, there's no
better time to see what is happening
in this world because it's a sonically
exciting and challenging one indeed.
