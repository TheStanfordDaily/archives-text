### TRACY OLIVER INTERMISSIONARY 
For those of you who have not had an op
portunity to pick up a copy of Inphanyte's
first CD, "A Brand New Nyte," you are miss
ing out on some of Stanford's most talented
singers, rappers, writers, and producers. Rap
pers Jidenna Mobisson and Jim Chitty are
featured on the CD's infectious first single,
"Nice to Meet You Too," which is a testa
ment to their talents both as rappers and lyri
cists. The strength of this single lies within its
beat, the creativity of their lyrics and their
flow, which is reminiscent of Jay-Z. The
catchy hook is sung by Roopa Mahadevan
and Kisha O'Connor, who also provide the
two-part harmonies in between the rap vers
es. The title and hook of the song, created by
Chitty, function as an introduction for listen
ers to the rappers as well as to the Inphanyte
label, produced by Frederick Alexander and
Johnathon Jones.
"Around the Bay" primarily features Jiden
na who shares a portion of his life story, includ
ing his journey from Africa to the United States
with the lyrics: "Came to the states with an ac

cent like Eddie Murphy in 'Coming to America'
/ that's when he quickly assimilated / cuz that's
exactly what humiliation does." The hook has
an old school feel, reminiscent of the seventies
soul songs our parents have on records. Chitty's
final verse to the song completes what may be
the catchiest rap single on the album.
Fred Alexander's "What Is It About You"
also makes a return to a sound characteristic of
a past decade, specifically the early 90s. This
single, while not slow enough to be called a
ballad or fast enough to be considered a club
song, is relaxing enough to calm your nerves if
you are in the mood to chill. Ladies especially
will feel it for its Donell Jones quality as it is
the first love single on the CD.
The strongest point in "Can't Go On" is
Roopa Mahadevan's vocal ability. Her soulful
and strong vocal quality is a pleasure to listen
to, but the beat does nothing to enhance the
song as a whole. Consequently, the song feels
as if it's missing a few elements that would have
made it more enjoyable.
For those who love spiritual or gospel
music, Bob Bell's "Giving My All To You" is
an inspirational song intended for those who
are seeking spiritual guidance. Bell's lyrics are
centered around surrendering himself to God

- hence the title. The musical composition is
beautiful and his voice is soft and not at all
overbearing. This creates the feel that the
message of the song is more important than
demonstrating his vocal range and ability.
Rybo's "Race of a Lifetime" shares part of
his life story with a flow similar to rappers such
as Common or The Roots. His style directly
contrasts with that of Jidenna and Chitty,
whose lyrics discuss vastly different topics and
display club-ready beats.
Alexander's second single on the album,
"You," is a ballad paying homage to women.
The opening line, "Let me undress your
mind," places emphasis on the internal beauty
in women as opposed to physical characteris
tics most lyricists sing about in hip-hop today.
The song is simplistic, featuring only a piano
and Alexander's vocals, but both complement
each other nicely.
If there is a song to generate discussion, it
should be Jidenna's "Bus Pass," which is a hu
morous commentary on women that are only
after him for his money. The song is not at all
misogynistic or sexist, as Jidenna only address
es a certain kind of woman. As a lyricist, Jiden
na's hook is blatantly against "gold diggers,"
but those who do not take the time to listen to

the lyrics may be offended by its content.
Chitty's "Come to Poppa" is a heartfelt
song commenting on the absence of the father
in some American families as well as the
harmful effects fathers can have on their chil
dren as in the second verse. The beat and hook
compliment the intensity of the song. Chitty's
verses are well written and the tribute he pays
to his own father completes a great song with
a great message.
Eric Lee and Roopa Mahadevan's "Not The
One For Me" is a beautifully composed, writ
ten, and sung masterpiece. Lee's soothing vocal
quality blends well with Mahadevan's voice
nicely to create a duet that easily surpasses a
number of commercial releases. Mahadevan's
vocal ability and range is at its best in the song
as she is able a plethora of high and low notes in
her chest voice. Lee and Mahadevan create a
duet that easily conveys Lee's beautiful lyrics.
The Inphanyte CD is an amazing compila
tion of Stanford's diversity and talent. Its wide
array of music - from ballads to club music —
results in an album where most listeners will
find a single they can appreciate. " A Brand
New Nyte" is an incredible album, leaving lis
teners with a greater appreciation of Stanford's
immense talent.

will feel it for its Donell Jones quality as it is
the first love single on the CD.
The strongest point in "Can't Go On" is
Roopa Mahadevan's vocal ability. Her soulful
and strong vocal quality is a pleasure to listen
to, but the beat does nothing to enhance the
song as a whole. Consequently, the song feels
as if it's missing a few elements that would have
made it more enjoyable.
For those who love spiritual or gospel
music, Bob Bell's "Giving My All To You" is
an inspirational song intended for those who
are seeking spiritual guidance. Bell's lyrics are
centered around surrendering himself to God

- hence the title. The musical composition is
beautiful and his voice is soft and not at all
overbearing. This creates the feel that the
message of the song is more important than
demonstrating his vocal range and ability.
Rybo's "Race of a Lifetime" shares part of
his life story with a flow similar to rappers such
as Common or The Roots. His style directly
contrasts with that of Jidenna and Chitty,
whose lyrics discuss vastly different topics and
display club-ready beats.
Alexander's second single on the album,
"You," is a ballad paying homage to women.
The opening line, "Let me undress your
mind," places emphasis on the internal beauty
in women as opposed to physical characteris
tics most lyricists sing about in hip-hop today.
The song is simplistic, featuring only a piano
and Alexander's vocals, but both complement
each other nicely.
If there is a song to generate discussion, it
should be Jidenna's "Bus Pass," which is a hu
morous commentary on women that are only
after him for his money. The song is not at all
misogynistic or sexist, as Jidenna only address
es a certain kind of woman. As a lyricist, Jiden
na's hook is blatantly against "gold diggers,"
but those who do not take the time to listen to

the lyrics may be offended by its content.
Chitty's "Come to Poppa" is a heartfelt
song commenting on the absence of the father
in some American families as well as the
harmful effects fathers can have on their chil
dren as in the second verse. The beat and hook
compliment the intensity of the song. Chitty's
verses are well written and the tribute he pays
to his own father completes a great song with
a great message.
Eric Lee and Roopa Mahadevan's "Not The
One For Me" is a beautifully composed, writ
ten, and sung masterpiece. Lee's soothing vocal
quality blends well with Mahadevan's voice
nicely to create a duet that easily surpasses a
number of commercial releases. Mahadevan's
vocal ability and range is at its best in the song
as she is able a plethora of high and low notes in
her chest voice. Lee and Mahadevan create a
duet that easily conveys Lee's beautiful lyrics.
The Inphanyte CD is an amazing compila
tion of Stanford's diversity and talent. Its wide
array of music - from ballads to club music —
results in an album where most listeners will
find a single they can appreciate. " A Brand
New Nyte" is an incredible album, leaving lis
teners with a greater appreciation of Stanford's
immense talent.
For those of you who have not had an op
portunity to pick up a copy of Inphanyte's
first CD, "A Brand New Nyte," you are miss
ing out on some of Stanford's most talented
singers, rappers, writers, and producers. Rap
pers Jidenna Mobisson and Jim Chitty are
featured on the CD's infectious first single,
"Nice to Meet You Too," which is a testa
ment to their talents both as rappers and lyri
cists. The strength of this single lies within its
beat, the creativity of their lyrics and their
flow, which is reminiscent of Jay-Z. The
catchy hook is sung by Roopa Mahadevan
and Kisha O'Connor, who also provide the
two-part harmonies in between the rap vers
es. The title and hook of the song, created by
Chitty, function as an introduction for listen
ers to the rappers as well as to the Inphanyte
label, produced by Frederick Alexander and
Johnathon Jones.
"Around the Bay" primarily features Jiden
na who shares a portion of his life story, includ
ing his journey from Africa to the United States
with the lyrics: "Came to the states with an ac

cent like Eddie Murphy in 'Coming to America'
/ that's when he quickly assimilated / cuz that's
exactly what humiliation does." The hook has
an old school feel, reminiscent of the seventies
soul songs our parents have on records. Chitty's
final verse to the song completes what may be
the catchiest rap single on the album.
Fred Alexander's "What Is It About You"
also makes a return to a sound characteristic of
a past decade, specifically the early 90s. This
single, while not slow enough to be called a
ballad or fast enough to be considered a club
song, is relaxing enough to calm your nerves if
you are in the mood to chill. Ladies especially
will feel it for its Donell Jones quality as it is
the first love single on the CD.
