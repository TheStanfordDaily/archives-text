# The
						Stanford rap scene: Oxymoron no longer

### TRACY OLIVER INTERMISSIONARY 
INTERMISSION: What rapper inspires you?
JAMES Cffl'lTY: Tupac, because he had a certain
thug appeal that earned him street credibility but at
the same time he had righteous motives. 1 believe
he wanted to use rap as a way of helping his people
out, but he got taken out before he got a chance to
reach his potential as a leader. 1 love Andre from
OutKast, he's one of the most creative and poetic
emcees ever. I also like Jay-Z because he is real nice
with words and he does something that a lot of rap
pers don't do: he allows his audience to get to know
who he is by letting you inside of his life.
INT: What is the meaning of "Come to Poppa"?
JC: I wrote this song for different reasons. For
one, a lot of cats don't have dads. The black dad
being absent from the family unit is a big issue in
black America. I wanted to pay tribute to my own
dad and at the same time tell stories of people who
did not have fathers present in their lives or had
bad fathers.
INT: How has Inphanyte helped your rapping career?
JC: When I was first asked to be on the album, 1
was in a writing slump. But studio time and dead
lines for completing songs really acted as a source
of motivation for me. It also gave me a chance to
record in a facility that would produce a pretty
good quality sound.
INT: How has Stanford influenced your career?
JC: Back at home, I didn't let many people know I was
a rapper. Stanford was one of the first places that I was
really out with my rapping ambitions, and people re
sponded positively to me every time I performed, so it
really acted as a huge confident booster for me.
INT: Let's say five years from now you have an
album. How do you want people to categorize you'?
JC: I want to make a variety of music. I want to make
people bob their heads, but at the same time I want to
make people think. My ultimate goal is to make com

mercial music that doesn't compromise my values.
INT: Explain the concept and origin of the first sin
gle, "Nice to Meet You Too."
JC: We knew we wanted to introduce ourselves to
Stanford's campus and that's how the song came
along. We just wanted people to know who we are,
where we're from and what we're doing, so when it
came time to write a hook I just threw those three
things in there and followed the horns.
INT: Where does education stand in your
music career?
JC: You have to look at it like I'm an athlete.
Athletes can easily become injured and lose their
chances of going to the pros, similar to artists and
entertainers who aren't guaranteed a longtime
career. If a college athlete gets injured, he's going
to need his degree to make it in the world. So you
need a back up plan. I'm a black man fortunate
enough to be at Stanford and I know I have to
take advantage of it, so Stanford is a pretty solid
back up plan in case I'm not where I need to be in
the next couple of years. Hopefully if all goes as
planned with Rhythm Revolution — that's the
label I plan on signing with — then I won't have
to use my degree to get paid.

INTERMISSION: When did you first
start rapping?
JIDENNA MOBISSON: Seventh grade,
but it wasn't that serious. Freshman year in
high school I met this guy who also rapped,
but was more serious because he was from
the hood. For him, it was an outlet. We then
formed a rap group called Black Spadez.
INT: What rappers inspire you?
JM: In Seventh grade it was Biggie, Mase,
and Nas, who has always been the most in
fluential rapper to me. I also liked DMX and
A Tribe Called Quest. As I got older, my
racial identity became more salient. Police
harassed me, kids called me "nigger," and I
began to get angry. Tupac became my fa
vorite rapper, as he still is today.
INT: Where do you see yourself in the next
few years?
JM: When I applied to school, I never
thought I'd stay there for four years. School
has never been a mark of your credibility to
me. In the next few years, I expect to have my
name on some aspect of the entertainment
industry whether as a rapper, producer, etc.
INT: Explain the concept of "Bus Pass."
JM: I was told that I had a song on the
album called "Bus Pass." I thought about
what a bus pass meant to me and it meant
that you didn't have money to buy a car. I
live from transaction to transaction, hus
tling CDs or whatever I can sell on the
side of my part-time jobs. Materialistic
girls always want a dude with a car and
those are the girls I don't like - gold dig
gers. That is who I humorously criticize in
the song, a particular type of female.
INT: Explain the concept of "Around the
Bay," which is partly your life story.

JM: Since I'm coming to the west coast
from Boston, I was basically saying holla at
me if you want me to stay. I'm from Nige
ria and lived there for seven years before
coming to the United States. My father
was a chief and, basically, his sons are to be
the chief, which is how I got this nickname.
INT: Your first album has just been released
nationwide. How do you want people to
perceive your music?
JM: I don't want to be categorized as
too commercial or too righteous. I'm in
the middle. I don't wear dashikis or
throwbacks. I'm not rich but not dead
broke. I'm somewhere in between black
and white. I live on the border of the
hood and a suburb. I can't look at life
like anyone else in the game. One of my
other song's lyrics go: "Is he Tupac or
Common? /1 look at life at different an
gles, eyes are octagonal." I'm not going
to tell the drug dealers I know to stop
selling weed 'cause I understand them.
I'm not going to tell kids to drop out of
school, either. I'm not a role model, but
at least I'm a real person.


All of a sudden, Intermission decides to explore
the beauty of high-res close-ups. Rejoice.


Ah, the life of a rapper. It's not all fun and
games, kids.
