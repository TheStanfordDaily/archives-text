Chicken and a Pizza Hut!
Remember that annoying
song you sang in elementary
school that your little precocious
mind frowned upon? "Nay, cor
porate America, nay!" you want
ed to shout. "You will not poison
my innocent mind."
And yet, in spite of your ide
alism, you found yourself getting
a Happy Meal after the bell rang.

And some chicken
wings after softball
practice. And, lest we
forget, the much
needed pizza deliver
ies all those freshman
year nights.
Yes, there's no

nation, and individually, love fast
food. In Morgan Spurlock's docu
mentary "Super Size Me," the film
maker and star of the film attempts to
exhibit the exact cost of this ill-fated
love affair by eating only McDonald's
three times a day for one whole month
— no exceptions.
The documentary begins with
Spurlock getting his pre-McDiet
check-up, rectal exam and all. Con
tinuing in the same vein of honesty,
the film follows the day-to-day trials
and tribulations of Spurlock's so
called experiment — the recommen
dations of his three doctors and dieti
cian, the quick onset of lethargy and
depression, his eventual distaste for
Chicken McNuggets.
On the third day, when he is forced
into a Super Sized meal (one of the
rules is that he must accept any up
grade offers), we watch Spurlock feel
so ill he cannot help but vomit. In later
days we watch interviews with the de
lightful foil found in Spurlock's vegan
chef girlfriend, and her commentary
regarding the couple's sex life post
weight gain provides what may very
well be the highlight of the narrative
aspect of the film.
Having such a narrative thread
carry the film, Spurlock succeeds in
keeping the viewer involved and in
vested in the actual point at hand —
the point at hand being, of course, that
there is a serious, often fatal eating
problem in this country, with more
than two-thirds of Americans official
ly considered overweight.
In a considerably less polemical
fashion than Michael Moore, Spur
lock investigates the many potential
roots of the problem. One of his most
powerful points is made when he goes
into schools and investigates the
precedent cafeterias set with their

daily meals. Upon ex
amination, it be
comes clear that
Spurlock is onto
something: the food
students consume day
in and day out in their
lunch rooms isn't ex
actly encouraging

healthy eating habits. In fact, the pre
packaged French fries and greasy
burgers are very much fueling the
lifestyle that leads us to consume in
the way that makes us dangerously —
and fatally — fat.
So why McDonald's? Is it just an
easy scapegoat, a gimmicky endeav
or Spurlock takes on to get atten
tion? Well, yes and no. In Manhat
tan, there are 83 Mickey D's alone.
What, Spurlock, begs, is the connec
tion here? Are corporate food com
panies responsible?
Examining the court case in
which two overweight girls sued Mc-
Donald's, Spurlock does not excuse
individual responsibility. At the
same time, Spurlock illuminates the
ways in which corporate America
does indeed heavily influence many
eaters' current lifestyles. Balanced
with other thoughtful causes — such
as the aforementioned school lunch
food effect — Spurlock's thesis be
comes believable, not just a nice ex
cuse Americans can use to feel less
bad about themselves.
It is interesting to note that Spur
lock considers Michael Moore his
hero, as one of the film's strengths is
that it overcomes a classic Moore
shortcoming: being too complex for
its own good. Spurlock's points are
impassioned but clear. The movie
stays provocative without pushing
you into so many different directions
that it overwhelms your cognitive
abilities. This is not to say the film is
perfect — the amount of puns on Mc
anything in the throw-up scene might
cause a few to feel ill themselves.
Overall, the film is entertaining and
relevant and, like the documentaries
of his hero, "Super Size Me" will at
the very least fuel some very neces
sary discussion.

dations of his three doctors and dieti
cian, the quick onset of lethargy and
depression, his eventual distaste for
Chicken McNuggets.
On the third day, when he is forced
into a Super Sized meal (one of the
rules is that he must accept any up
grade offers), we watch Spurlock feel
so ill he cannot help but vomit. In later
days we watch interviews with the de
lightful foil found in Spurlock's vegan
chef girlfriend, and her commentary
regarding the couple's sex life post
weight gain provides what may very
well be the highlight of the narrative
aspect of the film.
Having such a narrative thread
carry the film, Spurlock succeeds in
keeping the viewer involved and in
vested in the actual point at hand —
the point at hand being, of course, that
there is a serious, often fatal eating
problem in this country, with more
than two-thirds of Americans official
ly considered overweight.
In a considerably less polemical
fashion than Michael Moore, Spur
lock investigates the many potential
roots of the problem. One of his most
powerful points is made when he goes
into schools and investigates the
precedent cafeterias set with their

daily meals. Upon ex
amination, it be
comes clear that
Spurlock is onto
something: the food
students consume day
in and day out in their
lunch rooms isn't ex
actly encouraging

healthy eating habits. In fact, the pre
packaged French fries and greasy
burgers are very much fueling the
lifestyle that leads us to consume in
the way that makes us dangerously —
and fatally — fat.
So why McDonald's? Is it just an
easy scapegoat, a gimmicky endeav
or Spurlock takes on to get atten
tion? Well, yes and no. In Manhat
tan, there are 83 Mickey D's alone.
What, Spurlock, begs, is the connec
tion here? Are corporate food com
panies responsible?
Examining the court case in
which two overweight girls sued Mc-
Donald's, Spurlock does not excuse
individual responsibility. At the
same time, Spurlock illuminates the
ways in which corporate America
does indeed heavily influence many
eaters' current lifestyles. Balanced
with other thoughtful causes — such
as the aforementioned school lunch
food effect — Spurlock's thesis be
comes believable, not just a nice ex
cuse Americans can use to feel less
bad about themselves.
It is interesting to note that Spur
lock considers Michael Moore his
hero, as one of the film's strengths is
that it overcomes a classic Moore
shortcoming: being too complex for
its own good. Spurlock's points are
impassioned but clear. The movie
stays provocative without pushing
you into so many different directions
that it overwhelms your cognitive
abilities. This is not to say the film is
perfect — the amount of puns on Mc
anything in the throw-up scene might
cause a few to feel ill themselves.
Overall, the film is entertaining and
relevant and, like the documentaries
of his hero, "Super Size Me" will at
the very least fuel some very neces
sary discussion.
