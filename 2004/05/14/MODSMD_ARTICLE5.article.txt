# Community relations director named
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Capitalizing on her experience
with local land-use issues, local attor
ney Jean McCown will become di
rector of community relations on
Monday. As a former Palo Alto City
Council member, McCown has nu
merous connections to the local
community and has consulted with
Stanford about development over
the past five years.
She will replace Andy Coe, who is
leaving the post today after 11 years.
"When you have a vacancy like
this you first look and see if anyone
you are working with will be quali
fied and Jean was that kind of per
son," said Larry Horton. associate
vice president for public affairs.
"When we found out Jean might be
interested we thought she was well
suited to the position."
McCown served on the Palo
Alto City Council from 1990 to
1998, and was mayor in 1993. She
has also worked on the city's plan
ning commission.
As partner at local law firm

Ritchey Fisher Whitman & Klein,
McCown focused on land-use is
sues, as well as environmental and
real estate law. She has also worked
with several different groups to pre
serve open space in various Bay
Area counties.
"She understands the Palo Alto
community and the entire region,"
Horton said. "She has represented
clients on land use issues. She knows
the issues and the local politics."
Stanford is currently working on
several land-use projects that Mc-
Cown will contribute to once she as
sumes her new position. The Uni
versity is finalizing a deal with the
city to build playing fields on Stan
ford land in exchange for expanded
development rights in the Stanford
Research Park.
McCown will also have to work to
resolve a dispute between local resi
dents, the county and Stanford over
plans for recreational trails that may
pass through Stanford lands near the
Dish. Santa Clara County and Stan
ford officials have clashed over the
cost and placement of these trails,
spawning a drawn-out process with

no end currently in sight.
"The unresolved issues of the
trails has become very complicated
and political," Horton said. "[They]
will need to be resolved."
Palo Alto Mayor Bern Beecham
noted that although many of the is
sues will be hard to solve, McCown
has experience on both sides that will
be helpful.
According to Beecham, Stan
ford's land is technically within Palo
Alto's sphere of influence. For this
reason any changes on University
land require extensive consulting
with the surrounding community.
"There is hardly a better person in
the local community that knows about
land issues," Beecham said of Mc-
Cown. "She has so much background
in land-use law and the principle of
land use, more than anyone I know."
While there are several land-use
conflicts between Stanford and Palo
Alto, McCown said she believes
there are also many common goals.
"There are so many ways in
which the University's vision and
goals are absolutely coincident
with the community," she told the
Stanford News Service. "We don't
talk about that enough."

Beecham was not quite as opti
mistic, acknowledging that there are
the University and city look at land
use with different time-frames.
"There are always town-gown is
sues," Beecham said. "The city
does more things in the moment.
One trail would go by the Dish, and
the city sees it just as open space.
Stanford has the perpetual trust
and knows that in the future it
might need to use that land for
something else."

In past years, Coe was heavily
involved in working with the
county on the University's Gener
al Use Permit and the expansion
of Sand Hill Road, which began in
April after more than seven years
of planning.
"We want to take advantage of
Jean's experience in order to work
more closely with the surrounding
counties and with Palo Alto on
transportation an housing," Hor
ton added.
