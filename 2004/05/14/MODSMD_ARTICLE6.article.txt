# ITSS tests IM for campus system
## 
### ANDREW GAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Instant messaging (IM) may
eventually become just as popular
in offices on campus as it is in dorms,
but a campus-wide system is more
than a year away. A recent ITSS
pilot study tested out a small IM
network, but any conclusions will
not be released for another month,
and implementation will take until
at least next June. According to the
ITSS study, IM technology might
become more popular than phones
and e-mail as a method of commu
nication on campus, but it is still
largely untested.
Project Manager Tom Cramer,
ITSS director of service engineering,
argued that it's important for the
University to pursue IM technology.
"The biggest reason for this pro
ject is that it is a potentially whole
new platform for real-time collabo
ration," he said. "IM is not only com
ing, it is already here. We need to
take a look at it from both an inte
gration and a security perspective."

The IM project was planned last
year and a pilot test ran from Janu
ary through March. Original plans
had then called fora campus-wide
system by September.
According to Cramer, however,
a release by September is unrealis
tic, but he said to expect some sort
of release by the end of the next aca
demic year.
The eventual product might re
sult in something as simple as aug
menting Stanford Who listings to in
clude users' IM addresses or as
complex as implementing a full

scale IM system.
"We may want to kind of pick
one carrier as the default Stanford
carrier," he said. "That way we
could get at least the bulk of people
on one network to facilitate com
munication. We may look at IM
gateways, which are programs that
allow for interface between the var
ious carriers."
The IM project was undertaken
to address the problem of multiple
instant message carriers such as

AOL, Yahoo!, MSN, Jabber and
ICO that do not interoperate with
each other or the University's ex
isting infrastructure. In order to
stay fully connected, some faculty
and students are forced to use mul
tiple carriers, according to the
ITSS Website.
The Web site also notes that IM
has the possibility to complement
e-mail and phones to enable com
munications between students and
between students and faculty.
The plans for IM are to include
file transfers, voice and video
streaming, collaborative surfing
and document editing. Not only a
chat feature, IM will be the first of
an integrated set of collaboration
tools for the campus.
Student reactions were mixed,
but most were optimistic about a

Stanford IM server.
"The collaboration from IM for
group projects would be great,"
said fifth-year senior Mike Taub
man. "Maybe if I had IM freshman
year, it wouldn't have taken me so
long to graduate."
Freshman Becca Sorenson said
she wished more people used the
same IM server.
"If Stanford had its own IM then
it would help for the international
students who tend to use something
other than AOL," she said. "I think
it is a good idea to let everyone be
able to talk to everyone else."
Cramer said that the features
that make IM so appealing will lead
to IM becoming a part of the future
of higher education.
"There is a lot of interest
among other universities; it's be
ginning to permeate higher edu
cation," Cramer said. "Other uni
versities are also looking at the
technology and Stanford is at
least keeping pace with them to
increase our offerings in technol
ogy collaboration."
