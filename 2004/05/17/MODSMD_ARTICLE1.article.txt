# Council approves Lee / Mefford rejection
## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Constitutional Council drafted a ruling
late last night stating that the Undergraduate Senate's
second refusal to certify last month's executive elec
tion was not unconstitutional, as a suit brought by se
nior Mikey Lee argued. The decision, the Council clar
ified, stemmed largely from the wording of the suit,
and not necessarily from any shortcomings in its mer
its. Next year's ASSU president and vice president are
still undecided, however, as the Council must finalize
its decision, the special-election results must be certi
fied and even more suits may yet be pending.
In the second Constitutional Council case in two
weeks, the Lee camp argued that the Senate's reason
for not certifying last month's executive election —
that the Senior Class presidents' endorsement of the
Lee/Mefford ticket was an abuse of power — was

unconstitutional because it continued to center
around the issue of freedom of speech and because
"abuse of power" was not clearly restricted in the
ASSU by-laws.
"Can the Senate make [an abuse of power law]
retroactively?" asked alumnus Henry Towsner,
who argued by phone for Lee, who was in Washing
ton, D.C. with junior Dylan Mefford fora confer
ence. "No — people will be afraid to use their
rights," he continued.
Towsner successfully brought a suit with Mefford
over a week ago, leading the Council to rule that the
Senate's original reason for not certifying the first elec
tion was unconstitutional because it violated free
speech rights guaranteed in the ASSU Constitution.
Sophomore Daniel Stringer and freshman Lauren
Graham, both senators, represented the Senate at
the meeting.
" [The e-mails to the Senior Class] represented a mis

use of University-granted privileges," Stringer argued.
In the end, however, the Council's decision focused
less on the Senate's argument and more on the short
comings of Lee's suit, with the Council concluding that
the written materials did not address the reasoning be
hind the Senate's decision.
"We don't agree with the points of his case, based
upon the case presented," said Constitutional Council
Chair Bill Curry, a doctoral candidate in geophysics.
"Other arguments may exist," he added, but stressed
that those could not be taken into consideration.
Some parties complained that the Senate filed its
written materials late yesterday afternoon, and the
Council convened at a time when both Lee and Mef
ford were out of town.
"We were accommodating to the late filing and the
Council's time constraints, and we're being screwed
over," Towsner said before the Council put the case to
a vote.

Council member Robert Rudnitsky, a doctoral can
didate in applied physics, also expressed reservations.
"If you're going to restrict free speech, you have to
do it as minimally as possible, and [the Senate's deci
sion] does not do this,"he said.
The Council meets again this Thursday to finalize
its ruling. If it does, the special-election results will
then be tallied.
"If the decision stands, the special-election results
will be put up for certification," said Senate Chair
Chris Lin, a junior.
However, Lin expressed doubt that the situation
has been completely resolved.
"I wouldn't be surprised if another case came up be
tween then and now," he added.
By the end of the meeting, few attendees
seemed optimistic about the current state of affairs
in the ASSU.
"This is a sign of a broken system," Curry said.
