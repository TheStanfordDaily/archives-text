Exotic Erotic: No other party
generates as much attention, as
many police officers or as many in
quiries beforehand of, "What are
you going to wear on Saturday?"
For one night, 680 Lomita be
comes the equivalent of the red car
pet for Oscars, where everyone
dresses — or rather, undresses —
to impress.
With the infamous unofficial
rule of "one article of clothing for
men, two articles of clothing for
women" in full effect, imagina
tions were stretched as all
searched high and low for the per
fect outfit to show off their goods
on Saturday night.
While it seemed as though many
men dressed by facing the "diffi
cult" decision of boxers or briefs,
the women's outfits seemed to be
more elaborate and planned out.
"The girls did a better job with
their costumes; most of the guys went
in board shorts," said sophomore
Stephanie Tsai. "They just rolled
up in whatever was lying around
in their room."
She added, "1 do think it's amaz
ing what superglue can do."
However, there were some no
table exceptions in the men's catego
ry for creativity, including Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles, a Peter Pan
and fake police officers. Normal ev

eryday objects like kitchen aprons
and Corona boxes became chief arti
cles of clothing.
Many men chose to strategical
ly cover one particular part of their
body with stuffed animals — per
haps symbolizing their "personali
ties." Spotted at Exotic Erotic
were a stuffed monkey and a
stuffed tiger.
Sophomore Grissel Ramirez
cited a sophomore wearing only a
trombone as her favorite outfit in
terms of its creativity.
"I thought people were more
creative than last year," Ramirez
said. "You saw more themed cos
tumes instead of the purely
provocative ones."
On the female side of fashion,
Victoria's Secret investors would
have been excited (in various ways)
to see many women (and a few
men) sporting lingerie, underwear,
thongs, corsets and practically ev
erything else the store carries.
Another item of choice that is al
ways popular from year to year was
the bikini, chosen by many for its
hassle-free — yet still alluring —
quality. And of course, there were
girls clad in miniskirts about as
short as the duration of the party.
Some outfits left lasting impres
sions. One of the most mentioned
outfits was worn by senior Courtney
Brigham, who is also a Daily colum
nist. She donned a Britney Spears
outfit from the music video "Toxic."

Brigham had silver rhinestones all
over her body, with a condensed
number around the chest area.
"That one girl that wore the
Britney Spears thing, all silvery
beads," said sophomore Kevin
Gao. "Very hot."
Some women decided to go
thrifty, raiding construction sites
and crime scenes for caution tape to
wear to the party. The tape proved
to be quite versatile, as it was seen
in the skirt, underwear and bra/
bikini form.
Some articles of clothing were
found on both men and women,
such as the thong. Body paint re
mained a popular "clothing" of
choice, as well.
Many people also dressed up as
security guards and police officers,
complete with walkie talkies,
badges and handguns. Oh wait,
those weren't costumes.
Sadly, many outfits did not
even make it inside the party, as
Exotic Erotic was shut down be
fore midnight, leaving hundreds of
people stranded outside wearing
next to nothing. Even more unfor
tunately, for those who were un
able to make it to the party, this
year's Exotic Erotic was not
filmed by the police.
It remains to be seen whether
this beloved Stanford tradition — a
bastion for those into the sport of
checking out people's outfits —
will continue next year.

Students donned a variety of styles at this year's Exotic Erotic party, held last Saturday. Paint was a common cover-up (upper right), while bikinis were the articles of choice for
many women (above). Seniors Katy Jackman and Courtney Brigham (middle) wore lingerie and Britney Spears-esque rhinestones. Seniors Anna Galan and Kristin Durst (lower

make a political statement.
