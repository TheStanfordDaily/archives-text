## Spring Thing needs work 
### 
Attendance was modest. The mood was
low-key. The sound, for whatever reason,
was dreadful. Saturday's Spring Thing, a
project of the ASSU's Absolute Fun pro
gram in conjunction with several other student
groups, wasn't exactly an earth-shattering success.
But it wasn't too had fora first try, and with strong
planning and publicity it could eventually grow to be
come a beloved Stanford tradition.
Highlighted by bouncy castles, free food, a three
on-three basketball tournament and a concert by rock
group Eve 6, Spring Thing drew several hundred stu
dents to Wilbur Field over the course of the afternoon.
It's probably safe to say that few were blown away by
the activities, and Spring Thing seemed to rate a dis
tant second to Exotic Erotic in terms of the amount of
excitement the function generated across campus.
This may haye been because Spring Thing is a new
event, or because it sounded too cheesy, or because
Eve 6 was an uninspiring choice as a headlining act.
In reality, no band could have played a very good
show given the technical limitations of the Wilbur Field

setup â€” the sound quality from the speakers was ap
palling, as the band noted in a break between songs.
But that didn't stop a hardcore group of a few dozen
students from jumping up and down throughout the en
tire set. and a large contingent of more laid-back listen
ers seemed to enjoy the chance to take in a live show
while lying on beach towels in the sun.
The combination of amusement-park games and
bouncy castles in a non-alcoholic setting probably un
dermined any ambitions the organizers had of staging
a really "cool" college party. Many of the activities
would probably have been better received by elemen
tary school kids than by Stanford students.
Still, the number of people who showed up just to
check out the proceedings is evidence that there is a de
mand on campus for such events. We hope that Spring
Thing becomes an annual affair, and that in the future
organizers find ways to imbue it with the unique irrev
erent spirit of other Stanford traditions like Secret
Snowflake and Full Moon on the Quad. If this hap
pens. Spring Thing could turn out to be a worthy addi
tion to the pantheon of annual all-campus parties.
