# Exotic deserves more support

It is a cruel aspect of Stanford undergraduate life
that one of the best parties on campus. Exotic
Erotic, also tends to be one of the most problem
atic. Unfortunately, this year was no exception.
On the bright side, the administration does not appear
to be seriously considering shutting down this revered
institution, at least judging from comments by Associate
Director of Student Activities Joey Greenwell and
Dean of Students Greg Boardman. In fact, these two of
ficials seem to be committed to working toward making
the event run more smoothly next year.
There were several factors that contributed to the
breakdown in Saturday's party, though it is hard to pin
point a single definitive cause. According to 680 house
manager Jeff Mancuso, t he attendance at this year's Ex
otic Erotic was the highest ever. Some may feel that the

something to do with this "overhype." Perhaps if there
were more parties on par with Exotic Erotic in terms of

That said, this year's Exotic was a lot of fun up until
its premature end. It was a good release of post
midterms / pre-finals stress and showed that Stanford
can throw a truly wild party. We just wish such events
weren't so rare and so difficult to carry out.
Next year, it might be a good idea to have other
parties on the night of Exotic Erotic for those who
can't get in. Better yet, we like the proposal to hold
the party at a larger and more secure location to min
imize overcrowding.
By expressing a desire to keep Exotic Erotic alive and
even strengthen it, the Dean of Students Office and Of
fice of Student Activities are demonstrating that they un
derstand the relationship between a vibrant campus
party scene and students' overall quality of life. We are
pleased that both students and administrators seem to be
trying to learn from this year's logistical problems and
work together to throw a fun and safe party next year.
