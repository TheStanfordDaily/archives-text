# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## Still waiting at 680 Lomita 
### 
I'd like to tell you how awesome
Exotic Erotic was this weekend.
I'd like to offer my usual snide
comments mixed with ludicrous
suggestions. Unfortunately I can't, be
cause I am currently still in line.
But from what I've seen, it looks
pretty awesome. Everyone seems to
be dressed really scantily and have
that same "sex starved" look on their
faces. If their badges weren't so visible.
I'd swear they were students here.
I'm kidding of course. From what
I've heard, the cops were not as
sketchy this year as last year. Last year,
of course, everyone thought it was
strange that the official police footage
ended up on "Girls Gone Wild.''
I guess I can't completely blame the
cops. The costumes are part of what
makes Exotic Erotic so awesome. I
mean, some people really go all out.
I've seen guys wearing thongs, a girl
wearing nothing but leaves, and then
about 2 million awkward freshman
guys in their boxers. Judging by how
pensive they are, it's hard to tell
whether they are about to go to a party
or see the proctologist.
I really can't wait to get into the
party. I've seen the people who are ex
iting, and they look, like, really happy.
They're hugging and smiling and
wearing their hearts on their sleeve.

And, well, not much else. Caution tape
too, I guess.
I can almost see the front of the

line now. They are
asking for SUIDs.
Luckily, mine is
taped to my ass.
I'm hoping that
won't count as my
one article of
clothing.
I guess I've re
signed myself to
wait here fora
while. My mind

wanders, and I think to myself, "You
know what, this line isn't so bad."
Sure, I'm in the back of the line, but ev
eryone's on a level playing field here.
Those three freshman girls who got
0001? Yeah, they're in the back. That
Cal student who wrote a letter to the
editor about The Daily calling them
"girls?" He's at home masturbating to
images of "women."
See, at Exotic Erotic, you have to
swallow your pride, choke on the
rinds. Otherwise you'll find faith in
nothing, and you'll want to put your
tender in a blender. Or maybe that's
just Eve 6. They are around here
someplace too. They are hoping that
they can muster a bit more stage pres
ence here than they did at Spring

Thing. I'm pretty sure they didn't write
"Here's to The Night" while attending
a party like this. That would be an in
sult to a party like this.
What makes this party so special?
Is it the lack of clothing? No, you could
see nudity at any co-op party. Is it the
alcohol? That can't be it â€” you can
get that at any freshman dorm. There
has to be something more. Why else
would hundreds of people, already
inebriated and dressed in next to noth
ing, be waiting outside to get in, where
they will just be equally cramped and
inebriated and still be wearing next to
nothing? "I'm sure it's the friendly at
mosphere," I think to myself as I shove
the person in front of me.
Well, enough swallowing my pride.
No woman will tie me to the bedpost
tonight, 'cause I'm still in line. I feel
like Oliver Twist, patiently waiting in
line for some gruel. Except instead of
gruel, I want ass.
And instead of some beefy orphan
curator saying, "More?! You greedy
little...if I came back to the girl and
asked for "more," I'm pretty sure she'd
reply "Not now, honey, I'm tired."

Chris just realized they shut down
the party at midnight. Nobody told
him. E-mail your disbelief to
ch olt@stanford. edu.
