# OP-ED
## ASSU is trying to do the right thing 
### LINDSAY LOVE &. JOSHSHIPP 
The public image of the ASSU has
probably never been worse than it is
now. Frankly, we think this is under
standable. Accusations of partiality in
the election certification, questions of
the ASSU's efficacy and relevance to
student life and allegations of self
righteousness all undermine the rela
tionship of the ASSU with the student
body. Looking forward, however, we
are confident that the ASSU can re
pair the damage and have a produc
tive year, with whomever the execu
tive turns out to be.
The student body as a whole, it
seems, doesn't think the ASSU mat
ters. A great deal of this frustration
stems from the election. The Under
graduate Senate has spent half a quar
ter arguing over the results of the ex
ecutive election. This arguing, while it
may seem petty, is in fact representa
tive of the Senate's concerns.
The executive election was com
promised, although blame cannot be
assigned for the lack of integrity
throughout the election. The Senate,
in not certifying the results, has recog
nized this problem and is seeking to re
store accountability and honesty to
the election process and to the associ
ation as a whole.
Despite an appearance of bias, both

the sth and 6th Undergraduate Sen
ates have done their best to rectify the
situation without discrimination. The
decision not to certify the election was
based on the lack of fairness, not on the
outcome of the first executive race.
As for the larger concerns of the
ASSU's role in student life, we do
what we can. The Undergraduate Sen
ate distributes over $300,000 to stu
dent groups each year; the executive
branch and the Senate both work on
long-term advocacy projects to better
student life; and this year, the ASSU
began to provide programming for the
entire student body, through Absolute
Fun and Senate Tailgates.
We do not claim to be in touch
with the needs of every student on
campus, but we try — and we encour
age students to be in touch with us, if
they feel the need. While imperfect,
the ASSU does serve as the student
body's representative voice to the
University administration.
Every year we try harder and make
more progress in bringing the ASSU to
the students. We have faith that the 6th
Undergraduate Senate and the new ex
ecutive will strive to further that goal.
The Undergraduate Senate has
now spent five weeks discussing the ex
ecutive election. Many students think
this is a sign of self-importance: If the
ASSU doesn't really matter to them,
there's no possible way this can be that

important, except to the ASSU itself.
However, the ASSU does matter,
just not as visibly as students might
like. The ASSU is important to us —
that's why we spent a year working in
it, and we hope to help students also
deem it important.
In order to better connect the
ASSU with the student body, a level of
integrity must be established and
maintained. For this reason, the Un
dergraduate Senate has held the ut
most concern for the manner in which
the initial elections were conducted.
The preoccupation with certification
is for the association's benefit, not for
the egos of individual senators.
While the process has been
painfully drawn out, and is even some
what amusing, we do have the best in
terest of the students and the ASSU at
heart. As we have done our best to up
hold the Constitution and the ASSU's
credibility, and as the 6th Undergrad
uate Senate does the same now, we
ask you, the students, to understand
our dilemma and have the confidence
and patience in your elected officials
to do the right thing.
