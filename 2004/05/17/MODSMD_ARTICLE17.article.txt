## Profs work in Chile wasn't benign 
### KELLY WELLS 
Last Friday, Economics Prof. John
Pencavel wrote to The Daily justifying
his role in Pinochet's Chile, which he
portrayed as minor and pro-union.
Pencavel, now a member of Stanford's
advisory committee on labor prac
tices, stated that his purpose was "to
help restore collective bargaining." 1
am of the opinion that any coopera
tion with a dictatorship is antidemo
cratic and immoral, as it helps to legit
imize that government's rule.
Some historical context may be
useful in understanding Pencavel's
true impact on politics and collective
bargaining in Chile. In 1978, five years
after the military coup against demo
cratically elected President Salvador
Allende General Augusto Pinochet
dissolved the governing military junta,
installed himself as the official head of
state and began institutionalizing his
rule through a massive restructuring of
the government.
Labor had already begun re-mobi
lizing in key industries and was a major
potential opponent to the dictatorship
and its new (neoliberal) economic poli
cies. At the same time, Chile was under
increasing pressure from human rights
groups, international labor organiza
tions and the U.S. government to re
spond to reports of abuses and repres
sion of organized labor. Thus, the deci
sion to recognize unions — on the most

favorable terms possible — was essen
tial both to Pinochet's efforts in consol
idating his regime domestically, and to
placating international pressure. It had
nothing to do with a desire to institu
tionalize a strong voice for workers.
In fact, the Labor Code of 1979,
which Pencavel considers a "success,"
reduced unions to little more than mu
tual aid societies. The right to strike
was reinstated, but only for wage de
mands, not for such key issues as job
security, health, safety, maternity
leave or social security. Furthermore,
strikes were limited to 60 days, and
even after they were settled, workers
could be fired for having participated
in them.
Scabs and employer lockouts were
also legalized, and the government
maintained the right to prohibit any
strike for reasons of "national securi
ty." Picketing and public meetings re
mained illegal, as did cross-union and
industry-wide support, which had
been essential in the case of the Farm
Workers' Union.
Little wonder that Chilean workers
immediately dubbed the new policy
"the bosses' code." The period imme
diately following the application of the
Labor Code was marked by unsuc
cessful strikes, wherein workers were
forced back on the job just under the
60-day limit with their demands still
unaddressed. Leaders and strike par
ticipants were often laid off en masse.

Is this what Pencavel believes is "a
considerable amount of freedom ...
to bargain with firms"?
While it is unclear how much of this
policy was in keeping with Pencavel's
recommendations, the Chilean Labor
Code of 1979 is largely consistent with
his Brookings Institution report,
which advocates an extremely restrict
ed role for unions, generally viewing
them as a stumbling block to market
liberalization and "progress." It's pret
ty clear that Pencavel's work in Chile
was decidedly not pro-union. Even
worse, this superficial recognition of
unions eased international pressures,
helping to avert boycotts and en
trenching Pinochet's rule.
Yes, Mr. Pencavel, I do find that
"problematic."
1 find it pretty embarrassing that
our world-class university — which
operates a campus in Santiago —
seems to take no issue with this. But
that Pencavel sits on the very commit
tee that is supposed to be researching
and drafting a more equitable Univer
sity labor code is utterly outrageous. It
exemplifies the lack of seriousness
with which the administration regards
labor issues, and the superficiality of
the committee itself.
