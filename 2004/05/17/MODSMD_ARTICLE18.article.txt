Pro fro's op-ed reinforces
Stanford's good points
As counterintuitive as it may seem,
reading Sarah Ball's recent Washing
ton Post submission left me with a
deeper sense of satisfaction and un
derstanding of my school than I had
before. Like most of my classmates, I
initially felt infuriated after the first
read and appalled that anyone could
be vindictive enough to submit such a
response to a national newspaper.
However, after numerous conversa
tions with other Stanford students, I
realized that her letter shed some light
on the attributes that separate Stan
ford from its academic counterparts
and a status as just another intellectu
al powerhouse.
Personally, I didn't choose to at
tend Stanford for the academics. To
be perfectly honest, the benefits of re
ceiving an education at any of the top
tier universities in this country are
about equal: Schools such as Stanford,
Harvard, Yale and Duke offer rough
ly similar opportunities for any intel
lectual to thrive. After attending my
own Admit Weekend, the vivacity of
Stanford life that 1 saw as a prospec
tive freshman made a deep impres
sion on me and profoundly impacted
my decision to enroll.
Only at Stanford did I find a rowdy

student band that never failed to en
tertain, a spirited sea of red and white
at the infamous Big Game against
Berkeley and students who could
excel in both quantum mechanics and
the art of fountain-hopping. Here, I
found the saying, "work hard, play
hard" to be more than merely an old
adage — it was a way of life.
The same enthusiasm that discour
aged Sarah Ball from choosing Stan
ford convinced me that this was the
only place I wanted to be for the next
four years. However, 1 can never
truthfully say that Stanford is the right
place for everyone. It has earned its
place among many of the most distin
guished American universities while
maintaining a uniquely enthusiastic
and lively atmosphere, which will real
istically appeal to some students and
not to others.
Rather than escalate my initial ag
gravation, Ball's disparaging com
ments about the exuberance of Stan
ford students eventually resulted in a
heightened appreciated of my school.
I would rather be a member of a stu
dent body that is critiqued for over
enthusiasm than for disappointing ap
athy, and 1 am proud to be part of this
year's group of House Hosts, whose
only mistake was to unabashedly dis
play genuine fondness of Stanford.
This is a college with true personal

ity, and like most people with person
alities, it appeals best to those with
similar or complementary personali
ties. If anything. Ball's letter has only
reflected Stanford's success in being a
school with character and zest, and
most importantly, a university that is
beloved by its students.

Article mistakenly omitted
map project's co-director
I am writing regarding your article
in Wednesday's paper, "Interdisci
plinary project pieces together third
century Roman map," by Melissa
Fusco. I am co-director of this project.
However, as the title of the article stat
ed, this is very much an interdisci
plinary project. I am therefore disap
pointed and embarrassed that my co
director, Prof. Jennifer Trimble of the
Classics Department, was not men
tioned in the article.
This omission is especially glaring
because in response to a number of ar
chaeological questions by the reporter,
I pleaded with her to contact Prof.
Trimble for the answers. Apparently,
nobody contacted her. For our "home
town" newspaper. The Daily should do
better. By the way. David Roller is not

a "designer". He is a doctoral student
in computer science.

Daily editorials should focus on
global issues
More and more I am angered by
The Daily's devotion to sundry trivial
ities. Perhaps this newspaper must
chat about parties, disappointed
prospective freshmen and the ASSU.
Please, though, do not make such
matters the soul of the editorial space.
We can consider more urgent
things. As I write, 110,000 black Su
danese have fled to Chad in response
to a government-organized ethnic
cleansing. In western Sudan, villages
have been destroyed, women have
been gang-raped and children have
been executed. Anyone who wants to
know fully the extent of these gross
human rights violations can visit the
Web sites of the United Nations,
Amnesty International and Human
Rights Watch.
It is not too much to ask for editors
whose first project is a project of social
conscience. For I am still too ignorant to
see injustice for what it is. And this is be
cause our national newspapers are too
ignorant to see injustice for what it is.

In times like these, your editorial
opportunity to inform becomes an
outright duty to avoid the assiduous
decoration of trash.

Editor's note: As the only source of
campus-specific daily news, The Daily
aims to be a community newspaper
and a student newspaper rather than a
national newspaper. The Daily's edito
rial board focuses on issues that pertain
particularly to campus life so that its
readers can be informed citizens of the
Stanford community.
Multiculturalism is not under
attack at Stanford
Timmy Lu does a commendable
job of showing that Sarah Ball is real
ly only concerned about "diversity in
her own terms, her own space" (",
5/14). However, he should have
stopped there.
Instead, Lu decided to push his
own agenda, spuriously linking Ball's
op-ed in the Washington Post to issues
like "the attacks on MEChA and
Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion earlier this year, The Stanford
Review's revival of the Stanford Indi
an, the refusal to put Masque on the

special-fees ballot by the exiting
ASSU Senate, MEChA's loss of spe
cial fees, racist and nativist demands
for TAs with accents to stop teaching
and the perennial attacks on ethnic
theme dorms and six community cen
ters." Lu argues that these issues point
to a general attack on mulitcultural
ism and diversity at Stanford.
Playing the race card and coming
off with some sense of credibility is way
too easy these days. Pick some issues
that have to do with race, plop them to
gether, and now you have a fictitious
trend of "attacking multiculturalism
and diversity." I don't know what hap
pened with the SAIO, but the attack on
MEChA only caused their loss of spe
cial fees because they couldn't ade
quately refute the charges.
Requesting for TAs to be able to
speak the language of their students
is neither racist nor nativist — it's
common sense. Not putting Masque
on the ballot for special fees? Well,
who actually reads Masque? Yeah,
there are perennial attacks on ethnic
theme dorms and the six community
centers, but that's how it's pretty
much always been, and isn't reflec
tive of any sort of growing trend to
wards attacking diversity.
