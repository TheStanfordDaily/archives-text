## Analyzing NCAA gambling study 
### 
An NCAA gambling study released last week showed
that 63.4 percent of its male athletes and 41.7 per
cent of its female athletes had engaged in gambling
during the last year. That, in and of itself, sounds
pretty good, given the preponderance of March Madness pools,
state lotteries, casinos and card games across America. But,
much has been made of the fact that 1.1 percent of football play
ers and 0.5 percent of mens basketball players reported taking
money for playing poorly in a game.
While digesting this information, I immediately wondered
how meaningful these alleged facts were — and how accurate
they are. So I went to ncaa.org and took a look at the survey,
which was completed by a whopping 20,739 NCAA athletes.
Clearly, sample size was not going to be an issue.
The survey itself is exhaustive and very specific, asking every
conceivable combination of questions — did you ever take
money, did a friend or teammate ever take money, etc. — lead
ing me to believe several things.
Firstly, this was a well-done survey, and the NCAA deserves
kudos for administering it and releasing the results.
Well, sort of— the NCAA was pretty selective in what in
formation it chose to release, which is a little curious.

Regardless, though, we know how many
football and men's hoops players say they
took money directly for altering their per
formance and a few other fun facts.
So, how should the college sports fan
respond? Or, more personally, how
should I respond?
Firstly, let me say that I don't care if
anyone other than a basketball player en
ters a March Madness pool or if any ath
lete wants to play cards, bet on profes
sional sports, or otherwise engage in typi
cal American behavior.

1 realize that some will say that gambling of any sort could
lead to gambling debts and, eventually, a higher temptation to
throw a game. This is marginally true, but at the same time, for
most of the athlete population, betting five bucks on a card
game or a March Madness pool is just a harmless exercise, so I
don't think anyone should be scared by the large percentages
the study found concerning gambling in general.
Everyone's concern, of course, should be on those who take
the now-tremendous step toward trying to throw a game. I think
the NCAA does a pretty good job of discouraging this behavior
— to the point that one wonders if a much better job could even
be done, at least based on the limited statistics released last
week and found in past studies — but there were nonetheless a
small number of football and men's basketball players who said
they had altered their performance for payment.
The question facing sports fans is, how outraged should we
be? The knee-jerk reaction is, of course, very.
How dare an athlete tarnish a game, even the sport as a
whole, by making a farce of the competition down on the
field, right ?
Well, I agree — playing less than your best on purpose is
not a respectable thing to do. But athletes underperform for
reasons other than money — so does this mitigate the guilt of
the point-shaver?
We've all seen athletes play lazily now and then. Maybe
they're hurt and aren't exactly happy to be on the field; maybe
they're unhappy with their team's play or their playing time;
maybe they're distracted by off-the-field issues; maybe they
know it doesn't matter because they're winning or losing by a
big margin; maybe they just don't care that much.
And, we can all criticize such behavior — but only to a point.
Whether you're a varsity athlete, a former high-school star,
or just a weekend warrior, I know you can recall an instance
where you didn't dive for that ball or you let yourself fade to
ward the end of the contest. To use some less direct examples, I
know you can recall a time you got frustrated on a test and hand
ed it in before time was up, knowing some of it was wrong. I can,
you can, we all can. How about the guy who takes personal calls
at work; can he really be morally superior to the athlete who
doesn't fight through that screen or make that slide tackle?
There's not a man or woman alive who can or does bring 100
percent every day, regardless of their occupation.
So, then, is consciously playing poorly really more accept
able if it's done for personal reasons rather than monetary
ones? I believe so, because throwing a game takes a conscious
effort. Half-assing it from time to time is in a sense innate, and
everyone is guilty of it to some extent; going into operation shut
down requires a deliberate effort (or lack thereof), and very few
are guilty of it.
The exchange of money eliminates the gray area. It's no
longer unclear whether that halfhearted play was just the lazy
mistake of an athlete upset about a lopsided score or a person
al problem or whether the athlete was intentionally dogging it.
Once the money's in the pocket, it's absolutely certain — to the
omniscient observer, at least — why the player is dogging it.
It's also worth noting that even the competitor who's dog
ging it for personal reasons still retains his or her pride as an ath
lete in general (just ask Kobe Bryant, who sandwiched 33- and
45-point gems around an insipid, eight-point "Who's a ball-hog
now?" game on April 11). But once you take money for it, you
lose that pride, and your game is almost assuredly going to be
more egregiously sub-par than that of the athlete who's just
dogging it a little bit. Kobe still played good defense even as he
sabotaged the Lakers' offense; the point-shaver is apt to screw
up every aspect of the game as best he can without being too
conspicuous. There is a big, game-changing difference between
not fighting through a screen because you're tired and inten
tionally losing your man to give him open shots.
Honest athletes are most likely to give less than their best
in the closing minutes of blowouts or essentially meaningless
times; dishonest athletes are most likely to play at less than
their best in tight games or other times when it matters the
most — a distinction that makes all the difference in the
world. Fundamentally, honest athletes play to win; dishonest
ones play to lose.
In the end, the NCAA study is interesting and useful, but it
isn't groundbreaking. All in all, the numbers are pretty impres
sive. Sure, the hundred-dollar handshake lives on, and the
NCAA continues to be rocked by various recruiting and im
proper academic assistance scandals, but if nothing else, college
sports' governing body has done a solid job of dissuading its
players from tanking games for money. One could discuss off
the-field issues at Colorado, Baylor, St. John's and a host of
other schools all day long but, if nothing else, fans, athletes and
administrators alike can take heart in the fact that such scandal
so rarely makes it onto the field of play.

everyone is guilty of it to some extent; going into operation shut
down requires a deliberate effort (or lack thereof), and very few
are guilty of it.
The exchange of money eliminates the gray area. It's no
longer unclear whether that halfhearted play was just the lazy
mistake of an athlete upset about a lopsided score or a person
al problem or whether the athlete was intentionally dogging it.
Once the money's in the pocket, it's absolutely certain — to the
omniscient observer, at least — why the player is dogging it.
It's also worth noting that even the competitor who's dog
ging it for personal reasons still retains his or her pride as an ath
lete in general (just ask Kobe Bryant, who sandwiched 33- and
45-point gems around an insipid, eight-point "Who's a ball-hog
now?" game on April 11). But once you take money for it, you
lose that pride, and your game is almost assuredly going to be
more egregiously sub-par than that of the athlete who's just
dogging it a little bit. Kobe still played good defense even as he
sabotaged the Lakers' offense; the point-shaver is apt to screw
up every aspect of the game as best he can without being too
conspicuous. There is a big, game-changing difference between
not fighting through a screen because you're tired and inten
tionally losing your man to give him open shots.
Honest athletes are most likely to give less than their best
in the closing minutes of blowouts or essentially meaningless
times; dishonest athletes are most likely to play at less than
their best in tight games or other times when it matters the
most — a distinction that makes all the difference in the
world. Fundamentally, honest athletes play to win; dishonest
ones play to lose.
In the end, the NCAA study is interesting and useful, but it
isn't groundbreaking. All in all, the numbers are pretty impres
sive. Sure, the hundred-dollar handshake lives on, and the
NCAA continues to be rocked by various recruiting and im
proper academic assistance scandals, but if nothing else, college
sports' governing body has done a solid job of dissuading its
players from tanking games for money. One could discuss off
the-field issues at Colorado, Baylor, St. John's and a host of
other schools all day long but, if nothing else, fans, athletes and
administrators alike can take heart in the fact that such scandal
so rarely makes it onto the field of play.

An NCAA gambling study released last week showed
that 63.4 percent of its male athletes and 41.7 per
cent of its female athletes had engaged in gambling
during the last year. That, in and of itself, sounds
pretty good, given the preponderance of March Madness pools,
state lotteries, casinos and card games across America. But,
much has been made of the fact that 1.1 percent of football play
ers and 0.5 percent of mens basketball players reported taking
money for playing poorly in a game.
While digesting this information, I immediately wondered
how meaningful these alleged facts were — and how accurate
they are. So I went to ncaa.org and took a look at the survey,
which was completed by a whopping 20,739 NCAA athletes.
Clearly, sample size was not going to be an issue.
The survey itself is exhaustive and very specific, asking every
conceivable combination of questions — did you ever take
money, did a friend or teammate ever take money, etc. — lead
ing me to believe several things.
Firstly, this was a well-done survey, and the NCAA deserves
kudos for administering it and releasing the results.
Well, sort of— the NCAA was pretty selective in what in
formation it chose to release, which is a little curious.

Regardless, though, we know how many
football and men's hoops players say they
took money directly for altering their per
formance and a few other fun facts.
So, how should the college sports fan
respond? Or, more personally, how
should I respond?
Firstly, let me say that I don't care if
anyone other than a basketball player en
ters a March Madness pool or if any ath
lete wants to play cards, bet on profes
sional sports, or otherwise engage in typi
cal American behavior.

1 realize that some will say that gambling of any sort could
lead to gambling debts and, eventually, a higher temptation to
throw a game. This is marginally true, but at the same time, for
most of the athlete population, betting five bucks on a card
game or a March Madness pool is just a harmless exercise, so I
don't think anyone should be scared by the large percentages
the study found concerning gambling in general.
Everyone's concern, of course, should be on those who take
the now-tremendous step toward trying to throw a game. I think
the NCAA does a pretty good job of discouraging this behavior
— to the point that one wonders if a much better job could even
be done, at least based on the limited statistics released last
week and found in past studies — but there were nonetheless a
small number of football and men's basketball players who said
they had altered their performance for payment.
The question facing sports fans is, how outraged should we
be? The knee-jerk reaction is, of course, very.
How dare an athlete tarnish a game, even the sport as a
whole, by making a farce of the competition down on the
field, right ?
Well, I agree — playing less than your best on purpose is
not a respectable thing to do. But athletes underperform for
reasons other than money — so does this mitigate the guilt of
the point-shaver?
We've all seen athletes play lazily now and then. Maybe
they're hurt and aren't exactly happy to be on the field; maybe
they're unhappy with their team's play or their playing time;
maybe they're distracted by off-the-field issues; maybe they
know it doesn't matter because they're winning or losing by a
big margin; maybe they just don't care that much.
And, we can all criticize such behavior — but only to a point.
Whether you're a varsity athlete, a former high-school star,
or just a weekend warrior, I know you can recall an instance
where you didn't dive for that ball or you let yourself fade to
ward the end of the contest. To use some less direct examples, I
know you can recall a time you got frustrated on a test and hand
ed it in before time was up, knowing some of it was wrong. I can,
you can, we all can. How about the guy who takes personal calls
at work; can he really be morally superior to the athlete who
doesn't fight through that screen or make that slide tackle?
There's not a man or woman alive who can or does bring 100
percent every day, regardless of their occupation.
So, then, is consciously playing poorly really more accept
able if it's done for personal reasons rather than monetary
ones? I believe so, because throwing a game takes a conscious
effort. Half-assing it from time to time is in a sense innate, and
everyone is guilty of it to some extent; going into operation shut
down requires a deliberate effort (or lack thereof), and very few
are guilty of it.
