# Erotic stampede overtakes 680
## Fence break ends Exotic early 
### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
The "mob mentality" of the Exotic Erotic crowd was simply
too much to handle. University officials said yesterday to ex
plain the party's premature closure. Despite careful party-plan
ning by the 680 Lomita staff and University administrators,
guests were able to break in through the back of the house, cre
ating a "breach of security," and Exotic Erotic was shut down
at approximately 12 a.m. — an hour earlier than expected.
While Associate Director of Student Activities Joey
Greenwell lauded the house staffs efforts and cooperation
with the University, he said the decision to shut down Stan
ford's infamous annual party resulted from"a select group
of guests who were disrespectful to the party hosts."
Although staff members were having problems for most of
the night with guests pushing and shoving to enter the party,
they decided to act when a group of students broke through a 7-
to-8-foot chain-link fence to enter the party through the back.
According to 680 House Manager Jeff Mancuso, a se
nior, one of the bullets of the rented fence came loose,
causing the fence to fall apart because it had not been as
sembled properly. While security guards initially tried to
hold up the fence, they could not control the large numbers
of students who were attempting to get in.
Coupled with the large crowd of students waiting in
line, the broken fence prompted Manusco to tell Green
well and other security guards and staff members, "We
need to shut down this party."
Mancuso described the people waiting to enter as a
"sea of humanity."
"There were far, far too many people," Mancuso said. "The
party was over-hyped; there were more people [here on Satur
day] than had ever come to Exotic Erotic before."
He estimated that there were 700 to 800 people in line at
10 p.m. — the time the doors opened after the house was ini
tially evacuated. The staff stopped letting people in around
10:45 p.m., as the 1,000-guest capacity had already been
reached. They later made an announcement telling people
to disperse because the party was full and they weren't sure
how many more people they could accommodate.
After getting additional support from the Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safety, who barricaded the entrance area,
Greenwell said he was confident of the staffs ability to control

the crowds. But the party had to be shut down when people
started entering from the back.
"There were just too many people going through,"
Greenwell said. "It wasn't possible to put the gates back up.
Students weren't willing to work with us."
Other party problems included a defective circuit break
er that caused the outside lights to go out at about 11:50 p.m.
There were no lights for the bar and the floodlights also
went out. The band had no power for half the night. The
staff was able to fix this problem intermittently.
In spite of the unfortunate ending to this year's Exot
ic Erotic, Greenwell said he was hopeful about bringing
the party back next year.
"It's my hope that Exotic Erotic will continue," he said.
"We tried really hard to keep it going and I was disappoint
ed [that it ended early]. I could see the disappointment on
students' faces. Some people were really creative with the
costumes — I was really impressed."
He added, "But the entrance situation needs to be resolved
[for the next Exotic Erotic]."
Mancuso said two solutions discussed were having the party in
a larger and more secure location, most likely hosted by another
group or — the solution he found more promising — to make
sure that there are alternative parties going on at the same time.
"There were no other parties going on [on Saturday],
so people got trashed, got naked and they weren't about
to leave," Mancuso said.
Dean of Students Greg Boardman explained that the first
step to prepare for next year will be a series of meetings with
Residential Education, the Police Department, the Office of
Student Activities, the 680 party planners and other students.
"We need to determine what exactly occurred, the pros and
cons of continuing, additional provisions that could be put in
place and the problems that led to the party being shut down,"
Boardman said. "If the problems can be rectified, we will go for
ward. There is strong sentiment for the party to continue."
Despite police intervention. Police Department officials re
ported only four party-related arrests, with three arrests made
for drunkeness in public and one arrest made for resistance to
arrest. There were no paramedic requests related to the party.
Greenwell emphasized that the party's premature end
was due mainly to certain impatient students who felt enti
tled to get into the party, creating a difficult and uncom
fortable atmosphere for the planners and guests.
