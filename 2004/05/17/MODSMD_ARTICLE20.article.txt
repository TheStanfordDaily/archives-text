# Men lose 19-18 to Arizona
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford bullpen had a game to forget last night
in Tucson.
Maybe forget isn't a strong enough word.
Maybe it's more like an erase-permanently-from
any-part-of-the-brain type of thing.
That horrific showing wasted a career night for Jed
Lowrie. The senior second baseman and legitimate All-
American candidate had a career-high six hits (6-for-6)
and 5 RBIs in a losing cause for Stanford. He had a ninth
inning grand slam that put his team ahead momentarily,
17-15.
"Obviously, this was a tough loss," Lowrie said. "We
just have to come back and refocus, put this one behind
us and concentrate on getting a win [today]."
Stanford (38-9, 12-5 Pacific-10 Conference), which
won 11 -9 in Saturday's series-opening contest, fell to 2-5
in one-run games.
The exclamation point for the night came with closer
David O'Hagan's woeful ninth inning line: seven batters,
four runs, four hits, two walks, one hit batsmen, one
blown save, one loss, and no outs recorded.
The Stanford stopper had thrown 50-plus pitches a
day earlier, and perhaps his arm wasn't rested enough to
give another all-out performance.
O'Hagan gave up a three-run double to Arizona
catcher Richard Mercado before loading the bases and
giving up a game-ending walk to Wildcats leadoff man
John Hardy that scored pinch-runner Terrence Taylor
from third.
O'Hagan (5-1) was so upset with the 3-2 call by home
plate umpire Kendall Snyder that he promptly flung his
glove into the stands.
And with the glove went any chance of Stanford putting
any distance between itself and second-place Washington.
The Huskies (14-7) lost 10-8 in Los Angeles to Southern
California as national player of the week and Washington
ace Tim Lincecum was roughed up for nine runs and nine
hits in seven innings. Stanford remains only percentage
points ahead in the conference standings.
It has only a bullpen to blame for its troubles.
Stanford gave up a 10-8 lead when Jeff Stimpson gave
up a three-run home run to Hardy after coming in to the
game in relief of Kodiak Quick.
It has gone somewhat unnoticed since Stimpson had
such a fine non-conference season, but he's struggled
mightily in conference play. Including last night's game,
Stimpson has a 1-2 record, 7.50 ERA and has allowed
nine hits and eight walks in 13 and 1 / 3 innings pitched.
After scoring twice in the top of the eighth to tie
the score, the Cardinal allowed the Wildcats to re
gain the lead yet again. This time, it was Matt Man
ship on the mound, and he allowed a two-run double
to Derek Decater and a run-scoring single to Jeff
Van Houten.
Ultimately, Stanford trailed 15-12 entering the ninth
and seemed all but dead after having used up so much
energy continually putting runs on the scoreboard.
But with one out, Chris Carter hit a solo homer to
cut the deficit to two. Freshman Jim Rapoport pinch
hit for Adam Sorgi and promptly singled up the mid
dle. Sam Fuld and Chris Minaker drew back-to-back
walks, and Stanford had the bases loaded with its best
hitter coming up.
And, boy, did he deliver.
Lowrie sent a pitch from Arizona closer Derek Ro
driguez over the right field fence for his first career grand
slam. But it turned out to only be a go-ahead, and not
game-winning, hit.
All in all, there were nine lead changes in the game.
"That was the biggest rollercoaster game ever in
my life," Lowrie said. "I can't even explain it. I'm still
in shock."

Junior catcher Danny Lucy readies fora pitch. The Cardinal lost a heartbreaker to Arizona 18-
1 8 in Tucson, tying tne series at 1 -1. Stanford will play the Wildcats again tomorrow at 1 p.m.
Danny Putnam hit safely for the 20th time in 21 games.
Saturday's game was almost a mirror of yesterday's
crazy affair — except that O'Hagan found a way to get
the save in that one.
In the ninth, O'Hagan gave up a leadoff walk to Moi
ses Duran and then an RBI single to Jason Donald after
Duran advanced to second on a passed ball. Mercado hit
a double, Donald went to third and then scored on an
RBI groundout by Trevor Crowe.
So, with one out, Arizona had pulled within 11-9
and had a runner on first with one out. But
O'Hagan shut the door with a strikeout and a flyout
to end the game.
Stanford starter Mark Romanczuk gave up five runs
in the bottom of the first, but his offense bailed him out.
Brian Hall went 2-for-4 with a double and a three-run
triple in a four-run third. Putnam had three hits and an
RBI and Chris Lewis had the game's only longball.
Stanford and Arizona will complete the three-game
series with a 12:30 p.m. contest this afternoon.

David O'Hagan's woeful ninth inning line: seven batters,
four runs, four hits, two walks, one hit batsmen, one
blown save, one loss, and no outs recorded.
The Stanford stopper had thrown 50-plus pitches a
day earlier, and perhaps his arm wasn't rested enough to
give another all-out performance.
O'Hagan gave up a three-run double to Arizona
catcher Richard Mercado before loading the bases and
giving up a game-ending walk to Wildcats leadoff man
John Hardy that scored pinch-runner Terrence Taylor
from third.
O'Hagan (5-1) was so upset with the 3-2 call by home
plate umpire Kendall Snyder that he promptly flung his
glove into the stands.
And with the glove went any chance of Stanford putting
any distance between itself and second-place Washington.
The Huskies (14-7) lost 10-8 in Los Angeles to Southern
California as national player of the week and Washington
ace Tim Lincecum was roughed up for nine runs and nine
hits in seven innings. Stanford remains only percentage
points ahead in the conference standings.
It has only a bullpen to blame for its troubles.
Stanford gave up a 10-8 lead when Jeff Stimpson gave
up a three-run home run to Hardy after coming in to the
game in relief of Kodiak Quick.
It has gone somewhat unnoticed since Stimpson had
such a fine non-conference season, but he's struggled
mightily in conference play. Including last night's game,
Stimpson has a 1-2 record, 7.50 ERA and has allowed
nine hits and eight walks in 13 and 1 / 3 innings pitched.
After scoring twice in the top of the eighth to tie
the score, the Cardinal allowed the Wildcats to re
gain the lead yet again. This time, it was Matt Man
ship on the mound, and he allowed a two-run double
to Derek Decater and a run-scoring single to Jeff
Van Houten.
Ultimately, Stanford trailed 15-12 entering the ninth
and seemed all but dead after having used up so much
energy continually putting runs on the scoreboard.
But with one out, Chris Carter hit a solo homer to
cut the deficit to two. Freshman Jim Rapoport pinch
hit for Adam Sorgi and promptly singled up the mid
dle. Sam Fuld and Chris Minaker drew back-to-back
walks, and Stanford had the bases loaded with its best
hitter coming up.
And, boy, did he deliver.
Lowrie sent a pitch from Arizona closer Derek Ro
driguez over the right field fence for his first career grand
slam. But it turned out to only be a go-ahead, and not
game-winning, hit.
All in all, there were nine lead changes in the game.
"That was the biggest rollercoaster game ever in
my life," Lowrie said. "I can't even explain it. I'm still
in shock."

Junior catcher Danny Lucy readies fora pitch. The Cardinal lost a heartbreaker to Arizona 18-
1 8 in Tucson, tying tne series at 1 -1. Stanford will play the Wildcats again tomorrow at 1 p.m.
Danny Putnam hit safely for the 20th time in 21 games.
Saturday's game was almost a mirror of yesterday's
crazy affair — except that O'Hagan found a way to get
the save in that one.
In the ninth, O'Hagan gave up a leadoff walk to Moi
ses Duran and then an RBI single to Jason Donald after
Duran advanced to second on a passed ball. Mercado hit
a double, Donald went to third and then scored on an
RBI groundout by Trevor Crowe.
So, with one out, Arizona had pulled within 11-9
and had a runner on first with one out. But
O'Hagan shut the door with a strikeout and a flyout
to end the game.
Stanford starter Mark Romanczuk gave up five runs
in the bottom of the first, but his offense bailed him out.
Brian Hall went 2-for-4 with a double and a three-run
triple in a four-run third. Putnam had three hits and an
RBI and Chris Lewis had the game's only longball.
Stanford and Arizona will complete the three-game
series with a 12:30 p.m. contest this afternoon.
The Stanford bullpen had a game to forget last night
in Tucson.
Maybe forget isn't a strong enough word.
Maybe it's more like an erase-permanently-from
any-part-of-the-brain type of thing.
That horrific showing wasted a career night for Jed
Lowrie. The senior second baseman and legitimate All-
American candidate had a career-high six hits (6-for-6)
and 5 RBIs in a losing cause for Stanford. He had a ninth
inning grand slam that put his team ahead momentarily,
17-15.
"Obviously, this was a tough loss," Lowrie said. "We
just have to come back and refocus, put this one behind
us and concentrate on getting a win [today]."
Stanford (38-9, 12-5 Pacific-10 Conference), which
won 11 -9 in Saturday's series-opening contest, fell to 2-5
in one-run games.
