# No. 2 Stanford still in search of series closer
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The first two games of a series have become
all but predictable affairs for the No. 2 Stanford
baseball team. With sophomore starters Mark
Romanczuk and Jeff Gilmore settling into effec
tive pitching routines, the Cardinal hitters can
breathe easy and do what they do best — pro
vide run support.
But the final game of a series is dangerous terri
tory for Stanford, a fact evidenced by its 3-3 record
in final games since the beginning of March.
The reason for the Cardinal's penchant for un
certain series finales is simple — the pitching staff
has yet to establish a consistent third starter.
Three Stanford pitchers have been given the

nod to start in the last game of a series: junior Mark
Jecman, freshman Blake Holler and freshman
Greg Reynolds. While all three have shown flash
es of brilliance on the mound, none has been de
pendable enough to lock up the third spot in the
Cardinal rotation.
That hole in the Stanford rotation has been the
subject of speculation since the start of the season,
but it has often been viewed in a positive light, as it
fosters a friendly competition in the bullpen that
gives Cardinal hurlers a very good reason for
throwing effective relief innings.
But with a tight Pacific-10 Conference race tak
ing shape, along with the postseason looming in
the not-so-distant future — only eight games re-
main until NCAA Regionals — seeking
out that third starter is becoming a much
more urgent quest.
And for two straight weekends, con
sistency has been anything but synony
mous with Stanford's pitching staff.
At Washington, nine Cardinal pitch
ers saw time on the mound, five of whom
were waved out of the bullpen during
Sunday's treacherous rubber game.
Once starting righthander Reynolds got
into trouble after just 2 1/ 3 innings —
the freshman gave up four runs on four
hits and three walks — Holler, sopho
mores Matt Manship and Kodiak Quick
and freshmen Matt Leva tried to put out
the flames. The 9-2 final score pretty
much tells the way that story ended.
And if that game didn't incite
enough worry over the state of the

bullpen, last night did the trick. It's
pretty tough to blame a loss on an of
fense that produced 18 runs, l l > hits,
seven moon shots and four multiple
hit games.
This afternoon Stanford finds itself
facing its second rubber game in as
many Pac-10 series — with a seriously
depleted bullpen.
The Cardinal used nine pitchers in
its first two games at Arizona — the
same total used in the entire Washing
ton series. Romanczuk and Gilmore
did not have their best pitches working
for them in their respective starts, forc
ing Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess to go to the pen earlier than he
would have liked.
The team's saves leader, senior closer
David O'Hagan, who was pinned with
last night's loss, has already been used
twice in the series. Usually effective re
lievers Holler and freshman Jeff Stimp
son have already thrown a couple of in
nings each.
This afternoon's game is shaping up to
be as unpredictable a contest as a Cardi

nal series finale has ever been.
Though Marquess has not named a
starter for the game — as has been his
custom fora few weeks now — it is likely
that Reynolds (3-1) will get a chance to
redeem himself after last weekend's loss
to the Huskies.
Because the 6-foot-8 freshman
missed the first half of the season
with an arm injury, he ranks only
seventh on the staff in innings
pitched (21 2 / 3). Reynolds was
solid in his five-inning stint two
weekends ago when he earned the
victory after the Cardinal's 17-3 rout
of Washington State, and despite
having a ragged 7.56 ERA in Pac-10
play, conference opponents are hit
ting only .250 against him.
All told, the righthander has the po
tential to propel Stanford to a series win
over Arizona as well as help the Cardinal
avoid what would be its first two-game
losing streak of the season.
But with the Cardinal's current in
consistency out of the bullpen, the team
must prepare for anything. And if

Reynolds falters, he won't have much to
back him up.
Only two regular Stanford relievers
have yet to take the mound in this series
— Leva and senior righthander Drew
Ehrlich.
Leva's last outing, despite the fact
that it fell during the Cardinal's 9-2
loss to Washington, showed
promise. The righthander lasted
longer than any of his teammates on
the mound (2 2/3 innings) and he
did not give up a run.
Ehrlich proved crucial last month in
Stanford's 14-inning win over Santa
Clara, drawing the victory and main
taining poise in a tight contest.
But three pitchers may not be enough
to drive the Cardinal past the Wildcats'
offense. Friday's game required a trio of
hurlers — Stanford's ace, one of its top
relievers and its closer — and Arizona
still knocked out nine runs on nine hits.
The bottom line: The Wildcats have
the Stanford bullpen's number.
And Reynolds and Co. have nine in
nings to find a way around that.

certain series finales is simple — the pitching staff
has yet to establish a consistent third starter.
Three Stanford pitchers have been given the

nod to start in the last game of a series: junior Mark
Jecman, freshman Blake Holler and freshman
Greg Reynolds. While all three have shown flash
es of brilliance on the mound, none has been de
pendable enough to lock up the third spot in the
Cardinal rotation.
That hole in the Stanford rotation has been the
subject of speculation since the start of the season,
but it has often been viewed in a positive light, as it
fosters a friendly competition in the bullpen that
gives Cardinal hurlers a very good reason for
throwing effective relief innings.
But with a tight Pacific-10 Conference race tak
ing shape, along with the postseason looming in
the not-so-distant future — only eight games re-
main until NCAA Regionals — seeking
out that third starter is becoming a much
more urgent quest.
And for two straight weekends, con
sistency has been anything but synony
mous with Stanford's pitching staff.
At Washington, nine Cardinal pitch
ers saw time on the mound, five of whom
were waved out of the bullpen during
Sunday's treacherous rubber game.
Once starting righthander Reynolds got
into trouble after just 2 1/ 3 innings —
the freshman gave up four runs on four
hits and three walks — Holler, sopho
mores Matt Manship and Kodiak Quick
and freshmen Matt Leva tried to put out
the flames. The 9-2 final score pretty
much tells the way that story ended.
And if that game didn't incite
enough worry over the state of the

bullpen, last night did the trick. It's
pretty tough to blame a loss on an of
fense that produced 18 runs, l l > hits,
seven moon shots and four multiple
hit games.
This afternoon Stanford finds itself
facing its second rubber game in as
many Pac-10 series — with a seriously
depleted bullpen.
The Cardinal used nine pitchers in
its first two games at Arizona — the
same total used in the entire Washing
ton series. Romanczuk and Gilmore
did not have their best pitches working
for them in their respective starts, forc
ing Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess to go to the pen earlier than he
would have liked.
The team's saves leader, senior closer
David O'Hagan, who was pinned with
last night's loss, has already been used
twice in the series. Usually effective re
lievers Holler and freshman Jeff Stimp
son have already thrown a couple of in
nings each.
This afternoon's game is shaping up to
be as unpredictable a contest as a Cardi

nal series finale has ever been.
Though Marquess has not named a
starter for the game — as has been his
custom fora few weeks now — it is likely
that Reynolds (3-1) will get a chance to
redeem himself after last weekend's loss
to the Huskies.
Because the 6-foot-8 freshman
missed the first half of the season
with an arm injury, he ranks only
seventh on the staff in innings
pitched (21 2 / 3). Reynolds was
solid in his five-inning stint two
weekends ago when he earned the
victory after the Cardinal's 17-3 rout
of Washington State, and despite
having a ragged 7.56 ERA in Pac-10
play, conference opponents are hit
ting only .250 against him.
All told, the righthander has the po
tential to propel Stanford to a series win
over Arizona as well as help the Cardinal
avoid what would be its first two-game
losing streak of the season.
But with the Cardinal's current in
consistency out of the bullpen, the team
must prepare for anything. And if

Reynolds falters, he won't have much to
back him up.
Only two regular Stanford relievers
have yet to take the mound in this series
— Leva and senior righthander Drew
Ehrlich.
Leva's last outing, despite the fact
that it fell during the Cardinal's 9-2
loss to Washington, showed
promise. The righthander lasted
longer than any of his teammates on
the mound (2 2/3 innings) and he
did not give up a run.
Ehrlich proved crucial last month in
Stanford's 14-inning win over Santa
Clara, drawing the victory and main
taining poise in a tight contest.
But three pitchers may not be enough
to drive the Cardinal past the Wildcats'
offense. Friday's game required a trio of
hurlers — Stanford's ace, one of its top
relievers and its closer — and Arizona
still knocked out nine runs on nine hits.
The bottom line: The Wildcats have
the Stanford bullpen's number.
And Reynolds and Co. have nine in
nings to find a way around that.
The first two games of a series have become
all but predictable affairs for the No. 2 Stanford
baseball team. With sophomore starters Mark
Romanczuk and Jeff Gilmore settling into effec
tive pitching routines, the Cardinal hitters can
breathe easy and do what they do best — pro
vide run support.
But the final game of a series is dangerous terri
tory for Stanford, a fact evidenced by its 3-3 record
in final games since the beginning of March.
