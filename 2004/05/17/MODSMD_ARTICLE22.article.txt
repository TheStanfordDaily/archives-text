# No. 1 tennis blanks No. 26 Michigan 4-0
## 
### MIA R. LEE STAFF WRITER 
Fans at Taube Family Tennis Stadium anxiously di
vided their attention between courts two and slx as the
No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team (25-0) raced to a 4-
0 shutout of No. 26 Michigan (16-7) in round two of the
NCAA Championships.
Competing in the No. 6 singles slot, senior Emilia An
derson forced an error by the Wolverines' Debra Streifler
to clinch the decisive fourth point for the Cardinal, 6-2,6-3.
Meanwhile, sophomore Alice Barnes's No. 2 singles
match against No. 83 Elizabeth Exon was suspended just
two points shy of Cardinal victory. After dropping the first
game, Barnes broke Exon's serve twice go up 6-1 in the
first set. Up 5-2 in the second. Barnes was on serve and tied
at 30-all when the buzzer sounded for Stanford success.
Leading the way with 17 consecutive Pacific-10 Con
ference titles and backed by an easy first-round win over
Quinnipiac (16-5), 4-0, it's hard to envision Stanford hav
ing any reservations about Michigan.
Freshman Theresa Logar tells a different story.
"Going into that match, 1 was very nervous because I
couldn't shake from my mind what happened to Stan
ford basketball at NCAAs," Logar said, referring to the
Cardinal men's upset loss in the second round of March's
NCAA basketball tournament. "I kept telling myself,
'We just have to get ready for it,' and it worked out pret
ty well. We all rose to the occasion."
Logar's nervousness increased during her second set
against Kara Delicata, as she was down, 2-0, and no one
else had finished their first set. In the No. 4 singles slot, se
nior Lauren Barnikow was down, 5-3, against Leanne
Rutherford. Playing at No. 3 singles, junior Erin Burdette
had let a 5-0 lead slip to 5-5 in a matter of 15 minutes.
"It was just a big 'Oh, no' [moment] for me," Logar
said. "When I started doing well again, 1 didn't look at the
scoreboard because I decided to focus on the one thing I
could control — my own match."
Logar fought back to down Delicata, 6-0,6-3. After
just over an hour of competition, the No. 40 singles play

er improved her dual record to an impressive 24-0 and
nabbed the first singles point for Stanford.
Three minutes later. No. 7 Amber Liu (16-4) blanked
Michelle DaCosta, 6-0,6-0, in the No. 1 singles position
to garner another point for the Cardinal.
No. 56 DaCosta was no match for Liu's startling
consistency and aggressive baseline tactics. On serve
and down 4-0 in the first set, DaCosta found herself
pegged in the corner of the deuce court, returning one
of Liu's many series of forehand drives. Liu quickly
switched in a backhand return, sending DaCosta
scrambling to return it and leaving a ripe opportunity
for Liu to smash the ball away.
While Liu ended points quickly, one court over, her
doubles partner, Barnes, was caught in a struggle of
stamina with Exon. A fiery lefty, Exon would put spin
on her first serve in hopes of psyching out her opponent.
When possible, Barnes would give Exon a taste of her
own medicine and counter with a backhand slice return.
"We have some people who are playing very sharp
right now and are just going to get sharper heading into
action next week," said Stanford head coach Lele
Forood in a press release yesterday.
In doubles, the top-ranked duo of Barnikow and Bur
dette continued to shine, defeating DaCosta and Delica
ta, 8-4. Barnes and Liu defeated Streifler and Kim
Plaushines with the same results. After a swift 8-2 victo
ry over Quinnipiac, the No. 56 doubles team of Ander
son and freshman Anne Yelsey struggled against
Chrissic Nolan and Kavita Tipirneni in third-flight dou
bles. They were losing, 7-4, when Barnikow and Bur
dette clinched the doubles point for Stanford, halting fur
ther doubles play.
Boasting a 15-3 record, Yelsey appeared to be on top
of her game, but Anderson expressed frustration over
her repeated forehand errors. Nevertheless, Saturday's
competition at Taube came full circle for Anderson as
she redeemed herself handily in singles.
The Cardinal will face No. 17 Kentucky (18-11) in the
round of 16 on Thursday. The action begins at 3 p.m. in
Athens, Ga.

Three minutes later. No. 7 Amber Liu (16-4) blanked
Michelle DaCosta, 6-0,6-0, in the No. 1 singles position
to garner another point for the Cardinal.
No. 56 DaCosta was no match for Liu's startling
consistency and aggressive baseline tactics. On serve
and down 4-0 in the first set, DaCosta found herself
pegged in the corner of the deuce court, returning one
of Liu's many series of forehand drives. Liu quickly
switched in a backhand return, sending DaCosta
scrambling to return it and leaving a ripe opportunity
for Liu to smash the ball away.
While Liu ended points quickly, one court over, her
doubles partner, Barnes, was caught in a struggle of
stamina with Exon. A fiery lefty, Exon would put spin
on her first serve in hopes of psyching out her opponent.
When possible, Barnes would give Exon a taste of her
own medicine and counter with a backhand slice return.
"We have some people who are playing very sharp
right now and are just going to get sharper heading into
action next week," said Stanford head coach Lele
Forood in a press release yesterday.
In doubles, the top-ranked duo of Barnikow and Bur
dette continued to shine, defeating DaCosta and Delica
ta, 8-4. Barnes and Liu defeated Streifler and Kim
Plaushines with the same results. After a swift 8-2 victo
ry over Quinnipiac, the No. 56 doubles team of Ander
son and freshman Anne Yelsey struggled against
Chrissic Nolan and Kavita Tipirneni in third-flight dou
bles. They were losing, 7-4, when Barnikow and Bur
dette clinched the doubles point for Stanford, halting fur
ther doubles play.
Boasting a 15-3 record, Yelsey appeared to be on top
of her game, but Anderson expressed frustration over
her repeated forehand errors. Nevertheless, Saturday's
competition at Taube came full circle for Anderson as
she redeemed herself handily in singles.
The Cardinal will face No. 17 Kentucky (18-11) in the
round of 16 on Thursday. The action begins at 3 p.m. in
Athens, Ga.

Senior Lauren Barnikow waits for the return in
doubles play. No. 1 tennis shutout No. 26 Michi
gan this weekend at Taube Family Tennis Center.
Fans at Taube Family Tennis Stadium anxiously di
vided their attention between courts two and slx as the
No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team (25-0) raced to a 4-
0 shutout of No. 26 Michigan (16-7) in round two of the
NCAA Championships.
Competing in the No. 6 singles slot, senior Emilia An
derson forced an error by the Wolverines' Debra Streifler
to clinch the decisive fourth point for the Cardinal, 6-2,6-3.
Meanwhile, sophomore Alice Barnes's No. 2 singles
match against No. 83 Elizabeth Exon was suspended just
two points shy of Cardinal victory. After dropping the first
game, Barnes broke Exon's serve twice go up 6-1 in the
first set. Up 5-2 in the second. Barnes was on serve and tied
at 30-all when the buzzer sounded for Stanford success.
Leading the way with 17 consecutive Pacific-10 Con
ference titles and backed by an easy first-round win over
Quinnipiac (16-5), 4-0, it's hard to envision Stanford hav
ing any reservations about Michigan.
Freshman Theresa Logar tells a different story.
"Going into that match, 1 was very nervous because I
couldn't shake from my mind what happened to Stan
ford basketball at NCAAs," Logar said, referring to the
Cardinal men's upset loss in the second round of March's
NCAA basketball tournament. "I kept telling myself,
'We just have to get ready for it,' and it worked out pret
ty well. We all rose to the occasion."
Logar's nervousness increased during her second set
against Kara Delicata, as she was down, 2-0, and no one
else had finished their first set. In the No. 4 singles slot, se
nior Lauren Barnikow was down, 5-3, against Leanne
Rutherford. Playing at No. 3 singles, junior Erin Burdette
had let a 5-0 lead slip to 5-5 in a matter of 15 minutes.
"It was just a big 'Oh, no' [moment] for me," Logar
said. "When I started doing well again, 1 didn't look at the
scoreboard because I decided to focus on the one thing I
could control — my own match."
Logar fought back to down Delicata, 6-0,6-3. After
just over an hour of competition, the No. 40 singles play

er improved her dual record to an impressive 24-0 and
nabbed the first singles point for Stanford.
Three minutes later. No. 7 Amber Liu (16-4) blanked
Michelle DaCosta, 6-0,6-0, in the No. 1 singles position
to garner another point for the Cardinal.
