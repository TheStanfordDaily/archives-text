first game of the twin bill.
Senior catcher Jessica Allister launched two home

RBI single by third baseman Liz Bendig plated Al

before Allister broke up a no-hitter for the second
time that day, blasting a solo shot over the center
field wall in the fifth.
Later that inning, Jackie Hansen would score
when Meghan Sickler reached on an error, tying

by — who else — Allister gave Stanford a 5-
2 edge.
In the seventh, a Lappin single plated Jackie
Rinehart, and an Allister single scored Morris for
the Cardinal's seventh and final run — as well as
the catcher's fourth RBI in the game.
Sorenson picked up her second win of the after

ing 2 2/3 scoreless innings.
Severson allowed two runs in 4 1/3 innings.
Hoffman (19-16) took the loss for Oregon State, al

four hits and one run in six innings.
The Ducks broke a 0-0 tie in the fifth when No.

school history.
