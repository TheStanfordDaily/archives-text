### ANDREW GAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Carnegie Corporation of
New York announced 2004's class
of Carnegie Scholars, including
Stanford's Elizabeth Sherwood-
Randall, a senior research scholar
at the Institute for International
Studies' Center for International
Security and Cooperation.
Sherwood-Randall, who will be
receiving a research grant of up to
$100,000 for either one or two
years, plans on using the money to
further pursue her work in interna
tional studies.
"1 am truly honored to be in
cluded in such a distinguished
group of scholars," she said. "I plan
to use this support to develop rec
ommendations that will help the
United States to strengthen its
most important alliance relation
ships and cultivate new partner
ships in order to advance American
national security."
The Carnegie Corporation Web
site states that the program was es
tablished in 1999 to "support innov
ative individuals as they pursue re
search that holds the promise of ad
vancing knowledge, informing the
public and shaping policy in areas
of the corporation's programmatic
interest â€” education, international
development, strengthening U.S.
democracy and international peace
and security."
According to a Carnegie Corpo
ration press release, the communica
tion of ideas to areas outside the aca
demic community is central to the
Carnegie Scholars Program.

"The annual announcement of
the Carnegie Scholars is an opportu
nity to celebrate original and cre
ative thinking on a wide array of so
cial issues important to the corpora
tion's strategies," said Carnegie Cor
poration President Vartan Gregori
an in the press release.
Sherwood-Randall said she not
only wants to communicate new
ideas but wants to create solutions
that can be enacted to address inter
national problems.
"I understand that the Carnegie
Corporation has selected recipients
of this scholarship with the intention
that our work should be used toward
the generation of new ideas that lay
the groundwork for progress on key
issues facing our nation and the
world," she said. "I have spent the
past seven years working on a variety
of efforts to prevent the emergence
of major new national security
threats to the United States and have
placed heavy emphasis on the idea
that our academic research must be
translated into action."
In the past, Sherwood-Randall has
worked in both the executive and leg
islative branches of the federal gov
ernment as deputy assistant secretary
of defense at the Pentagon and in the
Senate as senior foreign and defense
policy advisor to Senator Joseph R.
Biden. She has also worked in think
tanks such as the Brookings Institu
tion and as a professor at both Har
vard and Stanford.
In addition to working at the Cen
ter for International Security and
Cooperation, Sherwood-Randall is
currently a senior advisor to the Pre
ventative Defense Project, are

search collaboration between Stan
ford and Harvard.
The project is chaired by former
Secretary of Defense and Stanford
Professor William Perry; it focuses
on strengthening U.S. and world se
curity by looking at issues from a
perspective based upon prevention,
Sherwood-Randall said.
"At Preventative Defense, we
concentrate on identifying and pre
venting major new security threats
from emerging," she explained.
"Right now we are focusing much
of our effort on the challenge of
keeping weapons of mass destruc
tion out of the hands of terrorists."
According to the Carnegie Cor
poration Web site, scholars must
be nominated by select individuals
from both public and private re
search universities, liberal arts col
leges, community colleges, think
tanks, the media, the private sector
and the government.
Carnegie Scholars are selected
based upon numerous criteria,
namely originality and promise of an
idea, the probability of success of the
project and the applicants' record.
Sherwood-Randall, whose pro
ject is titled "Transforming Transat
lantic Relations: A New Agenda for
a New Era," said she is excited about
the scholarship.
"The Carnegie Corporation has a
long history of supporting path
breaking work in international secu
rity," she said. "I think there is in
creasing recognition that the United
States must find better ways to trans
late its power into effective influ
ence, and this is a major aspect of the
work I proposed to undertake."
