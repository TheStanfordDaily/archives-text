### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Psychology students and researchers from 13
states and 41 institutions gathered on campus
this weekend to present recent projects and dis
cuss their findings. The fourth annual Stanford
Undergraduate Psychology Conference
(SUPC) drew projects from a wide range of
fields, including social, clinical, biological, cog
nitive and cultural psychology.
Students presented posters and gave talks
describing their undergraduate work in psy
chology. Many of the presenters discussed
data gathered for honors theses and other dis
sertations. Proceeds collected during the con
ference will be donated to purchase academic
material and textbooks at the Gateway High
School in San Francisco.
"The conference is important for undergradu

ates to showcase their work," said SUPC Executive
Director Felicity Miao, a senior. "It's also an op
portunity for undergraduates, graduate students
and professors to work together on one event."
Miao added that the conference enhances
Stanford's position as the number-one ranked
psychology department in the nation.
"For some students, this is the first psycholo
gy conference that they've ever attended, and
therefore likely the most exposure their honors
and final-year projects will ever get," Miao said.
"For others who are more fortunate to attend
more conferences, this conference simply adds to
their experience of showing their work. The au
diences are always different at every location."
Students who presented gave short 15-minute
speeches, many accompanied by PowerPoint
slideshows. These talks were followed by ques-
tion-and-answer sessions allowing
students to collaborate and receive
feedback on their work, Miao said.
"These inquiries ranged from
methodological to innovative
ideas for future research," said
SUPC Associate Director Laura
Nowell, a junior. "Some questions
could be addressed by referencing
past research, while others ex
plored the hypothetical, inviting
the audience to establish their own
hypotheses and experiments to
test them."
Coordinators said the confer
ence provided students with a
unique learning experience that
departed from both the laboratory
and classroom.
"[The conference) gives under
graduates studying psychology from
all over the nation the opportunity to

share their research and learn more
about psychology from each other in
stead of from classes and textbooks,"
said SUPC Associate Director Eva
Chen, a sophomore. "People also
have a chance to check out the Stan
ford campus and our psychology de
partment â€” many people were inter
ested in visiting the location of the fa
mous Stanford Prison Experiment."
Presenters were also given the
chance to eat lunch and socialize
with psychology faculty members
who provided insight into different
areas relevant to their research.
"Psychology is applicable to all
of us," Miao said. "Sharing psy
chological findings with the gener
al public enhances understanding
of ourselves as well as introducing
appropriate interventions."
Miao described one project she
found especially significant on
parental styles in the United States,
Hong Kong and Beijing. Presented
by University of Michigan student
Joey Fung, the project evaluated dif
ferences in parental styles between
these different locales.
Chen said she was particularly in

terested in projects that researched
different ethnicities, including an
analysis of the effect racial valuation
has on preschool children.
"1 personally am interested in
projects that involve developmen
tal, social and cultural psychology
since 1 think the topics they investi
gate are especially pertinent to the
general public," Chen said.
She also described one project
designed to determine how video
clips can influence children to
make healthier snack choices.
"It is important that the re
search presented in the confer
ence is accessible to the general
public because of its implications
for life outside of the psychology
lab." Nowell said. "One girl con
cluded through her research that
warning children about potential
losses from bad behavior is more
effective than promising them the
benefits conferred by good behav
ior when trying to engender be
havior change. These types of
findings are pertinent to society in
general as well as to psychology
enthusiasts in particular."
