The waves of the future are gravitational, physi
cist Kip Thorne told an audience of physicists and
the public last Friday night. He explained that new
detectors of gravitational waves will soon allow sci
entists to understand the beginning of the universe
and intricacies of relativity Einstein never predicted.
Thorne, a professor at the California Institute
of Technology, has emphasized the need to pop
ularize science throughout his career, and his talk
focused on both the violent and regenerative as
pects of cosmology, including black hole annihi

lation and the Big Bang theory.
"More than any other American physicist.
Kip has been Mr. Relativity," said Stanford
Physics Prof. Roger Blandford in his introduc
tion, referring to Thome's ability to draw a
crowd of 150 to a Friday night.
One of the strange effects of relativity Thorne ad
dressed is what occurs around a black hole. The con
ventional trouble with studying black holes, he said,
is that no electromagnetic radiation — such as light
— can escape. But physicists have proposed that
what does escape from black holes is gravitational

waves, and they think that they can
learn much more about relativity by
detecting what happens when a small
black hole is engulfed by a larger one.
"The challenge for the coming
decade is to probe black holes in ex
quisite detail," Thorne explained.
He described how collisions of
black holes release immense amounts
of energy — up to 10 percent of their
mass, which is much more than the 0.5
percent thaN a nuclear explosion re
leases. All this energy is released in
gravitational waves, but until today,
researchers have never had the tech
nology or ability to detect these waves.
The first gravitational wave detec
tors were completed in 2002 in Wash
ington state and Louisiana. LIGO, the
Laser Interferometer Gravitational
Wave Observatory', is a set of lasers
built in a four-kilometer long L-shape,
meant to detect slight fluctuations in
space and time that indicate gravity
waves. The apparatus began collecting
measurements in 2002, and will be fol
lowed by a space-based set of lasers

that is slated for launch in 2014.
"We are going to learn new
things about the physics of space
and time," he said.
Beyond black holes, physicists
also want to use these new detectors
to study the very beginning of the
universe. Thorne pointed out that
current telescopes can only see elec
tromagnetic waves, which first ap
peared 100,000 years after the Big
Bang. In contrast, gravitational
waves may allow physicists to wit
ness the first nanoseconds of the
Universe's existence.
He explained that gravitational
waves might even provide insight into
cutting-edge string theories. Theoreti
cal particle physicists argue that the
universe may be made up of as many
as 10 dimensions instead of the three
humans normally perceive. Most of
these dimensions are rolled up into ex
tremely small spaces, so they are near
ly impossible to detect. However, at
the very beginning of the universe, all
of space was confined in a small area,
so these other dimensions may have
had an influence that can be re
searched by looking at gravity waves.
"These studies may revolution
ize our understanding of the uni
verse," Thorne said.
As the culminating event of a con

ference on the Big Bang and black
holes, the lecture elaborated not just
on future experiments but also current
efforts to test more conventional pre
dictions of relativity.
Thome explained that Albert Ein
stein's theory of general relativity
predicts three gravitational effects.
First, time is slowed near massive
bodies, like the Earth. Second, every
object warps the space around it. And
finally, a rotating body drags space
around it in a "tornado-like whirl."
All these effects are impercepti
bly small. The first effect was test
ed in 1976 by an atomic clock that
was launched into space. Almost
simultaneously, the bending of
space was measured by observing
radio signals sent near the sun. The
effect is that the total distance from
the Earth to Mars is lengthened by
just 37 kilometers over a total dis
tance of 378 million kilometers,
Thome explained.
The whirl effect is currently being
tested by Gravity Probe B, a Stan
ford-based experiment that launched
last month. Using precise gyroscopes
cooled to near absolute zero, Stan
ford physicists hope to detect this
drag in space, which amounts to just
one revolution around the Earth
every six million years.
