The waves of the future are gravitational, physi
cist Kip Thorne told an audience of physicists and
the public last Friday night. He explained that new
detectors of gravitational waves will soon allow sci
entists to understand the beginning of the universe
and intricacies of relativity Einstein never predicted.
Thorne, a professor at the California Institute
of Technology, has emphasized the need to pop
ularize science throughout his career, and his talk
focused on both the violent and regenerative as
pects of cosmology, including black hole annihi

lation and the Big Bang theory.
"More than any other American physicist.
Kip has been Mr. Relativity," said Stanford
Physics Prof. Roger Blandford in his introduc
tion, referring to Thome's ability to draw a
crowd of 150 to a Friday night.
One of the strange effects of relativity Thorne ad
dressed is what occurs around a black hole. The con
ventional trouble with studying black holes, he said,
is that no electromagnetic radiation — such as light
— can escape. But physicists have proposed that
what does escape from black holes is gravitational
