Calling for the University to publish in
vestment information, the Stanford Coali
tion for Investment Disclosure (SCID) will
hold a town hall meeting on Thursday at 7
p.m. in Kimball Lounge.
According to SCID, Stanford should
formally identify the public and private
equities in which it is investing its over $12
billion endowment.

SCID member Anna Mumford, a junior,
said that a large portion of Stanford's in
vestments are in private equities, meaning
that the University is subject to fewer stan
dards for disclosure.
"Our goal is to make Stanford disclose
which private equities it invests in so that
we know where our money is going,"
Mumford said.
Members of the coalition said that
past actions have pressured the Universi
ty to divest from corporations supporting

apartheid in South Africa and slave labor
in Burma. In addition, Stanford invests in
the hedge fund Farallon LLC, which does
not disclose the social and environmental
impacts of its investments. At Thursday's
meeting, faculty and alumni who took
part in previous movements for Stan
ford's disclosure of information will
speak about their experiences, activism
and strategies.
According to SCID, more and more stu
dents say they are interested to know how

their money is spent.
"As students paying tuition, we have a
right to know where our money is being
invested, and to know that our money is
being used for socially responsible in
vestments," said junior Kste Skolnick of
the Stanford Community for Peace and
Justice (SCPJ).
Over 10 environmental, labor and social
justice groups on campus have joined
SC'lD's effort. SCID is a subsidiary of the
Responsible Endowments Coalition

(REC), a national organization of students
from 28 colleges, including Harvard, Yale
and Duke. The REC targets hedge funds be
cause they are exempt from many regula
tions enforced by the Securities and Ex
change Commission.
"Given the University's past history, all
students have an interest in guaranteeing
that our present investments are not sup
porting socially, environmentally or politi
cally irresponsible companies," said SCID
member Ryan Schwartz, a freshman.
