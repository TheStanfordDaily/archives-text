# Teacher Talk
## Just ask! 
### PROF. MARTHA CYERT DEPT. OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES 
In 1992,1 accepted a job in the Dept. of
Biological Sciences at Stanford. Twelve
years later I'm still here — teaching and
running a research lab where we study the

biochemical mechanisms
that allow yeast cells to
survive hostile environ
mental conditions.
My road to Stanford
started when 1 was an un
dergraduate at Harvard
and carried out my first in
dependent research pro
ject. From there I worked
in a series of labs, and
studied different process-

es in bacteria, yeast and frog cells.
I realize now that each time I entered a
new lab and embarked on a new project the
most important thing I learned was how to
ask new questions. I experienced the thrill of
thinking up my very own questions, realizing
that no one knew the answers to them and
figuring out what experiments I could do to
get some answers. However, I also found that
the time I spent in the lab doing experiments
was not only a search for answers, but also for
new questions.
Asking questions is the most fundamen
tal part of any learning experience. It is far
better to run the risk of being embarrassed by
showing what you don't know, than not to ask
a question and miss the opportunity to learn
something new. Fora scientist, formulating a
question is like creating a work of art. These
questions are far from obvious — rather they
are the result of an indefinable, quirky, indi
vidual thought process.
Most people's vision of a scientist at work
is of a pale, antisocial nerd with a calculator
and glasses, working alone, late into the
night, thinking hard until he/she comes up
with some brilliant insight. Nothing could be
farther from the truth. (Although I have to
admit I've worn glasses since third grade.)
When you walk into a typical research lab
you hear music and lots of conversation —
it's these conversations that are really the heart
of the lab. Discussing your observations and
ideas with colleagues is one of the most critical
and enjoyable parts of the scientific process.
One conversation that stands out in my
memory happened in 1987, when I was just
finishing my doctoral research. That summer
I attended a small conference in New Hamp
shire and found myself hiking for three hours
in the rain with Paul Nurse and Steve Reed.
As we climbed a mountain and gasped for
breath, we also talked.
1 had never met either of these scientists
before, but I had read many of their papers.
At the time, I was studying how cells progress
through different stages of the cell cycle, and
was using frog eggs for my experiments. Paul
and Steve were investigating this same issue,
but used yeast cells for their studies.
We were doing very different types of ex
periments, yet we were trying to answer the
same questions. The discussions 1 had with
them made a big impression on me — they
had a very different perspective than I did,
and we asked each other lots of questions and
compared our thoughts and confusions about
how the cell cycle worked.
1 was grateful for the chance to learn from
them and incredibly proud that they were
equally interested in hearing what I had to
say. I returned to San Francisco with fresh
ideas, insights and enthusiasm. Fifteen years
later I learned that I had been talking with a fu
ture Nobel-prize winner (now Sir Paul Nurse).
For the past 6 weeks, I've spent every
Tuesday and Thursday afternoon in the
Clarke Center teaching Bio 55 ("Genes,
Genomes and Proteins: Advanced Indepen
dent Research Laboratory"). There I am sur
rounded by eight groups of undergraduates
talking, laughing and occasionally groaning
as they move through the lab carrying
pipettes and yeast cultures.
At the beginning of the quarter, each
class period started with instructions and de
tailed explanations about the procedure the
students would perform that afternoon. But
in just a few short weeks I've watched these
students generate a single set of experimental
observations and then use them as a spring
board to create eight different and unique
sets of ideas for individual projects they are
now pursuing.
Hopefully in a few weeks they will have
answers to some of the questions they've
posed —and, I'm willing to bet that they'll
also have a lot more questions.

In 1992,1 accepted a job in the Dept. of
Biological Sciences at Stanford. Twelve
years later I'm still here — teaching and
running a research lab where we study the

biochemical mechanisms
that allow yeast cells to
survive hostile environ
mental conditions.
My road to Stanford
started when 1 was an un
dergraduate at Harvard
and carried out my first in
dependent research pro
ject. From there I worked
in a series of labs, and
studied different process-

es in bacteria, yeast and frog cells.
I realize now that each time I entered a
new lab and embarked on a new project the
most important thing I learned was how to
ask new questions. I experienced the thrill of
thinking up my very own questions, realizing
that no one knew the answers to them and
figuring out what experiments I could do to
get some answers. However, I also found that
the time I spent in the lab doing experiments
was not only a search for answers, but also for
new questions.
Asking questions is the most fundamen
tal part of any learning experience. It is far
better to run the risk of being embarrassed by
showing what you don't know, than not to ask
a question and miss the opportunity to learn
something new. Fora scientist, formulating a
question is like creating a work of art. These
questions are far from obvious — rather they
are the result of an indefinable, quirky, indi
vidual thought process.
Most people's vision of a scientist at work
is of a pale, antisocial nerd with a calculator
and glasses, working alone, late into the
night, thinking hard until he/she comes up
with some brilliant insight. Nothing could be
farther from the truth. (Although I have to
admit I've worn glasses since third grade.)
When you walk into a typical research lab
you hear music and lots of conversation —
it's these conversations that are really the heart
of the lab. Discussing your observations and
ideas with colleagues is one of the most critical
and enjoyable parts of the scientific process.
One conversation that stands out in my
memory happened in 1987, when I was just
finishing my doctoral research. That summer
I attended a small conference in New Hamp
shire and found myself hiking for three hours
in the rain with Paul Nurse and Steve Reed.
As we climbed a mountain and gasped for
breath, we also talked.
1 had never met either of these scientists
before, but I had read many of their papers.
At the time, I was studying how cells progress
through different stages of the cell cycle, and
was using frog eggs for my experiments. Paul
and Steve were investigating this same issue,
but used yeast cells for their studies.
We were doing very different types of ex
periments, yet we were trying to answer the
same questions. The discussions 1 had with
them made a big impression on me — they
had a very different perspective than I did,
and we asked each other lots of questions and
compared our thoughts and confusions about
how the cell cycle worked.
1 was grateful for the chance to learn from
them and incredibly proud that they were
equally interested in hearing what I had to
say. I returned to San Francisco with fresh
ideas, insights and enthusiasm. Fifteen years
later I learned that I had been talking with a fu
ture Nobel-prize winner (now Sir Paul Nurse).
For the past 6 weeks, I've spent every
Tuesday and Thursday afternoon in the
Clarke Center teaching Bio 55 ("Genes,
Genomes and Proteins: Advanced Indepen
dent Research Laboratory"). There I am sur
rounded by eight groups of undergraduates
talking, laughing and occasionally groaning
as they move through the lab carrying
pipettes and yeast cultures.
At the beginning of the quarter, each
class period started with instructions and de
tailed explanations about the procedure the
students would perform that afternoon. But
in just a few short weeks I've watched these
students generate a single set of experimental
observations and then use them as a spring
board to create eight different and unique
sets of ideas for individual projects they are
now pursuing.
Hopefully in a few weeks they will have
answers to some of the questions they've
posed —and, I'm willing to bet that they'll
also have a lot more questions.

Martha Cyert is an associate professor of bio
logical sciences. She has a bachelor's degree
in biochemistry from Harvard University
and a doctoral degree from UC-San Fran
cisco. She has been at Stanford for 14 years
and has taught the cell biology portion of
the bio core since 1993. She is currently
teaching Bio 54/55. She can be reached at
