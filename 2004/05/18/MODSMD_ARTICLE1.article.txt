# Remnick discusses media after Sept. 11
## New Yorker editor critiques media's Iraq war coverage 
### YURITZI JONES 
New Yorker magazine editor and
Pulitzer Prize winner David Remnick
argued in a speech last night that jour
nalism — because of its focus on sensa
tional news coverage — was not ready
for the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,2001
and their aftermath.
Remnick's talk at Kresge Auditori
um was only one part of the ongoing
16th annual John S. Knight Lecture and
Symposium. Remnick's accomplish
ments as a writer include a Pulitzer
Prize for his non-fiction book "Lenin's
Tomb"; he has also written three other
books and a collection of short pieces
for The New Yorker.
Speaking with a tone of slight criti
cism paired with occasional mild
humor. Remnick said that because of
Sept. 11, journalism was forced to take
on a sense of seriousness it did not have
before the attacks.
"We were poorly prepared," he said
of himself and other journalists, as he
discussed how correspondents had no
background regarding the countries
and organizations involved in the at

tacks. He also said that if journalists
think that they were indeed prepared,
"we would be deluding ourselves terri
bly as journalists."
"On Sept. 11, how many reporters
in American newspapers and televi
sion stations spoke functional Ara
bic? How many had adequate ongo
ing bureaus in the Middle East?"
he asked.
Remnick blamed this lack of prepa
ration on the news media's prior focus
on more sensational news coverage.
"News gathering is not a govern
ment enterprise but a business, some
times with values, sometimes not," he
said. "News executives have long
since noted that foreign reporting was
a bad deal."
He then added that news and enter
tainment often became indistinguishable.
"People have a desire to be enter
tained rather than educated," he argued.
Remnick then turned on the media's
audience when he said that the public
bears responsibility for what it chooses
to read, watch and ignore.
He also addressed the recent discov
ery of the abuse of Iraqi prisoners and
said that these abuses don't seem to ap
pear to be coming from a small group of
privates, but from a larger system im
plemented to soften up detainees for
interrogation, calling the abuse " as stu
pid as it is unconscionable."
Remnick ended his speech saying
that America still deserves to know
why the nation went to war. If the
war was fought to bring human rights
to Iraq, Remnick said that it has
not been accomplished in the eyes of
the Iraqis.
"We were supposed to usher in a
regime different in kind, not in degree,"
he said.
