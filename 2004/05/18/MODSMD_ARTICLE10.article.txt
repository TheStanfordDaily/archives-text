### Early universe lonely 
The early universe was a desolate place. According to
the standard theory, after the Big Bang there were multiple
generations of stars before enough hydrogen and helium
was converted into metal, allowing for planet-formation.
Recently a team found a planet believed to be 12.7 billion
years old, that is, it formed after when the universe was
barely 1 billion years old.
Most planets, though, arose much later, and thus, the op
portunity for life also came later. In a model presented by
Volker Bromm and Abraham Loeb of the Harvard-Smith
sonian Center for Astrophysics from the Harvard-Smithso-

nian Center for Astrophysicists, the windows for life opened some 500 million
and two billion years after the Big Bang.
Ice Age Mammoth found in Britain
Neville Hollingworth, a paleontologist for the United Kingdom's Natural
Environment Research Council, uncovered a 50,000-year old mammoth skull
in a gravel pit in southern England.
"The skull is exquisite. It is very finely preserved and almost looks like
modern bone," said Hollingworth, calling it his best find in 20 years of collect
ing fossils.
The skull weights almost 200 pounds. Its tusks are missing, but paleontolo
gist hope they can find them in the same gravel pit. This is only the second
mammoth specimen found in Britain.
I)NA-testing Christopher Columbus
The presumed remains of Christopher Columbus, preserved in the
University of Pavia, Italy, will undergo DNA-testing. The idea is to solve
a number of mysteries surrounding Columbus. First, the test may help
answer whether Pavia or the island of Santo Domingo have Columbus'
true remains. Second, it may tell whether he was Italian or Spanish â€” the
son of a Genoese wool trader of the illegitimate son of a Spanish noble
man. Third, it may put to rest the hypothesis that he was actually the il
legitimate son the Pope. The results are expected to be available some
time in May.
Radiation Sickness
Since the mid-1900s, but especially after the threat of terrorist attacks,
scientists have been studying the effects of radiation on the human body.
Human tissues like bone marrow and lymph nodes are extremely sensitive
to radiation. Moderate exposure can harm infection-fighting cells called
neutrophils, which makes the person more vulnerable to diseases. Most of
the knowledge from radiation sickness comes from survivors of Hiroshi
ma and Nagasaki at the end of World War 11. Scientists believe that indi
viduals who have survived through six weeks after initial exposure typi
cally make a full recovery.
The nature of the universe
Most astronomers believe the universe is made of five percent ordinary
matter, 25 percent dark matter and 70 percent dark energy. Ordinary mat
ter is the stuff of which you and I are made, dark matter is in many ways
the exact inverse. The big unknown is dark energy, the nature if which re
mains completely uncertain.
Currently, that is the best model to explain why the universe is expanding
at an increasing rate. But new studies are challenging these views. One team
found that galaxy clusters in the old universe emit more X-rays than now,
which suggests the universe may not be expanding at an increasing rate. A
second team believes there is much more than five percent of ordinary mat
ter in the universe.
Atkins revisited
The controversy over the Atkins diet continues. A multi-million global
phenomenon since 1972, the Atkins diet prescribes eating fats and choles
terol to lose weight. It may sound ludicrous but people following the regime
have actually become thinner. Health experts and nutritionists argue that
Atkins increases risk of heart disease and kidney disorders. The company
Atkins Nutritionals fights back by claiming the diet is "safe, effective and
beneficial." The Foods Standards Agency recommends that saturated fats
contribute no more than 11 percent of daily calorie intake, whereas Atkins
prescribes 20 percent.
