"Research and development in
data storage utilizing magnetic ma
terials and electron spin properties
seeks to eventually make hard
drives obsolete by creating a low
cost, high density nonvolatile all
purpose memory," said Roger
Wang, a spintronics researcher at
IBM Almaden Center. Wang is also
a Stanford graduate student in elec
trical engineering.
"The concept of using electron
spin as a bit carrier as opposed to
electron charge would result in
much lower current densities, dras
tically reducing power consump
tion, while also vastly improving
speed," he added.
Spintronics, or spin-based elec
tronics, is the study of using elec
trons' magnetic state, in addition to
their charged state. Conventional
electronic devices use electrons as
electrical charge carriers in semi
conductors such as silicon. Spin
tronics, however, focuses on the
magnetic alignment of individual
electrons. An electron's magnetic
state is characterized by its spin —
either "up" or "down". Aligning the
spin states of electrons in material
means that the material can be mag
netized. Furthermore, by applying a
magnetic field to this material, the
movement of its constituent elec
trons can also be changed.
Another interesting thought is
possibly exploiting spin coherence
— flipping one spin will flip anoth
er spin at the same time. This would
make instantaneous communica
tion and sensing over a finite dis
tance a possibility.
According to Wang, one of the
major issues facing silicon technolo
gy today is its heavy power con
sumption. Just last week, Intel an
nounced that it will discontinue its
Pentium 4 architecture line of de
velopment due to power consump
tion and energy efficiency limits.
Wang acknowledged the silicon
industry's ability to overcome the
numerous challenges of shrinking
device sizes for higher densities and
speed. He said that he believed,
however, that eventually, sizes will
reach the atomic scale where quan
tum theory dominates.
"The potential to utilize electron
spin [a quantum property] in semi
conductor technology certainly
represents an opportunity for de
vice physicists," he said.
"Spintronics spans a broad range
of research and studying the spin
property of an electron is intriguing
scientifically," Wang added.
For practical applications, de
vices based on electron spin have
already made an impact in magnet
ic storage and sensing.
For example, the giant magne
toresistance (OMR) head intro
duced in 1997 has resulted in a dras
tic increase in hard drive data densi
ty. Motorola and IBM are now ac
tively working on nonvolatile Mag
netic RAM as a commercial prod
uct in the near future.
Just three weeks ago, IBM Al
maden Research Center and Stan

ford University announced the for
mation of SpinAps, the IBM-Stan
ford Spintronic Science and Appli
cations Center.
Collaboration between Stanford
and IBM in this emerging field,
however, is nothing new.
"The formation of SpinAps is a
continuation of the growing inter
action between IBM Almaden Re
search and Stanford University
concerning research involving elec
tron spin," Wang said.
Dr. Stuart S. P. Parkin, one of
the major pioneers of the current
GMR read head, has been actively
pursuing collaboration with Stan
ford for spin-related research.
Parkin is an IBM Fellow and cour
tesy professor of applied physics at
Stanford.
Two students working with
Parkin have recently graduated
from Stanford with a doctorate in
Applied Physics. Both conducted
nearly all of their research at IBM
Almaden under Dr. Parkin's super
vision.
Wang is one of several graduate
students who conduct research at
IBM Almaden with Parkin. They
come from departments such as
Physics and Materials Science and
Engineering.
There are other Stanford stu
dents who are involved in SpinAps
but do not work directly at Al
maden. These students work on
campus under the guidance of Prof.
Shoucheng Zhang and Prof. James
Harris. Zhang is professor in the
Physics Department, while Harris is
a professor in the Electrical Engi
neering Department. Both of
them, along with Dr. Parkin, are the
co-directors of SpinAps.
One such student is Seth Bank, a
graduate student in electrical engi
neering. He works at the Hansen
Experimental Physics Laboratory.
Part of Prof. Harris' research group,
he grows high quality gallium ar
senide heterostructures used for
optical detection of spin.
Over at IBM Almaden, Wang
works on developing methods to
demonstrate spin injection into
semiconductors, and spin detection,
"all as stepping-stones to develop a
spintronic device," Wang said.
"My research involves growing
magnetic films and oxide materials
on semiconductors to form tunnel
spin injectors," Wang said. "We use
these structures to inject spin polar
ized electrons [a current of elec
trons with primarily one spin] into
the semiconductor, and also to de
tect the spin polarization of a cur
rent extracted from the semicon
ductor."
"Our final goal is to develop a
solid state spin device that can per
form functions similar to standard
transistors," he added.
On any given day, Wang could
be growing materials and film lay
ers for characterization and mea
surement, or building and main
taining a magnet / cryostat setup for
magnetic measurements at a range
of temperatures.
He could also be taking the mea
surements himself, which can be
optical measurements for detecting

spin injection or magnetoresistive
measurements for spin filtering ef
fects — changes in current or resis
tance of a junction device due to
magnetic alignment of metal films.
Wang is currently studying for
his doctoral degree in electrical en
gineering and plans to finish his
doctorate in spintronics-related re
search. While Wang's role may
seem like that of a typical graduate
student researcher, he has the
unique opportunity of working with
industry researchers, in addition to
professors and fellow students.
"I spend all my time at IBM, ex
cept when taking courses at Stan
ford," Wang said. "All my work is
done at IBM with both IBM em
ployees and other Stanford stu
dents."
Apart from individual assign
ments, Wang also gets to work as
part of a team. "Each project usual
ly involves two or three people.
When I began here, I had a mentor
to work with. Even though we are
each assigned to be responsible for
certain projects, several projects
overlap both in theoretical concepts
and experimental instruments."
"My projects tend to involve
magnetic materials, semiconduc
tors, and both electrical and optical
measurements," Wang said. "I
work with IBM employees who are
experts in optics and optical experi
mental equipment, while Dr.
Parkin is the expert in magnetic ma

terials and growth."
When Wang entered Stanford in
2001, he was searching fora poten
tial research group. His areas of in
terest included "organic wires/
electronics, spintronics, biotech,
and in general any nanotechnology
material or application," Wang
said.
He learnt from Harris that
Parkin was looking for more stu
dents to work on a variety of pro
jects related to spintronics at IBM
Almaden.
"I took the opportunity right
away, since my personal goal is to
be involved with industrial research
and development rather than
academia," Wang said. He began in
the summer after his first year, in
June 2002 and has been working at
IBM Almaden ever since.
Wang said he felt that the con
cept of a solid state spin-based
semiconductor device has a much
longer path to practical application.
"The research remains at an
early stage of development focus
ing on spin injection and detec
tion," Wang said. "Even a single,
operating transistor-like spin de
vice still remains theory rather than
reality."
"Realistically," he added, "a
working solid state spintronics de
vice, unlike in sensing and memory
applications, remains decades away
from becoming a practical commer
cial product."
