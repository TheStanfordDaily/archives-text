# Former high tech CEO running for state assembly, vows to rejuvenate Silicon Valley
## 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
Where would you expect to see a for
mer high tech CEO spending his days?
Probably not the White House, a class
room in East San Jose, or running for the
California State Assembly. Well, Stanford
Graduate School of Business alum Steve
Poizner defies expectations.
After selling his latest company at the
20-year mark in the private sector, Poizner
decided to give back. Since then, he has
been a White House Fellow, one of 12 se
lected from over 1000 annually; a volunteer
teacher at Mount Pleasant High School, a
public school in East San Jose; and the Re
publican candidate for the twenty-first as
sembly district.
Poizner studied electrical engineering at
the University of Texas at Austin. He re
ceived his MBA from the Stanford Graduate
School of Business in 1980.
"I've been spending most of my profes
sional career since 1980 starting and running
high tech companies," he said. "When 1 hit
the 20-year mark —20 years of running
companies in the private sector, I decided to
stand back fora second and reflect on what I
wanted to do next and I decided to spend the
next 20 years giving back and getting in
volved in public sector service and policy

making work."
"There are a lot of skills you develop in
the private sector in terms of putting teams
together and figuring out where to focus,
how to set priorities," Poizner said. "All
these skills are critically important in the
public sector too, but the public sector has
unique characteristics."
Poizner then set out to develop the
unique skills needed in public service.
"The first thing I did was apply fora
White House Fellowship, which is one of the
best public sector leadership training pro
grams," he said. "You spend one year work
ing for someone senior in the executive
branch, fora cabinet officer or someone se
nior in the White House."
Similar to choosing to sell his company
right before the dot com bubble burst, Poizn
er's move was timely.
"I was assigned to work in the National
Security Council in the counterterrorism
unit and started one week before 9 /11," he
said. "1 dealt extensively with Capital Hill
and the Washington press corps. 1 did a pre
sentation to the president of the United
States on some certain matters."
An interest in public education drove
Poizner to then volunteer as a twelfth grade
American government teacher at Mount
Pleasant High School fora year. After that,
he decided to run for office.

"I was awarded 'Rookie Teacher of the
Year' there, and I'm really proud of that be
cause of how difficult it was to parachute
into that kind of environment and somehow
figure out a way to get those students en
gaged," Poizner said. "That ended June, and
that's when I decided to run for the Califor
nia State Assembly, so I've been running for
this position for about eight or nine months
full time."
The district Poizner is running for in
cludes a much of Silicon Valley: Palo Alto,
Stanford, north to Redwood City and south
to Almaden Valley in San Jose.
Poizner spoke about how the GSB helped
prepare him for the business world.
"My Stanford Business School experi
ence has been critically important," he said.
"Not only does the business school have a re
ally nice blend of analytical training with
case study training which helps prepare not
only your analytical skills but also your abil
ity to think on your feet and defend positions
and be persuasive."
"It's a great business school and it really
opens up doors," Poizner said. "Other peo
ple in this area, around the country and
around the world recognize the quality of
getting an MBA from Stanford. Now once
the door is open, then it's up to you to do
something with that opportunity."
Poizner has three areas of focus: public

education, job creation and political reform.
"The California public education system
is in need of serious repair," he said. "Fifty
percent of all the fourth graders in this state
can not pass basic reading proficiency tests,
and that's just outrageous."
Currently, officials in Sacramento regu
late spending in districts around the state.
"I'm a big believer in local control and
I'm going to work hard in the legislature to
shift power from Sacramento back to the
local level," Poizner said.
He is concerned about the current eco
nomic situation in the Valley.
"Silicon Valley has really gone through a
melt-down with two hundred thousand jobs
lost in a three year period," he said. "It's
been a really deep crisis here, the worst eco
nomic collapse of any region of the country
since the Great Depression. You would
hope the legislature would begin to pass
rules and regulations that made it more at
tractive for businesses, not what they've
done which was turn outright hostile to the
business community."
Poizner will try to pass legislation that helps
more businesses move into the area. Addi
tionally, he wants to lead political reform.
"The existing politicians in Sacramento,
both Republicans and Democrats have con
spired together to create all these safe seats
through gerrymandering. The result of all

this is you get politicians who are elected
who don't really care what their constituents
think because their seats are safe. You get
these extreme left and extreme right people
who get elected."
"The Stanford community is one of the
crucial assets to this whole district," he said.
"One reason people like to start companies
around here is the access to the great intel
lectual horsepower of the students and facul
ty at Stanford."
However, the 21st district is typically a
Democratic seat and Poizner is running as a
Republican. His message is that he is not a
typical candidate.
"Part of my challenge is getting the word
out to people that I'm independent. I'm not
a partisan politician and part of the evi
dence of my independence is that I'm not
taking any political action committee
money, any special interest money, any
corporate money, any union money," he
said. "I'm only taking money to help run
my campaign from individuals. No other
politician in the state is doing something
like that now."
Poizner has received endorsements from
many recognizable names in business and
politics, including Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger and venture capitalist John
Doerr. among many others. Poizner spoke on
campus last night during a candidate debate.

Poizner has received endorsements from
many recognizable names in business and
politics, including Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger and venture capitalist John
Doerr. among many others. Poizner spoke on
campus last night during a candidate debate.
Where would you expect to see a for
mer high tech CEO spending his days?
Probably not the White House, a class
room in East San Jose, or running for the
California State Assembly. Well, Stanford
Graduate School of Business alum Steve
Poizner defies expectations.
After selling his latest company at the
20-year mark in the private sector, Poizner
decided to give back. Since then, he has
been a White House Fellow, one of 12 se
lected from over 1000 annually; a volunteer
teacher at Mount Pleasant High School, a
public school in East San Jose; and the Re
publican candidate for the twenty-first as
sembly district.
Poizner studied electrical engineering at
the University of Texas at Austin. He re
ceived his MBA from the Stanford Graduate
School of Business in 1980.
"I've been spending most of my profes
sional career since 1980 starting and running
high tech companies," he said. "When 1 hit
the 20-year mark —20 years of running
companies in the private sector, I decided to
stand back fora second and reflect on what I
wanted to do next and I decided to spend the
next 20 years giving back and getting in
volved in public sector service and policy

making work."
"There are a lot of skills you develop in
the private sector in terms of putting teams
together and figuring out where to focus,
how to set priorities," Poizner said. "All
these skills are critically important in the
public sector too, but the public sector has
unique characteristics."
Poizner then set out to develop the
unique skills needed in public service.
"The first thing I did was apply fora
White House Fellowship, which is one of the
best public sector leadership training pro
grams," he said. "You spend one year work
ing for someone senior in the executive
branch, fora cabinet officer or someone se
nior in the White House."
Similar to choosing to sell his company
right before the dot com bubble burst, Poizn
er's move was timely.
"I was assigned to work in the National
Security Council in the counterterrorism
unit and started one week before 9 /11," he
said. "1 dealt extensively with Capital Hill
and the Washington press corps. 1 did a pre
sentation to the president of the United
States on some certain matters."
An interest in public education drove
Poizner to then volunteer as a twelfth grade
American government teacher at Mount
Pleasant High School fora year. After that,
he decided to run for office.

"I was awarded 'Rookie Teacher of the
Year' there, and I'm really proud of that be
cause of how difficult it was to parachute
into that kind of environment and somehow
figure out a way to get those students en
gaged," Poizner said. "That ended June, and
that's when I decided to run for the Califor
nia State Assembly, so I've been running for
this position for about eight or nine months
full time."
The district Poizner is running for in
cludes a much of Silicon Valley: Palo Alto,
Stanford, north to Redwood City and south
to Almaden Valley in San Jose.
Poizner spoke about how the GSB helped
prepare him for the business world.
"My Stanford Business School experi
ence has been critically important," he said.
"Not only does the business school have a re
ally nice blend of analytical training with
case study training which helps prepare not
only your analytical skills but also your abil
ity to think on your feet and defend positions
and be persuasive."
"It's a great business school and it really
opens up doors," Poizner said. "Other peo
ple in this area, around the country and
around the world recognize the quality of
getting an MBA from Stanford. Now once
the door is open, then it's up to you to do
something with that opportunity."
Poizner has three areas of focus: public

education, job creation and political reform.
"The California public education system
is in need of serious repair," he said. "Fifty
percent of all the fourth graders in this state
can not pass basic reading proficiency tests,
and that's just outrageous."
Currently, officials in Sacramento regu
late spending in districts around the state.
"I'm a big believer in local control and
I'm going to work hard in the legislature to
shift power from Sacramento back to the
local level," Poizner said.
He is concerned about the current eco
nomic situation in the Valley.
"Silicon Valley has really gone through a
melt-down with two hundred thousand jobs
lost in a three year period," he said. "It's
been a really deep crisis here, the worst eco
nomic collapse of any region of the country
since the Great Depression. You would
hope the legislature would begin to pass
rules and regulations that made it more at
tractive for businesses, not what they've
done which was turn outright hostile to the
business community."
Poizner will try to pass legislation that helps
more businesses move into the area. Addi
tionally, he wants to lead political reform.
"The existing politicians in Sacramento,
both Republicans and Democrats have con
spired together to create all these safe seats
through gerrymandering. The result of all

this is you get politicians who are elected
who don't really care what their constituents
think because their seats are safe. You get
these extreme left and extreme right people
who get elected."
"The Stanford community is one of the
crucial assets to this whole district," he said.
"One reason people like to start companies
around here is the access to the great intel
lectual horsepower of the students and facul
ty at Stanford."
However, the 21st district is typically a
Democratic seat and Poizner is running as a
Republican. His message is that he is not a
typical candidate.
"Part of my challenge is getting the word
out to people that I'm independent. I'm not
a partisan politician and part of the evi
dence of my independence is that I'm not
taking any political action committee
money, any special interest money, any
corporate money, any union money," he
said. "I'm only taking money to help run
my campaign from individuals. No other
politician in the state is doing something
like that now."
