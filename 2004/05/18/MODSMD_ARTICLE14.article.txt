## Reevaluate noise ordinances 
### 
University noise ordinances prevent par
ties from occurring on the Sunday
nights of three-day weekends. This is a
rule that unfairly and needlessly limits
students' options on long weekends.
Stanford's policy is to enforce an 11 p.m. noise
ordinance Sunday through Thursday, and a 1 a.m.
noise ordinance on Friday and Saturday. This
policy holds without exception, so the Sunday
nights before Monday holidays lack campus-wide
events. This particularly affects students without
cars, who are stuck on campus for what is in
evitably a dead weekend night.
We encourage the University administration
to reconsider this policy. It does not seem unrea
sonable to ask that on the Sundays before Mon
day holidays the campus noise ordinance be ex
tended to 1 a.m., thereby allowing parties to take
place. This would not bother most residents or
community members living on campus, as the ma
jority of offices and workplaces are closed and
there are no classes the following day.
We would understand the University's posi-

tion if the ordinances were dictated by Santa
Clara county. However, Stanford sets its own
noise policies, distinct from those of Santa Clara.
Thus, changing the policy could be done without
requiring the approval of such an outside body.
At the very least, the University should pro
vide alternatives for students without means of
getting off campus on these Sunday nights. Per
haps it could charter the Movie Express — which
normally runs only on Fridays — on these nights.
Or it could encourage individual dorms to hold
small-scale, low-key events for its residents. This
would probably be most effective in freshman
dorms because while upperclassmen often have
— or know someone with — a car, freshmen lack
easy access to transportation to off-campus loca
tions and are most reliant on campus events.
Both of these options, however, would be
more expensive and require more work than a
simple change in the campus noise ordinances.
Therefore, it is our recommendation that the ad
ministration change its noise ordinance policy to
better accommodate students' needs.
