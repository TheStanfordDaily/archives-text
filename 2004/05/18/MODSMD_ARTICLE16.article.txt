## Reflections on a year abroad 
### DEVON MAYLIE 
Despite the facts that my pecorino
cheese and stracchetella gelato obses
sion and my pasta addiction have raised
my cholesterol level and that my per
petual desire to explore Florence and
the rest of Italy have hindered my the
sis progress, I would not trade my year
in Italy for anything. What originally
was supposed to be a two-quarter stint
has turned into a year because I could
not tear myself away from my host fam
ily, the food and the tiny alleyways be
tween Piazza Mentana and the Stan
ford Center. Seven months after my ar
rival and with only two months to go, I
have realized that the end is inevitable.
My Florence experience can be or
ganized into three categories: food,
people and art. When my memories
center on food, salame toscano imme
diately comes to mind. It is only dried
pork with pieces of diced fat and some
seasonings, but on slices of saltless
bread it is bliss for my taste buds, and I
frankly do not know what I am going to
do without the alimentari down the
street that feeds my daily consumption.
My host father introduced the dried
meat to me on one of our tri-monthly
trips to Vinci where he buys wine from
a small farmer, part of a dying breed of
Italians who produce artisan wine with
out any chemicals or additives. The
farmer was more on top of the U.S.
presidential primaries than I was.
However, my memories run deeper
than incredible gastronomic intake. In
a town that boasts the highest concen

tration of American students outside of
the United States, I like to think that I
have had a more Italian experience
than many of the other American stu
dents in the city.
The times I will always remember
are the moments spent drinking wine
and talking about politics with my host
father, the lectures — while climbing
the duomo where no tourists go —
with priest at the duomo and Art His
tory Prof. Timothy Verdon, news re
porting for an Italian radio station and
discussing with the station's director
the number of scantily-clad women
dancing around the talk show hosts
and the degeneration of free speech in
the Italian media system, and the
amazing trips and cultural events —
such as meeting Zubin Mehta and talk
ing about cricket after he conducted
Beethoven — made possible by Helen
Bing's generosity.
Last week, sitting under Michelan
gelo's sculpted bodies in the Sistine
Chapel on one of our Bing expedi
tions, I had time to ponder all the won
ders of Italy as Verdon's voice
boomed through the room — empty
except for us on our private tour of the
Vatican museums. It was not until
coming to Florence and living in the
center of Renaissance Italy that I
gained a better understanding and ap
preciation of art. I now look at David
slaying Goliath as more than just a
great piece of marble, but instead as a
symbol of the Florentine Republic
strength against the totalitarianism of
the Medici. The Medici eventually

took over, kind of like the overtake of
pecorino cheese on my body.
As much as I love walking past the
unfinished marble slaves leading up to
the David, it is the living people that
have left the largest impact on my year
abroad. I will always think of the man
who does my laundry and calls me
"bella" in the cute grandfatherly way,
not the nauseating street-call fashion;
of my host mamma who cooks up the
most incredible bowl of pasta, makes
me feel at home and gossips with us
about being young and going out; of
the amazing staff and faculty at the
Stanford center; of Italian friends and
motorino rides; and of the professor
who is guiding me on my thesis at
tempt and gives me endless books in
Italian to tackle.
At the end of June, I will depart for
home with the promise of returning.
But before 1 go. I will have one last
chance to drink a bottle of wine and
talk about politics with my Italian dad
after the European Parliament elec
tions, to eat a ten-euro bowl of gelato,
to drive a Smart car and to kiss my
friends goodbye on each cheek. It will
be foreign coming back to a two-party
system where things are not as compli
cated as AN, FI, Margherita and DS
and the pasta is not quite as al dente,
but I will have 4,145 digital pictures to
remind me of what is waiting for me
when I come back.

rival and with only two months to go, I
have realized that the end is inevitable.
My Florence experience can be or
ganized into three categories: food,
people and art. When my memories
center on food, salame toscano imme
diately comes to mind. It is only dried
pork with pieces of diced fat and some
seasonings, but on slices of saltless
bread it is bliss for my taste buds, and I
frankly do not know what I am going to
do without the alimentari down the
street that feeds my daily consumption.
My host father introduced the dried
meat to me on one of our tri-monthly
trips to Vinci where he buys wine from
a small farmer, part of a dying breed of
Italians who produce artisan wine with
out any chemicals or additives. The
farmer was more on top of the U.S.
presidential primaries than I was.
However, my memories run deeper
than incredible gastronomic intake. In
a town that boasts the highest concen

tration of American students outside of
the United States, I like to think that I
have had a more Italian experience
than many of the other American stu
dents in the city.
The times I will always remember
are the moments spent drinking wine
and talking about politics with my host
father, the lectures — while climbing
the duomo where no tourists go —
with priest at the duomo and Art His
tory Prof. Timothy Verdon, news re
porting for an Italian radio station and
discussing with the station's director
the number of scantily-clad women
dancing around the talk show hosts
and the degeneration of free speech in
the Italian media system, and the
amazing trips and cultural events —
such as meeting Zubin Mehta and talk
ing about cricket after he conducted
Beethoven — made possible by Helen
Bing's generosity.
Last week, sitting under Michelan
gelo's sculpted bodies in the Sistine
Chapel on one of our Bing expedi
tions, I had time to ponder all the won
ders of Italy as Verdon's voice
boomed through the room — empty
except for us on our private tour of the
Vatican museums. It was not until
coming to Florence and living in the
center of Renaissance Italy that I
gained a better understanding and ap
preciation of art. I now look at David
slaying Goliath as more than just a
great piece of marble, but instead as a
symbol of the Florentine Republic
strength against the totalitarianism of
the Medici. The Medici eventually

took over, kind of like the overtake of
pecorino cheese on my body.
As much as I love walking past the
unfinished marble slaves leading up to
the David, it is the living people that
have left the largest impact on my year
abroad. I will always think of the man
who does my laundry and calls me
"bella" in the cute grandfatherly way,
not the nauseating street-call fashion;
of my host mamma who cooks up the
most incredible bowl of pasta, makes
me feel at home and gossips with us
about being young and going out; of
the amazing staff and faculty at the
Stanford center; of Italian friends and
motorino rides; and of the professor
who is guiding me on my thesis at
tempt and gives me endless books in
Italian to tackle.
At the end of June, I will depart for
home with the promise of returning.
But before 1 go. I will have one last
chance to drink a bottle of wine and
talk about politics with my Italian dad
after the European Parliament elec
tions, to eat a ten-euro bowl of gelato,
to drive a Smart car and to kiss my
friends goodbye on each cheek. It will
be foreign coming back to a two-party
system where things are not as compli
cated as AN, FI, Margherita and DS
and the pasta is not quite as al dente,
but I will have 4,145 digital pictures to
remind me of what is waiting for me
when I come back.
