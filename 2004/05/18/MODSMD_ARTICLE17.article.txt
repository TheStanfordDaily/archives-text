## Cardinal Care costs explained 
### IRA M. FRIEDMAN RAY RIVERA 
A recent opinion piece by James
Metcalf ("Cardinal Care costs raise
questions," May 11) raises important
questions about the origins of increas
ing costs for Cardinal Care health in
surance. However, Metcalf is altogeth
er wrong in his assertion that the Uni
versity neither cares nor is doing any
thing about these rising costs.
We acknowledge that Cardinal
Care cost increases are distressing.
University officials have repeatedly
voiced their concern about this issue,
and the two-year-old subsidy for fund
ed graduate students and graduate stu
dent families speaks volumes about
University support.
The current success of Cardinal
Care is a product of hard work and a
collaborative process involving in
formed students and administration.
Cardinal Care is not, as some may per
ceive, a faceless bureaucratic monster
with a voracious appetite for students'
dollars. Cardinal Care's rates and ben
efits are carefully reviewed by the
Graduate Health Care Task Force, the
Vaden Health Insurance Committee,
Vaden's administration and top aim
pus administrators. It has become a
model for cooperative efforts address
ing issues important to students.
Stanford is not alone in its struggles
with rising premiums. All student in
surance plans nationwide are facing it.
Our peer institutions, for example, are
experiencing increases from 10 percent

to 29 percent for next year.
Where are these rising costs coming
from? Insurance fees paid to hospitals
for inpatient and outpatient care play a
major role. On our campus, students
express to us that they want specialty
care by Stanford faculty physicians at
Stanford Hospital and Clinics (SHC).
Cardinal Care makes this possible, an
option that is not available to most fac
ulty and staff. But this feature comes at
a price. Care at academic medical cen
ters such as SHC costs more than at
non-teaching hospitals because it in
cludes the cost of teaching and of treat
ing numerous complicated cases. Al
though the University and SHC are
linked, SHC insists that its fees cover its
costs, and the University cannot unilat
erally dictate what SHC shall charge.
New and expensive technology is
another factor related to increasing
Cardinal Care costs. Although stu
dents are generally healthy, in reality
they expend more health care re
sources than one might expect. For
example, MRI scans, expensive
emergency room visits and compre
hensive specialty work-ups are not at
all uncommon among our students.
Cardinal Care drug costs have gone
up by double digits each year recent
ly. Mental health costs have increased
too, pushed by mental health parity
legislation and a trend toward higher
acuity mental health problems
among students.
A carefully done comparison of
the cost and benefits of other plans
can uncover the tradeoffs that all plan

managers, including Vaden, face. For
example, UC-Berkeley's plan is less
expensive than Cardinal Care, but it
has no benefits comparable to our
most popular, comprehensive and
low out-of-pocket group of services
("Tier 1"). Searching for low-cost in
dividual insurance is not the answer
for many students. It requires an ap
plication and a health questionnaire,
whereby an applicant who has been ill
or injured previously is likely to be re
jected or denied coverage for pre-ex
isting conditions.
What does this mean for the future
of Cardinal Care? Clearly we must
continue our efforts to be as cost-effec
tive as possible. But a day may soon ar
rive when we can no longer afford all of
the benefits students currently enjoy.
More than ever, we need frank discus
sion among students and administra
tors to clarify which benefits are most
desired and how much students and
the University each are willing and able
to contribute. Our collaborative model
is a good one, and we believe that a
continued partnership of students and
administrators is the best way to pursue
the goal of high-quality health insur
ance at the lowest possible price.
