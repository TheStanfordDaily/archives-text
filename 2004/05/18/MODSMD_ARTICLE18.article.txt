## GCEP: Keep up the good work 
### BEN ABADI 
In November 2002, Stanford an
nounced the launch of the $225 million
Global Gimate and Energy Program
(GCEP). The initiative's initial spon
sors, ExxonMobil, General Electric and
Schlumberger, pledged their financial
support to research energy technologies
with reduced carbon emissions.
GCEP's launch met concerns and
criticism from Stanford students, facul
ty and alumni, as well as some outside
groups. The problem, according to
skeptics, was that GCEP would pro
vide the sponsors with the Stanford
name for public relations purposes,
while the program's governance and
allocation strategy reduced the likeli
hood of extensive funding for the most
promising energy technologies.
GCEP has come a long way toward
meeting these concerns over the past
18 months. GCEP's leadership has
held seminars and workshops to edu
cate itself and the Stanford community
about emerging energy technologies.
These workshops have included popu
lar areas such as wind power and tuel
cells, as well as carbon capture and se
questration. GCEP has also already
funded a nanotechnology solar power
project and fuel cell research. The ad
dition of Toyota as a sponsor company
increases the likelihood that end-use
energy efficiency will receive signifi
cant funding, particularly combined

with the mention of efficiency in the
GCEP contract.
The project has also taken impor
tant steps to clarify its governance and
to improve transparency. The current
contract with the sponsor companies is
openly available on the GCEP Web
site. The Faculty Steering Committee,
which includes a graduate student rep
resentative, is also listed online. And,
the recently selected Independent Ad
visory Committee will also soon be
made public. GCEP has filled out its
staffing to improve its administrative
capability to manage the project. The
hiring of Managing Director Richard
Sassoon gives Project Director Lynn
Orr and Deputy Director Chris Ed
wards the help they need. The addition
of a communications manager further
improves GCEP's stature while pro
tecting Stanford's image.
This additional staffing should help
GCEP address another pending con
cern: The project's mission is to "bring
together the world's leading scientists",
but to date the project has only consid
ered funding proposals from Stanford
faculty. However, GCEP leadership
has traveled extensively this past year
to identify institutions and researchers
outside of Stanford who can con
tribute, and it plans to fund external
proposals soon.
Outside of its mission to conduct
energy research, GCEP brings addi
tional benefits to Stanford. Accord

ing to Sassoon, the project funds 21
faculty members across 10 depart
ments, 14 postdoctoral students and
42 graduate students. GCEP research
also has a positive spillover effect on
teaching at Stanford since GCEP fac
ulty bring additional discussion on en
ergy topics to their courses. There are
also synergies between GCEP and
other faculty research. For example,
two professors who are funded by
GCEP contributed to the National
Research Council's recent report on
hydrogen as an energy carrier.
GCEP also brings Stanford to the
forefront of energy research, and gives
our University yet another area of
strength. GCEP's emphasis on low
carbon technologies also supports the
broader mission of Stanford's new In
stitute for the Environment.
Though GCEP is good for Stan
ford, it still has room for improvement.
The process by which research projects
are selected is not as transparent as it
should be, particularly since some crit
ics have expressed a need for more in
dependent funding decisions. Howev
er, despite the difficult challenges,
GCEP should be commended for its
progress, and encouraged to continue
working to enhance its creditability
and efficacy.
