## It really doesn't hurt to say hello 
### 
Blonde highlights. I hate to say it, but it was
those frosted tips that caught my eye as I
biked down the South Campus slope. A
close second, but I'm sure the first im
pression for those who aren't obsessed with sun
goldened locks, was his size, an impressive 6-foot
6. Slightly braking to let the moment linger, I
looked at his face, just to make sure of the demi
god I was in the presence of. Coasting down to
class at 10:03 a.m. this past Thursday, 1 couldn't
help but smile at Casey Jacobsen.
Casey Jacobsen, for those of you who didn't
watch Stanford basketball before Joe Kirchofer
(whom I hugged at Exotic Erotic, precipitating a
moment of homoerotic awkwardness) decided to
pull a little senior magic out of his sideburns, was
the story of my Stanford existence freshman year.
He was the player, the man, the reason for being.
Still at a psychological maturity level where anything on
TV was automatically something to be praised, my
freshman year was full of Casey. I made signs, sent e
mails, privately cursed the girl in my dorm who was

lucky enough to have him as her
Spanish partner (who just thought he
was"a cute guy" until an ESPN cam
era crew showed up in class one
morning ... jCaramba!). Hell, I even
tried to organize a Branner party
with the theme "Casey is God".
But 1 never met him.
Now, don't read the last few
lines and think I'm some kind of
nutty stalker, tracking down bas
ketball players until they are half
naked and vulnerable to inappro-

priate touching (in Joe's case, a man-hug). Half of
this I say in jest.
But to tell the truth, this got me thinking. If I
saw Casey Jacobsen on the street, walking down
Van Ness Ave. in San Francisco, I'd give him a lit
tle shout, maybe shake his hand. I wouldn't ask for
his autograph, mostly because I think the practice
is unnecessarily painful for all parties, and because
every signed hat, ticket, or bodypart I have ever
gotten got lost within 17 hours. But I'd at least rec
ognize his presence, thank him for his efforts and
leave it at that. For instance, when I saw a di
sheveled Steve Young in the Minneapolis / St. Paul
airport, I casually shook his hand, thanking him for
having such a positive influence on my childhood.
I thought it was classy. He probably thought it
was benevolent.
Either way, it was chill.
But while on the Stanford campus, at parties, in
class, breaking the post-office door, we are sur
rounded by future celebrities, some more obvious
than others. Am I supposed to pretend I don't rec
ognize Josh Childress? Do you think I can just ca
sually ignore Teyo Johnson? Am I allowed to
thank Casey Jacobsen for having such a positive
influence on my freshman year?
I get the idea that most of you think it's not
chill, that I should just stick to giving out cold
shoulders, that my congratulatory gestures are
best kept to myself. I'm not the only one who gets
this impression.
"I feel like the students on this campus, especial
ly compared to other (universities], are very
grounded," said sophomore point guard Chris Her
nandez.
Hernandez, one of the more recognizable stu
dents on campus thanks to his leadership through
out the basketball team's incredible season, noted
the lack of student recognition so prevalent in our
humble university.
"I don't get a lot of people coming up to me
asking for my autograph. I mean, there have been
a few, here and there, but nothing crazy, like it
would be at other schools . . . Everyone here has
their own thing that they are into and really good
at, and it's not like the Midwest 'Oh my God! Oh
my God!' [student-fan mentality], which can be
kind of nice."
Stanford students show deference, feigning
non-interest in the seven-footer walking beside
them, or the tennis star they saw in The Daily last
week. They show that cold shoulder â€” the num
ber one reason why I didn't even bother applying
to Harvard or Yale.
To sum it all up, let me just say this:
I went to a hippy high school. We did yoga dur
ing class, took three arts electives at a time and, as
a senior, gave a 5-10 minute speech in front of the
entire school. Everyone had their moment in the
sun, because in the Yay Area, there is a lot of it to
go around. Keep it shining, Stanford.
If you see someone who you appreciate, let
them know. Say thanks. Say good game. Say, "My
roommate wants to hook up with you!" And it
doesn't have to be athletes. It can be the guy 10
rows ahead of you in Chem lecture; it can be the
girl you never had the courage to ask out freshman
year; it can even be Friday columnist Julie Ruvolo.
Yes. even Julie.
Don't pretend you don't recognize that guy
from your IHUM section. You do, and he recog
nizes you too.
Say hello. It's chill.
But I was too much of a wuss while biking last
Thursday. I could only muster up a smile for Casey
Jacobsen.
He smiled back, perhaps due to the golf-ball
sized hickey on my neck, but I'd like to think it's
because somehow, in the vast network of Stanford
students, he has read my column, seen my picture
and wanted to thank me for having a positive in
fluence on his life.
Maybe.
Next time, I'll ask him fora man-hug.

Send men's soccer goalkeeper Spencer Porter some
walk-on love at porters@stanford.edu. He'll even hug
you if you 're a girl (lucky you!).
