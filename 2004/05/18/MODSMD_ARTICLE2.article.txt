# Mountain lion killed in PA
## 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
A mountain lion was dis
patched early yesterday after
noon in a residential Palo Alto
neighborhood after two sight
ings of the lion earlier that day.
The lion, an adult male cat
weighing approximately 108
pounds, was killed by one shot
from a rifle gun.
However, it is not certain
that this mountain lion is
the same one that has been
sighted in the Stanford
foothills over the past few
weeks, said Detective Kara
Apple of the Palo Alto Police
Department (PAPD).
"There is no way to tell un
less there are eyewitnesses that
can talk about distinct markings,
so at this point we can't say if it's
the same mountain lion that at
tacked the horse or has been
seen in the lower foothills,"
Apple said. "Even our naturalist
can not positively connect them
at this time."
She also said that the possi
bility that there are more moun
tain lions in the foothills could
not be ruled out.
"The mountain lion got to
the neighborhood through our
creek system," Apple said. "It's
alarming that they're in our
foothills, and even more alarm
ing that they found their way
into the neighborhoods."
According to a press release
from the PAPD, the decision to

immediately dispatch the moun
tain lion was made after consult
ing the California Department
of Fish and Game, Morgan Hill
Police Department, and taking
into consideration the neighbor
hood and the fact that two near
by elementary schools would
dismiss students within the hour.
The mountain lion was first
spotted yesterday at 4:45 am in
the 500 block of Coleridge. The
second sighting was at Cedar
and Parkinson at 5:40 a.m.
With assistance from Stan
ford Department of Public Safe
ty, Mountain View Police, East
Palo Alto Police, Menlo Park
Police and CHP fixed wing Pi
lots, Palo Alto police officers
conducted an immediate search
of the area.
At approximately 12:10 p.m.
gardeners working at 941
Newell Street saw the mountain
lion run from the rear yard over
a fence. Police officers then
tightened their perimeter patrol
units around the 900 block of
Newell Road and proceeded to
search yard-to-yard.
According to Park, at this
time, the PAPD began notifying
residents of the surrounded area
using the telephone alert sys
tem, an automatic dialing sys
tem that dials residents and
gives them a recorded message.
"Most of them probably al
ready knew by then because of
all the police cars and camera
crews in the neighborhood," she said.
At approximately 1:06 p.m., the mountain
lion was spotted in a tree in front of 1525 Wal
nut Drive near a perimeter post. It was then
that the lion was immediately dispatched.
A full necropsy of the lion will be con
ducted by the California Department of
Fish and Game.
