# No. 1 Card burned in desert
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
In Sunday night's unreal 19-18 loss to
Arizona, the No. 1 Cardinal baseball
team simply exhausted its bullpen. A
group often praised for its depth and
poise despite its youth wavered and then
crumbled in the contest, leaving only
three hurlers unused for yesterday after
noon's rubber game.
Stanford (39-10, 12-6 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) needed some against-all-odds perfor
mances and a little bit of luck to avoid its
second consecutive series loss.
The Cardinal got neither.
The Wildcats (26-22-1, 9-9) destroyed
Stanford's remaining pitchers, connecting
for 16 hits in an 11-2 victory. The defeat
gives the Cardinal its first back-to-back loss
es of the season and also strips Stanford of
its Pac-10 lead for the first time this season.
Washington took two-of-three from South
ern California over the weekend to assume
the top spot.
Freshman Matt Leva got the starting
nod and tossed three scoreless innings be
fore running into trouble in the fourth.
Leva allowed two runs in the inning before
fanning Arizona centerfielder Derek De
cater to prevent any further damage.
The best that can be said about the fifth in
ning was that it did eventually come to an end.
Four rookie Stanford pitchers took the
mound in the fifth frame. Freshman Blake
Holler — who also pitched two innings on
Saturday night — relieved a struggling Leva
and recorded the first out of the inning, but

was yanked two hatters later, after the Wild
cats smashed two hits and put up two runs.
The Greg Reynolds experiment was
even more short-lived, as the freshman
righthander plunked the first batter he
faced and walked the second before being
pulled in favor of freshman Jeff Stimpson.
Stimpson became only the third Cardinal
pitcher of the series to throw more than
three innings, as he scattered eight hits and
three runs over yesterday's 3 2/3-inning
stint, his second outing of the weekend.
Stimpson finished the game off for Stanford
in fairly solid fashion, but the fifth inning
damage was beyond repair.
The Cardinal offense was swinging its
typically smoking bats but, despite its 11
base knocks, could not plate more than
two runs in the game. Stanford left 10 men
on base.
Junior designated hitter Chris Carter
went 4-for-4 with a run scored, while se
nior leadoff hitter Sam Fuld and sopho
more shortstop Chris Minaker each had a
pair of hits.
Of course, those numbers look less im
pressive when dropped in next to the offen
sive stats of the Wildcats. Arizona's offense
— which scored an astounding 39 runs on 48
hits over the course of the weekend — was
propelled by three-hit games from three dif
ferent players. Only one Wildcats starter —
rightfielder Jeff Van Houten — failed to
collect a hit.
The Cardinal plays its fourth game in as
many days tonight at Sunken Diamond
against San Francisco. Game time is set for
6 p.m.
