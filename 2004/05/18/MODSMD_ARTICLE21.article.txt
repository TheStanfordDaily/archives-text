Watch out, Oklahoma.
The No. 9 Stanford men's ten
nis team is set to do some serious
damage in Tulsa for the remain
der of the NCAA Championships
after routing Pacific and No. 23
Washington in the first and sec
ond rounds of NCAA play last
weekend on the Farm.
It was clear early on in Satur
day's match that unranked Pacific
didn't stand a chance against
Stanford's best. The match lasted
less than three hours and was
taken by the Cardinal with little
resistance, 4-0.
The doubles teams were
first to take the courts, with
the No. 35 duo of senior team
captain Carter Morris and ju
nior Sam Warburg taking on
Pacific's Lennart Maack and
Niclas Otte. A few serve-and
volleys later, Morris / War
burg walked off court one with
an 8-2 win.
At the No. 2 spot, sopho

more K.C. Corkery and junior
Phil Sheng took an early lead
and quickly followed their
teammates' win with a victory of
their own. Corkery / Sheng
dealt an 8-3 loss to the Tigers'
Michael Duong and Vladimir
Zdravkovic to clinch the dou
bles point for the Cardinal.
Sophomore James Pade
and freshman James Wan
were down 0-5 in their match
against Pacific's Tyler Black
and Arnar Sigurdsson but re
gained their composure and
climbed back up to even out
the match at 5-5. The match
was stopped after that point
when Corkery / Sheng won
the doubles point.
The Stanford players made
quick work of the Tigers in singles
play, taking the remaining three
points with ease.
All-American No. 65 Cork
ery was first to leave the courts
with a win against Sigurdsson.
Relaxed and in control
throughout the match, Cork
ery tallied several aces and

quickly steamrolled Sigurds
son, 6-1, 6-1.
Morris followed suit by dis
patching Pacific's Otte, 6-1,6-2, at
the No. 5 spot.
At the No. 1 spot, it was a
showdown between the Pac-10
Player of the Year and the Big
West Conference Player of the
Year. No. 8 Warburg showed top
rate skill both at the net and base
line as Pacific's Maack was unable
to keep stride. Warburg trounced
Maack. 6-3,6-2, clinching the first
round win for the Cardinal.
Stanford's Sheng was on a roll
in the No. 3 spot and was leading
Duong, 6-2,4-4, when the match
was called after Warburg sealed
the Tigers' fate.
Pade was also up in the first set
against Zdravkovic but was cut
short at 6-4, 4-4, while freshman
Chris Rasmussen was one point
away from winning his 6-3, 5-4
match at the No. 6spot against Pa
cific's Tyler Black.
Beautiful Stanford weather
seemed to inspire beautiful Stan
ford tennis on Sunday. The

Huskies put up a ferocious fight
against the Cardinal, leaving fans
unsure who would win until the
final moments of play.
The Cardinal players strug
gled during doubles action, as
all teams had a slow start in
their matches.
Morris / Warburg lagged be
hind early on in the match against
the No. 19 team of Daniel Chu
and Alex Vlaski. The Stanford
duo was down, 7-4, but made a
phenomenal comeback to win the
match, 9-7.
"We were down pretty much
the whole time [during the match J
and at the last minute, in absolute
desperation, we put a couple shots
together and got a little bit lucky,"
Warburg said. "They started
missing a little bit, and [that] just
kind of turned it around. We start
ed rolling a little bit and then we
got some confidence going and
made some shots and it turned
our way."
On court three, Pade/Wan
struggled to keep their ground
against Christoph Palmanshofer

and Peter Scharler. The duo
made a strong showing at the end
of the match but was unable to
pull past the Huskies, suffering an
8-6 defeat.
The fate of the doubles point
rested in the hands of Corkery /
Sheng on court two, and fora
while it looked as if the Stanford
pair had the win clinched. They
were up 7-5 against Washing
ton's Alex Slovic and Nick
Weiss, but everything went
downhill from there. The Stan
ford duo seemed sluggish during
the crucial last point, handing
the Huskies a 9-7 win and the
doubles point.
"Losing that doubles point
was gigantic," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "We really
thought the doubles point was re
ally important today."
It was up to the singles players
to pull off four wins to overcome
the doubles disappointment and
win the match.
