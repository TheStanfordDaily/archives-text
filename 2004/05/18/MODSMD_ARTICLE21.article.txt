The No. 9 Stanford men's ten
nis team is set to do some serious
damage in Tulsa for the remain
der of the NCAA Championships
after routing Pacific and No. 23
Washington in the first and sec
ond rounds of NCAA play last
weekend on the Farm.
It was clear early on in Satur
day's match that unranked Pacific
didn't stand a chance against
Stanford's best. The match lasted
less than three hours and was
taken by the Cardinal with little
resistance, 4-0.
The doubles teams were
first to take the courts, with
the No. 35 duo of senior team
captain Carter Morris and ju
nior Sam Warburg taking on
Pacific's Lennart Maack and
Niclas Otte. A few serve-and
volleys later, Morris / War
burg walked off court one with
an 8-2 win.
At the No. 2 spot, sopho

more K.C. Corkery and junior
Phil Sheng took an early lead
and quickly followed their
teammates' win with a victory of
their own. Corkery / Sheng
dealt an 8-3 loss to the Tigers'
Michael Duong and Vladimir
Zdravkovic to clinch the dou
bles point for the Cardinal.
Sophomore James Pade
and freshman James Wan
were down 0-5 in their match
against Pacific's Tyler Black
and Arnar Sigurdsson but re
gained their composure and
climbed back up to even out
the match at 5-5. The match
was stopped after that point
when Corkery / Sheng won
the doubles point.
The Stanford players made
quick work of the Tigers in singles
play, taking the remaining three
points with ease.
All-American No. 65 Cork
ery was first to leave the courts
with a win against Sigurdsson.
Relaxed and in control
throughout the match, Cork
ery tallied several aces and

quickly steamrolled Sigurds
son, 6-1, 6-1.
Morris followed suit by dis
patching Pacific's Otte, 6-1,6-2, at
the No. 5 spot.
At the No. 1 spot, it was a
showdown between the Pac-10
Player of the Year and the Big
West Conference Player of the
Year. No. 8 Warburg showed top
rate skill both at the net and base
line as Pacific's Maack was unable
to keep stride. Warburg trounced
Maack. 6-3,6-2, clinching the first
round win for the Cardinal.
Stanford's Sheng was on a roll
in the No. 3 spot and was leading
Duong, 6-2,4-4, when the match
was called after Warburg sealed
the Tigers' fate.
Pade was also up in the first set
against Zdravkovic but was cut
short at 6-4, 4-4, while freshman
Chris Rasmussen was one point
away from winning his 6-3, 5-4
match at the No. 6spot against Pa
cific's Tyler Black.
Beautiful Stanford weather
seemed to inspire beautiful Stan
ford tennis on Sunday. The

Huskies put up a ferocious fight
against the Cardinal, leaving fans
unsure who would win until the
final moments of play.
The Cardinal players strug
gled during doubles action, as
all teams had a slow start in
their matches.
Morris / Warburg lagged be
hind early on in the match against
the No. 19 team of Daniel Chu
and Alex Vlaski. The Stanford
duo was down, 7-4, but made a
phenomenal comeback to win the
match, 9-7.
"We were down pretty much
the whole time [during the match J
and at the last minute, in absolute
desperation, we put a couple shots
together and got a little bit lucky,"
Warburg said. "They started
missing a little bit, and [that] just
kind of turned it around. We start
ed rolling a little bit and then we
got some confidence going and
made some shots and it turned
our way."
On court three, Pade/Wan
struggled to keep their ground
against Christoph Palmanshofer

and Peter Scharler. The duo
made a strong showing at the end
of the match but was unable to
pull past the Huskies, suffering an
8-6 defeat.
The fate of the doubles point
rested in the hands of Corkery /
Sheng on court two, and fora
while it looked as if the Stanford
pair had the win clinched. They
were up 7-5 against Washing
ton's Alex Slovic and Nick
Weiss, but everything went
downhill from there. The Stan
ford duo seemed sluggish during
the crucial last point, handing
the Huskies a 9-7 win and the
doubles point.
"Losing that doubles point
was gigantic," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "We really
thought the doubles point was re
ally important today."
It was up to the singles players
to pull off four wins to overcome
the doubles disappointment and
win the match.
Corkery bounced back from his earlier
match to exact revenge upon Slovic with a
6-3,6-2 victory.
Court one saw two of the top
NCAA players go head-to-head. No.
10 Vlaski made great attempts to give
Warburg a difficult match, but his ef
forts were to no avail. Warburg won,
6-3,6-2.
On court six, Morris did his part for
the team by claiming a 6-4, 6-4 victory
over Washington's Weiss, and with Stan

ford up 3-1 in the match, the finalizing
point could come from Pade, Sheng or
Wan. All three players had lost the first
sets of their matches, and the stakes were
high as the Huskies seemed poised to
upset the Cardinal.
Stanford's Sheng had the crowd cheer
ing him on in full force as he bounced back
from a 6-1 first-set loss to even up the sec
ond set at 6-6 against Palmanshofer. But
Sheng's comeback fell short, and the
Washington junior collected a narrow 6-1,
7-6 victory.
Wan came back from a 6-3 first-set
loss to even the field with a 6-3 sec
ond-set win against Washington's
Chu. He was up 4-1 in the third set,
but play was stopped short by tremen
dous amounts of excited shouts from
the audience.

The yelling and arm-waving was com
ing from the direction of court five, where
Pade had just clinched the second-round
win for Stanford. Washington's Scharler
had taken the first set, 6-3, but Pade domi
nated the second to take the match to a
third set. Pade was down, 5-4, and it looked
as if the match was lost, but he fought back
to a 3-6,6-2,7-5 win and a spirited celebra
tion ensued.
"I kind of knew I could win it all
the whole time, [but] if things didn't
go my way, I could've lost, and I knew
that also," Pade said. "I knew if 1 put
myself in the points I'd have a shot. I
was really confident through the
whole [third] set. I knew I had to hold
serve and knew 1 had opportunities to
break serve."
"I thought the guys really came back

hard when their backs were against the
wall," Gould said. "No one we play is
going to be an awful lot better than
[Washington]. They could've done
some damage in the tournament. I real
ly like how we battled back in the
match today."
Washington head coach Matt
Anger expressed his disappointment in
losing, but also offered Stanford his
vote of support.
"I want to play more today and
more next week, but that's what
makes the NCAA tournament so spe
cial," Anger said. "The matches make
or break your season, and right now
it's pretty painful losing this match.
I'm proud of our guys and the way
they fought, but we're rooting for
Stanford now."

match at the No. 6spot against Pa

Beautiful Stanford weather
seemed to inspire beautiful Stan
ford tennis on Sunday. The

Huskies put up a ferocious fight
against the Cardinal, leaving fans
unsure who would win until the
final moments of play.
The Cardinal players strug
gled during doubles action, as
all teams had a slow start in
their matches.
Morris / Warburg lagged be
hind early on in the match against
the No. 19 team of Daniel Chu
and Alex Vlaski. The Stanford
duo was down, 7-4, but made a
phenomenal comeback to win the
match, 9-7.
"We were down pretty much
the whole time [during the match J
and at the last minute, in absolute
desperation, we put a couple shots
together and got a little bit lucky,"
Warburg said. "They started
missing a little bit, and [that] just
kind of turned it around. We start
ed rolling a little bit and then we
got some confidence going and
made some shots and it turned
our way."
On court three, Pade/Wan
struggled to keep their ground
against Christoph Palmanshofer

and Peter Scharler. The duo
made a strong showing at the end

pull past the Huskies, suffering an
8-6 defeat.
The fate of the doubles point
rested in the hands of Corkery /
Sheng on court two, and fora
while it looked as if the Stanford
pair had the win clinched. They
were up 7-5 against Washing
ton's Alex Slovic and Nick
Weiss, but everything went
downhill from there. The Stan
ford duo seemed sluggish during
the crucial last point, handing
the Huskies a 9-7 win and the
doubles point.
"Losing that doubles point
was gigantic," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "We really
thought the doubles point was re

It was up to the singles players
to pull off four wins to overcome
the doubles disappointment and
win the match.
Corkery bounced back from his earlier
match to exact revenge upon Slovic with a
6-3,6-2 victory.
Court one saw two of the top

10 Vlaski made great attempts to give
Warburg a difficult match, but his ef
forts were to no avail. Warburg won,
6-3,6-2.
On court six, Morris did his part for
the team by claiming a 6-4, 6-4 victory
over Washington's Weiss, and with Stan

ford up 3-1 in the match, the finalizing
point could come from Pade, Sheng or
Wan. All three players had lost the first
sets of their matches, and the stakes were
high as the Huskies seemed poised to
upset the Cardinal.
Stanford's Sheng had the crowd cheer
ing him on in full force as he bounced back
from a 6-1 first-set loss to even up the sec
ond set at 6-6 against Palmanshofer. But
Sheng's comeback fell short, and the
Washington junior collected a narrow 6-1,
7-6 victory.
Wan came back from a 6-3 first-set
loss to even the field with a 6-3 sec
ond-set win against Washington's
Chu. He was up 4-1 in the third set,
but play was stopped short by tremen
dous amounts of excited shouts from
the audience.

The yelling and arm-waving was com

Pade had just clinched the second-round
win for Stanford. Washington's Scharler
had taken the first set, 6-3, but Pade domi
nated the second to take the match to a
third set. Pade was down, 5-4, and it looked
as if the match was lost, but he fought back
to a 3-6,6-2,7-5 win and a spirited celebra
tion ensued.
"I kind of knew I could win it all
the whole time, [but] if things didn't
go my way, I could've lost, and I knew
that also," Pade said. "I knew if 1 put
myself in the points I'd have a shot. I
was really confident through the

had taken the first set, 6-3, but Pade domi
nated the second to take the match to a
third set. Pade was down, 5-4, and it looked
as if the match was lost, but he fought back
to a 3-6,6-2,7-5 win and a spirited celebra
tion ensued.
"I kind of knew I could win it all
the whole time, [but] if things didn't
go my way, I could've lost, and I knew
that also," Pade said. "I knew if 1 put
myself in the points I'd have a shot. I
was really confident through the
whole [third] set. I knew I had to hold
serve and knew 1 had opportunities to
break serve."
"I thought the guys really came back

hard when their backs were against the
wall," Gould said. "No one we play is
going to be an awful lot better than
[Washington]. They could've done
some damage in the tournament. I real
ly like how we battled back in the
match today."
Washington head coach Matt
Anger expressed his disappointment in
losing, but also offered Stanford his
vote of support.
"I want to play more today and
more next week, but that's what
makes the NCAA tournament so spe
cial," Anger said. "The matches make
or break your season, and right now
it's pretty painful losing this match.
I'm proud of our guys and the way
they fought, but we're rooting for
Stanford now."
