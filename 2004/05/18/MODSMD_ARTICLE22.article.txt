# Women's track second, men sixth at Pac-10s
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Pacific-10 Conference has histori
cally produced some of the top track and
field athletes in the nation, and this year's
championships were no exception. Ath
letes from around the conference made top
national marks in almost every event, in
cluding four nation-leading marks.
In the team competition, the Cardinal
women scored a school-record 153 points
but came up 21.50 points short against one
of the best UCLA teams ever assembled.
This marked the eighth consecutive title for
the Bruin women, who have lost only one
conference championship in school history.
"Overall, we did really well," said Stan
ford women's head coach Edrick Floreal.
"We made a decision to go after the team
title. You're going to get some good breaks
and some bad ones. We lost about 18
points somewhere.
"I am very happy that we had a legiti
mate chance to win, but UCLA is a great
team that has people who are going to step
up," Floreal continued.
Despite their second-place finish, the
Stanford women had a lot to celebrate, as
three Stanford athletes captured Pac-10 titles.
Redshirt sophomore Alicia Criag won
the 10,000 meters in a pedestrian 36 min
utes, 4.95 seconds, while sophomore Anita
Siraki placed third.
Senior Jillian Camarena claimed the
Pac-10 title in the shot put with a mark of 57
feet, 10.25 inches, out-throwing Southern
California star L'Orangerie Crawford and
UCLA rival Jessica Crosby, who upset Ca
marena at last year's championships.
In the 5,000, junior Sara Bei led a 1-
2-3 sweep by the Cardinal. Bei finished
in 16:35.39, with Craig just 0.01 sec
onds behind her. Competing in the

5,000 for the first time, freshmen Ari
Lambie and Katy Trotter finished
third and fifth, respectively.
Sophomore Nashonme Johnson broke
the school record in the 400 twice over the
weekend, running 52.96 in the preliminary
rounds on Friday and a 52.40 to finish
fourth in the finals on Saturday.
"1 always thought she could run 51.50 or
so," Floreal said. "I think she is beginning to
believe she can run that fast. Mindset and
confidence is a big part of this."
Meanwhile, in the shorter sprints, fresh
man Janice Davis tied Olympian Chryste
Gaines' freshman 100-meter record, set in
1989, by running 11.54. Davis moves into
second place all-time at Stanford behind
Gaines' performance during her senior year.
Davis finished fourth in the 100 and fifth
in the 200, running a personal-best 23.64 in
the 200.
In the 800, freshman Ashley Freeman
and sophomore Chinny Offor finished
second and third in 2:07.46 and 2:07.67,
respectively, while freshman twins Katy
and Amanda Trotter finished second
and sixth, respectively, in the 3,000-
meter steeplechase.
Junior Undine Becker finished second in
the long jump and fourth in the triple jump,
recording the No. 2 jump in school history in
her first try at the event this season.
The men had some successful perfor
mances over the weekend as well, but fin
ished only sixth in the conference as a team
with a disappointing 56 points. The men
had finished in the top three and with over
100 points in their previous four Pac-10s.
After winning all five distance races and
scoring nearly 90 points last year, the dis
tance squad, often considered one of the
greatest collegiate distance teams ever as
sembled, scored only 36 points and failed to
win a single event, coming up just seconds

short in race after race.
"Expectations on the distance and
middle-distance runners are always going
to be huge," said men's head coach
Robert Weir. "This year, though, if the
distance group faltered here or there,
there was no one else in other events to
pick up those points."
Arizona sophomore Robert Cheseret
completed an unprecedented triple, win
ning the 1,500,5,000 and 10,000 during the
two-day meet. The Kenyan native is the
brother of Bernard Lagat, one of the best
1,500-meter runners in the world.
Redshirt junior Chris Emme finished
second in his first 10.000 of the season in a
time of 30:26.47, less than two seconds off
of Cheseret's pace.
Former NCAA 1,500-meter champion
Don Sage, a redshirt junior, finished a
close second in his marquee event, just 0.5
seconds behind Cheseret.
The 5,000 finished in the same way,
with Cheseret out-kicking redshirt junior
lan Dobson by about a second. Senior
Louis Luchini, the reigning NCAA run
ner-up at the event, finished third.
Dobson also placed second in his first
3,000-meter steeplechase race of the sea
son with a time of 8:48.20, just behind Ari
zona State's Aaron Aguayo, who finished
in 8:47.69.
Outside the distance squad, there
were several other solid marks by Stan
ford athletes.
Junior Nick Sebes became the No. 4
400 runner in school history after posting
a 46.20 in the preliminary rounds. Sebes
finished sixth in the final that saw two of
the top four times in the nation run by the
Arizona State duo of Lewis Banda and
Jason Barton.
In the 100, junior Stanley Wilson contin
ued to prove that his win at the Big Meet

was no fluke. Wilson finished fifth and set a
personal-best of 10.46 after only three
weeks of training and is now tied for third
best in school history.
The men's relays also posted their first
regional qualifying marks of the year.
The 400 relay ran 40.26 for fourth-place.
It was the fourth-best performance in
school history.

Senior Jay Goff placed seventh in
the javelin at the 2004 Pac-10
Championships.
In the 1,600 relay, the team again posted the fourth-best time
in school history, running 3:07.53 for sixth place.
Sophomore Solomon Welch paced the Cardinal in the field
events with a sixth-place finish in the triple-jump while senior Jay
Goff finished a solid seventh in the javelin.
The Cardinal now has a weekend off to prepare for the NCAA
West Region Championships, which will be held at Cal State-
Northridge on May 27-28. TTiere, the Cardinal will look to quali
fy more athletes for the NCAA Championships than ever before
