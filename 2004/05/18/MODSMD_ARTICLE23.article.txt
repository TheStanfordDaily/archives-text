# Baseball set to begin home stretch
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Before the top-ranked Stanford baseball
team embarked on its recent four-games-in
four-days adventure turned misadventure,
head coach Mark Marquess addressed the po
tential pitching concerns that the unorthodox
schedule could present.
"We'll do whatever we have to do for the
leagu,e and then whoever hasn't thrown we'll
have them go Tuesday," Marquess said.
What Marquess couldn't foresee and the
problem for Stanford (39-10,12-6 Pacific-10
Conference) heading into tonight's final
non-conference game of the season against
San Francisco (26-29,13-14 West Coast Con
ference) is that just about everyone threw in
the desert.
Freshman Greg Reynolds pitched to just
two batters in yesterday's 11-2 loss and is
probably as likely a candidate as anyone to
get some work tonight. Marquess used seven
different pitchers in last Tuesday's 3-1 win
over Santa Clara.
While who takes the mound for the Cardi
nal tonight remains anybody's guess, what is

certain is that Stanford is happy to be home.
After dropping two-of-three on the road
fora second consecutive weekend to fall out
of the top spot in the Pac-10 standings, the
Cardinal will play its final seven games of the
regular season at Sunken Diamond. A win
tonight would give the Cardinal some much
needed momentum with Southern California
coming to town fora three-game series begin
ning Friday.
Meanwhile, the Dons are coming off a se
ries sweep of conference foe Portland,
capped by a 14-2 blowout on Sunday in
which San Francisco exploded for 12 runs in
the fifth inning.
Junior Cy Donald led the Dons' offensive
attack against the Pilots, going 7-for-13 with a
double and five RBI, while senior shortstop
Armand Gaerlan brings a San Francisco
record 23-game hit streak into tonight's game.
Gaerlan has raised his average to .356 and is
second on the team with 39 RBI.
Led by sixth-year head coach Nino Giar
ratano, who knows plenty about Stanford
from his two years as an assistant coach at
Arizona State, the Dons lost just one position
player from last year's"squad that finished 17-

13 in conference play and fell one game shy of
advancing to the WCC Championship Series
for the first time in school history.
As a team, San Francisco is batting a re
spectable .313 with six regulars batting over
.300. Senior infielder Chris Genung leads the
team in batting with a .373 clip. He's also tal
lied six home runs and 51 RBI. The San Fran
cisco pitching staff boasts a 4.73 ERA.
Stanford has won 47 of the 54 all-time
meetings between the schools but the Dons
have had the Cardinal's number at home two
out of the last three seasons. San Francisco
has already defeated California in Berkeley
earlier this season.
Somewhat lost amid the Cardinal's series
loss was that the offense seemed to break out
of the mini-slump it fell into in Washington and
that carried over to Tuesday's win. The Stan
ford lineup was firing on all cylinders in the
first two games of the series and the 18 runs
scored in Sunday's loss tied a season-high.
With two weeks left in the regular season,
the questions surrounding the team return to
its young pitching staff and bullpen. The latest
search for answers takes place tonight with
the first pitch scheduled for 6 p.m.
