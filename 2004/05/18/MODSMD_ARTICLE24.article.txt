# Golf tees off at NCAAs
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's golf team used an
inspired performance to qualify for the 2004
NCAA Championships, and with first
round play at the beautiful Lake Course in
Opelika, Ala., beginning this morning, head
coach Caroline O'Connor's squad hopes to
show it has plenty left in the tank.
The Cardinal is coming off a tliird-place
finish at the West Regional, where, playing
on their home course, the women carded
their best three-round total of the season to
qualify for NCAAs for the 16th consecutive
season. Four Stanford golfers placed in the
top 40 of the event.
If that performance is any indication that
the Cardinal has saved its best golf for the
most important time of year, Stanford
stands a great chance to improve on its 16th
place finish at last year's championships.
The Cardinal got off to a great start at
the Kampen Course on the Purdue campus
and was in seventh place after the first day
of competition last season. But Stanford
stumbled in the ensuing rounds and fin
ished with a four-day total of 1,245.
Pacific-10 Conference counterpart

Southern California won the team title with
a 1,197, 15 strokes ahead of second-place
Pepperdine. The Trojans were led by
Mikaela Parmlid, who shot a 297 to win the
individual title.
Seniors Angela Rho and Kim
Kouwabunpat, an honorable-mention Ail-
Pac-10 selection, provide Championship
experience to the group of five Cardinal
golfers who will compete at NCAAs. Rho
and Kouwabunpat finished 66th and 73rd,
respectively, last season.
Sophomore Stephanie Lue and fresh
men Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana and
Lauren Todd round out the squad.
The Cardinal will be up against 23 other
teams, including Pac-10 foes Arizona, Ari
zona State, California, UCLA and Wash
ington. Six individuals from schools that did
not qualify for the team competition will
also compete.
Teams play 18 holes each day for four
days. The lowest four individual scores for
each team will count toward each team's
daily total score. Stanford is paired with
Michigan State and North Carolina for the
first two rounds.
Stanford's best finish at NCAAs came in
2000, when the Cardinal placed second.
