# Assembly candidates address jobs, education
## 
### DAWN CARDON 
California State Assembly
candidates Republican Steven
Poizner and Democrat Ira
Ruskin squared off last night in a
debate sponsored by Stanford in
Government (SIG), the Stan
ford Democrats and the Stan
ford College Republicans.
Primary issues addressed
by the candidates were the
California budget crisis and
public education funding.
When asked what students
might find important about
this election and what issues
are particularly relevant to
them, both Ruskin and
Poizner highlighted the lack
of local jobs.
Ruskin spoke of his ''record
of good fiscal management
[which is] important to students
because they'd like to have a ro
bust economy so graduates can
get jobs."
Poizner was also particularly
concerned with what he called
the "economic meltdown in Sili
con Valley."
"Twenty percent of jobs have

recently disappeared," he said.
"I hope to institute programs
and policies that would attract
jobs back to the area."
The improvement of the Cal
ifornia public school system was
another important problem dis
cussed in the debate.
Ruskin said he hopes to
streamline the education code to
enhance local control.
"The 2,000 page education
code is rife with excessive rules
and regulations that make it dif
ficult for local school boards,
principals and teachers to have
control over the budgets of their
own schools," Ruskin said.
Poizner agreed with Ruskin
that local control was "crucial."
Both candidates have had
track records of working to im
prove public school systems.
Ruskin has worked to establish
libraries in local school districts,
and Poizner taught 12th grade
government classes at a local
high school.
Both Poizner and Ruskin are
Stanford alumni. Poizner at
tended Stanford Business
School after graduating top of

his class at University of Texas.
He proceeded to start two of his
own businesses and later won a
White House fellowship.
Ruskin received his master's
degree in communication from
Stanford. He went on to become
a member of the Redwood City
Council, serving three terms,
and then was elected mayor of
the city from 1999-2001.
Ruskin described his "excel
lent record for public service" in
areas such as education, envi
ronmental protection and fiscal
management.
Poizner, having less political
experience, emphasized his inde
pendence. He declared that he has
"not been beholden to anybody,"
which is illustrated in his refusal to
accept funding from special-inter
est groups that may attempt to in
fluence campaigns.
The hour-long debate was
fueled by questions from stu
dents and community mem
bers. Stanford Democrats
President Kai Stinchcombe, a
doctoral student in political
science said that by structur
ing the debate in this way,

they hoped to give students
and community members the
chance to ask their questions
to the candidates and bring
important issues into the pub
lic debate.
According to several students
in the audience, there was not a
clear winner of the debate.
"Poizner's knowledge of the
issues was significantly more im
pressive than Ruskin's," said
sophomore Mojan Movassate.
Sophomore Paul Yoo disagreed.
"Poizner was a very good
speaker, [but] what Ruskin
said was more meaningful,"
Yoo said.
SIG member Tyler Kirtley, a
freshman, said that his group
was approached by the Stanford
Republicans and the Stanford
Democrats to facilitate the de
bate. The three student groups
sponsored this event with the
intention of better equipping
Stanford students with informa
tion when it came time to vote
in November.
"This is an important race
that is relevant to the Stanford
community," Kirtley said.
