# Special-election results to be released Thursday
## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Elections Commission
will release the special-election results
this Thursday at noon at the CoHo, ac
cording to elections commissioner Ellie
Martin, a junior.
The results of the election, which took
place May 5 and 6, had been sealed by the
Commission on the recommendation of
the Constitutional Council because of the
flurry of litigation by senior Mikey Lee and
junior Dylan Mefford over the past two
weeks. The decision of the Council Sunday
night to let stand the Undergraduate Sen
ate's refusal to certify the initial election
results opened the door for the announce
ment of the special-election results.
As of late last night, only Martin knew
the winners of that contest.
"I have tallied the results," she said.
"Currently, I am the only person privy to
the outcome of the special election."
Last night, the Senate initially debated
what recommendation to give the Elec
tions Commission regarding the release of
the special-election results, with some in

favor of tallying them as soon as possible in
the interest of the candidates.
"We owe it to them to move on as
quickly as possible," said Senator Adrian
Boscolo-Hightower, a sophomore.
Most senators, however, cautioned
against prematurely making the results
public, due to the possibility that the origi
nal election results might end up getting
certified after all.
"We'll have egg on our face," said Sen
ator Omar Shakir, a freshman.
In the end, the debate was ruled moot,
as Constitutional Council member Monica
Henestroza, a graduate student, informed
the Senate that it could not issue advice be
cause it was the respondent in the suit Lee
v.the Sixth Undergraduate Senate.
"We don't feel it's appropriate for the
Senate to be making recommendations [to
the Elections Commission]," she said.
Several obstacles still remain before
the special-election winners can take of
fice, however. The Constitutional Coun
cil reconvenes Thursday night to formal
ize the decision it drafted Sunday, which
paves the way for the instatement of the spe
cial-election results. On Monday, the Sen
ate must also meet and certify the election,
by no means a certainty in the current polit
ical climate.
"[The Thursday release of the special
election results is] barring unforeseen cir
cumstances," Martin said.
