# Journalists receive Knight Fellowships to spend year at University
## 
### ZUBIN AGARWAL 
Nineteen journalists were recently
awarded prestigious Knight Fellow
ships for the upcoming school year.
The Fellows represent some of the
most accomplished journalists in the
world, with seven international Fel
lows and 12 from the United States.
Several of the Fellows are from
Latin America — of the 19 Fellows,
three are currently working in Latin
America while two are originally
from there.
Knight Fellows spend a year at
Stanford, taking classes and special
seminars in their area of interest. Ac
cording to Communication Prof. Jim
Bettinger, the program's director, the

Knight Fellowship is an opportunity
for journalists to enhance their ca
reers when they return back to their
respective organizations.
"News organizations reap the ben
efits of the broader and deeper knowl
edge that Fellows return with," Bet
tinger said on the Knight Fellowships
website. "And Fellowships improve
the overall quality of news and analy
sis that reaches the public — a goal
that all can endorse."
Knight Fellows also give back to
the Stanford community by speaking
in classes and residence halls, and par
ticipating in panel discussions. Every
year, the program sponsors the John
S. Knight lecture and symposium.
Next year's Knight Fellows are

Collen Barry, a news editor with the
Associated Press in Germany; Jody
Berger, a sports reporter with the
Rocky Mountain News; Sterry Butch
er, a senior reporter with the Big Bend
Sentinel and Presido International in
Marfa, Texas; Denise Clifton, lead
news designer with the Seattle Times;
Phillip Davis, a Miami correspondent
for National Public Radio; Tomasz
Deptula, executive editor of Nowy
Dziennik (Polish Daily News) in Yew
York; Susan Ferriss, Mexico corre
spondent for Cox Newspapers; John
Jeter, the Washington Post's South
American bureau chief; Geri
Migielicz, director of photography at
the San Jose Mercury News; Sacha
Pfeiffer, a Spotlight team staff re

porter at the Boston Globe; Julia
Powell, a producer with PBS Front
line; and Frances Robles, the Miami
Herald's Bogota bureau chief.
According to Bettinger, Knight
Fellows are extraordinary because
they know how to use a place like
Stanford. He said that they are able
utilize the archives and seek out indi
vidual professors to further their stud
ies; most importantly. Fellows care
about journalism and about doing
their jobs well.
Former Fellows have praised the
program and the benefits they've
reaped from it.
"The trade-off is a once-in-a- life
time opportunity to study and reflect
without real-world pressures, and join

a fraternity of top-notch journalists,"
said Richard Gonzalez — a former
Fellow from 1995 — on the Knight
Fellowship Web site. "It certainly
boosted my enthusiasm for my job,
and my sense of what I can accomplish
in the future."
Applicants must have at least
seven years of full-time professional
experience and must be currently
working full-time as journalists.
Each application is read indepen
dently by three reviewers — the
program director, the deputy direc
tor and an experienced journalist.
From these, 25 to 30 semifinalists
are chosen to be interviewed at
Stanford. Final evaluations are done
by the program committee, com

posed of senior Stanford faculty
members and prominent journalists.
The program pays Stanford tuition
for each Fellow, who also receives a
stipend of $55,000 plus supplements
for housing, childcare, health insur
ance and books.
Journalism fellowships at Stanford
began in 1966 with a three-year, $1
million grant from the Ford Founda
tion. A $4 million grant from the
Knight Foundation put the fellow
ships on a permanent endowed basis
beginning with the 1984-85 academic
year. The Fellowships were renamed
for John S. Knight, a distinguished
American journalist whose major
concern throughout a long career was
the editorial quality of newspapers.
