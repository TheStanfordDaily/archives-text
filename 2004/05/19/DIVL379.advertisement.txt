Sean ON uallain
This feels like a time of
environmental and moral
crisis without parallel. Not only
do human beings seem not to
believe in anything but,
despite exponential advances
in information production, we
do not appear to know much
either. This book is a guide for
everyone who feels under
standably perplexed. This
book considers issues as
diverse as:
• The lure of alternative
religions and belief
systems.
• The use of the rhetoric
of economics to justify
amoral decision-making.
• Green politics and
genetically-modified
crops.
• New technology's power
to preserve the status
quo, and
• The true impetus behind
the Human Genome
Project.
