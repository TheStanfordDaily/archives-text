# Stanford limits RA, TA hours
## 
### JASON FLANNICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a move that may dishearten many graduate stu
dents, the University announced this past Friday that it
will lower the amount of time that students can work as
research assistants (RAs) or teaching assistants (TAs)
over the summer quarter. This action, which will mean
the loss of over $1,000 for some students, came in re
sponse to a new IRS policy that would subject students
holding full assistantships to Social Security withholding
tax, also known as FICA.
"This is something that no one was particularly excit
ed about," said Ann George, assistant dean of research
and graduate policy. "The IRS has proposed a change
which if it is adopted will be retroactive to next summer.
We do not believe that what we have done in the past will
continue to exempt our students from FICA."
In the past, the University offered Spec 501, a one
unit course in which students could enroll to preserve
their student status over the summer. The new policy will
eliminate that nondepartmental course.
"In order to be maintain student status and have an
assistantship appointment, the student will have to be
enrolled in something," George said. "Now, to have any
assistantship, you must be enrolled in departmental
units. For that reason, the summer assistantship is
capped at 90 percent [of a full-time working week] with
three units of tuition allowance."
The new IRS regulation redefines what constitutes
enrollment in courses. More importantly, it defines stu
dents regularly working 40 hours a week as career em
ployees, who are subject to FICA.
"The reason we went from 100 percent to 90 percent
was simply because the 100 percent would have implied
a regular 40-hour week, which we felt would have im
plied a tax," said University Tax Compliance Director
Chris Canellos. "If the 40-hour-a-week policy wasn't
there, I can tell you this wouldn't have happened."
However, George said that there was another moti
vation for the elimination of Spec 501.
"That one-unit place holder now costs three units,"
she said. "The idea is to say that any student with an as
sistantship teaching or doing research must be enrolled
in some departmental units."
While most students seemed to understand the im
petus for the new policy, many said they were upset by
the change.
"My first concern is the immediate loss of what
amounts to over $1,000 in income over the summer for
each graduate student who expected to do research,"
said Graduate Student Council Deputy Chair Roger
Stanley, a graduate student in the business and educa
tion schools. "Fora family, that's the monthly grocery
bill, and fora single student, one or two months' rent."
Computer science doctoral student Andreas
Sundquist echoed Stanley's worries.
"It's not a huge amount, but it's unfortunate that
students are already pressed for money and some stu
dents count on the summer to break even for the
year," Sundquist said. "It's already expensive living
around here."
Particularly of concern to some students was the tim
ing of the announcement, coming after students had al
ready made summer plans.
"The timing is tragic," Stanley said. "Most students
have already made plans and taken on the associated fi
nancial commitments. They've lost all leverage and are
reacting to figure out what basic life commodities are
going to have to be sacrificed."
Even though the IRS policy was announced back in
February, Cannelos said that the University acted as
quickly as possible.

"Frankly, two and a half months is pretty good timing
for something like this to occur," he said. "[George] and
I were working back and forth on this every day. I think
we've conducted ourselves well in this situation in terms
of timing."
George agreed.
"The worst case scenario would be to have anyone be
surprised when FICA is taken out of their pay," she said.
"We wanted to make sure that people knew if they were

going to work 40 hours a week there's not much we can
do to make them exempt from social security."
A potential additional issue is how the new cap will
affect the ability of some departments to attract students
to work over the summer as opposed to accepting out
side internships.
"Computer science faculty tend to use the 100-per
cent appointments more so than other departments,"
said Computer Science Assistant Prof. Serafim Bat
zoglou. "We are relatively well-funded, plus our stu
dents have better opportunities for summer opportuni
ties outside of Stanford."
But Batzoglou said it was unlikely that the new cap
would have an enormous effect.
"I think that the impact will be low because it is only
a 10 percent difference," he said.
One option students hope administrators will consid
er will be to raise the minimum salary of an assistantship.
However, George said that was never an option.
"The campus-wide University finances wouldn't sup
port it," she said. However, she added, "Departments have

some flexibility with what they can pay."
Other faculty members argued that rais
ing stipends is a low-cost option of ensuring
that students remain happy.
"Some argue that the minor pay differ
ence should not be an issue and that stu
dents are over-reacting," said Computer
Science Assistant Prof. Ron Fedkiw. "I'd
argue that it does have a large impact on
morale though, and increasing the stu
dents' salaries by a bit gives us the opportu
nity to have the exactly opposite effect on
morale. Student morale might be the most
important factor in the success of a re
search program, and even if it is not, it's one
of the easiest factors to control â€” usually
at very little cost."
According to Cannelos, the policy
change came as the IRS found that people
were abusing the exemption.
"The exemption that students have en
joyed in the past and continue to enjoy is
granted through the internal revenue code
section 3121(b)(10)," he said. "It basically
exempts from Social Security certain
wages for students that are regularly at
tending classes."
However, with the increase of profes

sional adults attending classes, an increas
ing number of people were claiming the ex
emption without truly fitting the definition
of a student.
"The intent was never to give [a per
son] a tax exemption just because he hap
pened to be working fora college and
happened to be enrolled there," Canne
los said. "The Social Security administra
tion is worried that as the process of con
tinuing education continues to grow,
more and more people are going to be
paying less money into the Social Securi
ty system and may not get proper cover
age for their families."
Cannelos said that administrators will
continue to do everything they can to help
students with assistantships.
"We watch these matters very careful
ly," he said. "We're going to be monitoring
this every day and asking questions if any
one is hearing any more about this."
Still, Stanley said that graduate students
can only tighten their belts and hope to min
imize the effects of the new changes.
"We recognize that the administration
do not sit in their offices at night trying to
figure out the most damaging time to spring
this sort of thing on grad students and that it
was probably driven by some higher, gov
ernmental action or anticipated actions,"
Stanley said. "Having said that, however,
the life of a grad student is Spartan enough
without surprises like this."
