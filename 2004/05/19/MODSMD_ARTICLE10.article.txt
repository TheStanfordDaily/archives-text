## Student parodies Britney Spears video 
### COURTNEY BRIGHAM 
Three weeks ago, senior Jason Lee
put up an away message with a link to a
parody he had made of the Britney
Spears "Toxic" music video. When he
came back ten hours later, his friend and
star of the video, freshman Elizabeth
Hang, informed him that it had already
been seen all over campus — Larkin
was talking about it and so was Branner,
along with random students from other
dorms. Lee had been planning on pre
miering the video four days later at a
Cafe Night event in Flo Mo.
"After the first day I got emails from
about thirty friends across campus ask
ing me about it," Hang said.
"Somehow it just leaked," Lee said.
"I don't know how it spread so quickly."

Lee first became in
terested in filmmaking
in December of last
year when he bought a
digital camera with a
video feature. His first
film was a music video
to Clay Aiken's "Invis
ible," also starring
Hang, in which he tells
"a typical unrequited
love story." "Toxic"
was Lee's "Invisible
Part II," where Hang
dies as a result of her
unrequited love.
Lee searched
through other sources
for the sequel to "Invis
ible" before deciding to
take on Spears' popular
music video. He con
templated Madonna's
"Don't Tell Me" and
Marcy Playground's
"Sex and Candy," but
in the end his disgust for
the "Toxic" video in
spired him to make his
own version. Usually a
fan of Spears, he was
disappointed that all
the video seemed to say
was, "I'm an airline
stewardess and a slut,
both at the same time."
But what exactly is
Lee's version of
"Toxic" saying? The
video takes place in
the FloMo Dining
Hall, and some view
ers have wondered if
it's a warning against
the quality of the food.
Lee, the Student Man
ager of FloMo Dining
for the past three
years, insists that the
food has nothing to do
with it. After missing

out on getting footage on an airplane,
he debated possible filming sites for the
video.
"I thought about the Marguerite or
CalTrain as possible locations," Lee
said, but in the end he decided to paro
dy his job in the dining hall.
"I play a lot of music while I'm work
ing to keep myself in a good mood," Lee
said. "Toxic was a chance for me to par
ody Britney, parody myself and finish
what I started with my 'Invisible' video."
While the dining hall location of
"Toxic" contributes much of the humor
of the piece, filming in such a busy loca
tion proved difficult. Lee filmed during
prime traffic hours, from 5 to 6 p.m. over
the course of seven days.
"People had no idea what was going
on. It was really hard to film. There were

certain shots where I wanted people to
be walking by, but most would just stop
to watch," Lee said.
Certain scenes of the video show Lee
accosting female diners and crawling se
ductively on the cafeteria floor.
"I don't think they had any idea what
I was doing, especially since I was
dressed in my work uniform," Lee said.
The response to the final cut of the video
was overwhelming, according to Lee.
"I had such a good response from the
Stanford community. 'Toxic' was just a
fun thing to do, I hadn't thought about a
next one," Lee said.
But continuous e-mails from students
and messages on Thefacebook.com
made Lee feel pressured to top his
"Toxic" efforts with yet another part in
his series.

"People sent me a lot of sugges
tions for other songs to do, but their
suggestions were so standard, like
'Hey Ya' by Outkast and 'Yeah' by
Usher. I thought those were in the
same vein as 'Toxic' and I wasn't going
to make another video unless it was
better," Lee said.
Lee finally found material for his
third video — one of Weird Al's
polka remixes.
"It was perfect. It had all of the styles
I had considered in one song. Hip hop,
boyband, pop, indie pop ... frankly it
was the only way I could top 'Toxic,'"
Lee said.
The new video took Lee 13 and a
half hours to film, features over 15 ac
tors and spotlights several iconic Stan
ford locations, such as the bookstore.

White Plaza, Tresid
der and the well
known morning traffic
by the Clocktower.
Like the videos
of "Invisible" and
"Toxic," the new
video was filmed on
Lee's tiny digital cam
era without the help
of an experienced di
rector and features
volunteers as actors.
Lee edits the videos
himself on a boot
legged copy of a self
editing program.
"The great thing
about the reaction to
'Toxic' was that 1 got
to e-mail fans to be ex
tras in the new video,
so in the end we did
the whole thing for
free," Lee said.
There were some,
however, that didn't
feel so much love for
Lee's Toxic' video.
"I thought it was a lit
tle weird that he was
climbing around on
the dining hall floor,"
said senior Scott Still
man. "The part where
he was licking the ice
cream cone kind
of scared me." Still
man acknowledged
that Lee's video
did offer some aes
thetically pleasing
camera shots.
Lee's final version
of the Weird A1 video
parody will be posted
on his web site today,
along with past videos
he has -made: http://
