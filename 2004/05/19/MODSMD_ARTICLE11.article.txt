# Eat, drink and be merry
## Food for thought 
### 
This weekend, the average Stanford student had
a multitude of social opportunities — from
sketchy naked parties to watching the band that
you were obsessed with in 6th grade play on
Wilbur field, to helping to cure cancer. Strange mix for
one weekend, but that's cool.
Relay for Life, the national American Cancer Soci
ety fundraiser, took place at the Stanford Stadium this
Saturday from 10 a.m. to Sunday 10 a.m. For 24 hours,
people ran or walked around the stadium, listened to
student performers like Everyday People, Counter
point, Chris Ayer, Bent Spoon and enjoyed the sun and

general good spirit.
If you didn't show up to this spec
tacular event (and trust me, I know
who you are) you missed out on was
24 hours worth of free food. Mmm,
yes. Free food. Apparently there is
some list called freefood@lists.stan
ford.edu, but that's kind of like an
urban legend. And cleaner than the
cat in the microwave one. I swear that
one was in the movie.
So for the event, my roommate

Elizabeth and I were the food committee chairs (of
course). And although it sounds like fun, in reality it was
all about trying to persuade restaurants to donate food
to such a worthy cause. Sometimes the persuasion bor
dered on coercion. Sometimes it resulted in just com
plete blow-offs. That's right — some restaurants blew
off curing cancer. Not cool by any means.
So while most of the time we go out to eat at restau

rants because we like the food, once in awhile we should
make it a point to eat at places we want to support —
and the group of restaurants that we ended up finally
working with were so generous and happy to give us
food that we think that they should be acknowledged by
the Stanford population (and our wallets).
A round of applause for:
House of Bagels — They were so awesome. They
gave us four huge bags of bagels that lasted us from 10
a.m. to midnight on Saturday. Then they gave us anoth
er 48 at 6 a.m. (Yeah that's right, my alarm went off at
5:25 to pick them up).
Noah's Bagels — Sharing in the bagel love, Noah's
filled up a huge trash bag with bagels Sunday at 7 a.m.
(check two on list of things to do on Sunday). My room
mate couldn't even carry it by herself it was that heavy
— and oh so tasty. Something about bagels and cream
cheese just does it for you.
Celia's — Unlike their cranky neighbor across the
way, Celia's was happy to donate a ton of chips, salsa,
guacamole, quesadillas, chile rellenos, nachos and other
finger foods to us. They even helped us carry the mass
quantities to my car. Charitable and polite.
PF Chang's — I've probably never seen more
eggrolls at one time in my life. Enough said.
" Mandarin Gourmet — Although I was concerned
that they were too nice a restaurant to donate anything,
they were one of the easiest to work with, and were one
of the few restaurants to donate actual food-food as op
posed to pastries or sweet breads.
Peninsula Creamery — The Creamery donated
boxes and boxes of minicookies, from buttery Peanut

Butter (yes, redundant, I know) to luscious chocolate chip.
They had them ready for us in lots of pretty pink boxes.
Dominos — Always tasty, Dominos came and deliv
ered ten piping-hot pizzas around midnight. They even
gave us a banner to put in the tent that said "It's Cool to
Eat Pizza in School!" I agree.
Paradise Pizza — As if we couldn't get enough
pizza, both Paradise and Applewood Gourmet gave us
pies (10 and four, respectively) to set out for the hungry
masses. What goes better with Mandarin Gourmet
cashew chicken than pepperoni pizza, really? But hon
estly, when its cold outside and you've been running /
chilling on the grass all day, nothing tastes better.
Happy Donuts — They gave us four dozen assort
ed donuts — from sprinkles to glazed to bear claws.
Mmmm, donuts.
Fresh Choice — An unexpected contributor I must
say. It was one of those random calls that we made that
actually worked out — they were happy to give us a
bunch of warm mini muffins. Except for the weird garlic
ones, they were an excellent bite sized snack.
All the restaurants mentioned above were great to
work with, but the next four were just shining stars. Do
nating over $1,000 dollars worth of food (and commit
ting themselves early on), these places made the back of
the Relay for Life t-shirt.
World Wrapps — The manager was so excited to
work with us from the get-go, and came and set up his
platters of over 300 mini wraps to feed people for lunch.
Jamba Juice — Going above the call of duty, Jamba
even set up its own little tent and gave out smoothies
when the sun was at its peak. I've never seen such a mad

rush to get a Mango a Go Go or Razzamatazz.
Hobee's — They probably gave us around 10 sheets
of coffee cake. I swear I got the best workout just by lift
ing all this food places were giving us. I guess you can
have your (coffee) cake and eat it too.
Starbucks — By far the most enthusiastic group I
have ever come across. They came repeatedly through
out the entire event to make sure that there was always
fresh coffee, to refill the sugars, etc. They even had a
Starbucks team that made a big appearance. And to top
it all off, in their store on Stanford Ave. they advertised
Relay on their little blackboard (instead of the usual -
try the Toffee Nut Latte with a Snickerdoodle!). So for
all you corporate America haters, you should give it up
to Starbucks fora minute.
So if you have nothing better to do one night for din
ner, stop by World Wrapps or Fresh Choice, even if it's
just to say that you really appreciate what they do for
charities. Even if their meals aren't the most haute cui
sine, they've got good hearts (and definitely a good eye
for publicity).
By the way. Relay For Life made over $45,000. So
thanks again to everyone who donated and participated
to this amazing cause.

If you want a Domino's magnet, let Jennie know at
jbroder@stanford.edu. She's got a serious collec
tion building up, along with designer napkins (I
don't socialize with anyone who doesn t have a logo
on her napkin).
