## Make summer dining cheaper 
### 
Despite surveys. Dining Committee meet
ings and feedback from students on the
subject, summer dining plans are still too
expensive and inflexible. Prices for each of
this summer's plans went down by exactly one dollar
from last summer. Taking into account the effects of
inflation, this would count as a slight improvement hut
for the fact that dining halls will be offering three
fewer days of service, which are being termed "op
tional days."
Dining Services has done an admirable job of col
lecting student opinion on summer dining in forums
like the Dinner Discussion Series. However, this issue
was first raised last year, and major changes are be
coming long overdue. The changes made this year, in
cluding slightly expanded hours and the addition of
retail points that can be used anywhere on campus, are
small steps in the right direction but do not sufficient
ly address the central problems of price and flexibility.
According to Residential Education, dining halls
are supposed to foster intellectual dialogue through
shared meals. For some University departments with
summer programs, this may justify mandatory meal
plans. But certainly not for all. Summer Research Col-

lege is a situation in which mandatory plans might ac
tually limit intellectual interactions because the plans
prevent students in the program from taking their
meals with other researchers on their own schedule. In
general, summer dining plans should not be mandato
ry. If some departments feel the need for their stu
dents to eat in the same place every day, this should be
enforced through other means.
At the very least. Dining Services must work to
ward offering a substantially less expensive option to
those required to purchase meal plans. Obviously, this
cannot be achieved overnight. It can be very difficult
to work with budgets after the start of the fiscal year.
However, after this year. Dining Services will have
had ample time to make such a plan work. The orga
nization has said that it will initiate longer-term struc
tural changes beginning next summer. We hope and
expect that these changes will be more than just added
frills to existing meal plans.
Summer dining prices are a thorny problem, but it
can be solved through hard work and creative plan
ning. If Dining Services is truly committed to address
ing student concerns, it will make sure that this sum
mer is the last under the current system.
