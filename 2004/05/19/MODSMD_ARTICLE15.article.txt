Too much Huey Kwik
Being an avid Daily letter to the
editor reader, I noticed that comput
er science major Huey Kwik had let
ters printed in consecutive issues
(May 14 and May 17). Letters to the
editor should express a wide range of
viewpoints. Publishing two letters in
a row by one person does not fairly
represent the opinions of The Daily's
readership. If I wanted to hear the
opinions of Huey Kwik, I'd date him.

Bouncy castles and
deflated dreams
The Daily's editorial board aptly
concluded that Spring Thing needs
improvement ("Spring Thing needs
work," 5/17), but for the wrong rea
sons. The bouncy castles were not a
shortcoming that "undermined any
ambitions ... of staging a really
'cool' college party."
Rather, they were a dream come
true, and the only disappointment was
that they were deflated early, in broad
daylight, before crowds of students
eager to master the Survivor Bouncy

Challenge and other fun games.
Deflated bouncy adventures
crashing to the floor were what
spoiled Spring Thing. For under
classman. there is hope in next year,
but for graduating seniors there is
only the sad memory of deflation
and the delightful adventures that
could have been.
