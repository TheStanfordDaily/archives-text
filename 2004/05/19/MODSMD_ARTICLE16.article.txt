# STILL MAC, STILL DANGEROUS
## A
						fond farewell to frat parties 
### 
You walk into a frat party.
The first thing that hits you
is the smell. It's that odd
mixture of sweaty feet, bad
body odor and stale beer.
Then you look around the party.
The dance floor is dark and steamy.
The hottest new hip-hop track blasts
from the speakers as indiscernible
mobs of rhythmless college students at
tempt to dance to the beat and mouth
along to the lyrics. Couples are "grind
ing" all around you, groping each other
like their plane is going down and they
have five minutes to live.
The line at the bar is 20-deep fora
warm, foamy, half of a red cup's worth
of Keystone Light. The line could go
faster, but the guys behind the bar are
clearly relishing their role as bartender /
master of the universe. Your ability to
secure a soothing alcoholic beverage
lies in their hands, and they know it.
After 10 minutes of waiting, you fi
nally get a cup. Then there are two
choices: pound the beer and be forced
to immediately wait on line again; or
try to nurse the beer and sip slowly
until some hammered jackass in
evitably bumps into you and knocks
the beer out of your hands.
Hopefully you didn't go out that
sober. Anyone who's ever been to a
frat party knows you can't get drunk at
one. Getting your hands on a drink is
such a painstaking process that you'll
soon get more disgruntled than a
postal worker if you arrive sober.
Pre-gaming is an absolute necessi
ty unless you have the tolerance of a
12-year-old and the patience of the
Dalai Lama.
As you would do at any gathering,
you walk around a frat party upon ar
rival. You do a lap and mingle. Find
your friends and scout the scene. Spot
that dime-piece from your section,
whom you spent 50 minutes staring at
just one day earlier. Make small talk
and kick some of your foolproof A
game. Maybe you bring your most tal
ented wingman into battle with you

for support.
Almost everyone around you is
choosing among the same basic op
tions. It's been a long week chock-full
of tests, papers, jobs, games and meet-

ings. It's time to
let loose.
As the night
goes on, the inhi
bitions go down.
The party may
be getting more
crowded by the
minute, but hope
fully your mind is
elsewhere because

you're chilling with friends, focused
on some scattered ass around the
party or just woefully intoxicated.
Ultimately, the Stanford Police will
converge on the party and treat it like
a raid on a crack house in Compton.
The DJ may get a chance to play one
last song if you're lucky, giving you the
chance to track down that girl or guy
that you're sure was throwing you
some crazy vibes earlier in the night.
Either way, the party will soon end
and you'll stumble home to pass out in
your bed — or, if you're lucky, in
someone else's bed.
After four years of college, nights
like these inevitably blend together to
form one giant haze of memories, or
lack thereof. Soon, dozens of parties
are whittled down to a foggy melange
of drunken revelry.
Did you hook up with that girl in
your IHUM section at Sigma Chi's
Cowabunga party, or was it at SAE's
Jungle Party? Did you go home with
that guy after Kappa Sig's Foam Party,
or were your pants really frothy in the
morning for some other reason?
If you join a fraternity like I did,
your view of frat parties definitely
changes over the years. And if you
have ever been a social chair, as I was,
your opinion changes even more as
you grow to appreciate all of the time
and energy needed to set up a party
that will ultimately resemble the

streets of Baghdad in the morning.
Maybe you stopped going to frat
parties after freshman year. Maybe
you never went at all. Odds are,
though, if you enjoy going out at night
then you've been to your fair share of
frat parties along the way. One thing's
for sure: If you've attended a bunch
over the years, the deer-in-the-head
lights feeling is definitely gone by se
nior year — you become a wily veter
an of such soirees. 1 know I have.
Four years ago, 1 remember feeling
a little overwhelmed by the throngs of
people in houses with names that
looked like calculus equations. But at
my fraternity's last party a couple
weeks ago, I felt like Moses parting the
Red Sea as I walked through the
crowds. And no, I didn't hit a growth
spurt sophomore year.
In a couple months. I will have
graduated and be working full-time —
and that means no more frat parties,
unless I want to pull a Mark Chmura.
Knowing this, I've really let it all soak
in the last couple weeks whenever I've
been at one of these hoedowns.
Now I crack up laughing whenever
I see two people using the wall as a ver
tical mattress or the entire basketball
team posting up in the corner of our
lounge, surveying the SAE dance
floor and waiting for their groupies to
flock to them. I love watching uncom
fortable freshmen dance in a circle like
they're in junior high. The same goes
for attention-seeking girls who do the
half-dance half-walk strut upon enter
ing a room, seemingly unaware of how
transparent their go-to move is.
I still can't deal with the smell. That
will never change. But I've found that
if you pre-game enough, you almost
forget about it by the end of the night.
I guess it all just blends into the giant
haze of memories, or lack thereof.
