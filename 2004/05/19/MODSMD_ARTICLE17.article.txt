## Outsourcing soldiers 
### 
Outsourcing is already a
campaign issue, with both
presidential candidates
solemnly pledging to
bring U.S. jobs back home.
There is one job that Americans
probably don't know is being out
sourced, and if they knew, it would
likely not invoke the outrage that
sending computing and telecommu
nications overseas has.
The job in question is that of sol
diers. The United States is contract
ing with Indian, South American,
African and even private U.S. com
panies to pick up arms and defend
American interests in Iraq, Kosovo,
Afghanistan and, well, everywhere
the U.S. wants to be.
They used to be called mercenaries
or Hessians, but now hired soldiers are
called contractors. Outsourcing allows
the government to hide some of the
costs on the American side of a con
flict, at the same time confusing the
mandate. In the case of the Iraq war,
the death toll is higher than we think
and virtually impossible to know, since
security contractors keep their busi
ness — both how many employees
they have on the ground and how
many come home in coffins — secret.
Just looking at the Iraqi war, does
a private company or do foreigners
have the same interest in maintaining
peace and democratizing a nation as
the government that started the war?
Should we leave the ideological battle
for the hearts and minds of the Iraqi
people to hired guns, those in the fight
for the paycheck, foreigners?
The Bush administration may not
like the critical depictions of the
United States as an empire conquer
ing countries and staking the flag and
influence where they will. But, from a
not-so-careful read of history, noth
ing smells so much like colonializa
tion as hired soldiers.
Unwittingly, contractors fell into the
news and the nation's consciousness a
month or so ago when four security
contractors were killed in Fallujah, Iraq,
their charred remains strung up over

the River Euphrates. The victims, for
mer military men, decorated soldiers
all, were rent-a-cops in Iraq, employees
of North Carolina security contractor
Blackwater USA. Unlike the security

guards you find at
the local strip mall,
Blackwater USA
employees are
armed with more
than a billy stick
and are granted
more or less carte
blanche to use
their impressive
firepower.
Reading press

reports from Iraq, it has the feel of a
frontier town in the days of explo
ration in America. The biggest guns
seem to win. With a lot of big guns
commissioned loosely through the
U.S. government to subcontracting
company to the employee on the
ground in Iraq, the picture is very
chaotic. One doesn't have to strain
one's imagination too hard to feel the
Iraqi dilemma: Which Americans and
which organizations are trustworthy?
The trouble with having forces out
side of the domain of the military is ap
parent in the Abu Ghraib prison scan
dal, where two private American com
panies were contracted to perform in
terrogations on Iraqi prisoners. The
two companies, CACI International
and Titan Corporation, are staffed with
former government employees who
answer to their bosses, not the Pen
tagon. It will take heaps of documents
and government hearings to know ex
actly where things broke down, but
outsourcing interrogations makes fora
fractured chain of command at best.
As for the costs to contractors, pri
vate companies don't return phone
calls, but The Independent, a London
paper, reported that during the Fallu
jah siege in the first week of April, SO
mercenaries — from the United States
and other countries — died in addition
to the 70 American troops who per
ished while fighting the rebellion.
The troop death count that first

week in April was enough to earn
the title of "The Bloodiest Week in
Iraq." Had the numbers reflected
the true death toll of 150 in one
week, the political fallout might
have been uncontainable.
The Independent reported that
there are as many as 18,000 hired sol
diers in Iraq, tasked with protecting
U.S. troops and assets. For their trou
ble (reference the horrifying images
of the execution of Nicholas Berg)
contractors make up to $1,000 a day.
The Asia Times reported this lu
crative job market back in January.
According to the Times, British and
American subcontractors began dis
creetly recruiting thousands of Indi
an ex-serviceman known for profes
sionalism and discipline for deploy
ment in Iraq. The Indians, for their
part, jumped on the big salaries.
Recruiting in foreign countries
spiked at the beginning of this year
because of the steep increase in casu
alties and because U.S. contractors
believed there would be friendly rela
tions between the brown-skinned In
dians and the Iraqis.
Of course, this isn't the first inci
dence of military outsourcing. Vir
ginia-based DynCorp has been
pumping out mercenaries for years
for Kosovo, Bosnia and Afghanistan.
While it might be politically more
palatable to have well-paid civilians
fight our battles than young, poorly
compensated soldiers, the move to
subcontract soldiering is perhaps the
most strident shift in U.S. military pol
icy, though it wasn't publicized and
most Americans don't know about it.
It is yet to be determined how
much the government knew about
the gross mistreatment of prisoners
in Abu Ghraib, but I imagine there
are more horrors than this if private
companies are making the hires,
training them, assigning them and
calling the shots.
