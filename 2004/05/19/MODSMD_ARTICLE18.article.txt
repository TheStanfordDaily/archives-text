## RFs need more support in staff selection process 
### ANETO OKONKWO 
When 1 told a friend that I was
planning to write an article about Stan
ford's residential staff selection pro
cess, she jokingly said, "Try not to
sound too bitter." In response I
replied, "I'm not, I'm just disappoint
ed that I spent so much time and an
guish in the application process kissing
up to the resident fellows."
My sentiments are not unique, but
are shared by hundreds of Stanford
students who were recently labeled
unqualified and unworthy by Stan
ford's 35 resident fellows to join the
glorious ranks of residence staff.
Admittedly, RFs face a massive re
sponsibility. Within a short time
frame, and drawing on little or no
human resources experience, they
must select a winning team of exuber
ant, diligent self-starters by wading
through an inundation of eager appli
cants. Residential Education provides
RFs with a modest program budget,
training sessions and minimal help
with program development, staff mat

ters and administrative concerns. With
this limited support for such a vital job,
the RFs' efforts in staff selection don't
always yield positive results.
According to the RF job description
on the Residential Education Web site,
staff selection is the RFs' most crucial
task. Staff selection involves reading
application files and conducting inter
views. RFs aid in the selection of RCCs
through the Residential Computing
Office, head peer academic coordina
tors through the Undergraduate Ad
vising Center and peer health educa
tors through the Cowell Student
Health Service. RFs residing in theme
or focus houses are responsible for the
application creation and subsequent se
lection process of ethnic theme associ
ates, academic theme associates or fac
ulty associates.
RFs are highly skilled in their re
spective fields of research and study, but
it is undoubtedly difficult for many of
them to sift through the candidates for
job-specific positions such as RCC and
PFIE without extra training in those
areas. Many RFs also deal with excep

tionally high volumes of applicants, par
ticularly in larger residences like Bran
ner and Roble, where there is an R A as
signed to each of the nine hallways.
The selection process occurs amid
a host of other RF responsibilities.
RFs must also attend weekly staff
meetings, visit occasional house meet
ings, attend some house programs, re
view resident evaluations of residence
staff and help with RF recruitment and
selection. Given these conditions, RFs
clearly need more University-funded
administrative support and training in
order to perform their duties effective
ly and efficiently. In the long term, a
solution could involve employing
more RFs or just inserting additional
administrative aides into a stream
lined staff selection process.
Even without these proposed in
creases in support, many RFs still as
semble amazing staffs. Their strategies
for success vary from recruiting
through immense personal interaction
with students to relying on the opinions
of previous staff members or simply in
vesting a large amount of time and ef

fort into the staff application process.
Successful RFs are often recognized
for their efforts at the house level by ap
preciation gifts from their staff or resi
dents, but rarely at the University-wide
level. Essentially, there need to be ad
ditional rewards and incentives for RFs
to strive for excellent dorm staff selec
tion. Welcome improvements could in
clude an annual banquet and a Univer
sity-wide forum or publication where
RFs can share their strategies with their
colleagues and learn from each other.
Along with the added recognition,
RFs also need added accountability
for their staff selection misadventures.
According to the RF application, the
RF selection committee consists of the
director of Res Ed, an associate direc
tor of Res Ed, a current RF, an RA, a
resident dean and Res Ed staff. How
ever, once the RFs are accepted, they
are only directly accountable to the di
rector of Res Ed.
This relatively loose setup undoubt
edly leaves grumbling students or dorm
staff with very few avenues through
which to address RF mismanagement.

The paths and processes for question
ing RF staff selection decisions need to
become more publicized, streamlined
and transparent to ensure continued
success. Setting up a standing commit
tee of administrators and students to
address all RF issues would be one
great upgrade to the existing system.
Many of the issues raised in this ar
ticle could be undertaken by the new
Undergraduate Housing Advisory
Committee led by the manager of Un
dergraduate Housing Operations. Ac
cording to the Nominations Commis
sion Web site, the goal of the commit
tee is to give undergraduate students
the opportunity to raise issues regard
ing residence life for discussion, to give
input into policy issues and to serve as
a resource for staff members. Issues to
be discussed include — but are not
limited to — housing operations and
facilities, laundry, storage, security,
lock-out services, energy conservation
and the establishment of regional
housing services centers.
This is a step in the right direction to
correct and support many inadequa

cies in Stanford's residential life. Fu
ture research and reviews could ad
dress staff selection on the Row, and
even the actual Web application host
ed by Stanford's Overseas Studies Pro
gram. As residents, I believe that we
should all exercise our basic rights to
question and critique Res Ed, its poli
cies, its actions and its administration.
I personally hope that this op-ed
can serve as a call to action for my fel
low staff selection rejects. We need
something to help us move past feeling
sorry for ourselves about being forced
back into the malodorous housing
draw. We need to channel our collec
tive personal bitterness into some
thing constructive, possibly improving
the residential living experience of fu
ture Stanford students.

with students to relying on the opinions
of previous staff members or simply in
vesting a large amount of time and ef

fort into the staff application process.
Successful RFs are often recognized
for their efforts at the house level by ap
preciation gifts from their staff or resi
dents, but rarely at the University-wide
level. Essentially, there need to be ad
ditional rewards and incentives for RFs
to strive for excellent dorm staff selec
tion. Welcome improvements could in
clude an annual banquet and a Univer
sity-wide forum or publication where
RFs can share their strategies with their
colleagues and learn from each other.
Along with the added recognition,
RFs also need added accountability
for their staff selection misadventures.
According to the RF application, the
RF selection committee consists of the
director of Res Ed, an associate direc
tor of Res Ed, a current RF, an RA, a
resident dean and Res Ed staff. How
ever, once the RFs are accepted, they
are only directly accountable to the di
rector of Res Ed.
This relatively loose setup undoubt
edly leaves grumbling students or dorm
staff with very few avenues through
which to address RF mismanagement.

The paths and processes for question
ing RF staff selection decisions need to
become more publicized, streamlined
and transparent to ensure continued
success. Setting up a standing commit
tee of administrators and students to
address all RF issues would be one
great upgrade to the existing system.
Many of the issues raised in this ar
ticle could be undertaken by the new
Undergraduate Housing Advisory
Committee led by the manager of Un
dergraduate Housing Operations. Ac
cording to the Nominations Commis
sion Web site, the goal of the commit
tee is to give undergraduate students
the opportunity to raise issues regard
ing residence life for discussion, to give
input into policy issues and to serve as
a resource for staff members. Issues to
be discussed include — but are not
limited to — housing operations and
facilities, laundry, storage, security,
lock-out services, energy conservation
and the establishment of regional
housing services centers.
This is a step in the right direction to
correct and support many inadequa

cies in Stanford's residential life. Fu
ture research and reviews could ad
dress staff selection on the Row, and
even the actual Web application host
ed by Stanford's Overseas Studies Pro
gram. As residents, I believe that we
should all exercise our basic rights to
question and critique Res Ed, its poli
cies, its actions and its administration.
I personally hope that this op-ed
can serve as a call to action for my fel
low staff selection rejects. We need
something to help us move past feeling
sorry for ourselves about being forced
back into the malodorous housing
draw. We need to channel our collec
tive personal bitterness into some
thing constructive, possibly improving
the residential living experience of fu
ture Stanford students.

When 1 told a friend that I was
planning to write an article about Stan
ford's residential staff selection pro
cess, she jokingly said, "Try not to
sound too bitter." In response I
replied, "I'm not, I'm just disappoint
ed that I spent so much time and an
guish in the application process kissing
up to the resident fellows."
My sentiments are not unique, but
are shared by hundreds of Stanford
students who were recently labeled
unqualified and unworthy by Stan
ford's 35 resident fellows to join the
glorious ranks of residence staff.
Admittedly, RFs face a massive re
sponsibility. Within a short time
frame, and drawing on little or no
human resources experience, they
must select a winning team of exuber
ant, diligent self-starters by wading
through an inundation of eager appli
cants. Residential Education provides
RFs with a modest program budget,
training sessions and minimal help
with program development, staff mat

ters and administrative concerns. With
this limited support for such a vital job,
the RFs' efforts in staff selection don't
always yield positive results.
According to the RF job description
on the Residential Education Web site,
staff selection is the RFs' most crucial
task. Staff selection involves reading
application files and conducting inter
views. RFs aid in the selection of RCCs
through the Residential Computing
Office, head peer academic coordina
tors through the Undergraduate Ad
vising Center and peer health educa
tors through the Cowell Student
Health Service. RFs residing in theme
or focus houses are responsible for the
application creation and subsequent se
lection process of ethnic theme associ
ates, academic theme associates or fac
ulty associates.
RFs are highly skilled in their re
spective fields of research and study, but
it is undoubtedly difficult for many of
them to sift through the candidates for
job-specific positions such as RCC and
PFIE without extra training in those
areas. Many RFs also deal with excep

tionally high volumes of applicants, par
ticularly in larger residences like Bran
ner and Roble, where there is an R A as
signed to each of the nine hallways.
The selection process occurs amid
a host of other RF responsibilities.
RFs must also attend weekly staff
meetings, visit occasional house meet
ings, attend some house programs, re
view resident evaluations of residence
staff and help with RF recruitment and
selection. Given these conditions, RFs
clearly need more University-funded
administrative support and training in
order to perform their duties effective
ly and efficiently. In the long term, a
solution could involve employing
more RFs or just inserting additional
administrative aides into a stream
lined staff selection process.
Even without these proposed in
creases in support, many RFs still as
semble amazing staffs. Their strategies
for success vary from recruiting
through immense personal interaction
with students to relying on the opinions
of previous staff members or simply in
vesting a large amount of time and ef

fort into the staff application process.
