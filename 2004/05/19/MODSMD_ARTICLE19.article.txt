## Small markets deserve the playoff love 
### 
The playoffs of the most overlooked
and underrated major sport in exis
tence are going on right now, and
you probably don't even know it.
Not that I'm suggesting that Stanford isn't
bursting at the seams with its fans, but I'm
talking about hockey.
The coverage of the chase for the Stanley
Cup in the Mercury News has been startling
ly apparent of late. However, it all seems
contrived, as if suddenly when the Sharks
made the playoffs, the paper scrambled to
show them the same kind of attention as they
would fora Giants postseason run. It's like
an equal-opportunity sports program where
hockey is artificially given the same level of
support as baseball.
Regardless of whether the city just filled
the arena with cardboard cutouts of hockey
fans or whether there actually is rabid sup
port for the Sharks in the Bay Area, it is ap-

parent that the playoffs
have arrived in San Jose.
The Sharks are down 3-2 to
the Calgary Flames in the
Western Conference finals,
trying to make their first
ever run at the Cup.
But I'm rooting for the
Flames.
The Calgary Flames are
representative of what a
sports franchise should be

— supported fervently by an extremely small
market, unburdened by coast-to-coast televi
sion coverage — and completely off the
radar fora large segment of the population.
Face it, can you name a Calgary Flame? Do
you know what division they play in? Do you
even know where Calgary is?
Still, it's places like Calgary that make
hockey great. Western Canada conjures up
images of hockey's history — strapping farm
boys lacing up their skates and going at it on
the frozen pond after harvesting the wheat.
Hockey in Phoenix, on the other hand, is
more out of place than Jerry Falwell on the
cover of High Times. Calgary is one of the
few, proud northern holdouts that have kept
small-market sports alive by virtue of fan
tenacity alone.
The Flames have dealt with consider
able adversity off the ice too. Small-market
hockey has lived through more misman
agement crises than even baseball. The
threat of a work stoppage looms when the
players' collective bargaining agreement
expires in 2004. The NHL has been forced
to deal with television contracts with Fox,
which places a flashing blue bubble around
the puck and artificially enhances game
sounds, making a game of power and fi
nesse seem one "whooooosh" short of a
Japanimated cartoon.
The fighting hasn't helped, either. A cou
ple of recent incidents have brought contro
versy over hockey fighting all the way to
Congress. If the NHL doesn't continue blur
ring the line between sport and Steven Sea
gal movies, it's about to lose what little cred
ibility it has.
Most apparent, though, is the brutal alien
ation of fans after franchises ditched smaller
northern markets for Sun Belt hockey
hotbeds like Phoenix and Dallas. Hartford,
perhaps, suffered the worst indignity when
its owner held the city for ransom, making it
seem like the citizens' fault for not raising
enough money to keep the Whalers in town,
when in fact in order to meet the required
goal they would have needed 30 times the
per-capita season ticket purchase rate of a
city like New York.
Calgary, and other outposts like Vancou
ver, Edmonton. Ottawa and Buffalo, keep
the spirit alive — at least temporarily, before
their owners become evil and decide to move
their teams to Albuquerque and Las Vegas
for an extra buck.
So what we have in Calgary, then, is the
most anomalous of sports phenomena: a city
of under a million people continuing to fero
ciously support a team that could probably
make much more money elsewhere. The
Saddledome is always brimming with Mol
son-fueled fans clad in red, cheering on their
Flames. Watching them on TV almost makes
you believe fact-challenged filmmaker
Michael Moore when he portrays the Great
White North as an Eden where children
roam the streets freely at night and neighbors
greet one another with a smile and a cold one
instead of a smile and a Clock.
Canada has its faults — weather, flannel,
recurring rashes of Frenchness — but,
dammit, the few remnants of its game are in
order. The Flames aren't just playing for the
Stanley Cup; they are playing for Canada.
And if they reach the finals against the
Tampa Bay Lightning, another franchise ma
rooned in a city more suited for alligator
wrestling than hockey, they will be playing
for hockey's soul.
So hail, Canada: the land where the na
tional sport is, in a few remaining holdouts,
as it should be.

ver, Edmonton. Ottawa and Buffalo, keep
the spirit alive — at least temporarily, before
their owners become evil and decide to move
their teams to Albuquerque and Las Vegas
for an extra buck.
So what we have in Calgary, then, is the
most anomalous of sports phenomena: a city
of under a million people continuing to fero
ciously support a team that could probably
make much more money elsewhere. The
Saddledome is always brimming with Mol
son-fueled fans clad in red, cheering on their
Flames. Watching them on TV almost makes
you believe fact-challenged filmmaker
Michael Moore when he portrays the Great
White North as an Eden where children
roam the streets freely at night and neighbors
greet one another with a smile and a cold one
instead of a smile and a Clock.
Canada has its faults — weather, flannel,
recurring rashes of Frenchness — but,
dammit, the few remnants of its game are in
order. The Flames aren't just playing for the
Stanley Cup; they are playing for Canada.
And if they reach the finals against the
Tampa Bay Lightning, another franchise ma
rooned in a city more suited for alligator
wrestling than hockey, they will be playing
for hockey's soul.
So hail, Canada: the land where the na
tional sport is, in a few remaining holdouts,
as it should be.

The playoffs of the most overlooked
and underrated major sport in exis
tence are going on right now, and
you probably don't even know it.
Not that I'm suggesting that Stanford isn't
bursting at the seams with its fans, but I'm
talking about hockey.
The coverage of the chase for the Stanley
Cup in the Mercury News has been startling
ly apparent of late. However, it all seems
contrived, as if suddenly when the Sharks
made the playoffs, the paper scrambled to
show them the same kind of attention as they
would fora Giants postseason run. It's like
an equal-opportunity sports program where
hockey is artificially given the same level of
support as baseball.
Regardless of whether the city just filled
the arena with cardboard cutouts of hockey
fans or whether there actually is rabid sup
port for the Sharks in the Bay Area, it is ap-

parent that the playoffs
have arrived in San Jose.
The Sharks are down 3-2 to
the Calgary Flames in the
Western Conference finals,
trying to make their first
ever run at the Cup.
But I'm rooting for the
Flames.
The Calgary Flames are
representative of what a
sports franchise should be

— supported fervently by an extremely small
market, unburdened by coast-to-coast televi
sion coverage — and completely off the
radar fora large segment of the population.
Face it, can you name a Calgary Flame? Do
you know what division they play in? Do you
even know where Calgary is?
Still, it's places like Calgary that make
hockey great. Western Canada conjures up
images of hockey's history — strapping farm
boys lacing up their skates and going at it on
the frozen pond after harvesting the wheat.
Hockey in Phoenix, on the other hand, is
more out of place than Jerry Falwell on the
cover of High Times. Calgary is one of the
few, proud northern holdouts that have kept
small-market sports alive by virtue of fan
tenacity alone.
The Flames have dealt with consider
able adversity off the ice too. Small-market
hockey has lived through more misman
agement crises than even baseball. The
threat of a work stoppage looms when the
players' collective bargaining agreement
expires in 2004. The NHL has been forced
to deal with television contracts with Fox,
which places a flashing blue bubble around
the puck and artificially enhances game
sounds, making a game of power and fi
nesse seem one "whooooosh" short of a
Japanimated cartoon.
The fighting hasn't helped, either. A cou
ple of recent incidents have brought contro
versy over hockey fighting all the way to
Congress. If the NHL doesn't continue blur
ring the line between sport and Steven Sea
gal movies, it's about to lose what little cred
ibility it has.
Most apparent, though, is the brutal alien
ation of fans after franchises ditched smaller
northern markets for Sun Belt hockey
hotbeds like Phoenix and Dallas. Hartford,
perhaps, suffered the worst indignity when
its owner held the city for ransom, making it
seem like the citizens' fault for not raising
enough money to keep the Whalers in town,
when in fact in order to meet the required
goal they would have needed 30 times the
per-capita season ticket purchase rate of a
city like New York.
Calgary, and other outposts like Vancou
ver, Edmonton. Ottawa and Buffalo, keep
the spirit alive — at least temporarily, before
their owners become evil and decide to move
their teams to Albuquerque and Las Vegas
for an extra buck.
