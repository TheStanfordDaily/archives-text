# University protests grants' anti-terrorism restrictions
## 
### NANCY WANG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford was among nine universities that recently
sent a letter asking the Ford Foundation and Rocke
feller Foundation to reconsider anti-terrorism language
they added this year to grant agreements. Provosts at the
top universities say that the provisions could infringe on
academic freedom, mirroring a general concern over re
strictive anti-terrorist policies.
The Ford and Rockefeller Foundations donated a
total of $50 million to U.S. higher education last year.
According to the Associated Press, when evidence sur
faced that grants from the Ford Foundations had funded
a radical Palestinian group, Jewish leaders called for re
strictions to prevent grant money from being used to
support terrorists.
New provisions in the Ford Foundation's grant
agreements state that no grant recipients may "promote
or engage in violence, terrorism, bigotry or the destruc
tion of any state" or "make sub-grants to any entity that
engages in these activities."
Similar clauses in the Rockefeller policy state that
grant recipients must "not directly or indirectly engage

in, promote or support other organizations or individu
als who engage in or promote terrorist activity."
In a letter sent to both foundations in late April,
provosts from nine prominent schools — including
Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Princeton and MIT — said
that they are not in a position to regulate everything said
by students and faculty members who benefit from the
grants. The provosts stated that the new policies were
too vague to enforce and that the policies could be inter
preted and used against political or cultural activities.
"Whatever university administrators may think of
the merits of the political views expressed, these fall
under the protection of freedom of academic speech,"
the provosts wrote.
Senior Associate Provost Stephanie Kalfayan added
that the provisions are at odds with Stanford's mission to
encourage the free expression of ideas.
"We're all about the free expression of ideas, and the
vagueness of the foundations' wording is troubling,"
Kalfayan said.
At Stanford, Ford and Rockefeller grants go to facul
ty members conducting research in a variety of fields.
