# University protests grants' anti-terrorism restrictions
## 
### NANCY WANG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford was among nine universities that recently
sent a letter asking the Ford Foundation and Rocke
feller Foundation to reconsider anti-terrorism language
they added this year to grant agreements. Provosts at the
top universities say that the provisions could infringe on
academic freedom, mirroring a general concern over re
strictive anti-terrorist policies.
The Ford and Rockefeller Foundations donated a
total of $50 million to U.S. higher education last year.
According to the Associated Press, when evidence sur
faced that grants from the Ford Foundations had funded
a radical Palestinian group, Jewish leaders called for re
strictions to prevent grant money from being used to
support terrorists.
New provisions in the Ford Foundation's grant
agreements state that no grant recipients may "promote
or engage in violence, terrorism, bigotry or the destruc
tion of any state" or "make sub-grants to any entity that
engages in these activities."
Similar clauses in the Rockefeller policy state that
grant recipients must "not directly or indirectly engage

in, promote or support other organizations or individu
als who engage in or promote terrorist activity."
In a letter sent to both foundations in late April,
provosts from nine prominent schools — including
Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Princeton and MIT — said
that they are not in a position to regulate everything said
by students and faculty members who benefit from the
grants. The provosts stated that the new policies were
too vague to enforce and that the policies could be inter
preted and used against political or cultural activities.
"Whatever university administrators may think of
the merits of the political views expressed, these fall
under the protection of freedom of academic speech,"
the provosts wrote.
Senior Associate Provost Stephanie Kalfayan added
that the provisions are at odds with Stanford's mission to
encourage the free expression of ideas.
"We're all about the free expression of ideas, and the
vagueness of the foundations' wording is troubling,"
Kalfayan said.
At Stanford, Ford and Rockefeller grants go to facul
ty members conducting research in a variety of fields.
The University received a total of over
$1 million in the past three years from the
Ford Foundation, with grants going to pro
grams such as the Committee on Black Per
forming Arts, the Peace and Cooperation in
the Asian-Pacific Region Initiative and the
Communication Department's "Grade the
News" project to improve public awareness
of news-media issues.
Approximately $500,000 was received
from the Rockefeller Foundation in the
past three years with funding going to the
Center for Integrative Research in Science
and the Humanities, the Humanities Center
for Black Performing Arts and the Stanford
Institute for Economic Policy Research.
Negotiations between the universities
and foundations are still ongoing, but repre
sentatives said both sides remain hopeful
that concerns will be addressed.
"At this point we're hoping that the uni
versities' interest and the foundations' in
terest are the same," Kalfayan said. "I think
they've shown a real willingness to talk, and

we're very hopeful that everything will
work out."
Students have also expressed concern
over the increasing amount of restrictive ac
tions being taken in the name of anti-terror
ism, particularly in the academic arena. For
example, the International Studies in High
er Education Act, or HR 3077, was passed
by the House of Representatives and pro
poses to renew the Higher Education Act.
Changes proposed by HR 3077 include
the establishment of an "International
Higher Education Advisory Board" to di
rect the Secretary of Education to study
"foreign language heritage communities"
within the United States for national securi
ty purposes. HR 3077 also calls for im
provements to "better reflect the national
needs related to homeland security, inter
national education, international affairs
and foreign language training."
"This political climate seems to inter
pret 'terrorism' much the way people used
'communism' under McCarthy," said ju
nior Eric Shih. "After the PATRIOT Act,
I'm increasingly skeptical of the term 'ter
rorism.' which is being used by a variety of
people in order to censor or suppress dis
sent," he said.
