# Baseball defeats USF, 3-1
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
If the Stanford pitching staff seemed a
little too excited about shutting down lowly
San Francisco last night, you'll have to ex
cuse them. After all, the pitching corps had
a nightmare weekend in Arizona and was
willing to take any positive momentum it
could get.
So it was a big deal that four Cardinal
pitchers combined to limit the Dons to four
hits as Stanford won its final nonconfer
ence game of the season, 3-1.
"It was really important that our pitch
ing staff threw the way they did tonight,"
said Stanford catcher John Hester. "It
helps the morale of our staff and gives us
momentum heading into the weekend."
Pete Duda and Mark Jecmen threw two
scoreless innings each and Matt Manship
threw a flawless ninth as Stanford pitchers
retired 15 consecutive San Francisco bat
ters until a last-inning single.
That was a far cry from the staff's last
two performances in Tucson, when Cardi
nal pitchers gave up 30 runs and 39 hits as
Stanford lost back-to-back games for the
first time all year.
"It was a wake-up call for us," said Man
ship, who picked up his third save of the
season. "We learned we can't go out there
with a laissez-faire attitude, and we have to
attack the hitters. If we don't approach
things right, it can snowball out of control."
With the victory, the Cardinal extended
its school-record streak of 40-win seasons
to 10. Stanford also finished off the quirky
part of its schedule; it finished 9-0 in mid
week games in 2004.
Backup catcher John Hester got his fifth
start of the season behind the plate and
made the most of his opportunity, going 2-
for-3 with a double and two RBIs. Hester
only had 23 at-bats the entire season enter
ing the game.
Second baseman Jed Lowrie went 2-for
-2 with two singles and two walks to improve
his average to .412. He's trying to become
only the seventh Stanford hitter to hit at
least .400 in a season. Ryan Garko did it last
year with a .402 average.
The Cardinal (40-10) used nine different
pitchers Sunday and Monday in Tucson, so
the bullpen was strung a little thin.
As a result, Stanford freshman pitcher
Pete Duda made only his second career ap
pearance when he entered in the seventh.
He pitched two scoreless innings and
picked up his first career strikeout when he

got Dons right fielder Stefan Gartrell
swinging.
"|Duda] hasn't gotten to pitch much but
he did his job tonight." said Stanford man
ager Mark Marquess. "Like I've always
said, if you pitch well, you'll pitch again,
and he showed us something last week
against Santa Clara."
Duda also got some defensive help. Sam
Fuld made a diving catch in right-center to
end the seventh and Lowrie made a bare
handed catch-and-throw to first to get
Dons center fielder Jonnie Knoble after
the ball ricocheted off the glove of Duda in
the eighth.
Starter Greg Reynolds (4-1) pitched
four innings in a predetermined rotation to
pick up the win. He allowed one run on
three hits and struck out three, and was
much more effective than he was in an ap

pearance over the weekend.
Probably the most important develop
ment for Stanford was the performance of
the oft-struggling Manship, who has the op
portunity play a key role in the postseason
if he can get himself back on track.
Manship was the team's closer a year
ago and had 10 saves and a solid 2003 post
season as a reliever and spot starter.
He was slated to be a starter but was
removed from the rotation after a poor
first outing against Cal-State Fullerton
during the first weekend of the year. He's
struggled ever since, with a 5.13 ERA in
18 appearances.
One day Manship will have a stellar out
ing and the next he'll get bombed. No one
can figure it out.
Some have suggested it's been
purely mental.

Does he agree?
"That's a good question," he said. "I'm
trying to figure that out myself. But what I
do know is that when your mental game is
there, the physical part falls into place."
Also notable, left fielder Danny Putnam
extended his hit streak to 10 games with a
third-inning single off the glove of San
Francisco third baseman Andrew Smith.
Dons shortstop Armand Gaerlan set a
new school-record for hit streaks (24
games) with a first-inning single. The streak
breaks the previous mark of 23 set by Tag
gert Bozied in 2000. Bozied is San Francis
co's all-time leader in hits (287), runs (213),
home-runs (60) and RBls (222).
Gaerlan had two hits and leads his club
in batting with a .358 average.
