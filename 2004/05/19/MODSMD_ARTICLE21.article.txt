# Pitchers compete for bragging rights in batting practice home run derby
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Stroll by Sunken Diamond during an
afternoon Cardinal batting practice and
you'll hear nothing but the ping of an alu
minum bat striking a ball and see nothing
but baseballs sailing over the outfield
fences. And really, what should you ex
pect from a team that has amassed 583
hits with 84 homers over the course of the
2004 season?
Take a walk inside, and you'll see a calm
Stanford hitter taking a few practice swings
before stepping into the batter's box and
tattooing a pitch over the left-field wall. He
grins before stepping back into the box and
connecting for another dinger. And then as
though a pair of homers wasn't enough, he
sends out a third.
If there weren't a number 12 across
the back of his jersey, it would be easy
to believe.
Yeah, you read that right. Number 12.
The number was worn last year by former
Cardinal slugger Ryan Garko, but this sea
son it belongs to freshman Matt Leva. The
righthanded pitcher.
You see, every once in a while when

you stroll by Sunken Diamond, it's time for pitchers' bat
ting practice.
It's a favorite tradition of the Cardinal baseball squad and
probably the only time you'll ever see senior closer David
O'Hagan tee off on a pitch delivered by manager Mark Mar
quess, all while an injured Jonny Ash handles the outfield with
his glove on the wrong hand.
Pitchers' batting practice takes place as a reward anytime that
the Cardinal sweeps a series. It's also a chance for the hurlers to
gain bragging rights on the pitching staff for feats completed at
the plate. Plus, the pitchers get to watch their position-playing
teammates shag balls for once.
It's a lot of fun," said sophomore righthander Jeff Gilmore.
"You can win a lot of respect from (hitting coach Dean Stotz],
He sits behind the cage and he judges the pitchers when they
bat. And he's pretty brutal. He's not afraid to say. That's a hor
rible swing.'"
"And there are some horrible swings," Gilmore added
with a smile.
True to Gilmore's description of him, Stotz pulled no punch
es when describing the batting skills of his pitching staff.
"None of them has a future as a hitter," he said in his typical
teasing-but-truthful fashion.
In general though, considering that they don't pick up a bat
during games or practices, the Cardinal hurlers put on a pretty

good show. In the team's most recent pitcher's BP (a reward for
Stanford's sweep of Washington State earlier this month), not
only did Leva go back-to-hack-to-back, but O'Hagan (who is ac
tually a switch-hitter) had two consecutive homers, sophomore
reliever Matt Manship jacked one over the scoreboard and
sophomore ace Mark Romanczuk hit one out as well.
"The goal is just to hit the most home runs," Gilmore ex
plained. "Last year 1 didn't hit a single home run. I was hit
ting the ball to all fields and 1 thought 1 was doing well. But
I didn't get any respect from anyone, even though I hit the
ball correctly."
Gilmore said that he changed his approach this year to an all
longball strategy and has since hit five moon shots, in what he
jokingly calls his "great turnaround".
A couple of other pitchers have performed well enough to im
press their teammates, including Manship (a former all-state
first baseman in Texas) and Romanczuk (who, according to
Gilmore, has a pretty good swing from the left side).
But, of course, Stotz is the expert.
"[Junior Mark Jecman] has the most power," he said. "Leva
is actually a pretty good-looking hitter. O'Hagan thinks he's
good, but he's not. Gilly's got a good short stroke."
It isn't surprising, considering that most of the pitching staff
batted for their high school teams. Gilmore was a designated hit-

ter when he wasn't on the mound in
high school and paced his team in
homers and RBIs. Junior Steve Pa
pazian batted at a .302 clip before
coming to Stanford, while sopho
more teammate Noah Hawthorne
hit .372. Freshman reliever Jeff
Stimpson had a .414 average with 20
RBIs and 12 doubles in his senior
year of high school.
Not all of the Cardinal hurlers
have mastered the aim-for-the
fences tactics necessary in pitcher's
BP, though. In fact, some even get
nervous beforehand and take soft
toss in the bullpen as a warm-up.
"But usually those guys are the
ones who are trying too hard, and
they don't perform well in the prac
tice anyway," Gilmore said.
Given that the pitchers can hold
their own against the 45-mph
throwing arms of assistant coach
Dave Nakama and Marquess
("We're just lobbing it," Stotz
said), it leads one to wonder if any
of them could hit off of their own
teammates on the staff.
" Not a chance," Gilmore said
without hesitation. "We have
enough trouble with our coaches."

pect from a team that has amassed 583
hits with 84 homers over the course of the
2004 season?
Take a walk inside, and you'll see a calm
Stanford hitter taking a few practice swings
before stepping into the batter's box and
tattooing a pitch over the left-field wall. He
grins before stepping back into the box and
connecting for another dinger. And then as
though a pair of homers wasn't enough, he
sends out a third.
If there weren't a number 12 across
the back of his jersey, it would be easy
to believe.
Yeah, you read that right. Number 12.
The number was worn last year by former
Cardinal slugger Ryan Garko, but this sea
son it belongs to freshman Matt Leva. The
righthanded pitcher.
You see, every once in a while when

you stroll by Sunken Diamond, it's time for pitchers' bat
ting practice.
It's a favorite tradition of the Cardinal baseball squad and
probably the only time you'll ever see senior closer David
O'Hagan tee off on a pitch delivered by manager Mark Mar
quess, all while an injured Jonny Ash handles the outfield with
his glove on the wrong hand.
Pitchers' batting practice takes place as a reward anytime that
the Cardinal sweeps a series. It's also a chance for the hurlers to
gain bragging rights on the pitching staff for feats completed at
the plate. Plus, the pitchers get to watch their position-playing
teammates shag balls for once.
It's a lot of fun," said sophomore righthander Jeff Gilmore.
"You can win a lot of respect from (hitting coach Dean Stotz],
He sits behind the cage and he judges the pitchers when they
bat. And he's pretty brutal. He's not afraid to say. That's a hor
rible swing.'"
"And there are some horrible swings," Gilmore added
with a smile.
True to Gilmore's description of him, Stotz pulled no punch
es when describing the batting skills of his pitching staff.
"None of them has a future as a hitter," he said in his typical
teasing-but-truthful fashion.
In general though, considering that they don't pick up a bat
during games or practices, the Cardinal hurlers put on a pretty

good show. In the team's most recent pitcher's BP (a reward for
Stanford's sweep of Washington State earlier this month), not
only did Leva go back-to-hack-to-back, but O'Hagan (who is ac
tually a switch-hitter) had two consecutive homers, sophomore
reliever Matt Manship jacked one over the scoreboard and
sophomore ace Mark Romanczuk hit one out as well.
"The goal is just to hit the most home runs," Gilmore ex
plained. "Last year 1 didn't hit a single home run. I was hit
ting the ball to all fields and 1 thought 1 was doing well. But
I didn't get any respect from anyone, even though I hit the
ball correctly."
Gilmore said that he changed his approach this year to an all
longball strategy and has since hit five moon shots, in what he
jokingly calls his "great turnaround".
A couple of other pitchers have performed well enough to im
press their teammates, including Manship (a former all-state
first baseman in Texas) and Romanczuk (who, according to
Gilmore, has a pretty good swing from the left side).
But, of course, Stotz is the expert.
"[Junior Mark Jecman] has the most power," he said. "Leva
is actually a pretty good-looking hitter. O'Hagan thinks he's
good, but he's not. Gilly's got a good short stroke."
It isn't surprising, considering that most of the pitching staff
batted for their high school teams. Gilmore was a designated hit-

ter when he wasn't on the mound in
high school and paced his team in
homers and RBIs. Junior Steve Pa
pazian batted at a .302 clip before
coming to Stanford, while sopho
more teammate Noah Hawthorne
hit .372. Freshman reliever Jeff
Stimpson had a .414 average with 20
RBIs and 12 doubles in his senior
year of high school.
Not all of the Cardinal hurlers
have mastered the aim-for-the
fences tactics necessary in pitcher's
BP, though. In fact, some even get
nervous beforehand and take soft
toss in the bullpen as a warm-up.
"But usually those guys are the
ones who are trying too hard, and
they don't perform well in the prac
tice anyway," Gilmore said.
Given that the pitchers can hold
their own against the 45-mph
throwing arms of assistant coach
Dave Nakama and Marquess
("We're just lobbing it," Stotz
said), it leads one to wonder if any
of them could hit off of their own
teammates on the staff.
" Not a chance," Gilmore said
without hesitation. "We have
enough trouble with our coaches."
