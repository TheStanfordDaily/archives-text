Polo
Recently, many of the alumni of the
Stanford Polo Club descended on the
Farm from across the country for the an
nual alumni weekend.
Saturday was "Tournament Day," when
current and former club members competed
at Webb Ranch, the ancestral home of the
club, and enjoyed a day of festivities. Having
served their time as students at Stanford, the
alumni relaxed in the sunshine as current
members readied the horses for the game.
Polo, known as the sport of kings, can be
a rather dangerous sport, with eight 1,200-
pound animals and their riders trying to gain
control of a ball about three inches in diam
eter with large sticks. However, though the
match was a bit rough at times, there were no
falls this year and even the Alumni, riding
horses to which they were not accustomed,
escaped unscathed.
The day was finished off with the "Grilled
Cheese Formal," a tradition that dates back
to a competition between two early club
members who disagreed on who could make
the best grilled cheese sandwich. Everyone
traded stories of their time in the club and
awards were handed out to the best humans
and horses of the past 12 months.
Taekwondo
Last Friday, Stanford Taekwondo hosted
a tri-meet between Stanford, UCLA and
Washington State at Burnham Pavilion.
Taekwondo is a combative Olympic sport
derived from traditional martial arts, which
highlights dynamic kicking, intricate foot
work, athleticism and strategy.
Several Stanford students competed in
the sparring events in both male and female
divisions, including Albert Chan (1-1),
Ernest Kuo (0-2). Pat Lu (2-1), Will Smith
(2-0). Oscar Trejo (1-1) and Khoua Vane
(1-1).
The Cardinal will hold its next big event,
the 2004 Spring Open, on May 28-29 at Burn
ham Pavilion.
