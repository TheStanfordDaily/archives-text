# No. 6 softball readies for NCAA Regional play
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At the beginning of this season, the No. 6 Cardinal softball
team (43-16, 13-8 Pacific-10 Conference) set a lofty goal for
itself: to make the College World Series. To make the CWS
— an eight-team, double-elimination tournament held in
Oklahoma City — a team must win one of the eight eight
team NCAA Regionals held around the nation, a daunting
task. In fact, the Cardinal has made the CWS only once in the
history of the program, during the 2001 season. This was the
same season in which Stanford, with an 11-10 Pac-10 record,
achieved its best conference win-loss record since the switch
to the current 21-game schedule.
However, the Cardinal is looking more and
more like a team of destiny after besting its 2001
Pac-10 mark by going 13-8 in conference and fin
ishing in a tie for second place in the Pac-10. Its
second-place conference finish marks the best
performance in the Pac-10 by a Stanford softball
team in the 10-year history of the program. This
year, the Cardinal has earned victories over top
ranked Arizona (53-4), No. 2 California (46-11)
and No. 4 UCLA (39-9) on top of 10 more victo
ries against other top-25 opponents. The Cardi
nal held its own in nearly every game of a brutal
conference schedule and came on especially
strong during the last third of its season.
For all of these accomplishments, the Cardinal was re
warded with a No. 7 overall seed and the top seed in its own
NCAA Regional at Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadium on
May 20-23. While Regional play at Smith Family Stadium
will kick off tomorrow afternoon, the Cardinal's first game
will be on Thursday evening, a 5:30 p.m. matchup against
eighth-seeded and unranked Utah (23-31).
If the Cardinal can defeat Utah tomorrow night, it will
play the winner of the contest between Pacific (34-21) and
Southern Mississippi (32-24). The Cardinal has already faced
Pacific at the very beginning of this season, a 3-2 Stanford vic
tory on Valentine's Day in the Stanford Invitational.
The Cardinal must win three games to win its regional and
advance to the CWS. Among the teams in Stanford's region
al are second-seeded and 15th-ranked Auburn (42-15), No.
16 Fresno State (47-18) and Southern Illinois (42-15). The
Cardinal has already defeated Fresno State in both games of
a March doubleheader earlier this season, but Auburn is an
enigma, as the Cardinal has yet to face the Tigers this year.
The wild-card in Stanford's regional is Southern Illinois,

which is unranked despite a
stellar record and was partly
responsible for the Cardi
nal's exit from last year's
NCAA Regional in
Tuscaloosa, Ala., after hand
ing Stanford a 6-1 loss.
"Regarding the other
teams in our regional,
there's no one we can over
look," said Cardinal third
baseman Liz Bendig.
"We've seen Pacific and
Fresno already this year, and
Southern Illinois gave us our
first loss in Alabama last
year, so we're more than
ready for some payback."
When asked to comment
about the team's perfor
mance this season, Bendig
noted that the Cardinal isn't
resting on its laurels.
"Finishing second in the
Pac-10 was huge," she said.
"It's the best our program
has ever done. But right now
we're just looking to beat
Utah on Thursday. We'll
move on from there, but it's
all about Thursday and Utah
for the present."
Playing at home should
be a definite advantage for
the Cardinal, especially in
comparison to last year's
2,500-mile trek to
Tuscaloosa for regionals.

"We're really excited about being at home," Bendig said.
"It's supposed to be a neutral site. We'll be staying off-cam
pus and we don't get to be in the home dugout every game,
but no matter what, it'll still be our home field and it is a
major advantage."
The Cardinal is coming off a 2-1 weekend against the Ore
gon schools. After losing a 1-0 heartbreaker to No. 12 Ore
gon on Friday, the Cardinal came back to win both games of
a Saturday doubleheader versus No. 18 Oregon State to sal
vage a tie for second in the Pac-10. Among the heroes of the

weekend was Pac-10 Player of the Week Jessica Allister, a se
nior catcher who moved into second-place all-time on the
Stanford career home runs list after blasting three home runs
in Saturday's doubleheader versus the Beavers. With 29 ca
reer home runs, Allister trails only legendary Cardinal alum
na Jessica Mendoza in the Stanford record books.
"We just need to play together as a team and focus on the
job we have to do," said junior designated player Heather
Shook last week. "We've learned some lessons so far this sea
son, but we still have a lot to prove."

son, but we still have a lot to prove."

At the beginning of this season, the No. 6 Cardinal softball
team (43-16, 13-8 Pacific-10 Conference) set a lofty goal for
itself: to make the College World Series. To make the CWS
— an eight-team, double-elimination tournament held in
Oklahoma City — a team must win one of the eight eight
team NCAA Regionals held around the nation, a daunting
task. In fact, the Cardinal has made the CWS only once in the
history of the program, during the 2001 season. This was the
same season in which Stanford, with an 11-10 Pac-10 record,
achieved its best conference win-loss record since the switch
to the current 21-game schedule.
However, the Cardinal is looking more and
more like a team of destiny after besting its 2001
Pac-10 mark by going 13-8 in conference and fin
ishing in a tie for second place in the Pac-10. Its
second-place conference finish marks the best
performance in the Pac-10 by a Stanford softball
team in the 10-year history of the program. This
year, the Cardinal has earned victories over top
ranked Arizona (53-4), No. 2 California (46-11)
and No. 4 UCLA (39-9) on top of 10 more victo
ries against other top-25 opponents. The Cardi
nal held its own in nearly every game of a brutal
conference schedule and came on especially
strong during the last third of its season.
For all of these accomplishments, the Cardinal was re
warded with a No. 7 overall seed and the top seed in its own
NCAA Regional at Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadium on
May 20-23. While Regional play at Smith Family Stadium
will kick off tomorrow afternoon, the Cardinal's first game
will be on Thursday evening, a 5:30 p.m. matchup against
eighth-seeded and unranked Utah (23-31).
If the Cardinal can defeat Utah tomorrow night, it will
play the winner of the contest between Pacific (34-21) and
Southern Mississippi (32-24). The Cardinal has already faced
Pacific at the very beginning of this season, a 3-2 Stanford vic
tory on Valentine's Day in the Stanford Invitational.
The Cardinal must win three games to win its regional and
advance to the CWS. Among the teams in Stanford's region
al are second-seeded and 15th-ranked Auburn (42-15), No.
16 Fresno State (47-18) and Southern Illinois (42-15). The
Cardinal has already defeated Fresno State in both games of
a March doubleheader earlier this season, but Auburn is an
enigma, as the Cardinal has yet to face the Tigers this year.
The wild-card in Stanford's regional is Southern Illinois,

which is unranked despite a
stellar record and was partly
responsible for the Cardi
nal's exit from last year's
NCAA Regional in
Tuscaloosa, Ala., after hand
ing Stanford a 6-1 loss.
"Regarding the other
teams in our regional,
there's no one we can over
look," said Cardinal third
baseman Liz Bendig.
"We've seen Pacific and
Fresno already this year, and
Southern Illinois gave us our
first loss in Alabama last
year, so we're more than
ready for some payback."
When asked to comment
about the team's perfor
mance this season, Bendig
noted that the Cardinal isn't
resting on its laurels.
"Finishing second in the
Pac-10 was huge," she said.
"It's the best our program
has ever done. But right now
we're just looking to beat
Utah on Thursday. We'll
move on from there, but it's
all about Thursday and Utah
for the present."
Playing at home should
be a definite advantage for
the Cardinal, especially in
comparison to last year's
2,500-mile trek to
Tuscaloosa for regionals.

"We're really excited about being at home," Bendig said.
"It's supposed to be a neutral site. We'll be staying off-cam
pus and we don't get to be in the home dugout every game,
but no matter what, it'll still be our home field and it is a
major advantage."
The Cardinal is coming off a 2-1 weekend against the Ore
gon schools. After losing a 1-0 heartbreaker to No. 12 Ore
gon on Friday, the Cardinal came back to win both games of
a Saturday doubleheader versus No. 18 Oregon State to sal
vage a tie for second in the Pac-10. Among the heroes of the

weekend was Pac-10 Player of the Week Jessica Allister, a se
nior catcher who moved into second-place all-time on the
Stanford career home runs list after blasting three home runs
in Saturday's doubleheader versus the Beavers. With 29 ca
reer home runs, Allister trails only legendary Cardinal alum
na Jessica Mendoza in the Stanford record books.
"We just need to play together as a team and focus on the
job we have to do," said junior designated player Heather
Shook last week. "We've learned some lessons so far this sea
son, but we still have a lot to prove."
