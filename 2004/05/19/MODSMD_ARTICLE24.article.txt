### NICK JULIANO ERICA RYAN THE POST 
(U-WIRE) ATHENS, Ohio
— Ohio University's next presi
dent will he the second alumnus
and first black man ever to lead
the university.
The Board of Trustees an
nounced yesterday that Roderick
McDavis will replace OU Presi
dent Robert Glidden in July, be
coming OU's 20th president. The
trustees selected McDavis Friday
after three finalists visited cam
pus during the preceding weeks.
McDavis, 55, graduated from
OU in 1970 with a bachelor's de
gree in social sciences and sec
ondary education. He is provost
and vice president for academic
affairs at Virginia Common
wealth University and previously
has been an administrator at the
University of Florida and the

University of Arkansas in Fayet
teville. The only other alumnus to
serve as OU president was
William Henry Scott from 1872 to
1883.
Many students clearly favored
McDavis. All three parties run
ning for Student Senate endorsed
him during Sunday night's de
bate, and his on-campus forum
drew the largest student crowd.
"That's who 1 wanted," said
Ashley Oltman, a junior organi
zational communications major.
"I like that we have someone with
a little bit of ethnicity instead of a
bunch of stuffy white guys — a
bunch of stuffy old white guys for
that matter."
When he visited campus, Mc-
Davis said he wanted to more ag
gressively recruit students from
urban areas to increase diversity
and to solicit corporate research
grants to bolster OU's budget.
"If I'm privileged enough to

come to this university, I guaran
tee — guarantee — that Ohio
University will become a diverse
university," McDavis said during
an open forum May 6. He could
not be reached for comment yes
terday.
McDavis also emphasized his
desire to make OU more entre
preneurial to compensate for
dwindling dollars from the state.
He said he would like the uni
versity to become more re
search-oriented by having facul
ty members and students do re
search and development for
large companies in Columbus
and Southeast Ohio.
Increasing the percentage of
out-of-state students also would
generate money, McDavis said.
He suggested a jump from 10 to
15 percent in coming years.
McDavis indicated that he
would continue to work with the
city to crack down on student mis

behavior Uptown and at off-cam
pus parties.
Members of the presidential
search committee saw McDavis
as someone who could fulfill the
university's goals, including in
creasing OU's national visibility
and diversity on campus, said
Tara Stuckey, a student trustee
and member of the committee.
"I can't imagine what would
be a higher honor than naming an
alumnus of the university to take
the top leadership position," said
Patricia Ackerman, a trustee and
member of the search committee.
McDavis beat David Hodge,
dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences at the University of
Washington, and Robert
Kennedy, executive vice presi
dent and provost at the Universi
ty of Maine, for the position.
The Board of Trustees will
hold a special meeting early next
month to formally elect McDavis.
