# Film students at BYU receive grant funds
## 
### ALEX KIRRY THE DAILY UNIVERSE 
(U-WIRE) PROVO, Utah â€”A
group of film students are able to use
their movie making skills alongside ex
perienced faculty and professionals to
produce a revolutionary program style
using grant funds.
A grant given to the theater media
arts department by Ira and Mary Lou
Fulton is one of many helping to in
crease the budget and quality of new stu
dent films that will air on KBYUTV in
the future. These student films are all
part of The Children's Media Initiative
Project. The project aims to increase
family solidarity through programming
specific to both parents and children.
Meredith A. Bak, a senior from Coeur
d'Alene, Idaho, is the writer of "How
Much Land Does a Man Need?" which

is adapted from the 1886 Tolstoy text of
the same title.
"The program is designed to provide
media that facilitates family interaction
rather than replace it," Bak said.
For Bak and the other students par
ticipating, the project has been a good
opportunity to gain hundreds of hours
of real filmmaking experience. With
faculty at their sides as advisers and ex
ecutive producers, the students were
able to get a professional take on their
films. First Assistant Director Dave
Axelgard was able to see the difference
the faculty and professional assistance
made on the set.
"The big difference between [the fac
ulty] and [the students] is that they've
done this," said Axelgard, "we've just
read it in books."
The project has been long and diffi
cult for these students, who have been

working on the project'since the begin
ning of January and are scheduled to fin
ish in the middle of June.
"A lot of times we end up being the ex
tras," said co-producer Melissa Brady.
Many hours were logged, not
only by the crew but also actors who
went through days of tumultuous
shooting conditions.
Bak, who also directed the film, is a
notable film student in her own right.
She was recently named the TMA
Outstanding Student of the Year
along with being named to the dean's
list. This is just the beginning with Bak
and film, however. In August, Bak will
attend graduate school at the presti
gious New York University Tisch
School of the Arts, where notable
filmmakers and writers such as Spike
Lee and Martin Scorsese made their
start in film.

The story "How Much Land Does a
Man Need" is about a farmer, Peter
Greel, who, because of immense
greed, loses his soul and his beloved
family in a deal with the devil. Because
the story was based in the 19305, the
task of costume and art direction be
came one of the most tedious issues in
shooting the film. Faculty and other
staff from the TMA department were
able to give their professional insight
in that area.
"We were lucky enough to have really
great art and costume direction," Bak said.
"How Much Land Does a Man
Need" is one of almost 10 individual
films adapted by students here at BYU.
Along with being aired on KBYU-TV,
these student films will also be a part of
BYU's Final Cut, where student films
are put to the test in front of a student
audience on campus.
