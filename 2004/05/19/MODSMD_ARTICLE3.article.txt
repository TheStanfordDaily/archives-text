### ALIYYA HAQUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Famed Brazilian author Milton Hatoum will inaugurate the writer-in-residence program for the research unit
in the division of literatures, cultures and languages today with a public reading and panel discussion of his work.
Many critics hail Hatoum as the best living Brazilian author, and his novels have received worldwide acclaim
as well as various literary prizes, including the Premio Jabuti — one of Brazil's most prestigious awards. The son
of Lebanese immigrants, Hatoum was born a Brazilian Amazonian and his books reflect this diverse background.
In a review of Hatoum's first novel, "The Tree of the Seventh Heaven," British newspaper The Guardian de
scribes Hatoum as "a tough and gifted novelist: he is able simultaneously to render the richness and strangeness
of the Amazonian vegetation and the melting-pot of cultures in it, and to tell a human tale that is complex and
wry and occasionally terrible."
Previously, Hatoum has been awarded several grants, including one from the Brazilian VITAE Foundation,
and was also a writer-in-residence at Yale University and at the International Writing Program in lowa.
The division of literatures, cultures and languages writer-in-residence program funds writers in several dif
ferent languages fora minimum four-week stay at Stanford. The program was developed by Lucia de S£, a pro
fessor of Brazilian and Spanish American literature. Sa was instrumental in inviting Hatoum to campus.
"It was not easy to convince him to come because he has a newborn child," Sd said. 'But he needed time to
finish a novel, which we promised him, along with the possibility of seeing a very rare manuscript by the writer
Euclides de Cunha, which is housed in the library's Special Collections section."
Prof. Lyris Wiedemann, director of the Portuguese Language Program, also helped secure Hatoum's visit
to campus.
"We were interested in him because of his wonderful qualities as a writer," Wiedemann said. "He is a magi
cian with words, plots and characters. His books are like a tapestry, and the more you look into them, the more
you discover not only about the story and the characters, but about universals shared by every human being."
Organizers behind the new program said they hope to foster interaction and learning between the writer and
the Stanford community as a whole, particularly students, and, as stated in the program's guidelines, "to strength
en the connections between the teaching and the practice of literature."
"The opportunity to talk directly to an author and have him tell the genesis of his ideas and creative process
is a wonderful opportunity for all," Wiedemann said. "It is something that students remember for years to come."
The Hatoum event, entitled "Writing is as Difficult as Ever: An Afternoon with Milton Hatoum," will start at
2 p.m. in Building 260, Room 252. The talk is free, open to the public and will be in English.
