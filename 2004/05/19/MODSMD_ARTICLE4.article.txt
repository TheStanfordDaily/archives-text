### RENEE LYNN HUDSON 
The recipients of the Bocock-Guerard Fiction Prize and
the Urmy-Hardy Prize for Poetry will read their winning
pieces tonight in Margaret Jacks Hall. The Creative Writ
ing Program sponsors the two creative writing contests
every spring, giving prizes of $1,000, $500 and $250 to the
first-, second- and third-place winners, respectively.
First-place winner of the Bocock-Guerard Fiction
Prize, junior Tony Tulathimutte, will read his piece,
"Scenes from the Life of the Only Girl in Water Shield,
Alaska," which he described as "about a girl and her fa
ther on a fictional island in the really, really rural
Alaskan archipelago."
The winner of the Urmy-Hardy Prize for Poetry, ju
nior Jenny Zhang, will read her poem, "Hyacinth Sum
mers," which was inspired by her grandfather. She cited
former English lecturer Rick Barot as having the most
impact on her poetry.
"Any remotely good thing I am able to do in my poems
is probably due to him," she said.
The Bocock-Guerard Fiction Prize was first awarded
in 1994 as a way to encourage and recognize creative writ
ing from undergraduates in all majors.
"Albert Guerard and his wife Maclin Bocock found, es
pecially through their teaching of freshman seminars and
in overseas Stanford campuses, that much good writing is
done by students who — for various reasons — may have
been unable to take English or creative writing courses,"
said Virginia Hess, an administrator in the creative-writ
ing program.
"They believed creative work of the imagination, liter
ary or other, is important for all students," she added.
The couple then went on to set up a fund from which
prize money is awarded each year.

A committee of readers judges the fiction manuscripts
submitted. English Prof. Elizabeth Tallent, who chaired
the committee this year, commented, "We see an abun
dance of amazingly good work, very diverse in style and
content. Albert Geurard would have appreciated the
stylistic diversity."
Junior Vauhini Vara, the second-place winner, will
read from her work "Girls," which she said is about
"these two girls who are stuck taking care of their dying
grandmother during the summer.
"Their own mother just died, but they can't talk about
it in front of their grandma," she continued. "They tell
themselves they don't want to tell her because she's senile
and she'd keep forgetting anyway, but really it's because
they don't want to talk about it themselves."
The Urmy-Hardy Prize for Poetry was first established
in 1923, in honor of Irene Hardy, a poet and Stanford pro
fessor. It was then combined with the Clarence Urmy
award, which was established in 1939 as a way to remem
ber the poet.
"The Urmy-Hardy Prize commemorates two early
20th-century California poets and friends of Stanford
University," said English Prof. Eavan Boland, who
chaired the committee of readers who judged the poetry
this year. "We extend and honor their memory in award
ing the prize for the best original poem."
Senior Eric J. Lessac-Chenan, the second-place win
ner of the Urmy-Hardy Prize will be reading his poem
"Incantation." Third-place winner Albertina Antognini
will read her piece, "Artist's Proof, 1977."
Senior Ramin Setoodeh, the third-place winner of
the Bocock-Guerard Prize will not be able to attend
the reading.
The reading will be held at 7 p.m. in the Terrace Room
of Margaret Jacks Hall. Refreshments will be provided.
