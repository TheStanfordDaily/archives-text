urged Stanford administrators to consider
turning the project into a permanent en
dowed institute, and [Lott] said that he

nonprofit organization. All Stars Helping

sive 14-volume edition of King's writing,

institute would be centered on the same
activities, with more emphasis placed on

tional conference devoted to discussing
the ideas MLK had and where those ideas

are today," Carson said. "There would be
more of a focus on eliminating poverty,
bringing about world peace, achieving so
cial justice. 1 would like to see Stanford
gain a reputation as a leading institution
in terms of exploring those issues."

dowment to make it everlasting."
