# The 						W Spot
## Why Lizzie's sister isn't coming to Stanford next year 
### 
We are deeply saddened when we think about
graduating next month and about the incoming
freshmen we won't be here to corrupt. Both of
our sisters applied to Stanford this year, and we
were hoping that they would matriculate here and uphold
the Gono-Epstein(-Barr) legacy, but no such luck. We just

don't understand what went
wrong. Their grades were top
notch, they both read at a
sophomore level and participate
in oodles of extracurricular*,
and we even helped them write
their college essays. We know
that when you read young
Katherine Epstein's essay
below, you will share in our out
rage and bewilderment that
Stanford passed her up as a first-

round draft pick in favor of one Sarah Ball. Feel free to share
these feelings with others, such as the admissions office and
major national newspapers.

My meaningful college essay
So like, this time I was thinking about what was like im
portant in life, and 1 realized that sometimes what I think is
important and what my parents have always telled me was
impor'ant were as different as day and night. In this essay I
will explaine what is more different, but what is less different
than I might have thought after all.
First of all schoolwork. It's like, when you're young,
you're parents are all. do you're homework Katherine. Well
not YOURE parents, mine.:) jk. An I'm like, I don't want to
do my homework, why should I do what you say. But then I
realized this year, I was doing my homework because I real
ly, wanted to. Successing in school became impor'ant to me
over the years. How? Why? Those are good questions. I
think it all began when I was little and my parents were al
ways like, do you're homework Katherine. And then gradu
ally I realized that was good advise.
Second of all premarital sex. My first experience was like
really traumatictizing and I sort have wish I'd waited.
Third of all drugs. I'm kind of mixed on this issue, be
cause my parents were always like, don't do drugs Katherine,
but they predicted it would be really awful and it was actual
ly kinda cool. So that was about as different as day and night.
But its possible there is consequences, I haven't thought of
yet. I will come tell you what happens, if I get in. Wink, wink.
So I think, that going to Stnaford would help me grow a
LOT as a person, and I would really contribute to the commu
nity because, I like to help others. But I realize the transition
from "secondary school" to "college" is a tough one and the
two lifestyles are as different as night and day. But another time
I had to make a difficult transition was, when I went to tennis
camp with my sister. I got, in lot's of trouble for getting caught
in the hot tub late at night with a bunch of shirtless Canadians.
So one of the tough things about that was that after that I had
to stop going to the hot tub and that was hard, because seem
ingly overnight it had turned into one of the more important as
pects of my life. But then also I was in a lot of trouble with my
parents and they didn't trust me as much after that, like every
time I would be like, hey mom I have to go to debate team prac
tice, she would be like, whatever Katherine, you are just going
to sit in a hot tub with shirtless Canadians, which was kind of
true, but at least I was doing my schoolwork!

Katherine Epstein will be attending Princeton in the fall. E
