Europe From A Backpack:
Real Stories from Young Travelers Abroad Edited
by Mark Pearson and Martin Westerman
Fifty-eight real stories from young travelers abroad offer the budget, independent, and youth traveler vivid first-person accounts of
the countries and experiences of backpackers, students, and sojourners. Offering more than just traveling facts, this guide actually
invites readers to see, taste, and experience European adventures-from sneaking into Rome's Coliseum to running with the bulls in
Pamplona, Spain. These backpackers relate experiences that people with suitcases and reservations wouldn't necessarily experience,
including sleeping in streets and hostels, 24 hours of clubbing on the Spanish island of Ibiza, and train-travel debacles. The stories
offer dozens of glimpses of the most worthwhile destinations in 11 of Europe's most well-traveled countries, not to mention
lesser-known lands revealed in the "Off the Beaten Path" section. This collection of youthful adventures will keep aspiring travelers
laughing, wondering, and walking with the storytellers who take them inside Europe's must-see places. Countries explored include
Amsterdam, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and the United
Kingdom.

The Good House: A Novel
by Tananarive Due
Early in the Twentieth Century, a powerful voodoo priestess followed her guiding spirit from New Orleans to a small town in
Washington State. But in pride and anger, Marie Toussaint unleashed a new and very different spirit. Now, ignorant of both her
heritage and the curse, Angela Toussaint returns to her dead Grandmother Marie s house, seeking to heal her fractured relationships
with her son and her husband. But the malicious spirit wishes only the destruction of the Toussaints; and as it did in her
grandmother's day, it inflicts horrific death and destruction upon the isolated town. Soon Angela has lost almost everyone she loves;
and she must somehow uncover the secrets of her unknown heritage if she is to have a prayer of saving her true love-and her own
soul. Tananarive Due has written the unconventional vampire novels My Soul to Keep and its sequel, The Living Blood, The Black
Rose (a finalist for the NAACP Image Award), and The Between (a Bram Stoker Award nominee). With Dave Barry, Edna Buchanan,
Carl Hiassen, Elmore Leonard, and eight others, Due is co-author of Naked Came the Manatee.
