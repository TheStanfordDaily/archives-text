### JESSICA BOROWICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford President John Hennessy was awarded the $1 million
Koret Prize on May 7 for his contributions to education. He shared
the honor with University of California President Robert Dynes,
who also received a $1 million grant. Koret money will be spent on
a wide variety of programs, in particular projects in the Department
of Archaeology, School of Education and environmental research
in the Middle East.
"Most of the Koret gift will go toward funding graduate-student
fellowships," said Classics and History Prof. Lan Morris, director of
Stanford's archeology center. "Altogether six or seven new gradu
ate students come to Stanford in archaeology each year, and the ar
chaeology center provides the stipends and tuition for about half
these. It also provides them with funds for research because a lot of
archaeologists have to travel overseas to take part in fieldwork."
The grant will also support two new initiatives in the Middle
East. The first. Bridging the Rift, is a project led by Biological Sci
ences Prof. Marc Feldman aimed at redesigning and developing the
academic program of an environmental research facility on the bor
der between Israel and Jordan.
The second initiative is a marine-science research workshop in
Eilat and the Gulf of Aqaba in which Stanford students and faculty
will participate with their Jordanian and Israeli counterparts.
In addition, the grant will go towards the continuation of Stan
ford's involvement in the Carnegie Corporation's Teachers fora
New Era initiative.
"The goal of Teachers fora New Era is
to bring faculty together from the School
of Education, H & S, Engineering and
Earth Sciences, and to train students to
become teachers in grades K through 12,"
said Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to Pres
ident Hennessy. "We want to make sure
that our teachers have the subject-matter
expertise as well as the pedagogical train
ing to provide the best education. The
grant will try to develop hard evidence to

determine what strategies are truly effec
tive when it comes to training teachers."
He added, "The Teachers Fora New
Era grant and the collaborations in the
Middle East are focused on solving im
portant problems by bringing together
faculty from a wide range of disciplines.
They have been chosen because they
provide a good match between the
Koret Foundation's interests and our
needs. In addition, these are initiatives
that have the support of the faculty and
their deans."
Hennessy is the fourth Stanford pro
fessor to receive the Koret Prize, follow
ing Steven Zipperstein in 1998, and
Arnold Eisen and Gerhard Casper in
1999. In 2002 the Koret Prize was award-

Ed to the Koret Task Force on K-12 Edu
cation, a joint-education program be
tween the Hoover Institution and the
Koret Foundation.
"Ties between Koret and Stanford ex
tend back to Koret's earliest days, with
grants totaling more than $13 million in
the foundation's 25-year history," said
Koret Director of Communications
Susan Wolfe, Class of '81. "Koret Foun
dation President Tad Taube is a Stanford
alumnus; board members Michael
Boskin, Abraham D. Sofaer and Richard
Atkinson serve or have served on the
Stanford faculty."
Wachtel noted, "There is great mutu
al respect between the foundation and
the University."
