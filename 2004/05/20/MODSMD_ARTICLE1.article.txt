Stanford President John Hennessy was awarded the $1 million
Koret Prize on May 7 for his contributions to education. He shared
the honor with University of California President Robert Dynes,
who also received a $1 million grant. Koret money will be spent on
a wide variety of programs, in particular projects in the Department
of Archaeology, School of Education and environmental research
in the Middle East.
"Most of the Koret gift will go toward funding graduate-student
fellowships," said Classics and History Prof. Lan Morris, director of
Stanford's archeology center. "Altogether six or seven new gradu
ate students come to Stanford in archaeology each year, and the ar
chaeology center provides the stipends and tuition for about half
these. It also provides them with funds for research because a lot of
archaeologists have to travel overseas to take part in fieldwork."
The grant will also support two new initiatives in the Middle
East. The first. Bridging the Rift, is a project led by Biological Sci
ences Prof. Marc Feldman aimed at redesigning and developing the
academic program of an environmental research facility on the bor
der between Israel and Jordan.
The second initiative is a marine-science research workshop in
Eilat and the Gulf of Aqaba in which Stanford students and faculty
will participate with their Jordanian and Israeli counterparts.
In addition, the grant will go towards the continuation of Stan
ford's involvement in the Carnegie Corporation's Teachers fora
