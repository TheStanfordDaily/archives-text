## Government should grant same-sex couples the right to get married 
### VINNI INTERSIMONE SEX COLUMNIST 
Pat and Kevin have been together for 30
years. They have two children, a cat, a dog
and a mortgage. Like the heads of any
other family, Pat and Kevin have to provide
for and protect their family. Unlike other
families, however, they have no rights to
over 1,000 federal marriage protections.
Their family does not have the same fiscal
protections gained through special marital
rights in social security, employment bene
fits, tax breaks and death protections. If ei
ther one of them were to be hurt in an acci
dent, his spouse would have no right to visit
the other in a hospital and no right to advise
doctors on how to treat him. If either were
from another country, the other would not

be able to apply for the legal right to live in
the United States. Why? Because our gov
ernment will not allow Pat and Kevin to get
married.
Families of same-sex partners have just as
much of a right to the benefits and protec
tions that come with marriage as families of
opposite-sex partners. The Fourteenth
Amendment requires the government to
give the same rights to every citizen, forming
the foundation of the equal rights amend
ments that abolished slavery, granted voting
rights to all citizens and led to the Civil
Rights Movement that ended segregation.
Marriage is a right granted by the govern
ment, and under the Fourteenth Amend
ment. it must be granted to all citizens, not
just heterosexuals.
Many describe marriage as a "privi
lege" and not a "right," a fundamental fal

lacy. People holding this view believe that
just because marriage has requirements, it
is a privilege, ignoring the fact that many
rights have requirements and restrictions.
A citizen must be at least 18 years old to
vote, and, in many counties, must be a reg
istered voter. Do these requirements
make voting a privilege and not a right?
The requirements of marriage state that
one must be single, of age and not related
to their intended spouse, but how do these
requirements transform marriage from a
right to a privilege?
Many critics of gay marriage point to polls
showing the majority of Americans are
against same-sex marriages, yet the Consti
tution— and the Fourteenth Amendment's
guarantee to equal rights — was written to
protect the rights of the minorities when the
majority was not acting in a just manner. The

American government has no authority to
deny same-sex couples the right to marriage
they deserve and the benefits of marriage
they need to raise a healthy family simply be
cause the majority of Americans surveyed
do not agree with gay lifestyle. The Constitu
tion is based on fundamental human rights,
not popularity polls.
In recognition of these ideals, on Mon
day, the state of Massachusetts wed same
sex couples, marking the first gay marriages
fully recognized by a state government. If
we glance back at Fat and Kevin, however, if
these two get married in Massachusetts,
their marriage will not be recognized by the
two dozen states that have passed or are at
tempting to pass amendments to their state
constitutions banning gay marriage. Even if
they live in Massachusetts, they are still like
ly to be denied the 1,049 federal rights and

benefits given to opposite-sex couple be
cause the federal Defense of Marriage Act
defines marriage as a union between a man
and a woman.
The victories for equality in Mas
sachusetts should be celebrated, but full
equality has not been achieved. While Pat
and Kevin may be able to get "officially"
married in Massachusetts, their marriage is
Still a second-class marriage, and their rights
as American citizens and as an American
family remain unequal. For same-sex cou
ples to achieve full equality, both the federal
government and state governments must
recognize their right to marry.
