## Editors Note Attend today's ad ethics panel 
### 
On Oct. 21 of last year, The Stanford Daily
began running a series of advertisements
submitted by the One Truth Foundation.
The ads sparked a flurry of responses from
University community members who felt that they were
disparaging to Palestinians. Some individuals registered
their support for the publication of the ads on the
grounds that they fostered dialogue, while others ex
pressed disappointment that The Daily would allow
such a series to run.
Then-Editor in Chief Ramin Setoodeh. in a Nov. 4
editor's note addressed to the paper's readership, reit
erated the rationale behind his original decision to run
the ads, and the series continued to be published in the
paper until its scheduled stop date of Nov. 21. While let
ters and op-eds in opposition to the publication of the
ads did not stop the series from running, these submis
sions did raise an interesting set of questions about the
ethics of advertising. What sort of advertising is accept
able fora print publication such as a newspaper to pub
lish? Is deciding not to run a potentially offensive ad a
form of censorship, or can it be justified under certain
circumstances? Are there certain types of ads that
should not ever be run?
While are questions that might be difficult — if not
impossible — to resolve in a manner that satisfies every
reader of our newspaper, we believe it is important that
these sorts of concerns are considered and debated by the

campus community. In response to the extensive campus
dialogue that took place after The Daily's publication of
the One Truth Foundation ads. the paper's Board of Di
rectors decided to host a panel addressing issues sur
rounding the ethics of advertising. The panel, co-spon
sored by The Stanford Daily and the Ethics in Society
Program, will take place today at 5:30 p.m. in Piggott Hall.
I will be moderating the discussion, which will fea
ture three guest panelists: Barbara Roessner, who is a
2004 Knight Fellow and a deputy managing editor at
the Hardford Courant; Communication Prof. Ted
Glasser, director of the Graduate Program in Journal
ism and a member of The Daily's Board of Directors;
and Tobias Wolff, a visiting professor of law from UC-
Davis who researches issues regarding free speech and
the First Amendment. The event will be a chance for
the University community to come together to consid
er some difficult yet common ethical dilemmas that
confront journalists and the media in general, and I
encourage you all to attend.
