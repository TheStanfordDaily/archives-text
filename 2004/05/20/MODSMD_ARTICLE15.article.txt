# THE 						BROOKLYN BRAT
## Toward a more practical degree 
### 
Even though temperatures
are consistently slipping
below 70 degrees and some
people have taken to wear
ing their winter scarves to class in the
morning, summer break is just
around the corner. Pretty soon there
will be hundreds of Shurgard Storage
containers around campus, and ev
eryone will be frantically filling in the
holes in their walls with toothpaste
and whiteout.
If I were a senior right now, I
would be preparing to ship all of my
stuff back home to New York, be
cause I am almost certain that I would
not yet have a job lined up. I would
probably boycott the rest of my class
es, cursing myself for majoring in
communication and American stud
ies, because after all. what kind of a
job can you get with either of those
majors?
As a matter of fact, what can you
do with any of Stanford's majors?
Sure, if you're a techie, there is always
a position waiting for you at Google,
but Stanford truly lacks in practical
majors that can guarantee a job in
today's market.
Why not offer major programs in
the practical science of bartending?
Honestly, even in the hardest of eco
nomic times, a good bartender can be
guaranteed work, because not even a
job recession can stop the nation
from drinking.
Likewise, Stanford should offer

certification classes in the arts of mas
sage and exotic dance, and the drama
department should look into teach
ing a quarter's worth of circus tricks

for graduates to
fall back on when
they get rejected
from consulting
jobs at McKinney
and Goldman
Sachs.
But going to
college isn't just
about being able
to get a good job
at the end of four
years.

Even though it is 2004 and the
Cult of Domesticity is more than 50
years behind us, there are still some
people here just to get their "Mrs."
Degree. For those girls out to gradu
ate into ladies of leisure, the time
schedule should include a standard
home economics curriculum, with
mandatory classes in cooking, clean
ing and balancing checkbooks.
Still, not all classes should be fo
cused on how they can be useful to us
once we leave Stanford. Too many
students spend too much of their time
here thinking beyond graduation.
There should be compulsory classes
aimed at improving the overall quali
ty of life for students while they are
still in college. For one, I would like to
see a class on personal hygiene, with
an emphasis on the importance of

daily showers, regular tooth brush
ing, and habitual laundry days â€” es
pecially during finals week.
I'm sure that anyone who has ever
been cut in line at the post office,
trampled at a party or peed on at a
bar will agree that nearly everyone
here needs a year or two of socializa
tion and standard etiquette classes.
These would include lessons in table
manners, self-control and all the
other things your parents should
have taught you before sending you
to kindergarten. Students would also
be encouraged to take on indepen
dent studies of subjects like biking,
penmanship and frat-party dance
technique.
Certainly Stanford offers the best
in every field from Human Biology to
History, but what use is state-of-the
art knowledge of quantum mechanics
if you don't know how to work a mi
crowave and you still put red socks in
the laundry machine with your
whites?
Luckily, 1 have an extra year here
to figure out these minor details of
life, but to the graduating seniors: 1
wish you luck in calculating your gro
cery store bills and figuring out how
to use a measuring cup.
