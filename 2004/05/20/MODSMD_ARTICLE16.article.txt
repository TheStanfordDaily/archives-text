## Admit Weekend: a Darwinian dream 
### 
I think by now, everyone is pretty
familiar with the story of one Miss
Sarah Ball. However, in case
you've been living under a rock
— or, even more unlikely, have some
thing better to do than read the Daily's
Opinions page everyday — here's a
quick rundown:
Mademoiselle Ball, a lovely little
princess from Alexandria, Virginia,
was fortunate enough to gain admit
tance to our fair university. At this
point, I'm pretty sure I could make a
joke about the infamous Admission
Mistake, but I'll try and bottle up the
cattiness for later.
Upon receiving her acceptance,
Sarah found herself in a situation fa
miliar to many of us; how to decide be
tween the wonderful institutions that
had deemed her worthy? As do so
many students in her situation. Miss
Ball decided to help her decision by at
tending Admit Weekend here on the
Farm. So far, so good, right?
Well, fast-forwarding a day and a
half, we have our young protagonist
fleeing Admit weekend in a taxicab,
eager to escape the unbearable tor
ment her hosts had put her through.
Going two weeks further, we find
Sarah Ball, columnist extraordinaire,
detailing her harrowing experience on
the Sunday Outlook page of the Wash
ington Post and her consequent deci
sion to seek refuge at Duke University.
When I first heard about all of this, 1
immediately feared the worst. What
kind of horrible disaster could have be
fallen a doe-eyed high school senior to
provoke such a sour response? Visions
of sadistic RoHo's. cruel fellow stu
dents, and even — gasp — Stern Din
ing immediately flashed through my

head.
Well, after reading the article, any
possible sympathy I might have felt dis-

appeared faster
than Natty Light at
an SAE beer pong
tournament. In
case any of you are
still feeling any em
pathy for our
young friend, let's
have a quick look
at some quotes
from her journalis-

tic tour de force: "This event [Admit
Weekend] ... was nothing but an
overblown sales pitch — complete with
glitzy packaging, superficial presenta
tion and the ever-peppy salespeople."
Oh, heavens. How outrageous! Stu
dents excited about their university
trying to spread that enthusiasm to a
new generation. Miss Ball must have
left out the part of the story where
Head HoHo's get paid a thousand dol
lar for every student that enrolls, be
cause without that, this complaint just
doesn't make any sense.
The hundreds of students who do
nate their rooms and time don't get any
reward except the satisfaction they get
from helping others, and comparing
them to used car salesmen is nothing
but catty and disingenuous. Don't
worry, however; our young friend is
just getting warmed up.
"Where were the unscheduled con
versations with new acquaintances?
When could I ask questions of current
students and not receive a contrived an
swer? Not only had the activities thus far
been utterly ineffective at convincing me
to enroll, they also seemed designed to
prevent me from having an honest, un

varnished look at campus life."
You caught us Sarah; I was hoping
no one would unravel our insidious
plot to shield you from the way things
really are here at Stanford. At least she
didn't stumble on the weekly manda
tory beatings and electroshock thera
py; that would have really been embar
rassing. Oh, and I'm shocked that you
couldn't strike up any conversations
with new acquaintances — if only any
thing in your article could give a clue to
why that might be the case.
Okay, I'll admit; I've been pretty
hard on Miss Ball so far. In the interest
of fairness, 1 should also add that there
were some parts of her article that were
right on target. For instance, she writes,
"I confess I'd never expected to find
myself at Stanford Admit Weekend.
My acceptance was nothing short of
shocking... The odds of being accept
ed, I had concluded, were decidedly
not in my favor." 1 think we can all
agree with that.
Finally, I would like to take this last
opportunity to applaud Admit Week
end, and everyone that made it hap
pen. When most people talk about this
event, they focus on the wonderful op
portunity it provides to help show Ad
mits how great a place Stanford is.
However, I think Miss Ball has made it
abundantly clear that it also helps weed
out people who have no business here.
I can only imagine that Duke is wishing
it had achieved the same success.
