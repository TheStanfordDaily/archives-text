## Stanford should resist labor action coalition's living wage campaiggn 
### NATE HILGER 
The Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion (SLAC) has for some time aggres
sively campaigned for Stanford Uni
versity workers to receive a "living
wage" several dollars per hour higher
than the market wage. This policy will
not result in sustainable redistribution
of income to low-wage workers, and
may raise tuition costs, thereby lower
ing the demand for Stanford educa
tion. The administration should con
tinue to resist this SLAC demand.
Let us imagine the scenario in
which Stanford adopts a living wage
above what it would otherwise pay its
workers. First, the higher wage will in
duce prospective workers with better
qualifications (more education, more
experience, etc.) to apply for Stanford
jobs. This will result in paying higher
skilled workers what they could have
earned elsewhere.
The only workers to receive wages
greater than their alternative non-

Stanford wages are the workers who
were hired by Stanford at the initial
lower wage. As these workers quit or
retire over time, to be replaced by
workers with greater wage-earning
characteristics, the redistributive ef
fects of the policy will disappear.
Second, virtually ail economists
agree that the advent of large wage in
creases (such as those resulting from
adoption of a "living wage") will de
crease the demand for labor and hence
reduce employment. If Stanford has to
pay.say. $17 per hour for janitorial ser
vices, then it will, in addition to hiring
more-qualified janitors, make do with
hiring fewer janitors.
Although employment may not de
crease immediately in the form of lay
offs, it will decrease over time in the
form of reduced hiring rates. This is not
good news for the people who would
have been eager to work for Stanford
at the lower wage and who will now
have to seek work elsewhere.
However, the severity of this trade

off between higher wages and lower
employment depends on several fac
tors. One consideration is that the
trade-off will be less severe to the ex
tent that the employer can pass on the
cost of higher wages to the consumer in
the form of higher prices. In this case,
the consumers are current and poten
tial Stanford students. If students are
willing to pay higher tuition costs to
cover higher wages for Stanford work
ers, then higher wages may not entail
lower employment.
Of course, if Stanford's tuition is
much higher than tuitions at Harvard,
Princeton and Yale, it will have more
difficulty recruiting the best (as op
posed to just the wealthiest) students.
However, assume that the resultant
tuition differential would be too small
to affect prospective student enroll
ment decisions, or that SLAC con
vinced all of Stanford's competitors to
raise wages and hence tuitions as well.
In this case Stanford students arc pay
ing an education "tax" to finance Stan

ford's living wage policy.
Even if Stanford's low-wage work
ers have a right to higher incomes — as
many political philosophers believe
they do — they do not have a legal
right to higher incomes in the specific
form of higher wages. Thus Stanford's
living wage policy essentially consti
tutes a charitable donation to its work
ers.
But we must ask ourselves: Why
should Stanford workers be the sole re
cipients of this charitable donation?
Why shouldn't Stanford also donate
funds to low-wage workers at other es
tablishments in Palo Alto, such as Wal
green's Drug Store or the many taque
rias on Middlefield?
If we are not obligated to prioritize
locals, why not contribute to the most
desperately needy workers in Thailand
or Haiti or Bangladesh? Arbitrarily fo
cusing all of this charity — rather than
some fraction — on Stanford workers
merely because we personally interact
with them seems unfair to non-Stan

ford workers.
Most serious ethicists agree that all
of these low-wage workers deserve
greater shares of the world's resource
pie. But a tax on education to finance
this form of charity is a bad response to
the problem.
To the extent we are serious about
donating Stanford funds to low-wage
workers, we will raise tuition and re
duce the demand for Stanford educa
tion. This is unfortunate, because many
students obviously use their Stanford
educations to make extremely mean
ingful contributions to the welfare of
society, including the welfare of low
wage workers.
For example, Prof. John Pencavel,
much maligned recently by SLAC for
his previous assistance to Pinochet's
labor minister, dedicates himself to
teaching a superb class on labor eco
nomics which provides, among other
things, lucid analyses of policy inter
ventions into the labor market.
Students interested in helping the

less fortunate members of society
should spend time taking well-taught
classes such as Economics 145, rather
than aggressively lobbying for compli
cated changes which require much
study to understand.
Perhaps, though I speak only for
myself, the above arguments — rather
than any supposed indifference toward
low-wage workers — can help to ex
plain why some University administra
tors and professors do not avidly sup
port SLAC's demand fora living wage.
SLAC members should recognize
that the issues involved merit careful
theoretical debate rather than aggres
sive ideological warfare. They should
also refrain from needlessly question
ing the motives of others who study the
issues and reach different conclusions
thanthev do.

low-wage workers — can help to ex
plain why some University administra
tors and professors do not avidly sup
port SLAC's demand fora living wage.
SLAC members should recognize
that the issues involved merit careful
theoretical debate rather than aggres
sive ideological warfare. They should
also refrain from needlessly question
ing the motives of others who study the
issues and reach different conclusions
thanthev do.

The Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion (SLAC) has for some time aggres
sively campaigned for Stanford Uni
versity workers to receive a "living
wage" several dollars per hour higher
than the market wage. This policy will
not result in sustainable redistribution
of income to low-wage workers, and
may raise tuition costs, thereby lower
ing the demand for Stanford educa
tion. The administration should con
tinue to resist this SLAC demand.
Let us imagine the scenario in
which Stanford adopts a living wage
above what it would otherwise pay its
workers. First, the higher wage will in
duce prospective workers with better
qualifications (more education, more
experience, etc.) to apply for Stanford
jobs. This will result in paying higher
skilled workers what they could have
earned elsewhere.
The only workers to receive wages
greater than their alternative non-

Stanford wages are the workers who
were hired by Stanford at the initial
lower wage. As these workers quit or
retire over time, to be replaced by
workers with greater wage-earning
characteristics, the redistributive ef
fects of the policy will disappear.
Second, virtually ail economists
agree that the advent of large wage in
creases (such as those resulting from
adoption of a "living wage") will de
crease the demand for labor and hence
reduce employment. If Stanford has to
pay.say. $17 per hour for janitorial ser
vices, then it will, in addition to hiring
more-qualified janitors, make do with
hiring fewer janitors.
Although employment may not de
crease immediately in the form of lay
offs, it will decrease over time in the
form of reduced hiring rates. This is not
good news for the people who would
have been eager to work for Stanford
at the lower wage and who will now
have to seek work elsewhere.
However, the severity of this trade

off between higher wages and lower
employment depends on several fac
tors. One consideration is that the
trade-off will be less severe to the ex
tent that the employer can pass on the
cost of higher wages to the consumer in
the form of higher prices. In this case,
the consumers are current and poten
tial Stanford students. If students are
willing to pay higher tuition costs to
cover higher wages for Stanford work
ers, then higher wages may not entail
lower employment.
Of course, if Stanford's tuition is
much higher than tuitions at Harvard,
Princeton and Yale, it will have more
difficulty recruiting the best (as op
posed to just the wealthiest) students.
However, assume that the resultant
tuition differential would be too small
to affect prospective student enroll
ment decisions, or that SLAC con
vinced all of Stanford's competitors to
raise wages and hence tuitions as well.
In this case Stanford students arc pay
ing an education "tax" to finance Stan

ford's living wage policy.
Even if Stanford's low-wage work
ers have a right to higher incomes — as
many political philosophers believe
they do — they do not have a legal
right to higher incomes in the specific
form of higher wages. Thus Stanford's
living wage policy essentially consti
tutes a charitable donation to its work
ers.
But we must ask ourselves: Why
should Stanford workers be the sole re
cipients of this charitable donation?
Why shouldn't Stanford also donate
funds to low-wage workers at other es
tablishments in Palo Alto, such as Wal
green's Drug Store or the many taque
rias on Middlefield?
If we are not obligated to prioritize
locals, why not contribute to the most
desperately needy workers in Thailand
or Haiti or Bangladesh? Arbitrarily fo
cusing all of this charity — rather than
some fraction — on Stanford workers
merely because we personally interact
with them seems unfair to non-Stan

ford workers.
Most serious ethicists agree that all
of these low-wage workers deserve
greater shares of the world's resource
pie. But a tax on education to finance
this form of charity is a bad response to
the problem.
To the extent we are serious about
donating Stanford funds to low-wage
workers, we will raise tuition and re
duce the demand for Stanford educa
tion. This is unfortunate, because many
students obviously use their Stanford
educations to make extremely mean
ingful contributions to the welfare of
society, including the welfare of low
wage workers.
For example, Prof. John Pencavel,
much maligned recently by SLAC for
his previous assistance to Pinochet's
labor minister, dedicates himself to
teaching a superb class on labor eco
nomics which provides, among other
things, lucid analyses of policy inter
ventions into the labor market.
Students interested in helping the

less fortunate members of society
should spend time taking well-taught
classes such as Economics 145, rather
than aggressively lobbying for compli
cated changes which require much
study to understand.
Perhaps, though I speak only for
myself, the above arguments — rather
than any supposed indifference toward
low-wage workers — can help to ex
plain why some University administra
tors and professors do not avidly sup
port SLAC's demand fora living wage.
SLAC members should recognize
that the issues involved merit careful
theoretical debate rather than aggres
sive ideological warfare. They should
also refrain from needlessly question
