## Monty's gone and so are the glory years 
### 
Over his 13 years at Stanford, Ted Le
land has become one of the most
highly regarded athletic directors in
the nation. The athletic achievement
on the Farm has been nothing short of amazing.
Nine straight Sears Directors' Cups. Future
Olympians and professional athletes around
every corner.
And now, everything's going to hell.
Stanford is in second place in the Directors'
Cup standings — behind Michigan of all
schools. Buddy Teevens is still the head coach
of the football team with no end to the misery
that is the Cardinal squad in sight. Josh Chil
dress is making the jump to the NBA. And now
this. I got the news from the ESPN ticker at Old
Pro while watching my beloved Kings lose, and
1 would be lying if I said my heart didn't drop —
and I'm absolutely cynical to the core. Mike

Montgomery who, along
with Tara VanDerveer, is
one of Stanford's two true
fixtures, is following his Ail-
American to the NBA to
coach the hapless Golden
State Warriors.
It's gotta be a joke, right?
The Warriors? The War
riors are to NBA what the
Stanford football team is to
the NCAA. The Warriors

may not have the worst
record in the NBA. but they are clearly a fran
chise going nowhere.
Now I'm no career counselor, but going to
the Warriors has got to be a dead-end move.
They've got an owner in Chris Cohan who is in
strong competition with Donald Sterling for
the worst owner in the NBA. Their franchise
player is... oh wait, they have no franchise
player. They managed to do just well enough so
that they won't have a decent chance to get a
lottery pick that will make a real difference on
the team. And GM Gary St. Jean has made
more bad moves than Mark Madsen has on the
dance floor.
How did Monty, who by making guys like
Matt Lottich and Nick Robinson look like su
perstars on the basketball court makes himself
look like Albert Einstein, decide that it was a
good idea to leave the Farm?
Doesn't he love it here? Doesn't he love
being able to take afternoons off and head over
to the Stanford Golf Course? Doesn't he love
the Sixth Man Club's undying passion? Appar
ently not as much as NBA money.
I never thought I'd say it, but after today I
have a little bit more respect for Mike
Krzyzewski. He may be evil, but at least he's
stuck around at Duke.
Maybe Monty feels like he's accomplished
everything he can short of winning a title and
the way the tournament is set up, it might never
happen, because it's just so much of a crapshoot.
Seems to me that Monty should take note
that, despite the nature of the tournament,
every collegiate coach with a shot at the Hall of
Fame also has a national title under his belt.
Some had to wait almost forever for it — Jim
Boeheim, Jim Calhoun to name a couple — but
it happened.
But hey, bigger and better things are on the
horizon. Why go through another rebuilding
year with a program you're in complete control
over when you can jump to the NBA and an
swer to tools like Chris Mullin, St. Jean and
Cohan while praying you can pick up a free
agent along the lines of Kobe Bryant — like
that's ever going to happen.
Not only is Montgomery essentially com
mitting career suicide by signing with the
Warriors, but what's worse is that he's left the
Stanford program in utter disarray. Because
much or all of the assistant coaching staff will
probably also depart, the team will be left
without any semblance of continuity, one of
the absolute hallmarks and primary reasons of
the program's success.
And way to go with the timing, Monty.
Three big recruits coming in this weekend. And
with J-Chi 11 leaving and Matt Lottich graduat
ing, its not like the program needs new talent.
The glory of the NBA has got to be tempting
— but the Warriors? In general, a head coach
ing position in the NBA is already one of the
least secure positions in the entire world, and it's
hard to see how anyone could think they would
stick with Golden State. The Warriors have had
more head coaches in the past five years than
Teyo Johnson's had girls in the last five minutes.
This is where Ted Leland's supposed genius
should have come into play. How could the guy
not keep Monty around? He's built up the ath
letic endowment to an absolutely unreal
amount — he couldn't have thrown a chunk of
that at Montgomery?
Leland has just lost his touch. Montgomery
was the Stanford basketball program. And if
Leland thinks that he's going to be able to con
tinue getting top recruits in other sports with a
football team of the 2003 caliber, a basketball
team that could be headed in the same direction
and the administration clamping down on the
party scene, he's sorely mistaken.
So while Montgomery has headed out the
door, at this point it would be a good thing if Le
land followed suit. This school has already gone
to hell.

Cup standings — behind Michigan of all
schools. Buddy Teevens is still the head coach
of the football team with no end to the misery
that is the Cardinal squad in sight. Josh Chil
dress is making the jump to the NBA. And now
this. I got the news from the ESPN ticker at Old
Pro while watching my beloved Kings lose, and
1 would be lying if I said my heart didn't drop —
and I'm absolutely cynical to the core. Mike

Montgomery who, along
with Tara VanDerveer, is
one of Stanford's two true
fixtures, is following his Ail-
American to the NBA to
coach the hapless Golden
State Warriors.
It's gotta be a joke, right?
The Warriors? The War
riors are to NBA what the
Stanford football team is to
the NCAA. The Warriors

may not have the worst
record in the NBA. but they are clearly a fran
chise going nowhere.
Now I'm no career counselor, but going to
the Warriors has got to be a dead-end move.
They've got an owner in Chris Cohan who is in
strong competition with Donald Sterling for
the worst owner in the NBA. Their franchise
player is... oh wait, they have no franchise
player. They managed to do just well enough so
that they won't have a decent chance to get a
lottery pick that will make a real difference on
the team. And GM Gary St. Jean has made
more bad moves than Mark Madsen has on the
dance floor.
How did Monty, who by making guys like
Matt Lottich and Nick Robinson look like su
perstars on the basketball court makes himself
look like Albert Einstein, decide that it was a
good idea to leave the Farm?
Doesn't he love it here? Doesn't he love
being able to take afternoons off and head over
to the Stanford Golf Course? Doesn't he love
the Sixth Man Club's undying passion? Appar
ently not as much as NBA money.
I never thought I'd say it, but after today I
have a little bit more respect for Mike
Krzyzewski. He may be evil, but at least he's
stuck around at Duke.
Maybe Monty feels like he's accomplished
everything he can short of winning a title and
the way the tournament is set up, it might never
happen, because it's just so much of a crapshoot.
Seems to me that Monty should take note
that, despite the nature of the tournament,
every collegiate coach with a shot at the Hall of
Fame also has a national title under his belt.
Some had to wait almost forever for it — Jim
Boeheim, Jim Calhoun to name a couple — but
it happened.
But hey, bigger and better things are on the
horizon. Why go through another rebuilding
year with a program you're in complete control
over when you can jump to the NBA and an
swer to tools like Chris Mullin, St. Jean and
Cohan while praying you can pick up a free
agent along the lines of Kobe Bryant — like
that's ever going to happen.
Not only is Montgomery essentially com
mitting career suicide by signing with the
Warriors, but what's worse is that he's left the
Stanford program in utter disarray. Because
much or all of the assistant coaching staff will
probably also depart, the team will be left
without any semblance of continuity, one of
the absolute hallmarks and primary reasons of
the program's success.
And way to go with the timing, Monty.
Three big recruits coming in this weekend. And
with J-Chi 11 leaving and Matt Lottich graduat
ing, its not like the program needs new talent.
The glory of the NBA has got to be tempting
— but the Warriors? In general, a head coach
ing position in the NBA is already one of the
least secure positions in the entire world, and it's
hard to see how anyone could think they would
stick with Golden State. The Warriors have had
more head coaches in the past five years than
Teyo Johnson's had girls in the last five minutes.
This is where Ted Leland's supposed genius
should have come into play. How could the guy
not keep Monty around? He's built up the ath
letic endowment to an absolutely unreal
amount — he couldn't have thrown a chunk of
that at Montgomery?
Leland has just lost his touch. Montgomery
was the Stanford basketball program. And if
Leland thinks that he's going to be able to con
tinue getting top recruits in other sports with a
football team of the 2003 caliber, a basketball
team that could be headed in the same direction
and the administration clamping down on the
party scene, he's sorely mistaken.
So while Montgomery has headed out the
door, at this point it would be a good thing if Le
land followed suit. This school has already gone
to hell.

Over his 13 years at Stanford, Ted Le
land has become one of the most
highly regarded athletic directors in
the nation. The athletic achievement
on the Farm has been nothing short of amazing.
Nine straight Sears Directors' Cups. Future
Olympians and professional athletes around
every corner.
And now, everything's going to hell.
