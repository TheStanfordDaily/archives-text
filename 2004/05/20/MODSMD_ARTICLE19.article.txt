# Card to face Kentucky
## 
### MIA R. LEE STAFF WRITER 
Time and time again, the achingly "so
close, yet so far" score of 4-3 has come to
haunt competitors in the NCAA women's
tennis championships.
It haunted top-ranked Stanford last year
in the NCAA final, when the team lost to
Florida, 4-3.
It haunted No. 14 California (17-9) this
year, when the Golden Bears were maimed
on their home turf in the second round by
surprising No. 16 Fresno State (22-3), 4-3.
And, as if irony had taken the referee's
chair on No. 2 Florida's center court, it
haunted the top-seeded Gators, as they fell
to Miami on Saturday, 4-3.
The courts are clear for today's NCAA
round of 16 in Athens, Ga., where the Car
dinal steps up with a 25-0 record to face No.
17 Kentucky (19-11). But after a year of re
flection and anticipation of prying victory
from the Gators' jaws met its premature
end, Stanford has reaffirmed the need to
take NCAA competition one day a time.
"Those [second-round losses] were re
ally big surprises," Cardinal senior Lau
ren Barnikow said. "Usually, in NCAA
women's tennis, there fare] no upsets
until maybe the round of 16, and even
that's rare."
Though it would seem that Florida's
early loss would steal the thunder from
Stanford's race for the finish, team mem
bers and Stanford head coach Lele Forood
insist otherwise.
"Maybe [in past matches] we were talk
ing a little bit too much ahead," Barnikow
said. "With those early losses, it's definitely
going to help all the underdog teams boost
their confidence. And we saw that we just
need to need to worry about our next
match."
Forood explained: "[Florida's loss] really
doesn't alter our [overall] view of the tour
nament. At this point, the tournament is
very competitive and our biggest focus is
Kentucky [today]."
Just the same, it's hard to set aside this
weekend's jaw-dropping results. Florida's
second-round defeat marks the earliest exit
of a top seed since 1999, when the NCAA
expanded to a 64-team tournament. It's
hard to let go of the fact that Florida has
reached the semifinals in 16 of the last 17
tournaments and the fact that California has
made the round of 16 in 18 of the last 20
years.
Left holding the ball, Stanford is left
speculating about Kentucky's chances.

"We know that they're playing well be
cause they upset No. 5 Georgia a couple of
weeks ago at a Southeast Conference tour
nament, and they won their match, 4-0,
against No. 39 Ohio State," Forood said.
The Wildcats' top singles player. No.
16 Aibikia Kalsarieva (37-12), owns two
individual titles, the USTA National Ten
nis Center College Invite and the Ken
tucky Fall Classic. Kalsaviera was also a
finalist in two tournaments, including the
ITA Southeast Championships, where
she lost to Wake Forest's No. 29 Karin
Coetzee,6-1,6-3.
Kalsarieva made quick work of Ohio
State's Lindsay Williams, denying her all but
two games, 6-2,6-0. Competing in the Nos. 5
and 6 singles positions, teammates Kim
Coventry and Christine Simpson had similar
results.
Coventry finished off the Buckeye's
Lindsay Adams, 6-0, 6-2, while Simpson
swept Lindsay Bryan, 6-0,6-3.
Kentucky has made an NCAA appear
ance every year since 1986. Records dating

back to 1999 peg the Wildcats' farthest ad
vancement as their Round 16 showdown in
2002 with then-No. 3 Stanford, when they
lost, 5-1.
With a flawless season at its back, the
Cardinal hopes to repeat the results of
2002.
"From the standpoint of how we're play
ing, we're in as good of shape as we can be,"
Forood said. "It's a very tough tournament
and physically we're ready. It's a little bit of
a mental battle from here."
The Cardinal appeared in top form in
the first two rounds of NCAA action,
breezing by Quinnipiac in the first round
and barely struggling with Michigan in the
second.
No. 23 Erin Burdette, a junior, came out
firing in the No. 3 singles slot against the
Wolverines' Kavitha Tipirneni. Burdette
stumbled in later action, dropping the first
set, 6-3.
"I was playing kind of stubbornly and
going for the same shots I'd been missing
[every time]," Burdette said. "I just needed

to adjust a little bit, and I got going again in
the second set."
Burdette's match went unfinished as
Stanford's No. 6 singles player, senior
Emilia Anderson, clinched the match
for Stanford.
After a bout of frustration in doubles
competition, Anderson bounced back fora
6-3, 6-2 success in singles, proving that atti
tude can make or break a tennis match.
"After doubles was over, I saw it just as
one of those matches where [Anne Yelsey]
and I weren't playing that great," Anderson
said of their 7-4 deficit at No. 3 doubles. "I
felt like it wouldn't have done a lot of good
to dwell on it."
Stanford shut out Quinnipiac and Michi
gan, 4-0. However, the Cardinal can bank on
its past successes only as far as their present
practice and determination can take them.
"You never know what's gonna hap
pen at NCAAs, but you better bring
your 'A' game," Barnikow said.
Stanford faces Kentucky today at 3 p.m.
