# COW to improve phone reception
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
In response to complaints of poor reception on campus, AT&T
will be placing a second cell-on-wheels (COW) device on campus.
The COW, which is typically used to provide better service at
temporary events, will be placed near Escondido Village within
the next 30 days at the request of Information Technology Systems
and Services (ITSS).
"We're asking for something to improve the service," said
Nancy Ansaldo, an ITSS marketing and sales representative.
"There had been some complaints about not being able to get a
signal in certain areas."
The COW will improve coverage in buildings on campus as well
as other areas of heavy usage.
"The COW is meant to relieve congestion," Ansaldo said.
"They try to place the COW strategically to provide the maximum
capacity offload to adjacent cell sites that may be overloaded. A
secondary benefit is that customers would have better coverage
within the vicinity of the COW."
For at least the past four years. Stanford has used AT&T as its
primary service provider for students, faculty and staff, accord
ing to ITSS marketing and sales representative Carlos Zertuche.
The University's contract with the company was renewed last
year for only two years because of the fast pace at which technol
ogy is changing.
"We had multiple vendors out here five or six years ago," Zer
tuche said. "We tried a bunch of different ones — Pac Bell, Cin
gular, Verizon — we had all sorts of antennas out here. It was a
service and financial aspect that drove us to stay with AT&T for
two years and the fact that they were willing to
put COWs on campus to improve the cell
phone coverage."
I he first COW was placed on campus after
the last contract signing, Zertuche said.
AT&T runs monthly reports to determine the
peak hours of campus cell-phone usage and
where most calls are coming from. In re
sponse to complaints of poor service, the
company determined that Escondido Village
would be the most effective location to place

a second COW.
"The actual COW was devised to be used at
events like Pebble Beach — it's highly unusual
that they would use it here as a permanent fix
ture,' Ansaldo said. "Even at Pebble Beach
they'd only use one, and they're providing us
with two, so hopefully this will drastically im
prove service."
Such unusual accommodations have helped
AT&T maintain its relationship with Stanford,
officials said.
" The only option would be to put in an ugly
old tower — frankly that wasn't an option for
Stanford," Zertuche said. "AT&T's been pret
ty good with our quirky requests, as far as aes
thetics and stuff. But then again, they want the
business, right?"
