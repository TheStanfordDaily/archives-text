# Men will play Florida in Sweet 16
## 
### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The NCAA championships
are a Stanford tradition. The
University has produced great
prodigies such as John McEnroe,
Patrick McEnroe, Alex O'Brien,
Bob Bryan, Mike Bryan and
many more.
Now, once again, the time
for the NCAA Championships
is nearing, and so is the end of
Dick Gould's career as head
coach for the No. 9 Stanford
men's tennis team.
After 38 years of leading the
team to Pacific-10 and NCAA vic
tories, Gould will retire from his
coaching position and assume the
role of director of tennis at Stan
ford. The men's tennis team has
won 17 NCAA championships
under the guidance of Gould, but
one more win couldn't hurt.
Before the 2003-2004 season,
every Cardinal player coached by
Gould left the Farm with a champi
onship ring. Now, however, there is
still one senior who has not yet re
ceived a ring, and there is only one
chance left for the team to uphold
the Stanford tradition.
The Cardinal will go into the
NCAAs held in Tulsa, Okla.,
starting Saturday after battling
their way through the first and
second rounds last weekend. The
team feels lucky to have made it
this far, looking back at the
nerve-racking match against
Washington last Sunday.
"It's very nice to get out of
regionals, [and] I think NCAAs
will be fun," said sophomore
James Pade.
Added Gould: "I thought they
were one of the best teams in the
whole tournament and I thought
they really matched up for us. It
was one of our greatest comebacks,
and that should really help the guys
confidence-wise.
"We're not going to face any
teams a lot tougher than Washing
ton,"he continued. "It really made
the guys feel good with themselves

and hopefully we can take the mo
mentum with us against Florida."
Stanford, seeded No. 10 in the
tournament, will take on No. 7
Florida at noon on Saturday. The
two teams have not met since 2001,
Stanford holding a 2-1 all-time
record against the Gators.
"We're going in blind against
Florida, we don't know anything
about them," Gould said. "Obvi
ously they've had a really good sea
son and I know we're going to have
our work cut out with them and I
know we're going to give them a re
ally good battle. We're looking for
ward to the match."
Florida made its way into the
round of 16 by knocking No. 20
Arizona out the bracket in round
two. The Gators defeated the
Wildcats, 4-0, increasing their sea
son record to 18-7.
No. 12 junior All-American
Hamid Mirzadeh will lead the
Gators into the NCAA fray, boast
ing a 16-7 singles record. Mirzadeh,
combined with redshirt sopho
more Chris Brandi, look to be a se
rious threat as Flordia's No. 41
doubles team.
Also in the Florida lineup are
No. 76 Janne Holmia and No. 87
Vladimir Obradovic. both worthy
adversaries as singles players and
as a doubles team.
"We're looking forward to
playing Florida," Gould said. "I'm
not really afraid of anyone based
on this past weekend. The guys
have given me a lot of confidence
in them."
Standing in Florida's way will be
No. 8 junior Sam Warburg, No. 65
sophomore All-American K.C.
Corkery and No. 102 freshman
James Wan, Stanford's top ranked
players. Warburg was recently
named Pac-10 Player of the Year
after winning the Pac-10 singles
championship. Also poised to do
some damage are senior team cap
tain Carter Morris, sophomore
James Pade, and junior Phil Sheng.
"By far, we're in the best shape
we've been in all year," Gould said.
"I think we're really coming to

gether in that way. I'm really excit
ed it's going to be a great challenge
for us but I don't think there are a
lot teams better than Washington.

If we can carry that over I think we
could make a real big statement in
this tournament."
Should the Cardinal defeat the

Gators, they will move on to play
the winner of the No. 2 Southern
California vs. No. 27 Arkansas
match on Sunday.

doubles team.
Also in the Florida lineup are
No. 76 Janne Holmia and No. 87
Vladimir Obradovic. both worthy
adversaries as singles players and
as a doubles team.
"We're looking forward to
playing Florida," Gould said. "I'm
not really afraid of anyone based
on this past weekend. The guys
have given me a lot of confidence
in them."
Standing in Florida's way will be
No. 8 junior Sam Warburg, No. 65
sophomore All-American K.C.
Corkery and No. 102 freshman
James Wan, Stanford's top ranked
players. Warburg was recently
named Pac-10 Player of the Year
after winning the Pac-10 singles
championship. Also poised to do
some damage are senior team cap
tain Carter Morris, sophomore
James Pade, and junior Phil Sheng.
"By far, we're in the best shape
we've been in all year," Gould said.
"I think we're really coming to

gether in that way. I'm really excit
ed it's going to be a great challenge
for us but I don't think there are a
lot teams better than Washington.

If we can carry that over I think we
could make a real big statement in
this tournament."
Should the Cardinal defeat the

Gators, they will move on to play
the winner of the No. 2 Southern
California vs. No. 27 Arkansas
match on Sunday.

The men's lennis team is trying to win one more title for head coach Dick Gould, in his final season on the Farm.
The NCAA championships
are a Stanford tradition. The
University has produced great
prodigies such as John McEnroe,
Patrick McEnroe, Alex O'Brien,
Bob Bryan, Mike Bryan and
many more.
Now, once again, the time
for the NCAA Championships
is nearing, and so is the end of
Dick Gould's career as head
coach for the No. 9 Stanford
men's tennis team.
After 38 years of leading the
team to Pacific-10 and NCAA vic
tories, Gould will retire from his
coaching position and assume the
role of director of tennis at Stan
ford. The men's tennis team has
won 17 NCAA championships
under the guidance of Gould, but
one more win couldn't hurt.
Before the 2003-2004 season,
every Cardinal player coached by
Gould left the Farm with a champi
onship ring. Now, however, there is
still one senior who has not yet re
ceived a ring, and there is only one
chance left for the team to uphold
the Stanford tradition.
The Cardinal will go into the
NCAAs held in Tulsa, Okla.,
starting Saturday after battling
their way through the first and
second rounds last weekend. The
team feels lucky to have made it
this far, looking back at the
nerve-racking match against
Washington last Sunday.
"It's very nice to get out of
regionals, [and] I think NCAAs
will be fun," said sophomore
James Pade.
Added Gould: "I thought they
were one of the best teams in the
whole tournament and I thought
they really matched up for us. It
was one of our greatest comebacks,
and that should really help the guys
confidence-wise.
"We're not going to face any
teams a lot tougher than Washing
ton,"he continued. "It really made
the guys feel good with themselves

and hopefully we can take the mo
mentum with us against Florida."
Stanford, seeded No. 10 in the
tournament, will take on No. 7
Florida at noon on Saturday. The
two teams have not met since 2001,
Stanford holding a 2-1 all-time
record against the Gators.
"We're going in blind against
Florida, we don't know anything
about them," Gould said. "Obvi
ously they've had a really good sea
son and I know we're going to have
our work cut out with them and I
know we're going to give them a re
ally good battle. We're looking for
ward to the match."
Florida made its way into the
round of 16 by knocking No. 20
Arizona out the bracket in round
two. The Gators defeated the
Wildcats, 4-0, increasing their sea
son record to 18-7.
No. 12 junior All-American
Hamid Mirzadeh will lead the
Gators into the NCAA fray, boast
ing a 16-7 singles record. Mirzadeh,
combined with redshirt sopho
more Chris Brandi, look to be a se
rious threat as Flordia's No. 41
doubles team.
Also in the Florida lineup are
No. 76 Janne Holmia and No. 87
Vladimir Obradovic. both worthy
adversaries as singles players and
as a doubles team.
