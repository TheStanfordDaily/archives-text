# Runners shoot for Olympic standards
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's not easy being a collegiate ath
lete at Stanford. Besides facing one of
the toughest academic institutions in
the nation, Stanford athletes also
compete at the highest level, both in
the NCAA and even on an interna
tional level.
While most students will be pri
marily concerned with passing finals
and starting internships at the end of
this quarter, many of Stanford's stu
dent-athletes will be looking toward
something bigger than just their stud
ies: the Olympic Games.
"I'm taking a lighter load this quar
ter," said redshirt junior Don Sage,
who is one of the contenders to make
the U.S. team in the 1,500 meters. "I
tried to work my schedule around
training. It helps to get a good break
fast before class, get a nap during the
day and make sure that I don't miss
any morning runs."
In 2000, Stanford sent three track
stars to Sydney. Gabe Jennings and
Michael Stember finished first and
third in the 1,500 at the Olympic Trials
while Brad Hauser finished second in
the 5,000.
This year, the Stanford track and
field team has no fewer than six ath
letes with a legitimate chance of
qualifying for the Olympics in
Athens.
Once again, the storied men's dis
tance program leads the way. Senior
Grant Robison is currently the only
1,500-meter specialist in the U.S. with
the Olympic "A" standard at the dis
tance and is considered one of the fa
vorites heading into the Olympic Tri
als in July. He and Sage will attempt to
repeat the performance of Jennings
and Stember in 2000. .
"When you are around people who
are always racing at that standard, it
takes some of the fantasy out of quali
fying to the Olympics," Robison said.
"It's not daunting to set those types of
goals because people you're around
are doing it."
To qualify for the Olympics, ath
letes must hit a time standard and
finish as one of the top three with
the time standard at the Olympic
Trials. If only one athlete has the
standard, the trials champion will be

the U.S.'s sole representative.
While Sage does not have the stan
dard yet, the race at the trials may be
fast enough to pull the top runners
under the 1,500 time of 3 minutes,
36.20 seconds.
"You don't go into the Olympic
Trials looking for the standard," said
first-year distance coach Andy Ger
ard. "You race to put yourself in posi
tion to get those marks if it happens
and see where the chips fall after
that."
Senior Louis Luchini set the school
record in the 5,000 earlier this year
and is currently ranked No. 2 in the na
tion at the event with his 13:25.19, just
four seconds off the"A" standard,
which he could hit if he finishes in the
top three at the Trials.
The biggest question mark on the
team may be whether redshirt junior
lan Dobson and redshirt sophomore
Alicia Craig will hit the Olympic stan
dards in the men's and women's
10,000. Dobson ran a personal best
28:15.66, but fell short of the targeted
"A" standard of 27:49.
Craig ran a collegiate record
32:19.97 but missed the 31:45 Olympic
standard as well.
Both are still confident they can hit

those times, but the Olympic Trials
probably will not be won in a time
under the"A" standard.
"Most of the guys are going to try
and take it easy," Dobson said. "If I
had the 'A' standard, that's what I
would do."
"lan had great race and set a five
second personal best," Gerard said.
"We try to focus on it being a good
race first. His race might not hit the 'A'
standard, but if he runs another per
sonal best, that's a successful race.
"Our guys are very good racers and
will race well at the Trials. There is just
some chance and circumstance after
that."
Track and field athletes have an
additional challenge not experienced
by many athletes. There are two back
to-back track seasons — indoor and
outdoor — and cross country if you
are a distance runner.
"Probably the biggest challenge is

stretching an already long season out
another month," Robison said. "One
of the biggest things is just staying
sharp for that long."
Training for track and field is a
very precise art that involves base
training, strength training and final
ly tapering. Athletes run faster or
throw farther as they progress
through the stages. But if they taper
too quickly, their final races won't
be as strong as they could have
been.
"Everything's been pushed back
this year," Dobson said. "I don't think
we're as sharp as we could be going
into some of these races."
This could affect how well they
perform at the NCAA Champi
onships, but that doesn't worry senior
Jillian Camarena, one of the nation's
top shot-put throwers.
"Even for the Pacific-10 Confer
ence meet I didn't taper too much,"

Camarena said. "For the national
championships, I will probably
taper a little more. The focus is on
the Trials and being ready for them,
but I'm also excited about compet
ing for the team at regionals and na
tionals."
Added weights coach Robert
Weir: "No question the Olympic Tri
als are the goal, but Jill's preparation is
such that she will be ready for NCAA
season as well. She still has to hit the
"A" standard, and we will rest her a
little to try and hit that without jeopar
dizing her performance at the Trials."
Each of these athletes should chal
lenge for an NCAA title in their event
before moving on to the Olympic Tri
als in July, where years of hard work
balancing being a student and an ath
lete will hopefully allow them the op
portunity to represent the U.S. and
Stanford at the Olympic Games in
Athens.
