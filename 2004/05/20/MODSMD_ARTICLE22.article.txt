# Documentary showcases Iraqi perspective

"Americans need to rid them
selves of their liberation fantasies,"
Sinan Antoon said to an audience who
had gathered to see his new documen
tary film, "About Baghdad."
The Baghdad-born filmmaker re
marked that "a thirst for humanization
and a desire to hear what Iraqis think"
drove him and seven others to make
the film. He suggested that adding
more Iraqi voices to the debates was es
sential given his perception of the U.S.
news media's "simplification and trivi
alization" of the occupation in Iraq.
The film is a montage of interviews
with Iraqis of all backgrounds. A few
key points emerge repeatedly: while

most are relieved that Saddam Hus
sein is gone, they are also dismayed at
finding themselves re-colonized.
In addition to recording a diverse
number of Iraqi voices, the film also
bears witness to continued suffering in
Baghdad. Scenes in hospitals show
malnourished infants and doctors
without basic medicines. Scenes in uni
versities show decimated rows of li
brary shelves. The city's busiest street
is deserted by 4:30 in the afternoon.
Several American servicemen also
appear in the film. They portray them
selves as liberators — an image also
predominant in the U.S. media —
who are doing what the Iraqis cannot
do for themselves.
Antoon said he is intent on dis

pelling this myth of liberation, and of
fers several instances of resistance to
Hussein's regime.
Another common view ex
pressed by Iraqis interviewed in the
documentary is that 13 years of U.N.
sanctions had played a central role
in preparing the country for Iraq's
current state of lawlessness. Antoon
remarked that the sanctions
prompted the departure of much of
Iraq's middle class, a group Western
commentators believed would lead
in the reconstruction.
The documentary was made in July
2003 in war-torn Baghdad, less than
three months after the beginning of
the U.S.-led campaign in Iraq. Many of
those interviewed implored American

viewers to pressure the U.S. govern
ment to end the occupation. The Iraqis
in the film also expressed a strong de
sire for self-determination.
Many of the students and faculty in
attendance remained to discuss the
film with Antoon.
"I get the feeling that most Ameri
cans don't really know what the Iraqi
people feel," said Hana Rashid, a
graduate student in Computer Sci
ence. "The power of the film is to give
the Iraqi people a voice."
Antoon's visit concludes today
with a talk focused on the Iraqi prose
poem under the Baathist regime held
at 3 p.m. in room 200-034.
