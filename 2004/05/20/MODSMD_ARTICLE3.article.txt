# Sources say basketball coach Mike Montgomery set to accept new head coaching position with Golden State Warriors
## Calling it quits 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The bouncy floors are gone, the "star" is
most likely gone and now — now — the mas
termind behind it all is out, as well.
In an emotional meeting yesterday held
around 4 p.m., Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery announced to his players that he
had accepted a head coaching position with the
NBA's Golden State Warriors. The entire
Stanford coaching staff, all of the players (in
cluding outgoing seniors Justin Davis, Joe Kir
chofer and Matt Lottich) and University ath
letic director Ted Leland were present for the

emergency meeting, according to team manag
er Doug Carter.
"Yeah, he's gone," Carter stated matter-of
factly. "No one was expecting this. It was like
an atomic bomb dropping."
"Everyone was there. It was a pretty emo
tional meeting," Carter later added in a phone
interview with The Daily.
Montgomery, as well as the Athletic De
partment, could not be reached for comment,
although Stanford spokesman Gary Migdol
confirmed with the Associated Press that the
emergency meeting took place but didn't say
that Montgomery's departure was certain.
In the meeting, Montgomery emphasized

that "it has always been the players' program"
and that Cardinal's legacy would continue
even in his absence.
National rumors surfaced about Mont
gomery's departure late last evening when
ESPN reported that he was the leading candi
date to replace Golden State Warriors' head
coach Eric Musselman. Musselman was fired
yesterday by the Warriors, leaving with one
year remaining on his contract after two sea
sons with the franchise and a 75-89 record.
