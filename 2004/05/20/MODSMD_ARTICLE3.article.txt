# Sources say basketball coach Mike Montgomery set to accept new head coaching position with Golden State Warriors
## Calling it quits 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The bouncy floors are gone, the "star" is
most likely gone and now — now — the mas
termind behind it all is out, as well.
In an emotional meeting yesterday held
around 4 p.m., Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery announced to his players that he
had accepted a head coaching position with the
NBA's Golden State Warriors. The entire
Stanford coaching staff, all of the players (in
cluding outgoing seniors Justin Davis, Joe Kir
chofer and Matt Lottich) and University ath
letic director Ted Leland were present for the

emergency meeting, according to team manag
er Doug Carter.
"Yeah, he's gone," Carter stated matter-of
factly. "No one was expecting this. It was like
an atomic bomb dropping."
"Everyone was there. It was a pretty emo
tional meeting," Carter later added in a phone
interview with The Daily.
Montgomery, as well as the Athletic De
partment, could not be reached for comment,
although Stanford spokesman Gary Migdol
confirmed with the Associated Press that the
emergency meeting took place but didn't say
that Montgomery's departure was certain.
In the meeting, Montgomery emphasized

that "it has always been the players' program"
and that Cardinal's legacy would continue
even in his absence.
National rumors surfaced about Mont
gomery's departure late last evening when
ESPN reported that he was the leading candi
date to replace Golden State Warriors' head
coach Eric Musselman. Musselman was fired
yesterday by the Warriors, leaving with one
year remaining on his contract after two sea
sons with the franchise and a 75-89 record.

Stanford basketball head coach Mike Montgomery announced his decision to take a coaching job with the Golden State Warriors to his players at
4 p.m. yesterday afternoon.
Lifetime Achievement Award, is ex
pected to sign a four-year, multimil
lion-dollar contract with Golden
State, in a partnership that could be
announced as early as Friday, accord
ing to ESPN.
In the last 18seasons, Montgomery
has become the Stanford men's bas
ketball team's most notable figure, the
"mastermind" who led Stanford to a
record-setting 30-2 season this year,
including a 26-game winning streak
and a perfect home season. The Cardi
nal entered the NCAA Tournament
as a No. 1 seed before being upset by
Alabama in the second round. He has
a collegiate record of 547-244, includ
ing eight seasons as Montana's head
coach.
Montgomery's successor has not
yet been hired, although several
names have been thrown around —
including Nevada coach and former
Stanford assistant Trent Johnson, who
seems to be a likely candidate, along
with Gonzaga coach Mark Few.
Carter declined to comment about
who was on Stanford's list of possible
candidates.
Carter emphasized that, even
through the tears, "all the guys were
happy for" Montgomery.
"He has the opportunity to go to
the next level," Carter said. "We're
happy he's taking the chance. It's the
same with Josh [Childress] — we're
happy that he has the opportunity, but
we're sad to see him leave."
The ramifications of Mont
gomery's departure are, at this point,
difficult to assess.
Childress's early departure now
seems to be a foregone conclusion, al
though the junior swingman, who re
mains a likely lottery pick, was proba
bly out the door anyway.
The most immediate concern sur
rounds a batch of "three big recruits"
who will be visiting Stanford this
weekend. How they respond to the
uncertain coaching situation sur
rounding the Cardinal remains to be
seen.
Carter asserted that the assistant
coaches will remain in the meantime
to make sure that "the day-to-day stuff
stays on track," including recruiting
and individual player training.
