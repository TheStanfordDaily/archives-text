## 
### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cantor Center for the Visual Arts
opened its doors over 50 years ago; a
group of 600 guests recently commemo
rated this anniversary with a celebration
at the museum.
Speakers at the May 8 event in
cluded University President John
Hennessy, San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art Director Neal Benezra,
pop artist Wayne Thiebaud and Uni
versity Classics Prof. Michael
Shanks. Looking to the future of the
museum, Hennessy spoke about the
need fora new dedication to the arts
at Stanford.
The event included a "walk down
memory lane" display and a speech by
Drew Lanza, chair of the museum's
board of governors, that highlighted
milestones in the membership's past.
The museum was founded in 1891, but
it did not become functionally open until
1954, Lanza said.
Since this time, the Cantor Arts
Center Membership has helped sustain
the museum, especially after the Loma
Prieta earthquake of 1989 devastated
the museum and led to its nine-year

closing. During this period, a member
ship of approximately 1,200 continued
to support the museum in its efforts to
rebuild itself.
Anna Koster, the public relations
manager for the museum, said that its
5,000 members provide financial assis
tance for exhibitions and general operat
ing needs, and that they often donate their
time as well.
"Membership also provides some 400
volunteers that serve in a number of ca
pacities, including visitor services, the do
cent program and membership pro
grams," she said.
In addition to member donations, the
museum is also funded by private dona
tions, the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, Provost John Etchemendy, and
through earned income.
It is this financial support that allows
the museum to have free admission as
well as sponsor events such as "First
Thursdays" and "Party on the Edge",
which invite students to explore the mu
seum while enjoying music and food in a
social atmosphere.
"Cantor Arts Center staff really want
the museum to be welcoming to stu
dents," Koster said. "We want students
to feel that this is their museum."
