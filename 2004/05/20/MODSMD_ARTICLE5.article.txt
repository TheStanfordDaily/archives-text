Members of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
staff recently developed a proposal featuring a groundbreaking
computer approach to intensive scientific data analysis as part of a
competition held by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department
of Energy (DOE). Although SLAC did not win the award, the pos
itive feedback it received from the judges makes it optimistic about
the future development of its model.
"[The competition) sought proposals fora leadership-class com
puting system that would offer capabilities to perform previously
near-to-impossible computationally intensive science," said
Richard Mount, principal investigator of the SLAC proposal.
The competition announcement stated that up to $25 million
was available from the DOE Office of Science, the major federal
funding agency for the physical sciences and SLAC's main source
of financial support.
"Applicants were encouraged to submit proposals requesting
up to $25 million per year for up to five years, and the notice said
that only one award would be made," Mount said.
SLAC staffers said that they intentionally submitted a proposal
that was not entirely geared within the parameters of the competi
tion, since other developments are more important at this time.
"No one knows how to make such a massive memory computer
where the processors can all talk to all the memory," said SLAC
Prof. David Leith, who worked on the proposal. "That is why we
