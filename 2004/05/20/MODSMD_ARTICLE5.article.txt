# SLAC highlighted in Energy Dept. contest

Members of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
staff recently developed a proposal featuring a groundbreaking
computer approach to intensive scientific data analysis as part of a
competition held by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department
of Energy (DOE). Although SLAC did not win the award, the pos
itive feedback it received from the judges makes it optimistic about
the future development of its model.
"[The competition) sought proposals fora leadership-class com
puting system that would offer capabilities to perform previously
near-to-impossible computationally intensive science," said
Richard Mount, principal investigator of the SLAC proposal.
The competition announcement stated that up to $25 million
was available from the DOE Office of Science, the major federal
funding agency for the physical sciences and SLAC's main source
of financial support.
"Applicants were encouraged to submit proposals requesting
up to $25 million per year for up to five years, and the notice said
that only one award would be made," Mount said.
SLAC staffers said that they intentionally submitted a proposal
that was not entirely geared within the parameters of the competi
tion, since other developments are more important at this time.
"No one knows how to make such a massive memory computer
where the processors can all talk to all the memory," said SLAC
Prof. David Leith, who worked on the proposal. "That is why we
were non-responsive to the call for
proposals; there has to be a few years
of development to get through the
teething problems intrinsic to a new
way of doing business."
Indeed, because its proposal was
different from the competition's
focus, "we would have been very sur
prised if we had won," Mount said.
"Stanford / SLAC has great
strengths in computing, but we do
not specialize in running massive
compute-intensive supercomputer
services fora national user base. Our
proposal was fora different and com
plementary new type of supercom
puter focused on the data-intensive
scientific computing in which SLAC
can claim to be a world leader."
The technology proposed by
SLAC involves a computer with
thousands of processors and a vast
memory consisting of hundreds of
thousands of gigabytes. The memory
size is the key to a revolutionary
method of analyzing massive
amounts of scientific data.

SLAC representatives said they
have attained their primary goal of
receiving a strong recommendation
from the review panel, stating that
the new idea should be supported by
the Office of Science.
"On Tuesday evening we were as
sured that DOE will support the re
search and development request be
hind our proposal," Leith said. "Our
proposal was really a wake-up call to
recognize a new paradigm in com
puter architecture by the review
panel, and 1 think they did."
Mount said he is hopeful.
"We are encouraged by the re
sponse to our proposal and will make
every effort to secure the funding for
the development system," Mount
said. "This will help us make the case
for the major funding for the full sys
tem about two years from now."
Four of the 19 eligible DOE
funded laboratories competed; Oak
Ridge National Laboratory' in Ten
nessee won the award. The other
three groups were SLAC, the
Lawrence Berkeley National Labo
ratory and the Brookhaven National
Laboratory.
Based on the supportive reaction
it received during the competition,
SLAC officials said they were opti
mistic that the plans will be given the
opportunity to reach fruition.
