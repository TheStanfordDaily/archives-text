Global AIDS Campaign
promotes activism and
awareness on campus
By MICHELLE KELLER
DESK EDITOR
Spreading at an alarming pace, AIDS
has devastated nations in Sub-Saharan
Africa, taxed the health care systems of
many nations and completely changed
several demographic structures around
the globe, often leaving the very old caring
for the very young. Yet many see AIDS
solely as a problem of "other people," of
the developing world or of the poor. This
week, a coalition of Stanford students —
the Stanford Student Global AIDS Cam
paign — is hoping to change the Stanford
community's impressions of AIDS and
AIDS victims this year through a public
awareness campaign.
"The mission of our group is to increase
awareness about
the injustices that
take place around
the world: the high
cost and lack of ac
cessibility to medi
cation, the AIDS
stigma that persists
everywhere and fo
cusing on the fact
that AIDS is not
just a problem in
Africa," said junior
Archana Pasupuleti, one of the Campaign
members. "Many people focus on [Africa]
but the reality is that AIDS is a major
problem in Latin America, India, China,
Eastern Europe — all over the world. We
want people to be aware that it is a prob
lem in the United States as well."
The week's events include a panel
discussion held yesterday evening, enti
tled "The Global AIDS Crisis: The Role
of the U.S. and the International Com
munity. The panel featured two promi
nent AIDS policy and health experts.
Dr. Sara Seims, director of Population
Program at the Hewlett Foundation,
and Stephen F. Morin, professor of
Medicine and Director of the AIDS Pol
icy Research Center at the UC-San
Francisco AIDS Research Institute.
In her portion of the presentation,
Seims focused on the lack of coordination
between family planning organizations
and HIV/AIDS prevention organiza
tions due to limitations on the ways that
funds could be used. Combining the ef
forts of these two types of organizations,
she explained, could lead to more effective
use of funds. Morin discussed U.S. funding
policies for AIDS efforts and noted that
while a significant amount of money was
spent on AIDS prevention, it was nearly
nothing compared to military spending or
the reconstruction of Iraq.
The panel discussion was followed by a
9 p.m. screening of the documentary "A
Closer Walk," as well as the film "A Los
Altos Story." Following the films, stu
dents, staff and faculty members listened
to guest speaker B.J. Stiles, former presi
dent and CEO of the National Leadership
Coalition on AIDS.
Today, the Campaign will try to engage
busy students and faculty members with a
table set up in White Plaza, a spoken word
presentation and a display of the AIDS
Memorial Quilt.
"I think the AIDS quilt makes an sig-

nificant impact on people," Pasupuleti
said. "It is so easy to dismiss this as an epi
demic that happens to 'other people,' but
when you see each of the individual
squares sewn by the family members that
suffered from the death of a close one, you
see the devastation that AIDS has brought
about right in front of you."
The Campaign will also sell raffle tick
ets at the White Plaza table. Tickets will be
sold for $1 and prizes will include gift cer
tificates to places such as Jamba Juice and
local restaurants. The funds raised from
the event will go toward the purchase and
distribution of Nevirapine through a non
governmental organization.
"I would like people to realize that this
is not a hopeless situation and that even
small actions that we take can make a dif-
ference," said
sophomore
Colleen Staatz,
who runs the
Campaign's
weekly meet
ings. "For ex
ample, $4 buys
a dose of Nevi
rapine, which
cuts the risk of
moth e r -1 o -
child HIV
transmission by 50 percent, yet many
women never receive this treatment. So
the money that we're raising this week will
have a huge impact when you look at it
that way."
The group has held fundraisers such as
the Student Global AIDS Walk and pizza
eating contests in the past but has chosen
to focus on AIDS education and activism
this year.
"In the long term, I think students can
make a difference in changing U.S. policy
through activism, which our group is hop
ing to focus on more in the future," Staatz
said. "I think that changing people's mind
sets is the most important thing, in terms of
getting them to realize that there actually
is treatment available, but for the most
part it isn't reaching the 95 percent of
HIV-positive people who live in develop
ing countries."
Staatz got involved with the group as a
freshman when she attended an informa
tional meeting and learned about the dev
astating spread of AIDS around the globe.
"Maybe I was naive, but I had no idea
about the extent of the pandemic, and it
completely shocked me," she said. "In
countries like Botswana, 40 percent of
the population is infected — the closest
thing I can compare this to is the Black
Plague in Europe."
Pasupuleti, a human biology major,
became involved in the group after tak
ing a sophomore seminar on AIDS. She
subsequently spent the summer in India
working at an HIV/AIDS clinic,
where she taught workshops on sexual
health, performed clinical work and
counseled patients.
"One of the things I've learned through
my experiences is that medicine can only
take you so far," Pasupuleti said. "You
have to go work at the community level.
And hopefully one day we'll get to the
point where we don't need to diagnose
people with HIV / AIDS anymore."

Beth is a 25-year old customer
service supervisor from Milton,
Wash., a mother and a wife. All
her life she's felt self-conscious,
nursing her low self-esteem. Cue
Fox's new 'reality' show, "The
Swan," and a pack of ruthless
television executives willing to
pay for Beth to reshape her face
and body. Over the duration of
the show, she underwent a brow
lift, nose job, lip enhancement,
chin liposuction, breast augmen
tation, a tummy tuck, calf and
ankle liposuction and dental
surgery.
But it didn't stop there. After
an extended hospital stay and
complaints of excruciating pain,
Beth was put on 1,2(M)-calorie
diet and required to attend be
havior-coaching sessions. The
ciiflhanger: Would Beth stay
with her cheating husband after
her transformation? Sounds al
most as good as "The Appren
tice," right?
Who cares that Beth is only
one of 16 women so miserably
unhappy with their bodies that
they felt the need to overhaul
themselves simply to be accepted
by society.
Many are outraged by the
show, including several Stanford
students — eating disorder
awareness interns at Vaden —
who took to the streets of San
Francisco and White Plaza urg
ing people to write letters
protesting the show and its dam
aging messages. The group asked
passersby to complete the sen
tence: "I don't need a makeover
because..." and to send the re
sponse to Fox. Responses ranged
from "because I earned my beer
belly" to "because I like that I
look like my mom."
Last night, the same band of
interns sponsored a talk by Mar
cclla Kaimondo from About
Face, a nonprofit organization
aimed at exposing the media's in
fluence on negative body image
and eating disorders.
Flanked by posters reading
"Fmaciation Stinks: Stop Starva
tion Imagery" across images of a
sickly Kate Moss, Kaimondo
spoke about the manipulative
strategies used by marketing ex
ecutives to appeal to both men
and women of all ages — strate
gies that have girls as young as
eight aspiring to unrealistic and
unhealthy standards.
A former anorexic, Kaimon
do listed qualities of women seen
on the pages of popular beauty
magazines. Essentially, if aliens
had to guess what the average
human woman looked like based
on Cosmopolitan and Vogue
magazines, they might assume we
are all tall, blond, blue-eyed,
thin, large-chested — indeed, we
have no pores. Oh yeah, and ap
parently we're all half-naked too
— all the time. And this is just
skimming the surface.
If you take a closer look at ads
today, there are many uncon
scious messages that extend far
beyond appearance. Pre-teens
are dressed to look like vamps.
(>rown women arc outfitted as
schoolgirls complete with pigtails
and lolly-pops. Models sit
through three-hour makeup ap-.
plications only to look like
they've been crying or have two
black eyes. Others pose in sub
servient or defensive positions,
many with their legs spread open.
One ad for Fetish perfume
showed a sultry pubescent girl in
a bikini, the text across her chest
reading: "Fetish rule #16: Apply
generously so he can smell the
scent when you shake your head
no." The ad was pulled last year
when parents began to protest,
but what about all the images of
women ticd-up, trapped in cages
and alcohol bottles?
Kaimondo gave the straight
facts on a typical cover of Cos
mopolitan, a picture of a typical
"beautiful" woman in a smashing
green dress, explosive blond hair,
generous cleavage. The model
was 5-feet-11-inches tall, 120
pounds. It took a total of six
hours to do her hair and makeup.
Not only had the model had her
breasts "done," but also had two

ribs removed to shrink her torso.
Even after all this, the magic of
Photoshop allowed designers to
shave inches off her hips, stretch
out her arms and add wrinkles to
the dress so it looked looser. All
told, the typical fashion cover
costs between the actual
photo shoot and touch-ups.
Even though the demograph
ics for these types of magazines
are reported to be women in their
20s and 30s, just as many elemen
tary school girls absorb the im
ages. And voila, a new market is
born complete with thongs for
10-year-olds on the shelves of
Abercroinhie & Fitch.
According to Kainiondo, kids
are socialized early to feed into
traditional marketing tools of
fear and competition.
"I want students to look at the
media critically and understand
they are being manipulated,"
said Kate Bedford, the peer
health coordinator at Vaden.
"Presentations like this raise
awareness about the role of the
Seven million women
and one million men are
diagnosed with eating
disorders every year,
and 50,00(1 people die
annually from diag
nosed disorders. Not to
mention the eases that
go undiagnosed. In ad
dition, 91 pereent of col
lege women have tried
radical dieting at some
point during their lives.
The Stanford bubble is
no exception, Bedford says.
Many students of both genders
have come to Vaden seeking
help for their own eating disor
ders and body image issues, or
those of their friends.
"When we get bombarded
with images in the media, its
hard to find out for ourselves
what we want to be," said ju
nior Kat Alquero, one of the
event's coordinators and peer
health intern at Vaden. "One
thing I found empowering is to
put my money where my mouth
is and just not buy things from
people who make me feel bad
about my body."
About Face is currently work
ing to educate students of all ages
about the dangers of unrealistic
images and the importance of
loving the skin they're in. For

"These days, being happy
with your body is an act of rebel

Sex, love and rock n' roll
Government should grant same-sex couples the right to get married
By VINNI INTERSIMONE
SEX COLUMNIST
Pat and Kevin have been together for 30
years. They have two children, a cat, a dog
and a mortgage. Like the heads of any
other family, Pat and Kevin have to provide
for and protect their family. Unlike other
families, however, they have no rights to
over 1,000 federal marriage protections.
Their family does not have the same fiscal
protections gained through special marital
rights in social security, employment bene
fits, tax breaks and death protections. If ei
ther one of them were to be hurt in an acci
dent, his spouse would have no right to visit
the other in a hospital and no right to advise
doctors on how to treat him. If either were
from another country, the other would not
be able to apply for the legal right to live in
the United States. Why? Because our gov
ernment will not allow Pat and Kevin to get
married.
Families of same-sex partners have just as
much of a right to the benefits and protec
tions that come with marriage as families of
opposite-sex partners. The Fourteenth
Amendment requires the government to
give the same rights to every citizen, forming
the foundation of the equal rights amend
ments that abolished slavery, granted voting
rights to all citizens and led to the Civil
Rights Movement that ended segregation.
Marriage is a right granted by the govern
ment, and under the Fourteenth Amend
ment. it must be granted to all citizens, not
just heterosexuals.
Many describe marriage as a "privi
lege" and not a "right," a fundamental fal
lacy. People holding this view believe that
just because marriage has requirements, it
is a privilege, ignoring the fact that many
rights have requirements and restrictions.
A citizen must be at least 18 years old to
vote, and, in many counties, must be a reg
istered voter. Do these requirements
make voting a privilege and not a right?
The requirements of marriage state that
one must be single, of age and not related
to their intended spouse, but how do these
requirements transform marriage from a
right to a privilege?
Many critics of gay marriage point to polls
showing the majority of Americans are
against same-sex marriages, yet the Consti
tution— and the Fourteenth Amendment's
guarantee to equal rights — was written to
protect the rights of the minorities when the
majority was not acting in a just manner. The
American government has no authority to
deny same-sex couples the right to marriage
they deserve and the benefits of marriage
they need to raise a healthy family simply be
cause the majority of Americans surveyed
do not agree with gay lifestyle. The Constitu
tion is based on fundamental human rights,
not popularity polls.
In recognition of these ideals, on Mon
day, the state of Massachusetts wed same
sex couples, marking the first gay marriages
fully recognized by a state government. If
we glance back at Fat and Kevin, however, if
these two get married in Massachusetts,
their marriage will not be recognized by the
two dozen states that have passed or are at
tempting to pass amendments to their state
constitutions banning gay marriage. Even if
they live in Massachusetts, they are still like
ly to be denied the 1,049 federal rights and
benefits given to opposite-sex couple be
cause the federal Defense of Marriage Act
defines marriage as a union between a man
and a woman.
The victories for equality in Mas
sachusetts should be celebrated, but full
equality has not been achieved. While Pat
and Kevin may be able to get "officially"
married in Massachusetts, their marriage is
Still a second-class marriage, and their rights
as American citizens and as an American
family remain unequal. For same-sex cou
ples to achieve full equality, both the federal
government and state governments must
recognize their right to marry.

Global AIDS Campaign
promotes activism and
awareness on campus
By MICHELLE KELLER
DESK EDITOR
Spreading at an alarming pace, AIDS
has devastated nations in Sub-Saharan
Africa, taxed the health care systems of
many nations and completely changed
several demographic structures around
the globe, often leaving the very old caring
for the very young. Yet many see AIDS
solely as a problem of "other people," of
the developing world or of the poor. This
week, a coalition of Stanford students —
the Stanford Student Global AIDS Cam
paign — is hoping to change the Stanford
community's impressions of AIDS and
AIDS victims this year through a public
awareness campaign.
"The mission of our group is to increase
awareness about
the injustices that
take place around
the world: the high
cost and lack of ac
cessibility to medi
cation, the AIDS
stigma that persists
everywhere and fo
cusing on the fact
that AIDS is not
just a problem in
Africa," said junior
Archana Pasupuleti, one of the Campaign
members. "Many people focus on [Africa]
but the reality is that AIDS is a major
problem in Latin America, India, China,
Eastern Europe — all over the world. We
want people to be aware that it is a prob
lem in the United States as well."
The week's events include a panel
discussion held yesterday evening, enti
tled "The Global AIDS Crisis: The Role
of the U.S. and the International Com
munity. The panel featured two promi
nent AIDS policy and health experts.
Dr. Sara Seims, director of Population
Program at the Hewlett Foundation,
and Stephen F. Morin, professor of
Medicine and Director of the AIDS Pol
icy Research Center at the UC-San
Francisco AIDS Research Institute.
In her portion of the presentation,
Seims focused on the lack of coordination
between family planning organizations
and HIV/AIDS prevention organiza
tions due to limitations on the ways that
funds could be used. Combining the ef
forts of these two types of organizations,
she explained, could lead to more effective
use of funds. Morin discussed U.S. funding
policies for AIDS efforts and noted that
while a significant amount of money was
spent on AIDS prevention, it was nearly
nothing compared to military spending or
the reconstruction of Iraq.
The panel discussion was followed by a
9 p.m. screening of the documentary "A
Closer Walk," as well as the film "A Los
Altos Story." Following the films, stu
dents, staff and faculty members listened
to guest speaker B.J. Stiles, former presi
dent and CEO of the National Leadership
Coalition on AIDS.
Today, the Campaign will try to engage
busy students and faculty members with a
table set up in White Plaza, a spoken word
presentation and a display of the AIDS
Memorial Quilt.
"I think the AIDS quilt makes an sig-

but the reality is that AIDS is a

— all over the world."

nificant impact on people," Pasupuleti
said. "It is so easy to dismiss this as an epi
demic that happens to 'other people,' but
when you see each of the individual
squares sewn by the family members that
suffered from the death of a close one, you
see the devastation that AIDS has brought
about right in front of you."
The Campaign will also sell raffle tick
ets at the White Plaza table. Tickets will be
sold for $1 and prizes will include gift cer
tificates to places such as Jamba Juice and
local restaurants. The funds raised from
the event will go toward the purchase and
distribution of Nevirapine through a non
governmental organization.
"I would like people to realize that this
is not a hopeless situation and that even
small actions that we take can make a dif-
ference," said
sophomore
Colleen Staatz,
who runs the
Campaign's
weekly meet
ings. "For ex
ample, $4 buys
a dose of Nevi
rapine, which
cuts the risk of
moth e r -1 o -
child HIV
transmission by 50 percent, yet many
women never receive this treatment. So
the money that we're raising this week will
have a huge impact when you look at it
that way."
The group has held fundraisers such as
the Student Global AIDS Walk and pizza
eating contests in the past but has chosen
to focus on AIDS education and activism
this year.
"In the long term, I think students can
make a difference in changing U.S. policy
through activism, which our group is hop
ing to focus on more in the future," Staatz
said. "I think that changing people's mind
sets is the most important thing, in terms of
getting them to realize that there actually
is treatment available, but for the most
part it isn't reaching the 95 percent of
HIV-positive people who live in develop
ing countries."
Staatz got involved with the group as a
freshman when she attended an informa
tional meeting and learned about the dev
astating spread of AIDS around the globe.
"Maybe I was naive, but I had no idea
about the extent of the pandemic, and it
completely shocked me," she said. "In
countries like Botswana, 40 percent of
the population is infected — the closest
thing I can compare this to is the Black
Plague in Europe."
Pasupuleti, a human biology major,
became involved in the group after tak
ing a sophomore seminar on AIDS. She
subsequently spent the summer in India
working at an HIV/AIDS clinic,
where she taught workshops on sexual
health, performed clinical work and
counseled patients.
"One of the things I've learned through
my experiences is that medicine can only
take you so far," Pasupuleti said. "You
have to go work at the community level.
And hopefully one day we'll get to the
point where we don't need to diagnose
people with HIV / AIDS anymore."

Beth is a 25-year old customer
service supervisor from Milton,
Wash., a mother and a wife. All
her life she's felt self-conscious,
nursing her low self-esteem. Cue
Fox's new 'reality' show, "The
Swan," and a pack of ruthless
television executives willing to
pay for Beth to reshape her face
and body. Over the duration of
the show, she underwent a brow
lift, nose job, lip enhancement,
chin liposuction, breast augmen
tation, a tummy tuck, calf and
ankle liposuction and dental
surgery.
But it didn't stop there. After
an extended hospital stay and
complaints of excruciating pain,
Beth was put on 1,2(M)-calorie
diet and required to attend be
havior-coaching sessions. The
ciiflhanger: Would Beth stay
with her cheating husband after
her transformation? Sounds al
most as good as "The Appren
tice," right?
Who cares that Beth is only
one of 16 women so miserably
unhappy with their bodies that
they felt the need to overhaul
themselves simply to be accepted
by society.
Many are outraged by the
show, including several Stanford
students — eating disorder
awareness interns at Vaden —
who took to the streets of San
Francisco and White Plaza urg
ing people to write letters
protesting the show and its dam
aging messages. The group asked
passersby to complete the sen
tence: "I don't need a makeover
because..." and to send the re
sponse to Fox. Responses ranged
from "because I earned my beer
belly" to "because I like that I
look like my mom."
Last night, the same band of
interns sponsored a talk by Mar
cclla Kaimondo from About
Face, a nonprofit organization
aimed at exposing the media's in
fluence on negative body image
and eating disorders.
Flanked by posters reading
"Fmaciation Stinks: Stop Starva
tion Imagery" across images of a
sickly Kate Moss, Kaimondo
spoke about the manipulative
strategies used by marketing ex
ecutives to appeal to both men
and women of all ages — strate
gies that have girls as young as
eight aspiring to unrealistic and
unhealthy standards.
A former anorexic, Kaimon
do listed qualities of women seen
on the pages of popular beauty
magazines. Essentially, if aliens
had to guess what the average
human woman looked like based
on Cosmopolitan and Vogue
magazines, they might assume we
are all tall, blond, blue-eyed,
thin, large-chested — indeed, we
have no pores. Oh yeah, and ap
parently we're all half-naked too
— all the time. And this is just
skimming the surface.
If you take a closer look at ads
today, there are many uncon
scious messages that extend far
beyond appearance. Pre-teens
are dressed to look like vamps.
(>rown women arc outfitted as
schoolgirls complete with pigtails
and lolly-pops. Models sit
through three-hour makeup ap-.
plications only to look like
they've been crying or have two
black eyes. Others pose in sub
servient or defensive positions,
many with their legs spread open.
One ad for Fetish perfume
showed a sultry pubescent girl in
a bikini, the text across her chest
reading: "Fetish rule #16: Apply
generously so he can smell the
scent when you shake your head
no." The ad was pulled last year
when parents began to protest,
but what about all the images of
women ticd-up, trapped in cages
and alcohol bottles?
Kaimondo gave the straight
facts on a typical cover of Cos
mopolitan, a picture of a typical
"beautiful" woman in a smashing
green dress, explosive blond hair,
generous cleavage. The model
was 5-feet-11-inches tall, 120
pounds. It took a total of six
hours to do her hair and makeup.
Not only had the model had her
breasts "done," but also had two

Even after all this, the magic of
Photoshop allowed designers to
shave inches off her hips, stretch
out her arms and add wrinkles to
the dress so it looked looser. All

photo shoot and touch-ups.
Even though the demograph

are reported to be women in their
20s and 30s, just as many elemen

born complete with thongs for
10-year-olds on the shelves of
Abercroinhie & Fitch.
According to Kainiondo, kids
are socialized early to feed into
traditional marketing tools of
fear and competition.
"I want students to look at the
media critically and understand
they are being manipulated,"
said Kate Bedford, the peer
health coordinator at Vaden.

point during their lives.
The Stanford bubble is
no exception, Bedford says.
Many students of both genders
have come to Vaden seeking
help for their own eating disor
ders and body image issues, or
those of their friends.
"When we get bombarded
with images in the media, its
hard to find out for ourselves
what we want to be," said ju

about the dangers of unrealistic
images and the importance of

Sex, love and rock n' roll
Government should grant same-sex couples the right to get married
By VINNI INTERSIMONE
SEX COLUMNIST
Pat and Kevin have been together for 30
years. They have two children, a cat, a dog
and a mortgage. Like the heads of any
other family, Pat and Kevin have to provide
for and protect their family. Unlike other
families, however, they have no rights to
over 1,000 federal marriage protections.
Their family does not have the same fiscal
protections gained through special marital
rights in social security, employment bene
fits, tax breaks and death protections. If ei
ther one of them were to be hurt in an acci
dent, his spouse would have no right to visit
the other in a hospital and no right to advise
doctors on how to treat him. If either were
from another country, the other would not
be able to apply for the legal right to live in
the United States. Why? Because our gov
ernment will not allow Pat and Kevin to get
married.
Families of same-sex partners have just as
much of a right to the benefits and protec
tions that come with marriage as families of
opposite-sex partners. The Fourteenth
Amendment requires the government to
give the same rights to every citizen, forming
the foundation of the equal rights amend
ments that abolished slavery, granted voting
rights to all citizens and led to the Civil
Rights Movement that ended segregation.
Marriage is a right granted by the govern
ment, and under the Fourteenth Amend
ment. it must be granted to all citizens, not
just heterosexuals.
Many describe marriage as a "privi
lege" and not a "right," a fundamental fal
lacy. People holding this view believe that
just because marriage has requirements, it
is a privilege, ignoring the fact that many
rights have requirements and restrictions.
A citizen must be at least 18 years old to
vote, and, in many counties, must be a reg
istered voter. Do these requirements
make voting a privilege and not a right?
The requirements of marriage state that
one must be single, of age and not related
to their intended spouse, but how do these
requirements transform marriage from a
right to a privilege?
Many critics of gay marriage point to polls
showing the majority of Americans are
against same-sex marriages, yet the Consti
tution— and the Fourteenth Amendment's
guarantee to equal rights — was written to
protect the rights of the minorities when the
majority was not acting in a just manner. The
American government has no authority to
deny same-sex couples the right to marriage
they deserve and the benefits of marriage
they need to raise a healthy family simply be
cause the majority of Americans surveyed
do not agree with gay lifestyle. The Constitu
tion is based on fundamental human rights,
not popularity polls.
In recognition of these ideals, on Mon
day, the state of Massachusetts wed same
sex couples, marking the first gay marriages
fully recognized by a state government. If
we glance back at Fat and Kevin, however, if
these two get married in Massachusetts,
their marriage will not be recognized by the
two dozen states that have passed or are at
tempting to pass amendments to their state
constitutions banning gay marriage. Even if
they live in Massachusetts, they are still like
ly to be denied the 1,049 federal rights and
benefits given to opposite-sex couple be

The victories for equality in Mas
sachusetts should be celebrated, but full

Still a second-class marriage, and their rights
as American citizens and as an American
family remain unequal. For same-sex cou
ples to achieve full equality, both the federal
government and state governments must
recognize their right to marry.

Many describe marriage as a "privi
lege" and not a "right," a fundamental fal
lacy. People holding this view believe that
just because marriage has requirements, it
is a privilege, ignoring the fact that many
rights have requirements and restrictions.
A citizen must be at least 18 years old to
vote, and, in many counties, must be a reg
istered voter. Do these requirements
make voting a privilege and not a right?
The requirements of marriage state that
one must be single, of age and not related
to their intended spouse, but how do these
requirements transform marriage from a
right to a privilege?
Many critics of gay marriage point to polls
showing the majority of Americans are
against same-sex marriages, yet the Consti
tution— and the Fourteenth Amendment's
guarantee to equal rights — was written to
protect the rights of the minorities when the
majority was not acting in a just manner. The
American government has no authority to
deny same-sex couples the right to marriage
they deserve and the benefits of marriage
they need to raise a healthy family simply be
cause the majority of Americans surveyed
do not agree with gay lifestyle. The Constitu
tion is based on fundamental human rights,
not popularity polls.
In recognition of these ideals, on Mon
day, the state of Massachusetts wed same
sex couples, marking the first gay marriages
fully recognized by a state government. If
we glance back at Fat and Kevin, however, if
these two get married in Massachusetts,
their marriage will not be recognized by the
two dozen states that have passed or are at
tempting to pass amendments to their state
constitutions banning gay marriage. Even if
they live in Massachusetts, they are still like
ly to be denied the 1,049 federal rights and
benefits given to opposite-sex couple be
cause the federal Defense of Marriage Act
defines marriage as a union between a man
and a woman.
The victories for equality in Mas
sachusetts should be celebrated, but full
equality has not been achieved. While Pat
and Kevin may be able to get "officially"
married in Massachusetts, their marriage is
Still a second-class marriage, and their rights
as American citizens and as an American
family remain unequal. For same-sex cou
ples to achieve full equality, both the federal
government and state governments must
recognize their right to marry.

Global AIDS Campaign
promotes activism and
awareness on campus
By MICHELLE KELLER
DESK EDITOR
Spreading at an alarming pace, AIDS
has devastated nations in Sub-Saharan
Africa, taxed the health care systems of
many nations and completely changed
several demographic structures around
the globe, often leaving the very old caring
for the very young. Yet many see AIDS
solely as a problem of "other people," of
the developing world or of the poor. This
week, a coalition of Stanford students —
the Stanford Student Global AIDS Cam
paign — is hoping to change the Stanford
community's impressions of AIDS and
AIDS victims this year through a public
awareness campaign.
"The mission of our group is to increase
awareness about
the injustices that
take place around
the world: the high
cost and lack of ac
cessibility to medi
cation, the AIDS
stigma that persists
everywhere and fo
cusing on the fact
that AIDS is not
just a problem in
Africa," said junior
Archana Pasupuleti, one of the Campaign
members. "Many people focus on [Africa]
but the reality is that AIDS is a major
problem in Latin America, India, China,
Eastern Europe — all over the world. We
want people to be aware that it is a prob
lem in the United States as well."
The week's events include a panel
discussion held yesterday evening, enti
tled "The Global AIDS Crisis: The Role
of the U.S. and the International Com
munity. The panel featured two promi
nent AIDS policy and health experts.
Dr. Sara Seims, director of Population
Program at the Hewlett Foundation,
and Stephen F. Morin, professor of
Medicine and Director of the AIDS Pol
icy Research Center at the UC-San
Francisco AIDS Research Institute.
In her portion of the presentation,
Seims focused on the lack of coordination
between family planning organizations
and HIV/AIDS prevention organiza
tions due to limitations on the ways that
funds could be used. Combining the ef
forts of these two types of organizations,
she explained, could lead to more effective
use of funds. Morin discussed U.S. funding
policies for AIDS efforts and noted that
while a significant amount of money was
spent on AIDS prevention, it was nearly
nothing compared to military spending or
the reconstruction of Iraq.
The panel discussion was followed by a
9 p.m. screening of the documentary "A
Closer Walk," as well as the film "A Los
Altos Story." Following the films, stu
dents, staff and faculty members listened
to guest speaker B.J. Stiles, former presi
dent and CEO of the National Leadership
Coalition on AIDS.
Today, the Campaign will try to engage
busy students and faculty members with a
table set up in White Plaza, a spoken word
presentation and a display of the AIDS
Memorial Quilt.
"I think the AIDS quilt makes an sig-

but the reality is that AIDS is a

— all over the world."

nificant impact on people," Pasupuleti
said. "It is so easy to dismiss this as an epi
demic that happens to 'other people,' but
when you see each of the individual
squares sewn by the family members that
suffered from the death of a close one, you
see the devastation that AIDS has brought
about right in front of you."
The Campaign will also sell raffle tick
ets at the White Plaza table. Tickets will be
sold for $1 and prizes will include gift cer
tificates to places such as Jamba Juice and
local restaurants. The funds raised from
the event will go toward the purchase and
distribution of Nevirapine through a non
governmental organization.
"I would like people to realize that this
is not a hopeless situation and that even
small actions that we take can make a dif-
ference," said
sophomore
Colleen Staatz,
who runs the
Campaign's
weekly meet
ings. "For ex
ample, $4 buys
a dose of Nevi
rapine, which
cuts the risk of
moth e r -1 o -
child HIV
transmission by 50 percent, yet many
women never receive this treatment. So
the money that we're raising this week will
have a huge impact when you look at it
that way."
The group has held fundraisers such as
the Student Global AIDS Walk and pizza
eating contests in the past but has chosen
to focus on AIDS education and activism
this year.
"In the long term, I think students can
make a difference in changing U.S. policy
through activism, which our group is hop
ing to focus on more in the future," Staatz
said. "I think that changing people's mind
sets is the most important thing, in terms of
getting them to realize that there actually
is treatment available, but for the most
part it isn't reaching the 95 percent of
HIV-positive people who live in develop
ing countries."
Staatz got involved with the group as a
freshman when she attended an informa
tional meeting and learned about the dev
astating spread of AIDS around the globe.
"Maybe I was naive, but I had no idea
about the extent of the pandemic, and it
completely shocked me," she said. "In
countries like Botswana, 40 percent of
the population is infected — the closest
thing I can compare this to is the Black
Plague in Europe."
Pasupuleti, a human biology major,
became involved in the group after tak
ing a sophomore seminar on AIDS. She
subsequently spent the summer in India
working at an HIV/AIDS clinic,
where she taught workshops on sexual
health, performed clinical work and
counseled patients.
"One of the things I've learned through
my experiences is that medicine can only
take you so far," Pasupuleti said. "You
have to go work at the community level.
And hopefully one day we'll get to the
point where we don't need to diagnose
people with HIV / AIDS anymore."

Beth is a 25-year old customer
service supervisor from Milton,
Wash., a mother and a wife. All
her life she's felt self-conscious,
nursing her low self-esteem. Cue
Fox's new 'reality' show, "The
Swan," and a pack of ruthless
television executives willing to
pay for Beth to reshape her face
and body. Over the duration of
the show, she underwent a brow
lift, nose job, lip enhancement,
chin liposuction, breast augmen
tation, a tummy tuck, calf and
ankle liposuction and dental
surgery.
But it didn't stop there. After
an extended hospital stay and
complaints of excruciating pain,
Beth was put on 1,2(M)-calorie
diet and required to attend be
havior-coaching sessions. The
ciiflhanger: Would Beth stay
with her cheating husband after
her transformation? Sounds al
most as good as "The Appren
tice," right?
Who cares that Beth is only
one of 16 women so miserably
unhappy with their bodies that
they felt the need to overhaul
themselves simply to be accepted
by society.
Many are outraged by the
show, including several Stanford
students — eating disorder
awareness interns at Vaden —
who took to the streets of San
Francisco and White Plaza urg
ing people to write letters
protesting the show and its dam
aging messages. The group asked
passersby to complete the sen
tence: "I don't need a makeover
because..." and to send the re
sponse to Fox. Responses ranged
from "because I earned my beer
belly" to "because I like that I
look like my mom."
Last night, the same band of
interns sponsored a talk by Mar
cclla Kaimondo from About
Face, a nonprofit organization
aimed at exposing the media's in
fluence on negative body image
and eating disorders.
Flanked by posters reading
"Fmaciation Stinks: Stop Starva
tion Imagery" across images of a
sickly Kate Moss, Kaimondo
spoke about the manipulative
strategies used by marketing ex
ecutives to appeal to both men
and women of all ages — strate
gies that have girls as young as
eight aspiring to unrealistic and
unhealthy standards.
A former anorexic, Kaimon
do listed qualities of women seen
on the pages of popular beauty
magazines. Essentially, if aliens
had to guess what the average
human woman looked like based
on Cosmopolitan and Vogue
magazines, they might assume we
are all tall, blond, blue-eyed,
thin, large-chested — indeed, we
have no pores. Oh yeah, and ap
parently we're all half-naked too
— all the time. And this is just
skimming the surface.
If you take a closer look at ads
today, there are many uncon
scious messages that extend far
beyond appearance. Pre-teens
are dressed to look like vamps.
(>rown women arc outfitted as
schoolgirls complete with pigtails
and lolly-pops. Models sit
through three-hour makeup ap-.
plications only to look like
they've been crying or have two
black eyes. Others pose in sub
servient or defensive positions,
many with their legs spread open.
One ad for Fetish perfume
showed a sultry pubescent girl in
a bikini, the text across her chest
reading: "Fetish rule #16: Apply
generously so he can smell the
scent when you shake your head
no." The ad was pulled last year
when parents began to protest,
but what about all the images of
women ticd-up, trapped in cages
and alcohol bottles?
Kaimondo gave the straight
facts on a typical cover of Cos
mopolitan, a picture of a typical
"beautiful" woman in a smashing
green dress, explosive blond hair,
generous cleavage. The model
was 5-feet-11-inches tall, 120
pounds. It took a total of six
hours to do her hair and makeup.
Not only had the model had her
breasts "done," but also had two

Even after all this, the magic of
Photoshop allowed designers to
shave inches off her hips, stretch
out her arms and add wrinkles to
the dress so it looked looser. All

are reported to be women in their

born complete with thongs for
10-year-olds on the shelves of
Abercroinhie & Fitch.
According to Kainiondo, kids
are socialized early to feed into
traditional marketing tools of

Many students of both genders
have come to Vaden seeking
help for their own eating disor
ders and body image issues, or
those of their friends.

Sex, love and rock n' roll
Government should grant same-sex couples the right to get married
By VINNI INTERSIMONE
SEX COLUMNIST
Pat and Kevin have been together for 30
years. They have two children, a cat, a dog
and a mortgage. Like the heads of any
other family, Pat and Kevin have to provide
for and protect their family. Unlike other
families, however, they have no rights to
over 1,000 federal marriage protections.
Their family does not have the same fiscal
protections gained through special marital
rights in social security, employment bene
fits, tax breaks and death protections. If ei
ther one of them were to be hurt in an acci
dent, his spouse would have no right to visit
the other in a hospital and no right to advise
doctors on how to treat him. If either were
from another country, the other would not
be able to apply for the legal right to live in
the United States. Why? Because our gov
ernment will not allow Pat and Kevin to get
married.
Families of same-sex partners have just as
much of a right to the benefits and protec
tions that come with marriage as families of
opposite-sex partners. The Fourteenth
Amendment requires the government to
give the same rights to every citizen, forming
the foundation of the equal rights amend
ments that abolished slavery, granted voting
rights to all citizens and led to the Civil
Rights Movement that ended segregation.
Marriage is a right granted by the govern
ment, and under the Fourteenth Amend
ment. it must be granted to all citizens, not
just heterosexuals.
Many describe marriage as a "privi
lege" and not a "right," a fundamental fal
lacy. People holding this view believe that
just because marriage has requirements, it
is a privilege, ignoring the fact that many
rights have requirements and restrictions.
A citizen must be at least 18 years old to

and a mortgage. Like the heads of any
other family, Pat and Kevin have to provide
for and protect their family. Unlike other
families, however, they have no rights to
over 1,000 federal marriage protections.
Their family does not have the same fiscal
protections gained through special marital
rights in social security, employment bene
fits, tax breaks and death protections. If ei
ther one of them were to be hurt in an acci
dent, his spouse would have no right to visit
the other in a hospital and no right to advise
doctors on how to treat him. If either were
from another country, the other would not
be able to apply for the legal right to live in
the United States. Why? Because our gov
ernment will not allow Pat and Kevin to get
married.
Families of same-sex partners have just as
much of a right to the benefits and protec
tions that come with marriage as families of
opposite-sex partners. The Fourteenth
Amendment requires the government to
give the same rights to every citizen, forming
the foundation of the equal rights amend
ments that abolished slavery, granted voting
rights to all citizens and led to the Civil
Rights Movement that ended segregation.
Marriage is a right granted by the govern
ment, and under the Fourteenth Amend
ment. it must be granted to all citizens, not
just heterosexuals.
Many describe marriage as a "privi
lege" and not a "right," a fundamental fal
lacy. People holding this view believe that
just because marriage has requirements, it
is a privilege, ignoring the fact that many
rights have requirements and restrictions.
A citizen must be at least 18 years old to
vote, and, in many counties, must be a reg
istered voter. Do these requirements
make voting a privilege and not a right?
The requirements of marriage state that
one must be single, of age and not related
to their intended spouse, but how do these
requirements transform marriage from a
right to a privilege?
Many critics of gay marriage point to polls
showing the majority of Americans are
against same-sex marriages, yet the Consti
tution— and the Fourteenth Amendment's
guarantee to equal rights — was written to
protect the rights of the minorities when the
majority was not acting in a just manner. The
American government has no authority to
deny same-sex couples the right to marriage
they deserve and the benefits of marriage
they need to raise a healthy family simply be
cause the majority of Americans surveyed
do not agree with gay lifestyle. The Constitu
tion is based on fundamental human rights,
not popularity polls.
In recognition of these ideals, on Mon
day, the state of Massachusetts wed same
sex couples, marking the first gay marriages
fully recognized by a state government. If
we glance back at Fat and Kevin, however, if
these two get married in Massachusetts,
their marriage will not be recognized by the
two dozen states that have passed or are at
tempting to pass amendments to their state
constitutions banning gay marriage. Even if
they live in Massachusetts, they are still like
ly to be denied the 1,049 federal rights and
benefits given to opposite-sex couple be
cause the federal Defense of Marriage Act
defines marriage as a union between a man
and a woman.
The victories for equality in Mas
sachusetts should be celebrated, but full
equality has not been achieved. While Pat
and Kevin may be able to get "officially"
married in Massachusetts, their marriage is
Still a second-class marriage, and their rights
as American citizens and as an American
family remain unequal. For same-sex cou
ples to achieve full equality, both the federal
government and state governments must
recognize their right to marry.

Global AIDS Campaign
promotes activism and
awareness on campus
By MICHELLE KELLER
DESK EDITOR
Spreading at an alarming pace, AIDS
has devastated nations in Sub-Saharan
Africa, taxed the health care systems of
many nations and completely changed
several demographic structures around
the globe, often leaving the very old caring
for the very young. Yet many see AIDS
solely as a problem of "other people," of
the developing world or of the poor. This
week, a coalition of Stanford students —
the Stanford Student Global AIDS Cam
paign — is hoping to change the Stanford
community's impressions of AIDS and
AIDS victims this year through a public
awareness campaign.
"The mission of our group is to increase
awareness about
the injustices that
take place around
the world: the high
cost and lack of ac
cessibility to medi
cation, the AIDS
stigma that persists
everywhere and fo
cusing on the fact
that AIDS is not
just a problem in
Africa," said junior
Archana Pasupuleti, one of the Campaign
members. "Many people focus on [Africa]
but the reality is that AIDS is a major
problem in Latin America, India, China,
Eastern Europe — all over the world. We
want people to be aware that it is a prob
lem in the United States as well."
The week's events include a panel
discussion held yesterday evening, enti
tled "The Global AIDS Crisis: The Role
of the U.S. and the International Com
munity. The panel featured two promi
nent AIDS policy and health experts.
Dr. Sara Seims, director of Population
Program at the Hewlett Foundation,
and Stephen F. Morin, professor of
Medicine and Director of the AIDS Pol
icy Research Center at the UC-San
Francisco AIDS Research Institute.
In her portion of the presentation,
Seims focused on the lack of coordination
between family planning organizations
and HIV/AIDS prevention organiza
tions due to limitations on the ways that
funds could be used. Combining the ef
forts of these two types of organizations,
she explained, could lead to more effective
use of funds. Morin discussed U.S. funding
policies for AIDS efforts and noted that
while a significant amount of money was
spent on AIDS prevention, it was nearly
nothing compared to military spending or
the reconstruction of Iraq.
The panel discussion was followed by a
9 p.m. screening of the documentary "A
Closer Walk," as well as the film "A Los
Altos Story." Following the films, stu
dents, staff and faculty members listened
to guest speaker B.J. Stiles, former presi
dent and CEO of the National Leadership
Coalition on AIDS.
Today, the Campaign will try to engage
busy students and faculty members with a
table set up in White Plaza, a spoken word
presentation and a display of the AIDS
Memorial Quilt.
"I think the AIDS quilt makes an sig-

but the reality is that AIDS is a

India, China, Eastern Europe
— all over the world."

nificant impact on people," Pasupuleti
said. "It is so easy to dismiss this as an epi
demic that happens to 'other people,' but
when you see each of the individual
squares sewn by the family members that
suffered from the death of a close one, you
see the devastation that AIDS has brought
about right in front of you."
The Campaign will also sell raffle tick
ets at the White Plaza table. Tickets will be
sold for $1 and prizes will include gift cer
tificates to places such as Jamba Juice and
local restaurants. The funds raised from
the event will go toward the purchase and
distribution of Nevirapine through a non
governmental organization.
"I would like people to realize that this
is not a hopeless situation and that even
small actions that we take can make a dif-
ference," said
sophomore
Colleen Staatz,
who runs the
Campaign's
weekly meet
ings. "For ex
ample, $4 buys
a dose of Nevi
rapine, which
cuts the risk of
moth e r -1 o -
child HIV
transmission by 50 percent, yet many
women never receive this treatment. So
the money that we're raising this week will
have a huge impact when you look at it
that way."
The group has held fundraisers such as
the Student Global AIDS Walk and pizza
eating contests in the past but has chosen
to focus on AIDS education and activism
this year.
"In the long term, I think students can
make a difference in changing U.S. policy
through activism, which our group is hop
ing to focus on more in the future," Staatz
said. "I think that changing people's mind
sets is the most important thing, in terms of
getting them to realize that there actually
is treatment available, but for the most
part it isn't reaching the 95 percent of
HIV-positive people who live in develop
ing countries."
Staatz got involved with the group as a
freshman when she attended an informa
tional meeting and learned about the dev
astating spread of AIDS around the globe.
"Maybe I was naive, but I had no idea
about the extent of the pandemic, and it
completely shocked me," she said. "In
countries like Botswana, 40 percent of
the population is infected — the closest
thing I can compare this to is the Black
Plague in Europe."
Pasupuleti, a human biology major,
became involved in the group after tak
ing a sophomore seminar on AIDS. She
subsequently spent the summer in India
working at an HIV/AIDS clinic,
where she taught workshops on sexual
health, performed clinical work and
counseled patients.
"One of the things I've learned through
my experiences is that medicine can only
take you so far," Pasupuleti said. "You
have to go work at the community level.
And hopefully one day we'll get to the
point where we don't need to diagnose
people with HIV / AIDS anymore."

Beth is a 25-year old customer
service supervisor from Milton,
Wash., a mother and a wife. All
her life she's felt self-conscious,
nursing her low self-esteem. Cue
Fox's new 'reality' show, "The
Swan," and a pack of ruthless
television executives willing to
pay for Beth to reshape her face
and body. Over the duration of
the show, she underwent a brow
lift, nose job, lip enhancement,
chin liposuction, breast augmen
tation, a tummy tuck, calf and
ankle liposuction and dental
surgery.
But it didn't stop there. After
an extended hospital stay and
complaints of excruciating pain,
Beth was put on 1,2(M)-calorie
diet and required to attend be
havior-coaching sessions. The
ciiflhanger: Would Beth stay
with her cheating husband after
her transformation? Sounds al
most as good as "The Appren
tice," right?
Who cares that Beth is only
one of 16 women so miserably
unhappy with their bodies that
they felt the need to overhaul
themselves simply to be accepted
by society.
Many are outraged by the
show, including several Stanford
students — eating disorder
awareness interns at Vaden —
who took to the streets of San
Francisco and White Plaza urg
ing people to write letters
protesting the show and its dam
aging messages. The group asked
passersby to complete the sen
tence: "I don't need a makeover
because..." and to send the re
sponse to Fox. Responses ranged
from "because I earned my beer
belly" to "because I like that I
look like my mom."
Last night, the same band of
interns sponsored a talk by Mar
cclla Kaimondo from About
Face, a nonprofit organization
aimed at exposing the media's in
fluence on negative body image
and eating disorders.
Flanked by posters reading
"Fmaciation Stinks: Stop Starva
tion Imagery" across images of a
sickly Kate Moss, Kaimondo
spoke about the manipulative
strategies used by marketing ex
ecutives to appeal to both men
and women of all ages — strate
gies that have girls as young as
eight aspiring to unrealistic and
unhealthy standards.
A former anorexic, Kaimon
do listed qualities of women seen
on the pages of popular beauty
magazines. Essentially, if aliens
had to guess what the average
human woman looked like based
on Cosmopolitan and Vogue
magazines, they might assume we
are all tall, blond, blue-eyed,
thin, large-chested — indeed, we
have no pores. Oh yeah, and ap
parently we're all half-naked too
— all the time. And this is just
skimming the surface.
If you take a closer look at ads
today, there are many uncon
scious messages that extend far
beyond appearance. Pre-teens
are dressed to look like vamps.
(>rown women arc outfitted as
schoolgirls complete with pigtails
and lolly-pops. Models sit
through three-hour makeup ap-.
plications only to look like
they've been crying or have two
black eyes. Others pose in sub
servient or defensive positions,
many with their legs spread open.
One ad for Fetish perfume
showed a sultry pubescent girl in
a bikini, the text across her chest
reading: "Fetish rule #16: Apply
generously so he can smell the
scent when you shake your head
no." The ad was pulled last year
when parents began to protest,
but what about all the images of
women ticd-up, trapped in cages
and alcohol bottles?
Kaimondo gave the straight
facts on a typical cover of Cos
mopolitan, a picture of a typical
"beautiful" woman in a smashing
green dress, explosive blond hair,
generous cleavage. The model
was 5-feet-11-inches tall, 120
pounds. It took a total of six
hours to do her hair and makeup.
Not only had the model had her
breasts "done," but also had two

Even after all this, the magic of
Photoshop allowed designers to
shave inches off her hips, stretch
out her arms and add wrinkles to
the dress so it looked looser. All
told, the typical fashion cover
costs between the actual
photo shoot and touch-ups.
Even though the demograph
ics for these types of magazines
are reported to be women in their
20s and 30s, just as many elemen
tary school girls absorb the im
ages. And voila, a new market is
born complete with thongs for
10-year-olds on the shelves of
Abercroinhie & Fitch.
According to Kainiondo, kids
are socialized early to feed into
traditional marketing tools of
fear and competition.
"I want students to look at the
media critically and understand
they are being manipulated,"
said Kate Bedford, the peer
health coordinator at Vaden.
"Presentations like this raise

Seven million women
and one million men are
diagnosed with eating
disorders every year,
and 50,00(1 people die
annually from diag
nosed disorders. Not to
mention the eases that
go undiagnosed. In ad
dition, 91 pereent of col
lege women have tried
radical dieting at some
point during their lives.
The Stanford bubble is
no exception, Bedford says.
Many students of both genders
have come to Vaden seeking
help for their own eating disor
ders and body image issues, or
those of their friends.
"When we get bombarded
with images in the media, its
hard to find out for ourselves
what we want to be," said ju
nior Kat Alquero, one of the
event's coordinators and peer
health intern at Vaden. "One
thing I found empowering is to
put my money where my mouth
is and just not buy things from
people who make me feel bad
about my body."
About Face is currently work
ing to educate students of all ages
about the dangers of unrealistic
images and the importance of
loving the skin they're in. For

with your body is an act of rebel

point during their lives.
The Stanford bubble is
no exception, Bedford says.
Many students of both genders
have come to Vaden seeking
help for their own eating disor
ders and body image issues, or
those of their friends.
"When we get bombarded
with images in the media, its
hard to find out for ourselves
what we want to be," said ju
nior Kat Alquero, one of the
event's coordinators and peer
health intern at Vaden. "One
thing I found empowering is to
put my money where my mouth
is and just not buy things from
people who make me feel bad
about my body."
About Face is currently work
ing to educate students of all ages
about the dangers of unrealistic
images and the importance of
loving the skin they're in. For

"These days, being happy
with your body is an act of rebel

Sex, love and rock n' roll
Government should grant same-sex couples the right to get married
By VINNI INTERSIMONE
SEX COLUMNIST
Pat and Kevin have been together for 30
years. They have two children, a cat, a dog
and a mortgage. Like the heads of any
other family, Pat and Kevin have to provide
for and protect their family. Unlike other
families, however, they have no rights to
over 1,000 federal marriage protections.
Their family does not have the same fiscal
protections gained through special marital
rights in social security, employment bene
fits, tax breaks and death protections. If ei
ther one of them were to be hurt in an acci
dent, his spouse would have no right to visit
the other in a hospital and no right to advise
doctors on how to treat him. If either were
from another country, the other would not
be able to apply for the legal right to live in
the United States. Why? Because our gov
ernment will not allow Pat and Kevin to get
married.
Families of same-sex partners have just as
much of a right to the benefits and protec
tions that come with marriage as families of
opposite-sex partners. The Fourteenth
Amendment requires the government to
give the same rights to every citizen, forming
the foundation of the equal rights amend
ments that abolished slavery, granted voting
rights to all citizens and led to the Civil
Rights Movement that ended segregation.
Marriage is a right granted by the govern
ment, and under the Fourteenth Amend
ment. it must be granted to all citizens, not
just heterosexuals.
Many describe marriage as a "privi
lege" and not a "right," a fundamental fal
lacy. People holding this view believe that
just because marriage has requirements, it
is a privilege, ignoring the fact that many
rights have requirements and restrictions.
A citizen must be at least 18 years old to
vote, and, in many counties, must be a reg
istered voter. Do these requirements
make voting a privilege and not a right?
The requirements of marriage state that
one must be single, of age and not related
to their intended spouse, but how do these
requirements transform marriage from a
right to a privilege?
Many critics of gay marriage point to polls
showing the majority of Americans are
against same-sex marriages, yet the Consti
tution— and the Fourteenth Amendment's
guarantee to equal rights — was written to
protect the rights of the minorities when the
majority was not acting in a just manner. The
American government has no authority to
deny same-sex couples the right to marriage
they deserve and the benefits of marriage
they need to raise a healthy family simply be
cause the majority of Americans surveyed
do not agree with gay lifestyle. The Constitu
tion is based on fundamental human rights,
not popularity polls.
In recognition of these ideals, on Mon
day, the state of Massachusetts wed same
sex couples, marking the first gay marriages
fully recognized by a state government. If
we glance back at Fat and Kevin, however, if
these two get married in Massachusetts,
their marriage will not be recognized by the
two dozen states that have passed or are at
tempting to pass amendments to their state
constitutions banning gay marriage. Even if
they live in Massachusetts, they are still like
ly to be denied the 1,049 federal rights and
benefits given to opposite-sex couple be
cause the federal Defense of Marriage Act
defines marriage as a union between a man
and a woman.
The victories for equality in Mas
sachusetts should be celebrated, but full
equality has not been achieved. While Pat
and Kevin may be able to get "officially"
married in Massachusetts, their marriage is
Still a second-class marriage, and their rights
as American citizens and as an American
family remain unequal. For same-sex cou
ples to achieve full equality, both the federal
government and state governments must
recognize their right to marry.
