# Global AIDS Campaign promotes activism and awareness on campus
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Spreading at an alarming pace, AIDS
has devastated nations in Sub-Saharan
Africa, taxed the health care systems of
many nations and completely changed
several demographic structures around
the globe, often leaving the very old caring
for the very young. Yet many see AIDS
solely as a problem of "other people," of
the developing world or of the poor. This
week, a coalition of Stanford students —
the Stanford Student Global AIDS Cam
paign — is hoping to change the Stanford
community's impressions of AIDS and
AIDS victims this year through a public
awareness campaign.
"The mission of our group is to increase
awareness about

the injustices that
take place around
the world: the high
cost and lack of ac
cessibility to medi
cation, the AIDS
stigma that persists
everywhere and fo
cusing on the fact
that AIDS is not
just a problem in
Africa," said junior

Archana Pasupuleti, one of the Campaign
members. "Many people focus on [Africa]
but the reality is that AIDS is a major
problem in Latin America, India, China,
Eastern Europe — all over the world. We
want people to be aware that it is a prob
lem in the United States as well."
The week's events include a panel
discussion held yesterday evening, enti
tled "The Global AIDS Crisis: The Role
of the U.S. and the International Com
munity. The panel featured two promi
nent AIDS policy and health experts.
Dr. Sara Seims, director of Population
Program at the Hewlett Foundation,
and Stephen F. Morin, professor of
Medicine and Director of the AIDS Pol
icy Research Center at the UC-San
Francisco AIDS Research Institute.
In her portion of the presentation,
Seims focused on the lack of coordination
between family planning organizations
and HIV/AIDS prevention organiza
tions due to limitations on the ways that
funds could be used. Combining the ef
forts of these two types of organizations,
she explained, could lead to more effective
use of funds. Morin discussed U.S. funding
policies for AIDS efforts and noted that
while a significant amount of money was
spent on AIDS prevention, it was nearly
nothing compared to military spending or
the reconstruction of Iraq.
The panel discussion was followed by a
9 p.m. screening of the documentary "A
Closer Walk," as well as the film "A Los
Altos Story." Following the films, stu
dents, staff and faculty members listened
to guest speaker B.J. Stiles, former presi
dent and CEO of the National Leadership
Coalition on AIDS.
Today, the Campaign will try to engage
busy students and faculty members with a
table set up in White Plaza, a spoken word
presentation and a display of the AIDS
Memorial Quilt.
"I think the AIDS quilt makes an sig-

nificant impact on people," Pasupuleti
said. "It is so easy to dismiss this as an epi
demic that happens to 'other people,' but
when you see each of the individual
squares sewn by the family members that
suffered from the death of a close one, you
see the devastation that AIDS has brought
about right in front of you."
The Campaign will also sell raffle tick
ets at the White Plaza table. Tickets will be
sold for $1 and prizes will include gift cer
tificates to places such as Jamba Juice and
local restaurants. The funds raised from
the event will go toward the purchase and
distribution of Nevirapine through a non
governmental organization.
"I would like people to realize that this
is not a hopeless situation and that even
small actions that we take can make a dif-

ference," said
sophomore
Colleen Staatz,
who runs the
Campaign's
weekly meet
ings. "For ex
ample, $4 buys
a dose of Nevi
rapine, which
cuts the risk of
moth e r -1 o -

child HIV
transmission by 50 percent, yet many
women never receive this treatment. So
the money that we're raising this week will
have a huge impact when you look at it
that way."
The group has held fundraisers such as
the Student Global AIDS Walk and pizza
eating contests in the past but has chosen
to focus on AIDS education and activism
this year.
"In the long term, I think students can
make a difference in changing U.S. policy
through activism, which our group is hop
ing to focus on more in the future," Staatz
said. "I think that changing people's mind
sets is the most important thing, in terms of
getting them to realize that there actually
is treatment available, but for the most
part it isn't reaching the 95 percent of
HIV-positive people who live in develop
ing countries."
Staatz got involved with the group as a
freshman when she attended an informa
tional meeting and learned about the dev
astating spread of AIDS around the globe.
"Maybe I was naive, but I had no idea
about the extent of the pandemic, and it
completely shocked me," she said. "In
countries like Botswana, 40 percent of
the population is infected — the closest
thing I can compare this to is the Black
Plague in Europe."
Pasupuleti, a human biology major,
became involved in the group after tak
ing a sophomore seminar on AIDS. She
subsequently spent the summer in India
working at an HIV/AIDS clinic,
where she taught workshops on sexual
health, performed clinical work and
counseled patients.
"One of the things I've learned through
my experiences is that medicine can only
take you so far," Pasupuleti said. "You
have to go work at the community level.
And hopefully one day we'll get to the
point where we don't need to diagnose
people with HIV / AIDS anymore."

nificant impact on people," Pasupuleti
said. "It is so easy to dismiss this as an epi
demic that happens to 'other people,' but
when you see each of the individual
squares sewn by the family members that
suffered from the death of a close one, you
see the devastation that AIDS has brought
about right in front of you."
The Campaign will also sell raffle tick
ets at the White Plaza table. Tickets will be
sold for $1 and prizes will include gift cer
tificates to places such as Jamba Juice and
local restaurants. The funds raised from
the event will go toward the purchase and
distribution of Nevirapine through a non
governmental organization.
"I would like people to realize that this
is not a hopeless situation and that even
small actions that we take can make a dif-

ference," said
sophomore
Colleen Staatz,
who runs the
Campaign's
weekly meet
ings. "For ex
ample, $4 buys
a dose of Nevi
rapine, which
cuts the risk of
moth e r -1 o -

child HIV
transmission by 50 percent, yet many
women never receive this treatment. So
the money that we're raising this week will
have a huge impact when you look at it
that way."
The group has held fundraisers such as
the Student Global AIDS Walk and pizza
eating contests in the past but has chosen
to focus on AIDS education and activism
this year.
"In the long term, I think students can
make a difference in changing U.S. policy
through activism, which our group is hop
ing to focus on more in the future," Staatz
said. "I think that changing people's mind
sets is the most important thing, in terms of
getting them to realize that there actually
is treatment available, but for the most
part it isn't reaching the 95 percent of
HIV-positive people who live in develop
ing countries."
Staatz got involved with the group as a
freshman when she attended an informa
tional meeting and learned about the dev
astating spread of AIDS around the globe.
"Maybe I was naive, but I had no idea
about the extent of the pandemic, and it
completely shocked me," she said. "In
countries like Botswana, 40 percent of
the population is infected — the closest
thing I can compare this to is the Black
Plague in Europe."
Pasupuleti, a human biology major,
became involved in the group after tak
ing a sophomore seminar on AIDS. She
subsequently spent the summer in India
working at an HIV/AIDS clinic,
where she taught workshops on sexual
health, performed clinical work and
counseled patients.
"One of the things I've learned through
my experiences is that medicine can only
take you so far," Pasupuleti said. "You
have to go work at the community level.
And hopefully one day we'll get to the
point where we don't need to diagnose
people with HIV / AIDS anymore."
Spreading at an alarming pace, AIDS
has devastated nations in Sub-Saharan
Africa, taxed the health care systems of
many nations and completely changed
several demographic structures around
the globe, often leaving the very old caring
for the very young. Yet many see AIDS
solely as a problem of "other people," of
the developing world or of the poor. This
week, a coalition of Stanford students —
the Stanford Student Global AIDS Cam
paign — is hoping to change the Stanford
community's impressions of AIDS and
AIDS victims this year through a public
awareness campaign.
"The mission of our group is to increase
awareness about

the injustices that
take place around
the world: the high
cost and lack of ac
cessibility to medi
cation, the AIDS
stigma that persists
everywhere and fo
cusing on the fact
that AIDS is not
just a problem in
Africa," said junior

Archana Pasupuleti, one of the Campaign
members. "Many people focus on [Africa]
but the reality is that AIDS is a major
problem in Latin America, India, China,
Eastern Europe — all over the world. We
want people to be aware that it is a prob
lem in the United States as well."
The week's events include a panel
discussion held yesterday evening, enti
tled "The Global AIDS Crisis: The Role
of the U.S. and the International Com
munity. The panel featured two promi
nent AIDS policy and health experts.
Dr. Sara Seims, director of Population
Program at the Hewlett Foundation,
and Stephen F. Morin, professor of
Medicine and Director of the AIDS Pol
icy Research Center at the UC-San
Francisco AIDS Research Institute.
In her portion of the presentation,
Seims focused on the lack of coordination
between family planning organizations
and HIV/AIDS prevention organiza
tions due to limitations on the ways that
funds could be used. Combining the ef
forts of these two types of organizations,
she explained, could lead to more effective
use of funds. Morin discussed U.S. funding
policies for AIDS efforts and noted that
while a significant amount of money was
spent on AIDS prevention, it was nearly
nothing compared to military spending or
the reconstruction of Iraq.
The panel discussion was followed by a
9 p.m. screening of the documentary "A
Closer Walk," as well as the film "A Los
Altos Story." Following the films, stu
dents, staff and faculty members listened
to guest speaker B.J. Stiles, former presi
dent and CEO of the National Leadership
Coalition on AIDS.
Today, the Campaign will try to engage
busy students and faculty members with a
table set up in White Plaza, a spoken word
presentation and a display of the AIDS
Memorial Quilt.
