The Deadline is November 1,
but the time to prepare is
The Paul & Daisy Soros
Fellowships for New Americans
Who's eligible? What can you use it for?
How do you know what they're looking for?
If you are a green card holder, naturalized citizen, or the child of two natu
ralized citizens, you are eligible for the Soros Fellowships for New
Americans. If you are selected as a fellow, you will receive a stipend of
$20,000 plus one half the tuition for your graduate program PER YEAR.
The deadline is November 1, 2004, but the most successful candidates are
those who work far in advance on the application, particularly on the state
ment of purpose.
If you are graduating in 2005 and thinking about applying for this generous
fellowship by the November deadline, or believe that you will apply in a
subsequent year, attend an informational meeting hosted by two Associate
Directors of Undergraduate Research Programs, Renee Courey and Hilton
Obenzinger, and the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education Special
Assistant for Diversity Outreach, Laura Selznick. The meeting will be held
Tuesday,
May 25 from noon -1:00 p.m.
in Tresidder Oak East.
We will talk about the application process and the individualized support
services we offer you to ensure that your application is highly competitive.
Lunch will be served, so please r.s.v.p. to rcourey@stanford.edu and type
"Soros Yes" in the subject line of your reply. Thank you!
