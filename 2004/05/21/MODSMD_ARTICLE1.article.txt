### DAVID HERBERT MANAGING EDITOR 
Sophomores Chioke Borgelt-Mose and
Kory Vargas Caro are the winners of the spe
cial executive election, the ASSU Elections
Commission announced yesterday at noon at
the Coffee House.

The final tally had Chioke/Kory finishing
ahead of senior Charlie Stockman and junior
Matthew Henick of the Chappie slate with 1247
votes to their 805.
"I'm very excited," Borgelt-Mose said after
the election results were released. "Like every
one else, we're ready to move on forward from

the drama of last month."
With Chioke/Kory the favorites going into
the contest, the biggest upset came in the battle
for second place, as the Chappie slate edged
out senior Mikey Lee and sophomore Alyssa
Schwartz with 805 votes to their 661 in the third
elimination round of the instant runoff voting.
Lee and junior Dylan Mefford won the first

executive election last month, but the Under
graduate Senate twice refused to certify the re
sults, arguing that e-mails Lee sent to the Class
of 2004 list represented a violation of the Cam
paign Practice Code and an "abuse of power."
Mefford brought a suit to the ASSU Constitu
tional Council, claiming that the Senate's re

fusal to certify the results was unconstitutional
because it infringed on free speech rights. Mef
ford won that case, but a suit brought by Lee
after the Senate declined to validate the elec
tion a second time was defeated last Sunday,
opening the door for the release of the special
election results.
The outcome came as no surprise to the
Lee/Schwartz camp.
"I'm not at all surprised by the numbers,"
Lee said. "Many people didn't know about the
special election, and Alyssa and I were defi
nitely at a disadvantage because of this."
Lee also complained of what he perceived to
be the partisan tone of the Senate and Consti
tutional Council proceedings.
"It's just an unfortunate situation handled by
many biased people, and it's too bad that the
student body will not be able to see some of the
great plans we had in store for it,"he said.
After over six weeks of controversy and uncer
tainty, candidates agreed that Borgelt-Mose and
VargasCaroface an uphill bat t least hey at tempt to
restore t he i n tegrity of the ASS U.
"I think it's going to be very difficult,"
Borgelt-Mose said. "People are fed up."
Others concurred.
"The organization's accessibility and espe
cially its credibility are also challenges that its
leaders will need to overcome," Lee added.
The situation is a tough one, some argued.
"I think it would be difficult for anyone com
ing in," said outgoing ASSU President Nadiya
Figueroa, a senior.
Figueroa, however, saw cause for hope.
"I think their commitment and dedication
will help them," she said.
The Senate will convene Monday to decide
whether or not to certify these results, another
uncertainty in the current political climate.
"I hope there won't be problems with the
legislative bodies," Figueroa said.
Whatever political turmoil lies ahead,
Henick and Stockman expressed optimism.
"As second-place winners, we were just glad
that everyone on campus can finally continue
living their livesafter holding their collective
breath for over a month. At long last, the post
office door will be fixed," they wrote in a state
ment after the results were released.
