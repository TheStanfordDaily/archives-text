## Seniors, can you handle this? 
### 
One-hundred eighty units, four years, three quar
ters of I-Hum, one year of a foreign language,
two quarters of WCT. You'd think we'd have
learned a little something at this fine institution.
But this Saturday night at Senior Formal, we'll really
be put to the test — do we know how to handle ourselves
in public, and more importantly, do we know how to han
dle our liquor?
Last year, some brilliant mind came up with the idea of
having the annual Senior Formal at the Monterey Bay
Aquarium.

"Wow," we said,
when we first heard the
news. "That's such a great
idea."
We're not going to lie
— we were a little jealous.
But then Senior Formal
2003 happened. Seniors, a
bunch of crazy kids getting
ready to leave the safety of
the Stanford bubble that
they have enjoyed for the
past four years, thrown to-

gether in one giant, alcohol-soaked crowd. All in a facility
packed with live animal exhibits. Those poor, poor fish.
(Though honestly, has Palo Alto shown respect for the life
of an animal recently? We think the mountain lion inci
dent proves that people around here don't care about our
furry friends.)
Needless to say. the aquarium didn't invite us back this
year. But that's OK — super Senior Class President Shay
na Fernandez (missing in action again?) booked us the
San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Sure, there may
not be fragile marine life for us to destroy, but there sure
as hell will be millions of dollars worth of precious modern
art to piss on, vomit on, or whatever else a group of drunk
college seniors can think of on their celebratory night out
on the town.
We're not complaining about the location of this
year's Senior Formal. Trust us, we're thrilled. We can live
out our fantasies of being in Sex and the City. All dressed
up, sipping champagne, looking at art in a fabulous muse
um.
But we can see the imminent disaster. We're going to
paint you our own picture of the night. Everyone is danc
ing, having a grand ol' time, and someone inevitably real
ly needs to go to the bathroom. So he wanders over to the
toilet, unzips his pants, plants his feet in a steady stance
and ... no! Wait! That's no toilet-that's an exhibit of mod
ern art. Forget the fact that it is, in fact, just a toilet. The
rope surrounding the exhibit means it's much much more
than just a toilet. Great job asshole. You just f —ed up
someone's lifelong work.
That's the thing with modern art — sometimes you
just can't tell it from everyday objects. But is a little old
museum docent really going to be able to fight a football
player from taking a shit on a toilet by claiming that it's
art? Of course, the SFMOMA will have to have security
tighter than Exotic Erotic in order to prevent the shit from
going down.
We hear that only one floor of exhibits will be open for
touring, and that the floor will be closed as the night wears
on to prevent any real disaster from happening. We will
have the unique opportunity to walk amongst works by fa
mous artists. Henri Matisse, Frida Kahlo and Georgia
O'Keefe, and many others. But most importantly, Takashi
Murakami, the artist who painted Courtney's beloved
Louis Vuitton purse.
What we're really trying to say is, isn't it amazing how
we can be graduating from Stanford with a world-class de
gree, a world-class education, awards, accolades, a world
of knowledge gained from the experience, and yet we still
act no older than a bunch of kids at a homecoming dance?
Of course, we can't imagine how we ever attended any
of those homecoming dances sober. But we were good lit
tle girls once.
So warn one of us if we get too close to the Monet. We
don't want to knock it off the wall.
