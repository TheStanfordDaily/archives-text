# Bringing Asia to Stanford
## Asia Technology Initiative provides unique opportunities 
### MICHAEL DUCA 
Stanford works hard to leave
its fingerprints all around the
globe, and some might say, in Asia,
it is succeeding, thanks in part to
the Asia Technology Initiative, or
ATI. Simply put, ATI brings cur
rent Stanford students — both un
dergraduate and graduat — to
technology "clusters" in Asia
(most recently Shanghai, Banga
lore, and Singapore) and connects
them with local businesses. Stu
dents go over the summer to em
bark on intensive internship, with
their travel and housing arrange
ments pre-organized and paid by
the University.
Freshman Aditya Singh, who
joined ATI and is now an Associ
ate Director of the India branch,
said that ATI provides an oppor
tunity "that most freshmen
wouldn't dream about doing."
However, for those who are
chosen to participate, ATI is
much more than summer camp.
The program expects its partic
ipants to possess not only a
steadfast work ethic, but also
requires them to prepare aca
demically for their experience
through training in technolo
gy, business, and en
trepreneurship. When they ar
rive in Asia for their intern
ships, students must be pre
pared for an atmosphere of
hard work — but participants
are universally willing to un
dergo the work, because they
realize the tremendous oppor
tunities they are receiving.
Raja Shah traveled to Banga
lore during the summer of 2001.
"I found myself having dinner
with distinguished members of
elite institutions, engaging in dis
cussions with influential and dis
tinguished representatives from
industry, and working closely with
senior VPs of the company at
which I worked," Shah said.
ATI directors describe the
program as a complete immersion
and exposure experience, which
depends on the self-motivation of
participants for success. Kather
ine Chou is an ATI China Mar
keting Director.
"These fellows have to have
the substance and initiative to
take on monumental tasks, start
ing at ground zero. ATI simply
provides the framework; we leave
it up to these fellows to forge a
ticket to Asia and our current

connections into the golden op
portunity to reach the most experi
enced entrepreneurs and academ
ic luminaries in the playing field,"
Chou said.
"The whole point of ATI is to
cultivate an unbiased grassroots
foundation in young en
trepreneurs. ATI seeks free-think
ing individuals who are sincerely
open to new encounters and new
environments and honestly desire
to make a change in the dynamics
of globalization for the better,"
Chou added.
Students who participate in
ATI programs remark on the
amazing opportunities afforded to
them.
"I was often amazed at the op
portunities presented to me,"
Shah said.
Yet the ATI program benefits
not just students, but also Stan
ford. Stanford has always sought
to create and cultivate relation
ships overseas. Vivek Sankaran is
an Executive Director of ATI.
"ATl's programs are some of
Stanford's most prominent in
building the Stanford-Asia con
nection, and we hope to see the ini
tiative take on even greater roles

in being the University's flagship
global entrepreneurship program
in the future," Sankaran said.
ATI works hard to create and
nurture a community of individu
als who feel passionate about
bringing together Silicon Valley
and the emerging Asian technolo
gy centers. Last week, ATI hosted
its annual reception in the Faculty
Club for members, comprising
Stanford students and professors,
as well as Silicon Valley business
people, technology leaders, and
industry capitalists. The reception
was hosted by Provost John Brav
man, and featured keynote speak
er Dr. Hong Chen of the Beijing
based investment banking firm
Hina Group.
In his speech, Chen discussed
the increasing prominence of
China and India in the global
economy, and encouraged Chi
nese and Indian students at Stan
ford to use both their knowledge
in global affairs and domestic ex
pertise to make the greatest im
pact possible.
ATI hopes to grow in the
upcoming years by attracting
more student participants in
the program, making new con

nections in Asia, and strength
ening the relationships that al
ready exist.
"ATI will hopefully further
expand its ability to build long
term ties between Stanford and
Asia. In order to do this, ATI
will continue to target a wider
range of disciplines. This sum
mer, we are sending to Asia stu
dents from the Law School as
well as the Stanford Graduate
School of Business, along with
many undergraduates ranging
from computer science to eco
nomic. ATI will also deepen its
relationships with the School of
Engineering, getting even more
Stanford faculty representation
at the Global Entrepreneurship
Conferences each summer and
build an even more concrete aca
demic component to the pro
gram," Sankaran said.
"In tandem with this effort to
build even more varied ties with
the University will hopefully be
ATl's increased effort to work
with even more industry and gov
ernment leaders in the U.S. who
have a similar interest in cultivat
ing global entrepreneurship,"
Sankaran added.

ATI directors describe the
program as a complete immersion

depends on the self-motivation of
participants for success. Kather

"These fellows have to have
the substance and initiative to
take on monumental tasks, start
ing at ground zero. ATI simply
provides the framework; we leave
it up to these fellows to forge a
ticket to Asia and our current

connections into the golden op
portunity to reach the most experi
enced entrepreneurs and academ
ic luminaries in the playing field,"
Chou said.
"The whole point of ATI is to
cultivate an unbiased grassroots
foundation in young en
trepreneurs. ATI seeks free-think
ing individuals who are sincerely
open to new encounters and new
environments and honestly desire
to make a change in the dynamics
of globalization for the better,"
Chou added.
Students who participate in
ATI programs remark on the
amazing opportunities afforded to
them.
"I was often amazed at the op
portunities presented to me,"
Shah said.
Yet the ATI program benefits
not just students, but also Stan
ford. Stanford has always sought
to create and cultivate relation
ships overseas. Vivek Sankaran is
an Executive Director of ATI.
"ATl's programs are some of
Stanford's most prominent in
building the Stanford-Asia con
nection, and we hope to see the ini
tiative take on even greater roles

in being the University's flagship
global entrepreneurship program
in the future," Sankaran said.
ATI works hard to create and
nurture a community of individu
als who feel passionate about
bringing together Silicon Valley
and the emerging Asian technolo
gy centers. Last week, ATI hosted
its annual reception in the Faculty
Club for members, comprising
Stanford students and professors,
as well as Silicon Valley business
people, technology leaders, and
industry capitalists. The reception
was hosted by Provost John Brav
man, and featured keynote speak
er Dr. Hong Chen of the Beijing
based investment banking firm
Hina Group.
In his speech, Chen discussed
the increasing prominence of
China and India in the global
economy, and encouraged Chi
nese and Indian students at Stan
ford to use both their knowledge
in global affairs and domestic ex
pertise to make the greatest im
pact possible.
ATI hopes to grow in the
upcoming years by attracting
more student participants in
the program, making new con

nections in Asia, and strength
ening the relationships that al
ready exist.
"ATI will hopefully further
expand its ability to build long
term ties between Stanford and
Asia. In order to do this, ATI
will continue to target a wider
range of disciplines. This sum
mer, we are sending to Asia stu
dents from the Law School as
well as the Stanford Graduate
School of Business, along with
many undergraduates ranging
from computer science to eco
nomic. ATI will also deepen its
relationships with the School of
Engineering, getting even more
Stanford faculty representation
at the Global Entrepreneurship
Conferences each summer and
build an even more concrete aca
demic component to the pro
gram," Sankaran said.
"In tandem with this effort to
build even more varied ties with
the University will hopefully be
ATl's increased effort to work
with even more industry and gov
ernment leaders in the U.S. who
have a similar interest in cultivat
ing global entrepreneurship,"
Sankaran added.

Stanford works hard to leave
its fingerprints all around the
globe, and some might say, in Asia,
it is succeeding, thanks in part to
the Asia Technology Initiative, or
ATI. Simply put, ATI brings cur
rent Stanford students — both un
dergraduate and graduat — to
technology "clusters" in Asia
(most recently Shanghai, Banga
lore, and Singapore) and connects
them with local businesses. Stu
dents go over the summer to em
bark on intensive internship, with
their travel and housing arrange
ments pre-organized and paid by
the University.
Freshman Aditya Singh, who
joined ATI and is now an Associ
ate Director of the India branch,
said that ATI provides an oppor
tunity "that most freshmen
wouldn't dream about doing."
However, for those who are
chosen to participate, ATI is
much more than summer camp.
The program expects its partic
ipants to possess not only a
steadfast work ethic, but also
requires them to prepare aca
demically for their experience
through training in technolo
gy, business, and en
trepreneurship. When they ar
rive in Asia for their intern
ships, students must be pre
pared for an atmosphere of
hard work — but participants
are universally willing to un
dergo the work, because they
realize the tremendous oppor
tunities they are receiving.
