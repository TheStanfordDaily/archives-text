## Cellular service can be improved 
### 
The continued reliance of cell-on-wheels
devices for meeting the cellular service
needs of the University's 16,000-plus
employees, students and residents is
simply embarrassing. This is not a secluded for
est community such as Pebble Beach, but rather
a hub around which Silicon Valley spins. Cellular
service should not only be satisfactory here, but
should also serve as a showcase for the rest of the
country. Information Technology Systems and
Services (ITSS) and the University should con
tinue to work together with AT&T (and its com
petitors) to utilize cutting edge technology and
innovation to provide superior mobile service to
the Stanford community at large.
The challenge of maintaining the aesthetic
character of the University while at the same
time providing adequate service to a huge com
munity are substantial — and not a problem that
is unique to Stanford. Locally, many smaller
communities such as Carmel-By-The-Sea, Mon
terey and Pacific Grove have turned to innova
tive solutions — such as hiding cell towers in
flagpoles and camouflaging them as trees — to
balance the need for increased demand with a de
sire not to mar the beautiful landscape with an

ugly cell tower. Thus, we believe there can be a
middle ground between unobtrusive cell-on
wheels trailers and tall ugly towers.
A cottage industry has sprung up to satisfy the
burgeoning demand for maintaining aesthetics
while enhancing coverage. Firms such as The Lar
son Company, which previously earned its money
by hiding the mechanization that makes amuse
ment parks such as Disneyland tick behind all the
scenery, specialize in producing unique solutions
for these exact sorts of reception issues. Other
companies such as Alan Dick & Company Com
posites and Lentech Communications have also
entered this marketplace.
We are glad that ITSS is taking the time to ad
dress the coverage problem. Students no doubt
appreciate this. We urge both ITSS and AT&T to
continue to work together toward producing a
custom-tailored solution to Stanford's exceeding
ly annoying wireless service problem. And if
AT&T proves unwilling to investigate more per
manent options than two trailers on opposite sides
of campus, we are sure that other providers in the
highly fast-paced and competitive cellular market
will be more than willing to put out bids when the
University's contract with AT&T expires.
