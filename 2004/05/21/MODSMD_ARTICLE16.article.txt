# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Fast food info on the go 
### 
Tfiis is a fast food nation. Drive
thrus, debit cards, fast food,
quantum computing, instant
cash withdrawal, instant mes
saging. quick cash, speed dial, speed
round, remote control, EZ cheese.
Sometimes I call my friends from
my cell phone when I'm in their drive
ways, because it saves me 12 seconds
not to have to get out of the car and ring
the doorbell.
Google's founders are going to be
billionaires by age 30-something be
cause they make it quicker and easier
to locate Web pages.
And we all abbreviate words be
cause we don't want to go through the
trouble of saying them in entirety:
JK, LOL, BRB, ROTL, CoHo,
MemChu, LaAPreHu — which re
spectively stand for Just Kidding,
Laughing Out Loud, Be Right Back,
Rocking Out To Lars Horris. Coffee
House, Frozen Yogurt, Lame And
Predictable Humor.
It all makes perfect sense. I'm not
ranting about it — that would be out of
character, anyway. It's part of Darwini
an nature to cut out the fat, to get to the
heart of the matter, the meat of things.
To skip right to intercourse.
But there are cons to this whole
quick-and-easy approach to existence.
For example, we can't all take time to
learn the intricacies of every issue, so
we have to rely on media to provide the
Cliffs Notes to current events. This
power of information is easily abused
by news organizations such as FOX
News Channel. FOX News uses its
own whacked value system when de
ciding what parts of a complex story
should be played down or ignored in
order to fit a segment between two
Ditech commercials. It's like replacing
bananas in your diet with chocolate
covered bacon.
Another side effect of this fast food
nation is our increased reliance on
sound bites in political discourse. Not
everyone can know the GDP of
Switzerland or the geopolitical conse
quences of signing a nonproliferation
treaty. Americans don't have time to sit
through 24 hours of cable news or wade
through 4(X) bazillion bytes of cyber-in
formation. Some have to spend their
time teaching elementary school, driv
ing their kids to karate class or burying
cadavers in their neighbors' yards.
Many have to rely on oversimplified
representations of worldly dilemmas.
The mere simplification of issues, how
ever. can lead to suboptimal solutions.

Think Republican Party.
George W. Bush is neither good nor
bad at sound bites. On one hand, his en
tire decision-making processes can be
fit within the 10-second limit of a news
caster's attention span:

On gay mar
riage: "The sacred
institution of mar
riage should not be
redefined by a few
activist judges."
On Iraq: "Sad
dam is a bad man."
On God: "I
believe God
wants me to be
president."
On God and

Iraq: "Freedom is the Almighty's gift
to every man and woman in the world.
And as the greatest power on the face
of the earth, we have an obligation to
help the spread of freedom."
Sound bites are usually good for
people who frown upon complexity.
However, Bush's difficulty with a first
language balances out his simple
thought processes. He saturates the air
waves with as many bad sound bites as
good ones:
"Well, 1 think if you say you're
going to do something and don't do it,
that's trustworthiness."
"My views are one that speaks to
freedom."
"Families is where our nation finds
hope, where wings take dream."
But, John Kerry's campaign is
weaker on the sound bite front. He
can't seem to get past the criticism that
he straddles both sides of an issue. For
example, his explanation for voting for
the war on Iraq and against the $87 bil
lion was pretty solid, but it took him
about four minutes on "Meet the
Press." He needs to realize that he
won't keep the attention of the televi
sion-viewing public for as long as four
minutes unless he starts dropping F
bombs orturningTeresa Heinz over on
her head and spanking her bottom.
Like a ketchup bottle, get it?
Heinz ketchup?
Actually, I wouldn't watch that.
My suggestion for Kerry is to ex
plain himself through pop music. Not
many people know the real reason
why Kerry's voting record makes him
look like a flip-flopping opportunist,
but I bet 80 percent of you know what
lyric follows:
"I would swallow my pride, I would
choke on the rinds..."
How about "I like big butts and I

can not lie ..."?
Chances are. you've memorized
about 2,(XX) megabytes worth of song
lyrics. It's time for Kerry to get on the
ball and capitalize on the public's
preference to sit through five minute
of catchy tunes over five minutes of
political hogwash. Instead of "Meet
the Press" with Tim Russert, he
could go on TRL and explain to Car
son Daly why he voted to give the ex
ecutive branch sole discretion in
going to war.
"I authorized the use of force. Sue
me.
It's not like I hired an intern who
blew me.
I put trust in the president back in
the day
Then he went cuckoo-for-Christ
and Bush-slapped the gays.
In the war on Iraq, he attacked uni
laterally,
Apparently, to make a Biggie-Sized
ass of me."
And then to explain why he later
voted against the $87 billion:
"I've got a new motto and it goes
like this
' Don't get ridden by that Texas
bitch.'
His eighty-seven thousand million
dollar bill
Is ganking future money from your
fu-ture daughter, Jill.
G.O.P, yeah you know greed.
Their goons are buying bullshit like
a shopping spree.
But I am legit. I am for real.
Ain't votin' 'Yay' 'cause I don't like
to steal.
You know if the war package came
down to me,
Those bombs would be loaners, not
five-linger free.
Are you dumb enough to think I'd
diss the troops?
Are you dumb enough to think I'd
diss the troops'.'"
I wrote that.
Senator Kerry, I'm a little short on
cash after giving to Senior Gift (I
thought I'd be getting a gift, not giving
one), so I offer you my mediocre verse
free of charge to help you campaign
through our fast food election.

Heinz ketchup?
Actually, I wouldn't watch that.
My suggestion for Kerry is to ex
plain himself through pop music. Not
many people know the real reason
why Kerry's voting record makes him
look like a flip-flopping opportunist,
but I bet 80 percent of you know what
lyric follows:
"I would swallow my pride, I would
choke on the rinds..."
How about "I like big butts and I

can not lie ..."?
Chances are. you've memorized
about 2,(XX) megabytes worth of song
lyrics. It's time for Kerry to get on the
ball and capitalize on the public's
preference to sit through five minute
of catchy tunes over five minutes of
political hogwash. Instead of "Meet
the Press" with Tim Russert, he
could go on TRL and explain to Car
son Daly why he voted to give the ex
ecutive branch sole discretion in
going to war.
"I authorized the use of force. Sue
me.
It's not like I hired an intern who
blew me.
I put trust in the president back in
the day
Then he went cuckoo-for-Christ
and Bush-slapped the gays.
In the war on Iraq, he attacked uni
laterally,
Apparently, to make a Biggie-Sized
ass of me."
And then to explain why he later
voted against the $87 billion:
"I've got a new motto and it goes
like this
' Don't get ridden by that Texas
bitch.'
His eighty-seven thousand million
dollar bill
Is ganking future money from your
fu-ture daughter, Jill.
G.O.P, yeah you know greed.
Their goons are buying bullshit like
a shopping spree.
But I am legit. I am for real.
Ain't votin' 'Yay' 'cause I don't like
to steal.
You know if the war package came
down to me,
Those bombs would be loaners, not
five-linger free.
Are you dumb enough to think I'd
diss the troops?
Are you dumb enough to think I'd
diss the troops'.'"
I wrote that.
Senator Kerry, I'm a little short on
cash after giving to Senior Gift (I
thought I'd be getting a gift, not giving
one), so I offer you my mediocre verse
free of charge to help you campaign
through our fast food election.

Tfiis is a fast food nation. Drive
thrus, debit cards, fast food,
quantum computing, instant
cash withdrawal, instant mes
saging. quick cash, speed dial, speed
round, remote control, EZ cheese.
Sometimes I call my friends from
my cell phone when I'm in their drive
ways, because it saves me 12 seconds
not to have to get out of the car and ring
the doorbell.
Google's founders are going to be
billionaires by age 30-something be
cause they make it quicker and easier
to locate Web pages.
And we all abbreviate words be
cause we don't want to go through the
trouble of saying them in entirety:
JK, LOL, BRB, ROTL, CoHo,
MemChu, LaAPreHu — which re
spectively stand for Just Kidding,
Laughing Out Loud, Be Right Back,
Rocking Out To Lars Horris. Coffee
House, Frozen Yogurt, Lame And
Predictable Humor.
It all makes perfect sense. I'm not
ranting about it — that would be out of
character, anyway. It's part of Darwini
an nature to cut out the fat, to get to the
heart of the matter, the meat of things.
To skip right to intercourse.
But there are cons to this whole
quick-and-easy approach to existence.
For example, we can't all take time to
learn the intricacies of every issue, so
we have to rely on media to provide the
Cliffs Notes to current events. This
power of information is easily abused
by news organizations such as FOX
News Channel. FOX News uses its
own whacked value system when de
ciding what parts of a complex story
should be played down or ignored in
order to fit a segment between two
Ditech commercials. It's like replacing
bananas in your diet with chocolate
covered bacon.
Another side effect of this fast food
nation is our increased reliance on
sound bites in political discourse. Not
everyone can know the GDP of
Switzerland or the geopolitical conse
quences of signing a nonproliferation
treaty. Americans don't have time to sit
through 24 hours of cable news or wade
through 4(X) bazillion bytes of cyber-in
formation. Some have to spend their
time teaching elementary school, driv
ing their kids to karate class or burying
cadavers in their neighbors' yards.
Many have to rely on oversimplified
representations of worldly dilemmas.
The mere simplification of issues, how
ever. can lead to suboptimal solutions.

Think Republican Party.
George W. Bush is neither good nor
bad at sound bites. On one hand, his en
tire decision-making processes can be
fit within the 10-second limit of a news
caster's attention span:

On gay mar
riage: "The sacred
institution of mar
riage should not be
redefined by a few
activist judges."
On Iraq: "Sad
dam is a bad man."
On God: "I
believe God
wants me to be
president."
On God and

Iraq: "Freedom is the Almighty's gift
to every man and woman in the world.
And as the greatest power on the face
of the earth, we have an obligation to
help the spread of freedom."
Sound bites are usually good for
people who frown upon complexity.
However, Bush's difficulty with a first
language balances out his simple
thought processes. He saturates the air
waves with as many bad sound bites as
good ones:
"Well, 1 think if you say you're
going to do something and don't do it,
that's trustworthiness."
"My views are one that speaks to
freedom."
"Families is where our nation finds
hope, where wings take dream."
But, John Kerry's campaign is
weaker on the sound bite front. He
can't seem to get past the criticism that
he straddles both sides of an issue. For
example, his explanation for voting for
the war on Iraq and against the $87 bil
lion was pretty solid, but it took him
about four minutes on "Meet the
Press." He needs to realize that he
won't keep the attention of the televi
sion-viewing public for as long as four
minutes unless he starts dropping F
bombs orturningTeresa Heinz over on
her head and spanking her bottom.
Like a ketchup bottle, get it?
