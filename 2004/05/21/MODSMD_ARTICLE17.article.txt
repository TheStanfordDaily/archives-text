# THE 						WORLD ACCORDING TO DAN
## India and the global democracy 
### 
Vive la democratic! This week
proved a good one for the
United States' most cher
ished principle, both at Stan
ford and abroad. With the ASSU sena
tors firmly holding their ground and re
fusing to re-certify the original elec
tions. the second round should produce
the "student's choice."
Miles and worlds outside the bub
ble, a similarly democratic process
reigns as the people of India welcome
their newest prime minister, Monmo
han Singh. Instead of being directly
elected by the voters or resurrected by
an electoral college, Singh's party, the
Indian National Congress, appointed
him after winning a plurality of the 384
million votes cast last Thursday.
Singh's selection marked the sec
ond of two huge surprises in India,
both of which highlighted its embrac
ing of a new, global democracy. First
came the ousting of former Prime
Minister Bihari Vajpayee of the large
ly Hindu "Bharatiya Janata Party."
Seeking to harness the rebounding
economy and the success of recent
peace talks with Pakistan, Vajpayee
called early elections in order to secure
his seat for another term. Yet in a po
litical shocker, the Indian voters — led
by the pwr and working class — re
jected the economic reform policies of
Vajpayee and instead chose the party
of the Indian National Congress
(INC) with foreign-born Sonia Gand
hi at its helm.
The second surprise came
Wednesday. In reaction to the elec
tion of the INC on the strength of the

working class vote, and the expected
rise of Sonia Gandhi as prime minis
ter, the Indian stock market — the
Sensex — plunged a whopping 11
percent in one day. When Indian

stockbrokers
protested and for
eign hedge funds
began pulling in
vestments out of
India, Sonia
Gandhi and the
INC responded
with Monmohan
Singh, the former
financial minister
that saved India
from brink of eco-

nomic disaster in 1991.
While Singh represents some of the
economic reforms against which Indi
ans voted in the recent elections, Singh
cannot enact his economic reform poli
cies without keeping a keen eye on the
masses that remain in poverty. Why
not? Because they vote. In this elec
tion, as in history, India's poorest peo
ple reached the polls in far greater
number than the rich who have bene
fited from the recent economic boom.
The moment Singh forgets about his
constituency, he will find himself out of
the job.
India's globally-conscious democra
cy illuminates some of the United
States' shortcomings. While U.S. elec
tions pit the Republicans against the
Democrats, Indian voters chose last
Thursday among 220 parties. Unlike in
India, U.S. presidential candidates
focus on winning the support of the

rich, as the poor and unemployed vote
with far less consistency. Most impor
tantly, while India responds to the
world, the United States forces the
world to respond to it.
In 2000, the 50 million Americans
who elected arguably the most power
ful individual in the world kept their
votes focused on domestic issues. After
all, George W. Bush came to office on a
platform of isolationism ("no nation
building" went the mantra). Since re
cent history has proven that Bush's
policies extend far beyond the borders
of his electorate, both the electorate
and the leader should similarly extend
their own sensibilities.
In the global democracy, Indian
leaders respond not only to the voters,
but to the needs of their country and its
investors. For our part, we too often ig
nore the foreign "investors" that await
the results of our November elections.
The U.S. president affects many peo
ple in this world far more than their
own head of state. The global hedge
funds of goodwill and belief in Ameri
can leadership threaten to dry up for
good in the absence of regime change
at home.
In the wake of India's triumph, we
should consider the global implications
of our vote in November. Even the
most selfish U.S. voter must recognize
the power of his ballot. Even the most
powerful president must remember the
strength of the world's reaction.
