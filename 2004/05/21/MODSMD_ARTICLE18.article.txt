Mountain lion should
not have been killed
Monday's mountain lion killing reminded
me exactly how anthropocentric humans can
be. The Palo Alto Police Department's excuse
for shooting the animal with a bullet instead of a
tranquilizer is that tranquilizers take up to 20
minutes to work.

There's a simple solution to that: Make
more effective tranquilizers. People have gone
to great lengths to figure out how to humanely
subdue threatening humans; why don't we grant
this dignity to animals? Just because we have the
power to kill doesn't mean we should do it with
out having developed more ethical options.
In addition, 1 was dismayed to read that Of
ficer Cori Preheim uttered a sardonic and in
sensitive remark before she killed the mountain

lion: She called to a colleague, "Ask him if he
wants me to shoot it." If she truly thought the cat
had the power to comprehend what was hap
pening, she should not have shot it. Conversely,
if she didn't think the cat could understand her,
this comment merely added insult to injury.
To further sanction their action, the police
department consulted with the Fish and Game
Department, which told the officers that their
actions had been perfectly justified. Of course

they would say that — they are among the
largest proponents of recreationally hunting
and killing animals. I was left wondering why
the police department did not consult with a hu
mane society instead, or at least as well.
This animal was young and timid enough
fora dog to chase it up a tree, where it closed its
eyes in a false sense of security. After it was shot,
it grasped for branches as it fell to its death. By
some accounts, it took 15 long minutes for the

mountain lion to die of its wound.
We humans need to remember that we are
the newcomers. We encroached on wilderness,
on animals' homes, and yet we feel we have the
right to kill them at will. It is the same despicable
way of thinking that led to so many European
killings of American Indians years ago.
