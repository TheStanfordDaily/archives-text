## Groupies, friends, it's all a mystery 
### 
Take a kx)k at my picture. Yes,
the same one that's been there
for the hist 28 weeks. Now, the
next time you see me talking to
an athlete, or more specifically, a male
athlete, or better yet, a 6-foot-10 black
basketball center named Rob Little, re
call that 1 told you to remember my face
and chill the fuck out.
Maybe it's part of Stanford's great di
versity: We have chemical engineers, fu
ture Hollywood directors, Fulbright
scholars, the nation's best water polo
player, a professional hacker and a hand
ful of aspiring groupies.
Yes, groupies. I know, outdated
term, but still slightly more acceptable
than "hoes." Stanford is home to a small
population of aspiring rich house-wives,
if you can believe it. It's really a matter of

taste — some
groupies want to be
trophy wives at NBA
parties, others want to
marry into the
Kennedy family.
The Stanford
groupie, often indis
tinguishable from
sorority girls, pretty
girls, made-up girls
and rude girls, is one
part of an exotic

equation that makes social relations at
Stanford absolutely odd. Mix her in
with a group of mostly highly-intelli
• gent or well-off kids, plus some high
profile, almost-professional, very
good-looking athletes, and a general
population whose social skills amount
to what they learned watching SNL
every Saturday night at home, and you
find yourself at Stanford.
Somewhere in the equation, the so
cial rules of engagement that would nor
mally govern senior pub nights, campus
parties and chance encounters at the post
-office have frayed at the edges. "Nor
mal" here simply means not being a rude
bitch. Allow me to clarify with a few if
then statements:
IF: Not every female conversing with
Rob Little in public is a groupie,
THEN: Not every female conversing
with Rob Little in public is a groupie.
Novel, I know.
Why is it that a high-profile male
athlete can't have girlfriends that are
just friends? It seems that he can only
have friends if they never speak to
each other in public, or if they speak in
public, then the friend is ugly, or if
she's not ugly, she's missing a limb or
has a glass eye or some other visible
distinction that would assure all the
groupies that she isn't competition.
And even if she's ugly and(italics)
missing an eye, they still must be hav
ing sex.
Female becomes synonymous
with groupie.
Granted, not every "just friendship"
with a high-profile athlete is so innocent.
Need I mention the long-rumored Tony
Azevedo harem? The distinction be
tween female friend and groupie blurs,
because there are also groupie-friends,
and friends with benefits, and friends
who would like to be personal groupies
and so forth.
I digress.
1F: you consider someone your friend,
THEN: Blowing her off in public is
not a friendly way to show it.
This is for the high-profile athletes out
there. You guys should be used to
groupies enough to execute smooth con
versation transitions, but you don't, and
suddenly your friend-who-is-a-girl has
faded into the sad distance. Or did you
not notice? The friend has suddenly be
come a groupie.
Wait, unless there are no girl friends
of-athletes ... does that make me a
groupie by default? But I thought we had
a personal connection, Rob!
The only functional athlete-friend
who-is-a-girl relationship seems to exist
away from the public eye, forcing the
"friend" to act casual like she barely
knows the guy in public outings — and so
she ironically ends up feeling like the
cheap hookup that she isn't.
The friend becomes the groupie
without ever hooking up, winds up lick
ing her self-proclaimed non-groupie
wounds and writes a column exposing
her quasi-shame to a bewildered audi
ence to melodramatize an otherwise
+>oring night out.
This meandering briefing on
groupies and high-profile athletes
could not be complete without men
tioning the Ques, known to many as the
chiseled, loud, black men in purple
dyed jock straps at Exotic Erotic. Also
known as Omega Psi Phi, the histori
cally black fraternity (at Stanford, any
way) draws its members from the foot
ball team. Anyone who can make pur
ple jockstraps, gold spray-painted
boots and purple collars look good de
serves a few good friends ... or
groupies... or whatever.

Take a kx)k at my picture. Yes,
the same one that's been there
for the hist 28 weeks. Now, the
next time you see me talking to
an athlete, or more specifically, a male
athlete, or better yet, a 6-foot-10 black
basketball center named Rob Little, re
call that 1 told you to remember my face
and chill the fuck out.
Maybe it's part of Stanford's great di
versity: We have chemical engineers, fu
ture Hollywood directors, Fulbright
scholars, the nation's best water polo
player, a professional hacker and a hand
ful of aspiring groupies.
Yes, groupies. I know, outdated
term, but still slightly more acceptable
than "hoes." Stanford is home to a small
population of aspiring rich house-wives,
if you can believe it. It's really a matter of

taste — some
groupies want to be
trophy wives at NBA
parties, others want to
marry into the
Kennedy family.
The Stanford
groupie, often indis
tinguishable from
sorority girls, pretty
girls, made-up girls
and rude girls, is one
part of an exotic

equation that makes social relations at
Stanford absolutely odd. Mix her in
with a group of mostly highly-intelli
• gent or well-off kids, plus some high
profile, almost-professional, very
good-looking athletes, and a general
population whose social skills amount
to what they learned watching SNL
every Saturday night at home, and you
find yourself at Stanford.
Somewhere in the equation, the so
cial rules of engagement that would nor
mally govern senior pub nights, campus
parties and chance encounters at the post
-office have frayed at the edges. "Nor
mal" here simply means not being a rude
bitch. Allow me to clarify with a few if
then statements:
IF: Not every female conversing with
Rob Little in public is a groupie,
THEN: Not every female conversing
with Rob Little in public is a groupie.
Novel, I know.
Why is it that a high-profile male
athlete can't have girlfriends that are
just friends? It seems that he can only
have friends if they never speak to
each other in public, or if they speak in
public, then the friend is ugly, or if
she's not ugly, she's missing a limb or
has a glass eye or some other visible
distinction that would assure all the
groupies that she isn't competition.
And even if she's ugly and(italics)
missing an eye, they still must be hav
ing sex.
Female becomes synonymous
with groupie.
Granted, not every "just friendship"
with a high-profile athlete is so innocent.
Need I mention the long-rumored Tony
Azevedo harem? The distinction be
tween female friend and groupie blurs,
because there are also groupie-friends,
and friends with benefits, and friends
who would like to be personal groupies
and so forth.
I digress.
1F: you consider someone your friend,
THEN: Blowing her off in public is
not a friendly way to show it.
This is for the high-profile athletes out
there. You guys should be used to
groupies enough to execute smooth con
versation transitions, but you don't, and
suddenly your friend-who-is-a-girl has
faded into the sad distance. Or did you
not notice? The friend has suddenly be
come a groupie.
