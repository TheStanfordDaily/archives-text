# Prison experiment connected to torture in Iraq

### JENNIFER MARTINEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Psychology professor Phillip Zimbardo's infamous 1971 prison
experiment has been gaining major media attention recently thanks
to the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. Policy-makers and psychologists
are applying the results of Zimbardo's experiment to discover how
coalition troops perpetrated such brutality in Iraqi prisons.
'i was disgusted by [the Abu Ghraib photos], but 1 guess 1 wasn't
surprised because of the Stanford prison experiment and what we
know," said sociology lecturer Kathy Kuipers.
In the experiment, Zimbardo divided a sample of twenty-four college
students to play the roles of prison guards and prisoners. The planned
two-week experiment ended in six days, called off by Zimbardo because
of the escalating abuse of prison guards towards the prisoners.
When the prisoners first entered the "Stanford County Jail." a board
ed up corridor in the basement of the Psychology Department building,
they were stripped naked and checked for lice and germs. They were
each given a dress with an ID number imprinted on it, a female nylon
stocking to cover their hair, and a bolted chain on their right foot. The
chain's purpose was to serve as a reminder to the prisoners of oppres
sion, and the ID number was to give anonymity to the prisoners.
Prison guards were given a khaki uniform to wear and mirrored
sunglasses. The prisoners were unable to see the eyes or the emo
tions of the guards through the sunglasses. Prison guards were given
no formal training about their role, free to set their own limits about
how to keep the prisoners in control and command respect.
At the beginning of the experiment, guards punished prisoners by
forcing them to do push-ups, often sticking their foot on the backs of
the prisoners during the drill. Merely days later, the punishments
grew more severe. Prisoners were forced to forfeit their clothing,
many had to clean the bathroom toilets with their bare hands; bags
were placed over their faces during trips to the bathroom; and pris
oners had to use pails as toilets during some days.
As a result of the treatment, many of the prisoners exhibited emotional
distress. Some refused to eat, others cried uncontrollably, and many
claimed to be feeling sick. After the experiment was terminated. Zimbar
do acknowledged the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde effect prison guards undergo.
Sociology professor Cecilia Ridgeway noticed the parallels be
tween the experiment and the abuse of the Iraqi prisoners. One of
the main similarities she noticed was
the element of distance between the
prison guard and the prisoner. At
Stanford, the mirrored sunglasses the
prison guards wore created distance
from the prisoners, she said. In Iraq,
Ridgeway argued, there were "cultur
al divides and anger to distance the
soldiers from the prisoners."
"It's not a matter of bad apples, it's
of matter of the structure of the situa
tion," Ridgeway said.

She also observed that the soldiers in
Iraq, like the Stanford prison guards, were
not given proper training for the situation.
"The behaviors are very pre
dictable," she said. "(The soldiers]
have this amount of power over the
other [Iraqi prisoners]. They're scared
about controlling the other and they
have all this power."
Kuipers agreed with Ridgeway
