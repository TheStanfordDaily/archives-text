# Card ousts Utah in Regional
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After finishing second in
the Pacific-10 Conference,
the best league finish in the
history of the program, the
No. 7 Cardinal Softball team
(44-16) earned the distinction
of hosting the NCAA Region
7 tournament at Boyd and Jill
Smith Family Stadium.
Stanford's NCAA Region
al, one of eight in the nation, is
just one step away from the
Women's Collegiate World
Series in Oklahoma City. As
the No. 1 seed, the Cardinal
could earn a trip to the WCWS
with four victories over lower
ranked teams on its home
field, beginning with a Thurs
day night matchup against the
unranked and eighth-seeded
Utah Utes (23-32).
The Cardinal took its first
step towards the Women's
Collegiate World Series on
Thursday by dispatching the
Utes by a score of 1-0 in a
pitcher's duel between Stan
ford's ace Dana "Lightning
D" Sorensen and Utah's Bri
an n a Gourdin. Both pitchers
hurled complete games and
the teams combined for just
eight hits. Sorensen was espe
cially impressive, firing fast
balls past Ute hitters all night
long en route to 14 strikeouts
over seven shutout innings.

"Lightning D" allowed only
three hits and one walk and
earned her 29th victory of the
year.
Both pitchers had no-hit
ters going into the fourth in
ning before Cardinal short
stop Lauren Lappin stroked a
leadoff double to left field.
The next Cardinal batter, se
nior catcher Jessica Allister,
walked to set up runners on
first and second with no outs.
After junior first baseman
Leah Nelson flied out, junior
third baseman Liz Bendig
stepped to the plate with
Lappin on second. Shook on
first, and one out. Bendig,
who recently had a seven
game hitting streak and has
keyed a recent offensive
resurgence at the bottom of
the Cardinal batting order,
promptly looped a single to
right field to score Lappin
and give the Cardinal a 1-0
lead over the Utes.
With Sorensen pitching like
an All-American, the Cardinal
was able to make this tiny lead
hold up for the remainder of
the game and head into Friday
in the winner's bracket.
The Cardinal next face No.
4 seed University of the Pacif
ic (35-21), winner of its first
round game over fifth seed
Southern Mississippi (32-24),
1-0, in ten innings. Stanford
has already defeated Pacific

once this season, in February
at the Stanford Invitational.
The Cardinal will rely on the
pitching of Sorensen and also
hope fora little more offense
in tomorrow's 3 p.m. game at
Smith Family Stadium.
In other Regional action
at Smith Family Stadium
Thursday, third seed Fresno
State (47-18) was upset by
sixth seed Southern Illinois
(43-15). Southern Illinois
handed the Cardinal its first
loss in last year's regional in
Alabama, so this upset could
conceivably set up a rematch
between Stanford and South
ern Illinois on Saturday af
ternoon.
In Thursday's other first
round game, seventh seed
Hofstra (34-19) pulled a major
upset over second-seeded
Auburn (42-15) to advance to
a Saturday matchup versus
Southern Illinois. If the Cardi
nal can get past Pacific on Fri
day afternoon, it will face the
winner of Hofstra-Southern
Illinois Saturday at 1 p.m. at
Smith Family Stadium.
The Regional final, the
winner of which will advance
to the WCWS next weekend,
will take place on Sunday af
ternoon. Because the NCAA
Regional is double-elimina
tion, the final game could
occur at either 1 p.m. or 3:30
p.m. on Sunday.
