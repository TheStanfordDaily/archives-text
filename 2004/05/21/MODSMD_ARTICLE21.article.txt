# No. 1 Stanford set to face Trojans
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
There's a good reason the Stanford base
ball team (40-10, 12-6 Pacific-10 Conference)
is ranked No. 1 in the nation — and it's not just
because the latest poll came out hours before
the Cardinal's 11-2 loss at Arizona on Mon
day. While the bullpen struggled and the of
fense vanished at times as Stanford dropped
its second consecutive series last weekend, the
Cardinal has done plenty of things right this
season, winning 80 percent of the times it steps
onto the field.
"If you had told me in January that we'd be
40-10, I'd take that in a heartbeat," head coach
Mark Marquess said. "If you put it in perspec
tive, it's been an amazing season so far. The last
game at Washington and the last game at Ari
zona were the only two games that we really
haven't had a chance to win."
But the last game at Washington — a 9-2
defeat — and the last game at Arizona — an
11-2 setback on the heels of an emotionally
and physically draining 19-18 loss — are cur
rently the salient predictors of the team's fu
ture success (or lack thereof) in most critics'
minds.
Of particular concern is the bullpen, which
dominated opposing hitters in the first half of
the season before faltering lately, and finding a
reliable third starter.
"All of the freshman have pitched great at
times," Marquess said. "[Mark] Romanczuk has
been consistent for us, [Jeff] Gilmore has really
been a pleasant surprise and [David] O'Hagan
has been phenomenal. We've been very fortu
nate and I think [pitching coach Tom] Kunis has
done a great job."
Coming off a solid all-around pitching effort
in a 3-1 victory over San Francisco, the Cardi
nal's relief corps looks to return to its early-sea
son form in this weekend's pivotal series against

Southern California (22-28,8-10) at Sunken Di
amond. Stanford trails No. 14 Washington by a
half-game in the Pac-10 standings.
The Cardinal took two-of-three from the
Trojans when the once-bitter rivals met in early
March as part of a non-conference series at
Dedeaux Field in Los Angeles. That series in
cluded a dramatic 8-7,13-inning, comeback win
in a game the Cardinal had trailed by four runs
heading into the ninth.
Freshman righthander lan Kennedy (6-2,
2.71 ERA) will take the mound tonight for
the Trojans. He will be opposed by left
hander Romanczuk (10-1, 3.91), who settled
down after allowing five runs in the first in
ning last Saturday to go another five innings
and pick up the win in Stanford's 11-9 victo
ry over the Wildcats.
Kennedy, who was invited to the 2004 U.S.A.
National Team Trials in June along with USC
catcher Jeff Clement, has struck out 107 in 79 2 /
3 innings pitched this season.
"He's a great arm," said Marquess, who put
Kennedy in the same boat as Washington fresh
man ace Tim Lincecum.
Tonight's matchup has all the makings of a
classic pitcher's duel, although Stanford sopho
more second baseman Jed Lowrie, who leads
the Cardinal with a .412 batting average, 16
home runs and 63 RBIs, might have something
to say about that.
Sophomore righthander Gilmore (8-2, 4.89)
will get the nod on Saturday and will look to re
bound from his last outing, in which he allowed
seven runs on 10 hits in just three innings of
work. Marquess, as usual, has not named a Sun
day starter.
During its two-week skid, the Cardinal has
also missed the services of an experienced cog in
the Stanford lineup.
"Not having Jonny Ash hurts us because he's

a spark plug for us," Marquess said.
"I think maybe we'll get him back
this week or next week for sure."
The Cardinal was 30-5 and aver
aging 9.06 runs per game when the
senior third baseman was injured on
April 20 against Saint Mary's. In 15
games since that time, the Cardinal
is averaging exactly one less run per
game and is 10-5.
Ash took groundballs before
Tuesday's game and did some hit
ting while the rest of the team had
the day off on Wednesday, accord
ing to Marquess.
His much-anticipated return to
the lineup is just part of the positive
momentum the Cardinal hopes to
establish over the final six games of
the season.

"You don't have to win them all,
but I'm looking for us to play good
baseball," Marquess said. "The main
thing we have to do with our guys is
to just make sure we continue to
work hard."
After all, good baseball —in-
cluding a .975 fielding percentage —
and hard work are how the Cardinal
built such an impressive record thus
far. And look no further than No. 2
Texas to see that every team is sus
ceptible to a regular season hiccup.
The Longhorns lost three straight
games last month and were recently
swept — and shutout — in a double
header at home against North Car
olina State.
While he hasn't let the past two
weeks undermine his team's ac
complishments, the Cardinal's ulti
mate goal is not lost on Marquess.
"All in all it's been a great season
so far, but everybody knows we want
to do well at the end," he said.
