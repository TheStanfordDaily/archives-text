# Severson's energy sparks softball squad

### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Head over to the softball stadium on game
days and you will invariably find Laura Sever
son somewhere in the action. Whether she is on
the mound shutting down the opposition or in
the dugout leading team cheers. Severson has a
way of making her presence known.
In fact, if you ask Severson's teammates
what she adds to the Cardinal squad, they are
quick to make reference to her motivating
personality. With a Chicago accent that res
onates throughout the dugout, Severson can
be heard leading pre-game cheers and inspir
ing her teammates with her personalized
chants and songs.
"She has personalized cheers for players on
our team that are basically variations on popu
lar songs, such as 'Shot Through the Heart' for
Jackie Rinehart," said fellow hurler Dana
Sorenson. "She has the ability to get this team
motivated whether she is pitching or not, and
not very many people have that kind of ability."
This year, however, the 5-foot-8 sopho

more from Frankfort, 111., is making noise with
more than just her accent and cheers. With a
13-7 record and a 2.04 ERA, Severson has de
veloped into one of the team's top pitchers in
just her second full season on the Farm. She
has generated 110 strikeouts in 134 innings of
work and has closed out 11 of the 21 games she
has started.
"I feel like this year I have more command of
my pitches and know what works in certain sit
uations, whereas last year I had nothing to
lose," Severson said.
With former Cardinal veterans Tori Nyberg
and Maureen LeCocq and then-junior Dana
Sorenson leading the Cardinal pitching staff last
season, Severson saw only minimal pitching
time, turning in a 5-3 record and a 5.01 ERA in
nine starts. With Nyberg and LeCocq now out
of the picture, Severson has seen plenty more
action on the mound this season both as a
starter and a closer.
Despite the pressure of increased playing
time, Severson has slid into her new role quite
easily. With the numbers she has posted thus
far. Severson hardly resembles the pitcher she

was last year.
"Her mental approach and her confidence
have improved from last year," head coach
John Rittman said. "When she relaxes, trusts
her pitches and gets ahead in the count, she can
beat anyone in the country."
Like most second-year players, Severson
cites experience as being the leading factor in
this year's improvement.
She spent the past summer playing with the
Orland Park Sparks, a women's club team in
Illinois. Pitching against other Division I soft
ball athletes from around the country gave
Severson the opportunity to hone her skills
and develop the confidence needed for the
regular season.
"All the tournaments we played in [last sum
mer] had great competition," Severson said. "It
was good to get innings on the mound because
I was able to improve and see a lot of the batters
that I saw in the college season."
Severson's array of pitches includes a rise
ball, changeup and screwball. According to
Severson though, her favorite pitch is the
drop ball.

Just recently, the sophomore hurler also
brought back her curve ball, a pitch she did not
throw at all last season.
"It has given me another option on the out
side part of the plate to righties," said Severson
of her newly-revived curve. "I like throwing all
of my pitches to keep batters off balance."
In Severson's opinion, the Cardinal's best
performance came the April weekend that the
team swept both UCLA and Washington on
the road. Severson played a huge role that
weekend, earning the win in the Cardinal's 12-9
Saturday victory over Washington. She pitched
62/3 innings, recording four strikeouts and al
lowing three earned runs.
Despite her individual success, Severson's
focus is on the team and its road to the College
World Series. According to Severson, the
team's success has been a collective effort with
individual players stepping up at the right time.
We have had some amazing wins this year,
and with each person that steps up, it carries
over to the next person," Severson said. "All
we can do is play our game and take it one day
at a time."
