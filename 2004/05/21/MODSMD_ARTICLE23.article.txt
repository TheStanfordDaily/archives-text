# Carter overcomes the odds
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Chris Carter s ride at Stanford has been nothing
short of bumpy.
Battling personal loss, difficult adjustments to the
college game and, most of all, a debilitating shoulder
injury, the junior designated hitter has sure seen his
fair share of adversity.
But with everything seemingly falling into place
recently. Carter seems primed and ready for anoth
er breakout postseason for the Cardinal.
Carter is hitting .420 in Pac-10 play with five
home runs and 18 RBIs. He had his second career
multi-home run game on Sunday at Arizona and
then had his first career four-hit game the next day.
'i feel very comfortable at the plate," Carter
said. "Its the first time I've been comfortable in
a long time.
"I m getting used to how they're pitching me —
they're trying to keep me off-balance by throwing
off-speed on the outside part of the plate," he con
tinued. "I'm being more patient, and when I'm get
ting my chance, I'm swinging hard and trying to put
it over the fence or in the gap."
Carter has upped his average to .301 after it hov
ered below .200 for much of the first half of the season.
As a result, he's become the team's everyday
DH, having finally fought off competition from
freshmen Ryan Seawell and Jim Rapoport.
But these numbers don't even begin to tell his
whole story.
To really understand everything Carter's been
through, you've got to begin with his stellar fresh
man year — and all the lows that followed.
Carter came to Stanford from De La Salle — the
same school that boasts a football team with a na
tional-record winning streak — as a highly touted
high school prospect. He was ranked as high as No. 8
in Baseball America's top-100 list.
He showed that promise immediately in limited
action, hitting .299 with eight home runs and 20 RBIs
in only 107 at-bats. He led the team in hitting in the
postseason with a .375 average and finished the year
on an 11 -game hitting streak.
For his efforts, he was named the team's most
valuable freshman and seemed equipped for an even
greater sophomore season.
But as the summer wore on, he realized that his
left shoulder kept popping out of place — estimated
at once a week — and that this problem was starting
to become a nagging one. Carter believes he first
triggered the dislocation while sliding head-first mid
way through his freshman year.
When he went to see doctors, they told him
the subluxations, or continual partial disloca
tions, were causing ligaments to be over
stretched in his shoulder.
By the end of the year. Carter couldn't even
reach fora groundball or follow through his
swing with a full extension without the shoulder
coming out of its socket.
"When I couldn't do the easy things, I knew I had
to have surgery," Carter said. "There were no other
options. I knew that if I wanted to play baseball be
yond college, I had to have [the procedure] done."
So in November 2002, Carter had corrective
surgery on the shoulder. It took him six months to

swing a bat again and nearly a year to get used to his
new shoulder.
He worked tirelessly with Stanford trainers
Tomoo Yamada and Moira Jamati to build
back up his shoulder strength. He first did sim
ple up-and-down exercises and then moved to
the rotator cuff, obliques and other muscles
around it.
Carter also worked everyday 6:30-8 a.m. with the
team's strength coach, Greg Johnson, to get his
whole body back into shape.
"I don't know if I'd still be playing if it weren't for
those three people," Carter said.
Tragically, Johnson was involved in a fatal car ac-

cident in March of last year — right in the middle of
Carter's rehab program.
It's safe to say that Carter didn't take the
news lightly.
"Greg was one of the best people I've ever
known," he said. "That was a really rough time
for me."
Carter finally returned to the diamond that April
after missing the first two months of the seasonn, but
struggled mightily. He was just 2-for-23 (.087) in his
first seven games, and it seemed like Carter's whole
mental game was out of whack.
"I think I forgot how hard baseball is when I
was out," he said. "Timing is such a crucial part of
the game, and it just wasn't there. I wasn't hitting
and the pressure started building. I was trying to
stay in the lineup, but it's hard to play when you're
not relaxed."
Carter never seemed to get into a groove during

the regular season, only hitting .241, but he had sev
eral clutch hits in the postseason as the Cardinal
reached the championship game of the College
World Series for the third time in five years.
Now, Chris Carter is finally healthy for the first
time in three years, and he couldn't be happier about
it — especially with the major leagues looming large
in his future.
The same scouts that watched Carter during high
school have kept a close watch on him while he's
been at Stanford. With his body build and power po
tential, Carter could be a high draft pick, but the fact
that he hasn't played a position in the field at all in
college will surely hurt his draft status. Carter would

probably be a corner outfielder or first baseman in
the pros, some scouts say.
Carter has had his eye on the majors fora while
now, but he continues to weigh his options.
"I've enjoyed my time at Stanford, but we'll see
what happens," he said. "I love baseball and I want
it to be a big part of my life in the future."
He's been pretty stubborn about adjusting his
swing at Stanford — Carter swings the bat so hard
you'd think he's playing tennis or hockey — and he
knows professional pitchers might be able to take
advantage of his long, aggressive swing.
"Sometimes I lose my balance, so I need to have
good technique," he said. "It's my strength and my
weakness — but it's the one thing that allows me to
succeed when I'm on."
Carter has sure been on lately. And he'd be the
first to tell you that he hopes the good times keep
on coming.

"I've enjoyed my time at Stanford, but we'll see
what happens," he said. "I love baseball and I want
it to be a big part of my life in the future."
He's been pretty stubborn about adjusting his
swing at Stanford — Carter swings the bat so hard
you'd think he's playing tennis or hockey — and he
knows professional pitchers might be able to take
advantage of his long, aggressive swing.
"Sometimes I lose my balance, so I need to have
good technique," he said. "It's my strength and my
weakness — but it's the one thing that allows me to
succeed when I'm on."
Carter has sure been on lately. And he'd be the
first to tell you that he hopes the good times keep
on coming.

Junior Chris Carter's agressive swing has led him to a .301 average and has also secured him
a spot as the Cardinal's DH after the position was in flux for the first half of the season.
Chris Carter s ride at Stanford has been nothing
short of bumpy.
Battling personal loss, difficult adjustments to the
college game and, most of all, a debilitating shoulder
injury, the junior designated hitter has sure seen his
fair share of adversity.
But with everything seemingly falling into place
recently. Carter seems primed and ready for anoth
er breakout postseason for the Cardinal.
Carter is hitting .420 in Pac-10 play with five
home runs and 18 RBIs. He had his second career
multi-home run game on Sunday at Arizona and
then had his first career four-hit game the next day.
'i feel very comfortable at the plate," Carter
said. "Its the first time I've been comfortable in
a long time.
"I m getting used to how they're pitching me —
they're trying to keep me off-balance by throwing
off-speed on the outside part of the plate," he con
tinued. "I'm being more patient, and when I'm get
ting my chance, I'm swinging hard and trying to put
it over the fence or in the gap."
Carter has upped his average to .301 after it hov
ered below .200 for much of the first half of the season.
As a result, he's become the team's everyday
DH, having finally fought off competition from
freshmen Ryan Seawell and Jim Rapoport.
But these numbers don't even begin to tell his
whole story.
To really understand everything Carter's been
through, you've got to begin with his stellar fresh
man year — and all the lows that followed.
Carter came to Stanford from De La Salle — the
same school that boasts a football team with a na
tional-record winning streak — as a highly touted
high school prospect. He was ranked as high as No. 8
in Baseball America's top-100 list.
He showed that promise immediately in limited
action, hitting .299 with eight home runs and 20 RBIs
in only 107 at-bats. He led the team in hitting in the
postseason with a .375 average and finished the year
on an 11 -game hitting streak.
For his efforts, he was named the team's most
valuable freshman and seemed equipped for an even
greater sophomore season.
But as the summer wore on, he realized that his
left shoulder kept popping out of place — estimated
at once a week — and that this problem was starting
to become a nagging one. Carter believes he first
triggered the dislocation while sliding head-first mid
way through his freshman year.
When he went to see doctors, they told him
the subluxations, or continual partial disloca
tions, were causing ligaments to be over
stretched in his shoulder.
By the end of the year. Carter couldn't even
reach fora groundball or follow through his
swing with a full extension without the shoulder
coming out of its socket.
"When I couldn't do the easy things, I knew I had
to have surgery," Carter said. "There were no other
options. I knew that if I wanted to play baseball be
yond college, I had to have [the procedure] done."
So in November 2002, Carter had corrective
surgery on the shoulder. It took him six months to

swing a bat again and nearly a year to get used to his
new shoulder.
He worked tirelessly with Stanford trainers
Tomoo Yamada and Moira Jamati to build
back up his shoulder strength. He first did sim
ple up-and-down exercises and then moved to
the rotator cuff, obliques and other muscles
around it.
Carter also worked everyday 6:30-8 a.m. with the
team's strength coach, Greg Johnson, to get his
whole body back into shape.
"I don't know if I'd still be playing if it weren't for
those three people," Carter said.
Tragically, Johnson was involved in a fatal car ac-

cident in March of last year — right in the middle of
Carter's rehab program.
It's safe to say that Carter didn't take the
news lightly.
"Greg was one of the best people I've ever
known," he said. "That was a really rough time
for me."
Carter finally returned to the diamond that April
after missing the first two months of the seasonn, but
struggled mightily. He was just 2-for-23 (.087) in his
first seven games, and it seemed like Carter's whole
mental game was out of whack.
"I think I forgot how hard baseball is when I
was out," he said. "Timing is such a crucial part of
the game, and it just wasn't there. I wasn't hitting
and the pressure started building. I was trying to
stay in the lineup, but it's hard to play when you're
not relaxed."
Carter never seemed to get into a groove during

the regular season, only hitting .241, but he had sev
eral clutch hits in the postseason as the Cardinal
reached the championship game of the College
World Series for the third time in five years.
Now, Chris Carter is finally healthy for the first
time in three years, and he couldn't be happier about
it — especially with the major leagues looming large
in his future.
The same scouts that watched Carter during high
school have kept a close watch on him while he's
been at Stanford. With his body build and power po
tential, Carter could be a high draft pick, but the fact
that he hasn't played a position in the field at all in
college will surely hurt his draft status. Carter would

probably be a corner outfielder or first baseman in
the pros, some scouts say.
