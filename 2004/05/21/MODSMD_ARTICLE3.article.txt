# I'm feeling lucky: Stanford set to reap millions from Google IPO
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Google's upcoming IPO may turn out to be the
largest windfall ever for the University's technology
transfer program. Stanford owns a stake of equity in the
company that could be worth up to hundreds of millions
of dollars.
The company filed fora $2.7 billion initial public offering
late last month, but a date for the offering has not been set.
In a separate development. University President John
Hennessy took a position on the board of Google in late
April, as one of three company outsiders that Google
added to its corporate board before its IPO. Hennessy
was granted 65.000 shares of stock when he joined the
board. These shares could potentially be worth millions
of dollars, depending on the eventual stock value.
Hennessy took the position—his third corporate
board membership—based on his experience with Sili
con Valley and technology companies, Stanford
spokesperson Gordon Earle said. Hennessy cofounded
MIPS Computer Systems in 1984, and he now also serves
on the boards of Cisco Systems and Atheros Communi
cations. Earle added that Hennessy would remove him
self from any dealings that connect Google and Stanford.
Stanford graduate students Larry Page and Sergey
Brin founded Google in September 1998 using technolo
gy they developed while researching in the Computer
Science department. Since it was developed at Stanford,
the University owns this Pageßank technology— the ini
tial innovation that made Google such a successful

search engine— and licenses it to the company.
Starting in 1996, Page and Brin tried to sell their technol
ogy toother companies with encouragement from the Office
of Technology Licensing (OTL), which handles all inven
tions at Stanford. A number of companies, including
Yahoo!, showed interest, but "none of the offers equaled
Google's potential and no companies looked to be its ideal
developers," according to a 2000 OTL newsletter. After un
successful sales pitches, and with the encouragement of
Stanford, the founders decided to try to start their own com
pany. As is typical with small companies that cannot afford
large cash licenses, Stanford took a stake in the company as
part of the original licensing deal.
Google began on the front porch of Computer Science
Prof. David Cheriton's house when Andy Bechtolsheim,
one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, wrote a $ 100,000
check —before Google even had a bank account.
Cheriton is the only Stanford professor listed in the
IPO filing as an early stockholder, and he stands to prof
it when the IPO is eventually offered. In an e-mail, he
said that this wouldn't change what he was doing.
"I hope to continue teaching, research and advising stu
dents, same as I have been doing for the past 25 years," he said.
The University has not said what it plans to do with its
equity stake, either.
"We're not inclined to count chickens before they're
hatched," said Arthur Bienenstock, vice provost and dean of
research, who would be in charge of revenues from equity.
The University declines to publicly release how much
its stake is worth or what it will do with the eventual rev
enue, though the details may become public in an

amendment to the company's IPO filing that must be
released by the end of June.
Craig Zolan, the CEO of Techcense, a company that
gives advice about technology transfer, told the San Francis
co Chronicle that Stanford probably has between a one and
five percent stake in Google, based on industry precedents.
Some analysts expect the company to gain a $25
billion market-value. A one-percent stake would then
be worth $150 million.
Stanford does not own more than five percent of
the company, according to the IPO filing — only the
founders and two Silicon Valley venture capital
firms — Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield
& Byers, control that much of Google.
The University made $43.2 million in income from
licensed technology last year, but most of that money
came from cash royalties. After 15 percent was de
ducted for OTL funding, a third of these royalties
were distributed to inventors, a third went to depart
ments and the last third went to the schools where the
inventions originated.
Google's annual cash royalties go to the School of En
gineering and the Computer Science Department, but any
equity the University has in stock would go to a special fel
lowship fund administered by the dean of research.
And any revenues would appear quickly. According
to the 2003 OTL annual report, the Stanford Manage
ment Company sells these public equities as soon as
Stanford is allowed to liquidate, due to conflict-of-inter-
