# TAM VO AND & CHARLIE STOCKMAN
## INTERMISSION EDITOR / ASSU SPECIAL ELECTION LOSER & 1ST RUNNER UP 
### 
I woke up late for class as usual
on Monday. However, something
was different. The smell of chick
en sandwiches filled the air, rain
was threatening... and a moun
tain lion was about to martyred.
News about the slain mountain
lion spread quickly around cam
pus. Some asked us, "Aren't you
relieved your main competition
for ASSU executive has been
eliminated?" while others shot me
(no pun intended) sympathetic,
knowing how I had campaigned
harder for write-in cadidates Kir
chofer-Mountain Lion than 1 had
for my own BS-TV campaign. My
heart felt heavy all day.
News sources reported contra
dictory accounts of the shooting

Sources stated the feline as sleeping
peacefully before his demise. Others
portrayed it as a potential baby
eater. Was the mountain lion really
just a giant pussy scared up into a
tree by a tiny dog?
Monday's events only hinted at
the turmoil that would rock Stan
ford's campus in following days. Not
only had the ASSU lost its legitima
cy (again) Joe Kirchofer had lost his
loyal running mate. PETA declared
its war on the local police force.
Montgomery announced his deci
sion to leave The Farm for the
NBA. Mass hysteria swept the
sophomore (and undeclared junior)
class as Dean Bravman's photo
graph appeared no fewer than 69
times with various overachievers in
The Daily, accompanied by the
veiled threat: "We declared! Have
you?" One thing was clear: The
Apocalypse was near.
It's odd that the elections com
mittee decided to reveal the winners

of the election so promptly after the
biggest threat to Chioke-Kory was
taken down by the po-pos? Did it
occur to anyone that slow, elderly
drivers may be a greater threat to so
ciety than a mountain lion on the
loose? I decided to leave the comfort
of my sterile Intermission cubicle
and find out.
"The death of the mountain lion
is an unmitigated tragedy. In the
words of NWA, Tuck the police!'"
interim Daily Editor-in-Chief
David Herbert exclaimed.
"Oh, they're cops. They just
wanted to shoot something," junior
Mark Thoma commented. "No one
was shot at Exotic Erotic, the po
couldn't wait for the chance to pull
their nines."
Marveling at how he never re
ally appreciates anyone until
they're gone, former Intermission
editor Chris Lee wistfully re
marked, "I wished we'd had more
time together."
Shortly before his murder. Inter
mission was able to procure a few
words with the infamous feline.
"Mountain Lion doesn't care for
petty politics. Mountain Lion gets
things done. The ASSU has grown
fat and weak due to the overabun
dance of resume-plumping posi
tions. Mountain Lion run fast. The
end will be swift and bloody, and
when the dust finally settles, there
will be only one."
The courage and irony of these
last sentiments epitomize the life of
a truly great cat. So talented, he was
doomed to banishment by man's
fear of the unknown. Yet even
amongst hate and oppression, he
never ceased in his noble quest fora
society where man and mountain
lion can walk hand in paw. Alas,
some giant cats are just too beautiful
for this world.
May Mountain Lion run fast, in a
heaven where many horses roam.
