# Torture at Abu Ghraib
## The
						shots seen 'round the world 
### JENNIE KIM CITIZEN 
One could argue that the Baudrillar
dian concept of hyperreality reached its
peak during the first Gulf War — often
derided as the media's videogame
graphic war — when CNN cut to broad
cast a "live update" of the action in Iraq,
only to find soldiers huddled around the
TV set watching CNN themselves. If
that's the case, then the Gulf War Ver
sion 2.0 has played itself out on a com
pletely recalibrated media scale.
Conventional postmodern wisdom
says the crisis of the real is now behind us:
facts collapsed, leaving images exultant,
but our recognition doesn't necessarily
lessen the influence. If anything, the con
tinuing furor over the grisly Abu Ghraib
prison photos further proves to us the
awesome power of images, particularly

in times of war. In a stunning assertion,
the image has held the event hostage,
gaining iconic currency that, even when
held in strict context, speaks best in a lan
guage of symbols, of associations, tied to
promises of infinite reproduction.
It is impossible to overstate the signif
icance of the photos, many of which have
already been seared into our psyches, or
the effect their transmission will have on
the world community. A pooled sense of
formless anxiety assures us that yes in
deed, this is a big fucking deal.
To their credit, the major players in the
news media have not failed to recognize it
as such. Delivering the first blow on April
28, CBS's "60 Minutes 2" ushered in a
somber reprieve from the type of reality
TV that seeks extremes; reminding us yet
again that the truth is stranger and sadder
than the most realistic fiction.
