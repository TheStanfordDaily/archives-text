# The 						Daily Show: Jon Stewart, patriot

### 
With world outcry growing to a crescendo of disgust, President Bush
stepped boldly before the cameras of two Arab-language TV stations to
tell Middle-Eastern viewers he shared their revulsion.

Bush began with a lesson in Western-style civics, saying, "It's important
for people to understand that in a democracy there will be a full investi
gation. We want to know the truth. In our country, when there's an alle
gation of abuse — more than an allegation in this case, we saw the pic
tures — there will be a full investigation and justice will be delivered." In
other words: Iraq, "You're welcome." In Saddam's day, this kind of hell
ish torture went totally un-reprimanded, but a new day is dawning.

The unprecedented interviews
were a dramatic sign of just how
damaging the prison scandal has
been to America's image in the
Middle East. Still, in both his inter
views, Bush stopped short of "apol
ogizing," since he's saving that for
something "really" bad, like canni
balism.
