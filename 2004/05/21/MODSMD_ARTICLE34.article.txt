You see torture, Rush sees Iraqi Britney. OxyContin
has some crazy side effects.
Folks, these torture pictures with the women torturers, I
mean Man> Albert looking at those pictures would say,
"Hey, that doesn't look so bad." You know, if you real
ly look at these pictures, I mean I don t know if it's just
me but it looks like anything you'd see Madonna or
Britney Spears do on stage.
Um, what kind of fucked-up fraternity were you in —
Sigma Alpha Assplay?
CALLER: It was like a college fraternity prank that
stack up naked men —
UMBAUGH: Exactly. Exactly my point! This is no
different than what happens at the Skull and Bones ini
tiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it, and
we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we
are going to really hammer them because they had a
good time... I'm talking about people having a good
time, these people, you ever heard of emotional release?
You heard of need to blow some steam off?

Rumsfeld clears up the legalese:
"My impression is that what has been charged thus far Li abuse,
which 1 believe technically is different from torture."
"Ifeel terrible... They're human beings."
From Newsweek:
"Rumsfeld went on the "Today" show to say he didn't have
time to read the long report on Abu Ghraib (what else was so
important?) but that 'anyone who sees the photographs does, in
fact, apologize.' Anyone? Who is 'anyone'?"

Newsweek's "Conventional Wis
dom," commenting on Sy Hersh
after bis expose of the prison scandal
prints in the New Yorker:
"32 years after breaking My Lai, he's
still scooping everyone. If there's a
journalistic equivalent to Viagra, he's
on it"
