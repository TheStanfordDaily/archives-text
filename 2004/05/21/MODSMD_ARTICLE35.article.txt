"9:32" cuts between two presum
ably simultaneous and very different
scenes. In one, a group of well-heeled
young people enjoy a dinner party. In
another, a homeless woman tries to
sleep alone on a bench. A possible
connection comes when inconsider
ate passersby jolt her from sleep. Are
they partygoers themselves? Perhaps
as a result of Guh's subtle treatment
of her material, I wasn't sure.

A young man's night in his car begins
well, with his lover's bra draped over
the steering wheel. However, tragedy
strikes on the drive home, when he
falls asleep at the wheel. The film
then crosses over into the horror
genre, and the titular glove compart
ment becomes important in a way I
never fully understood. Still, "Com
partment" has a couple of decent
scares; it could serve as a cautionary
tale against driving tired.

Dir. Kirk Shimano
This very funny and touching
work follows nervous director Grif
fith through the process of making a
student film. Everything from rain to
unreliable prima donna actors con
spires to ruin Griffith's project, and
he reacts with a combination of de
spair, anger, and self-loathing that
manages to be quite endearing. "G,
H, H" cuts back and forth between
black-and-white footage from Grif
fith's film and the vibrant color of the
real world, a technique that may seem
gimmicky but works surprisingly
well. Continually buoying the film up
are its well-scripted dialogue and the
talents of its principle actors, who
perform far better than their counter
parts in Griffith's disastrous creation.

This would-be noir tells the story
of a hard-boiled detective bent on
finding the criminal who firebombed
his car when he was a teenager. Com
plete with gruff voiceovers and a
compelling lead performance by
actor Dylan Zwick, "La Vengeance"
was by far one of the more entertain
ing films viewed. The earnest acting
and dialogue form an amusing juxta
position with its semi-campy produc
tion qualities — perhaps not all in
tentional amusement, but refreshing
ly direct nonetheless.

Dir. Carol Liu
Set in early turn-of-the-century
Palo Alto, "Mei" is the story of a
Chinese woman's return to Stanford
after graduating and spending time
back in her native country. The pro
duction deserves full kudos for tack
ling a period piece, achieving quite a
feat by steeping the film in what
seems very much like the milieu of
the time — the elaborate sets and
costumes set a new standard for
budget student filmmaking. The
methodical narrative was hampered
by an incomplete soundtrack on the
early cut this reviewer viewed.

This film opens with the assur
ance that no animals were harmed
in its production, a statement the
film instantly calls into question
with a shot of a writhing dove being
pecked by one of its kin. What fol
lows is roughly four minutes of
avian trauma, perhaps intensified by
the efforts of a human to force the
sufferer into a paper cup. All the
while, a voice recites a segment of
the Tao Te Ching at varying levels of
intelligibility. The effect is nothing if
not original, and while 1 can't fully
decode the image of the injured
bird, I can certainly vouch for its
staying power.

For those who lust after but
toned-up businesswomen — and
I've known a few — this film will be
a titillating piece of ultra-soft porn.
For the rest of us, it's a glossy little
satire on office intrigue, in which
successful presentations become se
ductions and professional discretion
means putting on a mask before you
disclose your sexual proclivities. I'd
like to work in the office Chantre
shows us, if only to see what hap
pens after her many coy cutaways.

Dir. Keegan Duchicela
In this animated short, chiseled
men and women roam rather halt
ingly through a similarly chiseled
world. The tragic hero of the tale is
a fugitive from a colorful Utopia
called Cabana Boy Island, now a
pool boy working at the black-and
white mansion of a disaffected
young woman. He tells her of his
home's golden age, during which he
and his Cabana Boy brethren
swilled suntan lotion and practiced
their pelvic thrusts, and the island's
unfortunate decline as the result of a
sex scandal. The voice actors inhab
it their roles well, and the contrast
between the bored yuppie woman
and the effusive ex-Cabana Boy
makes this film amusing to listen to.

This impressive piece of docu
mentary filmmaking explores a
Ukrainian city in which Orthodox
Christians turn to the dwindling
Jewish population for good luck and
help with prayer. Interviews show
us Christians who believe Jewish
prayer is stronger than their own,
and Jews both proud of and be
mused by their special status. While
1 could have wished fora deeper in
vestigation into the lives of specific
Chernivsti Jews, Glaser's broader
approach does allow the viewer to
sample many different takes on life
in the city, as well as several affect
ing personal anecdotes. "Miracles in
Chernivsti" is very ambitious fora
student effort, and for this deserves
high praise.

Probably the festival's only inten
tional horror film, "The Woods
man" delivers remarkably well on
that premise. Shot in a consistently
dark hue and devoid of dialogue
(most of the scenes are in slow mo
tion), it succeeds in creating its own
richly foreboding atmosphere. The
plot centers around a kid who gets
lost in the woods and accidentally
witnesses a man in the act of burying
something. Not exactly complex, but
once you get a glimpse of the woods
man you'll never be the same.

A faux news expose on Ricker Din
ing's peanut-safe environment, this
piece is irresistible because of the dead
pan seriousness of its news correspon
dent — whoever this kid is, he's got that
"Daily Show" delivery down. Through
interviews with students and dining staff,
a comic portrait of the dining hall and its
peanut-obsessive policies emerges.
Ricker is lampooned with tender loving
care, and it shows.

A prospective sperm donor meets a
strange character whose shifting identi
ties have one purpose: to encourage the
genetically fit of the world to pass on
their DNA. His method — convincing
young men to donate lots of sperm —
defuses the potentially disturbing eu
genic implications of this project. The re
sult is a sometimes overwrought but
often funny examination of the potential
social benefits of serial masturbation.

The lives of three different women
are documented as they all prepare for
interviews for the same job. Unfortu
nately, their interviewer turns out to be a
man with less than noble intentions. I
admired the smart pacing and the witty
"National Geographic"-like voiceovers
that accompany the study of each
woman's style; the film's final agenda,
however, has all the subtlety of a late
night fire alarm.

Dir. Ari Olmos
The portrait of a man at a low point in
his life, "You Have to Be" is sometimes
too understated for its own good. Still, it
has its fine moments. Anthony is an al
coholic who has left his lover — possibly
his wife — and now wonders how he can
make a difference in the world. His con
versation with her later reveals he may
have given up on the prospect of happi
ness. I could have wished for more
scenes between Anthony and his ex, but
his memories of her and his final
epiphany are both nicely portrayed.

A young man receives a fortune
cookie fortune telling him that today will
be the luckiest day of his life. Fortune
cookies being the fateful oracles they are
in the movies, he proceeds to experience
several events throughout the day that
make him think otherwise. Well-execut
ed as a whole, the concluding twist seems
a little too pat to give us any real revela
tions.

Bwhijfnhjg Pool
Dir. Carrie Kemper
In a festival of short films,
"Swimming Pool" takes it one step
further and presents itself as a trail
er fora full-length movie of the
same title. The conceit is innovative
— we see snippets of scenes from a
nonexistent film, with the plot out
lined by a typically throaty narrator.
The story involves a young man who
must overcome the adversity of a
dramatic foot injury to achieve his
dream of swimming. With game
performances and a well-planned
structure, its one fault is that it over
runs the standard two-minute trail
er length by a good several minutes
—we automatically feel like it's
longer than it should be.

Dirs. Josh Meisel & lan Slattery
A mockumentary in the style of
Christopher Guest ("This is Spinal
Tap"), this film follows a series of
ushers through their preparation for
a rigorous certification exam called
the UCAT. Included are several
amusing interviews with usher
hopefuls, including go-getter Kate
Dennison, who confides," I have big
dreams." Some segments are more
convincing than others, but overall
Meisel and Slattery have learned
the lessons of Guest well. Their film
is funny because its characters seem
real, their fears and aspirations en
tirely genuine, yet their situation is
completely ridiculous.

The film opens with three losers
receiving instruction from a no-non
sense drill sergeant. This isn't boot
camp, however; it's wingman train
ing. and these schmucks are learning
how to help their friends get laid.
They eventually test their skills at a
party, but the best part of the film
turns out to be preparation, not exe
cution. Cibula's greatest achieve
ment is proving that it's still possible
to do something funny with a blow
up doll.
