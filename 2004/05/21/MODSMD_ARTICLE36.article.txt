# Longer Isn't Always Better
## Anna North braves SFS's shorts 
### ANNA NORTH INTERMISSION STAFF WRITER 
For Lindsay Mecca, co-president of the Stanford Film
Society, it's been a grueling week. The 2004 Student Film
Festival approaches, and "everyone who has been working
hard to make sure it runs smoothly is pretty bleary eyed."
Still. Mecca considers 2004's planning relatively successful.
This year, she says,"I didn't have to hurt anyone."
It's not too hard to imagine festival preparations de
scending to violence. Less than a week before the event,
some directors were still editing their films in Meyer Li
brary. Others had ceased communication, leaving Mecca
and co-president Meredith Narrowe to wonder if they
planned to submit at all.
Amid the uncertainty, there was scheduling to be done.
Narrowe and Mecca had to spread the thirty student films
over three nights, according to preferences listed by the
filmmakers. Some had family coming into town. Others
wanted to attend Senior Formal. Narrowe and Mecca were
left with the task of accommodating their requests, while
still producing three balanced nights of films.
To do that, they had to watch them. On Saturday, May
15,1 joined Mecca, Narrowe, and former president Mark
Ybarra for an afternoon of viewing in the SFS office behind
the Toyon eating clubs. A cut-out of Humphrey Bogart and
a toy lawnmower drenched in what looked like blood
presided over the session.
Mecca's explanation of the lawnmower was a little
vague, leading me to suspect some secret, bloody chapter of
SFS history. Ybarra was more helpful. While the presidents
discussed the order of the films, he gave me a breakdown of
their sources.
Eleven of this year's films come from the Student Film
makers' Workshop (SFW), a group of first-timers who spend
the whole school year learning techniques and producing

their debut films. The Workshop carries no academic cred
it. "That way," Ybarra said, "only people who are truly in
love with filmmaking take it." True love, though, is hard to
find; six Workshop participants dropped out of the festival.
The SFS also sponsors a Film Grant Program, in which
more experienced filmmakers can apply for funding by sub
mitting treatments, budgets and production schedules for
their prospective films. Three of this year's Film Grant re
cipients were graduates of the Advanced Filmmakers'
Workshop, a more rigorous follow-up to the SFW geared
toward those who have already produced a live-action film.
Then there are open submissions. Make a film as a reg
istered student, and you too can enter the Student Film
Festival. Of course, your film will be reviewed by a jury of
SFS members. It must observe certain length limits - typi
cally fifteen minutes or less. And while profanity and "nude
body painting" have gotten by in the past, a film was re
cently axed for pornographic content.
Once you've been accepted, you'll have to fill out per
mission forms for any copyrighted material you use - one di
rector turned in a whole binder full of them. You'll have to
make all your actors sign talent releases. And you'll proba
bly spend hours in the editing room, perhaps going down to
the wire on a sunny Saturday morning to make sure your
final cut gets in on time.
Then again, you could skip all that and just watch the
films, which begins at 7:30 p.m. each night May 20-22. If
even that effort seems too daunting, I and fellow film critic
Chris Lee have provided capsule reviews for the armchair
film buff. Now you can enjoy a taste of the Student Film
Festival from the comforts of your room. Not all the films
were available for preview, however. To see everything,
you'll have to actually leave your dorm.

For Lindsay Mecca, co-president of the Stanford Film
Society, it's been a grueling week. The 2004 Student Film
Festival approaches, and "everyone who has been working
hard to make sure it runs smoothly is pretty bleary eyed."
Still. Mecca considers 2004's planning relatively successful.
This year, she says,"I didn't have to hurt anyone."
It's not too hard to imagine festival preparations de
scending to violence. Less than a week before the event,
some directors were still editing their films in Meyer Li
brary. Others had ceased communication, leaving Mecca
and co-president Meredith Narrowe to wonder if they
planned to submit at all.
Amid the uncertainty, there was scheduling to be done.
Narrowe and Mecca had to spread the thirty student films
over three nights, according to preferences listed by the
filmmakers. Some had family coming into town. Others
wanted to attend Senior Formal. Narrowe and Mecca were
left with the task of accommodating their requests, while
still producing three balanced nights of films.
To do that, they had to watch them. On Saturday, May
15,1 joined Mecca, Narrowe, and former president Mark
Ybarra for an afternoon of viewing in the SFS office behind
the Toyon eating clubs. A cut-out of Humphrey Bogart and
a toy lawnmower drenched in what looked like blood
presided over the session.
Mecca's explanation of the lawnmower was a little
vague, leading me to suspect some secret, bloody chapter of
SFS history. Ybarra was more helpful. While the presidents
discussed the order of the films, he gave me a breakdown of
their sources.
Eleven of this year's films come from the Student Film
makers' Workshop (SFW), a group of first-timers who spend
the whole school year learning techniques and producing

their debut films. The Workshop carries no academic cred
it. "That way," Ybarra said, "only people who are truly in
love with filmmaking take it." True love, though, is hard to
find; six Workshop participants dropped out of the festival.
The SFS also sponsors a Film Grant Program, in which
more experienced filmmakers can apply for funding by sub
mitting treatments, budgets and production schedules for
their prospective films. Three of this year's Film Grant re
cipients were graduates of the Advanced Filmmakers'
Workshop, a more rigorous follow-up to the SFW geared
toward those who have already produced a live-action film.
Then there are open submissions. Make a film as a reg
istered student, and you too can enter the Student Film
Festival. Of course, your film will be reviewed by a jury of
SFS members. It must observe certain length limits - typi
cally fifteen minutes or less. And while profanity and "nude
body painting" have gotten by in the past, a film was re
cently axed for pornographic content.
Once you've been accepted, you'll have to fill out per
mission forms for any copyrighted material you use - one di
rector turned in a whole binder full of them. You'll have to
make all your actors sign talent releases. And you'll proba
bly spend hours in the editing room, perhaps going down to
the wire on a sunny Saturday morning to make sure your
final cut gets in on time.
