# Smuin Ballet's 'Retrospective': Bet you can't pronounce 'barre' properly
## 
### EMILY HITE INTERMISSION BALLERINA 
Fusing classical ballet with many other forms of theatrical en
tertainment, Smuin Ballet presented a light and entertaining per
formance at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Per
forming Arts April 20 thru May 16. In the Tenth Anniversary
Retrospective season of the Bay Area-based company, several
of director and choreographer Michael Smuin's popular ballets
were featured along with narrated film clips that took the audi
ence on a comprehensive and spectacular tour through the com
pany's history with Smuin's choreography.
The performance began with a darkened stage, empty but for
the ballet barre, a horizontal pole dancers hold onto when doing
exercises at the beginning of ballet class. Nicole Trerise entered
wearing a black unitard, long blonde hair flowing, and danced a
solo to Nat King Cole's "Unforgettable."
Not only was there a noticeable absence of pink tights and
hair in a bun — the look that is as commonly associated with bal
let as the barre — but the choreography demanded completely
unorthodox treatment of the equipment as Trerise spun off and
flipped over the barre with pizzazz and defiance. This opening
piece was an appropriate set-up for the rest of the performance:
The movement was all based in ballet technique (and all of the
performers were well-trained classical dancers), but Smuin Bal
let bypassed the modest, subtle charm of traditional ballet to get
right to the thrills.
Throughout the evening, the audience was kept alert and in
volved in the active pace of Smuin's choreography, particularly
in the full company closing entitled "Slap that Bass" that includ-

Ed the biggest and flashiest jumps, turns and partnering lifts in the
language of ballet.
The performance was better suited for viewers who sought
continuous excitement rather than those looking to discover
complex artistic statements within it.and this was partly due
to the great number of ballets excerpted. Smuin's choreogra

phy is fun and it appeals to a variety of tastes by integrating
tango, mambo, Broadway, cabaret, and references to old
fashioned cinema.
In the humorous "Chalita I Puppet Tango," David Strobbe
danced elegantly and seriously with his lovely doll of a partner,
who was attached as a part of Strobbe's costume. Each of the
segments performed demonstrated Smuin's style of making bal
let using upbeat, popular music and recognizable themes that in
corporated artists such as Aaron Copeland, George Gershwin,
and The Beatles. Many of the musical pieces were so familiar and
had such powerful connotations of their own that it was difficult,
as a viewer, to fit the dancing to them. Much like a presentation
at the Academy Awards, the film clips of some of Smuin's other
ballets effectively tied the excerpts together.
The evening also provided a glance into the future with com
pany member Amy Seiwert's new work, "Short Ride," set to
John Adams' music, "Short Ride in a Fast Machine." Five cou
ples made unexpected use of space and musical time with off
center partnering, suspended lifts and beautifully shaped em
braces in the ballet's opening and closing. The four-and-a-half
minute piece was over with all too quickly; fortunately, Seiwert
is commissioned to stage a full-length ballet for the company
next season.
The Tenth Anniversary Retrospective presented more than
12 of Smuin's ballets that were comfortingly predictable and of a
consistently high performance level. The- company will repeat
this program in Walnut Creek from May 28 to 29 and at the
Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts June 2-6.
Tickets are available for the Mountain View performances at
(650) 903-6000 or www.tickets.com. The June 2 show is a "Pay
what you can" performance.
