# 'Napoleon Dynamite': Both the film and the character are hip cats
## 
### JOSHUA SMITH FILM CRITIC 
What are you doing Thursday night? Screw that, I know pre
cisely what you're doing. You're canceling that "hot date" that
you made up to impress your roommate, you're putting off going
to the library (because you've been procrastinating this long, so
why not keep your streak intact?) and you're getting your nor
mally lazy ass down to Cubberly to see the Stanford Film Society's
pre-release screening of "Napoleon Dynamite."
The name Napoleon Dynamite invokes images of some kind
of Marvel superhero, replete with boundless strength, unsur
passed coolness and a pair of navy blue moon boots — to be worn
oiwthe pants, of course. In writer / director Jared Hess's film, the
title character has one of those three traits. Unfortunately, it's the
moon boots.
Portrayed with amazing understanding and grace by Jon
Heder, Napoleon is that über-dork we all knew (or were) in high
school. He's got no friends, and for good reason. With his un
kempt red 'fro, gold-framed spectacles and tucked-in T-shirts,
there's just no way Napoleon could ever be cool. (Or is there...)
To confirm his mega-dweeb status, Napoleon is repeatedly beat
up in the hallways, and he presents a story about the Loch Ness
Monster ("our undersea ally") for current events. He draws pic
tures of mythical ligers (lion-tigers) and is learning martial arts to
impress the chicks.
And who could blame him for being the ultra-geek? He's got
a dearth of cool male role models, which becomes apparent
when Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to stay with Napoleon

after Grandma goes away on vacation, leaving pitiable
Napoleon to look after her pet llama. Uncle Rico spends the
film's duration hopelessly attempting to relive his glory days as
a high school football backup quarterback, displaying his un
canny accuracy by throwing meat at Napoleon's nerd-boy vis
age as Nap rides by on his bike.
Soon, however, Napoleon is driven to reach even greater
heights when Pedro, the new kid in school, befriends him.
Napoleon and Pedro (Efren Ramirez) soon become partners in
crime, challenging each other to attain the impossible - a date
to the school dance. Soon Pedro needs Napoleon for an even
more momentous task as Pedro attempts to win the class pres-

idency, usurping the snotty
Summer Wheatley (Haylie
Duff). After applying all of the
usual campaign tactics ("Vote
for Pedro" tees, "Vote for
Pedro" buttons, smacking a
Summer Wheatley pinata), it's
up to Napoleon to secure
Pedro's election.

This is, simply put, one of the funniest comedies I have
ever seen. Heder's Napoleon is absolutely perfect; he man
ages to recant every line with a defensive air, and the moon
boots look so natural on him, it's almost frightening. But re
ally, it's the little things in this film that make it so splendid
ly comical, like the way Napoleon grabs a huge handful of
tater tots from Pedro's tray at lunch and stashes them in his
pocket for future consumption. The production design is
also phenomenal. From Napoleon's ridiculously stupid T
shirts to the "Pegasus Xing" sign on his bedroom door to the
look and feel of the small Idaho town, Cory Lorenzen's pro
duction design is flawless.
Though the audience can't help but laugh right in Napoleon
Dynamite's face pretty much every time he says anything, this
film is great because of the sympathy we develop for the title
character. The flick has a huge heart. The central themes of
friendship and the victorious underdog can't be beat. The audi
ence roots for Napoleon in a way I haven't seen since Charlie
went to score on that triple deke at the end of the "Mighty
Ducks." This movie, like Napoleon himself, has sweet skills. I'll
see you there Thursday.


'Napoleon Dynamite 1 is so hot that there aren't even pictures of
the film online yet. That means that we can't infringe copyrights
by copying and printing them without permission. Sad.
