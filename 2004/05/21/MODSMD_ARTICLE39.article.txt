# Sex Tips From Stanford's Sex Goddess: Bring Exotic Erotic Home
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Stanford needs a big fist up its ass, vagina, or otherwise said
beneath-the-legs orifice. There, 1 said it, dear readers. I've been
bottling it up, holding it in me all quarter, but damn, Roxy
needs her release and it's about time this campus got down and
dirty with its kinky self. Come on, people, am I the only one on
this campus who appreciates the wonders of a full roll of
bondage tape, explicit public sex, and yes, need I mention it
again, fisting?
1 too witnessed the lovely sexual debacle known as "Exotic
Erotic" and, yes, I'm going to comment on it like everyone else.
The night, to put it tamely, failed to satisfy me, and an unsatis
lied woman is about as pretty a sight as a horse-mauling moun
tain lion up your frontyard tree. The night failed to satisfy me,
despite expectations as low as my cleavage line.
Let's face it, Exotic Erotic is neither "exotic" nor "erotic." If
truth in advertising held for campus parties, the night would be
renamed Wait In Line For 45 Minutes Watching Drunk Frat

Guys With Three Leaves Covering Their Shriveled Packages
Night. But I don't think the Better Business Bureau is going to
be taking any action. (Those stolid bureaucrats probably won't
be getting any action, either.) Not that it's the fault of party-host
680 Lomita. Did you see their entrance decoration? It im
pressed even Roxy.
We're supposedly the most creative, talented group of engi
neers, writers, and thinkers out there. We're nerds — not that
that's a bad thing, because Roxy know from experience that the
cerebrally gifted are usually genitally gifted as well. It also
means that we have the ingenuity and imagination to construct
some incredibly intense, memorable and downright acrobatic
good times. If we can code cutting-edge software, build bridges
and author lyrical prose, we can sure as hell out-circus Cirque
du Soleil in the bedroom. There's a lot more to a healthy sex life
than simple, barebones (pun fully intended) missionary sex. It's
called missionary position fora reason — who thinks of a robe
clad proselytizing priest as hot? With that in mind, here's
Roxy's end-of-the-year gift to you all — four deliciously kinky
challenges for you all to try before you leave campus for the
summer.
1) Sex in the Claw. It sounds painful, 1 know. But think of it in
more general terms — get out into Stanford's nearly 10,000-
acre playground of prurience and shag, baby, shag. Don't tell
me you haven't thought about it, because Roxy knows you're a
liar. Take your significant other, one night fling or chemistry
T A and drag that person to some of the more titillating spots on
campus. Roxy highly recommends the classic outdoor spots —
spread a blanket and get her damp near the Dish, make love at
Lake Lag or, for the more daring, get freaky in the fountain out
side of Old Union. Academic buildings are a little cliche, but to
me nothing says wicked more than hot sex on the roof of the
Psych building, the GSB Schwab Center courtyard, or in the
Hoover Institution (which has the added bonus of scandalizing
all the ancient white dudes that work there — you know they're
not getting any). Another classic shag spot is Green's claus
trophic stacks. Just don't stain any books.
2) Marathon Sex. If you're going to sexile your roommate for
an entire night, or for at least a good four or five hours, take full
advantage of the time. For those guys that are always "on time"
or, worse, "early," foreplay is not only romantic — it can kill at
least an extra hour.
Also, Roxy is a firm (no pun intended) believer in geo

graphical egalitarianism when it comes to sex — spread (pun
definitely intended) your lovin' all over the room. Special points
go to those who can "box the compass" — a term describing the
situation when every item in your room reminds you of a sexu
al act or experience. Do be careful, however, with the staplers
and three-hole punches.
3) Flashing. Roxy has heard reports that some beautiful soul
bared her bountiful breasts to Eve 6 at least week's Spring
Thing concert. My hearty congratulations go out to her. It's
springtime, meaning that the air is warm and perfectly for bare
skin — lots of it. Roxy has a warning, however: This advice
should not apply to the men on-campus. The penis, I'm afraid,
is neither bountiful nor beautiful.
4) Strangers on the Train — Or in the Room. Simply put, the
Stanford housing situation is not the most sex-inducing thing in
the world. The plethora of one-room doubles and one-room
triples, not to mention the loathsome closet-sized doubles in
Naranja, can make it hard to find time alone to get your freak
on. But, if you can't get rid of your roommate, why not go ahead
with your lusty plans anyway? In the words of Gandalf (LOTR
nerds are soooo hot), "Keep it secret, keep it safe — and keep
it kinky." What can be kinkier than rolling around in the sack
with your softly dozing roomie just feet away? The idea, here,
is to not be caught mid-coitus — if you keep your duplicitous
lovin' from your roommate, you get full points. If you wake her
up and get her to join in, bonus points.
5) Vocalize. The larynx is an oft-forgotten sexual stimulant.
What's hotter than moaning, panting and all other bedroom
growls? Have a competition between you and your partner and
see who can tip the needle on the decibel meter farthest to the
right. If you can wake up your neighbors and provoke angry
wall-knocking, extra points. It shouldn't be too hard — the
walls at Stanford are about as well-designed as the rooms.
I know many of you will scoff at some of these ideas, but
Stanford, as an institution, is about pushing boundaries, trying
new things, and getting to learn the unfamiliar. Why can't our
education extend from the classroom into the bedroom? I dare
you, readers, to try these simple solutions before you take off
for that internship or research trip abroad. Don't lament the
sad lack of sex at Exotic Erotic — just bring Exotic Erotic to
your own room.


I'm not gonna lie: This is a terribly low-res photo, and I just
don't give a shit. It's 11:02 p.m. on Thursday and I'd rather be
drinking than messing around quark. Here's what the caption
should have read: "Dear Mom: My roommate and I had a three
some this weekend. Isn't college great!" My ramble is probably
better than that caption, so count yourself lucky.
