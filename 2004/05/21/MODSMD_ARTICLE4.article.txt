# Students worry over departure of Human Biology lecturers
## 
### ERICK FLORES STAFF WRITER 
Students and faculty in the Human
Biology Program are concerned
about the departure of fifteen lectur
ers within the next two years. The
program is being restructured with
more tenure-track professors and
fewer lecturers, so many contracts are
not being renewed.
To protest what they saw as dis
missals, some students initiated a let
ter-writing campaign to Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences Sharon Long,
expressing their support for lecturers
they felt had contributed to their

learning experience at Stanford. The
letters were part of an effort, which is
still being negotiated with the Univer
sity, to extend the stay of these faculty
members.
Long responded to the statements,
claiming that there had been a misun
derstanding on behalf of the students,
who were misinformed about the sta
tus and contracts of these specific
teaching staff members. Long would
not name which lecturers were losing
their positions.
The fifteen lecturers are part of the
teaching category known as para-fac
ulty who conduct classes at the Uni
versity on a non-tenure line track.

Typically, when they are hired, the
lecturers are given one-year contracts
that may or may not be renewable de
pending on each individual agree
ment. Only a small number of these
lecturers have been with the Univer
sity for an extended period of time
and each situation is being handled
uniquely, according to Long.
She said that the Faculty Senate
has recently become stricter in en
forcing the long-time standard that
Stanford be committed to bringing in
more Academic Council faculty, pro
fessors who are on a tenure track. The
decision to restructure the program by
limiting the number of consulting pro
fessors and lecturers was a direct re
sponse to the Senate's recommenda
tions.
"Lecturers have an important role
in the University, but they shouldn't
be used as a substitution for tenured
faculty," Long said. "The Faculty Sen
ate has guidelines that demand that
our teachers also be scholars. This is
also a reason students are paying to
come here."
The issue is more complicated be
cause the Human Biology Program is
one of many interdisciplinary pro
grams (IDP), which do not have their
own faculty, but rather require the
participation of tenure-track profes
sors from other departments. Long
said diverse professor involvement is
supposed to guarantee that the IDP
continues to be characterized as truly
interdepartmental and that it garners
enough support to stand on its own.
For this reason, the University has

pushed towards replacing lecturers
with more Academic Council faculty.
When Jeffrey Wine when became
the director of the Human Biology
Program last year, he was told to limit
the appointment of non tenure-track
professors, and implementing the cur
rent changes is one of his most impor
tant tasks. Still, he acknowledged the
potential repercussions of such faculty
restructuring, as he had heard voiced
by members of the Stanford commu
nity.
He said that the most convincing ar
gument he had heard was that core fac
ulty members may have a commitment
to research and graduate teaching that
leaves them with only a small portion ot
their time for undergraduates. Other
faculty may have teaching as their pri
mary contribution, he noted.
"Exactly what the balance should
be among these two partially overlap
ping sets will probably be debated as
long as we have universities," he said.
Both Wine and Long said that the
lecturers in question would have their
contracts renewed for at least one year
to provide stability in the midst of
change and that the administration
was pacing the process so that it could
be done as fairly and constructively as

possible. While individual negotia
tions are being kept confidential. Long
mentioned that some professors
would be relocated to other academic
departments, while others would pos
sibly leave the University altogether.
Though many of the repercussions
are unclear at this point, at least some
current courses in the program will no
longer be offered. One such class is
Human Biology 108: Boys Psychoso
cial Development, taught by Judy
Chu, who, after having her contract
extended to next year, has been asked
to leave her post and offer her course
for the last time in spring 2005.
One senior human biology major
who engaged in the letter-writing cam
paign remarked that he telt this was a
grave mistake on behalt of the Univer
sity. He wished to remain anonymous
in order not to jeopardize ongoing ne
gotiations between faculty members
and the school.
"In my experience at Stanford,
many of these lecturers and consulting
professors have best emulated the in
terdisciplinary engagement held as an
ideal in Stanford undergraduate edu
cation." he said. "It seems that in an at
tempt to improve the quantitative sta
tistics of tenured faculty teaching in

undergrad education, the quality of
that education itself is being seriously
threatened."
Dean Long said that the Human
Biology Program was the first of the
many IDPs that would face structural
changes in the upcoming years. As the
largest program, with many more ma
jors than any other IDP, Human Biol
ogy was chosen as the first to undergo
a transition.
Among other changes, she noted
that the Latin American Studies pro
gram would potentially return as an
IDP or at least as a master's program
after more tenure-track professors
are brought in to provide a stronger
foundation for the department that
was controversially eliminated two
years ago.
At least two other changes are ex
pected to occur in the Human Biology
Program by the end of 2005. Specifi
cally. developmental biology profes
sors in the School of Medicine are
being recruited to teach a major seg
ment of the core classes, and the pro
gram plans on implementing a full
time biomedical ethics position. The
search fora candidate is expected to
begin this autumn, as the current lec

ulty members may have a commitment
to research and graduate teaching that
leaves them with only a small portion ot
their time for undergraduates. Other
faculty may have teaching as their pri
mary contribution, he noted.
"Exactly what the balance should
be among these two partially overlap
ping sets will probably be debated as
long as we have universities," he said.
Both Wine and Long said that the
lecturers in question would have their
contracts renewed for at least one year
to provide stability in the midst of
change and that the administration
was pacing the process so that it could
be done as fairly and constructively as

possible. While individual negotia
tions are being kept confidential. Long
mentioned that some professors
would be relocated to other academic
departments, while others would pos
sibly leave the University altogether.
Though many of the repercussions
are unclear at this point, at least some
current courses in the program will no
longer be offered. One such class is
Human Biology 108: Boys Psychoso
cial Development, taught by Judy
Chu, who, after having her contract
extended to next year, has been asked
to leave her post and offer her course
for the last time in spring 2005.
One senior human biology major
who engaged in the letter-writing cam
paign remarked that he telt this was a
grave mistake on behalt of the Univer
sity. He wished to remain anonymous
in order not to jeopardize ongoing ne
gotiations between faculty members
and the school.
"In my experience at Stanford,
many of these lecturers and consulting
professors have best emulated the in
terdisciplinary engagement held as an
ideal in Stanford undergraduate edu
cation." he said. "It seems that in an at
tempt to improve the quantitative sta
tistics of tenured faculty teaching in

undergrad education, the quality of
that education itself is being seriously
threatened."
Dean Long said that the Human
Biology Program was the first of the
many IDPs that would face structural
changes in the upcoming years. As the
largest program, with many more ma
jors than any other IDP, Human Biol
ogy was chosen as the first to undergo
a transition.
Among other changes, she noted
that the Latin American Studies pro
gram would potentially return as an
IDP or at least as a master's program
after more tenure-track professors
are brought in to provide a stronger
foundation for the department that
was controversially eliminated two
years ago.
At least two other changes are ex
pected to occur in the Human Biology
Program by the end of 2005. Specifi
cally. developmental biology profes
sors in the School of Medicine are
being recruited to teach a major seg
ment of the core classes, and the pro
gram plans on implementing a full
time biomedical ethics position. The
search fora candidate is expected to
begin this autumn, as the current lec
turers begin their final year.
Students and faculty in the Human
Biology Program are concerned
about the departure of fifteen lectur
ers within the next two years. The
program is being restructured with
more tenure-track professors and
fewer lecturers, so many contracts are
not being renewed.
To protest what they saw as dis
missals, some students initiated a let
ter-writing campaign to Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences Sharon Long,
expressing their support for lecturers
they felt had contributed to their

learning experience at Stanford. The
letters were part of an effort, which is
still being negotiated with the Univer
sity, to extend the stay of these faculty
members.
Long responded to the statements,
claiming that there had been a misun
derstanding on behalf of the students,
who were misinformed about the sta
tus and contracts of these specific
teaching staff members. Long would
not name which lecturers were losing
their positions.
The fifteen lecturers are part of the
teaching category known as para-fac
ulty who conduct classes at the Uni
versity on a non-tenure line track.

Typically, when they are hired, the
lecturers are given one-year contracts
that may or may not be renewable de
pending on each individual agree
ment. Only a small number of these
lecturers have been with the Univer
sity for an extended period of time
and each situation is being handled
uniquely, according to Long.
She said that the Faculty Senate
has recently become stricter in en
forcing the long-time standard that
Stanford be committed to bringing in
more Academic Council faculty, pro
fessors who are on a tenure track. The
decision to restructure the program by
limiting the number of consulting pro
fessors and lecturers was a direct re
sponse to the Senate's recommenda
tions.
"Lecturers have an important role
in the University, but they shouldn't
be used as a substitution for tenured
faculty," Long said. "The Faculty Sen
ate has guidelines that demand that
our teachers also be scholars. This is
also a reason students are paying to
come here."
The issue is more complicated be
cause the Human Biology Program is
one of many interdisciplinary pro
grams (IDP), which do not have their
own faculty, but rather require the
participation of tenure-track profes
sors from other departments. Long
said diverse professor involvement is
supposed to guarantee that the IDP
continues to be characterized as truly
interdepartmental and that it garners
enough support to stand on its own.
For this reason, the University has

pushed towards replacing lecturers
with more Academic Council faculty.
When Jeffrey Wine when became
the director of the Human Biology
Program last year, he was told to limit
the appointment of non tenure-track
professors, and implementing the cur
rent changes is one of his most impor
tant tasks. Still, he acknowledged the
potential repercussions of such faculty
restructuring, as he had heard voiced
by members of the Stanford commu
nity.
He said that the most convincing ar
