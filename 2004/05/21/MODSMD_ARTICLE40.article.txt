# Low carb in Los Altos (and loving it!): The Trim Gourmet

into the peristaltic vortex.
Indeed, about the only residual
side effect is the laxative one. We
learn that these hard-to-digest sweet
eners are nutritionally equivalent to
fiber (thus the latest catchphrase -
"effective carbs"), and good bowel
movement seems a small price for
carb-free goodies. Diabetics may also
rejoice at the options this trend
promises to restore to their diets (that
whole heavenly horizon).
Why then do I resist this gourmet
gospel? 1 inhale meringues (ethereal
as cherubs) and flourless cookies
(moist but a little gummy) in search
of answers. Perhaps the cost... but
they are no dearer than premium
groceries. Perhaps I feel that food, an
essentially aesthetic experience,
should not be so scientific, so calcu
lated. Ming, my eternal cynosure in
these matters, suggests we recall too
slavishly the real sweetness and sus
pect foul play when we discern no dif
ference (as with these marvelous
Canadian chocolates) â€” we want to
feel denied. Savory snacks (soy pret
zels and chips) on the other hand are
acceptable, and we had to thought
taste low-carb pasta and pilaf (sadly
unavailable). Despairing at my self
inscribed taste, 1 try to flush out my
prejudices with some peach-syrup
Italian soda, steeling myself against
that inevitable astringency. When the
judgment comes, I want to be in that
trim host.

The premise, on the face of it,
seems simple enough. Danielle, the
energetic creator of The Trim
Gourmet, an exciting new store in
Los Altos dealing only in the lowest
(and thus best) of low-carbohydrate
foods, explains away the mysteries of
this dietary phenomenon with warm
erudition while she plies us with sam
ples of cheesecake and crustless
quiche. The ultimate aim of any low
carb diet, it seems, is no more perfid
ious than the avoidance of stratos
pheric spikes in blood sugar levels
(such as might follow, say, a dozen di
abolic doughnuts). All manner of
healthiness, of course, will redound
from this happy equilibrium. A pe
ripheral shopper sails into view and
declaims the divinity of a chocolate
chip cookie. Danielle brims with sim
ple satisfaction.
Our hostess (for it is a sampling
party we have stumbled upon, re
plete with subito jazz and bossa nova)
continues our education. Sugar alco
hols such as sorbitol and maltatol
have been used, alongside saccharine
and aspartame, to artificially sweeten
foods. These existing compounds,
however, tend to produce any num
ber of side effects (phenylketo-nurics
beware!). Recently, alternative
sweeteners have been developed
from such humble sources as the
chicory root (yielding inulin) or by al
chemical wizardry (sugar loses hy
drogen and oxygen and gains chlo
rine, precipitating splendiferous su
cralose). The trick behind all these
substitutes is roughly the same: the
harlot tongue accepts them all as
"sweet," but since the body has no
means by which to break them down,
the intestinal walls turn them all
away, spasming in disgust. I envision
(between mouthfuls of almond-meal
brownie) these monstrous, misun
derstood molecules, such as one
might make deep in the throes of
Chem 35, floating dejectedly down
