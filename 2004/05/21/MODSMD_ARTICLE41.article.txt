# Grand Buffet: Cheaper than the all-you-can-eat special in Vegas
## 
### ANDREW NIELSEN INTERMISSIONARY 
Straight outta Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Grand Buffet have
been dropping science and rocking crowds both here and abroad
for about seven years. More Weird A1 than the Beastie Boys, and
more Beavis & Butthead than the Eyedea & Abilities, Grand
Buffet provide much needed comic relief to a clogged-up indie
rap scene. They have toured with Wesley Willis, Sage Francis and
members of the Anticon camp and have really been creating a
buzz for themselves in the underground rap scene for their Nin
tendo-esque 8-bit break beats and hilarious complicated rhymes.
And they also put on a killer show, with little more than two
dudes, a Discman, and a burnt instrumental disc.
Their "Pittsburgh Hearts EP" just dropped in the US, and 1
was able to catch up with rhyme spitter and chief producer Jarrod
Weeks when he came to rock Slim's with Sage Francis. A&R are
salivating over these guys, as they are getting props from Rolling
Stone and frenzied fan posts on message boards. I followed up
with some questions over e-mail to learn more about what is
going on in the boys' sick little post-rap world.

INTERMISSION: Introduce yourself and what you do.
LORI) GRUNGE: I'm Lord Grunge, a.k.a. Jarrod Weeks, from
Grand Buffet, which is an American rap group. I make beats and
do a little rapping, and I also handle the business shit from Grand
Buffet.
INT: How would you define your genre of music?
LG: I wouldn't. Naw I'm just playing. I'd say it's like this: Rod
ney Dangerfield rapes a cyborg, OK? The cyborg gets pregnant,
OK? Said cyborg listens to only GTR and Dave Matthews band
during its pregnancy, and also chain-smokes and drinks Old Rip
Van Winkle like it's water. Said cyborg then gives birth, but not
to a physical, tangible being, no, but to our genre of music.
INT: How old were you when you joined forces with Mr. Penn
sylvania?
LG: It doesn't matter because age ain't nothin' but meat on a
bone.
INT: There used to be three guys in the group, right? Wasn't
the third guy named "M-Dog" or something, and what is he
doing now? Is he pissed that he's no longer in the band, and
you guys are touring the world and getting mentioned in
Rolling Stone?
LG: M-Dog didn't leave. I used to be M-Dog. I'm still here.
The dude who left was G-rude, and no I don't think he gives a
fuck that it's six years since he quit and we're still broke and
not famous.
INT: "Scrooge Mcßock" (1997) feels like you did it in a real stu
dio, and while your "Sparkle Classic" (2000) and post-Sparkle
stuff is great, it does sound kind of more 10-fi. Why do you con
sider "Scrooge Mcßock" a demo if it's so tight?
LG: I say that shit's a demo because we made it only to
shop to labels and shit. We were philosophically corrupt
whilst making it. The art was a means to an end, not an end
in itself. Everything we've released since then has been on
the level. By that I mean, we made it for the sake of mak
ing it, shit that we were pumped about, not just as some
shit to shop.
At that time we thought we needed a label to put out a cool
record, it was like: "Make this demo joint, someone will like it,
then we make a dope record that they pay for." But then it just
went to making a dope record that we could afford to make,
that's how it's been since 2000.
INT: When did Wesley Willis (rest in peace) hear your stuff and
what led him to invite you to tour with him?
LG: We opened for him a few times in Pittsburgh and New
York, before touring with him. His manager liked our shit and
played it for Wes, and I guess Wes dug it a lot.
INT: How did you hook up with Sole and Sage? Any other
Non-Prophets tours planned?
LG: I've known both of those dudes fora few years. I think Sage

told Sole about or shit, few years back. Shit I can't remember.
2001,1 met both those cats, they're both good cats. I'd like to tour
with non-prophets again, sure, that'd be hype. Both of those
dudes have done a lot for us.
INT: Outside of Grand Buffet and your children's album, do you
have other stuff planned as a solo artist?
LG: Yeah, man, I'm definitely cooking up some solo shit. I might
be 30 before it drops, though.
INT: Your stuff is often peripherally political. You have issues
you address without being heavy handed — but what are your
real views on, the war in Iraq, for example?
LG: my theory: it's some gang-banger, turf-war type shit. Bush
is using American soldiers to guard his oil, dressing it up like
some "battle for Iraqi freedom" shit. It's horseshit.
Right before "we" invaded Iraq, last year, I was in Sweden
and I met an Iraqi dude at Burger King. He figured out I was
American pretty quick, so he started asking me about Bush
and shit. We rapped fora minute, and I straight up asked him
who he was more afraid of, bush or Saddam, and the brother
said Bush. Since then 1 haven't questioned the fact that it's a
complete farce.
INT: Every show I've seen you at, you namedrop the Insane
Clown Posse or Twiztid. Would you call yourself a "juggalo"?
What do you think about the Psychopathic Records camp?
LG: ICP is the shit, I can't wait for [their new CD] to drop. Psy
chopathic for life.
INT: Any plans for Jackson to get the karaoke album distrib
uted?
LG: I don't think so, no.
INT: What is your favorite all-time Grand Buffet track?
LG: Right now my favorite shit is "Benjamin Franklin Music"
[from "Pittsburgh Hearts'].
INT: What would you guys feel about blowing up, being signed
to a major and having your videos on MTV? Would you see this
as antithetical to your D.I.Y. hip-hop approach, or would you see
yourselves comfortably along the lines of such other crossover
hip-hop / comedy acts as the Bloodhound Gang?
LG: If the deal was tight, I'd sign to a major. I mean, I'm not
anti-big business. The D.I.Y. approach can be put into effect
at any level. It's not like you've gotta starve to be D.I.Y. I
think a motherfucker could be C.E.O. of a "Fortune 500"
company and still kick it with a D.1.Y.-esque approach. It's
just that many people who obtain that kind of financial suc
cess castrate themselves with bureaucracy. Major labels, for
example, are disappearing up their own assholes. But if I
could do a deal where we made the deal, I'd rock it.
