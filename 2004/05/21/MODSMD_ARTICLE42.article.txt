### MIKE ORME INTERMISSION MUSIC CRITIC 
Before we start, a small dis
claimer: I'm not a Magnetic Fields
fan. 1 never took the time to listen

through "69 Love
Songs," the Fields' epic
1999 three-disc ode to
angst-filled, affection
that lias found its way
into the indie-rock
canon. My small (and
admittedly inexhaus
tive) sampling of the

Magnetic^®
112 II

album's more well-known tracks led
me to the conclusion that the music
was a little hit underwhelming.
Fields mastermind Stephin Mer
ritt, while always adept at writing a
pretty melody and telling a heart
felt story, proved himself somewhat
less than my songwriter of choice
on "69 Love Songs" with his tinny
production and wine and
Quaaludes vocals.
That I have undertaken the chal
lenge of reviewing their new re
lease, "i,"for an audience which
may not share my opinions (or lack
thereof) of the band may be a dis
service to the readers, but I shall try
my best to hold the record to a more
objective standard, if such a thing
exists in the music world. So don't
send me any hate-mail when I say
that this is only an average record.
Hopefully, the experience will be an
educational one for the both of us.
The songs on "i" are noticeably
egocentric, though that's probably
to be expected given the album title.
All song titles begin with the letter
"i,"and with few exceptions, that
letter is the personal pronoun.
In"I Don't Believe You," Mer
ritt sings, "You tell me Fm not cute
/ Its truth or falsity is moot I 'cause
honesty's not your strong suit / and
I don't believe you." One suspects
that he's projecting onto others his
own insecurities.

Merritt playfully broods all over
the record; He sings longingly to a
vaguely Cure-inspired new wave
shuffle on "I Thought You Were
My Boyfriend," then nostalgic res
ignation hits on "It's Only Time."

These, the two
strongest tracks on the
album, showcase Mer
ritt's ability to write af
fectionate pop hooks
and the Fields' flexibili
ty to play baroque and
synthetic pop in alter
nating breaths.

Unfortunately, Merrit's song
writing lacks the variance in produc
tion to keep the songs interesting
throughout the entire album. On
"i," Merrit is an angst-ridden Paul
McCartney, tackling each song on
the album with an unwavering com
bination of self-pity and playful self
deprecation that eventually proves
monotonous.
Like McCartney, he dresses his
songs in a refreshing blend of tradi
tional and experimental instrumen
tation, but strummed guitar and
soft piano only push his songs so
far; ultimately, "i" offers too few
moments which are interesting be
yond the strength of their melodies
or lyrics.
I can't say "i" has really
changed my opinion of the Mag
netic Fields. The only immediately
apparent improvement from "69
Love Songs" is that the Fields'
move to the major label stepping
stone Nonesuch has allowed their
songs to breathe more — rather
than languishing in tape-hiss, they
are allowed breathing room in a
full studio atmosphere. Merritt's
melodic gifts and experience as a
songwriter are apparent on "i,"
and while it's not always an inter
esting listen, at a lean 41-minutes
the album has got to have way
more bang for the buck than one
with 69 goddamn love songs.


I'm pretty sure that this is a picture of Stephin Merritt hut I'm
too lazy to check, so let's just assume, okay?


It's not a mistake — Mr. Merritt really does spell his first name with an k i."
Funny, huh? He's just a fount of quirky creative genius.
