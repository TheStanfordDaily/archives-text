# Panel discusses ethics in newspaper advertising
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The Daily should only run advertisements that en
courage dialogue. Daily board member Ted Glasser ar
gued at a panel last night, though the editor-in-chief, and
two other panelists strenuously disagreed with him.
"The Daily made an enormous mistake by publish
ing those ads," said Glasser, a professor of communi
cation, referring to the controversial Campustruth.org
advertisements The Daily ran last volume.
The advertisements sparked an unsuccessful movement
to remove Ramin Setoodeh, the editor-in-chief at the time.
Other panelists disputed Glasser's argument. Two
of their main arguments were that newspapers should
carry any advertisement that is legal and that stopping
speech is not a productive strategy

Much of the discussion centered on whether The Daily
fostered a productive debate with the advertisements or
whether the advertisements merely sparked controversy
over The Daily's decision to run them.
"People who defended it, defended it based on free
dom of speech," Glasser said. He said that he saw few.
if any, defenders of the actual content of the ads, which
compared Palestinian and Israeli perspectives on sui
cide bombers from a specific Israeli perspective.
Barbara Roessner, a Knight Fellow and deputy
managing editor at the Hartford Courant, said that as a
practitioner of journalism, she saw little argument
against letting most advertising run. She argued that
advertising departments and editorial departments
should be separate.
Compared with other publications. The Daily has
a unique structure where the edi
tor-in-chief is responsible for all
editorial content and oversees ad
vertising decisions. Brendan
Marten, the current editor, said
that he tries to stick by a policy that
specifically rejects advertisements
that disparage groups or are not
supported by evidence.
"The goal is to be as objective as
possible," Marten said.
Visiting Law Professor Tobias
Wolff said that although he disagreed
with the advertisements, keeping
them out of the newspaper would not
fix the ideology that they represent.
"The advertisements encourage
a tone of public discourse that is not
helpful," he said, referring to the or
ganization's motto, "that there is just
one truth."
Still, he said, "disagreeing with it
places a responsibility on me to chal
lenge the substance."
Supported by members of the au

die nee who called fora robust screen
ing process and newspapers without
any ads, Glasser argued that con
sumers of news have trouble distin
guishing between news and advertise
ments. He cited The Daily Show as an
example of an unconventional news
source. Therefore, he said, newspa
pers have an obligation to worry about
what goes into the 70 percent of the
paper that is not editorial content.
"Journalists serve as managers
of deliberation." Glasser said,
adding that with a public forum
everything in a newspaper is part of
the public debate. "It's difficult for
me to draw a line between editorial
content and advertising."
Roessner completely disagreed.
"Journalism is disinterested. Ad
vertising exists to sell a particular in
terest," she said.
Wolff, a first amendment scholar,
said that he found the ads quite of
fensive, as did many in the audience,
for their aggressive oversimplifica
tion of the truth.
But, he said, "the word "manag
ing' the public debate scares me."
