# House bill could bring back draft
## 
### MARISA C. JUAREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A bill presented to the 108 th Congress in January 2003 has
brought the issue of a national military draft too close for com
fort for many students. Known as the Universal National Ser
vice Act of 2003-2004, House Resolution (HR) 163 would rein
state a draft which — unlike Vietnam — would not exempt col
lege students.
Although the bill is currently in both houses of Congress and
may not pass for some time — if at all — the possibility is
enough to make some students concerned. If passed, HR 163
would require all Americans between the 18 and 26 years of
age to enter into some form of national service fora minimum
of two years.
According to the bill, this service would consist of joining the
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Public Health Service
or serving "in a civilian capacity that, as determined by the pres
ident, promotes the national defense, including national or com
munity service and homeland security."
Freshman Samia Rogers said she was not concerned about
performing military duty, but did not agree with the reasons be
hind a potential draft.
"1 wouldn't have a problem fighting for something that is right,
I just don't think what we're doing is right," Rogers said.
When asked about the non-gendered aspect of the bill, Rogers
responded, "It's only fair for both
genders to serve. We [women] have
the right to share the responsibility of
the draft."
Sophomore Daniel Herrera was
not as optimistic.
"I wouldn't know what to do," he
said. "My brother's in the Marines,
and I'm proud of him, but I
wouldn't want to see him in Iraq,
and I wouldn't want to see me in

Iraq, because I don't agree with the
war in Iraq."
The only exemptions for service
will he granted to those who are al
ready serving in a branch of the mil
itary, who are high school students
in good standing, who have a mental
or physical disability or to those
chosen personally by the president.
Conscientious objectors would not
be exempt from service, but would
participate in military activities that
would not include any combat train
ing — unless, at the discretion of the
president, they are transferred to
civilian service.
Gilbert Martinez, a third-year bio
physics graduate student, and the

head of Stanford Students for Kerry,
emphasized the need for students to
discuss the bill.
"I had a friend who nearly died
in Iraq," Martinez said. "We (as
students] need to be thinking
about this."
Martinez also pointed out that
people who usually join the armed
services are those from low socioe
conomic backgrounds, whereas
the new bill would make the draft
apply to everyone universally.
Many of the bill's supporters in
and out of Congress highlight this
provision.
Sophomore Bob Sensenbrenner,
president of the College Republicans,

said he was unconcerned by the bill.
"I don't think this legislation will
affect students at Stanford since it
has no chance of being passed," he
said. "This bill is an obvious political
ploy by Democratic members to try
to scare the American public . . .
The Department of Defense has
specifically stated that it does not
want to reinstitute the draft or any
thing like it."
Herrera predicted that the inclu
sion of women in the bill would hurt
its chance for passage.
"1 don't think our country is at the
point where we're ready to have
women shooting in the battlefield,"
he said.
