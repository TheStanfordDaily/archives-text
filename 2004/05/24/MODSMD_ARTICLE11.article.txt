## Hopkins Marine Station: Not just for otters 
### 
Hopkins Marine Station — or as 1 know it this quarter.
Home Sweet Home — is Stanford's marine biology
research facility. Located an hour or two south of
campus proper, the station lies just outside official
limits of Monterey, home of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and
the backdrop of John Steinbeck's "Cannery Row."
The station sits close to Monterey's tourist loop: It liter
ally shares a fence with the Aquarium. Fortunately, it's
closed off from it because Hopkins's shores double as a ma
rine life refuge.

This gives you the best of both worlds: You
can get scuba diving certification in Monterey,
buy your vittles at Monterey's convenient
walking-distance stores and run around with a
geeky friend in the world-class aquarium.
Then you can sit and rest awhile on Hop
kins' private shoreline, try out its own little
dock and take in a special, uncluttered view
of Monterey Bay.
And when I say it's a special view, I mean it.
Compared with Monterey, the main campus

looks like it's trying too hard. At Hopkins, it's
not your average sandy beach. Most of it's an incredibly beauti
ful cliff, partially covered with creepers and gnarled evergreens.
And not only is the rockiness itself beautiful, but it im
proves the view of the ocean in two simple ways. First, it helps
you see since it lifts you up and puts you at a great angle. Sec
ond, it makes the ocean itself look even better since the bumpi
ness of the ocean floor makes the water turbulent and crash
against the rocks.
Of course, I am a Midwestern townie, so I may be more en
thusiastic about the ocean than anyone who's grown up by it.
Still, even a Monterey native can appreciate the great wildlife
at the Hopkins refuge, like the otters swimming just off shore,
seals and sea lions bawling on the rocks and deer and birds
roaming the campus. And apparently, spring is a particularly
good time to come: May is when the foals are born and the
goslings hatch. (A grad student tells me that it gets to be like
Disneyland.)
By the way, the classes are awesome, too. It's probably not
wise to come if you're actively repulsed by biology, since (un
surprisingly) all the classes are all related to it. You do not, how
ever, have to like biology so much that you're actually a bio
major, hum bio, earth systems or otherwise pre-med.
Granted, most of the students here this quarter are, in fact,
one of the above. However, there are almost always a few stu
dents each quarter who aren't and the station people are always
looking for more. As long as you liked AP biology — which I'm
guessing most of you took — you will like the classes here.
Which brings me to another point: AP biology is definitely
enough background to take the classes here. The Bulletin does say
you need to have taken the bio core, but don't believe it. Take it
from me, a non-bio person: You don't have to be good at bio.
First off, a lot of the classes deal with new, up-and-coming re
search. So. everyone's pretty much on the same level. Second,
classes here are unbelievably small; this quarter there are eight
professors teaching just 14 undergrads, and usually the ratio is
even goofier. As a result, not only are the professors always
available to help, but the courses are customized to the students.
If you do happen to be bio (or humbio, earth systems or
pre-med), there is almost no reason for you not to spend a
quarter here. There are all sorts of amazing classes taught,
many of which aren't offered on main campus.
If you haven't come because you're bogged down by re
quirements, just come next spring: Hopkins will be offering Bio
43 and 44y, as well as other classes which fill the stats and
physics requirements. Finally, if you're pre-med and are just
looking to get into medical school, think about this: you will be
spending more time with your Hopkins professors than you
ever could with your main campus TAs.
At any rate, lemember that the main reason to come isn't
even for the classes. It's a totally different experience here, both
inside and outside the class. (And if I could have said that with
out sounding sappy and cliche, I would have.) Coming to Hop
kins has been a bit of a sacrifice in my case, because it means I'll
be grinding through (non-bio) degree requirements all through
senior year.
Nevertheless, being here is immensely satisfying, and I'd
recommend this place to anyone.

spending more time with your Hopkins professors than you
ever could with your main campus TAs.
At any rate, lemember that the main reason to come isn't
even for the classes. It's a totally different experience here, both
inside and outside the class. (And if I could have said that with
out sounding sappy and cliche, I would have.) Coming to Hop
kins has been a bit of a sacrifice in my case, because it means I'll
be grinding through (non-bio) degree requirements all through
senior year.
Nevertheless, being here is immensely satisfying, and I'd
recommend this place to anyone.

Hopkins Marine Station — or as 1 know it this quarter.
Home Sweet Home — is Stanford's marine biology
research facility. Located an hour or two south of
campus proper, the station lies just outside official
limits of Monterey, home of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and
the backdrop of John Steinbeck's "Cannery Row."
The station sits close to Monterey's tourist loop: It liter
ally shares a fence with the Aquarium. Fortunately, it's
closed off from it because Hopkins's shores double as a ma
rine life refuge.

This gives you the best of both worlds: You
can get scuba diving certification in Monterey,
buy your vittles at Monterey's convenient
walking-distance stores and run around with a
geeky friend in the world-class aquarium.
Then you can sit and rest awhile on Hop
kins' private shoreline, try out its own little
dock and take in a special, uncluttered view
of Monterey Bay.
And when I say it's a special view, I mean it.
Compared with Monterey, the main campus

looks like it's trying too hard. At Hopkins, it's
not your average sandy beach. Most of it's an incredibly beauti
ful cliff, partially covered with creepers and gnarled evergreens.
And not only is the rockiness itself beautiful, but it im
proves the view of the ocean in two simple ways. First, it helps
you see since it lifts you up and puts you at a great angle. Sec
ond, it makes the ocean itself look even better since the bumpi
ness of the ocean floor makes the water turbulent and crash
against the rocks.
Of course, I am a Midwestern townie, so I may be more en
thusiastic about the ocean than anyone who's grown up by it.
Still, even a Monterey native can appreciate the great wildlife
at the Hopkins refuge, like the otters swimming just off shore,
seals and sea lions bawling on the rocks and deer and birds
roaming the campus. And apparently, spring is a particularly
good time to come: May is when the foals are born and the
goslings hatch. (A grad student tells me that it gets to be like
Disneyland.)
By the way, the classes are awesome, too. It's probably not
wise to come if you're actively repulsed by biology, since (un
surprisingly) all the classes are all related to it. You do not, how
ever, have to like biology so much that you're actually a bio
major, hum bio, earth systems or otherwise pre-med.
Granted, most of the students here this quarter are, in fact,
one of the above. However, there are almost always a few stu
dents each quarter who aren't and the station people are always
looking for more. As long as you liked AP biology — which I'm
guessing most of you took — you will like the classes here.
Which brings me to another point: AP biology is definitely
enough background to take the classes here. The Bulletin does say
you need to have taken the bio core, but don't believe it. Take it
from me, a non-bio person: You don't have to be good at bio.
First off, a lot of the classes deal with new, up-and-coming re
search. So. everyone's pretty much on the same level. Second,
classes here are unbelievably small; this quarter there are eight
professors teaching just 14 undergrads, and usually the ratio is
even goofier. As a result, not only are the professors always
available to help, but the courses are customized to the students.
If you do happen to be bio (or humbio, earth systems or
pre-med), there is almost no reason for you not to spend a
quarter here. There are all sorts of amazing classes taught,
many of which aren't offered on main campus.
If you haven't come because you're bogged down by re
quirements, just come next spring: Hopkins will be offering Bio
43 and 44y, as well as other classes which fill the stats and
physics requirements. Finally, if you're pre-med and are just
looking to get into medical school, think about this: you will be
spending more time with your Hopkins professors than you
ever could with your main campus TAs.
At any rate, lemember that the main reason to come isn't
even for the classes. It's a totally different experience here, both
inside and outside the class. (And if I could have said that with
out sounding sappy and cliche, I would have.) Coming to Hop
kins has been a bit of a sacrifice in my case, because it means I'll
