# Fend off the fish!
## Stanford Dragon Boating Club faces challenges in first competition 
### KATIE BEARMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Dragon boating has officially
reached Stanford. Fora theme project
last year, Okada House began recruit
ing members from all over campus to
put together a team for this grueling
water sport. After working to find
committed students and to acquire
ASSU funding, the Stanford Dragon
Boating Club has finally gotten into
full swing this quarter.
So what exactly is this adventurous
sounding activity? According to
sophomore Lindsay Gibbon, one of
the club's unofficial co-captains, drag
on races are somewhat similar to crew
races because team members must
paddle together to cover fixed dis
tances as quickly as possible.
"If all the paddlers are pulling at
different times, they're actually work
ing against each other," Gibbon said.
Dragon race courses vary from 500
to 1,000 meters in length, and races last
approximately two to three minutes.
There are, however, some major dif
ferences between crew and dragon racing.
"We paddle as opposed to row and
push ourselves forward through the
water instead of pulling backwards
like in crew," Gibbon commented.
"There is a drummer in front who
watches the strokes and beats a drum
to help the paddlers keep time, as well
as a person who steers from the stern.
Twenty paddlers sit two by two, so the
boats are pretty big."
The boats are big, indeed. The
Dragon Boat Club of Boston attests
that boats are 40 feet long and three
to-five feet wide. They can weigh be
tween 800 and a whopping 2,200
pounds. During races, the boats are

decorated with dragon heads and tails
constructed from wood.
"They look pretty cool," Gibbon said.
According to sophomore and sec
ond unofficial co-captain Evelyn Chin,
dragon boating began over 2.000 years
ago in Southern China out of respect
for Qu Yuan, a highly respected prime
minister in the Kingdom of Chu. When
the emperor of the kingdom was kid
napped, Qu Yuan drowned himself in
a river out of loyalty and mourning.
"The people, sad that such an hon
orable man sacrificed his life, made

'As the Stanford racers were leaning
forward to stretch their back muscles,
the boat almost flipped over."

Chinese rice packages to throw into
the river so that the fish would eat the
rice and not Qu Yuan's body," Chin
said." Dragon boating involves a lot of
movement in the water as well as a lot
of drumming and noise, which serves
to fend off the fish."
Each year, there is a holiday com
memorating Qu Yuan in which drag
on boat races occur and rice packages
are prepared.
Over the past two decades, dragon
boating has become increasingly pop
ular in the United Kingdom, South
Africa, Australia and the United
States. There are many regional, na
tional and international competitions,
including a world championship.
This spring, the Stanford dragon

boaters participated in their first
competition. There were 22 teams at
the event, six of which were colle
giate teams.
"It was an extremely competitive
atmosphere," Gibbon said.
The event was a huge challenge for
the Stanford dragon racers because
the club just started and most of them
are inexperienced.
"Our team is quite enthusiastic, but
only two or three members of our
team have ever paddled dragon be
fore," Gibbon commented. "We had

only had five group practices before
the race, so while we've worked hard
to perfect our strokes, we've found
that we definitely need more than five
practices to consistently paddle with
good technique."
The Stanford team had a rocky
start to their race. Commonly, racers
stretch in their boats to warm up for
competitions. As the Stanford racers
were leaning forward to stretch their
back muscles, the boat almost
flipped over.
"The boats are pretty large and
quite stable, so I'm not sure why that
happened," Gibbon said. "Maybe be
cause it was very windy that day. But
anyway, we regained our balance just
in time and averted disaster."

Next, their boat was placed in the
lane farthest away from the starting
horn, so the racers could not hear the
signal to begin the race over the high
winds. Still, the Stanford dragon rac
ers think that they made the best out of
the situation.
"The team's timing came together
pretty nicely and we salvaged the
race," Gibbon said.
Their success is, in large part, due
to the help of dedicated and qualified
Stanford alumni who are serving as
the team's coaches. Some of these
alums paddle on prestigious Bay Area
teams such as Dragon Warriors and
Ripple Effect. These teams have par
ticipated in competitions all over the
world, including the annual Dragon
Boating Festival in Vancouver.
Inspired perhaps by the competi
tive history of their coaches, a few
members of the Stanford Dragon
Boating Club are planning to paddle
with established Bay Area teams over
the summer.
"I wouldn't be surprised if they
came back to school with some hard
ware," Gibbons said â€” hardware, of
course, meaning award medals.
The Stanford Dragon racers are ex
cited that their club has started up.
"Dragon Boating is a sport that
doesn't require people to be athletes.
So long as everyone paddles in sync,
our boat will surge forward," Chin
said. "I feel that Stanford Dragon
Boating is another medium in which to
represent Stanford in a competitive
sport that doesn't discriminate based
on athletic ability ... just dedication
to the team."
Gibbons added, "In the future, we
hope to be yet another competitive sports
team that will bring pride to Stanford."

Over the past two decades, dragon
boating has become increasingly pop
ular in the United Kingdom, South
Africa, Australia and the United
States. There are many regional, na
tional and international competitions,
including a world championship.
This spring, the Stanford dragon

boaters participated in their first
competition. There were 22 teams at
the event, six of which were colle
giate teams.
"It was an extremely competitive
atmosphere," Gibbon said.
The event was a huge challenge for
the Stanford dragon racers because
the club just started and most of them
are inexperienced.
"Our team is quite enthusiastic, but
only two or three members of our
team have ever paddled dragon be
fore," Gibbon commented. "We had

only had five group practices before
the race, so while we've worked hard
to perfect our strokes, we've found
that we definitely need more than five
practices to consistently paddle with
good technique."
The Stanford team had a rocky
start to their race. Commonly, racers
stretch in their boats to warm up for
competitions. As the Stanford racers
were leaning forward to stretch their
back muscles, the boat almost
flipped over.
"The boats are pretty large and
quite stable, so I'm not sure why that
happened," Gibbon said. "Maybe be
cause it was very windy that day. But
anyway, we regained our balance just
in time and averted disaster."

Next, their boat was placed in the
lane farthest away from the starting
horn, so the racers could not hear the
signal to begin the race over the high
winds. Still, the Stanford dragon rac
ers think that they made the best out of
the situation.
"The team's timing came together
pretty nicely and we salvaged the
race," Gibbon said.
Their success is, in large part, due
to the help of dedicated and qualified
Stanford alumni who are serving as
the team's coaches. Some of these
alums paddle on prestigious Bay Area
teams such as Dragon Warriors and
Ripple Effect. These teams have par
ticipated in competitions all over the
world, including the annual Dragon
Boating Festival in Vancouver.
Inspired perhaps by the competi
tive history of their coaches, a few
members of the Stanford Dragon
Boating Club are planning to paddle
with established Bay Area teams over
the summer.
"I wouldn't be surprised if they
came back to school with some hard
ware," Gibbons said â€” hardware, of
course, meaning award medals.
The Stanford Dragon racers are ex
cited that their club has started up.
"Dragon Boating is a sport that
doesn't require people to be athletes.
So long as everyone paddles in sync,
our boat will surge forward," Chin
said. "I feel that Stanford Dragon
Boating is another medium in which to
represent Stanford in a competitive
sport that doesn't discriminate based
on athletic ability ... just dedication
to the team."
Gibbons added, "In the future, we
hope to be yet another competitive sports
team that will bring pride to Stanford."

The newly formed Stanford Dragon Boating Club boasts over 25 mem
bers. Dragon boating is similar to crew, but members paddle instead of
row. There is also a drummer in front who beats a drum to help the pad
dlers keep time. The paddling movement in the water and the drumming
noise serve to fend off fish.

Dragon boating has officially
reached Stanford. Fora theme project
last year, Okada House began recruit
ing members from all over campus to
put together a team for this grueling
water sport. After working to find
committed students and to acquire
ASSU funding, the Stanford Dragon
Boating Club has finally gotten into
full swing this quarter.
So what exactly is this adventurous
sounding activity? According to
sophomore Lindsay Gibbon, one of
the club's unofficial co-captains, drag
on races are somewhat similar to crew
races because team members must
paddle together to cover fixed dis
tances as quickly as possible.
"If all the paddlers are pulling at
different times, they're actually work
ing against each other," Gibbon said.
Dragon race courses vary from 500
to 1,000 meters in length, and races last
approximately two to three minutes.
There are, however, some major dif
ferences between crew and dragon racing.
"We paddle as opposed to row and
push ourselves forward through the
water instead of pulling backwards
like in crew," Gibbon commented.
"There is a drummer in front who
watches the strokes and beats a drum
to help the paddlers keep time, as well
as a person who steers from the stern.
Twenty paddlers sit two by two, so the
boats are pretty big."
The boats are big, indeed. The
Dragon Boat Club of Boston attests
that boats are 40 feet long and three
to-five feet wide. They can weigh be
tween 800 and a whopping 2,200
pounds. During races, the boats are

decorated with dragon heads and tails
constructed from wood.
"They look pretty cool," Gibbon said.
According to sophomore and sec
ond unofficial co-captain Evelyn Chin,
dragon boating began over 2.000 years
ago in Southern China out of respect
for Qu Yuan, a highly respected prime
minister in the Kingdom of Chu. When
the emperor of the kingdom was kid
napped, Qu Yuan drowned himself in
a river out of loyalty and mourning.
"The people, sad that such an hon
orable man sacrificed his life, made

'As the Stanford racers were leaning

Chinese rice packages to throw into
the river so that the fish would eat the
rice and not Qu Yuan's body," Chin
said." Dragon boating involves a lot of
movement in the water as well as a lot
of drumming and noise, which serves
to fend off the fish."
Each year, there is a holiday com
memorating Qu Yuan in which drag
on boat races occur and rice packages
are prepared.
