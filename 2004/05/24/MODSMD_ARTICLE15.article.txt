# It's time to certify election
## 
### 
The results of the ASSU executive special
election showed a clear victory for the
slate of Chioke Borgelt-Mose and Kory
Vargas Caro. There is no reason to think
that the results will not he upheld, exceptt for the
fact that it has already happened twice this year.
The Undergraduate Senate made inappropri
ate use of its power by not certifying the execu
tive results of the regular election. Even the
newly-elected Senate has had a hand in exacer
bating the situation by finding a way to navigate
around the Constitutional Council's very reason
able objections to the first certification vote.
Now, for the sake of the student body, the Senate
must certify the special election results.
It is unfortunate that this epic, weeks-long
power struggle has been allowed to overshadow
many of the important issues that the campus is
facing, like the denial of special-fees funding to
MEChA. The campus must move on. With the
small amount of time left in spring quarter,
Borgelt-Mose and Vargas Caro need to begin the
transition to next vear. This year's ASSU Presi

dent, Nadiya Figueroa, will be graduating soon,
and the window for her to impart her wisdom and
experience to her successors is fast closing. Any
further delays to the election process could seri
ously damage the quality of next year's leadership.
Nor do we know of any reasons for such a
delay to occur. The special election candidates
ran clean campaigns and votes were cast without
incident. The winning slate had 442 votes over its
closet competitor. Surely, the Senate does not
have grounds on which to not certify, as it did
with its claim of "abuse of power" against senior
presidential candidate Mikey Lee.
This late in the year and this far into the elec
tions controversy, there is little that the ASSU
can do to salvage its respectability. The most it
can do is to set itself up for the start of a produc
tive year in the fall. As it stands, the organization
is like a rudderless ship that is taking on water.
Several members of the Constitutional Council
have resigned and some people have proposed
the idea of not having an executive body at all.
Another vote to not certify and the ship will sink.
