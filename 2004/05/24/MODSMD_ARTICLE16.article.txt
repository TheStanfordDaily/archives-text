# Thanks for 18 years, Monty

### 
Because it came without warning, it is
tempting at first to react angrily to long
time Stanford head basketball coach
Mike Montgomery's decision to leave
the Farm fora job coaching the NBA's Golden
State Warriors. His players may feel abandoned;
his assistant coaches and staff may feel betrayed;
fans may feel resentful. But the truth is that, in 18
years, Montgomery turned Stanford's basketball
team from a joke into a national power — from
an embarrassment to a source of visible school
pride. He deserves thanks from the Stanford com
munity for both his success and the way he
achieved it; with dignity and with respect for the
University's academic tradition.
A handful of his players have gone on to profes
sional basketball careers, but many more have
found success in the corporate, public or non
profit sectors after graduation. That Montgomery
was able to run a program that consistently chal
lenged for the Pacific-10 Conference title and
that also consistently turned out well-rounded
and impressive Stanford graduates is an amazing
accomplishment in this age of spoiled and delin

quent high school stars who view college as a
minor league for the NBA.
Before Montgomery took over the team in 1986,
Stanford had posted just one winning record in
the previous 13 seasons. Montgomery reversed
that trend immediately: Stanford had just one los
ing record in his 18-year tenure. Even more im
pressively, Montgomery took over a team that
had not reached the NCAA Tournament in more
than 45 years and directed it to 10 consecutive
NCAA Tournaments from 1995-96 to 2003-04.
But the truest measure of Montgomery's suc
cess was that he was able to achieve so much suc
cess in the face of a losing tradition, a small fan
base and some of the strictest academic standards
in the country. Most other successful coaches
have built their teams out of players who would
never be admitted to Stanford.
Montgomery's departure for the NBA will cer
tainly sadden many in the Stanford community.
But it should also be an occasion to celebrate his
remarkable success and to recognize his status as
man who created Stanford men's basketball as we
know it today. Thank you. Coach Montgomery.
