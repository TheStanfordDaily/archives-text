## The 						line is the greater evil 
### 
Quite frankly, I don't give a
hoot about the door. Sure,
having to walk those extra
10 yards through the U.S.
ce is an irksome inconve
nience, hut let's be honest. You chose
lo attend a school with a campus that
needs to be navigated with golf carts
— you knew you what you were get
ting into.
No, no, no, it's not the door that gets
my goat. It's that damn line.
I don't think it's ever not there.
Ever. And I've tried to avoid it. Roll in
at 10 a.m.? Line. Late lunchtime,
bumping up with the 1:15 class block?
Line. Let's not talk about the situation
post 4 p.m., because that's when I start
thinking about what it would have
been like to live in Eastern Europe
under communism.
I've never experienced a bread line,
so I'm not sure if the campus post office
situation is really an exact parallel. But
I imagine it's pretty close.
Last week, when I waited in line for
over half an hour to pick up an Ama
zon.com package, I partook in this very
thought experiment. Basically it was
the only way for me to keep myself
from going postal as I stood with the
green slip looking wistfully at the pack
age pickup window that was so unfor
tunately closed. And I was not alone.
As I looked back at the line of at least
15 other people who had begun to ritu
alistically check their watches with
sighs of frustration and bewilderment,
1 was comforted. I hadn't yet resorted
to their restrained pacing, so there was
hope for me yet.
That is when I came to the conclu
sion that every economics student at
Stanford should be required to spend at
least a day in the post office, simply to
hone their appreciation of competitive
markets. In my 20 years of life, I have

come across no single more compelling
demonstration of the value of capital
ism than our campus post office.
The Daily has itself alluded to this
when, in a rare moment of unabashed
economic liberalism (or conservatism...

ah, the complicated
lingo of politics), it
editorialized earlier
this month, "The
Postal Service is un
fortunately a gov
ernment-chartered
monopoly, and
there is no alterna
tive means of
collecting mail on

this campus."
Though as I continued my thought
experiment — and as my wait passed
the 30-minute mark — I found this ex
planation partially unsatisfying. Per
haps if Helge's Mailing Service set up
shop next door, the post office would
open up a few more counters. But it's
not as if in the absence of such compe
tition the post office is a bloated bas
tion ol bureaucratic government ineffi
ciency. In my experience, its employ
ees have been friendly and seem to be
constantly occupied.
So what's the problem? It was when
I hit this cognitive barrier that I decided
to outsource my quandary and to issue
the following challenge. Management
science and engineering students, con
sider the gauntlet to have been thrown,
because I have uncovered your next
project: What can you do to the post of
fice so that next time I go I won't have
to wait 40 minutes to mail a letter?
To be fair, I have come across two
people who have said that they have
"good luck" with the post office and
routinely show up when there are only
one or two people in line.
But do not let their anomalous ex

periences mask the true extent of the
problem. It has become standard to
delay important mailings on days you
don't have time to cope with the line, to
put off package pick-ups until you get
the random issue of YM in your P.O
box that will amuse you during the tor
tuous wait, and maybe even to just not
mail things at all. At least that's what I
tell my mom.
So something's gotta give. Maybe
the rise of Amazon.com has single
handedly overburdened the campus
postal infrastructure and it hasn't yet
been able to restructure to adapt to this
change in the market. Maybe there
have always been long lines and no one
started complaining 'till the building's
side door broke. But anyway way you
cut it, you know your business has a
problem when finance-averse history
majors walk in and start thinking like
one of the Bobs from "Office Space."
So, to the post office powers that be,
I'll tell you a secret. I really don't care
much about the broken door. And
that's not just because my P.O. box is
right in front so I've never even come
across the infamous broken door. If
you really want to make your con
sumers happy, relieve them from the
pain of involuntary pondering funda
mental questions of political economy
once they set foot inside your walls.
Embrace the groups of MS&E kids I'm
sure will be rushing your way any day
now, and make your campus of Ama
zon.com junkies smile.

I'll tell you a secret. I really don't care
much about the broken door. And
that's not just because my P.O. box is
right in front so I've never even come
across the infamous broken door. If
you really want to make your con
sumers happy, relieve them from the
pain of involuntary pondering funda
mental questions of political economy
once they set foot inside your walls.
Embrace the groups of MS&E kids I'm
sure will be rushing your way any day
now, and make your campus of Ama
zon.com junkies smile.

Quite frankly, I don't give a
hoot about the door. Sure,
having to walk those extra
10 yards through the U.S.
ce is an irksome inconve
nience, hut let's be honest. You chose
lo attend a school with a campus that
needs to be navigated with golf carts
— you knew you what you were get
ting into.
No, no, no, it's not the door that gets
my goat. It's that damn line.
I don't think it's ever not there.
Ever. And I've tried to avoid it. Roll in
at 10 a.m.? Line. Late lunchtime,
bumping up with the 1:15 class block?
Line. Let's not talk about the situation
post 4 p.m., because that's when I start
thinking about what it would have
been like to live in Eastern Europe
under communism.
I've never experienced a bread line,
so I'm not sure if the campus post office
situation is really an exact parallel. But
I imagine it's pretty close.
Last week, when I waited in line for
over half an hour to pick up an Ama
zon.com package, I partook in this very
thought experiment. Basically it was
the only way for me to keep myself
from going postal as I stood with the
green slip looking wistfully at the pack
age pickup window that was so unfor
tunately closed. And I was not alone.
As I looked back at the line of at least
15 other people who had begun to ritu
alistically check their watches with
sighs of frustration and bewilderment,
1 was comforted. I hadn't yet resorted
to their restrained pacing, so there was
hope for me yet.
That is when I came to the conclu
sion that every economics student at
Stanford should be required to spend at
least a day in the post office, simply to
hone their appreciation of competitive
markets. In my 20 years of life, I have

come across no single more compelling
demonstration of the value of capital
ism than our campus post office.
The Daily has itself alluded to this
when, in a rare moment of unabashed
economic liberalism (or conservatism...

ah, the complicated
lingo of politics), it
editorialized earlier
this month, "The
Postal Service is un
fortunately a gov
ernment-chartered
monopoly, and
there is no alterna
tive means of
collecting mail on

this campus."
Though as I continued my thought
experiment — and as my wait passed
the 30-minute mark — I found this ex
planation partially unsatisfying. Per
haps if Helge's Mailing Service set up
shop next door, the post office would
open up a few more counters. But it's
not as if in the absence of such compe
tition the post office is a bloated bas
tion ol bureaucratic government ineffi
ciency. In my experience, its employ
ees have been friendly and seem to be
constantly occupied.
So what's the problem? It was when
I hit this cognitive barrier that I decided
to outsource my quandary and to issue
the following challenge. Management
science and engineering students, con
sider the gauntlet to have been thrown,
because I have uncovered your next
project: What can you do to the post of
fice so that next time I go I won't have
to wait 40 minutes to mail a letter?
To be fair, I have come across two
people who have said that they have
"good luck" with the post office and
routinely show up when there are only
one or two people in line.
But do not let their anomalous ex

periences mask the true extent of the
problem. It has become standard to
delay important mailings on days you
don't have time to cope with the line, to
put off package pick-ups until you get
the random issue of YM in your P.O
box that will amuse you during the tor
tuous wait, and maybe even to just not
mail things at all. At least that's what I
tell my mom.
So something's gotta give. Maybe
the rise of Amazon.com has single
handedly overburdened the campus
postal infrastructure and it hasn't yet
been able to restructure to adapt to this
change in the market. Maybe there
have always been long lines and no one
started complaining 'till the building's
side door broke. But anyway way you
cut it, you know your business has a
problem when finance-averse history
majors walk in and start thinking like
one of the Bobs from "Office Space."
So, to the post office powers that be,
I'll tell you a secret. I really don't care
much about the broken door. And
that's not just because my P.O. box is
