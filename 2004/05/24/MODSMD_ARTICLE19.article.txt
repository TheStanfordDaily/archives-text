# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## White lions and the undead 
### 
Well, it's time for another
edition of "Really Bad
Ideas" in action. With
"Friends" and "Fraiser"
departed from television, panic has
struck the TV-watching populace.
People are preparing for the entertain
ment apocalypse. They are hoarding
goods, snatching DVDs of seasons past
and have begun to worship TiVo like a
golden idol. Somewhere, somebody is
praying to the gods of syndication.
TV executives at NBC are hoping
that Siegfried and Roy will become
their savior. Now, I bet you are asking,
"Siegfried and Roy? I thought one was
injured by a tiger and their Vegas show
was canceled; how are they going to be
on TV?"
My reaction to the news was pretty
similar. Only, I thought something
more like this: "Siegfried and Roy?
Didn't they get eaten by tigers? Are
their undead corpses going to host a
show? That's awesome — undead
German magicians!"
Fortunately (unfortunately?), 1
was way off, and, as usual, poorly in
formed. It seems that yes, Siegfried
and Roy are getting a show, and no, we
don't get to see the tiger bite marks. It
will be animated. (Although, if you
write in, we could probably get a show
with undead German magicians on
the air.)
If you know TV history at all, you
know that very few animated prime
time shows are successful. "The Simp

sons," the annoying but enduring
"King of the Hill," and — fora while
at least — "Family Guy" were the
only exceptions. NBC hopes to change
all that by putting on an animated
show starring Siegfried and Roy and

their lions.
According to
NBC, the lions
will be the stars of
the show. If you
thought John
Goodman hasn't
been on TV fora
while, fear no
more, because he
voices the lead
lion, a guy named

Larry. Larry is the head of his pride.
Thus, spawning the name "Father of
the Pride." If you thought the name
wasn't a big enough joke to base a TV
show on, you don't work for NBC.
In addition to the lions, the show
also stars a lovable gopher, voiced by
Orlando Jones. Some would call him a
wannabe Chris Tucker. But that's un
derestimating his range as an actor.
First 7-Up commercials, then the cine
matic gem "Evolution" and now voic
ing a gopher: Orlando Jones is certain
ly a jack of all trades.
If the horrific name, the curse of
being a prime time animated show and
the fact that half of your star power is
Orlando Jones isn't enough, you also
have the plot of the show to deal with.
The creator of the show apparently

went to enough Siegfried and Roy
shows to begin pondering, "Hey, 1
wonder what those lions do behind
closed doors?" I'm sure most people
have thought that, only replacing the
words "those lions" with "Siegfried
and Roy."
But I'll indulge this exec and let's
see where he leads us with these
lions. Well, they are a family of lions.
A family with different, conflicting,
utterly hilarious personalities.
There's a father-in-law who is over
bearing, and if that weren't enough,
there's potential conflict between the
two kids (cubs) and the two parents.
They interact with each other in dif
ferent situations, and you, in turn,
laugh. They are calling it a purr-fect
family sitcom — Haha!
Actually, the entire thing sounds
rather stupid to me. And I'm guessing
the majority of you readers feel the
same. Family sitcoms are family sit
coms, no matter how much animation
and how many German magicians you
throw in the mix. I'm no pop culture
expert, but I'm guessing this family
lion sitcom is going to fail. Unless, of
course, the entire family's argument
turns into: "Which part of Roy should
we devour next?"

Chris Holt wishes Roy a speedy recov
ery front his tiger attack. He also won
ders if the tiger could possibly work on
that NBC executive. E-mail complaints
