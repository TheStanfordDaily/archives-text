Op-ed misrepresented prof's
work in Chile
Kelly Wells's op-ed ("Prof s work in
Chile wasn't benign," May 17) is incor
rect and misleading.
Selecting some features of Chile's
labor code, she writes, "... Strikes
were limited to 60 days." I suspect that
what Wells is alluding to is that employ
ers in Chile were not permitted to use
replacement workers until 60 days of a
strike had elapsed.
By contrast, in the United States, ex
cept for disputes over unfair labor prac
tices, employers are permitted to use
replacement workers on the first day of
a strike. If Wells's language is adopted,
then strikes in the United States are
"limited" to one day.
Wells writes, "Scabs and employer
lockouts were also legalized, and the
government maintained the right to
prohibit any strike for reasons of 'na
tional security'." Again, a contrast with
the United States might be helpful. As
is well known, replacement workers
("scabs") and employer lockouts are
legal in the United States. In addition,
U.S. labor law allows the president to
mandate a "cooling-off" period in the
event of a strike designated as a nation
al emergency.
In these and other respects, what
Chile's labor code required in 1980 has
parallels in U.S. labor law today. Wells
may deplore these features of U.S.
labor law, but they have been an inte
gral part of U.S. labor law for over 50
years, and by censuring them, she re
veals how far she is from the main
stream in this country.
The goal of the young Harvard doc
torate who served as Chilean minister
of labor in 1979 was to introduce a fair
and efficient collective bargaining sys
tem that would outlive the military gov
ernment. And, save for amendments
here and there, it has. Though there
have been modifications, the basic
framework for collective bargaining
has lasted for 24 years, most of them
under successive democratic govern
ments. The system has become linked
with democracy.
A dispassionate analysis of Chile's
labor markets over the past 40 years is
contained in an article by Sebastian Ed
wards and Alexandra Cox-Edwards in
"Economic Policy" in April 2000
(http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/facul
ty/sebastian.edwards/labor_chile.pdf).
In accounting for the decline in unem
ployment in Chile, the Edwards con

clude, "The reductions in unemploy
ment persistence, and in the natural rate
of unemployment, appear to have been
largely the result of the reforms to the
collective bargaining process."
Their work emphasizes that an
evaluation of the laws surrounding
collective bargaining should be con
cerned not only with the procedures
that are specified but also with the
consequences of the laws. Other
things equal, I prefer a system that has
the effect of raising real wages and re
ducing unemployment.
I have argued with anyone who will
listen that regulations on collective bar
gaining should avoid two common
types of regimes: one is the regime that
bestows exceptional favors on unions;
and the second is the regime that be
stows exceptional favors on employers,
suppressing or undermining unionism.
Instead, I have argued in favor of a reg
ulatory system in which, as far as possi
ble, the state adopts a hands-off posture
with respect to collective bargaining
and it fosters a system in which deci
sion-making is decentralized.
The state should not be partisan and
encourage the resolution of disputes at
the level of the firm or place of work. I
applaud a vigorous and robust labor
union movement in which the locus of
authority is at the workplace. How Wells
can describe this policy approach as one
"which advocates an extremely restric
tive role for unions" is astonishing.

Readers respond to op-ed on
Stanford's living wage campaign
Irony is bittersweet, isn't it? After
seeing Athalie Laguerre's gag article
on the practicality of majors at Stanford
("Toward a more practical degree,"
May 20), we see academia at work in
Nate Hilger's argument against a living
wage at Stanford ("Stanford should re
sist labor action coalition's living wage
campaign," May 20). Well, the problem
with "real world" majors (such as the
elementary economics behind Hilger's
argument) is that, more often than not,
they discount many "real world" com
plicating factors for the sake of clarity.
For instance, in reading Hilger's ar
ticle, you would think that elite univer
sities face perfect competition, but they
don't. There are a few big players who
have been around for decades, and they
normally follow each other's lead on

things like labor policy. The last time I
checked, the United States was not out
sourcing college students in masse to
Saipan and Panama due to the rising
cost of an education.
Secondly, Hilger's assertion that be
cause an increase in wages will displace
low-skilled workers with higher-skilled
ones is fairly simplistic. I highly doubt
that someone with a college degree will
be rushing out to clean up some kid's
vomit in one of Stanford's many dormi
tories, houses and apartments. Frankly,
most people living in America with the
skills to avoid manual labor will probably
do so under almost any circumstance.
Lastly, Hilger's claim that a living
wage is "charity" strikes me as igno
rance of the cruelest kind. This sort of
argument has been heard since the im
plementation of modest labor stan
dards during the early 20th century.
Why should we give "them" any
more? They already have enough as it
is. The reality is that most of the people
who attend Stanford as students will
not have to worry about not being able
to maintain basic health care for them
selves and their loved ones, or to afford
transportation to and from work once
they graduate.
I would invite any who really ques
tions the necessity of a living wage to
take a low-skilled job at the local mar
ket rate and try to live fora year without
any supplemental income or assets.
Just one year, by yourself. Then come
talk to me about charity and the neces
sity of taking an advanced level eco
nomics course.
TRISTAN IVORY

Nate Hilger's article ("Stanford
should resist labor action coalition's liv
ing wage campaign," May 20) ignores
the basic ethical foundation for the liv
ing wage movement.
First of all, the living wage campaign
operates on the assumption that ex
ploitation is wrong and that fair busi
ness practices are worth the extra cost
incurred. Yes, lower wages are favored
in the market, but the market should
not be — and never has been — the
only regulatory measure. That's what
government and, in this case the Uni
versity administration, is for. Sweat
shops and child labor, for example, are
favored in a market economy because
they deliver the goods at the lowest pos
sible cost. However, they are they are

also highly unethical, for which reason
they have been made illegal in the Unit
ed States. At least here, the argument
that "a sweatshop job is better than no
job" also doesn't hold up.
While Stanford is, thankfully, better
than a sweatshop, the living wage
movement — which extends far be
yond Stanford and has resulted in im
proved labor conditions in several
major U.S. cities (including New York.
Chicago, San Francisco and Los Ange
les) — simply says that we can, and
must, do even better. It is unacceptable
for workers at our University — with
its $12.2 billion endowment — to be
earning poverty wages.
I challenge the smartest Stanford
students to find a way to make $8.50 an
hour stretch to cover rent, groceries,
medical care, childcare and trans
portation in Silicon Valley. What
kinds of choices would you have to
make? Fall behind on rent, in order to
see a doctor? Cut back on groceries to
pay for daycare?
Hilger also makes the argument
that a higher living wage would raise
service costs, thereby deterring promis
ing but economically disadvantaged
potential applicants who, with a Stan
ford education, might "make extreme
ly meaningful contributions to the wel
fare of society." How are we to learn
the ethical principals on which to make
these meaningful contributions if we
take for granted that our education is
more important than other people's
livelihoods? Can we exploit workers in
the name of potential future contribu
tions to society?
Could you pay for your education
on $8.50 an hour?
KELLY WELLS

Nate Hilger's article ("Stanford
should resist labor action coalition's liv
ing wage campaign," May 20) reduces
the Stanford administration to mere
apologists for the labor injustices that
occur on our campus — as if Stanford
were no more than a victim of "the sys
tem" and there were nothing to be done.
This not only relieves the Stanford ad
ministration of responsibility for its own
labor practices, but it also shirks any re
sponsibility the administration has to the
communities outside of "the Stanford
Bubble" where our workers live.
Stanford's failure to be an ethical
employer not only affects the lives of in
dividual employees and their families.

hut also the health and well-being of the
community at large. Stanford (includ
ing Stanford Hospital) is the largest em
ployer in Santa Clara county, with over
18,000 directly-hired and subcontract
ed workers. While most permanent, di
rectly-hired service workers at Stan
ford earn a living wage, there are signif
icant numbers of temporary and sub
contracted employees that earn far
below even $10.10 per hour, the living
wage specified in University President
Hennessy's living wage policy (which
itself falls far below the California Bud
get Project's regional estimates).
It is these workers, like the workers
in Luttickin's Cafe in the Medical Cen
ter who earn $6.75 per hour, or "tem
porary" workers in Wilbur Dining and
other dining halls who earn $8 per hour
without benefits, whose pay falls below
even the most conservative estimates of
a living wage.
The majority of subcontracted and
temp workers are women and people
of color who live in low-income com
munities in East Palo Alto, East Menlo
Park, Redwood City or Mountain
View. Stanford's failure to ensure that
these employees are paid a living wage
creates an added burden on these low
income communities, which must find
ways provide subsidized housing,
healthcare and other services.
While Hilger claims that paying
higher wages will encourage higher
skilled workers to apply (thus keeping
the effects of our living wage policy
from actually reaching the poorest
workers), this theory does not hold in
the case of low-skilled service jobs,
where more experience rarely trans
lates to higher wages and employers re
quire neither experience nor previous
training of new workers. Neglecting to
provide a living wage amounts to con
ceding that Stanford has no responsibil
ity either to its own workforce or sur
rounding communities.
While the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) s asking fora living
wage and affordable benefits for all
Stanford employees, this request is part
of our larger vision fora Code of Con
duct for labor practices at Stanford.
One of the principle tenets of the Code
of Conduct is "Equal pay for equal
work," so that subcontracted and tem
porary employees who perform the
same labor as directly-hired permanent
employees earn the same wages and
benefits. However, the Code of Con
duct also attempts to address employ
ees' right to organize and the provision

of educational and training services.
Together, these initiatives could im
prove not only the lives of the workers
themselves but also their communities.

Some thoughts on the contemporary
university president
University President Emeritus Ger
hard Casper is the author of sequential
columns in The Stanford Daily
("Teacher Talk: The jobs of a universi
ty professor, parts I and II," March 29 &
31). Casper enumerates nine of his jobs,
the first of which relates to athletics and
the next, in turn, are characterized as
the CEO of a major institution, protec
tor of the endowment and fundraiser.
A fifth job is cited at the beginning of
part 11, namely that of an educator, with
apt reference to the vital interplay here
between students, faculty, staff, par
ents, the public and himself. The latter
job truly challenges a president, the
principal University spokesperson,
who should and can rely on expert fi
nancial/legal advice to be informed
about anticipated returns on invest
ments, etc. Since education is the raison
d'etre of a university, this must head the
list of a president's jobs, with athletics
well down the list.
Prof. Casper quotes Former Presi
dent of the University of California
Clark Kerr, as saying that "a university
president's job was to provide parking
for the faculty, sex for the students and
football for the alumni." It is interesting
to contrast this comment, whose date
and context are not specified, with
some 1963 lectures at Harvard Univer
sity by Kerr about the president's re
sponsibilities. The Chronicle of Higher
Education Review published excerpts
from these lectures in its Dec. 19,2003
issue, and quoted Kerr as saying, "The
president in the multiversity is leader,
educator, creator, initiator, wielder of
power, pump: he is also officer-holder,
caretaker, inheritor, consensus-seeker,
persuader, bottleneck. But he is mostly
a mediator."
Much has changed in the academic
scene (notably in the number of women
who have become university presidents)
during the 40 years since Kerr offered his
views, though their overall merit and rel
evance can still be appreciated.

Readers respond to op-ed on
Stanford's living wage campaign
Irony is bittersweet, isn't it? After
seeing Athalie Laguerre's gag article
on the practicality of majors at Stanford
("Toward a more practical degree,"
May 20), we see academia at work in
Nate Hilger's argument against a living
wage at Stanford ("Stanford should re
sist labor action coalition's living wage
campaign," May 20). Well, the problem
with "real world" majors (such as the
elementary economics behind Hilger's
argument) is that, more often than not,
they discount many "real world" com
plicating factors for the sake of clarity.
For instance, in reading Hilger's ar
ticle, you would think that elite univer
sities face perfect competition, but they
don't. There are a few big players who
have been around for decades, and they
normally follow each other's lead on

things like labor policy. The last time I
checked, the United States was not out
sourcing college students in masse to
Saipan and Panama due to the rising
cost of an education.
Secondly, Hilger's assertion that be
cause an increase in wages will displace
low-skilled workers with higher-skilled
ones is fairly simplistic. I highly doubt
that someone with a college degree will
be rushing out to clean up some kid's
vomit in one of Stanford's many dormi
tories, houses and apartments. Frankly,
most people living in America with the
skills to avoid manual labor will probably
do so under almost any circumstance.
Lastly, Hilger's claim that a living
wage is "charity" strikes me as igno
rance of the cruelest kind. This sort of
argument has been heard since the im
plementation of modest labor stan
dards during the early 20th century.
Why should we give "them" any
more? They already have enough as it
is. The reality is that most of the people
who attend Stanford as students will
not have to worry about not being able
to maintain basic health care for them
selves and their loved ones, or to afford
transportation to and from work once
they graduate.
I would invite any who really ques
tions the necessity of a living wage to
take a low-skilled job at the local mar
ket rate and try to live fora year without
any supplemental income or assets.
Just one year, by yourself. Then come
talk to me about charity and the neces
sity of taking an advanced level eco
nomics course.
TRISTAN IVORY

Nate Hilger's article ("Stanford
should resist labor action coalition's liv
ing wage campaign," May 20) ignores
the basic ethical foundation for the liv
ing wage movement.
First of all, the living wage campaign
operates on the assumption that ex
ploitation is wrong and that fair busi
ness practices are worth the extra cost
incurred. Yes, lower wages are favored
in the market, but the market should
not be — and never has been — the
only regulatory measure. That's what
government and, in this case the Uni
versity administration, is for. Sweat
shops and child labor, for example, are
favored in a market economy because
they deliver the goods at the lowest pos
sible cost. However, they are they are

also highly unethical, for which reason
they have been made illegal in the Unit
ed States. At least here, the argument
that "a sweatshop job is better than no
job" also doesn't hold up.
While Stanford is, thankfully, better
than a sweatshop, the living wage
movement — which extends far be
yond Stanford and has resulted in im
proved labor conditions in several
major U.S. cities (including New York.
Chicago, San Francisco and Los Ange
les) — simply says that we can, and
must, do even better. It is unacceptable
for workers at our University — with
its $12.2 billion endowment — to be
earning poverty wages.
I challenge the smartest Stanford
students to find a way to make $8.50 an
hour stretch to cover rent, groceries,
medical care, childcare and trans
portation in Silicon Valley. What
kinds of choices would you have to
make? Fall behind on rent, in order to
see a doctor? Cut back on groceries to
pay for daycare?
Hilger also makes the argument
that a higher living wage would raise
service costs, thereby deterring promis
ing but economically disadvantaged
potential applicants who, with a Stan
ford education, might "make extreme
ly meaningful contributions to the wel
fare of society." How are we to learn
the ethical principals on which to make
these meaningful contributions if we
take for granted that our education is
more important than other people's
livelihoods? Can we exploit workers in
the name of potential future contribu
tions to society?
Could you pay for your education
on $8.50 an hour?
KELLY WELLS

Nate Hilger's article ("Stanford
should resist labor action coalition's liv
ing wage campaign," May 20) reduces
the Stanford administration to mere
apologists for the labor injustices that
occur on our campus — as if Stanford
were no more than a victim of "the sys
tem" and there were nothing to be done.
This not only relieves the Stanford ad
ministration of responsibility for its own
labor practices, but it also shirks any re
sponsibility the administration has to the
communities outside of "the Stanford
Bubble" where our workers live.
Stanford's failure to be an ethical
employer not only affects the lives of in
dividual employees and their families.

hut also the health and well-being of the
community at large. Stanford (includ
ing Stanford Hospital) is the largest em
ployer in Santa Clara county, with over
18,000 directly-hired and subcontract
ed workers. While most permanent, di
rectly-hired service workers at Stan
ford earn a living wage, there are signif
icant numbers of temporary and sub
contracted employees that earn far
below even $10.10 per hour, the living
wage specified in University President
Hennessy's living wage policy (which
itself falls far below the California Bud
get Project's regional estimates).
It is these workers, like the workers
in Luttickin's Cafe in the Medical Cen
ter who earn $6.75 per hour, or "tem
porary" workers in Wilbur Dining and
other dining halls who earn $8 per hour
without benefits, whose pay falls below
even the most conservative estimates of
a living wage.
The majority of subcontracted and
temp workers are women and people
of color who live in low-income com
munities in East Palo Alto, East Menlo
Park, Redwood City or Mountain
View. Stanford's failure to ensure that
these employees are paid a living wage
creates an added burden on these low
income communities, which must find
ways provide subsidized housing,
healthcare and other services.
While Hilger claims that paying
higher wages will encourage higher
skilled workers to apply (thus keeping
the effects of our living wage policy
from actually reaching the poorest
workers), this theory does not hold in
the case of low-skilled service jobs,
where more experience rarely trans
lates to higher wages and employers re
quire neither experience nor previous
training of new workers. Neglecting to
provide a living wage amounts to con
ceding that Stanford has no responsibil
ity either to its own workforce or sur
rounding communities.
While the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) s asking fora living
wage and affordable benefits for all
Stanford employees, this request is part
of our larger vision fora Code of Con
duct for labor practices at Stanford.
One of the principle tenets of the Code
of Conduct is "Equal pay for equal
work," so that subcontracted and tem
porary employees who perform the
same labor as directly-hired permanent
employees earn the same wages and
benefits. However, the Code of Con
duct also attempts to address employ
ees' right to organize and the provision

of educational and training services.
Together, these initiatives could im
prove not only the lives of the workers
themselves but also their communities.

Some thoughts on the contemporary
university president
University President Emeritus Ger
hard Casper is the author of sequential
columns in The Stanford Daily
("Teacher Talk: The jobs of a universi
ty professor, parts I and II," March 29 &
31). Casper enumerates nine of his jobs,
the first of which relates to athletics and
the next, in turn, are characterized as
the CEO of a major institution, protec
tor of the endowment and fundraiser.
A fifth job is cited at the beginning of
part 11, namely that of an educator, with
apt reference to the vital interplay here
between students, faculty, staff, par
ents, the public and himself. The latter
job truly challenges a president, the
principal University spokesperson,
who should and can rely on expert fi
nancial/legal advice to be informed
about anticipated returns on invest
ments, etc. Since education is the raison
d'etre of a university, this must head the
list of a president's jobs, with athletics
well down the list.
Prof. Casper quotes Former Presi
dent of the University of California
Clark Kerr, as saying that "a university
president's job was to provide parking
for the faculty, sex for the students and
football for the alumni." It is interesting
to contrast this comment, whose date
and context are not specified, with
some 1963 lectures at Harvard Univer
sity by Kerr about the president's re
sponsibilities. The Chronicle of Higher
Education Review published excerpts
from these lectures in its Dec. 19,2003
issue, and quoted Kerr as saying, "The
president in the multiversity is leader,
educator, creator, initiator, wielder of
power, pump: he is also officer-holder,
caretaker, inheritor, consensus-seeker,
persuader, bottleneck. But he is mostly
a mediator."
Much has changed in the academic
scene (notably in the number of women
who have become university presidents)
during the 40 years since Kerr offered his
views, though their overall merit and rel
evance can still be appreciated.
HAROLD LE VINE

Op-ed misrepresented prof's
work in Chile
Kelly Wells's op-ed ("Prof s work in
Chile wasn't benign," May 17) is incor
rect and misleading.
Selecting some features of Chile's
labor code, she writes, "... Strikes
were limited to 60 days." I suspect that
what Wells is alluding to is that employ
ers in Chile were not permitted to use
replacement workers until 60 days of a
strike had elapsed.
By contrast, in the United States, ex
cept for disputes over unfair labor prac
tices, employers are permitted to use
replacement workers on the first day of
a strike. If Wells's language is adopted,
then strikes in the United States are
"limited" to one day.
Wells writes, "Scabs and employer
lockouts were also legalized, and the
government maintained the right to
prohibit any strike for reasons of 'na
tional security'." Again, a contrast with
the United States might be helpful. As
is well known, replacement workers
("scabs") and employer lockouts are
legal in the United States. In addition,
U.S. labor law allows the president to
mandate a "cooling-off" period in the
event of a strike designated as a nation
al emergency.
In these and other respects, what
Chile's labor code required in 1980 has
parallels in U.S. labor law today. Wells
may deplore these features of U.S.
labor law, but they have been an inte
gral part of U.S. labor law for over 50
years, and by censuring them, she re
veals how far she is from the main
stream in this country.
The goal of the young Harvard doc
torate who served as Chilean minister
of labor in 1979 was to introduce a fair
and efficient collective bargaining sys
tem that would outlive the military gov
ernment. And, save for amendments
here and there, it has. Though there
have been modifications, the basic
framework for collective bargaining
has lasted for 24 years, most of them
under successive democratic govern
ments. The system has become linked
with democracy.
A dispassionate analysis of Chile's
labor markets over the past 40 years is
contained in an article by Sebastian Ed
wards and Alexandra Cox-Edwards in
"Economic Policy" in April 2000
(http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/facul
ty/sebastian.edwards/labor_chile.pdf).
In accounting for the decline in unem
ployment in Chile, the Edwards con

clude, "The reductions in unemploy
ment persistence, and in the natural rate
of unemployment, appear to have been
largely the result of the reforms to the
collective bargaining process."
Their work emphasizes that an
evaluation of the laws surrounding
collective bargaining should be con
cerned not only with the procedures
that are specified but also with the
consequences of the laws. Other
things equal, I prefer a system that has
the effect of raising real wages and re
ducing unemployment.
I have argued with anyone who will
listen that regulations on collective bar
gaining should avoid two common
types of regimes: one is the regime that
bestows exceptional favors on unions;
and the second is the regime that be
stows exceptional favors on employers,
suppressing or undermining unionism.
Instead, I have argued in favor of a reg
ulatory system in which, as far as possi
ble, the state adopts a hands-off posture
with respect to collective bargaining
and it fosters a system in which deci
sion-making is decentralized.
The state should not be partisan and
encourage the resolution of disputes at
the level of the firm or place of work. I
applaud a vigorous and robust labor
union movement in which the locus of
authority is at the workplace. How Wells
can describe this policy approach as one
"which advocates an extremely restric
tive role for unions" is astonishing.

its $12.2 billion endowment — to be
earning poverty wages.
I challenge the smartest Stanford
students to find a way to make $8.50 an
hour stretch to cover rent, groceries,
medical care, childcare and trans
portation in Silicon Valley. What
kinds of choices would you have to
make? Fall behind on rent, in order to
see a doctor? Cut back on groceries to
pay for daycare?
Hilger also makes the argument
that a higher living wage would raise
service costs, thereby deterring promis
ing but economically disadvantaged
potential applicants who, with a Stan
ford education, might "make extreme
ly meaningful contributions to the wel
fare of society." How are we to learn
the ethical principals on which to make
these meaningful contributions if we
take for granted that our education is
more important than other people's
livelihoods? Can we exploit workers in
the name of potential future contribu
tions to society?
Could you pay for your education
on $8.50 an hour?

Nate Hilger's article ("Stanford
should resist labor action coalition's liv
ing wage campaign," May 20) reduces
the Stanford administration to mere
apologists for the labor injustices that
occur on our campus — as if Stanford
were no more than a victim of "the sys
tem" and there were nothing to be done.
This not only relieves the Stanford ad
ministration of responsibility for its own
labor practices, but it also shirks any re
sponsibility the administration has to the
communities outside of "the Stanford
Bubble" where our workers live.
Stanford's failure to be an ethical
employer not only affects the lives of in
dividual employees and their families.

hut also the health and well-being of the
community at large. Stanford (includ
ing Stanford Hospital) is the largest em
ployer in Santa Clara county, with over
18,000 directly-hired and subcontract
ed workers. While most permanent, di
rectly-hired service workers at Stan
ford earn a living wage, there are signif
icant numbers of temporary and sub
contracted employees that earn far
below even $10.10 per hour, the living
wage specified in University President
Hennessy's living wage policy (which
itself falls far below the California Bud
get Project's regional estimates).
It is these workers, like the workers
in Luttickin's Cafe in the Medical Cen
ter who earn $6.75 per hour, or "tem
porary" workers in Wilbur Dining and
other dining halls who earn $8 per hour
without benefits, whose pay falls below
even the most conservative estimates of
a living wage.
The majority of subcontracted and
temp workers are women and people
of color who live in low-income com
munities in East Palo Alto, East Menlo
Park, Redwood City or Mountain
View. Stanford's failure to ensure that
these employees are paid a living wage
creates an added burden on these low
income communities, which must find
ways provide subsidized housing,
healthcare and other services.
While Hilger claims that paying
higher wages will encourage higher
skilled workers to apply (thus keeping
the effects of our living wage policy
from actually reaching the poorest
workers), this theory does not hold in
the case of low-skilled service jobs,
where more experience rarely trans
lates to higher wages and employers re
quire neither experience nor previous
training of new workers. Neglecting to
provide a living wage amounts to con
ceding that Stanford has no responsibil
ity either to its own workforce or sur
rounding communities.
While the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) s asking fora living
wage and affordable benefits for all
Stanford employees, this request is part
of our larger vision fora Code of Con
duct for labor practices at Stanford.
One of the principle tenets of the Code
of Conduct is "Equal pay for equal
work," so that subcontracted and tem
porary employees who perform the
same labor as directly-hired permanent
employees earn the same wages and
benefits. However, the Code of Con
duct also attempts to address employ
ees' right to organize and the provision

of educational and training services.
Together, these initiatives could im
prove not only the lives of the workers
themselves but also their communities.

Some thoughts on the contemporary
university president
University President Emeritus Ger
hard Casper is the author of sequential
columns in The Stanford Daily
("Teacher Talk: The jobs of a universi
ty professor, parts I and II," March 29 &
31). Casper enumerates nine of his jobs,
the first of which relates to athletics and
the next, in turn, are characterized as
the CEO of a major institution, protec
tor of the endowment and fundraiser.
A fifth job is cited at the beginning of
part 11, namely that of an educator, with
apt reference to the vital interplay here
between students, faculty, staff, par
ents, the public and himself. The latter
job truly challenges a president, the
principal University spokesperson,
who should and can rely on expert fi
nancial/legal advice to be informed
about anticipated returns on invest
ments, etc. Since education is the raison
d'etre of a university, this must head the
list of a president's jobs, with athletics
well down the list.
Prof. Casper quotes Former Presi
dent of the University of California
Clark Kerr, as saying that "a university
president's job was to provide parking
for the faculty, sex for the students and
football for the alumni." It is interesting
to contrast this comment, whose date
and context are not specified, with
some 1963 lectures at Harvard Univer
sity by Kerr about the president's re
sponsibilities. The Chronicle of Higher
Education Review published excerpts
from these lectures in its Dec. 19,2003
issue, and quoted Kerr as saying, "The
president in the multiversity is leader,
educator, creator, initiator, wielder of
power, pump: he is also officer-holder,
caretaker, inheritor, consensus-seeker,
persuader, bottleneck. But he is mostly
a mediator."
Much has changed in the academic
scene (notably in the number of women
who have become university presidents)
during the 40 years since Kerr offered his
views, though their overall merit and rel
evance can still be appreciated.

Op-ed misrepresented prof's
work in Chile
Kelly Wells's op-ed ("Prof s work in
Chile wasn't benign," May 17) is incor
rect and misleading.
Selecting some features of Chile's
labor code, she writes, "... Strikes
were limited to 60 days." I suspect that
what Wells is alluding to is that employ
ers in Chile were not permitted to use
replacement workers until 60 days of a
strike had elapsed.
By contrast, in the United States, ex
cept for disputes over unfair labor prac
tices, employers are permitted to use
replacement workers on the first day of
a strike. If Wells's language is adopted,
then strikes in the United States are
"limited" to one day.
Wells writes, "Scabs and employer
lockouts were also legalized, and the
government maintained the right to
prohibit any strike for reasons of 'na
tional security'." Again, a contrast with
the United States might be helpful. As
is well known, replacement workers
("scabs") and employer lockouts are
legal in the United States. In addition,
U.S. labor law allows the president to
mandate a "cooling-off" period in the
event of a strike designated as a nation
al emergency.
In these and other respects, what
Chile's labor code required in 1980 has
parallels in U.S. labor law today. Wells
may deplore these features of U.S.
labor law, but they have been an inte
gral part of U.S. labor law for over 50
years, and by censuring them, she re
veals how far she is from the main
stream in this country.
The goal of the young Harvard doc
torate who served as Chilean minister
of labor in 1979 was to introduce a fair
and efficient collective bargaining sys
tem that would outlive the military gov
ernment. And, save for amendments
here and there, it has. Though there
have been modifications, the basic
framework for collective bargaining
has lasted for 24 years, most of them
under successive democratic govern
ments. The system has become linked
with democracy.
A dispassionate analysis of Chile's
labor markets over the past 40 years is
contained in an article by Sebastian Ed
wards and Alexandra Cox-Edwards in
"Economic Policy" in April 2000
(http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/facul
ty/sebastian.edwards/labor_chile.pdf).
In accounting for the decline in unem
ployment in Chile, the Edwards con

clude, "The reductions in unemploy
ment persistence, and in the natural rate
of unemployment, appear to have been
largely the result of the reforms to the
collective bargaining process."
Their work emphasizes that an
evaluation of the laws surrounding
collective bargaining should be con
cerned not only with the procedures
that are specified but also with the
consequences of the laws. Other
things equal, I prefer a system that has
the effect of raising real wages and re
ducing unemployment.
I have argued with anyone who will
listen that regulations on collective bar
gaining should avoid two common
types of regimes: one is the regime that
bestows exceptional favors on unions;
and the second is the regime that be
stows exceptional favors on employers,
suppressing or undermining unionism.
Instead, I have argued in favor of a reg
ulatory system in which, as far as possi
ble, the state adopts a hands-off posture
with respect to collective bargaining
and it fosters a system in which deci
sion-making is decentralized.
The state should not be partisan and
encourage the resolution of disputes at
the level of the firm or place of work. I
applaud a vigorous and robust labor
union movement in which the locus of
authority is at the workplace. How Wells
can describe this policy approach as one
"which advocates an extremely restric
tive role for unions" is astonishing.

Readers respond to op-ed on
Stanford's living wage campaign
Irony is bittersweet, isn't it? After
seeing Athalie Laguerre's gag article
on the practicality of majors at Stanford
("Toward a more practical degree,"
May 20), we see academia at work in
Nate Hilger's argument against a living
wage at Stanford ("Stanford should re
sist labor action coalition's living wage
campaign," May 20). Well, the problem
with "real world" majors (such as the
elementary economics behind Hilger's
argument) is that, more often than not,
they discount many "real world" com
plicating factors for the sake of clarity.
For instance, in reading Hilger's ar
ticle, you would think that elite univer
sities face perfect competition, but they
don't. There are a few big players who
have been around for decades, and they
normally follow each other's lead on

things like labor policy. The last time I
checked, the United States was not out
sourcing college students in masse to
Saipan and Panama due to the rising
cost of an education.
Secondly, Hilger's assertion that be
cause an increase in wages will displace
low-skilled workers with higher-skilled
ones is fairly simplistic. I highly doubt
that someone with a college degree will
be rushing out to clean up some kid's
vomit in one of Stanford's many dormi
tories, houses and apartments. Frankly,
most people living in America with the
skills to avoid manual labor will probably
do so under almost any circumstance.
Lastly, Hilger's claim that a living
wage is "charity" strikes me as igno
rance of the cruelest kind. This sort of
argument has been heard since the im
plementation of modest labor stan
dards during the early 20th century.
Why should we give "them" any
more? They already have enough as it
is. The reality is that most of the people
who attend Stanford as students will
not have to worry about not being able
to maintain basic health care for them
selves and their loved ones, or to afford
transportation to and from work once
they graduate.
I would invite any who really ques
tions the necessity of a living wage to
take a low-skilled job at the local mar
ket rate and try to live fora year without
any supplemental income or assets.
Just one year, by yourself. Then come
talk to me about charity and the neces
sity of taking an advanced level eco
nomics course.
TRISTAN IVORY

Nate Hilger's article ("Stanford
should resist labor action coalition's liv
ing wage campaign," May 20) ignores
the basic ethical foundation for the liv
ing wage movement.
First of all, the living wage campaign
operates on the assumption that ex
ploitation is wrong and that fair busi
ness practices are worth the extra cost
incurred. Yes, lower wages are favored
in the market, but the market should
not be — and never has been — the
only regulatory measure. That's what
government and, in this case the Uni
versity administration, is for. Sweat
shops and child labor, for example, are
favored in a market economy because
they deliver the goods at the lowest pos
sible cost. However, they are they are

also highly unethical, for which reason
they have been made illegal in the Unit
ed States. At least here, the argument
that "a sweatshop job is better than no
job" also doesn't hold up.
While Stanford is, thankfully, better
than a sweatshop, the living wage
movement — which extends far be
yond Stanford and has resulted in im
proved labor conditions in several
major U.S. cities (including New York.
Chicago, San Francisco and Los Ange
les) — simply says that we can, and
must, do even better. It is unacceptable
for workers at our University — with
its $12.2 billion endowment — to be

same labor as directly-hired permanent
employees earn the same wages and
benefits. However, the Code of Con
duct also attempts to address employ
ees' right to organize and the provision

of educational and training services.
Together, these initiatives could im
prove not only the lives of the workers
themselves but also their communities.

Some thoughts on the contemporary
university president
University President Emeritus Ger
hard Casper is the author of sequential
columns in The Stanford Daily
("Teacher Talk: The jobs of a universi
ty professor, parts I and II," March 29 &
31). Casper enumerates nine of his jobs,
the first of which relates to athletics and
the next, in turn, are characterized as
the CEO of a major institution, protec
tor of the endowment and fundraiser.
A fifth job is cited at the beginning of
part 11, namely that of an educator, with
apt reference to the vital interplay here
between students, faculty, staff, par
ents, the public and himself. The latter
job truly challenges a president, the
principal University spokesperson,
who should and can rely on expert fi
nancial/legal advice to be informed
about anticipated returns on invest
ments, etc. Since education is the raison
d'etre of a university, this must head the
list of a president's jobs, with athletics
well down the list.
Prof. Casper quotes Former Presi
dent of the University of California
Clark Kerr, as saying that "a university
president's job was to provide parking
for the faculty, sex for the students and
football for the alumni." It is interesting
to contrast this comment, whose date
and context are not specified, with
some 1963 lectures at Harvard Univer
sity by Kerr about the president's re
sponsibilities. The Chronicle of Higher
Education Review published excerpts
from these lectures in its Dec. 19,2003
issue, and quoted Kerr as saying, "The
president in the multiversity is leader,
educator, creator, initiator, wielder of
power, pump: he is also officer-holder,
caretaker, inheritor, consensus-seeker,
persuader, bottleneck. But he is mostly
a mediator."
Much has changed in the academic
scene (notably in the number of women
who have become university presidents)
during the 40 years since Kerr offered his
views, though their overall merit and rel
evance can still be appreciated.

Op-ed misrepresented prof's
work in Chile
Kelly Wells's op-ed ("Prof s work in
Chile wasn't benign," May 17) is incor
rect and misleading.
Selecting some features of Chile's
labor code, she writes, "... Strikes
were limited to 60 days." I suspect that
what Wells is alluding to is that employ
ers in Chile were not permitted to use
replacement workers until 60 days of a
strike had elapsed.
By contrast, in the United States, ex
cept for disputes over unfair labor prac
tices, employers are permitted to use
replacement workers on the first day of
a strike. If Wells's language is adopted,
then strikes in the United States are
"limited" to one day.
Wells writes, "Scabs and employer
lockouts were also legalized, and the
government maintained the right to
prohibit any strike for reasons of 'na
tional security'." Again, a contrast with
the United States might be helpful. As
is well known, replacement workers
("scabs") and employer lockouts are
legal in the United States. In addition,
U.S. labor law allows the president to
mandate a "cooling-off" period in the
event of a strike designated as a nation
al emergency.
In these and other respects, what
Chile's labor code required in 1980 has
parallels in U.S. labor law today. Wells
may deplore these features of U.S.
labor law, but they have been an inte
gral part of U.S. labor law for over 50
years, and by censuring them, she re
veals how far she is from the main
stream in this country.
The goal of the young Harvard doc
torate who served as Chilean minister
of labor in 1979 was to introduce a fair
and efficient collective bargaining sys
tem that would outlive the military gov
ernment. And, save for amendments
here and there, it has. Though there
have been modifications, the basic
framework for collective bargaining
has lasted for 24 years, most of them
under successive democratic govern
ments. The system has become linked
with democracy.
A dispassionate analysis of Chile's
labor markets over the past 40 years is
contained in an article by Sebastian Ed
wards and Alexandra Cox-Edwards in
"Economic Policy" in April 2000
(http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/facul
ty/sebastian.edwards/labor_chile.pdf).
In accounting for the decline in unem
ployment in Chile, the Edwards con

clude, "The reductions in unemploy
ment persistence, and in the natural rate
of unemployment, appear to have been
largely the result of the reforms to the
collective bargaining process."
Their work emphasizes that an
evaluation of the laws surrounding
collective bargaining should be con
cerned not only with the procedures
that are specified but also with the
consequences of the laws. Other
things equal, I prefer a system that has
the effect of raising real wages and re
ducing unemployment.
I have argued with anyone who will
listen that regulations on collective bar
gaining should avoid two common
types of regimes: one is the regime that
bestows exceptional favors on unions;
and the second is the regime that be
stows exceptional favors on employers,
suppressing or undermining unionism.
Instead, I have argued in favor of a reg
ulatory system in which, as far as possi
ble, the state adopts a hands-off posture
with respect to collective bargaining
and it fosters a system in which deci
sion-making is decentralized.
The state should not be partisan and
encourage the resolution of disputes at
the level of the firm or place of work. I
applaud a vigorous and robust labor
union movement in which the locus of
authority is at the workplace. How Wells
can describe this policy approach as one
"which advocates an extremely restric
tive role for unions" is astonishing.

Stanford's living wage campaign
Irony is bittersweet, isn't it? After
seeing Athalie Laguerre's gag article
on the practicality of majors at Stanford
("Toward a more practical degree,"
May 20), we see academia at work in
Nate Hilger's argument against a living
wage at Stanford ("Stanford should re
sist labor action coalition's living wage
campaign," May 20). Well, the problem
with "real world" majors (such as the
elementary economics behind Hilger's
argument) is that, more often than not,
they discount many "real world" com
plicating factors for the sake of clarity.
For instance, in reading Hilger's ar
ticle, you would think that elite univer
sities face perfect competition, but they
don't. There are a few big players who
have been around for decades, and they
normally follow each other's lead on

things like labor policy. The last time I
checked, the United States was not out
sourcing college students in masse to
Saipan and Panama due to the rising
cost of an education.
Secondly, Hilger's assertion that be
cause an increase in wages will displace
low-skilled workers with higher-skilled
ones is fairly simplistic. I highly doubt
that someone with a college degree will
be rushing out to clean up some kid's
vomit in one of Stanford's many dormi
tories, houses and apartments. Frankly,
most people living in America with the
skills to avoid manual labor will probably
do so under almost any circumstance.
Lastly, Hilger's claim that a living
wage is "charity" strikes me as igno
rance of the cruelest kind. This sort of
argument has been heard since the im
plementation of modest labor stan
dards during the early 20th century.
Why should we give "them" any
more? They already have enough as it
is. The reality is that most of the people
who attend Stanford as students will
not have to worry about not being able
to maintain basic health care for them
selves and their loved ones, or to afford
transportation to and from work once
they graduate.
I would invite any who really ques
tions the necessity of a living wage to
take a low-skilled job at the local mar
ket rate and try to live fora year without
any supplemental income or assets.
Just one year, by yourself. Then come
talk to me about charity and the neces
sity of taking an advanced level eco
nomics course.
TRISTAN IVORY
Senior, Comparative Studies

Nate Hilger's article ("Stanford
should resist labor action coalition's liv
ing wage campaign," May 20) ignores
the basic ethical foundation for the liv
ing wage movement.
First of all, the living wage campaign
operates on the assumption that ex
ploitation is wrong and that fair busi
ness practices are worth the extra cost
incurred. Yes, lower wages are favored
in the market, but the market should
not be — and never has been — the
only regulatory measure. That's what
government and, in this case the Uni
versity administration, is for. Sweat
shops and child labor, for example, are
favored in a market economy because
they deliver the goods at the lowest pos
sible cost. However, they are they are

also highly unethical, for which reason
they have been made illegal in the Unit
ed States. At least here, the argument
that "a sweatshop job is better than no
job" also doesn't hold up.
While Stanford is, thankfully, better
than a sweatshop, the living wage
movement — which extends far be
yond Stanford and has resulted in im
proved labor conditions in several
major U.S. cities (including New York.
Chicago, San Francisco and Los Ange
les) — simply says that we can, and
must, do even better. It is unacceptable
for workers at our University — with
its $12.2 billion endowment — to be
earning poverty wages.
I challenge the smartest Stanford
students to find a way to make $8.50 an
hour stretch to cover rent, groceries,
medical care, childcare and trans
portation in Silicon Valley. What
kinds of choices would you have to
make? Fall behind on rent, in order to
see a doctor? Cut back on groceries to
pay for daycare?
Hilger also makes the argument
that a higher living wage would raise
service costs, thereby deterring promis
ing but economically disadvantaged
potential applicants who, with a Stan
ford education, might "make extreme
ly meaningful contributions to the wel
fare of society." How are we to learn
the ethical principals on which to make
these meaningful contributions if we
take for granted that our education is
more important than other people's
livelihoods? Can we exploit workers in
the name of potential future contribu
tions to society?
Could you pay for your education
on $8.50 an hour?
KELLY WELLS
Junior, Comparative Literature
Nate Hilger's article ("Stanford
should resist labor action coalition's liv
ing wage campaign," May 20) reduces
the Stanford administration to mere
apologists for the labor injustices that
occur on our campus — as if Stanford
were no more than a victim of "the sys
tem" and there were nothing to be done.
This not only relieves the Stanford ad
ministration of responsibility for its own
labor practices, but it also shirks any re
sponsibility the administration has to the
communities outside of "the Stanford
Bubble" where our workers live.
Stanford's failure to be an ethical
employer not only affects the lives of in
dividual employees and their families.

hut also the health and well-being of the
community at large. Stanford (includ
ing Stanford Hospital) is the largest em
ployer in Santa Clara county, with over
18,000 directly-hired and subcontract
ed workers. While most permanent, di
rectly-hired service workers at Stan
ford earn a living wage, there are signif
icant numbers of temporary and sub
contracted employees that earn far
below even $10.10 per hour, the living
wage specified in University President
Hennessy's living wage policy (which
itself falls far below the California Bud
get Project's regional estimates).
It is these workers, like the workers
in Luttickin's Cafe in the Medical Cen
ter who earn $6.75 per hour, or "tem
porary" workers in Wilbur Dining and
other dining halls who earn $8 per hour
without benefits, whose pay falls below
even the most conservative estimates of
a living wage.
The majority of subcontracted and
temp workers are women and people
of color who live in low-income com
munities in East Palo Alto, East Menlo
Park, Redwood City or Mountain
View. Stanford's failure to ensure that
these employees are paid a living wage
creates an added burden on these low
income communities, which must find
ways provide subsidized housing,
healthcare and other services.
While Hilger claims that paying
higher wages will encourage higher
skilled workers to apply (thus keeping
the effects of our living wage policy
from actually reaching the poorest
workers), this theory does not hold in
the case of low-skilled service jobs,
where more experience rarely trans
lates to higher wages and employers re
quire neither experience nor previous
training of new workers. Neglecting to
provide a living wage amounts to con
ceding that Stanford has no responsibil
ity either to its own workforce or sur
rounding communities.
While the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) s asking fora living
wage and affordable benefits for all
Stanford employees, this request is part
of our larger vision fora Code of Con
duct for labor practices at Stanford.
One of the principle tenets of the Code
of Conduct is "Equal pay for equal
work," so that subcontracted and tem
porary employees who perform the
same labor as directly-hired permanent
employees earn the same wages and
benefits. However, the Code of Con
duct also attempts to address employ
ees' right to organize and the provision

of educational and training services.
Together, these initiatives could im
prove not only the lives of the workers
themselves but also their communities.
