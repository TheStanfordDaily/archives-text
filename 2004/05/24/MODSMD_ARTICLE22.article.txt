## Mark says farewell, talks overachieving 
### 
When I was in going to school
growing up. it seemed like ev
eryone who was anyone was
older than me. Then I came to
college, and three years later. 1 realize how
many people there are out there in the
world who are doing incredible things and
who also happen to be my age or younger
than I am. Far from making me feel inse
cure or unsuccessful, though, seeing my
peers or juniors out there in the adult world,
succeeding, makes me feel spectacular.
I like college, but 1 can't help feeling like
my 21-plus years on this earth have all been
spring training for the real season. Yeah,
most of us get part-time jobs and internships,
but the life of a college student remains a
charmed one. As graduation approaches,
the disconnect between college and the
working world becomes undeniable. It's a lot

easier to find someone to
take your money from
you — your college —
than it is to find someone
to let you make money off
of them — your job.
1 watched Saturday as
Zach Greinke — who's
less likely to get carded
trying to get into a young
adult nightclub than he
would trvinu to buv a case

T.V.U.U «. Ti.tf, IV. wujr
of High Life — made his major-league
debut against the Oakland A's and allowed a
grand total of two runs in five innings. Im
pressive? You bet.
So is the pro-rated $300,000 salary he's
pulling down at age 20 for doing it.
I'm not going to really delve into teen and
pre-teen entertainers, because their success
is often based on gimmickry or luck. You
can't find a 30-year-old method actor to play
small children on TV and in the movies, so
some people have to get lucky.
To cut it on a level playing field,
against the best talent of any age —
that's truly special.
But age is a tease in sports. Dozens of
Latin American baseball players age a year
or four in a single offseason, as one or more
of their falsified documents is uncovered,
and high-school draft picks earn millions be
fore they've ever proven a thing on the pro
fessional level. Countless prospects have
been rushed to the highest level in every
sports league because their age makes them
noteworthy and won them chances they
didn't deserve.
Take Freddy Adu. First off. is he really
14? I hope so. actually, because he is a big
time project. It will be years before he can
make the kind of impact he's already being
paid to make. And yet, even at 14, he shows
Hashes of an astonishing raw ability. He's oc
casionally embarrassing people twice his age
in MLS; when I was his age my big accom
plishment was graduating from junior high
(speaking of which, isn't it almost embar
rassing when your relatives want to attend
your junior high graduation? What, like I
wasn't supposed to make it? Sheesh.).
But it's not easy being a kid, and it's al
most impossible to be good enough to em
barrass people who have been doing what
you do for twice as long as you have. And if
someone who's not even really an adult can
compete at that level, their potential is limit
less. I mean. Jermaine O'Neal's ability to be
one of the least useful players in the NBA as
a teenager has propelled him to All-Star sta
tus just half a decade later; imagine where a
teenager who gets it done on the court (like
the annoying but amazing Leßron James)
will be in five years.
So look at yourself — where will you be
in five years?
Okay, not at the top of your profession.
But don't feel bad; people don't go scouting
around for the brightest young sociologists
like they do for flamethrowing lefthanders
or mobile 7-footers. It's a lot easier to be a
smooth-cheeked superstar when people are
out there trying to find you. Everyone else
has to try to stand out from the pack, from
the teeming masses of similar people with
similar skill sets.
And I think that's why I have such an
admiration for the under-21 sports royalty
— they found a way to bypass many of the
trials and tribulations faced by everyone
else their age.
Yeah, they're more gifted than most of us,
but they still had to work hard to make their
talent pay off. And. because their lives arc so
different than ours, we can admire them and
feel happy for them without jealousy.
Whether you like them or not, you have to
respect them.
And since this is my last column. I want to
thank everyone for reading and responding
to my column this volume — and all of the
content in this section. The Daily would be
nothing without your active readership.
Most of all, though. I want to express my
respect for everyone that has written and
edited for this section this volume. It's been
a tremendous pleasure — thank you.
