# NATIONAL CHAMPIONS!

### MIA R. LEE STAFF WRITER 
Not one for superstition, the top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team (29-0) had no qualms about captur
ing its 13th NCAA Team Championship with a 4-1 victo
ry over No. 8 UCLA (19-8) yesterday.
No. 23 junior Erin Burdette (25-4) brought fans to their
feet at Dan Magill Tennis Complex as she sealed success
for Stanford with an overhead smash against the Bruins'
Feriel Esseghir (14-14).
Burdette won the decisive No. 3 singles match in
straight sets, pulling out the first set win in a tiebreak
er and coming to a resounding finish in the second, 7-
6(5), 6-3.
"It's a fairy-tale ending to come home and play in front
of family and friends," said Burdette in a press release. "I
didn't play my best today, but I was able to pull through
and get it done."
Stanford head coach Lele Forood provided more in
sight into the crucial victory.
"(Esseghir'sj a tough player when she's against the wall
in a match," Forood said. "Erin was up 5-2, 40-15 in the
second set, but |Esseghir| stuck it out to force another
game. She picks her moments to be particularly good."
Stanford defeated UCLA three times in the regular
season, including a stellar 6-1 win in the quarterfinals of
National Team Indoors in February.
"When you play a team for the fourth time in a year, ev
erybody has so much information about each other that
this final didn't have a lot of the problems that [it normal
ly would] when faced with a newer opponent," Forood
said. "But we knew UCLA wasn't exactly going to cave,
either. They have a lot of good players and they're really
solid despite our [match| scores against them."
Fresh off a 4-0 shutout of fifth-seeded Clemson in the
semifinals and with nothing to lose. No. 9 seed UCLA
gave Stanford a run for its money on every court, starting
with a nail-biting showdown in doubles.
"It was very scary for about 15 minutes, as the No. 1 and
No. 3 doubles teams were down really far and No. 2 dou
bles was on par with their opponents," freshman Theresa
Logar said.
Heading the doubles lineup, the top-ranked duo of se
nior Lauren Barnikow and Burdette battled back from a
5-3 deficit against Daniela Bercek and Lauren Fisher to
break UCLA's serve at 6-all. Veterans Barnikow and Bur
dette claimed the doubles point for the Cardinal with an 8-
6 win.
"We had Erin serving to finish, which is exactly where
we wanted to be." Forood said. "We went into the locker
room all charged up. It's real nice to have that momentum
and a 1-0 lead going into the singles."
At No. 2 doubles, sophomores Alice Barnes and
Amber Liu were the first off the courts with an unprece

dented 8-3 defeat of No. 43 Jackie Carleton and Esseghir
(13-8). During the regular season, Barnes and Liu (24-4)
had struggled at No. 2 against UCLA, dropping the deci
sion all three times. But on Sunday, the Cardinal pounced
on every ball, getting exactly the shots it needed to man
age a huge win.
In singles. No. 10 Barnes went 3-0 during the week
to be named the NCAA tournament's Most Out
standing Player.
"Alice was basically doing her thing and outmatching
all of her opponents," Forood said.
In semifinal action, Barnes helped the Cardinal sweep
third-seeded Vanderbilt, topping No. 61 Kelly Schmandt
in straight sets at No. 2 singles, 6-2,6-2. Against the Com
modores, her characteristic sliced backhand and finesse

game were key in her game-winning match.
Barnes enjoyed similar results in the quarterfinals
against Duke, the seventh seed. The 5-foot-9 Cambridge,
U.K.. native made quick work of No. 112 Jennifer Zika, al
lowing her only three games in a 6-1,6-2 conquest.
Barnes is one of four regional automatic qualifiers into
the NCAA Individual Championships. She enters the
next phase of NCAAs with an impressive 37-6 record.
Hand in hand with her more experienced teammates
— Barnikow, Burdette and Liu — Logar received a berth
into the individual competition after just one season of
collegiate play. And what a season it's been — the No. 40
freshman went undefeated in the regular season, only to
top off her fifth-flight singles successes with five straight-
