### MIA R. LEE STAFF WRITER 
Not one for superstition, the top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team (29-0) had no qualms about captur
ing its 13th NCAA Team Championship with a 4-1 victo
ry over No. 8 UCLA (19-8) yesterday.
No. 23 junior Erin Burdette (25-4) brought fans to their
feet at Dan Magill Tennis Complex as she sealed success
for Stanford with an overhead smash against the Bruins'
Feriel Esseghir (14-14).
Burdette won the decisive No. 3 singles match in
straight sets, pulling out the first set win in a tiebreak
er and coming to a resounding finish in the second, 7-
6(5), 6-3.
"It's a fairy-tale ending to come home and play in front
of family and friends," said Burdette in a press release. "I
didn't play my best today, but I was able to pull through
and get it done."
Stanford head coach Lele Forood provided more in
sight into the crucial victory.
"(Esseghir'sj a tough player when she's against the wall
in a match," Forood said. "Erin was up 5-2, 40-15 in the
second set, but |Esseghir| stuck it out to force another
game. She picks her moments to be particularly good."
Stanford defeated UCLA three times in the regular
season, including a stellar 6-1 win in the quarterfinals of
National Team Indoors in February.
"When you play a team for the fourth time in a year, ev
erybody has so much information about each other that
this final didn't have a lot of the problems that [it normal
ly would] when faced with a newer opponent," Forood
said. "But we knew UCLA wasn't exactly going to cave,
either. They have a lot of good players and they're really
solid despite our [match| scores against them."
Fresh off a 4-0 shutout of fifth-seeded Clemson in the
semifinals and with nothing to lose. No. 9 seed UCLA
gave Stanford a run for its money on every court, starting
with a nail-biting showdown in doubles.
"It was very scary for about 15 minutes, as the No. 1 and
No. 3 doubles teams were down really far and No. 2 dou
bles was on par with their opponents," freshman Theresa
Logar said.
Heading the doubles lineup, the top-ranked duo of se
nior Lauren Barnikow and Burdette battled back from a
5-3 deficit against Daniela Bercek and Lauren Fisher to
break UCLA's serve at 6-all. Veterans Barnikow and Bur
dette claimed the doubles point for the Cardinal with an 8-
6 win.
"We had Erin serving to finish, which is exactly where
we wanted to be." Forood said. "We went into the locker
room all charged up. It's real nice to have that momentum
and a 1-0 lead going into the singles."
At No. 2 doubles, sophomores Alice Barnes and
Amber Liu were the first off the courts with an unprece

dented 8-3 defeat of No. 43 Jackie Carleton and Esseghir
(13-8). During the regular season, Barnes and Liu (24-4)
had struggled at No. 2 against UCLA, dropping the deci
sion all three times. But on Sunday, the Cardinal pounced
on every ball, getting exactly the shots it needed to man
age a huge win.
In singles. No. 10 Barnes went 3-0 during the week
to be named the NCAA tournament's Most Out
standing Player.
"Alice was basically doing her thing and outmatching
all of her opponents," Forood said.
In semifinal action, Barnes helped the Cardinal sweep
third-seeded Vanderbilt, topping No. 61 Kelly Schmandt
in straight sets at No. 2 singles, 6-2,6-2. Against the Com
modores, her characteristic sliced backhand and finesse

game were key in her game-winning match.
Barnes enjoyed similar results in the quarterfinals
against Duke, the seventh seed. The 5-foot-9 Cambridge,
U.K.. native made quick work of No. 112 Jennifer Zika, al
lowing her only three games in a 6-1,6-2 conquest.
Barnes is one of four regional automatic qualifiers into
the NCAA Individual Championships. She enters the
next phase of NCAAs with an impressive 37-6 record.
Hand in hand with her more experienced teammates
— Barnikow, Burdette and Liu — Logar received a berth
into the individual competition after just one season of
collegiate play. And what a season it's been — the No. 40
freshman went undefeated in the regular season, only to
top off her fifth-flight singles successes with five straight-

set wins at NCAAs.
On Sunday, Logar tore through the
serve-and-volley tactics of UCLA's Lau
ren Fisher to win, 6-3,6-4.
Despite the big win, Logar expressed
hesitation going into the match.
"Facing UCLA in the finals [actually]
put more pressure on me," Logar said. "I
was really nervous because they were the
only ones we lost the doubles point to all
season, and 1 figured the doubles point
could dictate the rest of the match."
A bit uneasy at first, Logar deferred
to Fisher's service game to go down 3-
0 in the first set. True to title-winning
form, however, Logar quickly re
gained momentum.
The owner of an individual title from
the Freeman Memorial Invitational in
Las Vegas, Logar's future looks to bright
en in coming seasons.
"It's kind of hard to imagine her play
ing [No. 5 singles) on this team, but she's
playing behind a lot of good, experi
enced players," Forood said. "She's
done a good job of outmatching her op
ponents and she's been a huge part of
our success this year. In the future, we'd
like to get her to be more of a serving
dominant player, but she's already got a
great baseline foundation."

Logar follows in the footsteps of such
players as No. 7 Liu, who heads the singles
lineup. Facing off against feisty No. 31
Daniela Bercek, Liu did not get an oppor
tunity to finish her match in the finals.
The same goes for senior Emilia An
derson, who did not get to finish against
Laura Gordon at No. 6 singles.
In their time on the courts, howev
er, both Liu and Anderson were in
good form.
Liu showed no signs of tiring in the
third set, as she broke back from a 5-1
lapse to 5-4. Meanwhile, Anderson
maintained her composure after drop
ping three set points and a tiebreak in
the first set.
Anderson struggled with doubles part
ner Anne Yelsey throughout the tourna
ment, as the duo found themselves em
broiled in long point after long point.
Though the pair failed to finish a single
match, Forood remains proud of the
progress the Cardinal has made in the
doubles arena.
Last year. Stanford could have won the
finals against Florida had they clinched
the doubles point.
"We're definitely more satisfied [this
year), but there's more work to be done,"
Forood said. "We'd like to get them to be
more instinctive and less trained [as) dou
bles players.
But when you go through the tourna
ment and win the doubles point every
day, that says something in itself."

Stanford head coach Lele Forood provided more in
sight into the crucial victory.
"(Esseghir'sj a tough player when she's against the wall
in a match," Forood said. "Erin was up 5-2, 40-15 in the
second set, but |Esseghir| stuck it out to force another
game. She picks her moments to be particularly good."
Stanford defeated UCLA three times in the regular
season, including a stellar 6-1 win in the quarterfinals of
National Team Indoors in February.
"When you play a team for the fourth time in a year, ev
erybody has so much information about each other that
this final didn't have a lot of the problems that [it normal
ly would] when faced with a newer opponent," Forood
said. "But we knew UCLA wasn't exactly going to cave,
either. They have a lot of good players and they're really
solid despite our [match| scores against them."
Fresh off a 4-0 shutout of fifth-seeded Clemson in the
semifinals and with nothing to lose. No. 9 seed UCLA
gave Stanford a run for its money on every court, starting
with a nail-biting showdown in doubles.
"It was very scary for about 15 minutes, as the No. 1 and
No. 3 doubles teams were down really far and No. 2 dou
bles was on par with their opponents," freshman Theresa
Logar said.
Heading the doubles lineup, the top-ranked duo of se
nior Lauren Barnikow and Burdette battled back from a
5-3 deficit against Daniela Bercek and Lauren Fisher to
break UCLA's serve at 6-all. Veterans Barnikow and Bur
dette claimed the doubles point for the Cardinal with an 8-
6 win.
"We had Erin serving to finish, which is exactly where
we wanted to be." Forood said. "We went into the locker
room all charged up. It's real nice to have that momentum
and a 1-0 lead going into the singles."
At No. 2 doubles, sophomores Alice Barnes and
Amber Liu were the first off the courts with an unprece

dented 8-3 defeat of No. 43 Jackie Carleton and Esseghir
(13-8). During the regular season, Barnes and Liu (24-4)
had struggled at No. 2 against UCLA, dropping the deci
sion all three times. But on Sunday, the Cardinal pounced
on every ball, getting exactly the shots it needed to man
age a huge win.
In singles. No. 10 Barnes went 3-0 during the week
to be named the NCAA tournament's Most Out
standing Player.
"Alice was basically doing her thing and outmatching
all of her opponents," Forood said.
In semifinal action, Barnes helped the Cardinal sweep
third-seeded Vanderbilt, topping No. 61 Kelly Schmandt
in straight sets at No. 2 singles, 6-2,6-2. Against the Com
modores, her characteristic sliced backhand and finesse

game were key in her game-winning match.
Barnes enjoyed similar results in the quarterfinals
against Duke, the seventh seed. The 5-foot-9 Cambridge,
U.K.. native made quick work of No. 112 Jennifer Zika, al
lowing her only three games in a 6-1,6-2 conquest.
Barnes is one of four regional automatic qualifiers into
the NCAA Individual Championships. She enters the
next phase of NCAAs with an impressive 37-6 record.
Hand in hand with her more experienced teammates
— Barnikow, Burdette and Liu — Logar received a berth
into the individual competition after just one season of
collegiate play. And what a season it's been — the No. 40
freshman went undefeated in the regular season, only to
top off her fifth-flight singles successes with five straight-

set wins at NCAAs.
On Sunday, Logar tore through the
serve-and-volley tactics of UCLA's Lau
ren Fisher to win, 6-3,6-4.
Despite the big win, Logar expressed
hesitation going into the match.
"Facing UCLA in the finals [actually]
put more pressure on me," Logar said. "I
was really nervous because they were the
only ones we lost the doubles point to all
season, and 1 figured the doubles point
could dictate the rest of the match."
A bit uneasy at first, Logar deferred
to Fisher's service game to go down 3-
0 in the first set. True to title-winning
form, however, Logar quickly re
gained momentum.
The owner of an individual title from
the Freeman Memorial Invitational in
Las Vegas, Logar's future looks to bright
en in coming seasons.
"It's kind of hard to imagine her play
ing [No. 5 singles) on this team, but she's
playing behind a lot of good, experi
enced players," Forood said. "She's
done a good job of outmatching her op
ponents and she's been a huge part of
our success this year. In the future, we'd
like to get her to be more of a serving
dominant player, but she's already got a
great baseline foundation."

Logar follows in the footsteps of such
players as No. 7 Liu, who heads the singles
lineup. Facing off against feisty No. 31
Daniela Bercek, Liu did not get an oppor
tunity to finish her match in the finals.
The same goes for senior Emilia An
derson, who did not get to finish against
Laura Gordon at No. 6 singles.
In their time on the courts, howev
er, both Liu and Anderson were in
good form.
Liu showed no signs of tiring in the
third set, as she broke back from a 5-1
lapse to 5-4. Meanwhile, Anderson
maintained her composure after drop
ping three set points and a tiebreak in
the first set.
Anderson struggled with doubles part
ner Anne Yelsey throughout the tourna
ment, as the duo found themselves em
broiled in long point after long point.
Though the pair failed to finish a single
match, Forood remains proud of the
progress the Cardinal has made in the
doubles arena.
Last year. Stanford could have won the
finals against Florida had they clinched
the doubles point.
"We're definitely more satisfied [this
year), but there's more work to be done,"
Forood said. "We'd like to get them to be
more instinctive and less trained [as) dou
bles players.
But when you go through the tourna
ment and win the doubles point every
day, that says something in itself."
The Cardinal continues in action today
with the start of the NCAA Individual
Championships.
Not one for superstition, the top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team (29-0) had no qualms about captur
ing its 13th NCAA Team Championship with a 4-1 victo
ry over No. 8 UCLA (19-8) yesterday.
No. 23 junior Erin Burdette (25-4) brought fans to their
feet at Dan Magill Tennis Complex as she sealed success
for Stanford with an overhead smash against the Bruins'
Feriel Esseghir (14-14).
Burdette won the decisive No. 3 singles match in
straight sets, pulling out the first set win in a tiebreak
er and coming to a resounding finish in the second, 7-
6(5), 6-3.
"It's a fairy-tale ending to come home and play in front
of family and friends," said Burdette in a press release. "I
didn't play my best today, but I was able to pull through
and get it done."
