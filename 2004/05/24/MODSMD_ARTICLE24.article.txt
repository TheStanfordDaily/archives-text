# Women earn trip to College World Series
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The first time the Cardinal softball team earned
a trip to the Women's College World Series, the
year was 2001. Stanford earned its berth by win
ning its NCAA Regional Championship behind
gutsy pitching by its sophomore ace, Dana
Sorensen, who started all five games in the 2001
NCAA Regional.
Yesterday was deja vu all over again as
Sorensen, now a redshirt senior, allowed a com
bined three hits in back-to-back complete games
on the final day of Regional play at Boyd and Jill
Smith Family Stadium as the No. 6 Cardinal soft
ball team (47-17) advanced to the WCWS in Ok
lahoma City for the second time in the history of
the program.
The top-seeded Cardinal defeated eighth-seed
ed Utah (23-32) on Thursday, 1-0, fourth seed Pa
cific (46-19) on Friday, 7-2, and seventh seed Hof
stra (38-21) on Saturday, 7-1, before falling to
Hofstra, 1-0, early yesterday to set up a winner
take-all final game later that afternoon — which
Stanford captured, 3-1.
"I always dreamed of going to the College
World Series," said junior first baseman Leah Nel
son. "And to finally go, well, it's just a dream come
true. It really is."
The Cardinal could have advanced to the World
Series with a victory over Hofstra in Sunday's first
game due to the double-elimination format of the
NCAA Regional, but when Dana Sorensen hit
Hofstra center fielder Lisa Torres with a pitch with
the bases loaded in the bottom of the seventh in
ning to force in the winning run, the Pride took
home a victory and set up the final game between
the Cardinal and the Pride.
In Sunday's first game, Sorensen took a no-hitter
into the final inning but still lost because of dismal
run support from the Cardinal, which rapped out five
hits but was unable to manufacture any runs in the 1 -

0 loss. Sunday's final game was starting to look like his
tory repeating itself as the Cardinal had five hits but no
runs to show for itself going into the bottom of the
fourth inning. Then junior first baseman Leah Nelson
ended the Cardinal scoring drought, leading off the bot
tom of the fourth with a towering home run to deep left
field. Nelson's blast cleared the buildings beyond the
outfield fence and energized the Cardinal as the team
poured out of its dugout to greet a triumphant Nelson
at home plate.
Junior third baseman Liz Bendig followed up Nelson's
homer with a single and later scored the Cardinal's second
run of the inning on a double by junior right fielder Kather
ine Hoffman. Sophomore center fielder Catalina Morris
led off the Cardinal fifth with a home run to right field to
give the Cardinal a 3-0 lead — which was plenty for
Sorensen, who pitched a two-hitter to pick up her 32nd win
of the season.
Pride center fielder Kelly Morris grounded out to
third base with two outs in the top of the seventh in
ning to end the game, Sorensen hugged sophomore
shortstop Lauren Lappin while the entire Stanford
team mobbed the center of the field, jumping and hug
ging in celebration of the team's accomplishment.
After pitching 14 innings in just five hours, Sorensen
was tired but upbeat in a post-game press conference.
"By the end of the game, I was ready to win at all
costs," she said. "My legs were tired, but in the end,
you have to trust yourself and your pitches."
Cardinal head coach John Rittman was ecstatic
after Sunday's victory.
"I'm still kind of numb," he said after the final
game. "I'm extremely proud of the way the team bat
tled today. My hat goes off to Hofstra. They're not a
number seven seed by any means.
"Today our kids hung tough. We had trouble scor
ing even though we got hits, and we finally just need
ed to hit one out of the park and give Dana a run, and
of course that's what Leah did."

ors. Senior catcher Jessica Allister, Nel
son and freshman Jackie Rinehart were
named to the All-Regional Team, and
Sorensen was named Most Valuable
Player for the Regional Tournament.
Regarding the upcoming World
Series, Coach Rittman emphasized
the unpredictability of the eight
team tournament.

"It's so hard to get to the World Se
ries now." he said. "There is just so
much parity in college softball nowa
days. We need to enjoy this. The fact is,
we feel that we have unfinished busi
ness, but we have to respect every sin
gle team we play."
Sorensen. who has World Series ex
perience from starting three games in
Oklahoma City in 2001, emphasized
that for the Cardinal, the journey was
not yet over.
"The first time. I felt kind of like a
kid in a candy store," she said. "But
this time, we know all the teams, and
we know what we have to do."
