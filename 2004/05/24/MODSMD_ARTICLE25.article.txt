Montgomery is known for taking a
previously moribund program to new
heights. Under him, Stanford made 12
NCAA Tournaments and 4 NIT Tour
naments, and posted a record of 393-
167.

"Stanford University provided me
and my family with an unbelievable op
portunity 18 years ago and the time we
spent here has been phenomenal,"
Montgomery said. "I have thoroughly
enjoyed working with the top student
athletes in the nation, the best coaching
staff in the country and the top overall
athletic program . . . there are many
people and many things I will miss about
Stanford."

contract would expire after the 2007-

Montgomery's Stanford contract ran.
"We're thrilled to bring a coach the
caliber of Mike Montgomery into the
fold," Mullin said. "He's regarded as
one of the best teachers in the game and,
with the way our roster is currently con
structed, he will certainly have the
chance to share his wisdom with a young
core of players who are eager to learn."
For his part. Montgomery is excited
about the challenge of resurrecting a

Warriors teams that hasn't made the
playoffs since the mid-19905.

how excited I am," he said. "The more

this was the right thing ... I feel really
prepared for it."
