### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
It's official.
Mike Montgomery announced his
resignation as head coach of the men's
basketball team on Friday. Mont
gomery. who coached for 18 years on
the Farm, was named head coach of the
NBA s Golden State Warriors.
Montgomery is known for taking a
previously moribund program to new
heights. Under him, Stanford made 12
NCAA Tournaments and 4 NIT Tour
naments, and posted a record of 393-
167.

"Stanford University provided me
and my family with an unbelievable op
portunity 18 years ago and the time we
spent here has been phenomenal,"
Montgomery said. "I have thoroughly
enjoyed working with the top student
athletes in the nation, the best coaching
staff in the country and the top overall
athletic program . . . there are many
people and many things I will miss about
Stanford."
Montgomery's hire in Oakland was
engineered by Warriors Executive Vice
President of Basketball Operations
Chris Mullin. Although terms were not
disclosed, the AP and other national

sources have reported that Mont
gomery's contract is for four years and is
worth approximately $10 million. Such a
contract would expire after the 2007-
2008, the same season through which
Montgomery's Stanford contract ran.
"We're thrilled to bring a coach the
caliber of Mike Montgomery into the
fold," Mullin said. "He's regarded as
one of the best teachers in the game and,
with the way our roster is currently con
structed, he will certainly have the
chance to share his wisdom with a young
core of players who are eager to learn."
For his part. Montgomery is excited
about the challenge of resurrecting a

Warriors teams that hasn't made the
playoffs since the mid-19905.
"1 am really excited, I cannot tell you
how excited I am," he said. "The more
[Mullin] and 1 talked, the more I knew
this was the right thing ... I feel really
prepared for it."
Montgomery has won numerous hon
ors for his work with the Cardinal. He
received the prestigious John R. Wood
en "Legends of Coaching" Lifetime
Achievement Award this year, was hon
ored as Pacific-10 Conference Coach of
the Year in 1999, 2000, 2003 and this
year, and has twice been tabbed by Bas-
ketball Times as National Coach of the Year
(2000 and this year).
"Mike Montgomery has been a tremendous
coach, mentor, teacher and ambassador of
Stanford University for the past 18 years," said
Stanford Director of Athletics Ted Leland.
"His record of success speaks for itself."
Yet for all his success, and his undeniable
status as one of the best coaches in the college
game, there was always one piece of Stanford
basketball lore that Montgomery could never
outdo. Prior to Montgomery, the Cardinal had
just one NCAA Tournament appearance â€”
but that team won the 1942 national champi
onship.
The closest Montgomery came was the Final
Four in 1998, although he did win an NIT cham
pionship in 1991.
This year's Cardinal squad went 30-2, win
ning its first 26 games and holding the top spot
in the national polls for most of the year, but
fell hard to Alabama in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament.
Although he and his players would have
liked to win a national title this year, Mont
gomery felt like now was the time to make a ca
reer transition.
"I don't feel like I am walking away from
something," Montgomery said. "I don't feel
like 1 left the job not completed. I feel like I
have done my job there."
