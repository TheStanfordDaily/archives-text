# Baseball takes rubber game, beats USC 8-2
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Jonny Ash's reappearance in the lineup gave the reeling
Stanlord baseball team just the boost it needed.
The senior third baseman, who had missed 15 previous games
with a broken left index finger, returned this weekend against
Southern California and made quite a difference.
His presence was especially crucial Sunday, when he man
aged three hits and four RBIs to lead the Cardinal offense as
Stanford took the rubber game from USC, 8-2.
The Cardinal and Trojans had split the first two games of the
series, with LJSC winning, 9-3, on Friday and Stanford prevail
ing, 5-4, in dramatic-fashion Saturday.
With the win and Washington's 4-3 loss to UCLA in Seattle,
Stanlord moved into first place in the conference and controls
its own destiny in the race for the league title.
With third-place Arizona State coming to Palo Alto for the
last conference series of the year, Stanford (42-11, 14-7 Pacific
-10 Conference) is a half-game ahead of the Huskies (15-9 in con
ference), who have already completed their portion of the
league schedule.
This is how it shapes up: win one, and share the conference
title. Win two and win the conference outright. Lose all three,
and Arizona State and Washington would share the crown.
"We're in control, and you can't ask for any more than that,"
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said.
Freshman Matt Leva (5-1) pitched four hitless innings in a
pre-determined pitching rotation and picked up the win.
The win yesterday was a big win in many ways for Stanford,
which had been struggling without Ash in the second spot of the
order.
Without Ash for three weeks, the Cardinal lost almost as
many as they had all season prior to the injury (five) and fell in
back-to-back series for the first time all year.
Had they lost yesterday, Stanford would have lost three
straight conference series for the first time in 11 years.
But Ash made sure that didn't happen, with a two-run triple
and a pair of run-scoring singles â€” all with two outs. In total.
Ash had six hits, four runs scored and four RBIs during the
weekend.
"Jonny was our offense," Marquess said. "We've been incon
sistent and getting him back was a big lift."
Ash hurt himself trying to bunt April 20 against St. Mary's
when a pitch ricocheted off his left index finger, fracturing it
completely.
He went to the doctor and got the finger put in a splint for
three weeks. The injury required no operation, so he let his fin
ger heal naturally.
Every so often. Ash would swing a bat with his bottom hand
(right hand) to keep it strong for when he returned.

Eventually, X-rays showed the finger was healing fine, so the
team doctor cleared him to play on Tuesday.
Ash swung with both hands off the tee early in the week, then
took live batting practice for the first time in weeks Thursday.
Then, the next night, he went out and had three hits, including
two doubles, in five at-bats in a losing cause.
Ash said he was more concerned about catching the ball than
anything else, because "the ball can hit my glove and that can vi
brate throughout my whole hand and hurt."
But Ash's left hand showed no ill effects when he made a nice
backhand stop-and-throw across the diamond to retire the sec
ond Trojan batter of the game yesterday.
Marquess said they knew the coaching staff hadn't planned
on throwing Leva for more than four innings, so taking him out
even though the freshman hadn't allowed a hit was a no-brain
er.
"We knew he gets tired then," Marquess said. "And 1 was re
luctant last weekend [at Arizona when Leva struggled the sec
ond time through the lineup]."
Stanford scored first when shortstop Chris Minaker hit a
bloop double to left that dropped in front of USC right fielder
Cyle Hankerd. Donny Lucy scored from second and a hustling
Ryan Seawell came all the way around from first as Minaker got
to second.
After Sam Fuld walked. Ash plated both Minaker and Fuld
with a triple over the head of Hankerd, and Stanford was off and
rolling.
Stanford added two insurance runs in the eighth when Ash
scored from third on a dropped fly ball and Brian Hall had a
two-out, run-scoring single.
Hall's two hits in his last two at-bats helped him snap out of
4-for-30 slump.
Saturday's game was full of dramatics, including a suicide
squeeze, a steal of home and a showcase of Fuld's speed.
With the Cardinal trailing by one run with two outs and
pinch-runner Chris Lewis on second, Fuld smashed a pitch up
the middle into center field fora run-scoring single.
But USC centerfielder Daniel Perales charged the ball hard,
hoping fora play on Lewis at the plate, but instead had it go un
derneath his glove and roll past him.
In the interim, Fuld tore around the bases and eventually
scored the game-winning run before Perales could get the ball to
the plate.
Friday, Stanford ace Mark Ronianczuk was battered for
seven earned runs and 10 hits in 6 1 / 3 innings and could not re
cover since the Cardinal offense could not muster much against
Trojans starter lan Kennedy.
The opening game of the crucially important series against
Arizona State starts Friday at 6 p.m. Stanford will host its annu
al fireworks show after the game.
