# Series win places Stanford atop conference standings
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The top-ranked Cardinal's series win this week
end over Southern California catapulted the base
ball team back into a familiar spot — first place in
the Pacific-10 Conference.
While Stanford was busy trouncing the Trojans,
UCLA had the tricky task of topping Washington in
Seattle. After splitting the first two games of the se
ries — UCLA won 3-1 on Friday, while the Huskies
gained a 7-2 victory on Saturday — the Bruins eked
out a 4-3 win.
The Bruins' series win combined with the Cardi
nal's effort against USC lifted Stanford back to the
top of the conference standings, a half-game ahead
of Washington.
"What's huge for us is that we got two sweeps. We
beat Berkeley here and then Washington State," said
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess. "It's just as big to
win them then as it is to win them late in the season."
Since the Huskies' loss to UCLA ends their league
schedule, the Cardinal is in control for its final week of
Pac-10 play. If Stanford can take at least 2-of-3 from
Arizona State next weekend, it will claim the confer
ence crown outright. If the Sun Devils win 2-of-3, the
Cardinal and the Huskies will share the league title.

And if ASU can pull off a little magic and grab a sweep
at Sunken Diamond, the Sun Devils and the Huskies
will tie for first, with the Cardinal in third place.
"It's in our hands, but that's the way we always play,"
said junior left fielder Danny Putnam.
Cardinal pitchers come back to life
Senior closer David O'Hagan called the Stanford
bullpen implosion during last week's series loss in Tuc
son, Ariz., a wake-up call. After the hurlers' collection
of strong outings this weekend against USC, it's clear
that the pitching staff is wide awake.
Freshman Matt Leva and sophomore Jeff Gilmore
put in stunning starting performances on the mound
yesterday and Saturday, respectively, after both strug
gled in their starts last week. O'Hagan captured the win
Saturday night after taking a hard loss at Arizona.
Sophomore Matt Manship shut the door for the Cardi
nal in yesterday's win, though he was among many re
lievers that could barely get batters out in Arizona.
The turnaround paid off.
"Coach Marquess always reminds us that baseball
is not easy," O'Hagan said. "When it starts to feel
easy, you can get out ahead of your skis a little bit.
This game is going to humble you. That's what hap
pened in Tucson."

O'Hagan said that while it's unfortunate to need a
wake-up call during the season, it couldn't have hap
pened at a more opportune moment, as the postseason
is drawing closer.
"We've got to get back to the basics," O'Hagan said.
"We have the ability, but obviously, last weekend we
weren't taking care of simplistic tasks."
Stanford hitters play small ball in
series win
Though power-hitting is the most well-known
weapon of the Cardinal offense, the Trojans didn't see
too much of it — not one Stanford batter managed to
hit a home run.
"This weekend, the wind was blowing a little more,
so we were trying to keep the ball out of the air," Put
nam said.
Which means that Stanford showed off its lesser
known but equally potent small-ball game. Sacrifice
flies, smart baserunning and key hits in the right places
became the undoing of the Trojan team.
Sophomore shortstop Chris Minaker laid down
the perfect example of the Cardinal offense's situa
tional hitting on Saturday afternoon, when he tapped
a perfect one-out suicide squeeze up the first base
line to score senior Brian Hall from third and give

Stanford a go-ahead run.
"It's about doing the little things right," Putnam said.
"That pays off in the end."
Sunday rubber game draws
season-high attendance
Anyone that has ever called a baseball game boring
has probably never watched the Cardinal push to victo
ry in a packed Sunken Diamond on a breezy May day.
A combination of Stanford's annual Youth Base
ball Day and the great weather attracted a season
high attendance of 3,499. The seats were full of
yelling, clapping fans in Cardinal red T-shirts and
young baseball players in full uniform appeared ev
erywhere in the park.
The Cardinal showed its appreciation for the mass of
fans after the game as the players all participated in an
autograph-signing session.
O'Hagan said that it was especially fun to have all of
the younger fans out for the game.
"It's great when the weather is good," O'Hagan said.
"You can go get a suntan out on the hill, and it's great to
have all of these people out here."
Added Putnam: "You can really feel the energy of
the crowd. It makes you feel like it's a little bit of a big
ger deal. We love our fans."
