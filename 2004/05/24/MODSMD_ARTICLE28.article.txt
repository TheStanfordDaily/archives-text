## Summer months bring higher risk of sexual assault 
### ANNA UHLS COLORADO DAILY 
(U-WIRE) BOULDER, Colo. — As summer
approaches and it gets warmer, the time people
spend outdoors will increase. Unfortunately, so
will sexual assaults.
"Without even looking at the statistics, 1 know
that the number of sexual assault cases is definitely
higher during the summer months," said Boulder Po
lice Sgt. Kerry Yamaguchi.
Authorities say there are several reasons why sexual
assaults will be more common in the next few months.
"In the summer, people often leave windows and
doors open and unlocked, and in terms of inviting the
wrong person into your home, that's a big invitation,"
said Boulder Police Crime Analyst Melanie Rhamey.
"People will get drunk at night during the summer
and the suspects will do dangerous things," Yamaguchi
said. "People will also be more likely to be walking than
driving, which could lead to bad instances."
But if mere situations present opportunities for sexu
al assaults, the motivations of perpetrators play a more
sinister role in the attacks.
" The motivations for sexual assaults are varied and
complex," said Marti Hopper, the Adult Prevention Ed
ucation Coordinator for MESA (Moving to End Sexual
Assaults) in Boulder. "Sometimes I hear people say that
rape is about power and control — this is way too sim
plistic. Sometimes I also hear that it is about sex; this is
also usuallv untrue."

Hopper cited some attackers' motivations as being
their hatred of women, the desire for power — in "terms
of playing and trying to win a game," a sense of male en
titlement, peer pressure on men to get sex and on occa
sion, the simple and inexplicable motive of sadism.
"Mostly when you do a psychological test, nothing
pops out where you can identify them as a rapist," Hop
per said. "You have to more look at the cultural context.
Our society trains boys to be the sexual aggressors, in
which more sex is better. And because of gender and
equality issues, some men also feel entitled to this sex."
Hopper listed several false traits that people think
characterize sexual offenders, such as being mentally
ill, being a stranger, carrying a weapon and causing a
brutal injury.
She said some of the true characteristics of rapists in
clude very sexist beliefs and a strong proclivity to use al
cohol. Rapists. Hopper said, can come from all racial and
ethnic groups and usually prefer to attack someone in
that same racial group.
Hopper said 85 percent of attackers are acquain
tances of their victims.
With this in mind, the Boulder Police Department has
issues of safety to think about for this summer.
Deputy Chief of the Boulder Police Dave Hayes said
the police will not add more staff to the force during the
summer months. But because of the warmer weather,
police are more likely to be out on foot at bike paths and
near isolated areas where attacks are more likely to
occur, Hayes said.
"This summer our officers will be looking for sus

picious activity, looking for people that may not fit,
and will he looking out fora person that may he fol
lowing someone," Hayes said. "We also do provide
specific training [to officers] for the investigation of
sex assaults."
But Hayes also said the police can't he everywhere at
the same time, so there are things people can do to help
prevent such attacks this summer.
"The safest thing to do is to go in pairs," Hayes said.
"Being hy yourself is usually not a good idea, especially
later at night when visibility is reduced. Be aware of your
surroundings. If you are going from point A to point B,
look for the most public way to get there."
Rhamey also had some suggestions to the residents of
Boulder on how to avoid an attack.
"Make sure your home is secured — particularly if
you are living on the ground level or basement. That is
one of the places that are hit more often with every kind
of intrusion," Rhamey said.
Rhamey echoed Hayes in the admonishment for
women to travel in groups if they can.
"I never recommend that women walk alone at
night. I think we all still think this is a small town, but it
isn't anymore, so be careful. I would also say not to
drink at excess so that you can't make good decisions.
This probably puts you in more danger than about any
thing else," Rhamey said.
In 2002, 40 percent of the forcible rapes involved al
cohol and 4 percent involved drugs, Rhamey reported.
Hopper disagreed with the prevailing notion that
women are the controlling agents in preventing sexual

assaults.
"People say women should stay inside — it should
be the men attackers that have to stay inside," Hop
per said. "This is not rape prevention, that is only
rape avoidance."
Although the locations of sexual assaults vary all
around the city, both Yamaguchi and Rhamey men
tioned the university campus and University Hill areas as
having higher numbers of attacks.
"Probably there are more cases in the University Hill
area," Rhamey said. "But these are not stranger rapes;
this is just where the younger population, who is more
likely to be victimized, is located in town. It is also more
densely populated, so that's where they [perpetrators]
are going to show up."
In the horrible event that one is attacked, there are
some things that can be done, experts say.
"They should do whatever they can to get away from
that person and call attention to what is going on," Hayes
said. "But I don't think that rule applies in every circum
stance, because if somebody is armed with a deadly
weapon, there is an individual decision that victim has to
make about what will make the situation better or
worse."
Finally, Hayes said he didn't want the public to be
worried about the "bogeyman" being around every cor
ner, but he does want people to be careful.
"We don't want people to always think something is
going to happen, but it certainly should be in the back of
all of our minds," said Hayes. "There are people out
there that want to do bad things. Just be cautious."

picious activity, looking for people that may not fit,
and will he looking out fora person that may he fol
lowing someone," Hayes said. "We also do provide
specific training [to officers] for the investigation of
sex assaults."
But Hayes also said the police can't he everywhere at
the same time, so there are things people can do to help
prevent such attacks this summer.
"The safest thing to do is to go in pairs," Hayes said.
"Being hy yourself is usually not a good idea, especially
later at night when visibility is reduced. Be aware of your
surroundings. If you are going from point A to point B,
look for the most public way to get there."
Rhamey also had some suggestions to the residents of
Boulder on how to avoid an attack.
"Make sure your home is secured — particularly if
you are living on the ground level or basement. That is
one of the places that are hit more often with every kind
of intrusion," Rhamey said.
Rhamey echoed Hayes in the admonishment for
women to travel in groups if they can.
"I never recommend that women walk alone at
night. I think we all still think this is a small town, but it
isn't anymore, so be careful. I would also say not to
drink at excess so that you can't make good decisions.
This probably puts you in more danger than about any
thing else," Rhamey said.
In 2002, 40 percent of the forcible rapes involved al
cohol and 4 percent involved drugs, Rhamey reported.
Hopper disagreed with the prevailing notion that
women are the controlling agents in preventing sexual

assaults.
"People say women should stay inside — it should
be the men attackers that have to stay inside," Hop
per said. "This is not rape prevention, that is only
rape avoidance."
Although the locations of sexual assaults vary all
around the city, both Yamaguchi and Rhamey men
tioned the university campus and University Hill areas as
having higher numbers of attacks.
"Probably there are more cases in the University Hill
area," Rhamey said. "But these are not stranger rapes;
this is just where the younger population, who is more
likely to be victimized, is located in town. It is also more
densely populated, so that's where they [perpetrators]
are going to show up."
In the horrible event that one is attacked, there are
some things that can be done, experts say.
"They should do whatever they can to get away from
that person and call attention to what is going on," Hayes
said. "But I don't think that rule applies in every circum
stance, because if somebody is armed with a deadly
weapon, there is an individual decision that victim has to
make about what will make the situation better or
worse."
Finally, Hayes said he didn't want the public to be
worried about the "bogeyman" being around every cor
ner, but he does want people to be careful.
"We don't want people to always think something is
going to happen, but it certainly should be in the back of
all of our minds," said Hayes. "There are people out
there that want to do bad things. Just be cautious."
(U-WIRE) BOULDER, Colo. — As summer
approaches and it gets warmer, the time people
spend outdoors will increase. Unfortunately, so
will sexual assaults.
"Without even looking at the statistics, 1 know
that the number of sexual assault cases is definitely
higher during the summer months," said Boulder Po
lice Sgt. Kerry Yamaguchi.
Authorities say there are several reasons why sexual
assaults will be more common in the next few months.
"In the summer, people often leave windows and
doors open and unlocked, and in terms of inviting the
wrong person into your home, that's a big invitation,"
said Boulder Police Crime Analyst Melanie Rhamey.
"People will get drunk at night during the summer
and the suspects will do dangerous things," Yamaguchi
said. "People will also be more likely to be walking than
driving, which could lead to bad instances."
But if mere situations present opportunities for sexu
al assaults, the motivations of perpetrators play a more
sinister role in the attacks.
" The motivations for sexual assaults are varied and
complex," said Marti Hopper, the Adult Prevention Ed
ucation Coordinator for MESA (Moving to End Sexual
Assaults) in Boulder. "Sometimes I hear people say that
rape is about power and control — this is way too sim
plistic. Sometimes I also hear that it is about sex; this is
also usuallv untrue."

Hopper cited some attackers' motivations as being
their hatred of women, the desire for power — in "terms
of playing and trying to win a game," a sense of male en
titlement, peer pressure on men to get sex and on occa
sion, the simple and inexplicable motive of sadism.
"Mostly when you do a psychological test, nothing
pops out where you can identify them as a rapist," Hop
per said. "You have to more look at the cultural context.
Our society trains boys to be the sexual aggressors, in
which more sex is better. And because of gender and
equality issues, some men also feel entitled to this sex."
Hopper listed several false traits that people think
characterize sexual offenders, such as being mentally
ill, being a stranger, carrying a weapon and causing a
brutal injury.
She said some of the true characteristics of rapists in
clude very sexist beliefs and a strong proclivity to use al
cohol. Rapists. Hopper said, can come from all racial and
ethnic groups and usually prefer to attack someone in
that same racial group.
Hopper said 85 percent of attackers are acquain
tances of their victims.
With this in mind, the Boulder Police Department has
issues of safety to think about for this summer.
Deputy Chief of the Boulder Police Dave Hayes said
the police will not add more staff to the force during the
summer months. But because of the warmer weather,
police are more likely to be out on foot at bike paths and
near isolated areas where attacks are more likely to
occur, Hayes said.
"This summer our officers will be looking for sus

picious activity, looking for people that may not fit,
and will he looking out fora person that may he fol
