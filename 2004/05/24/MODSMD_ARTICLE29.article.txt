# Students question definition of cheating
## By ERIN STOCK DAILY NORTHWESTERN 
### 
(U-WIRE) EVANSTON, 111. — Academics
and students nationwide agree that cheating is on
the rise, but not everyone agrees it is such a bad
thing — at least not in all forms.
According to a survey of 218 Northwestern un
dergraduates in Norris University Center con
ducted by The Daily Northwestern, 20 percent of
students said it is not at all wrong to copy home
work for an assignment worth a small percentage
of a course's grade.
Keith Fisher, a senior, said he has copied down
homework solutions from classmates before. A lot
of students in his classes do, he said.
"It takes a moral obligation to not buy into
copying a problem set," said Fisher, adding that
it is easy because professors allow group collab
oration. "It was a really hard thing not to do."
Music sophomore Andrew Nogal said students
in his winter quarter French class copied answers
from students in another class who had the same
assignments due a week earlier.
"I can't say it really seems that wrong to me
since the assignment due dates allowed for that
kind of assistance," Nogal said. "I consider that
exams, tests and large papers are worth more
value to the grading system, so I think that type of
cheating is worse."
According to the non-scientific survey, 76 per
cent said it's "absolutely wrong" to cheat on
exams, 22 percent said it's "somewhat wrong"
while 2 percent said it's OK to cheat on exams.
Mark Hoffman, the assistant dean for student
affairs in the School of Education and Social Poli
cy. handles cases of academic dishonesty involving
School of Education students and courses. He said
a lot of students are surprised to learn what NU
defines as cheating.
During new student orientation, Hoffman
asked a room full of freshmen if they thouiiht sub

mitting the same work for different classes with
out permission from instructors constituted cheat
ing, according to the NU handbook on academic
integrity. About half of the students incorrectly
responded. "No."
Last year, the School of Education began re
quiring new students to take a quiz on the hand
book — and land 10 out of 10 — before letting
them register for classes.
"I do not know the preparation that each of our
students received in their high schools, so this pro
vides a level of understanding," Hoffman said.
All six NU schools have their own policies re
garding academic dishonesty. Many of the
schools require students to sign honor pledges
and. beginning this past year, all new students had
to attend academic integrity orientation.
Other universities employ different tactics to
deter cheating. At Stanford University, proctor
ing is not allowed. Course instructors and teaching
assistants must leave the room during exams, and
if students have questions, they go into the hall to
ask professors for help.
"[When the policy was adopted] it was per
ceived that there would be enough trust and
respect between students and faculty that fac
ulty would not have to monitor." said George
Wilson, Stanford's program coordinator for
judicial affairs.
But Wilson said some students report a lot of
cheating still goes on. Many of them say the sys
tem is too trusting, he said.
NU's undergraduate student body is only
about 7,800. Weinberg School of Arts and Sci
ences administrators reported 62 cases of under
graduate cheating in courses last year and more
than 57 this year.
That is an increase of more than 130 percent
from the 1998-99 academic year.
The University of Virginia is known for its
unique student-run honor committee and one
strike-you're-out policy. For example, if Vir

ginia students are found to have used the same
paper for two classes without instructor permis
sion, they most likely will be expelled, said
Nicole Eramo, a special assistant to the honor
committee at Virginia.
Students, not administrators, decide these
policies at Virginia. Every four years a referen
dum is held to vote on the no tolerance rule, and
although the system is highly debated, the com
mittee has continued to support it.
"Generally the thinking is that students are
more likely to buy into the process if it's a student
run system." Eramo said.
Despite the hard-nosed policy, Virginia has ex
perienced an increase in the instances of academ
ic dishonesty in the past few years, Eramo said.
She added that there have been 47 cases investi
gated this year in a student body of 19.000 under
graduate and graduate students.
When students are accused of cheating at
NU, they meet with an associate dean from the
school where the cheating allegedly occurred.
The dean investigates the case, interviews the
student and determines whether academic dis
honesty occurred.
If the dean decides it has, the student is sub
ject to sanctions, from a letter of warning to
permanent expulsion from the university.
Some professors have found ways to thwart
cheating before it comes to that. Students sit
every other seat during exams, professors
pass out multiple copies of a test and some
professors even require students to scan their
WiIdCARDs to confirm their identity before
taking exams.
Even if students aren't caught, they will
suffer consequences, said Stephen Carr, the
associate dean of undergraduate engineer
ing in McCormick.
"Whether [cheating] gets caught or not, the
price is being paid," Carr said. "No learning oc
curred when the student finally resorted to that."

and students nationwide agree that cheating is on
the rise, but not everyone agrees it is such a bad
thing — at least not in all forms.
According to a survey of 218 Northwestern un
dergraduates in Norris University Center con
ducted by The Daily Northwestern, 20 percent of
students said it is not at all wrong to copy home
work for an assignment worth a small percentage
of a course's grade.
Keith Fisher, a senior, said he has copied down
homework solutions from classmates before. A lot
of students in his classes do, he said.
"It takes a moral obligation to not buy into
copying a problem set," said Fisher, adding that
it is easy because professors allow group collab
oration. "It was a really hard thing not to do."
Music sophomore Andrew Nogal said students
in his winter quarter French class copied answers
from students in another class who had the same
assignments due a week earlier.
"I can't say it really seems that wrong to me
since the assignment due dates allowed for that
kind of assistance," Nogal said. "I consider that
exams, tests and large papers are worth more
value to the grading system, so I think that type of
cheating is worse."
According to the non-scientific survey, 76 per
cent said it's "absolutely wrong" to cheat on
exams, 22 percent said it's "somewhat wrong"
while 2 percent said it's OK to cheat on exams.
Mark Hoffman, the assistant dean for student
affairs in the School of Education and Social Poli
cy. handles cases of academic dishonesty involving
School of Education students and courses. He said
a lot of students are surprised to learn what NU
defines as cheating.
During new student orientation, Hoffman
asked a room full of freshmen if they thouiiht sub

mitting the same work for different classes with
out permission from instructors constituted cheat
ing, according to the NU handbook on academic
integrity. About half of the students incorrectly
responded. "No."
Last year, the School of Education began re
quiring new students to take a quiz on the hand
book — and land 10 out of 10 — before letting
them register for classes.
"I do not know the preparation that each of our
students received in their high schools, so this pro
vides a level of understanding," Hoffman said.
All six NU schools have their own policies re
garding academic dishonesty. Many of the
schools require students to sign honor pledges
and. beginning this past year, all new students had
to attend academic integrity orientation.
Other universities employ different tactics to
deter cheating. At Stanford University, proctor
ing is not allowed. Course instructors and teaching
assistants must leave the room during exams, and
if students have questions, they go into the hall to
ask professors for help.
"[When the policy was adopted] it was per
ceived that there would be enough trust and
respect between students and faculty that fac
ulty would not have to monitor." said George
Wilson, Stanford's program coordinator for
judicial affairs.
But Wilson said some students report a lot of
cheating still goes on. Many of them say the sys
tem is too trusting, he said.
NU's undergraduate student body is only
about 7,800. Weinberg School of Arts and Sci
ences administrators reported 62 cases of under
graduate cheating in courses last year and more
than 57 this year.
That is an increase of more than 130 percent
from the 1998-99 academic year.
The University of Virginia is known for its
unique student-run honor committee and one
strike-you're-out policy. For example, if Vir

ginia students are found to have used the same
paper for two classes without instructor permis
sion, they most likely will be expelled, said
Nicole Eramo, a special assistant to the honor
committee at Virginia.
Students, not administrators, decide these
policies at Virginia. Every four years a referen
dum is held to vote on the no tolerance rule, and
although the system is highly debated, the com
mittee has continued to support it.
"Generally the thinking is that students are
more likely to buy into the process if it's a student
run system." Eramo said.
Despite the hard-nosed policy, Virginia has ex
perienced an increase in the instances of academ
ic dishonesty in the past few years, Eramo said.
She added that there have been 47 cases investi
gated this year in a student body of 19.000 under
graduate and graduate students.
When students are accused of cheating at
NU, they meet with an associate dean from the
school where the cheating allegedly occurred.
The dean investigates the case, interviews the
student and determines whether academic dis
honesty occurred.
If the dean decides it has, the student is sub
ject to sanctions, from a letter of warning to
permanent expulsion from the university.
Some professors have found ways to thwart
cheating before it comes to that. Students sit
every other seat during exams, professors
pass out multiple copies of a test and some
professors even require students to scan their
WiIdCARDs to confirm their identity before
taking exams.
Even if students aren't caught, they will
suffer consequences, said Stephen Carr, the
associate dean of undergraduate engineer
ing in McCormick.
"Whether [cheating] gets caught or not, the
price is being paid," Carr said. "No learning oc
curred when the student finally resorted to that."
