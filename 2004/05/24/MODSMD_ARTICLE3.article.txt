# Constitutional Council members resign
## 
### ANTHONY HA MANAGING EDITOR 
Three members of the ASSU Constitutional
Council have announced their intention to re
sign from their positions. The Council is now
three members short of a quorum and cannot
hear any cases until new members have been
appointed; these members may need to be se
lected soon because former ASSU vice presi
dential candidate Dylan Mefford, a junior, is
currently collecting signatures to bring a third
case before the Council contesting the Under
graduate Senate's refusal to certify the April 7-
8 executive election.
Council member Howard Chiou, a junior,
said that he and fellow Council members
Monica Henestroza and Robert Rudnitsky,
both graduate students, reached their deci
sions independently.
"I've thought really hard about my decision
and talked to lots of different people," Chiou
said. "This is not a decision that was made on
the fly."
Chiou, Henestroza and Rudnitsky de
clined to comment on the reasons behind
their resignations.
The appointment of Council members is
normally made by the ASSU president and

confirmed by the Undergraduate Senate and
by the Graduate Student Council. However,
Henestroza noted that the Senate now faces a
conflict of interest because it would likely be a
respondent in the potentially forthcoming case.
"What the Senate would have to weigh is a
conflict of interest on one hand if they do ap
point someone — although, at the same time,
GSC would also be part of the confirmation
process — and on other hand, what you have is
constitutional crisis in which the new case can
not be heard," she said. "It'll be up to them to
choose between two bad options."
Henestroza added, "I'm hopeful that they'll
be able to find someone who can give the case
a fair hearing, someone with ASSU experience
and a firm commitment to the students."
Sources connected with the Council said
that Chiou and Henestroza's resignations
stemmed largely from a frustration with re
cent cases, in particular from a belief that the
petitioners have been using the Council to
further the interests of individual members of
the ASSU rather than that of the student
body as a whole.
Senior Mikey Lee, whose executive victory
has been rejected twice by the Senate, denied
that the cases brought before the Council were
used to advance personal interests.

"Many of the senators would search for
ways to not certify the first election results
anyway," he said. "It's disappointing to hear
that these [reasons] might be the reasons for
their [Chiou and Henestroza's] resignations,
and I hope that the two of them do release of
ficial statements."
Lee added, "The case at hand is not about
our desire to take office, but more a matter of
principle; we feel that because our second case
was not fairly heard-out by the Council."
Chiou emphasized that the resignations
should not be seen as denigrating the impor
tance of the Council's work.
"The Council is a critical part of the ASSU,"
he said. "These decisions should be seen as
something separate, not as an indicator of that.
I do hope really good candidates will be able to
fill our positions as soon as possible."
During last night's meeting, the Council also
finalized its May 11 ruling rejecting Mefford's
suit. First, the Council ruled that an ASSU by
law could not be ruled unconstitutional just be
cause it could potentially be abused in an un
constitutional manner. Second, the Council
ruled that "the petitioner failed to meet his
burden of proof by failing to address the ratio
nale provided by Undergraduate Senate during
its deliberation."
