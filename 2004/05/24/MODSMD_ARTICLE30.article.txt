# UCs admit too many students, study shows

### ELYSHA TENENBAUM DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) SAN FRANCISCO
— A highly anticipated statewide
study revealed Wednesday that
the University of California may
be accepting far more students
than it is supposed to under Cali
fornia guidelines, a finding that
could force the UC Board of Re
gents to redefine eligibility stan
dards this year.
About 14.4 percent of the state's
graduating high school class were
academically eligible for UC, up from
11.1 percent the last time the study
was performed eight years ago, ac
cording to the California Postsec
ondary Education Commission.
Applicants become eligible for
UC by meeting base grade point av
erage and testing requirements.
"We're not surprised by this num
ber," said MRC Greenwood, UC
provost and senior vice president for
academic affairs. "14.4 percent of the
students meeting these requirements
is not a bad thing for the UC."
The figure is nearly two percent
higher than the target set by the 44-
year-old Master Plan for Higher
Education, which guaranteed that
the top one-eighth of the state's
high school graduates would have a
place in the UC system, although
not at the campus of their choice.
Although eligibility levels for
underrepresented minorities re
main at a fraction of the levels for
Asian and white applicants, they
have close to doubled since 1996.
UC President Robert Dynes
attributed the jump to university
outreach programs and a recently
instated standard called Eligibili
ty in the Local Context, which
gives spots to the top 4 percent of
students from every high school
in the state.
Greenwood said that less than 1
percent of students accepted to UC
through the Eligibility in the Local
Context program would have oth
erwise been eligible.
Although some regents praised

the growing number of eligible stu
dents as a sign of better student per
formance, other regents were less en
thusiastic, attributing the rise to loop
holes in the admissions process.
UC Regent John Moores criti
cized another program UC im
plemented to broaden UC's
admit pool. The university allows
up to 6 percent of students to be
admitted under special excep
tions for personal talent even if
baseline test score or GPA crite
ria is not met.
Moores expressed dismay over
lenient admission requirements
during the yesterday's meeting and
chastised university leaders for not
informing the board earlier.
"It's regrettable that the UC was
overadmitting without being
aware," Moores said.
Other regents expressed doubts
about the validity of the study, ar
guing that the gap between 1996
and 2003 in data collection could
represent regular fluctuation in the
numbers. The figure also had a 4
percent margin of error.
"We need to somehow put a
measuring stick on that with
somewhat of a time frame and less
of an error margin," said UC Re
gent Peter Preuss.
The admissions data was also
anomalous given that this year was
the first time that 10 percent of UC
eligible students were asked to at
tend a community college free of
charge, with a guaranteed transfer
as part of a plan to meet budget
cuts.
As a result of the higher-than
targeted numbers, UC may have to
tighten eligibility standards over
the next several years.
UC's faculty governing body, the
Academic Senate, will make recom
mendations on possible eligibility
changes at the next meeting in July.
The board also urged more fre
quent studies on UC eligibility.
"If there's a fault here, it's that
we ran for eight years without us re
looking at what's happened,"
Dvnes said.
