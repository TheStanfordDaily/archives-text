# GPS system lets students track shuttles

### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
To reduce the time students wait
for Marguerite shuttles. Parking &
Transportation Services has
launched a comprehensive Trans
portation Management System
(TMS) for shuttle operation, includ
ing the installation of global-position
ing system equipment on each bus
that will allow students to track their
movement on a online campus map.
According to Transportation Pro
gram Manager Kevin Mathy, stu
dents can now view the operating
buses in real-time using Internet Ex
plorer or Netscape Web browsers on
an interactive campus map. The Web
site identifies the shuttle route and
displays the position of each bus.
Mathy said the program is de
signed to improve overall service to
the campus community by allowing
better trip planning and thus encour
aging the use of alternative trans
portation. Additionally, the new sys
tem ensures contract adherence by
the vendor and the data collected will
be used to make the shuttle system
more effective and efficient, he said.
Data from the vehicles is relayed via

the wireless network providing dispatchers and su
pervisors with the operational status of all the vehi
cles, trip status and passenger counts.
One Marguerite user, Stefan Tang, a grad
uate student in scientific computation and
computational math, said the new program
might not be that useful.
"It sounds like a waste of money," Tang said.
"Are they afraid someone's going to steal a bus?"

However, other Marguerite riders have used
the system to their advantage already. Jennifer
Novak, who works in the department of psychiatry
and behavioral sciences, praised the new system.
"The live route map is absolutely fabulous and
was accurate too," Novak said. "I saw a little or
ange A-line bus icon moving towards the stop in
front of my building, so I ran over to the window
and looked out. Sure enough within a minute the

A-line came by, right when it should have."
Julie DiCarlo, who works in the Magnetic
Resonance Systems Research Lab, agreed.
"As a regular Marguerite rider, thank you
for setting up the online real-time map," she
said. "This greatly helps alleviate the frustra
tion of being there at the schedule time and
not kbus is running late, or if it was early and
therefore missed."
