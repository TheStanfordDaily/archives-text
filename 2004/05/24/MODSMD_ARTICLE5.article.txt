# Ebadi speaks on democracy, human rights
## 
### ANDREW GAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Shirin Ebadi, 2003 Nobel Peace Prize Laure
ate and human-rights activist, spoke to a sellout
crowd in Memorial Auditorium on Saturday
about her experiences defending the rights of
women, children and political prisoners. A lawyer
and professor at the University of Tehran, Ebadi
discussed a wide range of issues, but focused on
democratic solutions to protect human rights and
emphasized the need for maintaining cultural
identity in an increasingly globalized world.
"Democracy and human rights are the com
mon needs of all cultures and human soci
eties," she said. "Different cultures should
search for commonalities with other cultures
while at the same time maintaining their own
unique natures. We need to identify the com
mon rights of humanity and agree upon rules to
achieve those goals."
Greeted with a standing ovation, Ebadi spoke
in Farsi that was translated into English. She was
brought to campus by the Persian Students Asso
ciation and the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
Ebadi also stressed the role of universities as
critical centers of cultural exchange.
"There is no doubt that familiarity with other
cultures will pave the way for future global
peace," she said. "I am grateful that you have so

generously shared your knowledge with my
countrymen, both the Iranian students and pro
fessors who have been at Stanford. These pro
fessors and students are in fact cultural emis
saries of Iran in America."
Ebadi's comments regarding the preserva
tion of Iranian culture led to several rounds
of applause.
"Iran is alive, not just as a place in geography,
but in the hearts and minds of every Iranian," she
said. "We live in the age of globalism, we live in an
age where borders are gradually disappearing.
Nations are no longer defined by their borders
but by their culture. If we cannot maintain our
culture and our language, we will be destroyed."
Ebadi added that democracy is the natural in
clination of developing nations.
"Democracy and human rights are the com
mon needs of all cultures and human soci
eties," she said. "Those who use the pretext of
cultural relativism to Ignore the need of
democracy and human rights are in fact reac
tionary bullies who want to hide their despot
ic nature behind a mask of culture."
Addressing the preservation of human rights,
Ebadi criticized recent U.S. antiterrorist efforts.
"Unfortunately, recently, national security has
become the newest excuse for breaking human
rights," she said. "Fighting terrorism is no doubt a
just and legitimate cause, but this fight must be

conducted in a humanitarian and just manner.
The danger of national security must not be so ex
aggerated to become an excuse for suppressing
every voice of opposition."
Ebadi was also critical of U.S. foreign policy,
pointing to actions that supported authoritarian
regimes such as the Taliban.
"During the Cold War, it was posited that only
dogmatic faith in God and in religion could stop
the spread of communism in the world," she said.
"It was based on this analysis that U.S. policy
funded fundamentalist and Islamic movements
like the Taliban. In those days, America wished
to fight its foes through Islamic fundamentalists."
Ebadi strengthened her point by comparing
aiding undemocratic governments to suicide.
Concerning the current war in Iraq, Ebadi
was highly critical of the unilateral action un
dertaken by the United States.
"If a country claims to defend democracy in
a despotic society, even if you accept that as
the premise, you cannot use the pretext of
democracy to militarily invade another coun
try," she said. "Those who consistently have a
breach of democracy and human rights must
be forced to comply with the United Nations.
Only through the United Nations is the strug
gle legitimate and defensible."

At the end of the talk, there was a round of questions
on issues ranging from Ebadi's favorite hooks to gay rights
in Iran. When asked if she was optimistic or pessimistic
about the nation's future, Ebadi said she had to be hope
ful.
"I am as a rule an optimist," she said. "We are all pas
sengers on the same ship and this ship is headed towards a
greater civilization but if any part of the ship is downed it
will hurt our progress. But I must be an optimist, because

said. "We live in the age of globalism, we live in an
age where borders are gradually disappearing.
Nations are no longer defined by their borders
but by their culture. If we cannot maintain our
culture and our language, we will be destroyed."
Ebadi added that democracy is the natural in
clination of developing nations.
"Democracy and human rights are the com
mon needs of all cultures and human soci
eties," she said. "Those who use the pretext of
cultural relativism to Ignore the need of
democracy and human rights are in fact reac
tionary bullies who want to hide their despot
ic nature behind a mask of culture."
Addressing the preservation of human rights,
Ebadi criticized recent U.S. antiterrorist efforts.
"Unfortunately, recently, national security has
become the newest excuse for breaking human
rights," she said. "Fighting terrorism is no doubt a
just and legitimate cause, but this fight must be

conducted in a humanitarian and just manner.
The danger of national security must not be so ex
aggerated to become an excuse for suppressing
every voice of opposition."
Ebadi was also critical of U.S. foreign policy,
pointing to actions that supported authoritarian
regimes such as the Taliban.
"During the Cold War, it was posited that only
dogmatic faith in God and in religion could stop
the spread of communism in the world," she said.
"It was based on this analysis that U.S. policy
funded fundamentalist and Islamic movements
like the Taliban. In those days, America wished
to fight its foes through Islamic fundamentalists."
Ebadi strengthened her point by comparing
aiding undemocratic governments to suicide.
Concerning the current war in Iraq, Ebadi
was highly critical of the unilateral action un
dertaken by the United States.
"If a country claims to defend democracy in
a despotic society, even if you accept that as
the premise, you cannot use the pretext of
democracy to militarily invade another coun
try," she said. "Those who consistently have a
breach of democracy and human rights must
be forced to comply with the United Nations.
Only through the United Nations is the strug
gle legitimate and defensible."

Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Shirin Ebadi focused her talk on the mer
its of democratic government and the defense of human rights.
At the end of the talk, there was a round of questions
on issues ranging from Ebadi's favorite hooks to gay rights
in Iran. When asked if she was optimistic or pessimistic
about the nation's future, Ebadi said she had to be hope
ful.
"I am as a rule an optimist," she said. "We are all pas
sengers on the same ship and this ship is headed towards a
greater civilization but if any part of the ship is downed it
will hurt our progress. But I must be an optimist, because
if I am not. I cannot be effective and continue my work."
