# New Law School dean discusses plans for future

After an exhaustive search. Associate Law
Dean and Prof. Larry Kramer of New York
University (NYU) has been tapped as the next
dean of Stanford Law School.
Kramer called his new position "a dream
job."
"What drew me to Stanford was the quality
of the Law School," he said.
Law Prof. Michael Klausner described
Kramer as "a top scholar, teacher and
administrator."
"Prof Kramer played key roles in moving
NYU from a position as a very good law school
to an excellent law school today, very much in
a class with Harvard, Yale, and Stanford,"
Klausner added.
In his new position as top administrator,
Kramer said that he would be conscious of
Stanford's status relative to other top schools,
despite some reservations about the ranking
systems often used to compare them.
"Like everyone else, I think the ranking sys
tem is not well-doneâ€”lt's silly, although
Stanford does great," he said. "NYU rose in
the rankings during the last few years, and our
student body got better as a result. Overall, it's
something that faculty shouldn't have to worry
about, hut it is something that deans have to
worry about."
Referring to Stanford's current spot as
second on U.S. News and World Report's an
nual list of law schools, Kramer said, "I hear
it's a fluke. Pretty soon, Stanford should go
back to normal."
Kramer, the fourth constitutional scholar to
head the law school, also discussed his new
book, "The People Themselves: Popular Con

stitutionalism and Judicial Review."
"In my book, I'm trying to do two things,"
he said. "One is to review the history of our
country's founding. Most people view it as a
profoundly anti-democratic moment, when
an attempt was made to put the lid on the
freedoms brought about by the American
Revolution.
I think this reflects more about contempo
rary feelings about democracy than the opin
ions of the founders."
Kramer argued instead that the drafting
of the Constitution was "a highly democratic
moment."
"At least in this one area, we can think
about recapturing the Constitution, and creat
ing a world in which we haven't turned the
Constitution over to a professional elite of
lawyers and judges. We should think of them
as needing to be responsive to us, rather than
dictating its meaning to us."
In this spirit, Kramer expressed hopes of
fostering more outreach and cooperation be
tween the Law School, other departments on
campus and the public.
"There are lots of opportunities for inter
disciplinary work and teaching," he said.
"Stanford Law School hasn't explored as many
of them as exist. That's something I'd like
more of."
Kramer indicated that as dean he would
keep an open mind and pursue a variety of
goals.
"That's my sort of intellectual agenda, in
the sense that I'll teach and talk to people and
so forth," he said. "But what I'd prefer is to get
students exposed to a full range of ideas. That
sounds hopelessly open-ended, but there are
lots of different directions we can take. Figur
ing it out will be a group process. I'd like to fig

ure out with faculty, alumni and students how
we can make a better Law School."
Klausner expressed confidence in
Kramer's abilities and highlighted his past
record in education.
"Larry's experience at three terrific law
schools, working closely with four world
class deans, made him an obvious choice for
dean and will make him an enormously suc
cessful dean," Klausner said. "He is a star re
cruiter of faculty and he is very much devot
ed to building and maintaining a fertile and
enjoyable intellectual environment inside
the school."
Law Prof. Hank Greely echoed Klausner's
optimism.
"I think the whole faculty is looking for
ward to working with Larry Kramer," he said.
While reactions to the selection from within
the Law School have been generally positive,
some professors also said that the selection
process was too closed.
"It is a little disconcerting to have an out
side person become dean, particularly for
those of us who have only just met him,"
Greely said.
The search for dean was conducted by a
committee that included Provost John
Etchemendy; President John Hennessy made
the final decision. In the past, the hiring
process for deans has caused some tension be
tween the administration and the Law School
faculty.
However, Greely was quick to distinguish
the ongoing debate concerning the process
from its end results.
"Everything we hear about Prof. Kramer is
very positive," he said. "Many of my col
leagues know him well and all of those who
know him think of him very highly."


New York University Prof. Larry Kramer was recently named the new
dean of the Stanford School of Law, replacing Kathleen Sullivan.
