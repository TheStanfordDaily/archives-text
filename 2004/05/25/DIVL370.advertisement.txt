Do you need to get unstuck?
Be honest, how is it going, really? Great
teams and talented individuals get stuck
all the time. Perhaps you're so successful,
you've gotten in a rut. Perhaps the world
around you has changed, and you've
failed to change with it. Perhaps you're
trying something fantastically new-and
you've simply hit a roadblock. It's okay.
Being stuck isn't bad-it's whether you
take action to get unstuck that counts.
