# TiEcon conference: Optimistic about economic growth
## 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
The Silicon Valley chapter of
The Indus Entrepreneurs, or TiE,
hosted TiEcon 2004 May 14 -15 in
Santa Clara. The 11th annual con
ference was entitled "One step
ahead, harnessing the optimism."
According to convenor Vish
Mishra, over 3,300 people regis
tered for the conference. This was
their highest attendance ever.
"TiE's mission is to foster and
promote entrepreneurship every
where. It does so through mentor
ing, networking and education,"
Mishra said. "The organization is
an open and inclusive organization
that seeks excellence in everything
it does."
TiEcon is TiE's largest annual
gathering.
"At TiEcon, we get to showcase
every element of TiE that it be
lieves in and stands for," Mishra
said. "And it brings together en
trepreneurs, VCs, corporate execs,
academics, media and policy mak
ers for learning, networking and
opportunity seeking to keep the
faith alive and growing."
The conference included a
keynote by Ted Turner; panels on
topics such as venture capital, lead
ership and globalization; company
presentations; and a trade-show
floor. Stanford students, faculty
and alumni were attendees, pan
elists and moderators.
"Silicon Valley is the epicenter
[of entrepreneurship]," said pan
elist Jon Staenberg, a partner at
Rustic Canyon Partners. "I spent
three degrees [and] eight years at
Stanford, and I continue to believe
that Stanford is the epicenter of
the epicenter."
Staenberg was optimistic about
the current venture capital climate.
"I think it's an unbelievably
great time to be an entrepreneur,"
he said. "In the last few years, the
highs have been high, the lows have
been really low, and I think we've
all come out a little more realistic.
Yet, the pace of innovation isn't
slowing down, so there's tremen
dous opportunity here."
Moderator George Zachary, a
partner at Charles River Ventures
agreed with Staenberg's sentiments.
"The bottom occurred a couple
years ago," he said. "There is a sta
bilization of investment. En
trepreneurs are starting to create
companies. Things will only get
better from here."
This will positively impact grad
uates seeking jobs.
"[There will be] more hiring
opportunities for the next five
years," Zachary said. "There are
companies in the Bay Area that
are doing great. There are some
private companies that have
tremendous amounts of revenue
that aren't well know but will
starting hiring a lot of people

shortly. I'm very positive that if
you're coming out of Stanford in
the next two or three years it will
be a really good environment."
Much of this recovery will be
driven by small startups according
to John Oxaal, a partner at Sevin
Rosen Funds.
"I think the Silicon Valley econ
omy is going to improve," he said.
"I think things were overinvested;
we've had the downturn, and now
things are getting better. A lot of
small companies started over the
last few years are starting to hire,
and it's going to be a good time for
college grads to go get jobs."
Part of this continued success
relies on future companies receiv
ing funding, and Stanford is in a po
sition to help drive that trend.
"We do a lot of investments
based on Stanford technology,"
said Rob Chaplinsky, a general
partner at Mohr, Davidow Ven
tures. "Stanford is very active and
extremely fruitful in terms of
good technology to start compa
nies and we work very closely
with the technology transfer li
censing office. The relationship
between Stanford and Mohr,
Davidow is strong."
Not only is Stanford the right
place, but this is also the right time.
"The venture community is
much more active than it was a
year ago," Chaplinsky said. "It is
a very attractive time to bring
ideas to market."
Ted Turner discussed war, gov
ernment spending, charity and
business during his keynote, one of
the four during the conference.
"I always felt like you needed a
strong ethical background," Turn
er said. "I used to be a Rotarian,
and Rotary's motto is 'He profits
most who serves the best.' I lived by
that motto and I live by it today."
Relating to the sale of his com
pany to Time Warner, Turner said,
"One piece of advice I give to
young entrepreneurs is if you sell
your company, don't expect to stay
there. If you do stay there, you're
very fortunate."
Turner spoke about his opinions
on war and commented that war is
an extraordinary waste of resources.
"The war in Iraq has cost us
$200 billion," he said. "That's
enough money to buy food for ev
erybody in the world for probably
ten years. [War] is so wasteful from
a financial standpoint."
Congressman Mike Honda par
ticipated in a panel and addressed
the government's role in high tech
nology investing.
"[The government should] look
at emerging technologies that may
take a little longer in terms of in
vestment to get to market and say
which ones will impact that has
global attractiveness to private in
vestors," he said.
According to Honda, private
investors evaluate ideas based on

a three-to-five-year return. Their
model does not support more
long-term investments, which
Honda believes the government
needs to promote.
"One good example of that is
the creation of the Internet which
was originally a government invest
ment," he said. "From that, it blos
somed into what it is today."
Sonja Hoel, general partner
and managing director at Menlo
Park Ventures, talked about what
Menlo Park Ventures seeks in a
fundable company.
"We look fora large market and
unique technology," she said. "We
believe that if you have an excellent
management team but no market,
you're still not going to make a
product. But you can have an ex
cellent market and no management
and still do quite well."
Identifying a good market re
quires solid strategy.
"Good strategy starts with good
assumptions," said Peter Meyer of
The Meyer Group. "The assump
tions are far more valuable than
the deductions because one
should assume that we are all
roughly equal to deduce given a
set of assumptions."
Bruce Taragin, a partner at
Blumberg Capital, illuminated

synergies between Israel and Sil
icon Valley.
"The Israeli market is very simi
lar to the Silicon Valley market in
terms on infrastructure," he said.
"Motorolla, Intel, Cisco and a lot
of other companies are spending
a lot of money on development
in Israel."
One of the industry sector
panels focused on semiconductor
technology and its future impact
on this area. Nikhil Balram, CTO
of the displays group at National
Semiconductor pointed out that
new developments in semicon
ductors will be varied based
on applications.
"The semiconductor industry is
quite diverse," he said. "For dis
play divers, analog and mixed sig
nals play a very strong role. In the
PC industry, Moore's law is simply
being able to put more and more
stuff on the same chip, dealing with
heat issues and cost issues."
TiE now also stands for "Talent,
Ideas and Enterprise."
"The conference serves as the
place where the entire ecosystem
comes together," Mishra said.
"It's like the renewal of the 'En
trepreneurial Faith' in all the
like-minded people [who attend]
once a year."

The conference included a
keynote by Ted Turner; panels on
topics such as venture capital, lead
ership and globalization; company
presentations; and a trade-show
floor. Stanford students, faculty
and alumni were attendees, pan
elists and moderators.
"Silicon Valley is the epicenter
[of entrepreneurship]," said pan
elist Jon Staenberg, a partner at
Rustic Canyon Partners. "I spent
three degrees [and] eight years at
Stanford, and I continue to believe
that Stanford is the epicenter of
the epicenter."
Staenberg was optimistic about
the current venture capital climate.
"I think it's an unbelievably
great time to be an entrepreneur,"
he said. "In the last few years, the
highs have been high, the lows have
been really low, and I think we've
all come out a little more realistic.
Yet, the pace of innovation isn't
slowing down, so there's tremen
dous opportunity here."
Moderator George Zachary, a
partner at Charles River Ventures
agreed with Staenberg's sentiments.
"The bottom occurred a couple
years ago," he said. "There is a sta
bilization of investment. En
trepreneurs are starting to create
companies. Things will only get
better from here."
This will positively impact grad
uates seeking jobs.
"[There will be] more hiring
opportunities for the next five
years," Zachary said. "There are
companies in the Bay Area that
are doing great. There are some
private companies that have
tremendous amounts of revenue
that aren't well know but will
starting hiring a lot of people

shortly. I'm very positive that if
you're coming out of Stanford in
the next two or three years it will
be a really good environment."
Much of this recovery will be
driven by small startups according
to John Oxaal, a partner at Sevin
Rosen Funds.
"I think the Silicon Valley econ
omy is going to improve," he said.
"I think things were overinvested;
we've had the downturn, and now
things are getting better. A lot of
small companies started over the
last few years are starting to hire,
and it's going to be a good time for
college grads to go get jobs."
Part of this continued success
relies on future companies receiv
ing funding, and Stanford is in a po
sition to help drive that trend.
"We do a lot of investments
based on Stanford technology,"
said Rob Chaplinsky, a general
partner at Mohr, Davidow Ven
tures. "Stanford is very active and
extremely fruitful in terms of
good technology to start compa
nies and we work very closely
with the technology transfer li
censing office. The relationship
between Stanford and Mohr,
Davidow is strong."
Not only is Stanford the right
place, but this is also the right time.
"The venture community is
much more active than it was a
year ago," Chaplinsky said. "It is
a very attractive time to bring
ideas to market."
Ted Turner discussed war, gov
ernment spending, charity and
business during his keynote, one of
the four during the conference.
"I always felt like you needed a
strong ethical background," Turn
er said. "I used to be a Rotarian,
and Rotary's motto is 'He profits
most who serves the best.' I lived by
that motto and I live by it today."
Relating to the sale of his com
pany to Time Warner, Turner said,
"One piece of advice I give to
young entrepreneurs is if you sell
your company, don't expect to stay
there. If you do stay there, you're
very fortunate."
Turner spoke about his opinions
on war and commented that war is
an extraordinary waste of resources.
"The war in Iraq has cost us
$200 billion," he said. "That's
enough money to buy food for ev
erybody in the world for probably
ten years. [War] is so wasteful from
a financial standpoint."
Congressman Mike Honda par
ticipated in a panel and addressed
the government's role in high tech
nology investing.
"[The government should] look
at emerging technologies that may
take a little longer in terms of in
vestment to get to market and say
which ones will impact that has
global attractiveness to private in
vestors," he said.
According to Honda, private
investors evaluate ideas based on

a three-to-five-year return. Their
model does not support more
long-term investments, which
Honda believes the government
needs to promote.
"One good example of that is
the creation of the Internet which
was originally a government invest
ment," he said. "From that, it blos
somed into what it is today."
Sonja Hoel, general partner
and managing director at Menlo
Park Ventures, talked about what
Menlo Park Ventures seeks in a
fundable company.
"We look fora large market and
unique technology," she said. "We
believe that if you have an excellent
management team but no market,
you're still not going to make a
product. But you can have an ex
cellent market and no management
and still do quite well."
Identifying a good market re
quires solid strategy.
"Good strategy starts with good
assumptions," said Peter Meyer of
The Meyer Group. "The assump
tions are far more valuable than
the deductions because one
should assume that we are all
roughly equal to deduce given a
set of assumptions."
Bruce Taragin, a partner at
Blumberg Capital, illuminated

synergies between Israel and Sil
icon Valley.
"The Israeli market is very simi
lar to the Silicon Valley market in
terms on infrastructure," he said.
"Motorolla, Intel, Cisco and a lot
of other companies are spending
a lot of money on development
in Israel."
One of the industry sector
panels focused on semiconductor
technology and its future impact
on this area. Nikhil Balram, CTO
of the displays group at National
Semiconductor pointed out that
new developments in semicon
ductors will be varied based
on applications.
"The semiconductor industry is
quite diverse," he said. "For dis
play divers, analog and mixed sig
nals play a very strong role. In the
PC industry, Moore's law is simply
being able to put more and more
stuff on the same chip, dealing with
heat issues and cost issues."
TiE now also stands for "Talent,
Ideas and Enterprise."
"The conference serves as the
place where the entire ecosystem
comes together," Mishra said.
"It's like the renewal of the 'En
trepreneurial Faith' in all the
like-minded people [who attend]
once a year."

The Silicon Valley chapter of
The Indus Entrepreneurs, or TiE,
hosted TiEcon 2004 May 14 -15 in
Santa Clara. The 11th annual con
ference was entitled "One step
ahead, harnessing the optimism."
According to convenor Vish
Mishra, over 3,300 people regis

their highest attendance ever.
"TiE's mission is to foster and
promote entrepreneurship every
where. It does so through mentor
ing, networking and education,"
Mishra said. "The organization is
an open and inclusive organization
that seeks excellence in everything
it does."
TiEcon is TiE's largest annual
gathering.
"At TiEcon, we get to showcase
every element of TiE that it be
lieves in and stands for," Mishra
said. "And it brings together en
trepreneurs, VCs, corporate execs,
academics, media and policy mak
ers for learning, networking and
opportunity seeking to keep the
