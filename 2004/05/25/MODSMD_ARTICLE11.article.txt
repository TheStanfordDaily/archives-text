# Fueling the hydrogen reality

### SU FEN LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The future of driving a hydrogen fuel cell
car might be much closer than you think.
On April 20 of this year, Calif. Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger signed an executive
order creating a public and private partnership to
build a "hydrogen highway" in the state by 2010.
On May 12, General Motors showcased
its range of advanced technology vehicles in
its one-day "Road to Hydrogen" Tech Tour
held at the Presidio in Golden Gate Park,
San Francisco.
That following weekend, GM also fea
tured its portfolio of hydrogen fuel cell vehi
cles in WIRED NextFest. WIRED
NextFest. an innovation and technology ex
hibition, was held at Fort Mason Center in
San Francisco from May 14-16.
These events, however, hardly mark
the beginning of hydrogen fuel cell research
and commercialization.
In fact, the idea of hydrogen fuel cell cars
has been around for almost two years. In
2002, GM launched AUTOnomy. This was
GM's first concept vehicle that was designed
entirely around hydrogen fuel cell technolo
gy. All its propulsion and control systems
were contained within a six-inch-thick skate
board-like chassis.
Since then, GM has transformed this con

cept into reality in not just one, but in sever
al different models.
"GM believes the road to a hydrogen
economy will ultimately lead to truly sustain
able transportation," said Elizabeth Lowery,
General Motor's vice president of Environ
ment and Energy.
"Still, we'll need to excel in several tech
nologies— not just one or two — to meet
the transportation needs of consumers and
society worldwide over the next several
decades," she said.
At "Road to Hydrogen," participants
got a chance to drive two of GM's fuel cell
vehicles — Hy-wire and HydroGen3.
They also learned about GM's fuel cell ac
tivities, partnerships and other advanced
propulsion technologies from GM execu
tives and engineers.
Hy-wire is the world's first driveable fuel
cell vehicle with by-wire technology. It has
no internal combustion engine, instrument
panel, brake or accelerator panels. Not only
does it emit only pure water — its steering,
acceleration and braking are controlled via
electrical signals instead of mechanical links
of hydraulics.
HydroGen3, on the other hand, is a fuel
cell vehicle based on the Opel Zafira MPV
minivan. Beginning June last year, FedEx
operated HydroGen3 several days a week
on its regular delivery routes in Tokyo,

Japan. Like the Hy-wire, all of HydroGen3's
acceleration, steering and braking controls
were modified to work in an electric propul
sion system.
Students from Stanford and several Uni
versity of California campuses were invited
to attend the NextFest. They were exposed
to technologies and business practices that
are currently taught in the classroom.
"It is important to address environ
mental and energy issues through frank
discussion with our stakeholders," Low
ery said. "Understanding various perspec
tives and building strong partnerships
with academic, business and government
sectors will assist us in commercializing
these technologies."
Technical experts also demonstrated cur
rent and near-term efficient, fuel-saving
technologies such as gas-electric hybrids,
cylinder deactivation — also known as Dis
placement on Demand — alternative fuel
vehicles and clean diesels.
Displacement on Demand allows a vehi
cle to run on half its cylinders when full
power is not needed. When engine loads de
mand full power, the system shifts seamlessly
without any input from the driver and without
any compromise in vehicle performance.
Displacement on Demand will appear
first on the 2005 model year GMC Envoy
XL and Envoy XUV; and on the Chevrolet

Trailßlazer EXT sport-utility vehicles. By
2008, more than two million GM vehicles
with V-8 and V-6 engines will have this
feature, which boosts engine efficiency by
up to 8 percent.
Also included in the Tech Tour is the GM
hybrid truck. It will be available to retail con
sumers later this year as a 2005 model. The
industry's first hybrid pickup improves effi
ciency in stop-and-go driving by shutting off
the engine at idle mode and enabling early
fuel cutoff to the engine during decelera
tions, providing drivers with up to 13 percent
fuel savings.
Another relevant technology is the GM
Firebird I. Inspired by the nation's fascina
tion with the "jet age," the Firebird I, II and
111 concepts from the 1950s were developed
in support of GM Research's experimental
turbine engine program.
The Firebird I, a needle-nosed, delta
winged vehicle, was styled by Harley J.
Earl in 1952 and powered by a turbine en
gine. In 1956, GM introduced the Firebird
11, which featured the first regenerative
gas turbine. The Firebird 111 was built in
1958, and was the first to feature a single
stick control system which replaced the
conventional steering wheel, brake pedal
and accelerator.
The GM Hybrid Transit Bus also played
a central role at NextFest. Throughout the

weekend, the bus shuttled attendees to and
from the event. This allowed attendees to
see first hand the GM Hybrid Transit Bus
technology, which reduces fuel consump
tion by up to 60 percent and emissions by up
to 90 percent.
Apart from showcasing its technology to
the general public, GM is also involved in
partnerships with several organizations.
It is using its portion of the federal grant
from the U.S. Department of Energy to col
laborate with Shell Oil, Air Products and
Chemicals Inc., and Quantum Technologies.
This partnership will work to develop more
hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and fueling sta
tions, iin addition to furthering hydrogen in
frastructure. Research efforts will take place
in several states throughout the United
States, including California.
GM and Ford Motor Co. also recently an
nounced they would jointly develop an all
new 6-speed front-wheel-drive automatic
transmission. This is expected to offer up
to 4 percent improvement in fuel econo
my over today's traditional 4-speed auto
matic transmissions.
"Technologies such as Displacement on
Demand and the 6-speed transmission, along
with our comprehensive hybrid technology
plan, will allow us to apply fuel-saving ad
vanced technologies to high-volume produc
tion vehicles," Lowery said.

its one-day "Road to Hydrogen" Tech Tour
held at the Presidio in Golden Gate Park,
San Francisco.
That following weekend, GM also fea
tured its portfolio of hydrogen fuel cell vehi
cles in WIRED NextFest. WIRED
NextFest. an innovation and technology ex
hibition, was held at Fort Mason Center in
San Francisco from May 14-16.
These events, however, hardly mark
the beginning of hydrogen fuel cell research
and commercialization.
In fact, the idea of hydrogen fuel cell cars
has been around for almost two years. In
2002, GM launched AUTOnomy. This was
GM's first concept vehicle that was designed
entirely around hydrogen fuel cell technolo
gy. All its propulsion and control systems
were contained within a six-inch-thick skate
board-like chassis.
Since then, GM has transformed this con

cept into reality in not just one, but in sever
al different models.
"GM believes the road to a hydrogen
economy will ultimately lead to truly sustain
able transportation," said Elizabeth Lowery,
General Motor's vice president of Environ
ment and Energy.
"Still, we'll need to excel in several tech
nologies— not just one or two — to meet
the transportation needs of consumers and
society worldwide over the next several
decades," she said.
At "Road to Hydrogen," participants
got a chance to drive two of GM's fuel cell
vehicles — Hy-wire and HydroGen3.
They also learned about GM's fuel cell ac
tivities, partnerships and other advanced
propulsion technologies from GM execu
tives and engineers.
Hy-wire is the world's first driveable fuel
cell vehicle with by-wire technology. It has
no internal combustion engine, instrument
panel, brake or accelerator panels. Not only
does it emit only pure water — its steering,
acceleration and braking are controlled via
electrical signals instead of mechanical links
of hydraulics.
HydroGen3, on the other hand, is a fuel
cell vehicle based on the Opel Zafira MPV
minivan. Beginning June last year, FedEx
operated HydroGen3 several days a week
on its regular delivery routes in Tokyo,

Japan. Like the Hy-wire, all of HydroGen3's
acceleration, steering and braking controls
were modified to work in an electric propul
sion system.
Students from Stanford and several Uni
versity of California campuses were invited
to attend the NextFest. They were exposed
to technologies and business practices that
are currently taught in the classroom.
"It is important to address environ
mental and energy issues through frank
discussion with our stakeholders," Low
ery said. "Understanding various perspec
tives and building strong partnerships
with academic, business and government
sectors will assist us in commercializing
these technologies."
Technical experts also demonstrated cur
rent and near-term efficient, fuel-saving
technologies such as gas-electric hybrids,
cylinder deactivation — also known as Dis
placement on Demand — alternative fuel
vehicles and clean diesels.
Displacement on Demand allows a vehi
cle to run on half its cylinders when full
power is not needed. When engine loads de
mand full power, the system shifts seamlessly
without any input from the driver and without
any compromise in vehicle performance.
Displacement on Demand will appear
first on the 2005 model year GMC Envoy
XL and Envoy XUV; and on the Chevrolet

Trailßlazer EXT sport-utility vehicles. By
2008, more than two million GM vehicles
with V-8 and V-6 engines will have this
feature, which boosts engine efficiency by
up to 8 percent.
Also included in the Tech Tour is the GM
hybrid truck. It will be available to retail con
sumers later this year as a 2005 model. The
industry's first hybrid pickup improves effi
ciency in stop-and-go driving by shutting off
the engine at idle mode and enabling early
fuel cutoff to the engine during decelera
tions, providing drivers with up to 13 percent
fuel savings.
Another relevant technology is the GM
Firebird I. Inspired by the nation's fascina
tion with the "jet age," the Firebird I, II and
111 concepts from the 1950s were developed
in support of GM Research's experimental
turbine engine program.
The Firebird I, a needle-nosed, delta
winged vehicle, was styled by Harley J.
Earl in 1952 and powered by a turbine en
gine. In 1956, GM introduced the Firebird
11, which featured the first regenerative
gas turbine. The Firebird 111 was built in
1958, and was the first to feature a single
stick control system which replaced the
conventional steering wheel, brake pedal
and accelerator.
The GM Hybrid Transit Bus also played
a central role at NextFest. Throughout the

weekend, the bus shuttled attendees to and
from the event. This allowed attendees to
see first hand the GM Hybrid Transit Bus
technology, which reduces fuel consump
tion by up to 60 percent and emissions by up
to 90 percent.
Apart from showcasing its technology to
the general public, GM is also involved in
partnerships with several organizations.
It is using its portion of the federal grant
from the U.S. Department of Energy to col
laborate with Shell Oil, Air Products and
Chemicals Inc., and Quantum Technologies.
This partnership will work to develop more
hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and fueling sta
tions, iin addition to furthering hydrogen in
frastructure. Research efforts will take place
in several states throughout the United
States, including California.
GM and Ford Motor Co. also recently an
nounced they would jointly develop an all
new 6-speed front-wheel-drive automatic
transmission. This is expected to offer up
to 4 percent improvement in fuel econo
my over today's traditional 4-speed auto
matic transmissions.
"Technologies such as Displacement on
Demand and the 6-speed transmission, along
with our comprehensive hybrid technology
plan, will allow us to apply fuel-saving ad
vanced technologies to high-volume produc
tion vehicles," Lowery said.
The future of driving a hydrogen fuel cell
car might be much closer than you think.
On April 20 of this year, Calif. Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger signed an executive
order creating a public and private partnership to
build a "hydrogen highway" in the state by 2010.
