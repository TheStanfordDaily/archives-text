# Figueroa/Natoli blend advocacy, action during relatively successful term
## 
### 
With last night's certification of Chioke
Borgelt-Mose and Kory Vargas Caro
as the 2004-2005 ASSU executives,
ASSU President Nadiya Figueroa
and Vice President Joey Natoli will finally step
down from their term in office. The two have
worked hard for over a year and have accom
plished much in terms of both action and advoca
cy for the campus community.
Figueroa and Natoli evidenced their commit
ment to students in the broad scope of their work,
which ranged from Absolute Fun to focus groups
on advising reform to establishing an ASSU text
book service. Their previous community experi
ence and involvement proved invaluable as they
reached out to a wide range of groups on campus
and built a strong relationship with the ASSU leg
islative bodies.
An overview of the services and programs
provided this year by Figueroa and Natoli is of
fered below:
Absolute Fun — This social programming ini
tiative was launched this fall. It used $50,000 in
funding for events throughout the year, includ
ing Spring Thing and the post-Big Game Block
Party. The ice cream social early in the year was
mediocre, and overall. Absolute Fun has had lim
ited success, given its investment of resources.
Advising reform — Figueroa and Natoli held
focus groups with almost 200 sophomores to an
alyze the freshman advising experience. A re
port has been written and will be distributed
within next week. This represents a step in the
right direction for better meeting students' ad
vising needs.
ASSU Book Service — Between buying and
selling activities, this purportedly saves students
close to $5,000 a quarter and will move to an on
line format next year in order to diversify offer
ings. This was an innovative idea that provided a
service dimension to Figueroa's and Natoli's ad
vocacy goal of lowering the cost of living.
Full Moon on the Quad — Figueroa and Na
toli wrote a report, which will be presented to the
new Senior Class presidents within the next two
weeks on how to improve Full Moon on the Quad
next year. While we do not believe they were in
strumental in running the event itself, Natoli did
organize many of the meetings (and, in particular,
stepped up when some of the Senior Class presi
dents were not able to participate in planning).
Community center support — Figueroa and
Natoli worked on the larger Black Community
Services Center project to ensure funding and
project scope. Especially since this was one of
the largest student campaigns, this was an excel
lent service. In addition, they worked with com
munity center leaders regarding future develop
ment, though with few tangible results.
Diversity — Figueroa and Natoli fundraised
for community centers, built University-wide
momentum and laid the groundwork for future
work in this area, but no final objectives have
yet been realized. Faculty diversity remains to
be improved and this issue was largely left un
treated by Figueroa and Natoli. Most of this
year's progress in expanding and supporting di
versity at Stanford was led by non-ASSU stu
dent leadership.
Board of Trustees — Figueroa and Natoli
made an annual presentation to the board and
began discussions regarding the future of student
group funding. This led to the creation of a com
mittee to look into student group fundraising by-

Dean of Students Greg Boardman, though the
success of this committee is yet to be seen.
Arts community — With significant help
from executive cabinet member and senior
Veronica Flores and the Arts Grant Board,
Figueroa and Natoli provided assistance to the
arts community, culminating in the recent Can
tor Arts Center extravaganza
Special fees — Figueroa and Natoli sought to
lower the refund rate for student groups follow
ing the discovery that the special-fees system
was in danger of bankruptcy. Ideas were imple
mented for the next academic year, so the ulti
mate success or failure of these ideas remains to
be seen.
Cost of living — Figueroa and Natoli success
fully lobbied for the laundry initiative, which will
provide a flat rate for all laundry use next aca
demic year. Also, heavy lobbying was successful
in getting the Bursar's office to seriously consid
er the inclusion on Internet fees in the tuition bill
for the 2005-2006 school year. (The administra
tion did not want to alter the laundry and Infor
mation Technology Systems and Services fees
collection systems in one year.) They also began
a movement to lower printing costs, but have lit
tle to show for this effort.
Stanford Dining — Figueroa and Natoli
worked with Stanford Dining to form the new
Union Square area. They implemented two new fi
nals weeks traditions during which the ASSU gives
out donuts in December and ice cream in June. In
addition, they worked to create a lower-priced
summer meal plan. The success of this effort is
questionable, as the new plan offerings are only
nominally cheaper and offer total fewer meals.
ASSU Frosh Council — Figueroa and Natoli
closed the gap that existed between the Dorm
Rep program and Frosh Council by making them
one program.
Blender — Figueroa and Natoli began a one
of-a-kind effort at establishing a student group
incubator. This is significant in its large amount
of student space in the Nitery building.
Student space advocacy — Figueroa and Na
toli continued to advocate for central student
space, resulting in the final draft of the Student
Activity Space Report. They failed to streamline
the existing reservation process, however, and
students lost more space (e.g. the proposed pub
lications building) than they gained (e.g. the ad
ditional square footage to the BCSC) this year.
Figueroa and Natoli should be commended
for the advances they have made for students
this year. That said, there were some shortcom
ings to their term. Advocacy goals were broadly
worked on, but very few tangible results
emerged. And transparency and communication
with the student population suffered this year.
Bi-annual reports and monthly e-mails on the
state of the association did not materialize.
Also, although this is not necessarily the fault of
Figueroa and Natoli, there was a very low reten
tion rate in senators and Nominations Commit
tee members from this year to next. This ad
versely affects next year's executives, and the
problem of passing on knowledge will only be
made more difficult by the delayed election cer
tification timeline.
We offer next year's executives the best of
luck as they continue in the footsteps of
Figueroa and Natoli. Figueroa and Natoli left
big shoes to fill, but we believe that Borgelt-
Mose and Vargas Caro are up to the challenge.

toli continued to advocate for central student
space, resulting in the final draft of the Student
Activity Space Report. They failed to streamline
the existing reservation process, however, and
students lost more space (e.g. the proposed pub
lications building) than they gained (e.g. the ad
ditional square footage to the BCSC) this year.
Figueroa and Natoli should be commended
for the advances they have made for students
this year. That said, there were some shortcom
ings to their term. Advocacy goals were broadly
worked on, but very few tangible results
emerged. And transparency and communication
with the student population suffered this year.
Bi-annual reports and monthly e-mails on the
state of the association did not materialize.
Also, although this is not necessarily the fault of
Figueroa and Natoli, there was a very low reten
tion rate in senators and Nominations Commit
tee members from this year to next. This ad
versely affects next year's executives, and the
problem of passing on knowledge will only be
made more difficult by the delayed election cer
tification timeline.
We offer next year's executives the best of
luck as they continue in the footsteps of
Figueroa and Natoli. Figueroa and Natoli left
big shoes to fill, but we believe that Borgelt-
Mose and Vargas Caro are up to the challenge.
With last night's certification of Chioke
Borgelt-Mose and Kory Vargas Caro
as the 2004-2005 ASSU executives,
ASSU President Nadiya Figueroa
and Vice President Joey Natoli will finally step
down from their term in office. The two have
worked hard for over a year and have accom
plished much in terms of both action and advoca
cy for the campus community.
Figueroa and Natoli evidenced their commit
ment to students in the broad scope of their work,
which ranged from Absolute Fun to focus groups
on advising reform to establishing an ASSU text
book service. Their previous community experi
ence and involvement proved invaluable as they
reached out to a wide range of groups on campus
and built a strong relationship with the ASSU leg
islative bodies.
An overview of the services and programs
provided this year by Figueroa and Natoli is of
fered below:
Absolute Fun — This social programming ini
tiative was launched this fall. It used $50,000 in
funding for events throughout the year, includ
ing Spring Thing and the post-Big Game Block
Party. The ice cream social early in the year was
mediocre, and overall. Absolute Fun has had lim
ited success, given its investment of resources.
Advising reform — Figueroa and Natoli held
focus groups with almost 200 sophomores to an
alyze the freshman advising experience. A re
port has been written and will be distributed
within next week. This represents a step in the
right direction for better meeting students' ad
vising needs.
ASSU Book Service — Between buying and
selling activities, this purportedly saves students
close to $5,000 a quarter and will move to an on
line format next year in order to diversify offer
ings. This was an innovative idea that provided a
service dimension to Figueroa's and Natoli's ad
vocacy goal of lowering the cost of living.
Full Moon on the Quad — Figueroa and Na
toli wrote a report, which will be presented to the
new Senior Class presidents within the next two
weeks on how to improve Full Moon on the Quad
next year. While we do not believe they were in
strumental in running the event itself, Natoli did
organize many of the meetings (and, in particular,
stepped up when some of the Senior Class presi
dents were not able to participate in planning).
Community center support — Figueroa and
Natoli worked on the larger Black Community
Services Center project to ensure funding and
project scope. Especially since this was one of
the largest student campaigns, this was an excel
lent service. In addition, they worked with com
munity center leaders regarding future develop
ment, though with few tangible results.
Diversity — Figueroa and Natoli fundraised
for community centers, built University-wide
momentum and laid the groundwork for future
work in this area, but no final objectives have
yet been realized. Faculty diversity remains to
be improved and this issue was largely left un
treated by Figueroa and Natoli. Most of this
year's progress in expanding and supporting di
versity at Stanford was led by non-ASSU stu
dent leadership.
Board of Trustees — Figueroa and Natoli
made an annual presentation to the board and
began discussions regarding the future of student
group funding. This led to the creation of a com
mittee to look into student group fundraising by-

Dean of Students Greg Boardman, though the
success of this committee is yet to be seen.
Arts community — With significant help
from executive cabinet member and senior
Veronica Flores and the Arts Grant Board,
Figueroa and Natoli provided assistance to the
arts community, culminating in the recent Can
tor Arts Center extravaganza
Special fees — Figueroa and Natoli sought to
lower the refund rate for student groups follow
ing the discovery that the special-fees system
was in danger of bankruptcy. Ideas were imple
mented for the next academic year, so the ulti
mate success or failure of these ideas remains to
be seen.
Cost of living — Figueroa and Natoli success
fully lobbied for the laundry initiative, which will
provide a flat rate for all laundry use next aca
demic year. Also, heavy lobbying was successful
in getting the Bursar's office to seriously consid
er the inclusion on Internet fees in the tuition bill
for the 2005-2006 school year. (The administra
tion did not want to alter the laundry and Infor
mation Technology Systems and Services fees
collection systems in one year.) They also began
a movement to lower printing costs, but have lit
tle to show for this effort.
Stanford Dining — Figueroa and Natoli
worked with Stanford Dining to form the new
Union Square area. They implemented two new fi
nals weeks traditions during which the ASSU gives
out donuts in December and ice cream in June. In
addition, they worked to create a lower-priced
summer meal plan. The success of this effort is
questionable, as the new plan offerings are only
nominally cheaper and offer total fewer meals.
ASSU Frosh Council — Figueroa and Natoli
closed the gap that existed between the Dorm
Rep program and Frosh Council by making them
one program.
Blender — Figueroa and Natoli began a one
of-a-kind effort at establishing a student group
incubator. This is significant in its large amount
of student space in the Nitery building.

toli continued to advocate for central student
