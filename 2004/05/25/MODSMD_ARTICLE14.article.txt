## Farm subsidies contribute to obesity

Don'tsupersize me. Overeating or
eating too much of high-calorie, high
fat, high-sugar foods is seen as both
an indulgence and a personal failing.
As a result, the public health strategy
in this area of obesity prevention typ
ically centers on patient education.
Public educators about obesity hope
that some amount of behavioral mod
ification will occur, and the people
will choose to combat obesity on an
individual level by increasing physical
activity and decreasing caloric intake.
This strategy has met with minimal
success, and the incidence of obesity
continues to climb.
As food gets cheaper to produce,
food manufacturers have an incen
tive to increase portion size in order
to keep up with decreasing per-unit
revenue. Increased portion size has
been tied directly to the obesity epi
demic. Yet market forces and con
sumer demand are only the most di
rect causes of increases in portion
size; agricultural policy shapes the
price of food and therefore the ten
dencies of producers to pack more
cheap raw materials into each high
ly processed bite. Our goal, there
fore, is not to change agricultural
policy overnight, but to shift the de
bate over agricultural policy so that
it incorporates the public health ar
guments into its sphere of political
action and argument.
The World Health Organization
now identifies the use of an individ
ual country's domestic laws as the
main approach in resisting upward
trends in obesity. Specifically, the
United States should advocate fora
gradual phase-out of the existing
farm subsidies and shifting to an

open market (as was proposed in the
"Freedom to Farm" law of 1996) as
a potential solution for the increas
ing obesity epidemic.
The notion that the federal gov
ernment should eliminate the farm
subsidies is by no means new. In 1996,
President Clinton signed a law known
as The Federal Agricultural Im
provement and Reform (FAIR) Act
of 1996, also informally known as the
"Freedom to Farm." The law pro
posed a seven-year phase-out of farm
subsidies, to be replaced by forces of
open market. The motivation behind
the law was not directly related to
public health. At that point, it was felt
that the farm subsidies and federally
managed agriculture were inefficient,
costly and barriers to free trade.
The goals of the FAIR Act were
never realized, however. In fact, the
amount of federal subsidizing follow
ing the enactment of the law greatly
increased — in 2000, subsidies pro
vided farmers 49 percent of their net
income, up from 13 percent in 1996.
Government payments in 2001
soared to $23 billion, the highest ever.
So how did the plan for free-mar
ket farming fail? In 1997, commodity
prices dropped dramatically. This has
been attributed to three reasons: 1)
an uncommonly long run of favorable
weather produced six years of con
secutive bin-busting harvests for U.S.
farmers, resulting in more supply and
depressed prices; 2) the Asian finan
cial crisis that started in Thailand in
July 1997 decreased the demand for
U.S. grain exports; 3) government
protectionism — the government
failed to seek aggressively the open
ing of new foreign markets.
The net result of these unfavor
able circumstances was a sharp de
cline in commodity prices, which led
Congress to pass generous yearly

emergency supplements to farmers
— scheduled transition payments.
Thus, the "Freedom to Farm" act
not only failed to wean farmers off
subsidies, but actually increased
their reliance on them. (It also in
creased the proportion of federal
budget being used for subsidies.)
Due to the failure of "Freedom to
Farm" act, supporters and critics
alike now agree that farm subsidies
will likely be present for decades to
come. One of the reasons cited is
politics — larger producers that re
ceive the biggest fraction of the fed
eral subsidies have more political
power in Washington, through lob
byists and campaign contributions to
elected officials, and they vehement
ly oppose changes. Other reasons in
clude land values — expected subsi
dies play a large role in buying and
selling farmland, so their phase-out
would lead to a decrease in land
value — and commodity markets —
farmers are still too numerous to be
able to constrict the supply of grain,
and thus, raise its price.
However, much of the debate
over farm policy in the past decades
has focused narrowly on its effects on
agricultural outcomes and farmers'
interests. This focus ignored a main
adverse consequence of massive sub
sidization of food overproduction: It
contributes to obesity. Our goal,
therefore, is not to change agricultur
al policy overnight, but to shift the
debate over agricultural policy so
that it incorporates the public health
arguments into its sphere of political
action and argument.

provement and Reform (FAIR) Act
of 1996, also informally known as the
"Freedom to Farm." The law pro
posed a seven-year phase-out of farm
subsidies, to be replaced by forces of
open market. The motivation behind
the law was not directly related to
public health. At that point, it was felt
that the farm subsidies and federally
managed agriculture were inefficient,
costly and barriers to free trade.
The goals of the FAIR Act were
never realized, however. In fact, the
amount of federal subsidizing follow
ing the enactment of the law greatly
increased — in 2000, subsidies pro
vided farmers 49 percent of their net
income, up from 13 percent in 1996.
Government payments in 2001
soared to $23 billion, the highest ever.
So how did the plan for free-mar
ket farming fail? In 1997, commodity
prices dropped dramatically. This has
been attributed to three reasons: 1)
an uncommonly long run of favorable
weather produced six years of con
secutive bin-busting harvests for U.S.
farmers, resulting in more supply and
depressed prices; 2) the Asian finan
cial crisis that started in Thailand in
July 1997 decreased the demand for
U.S. grain exports; 3) government
protectionism — the government
failed to seek aggressively the open
ing of new foreign markets.
The net result of these unfavor
able circumstances was a sharp de
cline in commodity prices, which led
Congress to pass generous yearly

emergency supplements to farmers
— scheduled transition payments.
Thus, the "Freedom to Farm" act
not only failed to wean farmers off
subsidies, but actually increased
their reliance on them. (It also in
creased the proportion of federal
budget being used for subsidies.)
Due to the failure of "Freedom to
Farm" act, supporters and critics
alike now agree that farm subsidies
will likely be present for decades to
come. One of the reasons cited is
politics — larger producers that re
ceive the biggest fraction of the fed
eral subsidies have more political
power in Washington, through lob
byists and campaign contributions to
elected officials, and they vehement
ly oppose changes. Other reasons in
clude land values — expected subsi
dies play a large role in buying and
selling farmland, so their phase-out
would lead to a decrease in land
value — and commodity markets —
farmers are still too numerous to be
able to constrict the supply of grain,
and thus, raise its price.
However, much of the debate
over farm policy in the past decades
has focused narrowly on its effects on
agricultural outcomes and farmers'
interests. This focus ignored a main
adverse consequence of massive sub
sidization of food overproduction: It
contributes to obesity. Our goal,
therefore, is not to change agricultur
al policy overnight, but to shift the
debate over agricultural policy so
that it incorporates the public health
arguments into its sphere of political
action and argument.

Don'tsupersize me. Overeating or
eating too much of high-calorie, high
fat, high-sugar foods is seen as both
an indulgence and a personal failing.
As a result, the public health strategy
in this area of obesity prevention typ
ically centers on patient education.
Public educators about obesity hope
that some amount of behavioral mod
ification will occur, and the people
will choose to combat obesity on an
individual level by increasing physical
activity and decreasing caloric intake.
This strategy has met with minimal
success, and the incidence of obesity
continues to climb.
As food gets cheaper to produce,
food manufacturers have an incen
tive to increase portion size in order
to keep up with decreasing per-unit
revenue. Increased portion size has
been tied directly to the obesity epi
demic. Yet market forces and con
sumer demand are only the most di
rect causes of increases in portion
size; agricultural policy shapes the
price of food and therefore the ten
dencies of producers to pack more
cheap raw materials into each high
ly processed bite. Our goal, there
fore, is not to change agricultural
policy overnight, but to shift the de
bate over agricultural policy so that
it incorporates the public health ar
guments into its sphere of political
action and argument.
The World Health Organization
now identifies the use of an individ
ual country's domestic laws as the
main approach in resisting upward
trends in obesity. Specifically, the
United States should advocate fora
gradual phase-out of the existing
farm subsidies and shifting to an

open market (as was proposed in the
"Freedom to Farm" law of 1996) as
a potential solution for the increas
ing obesity epidemic.
The notion that the federal gov
ernment should eliminate the farm
subsidies is by no means new. In 1996,
President Clinton signed a law known
as The Federal Agricultural Im
provement and Reform (FAIR) Act
of 1996, also informally known as the
