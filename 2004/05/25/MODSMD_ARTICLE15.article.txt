## Masque deserves respect, special fees 
### ELLEN FREYTAG 
In his letter to the editor a week
ago ("Multiculturalism is not under
attack at Stanford," May 17), Huey
Kwik asked, "Well, who actually
reads Masque?" As the editor of
Masque magazine, I wanted to re
spond to this inquiry as to our pub
lication's readership. It is true, most
students do not read Masque.
They're too distracted by the stun
ning photographs and unparalleled
quality of the layout. Perhaps they
are confused by the lack of pixella
tion, dust and scratches in the art
work, the consistent usage of fonts
or the placement of poems some
where other than the center of the
page. We cannot be sure. Then
again, anyone who has looked at or
actually read a copy of Masque
would have been able to answer this
question for himself.
Masque won the Independent
Press Association's (IPA) national
award for Best Design by a college
publication in 2003, and was subse
quently featured at conferences of
thousands of IPA journalists who
then took their exposure back to the
entire staffs of their thousands of
publications. It also won the Vice
Versa national award for Best New
College Publication when it pre
miered. So I guess you could say the
whole country is pretty busy not
reading Masque. As editor, I receive
letters from locations as varied as
New York, Germany, Spain, lowa
and New Zealand, all compliment

ing the magazine and requesting
more copies to not read. So I guess
you could even say the whole world
is busy not reading Masque. Except
Kwik, apparently, who seems to be
the leading expert on the merit of
the magazine's textual content.
Unlike other publications,
Masque is not a trust-fund baby. We
have to worry about money. In fact,
we have to worry about money more
than almost any other group on this
campus because we have lost special
fees and subsequently have had to
collect signatures more times during
our eight-year existence than any
other VSO. Ever. The ASSU fund
ing system is not built to correlate
publication funding to the quality of
a publication nor to the size of its
readership. A publication can only
increase its budget request by 10 per
cent a year, barely enough to cover
rising printing costs. And perhaps
the only groups student voters tend
to look down upon with more malice
than those with "queer" or "Chicano
/ Latino" in their names are those
that request budget increases. All
other ASSU funding options that
avoid the student vote cap their max
imum funding request at less than
the minimum operating budget of
Masque and all other special fees
publications. This system keeps the
big publications big and the small
publications small, regardless of
changes in readership over the years.
Masque magazine was founded
in 1996 in response to a series of ho
mophobic hate crimes committed

on the Stanford campus. The idea
was to combat homophobia by
overwhelming readers with the
beauty of queer and queer-allied
people's literary and artistic cre
ations. The ignorant, the closeted
and members of the queer commu
nity seeking to share their work
with a broader audience, in addition
to our Stanford American Indian
Organization, MEChA, community
center, ethnic theme dorm and
other allies who acknowledge the
value of multiculturalism: That is
Masque's intended readership. If
the student-bodv vote required to
obtain ASSU funding did not sub
ject us to precisely the homophobia
we seek to eliminate, perhaps we
could print enough copies of our
magazine for every undergraduate.
But even then. Residential Educa
tion's policy would prevent us from
distributing them all.
It is hard to believe that even
someone like Kwik acknowledges
sexual and gender minorities, but
the University still refuses to in
clude queerness in its definition of
"multiculturalism," or involve the
lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgen
dered community in any of its large
multicultural events. Maybe Kwik
could organize a bunch of people to
write the administration letters
about that.

publication funding to the quality of
a publication nor to the size of its
readership. A publication can only
increase its budget request by 10 per
cent a year, barely enough to cover
rising printing costs. And perhaps
the only groups student voters tend
to look down upon with more malice
than those with "queer" or "Chicano
/ Latino" in their names are those
that request budget increases. All
other ASSU funding options that
avoid the student vote cap their max
imum funding request at less than
the minimum operating budget of
Masque and all other special fees
publications. This system keeps the
big publications big and the small
publications small, regardless of
changes in readership over the years.
Masque magazine was founded
in 1996 in response to a series of ho
mophobic hate crimes committed

on the Stanford campus. The idea
was to combat homophobia by
overwhelming readers with the
beauty of queer and queer-allied
people's literary and artistic cre
ations. The ignorant, the closeted
and members of the queer commu
nity seeking to share their work
with a broader audience, in addition
to our Stanford American Indian
Organization, MEChA, community
center, ethnic theme dorm and
other allies who acknowledge the
value of multiculturalism: That is
Masque's intended readership. If
the student-bodv vote required to
obtain ASSU funding did not sub
ject us to precisely the homophobia
we seek to eliminate, perhaps we
could print enough copies of our
magazine for every undergraduate.
But even then. Residential Educa
tion's policy would prevent us from
distributing them all.
It is hard to believe that even
someone like Kwik acknowledges
sexual and gender minorities, but
the University still refuses to in
clude queerness in its definition of
"multiculturalism," or involve the
lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgen
dered community in any of its large
multicultural events. Maybe Kwik
could organize a bunch of people to
write the administration letters
about that.
