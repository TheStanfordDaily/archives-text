Changes to pay structure
hurt graa students
I am glad that The Daily ran the
article "Stanford limits TA, RA
hours" (May 19), which is an impor
tant issue for the grad student popu
lation. However, I think the article
misses a critical point.
Much of the article makes it
sound as if the University is simply
responding to the new Federal Insur
ance Contributions Act (FICA) reg
ulation (presumably to help the stu
dent population in dealing with the
increase in taxes. On the contrary, it
seems that the University is using the
FICA change as a pretext for its own
policy changes that will further bur
den the grad student worker.
If you carefully read the Univer
sity memorandum and associated
documentation, the following, dis

concerting fact is clear. The FICA
tax would be $840, but the two op
tions presented by the University
would take even more out of the
grad student pocket: a total of
$1,056 or $1,100.
The first option is to be em
ployed as a 100-percent temp-work
er over the summer; this option
would incur $840 FICA tax and for
feit the $216 grad student health in
surance subsidy. The second option
is to be employed as a 90-percent re
search assistant, which forfeits
$I,loo+ in pay. In short, instead of
just letting students pay their $840
in FICA, the University is introduc
ing new policies that will extract an
additional $216-$260 from the grad
student pocket.
These are not small sums of money.
The Daily should not have perpetuat
ed this brand of dismissing the issue by

quoting Computer Science Prof. Ser
afim Batzoglou as saying that the "im
pact will be low because it is only a 10
percent difference."
If his pay, or any University em
ployee's pay, were cut by 10 per
cent, he or she should be extremely
upset. The effect is more extreme if
the base pay is relatively low to
begin with, as is the case with the
grad student population affected by
these new policies.
Finally, I would like to point out
that the FICA regulation on its own
is in some sense a positive change
for the grad student population. In
essence, it says that the University
should not be allowed to treat its
full-time summer grad employees as
second-class citizens, but must treat
them as "career employees."
It seems rather ironic that the
University's response to this IRS
mandate is to either shunt us into a
"temp-worker" pool with limited
benefits, or to simply cut our pay by
10 percent so that we cannot be con
sidered full-time workers. Both op
tions seem to violate the spirit, if not
the letter, of the law that we must be
treated as full-fledged "career em
ployees" whilst employed full time.
The University should remem
ber that it is already.getting an ex
tremely good deal out of its grad
population. Most senior students
work effectively 100-percent time as
research assistants during the
school year, in spite of being paid
only 50-percent RA-ships.
I hope that The Daily will contin
ue a rigorous investigation into the
University's handling of this issue
and the University's treatment of its
grad student employees.

Senior Gift co-chairs explain
their solicitation tactics
As co-chairs of the 2004 Senior
Gift campaign, we would like to re
spond to the editorial entitled "Se
nior Gift Tactics Questionable"
(May 12) in order to clarify some of
the concerns that were raised.
One of the first things we
learned as we embarked on orga
nizing the 2004 campaign was the
difference between the Stanford
Alumni Association and The Stan
ford Fund, which is part of the Of
fice of Development. While the
two organizations work together to
engage students and alumni, they
have separate missions. The Stan
ford Alumni Association seeks to
foster lifelong intellectual and
emotional connections between

the University and its graduates,
while the Office of Development
and The Stanford Fund promote
the importance of financial support
for the University.
The Office of Development's Se
nior Gift program is a Stanford tra
dition that dates back to the
fundraising efforts of the class of
1955, which was led by Dr. Peter
Bing. Over the years, thousands of
seniors have made their first gifts to
the University through this pro
gram. Participation peaked in 2000,
when a record 78 percent of the
class made a gift.
Other universities also have
strong Senior Gift traditions. In
2003,87 percent of Princeton's grad
uating class made a gift, 82 percent at
Yale and 72 percent at Harvard.
While competing with other schools
is not our primary objective, we want
seniors to know that we are not alone
in continuing this great tradition.
One of the most effective ways of
explaining the importance of sup
porting Stanford to our classmates
is by having one-on-one conversa
tions. We enlisted the help of 45 vol
unteers to ensure that we have re
spectful and productive conversa
tions with as many of our 1,600-plus
classmates as possible. Neither the
Senior Gift chairs and volunteers
nor The Stanford Fund want to
pressure or guilt-trip seniors into
giving. That said, we do need to be
diligent to ensure that every senior
understands the important role Se
nior Gift plays and has the opportu
nity to participate.
Why do we want seniors to con
sider giving back? Last year, 70 per
cent of the money raised by The
Stanford Fund went to undergradu
ate scholarships. The rest of the
money supported academic experi
ences like Stanford Introductory
Seminars and Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities, student
groups and a wide range of pro
grams including community centers.
Overseas Studies and the Haas Cen
ter. The Stanford Fund has con
tributed greatly to the richness of

our Stanford experience, and for
that we should all be grateful.
The Senior Gift campaign will
close on June 1. As of May 20, 482
seniors, or 30 percent of the class,
had contributed to Senior Gift. We
know that our class can do better.
Please consider making your Senior
Gift to ensure that that tomorrow's
students have the same great under
graduate experience we had.

Hennessy's involvement in Google
represents a conflict of interest
I am writing because 1 am con
cerned at the lack of depth by The
Stanford Daily in its probing of the ad
ministration of this University. Your
paper's mission is (in part) to make
public the decisions of our leaders and
serve as a check on their actions.
In particular, 1 am writing in
reply to the article "I'm feeling
lucky: Stanford set to reap millions
from Google IPO" (May 21).
There is a conflict of interest pre
sent in University President John
Hennessy's personal windfall from
Google. As a member of this com
pany's board of directors fora peri
od of one month, he will receive ap
proximately $6.5 million. (Esti
mates are that the options are worth
$100 each; the final price can not be
determined until the IPO auction.)
This makes one wonder, to whom
does Hennessy owe his allegiance?
His office claims that he will re
cuse himself in direct dealings be
tween Stanford and Google. How
ever, he can still exert indirect influ
ence in these dealings.
Hennessy's acceptance of this
board position shows an error in
judgment by our president. His fur
ther decision to line his own pockets
at the potential expense of Stanford
(and its students) is an action unbe

coming that of his office.
The Daily should include more
analysis in its reporting and air the
significant issues buried in a story.
There is a clear conflict of interest in
this matter. For our institution to
maintain its credibility, the presi
dent's actions must be beyond ques
tion. The president should more
than pay lip service to this matter;
he should donate his 65,000 options
to the University to which he owes
his primary and whole allegiance.

Coach Montgomery deserves
our thanks, not criticism
As a Stanford basketball fan for
20 years, I just want to say "thank
you" to Mike Montgomery for
putting Stanford men's basketball
on the map. When most current un
dergraduates were either still in di
apers or just a twinkle in their par
ents' eyes, Stanford basketball
stunk — absolutely stunk. The
team was 11-17 during my fresh
man year.
Tom Davis was the coach, and al
though he brought in some quality
recruits such as Todd Lichti and
Howard Wright, Stanford was clear
ly just a stop on the way to bigger
and better things for him. He was
gone to lowa before we even knew
who he was.
But then-Athletic Director
Andy Geiger hired Montgomery,
and almost immediately things
began to change. The recruiting
picked up — "Big Red" Adam
Keefe was the first true blue chip
player Montgomery brought to
Stanford, but that was really just the
beginning. The parade of talent only
seemed to increase year after year,
and Stanford men's basketball
gained national recognition.
I think that Stanford fans who
are critical of either Montgomery
for leaving or Ted Leland for not
keeping Montgomery are selfish
and spoiled. We were privileged to

have had Tyrone Willingham as
our football coach for seven years.
We were similarly privileged to
have had Montgomery at Stanford
for 18 years.
That being said, I certainly hope
that Ted Leland exercises better
judgment in choosing who fills
Montgomery's shoes than he did in
filling Willingham's. The expecta
tions are much higher, that is for
sure. Now, repeat after me: Mark
Few. Mark Few. Mark Few. *

Fashion industry not to blame for
proliferation of eating disorders
I am writing to express my dis
may at the "About Face" article ("
'About Face' presents at Stanford,"
May 21). I would like to first state
that 1 think eating disorders are ter
rible illnesses that need serious
medical treatment, and I also do not
think that the stated "5-feet-ll
inches tall, 120 pounds" qualities
necessarily represents beauty. I am,
however, sick of all of these articles
blaming anorexia / bulimia on the
fashion industry.
If it were the case that our society
venerated and found Rubenesque
women to be beautiful, then the eat
ing disorders would shift to the
other side; namely, you would have
many women overeating to achieve
that "ideal perfection," which poses
serious health risks as well. Addi
tionally, magazines such as Cos
mopolitan or television shows such
as "The Swan" exist because con
sumers buy the magazines and
watch the television shows. The
problem does not lie within the
fashion and entertainment indus
tries themselves. The problem lies
with the consumers. If such images
bother you, then don't look at them.
Parents should carefully monitor
their children's viewing habits any
way. Just as you would shield a nine
year-old from violence, you should
shield her from these images as well.

Then maybe these industries won't
make profits anymore. Briefly see
ing a magazine cover at a grocery
store does not make me think that
their definition of beauty is my own
— much like looking at the cover of
a fishing magazine will not make me
suddenly want to go fishing.
How many people do you know
talk about how fat Elizabeth Hurley
looked after having her baby or how
much weight Renee Zellweger gained
for Bridget Jones's Diary? Or how
many times have you heard, "She's a
great actor... but she has a horse
face." People are simply fascinated by
this sort of thing, and the magazines
with blonde bimbos on them are
catering to society's aesthetics.
As for the criticism on the fashion
industry's "subservient or defensive
positions," 1 see nothing of the sort if
1 open my current issue of Harper's
Bazaar. I see healthy women who are
smiling. The only one characteristic
that stands out about them is the fact
that they are tall, which is purely a
quality for the purposes of clothing
design. They don't look like they're
crying; they don't look like they have
black eyes. In fact, I haven't seen
such a look since the heroin-chic
phase died out in the mid-19905, and
this is considered vile and reprehen
sible by many today.
High fashion also uses a wide va
riety of women to represent their
clothes, not just blondes. Ethiopian
Liya Kebede is the new face of Estee
Lauder. Voluptuous Liv Tyler has a
fragrance named for her by
Givenchy. You cannot generalize
the entire industry based on one ad
vertisement or one particular cloth
ing designer. There aren't only cry
ing, abused, subservient blondes
with big chests. Stop blaming others.
Maybe if people didn't shop at
Abercrombie, didn't think once
about "how fat she is" and never
made fun of that "beanpole" girl in
elementary school, then maybe they
can start complaining.
