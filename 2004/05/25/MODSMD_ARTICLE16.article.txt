Changes to pay structure
hurt graa students
I am glad that The Daily ran the
article "Stanford limits TA, RA
hours" (May 19), which is an impor
tant issue for the grad student popu
lation. However, I think the article
misses a critical point.
Much of the article makes it
sound as if the University is simply
responding to the new Federal Insur
ance Contributions Act (FICA) reg
ulation (presumably to help the stu
dent population in dealing with the
increase in taxes. On the contrary, it
seems that the University is using the
FICA change as a pretext for its own
policy changes that will further bur
den the grad student worker.
If you carefully read the Univer
sity memorandum and associated
documentation, the following, dis

concerting fact is clear. The FICA
tax would be $840, but the two op
tions presented by the University
would take even more out of the
grad student pocket: a total of
$1,056 or $1,100.
The first option is to be em
ployed as a 100-percent temp-work
er over the summer; this option
would incur $840 FICA tax and for
feit the $216 grad student health in
surance subsidy. The second option
is to be employed as a 90-percent re
search assistant, which forfeits
$I,loo+ in pay. In short, instead of
just letting students pay their $840
in FICA, the University is introduc
ing new policies that will extract an
additional $216-$260 from the grad
student pocket.
These are not small sums of money.
The Daily should not have perpetuat
ed this brand of dismissing the issue by

quoting Computer Science Prof. Ser
afim Batzoglou as saying that the "im
pact will be low because it is only a 10
percent difference."
If his pay, or any University em
ployee's pay, were cut by 10 per
cent, he or she should be extremely
upset. The effect is more extreme if
the base pay is relatively low to
begin with, as is the case with the
grad student population affected by
these new policies.
Finally, I would like to point out
that the FICA regulation on its own
is in some sense a positive change
for the grad student population. In
essence, it says that the University
should not be allowed to treat its
full-time summer grad employees as
second-class citizens, but must treat
them as "career employees."
