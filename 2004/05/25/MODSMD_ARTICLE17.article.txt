# Monty's tenure with Warriors could be golden

T T versity."
That's right folks, just as Tolu Thomas (Branner RA of
yesteryear) predicted on the Monty-madness e-mail list,
these are the words David Stern will be mouthing in just a
few short weeks. With Childress and the Warriors both ex
pected to have their date with destiny in the late lottery
picks, the scenario is not that unlikely, especially with Mont
gomery as the new "let's-be-honest-he'll-be-gone-in-two
years" Warriors coach.
Much more unlikely are the events that unfolded in front
of my own eyes this past weekend. Sandwiched between
viewings of "The Bachelor," in which Giants quarterback
Jesse Palmer set himself up for more locker-room hazing
than even Rush Limbaugh could try to justify, and MTV
painstakingly trying to edit Lindsay Lohan's smoldering
cigarette out of "Punk'd," I happened upon a piece of paper
no one should have seen.

In a miracle of flux capacitor propor
tions, while sauntering (so sometimes I
skip like a schoolgirl, wanna fight?) past
Maples this weekend, I found this: a sec
tion of Sports Illustrated dated exactly one
year from now. Without any further ado,
here is the section of the article I found,
reprinted in all its glory:
"... of course the story of these play
offs has been the Golden State Warriors.
Who knew that this ragtag bunch, headed
by a coach we, and they, only knew as suc-

cessful in the collegiate ranks could make it this far in the
playoffs after being a 37-45 team the year before?
"Mike Montgomery knew.
'it would seem this way, as Monty was able to put to
gether one of the more remarkable turnarounds in recent
memory, with an even more remarkable strategy.
" 'You know,' Montgomery said, 'basketball is basket
ball, and this whole college to pro jump is very overrated, in
my opinion. 1 mean, watch "Hoosiers." The basket is still 10
feet high in the Oakland Coliseum.'
"Of course, the story is almost cliche by now, starting with
the Warriors selecting Josh Childress in the first round of the
NBA draft, followed closely by myriad surprising releases,
signings, trades and in one case, exorcism.
" in that same vein,' Monty continued, 'I knew all my
guys from Stanford knew my off ense, knew the type of team
I wanted and knew how to win games. Making them all War
riors was just the next logical step.'
"So after trading Speedy Claxton for Brevin Knight, Nick
Van Exel for Casey Jacobsen and Jason Richardson and
Troy Murphy in a three-team trade that netted Curtis Bor
chardt and both Collins twins, all that was left was Mark
Madsen.
" 'Without Mad Dog," Montgomery continued, 'this
team just wouldn't have taken shape the way it did. People
thought that I already had the big. tall, white, hustle guy po
sition taken after taking Joe [Kirchofer] in the second round
of the draft but there is a motto I like to live by: If having a
lot of intense bench guys who clap a lot is wrong, then I don't
want to be right!'
"By trading Adonal Foyle to the defending champion
Timberwolves in return for Madsen, the team really started
to take form.
" in preseason workouts, though, something just wasn't
right. We had Mark, Casey, Josh, Jason [Collins] and Brevin,
but one player just wasn't gelling with the rest.'
"That player, of course, was Mike Dunleavy.
" i [expletive] hate Dunleavy,' said an emotional Casey
Jacobsen. i [expletive] hated him in college, I [expletive]
hate him now, I will [expletive] hate him in the future. Monty
may live by his slogan, but I live by mine: There is only room
for one three-point shooter who can pass for an 11 -year old
boy from the suburbs on a team and it better be me. Hell,
after he got blonde highlights, 1 knew he was trying to be like
me â€” it was impossible to tell us apart! And when he start
ed listening to Blink-182 after I said 1 liked to listen to
"What's my Name Again?" before games, I was so pissed.
What was he going to do next, start eating my Gogurt?'
" 'Yeah, we had to let Mike go, which was sad for me,'
Montgomery said.' I thought that since he came out of Duke,
he would be a smart guy, able to overcome our collegiate ri
valries for the cause of a bigger goal. But when we released
him, it was the weirdest thing, he started breaking out in a
sweat, repeating the word "Kay" while frothing at the
mouth. He turned blue before we called in an exorcist, real
izing it was a Duke Blue Devil that had poisoned his
preadolescent mind. Poor guy.'
"After Dunleavy's departure, it was Jacobsen and Chil
dress leading the team in scoring, with impassioned re
bounding coming out of Madsen, all complementing the sti
fling team defense, which cemented the Warriors' claim to
being a true contender.
" 'You know,' said backup point guard Tony Giovacchi
ni, brought back from Italy to pick up his dribble at half court
game after game after aggravating game, 'we may not score
the most points as some teams, and we may not throw up a
lot of alley-oops, but we get the job done, and I think people
can respect that.'
"Matt Lottich, rivaling Jacobsen's claim to be the only 11 -
year old kid from suburbia on the team, agreed with Gio
vacchini. 'We always just find a way to win. It may not be
pretty, it may not be sexy, but we find a way.'
"In fact, the Warriors were able to find a way to the play
offs, scaring up the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference.
They beat the Mavericks in six games, stunning Dallas with
a last-second Jacobsen bomb.
"However, it was the second round that did Montgomery
in again, what with the Kobe Bryant-led Spurs eliminating
Golden State in five games. But what an incredible season
for the Warriors, prompting many to wonder if Chris Her
nandez will leave Stanford early this year, after leading the
Cardinal to"
And that's where the article cut off."
The point? Have faith in Montgomery. He's a great
coach, on any level.
