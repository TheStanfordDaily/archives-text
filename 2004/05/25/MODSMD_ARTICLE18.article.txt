## Tennis falls to USC at NCAAs 
### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's all over.
After making it through the first
three rounds of the NCAA Champi
onships, the lOth-seeded Stanford men's
tennis team was cut down, 4-0, by No. 2
Southern California. It was the first time
in the tournament's history that USC has
defeated Stanford.
It was also the first time that Stanford
has been completely shut out since the
beginning of the 2003-2004 season.
The Cardinal looked strong coming
into the third round when it took on No.
7 Florida on Saturday. It turned out to be
one of the toughest matches that Stan
ford has seen all year.
Stanford grabbed the early lead by
claiming the doubles point, a key fac
tor in winning the match. At the No. 2
spot, sophomore K.C. Corkery and ju
nior Phil Sheng teamed up to take an
8-5 victory over Florida's Vlad
Obradovic and Janne Holmia. The dy
namic duo of sophomore James Fade
and freshman James Wan clinched the
point, battling fora 9-7 win over Stef
Tell and Marty Stiegwardt.
From there on, there was nothing to
do but battle it out to the finish in singles.
At court three. No. 102 Wan suffered
an uncharacteristically tough loss, 6-0.6-
1. dropping his season record to 27-5.
Pac-10 Player of the Year and No. 8 ju
nior Sam Warburg evened the playing
field by capturing a 6-4,6-2 win over Flori
da's Ham Mirzadeh. The Pac-10 singles
champion improved his record to 31-7.
Holmia responded with a win on
court three, evening the match at 2-2.
The Gator took three sets to slip past No.
65 Corkery, 4-6,6-3,6-2.
Pade, the savior of Stanford's second
round match against Washington, pulled
off another crucial win by downing Flori
da's Obradovic, 7-5, 1-6,6-4.
But the Gators would not fold. Chris
Brandi took a 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 win over
Sheng before senior team captain Carter
Morris sealed the deal for the Cardinal,
taking a 6-7, 6-3, 7-6 victory over Ryan

Sherry. Stanford took the match, 4-3.
Sunday's match against USC was a
completely different story. The Cardinal
wasn't able to produce a single point,
ending its quest for the 2004 champi
onship trophy.
The doubles point was the first to go,
but the Cardinal didn't give it up without
a fight. On court three, Pade / Wan were
dealt a 9-7 loss by USC's Parker Collins
and Ruben Torres. Corkery / Sheng
soon followed suit by losing, 8-6, to No.
18 Drew Hoskins and Daniel Langre at
the No. 2 spot.
Stanford was unable to rebound and lost
the next three singles matches to fall, 4-0.
Wan struggled through a 6-0,6-1 loss
to No. 82 Johan Berg. The freshman re
cently was awarded the Pac-10 Co-New
comer of the Year award.
Fellow freshman Chris Rasmussen
was defeated on court six by Hoskins, 6-
3,6-2.
The last point went to USC on court
five, where No. 105 Torres downed
Pade, 6-2,7-5.
"We played a very good team today,"
said Stanford head coach Dick Gould.
"We played them twice. We know how
good they can be ... If you're going to
lose, you might as well lose to a classy
group like SC, and someone that you re
spect, and we do."
There is still a chance for some mem
bers of the team to come home with a
championship ring, though. The saving
grace could come in the form of a singles
or doubles title for some of the Stanford
players who were accepted into the indi
vidual draw.
On Wednesday, Warburg will com
pete in the singles draw and team up with
Corkery to compete in doubles. War
burg will go into the tournament as the
No. 8 seed, while Corkery will be the
fourth alternate.
The match against USC was Gould's
last as head coach. The tennis legend is
stepping down from his position and as
suming the role of Director of Tennis.
"Someone asked me, when we played
our last match at home, was that nostal
gic," Gould said. "That kind of blew my

mind a little bit, because I hadn't thought
about it being nostalgic at all, and then
today. You don't think about it. You're
out there trying to win a match, and
doing all you can do to win it.
"Maybe tonight I can sit back and

think about it some. There's just so much
going on during the match, that you can't
[think about it]. If your mind wanders
like that, you're going to get your butt
kicked. But, right now, I haven't had a

chance to think about it. Right now, I wish
I was coming back tomorrow."
The team will miss Gould, especially
for everything he's done for the tennis pro
gram at Stanford.
"I'm glad that he was able to have so

many awesome experiences and match
es like yesterday's match [against Flori
da]," Warburg said. "I remember him
saying it was one of the closest and
longest matches he's ever seen in
NCAA history, and for him, it's quite a
history. I mean, 17 titles. He's been
around the block and back. He's done
pretty much everything you could ask
and more. I'm just proud, happy and
honored to be part of his team."
