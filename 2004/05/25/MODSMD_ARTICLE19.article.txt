# Men's track heads to West Regional
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's crunch time for the Stan
ford men's track and field team as
it heads to Cal State-Northridge
this weekend for the NCAA
West Regional Championships.
After a soft sixth-place finish
at the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships, the Cardinal
will he looking to regroup and
send as many athletes as possible
to the NCAA Championships to
be held in Austin, Texas, in June.
Started last year as an effort
to increase the number of par
ticipants at the National Cham
pionships, the regional qualify
ing format will be used again
this year.
Despite being met with criti
cism from top coaches and ath
letes, including former Stanford
head coach Vin Lananna, the re
gional system appears to have
helped many teams, including
Stanford, send more athletes
than would have qualified under
the old system without jeopar
dizing the quality of the field.
Formerly, athletes would try
to hit automatic and provisional
marks, from which fields of 16 to
18 individuals or 12 to 14 relay
teams would be chosen.
Now, athletes must hit re
gional qualifying marks, which
are slightly easier to obtain. The
top five individuals and three re
lays from each region earn auto
matic bids to the NCAA Cham
pionships, while approximately

seven additional individuals and
relay teams are selected to par
ticipate based on time.
The only events excluded
from this qualifying format are
the decathlon and the 10,000-
meter run, which are still under
the old system due to the ex
treme endurance required for
these events.
Last year, Stanford's 1,600-
meter relay team had not run fast
enough to qualify for the NCAA
Championships under the old
system, but because the team was
competitive, it won the regional
and earned a berth to nationals.
The squad hopes to capitalize
on this opportunity again, as
Stanford is fielding several new or
young athletes along with its de
fending regional champions and
veterans of national competition.
"Our goal, like most pro
grams, is to qualify as many
people as possible to the na
tional meet," said men's head
coach Robert Weir. "We won't
worry too much about the team
score. If it works out well, that's
good, but that's not the focus of
the meet."
Top track schools from the
West like Brigham Young,
Northern Arizona and Cal Poly
will join the Pac-10 schools in
Northridge this weekend.
Defending regional 5,000
champion Louis Luchini, a se
nior, set a school record of 13
minutes, 25.11 seconds at the dis
tance at the Mt. San Antonio Col
lege Relays. He will again be a fa

vorite for the regional title as well
as the NCAA title but will be se
riously challenged by Arizona's
Robert Cheseret, who became
the first person to win the 1,500,
5.000 and 10.000 in the same meet
at the Pac-10 Championships.
Luchini is joined in the 5,000
by seven other Stanford runners,
including senior Seth Hejny,who
finished fourth at the NCAA
Championships a year ago, and
sophomore Ryan Hall, who fin
ished second at the NCAA Cross
Country Championships last fall.
Ail-Americans redshirt ju
nior Chris Emme and redshirt
sophomore Neil Davis are also
entered in the 5,000.
The 1,500 will feature the
2002 and 2003 NCAA 1,500-
meter champions, redshirt ju
nior Don Sage and senior Grant
Robsion. Robison claimed the
regional title last year and is cur
rently ranked third in the region,
while Sage has the top time in
the West and the nation's No. 2
time overall.
Both Sage and Grant Robi
son will have to contend with
BYU's Nathan Robison, anoth
er NCAA and Olympic Trials
contender. While the Stanford
runners should have the upper
hand in a fast race, Nathan Robi
son could upset the defending
champions in a tactical race.
Redshirt junior lan Dobson,
the second-ranked collegiate
10,0(K) runner, will move down to

the 3,000-meter steeplechase. Despite being
ranked seventh in the region coming in. Dob
son, the Pac-10 runner-up at the event, is still
considered a contender for the regional
crown and a berth to nationals.
"Grant Robison and Don Sage have
won the 1,500 title the last two years, lan
Dobson has done great things for the pro
gram this year and Louis Luchini has had a
great season," Weir said. "These are really
the MVPs of the team this year. We will
rely on these athletes to score our primary
points at nationals."
In the 800, redshirt sophomore Justin Ro
maniuk is currently ranked fifth in the region
and seems to be coming on strong late in the
season. Freshman Joaquin Chapa and red
shirt junior Evan Fox will also be contenders

in the 800 alongside Romaniuk, since they all
scored at the Pac-10 meet.
Besides the strong distance corps, Stan
ford will also field several sprinters, throwers
and jumpers with legitimate chances of quali
fying for NCAAs.
Redshirt junior Nick Sebes may be the
Cardinal's best shot at getting an individual
sprinter to the nationals. The 400 specialist is
currently ranked sixth in the region and
dropped his personal best nearly a second at
the Pac-10 Championships.
Not to be forgotten, though, is Stanley
Wilson, who, after just one week of train
ing, won the 100 at the Big Meet and fin
ished fifth at the Pac-10 Championships.
Wilson is currently ranked seventh in the
event in the region.
Both athletes will join sophomore T.J.
Rushing, junior Curt Goehring and freshman
David Marrero in some combination to make
up the 400- and 1,600-meter relay teams.
After coming out of nowhere to post a
regional qualifying mark at the Pac-10

Championships, the 1,600-meter relay
team will look to defend its regional title,
while both relays now have a chance to
qualify for NCAAs.
In the jumps, sophomore Solomon Welch
will contend fora spot at the NCAA Champi
onships in the triple jump after finishing sev
enth at the Pac-10 Championships.
Senior Jay Goff looks to return to the na
tional scene, this time in the javelin instead of
the decathlon. Goff is currently ranked 11th
in the region, but he is within 10 feet of fourth
place in an event where 10 feet can often eas
ily be made up.
In the discus, junior Will O'Neill will at
tempt to qualify for nationals after having a
breakout season, which has put him within
striking distance of some of the region's
top throwers.
Competition for the men opens on Fri
day at 3:15 pm with the preliminary rounds
of the 400 relay. The event concludes on
Saturday evening with the running of the
1,600 relay.

veterans of national competition.
"Our goal, like most pro
grams, is to qualify as many
people as possible to the na

coach Robert Weir. "We won't
worry too much about the team
score. If it works out well, that's
good, but that's not the focus of
the meet."
Top track schools from the
West like Brigham Young,
Northern Arizona and Cal Poly
will join the Pac-10 schools in
Northridge this weekend.
Defending regional 5,000
champion Louis Luchini, a se
nior, set a school record of 13
minutes, 25.11 seconds at the dis
tance at the Mt. San Antonio Col
lege Relays. He will again be a fa

vorite for the regional title as well
as the NCAA title but will be se
riously challenged by Arizona's
Robert Cheseret, who became
the first person to win the 1,500,
5.000 and 10.000 in the same meet
at the Pac-10 Championships.
Luchini is joined in the 5,000
by seven other Stanford runners,
including senior Seth Hejny,who
finished fourth at the NCAA
Championships a year ago, and
sophomore Ryan Hall, who fin
ished second at the NCAA Cross
Country Championships last fall.
Ail-Americans redshirt ju
nior Chris Emme and redshirt
sophomore Neil Davis are also
entered in the 5,000.
The 1,500 will feature the
2002 and 2003 NCAA 1,500-
meter champions, redshirt ju
nior Don Sage and senior Grant
Robsion. Robison claimed the
regional title last year and is cur
rently ranked third in the region,
while Sage has the top time in
the West and the nation's No. 2
time overall.
Both Sage and Grant Robi
son will have to contend with
BYU's Nathan Robison, anoth
er NCAA and Olympic Trials
contender. While the Stanford
runners should have the upper
hand in a fast race, Nathan Robi
son could upset the defending
champions in a tactical race.
Redshirt junior lan Dobson,
the second-ranked collegiate
10,0(K) runner, will move down to

the 3,000-meter steeplechase. Despite being
ranked seventh in the region coming in. Dob
son, the Pac-10 runner-up at the event, is still
considered a contender for the regional
crown and a berth to nationals.
"Grant Robison and Don Sage have
won the 1,500 title the last two years, lan
Dobson has done great things for the pro
gram this year and Louis Luchini has had a
great season," Weir said. "These are really
the MVPs of the team this year. We will
rely on these athletes to score our primary
points at nationals."
In the 800, redshirt sophomore Justin Ro
maniuk is currently ranked fifth in the region
and seems to be coming on strong late in the
season. Freshman Joaquin Chapa and red
shirt junior Evan Fox will also be contenders

in the 800 alongside Romaniuk, since they all
scored at the Pac-10 meet.
Besides the strong distance corps, Stan
ford will also field several sprinters, throwers
and jumpers with legitimate chances of quali
fying for NCAAs.
Redshirt junior Nick Sebes may be the
Cardinal's best shot at getting an individual
sprinter to the nationals. The 400 specialist is
currently ranked sixth in the region and
dropped his personal best nearly a second at
the Pac-10 Championships.
Not to be forgotten, though, is Stanley
Wilson, who, after just one week of train
ing, won the 100 at the Big Meet and fin
ished fifth at the Pac-10 Championships.
Wilson is currently ranked seventh in the
event in the region.
Both athletes will join sophomore T.J.
Rushing, junior Curt Goehring and freshman
David Marrero in some combination to make
up the 400- and 1,600-meter relay teams.
After coming out of nowhere to post a
regional qualifying mark at the Pac-10

Championships, the 1,600-meter relay
team will look to defend its regional title,
while both relays now have a chance to
qualify for NCAAs.
In the jumps, sophomore Solomon Welch
will contend fora spot at the NCAA Champi
onships in the triple jump after finishing sev
enth at the Pac-10 Championships.
Senior Jay Goff looks to return to the na
tional scene, this time in the javelin instead of
the decathlon. Goff is currently ranked 11th
in the region, but he is within 10 feet of fourth
place in an event where 10 feet can often eas
ily be made up.
In the discus, junior Will O'Neill will at
tempt to qualify for nationals after having a
breakout season, which has put him within
striking distance of some of the region's
top throwers.
Competition for the men opens on Fri
day at 3:15 pm with the preliminary rounds
of the 400 relay. The event concludes on
Saturday evening with the running of the
1,600 relay.
It's crunch time for the Stan
ford men's track and field team as
it heads to Cal State-Northridge
this weekend for the NCAA
West Regional Championships.
After a soft sixth-place finish
at the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships, the Cardinal
will he looking to regroup and
send as many athletes as possible
to the NCAA Championships to
be held in Austin, Texas, in June.
Started last year as an effort
to increase the number of par
ticipants at the National Cham
pionships, the regional qualify
ing format will be used again
this year.
Despite being met with criti
cism from top coaches and ath
letes, including former Stanford
head coach Vin Lananna, the re
gional system appears to have
helped many teams, including
Stanford, send more athletes
than would have qualified under
the old system without jeopar
dizing the quality of the field.
Formerly, athletes would try
to hit automatic and provisional
marks, from which fields of 16 to
18 individuals or 12 to 14 relay
teams would be chosen.
Now, athletes must hit re
gional qualifying marks, which
are slightly easier to obtain. The
top five individuals and three re
lays from each region earn auto
matic bids to the NCAA Cham
pionships, while approximately

seven additional individuals and
relay teams are selected to par
ticipate based on time.
The only events excluded
from this qualifying format are
the decathlon and the 10,000-
meter run, which are still under
the old system due to the ex
treme endurance required for
these events.
Last year, Stanford's 1,600-
meter relay team had not run fast
enough to qualify for the NCAA
Championships under the old
system, but because the team was
competitive, it won the regional
and earned a berth to nationals.
The squad hopes to capitalize
on this opportunity again, as
Stanford is fielding several new or
young athletes along with its de
fending regional champions and
veterans of national competition.
