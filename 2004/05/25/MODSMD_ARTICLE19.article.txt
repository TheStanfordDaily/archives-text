# Men's track heads to West Regional
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's crunch time for the Stan
ford men's track and field team as
it heads to Cal State-Northridge
this weekend for the NCAA
West Regional Championships.
After a soft sixth-place finish
at the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships, the Cardinal
will he looking to regroup and
send as many athletes as possible
to the NCAA Championships to
be held in Austin, Texas, in June.
Started last year as an effort
to increase the number of par
ticipants at the National Cham
pionships, the regional qualify
ing format will be used again
this year.
Despite being met with criti
cism from top coaches and ath
letes, including former Stanford
head coach Vin Lananna, the re
gional system appears to have
helped many teams, including
Stanford, send more athletes
than would have qualified under
the old system without jeopar
dizing the quality of the field.
Formerly, athletes would try
to hit automatic and provisional
marks, from which fields of 16 to
18 individuals or 12 to 14 relay
teams would be chosen.
Now, athletes must hit re
gional qualifying marks, which
are slightly easier to obtain. The
top five individuals and three re
lays from each region earn auto
matic bids to the NCAA Cham
pionships, while approximately

seven additional individuals and
relay teams are selected to par
ticipate based on time.
The only events excluded
from this qualifying format are
the decathlon and the 10,000-
meter run, which are still under
the old system due to the ex
treme endurance required for
these events.
Last year, Stanford's 1,600-
meter relay team had not run fast
enough to qualify for the NCAA
Championships under the old
system, but because the team was
competitive, it won the regional
and earned a berth to nationals.
The squad hopes to capitalize
on this opportunity again, as
Stanford is fielding several new or
young athletes along with its de
fending regional champions and
veterans of national competition.
"Our goal, like most pro
grams, is to qualify as many
people as possible to the na
tional meet," said men's head
coach Robert Weir. "We won't
worry too much about the team
score. If it works out well, that's
good, but that's not the focus of
the meet."
Top track schools from the
West like Brigham Young,
Northern Arizona and Cal Poly
will join the Pac-10 schools in
Northridge this weekend.
Defending regional 5,000
champion Louis Luchini, a se
nior, set a school record of 13
minutes, 25.11 seconds at the dis
tance at the Mt. San Antonio Col
lege Relays. He will again be a fa

vorite for the regional title as well
as the NCAA title but will be se
riously challenged by Arizona's
Robert Cheseret, who became
the first person to win the 1,500,
5.000 and 10.000 in the same meet
at the Pac-10 Championships.
Luchini is joined in the 5,000
by seven other Stanford runners,
including senior Seth Hejny,who
finished fourth at the NCAA
Championships a year ago, and
sophomore Ryan Hall, who fin
ished second at the NCAA Cross
Country Championships last fall.
Ail-Americans redshirt ju
nior Chris Emme and redshirt
sophomore Neil Davis are also
entered in the 5,000.
The 1,500 will feature the
2002 and 2003 NCAA 1,500-
meter champions, redshirt ju
nior Don Sage and senior Grant
Robsion. Robison claimed the
regional title last year and is cur
rently ranked third in the region,
while Sage has the top time in
the West and the nation's No. 2
time overall.
Both Sage and Grant Robi
son will have to contend with
BYU's Nathan Robison, anoth
er NCAA and Olympic Trials
contender. While the Stanford
runners should have the upper
hand in a fast race, Nathan Robi
son could upset the defending
champions in a tactical race.
Redshirt junior lan Dobson,
the second-ranked collegiate
10,0(K) runner, will move down to
