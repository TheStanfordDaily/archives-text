Acanthus Arts, a Web site dedicated to showcasing the art
work of Stanford students and alumni, was created by senior
Molly Aeck and her brother Richard as a response to the
unique difficulties facing students looking fora career in the
world of art.
The Web site allows visitors to browse electronic galleries
of artwork, and also enables collectors or gallery representa
tives to contact individual artists featured on the site.
Aeck said she was inspired to establish a Web-based gallery
in order to meet the particular needs of those aspiring to be
come professional artists.
"Forging a professional career as an artist is not a 'one size
fits all' endeavor," she explained. "It is more difficult to help
artists access summer internships, display their work or secure
apprenticeships after graduation."
Aeck added that she and her brother started Acanthus in
the summer of 2002 hoping to "empower the independent vi
sual artist by directly connecting them with the mass commu
nication benefits inherent in today's technological advances."
The Aecks began recruiting Stanford student artists in the
fall of 2003. Last month, they held a workshop designed to in
form student artists of the resources available through their
Web site.
Acanthus has moved beyond the virtual world and be
come a resource in establishing connections between stu
dent and professional artists. Though the Career Develop
ment Center does not offer these services, it has recently
begun working with Acanthus to provide students with re
sources to support career pursuits in the arts. The Aecks
said they also plan to develop a physical space in which to
set up an office and display some of the artwork featured on
http://www.acanthusarts.org.
Aeck has been working to obtain the funds that will allow
Acanthus to become an even greater resource. She said she
hopes to obtain server-side technology that will allow artists
themselves to design, establish and maintain their own gal
leries on the Web site. Despite what Aeck described as a lack

"In a rigorous and serious aca

often overlooked, neglected or

creative arts and professional
