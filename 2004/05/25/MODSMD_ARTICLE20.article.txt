# Softball team provides thrills, memory

### JACQUELINE CRESPO GUEST COLUMNIST 
The end of spring quarter always comes like an
unexpected storm, and, looking back on my last
three years on the Farm, somehow I find myself pro
crastinating in the eye of it. So many times I have
asked graduating seniors for their favorite Stanford
experience or Stanford moment. Some answers are
quite unexpected; 1 know a few of my friends claim it
was Nick Robinson's 3-pointer at the buzzer and the
ensuing storming of the court. Many follow suit with
my own favorite â€” Band Run of fall quarter of
freshman year. I didn't expect this Sunday to change
any of that.

But it did. I bought only my second ticket ever to
watch a Stanford softball game. The Cardinal was
hosting the regional championships and the ticket
was technically worth two games if Stanford lost the
first game and was forced to play a second. No. I am
not a latecomer to the coolness that is Stanford soft
ball, it's just that the past two years I got to watch the
games for free as a student manager of the team.
Some lame reasoning like focusing more on
finding my "academic passion" left me only to ad
mire from afar for most of this season. In fact, it was
only last week that 1 saw my first Stanford softball
game of the year. Pathetic reasoning to be sure, if
only for the bare fact that I know a roster of 17 stel
lar women who can handle both their athletic and

academic passions. I dare anyone to contest the
out-of-control talent and smarts of our Softball
team. No longer a walking Nike advertisement cov
ered with swooshes, I took my seat at Boyd and Jill
Smith Family Stadium.
I sat at the very front, wanting to make sure I was
in a good position to take a picture when the Card
pulled off its victory. I sat there stunned after I saw
them go down in heart-breaking fashion in the first
game, 1-0. 1 didn't expect to be coming back fora
second game, but it was worth every second.
With two outs and two runners on base, pitcher
Dana Sorensen shut Hofstra down, forcing their
final batter to ground out to third
baseman Liz Bendig. That final
at-bat only lasted 31 seconds, but
I finally get it now. I understand
the craze around Robinson's fa
mous shot against Arizona. And
this Cardinal team did it without
eight thousand fans on hand.

So long. Band Run. My
friends can have their famous
shot, but my favorite Stanford
experience will be watching the
Stanford Softball team seal their
win with Bendig's flawless throw
to first and the pop of first base
man Leah Nelson's glove. The
final out, clinching a berth into
the Women's College World Se
ries, this alone stands as a testa
ment to the Stanford softball
team's passion and determina
tion both on and off the field. So

nobody stormed the field, but, by
golly, there should have been a
pool of students joining in the
celebration.
So perhaps when you take one
of the many study breaks to
come, you may click on gostan
ford.com and check out our soft
ball team's progress in the
WCWS. Heck, turn on the tele
vision, because it's not everyday
that you get to watch a wonderful
group of ladies giving the very
best of themselves for the love of

the game and the honor of their
school.
Regardless of what happens
in Oklahoma City, they will be
champions in my book. This
sports-crazed and procrastinat
ing junior will be glued to the
television smiling, inside and out,
proud and thankful that she was
able to know and watch such a
talented group of Stanford stu
dent athletes, if only fora little
while.
