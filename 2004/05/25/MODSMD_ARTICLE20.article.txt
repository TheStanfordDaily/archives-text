# Softball team provides thrills, memory

### JACQUELINE CRESPO GUEST COLUMNIST 
The end of spring quarter always comes like an
unexpected storm, and, looking back on my last
three years on the Farm, somehow I find myself pro
crastinating in the eye of it. So many times I have
asked graduating seniors for their favorite Stanford
experience or Stanford moment. Some answers are
quite unexpected; 1 know a few of my friends claim it
was Nick Robinson's 3-pointer at the buzzer and the
ensuing storming of the court. Many follow suit with
my own favorite â€” Band Run of fall quarter of
freshman year. I didn't expect this Sunday to change
any of that.

But it did. I bought only my second ticket ever to
watch a Stanford softball game. The Cardinal was
hosting the regional championships and the ticket
was technically worth two games if Stanford lost the
first game and was forced to play a second. No. I am
not a latecomer to the coolness that is Stanford soft
ball, it's just that the past two years I got to watch the
games for free as a student manager of the team.
Some lame reasoning like focusing more on
finding my "academic passion" left me only to ad
mire from afar for most of this season. In fact, it was
only last week that 1 saw my first Stanford softball
game of the year. Pathetic reasoning to be sure, if
only for the bare fact that I know a roster of 17 stel
lar women who can handle both their athletic and

academic passions. I dare anyone to contest the
out-of-control talent and smarts of our Softball
team. No longer a walking Nike advertisement cov
ered with swooshes, I took my seat at Boyd and Jill
Smith Family Stadium.
I sat at the very front, wanting to make sure I was
in a good position to take a picture when the Card
pulled off its victory. I sat there stunned after I saw
them go down in heart-breaking fashion in the first
game, 1-0. 1 didn't expect to be coming back fora
second game, but it was worth every second.
With two outs and two runners on base, pitcher
Dana Sorensen shut Hofstra down, forcing their
