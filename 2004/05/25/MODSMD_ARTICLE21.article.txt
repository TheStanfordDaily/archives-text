## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's golf team's performance at
the 2004 NCAA Championships was a lot like the weath
er on the Lake Course at Grand National in Opelika,
Ala., last weekend: It could've been a lot better and it
could've been a lot worse.
When play wrapped up on Saturday after Wednesday
and Friday's rounds were halted due to rain, the Cardi
nal finished tied for 12th with a four-round score of
1,195. UCLA captured its second team title with a four
under par 1,148, three strokes ahead of Oklahoma State.
The Pac-10 was well represented atop the leaderboard,
with Cal placing fourth, Washington tied for sixth and
Arizona State 10th. Last year's champion. Southern Cal

ifornia, tied for 12th with the Cardinal.
"The team performed well at NCAAs," said senior
Angela Rho, who tied for 37th individually with a
296. "It was a bit disappointing, with the weather de
lays and such, because we definitely gave some
strokes away in our final six holes of the tournament.
We were definitely looking to finish better than we
did, but by no means are we disappointed ending up
tied for 12th."
Stanford finished 16th at last year's tournament.
Freshman Lauren Todd delivered an impressive per
formance, including an even-par 72 in the third round
and a one-over-par 73 on Saturday to finish tied for 44th
with a 297. Sophomore Stephanie Lue carded a 303 to tie
for 69th and freshman Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana tied
for 88th with a 307 after a tough final two rounds of 77

and 81, respectively. Senior Kim Kouwabunpat fired a
one-over-par 73 in the third round and finished tied for
93rd with a 308.
Rho, who tied for 66th at last year's NCAAs, played
the best golf of any Cardinal at NCAAs, following up an
opening-round 76 by sandwiching another 76 between
two 725.
"Personally, I'm happy with my finish, especially
being able to post an even par 72 in my last round of col
legiate golf," Rho said. It's a great feeling to end with a
good round."
Stanford had high hopes heading into NCAAs, coming
off a strong third-place finish at the NCAA West Regional.
"This year's team saw flashes of brilliance, but again,
was unable to put it all together or perform to its poten
tial," Rho said. "I have complete confidence that next

year has greater things in store for [the team]."
While the women wrapped up play at NCAAs, the
Stanford men's golf team had its season come to a pre
mature end at the NCAA West Regional. The Cardinal
finished 24th with a three-round total of 921 at Sunriver
Resort's Crosswater Club in Sunriver, Ore.
Junior Kevin Blue was the Cardinal's top finisher,
carding a 223 to finish tied for 43rd. Freshman Matt Sav
age tied for 81st with a 230 and sophomore Kyle Gentry
tied for 110 th with a 234.
UCLA beat out New Mexico by a stroke to win the
team title with a one-over-par 865. The Bruins' Travis
Johnson and Arizona's Chris Nallen tied for top individ
ual honors with identical five-under-par 211s. Only the
top 10 teams from each regional qualifying round ad
vanced to the NCAA Championships.
