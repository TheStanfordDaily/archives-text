## U. of Minnesota circulates petition addressed to Bush 
### HAYLEY ODOM MINNESOTA DAILY 
(U-WIRE) MINNEAPOLIS —Approximately 300
University of Minnesota staff, faculty and graduate stu
dents signed a petition protesting the recent alleged pris
oner torture and abuse in Iraq.
A group of University professors and faculty started
the petition, "An Open Statement to President George
W. Bush," and circulated it around the University from
May 14 to May 19.
It urges the president to follow basic human rights
tenets in foreign policy, said Katherine Fennelly, a
Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs professor.
"It's important to get this message out to President
Bush in a timely fashion now that this issue is in the spot
light," Fennelly said.

She said the petition will be delivered to Sen. Mark
Dayton, D-Minn., on June 5.
She and others from the group hope to present it to
Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., as well.
In a statement released by his press office, Coleman
said he was shocked and appalled by the photographs
from Abu Ghraib, and said the abuses are not represen
tative of most U.S. soldiers.
Coleman's statement also called for swift and decisive
action from the Pentagon, and said those responsible
must be held accountable. His office did not comment
specifically on the petition.
Barb Frey, Institute for Global Studies program
director, said the petition is the brainchild of sev
eral University faculty and staff who wanted to
publicly show their concern about the recent
events in U.S. prisons in Iraq. The petition's

founders work in human rights programs or teach
classes on human rights.
She said the organizers met to discuss their con
cerns on May 10, and by May 14 the petition began
circulating.
"The least we could do (was) to encourage steps to be
taken to restore credibility and require immediate inves
tigation and disciplinary action against those who knew
the abuse was taking place," she said.
Frey said she wrote most of the petition. The main
points are taken from the Istanbul Protocol — an inter
national standard for the investigation of torture —
which Frey helped draft.
"These aren't just ideas we thought up as a group;
they're ideas that have evolved in the international com
munity for torture investigation," she said.
Frey said the petition was intended to appeal to the

entire spectrum of political opinion.
Other people who signed the petition agreed.
"Speaking out against war is one thing, speaking out
against torture is another," said Dr. Stephen Feinstein,
Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies director.
He also said people should be against torture regard
less of their views on the war in Iraq.
Graduate student Margot Canaday, who also signed
the petition, said the abuse could change the minds of
people who have been less critical of the war in Iraq.
"It's hard not to look at those photos and feel very
upset," she said.
Fennelly and Frey said the petition has traveled to
other universities and organizations via the Internet.
Both said even though the petition has ended, students
who did not sign the petition should contact their sena
tors to do so.
