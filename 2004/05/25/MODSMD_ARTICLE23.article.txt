### NARGES ZOHOURY DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES — A hill provid
ing guidelines for implementations of a textbook
rental program in the state's public colleges
passed the California State Assembly on May 20
with bipartisan support.
The bill, which will now move on to the state
Senate, was introduced by Assemblyman Paul
Koretz, D-West Hollywood, and sponsored by
the California Public Interest Research Group.
"The bill is not a mandate on schools, but a
strong encouragement," said Mark Thornton,
CALPIRG state board chairman and one of
the coordinators of the affordable textbooks
program.
He explained that the bill does not force any
higher-education institution to implement the
rental program, but provides guidelines for them.
He added that the bill is an encouragement
to get schools to decrease the cost of higher ed
ucation.
According to a press release dated May 20, the

rental program caps textbook rental fees at 50
percent of the cost of purchasing books, a mea
sure that many students say would benefit them.
Angelina Garefis, a fourth-year biology stu
dent, said she has spent up to $140 on a single
book and has gotten less than half that when she
sold the book back.
"If the loss of me buying the book is greater
than me renting it, I would definitely rent a
book," Garefis said.
In order for the program to work at UCLA, it
requires the cooperation of student government,
administration and faculty.
Thornton said there are a number of ways for
the cost of textbooks to be lowered, and this is
only one of them. He added that whether the pro-'
gram is implemented at UCLA depends on the
administration.
Even with the support of all parties involved,
the recent budget cuts can get in the way of
UCLA introducing a new program.
"(Right now) is a rough time to start this pro
gram." said Jolene Mitchell, CALPIRG chapter

chairwoman at UCLA, referring to the cuts that
the university is undergoing.
Mitchell said she would like to see UCLA
take part in the program, and added that she
and her group, which has been working with
Koretz, would be willing to cooperate with
the administrators to help publicize the
rental program.
Textbook rental services are currently in place
at 20 U.S. colleges and universities.
The hill also gives students the option of pur
chasing the books after renting them.
"Rental programs make more used books
available for purchase, allow substantial sav
ings for students — whether they are buying or
renting their books — and can actually make
more money for bookstores. This is a no-brain
er," Koretz said in a press release.
Mitchell said the bill's passing is a step forward
and shows that legislators see there is a problem
with the cost of textbooks.
"Publishers should take note of that," she
added.
