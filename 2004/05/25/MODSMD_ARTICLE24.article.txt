### ROBERT YOUNG THE CALIFORNIA AGGIE 
(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. â€”UC-
Davis first-year student Justin Bur
ton was arrested Sunday morning
on three counts by the UCD Police
Department for allegedly stabbing
a fellow UCD student.
Burton is charged with assault
with a deadly weapon, attempted
homicide and terrorist threats.
The UCDPD charged Burton
with terrorist threats because the
victim felt physical endangered by
Burton's comments, according to
spokesperson Paul Pfotenhauer.
Pfotenhauer said that the inci
dent began at approximately 2
a.m. Sunday, when Burton was in
volved in a verbal argument with
an ex-girlfriend at his residence at
Thoreau Hall.
Burton's former girlfriend called
her current boyfriend, a UCD
sophomore, to tell him about the in
cident, after Burton stormed out of
Thoreau Hall.
Burton and the current
boyfriend happened to meet out
side near the bike lanes on Russell
Boulevard, said the victim, who
asked not to be identified.
Burton allegedly pulled out a
knife and advanced on the victim.
The victim was stabbed three times

in the arm and Burton received fa
cial injuries in the ensuing fight, the
victim said.
"It was self defense," the victim
said of his own actions.
The two individuals were sepa
rated by people on the scene and
the victim was driven by a friend to
Sutter Davis Hospital where he was
treated and released at 4 a.m. In an
interview Sunday morning, the vic
tim reported being sore.
The hospital reported the inci
dent to the Davis Police Depart
ment who originally responded to
the crime scene. However, be
cause the incident began on UCD
property, the UCDPD took over
the investigation.
Around 3 a.m., UCDPD officers
arrested Burton at his residence and
brought him to Sutter Davis Hospi
tal fora blood test to determine
whether he was under the influence
of alcohol or drugs, Pfotenhauer
said. On Sunday, Pfotenhauer said
that he did not know the test results.
As of 4:30 p.m. Sunday, Burton
was still in police custody at Yolo
County Jail.
The UCDPD is conducting an
investigation and has yet to find the
weapon used in the stabbing.
Burton has not been cooperat
ing with police, according to
Pfotenhauer.
