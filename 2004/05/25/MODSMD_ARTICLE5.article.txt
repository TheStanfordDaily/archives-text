### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Llndergradu
ate Senate voted unanimous
ly last night to certify the re
sults of the special executive
election, bringing sopho
more slate Chioke Borgelt-
Mose and Kory Vargas Caro
one step closer to the ASSU
presidency and vice presi
dency, respectively.
The election results still
need the stamp of approval
from the Graduate Student
Council, which will con
vene Wednesday night to
vote on certification. How
ever, few foresee any com
plications in the GSC.
"There's always a chance
[that they won't be certi
fied]," said former GSC
Chair Steve Allison, a doc

toral candidate in biological
sciences. "But I have no rea
son to believe they won't be."
In contrast to the hours
of debate and controversy
that surrounded the certifi
cation of the original exec
utive election, last night's
vote to certify the special
election results lasted only
a few minutes.
Before voting, Elections
Commissioner Ellie Mar
tin, a junior, recommended
that the Senate certify the
results, but went on to note
that the Commission had
given similar advice re
garding the original results,
advice that was ignored by
the Senate.
"Of course, we recom
mended that you certify the
first results," she said. "But
since we know that won't

happen, [we recommend
you certify these results]."
Without discussion, a
vote was called, and the
Senate unanimously certi
fied the special-election re
sults â€” 13 in favor, none
opposed and one absten
tion from Senate Chair
Chris Lin, a junior.
After the vote, the Sen
ate burst into applause.
Following the meeting,
Vargas Caro, who was in at
tendance, sounded a hope
ful note about the upcom
ing year.
"I'm really excited," he said.
Vargas Caro also ex
pressed optimism about his
ability to work closely with
the Senate.
"I know some of the sen
ators on a personal level,"
he added.
