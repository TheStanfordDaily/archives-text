### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
In an effort to create a
stronger support network for
gay and lesbian University em
ployees, several staff members
have founded Queer Universi
ty Employees at Stanford
(QUEST), a new minority ad
vocacy group that recently re
ceived official recognition from
the Stanford administration.

"We started off with this short
