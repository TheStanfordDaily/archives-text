# QUEST provides support network for LGBT staff
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
In an effort to create a
stronger support network for
gay and lesbian University em
ployees, several staff members
have founded Queer Universi
ty Employees at Stanford
(QUEST), a new minority ad
vocacy group that recently re
ceived official recognition from
the Stanford administration.
"I was really impressed
with the group's numbers
and their organization and
their enthusiasm," Rosa
Gonzalez, director of the
Diversity and Access Of
fice, told the Stanford News
Service. "I've had individu
als who have come up to me
for work-related issues and
they wished there was a
staff support group."
QUEST is a revived version
of a previous homosexual-staff
group. Out at Stanford, which
went dormant in 1997 when the
original leaders became less in
volved. Last year, several em
ployees reinstated what had
been an informal gathering
termed the Stanford Queer
Lunch and Cocktail Hour
(SQUELCH), making contact
with many other gay and les
bian staff and faculty members.
According to one of the
event's organizers, James Silva,

a software engineer at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, those who gathered at
SQUELCH and at subsequent
meetings and social activities
began to discuss the reestab
lishment of a permanent homo
sexual-staff group on campus.
These original members em
phasized the need fora more
high-profile gay and lesbian
employee community at Stan
ford that could help facilitate
networking and support.
"At the very least, we want
ed to create a space where peo
ple could meet each other and
interact socially," Silva said.
"We started off with this short
term goal and have since ex
panded our mission and goals."
He added that having an or
ganized and officially recog
nized group will hopefully cre
ate a broader social and sup
port network for lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgender em
ployees, increase the communi
ty's visibility within the larger
Stanford population, and raise
awareness around the issues af
fecting homosexual University
staff and faculty members.
"I feel that, as a whole, Stan
ford is a very supportive atmos
phere for lesbian and gay em
ployees," Silva said. "That does
not mean that there is not still
work to be done on creating a sup
portive atmosphere in all areas of
the University. It is important that
every LGBT employee on campus
feels that they can come out in a safe
and affirming environment."
When a person is the only lesbian
or gay member of a department or
division of the University, knowing
that he or she has a place in Stan
ford's diverse atmosphere can be an
enormous comfort, Silva said.
"If you are new to Stanford, it
might be difficult to figure out how
to get connected to other LGBT em
ployees," said Associate Dean of
Religious Life Joanne Sanders, a
QUEST member. "[Stanford has]
tremendous resources for students
that are highly visible and exception
ally effective — the LGBT-CRC for
example — and we wanted to be
able to see something available for
employees at Stanford as well."
Sanders said that although
Stanford provides a very warm
and supportive environment for
gay and lesbian students and em
ployees alike* but the resources
enjoyed by students should be
available for all members of the
Stanford community.
"From the day I began working

on campus, I have been tremendous
ly supported, so it leads me to be
lieve that in general, Stanford is a
very supportive place for LGBT em
ployees," she said. "I am confident
that the existence of a group like
QUEST can enhance and strength
en Stanford's overall commitment to
diversity among its employees."
QUEST is unofficially tied to the
LGBT-CRC, and members of both
organizations hope to collaborate
on future events and activities,
Sanders said. So far, the LGBT
CRC has helped QUEST publicize
its programming and recruit new
members and has even provided the
fledgling group with funding for up
coming events.
According to QUEST'S recently
launched Web site, the organiza
tion's three goals are to help make
Stanford a model institution on
LGBT issues, to foster connections
between members of the gay and les
bian staff community on campus and
to build a strong social network.
The group's official University
recognition will be formally an
nounced at this year's Multicultural
Springfest on May 27. At that time,
QUEST will take its place among
other staff-diversity organizations —
including the African American Staff
group, the Asian Staff Forum, the Dis
ability Staff Forum and the La Raza
Staff Association — to celebrate cul
tural art and minority expression.

According to QUEST'S recently
launched Web site, the organiza
tion's three goals are to help make
Stanford a model institution on
LGBT issues, to foster connections
between members of the gay and les
bian staff community on campus and
to build a strong social network.
The group's official University
recognition will be formally an
nounced at this year's Multicultural
Springfest on May 27. At that time,
QUEST will take its place among
other staff-diversity organizations —
including the African American Staff
group, the Asian Staff Forum, the Dis
ability Staff Forum and the La Raza
Staff Association — to celebrate cul
tural art and minority expression.
In an effort to create a
stronger support network for
gay and lesbian University em
ployees, several staff members
have founded Queer Universi
ty Employees at Stanford
(QUEST), a new minority ad
vocacy group that recently re
ceived official recognition from
the Stanford administration.
"I was really impressed
with the group's numbers
and their organization and
their enthusiasm," Rosa
Gonzalez, director of the
Diversity and Access Of
fice, told the Stanford News
Service. "I've had individu
als who have come up to me
for work-related issues and
they wished there was a
staff support group."
QUEST is a revived version
of a previous homosexual-staff
group. Out at Stanford, which
went dormant in 1997 when the
original leaders became less in
volved. Last year, several em
ployees reinstated what had
been an informal gathering
termed the Stanford Queer
Lunch and Cocktail Hour
(SQUELCH), making contact
with many other gay and les
bian staff and faculty members.
According to one of the
event's organizers, James Silva,

a software engineer at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, those who gathered at
SQUELCH and at subsequent
meetings and social activities
began to discuss the reestab
lishment of a permanent homo
sexual-staff group on campus.
These original members em
phasized the need fora more
high-profile gay and lesbian
employee community at Stan
ford that could help facilitate
networking and support.
"At the very least, we want
ed to create a space where peo
ple could meet each other and
interact socially," Silva said.
"We started off with this short
term goal and have since ex
panded our mission and goals."
He added that having an or
ganized and officially recog
nized group will hopefully cre
ate a broader social and sup
port network for lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgender em
ployees, increase the communi
ty's visibility within the larger
Stanford population, and raise
awareness around the issues af
fecting homosexual University
staff and faculty members.
"I feel that, as a whole, Stan
ford is a very supportive atmos
phere for lesbian and gay em
ployees," Silva said. "That does
not mean that there is not still
work to be done on creating a sup
portive atmosphere in all areas of
the University. It is important that
every LGBT employee on campus
feels that they can come out in a safe
and affirming environment."
When a person is the only lesbian
or gay member of a department or
division of the University, knowing
that he or she has a place in Stan
ford's diverse atmosphere can be an
enormous comfort, Silva said.
"If you are new to Stanford, it
might be difficult to figure out how
to get connected to other LGBT em
ployees," said Associate Dean of
Religious Life Joanne Sanders, a
QUEST member. "[Stanford has]
tremendous resources for students
that are highly visible and exception
ally effective — the LGBT-CRC for
example — and we wanted to be
able to see something available for
employees at Stanford as well."
Sanders said that although
Stanford provides a very warm
and supportive environment for
gay and lesbian students and em
ployees alike* but the resources
enjoyed by students should be
available for all members of the
Stanford community.
"From the day I began working

on campus, I have been tremendous
ly supported, so it leads me to be
lieve that in general, Stanford is a
very supportive place for LGBT em
ployees," she said. "I am confident
that the existence of a group like
QUEST can enhance and strength
en Stanford's overall commitment to
diversity among its employees."
QUEST is unofficially tied to the
LGBT-CRC, and members of both
organizations hope to collaborate
on future events and activities,
Sanders said. So far, the LGBT
CRC has helped QUEST publicize
its programming and recruit new
members and has even provided the
fledgling group with funding for up
coming events.
