## 
### SARAH LUSTBADEK DESK EDITOR 
Each year, aspiring journalists at Stanford have
the opportunity to apply for several scholarships
awarded by the Friends of The Stanford Daily Foun
dation. This year, six members of The Daily's staff —
sophomore Adrian Gaitan, juniors Anthony Ha,
Cynthia Cho and Bonita Song and seniors Will Ore
mus and Anna Galan — will be receiving funds to
further their interest in journalism.
Foundation board member Christy Wise, a former
Daily Opinions editor and a professional journalist, ex
pressed her enthusiasm for this year's group of scholar
ship recipients.
"We had more interest in the summer awards this

year than in the past several years," she said. "There
were several strong candidates for each award, and
the judges had a tough time narrowing them down. I
hope the award recipients have a great experience
this summer."
Oremus, who was recently elected editor in chief
for the upcoming fall volume of The Daily, received
a $750-per-week stipend from the foundation to in
tern this summer as a reporter at the San Jose Mer
cury News.
"It's a great opportunity for aspiring journalists,"
he said. "It's a particular honor to be following in the
footsteps of such a talented and organized Daily
staffer as Cynthia Cho. who received the Merc intern
ship last summer."
Ha, The Daily's managing editor of news, was award-

Ed the George Caulfield award. He said he will use the
$2,000 to work as an editorial intern at San Francisco
based political magazine Mother Jones.
"It made me really happy to have the work and time
I've put into The Daily recognized," Ha said. "Also, my
internship this summer doesn't pay a whole lot, so it's
great to be somewhat free from financial worries."
Galan was the recipient of the Newton and Nancy
Wise award — which grants a Daily staffer $1,500 to
work at a newspaper with a circulation below 100,000
readers — for the second year in a row.
"I'm really flattered to receive this award again,"
Galan said. "I'm looking forward to a career in journal
ism, and this sets me on my way."
Cho, who will be working as the managing editor of
news in the fall, will spend this summer as an intern at

The Wall Street Journal. She received the Harry Press
award, which gives a Daily staffer $5,000 to work at a
summer journalism internship or to continue working at
The Daily during his or her senior year.
Gaitan, Daily staff photographer, received the Julius
Jacobs award of $1,000. He expressed both surprise and
happiness upon receiving his award.
"It's sort of a surprise that I received the honor," he
said, 'it's very rewarding to see that Daily staffers, espe
cially new staffers, can eventually move up the prover
bial ladder of success. It's always fun to see that your
work is valued and that you can be recognized as an in
tegral part of the working staff of the newspaper."
Song, who received the $1,000 LosTrancos Sys
tems award in technical journalism, could not be
reached for comment.
