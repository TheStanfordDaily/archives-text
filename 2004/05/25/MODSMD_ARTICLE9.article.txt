## What your memory is telling you 
### 
I have a riddle for you. What's fleeting, processed continuously in the
background and can also last a lifetime? If you're stumped, the answer
involves a web of connections, electrochemical cabling and gradual
morphs — and you're probably making one right now. Give up?
It's a memory.
According to the National Institute of Neurological disorders and
Stroke, a single memory involves thousands of changes in the brain; from
gene expression, neuron formation and nerve signaling, to yet undiscov
ered neural mechanisms. These learning-induced changes are referred to
as "memory traces."

Where does the journey from fleeting event to regis
tered experience occur? That's a question scientists at
Baylor College of Medicine in Houston attempted to
answer. They created transgenic fruit flies with special
genes that caused their neuronal connections to be
come fluorescent during nerve signaling in the brain.
Their research, which appears in the May 13,2004 issue
of Neuron magazine, involved exposing the flies to
brief puffs of odor while they received a shock. This
caused the flies to learn a new association between
odor and the shock.
Fascinatingly, the scientists were able to see memo-

ry formation occur before their eyes. They watched the fluorescent signals
in the flies' brains with a high-powered microscope and discovered that
certain neurons, called projection neurons, had more active connections
after the conditioning.
"It's phenomenally powerful, like a movie appearing in front of you,"
said Ronald L. Davis. The study suggests that the earliest representation
of a new memory occurs by rapid changes — "like flipping a switch" — in
the number of neuronal connections that respond to the odor, rather than
by formation of new connections.
Memories are typically categorized as sensory, short-term and long
term. Sensory memory exists for each type of sensory stimuli channel
(e.g. audition, visual, touch) and serves to filter specific stimuli to short
term memory. Short-term memory (also known as working memory)
lasts very briefly (about 200 ms.) and lacks sufficient long-term reten
tion. The information that makes it to our short-term memory may be
easily forgotten with interference or attention to new stimuli. The in
formation retained, however, is passed to long-term memory, where it
can be stored indefinitely. This usually requires active rehearsal or re
peated exposure to a stimulus.
The human psyche has mysterious ways of meddling with our memo
ries. "Science" recently published an article about repression, the active
blocking of unwanted memories from our conscious awareness. The re
sults were clear: Subjects exhibited active forgetting processes, which in
cluded reduced hippocampus activity (a part of the brain involved in
memory storage) and impaired retention.
"The study ... shows that people who consciously taught themselves to for
get something, after a while, no matter how hard you tried, you just couldn't get
it back out of them," said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's medical correspondent.
Our memories may also be misleading. Due to the multi-tiered and ac
tive processing of memories, we may end up with false memories; distort
ed information that we believe has occurred.
Prof. Elizabeth Loftus at UC-Irvine, author of over 250 journal arti
cles and 18 books on the subject, sees false memories constituting a sig
nificant portion of our memories. As the champion persecutor for bogus
claims of childhood abuse and trauma, she cautions in an article entit led
"Remembering Dangerously" (Skeptical Inquirer) that false memories
are particularly pernicious because we live in a culture of accusation.
Caveat politicians.
Highlighting Loftus' findings is the notion that memory is fragile and
malleable.Through over 20,000 case studies, according to Psychology
Today, "she has demonstrated that "eyewitness testimony is often unreli
able, that false memories can be triggered in up to 25 percent of individu
als merely by suggestion, and that memory can be interfered with and al
tered by simply giving incorrect post-event information."
Aside from misconstrued memories, emotion also plays a significant
role in memory storage. Evidence shows that the brain preferentially
stores information with strong emotional attachment. Some scientists
argue that these emotionally arousing experiences release stress hor
mones that help imprint our memories better.
It's no surprise our feelings may get interwoven with our memories. If
I asked you to remember the first time you rode a bike, had a birthday
party or, like me, got the acceptance letter from Stanford, you can proba
bly recall every single detail. Even up to the "Congratulations" text on
that envelope.
There's a quote from the TV show the Wonder Years that states this
phenomenon poignantly: "Memory is a way of holding onto the things you
love, the things you are, the things you never want to lose." Amen to that.

Tania Rojas (trojas@stanford.edu) is a sophomore majoring in human
biology. She hopes you make (and retain) great memories this summer.

I have a riddle for you. What's fleeting, processed continuously in the
background and can also last a lifetime? If you're stumped, the answer
involves a web of connections, electrochemical cabling and gradual
morphs — and you're probably making one right now. Give up?
It's a memory.
According to the National Institute of Neurological disorders and
Stroke, a single memory involves thousands of changes in the brain; from
gene expression, neuron formation and nerve signaling, to yet undiscov
ered neural mechanisms. These learning-induced changes are referred to
as "memory traces."

Where does the journey from fleeting event to regis
tered experience occur? That's a question scientists at
Baylor College of Medicine in Houston attempted to
answer. They created transgenic fruit flies with special
genes that caused their neuronal connections to be
come fluorescent during nerve signaling in the brain.
Their research, which appears in the May 13,2004 issue
of Neuron magazine, involved exposing the flies to
brief puffs of odor while they received a shock. This
caused the flies to learn a new association between
odor and the shock.
Fascinatingly, the scientists were able to see memo-

ry formation occur before their eyes. They watched the fluorescent signals
in the flies' brains with a high-powered microscope and discovered that
certain neurons, called projection neurons, had more active connections
after the conditioning.
"It's phenomenally powerful, like a movie appearing in front of you,"
said Ronald L. Davis. The study suggests that the earliest representation
of a new memory occurs by rapid changes — "like flipping a switch" — in
the number of neuronal connections that respond to the odor, rather than
by formation of new connections.
Memories are typically categorized as sensory, short-term and long
term. Sensory memory exists for each type of sensory stimuli channel
(e.g. audition, visual, touch) and serves to filter specific stimuli to short
term memory. Short-term memory (also known as working memory)
lasts very briefly (about 200 ms.) and lacks sufficient long-term reten
tion. The information that makes it to our short-term memory may be
easily forgotten with interference or attention to new stimuli. The in
formation retained, however, is passed to long-term memory, where it
can be stored indefinitely. This usually requires active rehearsal or re
peated exposure to a stimulus.
The human psyche has mysterious ways of meddling with our memo
ries. "Science" recently published an article about repression, the active
blocking of unwanted memories from our conscious awareness. The re
sults were clear: Subjects exhibited active forgetting processes, which in
cluded reduced hippocampus activity (a part of the brain involved in
memory storage) and impaired retention.
"The study ... shows that people who consciously taught themselves to for
get something, after a while, no matter how hard you tried, you just couldn't get
it back out of them," said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's medical correspondent.
Our memories may also be misleading. Due to the multi-tiered and ac
tive processing of memories, we may end up with false memories; distort
ed information that we believe has occurred.
Prof. Elizabeth Loftus at UC-Irvine, author of over 250 journal arti
cles and 18 books on the subject, sees false memories constituting a sig
nificant portion of our memories. As the champion persecutor for bogus
claims of childhood abuse and trauma, she cautions in an article entit led
"Remembering Dangerously" (Skeptical Inquirer) that false memories
are particularly pernicious because we live in a culture of accusation.
Caveat politicians.
Highlighting Loftus' findings is the notion that memory is fragile and
malleable.Through over 20,000 case studies, according to Psychology
Today, "she has demonstrated that "eyewitness testimony is often unreli
able, that false memories can be triggered in up to 25 percent of individu
als merely by suggestion, and that memory can be interfered with and al
tered by simply giving incorrect post-event information."
Aside from misconstrued memories, emotion also plays a significant
role in memory storage. Evidence shows that the brain preferentially
stores information with strong emotional attachment. Some scientists
argue that these emotionally arousing experiences release stress hor
mones that help imprint our memories better.
It's no surprise our feelings may get interwoven with our memories. If

party or, like me, got the acceptance letter from Stanford, you can proba
bly recall every single detail. Even up to the "Congratulations" text on
