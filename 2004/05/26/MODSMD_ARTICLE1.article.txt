# Staff salary-freeze to end; University finances improving

### ALIYYA HAQUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a year-long salary freeze, Stanford's staff members can now
look forward to base-salary increases for the next fiscal year. The new
staff-salary program will go into effect this September with the reintro
duction of funding for base-salary increases and the use of variable-pay
programs, giving employees bonus incentives for exceptional work.
The one-year salary freeze went into effect at the beginning of the cur
rent school year in an effort to balance the University's budget while
minimizing the need for layoffs.
According to a statement released by the Office of the Provost, "by
forgoing faculty- and staff-salary increase, the University would be able
to save between $7 and $8 million in general funds, thereby reducing the
deficit considerably."
When the salary freeze was first implemented, many questioned the
level of competitiveness that Stanford would retain compared to similar
companies and institutions, especially in Silicon Valley. However, a sur
vey conducted earlier this year of people working in staff positions for
other employers found that despite the freeze, Stanford's salaries re
mained very competitive.
Members of Stanford's administration described the salary freeze as a
successful measure in controlling expenses and avoiding additional staff
layoffs. They cautioned, however, that although the financial situation
has improved, it is still too early to classify the budget as out of the woods.
According to Provost John Etchemendy, "The budget situation has
improved because Stanford is heavily dependent on investment perfor
mance fora portion of our general funds."
Randy Livingstone, vice president for business affairs and chief fi
nancial officer, still commended the salary freeze program in accom
plishing some of its goals.
"Thanks to strong investment returns, generous support from our
donors and internal efforts to limit expense growth, the financial outlook
is much better than it was a year ago," Livingston said.
However, many of the savings stemming from the salary freeze were
offset by the skyrocketing costs of employee healthcare. During the past
two years, the "benefits rate" — the cost of Stanford-provided benefits
divided by the employee base salary — has sharply increased due to ris
ing healthcare costs, roughly equivalent to a 6 percent increase in em
ployee compensation.
"The cost of healthcare has a huge impact on the amount of funds
available for employee compensation," Etchemendy said. "In the cur
rent budget year, the total amount of money we budgeted for salary and
benefits rose as much as it did in the prior year when we did not have a
salary freeze."
Although the healthcare costs hinder the ability to provide base
salary increases, measures are being taken to find a solution to balance
both expenses.
"We are considering significant changes to employee and retiree
health benefits in an effort to control the growth in costs, and to enable
us to continue providing competitive base salaries," Livingston said.
According to Executive Director of Human Resources Diane Peck,
the administration remains excited about the new staff salary program,
which Peck described to The Stanford Report as a "cornerstone of Stan
ford's performance management process."
Peck emphasized the importance of having a strong, competitive
salary program, career development opportunities and benefits,
and incentives based on performance in keeping the University's
employees satisfied.
"Many factors contribute to making the Stanford work experience
second to none — exciting employment opportunities, an excellent work
environment, a culture of commitment and caring, a sense of community
and the opportunity to be associated with an organization that is con
tributing so much to improving the world," she said.
