## Ballet Folklorico de Stanford holds annual show on Friday 
### ERIK HOPE 
For freshman Veronica Ramirez,
the presence of Ballet Folklorico de
Stanford, or BFdeS, on campus was an
important factor in her decision to at
tend the University. She saw Ballet
Folklorico perform at an El Centro
Chicano Admit Weekend event and
realized that she wanted to build on her
previous Folklorico dance experience.
Dancing with BFdeS has been a college
highlight for Ramirez and others.
"1 think what 1 love most about
being in Ballet Folklorico de Stanford
is that everyone who dances is in the
group because they want to be there,"
Ramirez said. "From what I've seen in
my own dance experience, there are
only a few who can say that they started
dancing because it was an inner drive"
Stanford's Ballet Folklorico de Stan
ford dance group is holding its annual
spring show, Concierto de la Primavera,
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium this Friday.
Originally started in 1972 as a Mex
ican folk dance exhibition class, BFdeS
is now an active, student-run dance
group devoted to sharing Mexican
Folkorico dance with Stanford and the
local community.
The group has been extremely active
on campus since its first performance on
the altar of Memorial Church, and per
formed for Mexican president Salinas de
Gortari during Stanford's centennial cel
ebration. It currently performs actively
throughout the year and holds five major
on-campus performances each year, cul
minating in the annual spring show.
Ballet Folklorico performs a diverse
collection of dances from the different
regions of Mexico. Every region has its
own distinctive dances and unique cos
tumes that are influenced by the re
gion's geography and history. The
group practices about ten dances from
each of ten regions, according to
Ramirez. Members with previous expe
rience in Folklorico share dances with
the group, which allows the group's

repertoire of traditional dances to con
tinue growing.
Since the 1992-1993 school year. Bal
let Folklorico has been an entirely stu
dent-run organization. It is currently
under the direction of sophomore co
chairs Krysti Garcia and Simon Escobe
do. who consider Ballet Folkorico an
important part of their lives.

"BFdeS has been a major part of my
life here at Stanford; as a freshman 1
came in certain that I would join the
folklorico group, and it was one of the
most genuinely welcoming and support
ive experiences I had during my first few
weeks at Stanford," Garcia said.
For the dancers, being part of BFdeS
represents an opportunity to learn
about a culture in addition to the pure
enjoyment of dancing. Folklorico
dance is an exceptionally vibrant and
special example of Mexican culture, ac
cording to Ramirez.
"There's only so much that you can
learn from reading a book," Ramirez
said. "Learning about my culture
through dance is something so beauti
ful, so personal and so unique."
Garcia agreed that Ballet Folklorico
is about more than just the dancing.
"For me. Ballet Folklorico is a per
fect combination of two things I am
passionate about: dancing and culture,"
Garcia said. "It has been a way for me
to rediscover my Mexican heritage as
well as just enjoy dancing."
Ballet Folklorico de Stanford hopes
to continue spreading the word about
Folklorico dance and attracting more
dancers to learn about Mexican culture.
The group collaborates with Mariachi
Cardenal at a number of events, and per
formed with them at their 10th anniver
sary on Saturday. Mariachi Cardenal will
also play at the spring show on Friday.
In addition to its collaboration with
the Mariachi group. Ballet Folklorico

performed at El Centro Chicano's 25th
anniversary and was extremely active
during the week of Cinco de Mayo, per
forming five times. '
While the group is currently well
funded, the future of Ballet Folklorico
at Stanford is not entirely certain. A sig
nificant portion of Ballet Folklorico's
funding this year comes from MEChA
special fees, which will not be available
next year.
Ballet Folklorico uses MEChA spe
cial fees to secure venues for its events,
and, as a result, the location of next
year's spring show is currently uncertain,
according to Ramirez. The group is cur
rently looking into other funding options
so that it can continue to perform its an
nual spring show at Dinkelspiel.
Even with its current funding issues.
Ballet Folklorico is certain to remain an
important part of its current and future
dancers' lives. According to its mem
bers, BFdeS is one of the most impor
tant parts of their Stanford experience.
"I can't imagine life at Stanford
without Ballet Folklorico de Stanford."
said former co-chair Tania Davila, a se
nior. "I'm very thankful to have had the
opportunity to meet such wonderful
people while celebrating my heritage.
It showed me what dedicated individu
als are capable of."
The Bifllet will continue to practice for
the rest of the school year, and rehearsal
and performance schedules are available
on the group's Web site, http://www.stan
