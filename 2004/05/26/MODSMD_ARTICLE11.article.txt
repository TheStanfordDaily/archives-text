# Eat, drink and be merry
## 'Edamame for all, and for all a good night' 
### 
The first time I saw it, it was magical— the won
derful, beautiful restaurant that was packed
and had crazy lights flashing off and on
throughout the dining area, loud music playing
and people inside looking happy and standing on tables.
I rushed to get a look at its pearly white exterior, to catch

a glimpse of its name embossed in sil
ver letters on the outside: "Miyake."
0000, we thought.
The first time I went there, I was
intrigued. The restaurant just has an
allure to it, so you think you have to
like it. But if you're not in the mood
fora sake bombing adventure or for
actually hearing your friends speak
(because the techno music is boom
ing in the background), then I
wouldn't recommend spending your

money there. The sushi is not what they are famous
for; let's put it that way. And as a sushi lover. I was on
the hunt for the perfect sushi restaurant.
So there's Miyake on one end and Fuki Sushi on the
other. Fuki Sushi has great traditional rolls, a nice
classy atmosphere, but the food is a little overpriced,
and I was a little underwhelmed with the whole experi
ence. I would definitely go there again, but it's not an
everyday outing.
Another higher-end sushi restaurant is Higashi

West. It's a great atmosphere — funky with bamboo
poles stationed throughout the room and generally hip
Japanese accoutrements placed in unsuspecting spots.
And while you're paying for your sushi, trust me, you are
paying for innovation. The white and green of the rice
and nori (seaweed) curls around the bright orange of
mango and the deep pink of smoked salmon.
If you love mango and salmon, Higashi is your spot
(they even use salmon mousse in one role). They also
have interesting rolls with rock shrimp and large crab.
But don't expect your traditional Yellowtail nigiri at
this joint.
The one drawback. I have to say, is that the naiso
soup bowl is extremely large, which in my mind defeats
its purpose. When you are just eating pretty-large size
blocks of tofu and a never-ending stream of seaweed
slivers, the broth just starts to get cold, and 1 start to get
full. Same with the salad — really big plate. So a word of
caution — beware the starter sizes, because they will
fool you.
So with the spectrum of sushi in Palo Alto, where is
the middle ground? I just wanted a good, mid-range,
family-style, busy, cozy sushi restaurant that I could go
to on a Thursday night in my jeans and a sweatshirt and
not break the bank. Why was that missing here?
And then 1 found Naomi (sushi, of course). This
was exactly what I was looking for — as the three of
us sat down on a Saturday night (minimal-to-no

wait), families were surrounding us on all sides (ex
cept for the Stanford lovebirds in the corner holding
hands and staring into each others eyes in the corner
and another group of Cardinal girls that walked in
wearing corsages and prom-style dresses but no
dates. Hmm.)
Colored bottles of sake in various shapes and sizes
lined each wall in several rows, three giant marlins hung
on the wood walls and one of those cliche Japanese blue
cloth curtains hung over the door and by the sushi bar.
Little kids were laughing (sometimes a bit too loudly)
around us, but I can tell you it's way better than pound
ing techno music. It felt homey, it felt like a normal
restaurant that normal people went to when they want
ed sushi. And our meal was good.
We, of course, ordered edamame to start, which was
absolutely delicious. The warm beans were served to us
in pretty servingware — the portion looked small at first,
but even with three people to serve, it definitely lasted
throughout the meal. The miso soup was delicious (and
normal-sized), yet the salad left a bit to be desired. I am
usually obsessed with the Japanese house-salad dressing,
but this one was just so-so. So if you're not dying for it.
you can skip the salad.
The rolls were great, too (not the best of the best, but
pretty darn good). We ordered the sushi tempura roll,
the California roll (the avocado makes up a significant
portion of the fillings — which I love, but if you aren t

an avocado fan. beware), and the tuna roll for the base
taste. And the prices were pretty cheap — six cut rolls
for around $4.00. Three of us ate there for $16 a piece,
and we ate well. They also had full-on meals, with chick
en teriyaki and various other meats on the menu. They
even had mochi.
So lesson learned: The middle road does exist in
Palo Alto, despite the plethora of fast-loody and high
end establishments lining University. 1 know there are
places to get it takeout that are just fine, but if you
want to actually sit down, enjoy the company of your
friends and smell like soy sauce afterwards, try Naomi.
And I bet your neighbors will love you for it. too.
Mmm, soy sauce.
Naomi Sushi is located at 1328 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park.
Higashi West is located at 632 Emerson St., Palo
Alto.
Fuki Sushi is located at 4119 El Camino Real.

closet full of them, and they are getting sad. The luau
themed formal didn 't quite do them justice.

for around $4.00. Three of us ate there for $16 a piece,
and we ate well. They also had full-on meals, with chick
en teriyaki and various other meats on the menu. They
even had mochi.
So lesson learned: The middle road does exist in
Palo Alto, despite the plethora of fast-loody and high
end establishments lining University. 1 know there are
places to get it takeout that are just fine, but if you
want to actually sit down, enjoy the company of your
friends and smell like soy sauce afterwards, try Naomi.
And I bet your neighbors will love you for it. too.
Mmm, soy sauce.

The first time I saw it, it was magical— the won
derful, beautiful restaurant that was packed
and had crazy lights flashing off and on
throughout the dining area, loud music playing
and people inside looking happy and standing on tables.
I rushed to get a look at its pearly white exterior, to catch

a glimpse of its name embossed in sil
ver letters on the outside: "Miyake."
0000, we thought.
The first time I went there, I was
intrigued. The restaurant just has an
allure to it, so you think you have to
like it. But if you're not in the mood
fora sake bombing adventure or for
actually hearing your friends speak
(because the techno music is boom
ing in the background), then I
wouldn't recommend spending your

money there. The sushi is not what they are famous
for; let's put it that way. And as a sushi lover. I was on
the hunt for the perfect sushi restaurant.
So there's Miyake on one end and Fuki Sushi on the
other. Fuki Sushi has great traditional rolls, a nice
classy atmosphere, but the food is a little overpriced,
and I was a little underwhelmed with the whole experi
ence. I would definitely go there again, but it's not an
everyday outing.
Another higher-end sushi restaurant is Higashi

West. It's a great atmosphere — funky with bamboo
poles stationed throughout the room and generally hip
Japanese accoutrements placed in unsuspecting spots.
And while you're paying for your sushi, trust me, you are
paying for innovation. The white and green of the rice
and nori (seaweed) curls around the bright orange of
mango and the deep pink of smoked salmon.
If you love mango and salmon, Higashi is your spot
(they even use salmon mousse in one role). They also
have interesting rolls with rock shrimp and large crab.
But don't expect your traditional Yellowtail nigiri at
this joint.
The one drawback. I have to say, is that the naiso
soup bowl is extremely large, which in my mind defeats
its purpose. When you are just eating pretty-large size
blocks of tofu and a never-ending stream of seaweed
slivers, the broth just starts to get cold, and 1 start to get
full. Same with the salad — really big plate. So a word of
caution — beware the starter sizes, because they will
fool you.
So with the spectrum of sushi in Palo Alto, where is
the middle ground? I just wanted a good, mid-range,
family-style, busy, cozy sushi restaurant that I could go
to on a Thursday night in my jeans and a sweatshirt and
not break the bank. Why was that missing here?
And then 1 found Naomi (sushi, of course). This
was exactly what I was looking for — as the three of
us sat down on a Saturday night (minimal-to-no

wait), families were surrounding us on all sides (ex
cept for the Stanford lovebirds in the corner holding
hands and staring into each others eyes in the corner
and another group of Cardinal girls that walked in
wearing corsages and prom-style dresses but no
dates. Hmm.)
Colored bottles of sake in various shapes and sizes
lined each wall in several rows, three giant marlins hung
on the wood walls and one of those cliche Japanese blue
cloth curtains hung over the door and by the sushi bar.
Little kids were laughing (sometimes a bit too loudly)
around us, but I can tell you it's way better than pound
ing techno music. It felt homey, it felt like a normal
restaurant that normal people went to when they want
ed sushi. And our meal was good.
We, of course, ordered edamame to start, which was
absolutely delicious. The warm beans were served to us
in pretty servingware — the portion looked small at first,
but even with three people to serve, it definitely lasted
throughout the meal. The miso soup was delicious (and
normal-sized), yet the salad left a bit to be desired. I am
usually obsessed with the Japanese house-salad dressing,
but this one was just so-so. So if you're not dying for it.
you can skip the salad.
The rolls were great, too (not the best of the best, but
pretty darn good). We ordered the sushi tempura roll,
the California roll (the avocado makes up a significant
portion of the fillings — which I love, but if you aren t

an avocado fan. beware), and the tuna roll for the base
taste. And the prices were pretty cheap — six cut rolls
for around $4.00. Three of us ate there for $16 a piece,
