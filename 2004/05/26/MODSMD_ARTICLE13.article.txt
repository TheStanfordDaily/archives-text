# CPC should be reconsidered
## 
### 
With an end to the convoluted and confusing
ASSU executive election process finally
in sight, it's time to reconsider the Cam
paign Practice Code (CPC), the docu
ment that spells out the ASSU's election rules. In the
past six weeks, we have seen an election voided hy the
Undergraduate Senate because candidates broke the
rules: a Senate decision voided because it was against the
ASSI) Constitution; a muted special election in which al
most every form of campaigning was banned; and a pro
cess that left a bad taste in everyone's mouth and gave
the ASSU a huge credibility gap to make up. It's obvious
the CPC needs to change.
Let's start with some generally accepted principles.
First, the goal of the code is to deliver the fairest result
possible. It should not ban some types of campaigning
yet allow unlimited spending, since this gives better
funded slates a disproportionate advantage. Second,
the code should reduce the incentives to cheat. We
won't have clean campaigns until each ticket feels con
fident that the other tickets are not going to violate the
code or exploit ambiguities in it. Third, the code should
promote freedom of speech. A more informed student
body will make elections less of a popularity or spend
ing contest.
The first thing to look at are the restrictions on the
dates of campaigning. The CPC states that campaigning
must end before voting begins. Yet almost all students get
e-mails after the campaign deadline reminding them to
vote. It is unclear to what extent such e-mails constitute
"campaigning." Depending upon what lists they are sent
to. these "get out the vote" messages surely can have an
effect on the election. This is the type of ambiguity in the
rules that should be eliminated.
There is no clear reason to ban campaigning once vot
ing starts. Allowing election-day campaigning will in
crease turnout and increase student information and will
not violate the ASSU Constitution's protections of free
speech. Additionally, as long as election-day campaign-

ing is banned, there will be strong incentives to cheat, so
supporters will probably campaign on election day any
way. The CPC should let everyone do it rather than pe
nalizing more scrupulous candidates.
The CPC flyering and e-mail restrictions should also
go. The University has policies about distribution of
printed materials, electronic privacy and unsolicited
email, and many student groups have policies about what
their e-mail lists may be used for.Candidates may be fined
or held responsible for poster cleanup costs, their use of
electronic resources may be suspended or other sanctions
may be pursued as appropriate by the University. But the
Elections Commission should not make up additional fly
ering or e-mail restrictions, particularly since it lacks the
authority to enforce them. It would be much more effec
tive as a watchdog activating the appropriate University
enforcement process.
Furthermore, as a general rule we believe that more e
mails will better inform the student body and will reduce
the incentives to cheat. The first election was thrown into
turmoil by a few e-mails precisely because no others were
allowed. Campaigns would still have a strong incentive
not to annoy the student body because of the threat ofstu
dents voting for joke slates in protest. Floods of email
would thus be self-regulating.
Less is more when it comes to the Campaign Practice
Code. An overly restrictive code benefits some slates ar
bitrarily, encourages electioneers to try to push gray areas
as much as possible and actually reduces the ability of the
student body to make the best and most informed choice
possible. Given that the CPCcurrently has no binding re
strictions on campaign spending, the code's other restric
tions tend to amplify the effects of money.
A better code would rely much more on University
policies, and the Elections Commission could serve more
as a watchdog activating the existing University process
es. Restrictions on flyering, e-mails and campaigning
dates — the hulk of the code — should be the first to go.
Above all, a better code would be a shorter one.
