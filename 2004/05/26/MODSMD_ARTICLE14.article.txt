## 25 years later: Pol Pot remembered 
### NICOLE KANG FRED NGO 
The political and societal unrest
that currently overwhelm the country
of Cambodia can be attributed to the
breakdown of its social and moral sys
tems. This breakdown is a direct con
sequence of the Pol Pot Regime, a
Holocaust-like event that claimed the
lives of two million Cambodians in the
late 19705.
During this regime, which lasted
from 1975-1979, the Cambodian peo
ple were subjected to forced labor,
starvation and cultural and political in
doctrination. all methods by which Pol
Pot and his communistic faction, the
Khmer Rouge, sought to achieve their
dream of a self-sufficient, egalitarian
nation. Although the regime fell over
25 years ago, the country's struggle to
maintain stability on all fronts is reflec
tive of the destruction that the coun
try's political, social and economic in
frastructures suffered at the hands of
the communists.
The country's instability has al
lowed for crime to infiltrate and fur
ther destroy societal and cultural
norms. A prime example of such crime
is the prostitution and trafficking of
young Cambodian women, including
young girls, as a means to support the
thriving tourism industry. Currently,
there are an estimated 15.000 sex
workers in the country, many of whom

are children between the ages of eight
and 17. Forty percent of these workers
are infected with HIV.
Governmental complacency in re
gard to AIDS prevention has been a
major factor in prolonging the practice
of prostitution and trafficking, and con
sequently, the spread of HIV /AIDS.
Although government officials have
supported public health programs to
encourage safe sex and legislation to
deem prostitution illegal, it has been
discovered that many politicians and
their social networks are closely associ
ated with the business. The profitability
is enticing, and has led government of
ficials to protect criminals at the judicial
level in exchange for their involvement
in the business.
Economic woes are another factor
in the progression of AIDS in Cambo
dia. To alleviate such financial difficul
ties, the country has turned to the
tourism industry, which revolves
around the prostitution and trafficking
of young men and women.
According to ECPAT Cambodia,
an independent organization that fo
cuses on stopping sexual exploita
tion of children, travelers from Asia
and the United States, as well as
local Cambodian men. have con
tributed to the growth of this indus
try. and consequently, to the rise in
HIV transmission.
Because of this, Cambodia has one

of the highest infection rates in Asia,
and according to the United Nations
Development Programme, it is esti
mated that nearly 115,(KK) people, in
cluding children, could develop AIDS
by 2(X)5.
To extend the efforts of other stu
dent groups that have been dedicated
to addressing issues of human rights,
such as the Korean American Students
Association and ATAI, the Stanford
Cambodian Cultural Association
would like to commemorate the fall of
the Pol Pot Regime and to bring about
awareness of the HIV / AIDS epidem
ic in Cambodia in the Stanford com
munity through "25 Years Later: Cam
bodia Remembered.''
This event, which will take place on
May 26 at 7p.m. in 2(X)-202. will feature
Dr. Soleak Sim (Class of 1994), who
will discuss her experiences as a physi
cian working on an AIDS project in
Cambodia.
As students who are committed to
tackling issues of global injustice,
SCCA invites the Stanford communi
ty to join us in our pursuit of knowl
edge and developing solutions.
