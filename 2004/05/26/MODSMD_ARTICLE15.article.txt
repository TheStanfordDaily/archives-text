# STILL MAC, STILL DANGEROUS
## Sex bracelets and cross-eyed pilots 
### 
Two columns left. So much
to say, so little time to say it.
I've got to start ramblin' so
I can touch on as many vital
issues as possible. I'll try to be as spe
cific as Dubya was in his five-point
plan for Iraq on Monday, but I can't
promise anything.
There has been a lot of news re
cently about these "sex bracelets"
that high school kids are wearing
with different colors that represent
different sexual acts they have per
formed. i.e. red for heavy petting and
blue for oral sex.
Can we make sure that incoming
freshman arrive at Stanford with
these bracelets on, just so we know
where they stand on certain matters?
Maybe freshmen should be wear
ing them around those Stanford key
chains you get during Orientation.
Then everyone will know right away
who to invite to Screw Your Room
mate dances in the fall.
There is no place I would rather
be than in President Bush's dressing
room an hour before a major speech
on the Middle East so I could watch
him fumble his way through Arabic
names like Abu Ghraib, Lakhdar
Brahimi and Ezzedine Salem. It
would be like watching a blind man
trying to navigate the infamous
Labyrinth of Greek mythology.
Do you ever think about what
your name would be if you were a
Native American chief? I know I do.
I'd like to think I'd be called some
thing tight like Rumbling Thunder or
Galloping Vigor, but it would proba
bly be something more along the
lines of Procrastinating Mosquito.
For years, I've had a theory that
Madonna's "Like a Prayer" was the
ultimate panty-dropping song. I
never conducted a scientific study on
the matter, but I'm convinced that if
you can't hook up with a girl while
dancing to this '80s hit, you'll never
be able to hook up with her.
I still believe this, but now there is

a new song out there giving "Like a
Prayer" a run for its money: "Toxic"
by Britney Spears.
I don't want to jump the gun, but

"Toxic" could be
the panty-dropper
of the new millen
nium. Next time
the song comes on
at a frat party,
watch all hell
break loose as
throngs of girls
stampede towards
the dance floor
Pamplona-style.

"Exotic Erotic" has to be the
most overhyped failure since New
Coke. Although I did thoroughly
enjoy staring at girls wearing g
strings with asses that looked like
cottage cheese, the party sucks every
year and people should start recog
nizing it. Also, I shot some video
footage at the party and I think I'm
going to call it "Not-Good-Looking
People Gone Not-So Wild."
I was watching the MTV "Diary"
of some new pop star on MTV, who
was rehearsing fora performance at
an upcoming awards show. Then I
realized that I was watching a show
about someone preparing fora
show about other shows about
music — when all 1 wanted to do
was see some music videos. 1 think I
know, and I have an idea: play some
damn videos.
Five years ago, if someone told me
that the Terminator would be gover
nor of California, Mad Max would be
one of the country's religious leaders
and Martha Stewart would be on her
way to jail, 1 would have jumped off
the Brooklyn Bridge.
I mean, come on — I was sure the
Domestic Diva was going to be gov
ernor, not Schwarzenegger. But as
we all know, Arnold is this crazy
state's new chief and Martha is about
to hear "Night night, keep your butt
hole tight" somewhere upstate.

I was recently on a cross-country
flight, and I came away with a num
ber of questions. Why is it that I al
ways have to sit next to the fattest
person on the plane, so that I have
some random person's flabby,
sweaty arms on top of me for five
hours? Is it because I am really skin
ny and they want some equilibrium
in the rows?
Is there anything scarier than
walking onto a plane and seeing that
your pilot is cross-eyed? (This really
happened to me last month.) And
when did "deplane" become a word?
I fly a fair amount, and I swear that
I never heard the word "deplane" be
fore last year. If that's in the dictio
nary, it's only a matter of time before
"detoilet" becomes a legitimate way
to describe getting off the can.
I wish Coach Montgomery all of
the best with the Golden State War
riors. I really do. But I can't wait for
his team to finish the regular season
with the best record in the league only
to choke in the early rounds of the
playoffs. (Wait for it. Wait for it. OK.)
In a perfect world. "The Daily
Show with Jon Stewart" would be the
highest-rated show on television and
Rush Linibaugh would be working
the drive-thru at Jack in the Box on
El Camino. Steroids would be
banned from baseball and marijuana
would be legal everywhere.
Former Enron executives would
have to do hard time at Abu Ghraib
and the American people would care
as much about the upcoming presi
dential election as they do about
"American Idol."
And I would be living in the Co
hens' pool house on "The OC" with
Summer and Marissa as my room
mates — while "Toxic" blasts on re
peat 24/7.

about someone preparing fora
show about other shows about
music — when all 1 wanted to do
was see some music videos. 1 think I
know, and I have an idea: play some
damn videos.
Five years ago, if someone told me
that the Terminator would be gover
nor of California, Mad Max would be
one of the country's religious leaders
and Martha Stewart would be on her
way to jail, 1 would have jumped off
the Brooklyn Bridge.
I mean, come on — I was sure the
Domestic Diva was going to be gov
ernor, not Schwarzenegger. But as
we all know, Arnold is this crazy
state's new chief and Martha is about
to hear "Night night, keep your butt
hole tight" somewhere upstate.

I was recently on a cross-country
flight, and I came away with a num
ber of questions. Why is it that I al
ways have to sit next to the fattest
person on the plane, so that I have
some random person's flabby,
sweaty arms on top of me for five
hours? Is it because I am really skin
ny and they want some equilibrium
in the rows?
Is there anything scarier than
walking onto a plane and seeing that
your pilot is cross-eyed? (This really
happened to me last month.) And
when did "deplane" become a word?
I fly a fair amount, and I swear that
I never heard the word "deplane" be
fore last year. If that's in the dictio
nary, it's only a matter of time before
"detoilet" becomes a legitimate way
to describe getting off the can.
I wish Coach Montgomery all of
the best with the Golden State War
riors. I really do. But I can't wait for
his team to finish the regular season
with the best record in the league only
to choke in the early rounds of the
playoffs. (Wait for it. Wait for it. OK.)
In a perfect world. "The Daily
Show with Jon Stewart" would be the
highest-rated show on television and
Rush Linibaugh would be working
the drive-thru at Jack in the Box on
El Camino. Steroids would be
banned from baseball and marijuana
would be legal everywhere.
Former Enron executives would
have to do hard time at Abu Ghraib
and the American people would care
as much about the upcoming presi
dential election as they do about
"American Idol."
And I would be living in the Co
hens' pool house on "The OC" with
Summer and Marissa as my room
mates — while "Toxic" blasts on re
peat 24/7.

Two columns left. So much
to say, so little time to say it.
I've got to start ramblin' so
I can touch on as many vital
issues as possible. I'll try to be as spe
cific as Dubya was in his five-point
plan for Iraq on Monday, but I can't
promise anything.
There has been a lot of news re
cently about these "sex bracelets"
that high school kids are wearing
with different colors that represent
different sexual acts they have per
formed. i.e. red for heavy petting and
blue for oral sex.
Can we make sure that incoming
freshman arrive at Stanford with
these bracelets on, just so we know
where they stand on certain matters?
Maybe freshmen should be wear
ing them around those Stanford key
chains you get during Orientation.
Then everyone will know right away
who to invite to Screw Your Room
mate dances in the fall.
There is no place I would rather
be than in President Bush's dressing
room an hour before a major speech
on the Middle East so I could watch
him fumble his way through Arabic
names like Abu Ghraib, Lakhdar
Brahimi and Ezzedine Salem. It
would be like watching a blind man
trying to navigate the infamous
Labyrinth of Greek mythology.
Do you ever think about what
your name would be if you were a
Native American chief? I know I do.
I'd like to think I'd be called some
thing tight like Rumbling Thunder or
Galloping Vigor, but it would proba
bly be something more along the
lines of Procrastinating Mosquito.
For years, I've had a theory that
Madonna's "Like a Prayer" was the
ultimate panty-dropping song. I
never conducted a scientific study on
the matter, but I'm convinced that if
you can't hook up with a girl while
dancing to this '80s hit, you'll never
be able to hook up with her.
I still believe this, but now there is

a new song out there giving "Like a
Prayer" a run for its money: "Toxic"
by Britney Spears.
I don't want to jump the gun, but

"Toxic" could be
the panty-dropper
of the new millen
nium. Next time
the song comes on
at a frat party,
watch all hell
break loose as
throngs of girls
stampede towards
the dance floor
Pamplona-style.

"Exotic Erotic" has to be the
most overhyped failure since New
Coke. Although I did thoroughly
enjoy staring at girls wearing g
strings with asses that looked like
cottage cheese, the party sucks every
year and people should start recog
nizing it. Also, I shot some video
footage at the party and I think I'm
going to call it "Not-Good-Looking
People Gone Not-So Wild."
I was watching the MTV "Diary"
of some new pop star on MTV, who
was rehearsing fora performance at
an upcoming awards show. Then I
realized that I was watching a show
about someone preparing fora
