## ASSU mess holds real-world lessons 
### 
Let's begin with a caveat,
shall we? I'm a graduate
student in a one-year pro
gram. I'm not a helmet
wearing, bike-riding commuter stu
dent, but I'll confess to some apathy
when it comes to campus politics.
Actually, I'll confess to more than
that: I don't know the candidates and
I really don't care who wins the
ASSU executive elections.
But I've observed the recent
ASSU ridiculousness, and amid the
dry rot of the campus political pro
cess there are some encouraging
signs in this popularity contest ripe
with scandal, abuse and mudslinging.
First, young people, despite the
polls and literature to the contrary,
are in fact dialed into current events.
Stanford students — or the Senate at
least — seem to have paid rapt atten
tion to both the 2(XX) presidential
elections and the California Guber
natorial recall election of last fall.
The lesson learned: The voice of the
people can be silenced by a body of
elite lawmakers or through cam
paigns steeped in moral jargon
waged by the losers.
You may not like Mikey Lee and
Dylan Mefford. And from my view
point, yes, they are annoyingly
overeager about student politics
that, let's be honest, don't change
much of life on campus. Running on
a platform of dropping prices at the
Bookstore? Better food in the cafe
teria? Let's get real, they can't fix
that stuff and neither could any of
the other slates.
But somehow Lee and Mefford
scored 300 votes more than the clos
est competitors, so they win. They
even got a nod of approval from The
Stanford Daily editorial board, for
crying out loud, and we all know how
relentlessly objective the media is.
Somehow, either through bribes,
computer hacking or simple old-fash
ioned competence, this slate got the
popular vote. Doesn't the popular
vote mean anything anymore?

Yes, there was a little bit of shady
business with e-mail endorsements
from the Senior and Junior Class
presidencies. But isn't it a given that

the Senior Class
presidency
would endorse
Lee since he held
the post of senior
class president?
Did that e-mail
really affect any
one's vote?
The Junior
Class endorse
ment is a little

dicey, though, and it appears to have
been a sham. That was a calculated
risk taken by Lee and Mefford that
brings us to our second society-af
firming lesson: Campaign lies don't
pay. You always get busted.
A1 Gore probably feels just as
stupid now about claiming to have in
vented the Internet as Lee feels
about the Junior Class presidency en
dorsement. Lying has blowback, il
lustrated by something both Gore
and Lee share: a loss after the "ballots
were recounted," which is how I'll
refer to the special ASSU election
that should never have happened.
See, I don't think Lee and Mef
ford really were oblivious to what
they were doing. 1 know there is some
dispute about what Lee knew and
when he expected things to happen,
but I don't buy it.
At some level, Lee knew sending
the e-mail endorsements after the
polls had opened (and official cam
paigning was supposed to cease) was
a little dodgy, but his actions weren't
explicitly ruled out either.
So it wasn't illegal by a lawyeristic
read of the rules and bylaws and
such, even if it spotlighted a kind of
repulsive lust for the position. And
the endorsements seem to really
have had no affect on the voting pop
ulace, at least according to the voting
officials people.
In the business world, you get re

warded for thinking outside of the
box, but in elections, alternative
thinking is scandalous, especially
when you pretend you weren't doing
what you were doing. If Lee and Mef
ford had more friends in the Senate,
maybe things would have worked out
differently for them.
And so now we've passed through
the positive signs right to the unfortu
nate truth of all elections: They are
just mandates on popularity. Isn't it
ironic that the most political part of
the ASSU executive elections was in
the wrangling afterwards to decertify,
and the ill-advised bait-and-switch of
running mates?
If there is a scandal, it's in the jet
tison of poor Ajani Husbands and
Mefford for the reinvented
Lee / Alyssa Schwartz ticket, even
after Schwartz's vocal condemnation
of Lee's electioneering tactics.
I wish the discarded duo had
formed an alternative ticket, but
that wasn't suggested by The Daily,
which apparently planted the seed
for the Lee / Schwartz political cou
pling in a pre-election editorial.
Doesn't anyone think for them
selves anymore?
So I know the student body
passed their judgment on any Lee
ticket this week, and the voice of the
people will be certified by a dimin
ished ASSU. Who can take this
group seriously now. after the be
hind-the-scenes sniping to change
election results?
Though this cantankerous voting
scandal was waged on the behalf of
morality and the voters, the conclu
sion is just the will of the few with
out regard for the many who voted
in April.
If I'd voted in April. I'd be filled
with righteous indignation. But since
I didn't, I'll just be amused.
