Justice isn't just about
economic theories
Nate Hilger's op-ed concerning
the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion's demand fora just living wage as
part of a Code of Conduct at Stanford
("Stanford should resist labor action
coalition's living wage campaign,"
May 20) addresses a few points worth
considering in the formation of a Liv
ing Wage Policy but ignores a crucial
perspective also worth taking into ac
count: namely, that there are human
faces behind these facts.
Telling students to take an eco
nomics course rather than take ac
tion concerning injustices that occur
daily is outrageous. Perhaps you may
not think that having to support a
family with poverty level wages is un
just, but I do.

I do because I know what it's like.
Every time I interact with a Stanford
worker 1 am reminded of my mother,
who could very well work here as
these are the types of jobs she has
taken in the past, being an immigrant
without a formal education or skills in
the job market.
And when you tell me to take an
economics course to better under
stand why people like my family must
live without healthcare and struggle
to provide basic food and shelter, you
are telling me to ignore the precarious
position I am in when I know my
mother has not fully recovered from
two surgeries in the past year yet still
works because she has no other
choice or opportunity for the better.
This is the reality for many people.
While my mother is not employed
or affiliated with Stanford other than

through me, I know that these experi
ences are similar to what workers and
their families face here. And my point
is that it's all too easy to dehumanize
the issue with data, economic theories
and the like. I'm not saying those
aren't valid, but they mean nothing
when you can't see that this is ulti
mately an issue concerning our collec
tive values and ideas about what jus
tice truly means.
For me, it is undeniably unjust that
millions of people live without health
care and face unnecessary difficulties
in their lives. Stanford's current labor
policies are typical of the rest of the
nation, but this does not mean that we
should be comfortable to not question
the status quo.
Wasn't it Jane Stanford who said,
"Let us not be afraid to outgrow old
thoughts and ways and dare to think

on new lines as to the future work
under our care"? It is a mark of Stan
ford's excellence to take this message
with seriousness and honesty. As stu
dents with the privilege of attending
an institution with incredible re
sources, our consciousness and ac
tions ought to match it.
If this process where a bunch of po
tentially bright and contributive peo
ple are going to spend four years of
their lives together, then their collec
tive efforts should not only make last
ing contributions to their communities
across the map, but also on the very
campus from which they will learn the
knowledge and skills necessary to
make their contributions a reality.
Most things that SL AC is asking for
are basic, but considered too much. Is
it really too much that an institution be
asked to review its labor policies? Is it

really too much that a world-class in
stitution of higher education provide a
truly democratic committee that at the
very least includes a low-wage worker,
the type of worker who will be affect
ed most by any decisions made by such
a committee?
Just because the rest of the world
finds this acceptable does not excuse
it. We are all autonomous beings with
the capability to act and speak. Even
though we may not be personally re
sponsible for injustice or exploita
tion, we still have a commitment to
be active and mindful of how our
wonderful institution lives up to
being a visionary leader at the fore
front of not just academics but even
the workplace.
