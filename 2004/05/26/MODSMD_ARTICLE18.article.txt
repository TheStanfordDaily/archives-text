## Being a Red Sox fan is a lot like dating... 
### 
My name is Dan McCarthy, and I am a
supporter of the Boston Red Sox. I
am also a cynic. Unsurprisingly,
these go hand in hand. Every state
ment of fact results in a question; every appar
ent victory brings only cold evaluation of how
conquest will choose to melt into defeat. Win
ning only allows a temporary suspension of the
unshakeable belief that, in the end, the Red Sox
will lose.
But being jaded can only take you so far. You
become blind to the occasional flashes of bril
liance that God tosses your way, so that 1986 is
remembered not for Dave Henderson's ALCS
saving home run that brought the Sox back from
the dead, but for Bill Buckner's critical error
that booted them squarely back to their offsea
son tomb of moping and "wait *til next year."
The joy of the experience is lost in the disap
pointment of the final result, where all that mat-

ters is the all-important zero: the
number of Sox championships
since 1918.
It's so easy to fall into the
trap, to concede defeat in April
and wonder how the Sox will dis
appoint you again this year.
Boston fans approach every new
season with all the enthusiasm of
a corpse. Soldiering on grimly,
while dignified, is the essence of

failure because success becomes an unattainable
vision.
I spent the greater part of the last couple of
years — perhaps, admittedly, not coincidentally
— observing the opposite sex in this manner,
playing the game with the same sort of tragicom
ic hope shared by most of Red Sox Nation.
The Sox and women are surprisingly similar,
building you up in the beginning for the in
evitable postseason train wreck. Spring brings its
initial surge of adrenaline, but by October the
flaws inevitably come out. Dating becomes an
endless parade of smart-yet-neurotic girls and
vapid sorostitutes whose idea of soul-searching
is asking their friends, "You don't think I'm slut
ty, do you?" You cease to look any deeper into
the situation, knowing that ultimately both the
Sox and females will leave you bored and watch
ing Sports Center at 2 a.m.
You say the Sox won the division this year? So
what, show me the ring. You're a Rhodes Schol
ar and a Swedish bikini model? I don't care;
prove yourself. Eventually, you become a ma
chine, requiring such excellence from someone
that everyone is just waiting to be cut down.
And then when she does come along, you
don't know what to do. You've spent so long
sniping and complaining from behind your walls
that you forgot what beauty really looked like,
forgot how it feels to sit back and let another
person's calm silence envelop you. She has the
kind of presence that makes you stumble over
stories you've told a thousand times, and when
you look up and catch her playing with her hair it
scares you because you'd forgotten something
else — what that weakness felt like.
The Sox and I have come a long way together.
I understand their pain, and they understand my
skepticism. They have emerged unbroken from
crushing defeat after crushing defeat enough to
know that the odds are stacked against them.
But the only way they can truly lose is to duti
fully drag themselves onward, anticipating de
feat with the same drudgery that drives their fans
to watch the playoffs every year. Every season
brings with it a new beginning, a fresh slate that
can be marred only by your own scorn.
The great Tug McGraw, in one of the iconic
quotes in sports history, understood that "Ya
gotta believe." And 10, his faith was rewarded —
with a World Series championship for the Mira
cle Mets, a team that God himself would not
have bet on going into the season. When that
special season, that golden opportunity, comes
around, you had sure as hell better not let it
drown in the sludge of your refusal to hope.
The Red Sox came into today holding first
place in the AL East, having vanquished the
hated Yankees six out of seven times. This can
easily be dismissed as meaningless early-season
success, but I'm going to choose to believe the
hype. The bullpen looks solid. Manny Ramirez is
in the zone and the starters have compiled the
best ERA in the majors. If I was ever going to be
lieve, now's the time.
You've spent enough time in the pressure
cooker that when she smiles at you with those
obsidian eyes, it barely registers at first. And
then, suddenly, you hear it at night, her voice in
your head like nobody's has been as long as you
can remember, your cool sheets suddenly hot
with the rush of blood to your skin at the echo
of her laugh. Chasing down seagulls in Half
Moon Bay at midnight, you remember what it
felt like to genuinely have fun with someone —
to believe.
So is this the Sox' year, when they shatter the
odds and buck the gorilla from their backs? Is
this it, the sledgehammer blow that finally shat
ters the shell of disbelief so carefully crafted
from defeats past? Like the Sox, will I rise to
the occasion?
I guess we'll find out.

Dan McCarthy is a sophomore to whom you,
for once, have no reason to send hate mail. Al
though, if you re still harboring a secret scorn, I
guess you could e-mail dmcc23(fPstan ford.edu
and rag on him for being a romantic underneath
it all.

for once, have no reason to send hate mail. Al
though, if you re still harboring a secret scorn, I
guess you could e-mail dmcc23(fPstan ford.edu

it all.


Dan McCarthy
My name is Dan McCarthy, and I am a
supporter of the Boston Red Sox. I
am also a cynic. Unsurprisingly,
these go hand in hand. Every state
ment of fact results in a question; every appar
ent victory brings only cold evaluation of how
conquest will choose to melt into defeat. Win
ning only allows a temporary suspension of the
unshakeable belief that, in the end, the Red Sox
will lose.
But being jaded can only take you so far. You
become blind to the occasional flashes of bril
liance that God tosses your way, so that 1986 is
remembered not for Dave Henderson's ALCS
saving home run that brought the Sox back from
the dead, but for Bill Buckner's critical error
that booted them squarely back to their offsea
son tomb of moping and "wait *til next year."
The joy of the experience is lost in the disap
pointment of the final result, where all that mat-

ters is the all-important zero: the
number of Sox championships
since 1918.
It's so easy to fall into the
trap, to concede defeat in April
and wonder how the Sox will dis
appoint you again this year.
Boston fans approach every new
season with all the enthusiasm of
a corpse. Soldiering on grimly,
while dignified, is the essence of

failure because success becomes an unattainable
vision.
I spent the greater part of the last couple of
years — perhaps, admittedly, not coincidentally
— observing the opposite sex in this manner,
playing the game with the same sort of tragicom
ic hope shared by most of Red Sox Nation.
The Sox and women are surprisingly similar,
building you up in the beginning for the in
evitable postseason train wreck. Spring brings its
initial surge of adrenaline, but by October the
flaws inevitably come out. Dating becomes an
endless parade of smart-yet-neurotic girls and
vapid sorostitutes whose idea of soul-searching
is asking their friends, "You don't think I'm slut
ty, do you?" You cease to look any deeper into
the situation, knowing that ultimately both the
Sox and females will leave you bored and watch
ing Sports Center at 2 a.m.
You say the Sox won the division this year? So
what, show me the ring. You're a Rhodes Schol
ar and a Swedish bikini model? I don't care;
prove yourself. Eventually, you become a ma
chine, requiring such excellence from someone
that everyone is just waiting to be cut down.
And then when she does come along, you
don't know what to do. You've spent so long
sniping and complaining from behind your walls
that you forgot what beauty really looked like,
forgot how it feels to sit back and let another
person's calm silence envelop you. She has the
kind of presence that makes you stumble over
stories you've told a thousand times, and when
you look up and catch her playing with her hair it
scares you because you'd forgotten something
else — what that weakness felt like.
The Sox and I have come a long way together.
I understand their pain, and they understand my
skepticism. They have emerged unbroken from
crushing defeat after crushing defeat enough to
know that the odds are stacked against them.
But the only way they can truly lose is to duti
fully drag themselves onward, anticipating de
feat with the same drudgery that drives their fans
to watch the playoffs every year. Every season
brings with it a new beginning, a fresh slate that
can be marred only by your own scorn.
The great Tug McGraw, in one of the iconic
quotes in sports history, understood that "Ya
gotta believe." And 10, his faith was rewarded —
with a World Series championship for the Mira
cle Mets, a team that God himself would not
have bet on going into the season. When that
special season, that golden opportunity, comes
around, you had sure as hell better not let it
drown in the sludge of your refusal to hope.
The Red Sox came into today holding first
place in the AL East, having vanquished the
hated Yankees six out of seven times. This can
easily be dismissed as meaningless early-season
success, but I'm going to choose to believe the
hype. The bullpen looks solid. Manny Ramirez is
in the zone and the starters have compiled the
best ERA in the majors. If I was ever going to be
lieve, now's the time.
You've spent enough time in the pressure
cooker that when she smiles at you with those
obsidian eyes, it barely registers at first. And
then, suddenly, you hear it at night, her voice in
your head like nobody's has been as long as you
can remember, your cool sheets suddenly hot
with the rush of blood to your skin at the echo
of her laugh. Chasing down seagulls in Half
Moon Bay at midnight, you remember what it
felt like to genuinely have fun with someone —
to believe.
So is this the Sox' year, when they shatter the
odds and buck the gorilla from their backs? Is
this it, the sledgehammer blow that finally shat
ters the shell of disbelief so carefully crafted
from defeats past? Like the Sox, will I rise to
the occasion?
I guess we'll find out.
