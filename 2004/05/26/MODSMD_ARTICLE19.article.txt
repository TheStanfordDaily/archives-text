### MIA R. LEE STAFF WRITER 
In a remarkable upset yesterday,
the top-ranked, top-seeded duo of
senior Lauren Barnikow and junior
Erin Burdette (31-3) fell in the first
round of the NCAA Doubles Cham
pionships — their earliest exit in
their three decorated years together.
The afternoon sun shone relent
lessly on the Athens, Ga., courts
where the Cardinal deferred to
William and Mary's No. 26 Megan
Muth and Amy Wei in an equally
brutal three-setter, 2-6, 7-6 (2), 6-2.
Seemingly adding insult to injury,
at the two teams' first meeting in
February, Stanford won out in an 8-
6 battle. That happened at the Na
tional Indoor Championships,
where the Cardinal stormed to a
final victory over Georgia a couple
of rounds later.
So you win some and you lose
some, but when your lazy Sunday
morning fare involves winning an
NCAA title over a close conference
challenger. No. 8 UCLA, it's safe to
say Stanford still stands on solid
tournament ground.
No. 23 Burdette (25-5) clinched
the team title this weekend against
the Bruins' Feriel Esseghir (14-14),
7-6 (5), 6-3. On court three, the 5-
foot-11 Jackson, Ga., native brought
down an overhead smash that
brought the crowd to its feet and her
teammates pouring from the stands
in a show of elation.
The courts have since been
cleared, and Stanford finds itself
caught in the fray of NCAA singles

competition. Showing few signs of
stress, sophomores Alice Barnes and
Amber Liu have broken through to
the round of 16.
No. 7 Liu (19-4), the defending
NCAA singles champion, defeated
Washington's Dea Sumantri in
straight sets, 6-2, 6-4.
"I feel pretty good," Liu said. "I
had a lapse in concentration at 5-1 in
the second set, hut 1 regained my
focus and did what I needed to win."
Despite the intense heat and hu
midity, fourth-seeded Liu had an
easy time in the first round against
Pepperdine's unseeded Natalie
Bravermen. allowing her only three
games before moving in fora punish
ing second-set shutout, 6-3, 6-0.
Liu captured the singles title last
year in an unprecedented battle
against then-senior Villmarie Castel-
Ivi of Tennessee.
Liu will square off with Sacramen
to State's Margarita Karnaukhova
today in the first-ever meeting of the
two athletes.
"I am going to try to come out and
play my game," Liu said. "I am going
to have to feel her out and see what
kind of ball she hits."
No. 10 Barnes, who was named
Most Outstanding Player for her 3-0
straight-set record during the team
tournament, continues to shine in the
individual bracket. In the second
round, Barnes overpowered Wake
Forest's Karen Coetzee, 6-1, 6-3.
"I feel very in the groove," Barnes
said. "I served well today, probably
better than yesterday, maybe even

Barnes boasts a 37-6 record this
season and has dropped only one
dual match in her collegiate career.
Seeded among No. 9-16 in the
tournament, Barnes will have to
keep her wits about her as she
faces third seed Jelena Pandzic of
No. 14 Fresno State today in the
round of 16.
Breakout freshman star Pandzic
upset Liu earlier in the regular sea
son, 6-2, 6-2, and is currently
ranked at N0.14 in the nation.
No. 40 Theresa Logar, a fresh
man, fell to Vanderbilt's Audra
Falkin in a three-set tiebreak heart
breaker yesterday. Logar bowed
out of the round of 32 and her rook
ie season with a 37-4 overall record.

Sophomore Alice Barnes is the onlv other Stanford player advancing into the round of 16. She will be up against tough competi
tion from third-seeded Jelena Panazic of Fresno State, a freshman who topped Liu earlier in the season.
In a remarkable upset yesterday,
the top-ranked, top-seeded duo of
senior Lauren Barnikow and junior
Erin Burdette (31-3) fell in the first
round of the NCAA Doubles Cham
pionships — their earliest exit in
their three decorated years together.
The afternoon sun shone relent
lessly on the Athens, Ga., courts
where the Cardinal deferred to
William and Mary's No. 26 Megan
Muth and Amy Wei in an equally
brutal three-setter, 2-6, 7-6 (2), 6-2.
Seemingly adding insult to injury,
at the two teams' first meeting in
February, Stanford won out in an 8-
6 battle. That happened at the Na
tional Indoor Championships,
where the Cardinal stormed to a
final victory over Georgia a couple
of rounds later.
So you win some and you lose
some, but when your lazy Sunday
morning fare involves winning an
NCAA title over a close conference
challenger. No. 8 UCLA, it's safe to
say Stanford still stands on solid
tournament ground.
No. 23 Burdette (25-5) clinched
the team title this weekend against
the Bruins' Feriel Esseghir (14-14),
7-6 (5), 6-3. On court three, the 5-
foot-11 Jackson, Ga., native brought
down an overhead smash that
brought the crowd to its feet and her
teammates pouring from the stands
in a show of elation.
The courts have since been
cleared, and Stanford finds itself
caught in the fray of NCAA singles

competition. Showing few signs of
stress, sophomores Alice Barnes and
Amber Liu have broken through to
the round of 16.
No. 7 Liu (19-4), the defending
NCAA singles champion, defeated
Washington's Dea Sumantri in
straight sets, 6-2, 6-4.
"I feel pretty good," Liu said. "I
had a lapse in concentration at 5-1 in
the second set, hut 1 regained my
focus and did what I needed to win."
Despite the intense heat and hu
midity, fourth-seeded Liu had an
easy time in the first round against
Pepperdine's unseeded Natalie
Bravermen. allowing her only three
games before moving in fora punish
ing second-set shutout, 6-3, 6-0.
Liu captured the singles title last
year in an unprecedented battle
against then-senior Villmarie Castel-
Ivi of Tennessee.
Liu will square off with Sacramen
to State's Margarita Karnaukhova
today in the first-ever meeting of the
two athletes.
"I am going to try to come out and
play my game," Liu said. "I am going
to have to feel her out and see what
kind of ball she hits."
No. 10 Barnes, who was named
Most Outstanding Player for her 3-0
straight-set record during the team
tournament, continues to shine in the
individual bracket. In the second
round, Barnes overpowered Wake
Forest's Karen Coetzee, 6-1, 6-3.
"I feel very in the groove," Barnes
said. "I served well today, probably
better than yesterday, maybe even

Barnes boasts a 37-6 record this
season and has dropped only one
dual match in her collegiate career.
Seeded among No. 9-16 in the
tournament, Barnes will have to
keep her wits about her as she
faces third seed Jelena Pandzic of
No. 14 Fresno State today in the
round of 16.
Breakout freshman star Pandzic
upset Liu earlier in the regular sea
son, 6-2, 6-2, and is currently
ranked at N0.14 in the nation.
No. 40 Theresa Logar, a fresh
man, fell to Vanderbilt's Audra
