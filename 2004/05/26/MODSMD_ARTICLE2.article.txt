# Rodin sculptures used in protest of treatment of Iraqi prisoners
## 
### NANCY WANG STAFF WRITER 
Last Thursday and Friday, hoods similar to
those photographed on the Iraqi prisoners at
Abu Ghraib prison were discovered on several
Rodin sculptures at the Cantor Arts Center. Ad
ministrators at the Arts Center said they do not
know who is responsible and will not further in
vestigate the matter because none of the sculp
tures was damaged.
Hoods were found on a combined total of four
sculptures at Cantor, including Adam and Eve, on
Thursday and Friday mornings. The sculptures
had black plastic bags placed on the heads and
rope tied around the necks. In addition, chalk graf
fiti stating "Rumsfeld was here" was written on ce
ment in front of the Gates of Hell and the Adam
and Eve sculptures on Wednesday.
On Thursday morning, "Rumsfeld was here"
was also found written in front of the Burghers of
Calais at the Quad, and one of the sculptures also
had a hood placed on it.
"No damage was done to the sculptures whatso
ever, which we're grateful for," said Susan
Roberts-Manganelli, manager of collections, exhi
bitions and conservation at Cantor.
"The people who did it were careful, but we're
always concerned when something happens to the
statues," she said.
Because the hoods were quickly taken down,
few passersby saw the hooded sculptures and the
museum has not received any comments from visi
tors regarding the sculptures.
Freshman Erik Hope saw the scene at the
Burghers of Calais on his way to class Thurs
day morning and said he was not surprised,
but amused.
"For people who are concerned about the situa
tion with Iraqi prisoners and want to do something
about it, the sculptures seem like a perfect target
because they're so visible," he said.
