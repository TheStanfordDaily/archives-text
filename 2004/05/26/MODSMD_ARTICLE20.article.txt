## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal Novice 8 was a wonder to be
hold at last weekend's Pacific-10 Conference
Championships in Lake Natoma, Calif., captur
ing a silver medal at the crew event — a feat un
matched by any group of freshmen since 1987.
After California leapt out to an early lead,
Stanford was left to contend with boats from
perennial powerhouse Washington and confer

ence rival Oregon State. But in the end, the Car
dinal men outlasted their competitors, clocking
in at 6 minutes, 10.9 seconds, 10 seconds behind
the Golden Bears, but a mere two seconds
ahead of third-place Oregon State. Washington
came in fourth with a time of 6:15.2.
The Junior Varsity 8 settled for fourth in a
field of seven boats after contending with the
Beavers for the bronze for the majority of its
race. Washington, Cal and Oregon State fin

ished in the top three spots, respectively.
The Varsity men also brought a fourth-place
finish back to the Farm for the fourth consecu
tive year. The Varsity 8 crossed the finish line at
6:17.7, six seconds off third-place OSU. The
Huskies once again took home top honors in
the race, with the Bears again taking second.
Next up for the men are the IRA National
Championships, to be held next week in Cherry
Hill, N.J.
