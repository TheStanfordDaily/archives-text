# Rest easy, sports fans: The Cardinal will be okay
## 
### 
1 know you're all worried. If you haven't followed
Stanford basketball closely for the past decade, you
might be wondering who the heck this Trent Johnson
guy is.
1 know alumni and students alike have been fum
ing for less than a week, thinking Maples Pavilion is
about to implode with the departure of the well-liked
and respected Mike Montgomery. And now they're
supposed to calm down since we hired one of
Monty's proteges?
But most importantly, I know that Stanford bas
ketball will be just fine without Mike Montgomery at
the helm.
In fact, the program might be better off.
Just bear with me before you come set The
Daily's building on fire.
First, you should remember that the recruiting pro
cess should actually be strengthened by the arrival of
Johnson. If you thought that the likes of Jason Collins,
Casey Jacobsen and Justin Davis came to Stanford to
play for Monty, you're sorely mistaken.
Montgomery never had the magnetic personality
that, say, Coach K at Duke or Dean Smith at North
Carolina possessed. He usually deferred the sales
pitch to his assistants, and as he grew older, Monty
started to become disenchanted with the agony of the
application process.
When Johnson was an assistant at Stanford under
Montgomery between 1996-99, he had something of a
golden touch when it came to recruiting. He played a
big part in bringing the Collins twins to campus in 1997
and, two years later, he brought in arguably the
strongest class Stanford basketball has ever had: Ja
cobsen, Curtis Borchardt, Davis, Julius Barnes and
Joe Kirchofer.
Plus, while at Nevada, he landed a coup of massive
proportions when he got Kirk Snyder, a native of Up
land. Calif., to commit to the Wolfpack — and, well,
you know the rest. . .
Secondly, Johnson will make this team much more
athletic than any of Montgomery's previous teams.
Watching the Wolfpack run up and down the court
with Georgia Tech in the Sweet 16 should show you
that Johnson is going to let loose the reins a little more
than the micro-managing Monty would ever allow.
Stanford won't be out of control, but players like
Fred Washington and Tim Morris will thrive in the
new system.
Finally, and most importantly, Johnson under
stands that in order to be successful in postseason
play, you need to be willing to make adjustments on
the fly.
For example, when Gonzaga's big force inside,
Ronny Turiaf, picked up his third foul only nine
minutes into the Wolfpack's shocking second
round victory over the "Zags, Johnson immediately
had his players stuff the ball down the collective
throat of Gonzaga.
Nevada's two most effective offensive players in
that game were not Snyder and flashy point guard
Todd Okeson, but forwards Nick Fazekas and Kevinn
Pickney, who combined for 36 points, 18 rebounds and

three blocks.
But we digress.
The most overlooked shortcoming of Mont
gomery's tenure at Stanford has been his inflexible
coaching style. As Stanford's recent second-round let
downs have proven. Monty's persistence in clinging to
his mechanical system has failed him in pressure
packed situations.
In no way am 1 trying to take away from Monty's
great successes here — he should always be known as
The Guy That Made Stanford Basketball.
But as the Cardinal's recent NCAA Tournament
struggles have shown. Montgomery has peaked in
terms of his effectiveness as a coach.
Some have suggested just the opposite — that
Monty has accomplished all that is humanly possible
given the rigorous academic standards at Stanford —
but they're getting it wrong. t
Stanford is now a national power, so we need to
stop patting ourselves on the back for getting this far
and we need to start acting like we belong.
I went back and looked at tape from some of Stan
ford's most frustrating tournament losses during
Montgomery's tenure and one thing became clear
from each of them.
His teams didn't make enough in-game adjustments.
They unyieldingly stuck to their system — and that
got them in trouble time and time again.
1999, Stanford vs. Gonzaga:
The Zags jumped out to a 23-10 lead in the first
nine minutes and were shooting the lights out from
three-point range. So did Stanford extend its defense?
No, more guys seemed to be crashing the boards (be
cause Stanford was outrebounded by a much smaller
Gonzaga team, 47-33).
2000, Stanford vs. North Carolina:
The Tar Heels' Joseph Forte had a masterful game,
and Stanford clearly didn't have anyone athletic
enough to stop him. So instead of trying to double
team him — or do anything to get in his head — the
Cardinal continued to play their patented, straight-up
man-to-man defense.
More maddeningly was the performance of Casey
Jacobsen, who shot 2-of-12 and l-of-8 from three
point range. Instead of trying to get Jacobsen some
easy looks close to the basket that might boost his star
player's confidence, Montgomery continued to run
the high curls to get Jacobsen open jumpers — which
clanked time and time again.
2001, Stanford vs. Maryland:
Maryland shot 58 percent against one of Stanford's
best defensive teams and Lonny Baxter manhandled
Jason Collins inside, scoring 24 points.
Stanford had 15 turnovers — but that stat didn't
tell the whole story, as many of the mishaps came just
as the Cardinal was wresting momentum away from
the Terps in hopes of mounting a comeback. Some
insiders bemoaned Montgomery's "stubborn" coach
ing style and claimed he was out-maneuvered by
Gary Williams.
2002, Stanford vs. Kansas:
Stanford got behind, 15-0, in less than five minutes

as the Cardinal committed five turnovers and missed
five shots on its initial eight possessions. Montgomery
refused to call a timeout — probably thinking Jacob
sen and Borchardt would settle everyone down — and
by the time he decided to stop the bleeding, the dam
age to the Stanford psyche was done.
2004, Stanford vs. Alabama:
This was the most recent and perhaps the most glar
ing. We all remember the physical nature of the game
and we also remember that Stanford never adjusted to
the way the game was being officiated. Alabama made
34 free-throws and Stanford attempted only 11.
Despite all this, the game still seemed safe as Stan
ford led by 13 with just under eight minutes remain
ing. Montgomery knew his team was lacking a sense of
urgency in its first-round win, so where was the Stan
ford coach when the Crimson Tide was in the midst of
its furious comeback?
You should remember that Monty's best adjust
ments were pre-meditated ones. Remember when
Stanford employed the hack-a-Duncan against Wake
Forest in the Cardinal's 1997 upset of the sixth-seeded
Demon Deacons? What about two years ago, when
the Cardinal upset both Xavier and Florida in the pre
season NIT with the out-of-nowhere zone defense?
Montgomery thought of those beforehand.
So why haven't we heard this criticism before?
Call it the Dusty Baker effect.
Just like the media took a liking to the former San
Francisco Giants manager, so too did the media
have a certain affinity for the man who came from
the small Montana program and put Stanford on the
national map.
They all loved his wry, sarcastic attitude in the in
terview room and his no-nonsense style on the court.
Recently, the San Francisco Chronicle ran a tale
of-the-tape on Montgomery and included such cate
gories as "sideline demeanor," "sideline posture" and
"interview demeanor."
Even Sports Illustrated got into the act, pegging
Stanford as the cleanest program in America a few
months ago solely because of Monty's influence.
Montgomery is long gone now, so maybe these
things aren't as important to think about any more.
To be sure, things won't be easy for Johnson with
out Josh Childress next year. There could be some
serious transition pains as Johnson tweaks some of
the things Monty has put in place here for almost
two decades.
But Stanford is a national power now, and we've
got to start acting like we belong.
After all these horrible postseason losses, the
only place to go is up, and Johnson will be ready to
take us there.
Maybe not next year, but soon.

Nathan Kurz is a sophomore majoring in history. If
you think he's wrong about Monty, tell him at
nkurz@stanford.edu. He's pretty sure he's never been
wrong about anything, but give it a try anyway.
