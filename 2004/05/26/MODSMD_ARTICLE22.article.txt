# Cycling team ends season at Nationals
## 
### THOMAS TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER Cycling 
Last weekend the Stanford cycling team travelled
to Madison, Wise., for the Collegiate Cycling Nation
al Championship.
Chris Montague-Breakwell put in a strong show
ing to come in second out of 150 starters in the men's
road race. He and winner Marc Collard of UC-Davis
pulled away fora modest lead in the last lap and held
on by a mere second as the pack chased them down to
the line.
Stanford riders John Cahoy and Jonas Boli also
competed, placing 71st and 81st respectively. In one
of her first races at this level. Amber Rais took home
46th in the women's As road race.
Katie Behroozi took eighth and Mary Haw. having
recently moved up from the Bs, came in 30th in the
women's As criterium. David Pearce — who did not
race during the regular season — placed 38th in the
men's criterium, followed by Montague-Breakwell in
59th and Tyler Hester in 71st.
The team time trial brought only 14th for the
women and 20th for the men and the squad could only
stand back and watch as California defended its title.
Any chance of revenge will now have to wait until
next season as, unfortunately, Stanford entered no
competitors in the final race of the year: the tradi
tional, though informal, naked criterium which took
place around the Wisconsin statehouse after the ban
quet on Saturday night.
The club has also recently elected next year's offi
cers. Hester, Rais and Rand Miller will be captains
and Karl Kloos the new treasurer.

The Stanford triathlon team is now gearing up for
races this summer, with many individuals competing
in the upcoming Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon and
the Pacific Crest Half Ironman. The final team race
will be on June 13 at the San Jose International
Triathlon.
The club has also elected a new set of officers who
are planning some big recruitment events for the fall.

Seattle. Superfly is seeded fourth behind teams it has
defeated during play this year — UC-San Diego,
MIT and UC-Davis — and of those three, only UC-

thirsty sits at third seed in the open division behind
Colorado and archrival Cal.
