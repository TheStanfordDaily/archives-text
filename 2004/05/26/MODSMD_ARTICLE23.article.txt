# U. of Colorado recruiting scandal may prompt lawsuit from fans
## 
### ERIN WIGGINS COLORADO DAILY (U. COLORADO 
(U-WIRE) BOULDER. Colo. — A group of Universi
ty of Colorado football parents, alumni, donors and fans
issued an ultimatum Saturday: Either the CU adminis
tration must address their concerns with the ongoing
CU football recruiting scandal or they will take legal ac
tion against the university.
Thomas Denning, a football season ticket holder for
14 years, told the Colorado Daily Monday that he and a
group of concerned fans are currently seeking litigation,
and at least one local law firm has shown interest in their
possible case.
"The firm 1 have been speaking with has currently
been debating internally whether they are going to come
out as an entire firm behind this or whether it will be an
individual attorney," said Denning.
"A lot of people are trying to wait and see what
happens with coach (Gary] Barnett and what the other
reforms will be. If the Barnett decision comes out this
week, and I'm told it will ... we will be able to reveal
the firm."

Denning said that breach of contract issues with the
"Winning Vision of Athletics 2010" — CU's blueprint
for athletic success — might be at the heart of the po
tential lawsuit. Denning wrote that materials about the
plan, which said CU athletics programs would strive to
"be ranked consistently in the top 20 and will compete
for the national championship," were sent out to season
ticket holders requesting renewed and increased dona
tions last year.
"We believed in this commitment when the universi
ty adopted it, which is why we gave our financial support
to CU," Denning wrote in a press release.
He said recent statements by administrators about
"competitiveness not being an issue" have led him and
other fans to believe the administration is not sticking to
its promise.
Denning said that regardless of legal means, the
group would also seek reimbursement of donations and
season tickets purchased under the 2010 commitment.
"If CU in fact follows through with these ideas of de
emphasizing athletics, we will likely ask that the univer
sity reimburse us for previous funds given in connection
with this commitment. We will also seek a refund of this

year's season ticket purchases," he wrote in the release.
Denning wouldn't say how many people are behind
him, if any, but emphasized that he has received many e
mails of accordance.
Other CU football supporters contacted by the Col
orado Daily are not pushing for litigation.
Kim Moss, a member of Buff Defenders and a 1992
alumna, said that group was trying to remain optimistic
that the reforms made at CU would not adversely affect
the athletic department and that the community could
once again support Buff football players.
"We're taking the more positive line. Our big mes
sage is not to make the football program a scapegoat,"
said Moss. "The problem with this lawsuit is that it's pre
mature — they haven't announced any reforms. Let's
wait and see what the university has in mind."
The Defenders issued a seven-page report last week
to CU President Elizabeth Hoffman, CU-Boulder
Chancellor Richard Byyny and the Board of Regents,
asking them to take into consideration their recom
mendations, which include supporting the football pro
gram, reinstating Barnett, addressing the larger prob
lems on campus and reaffirming the commitment to

athletics on campus.
Hoffman is expected to "lay out her course of action
for CU by the end of the month," according to a press
statement last week. Among other things, she is expect
ed to announce the university and football recruiting re
forms and decide Barnett's fate.
Moss thought Hoffman would reinstate Barnett, but
said she hopes the administration comes out in support
of CU football players.
"It's really frustrating as a fan and a supporter," she
said. "I'm anxiously awaiting Betsy Hoffman's speech."
Denning said he will continue to push the adminis
tration if Hoffman's speech does not implement damage
repair for the program, make the football reforms cam
pus-wide, come up with a plan to solve racial intolerance
and live up to the Winning Vision of Athletics 2010
goals.
"I will seek a refund and I will spread the word in the
best way that I can to have as many people as possible do
the same thing if we see the university does not give us
what we want," he said. "I am going to seek a refund if
Gary Barnett isn't reinstated as head coach. I'm abso
lutely sure about that."

emphasizing athletics, we will likely ask that the univer
sity reimburse us for previous funds given in connection
with this commitment. We will also seek a refund of this

year's season ticket purchases," he wrote in the release.
Denning wouldn't say how many people are behind
him, if any, but emphasized that he has received many e
mails of accordance.
Other CU football supporters contacted by the Col
orado Daily are not pushing for litigation.
Kim Moss, a member of Buff Defenders and a 1992
alumna, said that group was trying to remain optimistic
that the reforms made at CU would not adversely affect
the athletic department and that the community could
once again support Buff football players.
"We're taking the more positive line. Our big mes
sage is not to make the football program a scapegoat,"
said Moss. "The problem with this lawsuit is that it's pre
mature — they haven't announced any reforms. Let's
wait and see what the university has in mind."
The Defenders issued a seven-page report last week
to CU President Elizabeth Hoffman, CU-Boulder
Chancellor Richard Byyny and the Board of Regents,
asking them to take into consideration their recom
mendations, which include supporting the football pro
gram, reinstating Barnett, addressing the larger prob
lems on campus and reaffirming the commitment to

athletics on campus.
Hoffman is expected to "lay out her course of action
for CU by the end of the month," according to a press
statement last week. Among other things, she is expect
ed to announce the university and football recruiting re
forms and decide Barnett's fate.
Moss thought Hoffman would reinstate Barnett, but
said she hopes the administration comes out in support
of CU football players.
"It's really frustrating as a fan and a supporter," she
said. "I'm anxiously awaiting Betsy Hoffman's speech."
Denning said he will continue to push the adminis
tration if Hoffman's speech does not implement damage
repair for the program, make the football reforms cam
pus-wide, come up with a plan to solve racial intolerance
and live up to the Winning Vision of Athletics 2010
goals.
"I will seek a refund and I will spread the word in the
best way that I can to have as many people as possible do
the same thing if we see the university does not give us
what we want," he said. "I am going to seek a refund if
Gary Barnett isn't reinstated as head coach. I'm abso
lutely sure about that."
