## Dartmouth students dispute drinking survey 
### KRISTEN KELLEY THE DARTMOUTH 
(U-WIRE) HANOVER, N.H. â€” Students have long casually poked fun
at Dartmouth College's social norms program, renowned for distributing col
orful posters and free Nalgene water bottles with information on alcohol use
at Dartmouth. But this year, undergraduate mathematics students and one
professor have charged that the program's most popular claim is inaccurate
and misleading.
In the most visible highlight of this year's program, health educators from
Dick's House conducted an alcohol screening process and provided students
with free Nalgene bottles afterward. The bottles were inscribed with the mes
sage: "87 percent of Dartmouth students don't feel the need to drink in order
to 'fit in."'
Peter Doyle, a mathematics professor who teaches courses on applied
probability, introduced these social norms statistics to his class and received
immediate interest from students who doubted the veracity of the College's
claims.
Junior Kailin Kroetz said she found the statistic promoted on the Nalgene
bottle to be inconsistent with the administered survey.
"After looking at the statistics in class, the quote on the bottle is an inac
curate and misleading interpretation of the results of a survey," Kroetz said.
According to Kroetz and others of the survey's critics, the statistic is inac
curate because of the possible sample bias of those who responded to the on
line survey.
The study, first conducted in 1999, was given online. A randomly selected
group of 1,200 students received e-mails asking them to voluntarily complete
the 100-question survey. About 50 percent of those students answered the
survey, raising questions about how much survey respondents drink in com
parison with non-respondents.
The message on the bottle comes from responses to a question designed
to understand why Dartmouth students decide to drink or not drink. Because
only 13 percent of students agreed with the statement, "I drink to fit in with
a group I like," Dick's House alcohol educators interpreted that the remain
ing 87 percent of students do not feel they need to drink to fit in with their
friends.
The message on the Nalgene bottle was then crafted as a result of Dick's
House focus groups assessed the believability of the statistic.
According to Ryan Travia, coordinator of the College's alcohol and other

drug education programs, after the data from the survey is tabulated and an
alyzed, he presents the data to "creative groups" consisting of students, ad
visors and community members. The group discusses the survey's results and
creates messages to promote low-risk of alcohol use.
"The groups created over 30 'believable' messages from the data," Travia
said. "Before the marketing process, we did a message testing phase, asking
300 students to comment on believability and understanding of the message.
The message on the 2004 Nalgene bottle was one of seven 'believable' mes
sages."
The portrayal of these messages through campus media, such as posters,
e-mails and announcements seeks to reassure students, parents and faculty
that current policies exist on campus to reduce the level of drinking.
But senior Erin Anderson was not fooled by statistics pertaining to the
role of drinking at Dartmouth, claiming that adverbs in survey questions are
difficult to define and often open to interpretation.
Anderson, however, carries a 2001 social norms campaign Nalgene bottle,
and believes it serves a useful purpose in making people think about drink
ing.
"Paraphernalia that are distributed for the campaign serve as interesting
conversation topics and get people talking and debating about alcohol at
Dartmouth and its pros and cons," Anderson said. "I have talked with peo
ple both at Dartmouth and out-of-state who read my Nalgene and com
mented on it."
College students are notorious for maintaining the highest rate of heavy
drinking in any segment of society, causing increasing rates of disruption, vi
olence and assault.
A 2003 study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that more and
more universities resort to social norms marketing in hopes of reducing cam
pus drinking.
However, the study did not find sufficient evidence to support the effec
tiveness of social norms marketing programs in reducing alcohol use.
It remains in question, then, why Dartmouth and other universities par
ticipate in social norm marketing when alcohol consumption is not shown to
be reduced.
"We understand that social norms design does not work for everyone, so
we don't put all our eggs in one basket," Travia said. "We try to reach out to
folks not just to screen for alcohol dependency but to make other resources
available pertaining to tobacco and other substances that may benefit stu
dents and peers."
