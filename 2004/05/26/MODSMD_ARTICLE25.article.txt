# Florida Senator seeks campaign ad reform

### MEGAN SEERY INDEPENDENT FLORIDA ALLIGATOR 
(U-WIRE) GAINESVILLE, Fla. — U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, D-Fla.,
began seeking co-sponsors Friday fora bill requiring independent re
views of advertisements for federal elections.
The bill, filed May 13, was written after the federal General Account
ing Office (GAO) determined the Bush administration violated two fed
eral laws during a Medicare publicity campaign.
The Department of Health and Human Services-sponsored campaign
consisted of T.V. ads about Medicare changes made to look like news re
ports. According to the GAO, the agency violated laws against the use of
federal money for propaganda and the unauthorized use of federal funds.
"The concern is two-pronged," said Dan McLaughlin, director of com
munications for Nelson's office. "There is a lot of money spent by gov
ernment agencies for ads which are supposed to be public service an
nouncements and not political propaganda."
Nelson's office learned the federal government spends more than $1
billion on advertising each year, McLaughlin said, adding no single orga
nization oversees the ads.
"We want this bill to affect taxpayers so their money is not wasted or
misspent," he said. "There is a legitimate purpose for public service an
nouncements. They shouldn't be converted to political or campaign ads."
University of Florida Marketing Prof. Richard Lutz said the ads might
be illegal if they are demonstrably misleading to those who use Medicare.
"They [the Department of Health and Human Services] are attempt
ing to make it appear as if an independent news source is evaluating a pro
gram as a major benefit, when actually a government agency is putting
forth that information," he said. "It doesn't even appear to be a commer
cial, it appears to be a news report."
Broadcasters have a responsibility to the public and should use their
best judgment when deciding whether to air any ads submitted to them,
he said. Forty television stations aired the three ads released.
As an example of how to determine if one of the Medicare ads is mis
leading, Lutz said it could be shown to a group of retirees who are watch
ing a newscast. After the ad airs, the viewers would be asked if they
thought it was news and, if so, who the news source was.
If a high percentage respond they thought the ad was from an inde
pendent news source, the ad is misleading, Lutz said.
Approximately $44,000 was spent to make three videos — two in En
glish and one in Spanish.
U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., is preparing a related bill that
would require the Bush administration to reimburse the money,
McLaughlin said.
Bill Pierce, an HHS spokesman, told the Washington Post the ads were
not misleading because broadcasters could have done original reporting
and knew the segments were government-produced.
The agency was not wrong to release the ads, he said, adding video
news releases are commonplace in public relations work.
