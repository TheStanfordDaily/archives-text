# CSU students face tuition hikes for next three years
## 
### JENN STEWART DAILY TITAN 
(U-WIRE) FULLERTON,
Calif. â€” So much for the lazy days
of summer, with the recently ap
proved fee increases for California
State University (CSU) and Univer
sity of California (UC) students
every penny counts.
CSU Trustees voted last
Wednesday to approve a 14 percent
increase in fees for undergraduates
and about a 25 percent increase for
graduate students as part of a budget
agreement designed by CSU Chan
cellor Charles Reed, UC President
Robert C. Dynes and Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
Cal State undergraduates will
pay $2,300 annually, a $288 increase
from the 2003-2004 school year.
Fees for graduate students will in
crease by $564, bringing their annu
al total to more than $2,800.
"We never like to increase fees,"
Reed said. "But on the other hand, I
think you have to maintain quality."
In a conference call Thursday,
Reed explained the fee increase in
relation to the budget agreement
known as the compact agreement.
The agreement calls for fee increas
es over the next three years followed
by an increase in the universities'
base budgets and enrollment growth
beginning in 2005-2006.
"For the first time in three years,
it makes a commitment to the fu

ture," Reed said. " The compact
agreement is not a ceiling, it is a
floor."
The new fees take effect next fall
with additional 8 percent increases
the following two years. This fee in
crease accounts for about $100 mil
lion of the governor's proposed $240
million cut.
Those fee increases will allow
CSU system schools to admit an ad
ditional 13,500 students and prohib
it 1,600 faculty lay-offs next year.
The CSU Trustees approved the
budget 10-1; the lone dissenter was
Alex Lopez, the former Associated
Students Inc. president atCSUF. He
has represented CSU students on
the Board of Trustees for two years.
Lopez said the universities
agreed on the compact because
"they feel cutting a deal would in
crease their odds of getting a budget
increase in the future."
Lopez said that he has seen a 55 per
cent increase during his two years as
a trustee and that the problem of
skyrocketing budget increases stems
from the state's priorities.
"I think the problem is really in
the legislature, it's up to them to
make education a priority," he said.
Lopez said state legislators are
hesitant to raise taxes and view stu
dents as apathetic when it comes to
voting, making them an easy target
for budget cuts.
"We're not a priority. Health is
ahead of us, welfare is ahead of us,"

Lopez said. "Be prepared, things
don't look like they'll improve."
Lopez did say that one benefit of
the compact agreement is that stu
dents will have a set budget for the
next few years, without last-minute
increases.
The state budget is currently
being debated instate legislature,
where Reed said he hopes addition
al money will be added to education
so the state can accept more stu
dents.
However, last July the state legis
lature cut the CSU budget by $85
million. The last-minute cut left
many students stunned when they
were dropped from classes for not
paying fees they were unaware of.
"My experience was that these
were our very best friends and they
were the ones that cut our budget by
$85 million," Reed said. "I think that
they are feeling really guilty about
that."
The compact agreement also ear
marked an additional $10.4 million
in financial aid for needy students.
CSUF students will now have to
decide how to afford the increases.
Marisol Woltke, a child and adoles
cent studies major, said the first
thing to go will be her entertainment
fund, her primary form of stress re
lief.
"I am already struggling with
high gas prices and such," Woltke
said. "Now it's going to be more dif
ficult."
