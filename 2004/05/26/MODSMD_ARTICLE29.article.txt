# Oregon students selling books unwittingly committing felony

### LISA CATTO OREGON DAILY EMERALD 
(U-WIRE) EUGENE, Ore.â€”
University of Oregon students who
sell back textbooks for strangers
could unknowingly be committing a
felony.
Eugene Police Department Offi
cer Randy Ellis has been investigating
about a dozen instances of stolen
books sold back to the UO Bookstore
and Smith Family Bookstore over the
past month. Ellis said the books are
stolen from various bookstores or
from students, adding that most of the
suspects who have been apprehended
are addicts who sell the stolen books
to buy drugs.
He said that in most cases, some
one asks a student to sell books to the
University Bookstore using his or her
student identification card. The per
petrator promises shared profits in
exchange for the favor.
"A student will get his or herself in
trouble by thinking they're helping
someone and earning some extra
cash," Ellis said.
University Bookstore General
Manager Jim Williams said thefts and
book selling occur too often and con
tinue to get worse.
He said it isn't a big problem for
the University Bookstore, but he
hopes to curb the crime before it gets
out of control.
Smith Family Bookstore Manager
Nancy Smith said this has been an in

creasing problem for her business as
well.
She estimates that the bookstore
reports a new suspected book stealer
to EPD every week. She added that
Smith Family Bookstore staff has to
call other Eugene-area bookstores on
a daily basis to inquire about missing
books.
Ellis said the majority of stolen
books are medical and science text
books because they are generally
worth more money when sold back.
He added that perpetrators usual
ly approach students outside of book
stores. Fortunately, he said, several
security officers within the University
Bookstore have noticed and reported
repeat offenders.
Stealing textbooks and selling
them back hurts more people than
just the bookstore, Ellis said, because
bookstores sometimes have to take
drastic measures to recoup the loss in
revenue.
"When textbooks get stolen, it
forces the price of textbooks up,"
Ellis said. "It hurts everybody."
Ellis said a student caught selling a
stolen book could be charged with the
felony of selling stolen property if the
student suspected the book was
stolen.
"Most students want to help peo
ple," Ellis said. "That's why they give
money to panhandlers. They trust
people because they know they
wouldn't do that themselves."
Ellis said students should watch

out for this scam, especially because
spring term book buy-back is ap
proaching.
So far, the number of thefts and
book selling instances have required
the University Bookstore to pay
more attention to customer behavior,
and the staff may look into stronger
measures to prevent theft, Williams
said.
He added that if the problem con
tinues to worsen, staff may have to
consider closing the textbook area
during non-book buying times and re
quiring staff assistance.
Smith said the staff at Smith Fami
ly Bookstore has not decided to make
any changes to their security or meth
ods, but the staff does use several
methods to determine if someone is
selling a stolen book.
She said one safety net they have is
they require either a University stu
dent ID or an Oregon driver's license
to sell back a book. She also said the
staff talks to the book seller to see if
they can speak "a college-level sen
tence," as well as inquiring about the
class and instructor the book was for.
She added that if staff members
are suspicious about someone selling
a textbook, he or she may ask if the
books belong to that person and ex
plain that selling stolen books is a
crime.
"(Smith Family Bookstore) and
the University Bookstore are very
fair to people who are honest," Smith
said.
