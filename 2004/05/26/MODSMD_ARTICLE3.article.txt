# Okada House play reflects on issues of race
## 
### JULIE YEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In recognition of Asian American Pacific
Islander Heritage Month, Okada House is
holding two performances of "The Art of
Waiting" by Rob Shin. Adapted and directed
by senior Jordan Peralta and produced by 25
residents, the play addresses issues of race and
personal identity.
"Waiting" takes place in the mind of a Kore
an-American named Rob, 10 minutes before he
goes on stage to deliver a comedy routine. His
monologue travels through stages of his life, con
necting memories from his younger self, Bobby
(played by junior Dennis Lee), with those from
his roles as a waiter at a Chinese restaurant

(sophomore Eric Chu) and a stand-up comedian
sophomore Andrew Sung). At one moment, he
clutches a teddy bear; at another, he scurries
from table to table at the restaurant.
Throughout the play, he is perpetually wait
ing â€” whether hastily waiting on tables or ner
vously waiting to deliver jokes. Ultimately, he
must weigh these memories together to make a
crucial final decision.
"Waiting" came out of a workshop that Shin
attended at Brown University. Okada Ethnic
Theme Assistant Howard Chiou said that the
house selected the play because "it is kind of
quirky and very much a college production. This
sort of play is harder to do anywhere else."
"The scale and scope of the play requires a
large amount of participation," he added. "The

whole idea is that it is a community-based pro
duction, so it's a chance for the house to come to
gether to work toward something that is not just
fun but meaningful for whoever comes."
Many of the issues approached in the play are
supposed to mirror those not often addressed in
the Stanford community. Building from a cultur
ally diverse cast, Peralta said he hopes "Waiting"
will draw and speak to members of all ethnicities,
rather than just Asian Americans.
"The issues approached in the play are not
just Asian issues, and stereotypes that are dis
cussed deal with African-American and Cau
casian stereotypes, rather than only Asian
stereotypes," Peralta said. "It's fairly diverse on
campus, but the issue of racial rela
tions is not really talked about. The
play is another way to initiate dis
cussion of these issues because they
do need discussion."
By adding dimension to issues
of race, Lee said "Waiting" chal
lenges notions of interracial con
cerns can be approached from only
one side.
"It stresses personal accountabil
ity," Lee said. "Accountability in in
terracial matters is often left out of
the equation. You usually don't re
ally take into account all the other
unconscious attitudes you might
have towards other people. You
think that just because you are a mi
nority it doesn't matter as much if
you discriminate against other peo
ple, but it actually matters a lot."
Lee said acting in the play served
as a means for him to creatively ex
plore his own identity as well. He
lived in Okada his freshman year
and was at first afraid of acting in the
house play. Now a junior, he plays
Rob as a younger child and as an
adolescent.
"My role covers a large age span,
and 1 think that the part that gave
me the most cause to think upon my
own life was Rob's relationship with
his parents," he said. "His view of
his parents is colored by their hard
ship as immigrants, and he has great
difficulty in resolving the humilia
tions that they have endured, be
cause their experiences inevitably

become part of who he is."
Lee added, "Although my family
experience doesn't mirror Rob's ex
perience, the role has led me to ex
amine the reasons that I've formed
views toward my own parents,
whether they stem from the work
they do, the way they are treated by
non-Asians or their struggle to inte
grate our family into society while
upholding our dignity."
Sung said that through his per
formance, audience members might
similarly be able to relate to the sit
uation Rob experienced.
"The role has definitely broad
ened my perspective about Asian-
American issues," he said. "[Rob]
underwent a lot of peer pressure
when he was younger, and as a col
lege student, he feels a lot of pres
sure from society, specifically from
his boss, Mr. Showbiz. [The audi
ence] doesn't have to follow what he
does, but they can understand the
type of Asian-American identity is
sues out there."
Chiou views the performance
as a means to celebrate multicul
turalism as well as Asian-Ameri
can expression.
"It's also a chance to highlight
the talent we have in the house," he
said. "Asian-American creative
arts are already underrepresented
on campus. Xhis is a way a way for
people to address that, so that
there's a forum for Asian-Ameri
can expression, even if it's just
through this play."
Okada House will perform "The
Art of Waiting" this Thursday and
Friday in Roble Parlor at 8 p.m. Ad
mission is free.
