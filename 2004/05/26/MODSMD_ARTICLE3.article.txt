In recognition of Asian American Pacific
Islander Heritage Month, Okada House is
holding two performances of "The Art of
Waiting" by Rob Shin. Adapted and directed

large amount of participation," he added. "The

whole idea is that it is a community-based pro
duction, so it's a chance for the house to come to
gether to work toward something that is not just
fun but meaningful for whoever comes."
Many of the issues approached in the play are
supposed to mirror those not often addressed in
the Stanford community. Building from a cultur
ally diverse cast, Peralta said he hopes "Waiting"
will draw and speak to members of all ethnicities,
rather than just Asian Americans.
"The issues approached in the play are not
just Asian issues, and stereotypes that are dis

stereotypes," Peralta said. "It's fairly diverse on
