# Columbia Teaching Assistants march for right to unionize

### KATIE O'REILLY DAILY NORTHWESTERN 
(U-WIRE) EVANSTON, 111. â€” More than 400 teaching assistants
(TAs), graduate students and supporters marched out of Columbia Univer
sity classrooms April 19 in an effort to alert the university's administration
that the majority of the TAs wanted to unionize.
Picket-bearing strikers lined both sides of the university's entrance two
weeks before the semester's end. Each day since, graduate students have re
turned to protest from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. on a rotation-based schedule.
TAs and residential assistants at Columbia have been fighting for more
than two years to unionize with Graduate Student Employees United. Sev
eral other universities' administrations across the nation have faced similar
demands, but Northwestern TAs and students said this trend is unlikely to
spread to NU.
Columbia graduate students teach most of the undergraduate "core cur
riculum" and work as assistants and graders in large lecture classes.

"In my four semesters as a TA, I have taught [more than) 400 students,
and I've always held two other jobs just to pay the rent," said Columbia art
history graduate student Katie Isard.
The university's administrators continues to adhere to their anti-union
campaign. Officials argue that TAs are getting "vocational training" and are
therefore not workers.
Students and professors have expressed solidarity with the TAs.
They attended a mid-campus rally, signed petitions, moved some classes
off campus and have joined TAs in picketing slogans such as "If we're not
workers, then I'm not working" and "Historians against 19th-century labor
laws."
"The Union [would provide] a huge amount of dignity for us," said
Mehmet Dosemeci, a history graduate student at Columbia. "If the strike at
Columbia is the beginning of something, as more and more battles are won,
it will become easier for other schools."
Similar unionization efforts are under way at Syracuse University,
Brown University and the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

But Northwestern TAs say there is little evidence to indicate demands for
unions or strikes in the near future.
"The frustrations [of being a TA] are definitely a huge burden on grad
students," said David Schmudde, a music technology TA at NU. "I have
friends who literally have no time between all the grading and loads of pho
tocopying."
Although TAs have a considerable workload, many grad students con
sider this a natural roadblock along the path of academia.
Nil's graduate student handbook states, "This university will not tolerate
any attempt by individuals or organizations to disrupt the regularly sched
uled activities of the university."
It further stipulates that offenders are then subject to expulsion. Accord
ing to NU's English department, the TA is "performing an academic ser
vice."
"1 doubt a strike would go over at all here [at NU]," graduate student
Tapan Patel said. "There isn't enough interest, and those who don't comply
would be quickly replaced by the university."
