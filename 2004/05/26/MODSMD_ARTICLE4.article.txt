# Stanford welcomes Johnson
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Speculation that former Stanford assistant Trent
Johnson would fill the head coaching vacancy left by
Mike Montgomery became reality yesterday afternoon.
Director of Athletics Ted Leland formally intro
duced Johnson as Stanford's 16th men's basketball head
coach at a press conference in Arrillaga.
"Obviously, I'm overwhelmed," said the 47-year-old
Johnson, as his wife, Jackie, members of the basketball
team and a crowd of reporters looked on. "It is evident
that, in my coaching career, I have had the opportunity
to be around some great coaches and athletes. I am very
fortunate to be in this position."
Leland pointed to Johnson's coaching pedigree that
includes assistant roles at Washington, Utah, Rice and
most recently at Stanford under Montgomery from
1996-99 before he took over the head coaching position
at Nevada.
"We have a tough act to follow, but we are convinced
we found the right person," Leland said.
The Wolf Pack's surprising run to the Sweet 16 in this
year's NCAA Tournament helped earn Johnson a five
year, $2,250,000 contract extension at Nevada and put
him on the short list of possibilities for schools looking to
fill vacant head coaching positions, such as Utah. But
long before his success this season, the respect that John
son garnered from Montgomery and the players during

his three years on the Farm put him at
the top of Leland's list of coaching
candidates in the event that Mont
gomery decided to leave.
"He had an incredible amount of
support internally from Stanford,"
said Leland, who indicated that
Montgomery was supportive of the
decision to pursue Johnson after Le
land identified him as his prime can
didate. Montgomery coached John
son for two years as an assistant at
Boise State, where Johnson played
from 1974-78.
"It's pretty evident that the gentle
man that I'm replacing didn't have a
clue about what was going on in col
lege basketball." Johnson joked be
fore becoming slightly more serious
about his good friend Montgomery.
"He's been a huge influence on me.
I've had the misfortune to know
Coach since I was 17 years old. Am I
honored to be replacing him? Yes I
am, but Coach Montgomery will not
be replaced. I have my own personali
ty and way of doing things and I am
going to try to be myself every step of
the way."
Montgomery's assistants Eric
Reveno, Tony Fuller and Russell
Turner will return to work on John
son's staff and should help ease the
transition and continue to play a large
role in recruiting, while lending stabil
ity to the program that Montgomery
headed for the past 18 years. Johnson
vowed not to make wholesale changes.
"The only thing I'm going to guar
antee everybody is that the wheels
are going to stay on," Johnson said.
"My nature is to be aggressive from
start to finish, offensively and defen
sively. Everything else pretty much is
in place."
Several important parts of the team
that finished 30-2 and earned a No. 1
seed in the NCAA tournament will be
missing, however.

In addition to the loss of seniors
Justin Davis, Joe Kirchofer and Matt
Lottich, All-American forward Josh
Childress has declared himself eligi
ble for the NBA draft. Though he has
not hired an agent, leaving open the
possibility of returning to school,
many believe that Childress is as
good as gone.
Still, the cupboard is not bare with
veterans Dan Grunfeld. Jason Haas,
Matt Haryasz, Chris Hernandez Rob
Little and Nick Robinson all return
ing, plus a talented group of sopho

mores and incoming freshmen. John
son helped recruit Robinson in 1998.
"At this point, I'll fully support
coach Johnson and I want to rally my
teammates behind him as well,"
Robinson said. "I think the adjust
ments that coach Johnson will make
will be beneficial to us as a group."
Added Hernandez: "It will take
time to get to know him, but ex-play
ers have nothing but good stuff to say
about coach Johnson, so that really
helps. I definitely like his mentality of
being aggressive."

Yesterday afternoon's announce
ment was essentially a formality after
Nevada Director of Athletics Cary
Groth announced that Johnson had re
signed as head coach of the Wolf Pack
at an 8 a.m. press conference in Reno
yesterday morning.
Leland initially contacted Johnson
on Friday after Montgomery's hiring
by the NBA's Golden State Warriors
became official. Johnson flew to cam
pus on Sunday and met with Stanford
officials and the team before a deal
was worked out on Monday night.

be replaced. I have my own personali
ty and way of doing things and I am
going to try to be myself every step of
the way."
Montgomery's assistants Eric
Reveno, Tony Fuller and Russell
Turner will return to work on John
son's staff and should help ease the
transition and continue to play a large
role in recruiting, while lending stabil
ity to the program that Montgomery
headed for the past 18 years. Johnson
vowed not to make wholesale changes.
"The only thing I'm going to guar
antee everybody is that the wheels
are going to stay on," Johnson said.
"My nature is to be aggressive from
start to finish, offensively and defen
sively. Everything else pretty much is
in place."
Several important parts of the team
that finished 30-2 and earned a No. 1
seed in the NCAA tournament will be
missing, however.

In addition to the loss of seniors
Justin Davis, Joe Kirchofer and Matt
Lottich, All-American forward Josh
Childress has declared himself eligi
ble for the NBA draft. Though he has
not hired an agent, leaving open the
possibility of returning to school,
many believe that Childress is as
good as gone.
Still, the cupboard is not bare with
veterans Dan Grunfeld. Jason Haas,
Matt Haryasz, Chris Hernandez Rob
Little and Nick Robinson all return
ing, plus a talented group of sopho

mores and incoming freshmen. John
son helped recruit Robinson in 1998.
"At this point, I'll fully support
coach Johnson and I want to rally my
teammates behind him as well,"
Robinson said. "I think the adjust
ments that coach Johnson will make
will be beneficial to us as a group."
Added Hernandez: "It will take
time to get to know him, but ex-play
ers have nothing but good stuff to say
about coach Johnson, so that really
helps. I definitely like his mentality of
being aggressive."

Yesterday afternoon's announce
ment was essentially a formality after
Nevada Director of Athletics Cary
Groth announced that Johnson had re
signed as head coach of the Wolf Pack
at an 8 a.m. press conference in Reno
yesterday morning.
Leland initially contacted Johnson
on Friday after Montgomery's hiring
by the NBA's Golden State Warriors
became official. Johnson flew to cam
pus on Sunday and met with Stanford
officials and the team before a deal
was worked out on Monday night.

Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland presents newly-appointed head basketball coach Trent Johnson with a Cardinal jersey at a
press conference yesterday afternoon. Johnson, who becomes the team's 16th head coach, declared that the program was not
headed for any major changes, a fact evidenced by his decision to maintain all of the team's current assistant coaches.
Speculation that former Stanford assistant Trent
Johnson would fill the head coaching vacancy left by
Mike Montgomery became reality yesterday afternoon.
Director of Athletics Ted Leland formally intro
duced Johnson as Stanford's 16th men's basketball head
coach at a press conference in Arrillaga.
"Obviously, I'm overwhelmed," said the 47-year-old
Johnson, as his wife, Jackie, members of the basketball
team and a crowd of reporters looked on. "It is evident
that, in my coaching career, I have had the opportunity
to be around some great coaches and athletes. I am very
fortunate to be in this position."
Leland pointed to Johnson's coaching pedigree that
includes assistant roles at Washington, Utah, Rice and
most recently at Stanford under Montgomery from
1996-99 before he took over the head coaching position
at Nevada.
"We have a tough act to follow, but we are convinced
we found the right person," Leland said.
The Wolf Pack's surprising run to the Sweet 16 in this
year's NCAA Tournament helped earn Johnson a five
year, $2,250,000 contract extension at Nevada and put
him on the short list of possibilities for schools looking to
fill vacant head coaching positions, such as Utah. But
long before his success this season, the respect that John
son garnered from Montgomery and the players during

his three years on the Farm put him at
the top of Leland's list of coaching
candidates in the event that Mont
gomery decided to leave.
"He had an incredible amount of
support internally from Stanford,"
said Leland, who indicated that
Montgomery was supportive of the
decision to pursue Johnson after Le
land identified him as his prime can
didate. Montgomery coached John
son for two years as an assistant at
Boise State, where Johnson played
from 1974-78.
"It's pretty evident that the gentle
man that I'm replacing didn't have a
clue about what was going on in col
lege basketball." Johnson joked be
fore becoming slightly more serious
about his good friend Montgomery.
"He's been a huge influence on me.
I've had the misfortune to know
Coach since I was 17 years old. Am I
honored to be replacing him? Yes I
am, but Coach Montgomery will not
be replaced. I have my own personali
ty and way of doing things and I am
going to try to be myself every step of
the way."
