# 'Green' building planned for Row
## 
### SARAH TENG 
ital plan currently includes three new 55-student Row
houses, and at least one is expected to be green.
Organizers of the project intend for the buildings
to be cost-effective, saving money by reducing opera
tions and maintenance costs, as well as by lowering
utility bills. Green buildings are also touted to create
a healthier environment, with more natural light and
cleaner air.
"Constructing better buildings has global implica
tions via the use of energy, water and land," Taylor
said. "Energy use is one of the primary causes of
global climate change, which is projected to have
major negative impacts on people around the world
in coming years. Thus, learning how to build build
ings that make their occupants more comfortable
while using less energy will actually change the future
of the world."
CEE Prof. Gil Masters helped organize the stu
dent working group and led CEE 299, the class in
which the Green Dorm Project has been a study pro
ject for two quarters. Professors and students have
also been working on various aspects of the green
dorm in CEE 111: "3D/4D Modeling" and CEE
173M: "Combined Heat and Power Systems." It is
also planned as the subject of design projects for
Urban Studies 172: "Green Architecture."
"It is unusual for students to be so involved with
the scoping and design process," Taylor said. "How
ever, working with knowledgeable students seems to
appeal to the Department of Project Management as
they are going ahead with it, despite its unusual be
ginnings. This will be a case of student work making
a real difference."

The Green Dorm Project, a University plan that
students are helping to create, aims to make the next
Row house constructed at Stanford a "green build
ing"â€” one that uses resources like energy, water,
materials and land more efficiently than buildings
that are simply built to code.
The idea for the green dorm originated from the
Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) De
partment, and has since been endorsed by a number
of faculty. James Plummer, the dean of the School of
Engineering, has also given it his blessing and has al
located funds for the initial scoping study. Laura
Goldstein, the facilities service administrator of the
Department of Project Management, is the project
manager for the green dorm. Bob Reidy, the vice
provost for lands and buildings, will ultimately over
see the entire project.
A number of students are involved with the plan
ning as well.
"While Stanford prides itself on innovative
programs that lead their fields, it has fallen
somewhat behind in its infrastructure programs,"
said senior Cody Taylor. "We have the opportu
nity to catch up and employ the techniques being
used at other institutions to provide future gen
erations of Stanford students with a living and
learning environment that complements the Uni
versity mission and helps them achieve at the
peak of their abilities."
According to Taylor, there is no specific timeline
for the project at this point, but the University's cap-
