10 Random Questions
ASSU Executives Chioke Borgelt-Mose and
Kory Vargas Caro
By BARRETT SHERIDAN
DESK EDITOR
Sophomores Chioke Borgelt-Mose Kory Vargas Caro will he
next year's ASSU president and vice president, respectively.
1) You both have strange names. Actually all three of us have
strange names. I)o you think that name recognition helped
you win the election?
KVC: We thought actually it was going to hurt us, because no
one can remember six names. We thought Lee and Schwartz
had more name recognition than us.
CBM: There's a certain ring, but I don't know if it necessari
ly helped us at all.
2) Did you know that "Icky Hooker"
is an anagram of your first names?
Subliminal messaging?
KVC: Icky Hooker?
CBM: I would never think of Kory
and I as being icky hookers, but that
might have been an even better
name-grabber.
KVC: 'Chioke-Kory: We Sell
Ourselves.'
3) If, for some reason, the GSC didn't
certify the special election, wouldn't
you guys be kind of like Al Gore win-
ning the popular vote but losing because of some idiotic con
stitutional anachronism?
KVC: I feel like we'd riot. I'm sorry, but I don't think we'd
give up now.
4) Speaking of the first election, how come you guys didn't
run then?
CBM: We were thinking of running next year, but after the
first election wasn't certified and there was going to be a spe
cial election, we felt that there wasn't really strong candidates
that were going to be representing the student body as a
whole that were running again, so Kory and I decided to step
up.
5) How did you decide who got to be president —
thumb wrestling?
KVC: We were like, 'Chioke's more attractive. She should
be president.'
CBM: We just talked about it.
6) One of your biggest competitors was the Mountain Lion /
Kirchofer slate, and the Mountain Lion died under mysteri
ous circumstances. Any comment?
CBM: I have a problem with people killing mountain lions.
It's like this whole twisted view. It's like, "Well, the mountain
lion was coming into my backyard." I'm like, "Whose back
yard was it first?"
KVC: I think that great leaders are assassinated usually. Kir
chofer's okay, right?
7) What will be your first act in office?
CBM: I feel like the minute we finally get certified I'll proba
bly want ice cream or something to celebrate.
KVC: We're going to meet with Nadiya and Joey. That'll
probably be our first act in office.
8) I propose a graduate student bicycle helmet ban. It will
make them all much cooler.
CBM: No comment.
9) What is the difference between Pizza My Heart and Pizza
A Gogo? I have a friend that's dying to know.
CBM: Pizza My Heart has the free pizza slice coupons that
you can get in the directory. I would know, because 1 use
those free pizza slice coupons all the time.
10) You've had to deal with The Daily a lot in recent weeks.
Give a grade to The Daily's coverage of the special election.
KVC: We both really appreciate The Daily endorsing us, but
we were confused. They seemed really angry during the elec
tion — at the Senate, at everybody. We're going into the
ASSU — does there really need to be anger towards it?
CBM: I think it was the peoples' first introduction to the fact
that there was a special election going on, which was good, be
cause a lot of people didn't really realize there was anything
going on.

Ballet Folklorico de Stanford holds annual show on Friday
By ERIK HOPE
For freshman Veronica Ramirez,
the presence of Ballet Folklorico de
Stanford, or BFdeS, on campus was an
important factor in her decision to at
tend the University. She saw Ballet
Folklorico perform at an El Centro
Chicano Admit Weekend event and
realized that she wanted to build on her
previous Folklorico dance experience.
Dancing with BFdeS has been a college
highlight for Ramirez and others.
"1 think what 1 love most about
being in Ballet Folklorico de Stanford
is that everyone who dances is in the
group because they want to be there,"
Ramirez said. "From what I've seen in
my own dance experience, there are
only a few who can say that they started
dancing because it was an inner drive"
Stanford's Ballet Folklorico de Stan
ford dance group is holding its annual
spring show, Concierto de la Primavera,
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium this Friday.
Originally started in 1972 as a Mex
ican folk dance exhibition class, BFdeS
is now an active, student-run dance
group devoted to sharing Mexican
Folkorico dance with Stanford and the
local community.
The group has been extremely active
on campus since its first performance on
the altar of Memorial Church, and per
formed for Mexican president Salinas de
Gortari during Stanford's centennial cel
ebration. It currently performs actively
throughout the year and holds five major
on-campus performances each year, cul
minating in the annual spring show.
Ballet Folklorico performs a diverse
collection of dances from the different
regions of Mexico. Every region has its
own distinctive dances and unique cos
tumes that are influenced by the re
gion's geography and history. The
group practices about ten dances from
each of ten regions, according to
Ramirez. Members with previous expe
rience in Folklorico share dances with
the group, which allows the group's
repertoire of traditional dances to con
tinue growing.
Since the 1992-1993 school year. Bal
let Folklorico has been an entirely stu
dent-run organization. It is currently
under the direction of sophomore co
chairs Krysti Garcia and Simon Escobe
do. who consider Ballet Folkorico an
important part of their lives.
"BFdeS has been a major part of my
life here at Stanford; as a freshman 1
came in certain that I would join the
folklorico group, and it was one of the
most genuinely welcoming and support
ive experiences I had during my first few
weeks at Stanford," Garcia said.
For the dancers, being part of BFdeS
represents an opportunity to learn
about a culture in addition to the pure
enjoyment of dancing. Folklorico
dance is an exceptionally vibrant and
special example of Mexican culture, ac
cording to Ramirez.
"There's only so much that you can
learn from reading a book," Ramirez
said. "Learning about my culture
through dance is something so beauti
ful, so personal and so unique."
Garcia agreed that Ballet Folklorico
is about more than just the dancing.
"For me. Ballet Folklorico is a per
fect combination of two things I am
passionate about: dancing and culture,"
Garcia said. "It has been a way for me
to rediscover my Mexican heritage as
well as just enjoy dancing."
Ballet Folklorico de Stanford hopes
to continue spreading the word about
Folklorico dance and attracting more
dancers to learn about Mexican culture.
The group collaborates with Mariachi
Cardenal at a number of events, and per
formed with them at their 10th anniver
sary on Saturday. Mariachi Cardenal will
also play at the spring show on Friday.
In addition to its collaboration with
the Mariachi group. Ballet Folklorico
performed at El Centro Chicano's 25th
anniversary and was extremely active
during the week of Cinco de Mayo, per
forming five times. '
While the group is currently well
funded, the future of Ballet Folklorico
at Stanford is not entirely certain. A sig
nificant portion of Ballet Folklorico's
funding this year comes from MEChA
special fees, which will not be available
next year.
Ballet Folklorico uses MEChA spe
cial fees to secure venues for its events,
and, as a result, the location of next
year's spring show is currently uncertain,
according to Ramirez. The group is cur
rently looking into other funding options
so that it can continue to perform its an
nual spring show at Dinkelspiel.
Even with its current funding issues.
Ballet Folklorico is certain to remain an
important part of its current and future
dancers' lives. According to its mem
bers, BFdeS is one of the most impor
tant parts of their Stanford experience.
"I can't imagine life at Stanford
without Ballet Folklorico de Stanford."
said former co-chair Tania Davila, a se
nior. "I'm very thankful to have had the
opportunity to meet such wonderful
people while celebrating my heritage.
It showed me what dedicated individu
als are capable of."
The Bifllet will continue to practice for
the rest of the school year, and rehearsal
and performance schedules are available
on the group's Web site, http://www.stan
ford.edu/group/folklorico.

Eat, drink and be merry
'Edamame for all, and for all a good night'
The first time I saw it, it was magical— the won
derful, beautiful restaurant that was packed
and had crazy lights flashing off and on
throughout the dining area, loud music playing
and people inside looking happy and standing on tables.
I rushed to get a look at its pearly white exterior, to catch
a glimpse of its name embossed in sil
ver letters on the outside: "Miyake."
0000, we thought.
The first time I went there, I was
intrigued. The restaurant just has an
allure to it, so you think you have to
like it. But if you're not in the mood
fora sake bombing adventure or for
actually hearing your friends speak
(because the techno music is boom
ing in the background), then I
wouldn't recommend spending your
money there. The sushi is not what they are famous
for; let's put it that way. And as a sushi lover. I was on
the hunt for the perfect sushi restaurant.
So there's Miyake on one end and Fuki Sushi on the
other. Fuki Sushi has great traditional rolls, a nice
classy atmosphere, but the food is a little overpriced,
and I was a little underwhelmed with the whole experi
ence. I would definitely go there again, but it's not an
everyday outing.
Another higher-end sushi restaurant is Higashi
West. It's a great atmosphere — funky with bamboo
poles stationed throughout the room and generally hip
Japanese accoutrements placed in unsuspecting spots.
And while you're paying for your sushi, trust me, you are
paying for innovation. The white and green of the rice
and nori (seaweed) curls around the bright orange of
mango and the deep pink of smoked salmon.
If you love mango and salmon, Higashi is your spot
(they even use salmon mousse in one role). They also
have interesting rolls with rock shrimp and large crab.
But don't expect your traditional Yellowtail nigiri at
this joint.
The one drawback. I have to say, is that the naiso
soup bowl is extremely large, which in my mind defeats
its purpose. When you are just eating pretty-large size
blocks of tofu and a never-ending stream of seaweed
slivers, the broth just starts to get cold, and 1 start to get
full. Same with the salad — really big plate. So a word of
caution — beware the starter sizes, because they will
fool you.
So with the spectrum of sushi in Palo Alto, where is
the middle ground? I just wanted a good, mid-range,
family-style, busy, cozy sushi restaurant that I could go
to on a Thursday night in my jeans and a sweatshirt and
not break the bank. Why was that missing here?
And then 1 found Naomi (sushi, of course). This
was exactly what I was looking for — as the three of
us sat down on a Saturday night (minimal-to-no
wait), families were surrounding us on all sides (ex
cept for the Stanford lovebirds in the corner holding
hands and staring into each others eyes in the corner
and another group of Cardinal girls that walked in
wearing corsages and prom-style dresses but no
dates. Hmm.)
Colored bottles of sake in various shapes and sizes
lined each wall in several rows, three giant marlins hung
on the wood walls and one of those cliche Japanese blue
cloth curtains hung over the door and by the sushi bar.
Little kids were laughing (sometimes a bit too loudly)
around us, but I can tell you it's way better than pound
ing techno music. It felt homey, it felt like a normal
restaurant that normal people went to when they want
ed sushi. And our meal was good.
We, of course, ordered edamame to start, which was
absolutely delicious. The warm beans were served to us
in pretty servingware — the portion looked small at first,
but even with three people to serve, it definitely lasted
throughout the meal. The miso soup was delicious (and
normal-sized), yet the salad left a bit to be desired. I am
usually obsessed with the Japanese house-salad dressing,
but this one was just so-so. So if you're not dying for it.
you can skip the salad.
The rolls were great, too (not the best of the best, but
pretty darn good). We ordered the sushi tempura roll,
the California roll (the avocado makes up a significant
portion of the fillings — which I love, but if you aren t
an avocado fan. beware), and the tuna roll for the base
taste. And the prices were pretty cheap — six cut rolls
for around $4.00. Three of us ate there for $16 a piece,
and we ate well. They also had full-on meals, with chick
en teriyaki and various other meats on the menu. They
even had mochi.
So lesson learned: The middle road does exist in
Palo Alto, despite the plethora of fast-loody and high
end establishments lining University. 1 know there are
places to get it takeout that are just fine, but if you
want to actually sit down, enjoy the company of your
friends and smell like soy sauce afterwards, try Naomi.
And I bet your neighbors will love you for it. too.
Mmm, soy sauce.
Naomi Sushi is located at 1328 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park.
Higashi West is located at 632 Emerson St., Palo
Alto.
Fuki Sushi is located at 4119 El Camino Real.
Palo Alto.
If you are planning/attending an event where you need
to bust out a prom-like dress (minus any ugly taffeta), in
vite Jennie at jbroder@stanford.edu. She has a whole
closet full of them, and they are getting sad. The luau
themed formal didn 't quite do them justice.
