# Mefford sues again
## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
Junior Dylan Mefford
filed a new Constitutional
Council suit against the
Sixth ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate last night, alleg
ing that the Senate's re
fusal to certify the first ex
ecutive-election results
was unconstitutional. The
recent resignation of three
out of four Council mem
bers, however, throws into
question how the case will
be heard.
The suit, the third
brought by either Mefford
or senior Mikey Lee, has
been reworded in response
to the Council's decision
regarding the second case,
in which the Council ruled
that the language of the
suit did not adequately ad
dress the Senate's decision.
"We based our second
case on the Senate's state
ment as it appeared in The
Daily on May 11," Mefford
said. "Right before the
case was heard, the Senate
changed its official state
ment, making the wording
of our original case not ap
plicable. Now we have the
final, official version of the
Senate's statement, and
we're able to draft a
case accordingly."
The problem, though,
is that the Council can
not currently receive the
case because only has
one member.

"It's just a big, giant
mess," said Council Chair
Bill Curry, a doctoral can
didate in geophysics.
Council member Robert
Rudnitsky, a doctoral can
didate in applied physics,
resigned from the Council
last week. On Sunday, two
other Council members, ju
nior Howie Chiou and
graduate student Monica
Henestroza, declared their
intent to resign as well.
With these departures, the
Council's sole remaining
member would be Curry.
"We do not exist as a body
with quorum," Curry said.
Another difficulty, he
continued, is how to fill the
vacancies in the Council
since the Senate is the re
spondent in the case and
also responsible for con
firming replacements.
"Having respondents
charged with appointing
Council members is not
good, to put it lightly,"
he said.
ASSU President-elect
Chioke Borgelt-Mose, a
sophomore, declined to
comment on the case, cit
ing unfamiliarity of the de
tails of the suit.
Lee, who won the first
executive election with
Mefford, backs the suit, al
though his name is not offi
cially attached.
"I fully support this
third case," he said. "All I
