# the 						U.S. Mexico border

### KENDALL MADDEN GUEST COLUMNIST 
If we feel sick or have an injury, most of
us can make a quick call to the doctor or rush
to a nearby hospital. Access to health care
(we believe) is a problem in developing
countries, not in the United States. Yet after
I attended a presentation by Anthony Islas,
a doctor at a rural health clinic near El Paso,
Texas, the reality that American citizens
and residents all along the U.S.-Mexico bor
der may have exceedingly inadequate
health care became very clear to me.
All along the U.S.-Mexico border, for
100 kilometers on either side, is a unique
region designated the "border zone." Be
neath the official territorial divisions, life
in the borderlands is not easily defined by
which side one might happen to live on.
The border zone is the home of over 12
million people, roughly half on either side.
Many of the cities along the border have
grown up in pairs. On either side, the pop
ulation growth in these cities is rapidly in
creasing, largely due to the draw of the
maquiladoras — large-scale factories that
depend on cheap labor — on the Mexican
side of the border. Additionally, the prox
imity to the United States draws those
whose purpose is immigration.
The cities may be growing in numbers, but
infrastructure development simply cannot
keep up, leading to the growth of colonia
communities The Southwest Center for En
vironmental Research and Policy (SCERP),
a bi-national organization, defines a colonia
as an "unincorporated subdivision along the
border in which one or more of the following
conditions exist: lack of potable water supply
or no water system, lack of an adequate
wastewater system or no wastewater facili
ties, lack of decent, safe and sanitary housing,
inadequate roads and / or inadequate
drainage control structures."
In Islas' clinic, the majority of his patients
are residents of the colonias and of El Paso.
Colonia life, I learned, is discouraging.
Colonias range from essentially squatter
communities to underdeveloped city out
skirts, and they exist on both sides of the
border. The typical colonia house is a self
constructed mismatch of wood, cin
derblocks, cardboard and mobile home
parts. And these people, remember, are
American citizens. They deserve the same
type of healthcare afforded to you and me.
Without running water or sewage sys
tems, water contamination, Islas said, is
one of the primary health concerns for the
colonias. Person-to-person transferable
diseases spread easily through water. The
most common health problem related to
human contamination of water is Hepatitis
A, a viral infection passed through contact
with human fecal matter. In the colonias in
Texas, for example, the incidence of Hep
atitis A is 50.3 percent (compared to the

state incidence rate of 18.3 percent) with
some regions, such as the area surrounding
El Paso, having an incidence rate of 90 per
cent in adults and greater than 30 percent
in elementary school children.
While many bacterial diseases spread
through water contamination are treatable,
if living conditions remain the same, infec
tion and illness will continue to occur, re
ducing quality of life significantly. If un
treated, many of these diseases can be life
threatening, especially for young children
who cannot sustain the water loss of severe
diarrheal diseases.
According to Islas, another significant
barrier to establishing good health care
throughout the colonias is the difficulties
that arise when patients try to see a doctor.
Clinics are sparse, transportation may be an
issue and many people cannot afford to miss
work. Diseases are not treated and there
fore persist and spread quickly. Diseases
which could be cured remain chronic.
Human water contamination is not the
only concern for colonia residents. The colo
nias, particularly on the Mexican side of the
border, rise up near the factories because
they can provide affordable housing for
workers with meager salaries of three to five
dollars a day.
Although the North American Free
Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, contains
provisions for the protection of the envi
ronment and both the United States and
Mexico have their own environmental reg
ulations, in the border zone, these "laws"
are not enforced. Consequently, many of
the colonias become a dumping ground for
the waste of the maquiladoras, and this
waste is quite often toxic. Multiple studies
have found extreme concentrations of car
cinogenic toxins in the soil, air and water
along the border. That the highest concen
trations of some of these toxins are found
in the poorest communities raises impor
tant issues of environmental justice, which,
at the moment, neither country is seri
ously addressing.
Islas' presentation was made to a group
of undergraduates who all shared an inter
est in medicine and health care issues in the
developing world. At the end of his presen
tation, he turned to us and said:
"So, you see you don't have to leave
the country to have a third world experi
ence. It is all right here."
I was humbled, because he was abso
lutely right. I realized that I had been so
anxious to go be a do-gooder someplace
else in the world where "people really
needed me," that 1 had been oblivious to
the needs, the exploitation and injustice
right here in my own country.
