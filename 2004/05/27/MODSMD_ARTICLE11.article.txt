# A
						closer look at your dining hall
## How safe is your Stern meal? The Daily goes behind the doors to find out

vertical. He has stickers that
measure specific temperature
ranges. From simply feeling a
metal can's contours, he can
sniff out botulism. And, to top
it off, he handles issues involv
ing mislabeling.
"If they advertise turtle soup,
and there are no turtles, we have
a problem," Lee noted.
After scurrying through an

Carp all you want about the
edible quality of the fare found
daily in dining halls scattered
across campus. As I've
learned, it's not going to
change anything; not every
meal can be a Bob special din
ner. You can rest assured, how
ever, that the food you're shov
eling down your esophagus is
bacteria-, cockroach- and
mouse-feces-free.
For that, you can thank
Leonard Lee, an older Asian
American gentleman who, last
Friday, was carrying a clipboard
with papers strewn about, a pen
and a photo ID clipped to the
top of his shirt pocket. Accord
ing to his card, Lee bears the title
of Registered Environmental
Health Specialist, from the
County of Santa Clara's Depart
ment of Environmental Health.
And a specialist he is. As an in
dependent inspector, Lee can
strut into any dining hall on cam
pus unannounced and scrutinize
as he pleases.
Today, after folding a sheet
of paper, he estimates exhaust
fan speed by determining the
angle the paper makes with the

eerily quiet Cyber Cafe —
there were no problems — we
found ourselves in the hustle
and-bustle of the cleaning area
in Stern Dining, where
sparkling utensils and plates
were being churned out at a
punishing pace. In the far end
of the room, a cook was han
dling cups from the revolving
tray holder. Right in front of
us, there were three vats of pip

ing-hot, colored liquid: yellow
for washing, blue for waste and
red for sanitation. Lee re
moved the top dish from a
stack and ran it through the
Hobart, the potent sanitizing
machine. With a guttural rum
ble, steam billowing angrily
from all sides, the Hobart spat
the plate out. Lee recorded the
plate's temperature: 198 degrees

" [The food inspector] noted... the mis
placement of chemicals; the spills on the
floor — probably a strawberry-flavored
liquid; and a light that had a cover
missing in the walk-in refrigerator."

Fahrenheit, well above the regu
lation of 170 degrees. Indeed,
the temperatures of all the cui
sine in the refrigerators and hot
areas fell within guideline range
— plus or minus an acceptable
error of two degrees.
Eventually, we made our
way to the storage area. A
man, sweeping up, passed us as
we walked through the en
trance. Lee took a glass con

tainer filled with red sauce, fu
riously shook it, and placed a
flashlight beam directly on its
contents. Observing nothing
unusual, he shone the beam
along the ground. In the cor
ner, there was a glue trap, for
mice and insects that wish to
steal a morsel or two.
"It's good storage — not
crowded, no cross-contamina
tion," Lee said.
Just as we were about to
amble out, however, he saw it.
On the metal shelves, right next
to the bananas, were some char
coal and cans of lighter fluid.
Chemicals and edibles should
never be stored together — bar
becue-flavored fruit, after all,
does not please the palette. Al
though it was a minor infraction,
it was still serious enough to war
rant a creasing of Lee's eye
brows and a quick scribble on
the pad.
The Stern Dining staff, all in
all, was unfailingly polite, most
greeting him with a "Hi Mr.
Lee," or, in what must've been a
case of mistaken identity, a "Hi
Mr. Chang." The student man
ager offered to answer any ques
tions, and Permsuk Lampra
sitipon, the service manager,
nodded attentively as Lee ticked
off suggestions. He noted, in
complete monotone, the mis
placement of the chemicals; the
spills on the floor — probably a
strawberry-flavored liquid; and
a light that had a cover missing in
the walk-in refrigerator. He
wrote in his final report, howev
er, that employee food handling
practices were satisfactory.
"Overall, Stanford dining
has done a good job," Lee said.
He wouldn't reveal the dirti
est dining halls on campus, but
he did note that in his 15 years on
the job, there has never been a
confirmed case of food poison
ing, despite occasional com
plaints. Our dining halls are cer
tainly cleaner than the vast ma
jority of restaurants — which,
Lee states, generally have pris
tine seating facilities, but rela
tively dirty kitchens. And, much
to my mom's dismay, our dining
room at home is probably not
that clean. It is not surprising,
then, that food managers from
all over the country come to see
how our dining halls operate.
Around 11:45 a.m., students,
greeted by a crooner warbling
ballads over the speakers, start
ed trickling into Stern Dining.
Some, in flannels and ratty
shirts, had just gotten up, while
others, with backpacks slung
loosely from their shoulders,
had biked from class. His in
spection complete, Lee, who is
retiring June 6, paid no heed to
them, put his pen away, and,
without looking back, made his
way to the next dining hall.
