# Stanford Students for Choice celebrate May as National Masturbation Month
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
With a smile on her face and condoms
and lollipops in hand to dole out to students
passing through White Plaza, junior Lisa
Diver is actively promoting that students
take a few minutes out of their lives and de
vote more time to ... themselves. Stanford
Students for Choice, a student-run organiza
tion that Diver is involved in, is on an active
campaign to inform students that May is Na
tional Masturbation Month.
The group hosted a "Masturbation Cele
bration" on the Columbae lawn yesterday
evening, an event which featured the band
North of Cuba, as well as informational ta
bles or appearances by student groups such
as the Stanford Democrats, Students for
Kerry and the Sexual Health Peer Resource
Center. The event was also co-sponsored by
KZSU, the campus radio station.
The celebration, while focused on mas
turbation, is part of a larger drive led by
Stanford Students for Choice to increase
awareness about reproductive health and
rights and to protect the rights that previous
generations have tried to hard to gain.
"We are celebrating our sexual health
and reproductive rights through an event
that is both fun and informative," Diver said.
Masturbation has long been regarded as

taboo — in fact, the word "masturbate"
originates from the Latin words "manus,"
meaning hand, and "stuprare," meaning to
defile, demonstrating from the defiling part
of the word that masturbation has long been

associated with shame and uncleanliness.
Some religions demonize the practice,
leading to secrecy and guilt by people who
ascribe to such faiths. Some religious Web
sites such as
http://www.christiananswers.net and
http://www.newjerusalem.com. for exam

pie, point to passages in the scriptures that
condemn the practice.
In addition, most sexual education
courses never cover the topic, so myths
about the practice are never debunked by

health professionals. Teens turn to the
movies, television or magazines instead,
where the information may be more fiction
al or glamorized than hard science. Due to
pressure to keep the word from being ut
tered at schools, health professionals have
had a difficult time introducing masturba

tion education into the curriculum. In the
early '90s, then-Surgeon General Jocelyn
Elders attempted to introduce masturbation
education into the public school sexual edu
cation curriculum, but she was eventually

booted out of her position by her conserva
tive opponents.
Nonetheless, despite the negative soci
etal and religious views regarding masturba
tion, according to recent research, nearly 95
percent of men and 89 percent of women in
the United States reported having mastur

bated at some point in their lives. Doctors
and advocates have deemed it as a com
pletely safe practice (provided that it isn't
overly rough) and some even laud its bene
fits to overall health.
"Masturbation has many health bene
fits," Diver explained. "It can reduce stress,
relieve menstrual cramps and provide an
outlet for sexual urges for those who are not
currently sexually active or who have decid
ed to wait a little longer to have sex."
Additionally, according to medical pro
fessionals at the Sinclair Intimacy Institute,
masturbation can lead couples to have a
more satisfying intimate and sexual relation
ship, as they can effectively communicate
exactly what brings them pleasure. The only
time when masturbation can become un
healthy is when it becomes compulsive. In
such a case, it can be treated as any compul
sive behavior through therapy and / or med
ication.
Stanford Students for Choice is hoping
that through awareness campaigns and
through the "Masturbation Celebration"
students will be more open about the prac
tice and remove the guilt or shame from the
experience, reaping the health benefits and
feeling good about themselves.
Diver added: "We just want people to
love themselves and make themselves
happy."
