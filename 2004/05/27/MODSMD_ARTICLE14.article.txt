# More Council suits will not solve anything

### 
During the ASSU elections, candidates
Mikey Lee and Dylan Mefford bent a
rule by soliciting e-mailed endorse
ments from the Junior and Senior
Class presidents after the campaign deadline
had passed. Since then, the Undergraduate Sen
ate has made one dubious decision after anoth
er, all to the disadvantage of Lee and Mefford.
Understandably, the two candidates feel as
though they have been treated unfairly, and
Mefford's latest appeal to the Constitutional
Council is evidence of his frustration. But by
this point it has become clear that nothing Lee
and Mefford can do will put them in office. It is
time for them to abandon their quest and show
some grace in defeat, no matter how hard that
might be under the circumstances.
We believe the old Senate was wrong in not
certifying Lee and Mefford's victory. The new
Senate was even more clearly wrong in deciding
not to certify even after the old Senate's decision
had been struck down by the Constitutional
Council. But now, a new election has been held,
a new slate was elected, and both the Undergrad
uate Senate and the Graduate Student Council

have certified the new slate's victory. The ASSU
senators never liked Lee and Mefford, and by
now they have shown that they don't have to cer
tify the Lee / Mefford electoral victory if they
don't want to. Any further action on the part of
Lee or Mefford will be fruitless.
It comes down to the fact that the ASSU sen
ators don't have to certify an election by a slate
that they strongly dislike and mistrust, and most
of the members of the Constitutional Council
don't care enough to enforce the constitution
against the Senate's wishes. The recent resigna
tion of all but one member of the Constitution
al Council effectively buried any further cases
from Lee or Mefford because any new members
of the council are supposed to be selected by the
Senate â€” the respondent in said cases. That's
surely difficult for Lee and Mefford to accept,
and many other students on campus share their
anger and dismay. But for Mefford to continue
fighting is not in the best interest of the ASSU
or the student body. It will only draw out the
process and prevent the ASSU from moving on
from this embarrassing and ugly chapter in
its history.
