## My life as a TV show 
### 
So it's almost finals week,
and not only are we all
supposed to be hitting the
books, we are supposed to
like it. There is no doubt that
learning has its benefits, and I
guess you can say that I like to
read, but I must confess that even
more than I appreciate the writ
ten word, I love television. Not
only is it the perfect background
noise and entertainment while I
am cooking, cleaning, calling
home or writing my columns, but
it is also one of my only portals to
the world outside of the Stanford
bubble. Where else can I find out
that Mark Anthony is leaving his
wife for J. Lo, or that American
Idol reject William Hung is set to
be filming his own movie some
time soon?
And while my academic sched
ule of 500 pages of reading per
week doesn't really leave me with
enough time to watch as much
"TRL," "Best Week Ever" and
"South Park" as I would like, I
have found that my own life re
sembles television enough to keep
me satisfied.
No, I'm not talking about my
life as a series of "Girls Gone
Wild" episodes playing on loop.
Instead, I like to think of it as a
cross between "Sex and the City,"
"Dawson's Creek" and "Saved by
the Bell." And I'm sure that right
now, someone is rolling his eyes at
me, but who hasn't ever referred to
one of their friends as the "Saman
tha" of the group, wondered if
their childhood best friend would
turn out to be their soul mate a la

Joey and Dawson or dreamed of
hanging out in Dean Mamlet's of
fice like Zack Morris and company
did with Mr. Belding?
My fantasies of life as a televi
sion show all started sometime
last year during a series of daily
coffee dates with my best friend

Karen. I never
made a con
scious decision
to start refer
ring to myself
as the main
character of my
own dramedy,
but each of my
coffee / chat

dates would last about half an
hour and consist of more than
enough sex, gossip and violence
to make Entertainment Week
ly's top-10 list of shows on a reg
ular basis. It didn't take long to
realize that these conversations
had a supporting cast (friends,
boyfriends, housemates, etc.),
guest stars (random hookups,
professors, TAs and the like) and
certain voice-only characters that
appeared on my show via tele
phone (family and friends from
back home).
On especially exciting weeks
riddled with breakups, cat fights,
first kisses and the arrival of care
packages to my P.O. box, I tend to
think it is sweeps week, and that
my show is vying for the greatest
number of viewers possible. And,
during weeks like this one when
most of my time is spent sitting at
my computer or standing in front
my freezer eating Haagen-Dazs

right out of the pint, I figure that
the show must be on that late
night cable access channel that
only the most desperate of insom
niacs watch.
Sure, my low-budget show
lacks a certain Hollywood flair
and could benefit from the use of
professional lighting, glamorous
wardrobe selections and the likes
of Justin Timberlake and Brad
Pitt as guest stars. But I can still
guarantee my audience the bare
necessities of background music
(courtesy of my MP3 collection)
and a narrative voice-over to rival
that of Carrie Bradshaw.
Since I can't put my life on hia
tus for the necessary breaks of a
television series, 1 like to think
that my viewers are getting the
benefit of a show without reruns
(like a soap opera, but thankfully
less trashy). Basically, seasons
start and end at random accord
ing to significant changes in my
life. And so, as this year is coming
to a close, I like to think that
viewers are sitting on to edge of
their seats guessing the answers
to this season finale's cliffhang
ers: Will Athalie stay in Califor
nia or go to New York this sum
mer? Will she drop out of school
before exams are over? Will
Daily readers ever see another
one of her columns again? Who
knows . . . just stay tuned.

Want a guest spot on Athalie La
guerre's imaginary show? Send
her an e-mail at athalie@stan
ford.edu and she will try to write
you in.
