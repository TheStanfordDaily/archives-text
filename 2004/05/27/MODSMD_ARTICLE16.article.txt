## Reality TV: Stanford Superstar 
### 
I've always suspected that
ninety-percent of our current
infatuation with reality tele
vision is based entirely on the
most dependable human emotion:
cattiness. Sure, on some level peo
ple probably appreciate the human
drama and tension inherent in
many of these programs. On a
much more real level, however, I
think people love watching a bunch
of twenty-somethings who make
Gomer Pyle look like Stephen
Hawking playing grab-ass on na
tional television.
To date, most of these shows
have come up with some innocent
premise for getting a bunch of brain
donors to prance around like ba
boons on speed; anything from liv
ing on a desert island to finding the
spouse of your dreams will suffice.
It is with great glee, however, that I
report the WB has finally decided
to drop all pretenses and commence
humiliating its unwitting contes
tants with unfettered enthusiasm.
Ladies and gentleman, it is with
sublime pleasure that I introduce
you to the newest deity in the pan
theon of Reality Television — Su
perstar USA.
I'm sure most of you are familiar
with Fox's hit show, "American
Idol," where contestants compete for
the title of best performer and win a
lucrative record deal. Contestants on
Superstar USA think that they are
the newest contestants on an Ameri
can Idol knockoff. The delightful re
ality of this situation, however, is that
they are in fact in the running to be
crowned the worst performer in the
nation. You read that right: A panel
of B-list celebrities will let horrific
crooners advance while sending
lovely songbirds packing, all without
letting any of the competitors in on

the malevolent fun.
To truly understand how fun this
idea can be, you have to tune in to the
WB on Mondays and Tuesdays at 9
p.m. There's just a certain schaden
freude gained from watching that can
not be given justice in the number of
words I am allotted. However, if that
time slot doesn't work for you, take
heart — you can find pathetic perfor
mances masquerading as genuine ef
forts all around you. Without further
ado, 1 bring to you the 2004 version of
Stanford Superstar:
Contestant one: The ASSU elec
tion
In this superstar competition, 1
think the ASSU is probably the one
closest to realizing that it is all a
sham. In the recent elections contro
versies, you know these senators had
to realize how ridiculous the whole
process was getting, and yet they
were powerless to do anything but
keep on going. Because of this, it's
hard not to feel a little sympathy for
the guys. Still, this is an organization
that makes the Keystone Cops look
like Delta Force. The real losers here
are the ones that are going to have to
serve next year in a body that has all
the perceived legitimacy of a cage of
baboons. I'd feel pretty sorry for
them if it all weren't so damned
funny.
Contestant two: Dead Week
How many of you, fresh off vis
iting East Coast schools with a real
reading period, were excited about
the prospect of a week with noth
ing to do but study and play in the
California sunshine? Keep your
hands up if you were devastated
when you learned that Dead Week
was just another Stanford code
word, apparently meaning "week
where teachers who didn't plan
their syllabuses dump half a quar

ter's worth of work on unsuspect
ing undergrads." Hey, at least this
quarter the administration basical
ly drops the pretense and gives a
"dead day". Here's to hoping that
twenty-four hours with no new ma
terial will give me solace as I'm
twisting in my straitjacket, bab
bling about term papers and take
home finals.
Contestant three: Bike ticketers
I can't even imagine how this job
is done with a straight face. I can
only imagine the thought process
goes something like this, "Sure,
East Palo Alto is infamous for hav
ing the highest per capita murder
rate in the country. But that's just
murder. Who did murder ever hurt?
People are riding bicycles at dusk
without lights. Swarm!" I bet these
are the encounters that little kids
dreaming of becoming policeman
salivate over.
And your winner is . . . the
ASSU. Give them a hand, guys.
Sure, everyone slips up now and
then, but you really have to appre
ciate this kind of silliness day in
and day out. Anytime the popular
favorite in an election is a moun
tain lion, you know a government
has really captured the hearts and
minds of the people. Here's look
ing to next year when a codfish and
bike light win the popular election,
but aren't confirmed when the
campus is rocked by rumors of
election misconduct involving un
solicited e-mails to the "Cooking
with Cod" listserve.

Benjamin Daniel is a sophomore ma
joring in mathematics. He has recent
ly learned that he is a contestant on the
WB's newest program, "Super-
Columnist. " E-mail your congratula
tions to hmdaniel@stanford.edu.

theon of Reality Television — Su
perstar USA.
I'm sure most of you are familiar
with Fox's hit show, "American
Idol," where contestants compete for
the title of best performer and win a
lucrative record deal. Contestants on
Superstar USA think that they are
the newest contestants on an Ameri
can Idol knockoff. The delightful re
ality of this situation, however, is that
they are in fact in the running to be
crowned the worst performer in the
nation. You read that right: A panel
of B-list celebrities will let horrific
crooners advance while sending
lovely songbirds packing, all without
letting any of the competitors in on

the malevolent fun.
To truly understand how fun this
idea can be, you have to tune in to the
WB on Mondays and Tuesdays at 9
p.m. There's just a certain schaden
freude gained from watching that can
not be given justice in the number of
words I am allotted. However, if that
time slot doesn't work for you, take
heart — you can find pathetic perfor
mances masquerading as genuine ef
forts all around you. Without further
ado, 1 bring to you the 2004 version of
Stanford Superstar:
Contestant one: The ASSU elec
tion
In this superstar competition, 1
think the ASSU is probably the one
closest to realizing that it is all a
sham. In the recent elections contro
versies, you know these senators had
to realize how ridiculous the whole
process was getting, and yet they
were powerless to do anything but
keep on going. Because of this, it's
hard not to feel a little sympathy for
the guys. Still, this is an organization
that makes the Keystone Cops look
like Delta Force. The real losers here
are the ones that are going to have to
serve next year in a body that has all
the perceived legitimacy of a cage of
baboons. I'd feel pretty sorry for
them if it all weren't so damned
funny.
Contestant two: Dead Week
How many of you, fresh off vis
iting East Coast schools with a real
reading period, were excited about
the prospect of a week with noth
ing to do but study and play in the
California sunshine? Keep your
hands up if you were devastated
when you learned that Dead Week
was just another Stanford code
word, apparently meaning "week
where teachers who didn't plan
their syllabuses dump half a quar

ter's worth of work on unsuspect
ing undergrads." Hey, at least this
quarter the administration basical
ly drops the pretense and gives a
"dead day". Here's to hoping that
twenty-four hours with no new ma
terial will give me solace as I'm
twisting in my straitjacket, bab
bling about term papers and take
home finals.
Contestant three: Bike ticketers
I can't even imagine how this job
is done with a straight face. I can
only imagine the thought process
goes something like this, "Sure,
East Palo Alto is infamous for hav
ing the highest per capita murder
rate in the country. But that's just
murder. Who did murder ever hurt?
People are riding bicycles at dusk
without lights. Swarm!" I bet these
are the encounters that little kids
dreaming of becoming policeman
salivate over.
And your winner is . . . the
ASSU. Give them a hand, guys.
Sure, everyone slips up now and
then, but you really have to appre
ciate this kind of silliness day in
and day out. Anytime the popular
favorite in an election is a moun
tain lion, you know a government
has really captured the hearts and
minds of the people. Here's look
ing to next year when a codfish and
bike light win the popular election,
but aren't confirmed when the
campus is rocked by rumors of
election misconduct involving un
solicited e-mails to the "Cooking
with Cod" listserve.

joring in mathematics. He has recent

WB's newest program, "Super-

I've always suspected that
ninety-percent of our current
infatuation with reality tele
vision is based entirely on the
most dependable human emotion:
cattiness. Sure, on some level peo
ple probably appreciate the human
drama and tension inherent in
many of these programs. On a
much more real level, however, I
think people love watching a bunch
of twenty-somethings who make
Gomer Pyle look like Stephen
Hawking playing grab-ass on na
tional television.
To date, most of these shows
have come up with some innocent
premise for getting a bunch of brain
donors to prance around like ba
boons on speed; anything from liv
ing on a desert island to finding the
spouse of your dreams will suffice.
It is with great glee, however, that I
report the WB has finally decided
to drop all pretenses and commence
humiliating its unwitting contes
tants with unfettered enthusiasm.
Ladies and gentleman, it is with
sublime pleasure that I introduce
you to the newest deity in the pan
theon of Reality Television — Su
perstar USA.
