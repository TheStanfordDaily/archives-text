AASA Fashion Show enforced
negative stereotypes
The clothes were made by Asian
Americans. The models were Asian
American. The music was — con
trary to expectation — predomi
nantly mainstream, hip-hop smash
hits featuring talented black or
white vocalists. To have used origi
nal beats by Asian American musi
cians would have somehow been too
ordinary or lackluster for last Fri
day's 12th annual Asian American
Students' Association (AASA)
Fashion Show, appropriately enti
tled "Defying Expect Asians."
Nor was the music the only ex
pectation defied by the fashion
show. One might expect the
women of the show to address the
current state of objectification of
Asian American women in
today's media and society. My ex
pectations were completely and
utterly shattered.
Beautiful Oriental women strut
ted sexily down the catwalk, inspir
ing lusty roars of appreciation and
no lack of gawking from the men in
the audience. Their girlfriends
cheered them on as they hit each
pose — sassy or dainty as they saw
fit, but always displaying a generous
helping of leg and thigh. During the
dance numbers, sexy Asian mamas
shook their booty and rolled their
hips like there was no tomorrow; the
hot, sweaty air was thick with wolf
whistles, heavy panting and screams

of adulation.
The fashion show's Web site
(http://www.stanford.edu/group
/AASA/fashion.htm) states, "Our
objective is to break stereotypes, to
redefine perceptions of beauty and
style." Tragically ironic and wholly
unexpected, the fashion show did
everything it could to reinforce a
stereotype of the Asian woman as a
beautiful, sexualized object to be
displayed for visual consumption.
Not to be outdone, the male
models defied all our expectations
that they would appear as geeky,
nerdy, William Hung look-alikes.
Instead, they flaunted their hyper
masculinity, exemplified by their
"hard" and manly poses. More
often than not, the male models de
fined their masculinity by dancing
suggestively behind women in un
subtle spectacles of dry humping,
doing their part to empower their
female counterparts.
Even the clothing defied expecta
tions. One might expect that Filipino
models would showcase the Pinoy
wear line of clothing, front and cen
ter. Not surprisingly, no one was in
terested in meeting expectations. In
stead, the majority of models domi
nating the catwalk were East Asian,
perfectly justified in sporting Pinoy
wear, while showing precious little
concern or respect for the fact that
Filipinos are one of the most under
represented Asian American ethnic
groups on campus. Hell, I won't bat
an eye the next time I see Kate Moss

modeling for FUBU.
You might even expect that a
charity event, as the AASA fashion
show was billed, would make more
money than it cost to produce.
Wrong again: The fashion show took
in less revenue than its cost. The
money that went to the beneficiary
(upward of $3,000 donated to the
Garment Workers' Center in Los
Angeles) was effectively paid for out
of AASA's pocket.
Sarcasm aside, the fashion show,
as AASA's flagship event of spring
quarter, was a sad and disturbing af
fair. The true cost of the event was
not the amount of money spent on it,
but the cost incurred upon the com
munity by the objectification of and
the disrespect for its own members.
Next year, the AASA fashion show
cannot happen in the way it has this
year and in years past. There is great
potential for the fashion show to be a
positive, community-building event,
and AASA needs to consider care
fully what changes must be made to
realize this potential.

Pencavel needs to prove his
dedication to labor
Professor John Pencavel's de
scription of the 1979 Chilean Labor
Code ("Op-ed misrepresented
profs work in Chile," May 24) once
again overlooks some key aspects of

the Code, specifically in the context
of the Pinochet dictatorship. While I
can accept that many of our dis
agreements stem from political dif
ferences, the fact that these reforms
were enacted in the context of (and
helped to uphold) a military dicta
torship is what makes them unequiv
ocally wrong.
The Pinochet regime was far from
the "hands-off," nonpartisan gov
ernment that Pencavel took for
granted in his ideal model. Under
Pinochet, labor organizers were ar
rested, tortured and murdered. Giv
ing Pencavel the benefit of the
doubt, I will assume that this was not
part of his intention. But if he sought
to create a system composed of a
neutral state and an equal footing for
unions and employers, then he
should be appalled at how his work
was used in Chile.
Pencavel also states that he "ap
plaudfs] a vigorous and robust labor
movement in which the locus of au
thority is the workplace." Although
a workplace-centered union might
be effective in a large factory with
skilled workers, prohibiting organi
zation by trade or industry greatly
disempowers unspecialized workers
in more fragmented sectors.
Chile is an excellent case-in
point: The decentralized unionism
provided for under the Labor Code
did not result in a stronger say for
workers, as was demonstrated by the
many unsuccessful workplace-level
strikes. (I'm sure that these workers

would appreciate Pencavel's ap
plause, but such head-patting does
not put food on the table.)
Finally, a clarification: When I
referred in my original op-ed
("Prof's work in Chile wasn't be
nign," May 17) to the 60-day strike
limit, in fact 1 was not alluding to
the use of "scabs," but rather I was
indicating a far harsher form of ter
minating a strike. Under the 1979
law, workers were considered to
have "voluntarily resigned" after
60 days if a strike was not settled.
Thus, if a settlement was not
reached, the strike was ended by
firing all participants. And while
the policy restricting the use of
scabs may seem liberal compared
to U.S. law, the Chilean law dif
fered in enough other aspects so as
to render the strike mechanism ex
tremely weak — according to Prof.
William B. Gould's 1980 article on
the subject, "This limited protec
tion from strikebreakers is rela
tively academic" ("Chile courts
world opinion," Commonweal,
Feb. 29,1980).
The Chilean Labor Code of 1979
served as a fig leaf to cover up the
state's repressive, anti-union prac
tices. And though I sincerely hope
that I am mistaken, I have little rea
son to believe that the committee
that John Pencavel co-chairs is more
than a fig leaf over Stanford's cur
rent unjust labor practices.
I commend Stanford's labor ac
tivists for their patience and good

faith over the past year, but judging
by President Hennessy's hand
picked advisors and their lack of
progress to date, I see little reason to
believe that the administration has
any intention of implementing a
more ethical labor policy. It is up to
Pencavel and his President's Advi
sory Committee on Labor Practices
to prove me wrong.

Ethics panel participant clarifies his
stance on newspaper advertising
Although I think Michael Miller
did a good job reporting on the panel
discussion on ethics in advertising,
his lead paragraph misrepresented
my position. I certainly never said
that the "Daily should only run ad
vertisements that encourage dia
logue." I expressly excluded from
my comments any reference to ad
vertisements of products and ser
vices and focused instead on "advo
cacy" ads (i.e., ads intended to ex
press a point of view on an issue of
public concern).
Within that very narrow cate
gory of advertising, I suggested
that The Daily, like other newspa
pers, had a responsibility to steer
clear of pernicious speech that was
more likely to close down, rather
than contribute to, public debate
and discussion.

day's 12th annual Asian American
Students' Association (AASA)
Fashion Show, appropriately enti

Nor was the music the only ex
pectation defied by the fashion
show. One might expect the
women of the show to address the
current state of objectification of
Asian American women in
today's media and society. My ex
pectations were completely and
utterly shattered.
Beautiful Oriental women strut
ted sexily down the catwalk, inspir
ing lusty roars of appreciation and
no lack of gawking from the men in
the audience. Their girlfriends
cheered them on as they hit each
pose — sassy or dainty as they saw
fit, but always displaying a generous
helping of leg and thigh. During the
dance numbers, sexy Asian mamas
shook their booty and rolled their
hips like there was no tomorrow; the
hot, sweaty air was thick with wolf

of adulation.
The fashion show's Web site
(http://www.stanford.edu/group

unexpected, the fashion show did
everything it could to reinforce a
stereotype of the Asian woman as a
beautiful, sexualized object to be
displayed for visual consumption.
Not to be outdone, the male
models defied all our expectations
that they would appear as geeky,
nerdy, William Hung look-alikes.
Instead, they flaunted their hyper
masculinity, exemplified by their
"hard" and manly poses. More
often than not, the male models de
fined their masculinity by dancing
suggestively behind women in un
subtle spectacles of dry humping,
doing their part to empower their
female counterparts.
Even the clothing defied expecta
tions. One might expect that Filipino
models would showcase the Pinoy
wear line of clothing, front and cen
ter. Not surprisingly, no one was in
terested in meeting expectations. In
stead, the majority of models domi
nating the catwalk were East Asian,
perfectly justified in sporting Pinoy
wear, while showing precious little
concern or respect for the fact that
Filipinos are one of the most under
represented Asian American ethnic
groups on campus. Hell, I won't bat

You might even expect that a
charity event, as the AASA fashion

money than it cost to produce.
Wrong again: The fashion show took
in less revenue than its cost. The
money that went to the beneficiary
(upward of $3,000 donated to the

of AASA's pocket.
Sarcasm aside, the fashion show,

Next year, the AASA fashion show

Pencavel needs to prove his
dedication to labor
Professor John Pencavel's de
scription of the 1979 Chilean Labor
Code ("Op-ed misrepresented
profs work in Chile," May 24) once
again overlooks some key aspects of

the Code, specifically in the context
of the Pinochet dictatorship. While I
can accept that many of our dis
agreements stem from political dif
ferences, the fact that these reforms
were enacted in the context of (and
helped to uphold) a military dicta
torship is what makes them unequiv
ocally wrong.
The Pinochet regime was far from
the "hands-off," nonpartisan gov
ernment that Pencavel took for
granted in his ideal model. Under
Pinochet, labor organizers were ar
rested, tortured and murdered. Giv
ing Pencavel the benefit of the
doubt, I will assume that this was not
part of his intention. But if he sought
to create a system composed of a
neutral state and an equal footing for
unions and employers, then he
should be appalled at how his work
was used in Chile.
Pencavel also states that he "ap
plaudfs] a vigorous and robust labor
movement in which the locus of au
thority is the workplace." Although
a workplace-centered union might
be effective in a large factory with
skilled workers, prohibiting organi
zation by trade or industry greatly
disempowers unspecialized workers
in more fragmented sectors.
Chile is an excellent case-in
point: The decentralized unionism
provided for under the Labor Code
did not result in a stronger say for
workers, as was demonstrated by the
many unsuccessful workplace-level
strikes. (I'm sure that these workers

would appreciate Pencavel's ap
plause, but such head-patting does
not put food on the table.)
Finally, a clarification: When I
referred in my original op-ed
("Prof's work in Chile wasn't be
nign," May 17) to the 60-day strike
limit, in fact 1 was not alluding to
the use of "scabs," but rather I was
indicating a far harsher form of ter
minating a strike. Under the 1979
law, workers were considered to
have "voluntarily resigned" after
60 days if a strike was not settled.
Thus, if a settlement was not
reached, the strike was ended by
firing all participants. And while
the policy restricting the use of
scabs may seem liberal compared
to U.S. law, the Chilean law dif
fered in enough other aspects so as
to render the strike mechanism ex
tremely weak — according to Prof.
William B. Gould's 1980 article on
the subject, "This limited protec
tion from strikebreakers is rela
tively academic" ("Chile courts
world opinion," Commonweal,
Feb. 29,1980).
The Chilean Labor Code of 1979
served as a fig leaf to cover up the
state's repressive, anti-union prac
tices. And though I sincerely hope
that I am mistaken, I have little rea
son to believe that the committee
that John Pencavel co-chairs is more
than a fig leaf over Stanford's cur
rent unjust labor practices.

faith over the past year, but judging

did not result in a stronger say for
workers, as was demonstrated by the
many unsuccessful workplace-level
strikes. (I'm sure that these workers

would appreciate Pencavel's ap
plause, but such head-patting does
not put food on the table.)
Finally, a clarification: When I
referred in my original op-ed
("Prof's work in Chile wasn't be
nign," May 17) to the 60-day strike
limit, in fact 1 was not alluding to
the use of "scabs," but rather I was
indicating a far harsher form of ter
minating a strike. Under the 1979
law, workers were considered to
have "voluntarily resigned" after
60 days if a strike was not settled.
Thus, if a settlement was not
reached, the strike was ended by
firing all participants. And while
the policy restricting the use of
scabs may seem liberal compared
to U.S. law, the Chilean law dif
fered in enough other aspects so as
to render the strike mechanism ex
tremely weak — according to Prof.
William B. Gould's 1980 article on
the subject, "This limited protec
tion from strikebreakers is rela
tively academic" ("Chile courts
world opinion," Commonweal,
Feb. 29,1980).
The Chilean Labor Code of 1979
served as a fig leaf to cover up the
state's repressive, anti-union prac
tices. And though I sincerely hope
that I am mistaken, I have little rea
son to believe that the committee
that John Pencavel co-chairs is more
than a fig leaf over Stanford's cur
rent unjust labor practices.
I commend Stanford's labor ac
tivists for their patience and good

faith over the past year, but judging
by President Hennessy's hand
picked advisors and their lack of
progress to date, I see little reason to
believe that the administration has
any intention of implementing a
more ethical labor policy. It is up to
Pencavel and his President's Advi
sory Committee on Labor Practices
to prove me wrong.

Ethics panel participant clarifies his
stance on newspaper advertising
Although I think Michael Miller
did a good job reporting on the panel
discussion on ethics in advertising,
his lead paragraph misrepresented
my position. I certainly never said
that the "Daily should only run ad
vertisements that encourage dia
logue." I expressly excluded from
my comments any reference to ad
vertisements of products and ser
vices and focused instead on "advo
cacy" ads (i.e., ads intended to ex
press a point of view on an issue of
public concern).
Within that very narrow cate
gory of advertising, I suggested
that The Daily, like other newspa
pers, had a responsibility to steer
clear of pernicious speech that was
more likely to close down, rather
than contribute to, public debate
and discussion.
