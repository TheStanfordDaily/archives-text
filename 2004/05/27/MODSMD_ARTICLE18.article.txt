## Luck of the Lakers gets Emily down 
### 
Just over two weeks ago, with the San An
tonio Spurs up 2-0 on the Los Angeles Lak
ers, anyone who thought they knew any
thing about sports — yours truly included —
had the Spurs bringing home back-to-back
NBA Championships. But I guess there's a rea
son why these teams actually play the remaining
games.
Somewhere between Kobe's trips to Eagle
County and Shaquille O'Neal's step-father call
ing for the Diesel to get the ball every trip down
the floor, the Lakers turned a complete 180 and
managed to win four straight to advance to the
Western Conference Finals. Now the media's
higher on the Lakers than Ozzy Osbourne is
after a night of post-concert partying.
But is L.A.'s current euphoria over its
team of Hall of Fame bound mercenaries

really warranted?
While most of the media is
ready to hand over the Larry
O'Brien Trophy on a silver plat
ter to Kobe and Shaq . . . again,
it seems like the path they took
to get there involved more than
just your usual amount of
Championship-run luck. But
isn't that the way it always is for
the Lakers?
Had the Lakers not been
playing against a team with liter-

ally zero playoff experience in the first round,
they would have almost certainly been knocked
out by the Houston Rockets —or at least
pushed to seven. Two of the Lakers' first-round
wins came by four points or less after the Rock
ets had late-game leads.
If Houston hadn't been led by the ill-advised
crunch-time shots of Stevie "You're an idiot if
you try to build a franchise around a scoring
point guard" Francis, they would almost cer
tainly have given the then-hapless Lakers more
of a battle.
If the Lakers hadn't been so insanely lucky
that Kobe's trey at the end of Game One
missed by so much that it went right into the
hands of Shaq fora dunk, things might have
been different.
And L.A. was flat-out floundering at the start
of the second round series. The Lakers made
Tony Parker look so good in the first two games
of the series that announcers were proclaiming
him the best point guard in the NBA. Parker
may be one of the most fun players to watch, but
there's no way he's the best point guard in the
NBA. When he learns to shoot a jumper, then
he'll reach the upper-echelon of point guards,
but even then, let's not forget about Jason Kidd
and Stephon Marbury.
And while a lot of things can be said about
the Lakers — too old, too many egos, too many
legal problems — you can't say that they're not
smart. Despite Gary Payton being more "loose
fitting mitten" than "glove" and Derek Fisher
flat-out sucking at defense, Phil Jackson found a
way to shut down Parker.
Even with a wallowing Tony Parker, the
Spurs hadn't lost yet. It wasn't until Game Five
that the tables really turned.
It's nearly impossible for the visiting team to
win in the Staples Center — unless they're play
ing the Clippers — so a tied series heading back
to San Antonio wasn't all that surprising. And
by that same token, as the conference finals
have shown, Minnesota will need a miracle to
win a single game in L.A.
But Game Five is where the Lakers went
from band of ego-driven maniacs to team of
destiny. There is absolutely no way L.A. should
have gotten out of there with a win after Tim
Duncan's apparent heroics.
But someone out there appears to be on
the side of the Lakers. Why anyone would
want Karl Malone to win a championship is
entirely beyond me, but at the rate things are
going, and with the luck of the Lakers, it
seems almost inevitable.
So screw Luck of the Irish. Try Luck of the
Lakers. I'm half-Irish and I've never gotten half
as lucky as those fools in purple and gold. Insert
obvious sexual joke here.
In what world would a guy like Derek Fisher
save the day? And it's not like the Lakers are to
tally foreign to these events that can only be de
scribed as acts of God — or more likely Satan.
I'm sure Vlade Divac hasn't forgotten Robert
Horry's miracle in the Western Conference Fi
nals two years ago. The Lakers are the epitome
of "lucky bastards."
Now the Lakers may be lucky to be where
they are in this year's playoffs, but unfortunate
ly for the rest of the basketball world, that's
when they seem to be at their best — and, down
2-1, the Minnesota Timberwolves are just start
ing to figure that out.
While Minny's doing a decent job on Kobe,
its main scoring threat, one Kevin Garnett,
can't get inside because of the Big Aristotle
and Karl Malone is looking as fresh as a 10-
year NBA veteran.
So unless Wally Szczerbiak and Trenton
Hassell are ready to sell their souls to the devil
like Fish and Big Shot Rob must have, Mr. MVP
and the rest of the Wolves aren't going to have
much time left on court this year. It's not like
he'd be able to score against Detroit, anyway.
