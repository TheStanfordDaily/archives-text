# Card heads to Regionals
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEk SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It has been a banner year for
the Stanford women's track and
field program. Despite a few
bumps along way, the Cardinal
has produced nine school records,
including redshirt sophomore
Alicia Craig's 10,000-meter colle
giate record at the Cardinal Invi
tational.
At the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships, the young Stan
ford squad finished second to
UCLA for the second year in a
row despite scoring a school
record 153 points.
Entering the NCAA West Re
gional Championships at Cal
State-Northridge, the Cardinal
women will begin their quest fora
top-five finish at the National
Championships to be held in
Austin, Texas, by qualifying as
many women as possible out of
the region.
Unlike the Pac-10 Champi
onships, the team component of
the meet will be de-emphasized
by the Cardinal in order to get
athletes qualified for nationals,
but the squad should still remain
in contention for the West Re
gional title.
To qualify for nationals, the in
dividual women must place in the
top five at the regional champi
onships. Then, there will also be
approximately seven athletes
who have not qualified chosen at
large based on times they ran dur
ing the season.
For relay teams, the top three
from each region qualify, while
approximately seven at-large se
lections will be made.
With several women in con
tention to bring home regional ti
tles and many more in position to
qualify for nationals, the women
are set up to score big points and
challenge Pac-10 rivals UCLA
and Southern California and re
gional rival Brigham Young for
the West crown.
After besting USC's Lele
Crawford and UCLA's Jessica
Crosby at the Pac-10 Champi
onships, senior Jill Camarena is
not only a favorite for the region
title but also the NCAA title. As
the top-ranked shot-put thrower
in the nation, Camarena has little
pressure on her â€” even if she
fails to reach the top five, she
would still earn a berth to nation
als during at-large selections.
This may allow Camarena to
push her upper-limits and take
risks in her throws in an attempt
to hit the Olympic "A" standard

of 60 feet, 10.5 inches.
Craig and junior Sara Bei will
be a dangerous duo for the Cardi
nal in the 5,000. They hold the top
two times in the region and fin
ished first and third a year ago.
Their closest competitor is
BYU's Laura Turner, who is
seeded over 30 seconds slower.
After a heart-breaking, 0.01-
second loss to USC's Iryna
Vashchuk in the 1,500 at the Pac
-10 Championships, freshman Ari
Lambie looks to rebound and
challenge both Vashchuk and
Northern Arizona's Johanna
Nilsson for the regional title and
punch her ticket to Austin.
Two weeks after lowering the
school record in the 400 by nearly
a second at Pac-lOs, sophomore
Nashonme Johnson, who quali
fied to the NCA As last year in the
200, is in contention fora berth
again this year. In challenging
UCLA's Monique Henderson,
who is currently ranked third in
the nation, Johnson may be on
track for another record-setting
outing.
Freshman Janice Davis may be
Stanford's first qualifier in the
100 since Chryste Gaines in 1992.
Her time of 11.54 set at the Pac-10
Championships two weeks ago
ties Gaines' freshman school
record and is fifth in the region.
Davis is also ranked fifth in the
200.
After a 2-3 finish in the B*X) at
the Pac-10 Championships, tresh
man Ashley Freeman and sopho
more Chinny Offor are in posi
tion to earn spots at nationals.
They are fifth and second in the
region, respectively, while Offor
is currently ranked 19th in the na
tion.
Both relay squads appear
poised to qualify for nationals as
well. The lOth-ranked 400-meter
and the llth-ranked 1,600-meter
relay squads should earn at-large
berths even if they fail to qualify
through one of the region's spots.
But it should not come to that as
both squads are ranked in the top
three in the region and are con
tenders for the title, along with
USC, UCLA and California.
In the jumps, junior Undine
Becker has the third-best mark in
the region and is ranked 20th in
the nation. The reigning regional
runner-up will take on rivals
Beckham of UCLA and Michelle
Sanford of USC in a quest to re
turn to nationals. Becker is also
entered in the triple jump.

al after strong performances at Pac-10 Championships.
There are also several athletes
in who are poised to qualify across

Anderson, as well as 2003 NCAA
runner-up Ida Nilsson of Northern
Arizona.
