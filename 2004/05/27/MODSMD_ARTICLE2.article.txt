# Rally blasts labor policies
## 
### MELANIE CORBETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Almost 200 members of the
Stanford community gathered in
White Plaza yesterday demand
ing a code of conduct ensuring
the fair treatment of Stanford
employees. The rally was orga
nized by the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition (SLAC) and in
cluded student activists, Stanford
employees and campus perform
ing groups, all urging the Univer
sity to amend its labor policies.
SLAC members highlighted
problems with Stanford's current
labor situation. According to
SLAC, these include the fact that
many of the University's tempo
rary employees work just as hard
as regular employees yet receive
lower wages. At the Stanford

Linear Accelerator Center (also
referred to as SLAC), long-time
temporary guest house employ
ees were dismissed from their
jobs when they requested per
manent worker status, said
SLAC members.
Protestors also noted that the
wage received by many Stanford
employees is far below the living
wage of Santa Clara County.
Several workers earn $6.75 per
hour, compared to the $13.36
that the California Budget Pro
ject for the county estimates as
the living wage.
SLAC members said that the
adoption of its proposed code of
conduct would remedy these
problems. Among its goals are
equal wages for equal work, in
cluding part-time, temporary
and subcontracted employees,

reaching a real living wage, mak
ing healthcare affordable, in
creasing availability of educa
tional opportunities to workers
and allowing employees to par
ticipate in unions.
"The Code of Conduct would
be a lot better in action than sit
ting here in my hands," said
SLAC member Molly Goldberg,
a junior. "Next year, we want
things implemented; if they're
not, let's get ready fora fight."
Part of the program included a
fast in which over 150 people
pledged to deny themselves food
for the entire day. A strand of
cards containing the names of
people who committed to the ab
stention hung in front of the Bird
Cage, and several students in

volved wore shirts communicating
their decision to fast. On the front
was a clenched fist evoking the need
for action, and on the hack was the
phrase, "Code of Conduct Now!"
The intention of this year's 24-
hour hunger strike was both to push
fora University Code of Conduct
and to commemorate last year's
larger-scale fast for the same cause.
"One year ago today, six students
fasted for seven days, yet we have
had no progress," said senior Scott
Stillman. "In honor of last year, this
is a one-day fast for labor justice."
The fasting students had lost

roughly 10 pounds each last year
when the University finally inter
vened and agreed to create a com
mittee dedicated to Stanford labor
issues. The Presidential Advisory
Committee on Labor consisted of
three faculty members, three ad
ministrators, three workers and
three students.
Although it was the first time in
that President John Hennessy
agreed to include students and
workers, SLAC members said that
they were not satisfied with the
group's work.
"The problem is the way that
Hennessy set up the committee from
day one," said SLAC member Jenny
Zhao, a freshman. "Not a single low
wage worker is on it, and.in spite of
the fact that four of the five nomi
nated students were involved in
SLAC, none of them were selected
to participate on the committee."

During the rally, members of
SLAC noted that while the commit
tee was set to meet in the fall, it did
not actually meet until January.
They felt that the group has not ef
fectively worked toward granting
proper validation of workers.
"SLAC trusted that Hennessy
would [make progress], but he has
not upheld his end of the deal," said
SLAC member Zoe Levitt, a fresh
man. "We're here because one year
later, we're still waiting fora code
of conduct."
Doroteo Garcia, an ABM janitor
at Stanford, spoke to the crowd
about his discontent with Stanford's
approach to labor.
"It's a shame that a place like
Stanford is not also a leader in work
place policies," he said through a
translator. "Workers here deserve a
code of conduct and better wages
and benefits."
