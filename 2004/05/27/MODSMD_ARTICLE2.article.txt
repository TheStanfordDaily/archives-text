# Rally blasts labor policies
## 
### MELANIE CORBETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Almost 200 members of the
Stanford community gathered in
White Plaza yesterday demand
ing a code of conduct ensuring
the fair treatment of Stanford
employees. The rally was orga
nized by the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition (SLAC) and in
cluded student activists, Stanford
employees and campus perform
ing groups, all urging the Univer
sity to amend its labor policies.
SLAC members highlighted
problems with Stanford's current
labor situation. According to
SLAC, these include the fact that
many of the University's tempo
rary employees work just as hard
as regular employees yet receive
lower wages. At the Stanford

Linear Accelerator Center (also
referred to as SLAC), long-time
temporary guest house employ
ees were dismissed from their
jobs when they requested per
manent worker status, said
SLAC members.
Protestors also noted that the
wage received by many Stanford
employees is far below the living
wage of Santa Clara County.
Several workers earn $6.75 per
hour, compared to the $13.36
that the California Budget Pro
ject for the county estimates as
the living wage.
SLAC members said that the
adoption of its proposed code of
conduct would remedy these
problems. Among its goals are
equal wages for equal work, in
cluding part-time, temporary
and subcontracted employees,

reaching a real living wage, mak
ing healthcare affordable, in
creasing availability of educa
tional opportunities to workers
and allowing employees to par
ticipate in unions.
"The Code of Conduct would
be a lot better in action than sit
ting here in my hands," said
SLAC member Molly Goldberg,
a junior. "Next year, we want
things implemented; if they're
not, let's get ready fora fight."
Part of the program included a
fast in which over 150 people
pledged to deny themselves food
for the entire day. A strand of
cards containing the names of
people who committed to the ab
stention hung in front of the Bird
Cage, and several students in
