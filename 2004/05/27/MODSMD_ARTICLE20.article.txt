# Warburg and Corkery move on
## 
### KAIYA REEVE STAFF WRITER 
It's on to the second round for two
of Stanford's finest. Eighth-seeded ju
nior Sam Warburg and sophomore
All-American K.C. Corkery will
move onto the next stage of the
NCAA Singles Championships in
Tulsa, Okla., after defeating their op
ponents yesterday in two nail-biters.
Warburg went up against unseeded
senior Stephen Mitchell of Alabama
at 10 a.m. yesterday. The match would
prove to be the last of Mitchell's colle
giate tennis career, while Warburg
gathered his 14th straight win.
Mitchell easily took the first set, 6-
2, but lost a close second set and fal
tered in the third. Warburg captured
the first-round win, 2-6, 7-6,6-3.
Warburg, who was named the Inter
collegiate Tennis Association National
Player to Watch yesterday, will take
the courts again today to face off with
Alex Menichini of Texas Christian.
The fact that he escaped the first round
seems a great feat in itself, since five of
the top eight seeds lost their matches.

One of those top seeds was Ken
tucky's Jesse Witten, whom Corkery
defeated. The unseeded Stanford
sophomore upset Witten, 6-0, 7-6.
Corkery will face a hometown bias
when he plays Tulsa's Dustin Taylor.
Taylor is coming off of a 6-3, 6-2 win
over Wayne Wong of California.
This is the second time that Cork
ery and Taylor will meet this season.
Corkery was fighting an injury during
the last match and was unable to hold
off his opponent, but is looking to
come back strong after an impressive
second half of the season.
It wasn't a good day for the high
seeds. Illinois' Brian Wilson, the top
ranked player in the nation since
April 20, was unceremoniously
kicked out of competition by Robert
Searle of Rice. It was the second
major disappointment for the Fight
ing Illini, who were unable to defend
their NCAA team championship.
They lost a heartbreaking semifinal
round to UCLA on Monday night.
Also out of the competition are
Baylor's No. 2 Benedikt Dorsch and
No. 4 Catalin Gard of Mississippi.
