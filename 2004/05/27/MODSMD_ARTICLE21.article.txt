The Stanford archery
team had a banner weekend
at the U.S. Collegiate
Archery Championships,
held May 12-17 in Harrison
burg, Va. The team soared
to a No. 3 national ranking
after the men's team won a
bronze medal, freshman
Sandra Tyan won All -
American honors and
sophomore Kevin Ju won
Rookie of the Year.
Stanford's No. 3 ranking

reflects a composite of its
scores and rankings from
the various team and indi
vidual events over the con
test's first three days. This
overall score was then used
to rank each competing pro
gram. Stanford trailed only
long-time competitors
Texas A&M and James
Madison (the host school).
"The third place ranking
is a testament to the incredi
ble dedication of this team,"
men's team captain Keith
Coleman said. " This is only
the second year we've sent a

competitive squad to na
tionals and already we're
surpassing some of the best
teams in the country."
Stanford is coached by
U.S. Olympic team coach
Sheri Rhodes and her as
sistant, Francis Parchaso
â€” something that has cat
apulted a young Stanford
squad to national promi
nence.
