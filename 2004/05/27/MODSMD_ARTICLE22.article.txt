# Computerized shoes are a step back
## 
### 
A little pocket adequate to hold my juice
money, and a plastic shoebox classy enough
to carry my kindergarten lunch. Those were
the defining features on the first sneakers I ever wore
â€” a pair of red, white and blue Kangaroos. Sure, they
were some cool kicks, but I'll face it, their unique vel
cro-pocket and carrying case features served athletic
functional purposes of truly little value.
There've been so many innovations in sneaker
technology since the inception of those 1988 'Roos
trainers: Nike had Airs, Zoom Air, Air Max and
Shox, while Reebok had pumps, Insta-pumps. DMX
and DMX foam. L.A. Gear had lights and pumps,
adidas has prided itself primarily on the torsion shock
absorption system since 1988. Until now.
That's because adidas has just unveiled the most
technologically-advanced sneakers in existence:
computer shoes. That's right. Computers, in shoes.
The adidas 1, a shoe which, according to global mar-

keting director Erich Stamminger,
"senses, understands and adapts"
to running conditions, is a product
of three years of research and de
velopment.
The actual innovation is a bat
tery-powered microprocessor chip
in the shoe's arch that drives a small
screw and cable system that adjusts
the heel cushioning in the shoe to
adapt to runner size and running
conditions on the fly. The entire ap-

paratus weighs only 40 grams to keep it light enough
for distance runners, adidas will release the shoe in
December at $250 price-point.
Obviously, the adidas 1 is a great achievement for
the company and a great story in innovation. No one
can deny that. But how exactly are these computer
shoes supposed to help? By adjusting shoe stiffness
based on the running surface?
I guess I don't know too many distance runners, but I
can't imagine them changing running surfaces so
often as to need a shoe that microadjusts the shoe's
support. Runners are a) on a track, b) on the
road/sidewalk, c) on grass or d) on the beach or trail.
There exist four basic surfaces to run on. Sure, trail
runners might have to cross a paved street every once
in a while on their loop, or road runners might have
to spend some time on the grass, but what are we talk
ing here, 10 strides? For $250 you could buy a pair of
roadflats, trailrunners, cross trainers and spikes for
every type of run-able terrain.
The big plus of the adidas 1 is it's a shoe designed
to optimally accommodate every runner's foot in any
condition. But who can afford this shoe besides spon
sored runners, kids who've heisted their parents'
credit cards and those middle-aged power walkers we
see donned in dri-fit polypro goretex windsuits and
aeronautically-configured titanium sport glasses?
Are we going to see parents blowing the sneaker fund
on one pair of perfectly cushioned shoes and end up
giving their children a day or two a week to share the
trainers?
While adidas claims these shoes will make your
running more comfortable and supportive on what
ever terrain your run might entail, and implicitly sug
gests runners can now cover more terrain than ever,
it is only logical to indeed assume the opposite. Who
in their right mind is going to test the shock absorp
tion capabilities of the shoes? What if they break? If
you tiptoe through the shorebreak on the beach do
you face the risk of electrocution? And forget rock
ing those kicks to the airport and putting them
through the X-ray machines at security.
The adidas 1 might even be the cause of more
trouble than expected. Think of all the weak-kneed
and arthritis-ridden joggers that are going to come
out of early retirement after learning about the adi
das 1. Think of all the obese sportsmen looking fora
quick fix. Seat belts and helmets make us feel safer, so
we drive faster and spur bigger wrecks. Weight-loss
products featuring ephedra have been the cause of
numerous documented deaths in the U.S. When
something is perceived as healthy or safer than be
fore, consumers fall into greater disillusion about
their own abilities while using the products.
The 1 's are going to be sweet sneakers when they
hit stores in six months. They will probably draw
some of the biggest stares around when strapped to
your feet. But in developing the shoe, adidas did little
to significantly improve running, get more people in
volved and develop an innovation that has much
more functional use than running shoes already on
the market. While I'm sure these shoes will surely be
the sexiest things going next holiday season, don't let
adidas fool you into thinking its latest innovation is
much more than a 21st-century version of a little vel
cro pocket perfect for keeping the juice money.
