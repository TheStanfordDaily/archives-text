## USC applicants appeal rejection; 32 granted admission 
### JAMES R. KOREN DAILY TROJAN (U. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
"We have arrived at the end of our applica
tion review period, and I'm sorry to say that we
are unable to offer you a space in next year's
entering class."
Every spring, roughly 21.(XX) students hop
ing fora huge package from USC proclaiming
"You're In!" pull this message from a stan
dard envelope.
While this can be a heart-wrenching experi
ence. there are alternatives to settling for sec
ond best. A page of frequently asked questions
in that same envelope explains how to appeal
their admission rejection.
This FAQ page says that applicants can
submit a statement explaining why their appli
cations should reviewed, as well as adding any
"new and compelling information."
"An example [of new and compelling in
formation] might be the significant illness of a
parent that they didn't disclose in their origi
nal application, but that explains why they
had a bad junior year, or something like that,"
said J. Michael Thompson, dean of admis

sions. This can also include grades that
weren't available when the original applica
tion was due, he said.
Once applicants send in their appeals, a se
lect committee of senior admissions managers
goes over the new information — along with
the original applications — and sees if any stu
dents really should be admitted.
This year, 500 applicants appealed their re
jections: 32 of them were granted admission —
roughly 6 percent.
Although the letter asks for information
that is new and compelling, many applicants
do not provide such information, and are sim
ply hoping for another review of their original
application.
"Sometimes they just give us an update on
their recent activities. We want students to
have confidence that we're doing our job thor
oughly. We want to hear students who just
want another review," said Kirk Brennan, se
nior associate director of admissions for tile re
view and a member of the appeals committee.
Erin Daniel, a senior at St. Joseph High
School in Santa Maria, California, will be at
tending USC this year and majoring in bio

chemical engineering even though she re
ceived a rejection letter in March.
Daniel said the rejection letter surprised
her because "I'm ranked sixth in my class, and
I've taken every honors and advanced place
ment class my school offers."
Her high school guidance counselor,
Michael Tscheekar, said he felt a mistake
was made and that Daniel should have been
accepted.
"Often I'm not surprised at all when a stu
dent doesn't get into a school, but in her case I
really was,"he said.
Both Tscheekar and Daniel wrote letters to
send to the committee, and Tscheekar sent a
transcript that included grades from the most
recent quarter.
Daniel said her letter didn't provide any
thing new or compelling to the committee. "It
said that they wanted new and compelling in
formation, but nothing had really changed at
all. I just basically wrote about what my life was
like and what my activities were," she said.
Tscheekar's letter, however, sought to put
her transcript and accomplishments in con
text — specifically that St. Joseph is a private.

college preparatory high school, and that
Daniel took the most challenging classes
available, he said.
While he could not say exactly why Daniel
was admitted, Johnson said the letters Daniel
and Tscheekar wrote were very compelling.
This appeal worked. However, the over
whelming majority — 94 percent — does not.
While the committee found Daniel's appeal
compelling enough to reverse the original the
decision, the committee finds the average ap
peal less convincing.
"The most common appeal is ast udent who
tells us they really want to go here, but who
hasn't demonstrated in the classroom that
they're prepared to go here," Brennan said.
While the committee may find a family
tragedy or steady academic improvement
compelling enough to reverse a decision, they
do not feel the same way about Trojan pride.
"When someone sends in something that
says - 1 really really really want to go here,' we
don't find that very interesting. There are a lot
of students who really want to go here," ex
plained Elizabeth Slattery, associate director
of admissions and a member of the appeal

committee.
Nearly all of the overturned decisions are
based on new and compelling information, but
occasionally — maybe once or twice per year
— a decision is overturned because of a simple
error. Thompson said.
"We're open to the idea that these are
human beings making decisions and we can
make mistakes," he said.
However, because so few rejections are
overturned, "Most of the time it just confirms
that we made good decisions in the first place,"
Slattery said.
Along with confirming the validity of most
admissions decisions, the appeal process also
helps to improve and streamline the regular
admission process.
By understanding what kind of information
students provide that result in overturned de
cisions, Thompson said the admissions depart
ment can start to get that information in the
first round.
"When we see decisions being overturned on
this new and compelling information, we
think, 'huh, maybe we should ask everybody
for this in the first place,' " he said.
