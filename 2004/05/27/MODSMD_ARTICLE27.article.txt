# International student enrollment drops at CU-Boulder
## 
### ELLEN LOKAJAYA COLORADO DAILY (U. COLORADO 
Abdul√üahman Al-Taweel stood anxiously at the im
migration line at a New York airport, waiting for his turn.
In his hand, he held his Kuwaiti passport and his 1-20
student visa document. As he moved nearer to the front
of the line, the thought of being turned away from enter
ing the United States loomed in his head. He was wor
ried that if he was denied entry, he would not be able to
continue studying to become an engineer.
When his turn came, Al-Taweel was taken to what is
known as the "secondary screening room," where he
waited as immigration officials checked his background
and asked him questions. After three hours. Al-Taweel
breathed a sigh of relief as he was given his passport and
allowed to return to the United States.
Since the terrorists attacks on September 11, 20()1, in
ternational students have faced new and stricter regula
tions implemented by the U.S. Immigrations and Cus
toms Enforcement (USICE), previously known as Immi

gration and Naturalization Services (INS).
The USICE is responsible for the new computerized
system that tracks international students in the country,
called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information
System (SEVIS). SEVIS requires international students
from certain countries in the Middle East and Europe to
"special register" with local immigration offices.
Stories of Arab or Muslim students refused U.S. entry
despite their valid student visas are common. Al-Taweel,
21, a CU-Boulder chemical engineering major, said a year
after September 11,2001. his friend was turned away at the
U.S. border, sent home one semester before graduation.
Huda Al-Mousa, 21, a CU business student also from
Kuwait, said her male friend had to wait 12 hours before he
was cleared to enter New York.
"It is understood that this is done to discourage Arab
students, especially Saudis and males, from coming to
study," said Al-Mousa. "It's working; a lot less people feel
like putting up with the hassle and mistreatment."
International student enrollment at CU-Boulder
dropped 6.9 percent from last spring, from 1,112 stu

dents to 1,035, according to enrollment statistics from
CU's Office of Planning, Budget and Analysis.
"It's taking longer to get visas and when you apply for
visas, they are doing a lot of security checks based on
name and what you are studying," said Tina Tan, the di
rector of the International Student and Scholar Services
(ISSS). "In response to 9-11. they are requiring visa in
terviews of people who are applying fora visa."
Under the SEVIS system, universities and colleges
around the U.S. have to report where international stu
dents live, whether they are a full-time or part-time stu
dents and any changes in the students' information.
The new regulations have not only affected CU's in
ternational students but prospective students as well.
Tan said representatives from some Middle Eastern em
bassies have contacted CU on behalf of parents of
prospective students expressing concerns regarding the
new immigration rules.
Tan said CU's tuition as compared to other university
might be one of many factors that caused the decrease in
enrollment, but the main issue is visa delays and back

ground checks.
CU telecommunication graduate student Urvish
Khandwalla. from India, said the new regulations do not
bother him because he understood them to be part of se
curity measures. However, Khandwalla said he was not
separated and screened at the airport like Al-Mousa and
Al-Taweel.
"1 do not object to anything as long as my privacy is
taken care of," said Khandwalla. "It's absolutely fine be
cause I am not doing anything wrong for which I would
be scared to give my details, as in my photograph or fin
gerprints."
Khandwalla was referring to the U.S. VISIT system in
which immigration officers scan visitors' fingerprints and
take photographs of non-U.S. citizens and permanent res
idents.
"Since every visitor is being subjected to this treat
ment, it feels more fair, but you feel like a criminal," said
Al-Mousa. "I often wonder if Americans had to put up
with the same treatment at other airports if they would
support what is happening here."
