# Davis jail reaches capacity
## 
### ROBERT YOUNG THE CALIFORNIAAGGIE (U CALIFORNIA-DAVIS 
The Yolo County Jail
sometimes reaches its full ca
pacity, creating problems for
law enforcement in deciding
where to house inmates.
As of May 20, the jail's
population numbered 445 in
mates, with space available
for 455 inmates, according to
the YCJ. On April 7, the jail
was at full capacity.
When the jail does reach
its maximum limit, prisoners
are often transferred to near
by jails such as Glen County
Jail, said Sgt. Rich Williams,
a spokesperson for the YCJ.
"We're generally at ca
pacity or close to it on most
days," Williams said.
A reason for the increase
in the demand for housing
for prisoners may be the
large increase in the county's
population.
According to a survey by
the California Department
of Finance, from January
2003 to January 2004, the
state's population increased
by 1.5 percent and Yolo

County grew by 1.9 percent.
"112 Yolo J County is grow
ing by leaps and bounds, and
when you have more peo
ple, you have more crime,
and when you have more
crime, you need a bigger
jail," said Yolo County
Sheriff Ed Prieto.
Prieto said that there is a
federal consent decree that
requires jails to operate at no
more than an 80 percent ca
pacity. The jail is currently
operating above that num
ber, but prisoners are not
being released.
Several months ago, in
mates had to be released be
cause the jail was approach
ing its maximum limits. Pri
eto said that most of the in
mates that were released
were charged with misde
meanor offenses.
There were also some
concerns expressed by the
community with releasing in
mates, he said.
"I made the commitment
to the community to person
ally not release inmates," Pri
eto said.
Instead of releasing the
inmates, the YCJ has been

transferring them when the
jail nears capacity. The an
nual cost of transferring in
mates to be housed at other
local jails totals about
$300,000 to $400,000, Pri
eto said.
One alternative to releas
ing prisoners is to build addi -
tional pods onto the jail to
house additional inmates.
One pod houses about 79 in
mates.
Prieto said he would like
to see up to another pod and
a half to adequately serve the
county's demand for housing
prisoners. He said that the
building costs could run from
$12 million to $13 million,
not including the annual
costs of maintaining the facil
ities and housing the inmates.
"A lot of it boils down to
money," Prieto said.
With the current fiscal sit
uation, additional funding
for the YCJ is not likely.
"Clearly, the sheriff is
doing a tremendous job
using the resources he has,
but he is only one depart
ment and all our depart
ments are being stretched,"
said Yolo County Supervisor

Mariko Yamada.
Yamada said that the Yolo
County Supervisors were
aware of the jail's situation
and are looking at a number of
options to address the growth
in the prison population.
"This is a serious prob
lem. We recognize that and
we will address [it] to the best
of our ability given the bud
get constraints," Yamada
said.
She said she preferred to
address the issue with a more
"preventive model." Yama
da pointed out that the coun
ty was currently building a
new juvenile detention cen
ter.
The Yolo County Super
visors will not be able to
begin their budget until the
state budget is finalized. The
constitutional deadline for
the state budget to be signed
by the governor is June 30;
the fiscal year begins on July
1. However, the state has
failed to meet this deadline in
previous years.
Yamada said she expect
ed to have the county's final
budget adopted sometime in
the fall.
