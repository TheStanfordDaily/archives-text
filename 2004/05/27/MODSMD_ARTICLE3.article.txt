# GSC certifies Chioke-Kory
## 
### ANTHONY HA MANAGING EDITOR 
The Graduate Student
Council (GSC) voted last
night to certify the results of
the ASSU special executive
election. This completes the
certification process for Pres
ident-elect Chioke Vorgelt-
Mose and Vice President
elect Kory Vargas Caro,
whose victory was certified
by the Undergraduate Senate
on Monday.
"Both Kory and I are
thrilled that we can actually
start work," said Vorgelt-
Mose, a sophomore.
Before the vote. Elec
tions Commissioner Ellie
Martin, a junior, recom
mended that the Council cer
tify the special-election re
sults. Echoing her comments
from Monday's meeting,
Martin noted that she had
recommended that the Sen
ate certify the previous exec
utive election, "but that's
just not going to happen."
Martin also pointed out
that failing to certify the spe
cial election could jeopar
dize the ASSU, as the Con
stitutional Council currently
lacks the quorum necessary
to make decisions. She
added that a further delay in
certification could hurt the
ASSU's reputation.
"Just on a personal level, I
encourage you to certify,"
Martin said. "If you don't,
there's a good chance that we

won't have an executive slate
until next year."
Some GSC members ex
pressed concern about the
special election's four per
cent turnout among gradu
ate students.
"We should note that we
are troubled by the low
turnout," said GSC member
Surya Singh, a doctoral stu
dent in mechanical engi
neering. "The Elections
Commission should not feel
that a four percent turnout
from our constituency
makes fora fair election. We
don't want people to think
that this is acceptable."
Seven GSC members
voted to certify the election,
two voted against it and one
abstained.
"It was a procedural
vote," said GSC member
and education doctoral stu
dent Luke Miller, who voted
against certification. "It was
not a vote against the incom
ing slate, nor was it a vote for
the slate that won the first
election. My understanding
is that the reason given for
not certifying the original
election was not valid ac
cording to the Constitution
al Council."
During last night's meet
ing, the GSC also passed a bill
splitting the joint buffer fund
for special-fees requests into
a graduate buffer fund and an
undergraduate buffer fund.
"The reason is that undergradu
ates are still in a precarious situa
tion," said former GSC Chair
Steve Allison, a doctoral student in
geophysics. "There's still a risk
that they'll have a high refund rate
next year."
The graduate fee schedule was
also passed last night. As originally
proposed by ASSU Financial Man
ager Kyle Alisharan, graduate stu
dents would have paid $29 for gen
eral and special fees in the fall, and
$28 in the winter and spring.
After several GSC members ar
gued that the estimated 10 percent
refund rate among graduates was
too high, the schedule was adjusted
with an 8 percent estimate. Under
the new schedule, graduate students
will pay $28 each quarter.
