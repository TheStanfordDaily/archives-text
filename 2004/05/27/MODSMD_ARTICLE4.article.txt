# Draw results surprise many
## 
### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Late last Saturday, the results of
the undergraduate housing Draw
were released. Over one month after
starting the process by forming
groups and applying for housing, stu
dents finally knew where they would
be living next year — and some of
them weren't happy with the results.
According to Director of Hous
ing Assignments Todd Benson,
3,925 undergraduates applied to be
in the Draw this year. This includes
people who will be staffing next
year but excludes fraternity and
sorority members.
There were several noticeable
changes in cut-off numbers from pre
vious years in some houses. While
Bob remained the most desirable
Row house for females — with a cut
off of 102 fora single female — the
cutoff fora single male in Bob rose
from 92 to 333.
"After seeing the results, it seems
like the cutoffs were really thrown
out of whack this year," said fresh

man Tiffany Cartwright.
680 Lomita, a Row house filled
with two-room doubles, drew the
lowest for males this year with a cut
off of 234. Many students said they
were startled by these drastic
changes and noted how unpre
dictable the process is.
"Our group was very surprised to
see that 680 Lomita was the most
sought-after house on campus," said
freshman Mike Ozawara. "We cer
tainly didn't expect that when we
were listing our housing choices."
Benson attributed these changes
to a number of factors including larg
er gender differences in the number
of students listing a certain residence
as one of their choices. Group assign
ments can also greatly affect cut-off
numbers.
"In some of the Row houses
which have fewer than 60 students, if
two male or female groups happen to
have good Draw numbers, they may
take up the majority of the spaces in
the house and greatly lower the cut
offs," Benson said.
He additionally noted that in pri

ority houses, some disparities can be
attributed to the fact that there may
be more students of one gender with
priority than another.
Overall, Benson said that Draw
ran rather smoothly with minimal
problems.
"Every year in the Draw there are
a few cases where students have
questions about a priority, about why
their group was split or other issues,"
Benson said. "There were a few of
these questions this year, just as there
are every year."
Freshman Kelly Swaim was mis
takenly split off from his group of
three other freshmen and placed by
himself in Potter. While the problem
was eventually fixed, he expressed
much frustration over the housing of
fices and the Draw.
"It's the most complicated
process I've had to deal with at Stan
ford," Swaim said. "From what I've
experienced, the housing offices are
not very cohesive."

Students check their housing assignments last week.
The in-house Draw, through
which students are assigned to
specific rooms in their respective
houses, started yesterday and will
continue through the weekend. It
is up to the local residence office
or usually house staff to decide
how rooms and roommates are as
signed. They are largely assigned
based on seniority; within a class
year the order for choosing rooms
is randomized.
Starting tonight, students will be
able to respond to their housing as
signment on Axess. They have until
Friday June 11 to reply and accept
the terms of the Residence Agree
ment. When responding, students
additionally have the option to re
quest new assignment if they are
unhappy with their current one.
According to Benson, between 60
to 90 students usually join the wait
ing list for reassignment every year.
Results of this waiting-list round
are announced on Julv 25.
