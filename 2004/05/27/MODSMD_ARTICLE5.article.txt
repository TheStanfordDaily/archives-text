### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Center for African Studies
(CAS) is sponsoring initiatives to
support student travel to Africa in
response to administrative support
and surging student interest in ad
dressing the political, social and eco
nomic dilemmas facing Africans.
"For the last five or six years, stu
dents from all departments and schools
seem to be growing more interested in
Africa," said CAS Director Richard
Roberts, a professor of history.
In response to increasing stu
dent interest, six new faculty mem

bers have been hired within the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
This increase in faculty provides
students with greater variety in
African Studies courses and more
academic assistance for honors the
ses, Roberts said.
Roberts attributed students' in
terest in the region to Africa's
troubling social, economic and po
litical milieu.
"To be sure, the problems facing
Africa and Africans from the HIV /
AIDS crisis to civil wars have stimu
lated Stanford students' interests,"
Roberts said.
Students are being motivated to

help in a variety of ways, and a num
ber of new programs supporting
overseas travel to Africa are current
ly underway.
In hopes of conducting research
and educating others, nearly 60 un
dergraduate students have taken the
initiative to raise money and orga
nize trips to Africa. Their plans in
clude such projects as providing
AIDS education to citizens of
Arusha, Tanzania and assisting
refugees from Botswana.
In conjunction with the Overseas
Studies Program (OSP), CAS has
been working to establish more per
manent student programs in Africa.

As a result, students may study the
effects of racial segregation in South
African laboratories at both the Uni
versity of the Western Cape and
Cape Town University.
Currently, OSP conducts an over
seas seminar in South Africa, which
accepts applications from nearly 75
applicants a year and grants admis
sion to a select group of 15 appli
cants, Roberts said.
CAS Program Administrator
Christine Capper asserted that fund
ing for these opportunities will mir
ror the level of student interest.
"As Stanford students continue to
be interested in Africa, CAS will be

eager to work with the University in
raising more funds to help more stu
dents travel to Africa," Capper said.
Aside from student travel, many
students have given their support
through work in non-governmental
African organizations that are ded
icated to aiding troubled African
regions.
Through research and classes,
students are educating themselves
on issues such as public health, histo
ry, economic policy and environ
mental controversies facing
Africans. Many are learning about
these issues through classes taught
by Associate Prof. David Katzen

stein and other members of CAS,
Roberts said.
"Students have taken seriously
the University's effort to promote
service activities and have gravitated
in large numbers to courses."
Roberts said.
According to Roberts, the Haas
Center also provides students with a
number of African service fellow
ships, allowing them to help the
African community through service
oriented summer internships.
Roberts offered an explanation
for student interest in African caus
es: "Stanford students know that
they can make a difference."
