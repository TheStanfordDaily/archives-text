Life for Dummies: What your $160k education failed to teach you
It's not alcoholism until
you leave college
Sometimes when I reflect on all the beer 1 drink I feel
ashamed. Then I look into the glass and think about the
workers in the brewery and all Of their hopes and dreams. If
I didn't drink this beer, they might be out of work and their
dreams would be shattered. I think, "It is better to drink this
beer and let their dreams come true than be selfish and
worry about my liver."
— Babe Ruth
24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case. Coincidence? I
think not.
— H. L. Mencken
When we drink, we get drunk. When we get drunk, we fall
asleep. When we fall asleep, we commit no sin. When we
commit no sin, we go to heaven.So, let's all get drunk and go
to heaven!
— George Bernard Shaw
An intelligent man is sometimes forced to be drunk to
spend time with his fools.
— Ernest Hemingway
Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.
— Benjamin Franklin
One night at Cheers, Cliff Clavin explained the "Buffalo
Theory" to his buddy Norm:
"Well ya see. Norm, it's like this. A herd of buffalo can
only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd
is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that
are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as
a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole
group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest
members.
In much the same way. the human brain can only operate
as fast as he slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol,
as we know, kills brain cells. But naturally, it attacks the
slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular con
sumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making
the brain a faster and more efficient machine! That's why
you always feel smarter after a few beers."

"Beer. Now there's a temporary solution."
"And how is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something
new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking
course, and I forgot how to drive?"
"Trying is the first step towards failure."
"Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother
just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!"
"No, no, no, Lisa. If adults don't like their jobs, they don't goon strike. They just go in every day and
do it really half-assed."
"Bart, with $10,000, we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like ... love!"
