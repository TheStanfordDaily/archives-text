# Provost tell Fac Sen of cuts for future retirees
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL STAFF WRITER 
As part of his annual budget report. Provost John Etchemendy proposed
cuts to retiree medical benefits at the Faculty Senate meeting yesterday af
ternoon. The changes, which will be presented to the Board of Trustees next
week, would significantly reduce Stanford's long-term cost of paying for em
ployee medical benefits.
Etchemendy also discussed other salary-related cuts, but noted that most
salaries will be increasing this year because the salary freeze has ended.
For retired staff to currently receive medical benefits, the sum of their
years of service at Stanford and their age have to add up to 75. The employ
ee also has to have worked at Stanford fora minimum of 10 years. The re
tiree can then receive annual benefits equal to $3,176 if he is under 65 and
$2,472 if he is over 65.
The new plan would pay retirees a medical benefit equal to $ 100 for every
year of service. Under both plans a spouse receives 60 percent of the retiree's
medical benefit, and the benefits would be adjusted annually for inflation.
Over the last five years, employee benefits have risen 45 percent, impact
ing the University budget.
"We have a very generous benefits package," Etchemendy said. "It is
more generous than other universities and other local companies."
According to data that Etchemendy presented, the current plan — if
left uncapped — could cost the University over $6,000 per
retiree by 2014. The proposed plan would cost about $3,000
per retiree in 2014 if those retirees had worked at Stanford
for 20 years.
"1 can tell you that all our peer institutions are doing the
same thing we are doing," Etchemendy said. "They are taking
a good look at their benefits packages."
Etchemendy also commented on the conflict between ben
efits and the coming salary increases.
"The increase in benefits is eating up our ability to offer
an increasing salary program," he said. "Do you want salary
or benefits?"
According to Etchemendy, there are three advantages to
the new medical benefits plan. It rewards seniority with in
creased benefits; it controls burgeoning medical-care costs;
and it allows the flexibility to adjust benefits upward when nec
essary and affordable.
Because Stanford already offers generous benefits and is
increasing pay, Etchemendy said that the change would not
make Stanford much less competitive in attracting and retain
ing faculty.
Biological Sciences Prof. Robert Simoni said that tying
medical benefits to years of service would create a disincentive
to retire. He also said that he was concerned about the medical
benefits being sufficient.
"It seems where we are relative to others is not an appro
priate measure," Simoni said. "We have to consider the ade
quacy of the benefits."
In response, Etchemendy explained that the rising cost of
health care is an issue that extends beyond the limits of Stan
ford. Nationwide, the cost of health care has been growing
rapidly at about 15 percent a year. Last year that increase
slowed to a still sizeable 10 percent.
In another cost-saving measure, Etchemendy also pro
posed cuts to retirement savings plans. Right now, Stanford
annually puts five percent of employee salaries into a tax-de
ferrable savings account as a basic contribution to a retirement
plan. For employees that opt to put more of their salary into re
tirement savings, Stanford also offers matching funds.
Etchemendy recommended reducing the first-year 10 per
cent cash bonus that the University pays in lieu of a first-year
basic contribution. The one-time cash bonus is designed to at
tract faculty, but Etchemendy said that because faculty do not
know about it, it serves no purpose and should be cut.
He also suggested deferring or phasing in the basic contri
bution for other employees. Etchemendy discussed lowering
the matching funds as an alternative but did not recommend it.
In addition to the Provost's budget report, the Faculty Sen
ate also discussed the status of women faculty, coinciding with
the release of a report on the topic. The faculty quality-of-life
survey found that there are no significant gender differences in
measures of overall satisfaction but that female faculty are
more concerned about quality-of-life issues.
The survey also found that professors of higher rank were
more satisfied than professors of lower rank and that women
in the social sciences are significantly less satisfied than their
male colleagues.
