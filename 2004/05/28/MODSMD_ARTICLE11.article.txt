# Fireside Chats
## Stocking up 
### 
While most of the campus is preparing for finals
by spending long hours in the library, seniors have a dif
ferent set of priorities as the year comes to a close. The
ses bound and GERs fulfilled (or so we hope), the end of
the year is more about fitting in all those last minute
Stanford memories that we wish we'd gotten to earlier.
And we're not talking about the 101 things to do before
you leave Stanford.

With Commence
ment activities scheduled
up the ass and overly ex
cited family members fly
ing in from all corners
of the world, there are
only a few days left of
normal Stanford exis
tence. There's obviously
not enough time to go
back and do all the things
we've missed out on dur
ing the past four years,

but there is time to reflect on what has made our Stan
ford experiences so exceptional. Finish your papers
early so you have time to go out with old friends, hit up
your favorite restaurants and have one last conversa
tion with your nasty freshman roommate that you
haven't spoken to since the day you moved out back in
June '01.
If you find that your friends are all too busy to
reminisce with you, don't worry: There is someone you
can talk to. If you haven't yet taken advantage of the
complimentary services at CAPS (Counseling and Psy
chological Services), go in and schedule your ten free ses
sions now. They're required to listen. Besides, therapy is
exorbitantly expensive in the real world, so you should
get it free while you can.
When was the last time you visited the Book
store or the Stanford Store to stock up on Stanford ap
parel? It was probably when you were an excited high
school senior, eager to show the world that you would
be attending one of the country's finest institutions of
higher learning. That spirit is easy to lose once you're
here — we all go to Stanford, and we all know it. But
now that we're going off in different directions yet
again, it's time to wear Cardinal with pride to remind
ourselves (and others) of our undergraduate experi
ences. Next January when you're trudging through
dirty slush in the streets of New York, your Stanford
sweatshirt underneath your floor length wool coat,
hat, scarf and gloves will remind you of your sunny
days in California.
So stock up-on Stanford memorabilia, Stan
ford memories and drink tickets for the Night Be
fore party.
For all of you who have spent your Friday after
noons reading the inanity that has been "Fireside Chats,"
we thank you. Like our Stanford experiences, writing
this column has been amazing — certainly full of ups and
downs, a lot of really bad jokes, too many references to
alcohol and a lot of questions regarding the true nature
of our relationship.
To the graduating Class of 2004,
OMG, we can't believe we're graduating!!!!! It
was so great to have you in homeroom. Your dress at
prom was soooo pretty. Anyway, have a great summer,
keep in touch always. It's been real.
Friends 4eva, Courtaline
