# Gay athletes at Stanford
## Voices from the field 
### MICHAEL DUCA INVESTIGATIVE TEAM LEADER 
Most people assume that gay
men and athletes occupy different
worlds. In high school, we saw the
gays and the jocks (if such groups
existed) eat at different cafeteria ta
bles. Presumably, they hung out in
different crowds, played different
games, watched different TV shows
and preferred different brands of
clothing. They probably laughed at
different kinds of jokes.
According to these same stereo
types, the gays and the athletes at
Stanford live in disconnected
worlds, just as they did back home.
The gays hide away in campus co
ops and athletes set their stakes in
fraternities. At parties, the gays sip
Smirnoff Ice while athletes chug
beer. The gays save their commen
tary for fashion, while the athletes
talk about, well, sports.
The rest of us don't bother to
question whether or not this is the
case. We assume that separateness
between crowds is inevitable, even
natural, and that people are easily
sorted into categories with single
word labels. Gay. Athlete. If we
have just one word to describe or
define a person, then we can make
the following simple inference:
Gays are not athletes, and athletes
are not gay.
Who they are
Nine varsity male athletes from
four different sports, all of whom
are undergraduate students at Stan
ford, offered their opinions about
being gay in college athletics —and
bridging two worlds which do not
naturally blend together. These ath
letes represent a variety of races, re
ligions and socioeconomic back
grounds. A few of them are openly
gay to all of their teammates,
though most are out to only a select
few — or to no teammates at all.
Some acknowledge to anyone who
asks that they are gay, while others
are far more private about their sex
ual orientation and limit talk of their
sexuality to close friends and, in
some cases, relatives. Some have
known for years that they are gay,
while others have come to terms
only recently.
Most of those who interviewed
have chosen to remain anony
mous; and therefore, the sports
teams for which they play are also.
(Pseudonyms have been used to
distinguish the anonymous re
spondents; in such cases, a
pseudonym is identified by an ac
companying asterisk.)

Keeping secrets
The single most important fac
tor that differentiated these nine
athletes from each other was
whether or not they felt they were
keeping a secret from their team.
Those athletes who were the least
secretive — the ones who were
open to their teammates about their
sexuality — were those who spoke
most positively about their experi
ences as a gay athlete.
Adam*, a sophomore who
never hid his sexuality from his
teammates, said, "[Coming out]
was immensely comfortable. 1 was
treated as if 1 was straight. The
more time that went by, the more
happy I was that I was open from
the very beginning."
Brian*, a senior who came out to his
entire team midway through his sports ca
reer, said, "It was much more difficult for

me to be closet
ed than to be
straight. You
have to pre
tend so much. I
couldn't re
spond to com
ments people
made [like gay
jokes and slurs]
because I was
worried about
the repercus
sions."
For those
gay athletes
who weren't
out to their

teammates, anxiety and fear about
being discovered was pervasive.
Jason*, a sophomore who only re
cently came out, said, "It's easier for
me if guys don't know I'm gay be
cause, if they know I'm gay, they
could take it the wrong way."
"[Being in the closet] is diffi
cult," said Gary*, a senior. "There is
such a big assumption that I'm
straight, and I'm afraid of what
would happen — the reaction of the
teammates and coaches — if I came
out."
"Coaches and teammates still
make gay jokes, like limp wrist
jokes," said Paul*, a freshman, of
fering one explanation for why he
has chosen to not yet come out.
Breaking the news
Normal students typically have
more control over the process of
coming out because they can selec
tively choose who knows they are
gay. But sports teams are known for
being tight-knit; they are small, in
sulated communities in which se

crets are discouraged, and personal
identity is inextricably linked with
team identity. Because of this stan
dard, it can be difficult for gay ath
letes to pick and choose certain
teammates to come out to. Telling
one is telling all.
Last year, Jason* started dating
his first boyfriend, and he shared
this information with one teammate
and a few other friends. He never in
tended for this information to make
its way to "at least half" of his team,
he says, but "somehow people just
found out."
Similarly, Gary* feels that he is
losing the ability to stay in control of
who knows he is gay. "More and
more people around campus are
finding out about me," he said, "and
as more and more people find out, I
think it's inevitable [my teammates
will find out too]."
When junior Guillermo Vargas

played for the
track and field
team during
his freshman
year, he was in
the closet. He
said, "I was
very paranoid
throughout the
entire year. My
worst case sce
nario was hav
ing my team
find out that I
was gay before
I told them be
cause it would

allow them to make judgments about
me."
Despite his fears, when Vargas ulti
mately came out, "they were very recep
tive and supportive."
The positive responses heard
from Adam* and Brian* contrast
with the more complicated stories
of Gary*, Jason* and Vargas. It
should be noted, however, that
Adam and Brian play for the same
team — a team which has histori
cally had openly gay athletes and,
through necessity, learned to deal
with the issue. Adam said, "We al
ready had a semi-queer contingent
on the team, which definitely paved
the way for people to have open at
titudes."
Fearing the team
The vast majority of athletic
teams never have dealt with an
openly gay athlete. Dwight Slater,
Class of 2002, was a freshman red
shirting with the Stanford football
team in 1998 when his team learned
At the time, I honestly didn't feel I

had a choice but to leave the team,"
he said. Even after he left, he con
tinued hearing stories about former
teammates telling ongoing jokes
about him.
Slater's experience, which re
ceived significant publicity in the
late '90s, highlights the fact that
gay athletes often faced a danger
of rejection. They can be rejected
by their teammates and coaches,
and forced or coerced to leave
their teams.
When asked whether he be
lieved a student at Stanford, often
called a liberal university, could be
kicked off a team for being gay,
Gary* responded with an emphat
ic yes.
"Stanford really is just a collec
tion of people from all over the
country, and while a lot of people
who come here are more open
minded. there are still people here,
coaches and administrators, who
bring with them past prejudices and
preconceived notions of what an
athlete should be and what an ath
lete can and cannot be.
"And 1 think there are cases
where it's so ingrained in a coach or
administrator's head, where they
feel in order to protect the program,
they may have to sacrifice an individ
ual," Gary* continued. "But they
would not say they kicked him off for
being gay, they would say, 'You've
lost intensity, you've lost desire.' "
Many closeted gay athletes did
not express fears of being kicked
off; more common were fears of los
ing friends, respect or social stand
ing. Sam* and Paul* are gay and are
on the same varsity team, although
they are not out to other teammates.
No member of their team is openly
gay, but they do not discount the
possibility that someone could
come out and be accepted. Sam*
said, "I think people's perceptions
of you would change [if they found
out are gay], but it would be tempo
rary." He added, "I feel like you
need someone brave to make peo
ple start seeing things different."
Sam* and Paul* suggested that
better athletes are more likely to be
accepted by teammates. The star
athlete who comes out would be
more likely to remain on a team
than an athlete who spends most his
time at the sideline, because, said
Paul, "ultimately, we still need you
for nationals."
Team dynamics
Dan Trupin, a junior on Stan-

ford's swimming team, is out to his team,
and speaks positively of his time with his
teammates and coaches. However, he ac
knowledges that openly gay athletes face as
many challenges as closeted ones — they
are merely different challenges. He men
tions the possibility of becoming isolated,
or risking the disappointment, bitterness or
anger of teammates.
"As an athlete, you are supposed to fit
within a mold. You have to break out of
that mold to come out."
While "breaking out of a mold" may
sound liberating, it runs against the per
ception of unity many teams depend on.
Gary* said, "The dynamic of a team is
closely related to how comfortable
teammates feel with one another. Team
mates are expected to hold similar be
liefs and views. The thought that some
one on the team is not being honest
messes with the concept of a team. If the
individual members of the group are not
all working and thinking alike, then the
team is weaker."
Closeted athletes worry that if they
come out, their teammates may misinter
pret their intention for playing sports as
being sexual. Both on and off the field,
teammates share close personal space —
locker rooms, showers, hotel rooms —
and straight athletes may feel uncomfort
able if they believe a teammate regards in
them sexually.
Interestingly, not a single respondent
said that they view their teammates in sexu
al terms. "I don't look at my teammates like

that," said Trupin.
"All I'm thinking about is the athletic as
pect of it," said Gary*. "It's not like I'm look
ing around, trying to get someone's number
or meet someone, anything like that."
Vargas, a former track and field
team member, participated in varsity
basketball and soccer teams in high
school. He noted that certain sports
place more emphasis on being seen as
masculine and overtly heterosexual. He
said, "The level of contact and physical
interaction between athletes makes a
difference in the degree of homophobia
in a sport. Those sports that rely heavily
on a team dynamic, like basketball or
soccer, have more [homophobia] than
sports in which individuals compete on
their own — sports like swimming, track
or tennis."
Jason*, whose sport requires team
mates and opponents to come in physical
contact with each other frequently, feels
that gay athletes in close-contact team
sports have a greater difficulty coming out
to teammates than athletes in other, less
contact-heavy sports. He said, "Sports that
have more physical contact make it harder
for someone to acknowledge that they're
gay because there's the issue of a guy touch
ing another guy."
Slater, speaking from personal experi
ence on the football team, corroborated the
sentiments of Vargas and Jason*.
"I think there are just as many [gay
guys] in team sports as in individual sports.
It is just a much bigger deal [for them to
come out], I knew of other persons on the
team while I was there. It was more than
just me. I wasn't the only one."
The whole world knows
Gay college athletes who come out
may also bear the burden of angering

teammates because rumors of an athlete's
homosexuality inevitably spread to other
colleges. It is common for athletes and
coaches at rival schools to use such infor
mation as fodder for ridicule and derision
of a school's athletic program. "Had I
stayed on the football team, we would
have become the 'gay football team,' "
said Slater.
"Other teams love to use the fact that
we have openly gay athletes as an anti-re
cruiting technique," Trupin said. Anti-re
cruiting refers to the practice that coaches
and athletics programs often employ to dis
suade recruits from attending the sports
programs of rival schools.
Brian* echoed the feeling that athletes
who play intercollegiate sports must accept
that if they come out, people beyond the
borders of their own campus will find out.
He said, "You aren't coming out to just
your team or a few people; you're coming
out to your entire sport."
"A normal student who is coming out
isn't going to have other people across the
country talking shit about them," said
Trupin, referring to the magnified level of
speculation, gossip and discrimination that
gay athletes may encounter from rival ath
letes, coaches and complete strangers if
they come out.
The bad and the good
Beyond the risks of encountering dis
crimination, ridicule or social ostracism,
gay athletes may even lose the ability to
play sports altogether — or even go to col
lege. The worst case scenario is when an
athlete loses a scholarship.
Such was the case for Slater, who lost his
football scholarship when he left the team;
he chose to take out student loans and work
his way through Stanford. Today, as he at
tends law school at Emory University, he

still feels frustrated that he must pay thou
sands of dollars of student loan debt.
"In retrospect, I would have thought
longer and harder about leaving the
team, because 1 lost the scholarship,"
Slater said, "but I probably would have
done it anyway."
For some gay athletes, coming out
can be career-ending in the worst cases;
still, many acknowledge that coming
out leads to an improved ability to per
form athletically.
"Think about it," Gary* said. "If
you're devoting a quarter of your energy
to staying in the closet, that's a quarter of
your energy that you're not putting to
wards your sport. [Before I came out], I
spent so much time thinking about
whether or not I was gay that I got sick,
couldn't eat and basically missed an entire
year of competition."
Gary's experience was affirmed by
other athletes, who reported that their ath
leticism suffered during periods in which
they were most preoccupied with ques
tions about — or concerns with hiding —
their homosexuality.
To come out or not?
Ultimately, the question of whether
or not to come out to one's team is fraught
with complexity. When asked to offer ad
vice on what a gay athlete should do —
come out or not come out — responses
varied greatly. Some believed that com
ing out was the only way one could be
happy. Others felt the issue was too com
plex to offer general advice; an athlete's
personality, background and personal cir
cumstances, they said, all can tip the scale
one way or another.
"It makes a huge difference for gay ath
letes to know there are other gay athletes,"
said Sam*. But everv athlete must choose

for himself whether or not to come out.
Brian* said, "Coming out to the team
was the hardest thing I've ever done. I've
never been more nervous or more uncom
fortable doing anything in my life." He
added that it was also the best decision he
could have made.
"You have to weigh your options and
be ready to deal with the consequences,"
said Jason*. "If the team doesn't accept
you for who you are, what are you going to
do? If the team didn't accept me, I was
ready to quit."
Adam* said, "I wouldn't have had as
much fun [if I had not come out], and I
wouldn't have enjoyed it at all - athletics,
that is. I felt that being out allowed me to
express so many other components of my
personality — without that, I wouldn't
have had a strong role at all on the team."
Overtime
For those of us who are not gay ath
letes, it is easy to make the assumption
that gay athletes don't exist. Stereo
types are powerful, and quickly become
entrenched in our brains, no matter how
many times they are disproved, no mat
ter how irrational they are. If you are
like most people, you simply cannot rec
oncile the two seemingly polar social
realms of sports and homosexuality.
The stereotypical guy you envision
when you think of a gay guy — the ef
feminate, loose-wristed man who
sashays and lisps and goes shopping
with his girlfriends — cannot be the
same stereotypical jock who throws a
mean spiral on the football field and
watches ESPN incessantly with his frat
buddies in SAE. According to these
stereotypes, there is no possible way to
bridge the gap. Yet these athletes show
that balance is possible.
Most people assume that gay
men and athletes occupy different
worlds. In high school, we saw the
gays and the jocks (if such groups
existed) eat at different cafeteria ta
bles. Presumably, they hung out in
different crowds, played different
games, watched different TV shows
and preferred different brands of
clothing. They probably laughed at
different kinds of jokes.
According to these same stereo
types, the gays and the athletes at
Stanford live in disconnected
worlds, just as they did back home.
The gays hide away in campus co
ops and athletes set their stakes in
fraternities. At parties, the gays sip
Smirnoff Ice while athletes chug
beer. The gays save their commen
tary for fashion, while the athletes
talk about, well, sports.
The rest of us don't bother to
question whether or not this is the
case. We assume that separateness
between crowds is inevitable, even
natural, and that people are easily
sorted into categories with single
word labels. Gay. Athlete. If we
have just one word to describe or
define a person, then we can make
the following simple inference:
Gays are not athletes, and athletes

varied greatly. Some believed that com
ing out was the only way one could be
happy. Others felt the issue was too com
plex to offer general advice; an athlete's
personality, background and personal cir
cumstances, they said, all can tip the scale
one way or another.
"It makes a huge difference for gay ath
letes to know there are other gay athletes,"
said Sam*. But everv athlete must choose

for himself whether or not to come out.
Brian* said, "Coming out to the team
was the hardest thing I've ever done. I've
never been more nervous or more uncom
fortable doing anything in my life." He
added that it was also the best decision he
could have made.
"You have to weigh your options and
be ready to deal with the consequences,"
said Jason*. "If the team doesn't accept
you for who you are, what are you going to
do? If the team didn't accept me, I was
ready to quit."
Adam* said, "I wouldn't have had as
much fun [if I had not come out], and I
wouldn't have enjoyed it at all - athletics,
that is. I felt that being out allowed me to
express so many other components of my
personality — without that, I wouldn't
have had a strong role at all on the team."
Overtime
For those of us who are not gay ath
letes, it is easy to make the assumption
that gay athletes don't exist. Stereo
types are powerful, and quickly become
entrenched in our brains, no matter how
many times they are disproved, no mat
ter how irrational they are. If you are
like most people, you simply cannot rec
oncile the two seemingly polar social
realms of sports and homosexuality.
The stereotypical guy you envision
when you think of a gay guy — the ef
feminate, loose-wristed man who
sashays and lisps and goes shopping
with his girlfriends — cannot be the
same stereotypical jock who throws a
mean spiral on the football field and
watches ESPN incessantly with his frat
buddies in SAE. According to these
stereotypes, there is no possible way to
bridge the gap. Yet these athletes show
that balance is possible.
Most people assume that gay
men and athletes occupy different
worlds. In high school, we saw the
gays and the jocks (if such groups
existed) eat at different cafeteria ta
bles. Presumably, they hung out in
different crowds, played different
games, watched different TV shows
and preferred different brands of
clothing. They probably laughed at
different kinds of jokes.
According to these same stereo
types, the gays and the athletes at
Stanford live in disconnected
worlds, just as they did back home.
The gays hide away in campus co
ops and athletes set their stakes in
fraternities. At parties, the gays sip
Smirnoff Ice while athletes chug
beer. The gays save their commen
tary for fashion, while the athletes
talk about, well, sports.
The rest of us don't bother to
question whether or not this is the
case. We assume that separateness
between crowds is inevitable, even
natural, and that people are easily
sorted into categories with single
word labels. Gay. Athlete. If we
have just one word to describe or
define a person, then we can make
the following simple inference:
Gays are not athletes, and athletes
are not gay.
Who they are
Nine varsity male athletes from
four different sports, all of whom
are undergraduate students at Stan
ford, offered their opinions about
being gay in college athletics —and
bridging two worlds which do not
naturally blend together. These ath
letes represent a variety of races, re
ligions and socioeconomic back
grounds. A few of them are openly
gay to all of their teammates,
though most are out to only a select
few — or to no teammates at all.
Some acknowledge to anyone who
asks that they are gay, while others
are far more private about their sex
ual orientation and limit talk of their
sexuality to close friends and, in
some cases, relatives. Some have
known for years that they are gay,
while others have come to terms
only recently.
Most of those who interviewed
have chosen to remain anony
mous; and therefore, the sports
teams for which they play are also.
(Pseudonyms have been used to
distinguish the anonymous re
spondents; in such cases, a
pseudonym is identified by an ac
companying asterisk.)

Keeping secrets
The single most important fac
tor that differentiated these nine
athletes from each other was
whether or not they felt they were
keeping a secret from their team.
Those athletes who were the least
secretive — the ones who were
open to their teammates about their
sexuality — were those who spoke
most positively about their experi
ences as a gay athlete.
Adam*, a sophomore who
never hid his sexuality from his
teammates, said, "[Coming out]
was immensely comfortable. 1 was
treated as if 1 was straight. The
more time that went by, the more
happy I was that I was open from
the very beginning."
Brian*, a senior who came out to his
entire team midway through his sports ca
reer, said, "It was much more difficult for

me to be closet
ed than to be
straight. You
have to pre
tend so much. I
couldn't re
spond to com
ments people
made [like gay
jokes and slurs]
because I was
worried about
the repercus
sions."
For those
gay athletes
who weren't
out to their

teammates, anxiety and fear about
being discovered was pervasive.
Jason*, a sophomore who only re
cently came out, said, "It's easier for
me if guys don't know I'm gay be
cause, if they know I'm gay, they
could take it the wrong way."
"[Being in the closet] is diffi
cult," said Gary*, a senior. "There is
such a big assumption that I'm
straight, and I'm afraid of what
would happen — the reaction of the
teammates and coaches — if I came
out."
"Coaches and teammates still
make gay jokes, like limp wrist
jokes," said Paul*, a freshman, of
fering one explanation for why he
has chosen to not yet come out.
Breaking the news
Normal students typically have
more control over the process of
coming out because they can selec
tively choose who knows they are
gay. But sports teams are known for
being tight-knit; they are small, in
sulated communities in which se

crets are discouraged, and personal
identity is inextricably linked with
team identity. Because of this stan
dard, it can be difficult for gay ath
letes to pick and choose certain
teammates to come out to. Telling
one is telling all.
Last year, Jason* started dating
his first boyfriend, and he shared
this information with one teammate
and a few other friends. He never in
tended for this information to make
its way to "at least half" of his team,
he says, but "somehow people just
found out."
Similarly, Gary* feels that he is
losing the ability to stay in control of
who knows he is gay. "More and
more people around campus are
finding out about me," he said, "and
as more and more people find out, I
think it's inevitable [my teammates
will find out too]."
When junior Guillermo Vargas

played for the
track and field
team during
his freshman
year, he was in
the closet. He
said, "I was
very paranoid
throughout the
entire year. My
worst case sce
nario was hav
ing my team
find out that I
was gay before
I told them be
cause it would

allow them to make judgments about
me."
Despite his fears, when Vargas ulti
mately came out, "they were very recep
tive and supportive."
The positive responses heard
from Adam* and Brian* contrast
with the more complicated stories
of Gary*, Jason* and Vargas. It
should be noted, however, that
Adam and Brian play for the same
team — a team which has histori
cally had openly gay athletes and,
through necessity, learned to deal
with the issue. Adam said, "We al
ready had a semi-queer contingent
on the team, which definitely paved
the way for people to have open at
titudes."
Fearing the team
The vast majority of athletic
teams never have dealt with an
openly gay athlete. Dwight Slater,
Class of 2002, was a freshman red
shirting with the Stanford football
team in 1998 when his team learned
At the time, I honestly didn't feel I

had a choice but to leave the team,"
he said. Even after he left, he con
tinued hearing stories about former
teammates telling ongoing jokes
about him.
Slater's experience, which re
ceived significant publicity in the
late '90s, highlights the fact that
gay athletes often faced a danger
of rejection. They can be rejected
by their teammates and coaches,
and forced or coerced to leave
their teams.
When asked whether he be
lieved a student at Stanford, often
called a liberal university, could be
kicked off a team for being gay,
Gary* responded with an emphat
ic yes.
"Stanford really is just a collec
tion of people from all over the
country, and while a lot of people
who come here are more open
minded. there are still people here,
coaches and administrators, who
bring with them past prejudices and
preconceived notions of what an
athlete should be and what an ath
lete can and cannot be.
"And 1 think there are cases
where it's so ingrained in a coach or
administrator's head, where they
feel in order to protect the program,
they may have to sacrifice an individ
ual," Gary* continued. "But they
would not say they kicked him off for
being gay, they would say, 'You've
lost intensity, you've lost desire.' "
Many closeted gay athletes did
not express fears of being kicked
off; more common were fears of los
ing friends, respect or social stand
ing. Sam* and Paul* are gay and are
on the same varsity team, although
they are not out to other teammates.
No member of their team is openly
gay, but they do not discount the
possibility that someone could
come out and be accepted. Sam*
said, "I think people's perceptions
of you would change [if they found
out are gay], but it would be tempo
rary." He added, "I feel like you
need someone brave to make peo
ple start seeing things different."
Sam* and Paul* suggested that
better athletes are more likely to be
accepted by teammates. The star
athlete who comes out would be
more likely to remain on a team
than an athlete who spends most his
time at the sideline, because, said
Paul, "ultimately, we still need you
for nationals."
Team dynamics
Dan Trupin, a junior on Stan-

ford's swimming team, is out to his team,
and speaks positively of his time with his
teammates and coaches. However, he ac
knowledges that openly gay athletes face as
many challenges as closeted ones — they
are merely different challenges. He men
tions the possibility of becoming isolated,
or risking the disappointment, bitterness or
anger of teammates.
"As an athlete, you are supposed to fit
within a mold. You have to break out of
that mold to come out."
While "breaking out of a mold" may
sound liberating, it runs against the per
ception of unity many teams depend on.
Gary* said, "The dynamic of a team is
closely related to how comfortable
teammates feel with one another. Team
mates are expected to hold similar be
liefs and views. The thought that some
one on the team is not being honest
messes with the concept of a team. If the
individual members of the group are not
all working and thinking alike, then the
team is weaker."
Closeted athletes worry that if they
come out, their teammates may misinter
pret their intention for playing sports as
being sexual. Both on and off the field,
teammates share close personal space —
locker rooms, showers, hotel rooms —
and straight athletes may feel uncomfort
able if they believe a teammate regards in
them sexually.
Interestingly, not a single respondent
said that they view their teammates in sexu
al terms. "I don't look at my teammates like

that," said Trupin.
"All I'm thinking about is the athletic as
pect of it," said Gary*. "It's not like I'm look
ing around, trying to get someone's number
or meet someone, anything like that."
Vargas, a former track and field
team member, participated in varsity
basketball and soccer teams in high
school. He noted that certain sports
place more emphasis on being seen as
masculine and overtly heterosexual. He
said, "The level of contact and physical
interaction between athletes makes a
difference in the degree of homophobia
in a sport. Those sports that rely heavily
on a team dynamic, like basketball or
soccer, have more [homophobia] than
sports in which individuals compete on
their own — sports like swimming, track
or tennis."
Jason*, whose sport requires team
mates and opponents to come in physical
contact with each other frequently, feels
that gay athletes in close-contact team
sports have a greater difficulty coming out
to teammates than athletes in other, less
contact-heavy sports. He said, "Sports that
have more physical contact make it harder
for someone to acknowledge that they're
gay because there's the issue of a guy touch
ing another guy."
Slater, speaking from personal experi
ence on the football team, corroborated the
sentiments of Vargas and Jason*.
"I think there are just as many [gay
guys] in team sports as in individual sports.
It is just a much bigger deal [for them to
come out], I knew of other persons on the
team while I was there. It was more than
just me. I wasn't the only one."
The whole world knows
Gay college athletes who come out
may also bear the burden of angering

teammates because rumors of an athlete's
homosexuality inevitably spread to other
colleges. It is common for athletes and
coaches at rival schools to use such infor
mation as fodder for ridicule and derision
of a school's athletic program. "Had I
stayed on the football team, we would
have become the 'gay football team,' "
said Slater.
"Other teams love to use the fact that
we have openly gay athletes as an anti-re
cruiting technique," Trupin said. Anti-re
cruiting refers to the practice that coaches
and athletics programs often employ to dis
suade recruits from attending the sports
programs of rival schools.
Brian* echoed the feeling that athletes
who play intercollegiate sports must accept
that if they come out, people beyond the
borders of their own campus will find out.
He said, "You aren't coming out to just
your team or a few people; you're coming
out to your entire sport."
"A normal student who is coming out
isn't going to have other people across the
country talking shit about them," said
Trupin, referring to the magnified level of
speculation, gossip and discrimination that
gay athletes may encounter from rival ath
letes, coaches and complete strangers if
they come out.
The bad and the good
Beyond the risks of encountering dis
crimination, ridicule or social ostracism,
gay athletes may even lose the ability to
play sports altogether — or even go to col
lege. The worst case scenario is when an
athlete loses a scholarship.
Such was the case for Slater, who lost his
football scholarship when he left the team;
he chose to take out student loans and work
his way through Stanford. Today, as he at
tends law school at Emory University, he

still feels frustrated that he must pay thou
sands of dollars of student loan debt.
"In retrospect, I would have thought
longer and harder about leaving the
team, because 1 lost the scholarship,"
Slater said, "but I probably would have
done it anyway."
For some gay athletes, coming out
can be career-ending in the worst cases;
still, many acknowledge that coming
out leads to an improved ability to per
form athletically.
"Think about it," Gary* said. "If
you're devoting a quarter of your energy
to staying in the closet, that's a quarter of
your energy that you're not putting to
wards your sport. [Before I came out], I
spent so much time thinking about
whether or not I was gay that I got sick,
couldn't eat and basically missed an entire
year of competition."
Gary's experience was affirmed by
other athletes, who reported that their ath
leticism suffered during periods in which
they were most preoccupied with ques
tions about — or concerns with hiding —
their homosexuality.
To come out or not?
Ultimately, the question of whether
or not to come out to one's team is fraught
with complexity. When asked to offer ad
vice on what a gay athlete should do —
come out or not come out — responses
varied greatly. Some believed that com
ing out was the only way one could be
happy. Others felt the issue was too com
plex to offer general advice; an athlete's
personality, background and personal cir
cumstances, they said, all can tip the scale
one way or another.
"It makes a huge difference for gay ath
letes to know there are other gay athletes,"
said Sam*. But everv athlete must choose

for himself whether or not to come out.
Brian* said, "Coming out to the team
was the hardest thing I've ever done. I've
never been more nervous or more uncom
fortable doing anything in my life." He
added that it was also the best decision he
could have made.
"You have to weigh your options and
be ready to deal with the consequences,"
said Jason*. "If the team doesn't accept
you for who you are, what are you going to
do? If the team didn't accept me, I was
ready to quit."
Adam* said, "I wouldn't have had as
much fun [if I had not come out], and I
wouldn't have enjoyed it at all - athletics,
that is. I felt that being out allowed me to
express so many other components of my
personality — without that, I wouldn't
have had a strong role at all on the team."

He said, "You aren't coming out to just
your team or a few people; you're coming
out to your entire sport."
"A normal student who is coming out
isn't going to have other people across the
country talking shit about them," said
Trupin, referring to the magnified level of
speculation, gossip and discrimination that
gay athletes may encounter from rival ath
letes, coaches and complete strangers if
they come out.
The bad and the good
Beyond the risks of encountering dis
crimination, ridicule or social ostracism,
gay athletes may even lose the ability to
play sports altogether — or even go to col
lege. The worst case scenario is when an
athlete loses a scholarship.
Such was the case for Slater, who lost his
football scholarship when he left the team;
he chose to take out student loans and work
his way through Stanford. Today, as he at
tends law school at Emory University, he

still feels frustrated that he must pay thou
sands of dollars of student loan debt.
"In retrospect, I would have thought
longer and harder about leaving the
team, because 1 lost the scholarship,"
Slater said, "but I probably would have
done it anyway."
For some gay athletes, coming out
can be career-ending in the worst cases;
still, many acknowledge that coming
out leads to an improved ability to per
form athletically.
"Think about it," Gary* said. "If
you're devoting a quarter of your energy
to staying in the closet, that's a quarter of
your energy that you're not putting to
wards your sport. [Before I came out], I
spent so much time thinking about
whether or not I was gay that I got sick,
couldn't eat and basically missed an entire
year of competition."
Gary's experience was affirmed by
other athletes, who reported that their ath
leticism suffered during periods in which
they were most preoccupied with ques
tions about — or concerns with hiding —
their homosexuality.
To come out or not?
Ultimately, the question of whether
or not to come out to one's team is fraught
with complexity. When asked to offer ad
vice on what a gay athlete should do —
come out or not come out — responses
varied greatly. Some believed that com
ing out was the only way one could be
happy. Others felt the issue was too com
plex to offer general advice; an athlete's
personality, background and personal cir
cumstances, they said, all can tip the scale
one way or another.
"It makes a huge difference for gay ath
letes to know there are other gay athletes,"
said Sam*. But everv athlete must choose

for himself whether or not to come out.
Brian* said, "Coming out to the team
was the hardest thing I've ever done. I've
never been more nervous or more uncom
fortable doing anything in my life." He
added that it was also the best decision he
could have made.
"You have to weigh your options and
be ready to deal with the consequences,"
said Jason*. "If the team doesn't accept
you for who you are, what are you going to
do? If the team didn't accept me, I was
ready to quit."
Adam* said, "I wouldn't have had as
much fun [if I had not come out], and I
wouldn't have enjoyed it at all - athletics,
that is. I felt that being out allowed me to
express so many other components of my
personality — without that, I wouldn't
have had a strong role at all on the team."
Overtime
For those of us who are not gay ath
letes, it is easy to make the assumption
that gay athletes don't exist. Stereo
types are powerful, and quickly become
entrenched in our brains, no matter how
many times they are disproved, no mat
ter how irrational they are. If you are
like most people, you simply cannot rec
oncile the two seemingly polar social
realms of sports and homosexuality.
The stereotypical guy you envision
when you think of a gay guy — the ef
feminate, loose-wristed man who
sashays and lisps and goes shopping
with his girlfriends — cannot be the
same stereotypical jock who throws a
mean spiral on the football field and
watches ESPN incessantly with his frat
buddies in SAE. According to these
stereotypes, there is no possible way to
bridge the gap. Yet these athletes show
that balance is possible.
Most people assume that gay
men and athletes occupy different
worlds. In high school, we saw the
gays and the jocks (if such groups
existed) eat at different cafeteria ta
bles. Presumably, they hung out in
different crowds, played different
games, watched different TV shows
and preferred different brands of
clothing. They probably laughed at
different kinds of jokes.
According to these same stereo
types, the gays and the athletes at
Stanford live in disconnected
worlds, just as they did back home.
The gays hide away in campus co
ops and athletes set their stakes in
fraternities. At parties, the gays sip
Smirnoff Ice while athletes chug
beer. The gays save their commen
tary for fashion, while the athletes
talk about, well, sports.
The rest of us don't bother to
question whether or not this is the
case. We assume that separateness
between crowds is inevitable, even
natural, and that people are easily
sorted into categories with single
word labels. Gay. Athlete. If we
have just one word to describe or
define a person, then we can make
the following simple inference:
Gays are not athletes, and athletes
are not gay.
Who they are
Nine varsity male athletes from
four different sports, all of whom
are undergraduate students at Stan
ford, offered their opinions about
being gay in college athletics —and
bridging two worlds which do not
naturally blend together. These ath
letes represent a variety of races, re
ligions and socioeconomic back
grounds. A few of them are openly
gay to all of their teammates,
though most are out to only a select
few — or to no teammates at all.
Some acknowledge to anyone who
asks that they are gay, while others
are far more private about their sex
ual orientation and limit talk of their
sexuality to close friends and, in
some cases, relatives. Some have
known for years that they are gay,
while others have come to terms
only recently.
Most of those who interviewed
have chosen to remain anony
mous; and therefore, the sports
teams for which they play are also.
(Pseudonyms have been used to
distinguish the anonymous re
spondents; in such cases, a
pseudonym is identified by an ac
companying asterisk.)

Keeping secrets
The single most important fac
tor that differentiated these nine
athletes from each other was
whether or not they felt they were
keeping a secret from their team.
Those athletes who were the least
secretive — the ones who were
open to their teammates about their
sexuality — were those who spoke
most positively about their experi
ences as a gay athlete.
Adam*, a sophomore who
never hid his sexuality from his
teammates, said, "[Coming out]
was immensely comfortable. 1 was
treated as if 1 was straight. The
more time that went by, the more
happy I was that I was open from
the very beginning."
Brian*, a senior who came out to his
entire team midway through his sports ca
reer, said, "It was much more difficult for

me to be closet
ed than to be
straight. You
have to pre
tend so much. I
couldn't re
spond to com
ments people
made [like gay
jokes and slurs]
because I was
worried about
the repercus
sions."
For those
gay athletes
who weren't
out to their

teammates, anxiety and fear about
being discovered was pervasive.
Jason*, a sophomore who only re
cently came out, said, "It's easier for
me if guys don't know I'm gay be
cause, if they know I'm gay, they
could take it the wrong way."
"[Being in the closet] is diffi
cult," said Gary*, a senior. "There is
such a big assumption that I'm
straight, and I'm afraid of what
would happen — the reaction of the
teammates and coaches — if I came
out."
"Coaches and teammates still
make gay jokes, like limp wrist
jokes," said Paul*, a freshman, of
fering one explanation for why he
has chosen to not yet come out.
Breaking the news
Normal students typically have
more control over the process of
coming out because they can selec
tively choose who knows they are
gay. But sports teams are known for
being tight-knit; they are small, in
sulated communities in which se

crets are discouraged, and personal
identity is inextricably linked with
team identity. Because of this stan
dard, it can be difficult for gay ath
letes to pick and choose certain
teammates to come out to. Telling
one is telling all.
Last year, Jason* started dating
his first boyfriend, and he shared
this information with one teammate
and a few other friends. He never in
tended for this information to make
its way to "at least half" of his team,
he says, but "somehow people just
found out."
Similarly, Gary* feels that he is
losing the ability to stay in control of
who knows he is gay. "More and
more people around campus are
finding out about me," he said, "and
as more and more people find out, I
think it's inevitable [my teammates
will find out too]."
When junior Guillermo Vargas

played for the
track and field
team during
his freshman
year, he was in
the closet. He
said, "I was
very paranoid
throughout the
entire year. My
worst case sce
nario was hav
ing my team
find out that I
was gay before
I told them be
cause it would

allow them to make judgments about
me."
Despite his fears, when Vargas ulti
mately came out, "they were very recep
tive and supportive."
The positive responses heard
from Adam* and Brian* contrast
with the more complicated stories
of Gary*, Jason* and Vargas. It
should be noted, however, that
Adam and Brian play for the same
team — a team which has histori
cally had openly gay athletes and,
through necessity, learned to deal
with the issue. Adam said, "We al
ready had a semi-queer contingent
on the team, which definitely paved
the way for people to have open at
titudes."
Fearing the team
The vast majority of athletic
teams never have dealt with an
openly gay athlete. Dwight Slater,
Class of 2002, was a freshman red
shirting with the Stanford football
team in 1998 when his team learned
At the time, I honestly didn't feel I

had a choice but to leave the team,"
he said. Even after he left, he con
tinued hearing stories about former
teammates telling ongoing jokes
about him.
Slater's experience, which re
ceived significant publicity in the
late '90s, highlights the fact that
gay athletes often faced a danger
of rejection. They can be rejected
by their teammates and coaches,
and forced or coerced to leave
their teams.
When asked whether he be
lieved a student at Stanford, often
called a liberal university, could be
kicked off a team for being gay,
Gary* responded with an emphat
ic yes.
"Stanford really is just a collec
tion of people from all over the
country, and while a lot of people
who come here are more open
minded. there are still people here,
coaches and administrators, who
bring with them past prejudices and
preconceived notions of what an
athlete should be and what an ath
lete can and cannot be.
"And 1 think there are cases
where it's so ingrained in a coach or
administrator's head, where they
feel in order to protect the program,
they may have to sacrifice an individ
ual," Gary* continued. "But they
would not say they kicked him off for
being gay, they would say, 'You've
lost intensity, you've lost desire.' "
Many closeted gay athletes did
not express fears of being kicked
off; more common were fears of los
ing friends, respect or social stand
ing. Sam* and Paul* are gay and are
on the same varsity team, although
they are not out to other teammates.
No member of their team is openly
gay, but they do not discount the
possibility that someone could
come out and be accepted. Sam*
said, "I think people's perceptions
of you would change [if they found
out are gay], but it would be tempo
rary." He added, "I feel like you
need someone brave to make peo
ple start seeing things different."
Sam* and Paul* suggested that
better athletes are more likely to be
accepted by teammates. The star
athlete who comes out would be
more likely to remain on a team
than an athlete who spends most his
time at the sideline, because, said
Paul, "ultimately, we still need you
for nationals."
Team dynamics
Dan Trupin, a junior on Stan-

ford's swimming team, is out to his team,
and speaks positively of his time with his
teammates and coaches. However, he ac
knowledges that openly gay athletes face as
many challenges as closeted ones — they
are merely different challenges. He men
tions the possibility of becoming isolated,
or risking the disappointment, bitterness or
anger of teammates.
"As an athlete, you are supposed to fit
within a mold. You have to break out of
that mold to come out."
While "breaking out of a mold" may
sound liberating, it runs against the per
ception of unity many teams depend on.
Gary* said, "The dynamic of a team is
closely related to how comfortable
teammates feel with one another. Team
mates are expected to hold similar be
liefs and views. The thought that some
one on the team is not being honest
messes with the concept of a team. If the
individual members of the group are not
all working and thinking alike, then the
team is weaker."
Closeted athletes worry that if they
come out, their teammates may misinter
pret their intention for playing sports as
being sexual. Both on and off the field,
teammates share close personal space —
locker rooms, showers, hotel rooms —
and straight athletes may feel uncomfort
able if they believe a teammate regards in
them sexually.
Interestingly, not a single respondent
said that they view their teammates in sexu
al terms. "I don't look at my teammates like

that," said Trupin.
"All I'm thinking about is the athletic as
pect of it," said Gary*. "It's not like I'm look
ing around, trying to get someone's number
or meet someone, anything like that."
Vargas, a former track and field
team member, participated in varsity
basketball and soccer teams in high
school. He noted that certain sports
place more emphasis on being seen as
masculine and overtly heterosexual. He
said, "The level of contact and physical
interaction between athletes makes a
difference in the degree of homophobia
in a sport. Those sports that rely heavily
on a team dynamic, like basketball or
soccer, have more [homophobia] than
sports in which individuals compete on
their own — sports like swimming, track
or tennis."
Jason*, whose sport requires team
mates and opponents to come in physical
contact with each other frequently, feels
that gay athletes in close-contact team
sports have a greater difficulty coming out
to teammates than athletes in other, less
contact-heavy sports. He said, "Sports that
have more physical contact make it harder
for someone to acknowledge that they're
gay because there's the issue of a guy touch
ing another guy."
Slater, speaking from personal experi
ence on the football team, corroborated the
sentiments of Vargas and Jason*.
"I think there are just as many [gay
guys] in team sports as in individual sports.
It is just a much bigger deal [for them to
come out], I knew of other persons on the
team while I was there. It was more than
just me. I wasn't the only one."
The whole world knows
Gay college athletes who come out
may also bear the burden of angering

teammates because rumors of an athlete's
homosexuality inevitably spread to other
colleges. It is common for athletes and
coaches at rival schools to use such infor
mation as fodder for ridicule and derision
of a school's athletic program. "Had I
stayed on the football team, we would
have become the 'gay football team,' "
said Slater.
"Other teams love to use the fact that
we have openly gay athletes as an anti-re
cruiting technique," Trupin said. Anti-re
cruiting refers to the practice that coaches
and athletics programs often employ to dis
suade recruits from attending the sports
programs of rival schools.
Brian* echoed the feeling that athletes
who play intercollegiate sports must accept
that if they come out, people beyond the
borders of their own campus will find out.
He said, "You aren't coming out to just
your team or a few people; you're coming
out to your entire sport."
"A normal student who is coming out
isn't going to have other people across the
country talking shit about them," said
Trupin, referring to the magnified level of
speculation, gossip and discrimination that
gay athletes may encounter from rival ath
letes, coaches and complete strangers if
they come out.
The bad and the good
Beyond the risks of encountering dis
crimination, ridicule or social ostracism,
gay athletes may even lose the ability to
play sports altogether — or even go to col
lege. The worst case scenario is when an
athlete loses a scholarship.
Such was the case for Slater, who lost his
football scholarship when he left the team;
he chose to take out student loans and work
his way through Stanford. Today, as he at
tends law school at Emory University, he

still feels frustrated that he must pay thou
sands of dollars of student loan debt.
"In retrospect, I would have thought
longer and harder about leaving the
team, because 1 lost the scholarship,"
Slater said, "but I probably would have
done it anyway."
For some gay athletes, coming out
can be career-ending in the worst cases;
still, many acknowledge that coming
out leads to an improved ability to per
form athletically.
"Think about it," Gary* said. "If
you're devoting a quarter of your energy
to staying in the closet, that's a quarter of
your energy that you're not putting to
wards your sport. [Before I came out], I
spent so much time thinking about
whether or not I was gay that I got sick,
couldn't eat and basically missed an entire

team member, participated in varsity
basketball and soccer teams in high
school. He noted that certain sports
place more emphasis on being seen as
masculine and overtly heterosexual. He
said, "The level of contact and physical
interaction between athletes makes a
difference in the degree of homophobia
in a sport. Those sports that rely heavily
on a team dynamic, like basketball or
soccer, have more [homophobia] than
sports in which individuals compete on
their own — sports like swimming, track
or tennis."
Jason*, whose sport requires team
mates and opponents to come in physical
contact with each other frequently, feels
that gay athletes in close-contact team
sports have a greater difficulty coming out
to teammates than athletes in other, less
contact-heavy sports. He said, "Sports that
have more physical contact make it harder
for someone to acknowledge that they're
gay because there's the issue of a guy touch
ing another guy."
Slater, speaking from personal experi
ence on the football team, corroborated the
sentiments of Vargas and Jason*.
"I think there are just as many [gay
guys] in team sports as in individual sports.
It is just a much bigger deal [for them to
come out], I knew of other persons on the
team while I was there. It was more than
just me. I wasn't the only one."
The whole world knows
Gay college athletes who come out
may also bear the burden of angering

teammates because rumors of an athlete's
homosexuality inevitably spread to other
colleges. It is common for athletes and
coaches at rival schools to use such infor
mation as fodder for ridicule and derision
of a school's athletic program. "Had I
stayed on the football team, we would
have become the 'gay football team,' "
said Slater.
"Other teams love to use the fact that
we have openly gay athletes as an anti-re
cruiting technique," Trupin said. Anti-re
cruiting refers to the practice that coaches
and athletics programs often employ to dis
suade recruits from attending the sports
programs of rival schools.
Brian* echoed the feeling that athletes
who play intercollegiate sports must accept
that if they come out, people beyond the
borders of their own campus will find out.
He said, "You aren't coming out to just
your team or a few people; you're coming
out to your entire sport."
"A normal student who is coming out
isn't going to have other people across the
country talking shit about them," said
Trupin, referring to the magnified level of
speculation, gossip and discrimination that
gay athletes may encounter from rival ath
letes, coaches and complete strangers if
they come out.
The bad and the good
Beyond the risks of encountering dis
crimination, ridicule or social ostracism,
gay athletes may even lose the ability to
play sports altogether — or even go to col
lege. The worst case scenario is when an
athlete loses a scholarship.
Such was the case for Slater, who lost his
football scholarship when he left the team;
he chose to take out student loans and work
his way through Stanford. Today, as he at
tends law school at Emory University, he

still feels frustrated that he must pay thou
sands of dollars of student loan debt.
"In retrospect, I would have thought
longer and harder about leaving the
team, because 1 lost the scholarship,"
Slater said, "but I probably would have
done it anyway."
For some gay athletes, coming out
can be career-ending in the worst cases;
still, many acknowledge that coming
out leads to an improved ability to per
form athletically.
"Think about it," Gary* said. "If
you're devoting a quarter of your energy
to staying in the closet, that's a quarter of
your energy that you're not putting to
wards your sport. [Before I came out], I
spent so much time thinking about
whether or not I was gay that I got sick,
couldn't eat and basically missed an entire
year of competition."
Gary's experience was affirmed by
other athletes, who reported that their ath
leticism suffered during periods in which
they were most preoccupied with ques
tions about — or concerns with hiding —
their homosexuality.
To come out or not?
Ultimately, the question of whether
or not to come out to one's team is fraught
with complexity. When asked to offer ad
vice on what a gay athlete should do —
come out or not come out — responses
varied greatly. Some believed that com
ing out was the only way one could be
happy. Others felt the issue was too com
plex to offer general advice; an athlete's
personality, background and personal cir
cumstances, they said, all can tip the scale
one way or another.
"It makes a huge difference for gay ath
letes to know there are other gay athletes,"
said Sam*. But everv athlete must choose

for himself whether or not to come out.
Brian* said, "Coming out to the team
was the hardest thing I've ever done. I've
never been more nervous or more uncom
fortable doing anything in my life." He
added that it was also the best decision he
could have made.
"You have to weigh your options and
be ready to deal with the consequences,"
said Jason*. "If the team doesn't accept
you for who you are, what are you going to
do? If the team didn't accept me, I was
ready to quit."
Adam* said, "I wouldn't have had as
much fun [if I had not come out], and I
wouldn't have enjoyed it at all - athletics,
that is. I felt that being out allowed me to
express so many other components of my
personality — without that, I wouldn't
have had a strong role at all on the team."
Overtime
For those of us who are not gay ath
letes, it is easy to make the assumption
that gay athletes don't exist. Stereo
types are powerful, and quickly become
entrenched in our brains, no matter how
many times they are disproved, no mat
ter how irrational they are. If you are
like most people, you simply cannot rec
oncile the two seemingly polar social
realms of sports and homosexuality.
The stereotypical guy you envision
when you think of a gay guy — the ef
feminate, loose-wristed man who
sashays and lisps and goes shopping
with his girlfriends — cannot be the
same stereotypical jock who throws a
mean spiral on the football field and
watches ESPN incessantly with his frat
buddies in SAE. According to these
stereotypes, there is no possible way to
bridge the gap. Yet these athletes show
that balance is possible.
Most people assume that gay
men and athletes occupy different
worlds. In high school, we saw the
gays and the jocks (if such groups
existed) eat at different cafeteria ta
bles. Presumably, they hung out in
different crowds, played different
games, watched different TV shows
and preferred different brands of
clothing. They probably laughed at
different kinds of jokes.
According to these same stereo
types, the gays and the athletes at
Stanford live in disconnected
worlds, just as they did back home.
The gays hide away in campus co
ops and athletes set their stakes in
fraternities. At parties, the gays sip
Smirnoff Ice while athletes chug
beer. The gays save their commen
tary for fashion, while the athletes
talk about, well, sports.
The rest of us don't bother to
question whether or not this is the
case. We assume that separateness
between crowds is inevitable, even
natural, and that people are easily
sorted into categories with single
word labels. Gay. Athlete. If we
have just one word to describe or
define a person, then we can make
the following simple inference:
Gays are not athletes, and athletes
are not gay.
Who they are
Nine varsity male athletes from
four different sports, all of whom
are undergraduate students at Stan
ford, offered their opinions about
being gay in college athletics —and
bridging two worlds which do not
naturally blend together. These ath
letes represent a variety of races, re
ligions and socioeconomic back
grounds. A few of them are openly
gay to all of their teammates,
though most are out to only a select
few — or to no teammates at all.
Some acknowledge to anyone who
asks that they are gay, while others
are far more private about their sex
ual orientation and limit talk of their
sexuality to close friends and, in
some cases, relatives. Some have
known for years that they are gay,
while others have come to terms
only recently.
Most of those who interviewed
have chosen to remain anony
mous; and therefore, the sports
teams for which they play are also.
(Pseudonyms have been used to
distinguish the anonymous re
spondents; in such cases, a
pseudonym is identified by an ac
companying asterisk.)

Keeping secrets
The single most important fac
tor that differentiated these nine
athletes from each other was
whether or not they felt they were
keeping a secret from their team.
Those athletes who were the least
secretive — the ones who were
open to their teammates about their
sexuality — were those who spoke
most positively about their experi
ences as a gay athlete.
Adam*, a sophomore who
never hid his sexuality from his
teammates, said, "[Coming out]
was immensely comfortable. 1 was
treated as if 1 was straight. The
more time that went by, the more
happy I was that I was open from
the very beginning."
Brian*, a senior who came out to his
entire team midway through his sports ca
reer, said, "It was much more difficult for

me to be closet
ed than to be
straight. You
have to pre
tend so much. I
couldn't re
spond to com
ments people
made [like gay
jokes and slurs]
because I was
worried about
the repercus
sions."
For those
gay athletes
who weren't
out to their

teammates, anxiety and fear about
being discovered was pervasive.
Jason*, a sophomore who only re
cently came out, said, "It's easier for
me if guys don't know I'm gay be
cause, if they know I'm gay, they
could take it the wrong way."
"[Being in the closet] is diffi
cult," said Gary*, a senior. "There is
such a big assumption that I'm
straight, and I'm afraid of what
would happen — the reaction of the
teammates and coaches — if I came
out."
"Coaches and teammates still
make gay jokes, like limp wrist
jokes," said Paul*, a freshman, of
fering one explanation for why he
has chosen to not yet come out.
Breaking the news
Normal students typically have
more control over the process of
coming out because they can selec
tively choose who knows they are
gay. But sports teams are known for
being tight-knit; they are small, in
sulated communities in which se

crets are discouraged, and personal
identity is inextricably linked with
team identity. Because of this stan
dard, it can be difficult for gay ath
letes to pick and choose certain
teammates to come out to. Telling
one is telling all.
Last year, Jason* started dating
his first boyfriend, and he shared
this information with one teammate
and a few other friends. He never in
tended for this information to make
its way to "at least half" of his team,
he says, but "somehow people just
found out."
Similarly, Gary* feels that he is
losing the ability to stay in control of
who knows he is gay. "More and
more people around campus are
finding out about me," he said, "and
as more and more people find out, I
think it's inevitable [my teammates
will find out too]."
When junior Guillermo Vargas

played for the
track and field
team during
his freshman
year, he was in
the closet. He
said, "I was
very paranoid
throughout the
entire year. My
worst case sce
nario was hav
ing my team
find out that I
was gay before
I told them be
cause it would

allow them to make judgments about
me."
Despite his fears, when Vargas ulti
mately came out, "they were very recep
tive and supportive."
The positive responses heard
from Adam* and Brian* contrast
with the more complicated stories
of Gary*, Jason* and Vargas. It
should be noted, however, that
Adam and Brian play for the same
team — a team which has histori
cally had openly gay athletes and,
through necessity, learned to deal
with the issue. Adam said, "We al
ready had a semi-queer contingent
on the team, which definitely paved
the way for people to have open at
titudes."
Fearing the team
The vast majority of athletic
teams never have dealt with an
openly gay athlete. Dwight Slater,
Class of 2002, was a freshman red
shirting with the Stanford football
team in 1998 when his team learned
At the time, I honestly didn't feel I

had a choice but to leave the team,"
he said. Even after he left, he con
tinued hearing stories about former
teammates telling ongoing jokes
about him.
Slater's experience, which re
ceived significant publicity in the
late '90s, highlights the fact that
gay athletes often faced a danger
of rejection. They can be rejected
by their teammates and coaches,
and forced or coerced to leave
their teams.
When asked whether he be
lieved a student at Stanford, often
called a liberal university, could be
kicked off a team for being gay,
Gary* responded with an emphat
ic yes.
"Stanford really is just a collec
tion of people from all over the
country, and while a lot of people
who come here are more open
minded. there are still people here,
coaches and administrators, who
bring with them past prejudices and
preconceived notions of what an
athlete should be and what an ath
lete can and cannot be.
"And 1 think there are cases
where it's so ingrained in a coach or
administrator's head, where they
feel in order to protect the program,
they may have to sacrifice an individ
ual," Gary* continued. "But they
would not say they kicked him off for
being gay, they would say, 'You've
lost intensity, you've lost desire.' "
Many closeted gay athletes did
not express fears of being kicked
off; more common were fears of los
ing friends, respect or social stand
ing. Sam* and Paul* are gay and are
on the same varsity team, although
they are not out to other teammates.
No member of their team is openly
gay, but they do not discount the
possibility that someone could
come out and be accepted. Sam*
said, "I think people's perceptions
of you would change [if they found
out are gay], but it would be tempo
rary." He added, "I feel like you
need someone brave to make peo
ple start seeing things different."
Sam* and Paul* suggested that
better athletes are more likely to be
accepted by teammates. The star
athlete who comes out would be
more likely to remain on a team
than an athlete who spends most his
time at the sideline, because, said
Paul, "ultimately, we still need you
for nationals."
Team dynamics
Dan Trupin, a junior on Stan-

ford's swimming team, is out to his team,
and speaks positively of his time with his
teammates and coaches. However, he ac
knowledges that openly gay athletes face as
many challenges as closeted ones — they
are merely different challenges. He men
tions the possibility of becoming isolated,
or risking the disappointment, bitterness or
anger of teammates.
"As an athlete, you are supposed to fit
within a mold. You have to break out of
that mold to come out."
While "breaking out of a mold" may
sound liberating, it runs against the per
ception of unity many teams depend on.
Gary* said, "The dynamic of a team is
closely related to how comfortable
teammates feel with one another. Team
mates are expected to hold similar be
liefs and views. The thought that some
one on the team is not being honest
messes with the concept of a team. If the
individual members of the group are not
all working and thinking alike, then the
team is weaker."
Closeted athletes worry that if they
come out, their teammates may misinter
pret their intention for playing sports as
being sexual. Both on and off the field,
teammates share close personal space —
locker rooms, showers, hotel rooms —
and straight athletes may feel uncomfort
able if they believe a teammate regards in
them sexually.
Interestingly, not a single respondent
said that they view their teammates in sexu
al terms. "I don't look at my teammates like

that," said Trupin.
"All I'm thinking about is the athletic as
pect of it," said Gary*. "It's not like I'm look
ing around, trying to get someone's number
or meet someone, anything like that."
Vargas, a former track and field
team member, participated in varsity
basketball and soccer teams in high
school. He noted that certain sports
place more emphasis on being seen as
masculine and overtly heterosexual. He
said, "The level of contact and physical
interaction between athletes makes a
difference in the degree of homophobia
in a sport. Those sports that rely heavily
on a team dynamic, like basketball or
soccer, have more [homophobia] than
sports in which individuals compete on
their own — sports like swimming, track

rary." He added, "I feel like you
need someone brave to make peo
ple start seeing things different."
Sam* and Paul* suggested that
better athletes are more likely to be
accepted by teammates. The star
athlete who comes out would be
more likely to remain on a team
than an athlete who spends most his
time at the sideline, because, said
Paul, "ultimately, we still need you
for nationals."
Team dynamics
Dan Trupin, a junior on Stan-

ford's swimming team, is out to his team,
and speaks positively of his time with his
teammates and coaches. However, he ac
knowledges that openly gay athletes face as
many challenges as closeted ones — they
are merely different challenges. He men
tions the possibility of becoming isolated,
or risking the disappointment, bitterness or
anger of teammates.
"As an athlete, you are supposed to fit
within a mold. You have to break out of
that mold to come out."
While "breaking out of a mold" may
sound liberating, it runs against the per
ception of unity many teams depend on.
Gary* said, "The dynamic of a team is
closely related to how comfortable
teammates feel with one another. Team
mates are expected to hold similar be
liefs and views. The thought that some
one on the team is not being honest
messes with the concept of a team. If the
individual members of the group are not
all working and thinking alike, then the
team is weaker."
Closeted athletes worry that if they
come out, their teammates may misinter
pret their intention for playing sports as
being sexual. Both on and off the field,
teammates share close personal space —
locker rooms, showers, hotel rooms —
and straight athletes may feel uncomfort
able if they believe a teammate regards in
them sexually.
Interestingly, not a single respondent
said that they view their teammates in sexu
al terms. "I don't look at my teammates like

that," said Trupin.
"All I'm thinking about is the athletic as
pect of it," said Gary*. "It's not like I'm look
ing around, trying to get someone's number
or meet someone, anything like that."
Vargas, a former track and field
team member, participated in varsity
basketball and soccer teams in high
school. He noted that certain sports
place more emphasis on being seen as
masculine and overtly heterosexual. He
said, "The level of contact and physical
interaction between athletes makes a
difference in the degree of homophobia
in a sport. Those sports that rely heavily
on a team dynamic, like basketball or
soccer, have more [homophobia] than
sports in which individuals compete on
their own — sports like swimming, track
or tennis."
Jason*, whose sport requires team
mates and opponents to come in physical
contact with each other frequently, feels
that gay athletes in close-contact team
sports have a greater difficulty coming out
to teammates than athletes in other, less
contact-heavy sports. He said, "Sports that
have more physical contact make it harder
for someone to acknowledge that they're
gay because there's the issue of a guy touch
ing another guy."
Slater, speaking from personal experi
ence on the football team, corroborated the
sentiments of Vargas and Jason*.
"I think there are just as many [gay
guys] in team sports as in individual sports.
It is just a much bigger deal [for them to
come out], I knew of other persons on the
team while I was there. It was more than
just me. I wasn't the only one."
The whole world knows
Gay college athletes who come out
may also bear the burden of angering

teammates because rumors of an athlete's
homosexuality inevitably spread to other
colleges. It is common for athletes and
coaches at rival schools to use such infor
mation as fodder for ridicule and derision
of a school's athletic program. "Had I
stayed on the football team, we would
have become the 'gay football team,' "
said Slater.
"Other teams love to use the fact that
we have openly gay athletes as an anti-re
cruiting technique," Trupin said. Anti-re
cruiting refers to the practice that coaches
and athletics programs often employ to dis
suade recruits from attending the sports
programs of rival schools.
Brian* echoed the feeling that athletes
who play intercollegiate sports must accept
that if they come out, people beyond the
borders of their own campus will find out.
He said, "You aren't coming out to just
your team or a few people; you're coming
out to your entire sport."
"A normal student who is coming out
isn't going to have other people across the
country talking shit about them," said
Trupin, referring to the magnified level of
speculation, gossip and discrimination that
gay athletes may encounter from rival ath
letes, coaches and complete strangers if
they come out.
The bad and the good
Beyond the risks of encountering dis
crimination, ridicule or social ostracism,
gay athletes may even lose the ability to
play sports altogether — or even go to col
lege. The worst case scenario is when an
athlete loses a scholarship.
Such was the case for Slater, who lost his
football scholarship when he left the team;
he chose to take out student loans and work
his way through Stanford. Today, as he at
tends law school at Emory University, he

still feels frustrated that he must pay thou
sands of dollars of student loan debt.
"In retrospect, I would have thought
longer and harder about leaving the
team, because 1 lost the scholarship,"
Slater said, "but I probably would have
done it anyway."
For some gay athletes, coming out
can be career-ending in the worst cases;
still, many acknowledge that coming
out leads to an improved ability to per
form athletically.
"Think about it," Gary* said. "If
you're devoting a quarter of your energy
to staying in the closet, that's a quarter of
your energy that you're not putting to
wards your sport. [Before I came out], I
spent so much time thinking about
whether or not I was gay that I got sick,
couldn't eat and basically missed an entire
year of competition."
Gary's experience was affirmed by
other athletes, who reported that their ath
leticism suffered during periods in which
they were most preoccupied with ques
tions about — or concerns with hiding —
their homosexuality.
To come out or not?
Ultimately, the question of whether
or not to come out to one's team is fraught
with complexity. When asked to offer ad
vice on what a gay athlete should do —
come out or not come out — responses
varied greatly. Some believed that com
ing out was the only way one could be
happy. Others felt the issue was too com
plex to offer general advice; an athlete's
personality, background and personal cir
cumstances, they said, all can tip the scale
one way or another.
"It makes a huge difference for gay ath
letes to know there are other gay athletes,"
said Sam*. But everv athlete must choose

for himself whether or not to come out.
Brian* said, "Coming out to the team
was the hardest thing I've ever done. I've
never been more nervous or more uncom
fortable doing anything in my life." He
added that it was also the best decision he
could have made.
"You have to weigh your options and
be ready to deal with the consequences,"
said Jason*. "If the team doesn't accept
you for who you are, what are you going to
do? If the team didn't accept me, I was
ready to quit."
Adam* said, "I wouldn't have had as
much fun [if I had not come out], and I
wouldn't have enjoyed it at all - athletics,
that is. I felt that being out allowed me to
express so many other components of my
personality — without that, I wouldn't
have had a strong role at all on the team."
Overtime
For those of us who are not gay ath
letes, it is easy to make the assumption
that gay athletes don't exist. Stereo
types are powerful, and quickly become
entrenched in our brains, no matter how
many times they are disproved, no mat
ter how irrational they are. If you are
like most people, you simply cannot rec
oncile the two seemingly polar social
realms of sports and homosexuality.
The stereotypical guy you envision
when you think of a gay guy — the ef
feminate, loose-wristed man who
sashays and lisps and goes shopping
with his girlfriends — cannot be the
same stereotypical jock who throws a
mean spiral on the football field and
watches ESPN incessantly with his frat
buddies in SAE. According to these
stereotypes, there is no possible way to
bridge the gap. Yet these athletes show
that balance is possible.
