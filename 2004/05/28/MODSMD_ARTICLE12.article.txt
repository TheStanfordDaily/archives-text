# Gay athletes at Stanford
## Voices from the field 
### MICHAEL DUCA INVESTIGATIVE TEAM LEADER 
Most people assume that gay
men and athletes occupy different
worlds. In high school, we saw the
gays and the jocks (if such groups
existed) eat at different cafeteria ta
bles. Presumably, they hung out in
different crowds, played different
games, watched different TV shows
and preferred different brands of
clothing. They probably laughed at
different kinds of jokes.
According to these same stereo
types, the gays and the athletes at
Stanford live in disconnected
worlds, just as they did back home.
The gays hide away in campus co
ops and athletes set their stakes in
fraternities. At parties, the gays sip
Smirnoff Ice while athletes chug
beer. The gays save their commen
tary for fashion, while the athletes
talk about, well, sports.
The rest of us don't bother to
question whether or not this is the
case. We assume that separateness
between crowds is inevitable, even
natural, and that people are easily
sorted into categories with single
word labels. Gay. Athlete. If we
have just one word to describe or
define a person, then we can make
the following simple inference:
Gays are not athletes, and athletes
are not gay.
Who they are
Nine varsity male athletes from
four different sports, all of whom
are undergraduate students at Stan
ford, offered their opinions about
being gay in college athletics —and
bridging two worlds which do not
naturally blend together. These ath
letes represent a variety of races, re
ligions and socioeconomic back
grounds. A few of them are openly
gay to all of their teammates,
though most are out to only a select
few — or to no teammates at all.
Some acknowledge to anyone who
asks that they are gay, while others
are far more private about their sex
ual orientation and limit talk of their
sexuality to close friends and, in
some cases, relatives. Some have
known for years that they are gay,
while others have come to terms
only recently.
Most of those who interviewed
have chosen to remain anony
mous; and therefore, the sports
teams for which they play are also.
(Pseudonyms have been used to
distinguish the anonymous re
spondents; in such cases, a
pseudonym is identified by an ac
companying asterisk.)

Keeping secrets
The single most important fac
tor that differentiated these nine
athletes from each other was
whether or not they felt they were
keeping a secret from their team.
Those athletes who were the least
secretive — the ones who were
open to their teammates about their
sexuality — were those who spoke
most positively about their experi
ences as a gay athlete.
Adam*, a sophomore who
never hid his sexuality from his
teammates, said, "[Coming out]
was immensely comfortable. 1 was
treated as if 1 was straight. The
more time that went by, the more
happy I was that I was open from
the very beginning."
Brian*, a senior who came out to his
entire team midway through his sports ca
reer, said, "It was much more difficult for

me to be closet
ed than to be
straight. You
have to pre
tend so much. I
couldn't re
spond to com
ments people
made [like gay
jokes and slurs]
because I was
worried about
the repercus
sions."
For those
gay athletes
who weren't
out to their

teammates, anxiety and fear about
being discovered was pervasive.
Jason*, a sophomore who only re
cently came out, said, "It's easier for
me if guys don't know I'm gay be
cause, if they know I'm gay, they
could take it the wrong way."
"[Being in the closet] is diffi
cult," said Gary*, a senior. "There is
such a big assumption that I'm
straight, and I'm afraid of what
would happen — the reaction of the
teammates and coaches — if I came
out."
"Coaches and teammates still
make gay jokes, like limp wrist
jokes," said Paul*, a freshman, of
fering one explanation for why he
has chosen to not yet come out.
Breaking the news
Normal students typically have
more control over the process of
coming out because they can selec
tively choose who knows they are
gay. But sports teams are known for
being tight-knit; they are small, in
sulated communities in which se

crets are discouraged, and personal
identity is inextricably linked with
team identity. Because of this stan
dard, it can be difficult for gay ath
letes to pick and choose certain
teammates to come out to. Telling
one is telling all.
Last year, Jason* started dating
his first boyfriend, and he shared
this information with one teammate
and a few other friends. He never in
tended for this information to make
its way to "at least half" of his team,
he says, but "somehow people just
found out."
Similarly, Gary* feels that he is
losing the ability to stay in control of
who knows he is gay. "More and
more people around campus are
finding out about me," he said, "and
as more and more people find out, I
think it's inevitable [my teammates
will find out too]."
When junior Guillermo Vargas

played for the
track and field
team during
his freshman
year, he was in
the closet. He
said, "I was
very paranoid
throughout the
entire year. My
worst case sce
nario was hav
ing my team
find out that I
was gay before
I told them be
cause it would

allow them to make judgments about
me."
Despite his fears, when Vargas ulti
mately came out, "they were very recep
tive and supportive."
The positive responses heard
from Adam* and Brian* contrast
with the more complicated stories
of Gary*, Jason* and Vargas. It
should be noted, however, that
Adam and Brian play for the same
team — a team which has histori
cally had openly gay athletes and,
through necessity, learned to deal
with the issue. Adam said, "We al
ready had a semi-queer contingent
on the team, which definitely paved
the way for people to have open at
titudes."
Fearing the team
The vast majority of athletic
teams never have dealt with an
openly gay athlete. Dwight Slater,
Class of 2002, was a freshman red
shirting with the Stanford football
team in 1998 when his team learned
At the time, I honestly didn't feel I

had a choice but to leave the team,"
he said. Even after he left, he con
tinued hearing stories about former
teammates telling ongoing jokes
about him.
Slater's experience, which re
ceived significant publicity in the
late '90s, highlights the fact that
gay athletes often faced a danger
of rejection. They can be rejected
by their teammates and coaches,
and forced or coerced to leave
their teams.
When asked whether he be
lieved a student at Stanford, often
called a liberal university, could be
kicked off a team for being gay,
Gary* responded with an emphat
ic yes.
"Stanford really is just a collec
tion of people from all over the
country, and while a lot of people
who come here are more open
minded. there are still people here,
coaches and administrators, who
bring with them past prejudices and
preconceived notions of what an
athlete should be and what an ath
lete can and cannot be.
"And 1 think there are cases
where it's so ingrained in a coach or
administrator's head, where they
feel in order to protect the program,
they may have to sacrifice an individ
ual," Gary* continued. "But they
would not say they kicked him off for
being gay, they would say, 'You've
lost intensity, you've lost desire.' "
Many closeted gay athletes did
not express fears of being kicked
off; more common were fears of los
ing friends, respect or social stand
ing. Sam* and Paul* are gay and are
on the same varsity team, although
they are not out to other teammates.
No member of their team is openly
gay, but they do not discount the
possibility that someone could
come out and be accepted. Sam*
said, "I think people's perceptions
of you would change [if they found
out are gay], but it would be tempo
rary." He added, "I feel like you
need someone brave to make peo
ple start seeing things different."
Sam* and Paul* suggested that
better athletes are more likely to be
accepted by teammates. The star
athlete who comes out would be
more likely to remain on a team
than an athlete who spends most his
time at the sideline, because, said
Paul, "ultimately, we still need you
for nationals."
