## Aid packages need more press 
### 
Earlier this year. Harvard College announced
that parents with incomes of less than $40,000
would not be expected to pay any tuition. Al
though Harvard's proclamation gained much
attention from the media, it was not as grand as it
sounded, because the average contribution required
from parents below that income level was already very
low. In reality, need-blind admission policies are so
widely used that most, if not all, talented low-income
students can now afford to attend top institutions.
Why, then, do only 10 percent of the students at the na
tion's most selective universities come from families in
the lower half of the income spectrum, while 75 percent of
students come from families in the top quarter? The an
swer is that many talented and intellectually curious low
income high school students either do not apply because
they are unaware of the generous financial aid packages,
or, if they do apply, are not admitted because they lack the
preparation that more affluent students have.
ironically, by raising awareness of progressive fi
nancial aid policies, the national attention from Har
vard's announcement will probably benefit low-income
students who attend institutions across the nation.
From almost any perspective, Stanford's financial
aid packages are at least as generous as those at peer in
stitutions. The lowest-income students are only expect-

Ed to contribute $2,250 to their yearly tuition, and the
University provides jobs on campus to help cover even
this amount. Last year, the Financial Aid Office award
ed over $87 million in scholarships and grants to stu
dents. But the University must continue to be proactive
in looking for other ways to attract and prepare stu
dents who may be intimidated by the idea of attending
a selective university.
The low representation of students from financially
disadvantaged backgrounds cannot be solved from
within admission and financial aid departments alone.
Some results can only be achieved by working directly
with schools in low-income areas to improve academic
preparation. However, to raise its own representation,
Stanford should make a greater effort at outreach in its
admission process, including a more aggressive strategy
for recruiting low-income students.
In an interview in Stanford Magazine, Dean of Un
dergraduate Admission and Financial Aid Robin Mam
let responded to Harvard's announcement by saying
that "It would be a mistake to think that we haven't been
quietly doing a lot of good for these families for
decades." This is true, but because part of the problem
is just getting the word out to low-income students about
the affordability of attending college, perhaps the Uni
versity ought to begin doing good a little more loudly.
