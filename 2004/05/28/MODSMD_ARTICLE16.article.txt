# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
Arguments (or living) wage
are unpersuasive
I would like to suggest that The
Daily stop publishing letters that add
nothing to the debate surrounding
the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion's living wage campaign ("Letters
to the editor," May 24, May 26).
Of the fours students who re
sponded to Nate Hilger's op-ed
("Stanford should resist labor action
coalition's living wage campaign,"
May 20), none were able to refute
Hilger's economic analysis. Tristan
Ivory simply asserts that he "doubts"
that nearly doubling the hourly wage
of some workers (from $6.75 to
$13.36, as SLAC proposes) would at
tract more qualified applicants, as if
his personal incredulity negates the
law of supply and demand.
It's true that "justice isn't just
about economic theories." Hilger
himself claimed that "most serious
ethicists agree that all of these low
wage workers deserve greater shares
of the world's resource pie," without
explaining who those serious ethi
cists might be or how they could seri
ously believe that. Unlike Hilger and
his critics, I believe that it is com
pletely ethical for both employers
and workers to freely negotiate for
whatever rate of compensation they
find acceptable.
None of these proponents of min
imum wage or "living wage" policies
have supplied any moral justifica
tion for the notion that we can't
allow employers to decide how to
spend their own money. Presum
ably, SLAC would not support a
maximum wage or outlawing "col
lective bargaining." Apparently, in
SLAC's world, property rights apply
to workers but not employers.
Ivory's trump card, however, is the
"invitation" he extends to anyone
who would dare disagree with him: an
invitation to support themselves off
of a low-skilled job. Well, in his own
words, "irony is bittersweet." Not the

irony of students trying to understand
the economics behind the labor mar
ket without actually living every pos
sible aspect of it, but the irony of Tris
tan Ivory telling me, from the comfort
of the Stanford bubble, that I don't
understand the "real world."
Obviously, he knows me really
well since he's so confident that my
beliefs are the product of ignorance
and that I can't meet his challenge.
But I'm sorry to say that I can. I'm not
proud that I've had to support myself
by manual labor — that was just the
result of some very unfortunate cir
cumstances — but I am proud that I
did so without expecting a handout
from anyone, no matter how bad
things got. Since SLAC presumes to
represent workers in similar circum
stances, I would appreciate it if they
would stop advocating unethical and
economically disastrous policies in
my name.

Stanford needs non-partisan voter
registration drive
Since the beginning of the 2004
election season, the Stanford com
munity has actively engaged in an
open dialogue about issues ranging
from education reform to the war in
Iraq. As the election nears, it is criti
cal that more students become ac
tively involved in the 2004 election by
not only participating in campus po
litical discourse but also, more impor
tantly, by registering to vote.
In today's partisan political atmo
sphere, many young voters have
come to understand politics to be in
herently divisive. Unfortunately, this
notion may have been inadvertently
reinforced through an e-mail recent
ly sent by the Stanford Democrats so
liciting students to serve as hall cap
tains for voter registration. While the
e-mail asserts that the effort is non

partisan, there are clear partisan
overtures which we fear will compro
mise this unprecedented enfran
chisement of eligible Stanford voters.
We commend the Stanford
Democrats for their determination to
launch "the largest precinct opera
tion and get-out-the-vote drive in
Stanford history," and their efforts to
increase political participation on
campus We also share the Stanford
Democrats' desire to transform the
Stanford community's interest in cur
rent politics into mobilization toward
the ballot boxes. However, we be
lieve that for such an effort to achieve
maximum success, this project must
be non-partisan.
In keeping with Stanford in Gov
ernment's tradition of promoting non
partisan political awareness, our goal
should be to ensure students are given
the opportunity to make responsible
decisions as young voters. The Stan
ford community represents a diversity
of political opinion comparable to the
American electorate. Therefore, we
believe it is imperative that the Stan
ford community is allowed to freely
participate in a civil political conversa
tion during the 2004 election.
Is politics inherently divisive? As
former students at Stanford in Wash
ington and members of the incoming
leadership of Stanford in Govern
ment, we don't believe so. Partisan
ship is divisive; political empower
ment does not have to be. As mem
bers of the Stanford community and
student organizations, it is our collec
tive responsibility to empower our
peers with broad and conceptual un
derstandings of American politics.
Let's allow each member of our
community to make an independent
electoral decision based on his or her
academic pursuits, moral convictions
and personal understandings. That is
something students of all political af
filiations can be proud of.
