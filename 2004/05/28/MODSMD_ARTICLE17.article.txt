# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Cheeseburger in Palestine 
### 
The possibilities of the future
are titillating. Think about it.
What will be the iPod of the
2010s? Who will be the next
action star voted governor?
Even now, I can't wait fora new Mi
crosoft innovation on Web technology,
Detroit's next spin on hybrid automo
biles or a genetic-engineering lab's intro
duction of a breed of talking pets (1 want
to know what catnip is really like).
I am especially anxious to see how
the Israeli-Palestinian drama ends. I
mean, it has to end sometime, right?
Imagine the day when they can look
back on it all and chuckle:
"Remember when we hated each
other? Haha. That was so stupid."
We can drive through Gaza City
and tell our grandchildren:
"The brochure says that 15 people
were killed by Israeli Defense Force
machine-gun fire on that plot of land
over there. Now it's a Burger King."
I anticipate a day when the only
dilemma running through the minds of
Israelestinians is the trade-off between
low-cholesterol and the Atkins Diet.
How is it going to be? Will there be
one state or two? If there are two
states, what will they be like? Will they
fence off Ariel Sharon, Hamas, trig
ger-happy IDF troops, militant settlers
and all the suicide bombers with
barbed wire on barren land while the
rest rejoice in peace and freedom and
bake birthday cakes and gather for
harmonious multi-ethnic child choirs
on tulip-covered hillsides? Maybe.
You never really know. But I don't
think we should be banking on the so
called leadership of either side to speed
the process along. Public opinion polls
show that Sharon and Arafat are each
about as divisive as our own failing
president. Should we wait for heroes to
float up the political pathways and bail
us out? Or should we start focusing
more on the people themselves?
In my opinion, Palestinians need a

real hero — a positive influence who
will earn a holiday in his name the way
the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. or

Jesus Christ did.
This 21st century
hero needs capti
vate the world and
his countrymen
and articulate
non-violent prin
ciples. In doing so,
he will challenge
Israel on the only
front refereed by
the American pub-

lic-the morality front. Right now,
Palestinians are losing that battle at the
hands of the occasional self-destruct
ing few.
Maybe Ahmad Mughayer, a 13-
year-old from Gaza, would have
grown to become the hero the world
has been waiting for. He and his sister
Asma, 16, were killed by single shots
to the head last week on the roof of
their home. Ahmad was feeding pi
geons and Asma was taking down
laundry at the time. It was one of the
biggest Israeli raids on Gaza in years
— intended to thwart the smuggling
of rocket-propelled grenades and
other weapons through tunnels
under Egypt.
Avi Pazner, a spokesman for the Is
raeli government of Ariel Sharon, re
sponded to accusations of war crimes:
"This is a fight against terrorism,
and as far as we are concerned it is a
clean fight. We are extremely careful
not to hurt or damage in any way the
civilian population."
Come on. I was born at night, but
not last night, Avi. "Extremely care
ful" means something along the lines
of accidental civilian deaths rarely ever
occurring, if at all. With two Palestini
an teenagers lying in the morgue with
holes in their skulls and no other
wounds, you'll be hard-pressed to con
vince me that it was even an accident.

That's like George Bush stating pub
licly that Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld is doing a "superb" job.
It's laughable at best. Worrisome at
medium-best. Apocalyptic at worst.
But it's too bad for everyone that
when Israel mows down Palestinian
civilians in an atrocious fashion, grass
roots saviors don't sprout up like sui
cide bombers do.
According to a July 2003 World
Economic Forum poll, about half of Is
raelis think the USA has the most in
fluential role in bringing peace to the
region. A survey by The Palestinian
Center for Policy and Survey Research
in Ramallah says that 97 percent of
Palestinians feel that the USA is bi
ased toward Israel in the conflict.
As the most powerful nation on
Earth, we want to solve the violence,
but we don't know how. The news
shows both Palestinian civilians killed
by Israel's super-military and Israeli
buses blown to bits by Palestinian sui
cide bombers. Americans are accus
tomed to the Hollywood version of
conflicts — a good guy on one side and
a bad guy on the other. We get con
fused when there are bad guys on each
side and no identifiable good guys.
The Palestinians need a charismat
ic leader to do something extraordi
nary — something worth rewarding. If
he starts rallying his people and ex
ploiting America's weakness for non
violence, underdogs and optimism,
then, just maybe, he will drag Israel
into a battle where the range of
weapons are reduced to words and im
ages-rather than words, images, tanks,
grenade launchers, explosives, ma
chine guns, helicopters.,.
That's what I'm looking forward to.

roots saviors don't sprout up like sui
cide bombers do.
According to a July 2003 World
Economic Forum poll, about half of Is
raelis think the USA has the most in
fluential role in bringing peace to the
region. A survey by The Palestinian
Center for Policy and Survey Research
in Ramallah says that 97 percent of
Palestinians feel that the USA is bi
ased toward Israel in the conflict.
As the most powerful nation on
Earth, we want to solve the violence,
but we don't know how. The news
shows both Palestinian civilians killed
by Israel's super-military and Israeli
buses blown to bits by Palestinian sui
cide bombers. Americans are accus
tomed to the Hollywood version of
conflicts — a good guy on one side and
a bad guy on the other. We get con
fused when there are bad guys on each
side and no identifiable good guys.
The Palestinians need a charismat
ic leader to do something extraordi
nary — something worth rewarding. If
he starts rallying his people and ex
ploiting America's weakness for non
violence, underdogs and optimism,
then, just maybe, he will drag Israel
into a battle where the range of
weapons are reduced to words and im
ages-rather than words, images, tanks,
grenade launchers, explosives, ma
chine guns, helicopters.,.
That's what I'm looking forward to.

The possibilities of the future
are titillating. Think about it.
What will be the iPod of the
2010s? Who will be the next
action star voted governor?
Even now, I can't wait fora new Mi
crosoft innovation on Web technology,
Detroit's next spin on hybrid automo
biles or a genetic-engineering lab's intro
duction of a breed of talking pets (1 want
to know what catnip is really like).
I am especially anxious to see how
the Israeli-Palestinian drama ends. I
mean, it has to end sometime, right?
Imagine the day when they can look
back on it all and chuckle:
"Remember when we hated each
other? Haha. That was so stupid."
We can drive through Gaza City
and tell our grandchildren:
"The brochure says that 15 people
were killed by Israeli Defense Force
machine-gun fire on that plot of land
over there. Now it's a Burger King."
I anticipate a day when the only
dilemma running through the minds of
Israelestinians is the trade-off between
low-cholesterol and the Atkins Diet.
How is it going to be? Will there be
one state or two? If there are two
states, what will they be like? Will they
fence off Ariel Sharon, Hamas, trig
ger-happy IDF troops, militant settlers
and all the suicide bombers with
barbed wire on barren land while the
rest rejoice in peace and freedom and
bake birthday cakes and gather for
harmonious multi-ethnic child choirs
on tulip-covered hillsides? Maybe.
You never really know. But I don't
think we should be banking on the so
called leadership of either side to speed
the process along. Public opinion polls
show that Sharon and Arafat are each
about as divisive as our own failing
president. Should we wait for heroes to
float up the political pathways and bail
us out? Or should we start focusing
more on the people themselves?
In my opinion, Palestinians need a

real hero — a positive influence who
will earn a holiday in his name the way
the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. or

Jesus Christ did.
This 21st century
hero needs capti
vate the world and
his countrymen
and articulate
non-violent prin
ciples. In doing so,
he will challenge
Israel on the only
front refereed by
the American pub-

lic-the morality front. Right now,
Palestinians are losing that battle at the
hands of the occasional self-destruct
ing few.
Maybe Ahmad Mughayer, a 13-
year-old from Gaza, would have
grown to become the hero the world
has been waiting for. He and his sister
Asma, 16, were killed by single shots
to the head last week on the roof of
their home. Ahmad was feeding pi
geons and Asma was taking down
laundry at the time. It was one of the
biggest Israeli raids on Gaza in years
— intended to thwart the smuggling
of rocket-propelled grenades and
other weapons through tunnels
under Egypt.
Avi Pazner, a spokesman for the Is
raeli government of Ariel Sharon, re
sponded to accusations of war crimes:
"This is a fight against terrorism,
and as far as we are concerned it is a
clean fight. We are extremely careful
not to hurt or damage in any way the
civilian population."
Come on. I was born at night, but
not last night, Avi. "Extremely care
ful" means something along the lines
of accidental civilian deaths rarely ever
occurring, if at all. With two Palestini
an teenagers lying in the morgue with
holes in their skulls and no other
wounds, you'll be hard-pressed to con
vince me that it was even an accident.

That's like George Bush stating pub
licly that Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld is doing a "superb" job.
It's laughable at best. Worrisome at
medium-best. Apocalyptic at worst.
But it's too bad for everyone that
when Israel mows down Palestinian
civilians in an atrocious fashion, grass
roots saviors don't sprout up like sui
cide bombers do.
