## Diligence should trump expediency 
### LUKE MILLER 
I am greatly disturbed by the promi
nent role expediency played in the re
cent certification of the May ASSU
Executive Election results. Tbe state
ments and actions of the election com
missioner, the two ASSU governing
bodies and The Daily demonstrate that
a decision arrived at in an expedient
fashion was more important that a de
cision guided by due diligence.
The belief was that we, the associ
ated students of Stanford University,
all needed to put this ugliness behind
us and embrace the promise of better
days ahead. Unfortunately, our alle
giance to expediency rather than the
ASSU Constitution darkens rather
than brightens the future.
Ellie Martin stressed expediency' in
her statements before both the Under
graduate Senate and the Graduate Stu
dent Council. Despite her belief that the
first election should have been certified,
she urged both bodies to certify the May
elections because "there's a good
chance that we won't have an executive
slate until next year." ("GSC certifies
Chioke-Kory," May 27). Clearly, Mar
tin prioritized having any executive over
having a duly elected executive. Are we
really better off as a result of this alleged
need to have an executive in place for
the summer, especially at the cost of vi
olating the ASSU constitution?
And in case we need further evi
dence, the Senate, in an act of impres
sive expediency, certified the May

election with no discussion whatsoev
er. How can there be no discussion re
garding such an important, vital and
controversial issue? How can those
elected to serve the student body have
nothing to say on an issue that has cap
tivated a large portion of the under
graduate population?
Clearly, the Senate wanted to put
the whole thing behind them and
move on. However, their decision to
not certify the first election is not going
away simply by refusing to talk about
it. TTiere is now another case before
the Constitutional Council that could
very likely return the issue to the Sen
ate. Will they speak then?
Expediency also seemed to have
been a motivator in the GSC's certifi
cation decision. Prior to last night's
certification vote, we were told that
the whole system could implode if the
May election results were not certi
fied. Where would the money fora
third election come from? Do we even
have the time to put an election to
gether? How can the ASSU be taken
seriously by the administration and
student body if we once again failed to
certify an election?
While I don't fully discount these
arguments, I do not award them the
same gravity as it appears others have.
I voted not to certify because I am
more concerned about the precedent
that has been set, a precedent that the
will of the student body, expressed
through an election, can be scrapped
on shaky, if not outright unconstitu

tional grounds. How can we expect to
be viewed as legitimate governing
bodies if we break our own rules and
ignore our constituency?
The Daily too has shown it prefers
expediency to due diligence. The edi
torial board was wrong to chide Dylan
Mefford for filing his most recent case.
The Daily is wrong in thinking that
"More Council suits will not solve any
thing" (May 27). There are many very
important issues that remain to be
solved, and the Council is central to
any possible solutions.
Mefford has done the right thing by
filing his third suit. Remember, the
Council rejected Mefford's second
case because of a technicality, not be
cause they deemed valid the Senate's
justification for not certifying. In fact,
we have yet to hear the Council's view
of that justification. This is the purpose
of Mefford's case. This is the good that
will come from this case. And yes, this
is in the best interest of both the ASSU
and the student body. On these counts,
The Daily is just wrong.
We are wrong to think expediency
is the best means for putting this be
hind us. Turn around, it's still there. In
our desire to move forward, we have
only made matters worse.

the whole system could implode if the
May election results were not certi
fied. Where would the money fora
third election come from? Do we even
have the time to put an election to
gether? How can the ASSU be taken
seriously by the administration and
student body if we once again failed to
certify an election?
While I don't fully discount these
arguments, I do not award them the
same gravity as it appears others have.
I voted not to certify because I am
more concerned about the precedent
that has been set, a precedent that the
will of the student body, expressed
through an election, can be scrapped
on shaky, if not outright unconstitu

tional grounds. How can we expect to
be viewed as legitimate governing
bodies if we break our own rules and
ignore our constituency?
The Daily too has shown it prefers
expediency to due diligence. The edi
torial board was wrong to chide Dylan
Mefford for filing his most recent case.
The Daily is wrong in thinking that
"More Council suits will not solve any
thing" (May 27). There are many very
important issues that remain to be
solved, and the Council is central to
any possible solutions.
Mefford has done the right thing by
filing his third suit. Remember, the
Council rejected Mefford's second
case because of a technicality, not be
cause they deemed valid the Senate's
justification for not certifying. In fact,
we have yet to hear the Council's view
of that justification. This is the purpose
of Mefford's case. This is the good that
will come from this case. And yes, this
is in the best interest of both the ASSU
and the student body. On these counts,
The Daily is just wrong.
We are wrong to think expediency
is the best means for putting this be
hind us. Turn around, it's still there. In
our desire to move forward, we have
only made matters worse.
