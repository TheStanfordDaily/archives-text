### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Eleven students received the James W. Lyons Award and eight student
organizations accepted the Dean's Achievement Award during a ceremony
held in Tresidder's Oak Room on Wednesday evening. The awards, granted
by the dean of students, recognize students and groups who have contributed
to or improved an aspect of campus life.
"The Lyon's Award is given to the most committed and innovative stu
dents we have here," said Nanci Howe, associate dean of students. "The peo
ple who have received the award have gone off to do great things years after
ward. These students have an unusual amount of passion and dedication."
Many of the Lyons Award recipients are heavily involved in and have
strived to improve specific groups and communities.
Steve Allison, a doctoral student in biological sciences, was acknowledged
for his leading role in the Graduate Student Council and his efforts to ad
vance the construction of the new Graduate Community Center.
One of the founders of the Stanford Medical Interpreters Program, senior
Chitua Alozie, was awarded for her fundraising efforts for service programs
and her development of a clinical experience program for students in Ensenada,
Mexico.
Junior Piotr Kosicki, who was nominated by Judith Rowles, the University
advisor for student publications, said he won the award for his leadership as the
director of the ASSU Publications Board.
"Basically this was the first year the pub board saw a lot of stuff thrown at it,"
Kosicki said. "My nominator was impressed with the time and energy I put into
publications. She knew 1 didn't mind rewriting the | ASSU] Undergraduate Sen
ate's by-laws governing publications. She knew I didn't mind confronting [di
rector of Residential Education] Jane Camarillo on certain issues."
ASSU Vice President Joey Natoli, a junior, was recognized as a founder of
the Absolute Fun program designed to promote alcohol-free student events, as
well as a key player in the ASSU Book Service Program, which provides stu
dents with discounts on books.
Junior Erin Palm, an earth systems major, was also awarded for volunteer
work in Mexico, in addition to her leadership in the Quest Scholars Program,
which supports underprivileged high school students.
Jonathan Olsen, a senior in human biology, founded both The Undergradu
ate Research Journal and The Stanford Scientific Review. He is also one of the
top coordinators for Stanford Relay for Life.
Acknowledged for her long-time commitment to the University's Chi
cano/Latino community, senior Veronica Juarez, has served as a member of El
Centra's Guiding Concilio and governing board. She is also the founder of the
first multicultural sorority on campus.
"I can think of so many of my peers who are deserving of this award," Juarez
said. "I'm involved in the Latino community but I tried to do things in the com
munity at large and always make sure that certain groups of people had a voice.
1 just used the skills that 1 had to better the immediate community, and some
body along the way thought that something I've done made things a little bit bet
ter. It's a huge honor."
Law student Tyler Doyle was awarded as an organizer of the Volunteer At
torney Program and as a contributor to the Stanford Judicial Panel. He worked
to improve Community Legal Services while pursuing almost 50 cases himself.
Three medical students, Nina Chinosornvatana, Brent Kobash and David
Wang were recognized for establishing the Pacific Free Clinic in San Jose, a fa
cility that provides high-quality care for recent Asian immigrants. In the course
of their work, they solicited free prescription drugs for patients and aimed to
provide inexpensive referrals.
Once students were nominated for the award, they were asked to interview
with Associate Dean of Students Morris Graves.
"He told me to come in for an interview for the award and I thought 'Oh well,
I won't ever get it but this is interesting,"' Kosicki said. "We sat down and he
asked if I knew the history of the award, and I said no. He told me the whole story
and at the end told me I was a recipient. There are some things you expect, but
this was definitely not one of those things."
Juarez echoed Kosicki's surprise.
"I definitely didn't expect it," she said. "I wasn't told I had been nominated,
and fora long time I wasn't even sure what I had been nominated for."
Juarez's brother attended Wednesday's award ceremony, just in time for her
thesis presentation today. She will be speaking on the role of diversity in board
ing school.
In addition to the 11 winners of the Lyons Award, eight student-led organi
zations received the Dean's Achievement Award, including the North Korean
Human Rights Committee, the Educational Studies Program, the Gamma Zeta
Alpha Fraternity, Six Degrees: A Stanford Journal of Human Rights, United

by the dean of students, recognize students and groups who have contributed
to or improved an aspect of campus life.
"The Lyon's Award is given to the most committed and innovative stu
dents we have here," said Nanci Howe, associate dean of students. "The peo
ple who have received the award have gone off to do great things years after
ward. These students have an unusual amount of passion and dedication."
Many of the Lyons Award recipients are heavily involved in and have
strived to improve specific groups and communities.
Steve Allison, a doctoral student in biological sciences, was acknowledged
for his leading role in the Graduate Student Council and his efforts to ad
vance the construction of the new Graduate Community Center.
One of the founders of the Stanford Medical Interpreters Program, senior
Chitua Alozie, was awarded for her fundraising efforts for service programs
and her development of a clinical experience program for students in Ensenada,
Mexico.
Junior Piotr Kosicki, who was nominated by Judith Rowles, the University
advisor for student publications, said he won the award for his leadership as the
director of the ASSU Publications Board.
"Basically this was the first year the pub board saw a lot of stuff thrown at it,"
Kosicki said. "My nominator was impressed with the time and energy I put into
publications. She knew 1 didn't mind rewriting the | ASSU] Undergraduate Sen
ate's by-laws governing publications. She knew I didn't mind confronting [di
rector of Residential Education] Jane Camarillo on certain issues."
ASSU Vice President Joey Natoli, a junior, was recognized as a founder of
the Absolute Fun program designed to promote alcohol-free student events, as
well as a key player in the ASSU Book Service Program, which provides stu
dents with discounts on books.
Junior Erin Palm, an earth systems major, was also awarded for volunteer
work in Mexico, in addition to her leadership in the Quest Scholars Program,
which supports underprivileged high school students.
Jonathan Olsen, a senior in human biology, founded both The Undergradu
ate Research Journal and The Stanford Scientific Review. He is also one of the
top coordinators for Stanford Relay for Life.
Acknowledged for her long-time commitment to the University's Chi
cano/Latino community, senior Veronica Juarez, has served as a member of El
Centra's Guiding Concilio and governing board. She is also the founder of the
first multicultural sorority on campus.
"I can think of so many of my peers who are deserving of this award," Juarez
said. "I'm involved in the Latino community but I tried to do things in the com
munity at large and always make sure that certain groups of people had a voice.
1 just used the skills that 1 had to better the immediate community, and some
body along the way thought that something I've done made things a little bit bet
ter. It's a huge honor."
Law student Tyler Doyle was awarded as an organizer of the Volunteer At
torney Program and as a contributor to the Stanford Judicial Panel. He worked
to improve Community Legal Services while pursuing almost 50 cases himself.
Three medical students, Nina Chinosornvatana, Brent Kobash and David
Wang were recognized for establishing the Pacific Free Clinic in San Jose, a fa
cility that provides high-quality care for recent Asian immigrants. In the course
of their work, they solicited free prescription drugs for patients and aimed to
provide inexpensive referrals.
Once students were nominated for the award, they were asked to interview
with Associate Dean of Students Morris Graves.
"He told me to come in for an interview for the award and I thought 'Oh well,
I won't ever get it but this is interesting,"' Kosicki said. "We sat down and he
asked if I knew the history of the award, and I said no. He told me the whole story
and at the end told me I was a recipient. There are some things you expect, but
this was definitely not one of those things."
Juarez echoed Kosicki's surprise.
"I definitely didn't expect it," she said. "I wasn't told I had been nominated,
and fora long time I wasn't even sure what I had been nominated for."
Juarez's brother attended Wednesday's award ceremony, just in time for her
thesis presentation today. She will be speaking on the role of diversity in board
ing school.

zations received the Dean's Achievement Award, including the North Korean
