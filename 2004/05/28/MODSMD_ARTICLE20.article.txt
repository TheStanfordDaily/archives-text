## Julie says come run The Loop at night 
### 
Could Stanford students please start
running more at night? There was
a time just a few years ago when
the number of night runners on
Campus Loop served as my personal justifi
cation for just how much the social scene at
Stanford sucked. Why, I wondered, are so
many people running this late at night when
they could be doing something ... else? Oh
wait, so am I.
But Tuesday night at 10:00 p.m., I ventured
out in boredom, against the concerned cau
tioning of my drawmate, and faced the Loop.
I came across exactly three runners on the
entire empty loop, an erratic moving truck, a
scary skinny guy on a bike and a car that cir
cled around me with its lights off.
My run started peacefully enough down

the KA/EBF hill until I
passed the spot where,
sophomore year, on a simi
larly peaceful night run, I
fell into an open manhole
which left a dent in my
kneecap that 1 still have
today, only a few inches
above the permanent
bruise I have on my shin
from an inflatable pool 1 fell

out of the year before that.
My manhole reminiscing quickly mor
phed into paranoid speculating when I spot
ted a moving truck man staring at me from
out of his window. I stopped running and
'stretched fora minute so he could proceed
down Santa Teresa in front of me and be gone
already, but to my surprise, he managed to
stay almost on par with my senior jogger's
pace for the entire length of the street — past
Roble, Lagunita, even FroSoCo, on a jagged
path of throwing on his hazard lights, stop
ping the truck in the middle of the street,
pulling into parking lots and reappearing, and
so forth.
When he had made his final swervy exit to
wards J unipero Serra, I took the back stretch of
campus by Stockfarm and reminisced on this
beautiful guy, Nick Jones, I had passed by three
years prior on that very stretch of asphalt.
Alas, my musings quickly returned to
paranoia when a lone biker approached. I
again took the defensive move of stopping to
stretch, facing him head-on (also a good tac
tic for facing mountain lions) and as he passed
me he threw back a smile. Or was it a menac
ing look? Could he be in cahoots with the
moving truck man? Was there some conspir
acy to trap me in the forest? Was the biker
waiting for me somewhere up the road?
Call me paranoid, that much is obvious,
but it struck me that guys don't think about all
this stuff when they're running. Not to say
that all girls do either, but there is a marked
gender difference when it comes to being out
side alone at night. How can I enjoy the peace
and solitude if I am instead keeping a sharp
eye out for the next emergency post, and
wondering if the best strategy would be to run
to a post in front of me or double back to the
one I just passed if I were attacked? Everyone
is suspect. No wonder, when I am hearing sto
ries like the one about Juilliard student Sarah
Fox, who was last seen going fora jog, only to
be found decomposing in a park in Manhat
tan yesterday.
The rest of my run passed uneventfully on
an empty Campus Drive until I reached the
stretch of Campus just after Mayfield. Some
guy pulled into the SAE lot (nothing unusu
al) and immediately pulled back out of it.
Okay, I thought, maybe there's no parking
spaces. Until he proceeded to pull into the
EBF lot and circled around it.
At this point, my run was finished. As 1 dou
bled back to EBF, he had circled the lot again
with his lights off and parked facing me. Weird,
right? Once I got to the parking lot, he started
his car, did another loop and disappeared.
Is it all in my head, or did some odd char
acters come out on The Loop Tuesday night?
We all know about running safely at night:
stay in well-lit places, there's safety in num
bers and, as American Running Association
member Douglas Lentz puts it, "light your
self up like a Christmas tree." Even so, a few
years ago. a night runner wearing a reflective
vest and a flashing waistband light with a
flashlight in hand still got hit by a car.
Surprisingly, he wasn't a well-acces
sorized Stanford grad student, but some guy
from Sacramento.
My advice for the Stanford community is
for more of us to run at night, not less. Cam
pus Loop is only bizarre when it's empty, just
like Danny DeVito is only scary when he's
playing a naked werewolf. And no one wants
to see that alone at night.

running alone.

tan yesterday.
The rest of my run passed uneventfully on
an empty Campus Drive until I reached the
stretch of Campus just after Mayfield. Some
guy pulled into the SAE lot (nothing unusu
al) and immediately pulled back out of it.
Okay, I thought, maybe there's no parking
spaces. Until he proceeded to pull into the
EBF lot and circled around it.
At this point, my run was finished. As 1 dou
bled back to EBF, he had circled the lot again
with his lights off and parked facing me. Weird,
right? Once I got to the parking lot, he started
his car, did another loop and disappeared.
Is it all in my head, or did some odd char
acters come out on The Loop Tuesday night?
We all know about running safely at night:
stay in well-lit places, there's safety in num
bers and, as American Running Association
member Douglas Lentz puts it, "light your
self up like a Christmas tree." Even so, a few
years ago. a night runner wearing a reflective
vest and a flashing waistband light with a
flashlight in hand still got hit by a car.
Surprisingly, he wasn't a well-acces
sorized Stanford grad student, but some guy
from Sacramento.
My advice for the Stanford community is
for more of us to run at night, not less. Cam
pus Loop is only bizarre when it's empty, just
like Danny DeVito is only scary when he's
playing a naked werewolf. And no one wants
to see that alone at night.

Could Stanford students please start
running more at night? There was
a time just a few years ago when
the number of night runners on
Campus Loop served as my personal justifi
cation for just how much the social scene at
Stanford sucked. Why, I wondered, are so
many people running this late at night when
they could be doing something ... else? Oh
wait, so am I.
But Tuesday night at 10:00 p.m., I ventured
out in boredom, against the concerned cau
tioning of my drawmate, and faced the Loop.
I came across exactly three runners on the
entire empty loop, an erratic moving truck, a
scary skinny guy on a bike and a car that cir
cled around me with its lights off.
My run started peacefully enough down

the KA/EBF hill until I
passed the spot where,
sophomore year, on a simi
larly peaceful night run, I
fell into an open manhole
which left a dent in my
kneecap that 1 still have
today, only a few inches
above the permanent
bruise I have on my shin
from an inflatable pool 1 fell

out of the year before that.
My manhole reminiscing quickly mor
phed into paranoid speculating when I spot
ted a moving truck man staring at me from
out of his window. I stopped running and
'stretched fora minute so he could proceed
down Santa Teresa in front of me and be gone
already, but to my surprise, he managed to
stay almost on par with my senior jogger's
pace for the entire length of the street — past
Roble, Lagunita, even FroSoCo, on a jagged
path of throwing on his hazard lights, stop
ping the truck in the middle of the street,
pulling into parking lots and reappearing, and
so forth.
When he had made his final swervy exit to
wards J unipero Serra, I took the back stretch of
campus by Stockfarm and reminisced on this
beautiful guy, Nick Jones, I had passed by three
years prior on that very stretch of asphalt.
Alas, my musings quickly returned to
paranoia when a lone biker approached. I
again took the defensive move of stopping to
stretch, facing him head-on (also a good tac
tic for facing mountain lions) and as he passed
me he threw back a smile. Or was it a menac
ing look? Could he be in cahoots with the
moving truck man? Was there some conspir
acy to trap me in the forest? Was the biker
waiting for me somewhere up the road?
Call me paranoid, that much is obvious,
but it struck me that guys don't think about all
this stuff when they're running. Not to say
that all girls do either, but there is a marked
gender difference when it comes to being out
side alone at night. How can I enjoy the peace
and solitude if I am instead keeping a sharp
eye out for the next emergency post, and
wondering if the best strategy would be to run
to a post in front of me or double back to the
one I just passed if I were attacked? Everyone
is suspect. No wonder, when I am hearing sto
ries like the one about Juilliard student Sarah
Fox, who was last seen going fora jog, only to
be found decomposing in a park in Manhat
tan yesterday.
