# Baseball set to face ASU

### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
The task is simple for the Stanford
baseball team this weekend. Win its final
Pac-10 series of the season, and the Car
dinal will be conference champions.
Stanford hosts Arizona State starting
tonight in its last regular-season series of
the year, with the Pac-10 title on the line.
The Cardinal (42-11, 14-7) sits alone in
first place by a half-game over Washing
ton (15-9 in conference) and 11/2 games
ahead of both the Sun Devils and UCLA.
With two wins. Stanford, which moved
down to number two in the national rank
ings this week, can wrap up its second
consecutive outright league champi
onship and 18th in school history. One
victory in the series would give the Cardi
nal a share of the conference title.
"We've just got to play our game and
everything will take care of itself," said
manager Mark Marquess.
Winning the conference title would
make Stanford a lock fora regional
berth. The Cardinal has hosted nine con
secutive NCAA Regionals, and with
Stanford being one of the top two teams
in the country, the title of host is pretty
much assured.
Stanford has been first or second in the
Baseball America poll since Feb. 23.
The Cardinal was bolstered by the re
turn of third baseman Jonny Ash to the
lineup last weekend as Stanford avoided
losing three consecutive league series for
the first time since 1993 by taking two-of
three from visiting Southern California.
Ash, who had missed 15 games with a
finger injury, was a big reason for that —
and was named Pac-10 Player of the
Week for his efforts.
He went 6-for-13 (.462) with two dou
bles, a triple, four RBIs, four runs scored,
one walk and one hit by pitch to go with a
.769 slugging percentage and a .533 on
base percentage in the series.
"It's nice to finally have our entire
lineup healthy," Ash said.
Stanford will need everything they can
get with the red-hot Sun Devils coming to
town this weekend.
Fifteenth-ranked Arizona State (39-
14, 12-9) has won 11 of its last 12 games
and still has a chance to actually share the
conference title with a sweep of Stanford.
"They've played really well the last
few weeks," Marquess said. "They can
score a lot of runs."
The Sun Devils also have played one

of the toughest schedules in the country.
They are 13-3 against teams in the Base
ball America top 25 and of their 53 games,
33 contests have been against teams that
have been or are currently ranked.
Marquess probably can't ask fora bet
ter warm-up heading into the most im
portant time of the season.
"It should be a good tune-up," he said.
"You'd hope we won't have to face a bet
ter team than this in the regionals."
The Sun Devils lead the Pac-10 in hit
ting (.331) and fielding (.975) and are sec
ond with a 4.46 ERA.
Arizona State has 10 players hitting at
least .300 and is led by a shortstop who
will probably be the biggest competition
for Stanford's Jed Lowrie for conference
player of the year.
That would be junior Dustin Pedroia,
who is second in the conference in hitting
(.409) and leads the Pac-10 in runs (74),
hits (90), doubles (23) and on-base per
centage (.515) and is third with a .645
slugging percentage. He is only eight hits
shy of 300 for his career.
Teammate Jeff Larish joined Pedroia
on the 2003 U.S.A. Baseball team after a
stellar sophomore season in which he hit
.372 with 18 home runs and 95 RBIs.
Larish was rated one of the top
three prospects in the entire nation
heading into the season, but he's failed
to live up to the hype.
He's hit a modest .310 and his power
numbers have been down (6 homers, 45
RBIs). But he hit three home runs against
Arizona last weekend and seems to final
ly be finding his groove.
Arizona State has a pitching staff to
match its bats, too.
Junior Jason Urquidez, who will pitch
in tomorrow's game, leads the Pac-10
with 11 wins and is also third with a 2.90
ERA and has 89 strikeouts in 90 innings.
Senior Jeff Mousser has been hot lately,
going 5-0 in his last five starts and boast
ing the fifth-best ERA in the conference
(3.57).
Stanford will certainly be in fora test
this weekend, but Ash and company hope
they can be up to the challenge.
"We want to give guys lots of mo
mentum heading into the postsea
son," Ash said.
Centerfielder Sam Fuld is now within
18 hits of all-time Stanford and Pac-10 hit
leader John Gall (368).
The 16 NCAA Regional sites will
be announced on Sunday at 12:10
p.m. live on ESPN.

The Stanford baseball team will take on Arizona State this weekend. A series win will
clinch the Pac-10 Conference title for the Cardinal.
The task is simple for the Stanford
baseball team this weekend. Win its final
Pac-10 series of the season, and the Car
dinal will be conference champions.
Stanford hosts Arizona State starting
tonight in its last regular-season series of
the year, with the Pac-10 title on the line.
The Cardinal (42-11, 14-7) sits alone in
first place by a half-game over Washing
ton (15-9 in conference) and 11/2 games
ahead of both the Sun Devils and UCLA.
With two wins. Stanford, which moved
down to number two in the national rank
ings this week, can wrap up its second
consecutive outright league champi
onship and 18th in school history. One
victory in the series would give the Cardi
nal a share of the conference title.
"We've just got to play our game and
everything will take care of itself," said
manager Mark Marquess.
Winning the conference title would
make Stanford a lock fora regional
berth. The Cardinal has hosted nine con
secutive NCAA Regionals, and with
Stanford being one of the top two teams
in the country, the title of host is pretty
much assured.
Stanford has been first or second in the
Baseball America poll since Feb. 23.
The Cardinal was bolstered by the re
turn of third baseman Jonny Ash to the
lineup last weekend as Stanford avoided
losing three consecutive league series for
the first time since 1993 by taking two-of
three from visiting Southern California.
Ash, who had missed 15 games with a
finger injury, was a big reason for that —
and was named Pac-10 Player of the
Week for his efforts.
He went 6-for-13 (.462) with two dou
bles, a triple, four RBIs, four runs scored,
one walk and one hit by pitch to go with a
.769 slugging percentage and a .533 on
base percentage in the series.
"It's nice to finally have our entire
lineup healthy," Ash said.
Stanford will need everything they can
get with the red-hot Sun Devils coming to
town this weekend.
Fifteenth-ranked Arizona State (39-
14, 12-9) has won 11 of its last 12 games
and still has a chance to actually share the
conference title with a sweep of Stanford.
"They've played really well the last
few weeks," Marquess said. "They can
score a lot of runs."
The Sun Devils also have played one

of the toughest schedules in the country.
They are 13-3 against teams in the Base
ball America top 25 and of their 53 games,
33 contests have been against teams that
have been or are currently ranked.
Marquess probably can't ask fora bet
ter warm-up heading into the most im
portant time of the season.
"It should be a good tune-up," he said.
"You'd hope we won't have to face a bet
ter team than this in the regionals."
The Sun Devils lead the Pac-10 in hit
ting (.331) and fielding (.975) and are sec
ond with a 4.46 ERA.
Arizona State has 10 players hitting at
least .300 and is led by a shortstop who
will probably be the biggest competition
for Stanford's Jed Lowrie for conference
player of the year.
That would be junior Dustin Pedroia,
who is second in the conference in hitting
(.409) and leads the Pac-10 in runs (74),
hits (90), doubles (23) and on-base per
centage (.515) and is third with a .645
slugging percentage. He is only eight hits
shy of 300 for his career.
Teammate Jeff Larish joined Pedroia
on the 2003 U.S.A. Baseball team after a
stellar sophomore season in which he hit
.372 with 18 home runs and 95 RBIs.
Larish was rated one of the top
three prospects in the entire nation
heading into the season, but he's failed
to live up to the hype.
He's hit a modest .310 and his power
numbers have been down (6 homers, 45
RBIs). But he hit three home runs against
Arizona last weekend and seems to final
ly be finding his groove.
Arizona State has a pitching staff to
match its bats, too.
Junior Jason Urquidez, who will pitch
in tomorrow's game, leads the Pac-10
with 11 wins and is also third with a 2.90
ERA and has 89 strikeouts in 90 innings.
