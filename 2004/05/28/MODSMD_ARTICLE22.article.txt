# Win-or-go-home for Cardinal softball
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE STAFF WRITER 
Getting to the Women's College World Series had been
the goal of the No. 7 Cardinal softball team (51-14) all season
long. But after winning last weekend's NCAA Regional to
earn a berth at this weekend's WCWS in Oklahoma City, the
question arose: what next?
At a press conference last week, Stanford head coach
John Rittman emphasized parity in the college softball game,
but also pointed out two perennial juggernauts.
"It's so hard to get to the World Series now because
there's just so much parity in college softball," Rittman said.
"We really need to enjoy this because unless you're a UCLA
or an Arizona, you just don't make it to the World Series on
a consistent basis."
Rittman's Cardinal ran into one of the giants of the soft
ball world yesterday afternoon when it played No. 2 UCLA

(44-9), the top-ranked team in the WCWS field, before a
crowd of 4,473 at Hall of Fame Stadium in Oklahoma City.
The Bruins boast quite possibly the most dangerous batting
lineup in the country in addition to one of the nation's best
pitchers in Keira Goerl. In the end, the Bruins' talent proved
overwhelming as the Cardinal fell, 8-2, in its first game of the
double-elimination WCWS.
Things started off well for the Cardinal yesterday as the
Cardinal drew first blood against the Bruins in the top of the
first inning when a two-out double by senior catcher Jessica
Allister scored freshman Jackie Rinehart to give Stanford a
1-0 lead. However, senior starting pitcher Dana Sorensen
quickly gave this run back to the Bruins in the bottom of the
first when UCLA right fielder Lisa Dodd singled to right
field to score third baseman Andrea Duran and tie the
game, 1-1.
Sorensen managed to get out of the inning without any
further damage and pitched a scoreless second inning before

Coach Rittman made a questionable move by removing
Sorensen from the game in favor of sophomore Laura Sev
erson before the bottom of the third inning. It was unclear
why Rittman made the pitching switch so early in a1 -1 game,
as the coach was unavailable for comment. The move was
certainly surprising, as Sorensen had started every game of
the Cardinal's NCAA Regional run and had three games of
World Series experience under her belt from 2001, while Sev
erson had pitched only two innings of relief in the previous
two weeks.
Perhaps history played a part in the decision. Sorensen
was hit very hard in her last outing versus UCLA, a 7-1 loss
to Goerl and the Bruins on May 9 in which Sorensen gave up
10 hits, including three home runs. Severson's May 8 start
versus the Bruins was somewhat better, although Severson
still gave up seven hits and walked three batters in six-plus in
nings en route to a 6-2 loss.
After the switch, Severson pitched well in the third inning,
retiring the Bruins in order. Then, in the top of the fourth, ju
nior first baseman Leah Nelson crushed a home run to cen
ter field to put the Cardinal up, 2-1, going into the bottom of
the fourth inning.
The Cardinal's lead would prove to be short-lived, how
ever, as Severson gave up six runs, all earned, on seven hits
and a walk, all before getting two outs in the bottom of the
fourth inning. Rittman and the rest of the Cardinal dugout
watched in disbelief as the Bruins tagged Severson for hit
after hit, including a three-run homer by Caitlin Benyi that
gave UCLA a comfortable 7-2 lead. Severson managed to
avoid any further scoring by stranding two Bruin baserun
ners to end the fourth inning, but the damage had been done.
With a five-run lead going into the fifth inning, the Bruins'
Goerl shut out the Cardinal batters for the next three innings
while the Bruins added an insurance run off Severson in the
bottom of the sixth to run the final score to 8-2.
While the first-round loss is certainly demoralizing, the
Cardinal will spend today preparing for tomorrow morning's
matchup against No. 6 Michigan (50-10). The Wolverines
will be coming off a heartbreaking loss to No. 3 Louisiana
State (50-10) in 15 innings yesterday. The two teams have not
squared off since the 2001 season, so Saturday's matchup is
somewhat of an enigma. Michigan holds a 3-2 edge in the all
time series between the two schools.
Because the Cardinal and the Wolverines each have one
loss in the double-elimination World Series, Saturday morn
ing's game will be a win-or-go-home situation for both teams,
which should provide for some fireworks. Should the Cardi
nal defeat Michigan, it would play again tomorrow afternoon
fora berth in Sunday afternoon's semifinals, where it could
face UCLA one more time.
The road ahead for the Cardinal is a steep one if it wants
to advance deep into this year's World Series. But after fin
ishing second in the Pacific 10 Conference for the first time in
school history and advancing to the WCWS for just the sec
ond time, this year's Cardinal squad has performed beyond
anyone's preseason expectations. With its back against the
wall, the Cardinal might seize upon tomorrow's Michigan
game as another chance to prove its place among the college
softball elite.

ishing second in the Pacific 10 Conference for the first time in
school history and advancing to the WCWS for just the sec
ond time, this year's Cardinal squad has performed beyond
anyone's preseason expectations. With its back against the
wall, the Cardinal might seize upon tomorrow's Michigan
game as another chance to prove its place among the college
softball elite.

The Stanford softball team is set to take on Michigan in the WCWS. After a loss to UCLA, the Cardinal needs a win to stay
alive in the double-elimination event.
Getting to the Women's College World Series had been
the goal of the No. 7 Cardinal softball team (51-14) all season
long. But after winning last weekend's NCAA Regional to
earn a berth at this weekend's WCWS in Oklahoma City, the
question arose: what next?
At a press conference last week, Stanford head coach
John Rittman emphasized parity in the college softball game,
but also pointed out two perennial juggernauts.
"It's so hard to get to the World Series now because
there's just so much parity in college softball," Rittman said.
"We really need to enjoy this because unless you're a UCLA
or an Arizona, you just don't make it to the World Series on
a consistent basis."
Rittman's Cardinal ran into one of the giants of the soft
ball world yesterday afternoon when it played No. 2 UCLA

(44-9), the top-ranked team in the WCWS field, before a
crowd of 4,473 at Hall of Fame Stadium in Oklahoma City.
The Bruins boast quite possibly the most dangerous batting
lineup in the country in addition to one of the nation's best
pitchers in Keira Goerl. In the end, the Bruins' talent proved
overwhelming as the Cardinal fell, 8-2, in its first game of the
double-elimination WCWS.
Things started off well for the Cardinal yesterday as the
Cardinal drew first blood against the Bruins in the top of the
first inning when a two-out double by senior catcher Jessica
Allister scored freshman Jackie Rinehart to give Stanford a
1-0 lead. However, senior starting pitcher Dana Sorensen
quickly gave this run back to the Bruins in the bottom of the
first when UCLA right fielder Lisa Dodd singled to right
field to score third baseman Andrea Duran and tie the
game, 1-1.
Sorensen managed to get out of the inning without any
further damage and pitched a scoreless second inning before

Coach Rittman made a questionable move by removing
Sorensen from the game in favor of sophomore Laura Sev
erson before the bottom of the third inning. It was unclear
why Rittman made the pitching switch so early in a1 -1 game,
as the coach was unavailable for comment. The move was
certainly surprising, as Sorensen had started every game of
the Cardinal's NCAA Regional run and had three games of
World Series experience under her belt from 2001, while Sev
erson had pitched only two innings of relief in the previous
two weeks.
Perhaps history played a part in the decision. Sorensen
was hit very hard in her last outing versus UCLA, a 7-1 loss
to Goerl and the Bruins on May 9 in which Sorensen gave up
10 hits, including three home runs. Severson's May 8 start
versus the Bruins was somewhat better, although Severson
still gave up seven hits and walked three batters in six-plus in
nings en route to a 6-2 loss.
After the switch, Severson pitched well in the third inning,
retiring the Bruins in order. Then, in the top of the fourth, ju
nior first baseman Leah Nelson crushed a home run to cen
ter field to put the Cardinal up, 2-1, going into the bottom of
the fourth inning.
The Cardinal's lead would prove to be short-lived, how
ever, as Severson gave up six runs, all earned, on seven hits
and a walk, all before getting two outs in the bottom of the
fourth inning. Rittman and the rest of the Cardinal dugout
watched in disbelief as the Bruins tagged Severson for hit
after hit, including a three-run homer by Caitlin Benyi that
gave UCLA a comfortable 7-2 lead. Severson managed to
avoid any further scoring by stranding two Bruin baserun
ners to end the fourth inning, but the damage had been done.
With a five-run lead going into the fifth inning, the Bruins'
Goerl shut out the Cardinal batters for the next three innings
while the Bruins added an insurance run off Severson in the
bottom of the sixth to run the final score to 8-2.
While the first-round loss is certainly demoralizing, the
Cardinal will spend today preparing for tomorrow morning's
matchup against No. 6 Michigan (50-10). The Wolverines
will be coming off a heartbreaking loss to No. 3 Louisiana
State (50-10) in 15 innings yesterday. The two teams have not
squared off since the 2001 season, so Saturday's matchup is
somewhat of an enigma. Michigan holds a 3-2 edge in the all
time series between the two schools.
Because the Cardinal and the Wolverines each have one
loss in the double-elimination World Series, Saturday morn
ing's game will be a win-or-go-home situation for both teams,
which should provide for some fireworks. Should the Cardi
nal defeat Michigan, it would play again tomorrow afternoon
fora berth in Sunday afternoon's semifinals, where it could
face UCLA one more time.
