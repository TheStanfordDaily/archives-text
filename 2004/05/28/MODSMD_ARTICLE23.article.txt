The man is now a weapon, tem
pered by the distinct forces of love
and death.
The weapon is poised to strike, with
little regard to what it harms, as long as
it causes suffering.
Love and death struggle against
each other, but come together to
fuel the inner furnace of Eliel Swin
ton's soul.
Seeing his life fall apart on Oct. 20,
1994, the fateful night he learned his fi
ancee Jessica Williams had died in a
car accident. Swinton has dealt with
enough pain to last a lifetime. And
now, the sophomore defensive back
wants to share that feeling with others.
"I have a lot of pain in me right
now," Swinton said. The night he
found out that Williams had died, he
felt "like all my bones fell down to my
feet and I was just standing there."
Engineered since birth by his par
ents to be a football player, Swinton
has decided that it is no longer a game.
While he has maintained his charac
teristically friendly, open demeanor
off the field, Swinton has poured his
aggression out through football. After
one game back in the lineup, the faucet
is still wide open.
"Whoever is playing against me, 1
look at it as if they killed my girl
friend," he said in describing his game
day mentality. "I can release all my
anger on the field, and do it legally. I
can just go out there and unload on
somebody. Even if I punch somebody,
it's only a 15-yard penalty. It's not like
I'm going to jail."
Swinton is a changed person since
the accident. Always a little crazy on
the field, he now plays the game with
pure reckless abandon, getting in the
face of any opponent who dares talk
back to him. Against Washington,
the 190-pound Swinton nearly went

toe-to-toe with 245-pound All
- tight end Mark Breuner
and several of the Huskies' mam
moth offensive linemen.
"I'm a little more psychotic on the
field because I really want to hurt
somebody now and it's legal," he said.
"1 know I can do it, if I put my mind to
it. I could really damage somebody.
I'm a bruiser. I'm going to get in your
face, scream in your face and I'm going
to blow you up."
His shoes bear a stark reminder of
his recent ordeal. Across each toe, the
word "Jessica" is written. On the
back, "love" and "death" are on each
heel, forcing him to see both the joy
he felt with her and the fact that she is
no longer with him while he is out on
the field.
"That's basically the love I have for
her, but she's dead," Swinton said.
"There's a line between them, but it
really doesn't divide them. I love her in
death, nevertheless."
Besides the grief and pain he has
been through surrounding the death of
Williams, Swinton has also had to
grapple with a deteriorating family
life. While his mother Paula still re
mains close to his heart, his father
Oscar has moved out of the picture.
According to Swinton, his father made
some choices that that the family did
not approve of over the past year or so,
and Swinton has chosen not to deal
with that at this point in his life.
Since then, Swinton and his older
brother have cut off virtually all con
tact with their father. Only recently
have they begun to attempt to let
their father know how much he has
hurt the family.
Growing up a self-described
"thug" in Los Angeles, Swinton used
football to forge alliances with those
who became his teammates. Fiercely
loyal to "[his] boys" on the team,
Swinton sees the Stanford football
squad as his family.
As freshmen last year, he and run
ning back Quincy Jacobs were getting
teased by Jason White and other up

perclassmen who asked the two first
year players when they would get the
customary tattoo many of the Cardinal
players wore.
After the season had ended, Swin
ton called up Jacobs one night and the
twojourneyed to undertake the ritual.
The simple "No Fear" emblazoned on
the ankle of White and others was not
enough; Swinton and Jacobs decided
on something more specifically rele
vant to their time as members of the
Stanford football team. The result — a
powerful "C-House" (Cardinal
House) etched on their arms stands as
a testament to their devotion to the
Cardinal program.
Since then, Swinton has seen his
family life begin to crumble and his
anchor at school disappear. Describ
ing his relationship with Williams as
"a fairy tale," Swinton is quick to re
member all the positive moments he
had with her. Out of everything she
did and meant to him. Swinton be
lieves her insistence to never give up
has helped him greatly through the
past three weeks.
Before her tragic death, a hip flexor
and quadricep injury had sidelined
Swinton for three weeks. Football and
Williams had always been there for
Swinton at different times during his
entire life, and for two weeks, he had
neither. For someone who had been so
heavily involved in football since the
age of three, the sport became a given.
"It's like my girlfiend — you never
know how much you love her until it's
gone," he said. "You know you love
the sport, I know I love her, but you
learn how much you love her when
they're gone, but by that time it's too
late. I'm back playing again, but with
her, she's gone. I almost look at it as if
I have another chance with football,
but not with her. So you better make
sure you do all you can while you can."
His experiences over the past
three weeks have taught Swinton
much about life and his own in
evitable death.
"Life and death, not a big deal to

me anymore," he said. "I'm prepared
to go tomorrow. If somebody came
right here right now, and said one of
us is going to die, me or you, I'd prob
ably stand up and say, Take me.' I'm
more prepared."
But by taking strength from his
memories of Williams and her in
domitable work ethic, he has fought
his way back onto the field and, on his
first play of the Washington game, he
saw a Napoleon Kaufman fumble roll
wildly into his path — finally, some
thing had bounced Swinton's way.
"I got cut, or slipped or something,
and as I was falling I saw the ball fly
out, maybe five yards away," he said.
"I thought, The ball.' So I scooped it
up and started running, but I couldn't
get it out of third. My gears were grind
ing, and by then [Washington quarter
back Damon J Huard had the angle
and forced me out of bounds. It was
kind of embarrassing."
These days, Swinton still uses the
self-hypnosis technique a high-school
coach taught him to prepare for each
game. Slowly letting all the energy
leave his body in deep breaths, Swin
ton then envisions every play he
missed in previous games.
But then the "human highlight
tape" kicks in, and he sees himself
making every one of those plays in
ferocious fashion. Swinton has
added memories from his time with
Williams, and all these mental im
ages slowly build up in his mind.
With every breath, the energy grows
within his muscular body as he once
again becomes a weapon bent on de
livering just a piece of the suffering
he has endured and continues to
struggle through.

Swinton lead the Cardinal in tackles in
1995 (157), later played a season with
the Kansas City Chiefs — his pro ca
reer being cut short hy injuries — and
then went on to make his acting debut
in 199H's "Varsity Blues," playing a
high-school football player with pro
fessional dreams.

Eliel Swinton channeled the anger and pain of losing his fiance into his
play on the field, leading to a 1995 season in which ne led tfie Cardinal
in tackles.
Editor s Note: This article originally

The man is now a weapon, tem
pered by the distinct forces of love
and death.
The weapon is poised to strike, with
little regard to what it harms, as long as
it causes suffering.
Love and death struggle against
each other, but come together to
fuel the inner furnace of Eliel Swin
ton's soul.
Seeing his life fall apart on Oct. 20,
1994, the fateful night he learned his fi
ancee Jessica Williams had died in a
car accident. Swinton has dealt with
enough pain to last a lifetime. And
now, the sophomore defensive back
wants to share that feeling with others.
"I have a lot of pain in me right
now," Swinton said. The night he
found out that Williams had died, he
felt "like all my bones fell down to my
feet and I was just standing there."
Engineered since birth by his par
ents to be a football player, Swinton
has decided that it is no longer a game.
While he has maintained his charac
teristically friendly, open demeanor
off the field, Swinton has poured his
aggression out through football. After
one game back in the lineup, the faucet
is still wide open.
"Whoever is playing against me, 1
look at it as if they killed my girl
friend," he said in describing his game
day mentality. "I can release all my
anger on the field, and do it legally. I
can just go out there and unload on
somebody. Even if I punch somebody,
it's only a 15-yard penalty. It's not like
I'm going to jail."
Swinton is a changed person since
the accident. Always a little crazy on
the field, he now plays the game with
pure reckless abandon, getting in the
face of any opponent who dares talk
back to him. Against Washington,
the 190-pound Swinton nearly went

toe-to-toe with 245-pound All
- tight end Mark Breuner
and several of the Huskies' mam
moth offensive linemen.
"I'm a little more psychotic on the
field because I really want to hurt
somebody now and it's legal," he said.
"1 know I can do it, if I put my mind to
it. I could really damage somebody.
I'm a bruiser. I'm going to get in your
face, scream in your face and I'm going
to blow you up."
His shoes bear a stark reminder of
his recent ordeal. Across each toe, the
word "Jessica" is written. On the
back, "love" and "death" are on each
heel, forcing him to see both the joy
he felt with her and the fact that she is
no longer with him while he is out on
the field.
"That's basically the love I have for
her, but she's dead," Swinton said.
"There's a line between them, but it
really doesn't divide them. I love her in
death, nevertheless."
Besides the grief and pain he has
been through surrounding the death of
Williams, Swinton has also had to
grapple with a deteriorating family
life. While his mother Paula still re
mains close to his heart, his father
Oscar has moved out of the picture.
According to Swinton, his father made
some choices that that the family did
not approve of over the past year or so,
and Swinton has chosen not to deal
with that at this point in his life.
Since then, Swinton and his older
brother have cut off virtually all con
tact with their father. Only recently
have they begun to attempt to let
their father know how much he has
hurt the family.
Growing up a self-described
"thug" in Los Angeles, Swinton used
football to forge alliances with those
who became his teammates. Fiercely
loyal to "[his] boys" on the team,
Swinton sees the Stanford football
squad as his family.
As freshmen last year, he and run
ning back Quincy Jacobs were getting
teased by Jason White and other up

perclassmen who asked the two first
year players when they would get the
customary tattoo many of the Cardinal
players wore.
After the season had ended, Swin
ton called up Jacobs one night and the
twojourneyed to undertake the ritual.
The simple "No Fear" emblazoned on
the ankle of White and others was not
enough; Swinton and Jacobs decided
on something more specifically rele
vant to their time as members of the
Stanford football team. The result — a
powerful "C-House" (Cardinal
House) etched on their arms stands as
a testament to their devotion to the
Cardinal program.
Since then, Swinton has seen his
family life begin to crumble and his
anchor at school disappear. Describ
ing his relationship with Williams as
"a fairy tale," Swinton is quick to re
member all the positive moments he
had with her. Out of everything she
did and meant to him. Swinton be
lieves her insistence to never give up
has helped him greatly through the
past three weeks.
Before her tragic death, a hip flexor
and quadricep injury had sidelined
Swinton for three weeks. Football and
Williams had always been there for
Swinton at different times during his
entire life, and for two weeks, he had
neither. For someone who had been so
heavily involved in football since the
age of three, the sport became a given.
"It's like my girlfiend — you never
know how much you love her until it's
gone," he said. "You know you love
the sport, I know I love her, but you
learn how much you love her when
they're gone, but by that time it's too
late. I'm back playing again, but with
her, she's gone. I almost look at it as if
I have another chance with football,
but not with her. So you better make
sure you do all you can while you can."
His experiences over the past
three weeks have taught Swinton
much about life and his own in
evitable death.
"Life and death, not a big deal to

me anymore," he said. "I'm prepared
to go tomorrow. If somebody came
right here right now, and said one of
us is going to die, me or you, I'd prob
ably stand up and say, Take me.' I'm
more prepared."
But by taking strength from his
memories of Williams and her in
domitable work ethic, he has fought
his way back onto the field and, on his
first play of the Washington game, he
saw a Napoleon Kaufman fumble roll
wildly into his path — finally, some
thing had bounced Swinton's way.
"I got cut, or slipped or something,
and as I was falling I saw the ball fly
out, maybe five yards away," he said.
"I thought, The ball.' So I scooped it
up and started running, but I couldn't
get it out of third. My gears were grind
ing, and by then [Washington quarter
back Damon J Huard had the angle
and forced me out of bounds. It was
kind of embarrassing."

heavily involved in football since the
age of three, the sport became a given.
"It's like my girlfiend — you never
know how much you love her until it's
gone," he said. "You know you love
the sport, I know I love her, but you
learn how much you love her when
they're gone, but by that time it's too
late. I'm back playing again, but with
her, she's gone. I almost look at it as if
I have another chance with football,
but not with her. So you better make
sure you do all you can while you can."
His experiences over the past
three weeks have taught Swinton
much about life and his own in
evitable death.
"Life and death, not a big deal to

me anymore," he said. "I'm prepared
to go tomorrow. If somebody came
right here right now, and said one of
us is going to die, me or you, I'd prob
ably stand up and say, Take me.' I'm
more prepared."
But by taking strength from his
memories of Williams and her in
domitable work ethic, he has fought
his way back onto the field and, on his
first play of the Washington game, he
saw a Napoleon Kaufman fumble roll
wildly into his path — finally, some
thing had bounced Swinton's way.
"I got cut, or slipped or something,
and as I was falling I saw the ball fly
out, maybe five yards away," he said.
"I thought, The ball.' So I scooped it
up and started running, but I couldn't
get it out of third. My gears were grind
ing, and by then [Washington quarter
back Damon J Huard had the angle
and forced me out of bounds. It was
kind of embarrassing."
These days, Swinton still uses the
self-hypnosis technique a high-school
coach taught him to prepare for each
game. Slowly letting all the energy
leave his body in deep breaths, Swin
ton then envisions every play he
missed in previous games.
But then the "human highlight
tape" kicks in, and he sees himself
making every one of those plays in
ferocious fashion. Swinton has
added memories from his time with
Williams, and all these mental im
ages slowly build up in his mind.
With every breath, the energy grows
within his muscular body as he once
again becomes a weapon bent on de
livering just a piece of the suffering
he has endured and continues to
struggle through.

Swinton lead the Cardinal in tackles in
1995 (157), later played a season with
the Kansas City Chiefs — his pro ca
reer being cut short hy injuries — and
then went on to make his acting debut
in 199H's "Varsity Blues," playing a
high-school football player with pro
fessional dreams.
