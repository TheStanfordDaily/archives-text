# No regrets for Fuld after returning to the Farm for senior season
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Watching centerfielder Sam Fuld quietly joke
around with fellow senior Brian Hall in between
baserunning drills at practice earlier this week, you
can't tell that the No. 2 Stanford baseball team's
record-setting leadoff man is having an off year.
But Fuld's even-keeled attitude on the field only
masks the frustration he's felt at least partly due to
an injury that has hampered him all season.
A career .350 hitter entering his senior campaign,
Fuld is batting .279 heading into the Cardinal's final
regular-season series against Arizona State. More
indicative of his struggles at the plate, his on-base
percentage is down to .313 from .403 last season.
While his strikeouts are down, so too are his walks,
from 34 to 11.
"It's certainly been frustrating," Fuld said. "But
it's been a pretty good learning process. I feel like
I've matured and I feel like I've developed more in
the mental part of the game."
Fuld has had little reason to be frustrated until
this season, as he knew nothing but success in each
of his previous three seasons on the Farm. The
Durham, N.H, native, who has played in 246 conse
cutive games, assumed a starting role as a freshman
out of Phillips Exeter Academy and batted .357 with
56 runs scored and 81 RBIs.
During his monster sophomore season, in which
he garnered First Team All-American honors, Fuld
broke the school record for hits in a season with 110
and scored 67 runs while batting .375, blasting eight
home runs and knocking in 47.
Last season was perhaps Fuld's most impressive
of all. His average and home runs dipped to .321 and
four, respectively, but he tied a team record with 83
runs and tallied 35 RBIs.
The immense success Fuld has enjoyed in his ca
reer makes his struggles at the plate this season all
the more surprising. But the numbers only tell part
of the story.
"My injury has been tough to deal with, said
Fuld of the stress fracture that developed in his left
wrist back in January. "It's one of those things where
you try to pretend almost that you don't have it. It
certainly bothers me, but it's just something you
have to deal with. [The pain] is pretty constant, but
it's actually felt better in the past week, which has
been encouraging."
Fuld, who says the injury causes pain during
contact at the plate but not when throwing, went
5-for-12 in last weekend's series against Southern
California, as the Cardinal took two-of-three
from the Trojans to regain first place in the Pacif
ic-10 Conference.
"It would be a lot harder to deal with if we
weren't having a good year," Fuld said. "Its really
been enjoyable being on this team. If anything, its a
little reassuring that I feel like I can have a bad game
and we can stiff put up a lot of runs. If we were losing
a lot, I'd feel like I would deserve a lot of the blame
for that."
Fuld's senior season has been scattered with its
fair share of memorable moments, however. He col
lected his 300 th career hit against Texas and later
broke Mark Davis's Stanford career record for runs
scored. He is currently the all-time Pac-10 leader in
runs scored (262) and at-bats (1,040). Most recently,
he raced all the way around the bases to score the
dramatic go-ahead run in the eighth inning of Satur
day's game, after his RBI groundball up the middle

slipped under the glove of the USC centerfielder.
But for now, extending the Cardinal's record
of consecutive trips to Omaha to six matters more
to Fuld.
"[The individual records] are important to me,
but at this point, they're not nearly as important as
team goals," he said. "1 think it's something you ap
preciate down the road."
While most of his offensive numbers are down,
Fuld has continued to score runs at an efficient rate
when he does get on base and is third on the team
with 56 runs scored. Fuld's defense, as usual, has
been superb, as he boasts a .986 fielding percentage
this season and has committed just one error in Pac
-10 games throughout his career.
Fuld's knack for scoring runs and all-around
tools caught the eye of the Chicago Cubs, who
drafted him in the 24th round of the 2003 major
league draft.
"It was a difficult decision," said Fuld, who will
graduate with an economics degree in June. "It's so
nard to balance the pros and cons and to put a price

tag on coming back here. But I just thought I had a
lot of things to look forward to, coming back here."
Fuld said he has no regrets, but when asked how
much more difficult the decision would have been
had his beloved Boston Red Sox selected him on
draft day, he grinned before admitting, "I honestly
might not be here right now."
Head coach Mark Marquess is as happy he is,
especially with the postseason on the horizon. Fuld
is already the all-time College World Series leader
in hits with 24 and has 45 hits in 34 career postsea
son games.
"I think I thrive under competition. I do like pres
sure and I love competition and I love those big
games," Fuld said.
Don't think fora second that Fuld's mediocre
regular season thus far will change any of that.
"I almost look at every weekend or every new
game as a new season," he said. "I just try to forget
all the poor at-bats and poor games that I've had in
the past year. I just try to stay positive and have a
new, fresh approach every game."

Despite a sub-par season, All-American Sam Fuld has no regrets about spurning the major leagues to
return to Stanford for his senior season.
