With a 3-1 victory over the Hofstra Pride on Saturday, the Stanford
Softball team clinched just its second Women's College World Series
berth in school history. The Cardinal's first trip to Oklahoma City came
in 2001, when the team finished 2-2 in the WCWS and lost in the semifi
nal round to Arizona.
Luckily for the Cardinal (47-17), there's no need to worry about the
Wildcats this year. Arizona, which clinched the Pac-10 regular-season title,
was upset at home by both Oklahoma and Louisiana-Lafayette in the re
gional tournament. The loss brings the Wildcats' NCAA record of 16
straight World Series appearances to a screeching halt.
Despite Arizona's absence, this year's trip to Oklahoma is shaping out
to look a lot like the Cardinal's trip three years ago.
For one, the Cardinal is heading into the World Series after having won
the regional tournament on its own turf.
In 2001, the Cardinal hosted the regional tournament for the first time
in school history. Grabbing the No. 1 seed, the Cardinal cruised through its
first three games, defeating Hofstra, Central Michigan and Nebraska. The
offense combined for 15 runs over the three-day stretch while the pitching
staff limited opponents to just nine hits.
In the double-elimination regional final, Stanford dropped its first game
to the University of Pacific, 2-0. With help from then-sophomore Dana
Sorenson, however, the team rallied back that same afternoon to defeat the
Tigers. 9-1, and clinch its first-ever College World Series berth.
"I can't say enough about the way our team fought back today and con
tinued to battle," head coach John Rittman said at the time.
This year's regional tournament panned out in much the same fashion,
with the Cardinal winning its first three games before heading into the fi
nals. The Cardinal defeated Utah, Pacific and Hofstra and then faced off
against Hofstra again fora two-game elimination final on Sunday.
The Cardinal lost to Hofstra in the first game, 1-0, but was able to
bounce back in the second game later that afternoon to clinch a spot in the
WCWS. As it was three years ago, the team was led the entire way by pitch
er Dana Sorenson, who took home regional MVP honors.
Parallels to the Cardinal's 2001 campaign continue into Oklahoma City
as well. UCLA, Louisiana State, Michigan, Oklahoma and California, all of
whom were on hand for the 2001 World Series, are headed back to Okla
homa this year as well.
The Cardinal's first-ever World Series appearance in 2001 began with a
2-1, first-round victory over Louisiana State. The Cardinal was led by for
mer centerfielder Jessica Mendoza, who went 2-for-3 while knocking in one
of the Cardinal's two runs.
Stanford followed up its first-game victory with a 5-0 loss to UCLA. The
Cardinal's bats were quiet against the Bruin pitchers, generating only three
hits over seven innings.
While the Cardinal was able to stay alive with a 1 -0 victory over Cal that
propelled them into the semifinal round, they quickly faltered again, losing
to conference rival Arizona in the next round, 1-0.
While the Cardinal has taken a similar path to get to Oklahoma as it did
in 2001, the team's main goal is go farther in the tournament than it did
three years ago. Fortunately, this year's squad has much in its favor.
With veterans Jessica Allister and Sorenson at the helm, this year's
squad has the leadership and experience that was largely missing from the
2001 team. As both Allister and Sorenson have World Series experience
under their belts, they know what it takes to compete, and win, at the tour
nament level.
No matter how the Cardinal does in the College World Series, however,
its second tournament appearance in just four years improves its status as a
growing softball powerhouse. Not too shabby fora program that is only 11
years old.
