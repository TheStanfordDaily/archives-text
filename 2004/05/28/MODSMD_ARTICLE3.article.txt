# Band penalty may be shortened

### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
The Band's current three-year al
cohol suspension will be reviewed
again in spring 2005 as a result of the
Band's appeal to Vice Provost of Stu
dent Affairs Gene Awakuni. The Or
ganizational Conduct Board (OCB)
ordered the suspension as a result of
charges stemming from the Band's
Oct. 10 Los Angeles road trip fora
football game against the University
of Southern California.
After the trip, the travel bus was
left in improper condition, with bro
ken equipment and vomit left in the
bathroom sink. The OCB charged the
Band with destruction of private
property, violation of University pol
icy and state law for underage alcohol
consumption and violation of the
University travel policy.
"The length of suspension [three
years] did not seem appropriate given
precedent," said Band Public Rela
tions Director Chris Holt, a sopho
more and columnist at The Daily.
The Band also appealed the travel
ban instituted by the OCB that pre
vents the Band from traveling to or
performing at the Oct. 31 football
game in Los Angeles this year.
"We support athletic teams and
represent the University as a part of
our functionality," Holt said. "By
banning us from travel, we feel that
the University is punishing the athlet
ic teams and greater Stanford com
munity activities that we support."
Awakuni did not remove the
travel ban.
"This is something that Dean of
Students Greg Boardman felt very
strongly about," Awakuni said.
"The violations were so egregious
that he felt they warranted the ban.
I concurred."
The third point in the Band's ap
peal concerned the 1,300-hour com
munity service requirement that was
included in the OCB sanctions — 10
hours for each of the Band's 130
members. However, the Band
claimed that the average "active"
membership of the Band is 90, not
130 members. Awakuni accepted this

argument reduced the number of
community service hours to 990. Fifty
percent of those hours can be served
by musical performances and hours
must still be completed by Dec. 10
this year.
The Band is the first student group
to appeal an OCB decision since the
formation of the OCB two years ago.
Band leaders said they were extreme
ly displeased with the original three
year alcohol suspension — which
would have lasted through winter
quarter 2007 — and called the sanc
tion "over-reactionary."
Under alcohol suspension, alcohol
must be completely removed from
the Band Shak and alcohol is prohib

ited at any Band events or activities,
either on- or off-campus.
In accordance with the results of
the appeal, Boardman and Awakuni
will review the length of the alcohol
suspension in spring quarter 2005 —
one year after the original OCB deci
sion. The conduct of the Band over
the next year will determine whether
or not the alcohol suspension contin
ues until 2007.
"[The status of the Band's alcohol
suspension] would depend on a num
ber of factors, but if their conduct is
exemplary, free of any violations of
campus policy, it's conceivable that
the suspension could be shortened,"
Awakuni said.

The Band has taken steps to en
sure improved conduct into the com
ing year. Band members going on bus
trips have to sign a document stating
the Band's travel policy and the Fun
damental Standard. Alcohol was pro
hibited on buses after the October in
cident, and Band staff members are
now present in a ratio of one staff
member for every 10 Band members
for all road trips.
"We appreciate the administra
tion's serious consideration of our ap
peal," Holt said. "We're confident
that the positive direction the Band is
moving in will continue into next year
and that improvement will show
when the review occurs."
