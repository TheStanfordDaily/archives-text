# Isn't it Ironic: Alanis emerges again with 'So-Called Chaos'
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSIONARY 
Dear Alanis Morissette,
I want you to know... I had a thing for you...
When you sang "You Oughta Know" on 1995's "Jagged
Little Pill," you captured all the rage of a jealous ex-lover (even
if rumor had it that the song was about Dave Coulier from "Full
House"). My heart beat rhythmically with teenage angst and
your album soared, selling some 30 million copies worldwide.
That's right, you put your hand in your pocket and pulled out a
wad of cash.
But then what happened? Alanis, I became worried about
you. You admitted you were a "Supposed Former Infatuation
Junkie;" you ran naked through the video for "Thank U" and
while I'll admit that I readily tapped my foot to "So Pure," I
can't say that I even remember any tracks from your third CD,
"Under Rug Swept." (The title, I hear, was inspired by Yoda.)
However, your new CD, "So-Called Chaos," is an attempt
at redemption. The second track, "Out is Through," offers
enough of a pop chorus to make it probably the most memo
rable song on the album. And the first released single, "Every
thing" (the last track on the CD), refreshes our memory of what
the old Alanis used to be: self-righteous, poetic, innovative.
In fact, on the whole, "So-Called Chaos" offers us a return
to the Alanis of "Jagged Little Pill" of whom we were so fond.

The first track, "Eight Easy Steps," is basically a running

monologue of your inner thoughts, set to music. You

promise to teach us the secrets of life, such as "how

to control someone to be a carbon copy of

you," based on your own experiences.

With thick, lyric-dense songs and in-

ventive instrumentation, the album
gives us a taste of what we've been
longing for since your first album.
The difference with "So-
Called Chaos" is that the tunes are

all a bit more poppy, especially "Doth

I Protest Too Much" and "Knees of My

Bees." Perhaps the rock sound of a more

naive Alanis is missing. While all the songs have aj
lot to say in their lyric intensity, it is hard to simplyj
put the CD on and listen to it. At this point, Ms.

Morrisette, you coir
mand a lot of attention
and so does your

album.
But I must say,
Alanis, that "So-
Called Chaos" is a
step in the right direc-

tion. While it lacks the
rock-rage of "Jagged
Little Pill" or the haunt-

ing vocals of the single '
"Uninvited" (from the

"City of Angels" sound-

track), it's a good listen. And

if you're willing to teach me in 1
"Eight Easy Steps," I'm ready
to jump right in.
