# Roxy on life after Stanford: Great Sexpectations
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
The other night Roxy was standing outside on her balcony
and saw that one of her neighbor's windows was completely
fogged up. It wasn't a particularly humid night — after all, this
is California, not New York — which I took as evidence that
somebody inside was doing some heavy breathing, some hot and
wild little somethin' somethin'.
Now don't think that Rox hasn't steamed up her own win
dows many times this year — I know very well what it looks like.
I leaned over the balcony fora closer look to confirm my suspi
cions and, yes, to indulge my voyeuristic fantasies and become a
Peeping Rox. Binoculars in hand, I thought to myself: So this is
what it's like to be that creepy guy from "American Beauty."
With my eyes intent on the hot-and-heavy action, I caught
snatches of movement: a sweaty wrist, a curved finger. I started
to get excited. I imagined that the bed was near the window and
I'd be privy to a "Titanic"-style streak across the window pane!
1 saw a pale arm move fluidly in the darkness, again and again. I
had to take a long drag of my cigarette, a post-coital nicotine
sympathy fix for this pair of hot bodied lovers.
But then, just as I was about to retreat — very, very turned
on by the scenario unfolding in my head — I spied a swath of
unidentifiable skin. It brushed against the window. "Oh, yeah."
I moaned. "Come on."
And then I spied a shapely, long, thin ... pen. A pen? WTF,
mate? I mean, Rox is all for getting creative with objects, but, a
pen? The ordinary writing utensil maneuvered slowly along the
window and, lo and behold, drew a graph. A bell curve, to be
exact. I cried out — not in a good sort of way, mind you — as the
sad reality shed its murky light over my dark bedroom fantasy.
People were not having sex; they were studying Econ 1028.

With less than three weeks left in spring quarter, 1 know that
we're all scrambling to finish 20-page research papers, catch up
on all the reading we've put aside to lie out, to end the year and
and fly across the country to start internships at Deutsche Bank
and the State Department — but come on, people! Don't forget
the important lesson Roxy has strained all year to teach you —
just like Jell-O, there's always room for sex!
Work is no excuse to ignore those hormonal urges. Testos
terone and estrogen, our little factories of lust, will not be so bru
tally denied — especially during spring, the horniest time of the
year. Spring is the season to throw down that hottie on Wilbur
Field and give him some grass stains. Want to know why koalas
look so happy all the time? 'Cause all those little hornballs do is
eat, have sex and chew cannibus. We should all be so lucky.
This sad, sexless state of affairs has made Rox reflect on her
past few years here at Stanford. And, with a heavy sigh, I must

admit that my great college sexpectations have not been met. I
arrived on campus eager to explore the animalistic terrain of
thumping libidos familiar from so many teen movies (side note:
that Lindsay Lohan is sooo hot right now!). But where are the
dorm rooms that doubled as havens of orgies, the dining hall
boinkfests, the strapping men with washboard abs striding down
the hall in tiny white towels, the sun-kissed girls with jiggling
tatas bicycling to class while sucking on lollipops?
Well, maybe not sucking on lollipops. That was my own ad
dition. But my fantasies did not include baggy Stanford sweat
shirts, which are all too übiquitous. Try a little harder, people.
Much, much harder. So hard that it hurts. If not to fulfill my
raunchy expectations, then to make your own materialize.
But for those of you leaving Stanford for good, hold onto
your great sexpectations and ready them for the real world. Per
haps somewhere beyond the Stanford bubble there are real peo
ple, people who aren't so caught up with work and success that
they're willing to try a little handcuffs-and-whip-cream fun.
Speaking of post-Stanford sex, imagine the possibilities of
a full-size bed. Just think of it — a twin, a queen size, dare I
say it, a California king-sized mattress with a great big head
board to rock and no chance of a roommate knocking on the
door? Walking bare-ass naked to the bathroom without get
ting in trouble with your RA? The benefits are endless: No
worries about vocalizing your pleasure so loudly that some
sad soul in your dorm sends a whining, complaining e-mail out
to the list. Being able to take a cab of shame instead of a walk
of shame. And, if you do walk, chances are you won't run into
five people you know who saw you in the same outfit the night
before. And (hopefully), no waking up to the horrors of a
grimy frat house reeking of beer. Oh yeah, life after Stanford
could be hot.


Can I get a witness? Other than Roxy watching from her balcony,
that is. Voyeurism is the new intramural sport, kids.

mate? I mean, Rox is all for getting creative with objects, but, a
pen? The ordinary writing utensil maneuvered slowly along the
window and, lo and behold, drew a graph. A bell curve, to be
exact. I cried out — not in a good sort of way, mind you — as the
sad reality shed its murky light over my dark bedroom fantasy.
People were not having sex; they were studying Econ 1028.

With less than three weeks left in spring quarter, 1 know that
we're all scrambling to finish 20-page research papers, catch up
on all the reading we've put aside to lie out, to end the year and
and fly across the country to start internships at Deutsche Bank
and the State Department — but come on, people! Don't forget
the important lesson Roxy has strained all year to teach you —
just like Jell-O, there's always room for sex!
Work is no excuse to ignore those hormonal urges. Testos
terone and estrogen, our little factories of lust, will not be so bru
tally denied — especially during spring, the horniest time of the
year. Spring is the season to throw down that hottie on Wilbur
Field and give him some grass stains. Want to know why koalas
look so happy all the time? 'Cause all those little hornballs do is
eat, have sex and chew cannibus. We should all be so lucky.
This sad, sexless state of affairs has made Rox reflect on her
past few years here at Stanford. And, with a heavy sigh, I must

admit that my great college sexpectations have not been met. I
arrived on campus eager to explore the animalistic terrain of
thumping libidos familiar from so many teen movies (side note:
that Lindsay Lohan is sooo hot right now!). But where are the
dorm rooms that doubled as havens of orgies, the dining hall
boinkfests, the strapping men with washboard abs striding down
the hall in tiny white towels, the sun-kissed girls with jiggling
tatas bicycling to class while sucking on lollipops?
Well, maybe not sucking on lollipops. That was my own ad
dition. But my fantasies did not include baggy Stanford sweat
shirts, which are all too übiquitous. Try a little harder, people.
Much, much harder. So hard that it hurts. If not to fulfill my
raunchy expectations, then to make your own materialize.
But for those of you leaving Stanford for good, hold onto
your great sexpectations and ready them for the real world. Per
haps somewhere beyond the Stanford bubble there are real peo
ple, people who aren't so caught up with work and success that
they're willing to try a little handcuffs-and-whip-cream fun.
Speaking of post-Stanford sex, imagine the possibilities of
a full-size bed. Just think of it — a twin, a queen size, dare I
say it, a California king-sized mattress with a great big head
board to rock and no chance of a roommate knocking on the
door? Walking bare-ass naked to the bathroom without get
ting in trouble with your RA? The benefits are endless: No
worries about vocalizing your pleasure so loudly that some
sad soul in your dorm sends a whining, complaining e-mail out
to the list. Being able to take a cab of shame instead of a walk
of shame. And, if you do walk, chances are you won't run into
five people you know who saw you in the same outfit the night
before. And (hopefully), no waking up to the horrors of a
grimy frat house reeking of beer. Oh yeah, life after Stanford
could be hot.


Can I get a witness? Other than Roxy watching from her balcony,
that is. Voyeurism is the new intramural sport, kids.
The other night Roxy was standing outside on her balcony
and saw that one of her neighbor's windows was completely
fogged up. It wasn't a particularly humid night — after all, this
is California, not New York — which I took as evidence that
somebody inside was doing some heavy breathing, some hot and
wild little somethin' somethin'.
Now don't think that Rox hasn't steamed up her own win
dows many times this year — I know very well what it looks like.
I leaned over the balcony fora closer look to confirm my suspi
cions and, yes, to indulge my voyeuristic fantasies and become a
Peeping Rox. Binoculars in hand, I thought to myself: So this is
what it's like to be that creepy guy from "American Beauty."
With my eyes intent on the hot-and-heavy action, I caught
snatches of movement: a sweaty wrist, a curved finger. I started
to get excited. I imagined that the bed was near the window and
I'd be privy to a "Titanic"-style streak across the window pane!
1 saw a pale arm move fluidly in the darkness, again and again. I
had to take a long drag of my cigarette, a post-coital nicotine
sympathy fix for this pair of hot bodied lovers.
But then, just as I was about to retreat — very, very turned
on by the scenario unfolding in my head — I spied a swath of
unidentifiable skin. It brushed against the window. "Oh, yeah."
I moaned. "Come on."
And then I spied a shapely, long, thin ... pen. A pen? WTF,
mate? I mean, Rox is all for getting creative with objects, but, a
pen? The ordinary writing utensil maneuvered slowly along the
window and, lo and behold, drew a graph. A bell curve, to be
