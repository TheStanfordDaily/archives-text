# 'Raising Helen' requires painful labor
## "Does my ass look fat to you?" 
### CHRIS LEE INTERMISSIONARY 
I've heard a vicious rumor that
Garry Marshall once directed
movies. I've heard he even directed
something called "Pretty Woman,"
the film that single-handedly
launched Julia Roberts into super
stardom. I've heard (and in the case
of "Pretty Woman" actually seen)
these things, and yet I still can't

quite reconcile my
self to what 1 saw on
screen this past Tues
day night.
You see friends,
"Raising Helen" is
not really a movie. It
may have certain
movie-like qualities
— the ability to be

projected onto a screen, primarily —
but this doesn't mean that it ought to
be seen by an audience. It may even
boast a more than likeable cast —
Kate Hudson, John Corbett, Joan
Cusack and Helen Mirren are among
its victims — but even these bright
stars can't save themselves from a
meaningless script.
Kate Hudson (bubbly as ever)
plays Helen Harris, a young New
York modeling agent who parties
hard all night and is the most reckless
child in a litter of three grown-up sis
ters. When one of these sisters and
her spouse die in an unfortunate ac
cident, Helen finds herself entrusted
with the three surviving children.
Suddenly gone are her posh apart
ment, the trips to Paris and the flashy
nightlife; in their place are a dilapi
dated Queens flat, Lutheran school
and a demeaning job as a reception
ist at a used car dealership. John Cor
bett plays the minister of the Luther-

an school and Helen's obligatory
love interest.
Hudson applies herself to the
movie with ample charm and has a
wonderful capability for physical
humor; unfortunately her hijinks
with the children prove neither com
pelling nor believable. Simply put,
Helen makes an awful parent even at
her most earnest — she seems com
pletely unfazed when her teenage

niece throws a party
in her apartment,
and then is utterly
incapable of con
fronting that same
niece about stealing
credit cards and
spending an evening
in a motel with a
badass boyfriend.

The film's overall attitude to
wards parenting is more than a little
troubling, not only in Helen's inepti
tude but also in her sisters' inexplica
ble trust in it. Meanwhile Corbett,
well-initiated from stints on "Sex and
the City" and "My Big Fat Greek
Wedding," delivers his lines with
ease while the finicky plot seems un
sure just how much it wants to in
clude him.
To call "Raising Helen" unin
spired would be unfair to Mr. Mar
shall; it takes a fierce vision to pro
duce a film so consistently inane.
Ditto the slipshod script, which
seems to have no intuition for how
real people (or even charming movie
people) interact. But what seems
most puzzling is the whole produc
tion's inability to contrive itself into
something approaching a convincing
structure; scenes are thrown togeth
er just because they seem like scenes
that should belong in a movie, yet
there is no cumulative sense of drive
or purpose.
A little more (maybe less) than
halfway into the film I was ready for
it to end but still had no clue where it
was headed, or even what it might
consider a satisfactory conclusion.
One dead turtle, a hockey team of
pastors and a hippo birthday party
later, I was still clueless. By the time
Helen jubilantly brings a prize ham
home to her children all I could think
was, at least this movie goes after its
own heart. I give half a star for the ra
diant Kate Hudson, who certainly
deserves a better vehicle than this;
and five stars to a lovely girl for en
during this masterpiece with me.
Editors Note: Did Cltris Lee really
watch the movie or was he looking
more at his lovely date? That is the
question. As for Kate Hudson, she
had the sense not to name her baby
Apple. Instead, she named him
Ryder.


Fora guy who has to carry her uphill
for 10 blocks, he sure looks happy. He
must be getting laid.
