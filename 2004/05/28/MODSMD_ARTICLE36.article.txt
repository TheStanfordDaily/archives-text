## SUMMER MOVIE SEASON 
### JOSHUA SMITH FILM CRITIC 
"Something wicked this way comes." If that's the offi
cial tagline for the third installment of the Harry Potter
septology, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"
(and it is), and if the film is directed by Alfonso Cuaron of
"Y Tu Mama Tambien" fame (and it is), you'd probably
expect some seriously sinister sex and nudity to go along
with the enchanting Hogwarts scenery. Unfortunately for
all you Emma Watson fans (or Daniel Radcliffe fans, if
that's your cup of tea), Cuaron forgoes the Harry-
Hermione-Malfoy three-way of his dreams and merely
settles for creating the most comedic, dark, visually stylis
tic and hippogriff-filled "Potter" flick to date.
Whereas Chris Columbus, the director of the first two
installments, did his best to leave no plotline behind,
Cuaron casts non-essential plot elements aside in favor of
maintaining a consistent mood throughout the film. This
can be a bummer when one strapping young audience
member becomes cognizant (much to his chagrin) that

Gryffindor's second Quidditch

match is missing. Yet the
aforementioned
Ik viewer

was
will
ing
to

let that one go in exchange for finally seeing the Hogwarts
castle as The Richest Woman in Britain (a.k.a. J.K. Rowl
ing) must have imagined it.

And inside the woodland
valley where the school for
witchcraft and wizardry is
now situated lies arguably
the most engaging story Ms.
Rowling has yet offered our
Harry-crazed minds. After
Harry accidentally blows up
his nasty Aunt Marge, H.P.
hastily parts company with
the Dursleys and makes his
way to Diagon Alley (so
clever) and the Leaky Caul
dron pub. Once there, Harry
is informed that the recently
escaped Imurderer Sirius
Black is oit to kill him. "

After (lebarking from the Hogwarts Express, the re
mainder o {the story revolves around Harry learning from
new facull y member Prof. Lupin how to expecto patronus
the Deme ltors, figuring out why Sirius is after Our Hero
(apparent y because he's affiliated with He Who Must Not
Be Namei [although this publication will print the F
bomb, it c in't handle the V-word]), and, as always, sneak
ing arount the castle after lights out. Yet again, the fun lies
in seeing ji ist how Harry, Ron and Hermione save the day.
Cuaron gives

this installment a very natural feel. Outdoor scenes are
shot in brilliant sunlight, and the kids wear their own
clothes when not decked out in school robes. Hermione,

in particular, looks like
she walked straight off
the set of a Gap com
mercial, but it's nice to
see that these young
witches and wizards are
just typical capitalist
consumers, no different
than us Muggles. The
stunningly beautiful na
ture settings provide an
exquisite contrast to
that of the dark interi
ors. In short, the film
looks fantastic. Buck
beak, Hagrid's outlaw
hippogriff, appears life-

like and regal; the Dementors will scare the bejeezus out of
the wee ones, and the famed Dementor's kiss is appropri
ately spine chilling.
Year Three also contains some fantastically hilarious
asides, and at least two of them involve a Whomping Wil
low and an exploding bird. An almost unrecognizable
Emma Thompson plays up the laughs as bumbling Pro
fessor Trelawney, and naturally funny-looking Rupert
Grint (Ron) plays to the strengths of his ridiculous facial
expressions for still more humor. Again, Alan Rickman
is deviously funny as Snape.

Rounding out the cast, Michael Gambon's
Dumbledore is more aloof and eccentric than

the late Richard Harris', although his voice

isn't nearly as

soothing. David Thewlis and his mustache play Lupin
very admirably, but fellow newcomer Gary Oldman is
simply too intense and detached (not to mention too old
and unattractive) for Sirius. Emma Watson's Hermione
is cuter than ever, and Daniel Radcliffe is charming in
the title role, although that Jimmy-Stewart-stuttering
thing he does has got to stop before I sick the Head Boy
on him.
Though I would agree that thinning down the plot was
a wise idea (especially in light of the length of the third
book), some essential developments got lost in the book
to-movie translation. The passage of time is much less no
ticeable here than in the previous movies and secondary
characters (like loveable goofball Neville Longbottom)
fade into the background. Most troublingly, however, key
elements of the plot, such as the origin of the Marauders'
Map and Sirius's back-story, are never fully clarified.
Yet this is a minor criticism considering we've all read
the books anyway. In "Prisoner of Azkaban," setting the

proper mood is far more
important than maintain
ing minute plot details. If
this is the criterion for
judging the film (and it is
because I'm the film critic
and I say so), Alfonso
Cuaron's first and only
stint at the helm of the

"Harry Potter" franchise is
remarkably successful. The

series has finally created a

Hogwarts that makes me
want to transfer.

Cuaron gives

this installment a very natural feel. Outdoor scenes are
shot in brilliant sunlight, and the kids wear their own
clothes when not decked out in school robes. Hermione,

in particular, looks like
she walked straight off
the set of a Gap com
mercial, but it's nice to
see that these young
witches and wizards are
just typical capitalist
consumers, no different
than us Muggles. The
stunningly beautiful na
ture settings provide an
exquisite contrast to
that of the dark interi
ors. In short, the film
looks fantastic. Buck
beak, Hagrid's outlaw
hippogriff, appears life-

like and regal; the Dementors will scare the bejeezus out of
the wee ones, and the famed Dementor's kiss is appropri
ately spine chilling.
Year Three also contains some fantastically hilarious
asides, and at least two of them involve a Whomping Wil
low and an exploding bird. An almost unrecognizable
Emma Thompson plays up the laughs as bumbling Pro
fessor Trelawney, and naturally funny-looking Rupert
Grint (Ron) plays to the strengths of his ridiculous facial
expressions for still more humor. Again, Alan Rickman
is deviously funny as Snape.

Rounding out the cast, Michael Gambon's
Dumbledore is more aloof and eccentric than

the late Richard Harris', although his voice

isn't nearly as

soothing. David Thewlis and his mustache play Lupin
very admirably, but fellow newcomer Gary Oldman is
simply too intense and detached (not to mention too old
and unattractive) for Sirius. Emma Watson's Hermione
is cuter than ever, and Daniel Radcliffe is charming in
the title role, although that Jimmy-Stewart-stuttering
thing he does has got to stop before I sick the Head Boy
on him.
Though I would agree that thinning down the plot was
a wise idea (especially in light of the length of the third
book), some essential developments got lost in the book
to-movie translation. The passage of time is much less no
ticeable here than in the previous movies and secondary
characters (like loveable goofball Neville Longbottom)
fade into the background. Most troublingly, however, key
elements of the plot, such as the origin of the Marauders'
Map and Sirius's back-story, are never fully clarified.
Yet this is a minor criticism considering we've all read
the books anyway. In "Prisoner of Azkaban," setting the

proper mood is far more
important than maintain
ing minute plot details. If
this is the criterion for
judging the film (and it is
because I'm the film critic
and I say so), Alfonso
Cuaron's first and only
stint at the helm of the

"Harry Potter" franchise is
remarkably successful. The

series has finally created a

Hogwarts that makes me
want to transfer.




"Something wicked this way comes." If that's the offi
cial tagline for the third installment of the Harry Potter
septology, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"
(and it is), and if the film is directed by Alfonso Cuaron of
"Y Tu Mama Tambien" fame (and it is), you'd probably
expect some seriously sinister sex and nudity to go along
with the enchanting Hogwarts scenery. Unfortunately for
all you Emma Watson fans (or Daniel Radcliffe fans, if
that's your cup of tea), Cuaron forgoes the Harry-
Hermione-Malfoy three-way of his dreams and merely
settles for creating the most comedic, dark, visually stylis
tic and hippogriff-filled "Potter" flick to date.
Whereas Chris Columbus, the director of the first two
installments, did his best to leave no plotline behind,
Cuaron casts non-essential plot elements aside in favor of
maintaining a consistent mood throughout the film. This
can be a bummer when one strapping young audience
member becomes cognizant (much to his chagrin) that

Gryffindor's second Quidditch

match is missing. Yet the
