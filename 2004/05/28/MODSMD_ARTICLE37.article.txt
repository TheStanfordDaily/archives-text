# ‘The Day After Tomorrow’: The future’s not worth the effort
## 
### JP SMITTY INTERMISSION FILMSTER 
Okay, kids. I'm gonna skip the "clever,"
needlessly verbose intro on this one, my last
movie review of Volume Über. So this one
here's for"The Day After Tomorrow," a film
(nay, a movie) that, indicative of its utter lack
of intelligence, has nothing at all to do with its
title. Instead, I'll just relate to you
director/screenwriter extraordinaire (sar
casm!) Roland Emmerich's outlandishly
overblown fanfare of cliches.
Weather everywhere is going bonkers. In
Tokyo, hail the size of golf balls causes a mo
torcyclist to veer inexplicably into a shop win
dow. Meanwhile, in New Delhi, a UN panel on
global warming showcases paleoclimatologist
Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid doing a poor Harri
son Ford impression) at his bombastic finest.
(His astounding scientific truisms are para
phrased below.) Meanwhile, in L.A., tornado
warning! At Hall's homestead, Jack learns
whilst on a phone call with his bitter but beau
tiful ex-wife (Sela Ward) that son Sam (Jake
Gyllenhaal, a.k.a. Donnie Darko) just flunked
calculus. The wife also happens to be an M.D.
specializing in the treatment of cancer-stricken
yet still adorable (yay for Hollywood!) children
and Sam happens to be off to catch a plane for
imminently doomed Manhattan to compete in
the national academic decathlon.
And now for the promised "scientific" dia
logue, nearly verbatim:
Government official: What about the North
Atlantic current?
Jack: Professor Rapson thinks the currents
changed. We've reached a critical desaliniza
tion point.
Woman from NASA: That would explain it.
Okay, I'll spare you the rest.
Question: How do you spend a quarter billion
dollars on a suspense movie that's not sus-

penseful? I'm not sure, but
Emmerich seems to be an ex
pert after producing this dis
aster of a disaster flick. The
principal plot involves Jack
Hall's snowshoe march from
D.C. to the New York public
library where Sam and his de
cathlete compatriots — in
cluding the gorgeous Laura

(Emmy Rossum) and a kind-hearted fraterni
ty type (Austin Nichols) — have taken refuge
from the storm that has completely frozen the
Northeast. What? A 204-mile stroll through
deadly temperatures? And how is the good
paleoclimatologist going to save his son from,
of all things, the weather? Beats the hell out
of me.

It's just too damn bad that all of this half
baked drama and gobbledygook science over
shadow the truly rad CG destruction se
quences. Tidal waves engulf lower Manhattan;
tornadoes chew up downtown Los Angeles,
the Hollywood sign and an obnoxious TV re
porter. That's all we want to see!
"What's that? Audiences don't care about
our corny tree-hugging politics? Too bad, we'll
just shove them down their throats," says
Roland Emmerich (or at least the Emmerich
who magically speaks to me in my imagination).
After all, the film blames the whole killer
weather thing solely on the United States' re
fusal to sign the Kyoto Accords and our greedy
dependence on a high-energy economy. The
vice president (who conspicuously resembles
Dick Cheney) nonchalantly shrugs off warnings
of environmental calamity from the good Dr.
Hall early in the flick, leaving the president (who
conspicuously resembles A1 Gore) with the dif
fcult problem of trying to reopen the Mexican
border for Americans fleeing from the deathly
northern freeze in some kind of stab at U.S. im
migration policy.
Now I'm not at all saying that we environ
mentally conscious Stanford students
shouldn't agree with the political hucksterism
of "Tomorrow," but I would much rather
spend my two hours of escapism watching shit
get demolished than learning about the Kyoto

Accords.
Maybe it's strictly impossi
ble to make a good disaster
flick, but I'm sure it can be
done. I don't require topnotch
verisimilitude, just something
that doesn't have to insult my
cranial capacity to keep me en
tertained. Is that too much to

ask? If "The Day After Tomorrow" is the re
sponse I get, then I guess so.
Editors Note: BS-TV hopes to contribute to global wann
ing and the end of the world by eliminating campus squir
rels, after they win the 2nd ASSU special election.

Tokyo, hail the size of golf balls causes a mo
torcyclist to veer inexplicably into a shop win
dow. Meanwhile, in New Delhi, a UN panel on
global warming showcases paleoclimatologist
Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid doing a poor Harri
son Ford impression) at his bombastic finest.
(His astounding scientific truisms are para
phrased below.) Meanwhile, in L.A., tornado
warning! At Hall's homestead, Jack learns
whilst on a phone call with his bitter but beau
tiful ex-wife (Sela Ward) that son Sam (Jake
Gyllenhaal, a.k.a. Donnie Darko) just flunked
calculus. The wife also happens to be an M.D.
specializing in the treatment of cancer-stricken
yet still adorable (yay for Hollywood!) children
and Sam happens to be off to catch a plane for
imminently doomed Manhattan to compete in
the national academic decathlon.
And now for the promised "scientific" dia
logue, nearly verbatim:
Government official: What about the North
Atlantic current?
Jack: Professor Rapson thinks the currents
changed. We've reached a critical desaliniza
tion point.
Woman from NASA: That would explain it.
Okay, I'll spare you the rest.
Question: How do you spend a quarter billion
dollars on a suspense movie that's not sus-

penseful? I'm not sure, but
Emmerich seems to be an ex
pert after producing this dis
aster of a disaster flick. The
principal plot involves Jack
Hall's snowshoe march from
D.C. to the New York public
library where Sam and his de
cathlete compatriots — in
cluding the gorgeous Laura

(Emmy Rossum) and a kind-hearted fraterni
ty type (Austin Nichols) — have taken refuge
from the storm that has completely frozen the
Northeast. What? A 204-mile stroll through
deadly temperatures? And how is the good
paleoclimatologist going to save his son from,
of all things, the weather? Beats the hell out
of me.

It's just too damn bad that all of this half
baked drama and gobbledygook science over
shadow the truly rad CG destruction se
quences. Tidal waves engulf lower Manhattan;
tornadoes chew up downtown Los Angeles,
the Hollywood sign and an obnoxious TV re
porter. That's all we want to see!
"What's that? Audiences don't care about
our corny tree-hugging politics? Too bad, we'll
just shove them down their throats," says
Roland Emmerich (or at least the Emmerich
who magically speaks to me in my imagination).
After all, the film blames the whole killer
weather thing solely on the United States' re
fusal to sign the Kyoto Accords and our greedy
dependence on a high-energy economy. The
vice president (who conspicuously resembles
Dick Cheney) nonchalantly shrugs off warnings
of environmental calamity from the good Dr.
Hall early in the flick, leaving the president (who
conspicuously resembles A1 Gore) with the dif
fcult problem of trying to reopen the Mexican
border for Americans fleeing from the deathly
northern freeze in some kind of stab at U.S. im
migration policy.
Now I'm not at all saying that we environ
mentally conscious Stanford students
shouldn't agree with the political hucksterism
of "Tomorrow," but I would much rather
spend my two hours of escapism watching shit
get demolished than learning about the Kyoto

Accords.
Maybe it's strictly impossi
ble to make a good disaster
flick, but I'm sure it can be
done. I don't require topnotch
verisimilitude, just something
that doesn't have to insult my
cranial capacity to keep me en
tertained. Is that too much to

ask? If "The Day After Tomorrow" is the re
sponse I get, then I guess so.
