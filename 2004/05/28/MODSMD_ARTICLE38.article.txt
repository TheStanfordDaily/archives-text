### MIKE ORME INTERMISSIONARY 
To call The Secret Machines' "Now Here

is Nowhere" a debut album is some
what of a misnomer. True, it is the Se-

cret Machines' first full-length and
the first fruits of their major-label
deal with Reprise Records, but it ,
appears two years after "Septem- |
ber 000." the band's critically-ac
claimed HP released on Ace Fu, and

by the sound of this album, the band

has already managed to refine their
sound for their big-time appearance.

Formed in Dallas in the summer of 2000,
the Secret Machines offered "September
000" as the result of months of recording ses
sions with engineer Brian Deck, and on the
disc established their spacey, psychedelic
modus operandi with an obtuse sound mod
elled after Led Zeppelin early Flaming Lips.
No matter that vocalist Brandon Curtis
sounded like a cheap Gavin Rossdale (in
other words: a poor Kurt Cobain); "Septem
ber 000" wowed critics with well-written
melodies, expansive arrangements, and taste
fully-picked tributes.
Record executives took notice of "Sep
tember 000," and after a small bidding war for
the band, Reprise came out on top last year,
signing the band to a three-record deal. "Now
Here is Nowhere," the Secret Machines' first
album for Reprise, was streamed online in
mid-February, and Reprise sold the album
online before its official release a few weeks
ago. Word is online sales didn't quite measure
up to Reprise's expectations; no matter, be
cause this hotly-anticipated record has hit the
ground running and has a bona-fide radio hit
"Sad and Lonely" on the airwaves.
For "Now Here is Nowhere," the Ma
chines have beefed up their sound and their
studio presence. Whereas songs on "Septem

ber 000" often meandered and melodically
droned, the psychedelia on "Now Here is
Nowhere" is tight and focused. The nine
minute space-rock epic "First Wave In-

tact" opens the disc and proves

the Machines haven't sold out

(no band out to make a quick

buck would open their
record with a nine-minute
song), but its catchy riffs and
melody proves the Secret

Machines have taken some

well-deserved liberties in the

major label studio.

The aforementioned first single
"Sad and Lonely" continues the expansive
sound, taking influences from many different
directions. The large, multi-tracked choruses
recall Pink Floyd, the Who, and even U2, and
while it never strays too far from the canoni
cal Secret Machines sound, it maintains a
clear pop focus.
Classic rock influences appear all over the
album in tasteful bits. "Nowhere Again" and
the title track display the Machines' affection
for Neu, but they subtly turn the Kraut-rock
drone into a punk-pop, new-wave hybrid.
Somehow, the Secret Machines combine a
whole host of influences like 70's psychedelia,
80's rock, and 90's indie and make the results
sound fresh, if not quite groundbreaking.
The formula employed on "Now Here is
Nowhere" is a dangerous one: adding major
label production to a decidedly indie-rock
sound. However, the Secret Machines have
managed to avoid marginalizing their sound,
a pitfall which has hurt bands like Grandaddy.
Hopefully the band can continue to strike the
balance between radio-friendly and experi
mental, but if the Secret Machines has under
gone this much positive change already I
don't think they'll have to worry much about
a "sophomore slump."
