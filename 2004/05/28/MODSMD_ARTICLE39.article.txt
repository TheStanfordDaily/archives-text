# Do you dare to 'Love Me'?
## 
### CHRIS LEE INTERMISSION FILM STAR 
Ah. the French. Say what you will about
their politics, but in their films they're all

about a delirious, almost
childlike passion for life — a
life viewed in vibrant, surreal
colors, with Love (always a
capital L) graffitied across
the sky and shouted from the
rooftops.
Or so director Yann
Samuell would have you be
lieve. His new film, "Love

Me if You Dare," borrows heavily from the
style of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's "Amelie," not

only in its whimsical visual effects but

also in a frenetic editing pace that

seems to insist that life (at least in

the movies) is a non-

stop rush, with

zooming cam
era moves and
an overheight
ened sense of

reality that
leaves you
both gasping

and praying it
will never
stop. Except
this ride has a
harder edge
to it, a hap
hazard dose
of reality that
is in some re-

spects more
debilitating

0
than re
warding.

The
story's

main
protag-

onists
are
k

Julien (Guillaume Canet) and Sophie (Mari
on Cotillard), two childhood friends who grow
up to become mutually destructive lovers.
Their relationship centers around a game that
involves exchanging a magical tin merry-go-

round; whoever holds the tin
must perform whatever dare is
suggested by the other. In their
earlier years, the pranks are in
nocuous: mouthing off to
teachers in class, peeing in the
principal's office, etc.
As the two grow older, how
ever, and realize (naturally)
that they love each other, the

game becomes laced with a strange sense of
sadomasochism — eventually they're daring
each other to sleep with other people, deliber
ately trying to wound each other "Cruel In
tentions"-style. This culminates in more than
a few extended periods of separation, where
each tries to live a normal life and forget about
the other. Of course, this is impossible; before
it's all over we witness a crashed wedding, a
couple abandoned marriages, a crushed fa
ther and a near fatal car accident — all for the
game that can never stop.
The film stakes itself to that most romantic
of concepts — that a single relationship can
define your entire life, to the point where the
actions of everyone else around you seem
muted and superfluous — but it often goes
too far in being needlessly cruel towards its
secondary characters. We enter Julien's child
hood just as his mother is dying of cancer, and
while this backstory is meant to highlight his
developing attachment to Sophie the weight
of that loss is never fully reconciled. Julien's
father grows to hate Sophie for taking his son
away from him, but the movie ends up skirting
this issue instead of mining it for any real
truths. Likewise, Julien's wife (the one whose
wedding is ruined) and Sophie's soccer-star
husband are given short shrift — they're just
simple pawns waiting to be sacrificed to the
real story.
For some, these offenses will seem unfor
givable; for hopeless romantics, though, the
rest of the movie is still the equivalent of love
heroin. Yes, the plot subjugates everyone else
to the whims of the lovers — particularly the
poor victims of their pranks — but for the
most part it successfully barrels past these pot
holes to arrive at several scenes of pure rap
ture: When Julien goes speeding down a high
way trying to outrun the police cruisers chas-

ing him because Sophie has framed him for
breaking into her house, he screams with

pure catharsis, alive again after so many
years away from Sophie's irresistible de-

struction. If you're game for Samuell's

warped logic, you'll feel compelled to

lOt J I
join him. Life may never have quite

the amount of verve or vim we see

in the movies, but every so

often isn't it lovely to think

so?
