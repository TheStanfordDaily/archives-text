BARRETT W. SHERIDAN & TAMATHA VO
INTERMISSION EDITORS

If you're reading this, the lowly page eight ed
itors' note, we thank you. Or we're sorry. We're
not quite sure which is more appropriate.

It has been a roller coaster of a volume, filled
with unimpressive cliches like the one that starts
this sentence. You'd think that we'd be able to

discern good writing from bad
by this point, but somehow, in
evitably, the shit always stinks
up the potpourri.
Now that four-and-a-half
months of Intermission Vol
ume Über are coming to a
swift and rather uneventful
close, it's time to take stock:
Modest Mouse has taken over
the college indie-rock scene.
Michael Powell has taken
over the First Amendment
(and shat upon it). Lindsay
Lohan has become the mas
turbatory focus of teen-aged
and college-aged boys coun
trywide. Travis Morrison of
The Dismemberment Plan is
touring solo, and it makes Bar
rett very, very happy. The
death of the Mountain Lion
remains uninvestigated and
uncompensated. With a full
49 votes in the first round of
the special election, the BS
TV campaign was a complete
success.
Are we better off now than
we were four-and-a-half
months ago? Probably not.
We've trampled journalistic
standards, mocked ethical
guidelines, and blatantly dis
obeyed the Daily's steadfast
style guide by (occasionally)
refusing to remove the comma
before the last item in a list.
Still, just like with the Bush
Administration, a lucky few
are better off while the rest
suffer. Those lucky few de
serve recognition for their
selflessness, so here we go. A
big, sloppy thank you kiss to
the following:
* The illustrious Jennie Kim,
layout artiste and goddess of
infinite patience.
* The appendix-less wonder,

Anna North, always willing to interview curly
haired composers and tofu-wielding vegans for
the good of Intermission.
* Anna "Banana" Galan, whose Quark expertise
saved the day many-a-time and prevented Bar
rett from throwing something at one of those shit
ty Macs in the office.
* Joshua Paul Smith, our eternal cinema-critic,
who never turned down a press pass and a post
movie snack at Mel's Diner in San Francisco.
* Cover girls Beth Liehert and Jaireh Tecarro for
satisfying our visual ADD with high-resolution
and hypnotic graphics
* Graphics guru Wayne Li for saving our sorry
asses with tasteful covers featuring hamsters and
trees with boners.
* Last but not least, outgoing Editor-in-Chief B-
Money for allowing Tam to be Barrett's co-editor
in the first place. That was probably your worst
decision ever.
To our Intermissionaries, we love you. You
never questioned our dubious authority as we
sent you to low-carb gourmet store openings,
asked you to conduct social experiments under
cover and forced you to watch movies involving
Julia Stiles and the Prince of Denmark.
Our spiel has, more or less, come to an end,
but we still have some space to kill. Tarn's favorite
outfit of the year incorporates her Vietnamese
rice farmer hat. Barrett had a dream last month
about unicorns. (Don't laugh.) Tam gives free
backwalks and massages. Barrett is fond of
striped shirts. You guys never sent in name sug
gestions for our Intermission mascot, the happy
hamster. Editor in chief Brendan Marten was
caught drunk and disorderly in photographs now
controlled by the Chaparral. At least one person
that voted for Chioke and Kory in the special
election has used mushrooms (the kind with
psilocybin, not the kind for cooking). Mikey Lee
hates melted ice cream with a fiery passion. Dylan
Mefford plans to sue - and sue, and sue, and sue.
So goodbye, we're off, just like black Cadillacs
in front of a funeral. Tam will probably be back to
usher you through another volume of pop culture
and consumer whoreism, but Barrett's off to a
country whose prison abuse scandals exist only in
its past. Even if we're voted by The Daily staff as
worst couple, we'll still be united in our loathing
of that travesty of network TV, "The O.C" and
our undying love for Paris Hilton.

Editors' Note: This is one. You're reading it.


Picture not to scale — Intermission editor Tam Vo is actually smaller in real life,
and Barrett Sheridan is not quite as orange-yellow.
