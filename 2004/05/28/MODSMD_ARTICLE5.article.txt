If student groups and the new Institute for the En
vironment succeed, the University may witness the
blossoming of a broader, more unified environmental
coalition in the coming year.
The directors of the new institute met with leaders
from a dozen student organizations last week to try to
create working relationships on environmental issues
and to figure out what the institute could do to address
student concerns. Afterwards, students said they were
optimistic about their involvement with the interdisci

to brainstorm ideas about how the institute can best

serve student interests and financially support stu

"Student organizations play a critical role within
the University," Thompson said. "They organize sym

community education, and we want to make sure that
we support those student organizations in whatever
ways we can."
Represented at the meeting were 12 organizations
from a variety of disciplines and with a diverse array of
perspectives.
"I'm pleased that so many students were interested
and came out to learn more about where the commu
nity is going in coming years," said sophomore Danny
Cullenward, who organized the panel.
He added, "There were a lot of people there who
hadn't worked with one another who were able to
touch base. Some of the business and medical school
groups are looking for ways to involve the larger Stan
ford community in their activities, and now they're in
touch with their undergraduate counterparts. Some of
the undergraduate groups looking for expertise be
yond their experience and can now turn to their grad-
