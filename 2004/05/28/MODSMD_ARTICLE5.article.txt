# New institute will try to link environmental groups
## 
### JEFFREY ERFE 
If student groups and the new Institute for the En
vironment succeed, the University may witness the
blossoming of a broader, more unified environmental
coalition in the coming year.
The directors of the new institute met with leaders
from a dozen student organizations last week to try to
create working relationships on environmental issues
and to figure out what the institute could do to address
student concerns. Afterwards, students said they were
optimistic about their involvement with the interdisci
plinary institute.
"It sounds like there is real potential to harness the
interest and energy of the full spectrum of student in
volvement in — and commitment to — environmen
tal issues," said law student Peter Morgan, co-presi
dent of the Environmental Law Society at Stanford.
The institute's directors — Civil and Environmen
tal Engineering Prof. Jeff Koseff and Law Prof. Buzz
Thompson — said they wished to better understand
the mission of each group, plan collaborative upcom
ing events and discuss ways to coordinate future ef
forts effectively. An additional goal of the meeting was
to brainstorm ideas about how the institute can best

serve student interests and financially support stu
dent-driven environmental initiatives.
"Student organizations play a critical role within
the University," Thompson said. "They organize sym
posiums, initiate classes, pull together materials for
community education, and we want to make sure that
we support those student organizations in whatever
ways we can."
Represented at the meeting were 12 organizations
from a variety of disciplines and with a diverse array of
perspectives.
"I'm pleased that so many students were interested
and came out to learn more about where the commu
nity is going in coming years," said sophomore Danny
Cullenward, who organized the panel.
He added, "There were a lot of people there who
hadn't worked with one another who were able to
touch base. Some of the business and medical school
groups are looking for ways to involve the larger Stan
ford community in their activities, and now they're in
touch with their undergraduate counterparts. Some of
the undergraduate groups looking for expertise be
yond their experience and can now turn to their grad-
uate companions.
Sophomore Ronald Chan, Stanford in Government's incoming director of state
and local fellowships, confirmed this sentiment.
"Before the conference, I wasn't aware that there are so many student groups or
initiatives that deal with environmental issues," he said. "The meeting gave us a
venue where we could get to know what each other is doing and how we may col
laborate to further our causes."
Students noted that this was not the first attempt to create a coalition of similar
student groups, but some said this one might be more successful. The Greens at
Stanford are currently trying to organize a different coalition of progressive groups
to coordinate activities.
"Student groups often try and frequently fail to form successful coalitions on
campus; this one has a good chance of succeeding because of the faculty and Uni
versity support," said Green member Tim Telleen-Lawton, a junior.
The faculty support is a unique aspect to this collaboration, one student said, es
pecially among environmental groups.
"There is still often a feeling among some administrators at Stanford that a stu
dent promoting environmental issues is necessarily an antagonistic tree-hugger and,
among students, that the administration may not be supportive of our initiatives be
fore we even asked them about it," said business student Greg Boutin, co-president
of the Graduate School of Business Energy Club.
Koseff and Thompson said that in the future, students will be appointed to many
different institute committees, including an advisory student cabinet. Representa
tives would include leaders of campus environmental groups as well as students ma
joring in environmental fields.
Both the institute and student groups said they hope to link their various Web
sites to synchronize faculty-student and intergroup efforts. The institute plans to de
velop a Web portal (http://environment.stanford.edu) displaying student group in
formation and perhaps even a calendar of campus events. Currently, the Greens at
Stanford are also constructing a similar site (http://converge.stanford.edu) to serve
as a nexus for the progressive activist community at Stanford.
Because the planning for many of these programs is still in "sub-infancy," Koseff
did not yet have a definitive timeline for most of the ideas.
"In the first year or so, we will start some but each year the institute will be doing
more and more," Thompson said.
In their capacities as both professors and environmentalists, Koseff and Thomp
son said there are multiple avenues through which students engage environmental
issues and that working with students both inside and outside the classroom is es
sential for the institute.
"Students, when they look at Stanford, they don't see it the same way we do,"
Koseff said. "They don't see departments, they see what they need. 'This is what I
need, and I don't care where it comes from.' They challenge us in a very positive way
to come up with inter and multidisciplinary ways to solve those problems. They're
great integrators and catalysts for change."

sites to synchronize faculty-student and intergroup efforts. The institute plans to de
velop a Web portal (http://environment.stanford.edu) displaying student group in
formation and perhaps even a calendar of campus events. Currently, the Greens at
Stanford are also constructing a similar site (http://converge.stanford.edu) to serve
as a nexus for the progressive activist community at Stanford.
Because the planning for many of these programs is still in "sub-infancy," Koseff
did not yet have a definitive timeline for most of the ideas.
"In the first year or so, we will start some but each year the institute will be doing
more and more," Thompson said.
In their capacities as both professors and environmentalists, Koseff and Thomp
son said there are multiple avenues through which students engage environmental
issues and that working with students both inside and outside the classroom is es
sential for the institute.
"Students, when they look at Stanford, they don't see it the same way we do,"
Koseff said. "They don't see departments, they see what they need. 'This is what I
need, and I don't care where it comes from.' They challenge us in a very positive way
to come up with inter and multidisciplinary ways to solve those problems. They're
great integrators and catalysts for change."
If student groups and the new Institute for the En
vironment succeed, the University may witness the
blossoming of a broader, more unified environmental
coalition in the coming year.
The directors of the new institute met with leaders
from a dozen student organizations last week to try to
create working relationships on environmental issues
and to figure out what the institute could do to address
student concerns. Afterwards, students said they were
optimistic about their involvement with the interdisci
plinary institute.
"It sounds like there is real potential to harness the
interest and energy of the full spectrum of student in
volvement in — and commitment to — environmen
tal issues," said law student Peter Morgan, co-presi
dent of the Environmental Law Society at Stanford.
The institute's directors — Civil and Environmen
tal Engineering Prof. Jeff Koseff and Law Prof. Buzz
Thompson — said they wished to better understand
the mission of each group, plan collaborative upcom
ing events and discuss ways to coordinate future ef
forts effectively. An additional goal of the meeting was
to brainstorm ideas about how the institute can best

serve student interests and financially support stu
dent-driven environmental initiatives.
"Student organizations play a critical role within
the University," Thompson said. "They organize sym
posiums, initiate classes, pull together materials for
community education, and we want to make sure that
we support those student organizations in whatever
ways we can."
Represented at the meeting were 12 organizations
from a variety of disciplines and with a diverse array of
perspectives.
"I'm pleased that so many students were interested
and came out to learn more about where the commu
nity is going in coming years," said sophomore Danny
Cullenward, who organized the panel.
He added, "There were a lot of people there who
hadn't worked with one another who were able to
touch base. Some of the business and medical school
groups are looking for ways to involve the larger Stan
ford community in their activities, and now they're in
touch with their undergraduate counterparts. Some of
the undergraduate groups looking for expertise be
yond their experience and can now turn to their grad-
uate companions.
Sophomore Ronald Chan, Stanford in Government's incoming director of state
and local fellowships, confirmed this sentiment.
"Before the conference, I wasn't aware that there are so many student groups or
initiatives that deal with environmental issues," he said. "The meeting gave us a
venue where we could get to know what each other is doing and how we may col
laborate to further our causes."
Students noted that this was not the first attempt to create a coalition of similar
student groups, but some said this one might be more successful. The Greens at
Stanford are currently trying to organize a different coalition of progressive groups
to coordinate activities.
"Student groups often try and frequently fail to form successful coalitions on
campus; this one has a good chance of succeeding because of the faculty and Uni
versity support," said Green member Tim Telleen-Lawton, a junior.
The faculty support is a unique aspect to this collaboration, one student said, es
pecially among environmental groups.
"There is still often a feeling among some administrators at Stanford that a stu
dent promoting environmental issues is necessarily an antagonistic tree-hugger and,
among students, that the administration may not be supportive of our initiatives be
fore we even asked them about it," said business student Greg Boutin, co-president
of the Graduate School of Business Energy Club.
Koseff and Thompson said that in the future, students will be appointed to many
different institute committees, including an advisory student cabinet. Representa
tives would include leaders of campus environmental groups as well as students ma
joring in environmental fields.
