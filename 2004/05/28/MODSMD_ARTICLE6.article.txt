# Chioke and Kory ready for office, set for ASSU outreach
## 
### DAWN CARDON 
Despite constitutional questions
that remain unresolved, sophomores
Chioke Borgelt-Mose and Kory Var
gas Caro said they are optimistic and
looking toward the coming year. They
described themselves as "ready to go"
and full of new ideas.
The future executives' main plans
aim to address complaints about the
ASSU's inaccessibility to the student
body it represents. Vargas Caro attrib
uted the lack of communication be
tween the ASSU and students to issues

such as the special-fees problems, which
require the ASSU to "deal with very
fine details about rules and regulations."
Both Borgelt-Mose and Vargas
Caro said they are confident that the
special-fees problems have been re
solved for the most part, and that the
ASSU can and should successfully
focus on more outreach.
"Students don't look toward the
ASSU because they don't know what
resources are available," Borgelt-
Mose said.
She and Vargas Caro plan to coun
teract this by sending ASSU represen

tatives to dorms on a regular basis to let
students know what's happening, she
explained.
One proposed method for getting
students more involved in and aware of
ASSU activities is by continuing pro
grams such as Absolute Fun and the
textbook buy-hack program. Borgelt-
Mose and Vargas Caro also aim to in
stitute an ASSU equipment rental pro
gram that would allow student groups
to rent items for events directly from
the ASSU at much lower rates than
they currently pay.
The long and messy executive elec-

tions stirred up many complaints, in
cluding those centering on the relative
ly small number of ballots cast in the
special election as compared to the
original executive election. Borgelt-
Mose and Vargas Caro, however, said
that their work campaigning for the
special election was a success.
Vargas Caro said that a major cam
paign goal was "to educate students
not only on the date of the special elec
tion but on the reasons why it was tak
ing place."
Both praised the hard work of their
campaign managers, who, Vargas

Caro said, "got it together." Their work
was witnessed across campus in the
abundance of Chioke/Kory t-shirts,
posters and flyers.
Vargas Caro said he had expected
fewer voters in the special election
because the previous election coin
cided with votes for class presidents,
the Undergraduate Senate and spe
cial fees. Both Borgelt-Mose and
Vargas Caro maintained that they
were happy with the process and with
the results.
Borgelt-Mose and Vargas Caro
added that they appreciate the work

done by current Presidents Nadiya
Figueroa and Vice President Joey Na
toli, who instituted the Absolute Fun
campaign and textbook purchasing
service.
Vargas Caro emphasized his desire
to take advantage of the rest of the quar
ter to work with the slate's predecessors.
Over the summer he and Borgelt-
Mose plan to meet with administrators,
the Graduate Student Council and stu
dents on campus to discuss new ideas.
"Were ready to begin and get our
feet very, very wet." Borgelt-Mose said.
"We're just happy," Vargas Carosaid.
