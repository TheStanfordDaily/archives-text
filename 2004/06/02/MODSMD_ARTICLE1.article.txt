# MEChA to obtain Univ. event funding
## 
### ERIC ELDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Talks between student leaders in the Latino community and University ad
ministrators have so far resulted in the partial funding of up to nine major events
formerly jointly funded with MEChA, the umbrella Chicano / Latino student or
ganization on campus. The organization and its subgroups, however, are still
searching for ways to make up the remaining budget gap that resulted from the
loss of its special-fees request for the coming year.
This April, MEChA was not approved for the $35,564 that it had requested,
with 50.52 percent of the student body voting against the group's request.
Around twenty student leaders involved in the Stanford Latino community
formed a "Friends of Centro" working group on the day that the election results
were announced — April 9 — to figure out how to redress the anticipated loss of
funds for MEChA-associated groups in the next year.
After a well-attended town hall meeting on the subject, the Friends of Centro
chose nine campus-wide events which they believed the University would likely
support financially because of the events' institutional status, high attendance
and campus impact, said modern thought and literature coterminal student
Monica Henestroza, the MEChA financial officer for 2004.
These nine "flagship" events had received a combined $19,000 from the
MEChA special fee. They are: Dia de los Muertos, La Gran Posada, Zoot Suit
Week, Cinco de Mayo, Cesar Chavez Commemoration, Raza Day Conference,
Floricanto, C'oncierto de la Primavera and Nuestra Graduation.
Frances Morales, the director of El Centro Chicano, said that MEChA —
and the funds that it has had up through this year — have been crucial parts of
the Stanford Latino community and of the center.
"By pooling our resources we can
accomplish El Centra's mission of
creating an environment that cele
brates and promotes the history,
contributions, intellectual heritage,
education and growth and empow
erment of all Chicanos and Lati
nos," she said.
The Friends have affiliations to pre
vious El Centro student staff and to 14
Latino community organizations.
On May 10, Friends representatives
met with Gene Awakuni, vice provost
for student affairs, and he committed
to helping them secure at least 50 per
cent of their institutionalized funding
request, said sophomore Nico Bartelo,
an incoming member of the Guiding
Concilio, El Centra's advisory board,
who attended the meeting.
In a meeting last Friday, Awakuni
told the Friends that he was committed
to meeting their request in full, al
though the sources of funding are not

yet finalized, Henestroza added.
Awakuni said that El Centro will
not have significantly less money to
work with than last year and that
Dean of Students Greg Boardman
will be chairing a study group to "look
into the issue of funding support for
student groups to see what might be
done to address the large and growing
demand for resources."
"We want to make sure the pro
grams that MEChA sponsors con
tinue to be held," he said. "These
programs have contributed signifi
cantly to creating a culturally rich
Stanford community."
Henestroza said the Friends were
also excited to hear that Awakuni will
try to increase the base-level funding of
El Centro Chicano, as all other five
community centers, for the fiscal year
of 2005-2006.
"Over time, we'd like to see funding
increase for community-center affiliat
ed groups as well as all other student
groups," Awakuni said. "Why? The
number of student groups keeps rising.
We want to help students reduce the
amount of time they spend trying to
raise money."

Nadiya Figueroa, a senior, said that
the special-fees system itself was
part of the problem.
"From our side, I never really
doubted that the funding would be
found for MEChA given the impor
tance of the work that they do," she
said. "But it's sad that additional stu
dent time and additional University
resources had to go into this funding
issue because they were voted down
in special fees.
"This speaks to the inadequacies of
the special-fees system that is in place
now, that groups whose activities are
vital to student life don't have secure
funding," she added.
Sophomore Francisco Cendejas,
the outgoing MEChA co-chair, said
that other MEChA-associated
groups with a more limited reach
will not be funded by the University,
so it would be a "mislabel" to say
that the organization itself is now
being fully funded again.
"Likely, we'll go into our reserve
funds to patch up the holes," he said.
"Especially for the subgroups that
have larger expenses but would have
trouble getting general-fee funding by
themselves, such as Chicanos in Health

Education, and Familia — the Latino
LGTB group."
Normal ways that students get
funding for groups, Henestroza said,
such as The Stanford Fund and the
ASSU general fee that in part finances
smaller student groups, may not be suf
ficient to cover the budget gap caused
by the loss of MEChA's special fees.
"MEChA did apply for early dis
cretionary funding from the general
programming fee — which it could
not do previously because it was a
special-fee group," said current
ASSU Senate Chair Chris Lin, a ju
nior. "To my understanding, some of
MEChA's groups under its former
special-fee umbrella will also be ap
plying for funding in 2004-2005."
Henestroza said that the finan
cial support from dorms and hous
es is another possible of source of
income, and that the co-op Synergy
had already decided to help sup
port MEChA.
"We encourage houses with
extra money at the end of the year
to consider applying their funds to
ward the continuation of programs
such as [MEChA-funded] ESL tu
toring," she added.

Concilio, El Centra's advisory board,
who attended the meeting.
In a meeting last Friday, Awakuni
told the Friends that he was committed
to meeting their request in full, al
though the sources of funding are not

yet finalized, Henestroza added.
Awakuni said that El Centro will
not have significantly less money to
work with than last year and that
Dean of Students Greg Boardman
will be chairing a study group to "look
into the issue of funding support for
student groups to see what might be
done to address the large and growing
demand for resources."
"We want to make sure the pro
grams that MEChA sponsors con
tinue to be held," he said. "These
programs have contributed signifi
cantly to creating a culturally rich
Stanford community."
Henestroza said the Friends were
also excited to hear that Awakuni will
try to increase the base-level funding of
El Centro Chicano, as all other five
community centers, for the fiscal year
of 2005-2006.
"Over time, we'd like to see funding
increase for community-center affiliat
ed groups as well as all other student
groups," Awakuni said. "Why? The
number of student groups keeps rising.
We want to help students reduce the
amount of time they spend trying to
raise money."
Outgoing ASSU President

Nadiya Figueroa, a senior, said that
the special-fees system itself was
part of the problem.
"From our side, I never really
doubted that the funding would be
found for MEChA given the impor
tance of the work that they do," she
said. "But it's sad that additional stu
dent time and additional University
resources had to go into this funding
issue because they were voted down
in special fees.
"This speaks to the inadequacies of
the special-fees system that is in place
now, that groups whose activities are
vital to student life don't have secure
funding," she added.
Sophomore Francisco Cendejas,
the outgoing MEChA co-chair, said
that other MEChA-associated
groups with a more limited reach
will not be funded by the University,
so it would be a "mislabel" to say
that the organization itself is now
being fully funded again.
"Likely, we'll go into our reserve
funds to patch up the holes," he said.
"Especially for the subgroups that
have larger expenses but would have
trouble getting general-fee funding by
themselves, such as Chicanos in Health

Education, and Familia — the Latino
LGTB group."
Normal ways that students get
funding for groups, Henestroza said,
such as The Stanford Fund and the
ASSU general fee that in part finances
smaller student groups, may not be suf
ficient to cover the budget gap caused
by the loss of MEChA's special fees.
"MEChA did apply for early dis
cretionary funding from the general
programming fee — which it could
not do previously because it was a
special-fee group," said current
ASSU Senate Chair Chris Lin, a ju
nior. "To my understanding, some of
MEChA's groups under its former
special-fee umbrella will also be ap
plying for funding in 2004-2005."
Henestroza said that the finan
cial support from dorms and hous
es is another possible of source of
income, and that the co-op Synergy
had already decided to help sup
port MEChA.
"We encourage houses with
extra money at the end of the year
to consider applying their funds to
ward the continuation of programs
such as [MEChA-funded] ESL tu
toring," she added.
Talks between student leaders in the Latino community and University ad
ministrators have so far resulted in the partial funding of up to nine major events
formerly jointly funded with MEChA, the umbrella Chicano / Latino student or
ganization on campus. The organization and its subgroups, however, are still
searching for ways to make up the remaining budget gap that resulted from the
loss of its special-fees request for the coming year.
This April, MEChA was not approved for the $35,564 that it had requested,
with 50.52 percent of the student body voting against the group's request.
Around twenty student leaders involved in the Stanford Latino community
formed a "Friends of Centro" working group on the day that the election results
were announced — April 9 — to figure out how to redress the anticipated loss of
funds for MEChA-associated groups in the next year.
After a well-attended town hall meeting on the subject, the Friends of Centro
chose nine campus-wide events which they believed the University would likely
support financially because of the events' institutional status, high attendance
and campus impact, said modern thought and literature coterminal student
Monica Henestroza, the MEChA financial officer for 2004.
These nine "flagship" events had received a combined $19,000 from the
MEChA special fee. They are: Dia de los Muertos, La Gran Posada, Zoot Suit
Week, Cinco de Mayo, Cesar Chavez Commemoration, Raza Day Conference,
Floricanto, C'oncierto de la Primavera and Nuestra Graduation.
Frances Morales, the director of El Centro Chicano, said that MEChA —
and the funds that it has had up through this year — have been crucial parts of
the Stanford Latino community and of the center.
"By pooling our resources we can
accomplish El Centra's mission of
creating an environment that cele
brates and promotes the history,
contributions, intellectual heritage,
education and growth and empow
erment of all Chicanos and Lati
nos," she said.
The Friends have affiliations to pre
vious El Centro student staff and to 14
Latino community organizations.
On May 10, Friends representatives
met with Gene Awakuni, vice provost
for student affairs, and he committed
to helping them secure at least 50 per
cent of their institutionalized funding
request, said sophomore Nico Bartelo,
an incoming member of the Guiding
Concilio, El Centra's advisory board,
who attended the meeting.
In a meeting last Friday, Awakuni
told the Friends that he was committed
