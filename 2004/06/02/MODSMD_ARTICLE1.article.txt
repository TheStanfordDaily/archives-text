# MEChA to obtain Univ. event funding
## 
### ERIC ELDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Talks between student leaders in the Latino community and University ad
ministrators have so far resulted in the partial funding of up to nine major events
formerly jointly funded with MEChA, the umbrella Chicano / Latino student or
ganization on campus. The organization and its subgroups, however, are still
searching for ways to make up the remaining budget gap that resulted from the
loss of its special-fees request for the coming year.
This April, MEChA was not approved for the $35,564 that it had requested,
with 50.52 percent of the student body voting against the group's request.
Around twenty student leaders involved in the Stanford Latino community
formed a "Friends of Centro" working group on the day that the election results
were announced — April 9 — to figure out how to redress the anticipated loss of
funds for MEChA-associated groups in the next year.
After a well-attended town hall meeting on the subject, the Friends of Centro
chose nine campus-wide events which they believed the University would likely
support financially because of the events' institutional status, high attendance
and campus impact, said modern thought and literature coterminal student
Monica Henestroza, the MEChA financial officer for 2004.
These nine "flagship" events had received a combined $19,000 from the
MEChA special fee. They are: Dia de los Muertos, La Gran Posada, Zoot Suit
Week, Cinco de Mayo, Cesar Chavez Commemoration, Raza Day Conference,
Floricanto, C'oncierto de la Primavera and Nuestra Graduation.
Frances Morales, the director of El Centro Chicano, said that MEChA —
and the funds that it has had up through this year — have been crucial parts of
the Stanford Latino community and of the center.
