# Gmail:
## It's no joke to google your e-mail 
### SU FEN LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Just hours before April Fool's
Day, Google announced the
launch of its free, search-based
webmail service with one gigabyte
of storage. This is equivalent to
500,000 pages of e-mail. Some
people thought it was a hoax.
After all, Google had pulled April
Fool's jokes before. These include
using pigeons for ranking Web
pages, and advertising for engi
neers for their proposed lunar
hosting and research center.
Called Gmail, the mail service
is, however, hardly a joke. Even
though it is still in its beta testing
stage, it is in such great demand
that hundreds of Gmail accounts
are being auctioned on eßay. Bid
ders, from all over the world, have
offered prices as high as $150 for
an account.
This is because not everyone
can register for an account.
Early invitations were only ex
tended to digerati, journalists
and friends of Google employ
ees. Subsequently, new account
holders get to invite a limited
number of their friends to the
service. The only way to get an
account is by invitation.
In fact, a Web site, Gmail
Swap, has been set up solely to
hook up those who have Gmail in
vitations with others who are will
ing to exchange goods and ser
vices for Gmail accounts. Users
post swaps for Gmail accounts.
These offers come with links so
that people with Gmail invitations
can work out the details. The re
markable variety of offers range
from "eternal gratitude and thanks"
and "free love advice" to "a ride in a
Porsche" and"three decadent days
in Geneva, Switzerland".
The idea for Gmail came from
a Google user who complained
about always having to file or find
her messages on existing e-mail
services, or to delete e-mails to
keep under the storage limit. A
Google engineer started a project
to work on this idea, and after an
unexpectedly complicated devel
opment process, Gmail was born.
Given that Google was found
ed as an online search engine, it
comes as no surprise that one of
Gmail's most distinct features is
its Google search engine support.
This eliminates the need to file
messages into folders. Users can
find messages using keywords or
advanced search features. Fur
thermore, the one gigabyte of free
storage is enough for users not to
ever delete a message. This means
users can search every e-mail they

have ever sent or received.
Other features of Gmail in
clude its labeling system and the
way it displays e-mails as "con
versations" by also showing all
the replies to that e-mail.
As part of its spam filter sys
tem, Gmail has a "Report Spam"
link for users to remove spam
from their inboxes. This data
then gets sent to the Gmail team
to further improve their spam fil
ter. One Gmail user, Aaron
Pratt, has even created a Web
site that invites spammers to
flood his Gmail account. He
aims to find out how long it
takes to use up one gigabyte of
space, and how efficiently the
spam filter works.
Gmail prides itself for not hav
ing pop-ups or untargeted banner
ads. Like Google search result
pages, however, it places relevant
text ads and links to relevant Web
pages adjacent to e-mail mes
sages. Computers match ads to
content via a completely auto
mated process. This is the same
technology that powers Google's
AdSense program, which places
ads on targeted sites by analyzing
the content of pages and deter
mining which ads are most rele
vant to them. It is also Google's
source of funding for the service.
Gmail reassures its users that
"no humans read your e-mails to
target the ads, and no e-mail con
tent or other personally identifi
able information is ever provided
to advertisers." The user's name
is not sent to the ad server. When
the system scans the e-mail, it
does not look at the to or from
fields, only the subject and body
of the mail.
Most supporters see this auto
mated text scanning as similar to
those used to detect viruses and
spam, which are also used by
other hosted mail services.
There are, however, some who
are concerned about the threat
to user privacy.
A coalition of 28 privacy and
civil liberties groups has also writ
ten a letter to Google founders
Sergey Brin and Larry Page. They
urged Google to hold back on re
leasing the service.
The letter's signatories include
the World Privacy Forum, the Pri
vacy Rights Clearinghouse, Bits of
Freedom, the Consumer Federa
tion of America, the Electronic Pri
vacy Information Center, the Foun
dation for Information Policy Re
search and Privacy International.
Senator Liz Figueroa, a Demo
crat from Fremont, Calif., drafted
legislation to prevent Google or
any other company from examin

ing e-mail content to serve up ads.
California's State Senate ap
proved the bill by a vote of 24-8.
The bill has now gone to Califor
nia's Assembly for debate and
amendments. The final decision
on whether it becomes law lies in
the hands of California Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
If approved, the law will re
quire Google to scan messages in
real time and ban it from produc
ing records of e-mail content. It
will also ban Google from collect
ing personal information of Gmail
users and selling it to other firms.
Google is working with politi
cians to create a version of the bill
that would enhance Gmail's pri
vacy protection. It is also working
with data-protection authorities
across Europe, as Gmail may be
in conflict with a European Union
directive on privacy that users'

consent must be informed, specif
ic and unambiguous.
Google may also need to deal
with naming rights disputes. The
Market Age PLC (TMA) has al
ready registered its interest in the
name with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. TMA, a
British financial service
provider, launched a Web
based e-mail service called
Gmail in mid-2002 as part of an
online share price and currency
exchange rate analysis service.
Responses to Gmail's launch
have not only revolved around the
law. On May 14, Yahoo respond
ed to the Gmail offer by announc
ing plans to raise its e-mail storage
limit from 6MB to 100 MB. It is
also giving its premium sub
scribers, who currently have
100 MB of storage, "virtually un
limited" capacity.

with data-protection authorities
across Europe, as Gmail may be
in conflict with a European Union
directive on privacy that users'

consent must be informed, specif
ic and unambiguous.
Google may also need to deal
with naming rights disputes. The
Market Age PLC (TMA) has al
ready registered its interest in the
name with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. TMA, a
British financial service
provider, launched a Web
based e-mail service called
Gmail in mid-2002 as part of an
online share price and currency
exchange rate analysis service.
Responses to Gmail's launch
have not only revolved around the
law. On May 14, Yahoo respond
ed to the Gmail offer by announc
ing plans to raise its e-mail storage
limit from 6MB to 100 MB. It is
also giving its premium sub
scribers, who currently have
100 MB of storage, "virtually un
limited" capacity.

Just hours before April Fool's
Day, Google announced the
launch of its free, search-based
webmail service with one gigabyte
of storage. This is equivalent to
500,000 pages of e-mail. Some
people thought it was a hoax.
After all, Google had pulled April
Fool's jokes before. These include
using pigeons for ranking Web
pages, and advertising for engi
neers for their proposed lunar
hosting and research center.
Called Gmail, the mail service
is, however, hardly a joke. Even
though it is still in its beta testing
stage, it is in such great demand
that hundreds of Gmail accounts
are being auctioned on eßay. Bid
ders, from all over the world, have
offered prices as high as $150 for
an account.
This is because not everyone
can register for an account.
Early invitations were only ex
tended to digerati, journalists
and friends of Google employ
ees. Subsequently, new account
holders get to invite a limited
number of their friends to the
service. The only way to get an
account is by invitation.
In fact, a Web site, Gmail
Swap, has been set up solely to
hook up those who have Gmail in
vitations with others who are will
ing to exchange goods and ser
vices for Gmail accounts. Users
post swaps for Gmail accounts.
These offers come with links so
that people with Gmail invitations
can work out the details. The re
markable variety of offers range
from "eternal gratitude and thanks"
and "free love advice" to "a ride in a
Porsche" and"three decadent days
in Geneva, Switzerland".
The idea for Gmail came from
a Google user who complained
about always having to file or find
her messages on existing e-mail
services, or to delete e-mails to
keep under the storage limit. A
Google engineer started a project
to work on this idea, and after an
unexpectedly complicated devel
opment process, Gmail was born.
Given that Google was found
ed as an online search engine, it
comes as no surprise that one of
Gmail's most distinct features is
its Google search engine support.
This eliminates the need to file
messages into folders. Users can
find messages using keywords or
advanced search features. Fur
thermore, the one gigabyte of free
storage is enough for users not to
ever delete a message. This means
users can search every e-mail they

have ever sent or received.
Other features of Gmail in
clude its labeling system and the
way it displays e-mails as "con
versations" by also showing all
the replies to that e-mail.
As part of its spam filter sys
tem, Gmail has a "Report Spam"
link for users to remove spam
from their inboxes. This data
then gets sent to the Gmail team
to further improve their spam fil
ter. One Gmail user, Aaron
Pratt, has even created a Web
site that invites spammers to
flood his Gmail account. He
aims to find out how long it
takes to use up one gigabyte of
space, and how efficiently the
spam filter works.
Gmail prides itself for not hav
ing pop-ups or untargeted banner
ads. Like Google search result
pages, however, it places relevant
text ads and links to relevant Web
pages adjacent to e-mail mes
sages. Computers match ads to
content via a completely auto
mated process. This is the same
technology that powers Google's
AdSense program, which places
ads on targeted sites by analyzing
the content of pages and deter
mining which ads are most rele
vant to them. It is also Google's
source of funding for the service.
Gmail reassures its users that
"no humans read your e-mails to
target the ads, and no e-mail con
tent or other personally identifi
able information is ever provided
to advertisers." The user's name
is not sent to the ad server. When
the system scans the e-mail, it
does not look at the to or from
fields, only the subject and body
of the mail.
Most supporters see this auto
mated text scanning as similar to
those used to detect viruses and
spam, which are also used by
other hosted mail services.
There are, however, some who
are concerned about the threat
to user privacy.
A coalition of 28 privacy and
civil liberties groups has also writ
ten a letter to Google founders
Sergey Brin and Larry Page. They
urged Google to hold back on re
leasing the service.
The letter's signatories include
the World Privacy Forum, the Pri
vacy Rights Clearinghouse, Bits of
Freedom, the Consumer Federa
tion of America, the Electronic Pri
vacy Information Center, the Foun
dation for Information Policy Re
search and Privacy International.
Senator Liz Figueroa, a Demo
crat from Fremont, Calif., drafted
legislation to prevent Google or
any other company from examin

ing e-mail content to serve up ads.
California's State Senate ap
proved the bill by a vote of 24-8.
The bill has now gone to Califor
nia's Assembly for debate and
amendments. The final decision
on whether it becomes law lies in
the hands of California Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
If approved, the law will re
quire Google to scan messages in
real time and ban it from produc
ing records of e-mail content. It
will also ban Google from collect
ing personal information of Gmail
users and selling it to other firms.
Google is working with politi
cians to create a version of the bill
that would enhance Gmail's pri
vacy protection. It is also working
with data-protection authorities
across Europe, as Gmail may be
in conflict with a European Union
directive on privacy that users'
