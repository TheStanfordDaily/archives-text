# BASES: building the next generation of entrepreneurs
## 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
Last week the Business Association of
Stanford Engineering Students, or
BASES, held their annual end-of-year
banquet celebrating the completion of an
other productive year. BASES hosts the
Entrepreneur's Challenge, Social En
trepreneur's Challenge, Innovator's Chal
lenge, Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders
Seminar Program and Interact, among
other events.
"The focus of BASES today is the same
as when it was founded, which is to support
the next generation of entrepreneurs," said
Professor Tom Kosnik of Material Science
and Engineering.
Kosnik, along with venture capitalist
George Zachary, Dean John Bravman and
Professor Tom Byers formed the original
BASES advisory board. The number of peo
ple helping guide BASES has grown as stu
dents have participated in the program and
gradated.
"The way that my role with BASES has
changed over the years is that I now have a
large contingent of BASES alumni who

have been officers or run one of the major
events that BASES has created over the
years since it was founded in 1996," Kosnik
said. "Virtually all of those officers and ex
ecutives want to stay connected with
BASES as alumni."
Zachary said that the group diversity has
grown in the past year.
"I have been the outside BASES advisor
now for [over] seven years," Zachary said.
"Every year the organization grows in so
phistication and reach and depth. It is great
to see and contribute to. Over the past year,
a more diverse officer team grew the organi
zations scope. For example, we now have
three professionally run entrepreneurial
competitions in business, technology and so
cial organization creation."
The Stanford Entrepreneur's Challenge
is an annual business plan competition con
ducted by BASES whose participants learn
about venture formation and are guided
through the process of developing an idea
into a business. Throughout the year
BASES holds workshops, team building ac
tivities and a mentorship program.
In Winter quarter participants submit
executive summaries and detailed busi

ness plans, which are evaluated by judges
including successful entrepreneurs and
venture capitalists. Finalists present their
business ideas to a panel of venture capi
talists in the spring. The winner receives
$25,000 grand prize, endowed by the Mor
genthaler Family, and another $25,000 is
split among the remaining finalists so that
they can pursue their entrepreneurial

plans (second place: $20,000 and third
place: $5,000).
At least half of each team must be affili
ated with Stanford as a student, research
and postdoctoral staff, or faculty.
In its third year, the Social En
trepreneur's Challenge judges ideas and
business plans for social ventures that are ei
ther for-profit or non-profit.
"BASES has gotten a lot broader in help
ing the social entrepreneur," Kosnik said. "I
was so thrilled to see the progress that the
Social E-Challenge has made in terms of
tapping the energy and the enthusiasm of
Stanford students and members of the Stan
ford community that aren't necessarily sci
entists or engineers."
BASES offers students a chance to meet
notable Silicon Valley figures.
"Our team puts on programs and events
that get people to interact with groups they
might not otherwise," said Talin Gordnia,
VP of Interact. "So, whether it's bringing in
lawyers from one of our sponsor firms or
bringing in venture capitalists, it's giving
people an opportunity that they don't nor
mally had."
Don Williams, a partner at Wilson Sonsi

ni Goodrich & Rosati, one such sponsor, be
lieves that a strong relationship with Stan
ford is crucial for his firm.
"For years, we have had strong ties to
Stanford," he said. "We are a Palo Alto
home grown product. Of our partners, the
largest single alumni group is from Stanford,
both law school and under graduate. The
BASES relationship is an opportunity for us
to make the ties with the Stanford commu
nity. Even through our building is literally
on Stanford land, we've got to take the ini
tiative and meet the students. This is an or
ganization we feel is building the next gen
eration of entrepreneurs, and this is what we
want to do too. We want to work together to
do that."
BASES conducts the Entrepreneurial
Thought Leaders Seminar in partnership
with the Management Science and Engi
neering department and the Stanford Tech
nology Ventures Program. These weekly
events bring prominent business leaders to
campus. The seminar series is also offered as
a one-unit class, MS&E 472.
"BASES is the most entrepreneurial
group in the bay area and I believe in the
world." Zachary said.
