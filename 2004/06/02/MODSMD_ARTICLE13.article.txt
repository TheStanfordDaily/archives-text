## A 						final farewell 
### MIKE MONTGOMERY FORMER DIRECTOR OF MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Where do I start? As you probably know
by now, I have accepted a new job as head
coach of the Golden State Warriors. After
26 years as a head coach at the collegiate
level, including 18 years at Stanford, I
thought... If not now, when?
This new job will be a tremendous chal
lenge but one that I feel I am prepared for
and that I will take on with all the energy
that I can muster.

My only regret is that
I had to leave the best
job in the country to
take on this challenge. I
hope that you all real
ize what a great oppor
tunity you have to be
associated with this
great university.
Whether it be as a fac
ulty / staff member or as
a student, it doesn't get
any better than this. I am

so grateful to have had the opportunity to
work at Stanford for the past 18 years.
The people that have played a part in
our success are too numerous to mention,
but I can promise you that none of it would
have been possible without the help of some
real special folks. Coming to work every day
was truly a pleasure; seeing the kids, feeling
the energy, enjoying the special relation
ships that can only exist at a special place
like Stanford.
What I want to express more than any
thing is what a fantastic place that Stanford
is and how much I appreciate everything
that has been done for me by so many peo
ple over the years. First and foremost, the
players that have played and earned their
degrees here are beyond compare. With so
many different personalities and levels of
talent, having guys willing to do whatever it
takes to win is amazing.
The administration has believed in our
program, supporting us and allowing our
team a chance to win. Supporting 34 sports
is no easy task. It takes great commitment,
time, energy and resources to do what we do
at Stanford. Nobody does it better.
Last, but certainly not least, are the stu
dents. Whenever I got a little down, I
would leave the office to take a quick stroll
across campus and absorb the energy from
the great people around campus. Getting
back to the office, I was energized and
ready to go, realizing I was at the best place
in the country.
And can anyone match the intensity and
excitement of the Sixth Man Club? No way.
Even though other institutions are trying to
copy us now, no student-body can equal
Stanford. I absolutely love it.
The only way I could give this up was to
retire from, not quit, college basketball. So I
did. Stanford is my home and my family will
continue to follow, support and enjoy ev
erything about the Stanford community.
You have allowed me to excel beyond
my wildest dreams and I owe you all so
much. Thank you for 18 wonderful years.
