# Eat, drink and be merry

Parting is such sweet sorrow

In the wise words of the Mickey Mouse Club, now
it's time to say goodbye to all our "farm"ily ...
(yeah, I know that one was kind of cheesy, but run
with it). This, sadly, is my last column of the year.

It seems liKe only yesieraay 1 was
searching for the right word to de
scribe the spring rolls at Three Sea
sons, or watching children with dirty
clothes play at Zot's, while their par
ents drank forties on the picnic bench
es. Oh, the memories.
With only three days until my first
final, I wonder why I got in here. You
only have so much time left to hang
out with each other before the summer

transforms your best friend / next door neighbor into a
voice on the other end of a cell phone. For everyone
going abroad in the fall, you won't have another
Hobee's brunch until January. If you are going to Paris,
you can reminisce about Oakville Grocery's sandwiches
while you snack on a baguette by the Sorbonne.
So for these next few days, what last minute dinners
should you schedule? What cool new cafe should you

taste before leaving it for an entire summer? Here are
my words of advice: If you haven't been to Three Sea
sons yet, you really need to go. Like, before this year is
over, because it's just incredible. That's probably the
only restaurant I would tell you to take a chance on —
otherwise it's not worth spending your last couple of
days and dollars on someplace you're not sure if you're
going to like. So if you eat at Pluto's for the next four
nights, I really can't blame you — and chances are I'll be
there too.
Another route that you can take is to be super ad
venturous — and by that I mean travel outside the 15-
mile radius that we are so accustomed to. I went to Santa
Cruz the other day and realized how refreshing a change
of scenery can be. The salty air, the crisp breeze, the
charming little houses that lined the side streets — ev
erything just seemed so fresh and new and revitalizing.
Suddenly all the little taco stands that would normally
look "unappetizing" to me (I'm a Baja Fresh or Chipo
tle girl) now looked "authentic." The outdoor cafe at
tached to the bowling alley that would normally look
"sketch," now seemed "perfect" to bask in the sun and
grab some food. And although I wouldn't write home

about my grilled chicken sandwich with avocado, it def
initely wasn't bad, and it was only $3.95 (which is nor
mally what avocado would cost on it's own). I might
have been more harsh on the sandwich had I been eat
ing it somewhere on University Ave. — but sitting near
the boardwalk, in our bathing suits and linen skirts, it
felt like exactly the meal I wanted.
So you might want to take a break from finals this
next weekend, if you have time, and drive to Santa
Cruz, drive to the city, drive to Sonoma, go camping in
Big Sur — do something different that will make mem
ories for forever. I know I'll always remember crossing
the railroad tracks (with person-sized gaps in between
each slab of wood) that were built over a really deep
ravine. Good times, accompanied by a mad adrenaline
rush and fear for my life. But good times, nonetheless.
So play it safe, or go crazy — either way works just
as long as you're loving it. Sometimes it's not about
the food, but those who you are eating with that
make the difference. This week, remind yourselves
about how great your friends are, and make meal
times a moment when everyone can gather together
and have fun fora bit.

Don't rush to the dining hall, grab some soggy Chi
nese food and bring to it your computer so you can con
tinue working. Take a break fora half-hour or so —
you're not going to get much done in that 30 minutes
anyway. Take a break with your friends (or a Kit-Kat, if
you really listen to their commercials), breathe fora sec
ond. De-stress with a Baja burrito, or a "farmer green
'sawhalad' with chicken, please."
In a week finals will be done, and we'll have to figure
out what to do now that Shurgard has gone out of busi
ness. In any event, it's been a great year, and it's been a
pleasure writing for you. For now, "a bientot." If you're
in the Paris area fall quarter, let me know. Maybe we can
grab lunch.

If you too have walked across live railroad tracks
suspended over a steep ravine, let Jennie know at
jbroder@stanford.edu. Especially if a train came
about 15 minutes after you stepped of the tracks. It's
fun to reminisce about life-threatening activities. On
a side note, come visit her in Paris! You know you
want to.
