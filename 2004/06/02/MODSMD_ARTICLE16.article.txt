## Hypocrisy in the ASSU 
### 
It is worrisome enough that the ASSU failed to catch
or reprimand the Husbands/Schwartz executive
slate for improperly accepting money from at least
one student special-fees group. But far more disturb
ing is the fact that some of the organization's leaders knew
about or even participated in the Husbands/Schwartz
slate's improprieties — and yet staked out a moral high
ground in censuring and punishing opposing candidates
Mikey Lee and Dylan Mefford for less egregious violations.
In his capacity as financial officer of the Black Student
Union (BSU), Daniel Stringer approved a reimburse
ment to help finance the campaign of his fellow BSU
member, Ajani Husbands. Then, in his capacity as ASSU
senator and Appropriations Committee chair, he voted
not to certify the Lee / Mefford slate's victory over Hus
bands / Schwartz on the grounds that Lee had "abused
his power" as a Senior Class president by asking his fellow
class presidents to write an e-mail supporting his cam
paign. For Stringer to argue before the ASSU Constitu
tional Council that Lee's actions justified denying him the
ASSU presidency was utter hypocrisy.
Stringer used special-fees money — money that students
had voted to give the BSU in the expectation that it would be
used for "organizational and basic programming expenses,"

as explicitly stipulated in the ASSU By-Laws — to support
Husbands' campaign for the ASSU presidency'. And the
BSU made no mention of funding any ASSU elections cam
paign efforts in its special-fees budget itemization for 2003-
2004. Stringer recently told The Daily he didn't think there
was anything wrong with that. For the ASSU leader in
charge of monetary appropriations, that is inexcusable. We
believe he should step down from that post immediately.
Stringer is not the only member of the ASSU whose
actions warrant serious concern. Husbands and
Schwartz both said they understood it to be a common
practice for candidates endorsed by the Students of
Color Coalition to accept campaign money from student
groups affiliated with SOCC. If that is true, then many
other leaders in the ASSU must have known about the
practice and kept silent about it — all while persecuting
Lee and Mefford for an endorsement e-mail that may or
may not have been against the rules.
The members of the ASSU who engaged in this
hypocrisy broke faith with the students who elected them.
We call on them to come forward, acknowledge their mis
takes and apologize to the student body — and then step
aside so that those who truly care about the ASSU's in
tegrity can go about rebuilding the trust they've lost.
