# Stanford needs AEDs to save lives
## 
### MARK LIAO 
As a CPR instructor with the
American Heart Association and
American Red Cross, I am surprised
that the Stanford University campus
lacks preparedness with a pertinent
medical issue today: the response to
sudden cardiac arrest.
Sudden cardiac arrest occurs when
the heart stops pumping effectively
and goes into a lethal heart rhythm that
requires immediate medical treatment
using a device called a defibrillator.
These devices shock a person's heart in
the hopes that a normal heart rhythm
will resume. Without a defibrillator, a
person's chances of survival decrease
by about 10 percent each minute he is
in cardiac arrest — even with well-per
formed cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR). As you can imagine, a person
cannot wait long for treatment.
Many members of the community at
Stanford are already trained in CPR,
but CPR is only a stopgap measure until
a defibrillator arrives. At most locations
on the Stanford campus, this defibrilla
tor would have to come from an ambu
lance or fire truck from the Palo Alto
Fire Department, which can take sever
al minutes to arrive once the 911 call is
received. Fora person in cardiac arrest,
this time delay for definitive treatment

could prove detrimental for their
chances of successful resuscitation.
While the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment's crews try hard to respond to
each emergency in a timely manner,
unforeseen circumstances such as find
ing buildings and maneuvering around
bollards make it difficult for them to
reach patients quickly to deliver the
potentially life-saving shock.
But we no longer have to wait for
professionals such as firefighters,
emergency medical technicians or
paramedics to deliver this shock —
simpler-to-use devices known as auto
mated external defibrillators (AEDs)
are widely available on the market,
and, according to medical studies, can
be used even by 6th-graders.
I like to joke with my students that
AEDs are easier to use than elevators,
and this is actually very close to the
truth. These devices walk the rescuer
through the rescue process, giving
voice and text prompts such as "attach
electrodes" or "push flashing button to
deliver shock."
A microprocessor decides if a shock
is indicated; you cannot inappropriate
ly deliver a shock, which makes the de
vices very safe for even the untrained
bystander to use.
I am thus surprised that Stanford
does not have a public access defibril

lation program such as is found at uni
versities across the nation, including
Santa Clara University, University of
Texas-Austin and Cornell University.
Public access programs involve provid
ing AEDs in high-traffic public loca
tions such as Tresidder, Arrillaga
Alumni Center and fitness facilities.
Public access defibrillation programs
in some locations such as airports and
casinos have significantly higher car
diac arrest survival rates than the na
tional average.
The cost of these devices should no
longer be a concern to University de
partments. Prices of AEDs have fallen
rapidly over the years, dropping from
as much as $S,(XX) to $ 1,3(X), the cost of
about one high-end desktop PC. This is
surely a small price to pay to save lives,
and it might prevent lawsuits as well.
With an incredibly diverse popula
tion at Stanford, from the young ath
lete to the mature alumnus, the risk of
sudden cardiac arrest is relatively high.
I firmly believe that Stanford has a
commitment to provide AEDs in pub
lic locations, thereby safeguarding the
health of everyone who calls this place
a workplace, school or home.
