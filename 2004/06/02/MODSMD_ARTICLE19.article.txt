# Editor’s Note
## And to all, a good night... 
### 
Another Stanford Daily editor's term has come
and passed. This time, though, it is my term
that has come to an end — at least until I
begin the summer volume.
With the close of my third year at The Daily, I feel it
would be impossible for me to overestimate how much 1
have learned from my experiences — and, more impor
tantly, from the people here at the paper. Having a vision
is one thing, but having a talented, dedicated body of indi
viduals to carry out that vision is an entirely different mat
ter. And for that, I truly appreciate all the hard work my
fellow Daily staffers have put in over the course of the last
four-and-a-half months to make everything happen.
We have covered a lot of ground since Volume 225
began. The special-fees system was finally reformed after
refund rates reached an all-time high during winter quar
ter. There was a rather interesting ASSU executive elec
tion, and another equally interesting special election after
the first was thrown out — initially due to charges of ille
gal campaigning and then based on charges of abuse of
power by one of the slates. Stanford men's basketball fell
unexpectedly short of an NCAA title, and then the Car
dinal lost both Josh Childress and Mike Montgomery to
the NBA. In the interest of keeping this short, it is safe to

say that much has happened, and I hope that you all have
enjoyed learning about campus issues while perusing the
pages of our publication.
The Daily is supposed to be a resource for the Univer
sity. Our goal is to educate readers about campus affairs in
a fair and balanced fashion. While there are always things
to improve upon — since flawless reporting is what every
good editor should strive for — I believe that my staff has
done a solid job of relaying all that has taken place at Stan
ford to you, the readers, since the onset of February. I hope
that you feel the same.
1 entitled my introductory column that ran at the be
ginning of this volume "Welcome to The Daily's future."
Although I did not realize it at the time, that title could
just as appropriately be utilized for this farewell column
as it was for that first greeting offered to the Stanford
community. But that would just be repetitive.
