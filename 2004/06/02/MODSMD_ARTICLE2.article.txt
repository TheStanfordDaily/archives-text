# Housing mistakes displace undergrads
## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
Due to the complaints of several Draw groups who claimed they were
unfairly kept out of Suites in this year's housing Draw, Housing Assign
ment Services (HAS) has decided to change the Suites priority system
for coming years. Jn the future, any group of four or six students will au
tomatically receive priority in Suites.
Six Draw groups recently approached HAS claiming that they should
have been placed in Suites according to their Draw number and priority
level, although HAS Director Todd Benson said that in three of these
cases, the students were at fault.
Students affected by the housing errors expressed disappointment and
frustration, many going to great lengths to remedy the problem.
One group of juniors went to the HAS office at 8:30 a.m. two days in
a row to get themselves reassigned.
"Luckily it all worked out because they found the original form and
admitted it wasn't our fault, but
the priority rep's fault," said junior
Jennie Kim, a Daily staff member.
"We seriously argued our way in."
According to Kim, HAS initial
ly claimed that one of her Draw
mates had not received priority,
and her entire group was down
graded to Mirrielees.
"This makes no sense because
there's one Suites priority sheet
which has all six group members on
it, so there's no way we could have
missed one name off it," Kim said.
Freshman Ryan Kissick and his
draw group pointed out a similar
error to HAS.
"When we heard that the six of
us had been assigned to Castano,
our third choice, we were very dis
traught," Kissick said. "How could

the five of my Draw-mates receive
priority while I had not? After per
sistent e-mailing and research into
the situation, it was discovered that
I had indeed received priority; it
had simply not been entered into
the computer system."
One group of juniors blamed
technical difficulties with the
HAS Web site for their faulty
assignment.
"My Draw-mate's application
was messed up when she entered
the Draw," said junior Heidi
Baumgartner. "It didn't ask her
about group retention so she e
mailed Housing to fix it and
thought that they had, but appar
ently it never got changed."
She continued, "The housing of
fice contacted groups in Suites to try
and find a group that would be will
ing to switch into Lambda Nu. And
it worked."
HAS Director Todd Benson em
phasized that students were at fault
in three of the six cases.
"We found three groups where
an error that was no fault of the

group's caused them not to be as
signed to Suites," Benson said. "The
three other groups actually thought
they should have been assigned to
Suites, but were incorrect."
Due to confidentiality concerns,
Benson said he could not elaborate
on the nature of the errors on the
students' housing applications.
"Without saying too much
specifically about their individual
applications, in general, groups
may not be assigned together if
they have different residence choic
es or list a different group reten
tion, etc.," Benson said.
Benson confirmed that in two
cases, the student priority represen
tative had failed to enter priority for
one member of the group, causing
both groups to be split and to lose
their housing in Suites.
He also remarked on another in
stance in this year's Draw whereby a
miscommunication regarding a list
of Greek members caused a group
to be split because one member was
assigned to Greek housing.
While Benson acknowledged

that three cases were beyond stu
dent control, he said that HAS was
not responsible for the assignments
of the other three groups that were
left out of Suites. Of those three,
however, he said that HAS was
able to accommodate one, since all
parties involved seemed to be
pleased with the switch.
"The group in Suites preferred to
live somewhere else," Benson said.
Throughout the ordeal, Benson
said that the priorities of HAS
were with students who had been
subject to mistakes that were be
yond their control.
"In the end, I think they were
happy," he said.
Freshman Milton Solorzano, a
member of Kissick's draw group,
expressed the sentiments of
many who had been initially kept
out of Suites.
"While I am ultimately satisfied
by the result of this debacle, I am
still disappointed that at least two
Draw groups — possibly more —
were unfortunately entangled in this
unnecessary mess."
