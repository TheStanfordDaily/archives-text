# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## The 						summer of bad poetry 
### 
This is the time of year when
The Daily is filled with ram
blings from nostalgic se
niors, all of which seem to in
clude the words: "man, does time fly"
and "Why, it seemed like it was just
the other day ..." or "Those e mails
were protected under free speech â€”
why am I still not president?" (Mikey
Lee only).
But personally, I don't do well with
self-reflective stuff. Shakespeare says it
best: "It is a tale told by an idiot, full of
sound and fury, signifying nothing"
(5.5.28-31). Many scholars on Macbeth
assume that he was talking about life,
but 1 think the Bard was clearly talking
about senior farewell columns.
I'm not a senior, so I won't be writ
ing a trip down memory lane. Let's
look to the near future: summer break.
Most of you will be heading to high
paid internships/community service
projects / high paid communities.
I, however, will be working at dork
camp. It's not one of those dangerous,
life-threatening "outdoor" camps.
There will be no rabid mosquitoes,
homicidal games of manhunt or death
defying runs through the sprinklers.
This summer I'm working with chil
dren whose parents hate them. I mean,
want them to succeed. My mistake. I'll
be working at a creative writing camp.
Perhaps as a kid I was biased, and a
bit of an ass. I looked down on kids

who attended academic camps, took
summer classes and "enriched their
minds." Me, I was on a 24 / 7 fun-dip
induced sugar high, dividing my time
between baseball cards and sports
camps. I'd be so tired from the day's ac-

tivities, my parents
wouldn't even
have to slip any
thing into my food
to get me to sleep.
Now, of course,
I'm surrounded by
people who went to
academic camps. I
don't feel left out,
mind you, because

my baseball card collection is much bet
ter than theirs. And I guess I'll reluctant
ly admit I would have liked to attend a
creative writing camp over the summer.
But then I remember what writing
was like in high school. I remember sit
ting through poetry readings so terri
ble that they violated the Geneva Con
vention. People thought I wasn't sensi
tive and that I just didn't know how to
truly express myself. I think because I
didn't try to rhyme "broken hearted"
with "eternal rainy day," I was differ
ent. The fact is, when I wrote about
bearded pirates fighting giant robots, I
was writing what I'm really about.
I'm guessing these kids probably
won't be writing about giant robots. I en
vision a giddy thrall of little Sylvia Plaths

and Earnest Hemingways. I think to my
self: "I'll bet they'll really enjoy playing
'big booty' and singing "Kumbaya.'"
Cancel that.
If these kids are going to be little de
pressive geniuses, fine. I'll have to find
new ways to reach them. I'm buying a
beret, for starters. And I'm learning to
smoke and speak in a really terrible
French accent. I'll discover how to
write poetry that uses phrases like
"dark clouds" "my heart is a puddle"
and "life, 'tis a bitch."
If I work at it, I can learn to be jaded
and angst-ridden. I'll swear off colored
clothing. I'll put Joy Division on repeat.
I'll be able to relate to the kids, I
hope. Or if not, my gross caricature of
a writer will hopefully keep them off
that dark path.
Either way, I'm looking forward to
the entire experience. Hopefully they'll
have some fun this summer, and maybe
they can teach me how to act bitter and
crotchety. If all goes according to plan,
by the time I'm a senior I will know how
to pour my soul onto the page so that I
can write that elusive memory-soaked
farewell column. Now I need to find out
how to rhyme "my heart is a puddle"
with "graduation."
