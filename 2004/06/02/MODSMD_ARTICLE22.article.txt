## Protesters exploit Iraqis’ suffering for domestic political aims 
### BRYANT HELVEY 
Lately, we have seen many protests
on campus stemming from the mis
treatment of prisoners by American
soldiers in Iraq. I find the American sol
diers' poor judgment very disappoint
ing, but something has always bothered
me about the demonstrations.
It was not until reading on the front
cover of The Daily ("Rodin sculptures
used in protest of treatment of Iraqi
prisoners," May 26) about protests in
volving hooded statues and the mes
sage "Rumsfeld was here" that I real
ized what the problem is. These
protesters don't actually care for the
disrespected Iraqi prisoners at all; on

the contrary, they are taking advantage
of the prisoners' misfortune to further
their own political agendas.
In this election year, many arc espe
cially fervent to see that our current pres
ident is not re-elected. George W. Bush
has been the cause of more distrust and
dislike toward an American leader than
I have seen in my lifetime, and these sen
timents are prevalent at Stanford.
I have asked some friends what
good the protests might do, and they
have cited aims such as "raising aware
ness." However, everyone who cares
enough about our country to cast a vote
also already knows about the mistreat
ment in Iraq. We have been surround
ed by it in the media for weeks, and vot

ers have already decided whether this
should be attributed to our leadership
and if it changes their vote.
The protesters aren't trying to raise
awareness; they are trying to sow anger
and divisiveness. They are trying to
drive a deeper wedge between our po
litical parties and breed personal ha
tred toward our current leaders. Ac
tions like these will not benefit anyone
in this country and certainly won't help
the prisoners in Iraq.
It is difficult for me to watch so much
energy being devoted to such an ugly
cause. If these people were truly both
ered by the suffering prisoners, they
could take action to ease suffering near
home — for example, by devoting their

energy toward helping the homeless or
people who are abused every day.
These societal problems, though they
occur constantly, aren't much protested
on campus because they don't carry po
litical weight. The demonstrators could
fight suffering in another country
through the Peace Corps, or they could
even go to Iraq and try to help the many
needy people there.
Yet it is laughable to me to think
that any of the people who have been
going around campus dressing up stat
ues have the type of courage it takes
for our soldiers to leave their comfort
able lives here and put themselves in
such dangerous positions.
Even if the protesters are more con

cerned about politics than people,
there are ways to positively effect
change besides demonizing the coun
try's leaders. Education of voters is still
a huge need in our society.
If the money spent on picketing
and creating other graphic forms of
protest were instead spent educating
voters about our leaders' shortcom
ings in domestic or fiscal policy, not
only would votes be changed but also
we would be making progress toward
a more involved, more educated
democracy. Unfortunately, some peo
ple apparently believe they can
achieve their aims better by sneaking
around in the dark than by holding
reasoned conversations.

These protests were not honor
able — they were hypocritical. Is
breeding hatred in this country by
flaunting hatred somewhere else
going to benefit anyone?
The Daily is as guilty as we all are.
By placing the event on the front page
for everyone to see, they gave the
protesters just what they hoped for.
They want more attention and more
domestic hatred, and they don't really
want to stop the suffering in Iraq — at
least until after the election.
