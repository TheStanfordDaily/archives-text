## A 						slacker's guide to summer break 
### 
/ / "W" "W" T" hat are you doing
• j for the summer?"
By this time of
▼ V year, you've prob
ably been asked that question more
times than you care to remember. Even
more so, I m sure you've heard about
10,000 answers that make your well-laid
plans seem as meaningful as the latest
Mary-Kate and Ashley movie.
For some reason, when someone tells
you that his plan for the summer is find
ing a cure for cancer, your mission to
watch every episode of "Law and Order"
twice seems a little less impressive.
The solution to this problem is, of
course, obvious — lie like a rug.
"My plans for the summer? Well,
after bringing peace to the Middle
East and funding the national deficit,
I'll probably take a few days off be
fore I head on up to Mars to bring
democracy to the intelligent life I re
cently discovered. Oh, but your plans
sound fun too. I've always been inter
ested in fungi."
If, for some silly reason, outrageous
lying rubs you the wrong way, take
heart. You still have a variety of options
open to you when faced by the typical
plethora of Stanford overachievers.
For instance, say someone tells you
they're spending the summer uncover
ing the secrets of the universe in a
high-energy physics lab. You can im
mediately gain the upper hand by re
minding them that next year you'll be
spending your summer money on coke
and hookers (or, you know, milk
shakes or something) while they're
going door-to-door begging for laun

dry money.
On the other hand, if some jackass
down the hall is bragging about all the
money and connections he's gonna be
racking up on Wall Street, politely tell
him you wouldn't feel right spending
your whole summer only thinking
about money when there are so many
more important things in life. I don't
think it counts as a sin of omission if
you don't mention that the "more im
portant things" you have planned con
sist primarily of daytime television
and Little Debbie products.
And if someone you know has an
obscenely well-paying job that also
greatly enhances the quality of life of
orphans in a third-world country? If
you can't beat 'em, punch 'em in the
face, is what I always say. It's not al
ways easy being the bigger person, but
it sure can be satisfying.
There is, however, an even bigger
question lurking in the background:
Why does everyone feel like they have
to go out and conquer the world as
soon as class lets out? Of course it
looks great on a resume if you spend
the summer settling labor disputes in
Tanzania or introducing the concept
of queues to a previously undiscov
ered aboriginal community. Don't for
get, though, to look at this situation
with a bit of perspective.
First of all, you've just spent a
whole year studying Lord-knows
what and participating in umpteen
million clubs, not to mention trying to
squeeze in some modicum of social
life. In the even bigger picture, you're
just a few years away from — gasp —

becoming a productive member of the
workforce, wearing a suit and tie ev
eryday, and getting three weeks off a
year. Is it really unreasonable to ex
pect that there should be a little time
for trashy television and bon-bons
squeezed somewhere in all of that? I
sure hope not.
And hey, if none of this appeals to
you, you could always try and ease
your embarrassment about your no
good, layabout summer schedule by
rationalizing it publicly in your local

newspaper. I have to say, though,
you'd have to be a pretty sorry speci
men to take that way out.
