# STILL MAC, STILL DANGEROUS
## School's over — it's time to get real 
### 
Like Jim Carrey's character in
"Dumb & Dumber," Lloyd
Christmas, I hate goodbyes.
That being said, I will be bidding
thee farewell with this column — but I'm
going to do it the only way I know how.
There's no denying that June 13 is a
monumental day.
First off, it's Mary-Kate and Ashley
Olsen's 18th birthday. Perverts across
the globe have been chomping at the bit
for the twins to shed their jailbait status
ever since they first appeared on "Full
House" what seemed like eons ago, and
the wait is almost over. The girls are just
days away from being legal, and the
newest phase of their countdown to
Hollywood decadence and eventual
overdose in a hotel bathroom has al
most begun.
June 13 is also graduation. On the day
that will henceforth be remembered for
the fact that sex with an Olsen twin no
longer constitutes statutory rape, I will
be graduating alongside 1600 of my clos
est friends. In the blink of an eye and the
delivery of a piece of paper, it's "Good
bye, Stanford" and "Hello, real world."
Memo to self: It's time to stop being
polite and start getting real. Mad real.
I have no doubt that the Olsen twins
will do fine on June 13. Honestly, how
many cigarettes can you smoke while
enlisting in the army and watching porn
all day? Myself and the rest of the soon
to-be graduates, on the other hand, I'm
not so sure about.
There is one thing that's for sure,
though: my four years here have flown
by faster than Joe Millionaire's career. I

know it sounds like a Hallmark card, but
it does seem just like yesterday that I
walked into Roble to start freshman
year. Now I'm a couple days away from

being a college grad
and a full-time
member of the
American work
force, a speck in a
web of job reports
that will be so beau
tifully manipulated
come election day.
As I mentioned
in an earlier column.

I've already sold my soul to the corporate
devil and I'll be starting to work for an in
vestment bank in July. I'm not really sure
what my job entails, but supposedly I
work 90-hour weeks concocting devious
schemes to make the rich richer and the
poor poorer. Beam me up, Scotty.
I have no doubt that next year, while
I'm hunched over at my cubicle and
poring over Excel spreadsheets, I will
often close my eyes and wish I were
back at Stanford.
Sure, I'll miss the things that led me
to apply here in the fall of 1999 — that's
right, I'm getting so old that I applied to
college last millennium. Where else am
I going to hear daily lectures by Nobel
Prize-winning professors, see sold-out
games at Maples Pavilion and stroll
around the most beautiful campus in
the country?
But what I'm really going to miss are
the things that make you want to stay in
college forever. The beer pong games in
my fraternity house that seem like bat

ties between gladiators fighting to the
death. Or seeing that random girl on her
"walk of shame" while I stumble to class
hung over in the morning.
That's assuming I don't just skip my
early-morning lecture, a luxury that will
be woefully absent for me in the coming
years. "Sorry sir. I didn't mean to sleep
through that 'due diligence' meeting,
but I got so hammered last night that I
still can't feel my legs, like the nerd from
'Can't Hardly Wait."'
Over the last four years, I may have
attended Stanford University — but I
definitely went to college. College, that
seven-letter word emblazoned across
John Belushi's chest in "Animal
House." What a beautiful place. And
now it's almost all gone as the real world
peeks its ugly head around the corner.
Am I ready for graduation? Truth
fully, sometimes I think I am and some
times I think I'm not. I'd like to think
that I've gotten as much out of this place
as possible, but, unfortunately, I know
that's probably not the case.
Academically, I did learn a ton while
I was here and, for the most part, really
enjoyed what I studied. Yes, you heard
me right — I have a studious side. Con
trary to what you may have thought
from most of my columns, I did take a
full load of classes and — here's a shock
er — I performed well in most of them.
While I'm at it, I might as well make
a grand confession, seeing as this is my
farewell column. I'm really a Republi
can Yankee fan who loves boy bands.
I've never been to a frat party or had a
sip of alcohol in my life. I'm not in SAE.

I'm actually an in-the-closet Yell Lead
er that only made fun of them because I
was uncomfortable with my over
whelming school spirit.
Just kidding. I'm not The Daily's
Jayson Blair. I've been as truthful as
possible about myself in my columns,
without providing serious campaign
fodder to whomever I run against in the
2032 presidential election.
Over the years, if I've offended you
with anything I've written, lighten up.
And if you've disagreed with anything
I've said, you're probably wrong, so
don't worry about it.
Next week, when I'm in Stanford
Stadium listening to Sandra Day
O'Connor speak about how I can make
a difference in the world, I imagine that
I will be inundated with memories of
the last four years — and frantic worries
about the next four years. My time at
Stanford will be over, and odds are I'll
be more scared than Michael Moore at
an NRA rally in the Deep South.
But I think I've got it figured out. I'm
going to tell myself to calm down, take
deep breaths and think about one thing.
If Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen can be
Army Rangers, I can do anything I set
my mind to. I'm ready to get real. Mad
real. Bring it on.
