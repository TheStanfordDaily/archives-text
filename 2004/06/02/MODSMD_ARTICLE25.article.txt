# YANKEES SUCK

If I were a betting woman, I'd wager you're secretly afraid that
this headline will aptly sum up your summer break. Why? Be
cause every summer inevitably engenders an epic struggle be
tween two fundamental forces: aspiration and malaise.
Yeah, yeah, I know you have some hot 9-to-5 internship at J.P.
GoldmanßainStanleyMorganSachs (or is it 8-to-10? Have fun with

that...). Or maybe you are set up to research
the mating habits of albino platypi in the Aus
tralian Outback. Don't think that excuses you
from this conundrum.
The beauty of summer isn't (only) that you
can jump right back into the grind but get paid
for it. It is finally being free of the prohibitive
nagging of schoolwork so that you can pursue
without guilt the stuff you've been wanting to do
all year.
[Cue after-school special music.]

So now you have a choice, whether you're already signed up for
an 80-hour-a-week job or whether your plan is just to go bum
around suburban Connecticut: Succumb to the couch in your off
time, or do the stuff you've been whining about not getting to do
every weekend for the past nine months. Because, just fora little bit,
you're actually going to have truly free time.
[The more you know... OK, cut the music now, it's getting annoying.]
Sure, you can roll home at 6 from your "productive" day's activ
ities (unless you're working at I.B.OraGoogleAgilentacle, in which
case it'll be 10:30 and you'll be preoccupied wondering why the
world hates you). You can figure you've done your piece, plop
down on the couch to re-watch the old World Series of Poker, real
ize it's 11 p.m., call your mom and hit the sack. Press the repeat but
ton and you've mastered the 9-to-5 lifestyle.
But the sad thing about a situation like that is in 12 weeks you'll
start doing some thinking of your own, and you're going to realize
that there are two certainties in summer. One: Don't do that. And
two: You dropped three months on a false sense of 9-to-5 produc
tivity that that you could have gotten for an $198 subscription to The
Wall Street Journal.
Matt Damon rip-offs aside, the point is that if you consider the
whole point of your summer to be whatever you got hired to do or
volunteered for, then you're missing out. Use the fact that you're
bolstering your resume by day to justify your vegetation by night,
and you've let malaise be the boss of you.
And it should be said that being malaise's minion fora summer
can be a seemingly rewarding jaunt. Comforted by your eight hours
of productivity, catching up on the Friends episodes you missed
seems a just reward. But then, as you're packing to return to the
Farm, you realize that back in June you were psyched to have time
to figure out why your car made that weird creaking noise; to learn
to crochet; to start learning Italian; and to finally take your two-day
monsters-of-classic-rock coastal road trip.
So you wowed the pants off your boss's boss's boss's new
clients. But why aren't your early-summer projects equally worthy
of completion?
[Dammit, that music is back on ... ]
So if you want aspiration to open a can of whup-ass on malaise
this summer, don't let your structured, sanctioned, sterile commit
ments help you cop out from rediscovering the self-initiative that
you used to have time to indulge. Free yourself from the cult of pro
ductivity to realize that the nagging things you want to get done can
be productive too. So fight The Man and do them.
Otherwise you'll return in September with regret — and a fat ass.
