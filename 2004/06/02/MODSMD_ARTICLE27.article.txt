Criticisms of AASA Fashion
Show are unfair
In response to Ricky Wang's let
ter claiming that The AASA Fashion
Show reinforced negative stereotypes
about Asians ("AASA Fashion Show
enforced negative stereotypes," May
27), I just do not see why everything
we do as a large group of Asians has to
have a political agenda. That is pretty
stereotypical in itself. Wang writes
that "One might expect the women of
the show to address the current state
of objectification of Asian American
women in today's media and society."
Yet this was a fashion show — not
some kind of political, Asian-rights
conference. AASA Fashion Show is
one of the biggest events that AASA
puts on every year. Yes, we want to
redefine perceptions, but I think an
other main purpose of the annual
event is to raise money for our charity
while having fun.

Everywhere I turn, I get tiraded
by politically-minded Asians who
complain about racism, objectifica
tion of Asian females and demas

culinization of Asian males in the
media, and the list of complaints goes
on. Is it so terrible that we want to
take a break from it and just put on an
entertaining show that has a worthy
cause as well?
Furthermore, in response to
Wang's individual points of attack:
We did advertise to various lists
about auditioning to be a model, and
we clearly stressed that being Asian
was not a criterion. We can't help it if
few non-Asians tried out.
The music did feature songs by
Asians and Asian Americans. We
used songs by Jay Chou, Cindy Chen,
a Korean pop group and Erica
O'Young (one of our own models).
Wang criticized our models for
the sexy way they walked and danced,
but I am really curious to know how
he would want the show's models to
walk and dance. I am sure he has seen
a fashion show before. Models walk
sexily. They don't strut down the run
way insecurely and asexually.
Wang also charges, "One might
expect that Filipino models would
showcase the Pinoywear line of cloth

ing. front and center... instead, the
majority of models dominating the cat
walk were East Asian". But Pinoywear
was not created just for Filipinos to
wear; in fact, the designer's intention
was to "create clothing for the masses."
Wang makes the fashion show
sound like its a lose-lose situation for
AASA. He belittles us for using
Asian American designers / models
but criticizes us because we don't use
"Asian" songs. No matter what we
do, we are going to make someone
unhappy. Regardless of what a few
people think, 1 had a great time doing
the fashion show — it was one of the
best things I was a part of at Stanford
and I am definitely going through
withdrawal right now. I cannot wait
until next year.

Retirees must educate themselves
about changes in health benefits
Concerning the Daily article of
May 28 on a reduction in scheduled

health benefits ("Provost tells Fac
Sen of cuts for future retirees"), the
University's announcement appears
to affect future retirees, and not those
of us already retired from Stanford.
Stanford can do almost anything
it wants with retirees of any status,
so there will be some comparable
action for those already retired. I
have long felt that for retirees not to
organize in some form is irresponsi
ble to their own interests and to
their cohorts.
What the University announced
is that health benefits will be reduced
for everybody. Price rationing is
Stanford's notion of equitable health
care for staff and faculty. Working
employees of high income will be
able to keep up with this class-based
wealth transfer with no problem.
Stanford's wealthy high-ranking in
sider employees don't care. They
live way above cost. Stanford's plan
is regressive.
Who gets squeezed most in this
planned cost transfer are the lower
paid employees and the poorer re
tirees of the future. For these "loyal

employees," past or present, when
their health care benefit costs rise,
other essentials become unaffordable.
What Stanford is doing is limiting
its liability for the future. In particu
lar, it is limiting overhead to operat
ing expenses. Indemnification is what
health care insurance is about —
asset protection. The question is
whose assets are being protected: the
University's or the employees'?
The medical establishment is
fully prepared to drive any of us into
abject poverty in the event of mas
sive illness. What Stanford has been
assumed to do is to make affordable
options to protect employees and
retirees against catastrophic loss.
Most of us can pay our own medical
bills, absent some awful health fail
ure that lingers.
I have been reading Stanford's
annual employee and retiree litera
ture on health benefits for some
years. There has not been any lan
guage in these annual information
packets that limit employee or retiree
health benefits to a fixed dollar value
by any proscribed schedule projected

into future years.
There certainly were dollar limits
in a given year. That limit was the cost
of the lowest-cost plan, invariably
Kaiser. The University negotiated
plans that included such catastrophic
asset protection.
If the University enters these
agreements with a previously self-im
posed dollar subsidy limit, what does
that do to the negotiation on behalf of
the employee?
Beyond protecting the Universi
ty's operating expenses, the employ
ee or retiree asset protection be
comes at risk, protected only by the
employee's "ability to pay."
The result will inevitably be that
lower-income employees' protection
from the medical establishment's po
lice-enforced cost recovery practices
will be compromised. That is my ap
prehension of the moment.
I have a Web site that intends to
grope with these retiree issues:
