# Sports
## Expand your sports-media consciousness 
### 
Today marks the end of my nine
month tyranny over the Friday
sports page. It heralds a nostalgic
end for some of my readers and a
flamboyant "good riddance" from others.
Some said I should never have been on
the sports page, while others said they only
turned to the sports page to read my col
umn; but from lawn-front peacock hunting
in Arcadia to controversial athlete fashion
stereotyping, I have managed to inspire,
confuse, and just generally piss off a good
number of people.
Look, you can talk about sports in lit
eral terms — who's playing well during
what season, which coach made what
good or bad decision — or you can talk
about sports in situated terms. Or even
better, from your own situated perspec-

tive. I can illustrate this
difference with a refer
ence to my childhood
days at Dodger games:
Some people watch the
game, and some people
watch for the chocolate
malt vendor.
I watched for the
chocolate malt vendor.

passed back to the peanut guy, or how peo
ple would complain about smokers
amongst themselves but never ask the
smokers to stop smoking. And it was this
inquisitive eye of an adolescent social sci
entist that formed the focus of my college
admissions essay.
Kidding.
But sports writing, like anything else
in life, all comes down to marketing.
Yes, newspapers are supposed to be full
of ethical, unbiased reporting on rele
vant issues, but newspapers need to sett
copies just like McDonald's needs to sell
artificial meat product. And my column
sold, whether people were feeling me, or
decided that 1 was single-handedly a
threat against fem-anity.
If you agree that people who are bored
write things that are boring, it makes no
sense for me to talk about whatever it is
most sports columnists care about.
That said, if you want to get in the mix
and expand your sports knowledge, espe
cially if you have none, the resources are
out there. I would assign as suggested read
ing "Mom's pocket guide to watching foot
ball," by former Stanford linebacker
Kailee Wong's mom, who breaks the game
down in the clearest of terms. It opens, "the
object of football is simple: Win the game
by scoring the most points."
I have yet to read past that opening
page, but my boyfriend gave it to me, so I
hang on to it for nostalgic purposes.
For the record, my gender status as a
female is not an end-all explanation for
my column, and I would like to make this
point explicit. American women are
generally less enthusiastic about main
stream sports culture than American
men, but this generalization by no means
assumes that most women share my
views on sports, or should. Female ath
letes are also generally kept out of the
sports media limelight, which favors
mainstream sports and men. I have done
nothing significant to advance female
athlete representation in the media in
this last year, serving instead as a reflec
tion of mainstream Stanford, which
wants to hear about football and some
times basketball.
This is not to be confused with female
athletic ability, and this is a point I would
like to address to all intramural partici
pants: I give IMs a thumbs up, except for
the guys out there who still haven't
learned that people with vaginas can be
good at sports too, good at catching balls
and kicking balls and even throwing
balls. Is this so hard to grasp? Why do
guys always look so shocked when I pass
them jogging? Should my vagina make
me run slower than his penis?
For my confused readers, I want to let
you in on a stylistic point: You can criticize
something and still include yourself in the
criticism. I can say that assuming tall, mus
cular black males on campus are all ath
letes is erroneous and ridiculous, but I also
acknowledge that I have done it. It's called
situated writing, folks, or as some would
say, "keeping it real," or as The Chappie
said, "I am self-aware."
I have had the luxury of spending an en
tire year saying whatever the hell I felt like
saying. I would encourage all of you to find
your own outlets for doing that very thing.
It's refreshing, it's a learning experience
and it makes us all a bit less boring.
And boring is no fun.
