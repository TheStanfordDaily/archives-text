# Tennis caps perfect year
## 
### MIA R. LEE STAFF WRITER 
Last week, the top-ranked Stanford women's tennis team
(35-0) bested UCLA in the NCAA Championship Finals, 4-
1, to clinch a record 13th NCAA title.
On Saturday, the Cardinal's No. 1 singles player, sopho
more Amber Liu, successfully defended her NCAA singles
title against Fresno State freshman Jelena Pandzic. 6-4.0-6,6-
3. A player of Liu's caliber hasn't been seen since former Car
dinal Laura Granville won the 2(KK) title as a freshman and re
peated the feat in 2001.
May Madness is over, and Stanford has capped off a
perfect regular season with an equally flawless run at
NCAAs — begging the question, how did Stanford make
it all look so easy?
Sophomore Alice Barnes, who was named Most Out
standing Flayer after going 3-0 in straight-set wins at the
Athens, Ga., competition, swears by her Prince racket that it
wasn't always easy.
"I think NCAAs were quite a bit different than last
year because there was more pressure and we were ex
pected to win, especially after Florida lost," Barnes said.
"In addition, there was more pressure on the sophomore
players because the other returning members of the team
had at least one NCAA title to their names. Amber and I
didn't want to be going 0-2 when Stanford players are usu
ally 2-2 at that point."
The Cambridge, U.K., native brings to light the curious
road to victory taken by the second-seeded Cardinal. While
the first two rounds of play involved rolling over unseeded
not-even-hopefuls such as Quinnipiac, the final proved — to
the anxious delight of family and fans — that it wouldn't be
NCAAs without a healthy dose of upsets, even between con
ference foes that met three times earlier this year.
At No. 2 doubles, Barnes and Liu teamed up in a decisive
dispatch of No. 43 Jackie Carleton and Feriel Esseghir, 8-3.
The overpowering success on court two marked the first time
the Cardinal had clinched No. 2 doubles over the ninth-seed
ed Bruins.
"Amber never seriously played doubles before college,
and for her to learn a whole new style of tennis in just two
years and play as well as she did is pretty impressive,"
Barnes said.
The crafty Cardinal duo closed out their season with an im
posing 23-3 record, more than making up for the first three
mishaps against UCLA.
Ruthless while on the court, the pair are great friends off it.
7'heir camaraderie has played a key role in strengthening their
doubles tactics.
"We have a really good understanding of each other,"
Barnes said. "For example, she knows that when I lose a cou
ple of points on the serve, 1 tend to rush, and she has no hesi
tation in pointing that out. Just the same, I can point out
Amber's errors and keep her from getting too annoyed."
Errors were a foreign concept to Liu. who stayed in top
mental and physical shape despite two weeks of grueling ten
nis and unforgiving humidity. That said, consider Liu's 6-0
deficit in the second set a blip on the radar, much like her loss
to Pandzic in March, 6-2,6-2.
"I let Jelena roll (and] I didn't fight for the points (then),"
Liu said. "I came out with more fire in the third set."
That fire was enough to drop Pandzic's record to 29-2. The
No. 14 Bulldog hadn't lost a match since February, when she
fell to No. 42 Margarita Karnaukhova of No. 35 Sacramento

State (23-4).
Pandzic, who was seeded third in NCAA Sin
gles, defeated Barnes in last Wednesday's round
of 16,6-2,6-2.
"When I met Jelena in the junior circuit, she was
playing as many tournaments as the professional
players," Barnes said. "She has a very grooved game.
She moves well, is a good anticipator and she just hits
the ball very hard. Her only weakness is her forehand,
which I'm sure Amber played to in the finals."
Barnes' early exit from the individual segment of
NCAAs reminds her of what she'd like to work on for
next season.
"I would really like to make it so that I can beat the
players who play No. 1 for their team," Barnes said.
"For instance, I'd like to get the win over [California's
top-ranked Raquel Kops-Jones] instead of just get
ting to the final and losing to her."
The 5-foot- 1 ) baseliner is referring to her runner
up finish at Pacific-10 Conference Individuals in
April. Despite her 39-7 singles record this year and
her remarkable feat of dropping just one regular sea
son match in the last two years, Barnes has yet to cap
ture an individual title.
I let best successes have been this year's Pac-10
and last season's IT A Northwest Regional Cham
pionships, which she also lost to Kops-Jones, 7-6
(4), 3-6,6-1.
Speaking of titles. No. 40 freshman Theresa
Logar (38-4) completed a promising first year on
the Farm, claiming an individual trophy at the
Freeman Memorial Championships in Las Vegas
and going undefeated at No. 5 singles.
Logar qualified for NCAA Individuals but lost to
No. 3 Vanderbilt's Audra Falk in a second-round
heartbreaking tiebreaker, 4-6,7-5,7-6(7-5).
No. 13 Falk (36-11) lasted until she faced Liu in
the quarterfinals, but was surprised by her round
of 32 success.
"Somehow I just pulled it out; I don't know how,"
Falk said in a press release.
Some aspects of college tennis were meant to re
main a mystery. It will forever remain a mystery how
No. 2 Florida (23-1) stumbled in the second round of
NCAAs against No. 23 Miami, 4-3. We might never
know how Stanford's top-ranked doubles team of se
nior Lauren Barnikow and junior Erin Burdette
bowed out in the first round of NCAA doubles
against a team they rolled over at National Team In-

doors in February, William and Mary's No. 26 Megan Muth
and Amy Wei. 2-6,7-6,6-2.
Everything else about college tennis, however, is a fact, a
score, a host of skills displayed at just the right time to make
the victory sweet and the record unforgettable.
We won't forget Burdette's game-winning overhead
smash in the 112 inals against Esseghir, resulting in a 7-6 (5), 6-3
victory for No. 23 Burdette (25-6) and another coveted
NCAA title for the Cardinal.
We won't forget Barnikow's going undefeated (24-0) dur
ing the regular season in her final year on the Farm, or her in
tuitive teamwork with Burdette, which earned the dynamic
duo a title at the ITA Northwest Regional Championships
last October.
We won't forget No. 60 senior Emilia Anderson (24-7),
who went 1 l-l in four years of NCAA Championships play at

No. 6 singles, including a game-clinching victory over Michi
gan's Debra Streifler in this year's second round, 6-2,6-3.
We won't freshman Anne Yelsey's efforts with Anderson
at No. 3 doubles, as the pair (29-5) made it two semifinals in
the season.
When asked about the biggest challenge facing the Cardi
nal at NCA As, Stanford head coach Lele Forood pointed to
the unfamiliar weather conditions.
"It's just been getting more acclimated to the humidity
and seeing how that affects our raquetry and how the balls
react," Forood said before the round of 16. "From the stan
point of how we're playing, we're in as good of shape as we
can be right now."
Forood's predictions, of course, rang true as the Cardinal
surged ahead to victory. Stanford now has nine NCAA titles
more than the next-closest competitor, Florida.
We won't forget that.
