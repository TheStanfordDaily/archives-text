# Edge loses liquor license, cancels Euromed
## 
### MELANIE CORBETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Organizers were forced to can
cel Euromed, the largest Stanford
graduate student event of the year,
due to the alcohol-license revoca
tion at its host nightclub. The Edge,

in Palo Alto. The Edge manage
ment notified the party's planners
just six hours before it was sched
uled to begin on the evening of May
21, and the intended graduate stu
dent guests did not receive notice
until three hours prior to the antici
pated start time.

This would have been the 14th
Euromed party, which incorporates
music and culture from European,
Mediterranean and other interna
tional origins. It involved nine asso
ciations and two DJs from KZSU.
Organizers said they expected 150
VIPS and over 600 guests.
"We had to cancel it at the last
moment — three hours before —
due to The Edge's management,"
said computer science and eco
nomics graduate student Ron
Fadel, who spent over two months
organizing the event.. "Their lack
of professionalism and their greed
were revolting."
When Fadel and others in
volved in Euromed's coordina
tion arrived at The Edge the af
ternoon of the party, they found a
woman from the Alcohol and
Beverages Comission (ABC)
posting signs reading "No alcohol
in this establishment" and were
notified that The Edge had lost
its alcohol license.
"It was simply inconceivable to
us that they were about to lose their
alcohol license six hours before our
party without giving us a single
warning," said electrical engineer
ing graduate student Eric Pop, one
of the two scheduled DJs.
The ABC agent did not give any
details as to why the license had
been revoked. However, Pop said
that according to the agent, "The
Edge was given a 10-day notice on
May 11, which the owner did not re
spond to, so they came on the 21st
to revoke the alcohol license."
Fadel said that he later spoke
with Dan Navarro, The Edge's
manager, who told him that he had
"just learned the same day" about
the alcohol license revocation.
When Fadel told him that The

Edge had been notified 10 days
earlier, the manager said that
while he didn't know about it, the
owner might have.
According to Fadel, The Edge
management would not reveal to
the Euromed leaders the reasons
why its license was taken away or
allow them to speak with the owner.
Once the Euromed organizers
received the news about the alco
hol policy, they attempted to nego
tiate with the owner of The Edge.
According to the organizers, they
wanted the owner to allow the
party to continue as planned, but
without the alcohol.
"He insisted that the party
could only go on if we charged
everyone $10 cover, including our
VIP list — whom were supposed
to get in free — and those with
student IDs, who were supposed
to pay only $5 cover under our ini
tial agreement," Pop said. "This,
he argued, was the only way he
could recoup some of the losses
from not being able to sell alcohol
that night."
Faced with the prospect of
everyone being required to pay
$10 to enter, Fadel and the stu
dent organizers decided to can
cel the event.
"They were really looking for
the short-term gain," Fadel said of
The Edge management. "They
didn't care; they just wanted to use
the situation as much as they could
to make more money."
Pop concurred, stating that they
are "clearly more interested in
short-term gain than in keeping
their word and maintaining a good
relationship with Stanford party
promoters."

The Edge, a popular nightclub in downtown Palo Alto, recently had its liquor
lisence revoked, prompting the cancellation of the graduate event Euromed.
Nicholas Nodenot, who orga
nized The Edge's two previous Eu
romed parties, expressed similar
dissatisfaction with the organiza
tion's management.
"They were absolutely unpro
fessional," Nodenot said. "[For ex
ample], they didn't reply to e-mails
... while we went to a lot of trouble
to put on the event."
Fadel commented on the neg
ative effects that the cancellation
will have on members of the grad
uate student community, as
events like this cannot be held on
campus right now due to the

school's many restrictions.
"It gives a bad reputation to
Stanford parties and to Euromed,"
Fadel said. "That's what makes me
most upset."
KSZU General Manager
Chuan-Mei Lee, a senior, noted
the additional harm to both The
Edge and the area's social options
in general.
"After losing their liquor li
cense, it is likely that they will
not be able to book acts of the
same caliber, since the venue re
ally depends on alcohol sales to
make any money," Lee said. "It
seems like a big loss to them and
a loss to people who are looking
fora night out in the mid-penin
sula area."
The Edge management did not
respond to requests for comment.
