# Corkery/Warburg capture doubles title
## 
### KAIYA REEVE STAFF WRITER 
On a weekend that saw tornados sweep through Ok
lahoma, a couple of Cardinal men's tennis players caused
a storm of their own at the NCAA Championships.

After playing the best doubles teams in the country
through five grueling rounds, the seventh-seeded tan
dem of sophomore K.C. Corkery and junior Sam War
burg captured the 2004 NCAA doubles championship
in Tulsa, Okla., on Monday.
The Stanford dream team began their road to vic-

Tory on Thursday when they out
played unseeded David Goulet and
Michael Kogan of Tulane, 5-7, 6-4, 6-
4, in the round of 32. It took less ef
fort to take out Arizona's Roger
Matalonga and Colin O'Grady on
Friday, 7-5, 6-3.
"First of all, it was really hot out here,
which I know can take its toll on any
body, especially with us having long
matches in the morning with our sin
gles," Warburg said. "The heat was our
first opponent. These guys served real
well and it was hard for us to get a
break. Late in the first set, we got one
opportunity and we took advantage of
it, which was great."
Jumping into the quarterfinals, the
Cardinal duo was pitted against Calle
Hansen and Pedro Rico of Pepperdine.
Corkery / Warburg easily defeated the
unseeded duo, 6-3, 6-4.
Sunday was a beautiful day for the
Stanford men, despite changing winds
and tornado warnings.
Corkery / Warburg took the first set
easily against Clemson's Jermaine
Jenkins and Nathan Thompson, but the
duo was unable to fight off the Tigers
for long, losing the second set 6-7 (5).
The Stanford men came back to battle
their way to a nail-biting, 6-1, 6-7 (5), 7-
6 (9-7) victory.
"They really showed us why they made
it this far," Corkery said. "We came out
with good energy and got up on them
early. I think one of their weaknesses is
that they don't serve really well. We had
chances to break in the first set, but
those opportunities were not there in
the second and third set. It was just a
fantastic match."
The final step .towards victory was
taken when Corkery and Warburg went
up against Bo Hodge and John Isner
of Georgia on Monday afternoon.
Once again, the Cardinal men took
the first set with ease, but were unable
to hold onto the second. They

bounced back in the third, however, capturing a 6-2, 6-
7, 6-4 win and the championship.
"We started off well," Corkery said. "That's some
thing we've been doing all tournament well . . . We re
ally wanted to make them play and not give anything
away in the first couple of games, because it's very easy
to be nervous in the national championship.
"I don't now if they were feeling it, but we wanted tq
make sure they played a lot of balls in the beginning. It
worked out well for us, and we got up a break. Then ev
eryone kind of settled down, and it was a battle from
there on out, and we were able to do it at the end."
Cardinal coach Dick Gould enjoyed the match.
"I thought it was like two heavyweights just going in the
ring and letting it out," he said. "Someone was going to have
to give a little bit. Neither one would give. It was toe to toe."
Corkery / Warburg are the 14th Stanford men's dou
bles team to capture an NCAA championship, ending
the year on a high note and giving head coach Dick
Gould a fantastic farewell present.
This season definitely had its ups and downs for the
Stanford men's team, though. The Cardinal was unable to
capture the NCAA team championship, and it is losing
Gould after 38 years of coaching excellence. The team
started out with a No. 5 ranking in the Intercollegiate
Tennis Association preseason poll, but dropped to No. 8.
Since the beginning of the 2003-2004 season, the
Stanford players have received multiple awards and
trophies recognizing their contribution to the world of
collegiate tennis.
Warburg, a recent standout, was named Pac-10 Play
er of the Year after winning the Pac-10 Singles Cham
pionship. The ITA also announced a few days ago that
Warburg was the new National Player To Watch, an
award given to a non-senior who has a promising future
in tennis.
Freshman James Wan has also proved to be a very
valuable asset to the team this year, at one point rack
ing up a 21-match win streak. Wan was named the Pac
-10 Co-Newcomer of the Year, sharing the distinction
with Washington's Alex Slovic.
Senior team captain Carter Morris will leave the
Farm after contributing five years to the Stanford team,
and was recently recognized for his academic achieve
ments when he was given Pacific-10 All-Academic hon
ors. Honorable mentions went to Corkery and sopho
more James Pade.
Regardless, the person who has had the most impact
on the team has been Gould. The celebrated coach will
become Stanford's Director of Tennis next year after
handing off his head-coaching job to assistant coach John
Whitlinger. Gould has led the team to 17 NCAA champi
onships and has been named Pac-10 Coach of the Year
eight times. Gould will be sorely missed out on the courts,
but at least he will still be around for many years to come.
