# Softball falls one short of final
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After losing its first game at the Women's College World
Series, 8-2, to No. 2 UCLA on Thursday, the Cardinal soft
ball team looked like it might be headed toward a quick exit
from Oklahoma City this past weekend. If this had been the
case, the Cardinal would still have posted the second-best
season in school history.
Thursday predictions of the Cardinal's demise proved to
be premature, however, as Stanford battled back on Satur
day to post two straight wins against the No. 6 and No. I
seeds, respectively, before falling in a national semifinal re
match against UCLA.
Saturday morning's game against sixth-seeded Michigan
(54-13) was tied up 4-4 going into the final inning before a
sacrifice fly by junior second baseman Meghan Sickler
scored freshman pinch-runner Shoney Hixson to give the
Cardinal a 5-4 lead, which ace pitcher Dana Sorensen held
in the bottom of the seventh to send the Wolverines back to
Ann Arbor and advance the Cardinal to an afternoon
matchup against top seed Oklahoma (45-22).
With Hall of Fame Stadium in Oklahoma City packed
with thousands of screaming Sooner fans, Oklahoma
jumped out to an early lead after scoring two runs, both
unearned, off Sorensen in the top of the first inning. Al
though these would be the only runs Sorensen would
allow in the game, the Cardinal was unable to manufac
ture much offense in support off Oklahoma's Kami Keit
er and Stanford entered the bottom of the sixth inning
facing a 2-1 deficit.
The Cardinal's fortunes changed quickly, though, as

sophomore shortstop Lauren Lappin led off the inning with
a home run that tied the game, 2-2. Later in the bottom of
the sixth, Meghan Sickler drove in the winning run for the
second straight game with an RBI triple to score pinch-run
ner Hixson and give the Cardinal a 3-2 lead that would
prove to be the final margin of victory for the Cardinal.
Saturday's wins set up a Sunday rematch versus No. 2
UCLA in the national semifinals, and the Cardinal put up a
valiant effort behind an amazing performance by Sorensen
in the circle. Sorensen pitched all 12 innings of a marathon,
extra-innings nail-biter before finally succumbing to the
dangerous UCLA lineup in the 12th in a season-ending loss
to the Bruins, 3-1. UCLA advanced to the national champi
onship game with the victory.
Despite Sunday's disappointment, there was much to be
proud of for the Cardinal this year in a season that went
above and beyond anyone's expectations.
The Cardinal's 49 wins were the second-highest total in
school history, and its 13 conference wins were the most by
a Stanford team since the Pacific-10 switched to a 21-game
schedule in 2000. Even more impressively, the Cardinal fin
ished this year tied for second in the Pac-10 — the best con
ference finish in the history of the program.
This year's NCAA Regional win and subsequent
WCWS berth was only the second in school history, and the
two wins in Oklahoma by this year's squad matched the
Cardinal's 2001 World Series team. Considering the team's
goal all season was to make the Series, this year's ultimate
result — an extra-innings loss in the national semifinals —
was a success by any measure.
The Cardinal pitching staff was led by senior ace
Sorensen, a first-team All-American this year. "Lightning

D" shattered her own school record for victories in a season
in compiling a 34-11 record, including two wins in the World
Series and four wins in Regional play. She also set a single
season school record with 358 strikeouts, besting her own
record of 332 from last year.
Sorensen leaves the Farm as the most decorated
pitcher in Stanford softball history, with three All-Amer
ica selections and Stanford career records for earned run
average (1.03), victories (105) and strikeouts (1054).
Sorensen also holds the single-season school records in
these three categories.
The Cardinal offensive attack was keyed by the team's
other senior, catcher Jessica Allister, a second-team All-
American selection. Allister led the Cardinal with 12 home
runs, just two under the school record of 14 set by Olympian
Jessica Mendoza in 2001 and 2002. Allister's 32 career
homers place her second on Stanford's all-time list behind
the legendary Mendoza. Allister led the Cardinal in home
runs, RBIs (55) and total bases and was third on the team in
batting average (.345) and hits (70).
While co-captains Sorensen and Allister will be sore
ly missed next year, the heart of the Cardinal batting
order will remain essentially intact next year. Indeed, the
team's top two hitters — shortstop Lauren Lappin and
left fielder Jackie Rinehart — will be around fora long
time. Lappin, a sophomore, was a second-team All-
American and will be an alternate on the U.S. Olympic
team this summer in Athens. Lappin led the Cardinal in
batting (.358) and placed second on the squad in hits (73),
trailing only Jackie Rinehart in this category. Rinehart
led Stanford as a true freshman with 80 base knocks and
provided a spark at the top of the lineup all year as the

Cardinal's leadoff hitter.
Other key bats in the Cardinal lineup were sophomore
center fielder Catalina Morris and junior first baseman
Leah Nelson. Morris batted .305 with a team-leading 51
runs scored, and Nelson took her game to another level
when it counted the most this season, smacking a towering
home run in the clinching game of the NCAA Regional and
also homering in the first game of the WCWS.
Sickler demonstrated an uncanny knack for the
timely hit all season long, including two game-win
ning hits in the Series. Junior third baseman Liz
Bendig, last year's Most Improved Player, slumped
early in the season but came back strong in Pac-10
play near the end of the year, including a seven-game
hitting streak leading into NCAA Regionals. Junior
right fielder Katharine Hoffman, a former cross
country runner at Stanford, led the team in stolen
bases with 18 in 23 attempts.
With the Cardinal offensive nucleus largely intact for
next year, the question is obvious: who will replace
Sorensen as the Cardinal's ace? Sophomore Laura Sever
son and freshman Danika Dukes both have some experi
ence in the circle, and Severson showed promise in several
starts earlier this year before a disappointing performance
in Oklahoma City.
Run support shouldn't be a problem with Lappin,
Morris, Nelson and other big bats returning for the Car
dinal, so next season will hinge on finding a pitcher ca
pable of making 30 or 40 quality starts. One thing is cer
tain: the 2005 Stanford softball team will have a lot to
live up to, following one of the best seasons in the histo
ry of the program.

ly missed next year, the heart of the Cardinal batting
order will remain essentially intact next year. Indeed, the
team's top two hitters — shortstop Lauren Lappin and
left fielder Jackie Rinehart — will be around fora long
time. Lappin, a sophomore, was a second-team All-
American and will be an alternate on the U.S. Olympic
team this summer in Athens. Lappin led the Cardinal in
batting (.358) and placed second on the squad in hits (73),
trailing only Jackie Rinehart in this category. Rinehart
led Stanford as a true freshman with 80 base knocks and
provided a spark at the top of the lineup all year as the

Cardinal's leadoff hitter.
Other key bats in the Cardinal lineup were sophomore
center fielder Catalina Morris and junior first baseman
Leah Nelson. Morris batted .305 with a team-leading 51
runs scored, and Nelson took her game to another level
when it counted the most this season, smacking a towering
home run in the clinching game of the NCAA Regional and
also homering in the first game of the WCWS.
Sickler demonstrated an uncanny knack for the
timely hit all season long, including two game-win
ning hits in the Series. Junior third baseman Liz
Bendig, last year's Most Improved Player, slumped
early in the season but came back strong in Pac-10
play near the end of the year, including a seven-game
hitting streak leading into NCAA Regionals. Junior
right fielder Katharine Hoffman, a former cross
country runner at Stanford, led the team in stolen
bases with 18 in 23 attempts.
With the Cardinal offensive nucleus largely intact for
next year, the question is obvious: who will replace
Sorensen as the Cardinal's ace? Sophomore Laura Sever
son and freshman Danika Dukes both have some experi
ence in the circle, and Severson showed promise in several
starts earlier this year before a disappointing performance
in Oklahoma City.
Run support shouldn't be a problem with Lappin,
Morris, Nelson and other big bats returning for the Car
dinal, so next season will hinge on finding a pitcher ca
pable of making 30 or 40 quality starts. One thing is cer
tain: the 2005 Stanford softball team will have a lot to
live up to, following one of the best seasons in the histo
ry of the program.
After losing its first game at the Women's College World
Series, 8-2, to No. 2 UCLA on Thursday, the Cardinal soft
ball team looked like it might be headed toward a quick exit
from Oklahoma City this past weekend. If this had been the
case, the Cardinal would still have posted the second-best
season in school history.
Thursday predictions of the Cardinal's demise proved to
be premature, however, as Stanford battled back on Satur
day to post two straight wins against the No. 6 and No. I
seeds, respectively, before falling in a national semifinal re
match against UCLA.
Saturday morning's game against sixth-seeded Michigan
(54-13) was tied up 4-4 going into the final inning before a
sacrifice fly by junior second baseman Meghan Sickler
scored freshman pinch-runner Shoney Hixson to give the
Cardinal a 5-4 lead, which ace pitcher Dana Sorensen held
in the bottom of the seventh to send the Wolverines back to
Ann Arbor and advance the Cardinal to an afternoon
matchup against top seed Oklahoma (45-22).
With Hall of Fame Stadium in Oklahoma City packed
with thousands of screaming Sooner fans, Oklahoma
jumped out to an early lead after scoring two runs, both
unearned, off Sorensen in the top of the first inning. Al
though these would be the only runs Sorensen would
allow in the game, the Cardinal was unable to manufac
ture much offense in support off Oklahoma's Kami Keit
er and Stanford entered the bottom of the sixth inning
facing a 2-1 deficit.
The Cardinal's fortunes changed quickly, though, as

sophomore shortstop Lauren Lappin led off the inning with
a home run that tied the game, 2-2. Later in the bottom of
the sixth, Meghan Sickler drove in the winning run for the
second straight game with an RBI triple to score pinch-run
ner Hixson and give the Cardinal a 3-2 lead that would
prove to be the final margin of victory for the Cardinal.
Saturday's wins set up a Sunday rematch versus No. 2
UCLA in the national semifinals, and the Cardinal put up a
valiant effort behind an amazing performance by Sorensen
in the circle. Sorensen pitched all 12 innings of a marathon,
extra-innings nail-biter before finally succumbing to the
dangerous UCLA lineup in the 12th in a season-ending loss
to the Bruins, 3-1. UCLA advanced to the national champi
onship game with the victory.
Despite Sunday's disappointment, there was much to be
proud of for the Cardinal this year in a season that went
above and beyond anyone's expectations.
The Cardinal's 49 wins were the second-highest total in
school history, and its 13 conference wins were the most by
a Stanford team since the Pacific-10 switched to a 21-game
schedule in 2000. Even more impressively, the Cardinal fin
ished this year tied for second in the Pac-10 — the best con
ference finish in the history of the program.
This year's NCAA Regional win and subsequent
WCWS berth was only the second in school history, and the
two wins in Oklahoma by this year's squad matched the
Cardinal's 2001 World Series team. Considering the team's
goal all season was to make the Series, this year's ultimate
result — an extra-innings loss in the national semifinals —
was a success by any measure.
The Cardinal pitching staff was led by senior ace
Sorensen, a first-team All-American this year. "Lightning

D" shattered her own school record for victories in a season
in compiling a 34-11 record, including two wins in the World
Series and four wins in Regional play. She also set a single
season school record with 358 strikeouts, besting her own
record of 332 from last year.
Sorensen leaves the Farm as the most decorated
pitcher in Stanford softball history, with three All-Amer
ica selections and Stanford career records for earned run
average (1.03), victories (105) and strikeouts (1054).
Sorensen also holds the single-season school records in
these three categories.
The Cardinal offensive attack was keyed by the team's
other senior, catcher Jessica Allister, a second-team All-
American selection. Allister led the Cardinal with 12 home
runs, just two under the school record of 14 set by Olympian
Jessica Mendoza in 2001 and 2002. Allister's 32 career
homers place her second on Stanford's all-time list behind
the legendary Mendoza. Allister led the Cardinal in home
runs, RBIs (55) and total bases and was third on the team in
batting average (.345) and hits (70).

ly missed next year, the heart of the Cardinal batting
order will remain essentially intact next year. Indeed, the
