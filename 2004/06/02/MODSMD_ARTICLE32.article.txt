# 15 track athletes qualify for NCAA Championships
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's off to nationals for many of Stanford's track
and field athletes. 15 athletes finished in the top five
as individuals or in the top three with their relay team
at the West Regional Championships to automatical
ly punch their tickets to Austin, Texas, for the
NCAA Championships.
The Cardinal also got three school records from the
women's squad and one from the men.
"Our athletes did an excellent job this weekend," said
head men's coach Robert Weir. "We qualified who we ex
pected to qualify, and we have a few others who put them
selves into position to get an at-large mark."
The season for the men's sprinting squad has been
nothing short of amazing as only one individual had post
ed a regional mark before Big Meet on May first. Now, just
a month later, the sprinters have broken a school record,
automatically qualified one individual to the NCAA
Championships and look poised to get another athlete and
both relay squads to Austin through at-large bids.
After standing for 26 years, the school record of 39.84
seconds in the men's 400-meter relay fell when the team of
sophomore T.J. Rushing and juniors Stanley Wilson, Curt
Goehring and Nick Sebes ran 39.71 seconds.
The team is currently No. 16 in the nation, and while the
squad only finished fourth at the West Regional Champi
onships, it is now in position to receive one of the six to
eight at-large bids that will be awarded.
The 1,600-meter relay team faltered in the regional fi
nals, but its time of 3 minutes, 7.53 seconds. No. 19 in the
nation, may earn it a berth in Texas.
" Wilson, after just one month of training, punched his
ticket to the NCAA Championships with a fifth-place fin
ish in the 100 meters.
Wilson is Stanford's first individual sprinter to make
nationals since Rene Rodriguez qualified in the 400 in
1994. Wilson is the first 100-meter qualifier since 1977.
And he might not be alone this year. Junior Nick Sebes
faded at the end of the 400 at the Regional Championships
to finish ninth, but may have a fast enough time to earn an
at-large bid to Austin.
The women had even more success in the sprints.
Freshman Janice Davis finished fifth in the 200 to qualify
for NCAAs, while sophomore Nashonme Johnson will be
making her second individual trip to nationals, this time in
the 400 after representing Stanford in the 200 last year.
Both were also part of Stanford's record-setting 1,600-

meter relay team that ran a 3:33.09 — the fastest time in
school history — to finish second. The squad broke their
own school record of 3:33.98 set earlier this year at the
Texas Relays.
The women's 400-meter relay was disqualified in
the preliminary rounds on Friday, but the team has the
10th fastest time in the nation and will receive an invi
tation to Austin.
"Our women really did a nice job, really stepped up,"
said head women's coach Edrick Floreal. "There were a
couple chances for us to maybe get another athlete in, but
overall things went well."
Stanford's other school records came in the 1,500 me
ters and the 3,000-meter steeplechase.
Freshman Ari Lambie finished second to Southern
California's Iryna Vashchuk in the 1,500 in a fresh
man record 4:13.14. Fellow freshman Katy Trotter
finished fourth in the steeplechase in 10:07.55 to
break the 2002 school record held by former All-
American Laura Turner.
Trotter's race saw Northern Arizona's Ida Nilsson
run a collegiate-record 9:43.25, out-kicking former col
legiate record-holder Kassi Anderson of Brigham
Young. It is the third outdoor distance collegiate record
to fall this year.
The women also claimed two individual titles at the
West Regional Championships.
Senior Jill Camarena threw 55 feet, 7.75 inches to
take the shot put title and junior Sara Bei claimed her
second consecutive regional title in the 5,000 meters.
Both athletes are considered contenders for national ti
tles in their events.
As always, the men's distance squad also sent sev
eral athletes to nationals, despite some less than stel
lar performances.
Junior Don Sage claimed third in the 1,500 in 3:45.21.
The reigning NCAA champion, senior Grant Robison,
finished 10th in 3:50.00. Robison will get an at-large bid to
nationals because he currently has the ninth-fastest time in
the nation.
In the 5,000, seniors Seth Hejny and Louis Luchini
qualified for nationals after finishing second and third, re
spectively. Arizona's Robert Cheseret claimed the indi
vidual title in 14:09.86.
Sophomore Jacob Gomez finished sixth and should
make it in with an at-large bid since his 13:56.77 ranks him
No. 16 in the nation.
In the 3,000-meter steeplechase, junior lan Dobson
finished second down the stretch to Arizona State's

Aaron Aguayo.
On Monday, just two days after his regional run, Dob
son ran an 8:32.09 at the U.S. Open to post the fastest time
in the NCAA this year, and run just shy of the Olympic
"B" standard of 8:32.00.
The time is also a school record, breaking the 2002
record of 8:35.86 held by former Ail-American Jesse
Thomas. Dobson is considered a favorite to win NCAAs
in the steeple despite it not being his focus event.
Senior Jay Goff came back strong after his seventh
place finish in the javelin at the Pac-10 Championships to
finish fifth at regionals in a personal-best 218-08. Goff re
turns to the NCAA Championships for the first time after
breaking his foot at nationals his sophomore year.

It wasn't all success for the Cardinal,
though, as it had some near misses and
bad breaks.
Junior Undine Becker returned from
injury just in time for the post-season and
finished a heart-breaking sixth in the long
jump. Sophomore Sarah Hopping met
the same fate by finishing sixth in the
hammer. Both athletes are just shy of an
at-large bid, unless several athletes above
them on the list decide to withdraw.
Junior Christine Moschella finished
sixth in the 200, just 0.06 seconds behind
Davis, who took the fifth spot. Davis also
finished sixth in the 100, just 0.02 seconds

behind Halima Decree, who took fifth.
Sophomore Solomon Welch had a personal best
jump of 51-5.00 in the triple jump but finished only
eighth. Welch is now No. 3 on Stanford's all-time list
with the mark.
Junior Will O'Neill finished eighth in the discus with a
toss of 169-5, just five feet from qualifying for nationals.
Final declaration lists should be up sometime this
evening, when the Cardinal will see if it got as many as
24 athletes to nationals. NCAAs begin on June 9 in
Austin and will conclude on June 12 with many of the
finals — including the men's and women's 1,500 and
5,000, in which the Cardinal will field contenders for
national titles.
