# Baseball to host Regional
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Sixty-four teams begin their journey down the road
to the College World Series this Friday as double-elimi
nation Regional play begins on 16 campuses throughout
the country.
For the Palo Alto Regional host and top-ranked Stan
ford — looking to make its way back to Omaha fora school
record extending sixth consecutive season — the first leg of
the trip is daunting, thanks to a familiar postseason guest
and projected top pick in next week's Major League Base
ball draft.
As expected, the Cardinal (44-12,17-9 Pacific-10 Con
ference) garnered one of top eight national seeds — No.
5 — fora sixth consecutive season, meaning it will host
the Super Regional at Sunken Diamond should it survive
this weekend.
Standing in Stanford's way is second-seeded Long Beach
State and Ail-American ace Jered Weaver, marking the
fourth straight year that the 49ers have traveled to Sunken
Diamond in the postseason. St. John's (36-21), which re
ceived an at-large berth out of the Big East Conference, and
UNLV (37-22), which won the Mountain West Conference
tournament, are the third and fourth seeds, respectively.
The Cardinal will play fourth-seeded UNLV on Friday
night at 6 p.m. with the winner advancing to take on the win
ner of Friday's afternoon game between Long Beach and St.
John's on Saturday at 3 p.m.
The losers of Friday's two games will meet on Saturday at
11 a.m. in an elimination game. The team that survives that
game will play the loser of Saturday's winner's bracket game
in another elimination game at 7 p.m.
The last two teams standing will square off on Sunday at
1 p.m. (and again at 5 p.m., if necessary) for the Champi
onship and the right to advance to the Super Regional round
to be held next weekend.
This weekend marks the beginning of the last chance for
a group of Stanford seniors—Brian Hall, Sam Fuld, Jonny
Ash and David O'Hagan—to win their first College World
Series title. The Cardinal has been to the championship
game in three of the last five years but lost each time.
Fuld will need 16 hits this postseason to break the career
Stanford and Pac-10 record for hits, held by ex-Cardinal first
baseman John Gall (368).
Ranked in the top-10 for most of the season. Long
Beach slipped to No. 18 in the latest poll after losing seven
straight and any hopes of earning a No. 1 seed and home
field advantage.
"We kind of expected Long Beach to come this
way," Hall said. "We've had them the last few years.
We kind of know what we're up against. They are a
very aggressive team."
Any discussion of Long Beach State starts with
Weaver, who is 14-1 with a 1.68 ERA this season. Before
Miami roughed him up for seven runs in 6 1 / 3 innings
pitched last week. Weaver had not lost since last year's
setback to Stanford in the second game of the Super Re
gional. The junior has struck out 193 in 128.1 innings of
work, while walking just 18.
"He's the best player in college baseball," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "I don't think anyone would
want to face him if they could prevent it."
Stanford ost likely can't prevent it this weekend, as many
believe Long Beach head coach Mike Weathers will opt to
save Weaver fora potential Saturday matchup with Stan

ford. If that's the case. Long Beach will rely on sophomore
southpaw Cesar Ramos to get back on the winning track on
Friday. Ramos is 10-4 with a 2.10 ERA and opponents are
hitting just .220 off of him.
Marquess is leaning toward starting sophomore
right-hander Jeff Gilmore on Friday and using No. 1
starter Mark Romanczuk on Saturday, citing a more fa
vorable matchup for Gilmore against UNLV's right
handed heavy lineup compared to those of Long Beach
and St. John's.
"The good thing is we don't have a problem with pitch
count and I could pitch basically anybody," Marquess said.
While Weaver makes Long Beach a tough draw for any
team, Marquess posited that given the tournament's format,
there's no such thing as an easy road to Omaha.
"There really is no easy team," Marquess said. "Either
you're playing a hot team or a team that has a great pitcher.
That's a great equalizer, one great pitcher that's on in one
game or a team that's playing unconscious."
UNLV fits the latter description. The Rebels team
ERA is an ugly 6.07 but head coach Buddy Gouldsmith's
lineup has more than made up for it by putting crooked
numbers on the scoreboard. While their gaudy offensive
statistics are inflated somewhat due to the high altitudes
they frequently play in throughout the Mountain West
Conference season, UNLV is batting .338 as a team and is
averaging 10.1 runs per game.
Senior right fielder Eric Nielsen, who is hitting .410 with
16 home runs and 86 RBI, leads the Rebels' offensive attack.
St. John's, which returns to the tournament field for the
first time since 1997, is a more balanced team. The Red
Storm finished tied for second in the Big East Conference
thanks to a solid pitching staff led by sophomore Anthony
Varvaro (8-3, 3.80 ERA) and an offense batting .300 that
creates runs through aggressive base running.
The Red Storm opened the season 3-8 before winning 15
of their next 16 games.
Stanford, which is 15-2 in Regional play over the past five
seasons, is hosting an NCAA Regional for the ninth consec
utive year and for the 13th time in school history.
Looking ahead, the team that advances out of the Palo
Alto Regional will play the winner of the South Bend Re
gional in a best-of-three series, with the winner advancing to
the College World Series.
As the host, the Irish (49-10) are the favorites to advance
but could be derailed by second-seeded UC Irvine or third
seeded Arizona (30-24-1).
The Pac-10 is well represented in this year's field with five
teams selected. In addition to Stanford and Arizona, Ari
zona State (40-16) earned the No. 7 national seed, but be
cause the Sun Devils did not bid to host a Regional, they
must travel to second-seeded Cal State Fullerton and get by
Minnesota and Pepperdine to advance.
Washington garnered a No. 2 seed and will make its
third straight postseason appearance in the Mississippi
Regional. —
UCLA, which came on strong toward the end of the sea
son, earned a No. 3 seed in the Oklahoma City Regional.
The Bruins are making their first tournament appearance
since 2000.
"I think West coast baseball is really underrated," Mar
quess said. "I think where we're really underestimated is
how well west coast teams do in the tournament and what
they do in the World Series."
Marquess probably hopes at least his own team proves
him right starting this weekend.

Senior Jonny Ash and the baseball team will face UNLV in the first game of the NCAA Regional tournament at Sunken
Diamond on Friday. The Cardinal will have to win three of four games to advance.
Sixty-four teams begin their journey down the road
to the College World Series this Friday as double-elimi
nation Regional play begins on 16 campuses throughout
the country.
For the Palo Alto Regional host and top-ranked Stan
ford — looking to make its way back to Omaha fora school
record extending sixth consecutive season — the first leg of
the trip is daunting, thanks to a familiar postseason guest
and projected top pick in next week's Major League Base
ball draft.
As expected, the Cardinal (44-12,17-9 Pacific-10 Con
ference) garnered one of top eight national seeds — No.
5 — fora sixth consecutive season, meaning it will host
the Super Regional at Sunken Diamond should it survive
this weekend.
Standing in Stanford's way is second-seeded Long Beach
State and Ail-American ace Jered Weaver, marking the
fourth straight year that the 49ers have traveled to Sunken
Diamond in the postseason. St. John's (36-21), which re
ceived an at-large berth out of the Big East Conference, and
UNLV (37-22), which won the Mountain West Conference
tournament, are the third and fourth seeds, respectively.
The Cardinal will play fourth-seeded UNLV on Friday
night at 6 p.m. with the winner advancing to take on the win
ner of Friday's afternoon game between Long Beach and St.
John's on Saturday at 3 p.m.
The losers of Friday's two games will meet on Saturday at
11 a.m. in an elimination game. The team that survives that
game will play the loser of Saturday's winner's bracket game
in another elimination game at 7 p.m.
The last two teams standing will square off on Sunday at
1 p.m. (and again at 5 p.m., if necessary) for the Champi
onship and the right to advance to the Super Regional round
to be held next weekend.
This weekend marks the beginning of the last chance for
a group of Stanford seniors—Brian Hall, Sam Fuld, Jonny
Ash and David O'Hagan—to win their first College World
Series title. The Cardinal has been to the championship
game in three of the last five years but lost each time.
Fuld will need 16 hits this postseason to break the career
Stanford and Pac-10 record for hits, held by ex-Cardinal first
baseman John Gall (368).
Ranked in the top-10 for most of the season. Long
Beach slipped to No. 18 in the latest poll after losing seven
straight and any hopes of earning a No. 1 seed and home
field advantage.
"We kind of expected Long Beach to come this
way," Hall said. "We've had them the last few years.
We kind of know what we're up against. They are a
very aggressive team."
Any discussion of Long Beach State starts with
Weaver, who is 14-1 with a 1.68 ERA this season. Before
Miami roughed him up for seven runs in 6 1 / 3 innings
pitched last week. Weaver had not lost since last year's
setback to Stanford in the second game of the Super Re
gional. The junior has struck out 193 in 128.1 innings of
work, while walking just 18.
"He's the best player in college baseball," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "I don't think anyone would
want to face him if they could prevent it."
Stanford ost likely can't prevent it this weekend, as many
believe Long Beach head coach Mike Weathers will opt to
save Weaver fora potential Saturday matchup with Stan

ford. If that's the case. Long Beach will rely on sophomore
southpaw Cesar Ramos to get back on the winning track on
Friday. Ramos is 10-4 with a 2.10 ERA and opponents are
hitting just .220 off of him.
Marquess is leaning toward starting sophomore
right-hander Jeff Gilmore on Friday and using No. 1
starter Mark Romanczuk on Saturday, citing a more fa
vorable matchup for Gilmore against UNLV's right
handed heavy lineup compared to those of Long Beach
and St. John's.
"The good thing is we don't have a problem with pitch
count and I could pitch basically anybody," Marquess said.
While Weaver makes Long Beach a tough draw for any
team, Marquess posited that given the tournament's format,
there's no such thing as an easy road to Omaha.
"There really is no easy team," Marquess said. "Either
you're playing a hot team or a team that has a great pitcher.
That's a great equalizer, one great pitcher that's on in one
game or a team that's playing unconscious."
UNLV fits the latter description. The Rebels team
ERA is an ugly 6.07 but head coach Buddy Gouldsmith's
lineup has more than made up for it by putting crooked
numbers on the scoreboard. While their gaudy offensive
statistics are inflated somewhat due to the high altitudes
they frequently play in throughout the Mountain West
Conference season, UNLV is batting .338 as a team and is
averaging 10.1 runs per game.
Senior right fielder Eric Nielsen, who is hitting .410 with
16 home runs and 86 RBI, leads the Rebels' offensive attack.
St. John's, which returns to the tournament field for the
first time since 1997, is a more balanced team. The Red
Storm finished tied for second in the Big East Conference
thanks to a solid pitching staff led by sophomore Anthony
Varvaro (8-3, 3.80 ERA) and an offense batting .300 that
creates runs through aggressive base running.
The Red Storm opened the season 3-8 before winning 15
of their next 16 games.
Stanford, which is 15-2 in Regional play over the past five
seasons, is hosting an NCAA Regional for the ninth consec
utive year and for the 13th time in school history.
Looking ahead, the team that advances out of the Palo
Alto Regional will play the winner of the South Bend Re
gional in a best-of-three series, with the winner advancing to
the College World Series.
As the host, the Irish (49-10) are the favorites to advance
but could be derailed by second-seeded UC Irvine or third
seeded Arizona (30-24-1).
The Pac-10 is well represented in this year's field with five
teams selected. In addition to Stanford and Arizona, Ari
zona State (40-16) earned the No. 7 national seed, but be
cause the Sun Devils did not bid to host a Regional, they
must travel to second-seeded Cal State Fullerton and get by
Minnesota and Pepperdine to advance.
Washington garnered a No. 2 seed and will make its
third straight postseason appearance in the Mississippi
Regional. —
UCLA, which came on strong toward the end of the sea
son, earned a No. 3 seed in the Oklahoma City Regional.
The Bruins are making their first tournament appearance

averaging 10.1 runs per game.
Senior right fielder Eric Nielsen, who is hitting .410 with
16 home runs and 86 RBI, leads the Rebels' offensive attack.
St. John's, which returns to the tournament field for the
first time since 1997, is a more balanced team. The Red
Storm finished tied for second in the Big East Conference
thanks to a solid pitching staff led by sophomore Anthony
Varvaro (8-3, 3.80 ERA) and an offense batting .300 that
creates runs through aggressive base running.
The Red Storm opened the season 3-8 before winning 15
of their next 16 games.
Stanford, which is 15-2 in Regional play over the past five
seasons, is hosting an NCAA Regional for the ninth consec
utive year and for the 13th time in school history.
Looking ahead, the team that advances out of the Palo
Alto Regional will play the winner of the South Bend Re
gional in a best-of-three series, with the winner advancing to
the College World Series.
As the host, the Irish (49-10) are the favorites to advance
but could be derailed by second-seeded UC Irvine or third
seeded Arizona (30-24-1).
The Pac-10 is well represented in this year's field with five
teams selected. In addition to Stanford and Arizona, Ari
zona State (40-16) earned the No. 7 national seed, but be
cause the Sun Devils did not bid to host a Regional, they
must travel to second-seeded Cal State Fullerton and get by
Minnesota and Pepperdine to advance.
Washington garnered a No. 2 seed and will make its
third straight postseason appearance in the Mississippi
Regional. —
UCLA, which came on strong toward the end of the sea
son, earned a No. 3 seed in the Oklahoma City Regional.
The Bruins are making their first tournament appearance
since 2000.
"I think West coast baseball is really underrated," Mar
quess said. "I think where we're really underestimated is
how well west coast teams do in the tournament and what
they do in the World Series."
Marquess probably hopes at least his own team proves
him right starting this weekend.
