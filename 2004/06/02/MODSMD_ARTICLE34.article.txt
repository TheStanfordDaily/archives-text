# Card takes Pac-10 against ASU
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Stanford finished off one of its best regular
seasons in school history by returning to the
winning formula that carried it for much of the
year: clutch hitting and effective pitching.
Stanford took two-of-three from red-hot
Arizona State over the weekend to claim the
Pacific-10 Conference crown outright for
the second consecutive year and the 20th
time overall.
The Cardinal finished the regular season
with 44 victories, tying it for the second-highest
total in school history behind the 1990 squad
(52 wins in 63 games).
"We had a phenomenal season," said
Stanford manager Mark Marquess. "To
win as many games as we did with the
schedule we played and to win the confer
ence with all the parity this year was quite
an accomplishment."
By virtue of winning the conference, Stan
ford (44-12, 16-8 Pac-10), which moved back
into the top spot in this week's Baseball Amer
ica poll, received an automatic bid to the post
season and will host a regional beginning Fri
day when the Cardinal plays UNLV at 6 p.m.
And Stanford certainly showed why it was
awarded one of eight national seeds by dis
patching of the Sun Devils, who had won 11 of
their last 12 games entering the series. Arizona
State led the conference in hitting (.331) and
was second in runs (436) before the weekend
but had only three runs and nine hits combined
in the first two games of the series.
Stanford won Friday, 5-0, and Saturday, 10-
3, before falling, 15-5, Sunday for only its third
home loss of the year.
In the series opener, Mark Romanczuk
had one of his best performances of the year,
throwing seven shutout innings and allowing
only two hits while striking out five. He kept
the Arizona State hitters off balance with a
crippling breaking ball that he located with
deadly accuracy.
Romanczuk faced the minimum number of
batters in four of his seven innings of work and
never allowed a runner as far as third base. Sun
Devil runners reached as far as second base
only in the second and fifth innings.
"It was the best I've ever seen Mark throw,"
fellow pitcher Jeff Gilmore said.

Romanczuk was named Pac-10 pitcher of
the week yesterday for his efforts.
David O'Hagan pitched two perfect innings
to finish off Stanford's second shutout of the
season. It was only the second time in 555
games the Sun Devils had been shut out, dating
back to 1995.
Romanczuk got all the run support he need
ed when Danny Putnam slammed his second
career grand slam to left field in the first inning.
"All year I've tried looking for balls up in
the zone that I could drive, but I'd end up
swinging at balls out of the strike zone," Put
nam said. "Last weekend I adjusted and start
ing looking down more in the zone."
Stanford also added a run when first base
man John Mayberry Jr. singled through the
hole to score Jonny Ash from third.
"This is the most potent offense I've ever
pitched in front of," Romanczuk said.
Saturday was more of the same as
Gilmore pitched seven innings, allowing only
three runs on six hits with six strikeouts, and
Stanford hit three home runs and scored nine
runs with two outs.
Chris Minaker and Jonny Ash each hit two
run homers in the second inning as the Cardinal
chased Sun Devils ace Jason Urquidez after
only two-plus innings. Minaker's blast rico
cheted off the top of the scoreboard in left-cen
ter field.
Mayberry added a towering three-run
homer in the fourth that cleared the trees be
yond the left-field fence.
Brian Hall had three hits and Putnam had
two hits to extend his hitting streak to 15 games
— although it would be snapped the next day.
But the key again was the starting pitching
Marquess received from his No. 2 starter,
Gilmore, who has won his last three decisions
and seems to be finding his groove as the post
season approaches.
"The last two weeks, my knuckle-curve has
been great," Gilmore said. "It's helped my
other pitches become more effective."
Sunday marked the final home game for se
niors Ash, Drew Ehrlich, Sam Fuld, Hall and
O'Hagan, but that didn't seem to lie enough
motivation for the Cardinal.
Stanford committed four errors, two crucial
base-running mistakes and left 17 men on base.
The most glaring miscues came via pitcher
Greg Reynolds, who in consecutive batters

twice faked to third, looked to first, had the
runner picked off and subsequently threw the
ball past Mayberry Jr., leading to a run scor
ing each time.
The Cardinal also squashed its own rally in
the fifth when both John Hester and Minaker
were called out for runner's interference.
Stanford used seven pitchers, but only one
was remotely effective. That was freshman
lefty Blake Holler, who threw two perfect in
nings in relief and struck out the side in the fifth.
The other pitchers, including Reynolds,
Matt Leva, Mark Jecmen, Pete Duda and Matt
Manship, combined to give up 13 earned runs
and 14 hits in seven innings.
Holler, then, tried to make his case for see
ing some time in the postseason.
"I knew the coaches were going to keep me
on a low pitch count, so I just tried to do the best
I could," he said. "Sometimes I'm in a zone
where I feel like if I just throw the ball, it will go
exactly where I want it to go."
Fuld had two hits, including a fourth-in
ning blast to right field, to pull within 15 of
all-time Stanford and Pac-10 hits leader
John Gall (368).
The five finalists for the Golden Spikes
Award — the collegiate baseball player of the
year — were named Friday, but Stanford's Jed
Lowrie was not among them.
Three pitchers — Houston Street
(Texas), Jered Weaver (Long Beach State)
and Wade Townsend (Rice) — as well as
two-way player Stephen Head (Mississippi)
and shortstop Dustin Pedroia (Arizona
State) made the cut.
It wasn't a matter of picking players
by seniority.
Of the five, three were juniors and two
sophomores.
"You can't concentrate on that," Lowrie
said. "We just want to get back to Omaha."
Lowrie is hitting .407 and leads his team in
home runs (16), RBIs (66), total bases (163),
slugging percentage (.755) and on-base per
centage (.513). He is trying to become only the
seventh Cardinal player in team history to fin
ish the season above .400. Former catcher Ryan
Garko last accomplished the feat with a .402 av
erage last year.
The sophomore second baseman, though,
was named a first-team Ail-American by
Sports Weekly.
