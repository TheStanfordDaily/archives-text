### 
Automatic berth
Conference: Pacific-10
Record: (44-12,17-9,lst)
Last 10:6-4
Head Coach: Mark Marquess (28th season)
Tournament History: 25th appearance; 113-54
Last Appearance: 2003
Record vs. 2004 Field: 11-7
Ace Up Their Sleeve:
MARK ROMANCZUK (11-2, 4.03 ERA)
The sophomore lefty is 23-4 in his two years on the Farm after a
strong season as the Cardinal's No. 1 starter. Romanczuk leads Stan
ford in innings pitched (105.0) and pitched seven innings of shutout
ball in his last outing, a 5-0 win over Arizona State that clinched at
least a share of the Pac-10 title.

Best Bat:
JED LOWRIE (.407, 16 HR, 66 RBI)

After batting .292 with 28 RBI and nary a home run as a freshman last year, Lowrie shattered
his career-highs in every offensive category this season and set the bar high for however many
more years he plans to stay with the Cardinal. His .755 slugging percentage is among the best in
the nation and his on-base percentage .513 leads the team. Lowrie nit .260 with five RBI in 13 post
season games as a freshman and should have no problem topping those numbers as well.
Scouting Stanford:
A young pitching staff was Stanford's biggest concern heading into the season and those
concerns were justified as several freshman hurlers have endured roller-coaster seasons.
Sophomore Jefr Gilmore (9-2, 4.56 ERA) emerged as a reliable No. 2 starter behind Ro
manczuk but the No. 3 spot remains a question mark. Senior David O'Hagan (6-1,2.62 ERA)
anchors a bullpen that seems to have returned to form after a late season slump. The Cardi
nal offense remains one of the best in the nation. The team is batting .327, has blasted 89 home
runs and is averaging 8.5 runs per game. Six regulars are hitting over .300. The Cardinal's un
rivaled postseason experience ana senior leadership of Jonny Ash, Sam Fuld, Brian Hall and
O'Hagan cannot be overlooked.
