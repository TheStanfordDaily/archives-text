Ace Up Their Sleeve:
JERED WEAVER (14-1,1.68 ERA)
Weaver's 411 strikeouts and 36 wins already rank No. 1 all-time
in school history and he will pass Andy Croghan as the school's all
time leader in innings pitched if he can record two outs this week
end. Odds are that he will retire quite a few more and pad his other
record totals as well. Weaver has twice struck out the first 10 batters
of a game and has been named National Pitcher of the Week six
times this season. He's a sure fire first-round pick in next week's
MLB draft.

Best Bat:
JASON VARGAS (.368,5 HR, 32 RBI) /ccn^.
Vargas leads the club in runs scored (49), hits (68) and slugging percentage (.551). The junior
designated hitter is one of few threats in the Long Beach lineup to eo deep, but his biggest asset is
his ability to get on base. He paces the club in on-base percentage (.485)with a team-high 37 walks.
Vargas also doubles as the 49ers' No. 3 starter. He is 7-6 with a 4.25 ERA in 97.1 innings of work
this season.
SC P?tching anf defense is the name of the game for the 49ers. Long Beach batted a mediocre .300 as a
team with only 29 home runs during the regular season but its team ERA (3.09) and fielding percent
age ( 977) rank among the best in the nation. With Weaver and sophomore lefthander Cesar Ramos
(10-4 2 10 ERA) Long Beach boasts the best 1-2 punch in the Regional. Junior reliever Neil Jamison
(12 saves 3 42 ERA) was dominant throughout most of the season before getting shelled by Miami for
five runs in the ninth inning in his last outing. In addition to Vargas, Long Beach has five regulars hit
ting over 300 The 49ers aren't a serious threat on the basepaths, swiping just 37 bases in 65 attempts.
