# (3) ST. JOHN'S RED STORM
## 
### 
At-large berth
Conference: Big East
Record: (36-21,17-9, T-2nd)
Last 10:6-4
Head Coach: Ed Blankmeyer (Bth season)
Tournament History: 28th appearance; 51-48
Last Appearance: 1997
Recora vs. 2004 Field: 4-6
Ace Up Their Sleeve:
ANTHONY VARVARO (8-3, 3.80 ERA)
Coming off an average sophomore season in which he went 4-6
with a 4.83 ERA, Varvaro established himself as one of the best pitch
ers in the Big East this season. His eight wins were fourth most in the
conference and his 7.70 strikeouts per game ranked among the con
ference leaders as well. Varvaro shut down Pittsburgh in his last reg
ular season outing, limiting the Panthers to two runs on three hits and
striking out 10 in eight innings of work.

Best Bat:
BLAKE HERSHELMAN (.323,10 HR, 48 RBI)
Hershelman provides the pop in an otherwise light-hitting Red Storm lineup, leading St.
John's in home runs, RBI, doubles (16) and slugging percentage (.552). The junior outfielder is
one of the best power hitters in the conference and could do some damage in his usual cleanup
spot this weekend.
Scouting St. John's:
The Red Storm finished fourth in the Big East in batting (.308) but much like Long Beach, the strength
of head coach Ed Blankmeyer's squad is pitching. The team's 3.88 ERA was second in the conference and
Red Storm boasts four hurlers with at least 14 appearances with sub-3.00 ERAs. Varvaro and senior Joe
Reid (6-5,5.38 ERA) form a solid pair of starters and the bullpen Is deep and talented. The relief corps
has also been busy this season, as neither of those two starters nas averaged much more than five innings
per appearance. The Red Storm does not hit fora lot of power (37 home runs) but Blankmeyer is not
afraia to give the green light to anyone. St. John's has 80 stolen bases in 116 attempts and five players have
at least seven steals. Senior shortstop Mike Rozema has been successful in 22 of 25 attempts.
