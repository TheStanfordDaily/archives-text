# (4) UNLV REBELS
## 
### 
Automatic berth
Conference: Mountain West
Record: (37-22,20-10, T-2nd)
Last 10:7-3
Head Coach: Buddy Gouldsmith (Ist season)
Tournament History: 9th Appearance; 9-16
Last Appearance: 2003
Ace Up Their Sleeve:
MATTLUCA (7-5, 5.99 ERA)
While his record and ERA are not exactly ace-like, Luca has been
masterful in his last two outings. He pitched a complete game and
struck out 11 in the Rebels' 6-3 win over San Diego State in the
MWC Tournament Championship. One week earlier, he gave up just
three runs on eight hits in eight innings of work against New Mexico.
Luca is in a groove at the right time.

Best Bat:
ERIC NIELSEN (.410,16 HR, 86 RBI)
Nielsen's monster season makes last year's totals (.365,7 HR, 41 RBI) look pretty shabby. The
senior right fielder led the Mountain West Conference in home runs, RBI, on-base percentage
(.512), slugging percentage (.717) and runs scored (82) among either categories. In addition tc> his
impressive offensive numbers, Nielsen is one of the best defensive outfielders in the nation with a
.975 fielding percentage and eight assists.
Scouting UNLV:
UNLV gives the Cardinal a run for its money as the most dangerous hitting teams at
Sunken Diamond this weekend. The Rebels led the high altitude, ofiense-inflatecTMountain
West Conference in batting average (.338) and averaged 10.1 runs per game. Paced by
Nielsen, UNLV blasted 73 home runs. Peter White (9 HR, 56 RBI), Eddie Gill (7 HR, 59
RBI) and Brent Johnson (6 HR, 72 RBI) are all cogs in the loaded Rebel lineup. UNLV's
pitching, on the other hand, leaves something to be desired, although the team's 6.08 ERA is
above average for the conference. On the mound, senior left hanaer Jake Vose is not your
typical 10-game winner, as he has given up 128 hits and 10 home runs in just over 100 innings
of work and opponents are hitting .305 against him.
