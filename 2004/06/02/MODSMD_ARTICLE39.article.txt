## 
### ERIC ELDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The family and friends of alum
nus Frederico Bloch Marias, Class of
'75, are celebrating his life through a
new scholarship fund allowing Latin
American students to come to Stan
ford. An open service will be held at
Memorial Chruch next week.
Bloch, a successful businessman
and the former CEO of Taca
Group, an El Salvador-based air
line, was murdered in the early
morning of April 26 in San Sal
vador, El Salvador during what au
thorities believe to have been a
failed kidnapping attempt.
Arriving at Stanford in 1971,
Bloch took off with his passion for
airplanes and business: While a
freshman, he convinced a profes
sor in the Graduate School of Busi
ness to let him into a class on air
line management.
He graduated in 1975 with bach

elor's and master's degrees in indus
trial engineering and shortly after
ward attended Harvard Business
School, where he graduated in 1979.
From that point until when he re
tired this year — only several days
before his death — Bloch helped
build Taca from a three-plane enter
prise to the largest airline in Central
America and the third-largest in
Latin America.
"[Bloch's] dream was to inte
grate the region," said David
Bloch, his younger son and a cur
rent Stanford senior. "The five
Central American countries
would end up hurting themselves
if they competed against each
other, and that if they worked to
gether for economic success, then
they would succeed."
Between 1989 and 1992, Bloch
led the purchases of the four other
nation-based airlines in Central
America, incorporating them offi
cially under the Taca Group in 1995.

"Another big goal of his was to
develop El Salvador as a technology
hub of Central America," said his
older son, Eric Bloch, also a senior
at Stanford. "He used the mainte
nance base of Taca in the country as
a starting point for this, to bring to
gether the personnel and materials
necessary for hi-tech work. Several
other airlines now base their main
tenance facilities there as well."
Bloch was a leader in El Salvador
and the region beyond his involve
ment with Taca. In the late 1980s
and early 1990s, he helped negotiate
the peace agreement between the
government and revolutionary army
that ended the 12-year Salvadoran
civil war. With his wife, Jacqueline
Laffite Bloch, he founded a chil
dren's museum in San Salvador
For his leadership efforts in busi
ness and beyond, Bloch gained sev
eral prestigious awards during his
lifetime, and another posthumously:
the Orden Nacional Jose Matias

Delgado, the highest honor for a
civilian to earn in El Salvador.
"[He] was a pioneer in serving
the expatriate Salvadoran com
munity," said Maria Eugenia
Brizuela de Avila, El Salvador's
current secretary of state, while
presenting his latest award, ac
cording to the Salvadoran news
paper El Diario de Hoy.
Under Bloch's leadership, Taca
has come to serve 10 American
cities and is one of the main links be
tween the six million Salvadorans in
El Salvador and the estimated two
million in the United States.
An open memorial service for
Bloch will be held at Memorial
Church on Thursday, June 10 at 4
p.m. The Federico Bloch Memorial
Scholarship has recently been
started by several friends of his in
the airline industry to bring more
students from Latin America to
Stanford, and the family has asked
that gifts be made to the scholar-
