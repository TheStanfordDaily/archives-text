# BSU illegally funded Husbands/Schwartz
## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
The Black Student Union (BSU)
gave special-fees funds to junior
Ajani Husbands and sophomore
Alyssa Schwartz for their ASSU ex
ecutive campaign, in violation of the
ASSU's Joint By-Laws.
"We received $200 from the
BSU," Schwartz acknowledged.
According to both Husbands and
Schwartz, the NAACP also planned
to reimburse them for campaign ex
penses. NAACP Treasurer Marcus
Williams, a senior, refused to com
ment on the matter when contacted
by The Daily.
The Husbands / Schwartz slate,
along with the other slates in the first
executive election, failed to file cam
paign-finance reports at the end of
the campaign process as required by
the Campaign Practice Code.
Copies of receipts and a check re
quest form, obtained from the
ASSU financial offices by The
Daily, show that Schwartz was reim
bursed for $189.58 by the BSU for
purchases made at Kinko's, Wal
green's and Home Depot for flyer
ing supplies and a banner.
"Since Ajani is closely tied with
this group, we asked them for assis
tance," Schwartz said.
Husbands confirmed that his
campaign accepted money from the
BSU, but continued that this was
not the first time a student group
had given special-fees funds to a
candidate. In the past, he said, can
didates endorsed by the Students of
Color Coalition "have gone to
groups for fundraising."
"This is not out of the blue,"
added Husbands, who is a member
and former program coordinator
with the BSU.
Schwartz agreed, stating that
she was led to believe that this prac
tice was not new.
"I didn't want to take money

from groups since it's student
money and they shouldn't be paying
for ASSU campaigns, but we were
under the impression that SOCC
VSOs had been paying for cam
paigns for years," she said.
Schwartz added that previous
ASSU presidents had suggested

that she and Husbands
accept money from
student groups.
"[Former ASSU
President] Matt Brew
er said to fundraise;
[former ASSU Presi
dent] Nadiya Figueroa
said to fundraise," she
continued, adding that
she wasn't certain if
Figueroa recommend
ed asking groups for
additional money.
According to
Schwartz, legal consid
erations did not factor
into the discussion.
"No one seemed
concerned about the
ethics of it," she said.
Figueroa admitted
advising Husbands
and Schwartz to raise
money, but denied
recommending that
they seek out finan
cial support from
student groups.
"No, that's not
something that we had
ever done," she said.
BSU financial offi
cer Daniel Stringer, a
sophomore, said he

was unaware that his group's dona
tion was not allowed.
"We gave them money to help
with their campaign," said Stringer,
who is also a senator and chair of the
Appropriations Committee, a body
that deals with special-fees issues.
"I'm pretty sure that it is legal, be
cause if it wasn't, I wouldn't have

signed off on it."
BSU Co-Chair Jasmine Smith, a
junior, however, acknowledged that
her organization had made a mistake.
"We weren't aware that it was il
legal," she said.
According to several past and
present senators, such a donation

from a group's special-fees funds is
banned by the ASSU Joint By-Laws.
"Students vote fora group's
budget to support that group," said
former Senate Chair Josh Shipp, a
junior. "This was probably not an
appropriate use of funds."
He pointed to Article VI, Section
7, Subsection A, Clause 14 of the Joint

By-Laws regarding general and spe
cial fees, which states that, "Any stu
dent organization receiving a Special
Fee ... shall be required to expend all
funds of that organization in accor
dance with its budget as authorized by
the members of the Association."
The BSU did not include dona-

tions to executive election candi
dates in the itemization of its 2003-
2004 special-fees budget.
Current Senate Chair Chris Lin, a
junior, also objected to the donation.
"The big problem is this implic
it idea that donating funds from
