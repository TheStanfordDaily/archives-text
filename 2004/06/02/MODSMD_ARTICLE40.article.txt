# Texts to be available online
## 
### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Starting in August, students
everywhere may be able to bypass
books altogether and opt to get
their texts digitally. Pearson Educa
tion, a major publishing company,
will be offering hundreds of titles
online. This service is being offered
through SafariX Textbooks Online,
a joint venture between Pearson
Technology Group and O'Reilly
Media, Inc., a technical books pub
lisher for IT professionals.
According to Wendy Spiegel, Pear
son's senior vice president of commu
nications, the service was developed to
address increased textbook prices as
well as to incorporate digital technolo
gy in teaching. Spiegel noted that
Pearson strives to address the teaching
requirements of faculty and the indi
vidual learning needs of students.
"Pearson is committed to offering
choice and value to help enhance the
education process," Spiegel said.
"SafariX is a breakthrough product,
opening a new pathway for us to
communicate directly with students,
offering them the choice and value
they've asked for regarding the pur
chase of textbooks."

These digital books are advertised
to save students up to 50 percent over
printed editions of the same books.
According to the College Board, a
student at a private four-year college
will spend about $807 each year on
books and supplies.
Students will be able to search for
textbooks by author, title or ISBN
and purchase subscriptions online.
They will then be able to log in with
a subscription access code and view
the books from any computer con
nected to the Internet. The books
will have content identical to the
published editions.
Pearson includes titles from a
range of brands, including Addison-
Wesley, Allyn & Bacon, Benjamin
Cummings, Longman and Prentice
Hall. These publishers cover subjects
ranging from economics to physiolo
gy and anatomy.
So far, Pearson is the only company
to offer this service.
According to Spiegel, SafariX also
plans to offer subscriptions to these
digital textbooks through campus
bookstores that join the SafariX Affil
iate Program. Through this program,
college bookstores will earn back a
percentage of the student sales.
Follet Higher Education Group,

which runs the Stanford Bookstore,
does not have any plans to join the af
filiate program. Cliff Ewert, vice
president of public and campus rela
tions emphasized the benefits of a
large selection of used books in order
to reduce expenses.
"Used texts books may be a better
buy than online books especially if
you want to retain them for your li
brary," Ewert said. "Hardbound
books will be more durable than print
ed sheets, and you will be able to use
the book more conveniently by not re
lying on a computer for information."
Ewert noted that campus book
stores also buy back books from stu
dents at 50 percent of the purchase
price at the end of each quarter.
Students aware of this develop
ment expressed varied reactions.
"The prices at the Bookstore are
really expensive, so it would be great
to have other options to look at," said
freshman Chris Nguyen.
Freshman Jon Chang said he
would probably not use the service.
"Although online texts would be
less expensive, I would probably
just order a hardcopy of the books
from other online sources, which
are still much cheaper than the
Bookstore," he said.
