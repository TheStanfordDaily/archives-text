### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
This year's ASSU Teaching Award was given to
human biology Prof. Stan Wanat. The recipient of the
award is chosen annually by a panel of undergraduate
senators from the ASSU.
"The award aims to recognize outstanding teach
ing, and Stan makes that his number one priority,"
said Wanat's former student Jeff Churchill, Class of
'03."He is among the most accessible members of
the faculty at Stanford. He'll meet with you day or

night and even on weekends to
discuss both academics and
other topics."
Wanat said that he was deeply
honored to receive the award,
calling it a "privilege and honor"
to work with Stanford students.
"They are amazing, wonderful
people — extraordinarily accom
plished, bright, dedicated and as
tonishingly multi-talented,"
Wanat said. "I consider it a spe
cial blessing to me that my stu
dents give me the opportunity to
share in some very small way in
their journey of academic and
personal accomplishment."
Wanat's students overwhelm
ingly praised how he went "above
and beyond" the requirements of
his job with his enthusiasm and
continuing support.
"There are some teachers and
mentors who 1 have held in high
esteem in the past. But not one ri-

vals Stanley Wanat," said junior
Valerie Rozycki. "I would like to say that he has raised
the bar of my expectations fora good teacher, but I
doubt that there are many people at all who could meet
those expectations."
Several of Rozycki's classmates echoed her sentiments.
"Stan redefines what it means to be beyond the
call of duty," said senior David Roeske. "He
pours every ounce of his energy and every spare
moment of his time into finding new ways to help
his students succeed."
Wanat was also praised for his accessibility and at
tentiveness to students' needs. Junior Alex Bradford,
one of the students who nominated Wanat for the
award, noted that for this past year's course evalua
tions, Wanat has average a perfect 5.0/5.0 on the
scales of concern, inspiration and availability.
"At the end of literally every class session, Stan
would ask, 'What else can I be doing for any of you?'
and he meant what he said with full sincerity," Brad
ford said. "He was always willing to help a student, to
meet with them outside of class, to find creative ways
of teaching students, to evolve his teaching methods

based on students' strengths and weaknesses."
"Wanat stands heads and shoulders above the
best professors I have encountered in my educa
tional career," Roeske said. "Instead of merely an
advisor, Stan can only be described as a student ad
vocate. I was shocked to find an advisor here at
Stanford who cared so sincerely and who worked so
hard for his students."
Several students also said that they found Wanat
as a source of inspiration due to his dedication to
teaching and advising. This year alone, Wanat
worked closely with 39 students, helping them cre-

ate, carry out and ultimately
write research projects. He also
coordinated service opportuni
ties for 47 students.
"He has inspired me; he has
taught me that there are selfless
individuals out there," said senior
Dorothy Louis. "Oftentimes, I get
the sense that Stanford faculty
members are apathetic and only
care about getting tenure. It is
quite surprising to see a faculty
member at Stanford who actually
wants to teach —an individual
who realizes that the point of be
coming a professor is to teach stu
dents." V
"[Wanat] is incredibly available
and makes sure to keep contact
with you throughout the research
process," said senior Nic Kanaan,
one of the students Wanat ad
vised this year. "Stan has guided
me through an honor's thesis,
which very well could have been

doomed from the start had I not
had his help and guidance."
Administrators have also praised the work Wanat
has done with his students.
He also works closely with various student groups
on campus, including the Stanford Catholic Commu
nity and Hillel at Stanford, serving as a member of
their advisory boards.
In addition to helping students with their work,
Wanat also conducts research himself, most re
cently publishing a paper on the mental health,
drinking and drug use among employees in highly
educated workforces.
In 2003, Wanat received the Human Biology Ex
cellence in Faculty Advising Award. He has served
on the Stanford Rhodes-Marshall Panel and as a se
lector for the Bill and Melinda Gates Millenium
Scholar Program which selects students of color to
receive four-year scholarships to universities and col
leges throughout the country.
The ASSU will be hosting a reception today honor
ing Wanat from noon to 1 p.m. in the Oak West Lounge
on the second floor of Tresidder.
