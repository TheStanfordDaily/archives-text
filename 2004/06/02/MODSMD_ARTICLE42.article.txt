# Students petition for Ujamaa RA
## 
### KATIE BEARMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Since May 27, over 130 people
have signed a petition to allow junior
Michael Brown II to be a resident as
sistant (RA) next year in Ujamaa, al
though he will not be able to attend
the RA training in September
deemed mandatory by the Office of
Residential Education (Res Ed).
"While the petition is targeted at
the Black and Uj community, anyone
can sign it," said senior Kevin Dious.
Brown said that before the RA
application process, he knew that
he would have to miss RA training
due to his participation in the Stan
ford South Africa Overseas Semi
nar this summer. Still, he decided to
apply for the position.
According to Brown, he was
"clear about the situation with the
Ujamaa Resident Fellows (RFs)
from the get-go."
Despite the fact that he would
have to miss training, the RFs listed
Brown as their first choice.
"He was interested in participat
ing in a program in South Africa
that would preclude him from
going to RA training," acknowl
edged Ujamaa RF Peter Henry.
"We [Henry and his wife, fellow RF
Lisa Nelson] said that we didn't
know whether he'd be able to do
both of those things and that ulti
mately it was Residential Educa
tion's decision as to whether his
plan was feasible or not."

Many claimed that Brown is an
ideal candidate for the position.
"Brown is the most involved stu
dent in the black community," said
junior Ajani Husbands. "He has held
a vested interest in the black commu
nity since day one and has used that
interest to be a leading figure."
Brown has worked in the Admis
sion Office, the Elections Commis
sion, the Black Community Service
Center, the Black Student Union
and, during the 2002-2003 school
year, he served as the Ujamaa ethnic
theme associate. Additionally, he has
served as an ASSU senator.
"He has worked to increase the
welfare of the black community to its
greatest potential with each one of
his leadership roles," Husbands said.
Husbands said that it is impor
tant for Ujamaa to have staff mem
bers like Brown "that hold our best
interests at hand.
"Ujamaa is a special place for the
black community," he added. "Not
only does it provide a safe forum for
discussions on race and culturally
specific programming, but it is also a
monument of achievement for the
black community."
Husbands said that Res Ed's poli
cy preventing RAs from missing
training is overly restrictive.
"The petition may not influence
Res Ed to immediately change its de
cision, but the hope is that Res Ed
will realize that talented and highly
qualified RAs like Michael Brown
are being disenfranchised from be

coming RAs because there is no flex
ibility in the system," he said.
Brown said he is disappointed
that he may not be allowed to fill the
RA position next year. He added
that he would be a good RAin Uja
maa because he "loves UJ and there
are things that you just can't teach in
training about being an RAin an
ethnic theme dorm."
After working as an Ujamaa
ETA, Brown said that he has learned
the secrets to Ujamaa staff success.
Still, Husbands and Dious, not
Brown, put the petition into circula
tion. Brown said he is flattered that
there are so many students support
ing him, hut that he fully under
stands Res Ed's decision.
"Their policy is clear," Brown said.
Res Ed could not be reached for
comment, but its staff documents ex
plicitly state that "RAs are required
to attend and participate in all of the
RA training and staff retreats."
Training is instrumental to an
RA's ability to carry out his immense
amount of responsibilities, according
to the Res Ed Web site. These respon
sibilities include "leadership, support
ing the academic mission, building
community, promoting intellectual
life, personal counseling / advising,
administrative responsibilities, moni
toring their personal conduct and
building team skills."
Brown also said he believes that
Res Ed at Stanford is superior to sim
ilar committees at other universities.
"Res Ed at Stanford puts a lot

of thought and time into what they
do," he said. "They care about
programming and actual residen
tial education, not just sticking
people in dorms,"
Henry said that he and Nelson
supported Brown's decision to go
to South Africa.
"We told him that if he needed
to choose between the two, and he
chose to go to South Africa, we'd
support that because we under
stood how important the South
Africa program was to him," Henry
said. "He's made a lot of sacrifices
and contributed a lot to the Stan
ford community, particularly the
black community. The students are
expressing their gratitude for what
he's done for the community ... I
just think it's a difficult situation
where we have a supremely talent
ed individual who's got two great
options before him and it's not pos
sible to do both."
Henry added that the Ujamaa
RFs had found a replacement for
Brown's RA position.
Brown said that if the petition
had an effect and if he could be an
RAin Ujamaa next year, he would
"do it in a minute."
He added, "Whether or not the
RA ends up being me, my major
hope is that Res Ed will fill the po
sition with anyone who will be a
good RAin Uj."
