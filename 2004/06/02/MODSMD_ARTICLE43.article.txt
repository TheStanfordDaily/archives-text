# Free clinic celebrates first anniversary
## 
### JESSICA BOROWICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Pacific Free Clinic celebrated
its one-year anniversary in May, near
ly six years after a group of Stanford
medical students committed them
selves to providing free medical care
in San Jose. The clinic created by their
efforts now operates every Saturday
and accepts all patients regardless of
immigration status, language or med
ical insurance. The Pacific Free Clinic
has served over 500 patients in its first
year and now treats more than 20 pa
tients each week.
The clinic was originally modeled
after the Arbor Free Clinic in Menlo
Park, which was founded in 1990 and is
also operated by Stanford students.
"Even though this was a hu
mungous project I thought it was pos
sible because we already had a
model," said David Wang, one of the
clinic's first managers. "It is really
worthwhile and will have a long-term

impact."
Since its inception, the Pacific
Free Clinic has focused on providing
specialized language services for its
mostly Spanish and Vietnamese
speaking patients.
"We've had people come all the
way from Stockton and Berkeley,"
said clinic co-manager Lyen Huang,
a second-year medical student.
"They're not just coming because of
the free care, but also because the
language services make them feel
more comfortable."
In addition to screening for hepati
tis Band C, the clinic has evolved from
treating acute conditions to also han
dling chronic problems such as hyper
tension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
"A lot of the population has
chronic problems that can cascade
out of control and cost tens of thou
sands of dollars," said Huang, who
also serves as the clinic's chair of
chronic care. "But it is possible to pre
vent and take care of these."

According to its mission statement,
another of the clinic's goals is "to pro
vide students an opportunity to gain
experience in community and cultur
ally competent medicine and to learn
about the challenges of practicing with
a minority patient population."
"The clinic is useful for students
as well," Wang said. "Especially if
someone wants to work in Califor
nia, they must be tuned into the im
migrant needs and issues. Working
at the clinic gives Stanford students
training and experience, and they
come out more able to work with
minority populations."
Organizers said that the Pacific
Free Clinic is always looking for vol
unteers to help with screenings at
community festivals, and it has a need
for students fluent in Spanish and
Asian languages. Beyond interpret
ing, the clinic offers opportunities for
both undergraduate and graduate
students to participate in patient care,
be patient advocates, conduct inter

views and prepare charts to present to
the physicians.
Looking ahead, Wang said, "The
clinic would like to improve upon
training volunteers outside of the clin
ic... and shorten wait times."
In the long term, Wang said the
clinic will focus on providing "more
comprehensive service, trying to bring
in specialty care. The first thing should
be an Ob-Gyn." Wang also said that
he wants to see the clinic become
"more established in lots of ways. For
example, incorporating it into the
Stanford curriculum and have people
go to the clinic as part of their class."
Finally, both Wang and Huang
stress the need to make the clinic more
community-based.
"The clinic should talk to commu
nity leaders, constantly looking at the
services needed and tiying to fulfill
those needs," Wang said. "The clinic
should establish relationships and
have full channels of communication
and feedback."
