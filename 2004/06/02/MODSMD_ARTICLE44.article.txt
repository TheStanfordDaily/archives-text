# Advising changes embraced by students

### ALIYYA HAQUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The recent announcement of broad changes to the undergraduate advis
ing system — aimed specifically at pre-major advising — has received gen
erally favorable responses from Stanford students.
Many students have criticized the current advising system — in which
only about 12 to 15 percent of freshman advisers are faculty members — for
the lack of student-adviser interaction.
Freshman Trishla Jain said that although she was unhappy with her own
advising experience, the new advising changes would greatly benefit the in
coming Class of 2008.
"I never really saw my advisers, and as a freshman, I felt totally lost in the
bureaucracy and caught in too much red tape," Jain said. "I just want some
one who I can go and talk to when the need arises. But I think the adminis
tration is moving in the right direction by looking more closely into the needs
of the students and matching them more carefully with advisers."
Some of the other modifications to the advising system include the re
cruitment of more faculty as advisers, the expanded involvement of the Of
fice of Freshman and Transfer Students in pre-major advising, the renaming
of the Undergraduate Advising Center as Undergraduate Advising Pro
grams and the creation of an academic director. This new staff position
would be full-time and centered in Wilbur Hall, home to approximately 25
percent of each year's freshman class.
Many of the changes come as a direct result of the work of Faculty Direc
tor of Undergraduate Advising Steve Zipperstein and his staff. Zipperstein
said thai during his first year in the position, he has had the opportunity to
look at the full scope of advising at Stanford, specifically focusing on pre
major advising in an effort to see what should be improved.
Zipperstein noted that he has worked very closely with many mem
bers of the administration, especially Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman and Potter College Director Carol Porter, on
improving the advising system.
"We decided to focus our attention primarily on pre-major advising and
the freshman experience," Zipperstein said. "We looked very closely at stu
dent feedback and also at a number of peer institutions, who have been suc
cessful in their academic advising, specifically Penn, Wellesley and Harvard.
We spoke to the people responsible for these programs and tried to borrow
whatever seemed useful to improve Stanford's own advising program."
A major problem faced by the administration has been the recruitment
of faculty advisers. In an effort to raise faculty involvement, a series of in
centives have been provided, including the elimination of the obligatory and
sometimes awkward social gatherings between groups of students and ad
visers in favor of increased individual interactions.
Additionally, the pairing of students to their faculty advisers will un
dergo a more extensive and thorough examination courtesy of detailed
student questionnaires, which ask freshmen about themselves and their
academic interests.
Developing a comfortable relationship between student and adviser is
often difficult for incoming freshmen.
"I can't stress enough how rewarding and important it is fora student to
establish a mentoring relationship with an academic adviser," said peer aca
demic adviser T. T. Nguyen, a sophomore. "A freshman who did not under
go the greatest advising experience often gets discouraged. Additionally,
some advisers are not fully informed of the academic programming at Stan
ford and this could potentially be a source of conflict with regards to impart
ing advice to the advisees."
In addition, Nguyen noted that the student-faculty mentoring rela
tionship could be established with someone other than the freshman
academic adviser.
"Given the amazing repertoire of faculty at Stanford, it is possible for
a student to establish a fostering relationship with a professor and find
their academic and intellectual niche no matter how diverse his or her in
terests are," Nguyen said. "Hopefully, the new advising changes will allow
this professor to be the academic adviser."
