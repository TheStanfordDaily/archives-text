# Student organizations gear up for November election

### NANCY WANG STAFF WRITER 
Despite finals and general end
of-the-year turmoil, many on-cam
pus student organizations have al
ready started to strategize and plan
for the November presidential elec
tion. Groups are currently laying
the groundwork for mobilization
this fall to encourage and direct the
increasing political awareness they
perceive on campus.
Many perceive that general stu
dent interest in the upcoming pres
idential election is greater than in
past elections.
"Students are very interested in
the upcoming election â€” this is evi
dent from talking to students and
from the positive reaction to various
panels and political events on cam
pus," said Stanford Students for
Kerry member Mattie Hutton, a ju

nior. "The Florida debacle of 2000.
the war in Iraq, a struggling economy
and appalling environmental poli
cies have gotten many students inter
ested in this election."
Student groups have begun to
gear up for the election with ac
tivities aimed toward increasing
voter registration and informing
voters of the issues pertinent to
the election.
The Stanford Democrats, for ex
ample, are working on and off cam
pus to mobilize voters with pro
grams such as a campus network of
hall captains for next fall. The Stan
ford College Republicans also plan
to host activities aimed at register
ing and informing voters.
"The Stanford College Republi
cans are working to register workers,
build our membership and organize
campaigns in order to bring victory
for the president in November," said

College Republican President Bob
Sensenbrenner, a sophomore.
In addition to established on
campus political organizations,
two student groups have emerged
in particular to mobilize for the
elections: Students for Kerry and
Students for Bush.
According to Hutton, Stu
dents for Kerry is working on
and off-campus to provide infor
mation about Kerry and encour
age voter registration.
"Our main job is to provide ac
curate and engaging information
about the Kerry campaign and act
as a clearinghouse of potential
volunteers so that students can
use their time and skills effective
ly," she said.
Students for Bush members also
hope to mobilize students and in
form voters about the two presiden
tial candidates.

"A lot of Stanford students are
very apathetic concerning politics,"
said junior Gary Raichart. "We're
hoping to get out and get people
more involved."
Representatives from both
groups agreed that foreign policy,
national security and the econo
my will be important issues for
the election.
"Bush will try to pin everything
on 9 /11, which is clearly relevant to
evaluating the past years, but really
doesn't explain away his vast fiscal
mismanagement, his weakening of
environmental protections and his
inability to even fund some of his
trophy programs like No Child Left
Behind," Hutton said.
However, Raichart said Stu
dents for Bush hopes to dismiss
common misperceptions of
progress in Iraq and the economy,
which they say are encouraged by

the mainstream media.
"For example, the draft legisla
tion featured in The Daily is
something that's been around for
a year and a half, and it has noth
ing to do with the administra
tion," Raichart said.
"Our goal is to show students at
Stanford that there is a different
side of the story from what they're
hearing from the mainstream
media," added junior Capp Culver.
"Overall, things are looking good
for America."
Sensenbrenner also argued that
in both national security and the
economy. Bush has shown steady
leadership in difficult times.
"The economy is now booming
after Bush overcame the recession
he inherited," he said. "Also, Amer
ica is becoming safer every day be
cause of the strong efforts of the
president and his administration."

Other students voiced strong dis
agreement, however, and main
tained that Bush is taking the coun
try in a dangerous direction, both at
home and abroad.
"Some of the issues that will be
important in the election include
U.S. militarism, damage to Ameri
ca's reputation abroad, exploding
budget deficits, rollbacks in envi
ronmental regulation, cuts to so
cial service spending and rising
economic inequality," said junior
Derek Kilner, member of both the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition
and the Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice.
"Basically, every progressive
group in America has been spending
the last three years responding to
setbacks caused by the Bush admin
istration, so any hope of making real
progress requires getting rid of
Bush," he said.
