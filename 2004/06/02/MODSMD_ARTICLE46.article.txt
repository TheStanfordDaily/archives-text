# Stanford Center on Ethics to host discussion of Iraqi torture
## 
### DAWN CARDON 
The three-month-old Stanford
Center on Ethics will host its first
panel discussion tonight at 7 p.m. in
Room 290 of the Law School. Dis
cussion will focus on the ethics of war
in relation to the recent abuse of
Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers.
Ethics Center Director Lawrence
Qwill said he aimed fora diverse set
of perspectives when assembling the
panel. Panel members include Geoff
Mohan, a Los Angeles Times jour
nalist who covered the recent war in
Iraq; Law Prof. Jenny Martinez, who
is currently working on the team ar
guing for alleged "dirty bomber"
Jose Padilla's right to counsel; and
senior Helen Stacey, who is current
ly working on a project on globaliza
tion and human rights.
Qwill said the Iraqi prisoner
abuse problematized the very no

tion of ethics because of the na
ture of the situation in Iraq. Par
ticularly. the discussion will exam
ine the concept of "situationist
ethics" — the adaptation of a per
son's ethics to the conditions in
which they're placed.
The implications of the Stan
ford Prison Experiment — a 1973
study conducted by Psychology
Prof. Philip Zimbardo — and how
it parallels to the mistreatment of
prisoners of war in Iraq will also
be discussed.
Qwill emphasized that the
panel's purpose is not to come up
with a concrete solution to the prob
lem but rather to explore possible
courses of action.
"The Ethics Center wasn't set up
to provide an answer to an issue or
problem," Qwill said. "However,
hopefully within the discussion, pro
posals will be put forth to prevent

this happening again."
The panel will be the first of
many such events hosted by the
Ethics Center. Future discussions
will center on what Qwill de
scribed as "hot topics that invite
people to think about difficult eth
ical considerations."
He added, "(We plan on] ad
dressing topical issues with an ethi
cal direction from both scholarly re
search and current events."
Qwill said the center's real
life relevance and accessibility
should allow it to expand its re
sources beyond Stanford to the
larger community.
"We hope to draw a large num
ber of people from the communi
ty as well as students from every
discipline by addressing current
events and providing a safe place
to think things through together,"
he said.
