# GCEP directors defend distribution of funds
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Launched in November 2002, Stanford's $225 million Global Climate
and Energy Project (GCEP) has recently drawn criticism regarding the dis
tribution of funding, the topics covered and the decision-making process
that determines who receives research money. Almost a year and a half after
its initiation, some question whether GCEP is living up to expectations.
One prominent concern is the lack of outside institutions and groups
actively involved in the project. All project grants have gone to Stanford
faculty members, several of whom sit on the project's central staff, in
cluding Petroleum Engineering Prof. Lynn Orr and Mechanical Engi
neering Associate Prof. Chris Edwards.
Orr and Edwards — GCEP's project and deputy directors, respec
tively — are principal investigators for studies researching carbon se
questration and advanced combustion. Their projects received $970,000
and $850,000. Of the 10 members of the faculty committee, five received
funding from GCEP.
Although the project's reported mission statement is to pull together top
scientific minds from all over the country to develop renewable energy al
ternatives, potential grant recipients must be solicited. So far, the only re
searchers to be solicited have been Stanford employees.
"The research funding to date has gone exclusively to Stanford facul
ty," said GCEP Managing Director Richard Sassoon. "This is primarily
because the project was still in its initial stages and we did not have the
systems in place to bring on external institutions whereas Stanford facul
ty are covered by the existing contract."
Currently, the project has only submitted one solicitation fora mone
tary award; this award was in the area of hydrogen research. As the 10-
year project develops, directors expect to have two or more solicitations
a year in a variety of disciplines.
According to Sassoon, GCEP leaders are currently trying to unify re
search groups from both Stanford and peer schools. Representatives from
the project have visited and reviewed 19 potential research institutions in
Europe, Japan and the United States, he added. GCEP administrators are
also working on developing a new contract system to allow promising insti
tutions to participate in the project.
"I know that GCEP's leaders are working hard to expand the pool of
grantees to the international scale, and I expect they will do so in the next
few years," said Pamela Matson, dean of the School of Earth Sciences. "The
fact that GCEP's leaders got this very complex project off the ground quick
ly with mostly Stanford grants makes good sense."
When questioned about a possible conflict of interest within the faculty
committee concerning the distribution of funds, Sassoon maintained that
the committee works more to provide feedback and that additional bodies
have been created to govern the project's logistics.
"GCEP has established other committees including an independent ex-
ternal advisory board, a dean's over
sight committee and a sponsor's
management committee to provide
other types of support and guidance
to the project," he said. "The faculty
committee is composed of faculty
from a number of departments who
are deeply interested in energy and
so it is not surprising that some are
involved in GCEP-funded research.
In fact, making sure that we have ad
equate representation from faculty
funded by the project is important to
the functioning of the committee."
Edwards added, "I think some
people are confused about what
the faculty committee actually
does. Since there are only so many
professors focused on energy re
search at Stanford, it's not a big
surprise that some of the faculty on
the advisory committee are also
funded by the project."
The advisory committee con
sists of six non-Stanford-affiliated
members with experience in cli
mate and energy studies, each cho

sen by the management committee
and project directors. The commit
tee convenes once a year to pro
vide advice and feedback on the di
rection of the project, but is not in
volved in selecting which research
proposals receive funding.
Instead, research proposals are
green-lighted by ad hoc technical
review committees formed by the
project directors. These commit
tees earmarked proposals for the
Nov. 13 allocation round which to
taled $5.1 million.
Final decisions regarding the
project are made by the manage
ment committee, which is com
prised of one representative from
each of the project's four sponsors:
Exxon-Mobil, General Electric,
Toyota and Schlumberger. Exxon
contributed $100 million dollars to
the effort, the most of any single
sponsor named in the project's
original contract.
Every year the project leaders se
lect specific topic areas of interest
from a list of 11 subjects outlined in
the GCEP's initial contract. This
year's topics are carbon-free pro
duction of hydrogen from fossil
fuels, wind energy, biomass and car
bon capture and sequestration. Two
concurrent workshops were held on

these subjects in April.
There has been some debate
about whether the selected topics
are the most beneficial to the pro
ject's central goal to develop feasi
ble and effective renewable ener
gy alternatives. Carbon sequestra
tion in particular has been criti
cized as less important than other
potential areas of research.
"We are working our way
through our technical portfolio in
funding projects that cover all as
pects of energy systems," Sassoon
said. "We are following a rational
order in this portfolio beginning
with renewables and hydrogen."
He added that carbon capture
and separation was included as a
workshop topic because of its im
portant role in reducing greenhouse
gas emissions from modern energy
systems. He disagreed with the cri
tiques of the selected areas.
"All these topics are, of course,
extremely relevant to GCEP's mis
sion of conducting fundamental re
search into technologies for energy
use with reduced greenhouse gas
emissions," Sassoon said. "Con
ducting the workshops we held al
lows us to evaluate the technical
barriers and the research opportu
nities in these areas."
