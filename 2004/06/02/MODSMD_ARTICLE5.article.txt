# GCEP directors defend distribution of funds

Launched in November 2002, Stanford's $225 million Global Climate
and Energy Project (GCEP) has recently drawn criticism regarding the dis
tribution of funding, the topics covered and the decision-making process
that determines who receives research money. Almost a year and a half after
its initiation, some question whether GCEP is living up to expectations.
One prominent concern is the lack of outside institutions and groups
actively involved in the project. All project grants have gone to Stanford
faculty members, several of whom sit on the project's central staff, in
cluding Petroleum Engineering Prof. Lynn Orr and Mechanical Engi
neering Associate Prof. Chris Edwards.
Orr and Edwards — GCEP's project and deputy directors, respec
tively — are principal investigators for studies researching carbon se
questration and advanced combustion. Their projects received $970,000
and $850,000. Of the 10 members of the faculty committee, five received
funding from GCEP.
Although the project's reported mission statement is to pull together top
scientific minds from all over the country to develop renewable energy al
ternatives, potential grant recipients must be solicited. So far, the only re
searchers to be solicited have been Stanford employees.
"The research funding to date has gone exclusively to Stanford facul
ty," said GCEP Managing Director Richard Sassoon. "This is primarily
because the project was still in its initial stages and we did not have the
systems in place to bring on external institutions whereas Stanford facul
ty are covered by the existing contract."
Currently, the project has only submitted one solicitation fora mone
tary award; this award was in the area of hydrogen research. As the 10-
year project develops, directors expect to have two or more solicitations
a year in a variety of disciplines.
According to Sassoon, GCEP leaders are currently trying to unify re
search groups from both Stanford and peer schools. Representatives from
the project have visited and reviewed 19 potential research institutions in
Europe, Japan and the United States, he added. GCEP administrators are
also working on developing a new contract system to allow promising insti
tutions to participate in the project.
"I know that GCEP's leaders are working hard to expand the pool of
grantees to the international scale, and I expect they will do so in the next
few years," said Pamela Matson, dean of the School of Earth Sciences. "The
fact that GCEP's leaders got this very complex project off the ground quick
ly with mostly Stanford grants makes good sense."
When questioned about a possible conflict of interest within the faculty
committee concerning the distribution of funds, Sassoon maintained that
the committee works more to provide feedback and that additional bodies
have been created to govern the project's logistics.
"GCEP has established other committees including an independent ex-
