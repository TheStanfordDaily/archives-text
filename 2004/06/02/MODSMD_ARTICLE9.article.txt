Changing the Earth's orbit
As stars age they typically become brighter and hotter because they burn
fuel at a faster rate. The Sun is no exception, and astronomers believe that in a
billion years the Earth will become too hot to sustain life. However, not all is lost
— with existing technology, some planning and a redirected asteroid, it is possi-

OJ * I O » X
ble to move the Earth to a more distant orbit. The asteroid's
gravitational energy would push the Earth away from the Sun.
Of course, it would be a one-shot solution, any mistake could
be fatal.
First clone
The San Diego has made news by taking the first clone of an
endangered animal. Jahava is an eight-month-old male ban
teng, a form of wild cattle from Southeast Asia. He was cloned
from a male banteng born in the zoo in 1974 that never repro-

duced. Jahava also has genetic material from a cow because his banteng cells
were inserted into the egg of an lowa cow. If he mates, however, the offspring
will be fully banteng.
Why T Rex became large
Tyrannosaurus Rex fossils are impressive in their sheer size but one little
known fact is it almost tripled in body mass over its predecessors, a trend ob
served in several bipedal carnivores of the time. Paleontologists believe two
main conditions allowed for this gigantism. First, these animals were cold-blood
ed and needed less food than warm-blooded animals to maintain their bodies.
Second, they inhabited large landmasses free of other large competitors. Some
argue these theories are inconclusive, but without the metabolic spectrum of a
living animal we will never be sure.
Mutation that confers HIV resistance
Out of the 20 million people infected with AIDS, two major groups seem to
have resistance toward the virus. One has a mutation that prevents formation of
a cell protein on which the virus latches. Population geneticists have found it oc
curs in 10 percent of Europeans. The mutation may have been advantageous
against the bubonic plague or smallpox and thus has been preserved. The second
set are East Africans, especially in areas where malaria is a major health con
cern. It seems a mutation that confers an advantage against malaria also confers
some HIV resistance. The mutation is not well understood but the HIV Center
in Nairobi, a premier institute in AIDS research, has made progress in the last
three-four years.
Supernova survivor
Stars either die with a bang or with a whimper. The former can happen when
the star is very massive and results in a supernova. In 1993 a star in the nearby
galaxy MBI became the second brightest supernova ever observed but puzzled
astronomers because of the absence of hydrogen. Now, astronomers have con
firmed the suspicion — before exploding the star had given a large part of its hy
drogen to a companion star. The most surprising part is how the discovery was
made: by observing the actual companion star. This is the first time humans have
observed a companion star survive a supernova.
Bose-Einstein Condensate
The five states of matter are liquid, solid, gas, plasma and Bose-Einstein
(BE) condensate. The last one happens at temperatures close to 0 K, when all
atoms align and virtually cease to move. B-E condensate is the least understood
and the only one that has not been observed naturally. A team of physicists has
recently moved closer to making a B-E condensate by exciting electrons in very
cold atomic gas. "These insights could lead to new strategies for engineering con
fined exciton systems and open up new opportunities for making Bose-Einstein
condensates in solids," said Chih-Wei Lai, the first author in the paper published
in Science.
