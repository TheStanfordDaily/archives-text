The ultimate choice
When mankind sees, at last, the folly of its present fasci
nation with violence and war, and discards the means to carry
out its acts of violence, it will undergo a remarkable transfor
mation. The first signs of this most welcome change in human
behavior can be seen in the millions who now march denounc
ing war and calling for justice and peace. These demonstrations,
spontaneous and worldwide, are a sure indication that mankind
is ready to renounce the past, and, when properly led, to change
direction. This time is fast approaching.
Amid the trauma and stressful conditions of the present,
a new vision of the future is presenting itself to the hearts and
minds of millions who, to a greater or lesser degree, respond.
Men are awakening to the necessity of peace if mankind is to
survive. Few there are who doubt this in their hearts, however
much they may be embroiled in war. The stage thus is set for the
ultimate choice before mankind.
To the average onlooker, the world is torn and dominat
ed by those who do not share the vision of peace, who see only
opportunities for wealth and power in every conflagration.
While these are many, the majority of men are tired of the use
lessness of war, and seek strategies to put an end to such folly
for ever. In their hearts burns the hope of a new time of peace
and progress for all. These people, in every country, represent
the hope of the world.
It is to them that Maitreya will address Himself on His
emergence. It is to them that He presents the vision of the future,
even now. They, in their many millions, will quickly respond to
His advocacy, and set alight the hope of all.
Thus will Maitreya persuade men that further reckless
strife is useless and dangerous. That the problems of today are
global and cannot be solved by war. That co-operation alone will
bring men peace and plenty. That only as brothers, hand in
hand, can they enter the new world which awaits their care.
Happiness
Thus will men decide, and turn back from the abyss. Thus
will they demonstrate their choice for life and happiness, and,
eyes alight with hope, begin together the task of reconstructing
this world.
The time of decision is nigh, almost upon us. Maitreya is
ready, eager to show the way, point the new direction. Millions
await His counsel and inspiration, wisdom and love. Maitreya
will vouchsafe the future for all.
