Graduating Seniors!
Thank you
to all who helped Stanford divert 54% of its waste from
the landfill and into other beneficial uses.
What ever road you take, make sure it leads to a sustainable
future for you...and the world.
Think about the environment in your everyday life:
Drive IeSS. Bring a mug. Recycle. Turn off the lights.
Think two-sided printing. Continue biking. Buy
recycled paper. Donate excess clothes, appliances, sup
plies, everything. Eat organic. Borrow instead of buy. Try
out compact fluorescent lights. Compost. Cut down
on disposables.
