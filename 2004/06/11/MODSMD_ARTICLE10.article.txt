was hardly my firct choice. Lixicing hack on
growing upin Brazil, I guess I was even more
dueless ahout college than a typical high
sch(X)ler.
Yet, as fate may have it. at the moment of
decision, I chose to come here. I had never
been to Stanford, yet somehow I believed
the " You will grow as a person" pn muse em
blazoned on the letter of admissk hi.
I cannot put in words how deeply this lit

tle piece of land with some buildings and lots
of trees, means the world to me. I feel like I
have burgeoned ten-fold in my five yeais
here —gk )lxtl citizen, SLE kid volunteer to

awesome college newspaper (I had to pro

don't know what these terms are, you seri

residential staff.
As I write this, memories start tkxxling
my mind. My fondest memory is of course
that of making friends from all over the
globe. But my collectkxi of memories also

includes getting caught by the aips during
my attempt to climb atop the Berkeley
tower to hoist a Cardinal flag, and the lifelong
lessons I learned about believing in myself as
I struggled against a broken knee to recover
and get back into running and swimming—
an effort that resulted in breaking personal
records.
Granted, it has not been a bed of roses. I
have experienced failure (I still have night
mares about that Fin CSIO3X), bitterness
(particularly over the restrictions on inter
national students) and unhappiness (such as
being lonely at Christmas). Yet I cherish
even these memories, for the experiences

that shaped them led me to learn a little
more about this person allied Amit Garg.
It is scary to think how this place has be
come ingrained in my psyche. When I see
an athletic team dazzling the wodd, it is
those kids down the hall from me that I
think about. When the Nobel committee
announces its honorees who have changed
the world, it Is the name of that professor
that I hair. When the newest breakthrough
to revolutionize the world comes along, it is
Stanford's name that I see printed in the
headline.
I guess being here is nothing less th<in a
privilege. We were given opportunities that

few can even dream of. As graduates, we
have the duty to make a positive difference
in the world
Last week, I performed—for the first
time—at MemAud in front of a thousand
people. Bltxxlgushing through my veins, the
maddening roar of the audience, the fluid
choreography of my feet... And then it was
over. Just like that. I felt exhilarated for hav
ing given my best And yet 1 felt sad. Sad that
those excruciating practices were over, sad
that those lovely faces that I saw every other
day would no longer be there, sad that it was
coming to an end.
Stanford has been my dance for the last

five years. Here I created my own music,
danced like nobody else was watching.
In "Tuesdays with Morrie," Morrie
Schwartz proposes a test for happiness: "If
you had to do it all over again, would you?"
I would and would not change a thing.
Time waits for no one. We all have to ac
cept change and move on. But writing this as
one of my final acts here, I have just oome to
realize that I am not really leaving Stanford.
I will always have it within me.
