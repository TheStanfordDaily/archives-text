RAM IN SETOODEH

I'd like to share some of my favorite
lines from my old Stanford Daily
movie columns. May 10. 2tX)l: Two
weeks ago, I went to see "Bridget
Jones's Diary" and smiled and laughed ;ind
just felt good about the world Now I've been
asked to review "The Mummy Returns.''
The task. I reason, is beyond my grasp.
Jan. 11,2001. Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions Robin Mamlet on the film
"Orange County": "I recognize that the
movie is a satire."
April 5,2002; When I say that "Once and
Again' (ABC, Monday, 10 pm) is the best
I show on netw< *k TV, Jam not saying it in the
; same vein as th< *ie jump-< m-the-lxindw;ig( m

critics who change their minds as often as
Wh< x jjti changes gt >wns at the Oscars.
May 17,2002: A kmg time ago at a multi
plex not so tar away, sophomores Brian
Decker and Carolyn Quam started waiting
in line for the new "Star Wars" movie,
"Episode 11: Attack of the Qones."Theduo
arrived at the Century 16Theatres in Moun
t;iin View with a tent, sleeping bags and
sandwichesTUesday night at 10p.m.,afu1126
hours before the first sh< rwing of the George
Lucas film at 1201 am yesterday morning
"We were the first in line," Quam said.
"I missed two classes and work," Deck
er said.
July 5,2002: The tots in the audience

started chanting, "We love Stitch!" priorto
a showing of this animated film. But when
the lights dimmed and the projector rolled,
it was obvious there was little to love about
the blue Martian who makes up the latter
half of Disney's "Lilo & Stich"
Aug. 29,2002: A conversation between
me and the actress Piper Perabo on punc
tuation in the title of her film "Slap
Her...She's French":
Me: "The posters and press material
use ellipses. But some Internet databases
have separated the two clauses with a
comma."
Perabo: "That's so terrible that they
haven't made their decision on their punc

tuation. I'm guessing really it's a comma."
Me: "Doesn't it work either way?"
Perabo: "I guess so. But it should be a
comma, because there's not a period at the
end. I've been out of school a little while.
Are you still at school?"
Me: "Yes."
Perabo: "See. That's why you noticed
the punctuation in your questioning."
SepL 27,2002: Shekhar Kapur, director
of "The Rxir Feathers." was searching for
some strawberry jam to put in his tea when
I walked into his suite at the Ritz Carlton in
San Francisco last month.
"What is it that you liked about this
film?" he asked. Then he collected himself

and said, "No, you're supposed to ask me
the questions."
Oct. 18,2002. A conversation with the
actor Jonathan Jackson on the movie
"Tuck Everlasting":
Me: "Had you read the book before ac
cepting the role?"
Jackson: "I read the book while we
were shixrting the movie."
Me: "What did you think?"
Jackson: "It was awesome."
April 4,2003: From an interview with
Michael Cunningham, author of "The
Hours": "Virginia Woolf was the first great
writer I ever read. I read her in high school
when I wasn't much interested in books.

But I could see the sentences and the den
sity and complexity, and she was doing with
language something that Jimi Hendrix
does with the guitar. It thrilled me like no
other language like that thrilled me."
Aug. 14. 2003: Indulge me fora mo
ment while I tell you that "Big Brother" is
the best reality show of the millennium
Jan. 23,2004: Ashton Kutcher on leav
ing'Punk'd": "Part ofthisisfornie. Igetoff
on aiming up with new ideas and playing
new characters."

July 5,2002: The tots in the audience

started chanting, "We love Stitch!" priorto
a showing of this animated film. But when
the lights dimmed and the projector rolled,
it was obvious there was little to love about
the blue Martian who makes up the latter
half of Disney's "Lilo & Stich"
Aug. 29,2002: A conversation between
me and the actress Piper Perabo on punc
tuation in the title of her film "Slap
Her...She's French":
Me: "The posters and press material
use ellipses. But some Internet databases
have separated the two clauses with a
comma."
Perabo: "That's so terrible that they
haven't made their decision on their punc

tuation. I'm guessing really it's a comma."
Me: "Doesn't it work either way?"
Perabo: "I guess so. But it should be a
comma, because there's not a period at the
end. I've been out of school a little while.
Are you still at school?"
Me: "Yes."
Perabo: "See. That's why you noticed
the punctuation in your questioning."

film?" he asked. Then he collected himself

and said, "No, you're supposed to ask me
the questions."

cepting the role?"

Jackson: "It was awesome."
April 4,2003: From an interview with
Michael Cunningham, author of "The
Hours": "Virginia Woolf was the first great
writer I ever read. I read her in high school
when I wasn't much interested in books.

But I could see the sentences and the den
sity and complexity, and she was doing with
language something that Jimi Hendrix
does with the guitar. It thrilled me like no
other language like that thrilled me."
