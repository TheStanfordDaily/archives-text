# Things I've learned in four years here
## 
### 
MIKEY LEE

A little goes a long way. A lot
goes even longer. Love
means different things to
different people. If you pro
crastinate, things still get done, but you
might lose a few years of your life from
the stress you incur. If you want cham
pagne at a restaurant, but don't want to
pay champagne prices, order Prosecco
instead. You can catch mosquito-eaters
in your hand, shake them around and
throw them outside instead of smashing
them. Working out makes you a much
happier and more confident person. So
does waking up early. Confrontation is
a good thing, just be kind when you're
doing it. A high draw number won't ruin
your life. When fries from In-N-Out get

cold, eat your r.apkin instead — it'll
taste better, at least. You can do every
thing at Stanford if you don't sleep, eat
or go to class. If you tell someone you'll
call him, call him. Go big or go home.
Spell check. Showing up late to things
can really piss someone off. Walk in the
way of honor. Having a messy desk dis
tracts you from doing your work. So
does instant messenger, checking your
email every thirty seconds and thinking
about what else you could be doing be
sides your work. Procrastination breeds
brilliance. If you're sick, drink as many
quarts of liquid as you can — not alco
hol, not caffeine. The Lakers suck —
whatever, I've been a Clippers fan my
whole life. Listening in class is much

more effective than taking notes.
Tresidder is spelled with one Sand two
Ds. If you play too much foosball, you'll
get tennis elbow. Honor is a virtue. So is
humility. There is never any reason to
be a jackass. Go with the flow. Fly by the
seat of your pants. People are the most
important thing, hands down. If you're
ironing something polyester, don't
leave the setting on "cotton." You can
win an election and get it stolen from
right under you — twice. Get at least 20
minutes of sun every day. Just because
you're a good athlete does not necessar
ily make you a good hook-up. Mar
guerites are never on time. Serve in the
light of truth. Stay in touch with your
drawmates and your friends from fresh

man year. Nothing's ever really fair.
Your closest friends will support you
through anything and everything. Small
things don't matter. Saying sorry means
more than you might think. Hanging
out with people is a good reason to pro
crastinate. Don't take yourself too seri
ously. Floss your teeth. It's what you
make of it. All good things come to an
end. So do all bad things. Food is much
better hot, drinks are much better cold.
The Clippers suck. Dolce & Gabbana
attracts females. There is no such thing
as grade inflation. You get sleepy after
you eat. There are such things as stupid
questions. Beer before liquor, never
been sicker. Trust your gut feeling. Go
to office hours. A one-hour nap at mid

night usually turns into a nine-hour one.
Be spontaneous. Every once in a while,
listen. Turning music on full-blast and
dancing is a good way to knock out
stress. The glass is not half-empty, it's
brimming. Call your parents. Date peo
ple. Tip waiters well if they do a good
job. Read the newspaper. As long as
you have 748 friends on
thefacebook.com, people will think
you're political — even if you're not.
Give. If you're a girl wearing a skirt,
don't ride your bike. You're not as cor
rect as you think you are. You can't win
'em all. Fraternities may actually be for
you. Perseverance is a daunting chal
lenge with uncertain outcomes, but is an
implicit necessity, making it the mother

of all bitches. Logan Tom has a
boyfriend. Don't discriminate or be
prejudiced. Believe in the life of love. I!
you have a problem with something
don't complain about it — go find out
how you can do something about it
then do something about it. If you can't
do something about it, move on. Roaci
trips are underrated. Being tired is a bad
excuse. Take the plank out of your own
eye. Appreciate people for who the)
are. There is never enough time in a day
years at Stanford or space in a newspa
per column.

Mikey Lee will graduate next year with a
degree in communication.

MIKEY LEE

A little goes a long way. A lot
goes even longer. Love
means different things to
different people. If you pro
crastinate, things still get done, but you
might lose a few years of your life from
the stress you incur. If you want cham
pagne at a restaurant, but don't want to
pay champagne prices, order Prosecco
instead. You can catch mosquito-eaters
in your hand, shake them around and
throw them outside instead of smashing
them. Working out makes you a much
happier and more confident person. So
does waking up early. Confrontation is
a good thing, just be kind when you're
doing it. A high draw number won't ruin
your life. When fries from In-N-Out get

cold, eat your r.apkin instead — it'll
taste better, at least. You can do every
thing at Stanford if you don't sleep, eat
or go to class. If you tell someone you'll
call him, call him. Go big or go home.
Spell check. Showing up late to things
can really piss someone off. Walk in the
way of honor. Having a messy desk dis
tracts you from doing your work. So
does instant messenger, checking your
email every thirty seconds and thinking
about what else you could be doing be
sides your work. Procrastination breeds
brilliance. If you're sick, drink as many
quarts of liquid as you can — not alco
hol, not caffeine. The Lakers suck —
whatever, I've been a Clippers fan my
whole life. Listening in class is much

more effective than taking notes.
Tresidder is spelled with one Sand two
Ds. If you play too much foosball, you'll
get tennis elbow. Honor is a virtue. So is
humility. There is never any reason to
be a jackass. Go with the flow. Fly by the
seat of your pants. People are the most
important thing, hands down. If you're
ironing something polyester, don't
leave the setting on "cotton." You can
win an election and get it stolen from
right under you — twice. Get at least 20
minutes of sun every day. Just because
you're a good athlete does not necessar
ily make you a good hook-up. Mar
guerites are never on time. Serve in the
light of truth. Stay in touch with your
drawmates and your friends from fresh

man year. Nothing's ever really fair.
Your closest friends will support you
through anything and everything. Small
things don't matter. Saying sorry means
more than you might think. Hanging
out with people is a good reason to pro
crastinate. Don't take yourself too seri
ously. Floss your teeth. It's what you
make of it. All good things come to an
end. So do all bad things. Food is much
better hot, drinks are much better cold.
The Clippers suck. Dolce & Gabbana
attracts females. There is no such thing
as grade inflation. You get sleepy after
you eat. There are such things as stupid
questions. Beer before liquor, never
been sicker. Trust your gut feeling. Go
to office hours. A one-hour nap at mid

night usually turns into a nine-hour one.
Be spontaneous. Every once in a while,
listen. Turning music on full-blast and
dancing is a good way to knock out
stress. The glass is not half-empty, it's
brimming. Call your parents. Date peo
ple. Tip waiters well if they do a good
job. Read the newspaper. As long as
you have 748 friends on
thefacebook.com, people will think
you're political — even if you're not.
Give. If you're a girl wearing a skirt,
don't ride your bike. You're not as cor
rect as you think you are. You can't win
'em all. Fraternities may actually be for
you. Perseverance is a daunting chal
lenge with uncertain outcomes, but is an
implicit necessity, making it the mother

of all bitches. Logan Tom has a
boyfriend. Don't discriminate or be
prejudiced. Believe in the life of love. I!
you have a problem with something
don't complain about it — go find out
how you can do something about it
then do something about it. If you can't
do something about it, move on. Roaci
trips are underrated. Being tired is a bad
excuse. Take the plank out of your own
eye. Appreciate people for who the)
are. There is never enough time in a day
years at Stanford or space in a newspa
per column.
