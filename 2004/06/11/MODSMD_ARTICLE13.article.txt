# Specs, lies and videotape

OK. Swan song column. Right.
I know the drill. I could, or
should, start this baby up with
a Betacam panegyric to the
rosiness of certain editors' cheeks after
they tipple off some "yummy bever
ages." Jump cut to a shot of the Storke
Publications Building (Daily headquar
ters) latrine, where the creamy pristine
porcelain is being savagely violated by
some post-Daily banquet reveler. This
regurgitated shot is, of course, lovingly
enhanced by diagetic audio. Finally,
zoom in on the peculiar sticky spots
found on the infamous Daily couch,
where any whippersnapper reporter
with half a lick of sense would decline to
recline.
But, Gentle Reader, to quote All-
Pro linebacker Junior Seau (to my cha

grin), "I won't do you like that."
I respect your intelligence, your taste,
your disdain for reporters' navel-gazing.
So instead of a widescreen gawkfest of
my time at The Daily, I'll give you a liT
somethin' different. Do come indulge in
another celluloid odyssey...
Take One. Lounging in the sybaritic
scarlet cushions of my seat in Cubberley
Auditorium, I am taking in the latest
geeksploitation flick, "Napoleon Dyna
mite." To be specific, I'm watching some
poor kid with buck teeth, huge horn rims
(I'm talking old school specs, not the
purty Oasis spinners on your grad-gift
Mazda), and high water jeans thrusting
his pelvis like it's going out of style
(which it did, young man, long, long
ago). It's funny for perhaps two seconds,
but then the scene goes on and 0n...

and onnnnn, and even the guy sitting up
at the front of the theater, the one with
the trigger-happy 150-decibel cackle,
stops guffawing. This is how the entire
movie is: A series of mildly comical vi
gnettes thatoverstay their welcome. Suf
fice to say, if you're going to waste your
time with this, don't ante up your chump
change. Wait for the DVD and watch it
gratis in the bowels of Green Library.
These days, though, people are
forced to sit through eons of broadcasts
of awkward types embarrassing them
selves on camera and ready for their
close-up. What most disturbed me, and
some other viewers, about Napoleon
Dynamite's irony-saturated reels was
the film's utterly unironic stereotyping.
Napoleon, a quintessential nerd
type, is the white protagonist; his Latino

sidekick, Pedro, speaks halting English
("He sounds like that guy down at Taco
Bell!" squealed one of the coeds near me
to her friend) and he lets Napoleon take
his food. Pedro bathes surrounded by
Santeria candles, and the audience gig
gles: The body of the man of color is
laughable, not erotic.
When Pedro asks some (white) girls
to the school dance, the first one prompt
ly rejects him. The second one agrees,
but verbally emphasizes that they are
"just friends;" mysteriously, she is at
tracted instead to Napoleon, the far
nerdier of the two. Finally, Pedro makes
a disastrous speech in his bid for the
school's presidency. The campaign is
saved only by Napoleon's lengthy, on
stage solo writhing to "black" music,
which elicits a standing ovation from the

audience and a landslide victory for
Pedro.
It gets worse, folks: The tape is sup
plied by the pneumatic black babe who
is dating Napoleon's milquetoast uncle,
who starts donning a do-rag and bling
under her influence. (She is the kind of
gal who winks salaciously at every XY
chromosome-bearer in sight, natch). I
assume that this is an overworked,
under-played screenwriter's wish-fulfill
ment fantasy, because in real life nary a
statuesque sistah would be caught dead
with such a wimp. The only other char
acters of color in the film are a couple of
Latino tattoed heavies with nothing to
do except cruise in their low-rider (ap
parently Asians and Native Americans
don't exist in Idaho). Male characters of
color are typecast either as vacuous

sexed-up studs or as emasculate patsies
(Pedro spends a great deal of the film's
running time wearing a woman's wig).
Despite all this, the two-thumbs
downer provided one big benefit. This
film reminded me of how important it is
to be objective in this media-saturated
culture. We like to watch: Everyone is a
voyeur in his or her own special way, ti >
flagrantly paraphrase Tolstoy. We can
be so seduced by spectacle that we forget
that we're imbibing messages from the
films and videos we watch, as if by osmo
sis. Watching a movie demands less con
sciousness than reading the newspaper
you're gripping, right this second, in your
hot little hands. Keep those eyes open,
and don't swallow everything you hear

geeksploitation flick, "Napoleon Dyna
mite." To be specific, I'm watching some
poor kid with buck teeth, huge horn rims
(I'm talking old school specs, not the
purty Oasis spinners on your grad-gift
Mazda), and high water jeans thrusting
his pelvis like it's going out of style
(which it did, young man, long, long
ago). It's funny for perhaps two seconds,
but then the scene goes on and 0n...

and onnnnn, and even the guy sitting up
at the front of the theater, the one with
the trigger-happy 150-decibel cackle,
stops guffawing. This is how the entire
movie is: A series of mildly comical vi
gnettes thatoverstay their welcome. Suf
fice to say, if you're going to waste your
time with this, don't ante up your chump
change. Wait for the DVD and watch it
gratis in the bowels of Green Library.
These days, though, people are
forced to sit through eons of broadcasts
of awkward types embarrassing them
selves on camera and ready for their
close-up. What most disturbed me, and
some other viewers, about Napoleon
Dynamite's irony-saturated reels was
the film's utterly unironic stereotyping.
Napoleon, a quintessential nerd
type, is the white protagonist; his Latino

sidekick, Pedro, speaks halting English
("He sounds like that guy down at Taco
Bell!" squealed one of the coeds near me
to her friend) and he lets Napoleon take
his food. Pedro bathes surrounded by
Santeria candles, and the audience gig
gles: The body of the man of color is
laughable, not erotic.
When Pedro asks some (white) girls
to the school dance, the first one prompt
ly rejects him. The second one agrees,
but verbally emphasizes that they are
"just friends;" mysteriously, she is at
tracted instead to Napoleon, the far
nerdier of the two. Finally, Pedro makes
a disastrous speech in his bid for the
school's presidency. The campaign is
saved only by Napoleon's lengthy, on
stage solo writhing to "black" music,
which elicits a standing ovation from the

audience and a landslide victory for
Pedro.
It gets worse, folks: The tape is sup
plied by the pneumatic black babe who
is dating Napoleon's milquetoast uncle,
who starts donning a do-rag and bling
under her influence. (She is the kind of
gal who winks salaciously at every XY
chromosome-bearer in sight, natch). I
assume that this is an overworked,
under-played screenwriter's wish-fulfill
ment fantasy, because in real life nary a
statuesque sistah would be caught dead
with such a wimp. The only other char
acters of color in the film are a couple of
Latino tattoed heavies with nothing to
do except cruise in their low-rider (ap
parently Asians and Native Americans
don't exist in Idaho). Male characters of
color are typecast either as vacuous

sexed-up studs or as emasculate patsies
(Pedro spends a great deal of the film's
running time wearing a woman's wig).
Despite all this, the two-thumbs
downer provided one big benefit. This
film reminded me of how important it is
to be objective in this media-saturated
culture. We like to watch: Everyone is a
voyeur in his or her own special way, ti >
flagrantly paraphrase Tolstoy. We can
be so seduced by spectacle that we forget
that we're imbibing messages from the
films and videos we watch, as if by osmo
sis. Watching a movie demands less con
sciousness than reading the newspaper
you're gripping, right this second, in your
hot little hands. Keep those eyes open,
and don't swallow everything you hear

OK. Swan song column. Right.
I know the drill. I could, or
should, start this baby up with
a Betacam panegyric to the
rosiness of certain editors' cheeks after
they tipple off some "yummy bever
ages." Jump cut to a shot of the Storke
Publications Building (Daily headquar
ters) latrine, where the creamy pristine
porcelain is being savagely violated by
some post-Daily banquet reveler. This
regurgitated shot is, of course, lovingly
enhanced by diagetic audio. Finally,
zoom in on the peculiar sticky spots
found on the infamous Daily couch,
where any whippersnapper reporter
with half a lick of sense would decline to
recline.
But, Gentle Reader, to quote All-
Pro linebacker Junior Seau (to my cha

grin), "I won't do you like that."
I respect your intelligence, your taste,
your disdain for reporters' navel-gazing.
So instead of a widescreen gawkfest of
my time at The Daily, I'll give you a liT
somethin' different. Do come indulge in
another celluloid odyssey...
