# A run around memory lane

Somewhere in the haze of prob
lem sets, programs, weekly
games of catch and post-college
preparation, I actually managed
to force myself to go fora run. And not
just one of those loops around that dry
riverbed near FloMo (don't even call it
a lake). No, this time, it was the Cam
pus Drive loop â€” or, more aptly, the
boundaries of my bubble for the last
four years.
Never mind that I, high school

cross-country runner extraordinaire,
had barely run in the intervening years.
And ignore the fact that years of ne
glect were beginning to make me feel
fat, old and horribly out of shape. I ac
tually finished it, panting breath, un
healthy sweat sheen and all.
On this specific, characteristically
beautiful, Stanford spring day, I began
at Mayfield Avenue, right near my
freshman dorm.
For some reason, this part of cam

pus has always evoked the feeling of
unbridled optimism that I had when I
came to Stanford (this is a good feeling
to have for the starting of a run). My
freshman dorm also brought to mind a
number of deep conversations I had
with my crazy dorm mates (more often
than not, a fervent defense of the Yan
kees and their importance to baseball
as we know it, which invariably ended
with the other person shouting "Go on,
buy another series").

More tellingly, it reminded me of a
mass of characteristics that had com
prised the freshman me (freshman
anyone, for that matter). This included
a strong exuberance, a touch of naivete
and a willingness to try anything and
everything. Along with these charac
teristics there was the absolute feeling
of loneliness that characterizes any
freshman, as well as a feeling of indi
rection in life (the familiar "What do I
want to do with my life?" question).

By this point, of course, I was pant
ing heavily, but luckily approaching the
end of my run and my senior residence
(I made a quick decision to cut off the
whole Junipero Serra bit in the interest
of surviving to the end). Suites, my se
nior home, has always held an aura of
pragmatic realism, just for the simple
fact that it's as close to the real world as
you can get living on campus (let's ig
nore Mirrielees for the moment).
Senior year is like a mass of com-

fort, happiness, wistfulness and uncer
tainty all rolled into one. My fellow
classmates suddenly begin to feel old
and start looking for direction in their
lives. And it made me realize: Most se
niors still don't know what they want to
do with their lives.
It's good to know that some things
haven't changed.
