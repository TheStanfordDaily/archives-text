Before you arrive, learn how to
pronounce the mime of your
dorm, Naranja: Repeat silently
in your head. Naran-ha,
Naran-ha. On the first day of Orienta
tion. talk to the beautiful, snobby girl in
the armchair. Tell her you like her shoes.
She'll smile and say, "I'm Dana. 1 like
yours too." Stick with this one. She'll
take you places.
Visit Cantor Arts Center. Hike the
Dish. Decide you should have schtx>l
spirit, and let Dana convince you to join
the Axe Committee. Decide you should
be proud of your Indian culture, and join
Sanskriti. Decide you are a born per
former. and audition for Gaieties. Four
years from now. these will be some of the
most embarrassing moments of your
life. So what? Embarrass yourself.

You'll realize the following: You ain't
sing, you can't dance, you can't act. You
don't know the difference between
garba raas and tandoori chicken. No
matter how hard you try, you'll never
have school spirit.
But you can write. St) write. Read To
bias Wolffs story "Hunters in the
Snow," then sign up for his IHUM lec
ture. Listen carefully in class to discover
the secret of the genius behind that story.
When he doesn't offer it in lecture, at
tend his office hours. You'll try to ask
your question, the one about the story,
but it won't come out. You're nervous.
You can't speak. He'll stare at you
blankly and then escort you out. You'll
think to yourself: What just happened?
Did I ruin my only chance? Nah. One
thing you'll learn: The world is full of sec

ond chances. You'll get yours.
Meanwhile, join The Daily. You il
complain to your friends that nobody there
respects your brilliance. What, do you ex
pect them to thiink you'.' All 1,68() mem
bers of your freshman class are convinced
they're brilliant. Join the club. Keep writing
anyway. Soon, they'll ask if you want to
edit, and you'll say sure. You'll realize that
you can't stop saying sure. At the end of a
50-hour workweek, ask yourself if it's
worth it You'll tell yourself no. You'll keep
doing it anyway. And that's how you'll re
alize: You've found your place.
You'll spend too much time in that
office. You'll stop going to class. Recog
nize that you'd be nothing without Ami.
who reminds you every quarter which
line means supply and which means de
mand. When Ami leaves for Oxford.

don't think you can manage without her.
Or. better yet. do think you can. Contin
ue to sleep through class. When the
Econ 140 final rolls around, open your
blue book and realize how little you un
derstand. Then panic. You deserve it.
Start going to classes. Sign up fora
creative writing course. ITie teacher is
Adam Johnson. Listen to him. Admire
him. Treat his every word as gospel.
Read his stories, try to write like him and
fail. Write like yourself. Succeed. Fill
your schedule with creative writing
courses; by senior year, you'll realize
you've taken so many of them that
you've barely made a dent in your
major, international relations.
So in the spirit of IR. go abroad. Leam
to appreciate goat cheese; le;irn to speak
quietly: leam that vegetarianism is for the

weiik. iind start eating dead cows. Learn
French, kind of. Convince yourself you
never want to leave Paris. Then leave Paris.
When you return to Stanford senior
year, spend a quarter panicking that
you'll never see your best friends again.
Then spend the next two quarters ignor
ing everyone but them. Attend Stanford
Chamber Chorale concerts and power
lifting tournaments. Gorge yourself on
fake salami. Tear apart your friends' fic
tion over Dove chocolates and wine.
While eating Ethiopian fmxj, have the
following conversation:
"Would you rather be a pirate or a
cowboy?"
"Pirate."
"Would you rather elope with Sad
dam Hussein or Osama bin Laden?"
"Osama."

"Would you rather be ugly or boring'.'"
"Ugly."
"Stupid or boring?"
"Stupid."
"Nailed to a crucifix through your
wrists and ankles, or boring?"
"Crucified."
Decide that this conversation is some
how significant. Memorize it. Look across
the table at Dana and think about how
long it will lie before you'll get to play
"Would You Rather?" again. Miss your
friends, prematurely; consider initiating a
conversation about Feelings, then hate
yourself for being so disgustingly senti
mental. Lick your fingers and order more
lentils. Resolve to never become boring.
