ERIC ELDON

The following is my third try at
writing my farewell column.
For the first draft. 1 wrote a
laundry list of thoughts about
Stanford and this country that I've al
ways wanted to share with the Daily
readership - but haven't had the chance
to because I've been working in the news
department. That draft quickly turned
into a tirade against various political
viewpoints and behavior that I disagree
with. But it didn't end up being too in
sightful compared to the current rich
ness of political rhetoric among the most
learned and powerful in this country.
To make the points of the first draft by

way of illustration, the second draft was a
story about gn >wing up playing guns in the
wixxis with some friends back home in
Oregon, and how they've ended up in an
;irmy base outside of Baghdad.
From what I'd le;irned in our more seri
ousconversatioas, these two brothers-who
will both remain anonymous here - had
never been tcx) interested in politics, ;ind
had joined the national giuird a few yean;
back for the college money (Go Beavs!),
the adventure, the free paintball war
games, the pay. the career opportunities, a
drop or two < >112 patriotism - the normal rea
soas that people used to join the army for.
My story was going to be how these

would-be professional soldiers from a log
ging town of S(X) in the Oregon Coast
Riuige have been put into a pointlesslv life
threatening situation — para-dropping
into Baghdad to quell dissent Blackhawk
down style, the last 1 heard - because of a se
ries of what I, in my ivory bubble liberalism,
think were ptx>r decisions made by this
country's leadership.
Right before 1 was about to send my
second draft in to be published, I received
an email from one of them—the first since
they went to Iraq several months ago. I'm
taking the journalistic liberty of printing it
here because he's the one who is having to
deal with those poor decisions, not me.

"What up you! I tried to email you be
fore but these computers .ire bunk and id
ways give me hell as they iire trying to do
light now. Shit sucks here but there is noth
ing we can do about it but drive on. We are
about X miles XXXX of Baghdad in
XXXX [that'sforthe Armycensors]. There
is stxxx) much stupid shit we have to do and
so many people in leadership positions that
have no idea what the hell is going on I just
can't wait to get out of the military. Tins has
been th£ deciding factor for me. 1 am
through with this shit when I get back!
Other than <dl the bullshit life goes on. Hie
Iraqi people are very gtxxl people for the
most pail I have met a lot of really nice peo

pie here. You know 1 have met more ass
holes in America than I have here to be hon
est with you. I am sure v< >u know from your
travels but you can rei illy see just hew selfish
Americans are when you get < >ut and see the
real world ;uid its people. I gotta get going
for now but hit me back and 1 will keep you
posted on what is happening in hell."
Some people in older generations of
th is a >untrv have decided to sacrifice some
of today's - my friends included - for deci
sions that they in their hubris were con
vinced of at the time. We have learned to
think in the same way as those leaders: that
we are the smartest, the most talented, the
best-educated; that we deserve our Stan-

ford degrees and our increasingly powerful
positions in tills world because our deci
sions are always right.
But here, we haven't neces&irilv learnt
much about relating to everyone else in this
country and in this world. If you haven't be
fore, spend some time after graduation
pushing your comfort zone, getting to learn
more about the near-infinite variety of
huniiin beings out there ;ind all that you
have in common with them. One doesn't
easily sacrifice who or what one cares about
and feels a part of.

deal with those poor decisions, not me.

"What up you! I tried to email you be
fore but these computers .ire bunk and id
ways give me hell as they iire trying to do
light now. Shit sucks here but there is noth
ing we can do about it but drive on. We are
about X miles XXXX of Baghdad in
XXXX [that'sforthe Armycensors]. There
is stxxx) much stupid shit we have to do and
so many people in leadership positions that
have no idea what the hell is going on I just
can't wait to get out of the military. Tins has
been th£ deciding factor for me. 1 am
through with this shit when I get back!
Other than <dl the bullshit life goes on. Hie
Iraqi people are very gtxxl people for the
most pail I have met a lot of really nice peo

pie here. You know 1 have met more ass
holes in America than I have here to be hon
est with you. I am sure v< >u know from your
travels but you can rei illy see just hew selfish
Americans are when you get < >ut and see the
real world ;uid its people. I gotta get going
for now but hit me back and 1 will keep you
posted on what is happening in hell."
Some people in older generations of
th is a >untrv have decided to sacrifice some
of today's - my friends included - for deci
sions that they in their hubris were con
vinced of at the time. We have learned to
think in the same way as those leaders: that
we are the smartest, the most talented, the
best-educated; that we deserve our Stan-

ford degrees and our increasingly powerful
positions in tills world because our deci
sions are always right.
But here, we haven't neces&irilv learnt
much about relating to everyone else in this
country and in this world. If you haven't be
fore, spend some time after graduation
pushing your comfort zone, getting to learn
more about the near-infinite variety of
huniiin beings out there ;ind all that you
have in common with them. One doesn't
easily sacrifice who or what one cares about
and feels a part of.
