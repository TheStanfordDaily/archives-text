# No time for nostalgia

Five hundred words, they tell me.
I've got SCX) words to distill the
college experience. Five hun
dred words to inspire, thank and
self-aggrandize. And like a young starlet
under the white-hot lights of a Broadway
debut. I'll dance. For the next S(K) words,
I'll dance for truth.
When I was a high schcx>l senior four
years ago. my college options boiled down
to this: Going to school with Natalie Port
man or Chelsea Clinton. I wish 1 were kid
ding. but in m;inv ways the college selec
tion process did feel that arbitrary. First, in
the way you got admitted — a highly mvs

tic procedure involving constant prayer
and voodoo magic — and then in the ac
tual selection of where to stake the next
four years of your life. 'I"he truth is, I never
really thought about life after high school.
I assumed that getting in somewhere was
enough and that everything afterwards
wt >uld just take aire (>l' itself.
But the real truth is that time is re
lentless. It keeps on moving, whether you
follow it or not. 1 won't say these four
years at Stanford have been perfect —
anyone who claims no regrets is either in
credibly lucky or incredibly deluded (or
is that lucky to be deluded?). I won't say

it has all flown by either — that spring
quarter of junior year I spent in Sweet
Hall was Purgatory incarnate.
And yet, as the specter of graduation
forces us to evaluate these past four years
as a whole, it really is funny how your
memory seems to smooth things over.
We feel nostalgia for moments we may
or may not have ever had, and with this
nostalgia comes the tendency to want to
savor it all, to recognize that this is the
conclusion of a period of our lives that
will never come again.
Whenever 1 think of any graduation.
I think of Diane Court's valedictory

speech from Cameron Crowe's classic
film "Say Anything." Instead of inspira
tion. she offers her classmates a warning.
"I've glimpsed our future," she says.
"And all I can say is: Go back." Natural
ly, in our nostalgic reveries we will at
tempt to cling to what we've come to
know these past few years— this sense
of worldly knowledge tempered with
comforting smallness. I have to admit
I've spent an inordinate amount of time
these last few weeks trying to preserve it
all in my mind, and more than once I've
been met with this feeling of completely
underwhelming resolution. Whither all

the drama? Whither all the tears?
And then I realize that my model for
living has to change. Because we can't
live our lives solely for discrete moments,
for those markers that signify the transi
tion to the next stage. As Jerry Maguire
writes in his famous mission statement
(which 1 encourage you all to read), "I
am wondering what that exact moment
is when we truly, truly love our jobs. Is it
during the day. or at the end of the day or
is it years later looking back on all we ac
complished? I think perhaps truly loving
something is the ability to love it at that
moment. Being able to enjoy enjoyment

while it is happening."
These next few years are our ran
dom years, our first real opportunity to
try Life on for size, and in all honesty, 1
think that's pretty damn exciting. If
you're lucky enough to face it with some
of your current friends, congratulations;
if you're headed deep into the unknown
all by yourself, even more power to you.
We're all at the beginning of our adven
ture. Class of 2(X)4. and I can't wait to see
how it turns out.
