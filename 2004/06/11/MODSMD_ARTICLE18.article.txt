# Never be boring

Pre-partum nostalgia aside, it's
time to leave the Farm. Sud
denly four years of making de
cisions and finding our own
paths has been condensed into a single
drawn-out, disconcerting moment of
saying goodbye, when time reminds us
who is in charge and sends us abruptly
on our way.
1 would like to avoid the stereotypi
cal questions-Did 1 take advantage of
enough things? Should 1 have done
more, or less, or different? Did I get
done what I was supposed to do in col
lege?-and try to keep this relevant.

Assuming a position of fabricated
authority-this is, after all, a dubiously
deserved farewell column I am writing
here-I want to speak of the empower
ing self-determinism I exerted over the
last four years. So for the returning stu
dents, a quick list of opportunities you
should consider to "make your time
more worthwhile." Graduates. I'll get
to you in a minute.
Returning students: Volunteer at
90.1fm KZSU.
The radio station aside, most of my
best memories at Stanford happened
away from Stanford. My sophomore

year I grabbed a globe in my advisor's
office, pointed my finger to Ipanema
Beach (which isn't exactly marked on
the globe, but work with me) and went.
1 went to Hawaii with Alternative
Spring Break, Cape Town, South
Africa with the Overseas Seminar Pro
gram and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with
URO and departmental grants.
Travel on Stanford's bill as much as
you can. Not only because it's a good
deal, but because the quality of experi
ence traveling within an educational
framework is just so much better. You
start talking to mountain-dwelling taro

gurus named Butch, aspiring ragamuf
fin artists in Guguletu, and yes. mom
and dad. even solicitous Brazilian sex
workers in Irish pubs during Carnaval.
You see things tourists don't see.
My time at The Daily, if nothing
else, should be proof of the worth of the
unseen and entirely unlikely opportu
nities. You would be hard-pressed to
find a more apathetic sports fan than
myself, and somehow that translated to
writing a Friday column for the last
year. It was a weekly exercise in making
an otherwise boring parameter rele
vant, and controversial even.

And if you spend enough concerted
effort transforming your daily context,
you grow. In that mysterious. Jungian
kind of way. Kind of like Uma Thur
man trying to punch a hole through a
wood board. You punch the board
enough times, and next thing you know,
you've dug yourself out of your own
grave and gone on to kill Bill and re
unite with your daughter and even pull
out Darryl Hannah's eyeball. Inspiring,
severe-the woman kicks ass.
Graduates. It's okay not to remember
everyone's name in five years, or even this
summer when you're drunk and nostalgic

at some bar in San Francisco.
But for the love of God, try not to be
boring. The value of your Stanford de
gree is to have an unprecedented
amount of freedom in chcx>sing whatev
er the hell you want to do or interpret or
create or transform, and doing it with
some spark. Fall in love, break promises,
eat excessively... just don't be boring.
Let's live stories our grandkids will
want to hear, if we're not too senile to
get the details straight.

Julie Ruvolo is graduating with a degree
in cultural and social anthropology.
