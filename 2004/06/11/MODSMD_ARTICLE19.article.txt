So, this is where 1, as an experi
enced, knowledgeable Daily
writer, am supposed to offer
some advice or words of conso
lation, profound and thoughtful.
Don't get your hopes up. First, you
need to have words of wisdom, and I
don't claim to have any wisdom that has
not already been dished out. or any pro
found ideas, for that matter. Second, it
is a nostalgic time, if nothing else, but 1
got over the whole college life quite a
while ago.
It was probably the day that a col
umn in The Daily about Residential
and Dining Enterprises showed up crit
icizing the mismanagement of Residen
tial and Dining Enterprises and cited
the high cost of both as evidence.
Of course, that opinion came in the
middle of the student body's demand
that President Hennessey create a bet

ter "code of conduct" for worker's
rights, which will in turn lead to much
higher costs of both dining and housing.
Now. I will not deny that R&DE is
poorly run — as are many departments
here at Stanford — and i cannot claim
that getting paid $8 per hour is neces
sarily fair in all situations.
However, we cannot always have
everything we want. Too bad. Wel
come to the real world.
Good words of consolation, huh?
Does that mean that being an ideal
ist or activist is a bad thing? Not at all.
Being immature, uninformed and in
flexible. however, will get you nowhere.
My hope for the Class of 2(X)4 is that
we never lose our sense of activism, al
truism and idealism. It is those charac
teristics in us that will help shape the fu
ture of this country, hopefully for the
better.

But on the flip side, being idealistic
and criticizing an organization without
so much of a glimpse into how it really
operates will do nothing to further your
cause.
Always ask the hard, critical ques
tions.
Residential Education didn't crack
down on the student social scene be
cause they felt it would be better. They
did it because students were irresponsi
ble. Our old alcohol policy — may it
rest in peace — died because students
abused the University's trust, and the
University must answer to our parents
and our donors, without whom Stan
ford would not exist.
Yes, the cost of dining is high, but it
is because of students' demand for
quality food and produce, high labor
costs, exorbitant health care costs and
sky-high worker's compensation costs.

not just mismanagement.
There were some problems with
the Housing Draw this year, but no one
ever sought out the real reason. Yes.
there was a new database, but it was late
in coming because the proper funds
were not allocated to it in a timely man
ner and the contract for the work was
terribly written and failed to include de
mands fora specific final product.
We. as students, tend to oversimpli
fy issues, removing the necessary
thought and analysis that must be a part
of successful activism.
Why do we have so many tempo
rary workers? Because the army need
ed to wait on us Stanford students prac
tically hand and foot is huge. Why don't
we employ more of them under con
tract? Because we don't want higher
prices on campus.
How much do workers in janitorial

and food services get paid outside of
Stanford? Nowhere near $14 per hour
plus benefits. Why? More importantly,
can Stanford afford to pay $14 per hour
for its gigantic workforce? No. Why?
The answers to these questions
may support or hurt your cause, but
they will always help you decide how
to reach your goal and how to express
your idealism responsibly and effec
tively.
I am charging the Class of 2004 to
take a different approach as we brave
this new and undiscovered country. I
charge you to ask the hard, thought
provoking questions when you decide
to take t)n an issue, whether it's at
Stanford, in a corporation or in the
government.
I charge this to all classes still at
Stanford as well. You still have the abil
ity to shape the course of Stanford's fu-

ture, and inextricably, the pride we all
feel in our alma mater.
So, Class of 2004.1 welcome you to
the real world. We'll find it is not as sim
ple as college, where so many safety
nets are in place and you can petition
your way out of problems. Instead, it
will represent a whole new set of chal
lenges for us.
And through all the changes that
may happen in our lives over the com
ing years, I hope we will still stand for
our ideals and continue to make a dif
ference on an even larger scale as this
leading institution graduates its best
class ever, a class of the world's future
leaders.
