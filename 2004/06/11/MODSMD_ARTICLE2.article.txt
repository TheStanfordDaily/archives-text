During the summer of 2000, the Uni
versity welcomed new people to three
high-level administration positions. Phi
losophy Prof. John Etchemendy moved to
the Provost's Office to replace new Uni
versity President John Hennessy. Robin
Mamlet stepped in as the dean of under
graduate admission and financial aid, in
place of the departing Robert Kinnally.
The Rev. William "Scotty" McLennan Jr.
became dean of religious life, succeeding
interim Dean Rev. Kelly Denton-
Borhaug.
October
Stanford announced that it would set
aside its open spaces from development
for 25 years, bringing the University one
step closer to agreement with the Palo
Alto City Council about future develop
ment of the Foothills. The Foothill
boundary line would follow Junipero
Serra Boulevard and prevent Stanford
from adding new buildings to the
Foothills for at least 25 years.
At his inauguration on Oct. 23, Uni
versity President John Hennessy an
nounced the Campaign for Undergrad
uate Education, which aims to raise $1
billion for undergraduate education
over the next live years. The campaign,
which had already collected $429 million
from alumni, has several objectives, in
cluding increasing financial aid and per
manently endowing .programs such as
Sophomore College and Stanford Intro
ductory Studies.
November
Daily senior staff member Anuj Gupta
reported on the progress of the presi
dential elections from Nashville, Tenn:
"The champagne had been popped in
Austin. Gov. George W. Bush had gra
ciously accepted a concession call from
Vice President Al Gore," Gupta wrote.
"Then, at about 2:45 a.m. CST, under a
steady rain, in the most improbable of
elections, Gore Campaign Chairman Bill
Daly uttered the most improbable of
words: 'Our campaign contin
ues!' .... More than an hour after all
major networks had projected Bush as

the winner of Florida, and therefore the
election, Florida officials released figures
showing the race to be too close to call,
leading Gore to retract his earlier conces
sion and putting the election's outcome
in doubt."
Starting the third century of the Big
Game, a single, simple pass to the full
back gave Stanford a thrilling 36-30 over
time victory over Cal for the sixth year in
a row.
December
Following the United Farm Workers'
decision Nov. 21 to cancel its boycott of
California table grapes, University Presi
dent John Hennessy announced the end

point, students decided each fall whether
grapes would be served in their dining

of the School of Medicine. Pizzo was

April 2.
February
Faculty, students and staff within the
Division of Literatures, Cultures and Lan
guages were divided on the proposal to
unite the six departments into one. Under
the proposal, the division would retain its
current name, but each of the six depart
ments would become an area under the
departmental leadership of the division.
The division would offer new majors, re
cruit five more senior faculty and free de
partment heads to teach and research.
However, some students and faculty con
tended that dissolving the current depart
ments would cause a loss of departmental
identity and would result in inferior schol
arship.
March
University President John Hennessy
announced on March 16 his selection of

Carly Fiorina, president and chief execu
tive officer of Hewlett-Packard and Stan
ford graduate from the Class of 1976, to
deliver the Commencement speech. The

believe that Fiorina, the CEO of the
world's largest consumer information
technology company and the second
largest technology firm in the world, em
bodies only the business interests of the
class.
April
In an act the Stanford Police have
called a hate crime, white supremacist and
anti-Asian graffiti was written in two build
ings in the Quad during finals week of
winter quarter. The messages were writ
ten in the Lane History Corner and Build
ing 50, home of the Center for East Asian
Studies. They were scribbled with black
marker on the wall of two classrooms and
on the wall of the arcade outside the histo
ry building.
Provost John Etchemendy announced
that Biology Prof. Sharon R. Long will
succeed Malcolm Beasley as dean of Hu
manities and Sciences. Long has won sev
eral teaching awards, including a
Mac Arthur Prize Fellowship, and is a
member of both the National Academy of
Sciences and the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences.
James Montoya, vice provost for stu
dent affairs, announced that he would be
leaving Stanford on June 30 to take a
newly created position as vice president of
the College Board. "There is never a good
time to leave Stanford, but it does feel like
the right time, and not just because the
last class I admitted to the University is
graduating this June," Montoya said. "We
have a new president and provost who are
committed deeply to student affairs, and
we are blessed with an extraordinary stu
dent affairs staff."
May
Hewlett Foundation Chairman Wal
ter B. Hewlett announced that the
William and Flora Hewlett Foundation
will make a gift of $400 million in unre
stricted funds to Stanford. $300 million
of the donation will go directly to the
School of Humanities and Sciences, and
the remainder is earmarked for the

Campaign for Undergraduate Educa
tion. This is one of the largest gifts ever
given to an institution of higher educa
tion and the largest gift to an endow
ment.
This spring marks the 30th anniver
sary of the Stanford Powwow and Indian
Art Market, sponsored by the Stanford
American Indian Association. The Pow
wow Committee drew 30,000 individuals
from Native American and non-Native
American communities, as well as 300
dancers.

June
University President John Hennessy
and Provost John Etchemendy released a
10-point plan committing the University

scholarly interests among the faculty.

Daily senior staff member Anuj Gupta
reported on the progress of the presi
dential elections from Nashville, Tenn:
"The champagne had been popped in
Austin. Gov. George W. Bush had gra
ciously accepted a concession call from
Vice President Al Gore," Gupta wrote.
"Then, at about 2:45 a.m. CST, under a
steady rain, in the most improbable of
elections, Gore Campaign Chairman Bill
Daly uttered the most improbable of
words: 'Our campaign contin
ues!' .... More than an hour after all
major networks had projected Bush as

the winner of Florida, and therefore the
election, Florida officials released figures
showing the race to be too close to call,
leading Gore to retract his earlier conces
sion and putting the election's outcome
in doubt."
Starting the third century of the Big
Game, a single, simple pass to the full
back gave Stanford a thrilling 36-30 over
time victory over Cal for the sixth year in
a row.

class.
