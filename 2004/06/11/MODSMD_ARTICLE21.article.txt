## Upsetting end for Cardinal 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
As Stanford Cardinal fans filed out of
Sunken Diamond after Sunday's NCAA Re
gional Championship game, the prevailing
sound was silence. It would take some spec
tators hours or even a few days to let the
game's result sink in.
Long Beach State 8, Stanford 4.
For the past five years straight, the Car
dinal has ended its season at the College
World Series in Omaha, Neb. But this year,
despite the high goals and even higher ex
pectations, the season ended here on the
Farm.
There will be no College World Series, no
Super Regional. Just the memory of a score
board that told a story too shocking to be true.
Long Beach State 8, Stanford 4.
Stanford battled the hard way into the Re
gional Championship, despite blasting
fourth-seeded UNLV on Friday, 10-4, behind
the leadership of starting hurler Jeff Gilmore
(who tossed his second complete game of the
season) and junior slugger Danny Putnam.
After the rout of the Rebels, the Cardinal
faced off with second-seeded Long Beach
State and arguably one of the best arms in
college baseball — righthander Jered
Weaver, who was taken 12th overall in this
week's MLB draft.
Weaver was not an impossible strength
to get around — in fact, the Cardinal con
nected for five hits off of the righty. The
problem was actually the hard-hitting
Dirtbags offense, which ate Cardinal ace
Mark Romanczuk alive, collecting nine
base knocks in the lefty's mere 3 2/3 in
nings of work.
"Our hitters were unbelievable today,"
Weaver said in a press conference after the
7-4 Dirtbags victory. "It was fun to sit back
and watch and it was fun to be out there on
the mound."
The loss tossed the Cardinal into the
loser's bracket and forced the team into a
doubleheader on Saturday.
Though there were concerns about Stan
ford's pitching staff being able to choose a
third starter reliable enough to keep the
team from elimination at the hands of third
seeded St. Johns, freshman Matt Leva rose
to the occasion and played hero, tossing his
first-ever complete game and allowing only
two runs on seven hits. The righthander had
never before thrown more than four innings
in a game.

"We thought [Leva] would match well
with this team and he did," Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess said. "He kept them
off balance and had a good changeup and a
real good fastball."
Leva's performance allowed the Cardi
nal to surge to a 7-2 victory, highlighted by
a homer each from sophomore infielders
Jed Lowrie, John Mayberry, Jr. and Chris
Minaker. The win sent St. John's home to
New York, and propelled Stanford into the
Championship game against Long Beach
State.
Because the Regionals are double-elim
ination, the Cardinal would have had to top
Long Beach twice to move on to Super Re
gionals, but with the strong showing against
St. John's, fan faith in the Stanford squad
was at a pitch.
But once again. Cardinal pitching was a
bit too friendly to the Dirtbags hitters. Mar
quess opted for the unconventional strate
gy of starting his closer, senior righty David
O'Hagan.
In theory, the gamble was a good one,
but just as the usually consistent Ro
manczuk crumbled against the Dirtbags, so
did O'Hagan. The senior lasted 2 2/3 in
nings, giving up six runs — the result of a
trio of two-run moonshots.
"I think I tried to take too much of it on
my own shoulders," O'Hagan said. "I
ended up making some pitches that weren't
the best pitches for the situations. And at
the same time, I think the Long Beach State
hitters did a good job of coming through
when they had to."
Sophomore Matt Manship slowed the
bleeding in his four innings on the mound,
giving up only one run, but the Cardinal
bats never picked up. Long Beach number
two starter Cesar Ramos gave up seven
hits and the Dirtbags defense made four
errors, but the Stanford offense failed to
capitalize, stranding 11 baserunners, in
cluding the four that boarded the basepa
ths on errors.
Mayberry and junior designated hitter
Chris Carter both went long with solo
shots, and Stanford manufactured a run in
the second and the seventh, but the team
could not keep up with the pace of the Dirt
bags.
The heartbreaking elimination marked
the end of five Cardinal careers, as seniors
Jonny Ash, Drew Ehrlich, Sam Fuld, Brian
Hall, and O'Hagan will soon graduate.
"Anytime you lose it's disappointing,"

Ash said after the Championship game. "But
ending our season like this and not excelling
in the postseason like we planned on ... it's
going to be disappointing."
Added Marquess: "[Our seniors have had]

so much success and all of them saved their
best year for their last year, not only on the
field but leadership. I want to thank them pub
licly for what they've given to the program."
The Cardinal team, which sat atop the

polls for several weeks this season, finished
the year with a record of 46-14, while Long
Beach State improved to 39-19. The Dirtbags
will take on the Arizona Wildcats this week
end in the Super Regionals.

the same time, I think the Long Beach State
hitters did a good job of coming through
when they had to."
Sophomore Matt Manship slowed the
bleeding in his four innings on the mound,
giving up only one run, but the Cardinal
bats never picked up. Long Beach number
two starter Cesar Ramos gave up seven
hits and the Dirtbags defense made four
errors, but the Stanford offense failed to
capitalize, stranding 11 baserunners, in
cluding the four that boarded the basepa
ths on errors.
Mayberry and junior designated hitter
Chris Carter both went long with solo
shots, and Stanford manufactured a run in
the second and the seventh, but the team
could not keep up with the pace of the Dirt
bags.
The heartbreaking elimination marked
the end of five Cardinal careers, as seniors
Jonny Ash, Drew Ehrlich, Sam Fuld, Brian
Hall, and O'Hagan will soon graduate.
"Anytime you lose it's disappointing,"

Ash said after the Championship game. "But
ending our season like this and not excelling
in the postseason like we planned on ... it's
going to be disappointing."
Added Marquess: "[Our seniors have had]

so much success and all of them saved their
best year for their last year, not only on the
field but leadership. I want to thank them pub
licly for what they've given to the program."
The Cardinal team, which sat atop the

polls for several weeks this season, finished
the year with a record of 46-14, while Long
Beach State improved to 39-19. The Dirtbags
will take on the Arizona Wildcats this week
end in the Super Regionals.

Stanford players console each other after Long Beach State eliminated the Cardinal in the Palo Alto Regional at Sunken Diamond last week
end. Stanford's school record five straight trips to the College World Series came to an abrupt end, as did the careers of five seniors.
As Stanford Cardinal fans filed out of
Sunken Diamond after Sunday's NCAA Re
gional Championship game, the prevailing
sound was silence. It would take some spec
tators hours or even a few days to let the
game's result sink in.
Long Beach State 8, Stanford 4.
For the past five years straight, the Car
dinal has ended its season at the College
World Series in Omaha, Neb. But this year,
despite the high goals and even higher ex
pectations, the season ended here on the
Farm.
There will be no College World Series, no
Super Regional. Just the memory of a score
board that told a story too shocking to be true.
Long Beach State 8, Stanford 4.
Stanford battled the hard way into the Re
gional Championship, despite blasting
fourth-seeded UNLV on Friday, 10-4, behind
the leadership of starting hurler Jeff Gilmore
(who tossed his second complete game of the
season) and junior slugger Danny Putnam.
After the rout of the Rebels, the Cardinal
faced off with second-seeded Long Beach
State and arguably one of the best arms in
college baseball — righthander Jered
Weaver, who was taken 12th overall in this
week's MLB draft.
Weaver was not an impossible strength
to get around — in fact, the Cardinal con
nected for five hits off of the righty. The
problem was actually the hard-hitting
Dirtbags offense, which ate Cardinal ace
Mark Romanczuk alive, collecting nine
base knocks in the lefty's mere 3 2/3 in
nings of work.
"Our hitters were unbelievable today,"
Weaver said in a press conference after the
7-4 Dirtbags victory. "It was fun to sit back
and watch and it was fun to be out there on
the mound."
The loss tossed the Cardinal into the
loser's bracket and forced the team into a
doubleheader on Saturday.
Though there were concerns about Stan
ford's pitching staff being able to choose a
third starter reliable enough to keep the
team from elimination at the hands of third
seeded St. Johns, freshman Matt Leva rose
to the occasion and played hero, tossing his
first-ever complete game and allowing only
two runs on seven hits. The righthander had
never before thrown more than four innings
in a game.

"We thought [Leva] would match well
with this team and he did," Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess said. "He kept them
off balance and had a good changeup and a
real good fastball."
Leva's performance allowed the Cardi
nal to surge to a 7-2 victory, highlighted by
a homer each from sophomore infielders
Jed Lowrie, John Mayberry, Jr. and Chris
Minaker. The win sent St. John's home to
New York, and propelled Stanford into the
Championship game against Long Beach
State.
Because the Regionals are double-elim
ination, the Cardinal would have had to top
Long Beach twice to move on to Super Re
gionals, but with the strong showing against
St. John's, fan faith in the Stanford squad
was at a pitch.
But once again. Cardinal pitching was a
bit too friendly to the Dirtbags hitters. Mar
quess opted for the unconventional strate
gy of starting his closer, senior righty David
O'Hagan.
In theory, the gamble was a good one,
but just as the usually consistent Ro
manczuk crumbled against the Dirtbags, so
did O'Hagan. The senior lasted 2 2/3 in
nings, giving up six runs — the result of a
trio of two-run moonshots.
"I think I tried to take too much of it on
my own shoulders," O'Hagan said. "I
ended up making some pitches that weren't
the best pitches for the situations. And at
the same time, I think the Long Beach State
hitters did a good job of coming through
when they had to."
