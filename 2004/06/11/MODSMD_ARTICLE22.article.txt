Power Outage
After combining fora .380 average, 45 home runs and 180 RBls dur
ing the regular season, the middle of the prolific Cardinal lineup (com
prised of sophomores Jed Lowrie and John Mayberry Jr. and junior
Danny Putnam) was a combined 14-for-52 (.269) with four home runs
and 11 RBIs in four games last weekend.
While those numbers are respectable overall, they do not tell the
entire story. The heart of the Stanford order was just 3-for-26 in Stan
ford's two losses, which ended the Cardinal's season short of the
NCAA Super Regional for the first time since 1998. Long Beach State
ace Jered Weaver held the trio hitless in 13 at-bats on Saturday. The
heart of the order tallied just one RBI against the Dirtbags, a solo
home run by Mayberry off of reliever Brian Anderson in the ninth in
ning on Sunday.
"I'd like to say it's just slumping, but that's not giving Long Beach
enough credit," said Stanford head coach Mark Marquess. "We had a
lot of opportunities but we weren't able to get the big hit. They do a
very good job pitching. They change speeds very well and they're in
and out. In most cases good pitching gets good hitting out."
The entire Stanford lineup failed to take advantage of numerous
scoring opportunities in the Cardinal's two losses. The normally slick
fielding Dirtbags committed four errors on Sunday, which led to just
one Stanford run. The Cardinal left a combined 19 men on base in its
two losses while Long Beach State stranded 12.
Tulowitzki Dazzles in Homecoming
After playing at Sunken Diamond fora fourth consecutive postsea
son, Palo Alto was probably starting to feel like a home away from
home for the veteran Long Beach State players and head coach Mike
Weathers. For sophomore shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, it practically is
home. Playing in front of friends and family, the Sunnyvale native and
graduate of nearby Fremont High School was named the Regional's
Most Outstanding Player.
Tulowitzki, who had three home runs in 55 games during the regu
lar season, clubbed three in the span of 24 hours, all off of Cardinal
pitching. After belting two opposite-field solo shots on Saturday, Tu
lowitzki deposited the first pitch he saw on Sunday from Cardinal
starter David O'Hagan over the fence to stake the Dirtbags to an early
2-0 lead they would not relinquish.
"It's definitely fun, 10 minutes down the road is where I live, so I
have a lot of friends and family members here," said Tulowitzki of
playing at Sunken Diamond.
Leva Answers the Call
With the season hanging in the balance after a winner's bracket loss
to Long Beach State on Saturday morning, head coach Mark Marquess
sent freshman Matt Leva to the mound.
Leva responded with the finest performance of his young career.
Mixing in pitches, the Galveston, Texas, native went the distance and
allowed just two runs on seven hits while walking one and striking out
a career-high five. The complete game effort shattered Leva's previous
