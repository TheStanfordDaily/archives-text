Eight Stanford players were taken on the first day of the 2004
Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft on Monday.
Junior outfielder Danny Putnam was the highest Stanford
player taken, selected in the compensation A round with the
36th overall pick by the Oakland Athletics. He was the 15th
Stanford player in the last 18 years taken in either the first round
or as a compensatory pick. He was one of four Stanford juniors
taken on the day.
Seven Cardinal players were taken in the first 11 rounds, the
first time that has happened in school history. Stanford has had
six players taken in both 1992 and 1998.
"We have a good reputation for having players drafted and
being successful in professional baseball," said Stanford manag
er Mark Marquess. "This just adds to that reputation, and I'm
pleased that these guys were recognized for having professional
baseball ability."
Other players selected included junior catcher Donny Lucy
(second round, 59th overall) to the Chicago White Sox. junior
pitcher Mark Jecmen (seventh round, 197 th overall) to the
Cleveland Indians, senior pitcher David O'Hagan (ninth round,
252 nd overall) to the San Diego Padres, senior outfielder Brian
Hall (10th round, 297 th overall) to the Toronto Blue Jays, senior
outfielder Sam Fuld (10th round, 306 th overall) to the Chicago
Cubs, senior third baseman Jonny Ash (11th round, 334 th over
all) to the Houston Astros and junior designated hitter Chris
Carter (17th round, 506 th overall) to the Arizona Diamond
backs.
A's general manager Billy Beane attended Stanford's Satur
day loss to Long Beach State to watch not pitching phenomenon
Jered Weaver but Putnam.
He didn't get a chance to talk with the Stanford outfielder but
contacted him via phone after Oakland drafted Putnam.
"He said he didn't want to make a scene or get coach mad,
but he just wanted to say hi," Putnam said. "He wasn't con
cerned whether I got a hit off Weaver or not."
Putnam hit a career-high .378 with a career-high-tying 16
home runs and 62 RBIs in 2004 to earn All-Pac-10 honors. He
led the team in hits, multiple-hit games, two-homer games and
triples. He finished the regular season by hitting safely in 29 of
33 games.
"Danny Putnam has had two fabulous seasons back-to
back," Marquess said. "The A's know him well because they've
been able to see him play a lot due to their proximity and know
what he can do."
Lucy's selection in the second round was higher than many
draft boards had pegged him leading up to the draft. He earned
All-Pac-10 honors for the first time in his career as a junior, fin
ishing with a .313 average, 12 home runs, 47 RBIs and a 15-game
hit streak in his first season starting behind the plate.
