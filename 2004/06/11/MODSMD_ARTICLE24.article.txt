Football starts 2-0
PROVO, Utah —Trent Edwards won his first colle
giate start, but not in the manner he expected.
The redshirt freshman quarterback, who struggled all
night to throw the ball against an unorthodox Brigham
Young defense, turned a naked bootleg into a go-ahead
touchdown with 3:51 remaining in the game.
Stanford's defense made a last-minute stop as the Car
dinal (2-0) matched last year's win total with a thrilling but
ugly 18-14 road victory.
Junior running back Kenneth Tolon rushed fora ca
reer-high 141 yards on a career-high 32 carries.
Edwards completed only 10-of-23 passes for 25 yards,
threw two interceptions and will be remembered — for
now at least — as the signalcaller who led Stanford to its
lowest number of yards passing (56) in school history.
But despite its offensive woes — including going only
2-for-16 on third downs — the Cardinal was somehow
able to escape Provo with a victory.

Football beats ASU, now 4-4
J.R. Lemon was going through his usual pre-game rou
tine, when 20 minutes before kickoff, he got the news.
Starting tailback Kenneth Tolon had an injured right
thumb - and Lemon was going to be his replacement.
"1 was caught a little off-guard." Lemon admitted.
But the junior running back took full advantage of his
opportunity and rushed fora career-high 151 yards on 34
carries and two touchdowns in powering Stanford (4-4,2-
4 Pacific 10 Conference) to a 38-27 victory over Arizona
State in front of 26,950 soaking fans at Stanford Stadium.
Stanford's offense, maligned for its poor execution and
even poorer numbers, racked up a season-high 467 yards
of total offense, converted over 50 percent of its third
downs and scored five of the six times it entered the red
zone - including four touchdowns.

Women's soccer loses in first round at
NCAAs
Friday night marked a frustrating end to a frustrating
season for the Stanford women's soccer team (10-9-2),
which bowed out of the NCAA College Cup in the first
round with a 1-0 loss to Bay Area rival No. 3 Santa Clara
(13-3-5).
The Cardinal has been plagued by injury all season and
Friday was no different — the team was forced to take the
field without its two top forwards, seniors Marcie Ward
and Brittany Oliveira.
While the Stanford defense was stellar all year, the sea
son proved that tight games cannot be won without some
sort of offensive firepower.
The Cardinal stepped up and played its best against top
teams, most notably coming away with scoreless ties
against then-No. 3 UCLA and then-No. 2 Notre Dame,
but never could get that win that would get their season
going.
Individually, five Stanford players received All-Pac 10
Honors. Barnhart and Marquand received first team hon
ors. Barnhart recorded seven shutouts, 63 saved and post
ed a 0.78 goals allowed average.

Stanford men and women both win
cross-country national championships
After a season of sweat and preparation, the top
ranked men's cross country team cemented its status as
one of the greatest ever assembled, and the No. 2 women's
team capped its return to glory after a seven-year NCAA
Championship drought.
Both teams won national championships in Waterloo,
Ind., on Monday, seven years to the day after both won ti
tles in 1996. The men won in convincing fashion despite
temperatures that dropped to 18 degrees, scoring a scant
24 points to runner-up Wisconsin's 174. The women wrest
ed the crown away from BYU, last year's champion, by
the slimmest of margins, scoring 120 points to BYU's 128
in an upset.
The Cardinal men took six of the top 13 spots to secure
its fourth national championship in eight years. Junior
Ryan Hall finished second overall, completing the 10-kilo
meter course in 29 minutes, 15.4 seconds.
"To have six guys in the top 13 is unprecedented," said
head coach Andy Gerard. "From a historical perspective,
I'm not sure where we stand. I don't know how you can
compare across generations, but I do know that the guys
did a great job today in comparison to the rest of the field."
The team's 150-point margin of victory was the largest
in NCAA history, and its score was second only to UTEP's
17 in 1981.
Each of Stanford's seven runners were named All-
Americans. Seniors Grant Robison, lan Dobson and
Louis Luchini finished fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively.
Seniors Adam Tenforde and Donald Sage finished 12th
and 13th and senior Seth Hejny rounded out the Stanford
pack in 33rd.
On the women's side, junior Sara Bei finished third
overall, running the six-kilometer course in 19:49.1. North
Carolina's Shalane Flanagan won the race in 19:30.4. Ju
nior Alicia Craig finished sixth, and freshmen Katy Trot
ter, Arianna Lambie and Amanda Trotter placed 21st,
24th and 92nd, respectively to round out Stanford's scor
ing.
Bei, Craig, Katy Trotter and Lambie received Ail-
American honors. Evans was named NCAA Coach of the
Year for women's cross country, and Gerard received the
honor on the men's side.

Football season ends with loss at hands of
former coach
The Stanford football team was hoping to conclude its
season with a morale-boosting win over Notre Dame and
former coach Tyrone Willingham in his first return to the
Farm. The Cardinal was hoping to secure a little positive
momentum heading into the offseason and send out its 13
seniors on a high note.
But instead, Stanford was embarrassed like it had
never been before on its home turf - and the team is left
with a lingering bitterness over some Irish antics.
Stanford (4-7) ended the 2003 season on Saturday with
a humiliating, depressing 57-7 pasting at the hands of
Notre Dame — the worst home loss in 96 years of school
history.
Notre Dame running back Julius Jones was the star of
the evening. He had 74 yards on the game's opening drive

and finished with a mind-boggling 218 yards and a 9.5
yard-per-carry average. Also, running back Ryan Grant
had three touchdown runs and the Notre Dame defense
returned two Stanford fumbles for touchdowns.
"We didn't play," said senior quarterback Chris Lewis.
"We didn't tackle, we didn't get first downs [and] we
turned the ball over for touchdowns."

Men's water polo falls in title game to USC
No. 2 Stanford was unable to best No. 1 Southern Cal
ifornia in the NCAA Water Polo Championship on Dec.
7 at the Avery Aquatic Center.
Not even an amazing four goals by the nation's top
player, junior driver Tony Azevedo — who was named
the American Water Polo Coaches Association Player of
the Year for the third time last week — could bring Stan
ford the win over the Trojans, though the Cardinal man
aged to push the match into overtime.
More than 2,800 spectators crowded the aisles to wit
ness the hard fought contest that ended with a 9-7 USC
victory and extended the Trojans' winning streak against
the Cardinal this season to four. While each game was
close, Stanford remained unable to conquer USC's tough,
physical play.
Though the Cardinal battled the Trojans to a 7-7 tie at
the end of regulation play, USC would not let Stanford
take control of the game.
Both teams remained scoreless in the first overtime pe
riod. The Trojans' Trevor Clark scored the winning goal
with 56 seconds left in the second overtime period.

Robinson's buzzer-beater caps a minute of
miracles for the men's basketball team
They rushed the court at Maples Pavilion on Saturday.
Hands waving, feet stomping, girls crying, the Sixth
Man Club jumped up and down on those bouncy floors
like it never had before, like it never would again.
In reality, that post-game rush on those particular
bouncy floors, after junior forward Nick Robinson hit a
32-foot game winner over Arizona's Andre Iguodala,
might just have been the Sixth Man Club's last bounce (the
floors are being replaced this spring as a part of the Maples
renovation).
But nobody's talking about that right now.
For the moment, they're already calling this one a clas
sic. Already marking it down in the history books as one of
the most entertaining and intriguing collegiate games of
all time.
And, really, it was all of that — every gut-wrenching,
heart-pounding, hair-pulling bit of No. 2 Stanford's (20-0,
11-0 Pacific-10 Conference) 80-77 win over No. 12 Ari
zona (14-6,6-5) on Saturday lived up to that billing.
"I'm starting to think this group might be something
special," Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said.
"That was just an unbelievable game."

Women's hoops at a crossroads after two
losses in Arizona
After Arizona State (15-6,9-3 Pacific-10 Conference)

flat-out manhandled the No. 7 Stanford women's basket
ball team (17-5,10-3), 73-53, in an astounding 30-point sec
ond half turnaround on Saturday, Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer put things as only she could.
"Our second half was an absolute melt-down," she
said. "There didn't seem to be anything that we did right."
The numbers say the same thing. In the second half, the
Cardinal had 11 turnovers, was out-rebounded 28-25, hit
just six field goals and shot a stunning 16.2 percent from
the field. Stanford, the best three-point shooting team in
the conference, by both percentage and number made,
was just 2-of-25 for the game.
And that's just the beginning of the bad news for Stan
ford. When polls come out on Monday, the Cardinal will
have most likely lost its place among the nation's top 10,
and won't see its name atop the Pac-10 leaderboard for the
first time this season, and the fear that once struck the
heart of Stanford's opponents will most likely be gone.
The disastrous weekend has put the Cardinal at what
VanDerveer called a "crossroads" in its season. Stanford
has three weeks remaining in regular-season conference
play to regroup and try to regain some of the momentum
it had going into the season, when it was one of the hand
ful of teams expected to compete for the national title.

Baseball gets off to spectacular start
If anyone hadn't yet figured out how the Stanford base
ball team has been able to build a 13-2 record and become
the top-ranked squad in the NCAA, this past weekend re
vealed it all. The Cardinal used every strength in its arse
nal in its sweep of California (7-9) and showed that when
explaining the team's success, it all comes down to one
thing — versatility.
"When we haven't pitched well we've been able to
score enough runs to give ourselves a chance to win and

when we haven't scored a lot of runs we've been able to
pitch well," Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said.
"You've got to be able to do that... and we've proved
that we're capable."
The series is the fifth straight in which the Cardinal has
bested Cal.

Men's hoops suffers its first loss in its last
game of the regular season
SEATTLE, Wash. — And just like that, it was over.
Finally? ... Over.
The steak, the dream of an undefeated season, the No.
1 ranking and the endless comparisons with undefeated St.
Joseph's — all the talk about history and all the hoopla
ended Saturday afternoon in front of a national television
audience and a record crowd of 10,086 at Bank of Ameri
ca Arena in Seattle, where the Stanford men's basketball
team (26-1,17-1 Pacific-10 Conference) lost its first game
this season, 75-62, to Washington (17-10,12-6).
The loss — the Cardinal's first since March 22, 2003,
when the Cardinal fell 85-74 in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament to Connecticut — ended Stanford's
history-making winning streak and caused the Cardinal
failed to become the only team in Pac-10 history to go 18-
0 during the regular season.
Stanford will join Arizona and Oregon State on the list
of Pac-10 teams to complete a 17-1 conference season.
And with that loss, speculation begins. Suddenly ques
tions about the prospects of going undefeated have mor
phed into queries about almost perfect.
"It's just that we were one game away from something
pretty special," added head coach Mike Montgomery be
fore a throng of reporters outside of a quiet Stanford lock
er room. "It might take a little while to get over that."

Alabama washes men's hoops out of NCAA
Tournament
SEATTLE, Wash. — A little over two weeks ago, in
the same city that the top-seeded Cardinal lost its first
game of the season to Washington, then-No. 1 Stanford
(30-2) racked up its second and final loss of the year, a 70-
67 upset by eighth-seeded, unranked Alabama in the sec
ond round of the NCAA tournament.
More importantly and perhaps most devastatingly for
Stanford fans, for the second time in three weeks, a Stan
ford fairy tale ended in Seattle.
And, in reality, it had all the makings of a fairy tale —
all the drama and intrigue and seemingly ironic storylines
— an almost-perfect season with the potential to make a
return trip to San Antonio for the Final Four.
But it didn't end that way. Instead, the Cardinal failed
to advance past the round of 32 for the third consecutive
year.
"It's very difficult to gain some perspective from this
game when we are hurting so badly, and to try to put into
perspective what we've accomplished this year," said
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery as he struggled to
find his words. "I can't really help them through that."
"I'm angry," junior swingman Josh Childress added.
"I'm angry and disappointed."
After an even opening period in which the Cardinal

found itself up by two at the half, 39-37, Stanford clawed
its way to a 13-point second half lead with eight minutes
left to play, holding the Crimson Tide to l-of-17 shooting
for the opening 12 minutes of the period.
And then the unthinkable happened - the tide turned -
and Stanford went cold.
Alabama scored 16 consecutive points over the next 4
1 / 2 minutes to take the lead, 56-53, and Childress picked
up his fifth foul and was forced to watch the remaining
three minutes from the bench. Childress finished with 12
points and seven boards in what might be his final game in
a Stanford uniform.

Suminski's buzzer-beater sends women to
Elite Eight
NORMAN, Okla. —When the Stanford women's
basketball team (29-6) received its draw from the NCAA
Selection Committee, things looked bleak. A No. 6 seed in
the Midwest, where the Cardinal would be lumped behind
overall No. 1 seed Tennessee, red-hot Oklahoma — many
pundits' dark horse pick to reach the Final Four - and SEC
Tournament Champ Vanderbilt.
Stanford, however, played with a huge chip on its
shoulder and used the Selection Committee's snub to ad
vance to the Elite Eight yesterday, defeating Vanderbilt in
the Sweet Sixteen, 57-55, on a three-pointer by junior Kel
ley Suminski with 0.3 seconds on the clock.
The Cardinal jumped out to a nine-point halftime lead
behind the brilliant first half play of Nicole Powell. Powell,
who had a double-double within 12 minutes of tipoff, or
chestrated the Stanford offense to perfection.
Stanford broke down the Commodores' patented
matchup zone defense with ease in the first 20 minutes,
shooting an astounding 61.9 percent from the field in the
first half, including 6-for-10 from long range.
