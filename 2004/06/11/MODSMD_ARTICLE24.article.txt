Football starts 2-0
PROVO, Utah —Trent Edwards won his first colle
giate start, but not in the manner he expected.
The redshirt freshman quarterback, who struggled all
night to throw the ball against an unorthodox Brigham
Young defense, turned a naked bootleg into a go-ahead
touchdown with 3:51 remaining in the game.
Stanford's defense made a last-minute stop as the Car
dinal (2-0) matched last year's win total with a thrilling but
ugly 18-14 road victory.
Junior running back Kenneth Tolon rushed fora ca
reer-high 141 yards on a career-high 32 carries.
Edwards completed only 10-of-23 passes for 25 yards,
threw two interceptions and will be remembered — for
now at least — as the signalcaller who led Stanford to its
lowest number of yards passing (56) in school history.
But despite its offensive woes — including going only
2-for-16 on third downs — the Cardinal was somehow
able to escape Provo with a victory.

Football beats ASU, now 4-4
J.R. Lemon was going through his usual pre-game rou
tine, when 20 minutes before kickoff, he got the news.
Starting tailback Kenneth Tolon had an injured right
thumb - and Lemon was going to be his replacement.
"1 was caught a little off-guard." Lemon admitted.
But the junior running back took full advantage of his
opportunity and rushed fora career-high 151 yards on 34
carries and two touchdowns in powering Stanford (4-4,2-
4 Pacific 10 Conference) to a 38-27 victory over Arizona
State in front of 26,950 soaking fans at Stanford Stadium.
Stanford's offense, maligned for its poor execution and
even poorer numbers, racked up a season-high 467 yards
of total offense, converted over 50 percent of its third
downs and scored five of the six times it entered the red
zone - including four touchdowns.

Women's soccer loses in first round at
NCAAs
Friday night marked a frustrating end to a frustrating
season for the Stanford women's soccer team (10-9-2),
which bowed out of the NCAA College Cup in the first
round with a 1-0 loss to Bay Area rival No. 3 Santa Clara
(13-3-5).
The Cardinal has been plagued by injury all season and
Friday was no different — the team was forced to take the
field without its two top forwards, seniors Marcie Ward
and Brittany Oliveira.
While the Stanford defense was stellar all year, the sea
son proved that tight games cannot be won without some
sort of offensive firepower.
The Cardinal stepped up and played its best against top
teams, most notably coming away with scoreless ties
against then-No. 3 UCLA and then-No. 2 Notre Dame,
but never could get that win that would get their season
going.
Individually, five Stanford players received All-Pac 10
Honors. Barnhart and Marquand received first team hon
ors. Barnhart recorded seven shutouts, 63 saved and post
ed a 0.78 goals allowed average.

Stanford men and women both win
cross-country national championships
After a season of sweat and preparation, the top
ranked men's cross country team cemented its status as
one of the greatest ever assembled, and the No. 2 women's
team capped its return to glory after a seven-year NCAA
Championship drought.
Both teams won national championships in Waterloo,
Ind., on Monday, seven years to the day after both won ti
tles in 1996. The men won in convincing fashion despite
temperatures that dropped to 18 degrees, scoring a scant
24 points to runner-up Wisconsin's 174. The women wrest
ed the crown away from BYU, last year's champion, by
the slimmest of margins, scoring 120 points to BYU's 128
in an upset.
The Cardinal men took six of the top 13 spots to secure
its fourth national championship in eight years. Junior
Ryan Hall finished second overall, completing the 10-kilo
meter course in 29 minutes, 15.4 seconds.
"To have six guys in the top 13 is unprecedented," said
head coach Andy Gerard. "From a historical perspective,
I'm not sure where we stand. I don't know how you can
compare across generations, but I do know that the guys
did a great job today in comparison to the rest of the field."
The team's 150-point margin of victory was the largest
in NCAA history, and its score was second only to UTEP's
17 in 1981.
Each of Stanford's seven runners were named All-
Americans. Seniors Grant Robison, lan Dobson and
Louis Luchini finished fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively.
Seniors Adam Tenforde and Donald Sage finished 12th
and 13th and senior Seth Hejny rounded out the Stanford
pack in 33rd.
On the women's side, junior Sara Bei finished third
overall, running the six-kilometer course in 19:49.1. North
Carolina's Shalane Flanagan won the race in 19:30.4. Ju
nior Alicia Craig finished sixth, and freshmen Katy Trot
ter, Arianna Lambie and Amanda Trotter placed 21st,
24th and 92nd, respectively to round out Stanford's scor
ing.
Bei, Craig, Katy Trotter and Lambie received Ail-
American honors. Evans was named NCAA Coach of the
Year for women's cross country, and Gerard received the
honor on the men's side.

Football season ends with loss at hands of
former coach
The Stanford football team was hoping to conclude its
season with a morale-boosting win over Notre Dame and
former coach Tyrone Willingham in his first return to the
Farm. The Cardinal was hoping to secure a little positive
momentum heading into the offseason and send out its 13
seniors on a high note.
But instead, Stanford was embarrassed like it had
never been before on its home turf - and the team is left
with a lingering bitterness over some Irish antics.
Stanford (4-7) ended the 2003 season on Saturday with
a humiliating, depressing 57-7 pasting at the hands of
Notre Dame — the worst home loss in 96 years of school
history.
Notre Dame running back Julius Jones was the star of
the evening. He had 74 yards on the game's opening drive

and finished with a mind-boggling 218 yards and a 9.5
yard-per-carry average. Also, running back Ryan Grant
had three touchdown runs and the Notre Dame defense
returned two Stanford fumbles for touchdowns.
"We didn't play," said senior quarterback Chris Lewis.
"We didn't tackle, we didn't get first downs [and] we
turned the ball over for touchdowns."

Men's water polo falls in title game to USC
No. 2 Stanford was unable to best No. 1 Southern Cal
ifornia in the NCAA Water Polo Championship on Dec.
7 at the Avery Aquatic Center.
Not even an amazing four goals by the nation's top
player, junior driver Tony Azevedo — who was named
the American Water Polo Coaches Association Player of
the Year for the third time last week — could bring Stan
ford the win over the Trojans, though the Cardinal man
aged to push the match into overtime.
More than 2,800 spectators crowded the aisles to wit
ness the hard fought contest that ended with a 9-7 USC
victory and extended the Trojans' winning streak against
the Cardinal this season to four. While each game was
close, Stanford remained unable to conquer USC's tough,
physical play.
Though the Cardinal battled the Trojans to a 7-7 tie at
the end of regulation play, USC would not let Stanford
take control of the game.
Both teams remained scoreless in the first overtime pe
riod. The Trojans' Trevor Clark scored the winning goal
with 56 seconds left in the second overtime period.

Robinson's buzzer-beater caps a minute of
miracles for the men's basketball team
They rushed the court at Maples Pavilion on Saturday.
Hands waving, feet stomping, girls crying, the Sixth
Man Club jumped up and down on those bouncy floors
like it never had before, like it never would again.
In reality, that post-game rush on those particular
bouncy floors, after junior forward Nick Robinson hit a
32-foot game winner over Arizona's Andre Iguodala,
might just have been the Sixth Man Club's last bounce (the
floors are being replaced this spring as a part of the Maples
renovation).
But nobody's talking about that right now.
For the moment, they're already calling this one a clas
sic. Already marking it down in the history books as one of
the most entertaining and intriguing collegiate games of
all time.
And, really, it was all of that — every gut-wrenching,
heart-pounding, hair-pulling bit of No. 2 Stanford's (20-0,
11-0 Pacific-10 Conference) 80-77 win over No. 12 Ari
zona (14-6,6-5) on Saturday lived up to that billing.
"I'm starting to think this group might be something
special," Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said.
"That was just an unbelievable game."

Women's hoops at a crossroads after two
losses in Arizona
After Arizona State (15-6,9-3 Pacific-10 Conference)

flat-out manhandled the No. 7 Stanford women's basket
ball team (17-5,10-3), 73-53, in an astounding 30-point sec
ond half turnaround on Saturday, Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer put things as only she could.
"Our second half was an absolute melt-down," she
said. "There didn't seem to be anything that we did right."
The numbers say the same thing. In the second half, the
Cardinal had 11 turnovers, was out-rebounded 28-25, hit
just six field goals and shot a stunning 16.2 percent from
the field. Stanford, the best three-point shooting team in
the conference, by both percentage and number made,
was just 2-of-25 for the game.
And that's just the beginning of the bad news for Stan
ford. When polls come out on Monday, the Cardinal will
have most likely lost its place among the nation's top 10,
and won't see its name atop the Pac-10 leaderboard for the
first time this season, and the fear that once struck the
heart of Stanford's opponents will most likely be gone.
The disastrous weekend has put the Cardinal at what
VanDerveer called a "crossroads" in its season. Stanford
has three weeks remaining in regular-season conference
play to regroup and try to regain some of the momentum
it had going into the season, when it was one of the hand
ful of teams expected to compete for the national title.

Baseball gets off to spectacular start
If anyone hadn't yet figured out how the Stanford base
ball team has been able to build a 13-2 record and become
the top-ranked squad in the NCAA, this past weekend re
vealed it all. The Cardinal used every strength in its arse
nal in its sweep of California (7-9) and showed that when
explaining the team's success, it all comes down to one
thing — versatility.
"When we haven't pitched well we've been able to
score enough runs to give ourselves a chance to win and

when we haven't scored a lot of runs we've been able to
pitch well," Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said.
"You've got to be able to do that... and we've proved
that we're capable."
The series is the fifth straight in which the Cardinal has
bested Cal.

Men's hoops suffers its first loss in its last
game of the regular season
SEATTLE, Wash. — And just like that, it was over.
Finally? ... Over.
The steak, the dream of an undefeated season, the No.
1 ranking and the endless comparisons with undefeated St.
Joseph's — all the talk about history and all the hoopla
ended Saturday afternoon in front of a national television
audience and a record crowd of 10,086 at Bank of Ameri
ca Arena in Seattle, where the Stanford men's basketball
team (26-1,17-1 Pacific-10 Conference) lost its first game
this season, 75-62, to Washington (17-10,12-6).
The loss — the Cardinal's first since March 22, 2003,
when the Cardinal fell 85-74 in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament to Connecticut — ended Stanford's
history-making winning streak and caused the Cardinal
failed to become the only team in Pac-10 history to go 18-
0 during the regular season.
Stanford will join Arizona and Oregon State on the list
of Pac-10 teams to complete a 17-1 conference season.
And with that loss, speculation begins. Suddenly ques
tions about the prospects of going undefeated have mor
phed into queries about almost perfect.
"It's just that we were one game away from something
pretty special," added head coach Mike Montgomery be
fore a throng of reporters outside of a quiet Stanford lock
er room. "It might take a little while to get over that."

Alabama washes men's hoops out of NCAA
Tournament
SEATTLE, Wash. — A little over two weeks ago, in
the same city that the top-seeded Cardinal lost its first
game of the season to Washington, then-No. 1 Stanford
(30-2) racked up its second and final loss of the year, a 70-
67 upset by eighth-seeded, unranked Alabama in the sec
ond round of the NCAA tournament.
More importantly and perhaps most devastatingly for
Stanford fans, for the second time in three weeks, a Stan
ford fairy tale ended in Seattle.
And, in reality, it had all the makings of a fairy tale —
all the drama and intrigue and seemingly ironic storylines
— an almost-perfect season with the potential to make a
return trip to San Antonio for the Final Four.
But it didn't end that way. Instead, the Cardinal failed
to advance past the round of 32 for the third consecutive
year.
"It's very difficult to gain some perspective from this
game when we are hurting so badly, and to try to put into
perspective what we've accomplished this year," said
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery as he struggled to
find his words. "I can't really help them through that."
"I'm angry," junior swingman Josh Childress added.
"I'm angry and disappointed."
After an even opening period in which the Cardinal

found itself up by two at the half, 39-37, Stanford clawed
its way to a 13-point second half lead with eight minutes
left to play, holding the Crimson Tide to l-of-17 shooting
for the opening 12 minutes of the period.
And then the unthinkable happened - the tide turned -
and Stanford went cold.
Alabama scored 16 consecutive points over the next 4
1 / 2 minutes to take the lead, 56-53, and Childress picked
up his fifth foul and was forced to watch the remaining
three minutes from the bench. Childress finished with 12
points and seven boards in what might be his final game in
a Stanford uniform.

Suminski's buzzer-beater sends women to
Elite Eight
NORMAN, Okla. —When the Stanford women's
basketball team (29-6) received its draw from the NCAA
Selection Committee, things looked bleak. A No. 6 seed in
the Midwest, where the Cardinal would be lumped behind
overall No. 1 seed Tennessee, red-hot Oklahoma — many
pundits' dark horse pick to reach the Final Four - and SEC
Tournament Champ Vanderbilt.
Stanford, however, played with a huge chip on its
shoulder and used the Selection Committee's snub to ad
vance to the Elite Eight yesterday, defeating Vanderbilt in
the Sweet Sixteen, 57-55, on a three-pointer by junior Kel
ley Suminski with 0.3 seconds on the clock.
The Cardinal jumped out to a nine-point halftime lead
behind the brilliant first half play of Nicole Powell. Powell,
who had a double-double within 12 minutes of tipoff, or
chestrated the Stanford offense to perfection.
Stanford broke down the Commodores' patented
matchup zone defense with ease in the first 20 minutes,
shooting an astounding 61.9 percent from the field in the
first half, including 6-for-10 from long range.

Tara Kirk sets world records as women's
swimming finishes fifth at NCAAs
Though the Auburn women's swimming and diving
squad left College Station, Texas, last week with its third
national title in hand. Stanford senior Tara Kirk left the
NCAA Championships just as content as any of the
Tigers.
Kirk returned to the Farm with NCAA Swimmer of
.the. Year honors - maktll l-. 11 ci,
titles. She colltfg&fciffeer
0 mark in the 100-ygtfd breaststroke. She was Tpfflt of a
solid Cardinal team that finished the meet in fifth place —
one spot above its 2003 finish.
Oh yeah, and she broke a world record.
Kirk's 1:04.79 finish in the 100 breast — which was her
fourth consecutive national title in the event — smashed
the world record set in 2003 by Leisel Jones of Australia
(1:05.09) and was the perfect cap to Kirk's illustrious Stan
ford career.
"1 don't think I could have had a better ending [to my
college career]," said Kirk, a possible 2004 Olympian.
Kirk's world record was easily the highlight of the
Championships for the Cardinal, but the team showed
depth and strength in many events that led to its fifth-place
finish, just behind second-place Georgia, Arizona and
Florida.

Men's swimming places 2nd at NCAAs
LONG ISLAND, N.Y. — Like the rest of the student
body, the Stanford men's swim team had its weeklong hia
tus from school last week. However, instead of tropical
getaways, snowy mountains, and crazy parties, the team
had a spring break filled with exciting swimming. The
break marked the coming of the NCAA Swimming and
Diving Championships, which were held on Long Island
last Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
With its No. 2 national ranking and an undefeated
record, the Cardinal brought high hopes into the three
day battle. But in the end, the top-ranked Auburn Tigers
came away with the 2004 championship. Stanford finished
second, ahead of rival Texas in what turned out to be one
of the fastest NCAA meets in recent history.
Although swimmers performed well individually, the
lack of a team championship left some of the team mem
bers feeling disappointed. Additionally, the swimming ca
reers of Stanford stars Michael Bruce and Bobby O'Bryan
came to a close.. However, the future is bright for the
team, as the swimmers begin to prepare for the Olympic
Trials in July and their chance at Olympic glory.

Gentry wins NCAA Championship at 157
The stakes were higher and the stage grander, but for
Stanford junior Matt Gentry, the outcome was plenty fa
miliar.
With a late reversal. Gentry defeated Ohio's Jake Per
cival 4-2 in the 157-pound final at the NCAA Wrestling
Championships in St. Louis 10 days ago to cap an unde
feated season and become the first national champion in
Stanford wrestling history.
"It's a great experience, quite an honor," Gentry said.
"Stanford athletics is an amazing program, and I feel
grateful to be able to wrestle for them."
Stanford head coach Steve Buddie, who placed fourth
at NCAAs as a junior in 1990 before taking the reins at his
alma mater three years ago, is equally grateful to have
Gentry as the cornerstone of a much improved program.
"When your program turns a corner, you just know
there is no turning back, Buddie said. "This was that defin
ing moment for our program."

Women fall just short in Elite Eight
NORMAN. Okla. —The magical run is over. The
Nicole Powell era is over. The Stanford women's basket

ball team's up-and-down season has come to a heart
breaking close at the hands of Tennessee, a team that the
Cardinal just can't seem to close out.
The top overall seed in the NCAA Women's Basket
ball Tournament, Tennessee extended its dominance over
the sixth-seeded Stanford women, defeating the Cardinal,
62-60, to advance to yet another Final Four appearance —
and it took yet another controversial call to do it.
After defeating Baylor in the Sweet Sixteen on free
throws with 0.2 seconds on the clock, the Lady Vols
seemed to get away with an offensive foul that put junior
guard Kelley Suminski on the ground with under a minute
left, setting the stage fora Tasha Butts three, putting Ten
nessee in the lead.
Senior forward Nicole Powell, however, was able to an
swer back with an off-balance, one-handed runner in the
lane to tie the ballgame with 44 seconds remaining on the
clock.
Stanford came up with the defensive stop it needed,
but the rebound was swatted off the hands of senior cen
ter Chelsea T rotter, giving Tennessee another opportuni
ty to take the lead.
Butts caught an inbounds pass and worked one-on-one
against Powell, wrapping around the taller, slower Powell
fora layup from the left block to put Tennessee up by two
with 1.7 seconds remaining.
On the final play, Powell caught a perfect baseball pass
from junior forward T'Nae Thiel and was able to get off a
final shot. The shot was on line, but hit the front of the rim.
There was contact with two Lady Vols on the shot, but no
foul was called.
The game was possibly most heart-breaking for Pow
ell. Powell played an amazing two halves, finishing with 31
points, 10 rebounds and two blocks on 14-of-24 shooting
from the field.
"That's what was missing - a win," Powell said. "We
played really tough, but they made the plays that count."

Women's gymnastics finishes third
in Super Six
The Super Six. To those outside the world of college
gymnastics, it might sound like some weird average of the
Elite Eight and the Final Four. But to college gymnasts,
the Super Six is the be-all and end-all — the last stop on
the road to a national championship.
Stanford's mere appearance made school history; it
was only the second time that the Cardinal has broken into
the Super Six. The last time was in 2002 when the team
qualified by a narrow margin and finished sixth. This year,
Stanford tied for first in the preliminary meet on Thursday
and looked to repeat that winning performance on Friday.
"Before the meet, 1 told the team, 'This is our time,' "
said head coach Kristen Smyth, who was named Coach of
the Year by the National Association of Gymnastics
Coaches after the meet. " 'You've been working hard all
year, so why not? Compete with your hearts and have no
regrets. Love the sport and each other.' "
Stanford's total of 197.125 tied the Cardinal with Al
abama for third place, just shy of Georgia's 197.2 and a full
point behind UCLA's near-flawless 198.125. Third place
is the best finish ever for Stanford's women's gymnastics
program.
The Cardinal also scooped up a school record of 15 Ail-
American honors, almost double last year's record of
eight honors. Senior Lise Leveille and sophomore Natal
ie Foley each took home five All-American awards, while
Wing and Caroline Fluhrer earned three

Women's water polo takes
third at NCAAs
Describing it as an unpleasant surprise can't describe
the upset. It can't be called a setback. Instead, try a disap
pointing shock.
That is exactly what Loyola Marymount (24-5) gave
the Stanford women's water polo team (20-5) and the Car
dinal fans Saturday night when the Lions defeated Stan
ford, 5-4, at Avery Aquatic Center in the NCAA semifi
nal game. Stanford would later defeat Hartwick College
to claim third place in the nation.
Stanford went into the national championships, after
claiming the at-large berth, with much confidence. Its con
fidence was backed by its excellent season, in which it had
only suffered losses against one team, top-ranked South
ern California (24-0), but had otherwise dominated all
others with solid defense.
So what happened against LMU can still seem confus
ing, because, Stanford said head coach John Tanner, the
Cardinal had 40 percent more shots and still came up short
on the scoreboard.
"It's about chance and great plays and strange
bounces," Tanner said. "Our team had been riding on this
wave, feeling great with things going our way. Yesterday,
some things didn't."
The shocking blow was dealt at the last second, making
the loss all the more appalling for the Cardinal. With less
than 30 seconds left, LMU got a woman-up advantage.
Stacia Peterson lobbed the ball over senior Wendy
Watkins and freshman goalkeeper Meridith McColl at the
buzzer, leaving no chance for the Cardinal to come back.
"I was wide open and didn't want to go into overtime,"
said Peterson, whose team moved on to the first NCAA
championship game in its history.
To win its consolation game, Stanford had to switch
mentalities in order to play its final season game in domi
nation. The Cardinal was successful as it dominated
Hartwick, 12-2, yesterday afternoon.
"We're pleased to rebound from yesterday's disap
pointment and play at a high level," Tanner said.

Women's tennis wins national championship
Not one for superstition, the top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team (29-0) had no qualms about captur
ing its 13th NCAA Team Championship with a 4-1 victo
ry over No. 8 UCLA (19-8) yesterday.
No. 23 junior Erin Burdette (25-4) brought fans to their
feet at Dan Magill Tennis Complex as she sealed success
for Stanford with an overhead smash against the Bruins'
Feriel Esseghir (14-14).
Burdette won the decisive No. 3 singles match in
straight sets, pulling out the first set win in a tiebreaker and
coming to a resounding finish in the second, 7-6 (5), 6-3.
"It's a fairy-tale ending to come home and play in front
of family and friends," said Burdette in a press release. "1
didn't play my best today, but I was able to pull through
and get it done."
"When you play a team for the fourth time in a year, ev
erybody has so much information about each other that
this final didn't have a lot of the problems that [it normal
ly would] when faced with a newer opponent," said Stan
ford head coach Lele Forood. "But we knew UCLA
wasn't exactly going to cave, either. They have a lot of
good players and they're really solid despite our [match]
scores against them."
In singles, No. 10 Barnes went 3-0 during the week to

be named the NCAA tournament's Most Outstanding
Player.
"Alice was basically doing her thing and outmatching
all of her opponents," Forood said.

Corkery/ Warburg win NCAA doubles title
On a weekend that saw tornados sweep through Okla
homa, a couple of Cardinal men's tennis players caused a
storm of their own at the NCAA Championships.
After playing the best doubles teams in the country
through five grueling rounds, the seventh-seeded tandem
of sophomore K.C. Corkery and junior Sam Warburg cap
tured the 2004 NCAA doubles championship in Tulsa,
Okla., on Monday.
The Stanford dream team began their road to victory
on Thursday when they outplayed unseeded David
Goulet and Michael Kogan of Tulane, 5-7,6-4,6-4, in the
round of 32. It took less effort to take out Arizona's Roger
Matalonga and Colin O'Grady on Friday, 7-5,6-3.
Jumping into the quarterfinals, the Cardinal duo was
pitted against Calle Hansen and Pedro Rico of Pepper
dine. Corkery / Warburg easily defeated the unseeded
duo, 6-3,6-4.
Sunday was a beautiful day for the Stanford men, de
spite changing winds and tornado warnings.
Corkery / Warburg took the first set easily against
Clemson's Jermaine Jenkins and Nathan Thompson, but
the duo was unable to fight off the Tigers for long, losing
the second set 6-7 (5). The Stanford men came back to bat
tle their way to a nail-biting, 6-1,6-7 (5), 7-6 (9-7) victory.
The final step towards victory was taken when Corkery
and Warburg went up against Bo Hodge and John Isner of
Georgia on Monday afternoon. Once again, the Cardinal
men took the first set with ease, but were unable to hold
onto the second. They bounced back in the third, howev
er, capturing a 6-2,6-7,6-4 win and the championship.
"We started off well," Corkery said. "That's something
we've been doing all tournament we 11... We really want
ed to make them play and not give anything away in the
first couple of games, because it's very easy to be nervous
in the national championship.
Corkery and Warburg form the 14th Stanford men's
doubles team to capture an NCAA championship, ending
the year on a high note and giving head coach Dick Gould
a fantastic farewell present.
This season definitely had its ups and downs for the
Stanford men's team, though. The Cardinal was unable to
capture the NCAA team championship, and it is losing
Gould after 38 years of coaching excellence. The team
started out with a No. 5 ranking in the Intercollegiate Ten
nis Association preseason poll, but dropped to No. 8.
Gould will become Stanford's director of tennis next
year after handing off his head-coaching job to assistant
coach John Whitlinger. Gould has led the team to 17
NCAA championships and has been named Pac-10
Coach of the Year eight times. Gould will be sorely missed
out on the courts, but at least he will still be around for
many years to come.

Softball falls just short at
College World Series
After losing its first game at the Women's College
World Series, 8-2, to No. 2 UCLA on Thursday, the Car
dinal softball team looked like it might be headed toward
a quick exit from Oklahoma City this past weekend. If this
had been the case, the Cardinal would still have posted the
second-best season in school history.
Thursday predictions of the Cardinal's demise proved
to be premature, however, as Stanford battled back on
Saturday to post two straight wins against the No. 6 and
No. 1 seeds, respectively, before falling in a national semi
final rematch against UCLA.

Saturday's wins set up a Sunday rematch versus No. 2
UCLA in the national semifinals, and the Cardinal put up
a valiant effort behind an amazing performance by
Sorensen in the circle. Sorensen pitched all 12 innings of a
marathon, extra-innings nail-biter before finally succumb
ing to the dangerous UCLA lineup in the 12th in a season
ending loss to the Bruins, 3-1. UCLA advanced to the na
tional championship game with the victory.
Despite Sunday's disappointment, there was much to
be proud of for the Cardinal this year in a season that went
above and beyond anyone's expectations.
The Cardinal's 49 wins were the second-highest total in
school history, and its 13 conference wins were the most by
a Stanford team since the Pacific-10 switched to a2l -game
schedule in 2000. Even more impressively, the Cardinal
finished this year tied for second in the Pac-10 — the best
conference finish in the history of the program.

This year's NCAA Regional win and subsequent
WCWS berth was only the second in school history, and
the two wins in Oklahoma by this year's squad matched
the Cardinal's 2001 World Series team. Considering the
team's goal all season was to make the Series, this year's
ultimate result — an extra-innings loss in the national
semifinals — was a success by any measure.
One thing is certain: the 2005 Stanford Softball team
will have a lot to live up to, following one of the best sea
sons in the history of the program.
