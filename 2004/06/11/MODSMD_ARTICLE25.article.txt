# Looking ahead, baseball has plenty of big shoes to fill

The baseball season ended quite
prematurely for the Stanford baseball
team after being eliminated by Long
Beach State in NCAA Regional play
and denied the chance to return to
Omaha for the sixth consecutive year.
In some sense, it marks the end of
an era with the departure of five se
niors crucial to the Cardinal's recent
success. But that doesn't take away
from Stanford's regular season ac
complishments nor does it mean they
won't have enough coming back next
year to make another postseason run.
Stanford won its second consecu
tive outright Pacific-10 Conference
title with its second-best regular sea
son ever, winning 44 games. It was
Stanford's 10th straight 40-win sea

son, a school record.
"This was a really special team,"
said Stanford manager Mark Mar
quess. "Our record was pretty unbe
lievable given our difficult schedule."
The Cardinal has been No. 1 or No.
2 in the Baseball America poll since
Feb. 23.
Sophomore second baseman Jed
Lowrie emerged as one of the top play
ers in the country and was named Pac
-10 Player of the Year. Lowrie led the
Cardinal in average (.399), runs (72),
doubles (19), home runs (17), RBIs
(68), slugging percentage (.734), walks
(50) and on-base percentage (.505).
His bid to become only the seventh
player in school history to bat over
.400 fell short after a tough weekend.
Lowrie was modest 5-for-17 in four
games but had only one hit in nine at
bats in two games against Long Beach

State. Still, his .399 average ranks sev
enth best in school history.
Next year, Lowrie will be the cen
terpiece of an offense that will lose two
thirds of its starting lineup to gradua
tion and the professional baseball draft.
Third baseman Jonny Ash, center
fielder Sam Fuld and right fielder
Brian Hall will all graduate, and many
expect three juniors to leave the Farm
after the draft: left fielder Danny Put
nam, designated hitter Chris Carter
and catcher Donny Lucy.
Taken together, these six players
accounted for 61 percent of both Stan -
ford's hits and runs. Outside of Lowrie
and sophomore first baseman John
Mayberry Jr., the Cardinal will lose
every other big power threat it's got.
To put things in perspective, Stan
ford finished six home runs shy of tying
the school record for homers in a sea

son (102) set in 1997. It was the most
home runs the Cardinal had hit in a
season since 1990, when Jeffrey Ham
monds and company belted 93 homers.
Also, Stanford's team average of .324
was the third best in school history.
"Our seniors meant so much to
this program," Marquess said.
"They've contributed so much the
last four years."
Stanford is a youth-heavy team,
with 12 sophomores and 12 freshmen
returning next year. The Cardinal will
return top pitchers Mark Romanczuk
and Jeff Gilmore as well as top reliever
Kodiak Quick — who might be the
new closer in place of O'Hagan — and
starting shortstop Chris Minaker, who
came on strong late in the season with
the bat.
Looking further ahead, several
Cardinal freshmen players showed

the potential to make an impact in the
coming years.
Left-handed starter Blake Holler
picked up two saves in his first two re
lief appearances and then won his first
two starts, including the rubber game
against nationally-ranked Texas.
Holler was up-and-down the rest of
the season but finished strong, allow
ing only seven runs in his last 15 and 2
/ 3 innings of work with 20 strikeouts
and only six walks.
"I really learned how to pitch this
year, how to find hitters' weaknesses,"
he said. "We just have to take the anger
we have now with losing and carry it
into next season and get better."
Right-handed reliever Jeff Stimp
son pitched 12 and 1 / 3 innings to start
his collegiate career but struggled in
Pac-10 play. Stanford will need him to
regain his confidence and emerge as a

set-up man for Quick in the near future.
Ryan Seawell made six starts at des
ignated hitter and hit .333 with seven
RBIs, five runs and two doubles. He
will likely start as a corner outfielder
next year since Stanford will lose all
three of this year's starting outfielders.
"Almost every freshman at one
point or another has shown the ability
to be an everyday player this year,"
Holler said. "It's just a matter of get
ting more consistent."
Matt Leva had his first career com
plete game Saturday night against St.
John's, which could be a sign of things
to come. Greg Reynolds was highly
recruited but had a 6.00 ERA in 11 ap
pearances.
Stanford struggled to find a third
starter all year, and it has to hope
Holler, Reynolds or Leva emerges
next fall as a more solid option.
Infielder Adam Sorgi was also a
big recruit hut was heaten out hy Mi
naker for the shortstop job. Sorgi
could regain his spot and move Mi
naker to third with a good showing in
the fall. Hard-throwing right-hander
Pete Duda will also try to build on the
limited action he saw.
As always, Stanford should have
another solid recruiting class coming
to Palo Alto next fall.
Their top player might be 6-foot-5,
234-pound outfielder Michael Taylor
from Apopka, Fla. Taylor is the No. 8
overall high school prospect accord
ing to Baseball America. It is still un

known whether Taylor will sign a pro
fessional contract or play at Stanford
next year.
(According to Baseball America,
he boasts an America Online screen
name and e-mail that imply his wish to
come to Stanford and recently told the
publication that he had some con
structive conversations with members
of the Political Science Department.)
The other impact hitter from the
recruiting class is Randy Molina, a 6-
foot-2 left-handed third baseman
from South Gate, Calif.
Stanford's best pitching recruit is
Erik Davis, a 6-foot-2 right-hander
from nearby Mountain View. Davis
was rated the No. 15 prospect by
Baseball America and has a fastball
in the low-90s with some sink, but
changes speeds well with an ad
vanced changeup.
"It's always exciting to get a new
class," Marquess said. "It's also al
ways a big adjustment,so we'll see
where they're at in the fall."
