## Defining happiness 
### 
The following columns are the reflections of seniors who have contributed their time to The Daily.

ARISHA HATCH

The hardest piece of advice to
stomach when you're a senior
trying to figure out what's
next is: "Do what makes you
happy."
What the hell does that mean?
It's one of those statements that res
onates with you when you feel lost, tak
ing an almost philosophical-shape when
you fundamentally evaluate it.
What is happiness? Will we ever
know it? And am it ever really he
achieved'.' And if happiness can he real
ized, will we recognize it? Appreciate it?
Miss it when it's gone?
I have this friend. Sophomore year
she was toying with the notion that hap
piness was, perhaps, an unfair social
construct — unachievable in its grand
ness. But then she randomly tix>k Por
tuguese I. went to Rio fora year, came

back really tan/fluent, met the love of
her life at — of all places — The Nut
House and, whether or not she's willing
to admit it, seems happier than she's
ever been.
1 ain't help but believe (and hope)
that her experience is indicative of the
way many cyniail people eventually
achieve happiness - completely unex
pectedly and without intention.
As Stanford students, I feel like
we're taught that success at the academy
will lead to success in our careers and ul
timately to some realized form of happi
ness in our personal lives. And 1 think
you really have to buy into that notion in
order to stay motivated here.
But really, for me, that's a terrifying
idea — that the things we do today, the
people we are today, truly influence
who we am become. And despite all the

activities I've been a part of here, 1 still
have this fear that I didn't do enough —
that 1 didn't take Stanford, the academy,
seriously enough and that the rest of my
life has already been affected by that.
For the last four years, I've been writing
for The Daily first and studying second,
all while knowing that journalism would
never be enough for me.
And now as I write my final piece for
this newspaper, I suppose, in retrospect,
that Stanford and The Daily — the two
will always remain intertwined in my
mind - have been worth it to me, that I
reached some heightened level of hap
piness somewhere along the way, com
plicated at times, and masked by stress
and frustration at others.
I don't know how I ended up work
ing here. Some of as liken the paper to a
black hole, of sorts - some unknown

mechanism that sucks you in. becomes
addictive and then one day you look up
and you're working 40-plas hours a
week as a managing editor in conjunc
tion with full course loads and honors
theses left to complete.
I was a columnist my freshman year,
thinking naively that that would be the
extent of my journalism career until
three months later a position to cover
the men's basketball team opened up
and 1 couldn't resist. The years just flew
by after that, while I spent hours waiting
in locker rooms and traveling to obscure
places like Pullman, Washington, all to
find myself as one of the only women on
press row.
Four years later, my resume looks
pretty cool but I remain haunted - lit
erally haunted - by the idea that I'm
not prepared for life outside the Stan

ford bubble, in which it didn t matter
so much who you were - your goals,
your dreams for the future - as much
St mattered that you were here, doing
something.
But I guess that's Stanford's little
secret.
On the inside you have 1.500 inse
cure seniors, unaware of the paths their
lives will take, while outsiders see these
kids who've done amazing things, have
amazing minds and who have worlds at
their disposal.
In reality. I know so many graduat
ing seniors whose plans include moving
back home and working in the local Ba
nana Republic while they search for
"better career opportunities" or try to
figure out what the hell they want to do
with their lives.
What? Are you kidding me?

Stanford forgot to tell us during
Admit Weekend that many of us would
walk away from this place feeling more
lost than we've ever felt — that this uni
versity. in all its prestige, doesn't neces
sarily produce confident individuals
who graduate understanding—truly un
derstanding—their place in the world, what
they're meant to be.
Some of us walk away from this institu
tion holding no map to the place where hap
piness lies.
1 suppose it'sup to ustofindourwaynow.
Here's wishing you, the Class of 2004, all
the best on that journey, because it has to
exist somewhere.
Right?
It just has to.

For the last four years, I've been writing
for The Daily first and studying second,
all while knowing that journalism would
never be enough for me.
And now as I write my final piece for
this newspaper, I suppose, in retrospect,
that Stanford and The Daily — the two
will always remain intertwined in my
mind - have been worth it to me, that I
reached some heightened level of hap
piness somewhere along the way, com
plicated at times, and masked by stress
and frustration at others.
I don't know how I ended up work
ing here. Some of as liken the paper to a
black hole, of sorts - some unknown

mechanism that sucks you in. becomes
addictive and then one day you look up
and you're working 40-plas hours a
week as a managing editor in conjunc
tion with full course loads and honors
theses left to complete.
I was a columnist my freshman year,
thinking naively that that would be the
extent of my journalism career until
three months later a position to cover
the men's basketball team opened up
and 1 couldn't resist. The years just flew
by after that, while I spent hours waiting
in locker rooms and traveling to obscure
places like Pullman, Washington, all to
find myself as one of the only women on
press row.
Four years later, my resume looks
pretty cool but I remain haunted - lit
erally haunted - by the idea that I'm
not prepared for life outside the Stan

ford bubble, in which it didn t matter
so much who you were - your goals,
your dreams for the future - as much
St mattered that you were here, doing
something.
But I guess that's Stanford's little
secret.
On the inside you have 1.500 inse
cure seniors, unaware of the paths their
lives will take, while outsiders see these
kids who've done amazing things, have
amazing minds and who have worlds at
their disposal.
In reality. I know so many graduat
ing seniors whose plans include moving
back home and working in the local Ba
nana Republic while they search for
"better career opportunities" or try to
figure out what the hell they want to do
with their lives.
What? Are you kidding me?

Stanford forgot to tell us during
Admit Weekend that many of us would
walk away from this place feeling more
lost than we've ever felt — that this uni
versity. in all its prestige, doesn't neces
sarily produce confident individuals
who graduate understanding—truly un
derstanding—their place in the world, what
they're meant to be.
Some of us walk away from this institu
tion holding no map to the place where hap
piness lies.

Here's wishing you, the Class of 2004, all
the best on that journey, because it has to
exist somewhere.
Right?
It just has to.

The following columns are the reflections of seniors who have contributed their time to The Daily.

ARISHA HATCH

The hardest piece of advice to
stomach when you're a senior
trying to figure out what's
next is: "Do what makes you
happy."
What the hell does that mean?
It's one of those statements that res
onates with you when you feel lost, tak
ing an almost philosophical-shape when
you fundamentally evaluate it.
What is happiness? Will we ever
know it? And am it ever really he
achieved'.' And if happiness can he real
ized, will we recognize it? Appreciate it?
Miss it when it's gone?
I have this friend. Sophomore year
she was toying with the notion that hap
piness was, perhaps, an unfair social
construct — unachievable in its grand
ness. But then she randomly tix>k Por
tuguese I. went to Rio fora year, came

back really tan/fluent, met the love of
her life at — of all places — The Nut
House and, whether or not she's willing
to admit it, seems happier than she's
ever been.
1 ain't help but believe (and hope)
that her experience is indicative of the
way many cyniail people eventually
achieve happiness - completely unex
pectedly and without intention.
As Stanford students, I feel like
we're taught that success at the academy
will lead to success in our careers and ul
timately to some realized form of happi
ness in our personal lives. And 1 think
you really have to buy into that notion in
order to stay motivated here.
But really, for me, that's a terrifying
idea — that the things we do today, the
people we are today, truly influence
who we am become. And despite all the

activities I've been a part of here, 1 still
have this fear that I didn't do enough —
that 1 didn't take Stanford, the academy,
seriously enough and that the rest of my
life has already been affected by that.
