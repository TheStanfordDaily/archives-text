ANNA GALAN

Admit it, you've all watched
at least one. No, I'm not
talking about the videos in
the curtained-off section of
your local video rental store. These are
films that make it into the new release,
drama or comedy section: They're
mainstream, cheesy, Hollywood rendi
tions of life as a journalist.
Whether it's the classic "All the
President's Men,'' 4()s fizzler "I Love
Trouble" (with my hero Julia
Roberts) or. more recently, "Bridget
Jones's Diary" or "How to Lose a
Guy in 10 Days," there's no shortage
of movies about reporters. Like the
films or not, I've seen them all. lust
ed after the cute offices (newspapers
are never that clean in real life, espe

cially not The Daily), designer
clothes and demanding yet oh-so
lovable bosses.
But there was always an element
about these representations that trou
bled me: the on-screen reporters con
sistently had to go through some sort of
life-changing, movie-worthy struggle.
Their daily routines were transformed
into the once-in-a-lifetime story that
everything — including morals, friends
and any trace of a normal life - had to be
dropped for.
You remember Drew Barry
more's character in "Never Been
Kissed," who po«ed as a high-school
student for her big-break undercover
reporting assignment.
Or what about Winona Ryder in

"Mr. Deeds," who pretended to be a
school nurse from Winchester ...
ton . . . field . . . ville, Iowa?
Through all the various plots' twists
and turns, there was an element of
the predictable: (hunky) man, a few
lapses in judgment, and in the end.
the characters learn their lesson and
become moral, contributory mem
bers of society.
But that's just the movies. In the real
world, not everything can end up hap
pily ever after, right?
Despite growing up with these ac
tors for role models (if we can call them
that), my desire to be a professional
journalist has held fast. I'm not sure ex
actly why. Maybe it's the challenge of
getting people to tell me their deepest.

darkest secrets, or just the fact that I'm
fascinated by the details of others'
lives. When people ask what I want to
do with my life (the questions are be
coming fewer of "what do you want to
do when you grow up," and more like,
"what are you doing, say, next
week?"), I often evoke surprise in oth
ers when they hear me say the words
"journalist" and "want to be one" in
the same sentence.
Perhaps in our culture, media pro
fessionals have become the new
"lawyer" or "used car salesman."
Recent events like the Jayson Blair
scandal and Iraqi war coverage have
done little to help elevate the image
of reporters, and buzz words like
"media bias" or "sensationalism"

seem to be topics that our professors
can discuss endlessly.
So why, in Hollywood, do reporters
both get a bad rap while simultaneous
ly providing such fascination? Films
about investment bankers and medical
students don't provide enough comic
relief? Aren't there plenty of other
professions for our favorite movie stars
to play?
Maybe reporters represent some
sense of adventure. It's not feasible
to imagine ourselves stepping into
the shoes of Bruce Willis; but step
ping into a newsroom? That's much
more realistic.
While these films have done little to
instruct me on what it's really like to be
a journalist, they have prompted me to

wonder: what's my big story going to
be? How will my morals stand up to
the test? Working for The Daily has
taught me a lot, but then again, Stan
ford's so pristine that there have been
few "big" stories for me to uncover
(bloodthirsty and ravenous journalist
that 1 am).
It's sad to think that I'm forever
leaving the comfort of Stanford and
The Daily. It's scary, it's exciting — and
on second thought, I'm dying for one of
those mini video cameras that fit into a
fake flower pinned to my shirt.

Anna Galan will graduate with a degree
in communication.
