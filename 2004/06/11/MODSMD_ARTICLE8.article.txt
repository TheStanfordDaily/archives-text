# Stepping forward

MARK DOMINIK

I 'm not a journalist, yet I have
spent a great deal of time at the
Storke Student Publications
Building over the past four years.
It's not because of the great pay of
fered bv Stanford's only daily newspa
per. And it's not because of the great
fringe benefits. It's because of the
many dedicated, hard-working people
I have had the pleasure to work with
over the past four years, and because
working at the newspaper is one of the
best learning experiences I have had at
Stanford.
When I first came into Daily 101X
four years ago, I stood in awe of these

nior editors of the paper. The Editor in
Chief worked 60 hours a week, and it
seemed like she was going to class as
well. Managing Editors were here daily
from 5 p.m. to midnight. The paper was
so big and professional.
I remember the first time an article
1 wrote appeared on the front page. It
discussed the widening of Sand Hill
Road - that perpetually-clogged corri
dor of business parks at the west edge of
Stanford. It was nothing special. The or
ganization wasn't great. The language
was vague. There were few sources
who would go on the record about this
"controversial" road renovation. But it

was my first foray into the world of col
legiate journalism. and the thrill of see
ing my work on the front page of the
paper never subsided.
Following mv freshman stint as a
news writer, I moved around the
paper a lot. Fora volume, I was a fea
tures editor, in charge of articles about
local candy stores and cactus gardens.
Then I got some advanced training in
invective, when I spent a volume in
the opinions department. My opin
ions were reigned in again as a news
editor. Then, I spent the first half of
this year living at the Daily (0.k., I only
actually slept here once) when I was

managing editor of special sections.
And now, in a glorious sunset ap
pointment, I lay out the paper once a
week.
The Stanford Daily has taught me a
number of important lessons, but the
most important one is about organiza
tion. You wouldn't know it from look
ing at my room, but I've learned a lot
about organization from my experi
ence at the student newspaper. I've
learned about organizing a story; about
organizing a group of seven editors and
40 writers; about organizing a 40-hour a
week job and 8 classes (none of which
was EDGE).

But now, graduation has arrived.
My years at Stanford have come to a
close.
The word "graduation" conjures
up images of finality - wizened students
driving down palm drive with cars
crammed full of their life's belongings.
But as I see it, graduation is just anoth
er step in the journey of life. As a bud
ding philologist, I even have evidence
to substantiate my claim: The word
"graduation" comes from the me
dieval latin graduare, which means to
step forward. Next year, I hope to con
tinue stepping forward, as I move to
France to go to graduate school. Life is

a journey, and I've enjoyed every
minute of it. I'm a little afraid, and very
excited, to take the next step in the
journey, and hope that it will be the
"commencement" of something great.
hue vina et unguenta et nimium brevis
flores amoenae ferre iube rosae,
dum res et aetas et sororum
fila trium patiuntur atra.
