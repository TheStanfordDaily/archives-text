ERIN ARCHERD

Three cans of cherry coke (the
name-brand, not the store
brand knockoffs), three
Smirnoff Ices, one Mike's
Hard Lemonade, one bottle of two
buck Chuck (chardonnav, I rarely drink
red wine) and one bottle of champagne.
Very classy.
Maybe in the real world, you can tell
a lot about a person by what they have in
the fridge. 1 hope that rule does not apply
in college.
The champagne, however, reminds
me of my dorm's staff retreat, nearly
nine months ago. I'm the RAin Yost
and we decided to save money and go
stay with my grandmother in the Napa

Valley.
It was fabulous. On a whim, we
drove up a winding mountain road to a
hidden winery, and my RF convinced
the owners to give us a tour of the winery
— complete with a complimentary tast
ing— even though they'd already
closed for the day.
I've been meaning to find a way to
plug Schramsberg all year. Great Cali
fornia champagne. 1 highly recommend
it for your special occasions.
I've grown up in the Bay Area, and
while I'm not leaving immediately after
graduation, there's something inside
urging me to go east. Whether toward
D.C. or toward China, I couldn't tell you.

Knowing I'm going to leave has
made me think more and more about
why I love Stanford and Northern Cali
fornia so much. A similar nostalgia over
came me my final days in Oxford.
I couldn't wait to come back from
Oxford. I liked the people in the Stan
ford House. I liked the French presses
full of coffee at Grand Cafe and the pay
by-the-Bpound marvels of Ben's Cook
ies. I liked the ancient desks at the li
braries and watching Countdown dur
ing teatime.
But it was cold, dark and wet all the
time. British food surpassed its deep
fried, meat and potatoes reputation.
And evervone hated Americans.

If it weren't for Evensong, I proba
bly wouldn't have made it through the
quarter.
And yet that final weekend, as I
walked around Oxford and looked at
the buildings, I marveled that I had
learned to negotiate the twisted alleys
and secret cut-throughs. I noticed gar
goyles peeping from waterspouts and
the displays in the windows of Black
wells. I finally found a good Thai
restaurant.
I almost wished I had decided to
stay.
My first taste of Mexican food near
ly cured me of the Oxford nostalgia, but
every so often it comes creeping back.

I imagine this nostalgia will be much
more intense when looking back at
Northern California — my grandmas
house in Calistoga, Bean Hallow (my fa
vorite beach on Half Moon Bay), the
view of San Francisco from Treasure Is
land, gazing across the Bay toward home
from the foothills by The Dish, the pearl
tea on Castro Street, people-watching in
the Quad, rallies with the Band and late,
late nights at The Daily.
I want to find a way to say goodbye
to all that in this column. To bring some
closure to that foggy morning at the
Lawrence Hall of Science, rolling on the
floor laughing hysterically in the aimer
triple, weekly brunches at Cafe Barrone,

playing dumb to the security guards on
the golf course of the Half Moon Bay
Ritz. the haunting beauty of choral
music sung in MemChu. my first real
kiss.
If 1 lose these memories, then maybe
I'll be able to escape the Bay Area.
Maybe it won't always remain with me
in my heart, like an anchor dragging me
back again, no matter how far I go.
Yet somehowm I doubt I'll ever lose
these memories. They'll come creeping
back. And, I suspect, someday so will I.

Erin Archerd is graduating with a degree
