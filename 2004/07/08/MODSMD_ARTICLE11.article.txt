Black Student Union clarifies its intent
in funding Husbands / Schwartz
Many of you saw The Stanford Daily's
article entitled "BSU illegally funds Hus
bands / Schwartz". The Black Student
Union's action was a mistake made due
to a lack of detailed familiarity with
ASSU campaign funding policies. Our
organization was not trying to circum
vent regulations in order to unfairly sup
port candidates. We thought there was
nothing wrong with our actions at the
time of the transaction. The campaign
approached us for help, and as a sup
porter of the campaign, we chose to ex
press our endorsement in this manner.
Usually when transactions are not legal
ly fundable by special fees, the ASSU will re
ject the transaction request, and this did
not happen when we requested the funds
for the campaign.
We realize that our error cannot be
undone, but in order to remedy the fi
nancial situation, the BSU core is refund
ing the amount reimbursed using our
personal funds.

Community members offer insights on
elections revelations
As an iilum and a former ASSU senator, I've
been watching the current election process
with some interest. However, it appears that it
has gradually disintegrated from an earnest
process of reflection and investigation into the
school's election practices to meaningless mud
slinging, which is disappointing.
Most recently, there have been allegations of
misuse of BSU special-fees funds in connection
with the Husbands / Schwartz campaign.
While lx)th candidates admit to use of these spe
cial-fees Rinds, the only evidence that this was
"illegal" as stilted repeatedly in The Daily article
is diat there is a clause in the joint By-Laws
which states that, special fee money should be
spent "in accordance with its budget as audio
rized by t he members of the Association."
However, it has been made clear, after
speaking with current BSU members, that
as the money was taken from the General
Advertising fund within the BSU account,
this is not a violation of the Joint Bylaws, as
the money was in fact used for advertising.
Those who argue that there is not a specific
"executive slate Rinding" line item have ob
viously never run an organization at Stan
ford. As a former BSU treasurer and ASSU
appropriations committee member, groups
are always forced to use money for things
which come up over the year, which is why
groups are allowed to have general line
items like the general advertising funds to
deal with such eventualities.
As for those who would equate this use of
funds with corruption, where is the cor
ruption? Does The Chappie not use special
fees? Doesn't The Chappie then endorse
its candidates? The idea of special fees is
not that every student should be able to
agree with every action done by a student
group but rather that they think the group
in general does good work that the school
can benefit from. Using The Chappie as an
example, should I take away their special
fee because they make a bad joke? Can the

BSU not campaign for affirmative action
because some students might not agree
with their principles?
And it would be negligent of me not to
mention The Daily itself — as an organi
zation which receives special fees, how can
it then print endorsements for candidates
— on special fee provided paper — when
every student paid for the paper to be run,
and then speak of "corruption," when a
member of the editorial staff is running
for president?
The idea of campaign spending limits is
to cap spending such that wealthy students
cannot use excessive sums of money to cam
paign, thus squeezing out less fortunate stu
dents. If a student group can help a slate
reach their campaign spending limit, so
much the better — this takes their financial
means out of the equation and leaves them
to campaign on their ideals. Ideally, all slates
would be given an automatic allotment from
the ASSU once they are certified to run, leav
ing the election completely even.
I hope that these allegations will be sum
marily dismissed by the ASSU as they have
no official grounds with which to entertain
them. In addition, I hope that the individu
als who made the above allegations of "ille
gal" activity will withdraw their statements.

The BSU has made public a response to
the Daily article that revealed that they had
illegally donated funds from their special
fees to the Husbands / Schwartz campaign.
They admit they made a mistake and that
they didn't realize that special-fees money
is forbidden for political campaigns.
Undoubtedly, this is true — it's unlikely
that they would intentionally violate ASSU
rules. On the other hand, this response
shows how the special-fees system has been
systematically misused: Originally it was in
tended for the use of students groups in ways
that would benefit the entire student body.
In this case, however, the special fees were
going to support a particular group's politi
cal agenda in the ASSU. Seemingly, it never
even occurred to anyone in the group that
this might be a violation of ASSU rules.
What's even worse is the preface to their
letter: The BSU co-chairs who signed this
letter apparently don't even consider that
their initial conduct was outrageous
enough to warrant a Daily article. Clearly,
it instead must have been a racially-moti
vated attack on the BSU itself. By calling
this attack on their own behavior "an attack
on the black community," the co-chairs
clearly hope to rally black students at Stan
ford around them to shield them from pub
lic disapproval for their actions. Stanford
should not be fooled: This is nothing but an
attempt to avoid the consequences of their
own egregious conduct.

This whole dilemma with the ASSU pres
idency is pure comedy. First, the results cor
roborating the fact that Lee / Mefford won
originally are disqualified. Next, there are
the special elections for which Husbands/
Schwartz do not run. Lee/Mefford bring
two cases against the ASSU Senate to have
them reconsider their believed right to the
ASSU presidency. Both cases fail and there

suits of the special election are certified.
Amusingly enough, we uncover that the
Husbands/Schwartz slate received illegal
funding from the BSU. Here enters the ed
itorial board that has been steadily support
ing the Lee / Mefford cause. The editorial
board initially called for the Lee/Mefford
results to be certified. Now, the editorial
board writes that Daniel Stringer should
step down from his position as chair of the
Appropriations Committee for making a
mistake, and to a certain extent, recall the
whole ASSU Senate for being co-conspira
tors in the plot against Lee / Meflord. The
whole thing is extremely hilarious! Why?
Because Lee / Meflord won't catch a break.
After all is said and done, Lee / Mefford
won't hold the executive position in the
ASSU next year. What 1 suggest they do is
try to till some of the vacancies in the ASSU
Senate and stop crying over the spilled milk
and clean it up. 1 know it's hard to move on
in light of this alleged "injustice." I felt that
same way when Gore lost the 2000 elections
and have been feeling the pain for the past
four years with "W" in office. Unfortunately,
we have to face reality. Lee / Mefford lost.
Husbands / Schwartz lost. Chioke/Kory
won. And that, my friends, is the punch line.

Editor's note,: To claiify the editorial board's
stance on this issue, the editorial board actually
initially called for the election to be thrown out
due to the rules violations. However, it was stip
ulated in this first edit that if the results of the first
election were ever released— which they later
were — the first election should then be certified.
What exactly leads The Daily to believe
that students give a damn about the cur
rent ASSU election mess? We care next to
nothing about the ASSU to begin with — in
an informal poll of friends and dormmates,
I've found not one person who could name
the current executives, let alone anything
they've done this year for the student body.
Given that we couldn't care less about who
wins the election, your coverage of the endless
array of election challenges, "scandals," and
infractions against ASSU Bylaws (which, I
would imagine, occur because few people care
enough about ASSU Bylaws to read them in
the first place) is a ridiculous waste of space.
At the very least, take these stories off the
front page. Stop feeding the egos of small
time scandal-mongers and write about
something that matters. Stop wasting prime
space with stories about the election — we
simply don't give a damn.

Effects of health benefit cuts on
retirees is too high a cost
This concerns the ominous Daily article
of May 28 on scheduled health benefits
"Cuts to Future Retirees".
I have a Web site that intends to grope
with these retiree issues: http://www.geod
ties.com/retireesofstanford/.
The University's announcement ap
pears to affect future retirees, and not those
of us already retired from Stanford. Stan
ford can do almost anything it wants with
retirees of any status, so there will be some
comparable action for those already re

tired. I have long felt that for retirees not to
organize in some form is irresponsible to
their own interest and to their cohorts.
What the University announced is that
health benefits will fx* reduced for everylx>dy.
Price rationing is Stanford's notion of equitable
health care for staff and faculty. Not mine.
Working employees of high income will be able
to keep up with this class-based wealth transfer
with no problem. Stanford's wealthy high
ranking insider employees don't care. They live
way above cost. Stanford's plan is regressive.
Who gets squeezed most in this planned
cost transfer are the lower paid employees
and the poorer retirees of the future, often
scheduled for living already at the poverty
level. For these "loyal employees", past or
present, when their health care benefit costs
rise, other essentials become unaffordable.
What Stanford is doing is limiting its lia
bility for the future, most particular limiting
overhead to operating expenses. Indemnifi
cation is what health care insurance is about -
asset protection. The question is whose assets
are being protected: the University's or the
employees? The medical establishment is
fully fully prepared to drive any of us into ab
ject poverty in the event of massive illness.
What Stanford has been assumed to do is to
make affordable options to protect employ
ees and retirees against catastrophic loss.
Most of us can pay our own medical bills, ab
sent some awful health failure that lingers.
1 have been reading Stanford's annual
employee and retiree literature on health
benefits for some years. There has not been
any language in these annual information
packets that limit employee or retiree
health benefits to a fixed dollar value by any
proscribed schedule projected into future
years. There certainly were dollar limits in
a given year. That limit was the cost of the
lowest cost plan, invariably Kaiser. The
University negotiated plans that included
such catastrophic asset protection.
If the University enters these agree
ments with a previously self-imposed dollar
subsidy limit, what does that do to the ne
gotiation on behalf of the employee? Be
yond protecting the University's operating
expenses, the employee or retiree asset
protection becomes at risk, protected only
by the employee's "ability to pay". The re
sult will inevitably be that lower income em
ployees's protection from the medical es
tablishment's police-enforced cost recovery
practices will be compromised. That is my
apprehension of the moment.

Editor's note,: To claiify the editorial board's

initially called for the election to be thrown out

What exactly leads The Daily to believe
that students give a damn about the cur

nothing about the ASSU to begin with — in

I've found not one person who could name

Given that we couldn't care less about who

Effects of health benefit cuts on
retirees is too high a cost
This concerns the ominous Daily article
of May 28 on scheduled health benefits
"Cuts to Future Retirees".
I have a Web site that intends to grope
with these retiree issues: http://www.geod
ties.com/retireesofstanford/.
The University's announcement ap
pears to affect future retirees, and not those
of us already retired from Stanford. Stan
ford can do almost anything it wants with
retirees of any status, so there will be some
comparable action for those already re

tired. I have long felt that for retirees not to
organize in some form is irresponsible to
their own interest and to their cohorts.
What the University announced is that
health benefits will fx* reduced for everylx>dy.
Price rationing is Stanford's notion of equitable
health care for staff and faculty. Not mine.
Working employees of high income will be able
to keep up with this class-based wealth transfer
with no problem. Stanford's wealthy high
ranking insider employees don't care. They live
way above cost. Stanford's plan is regressive.
Who gets squeezed most in this planned
cost transfer are the lower paid employees
and the poorer retirees of the future, often
scheduled for living already at the poverty
level. For these "loyal employees", past or
present, when their health care benefit costs
rise, other essentials become unaffordable.
What Stanford is doing is limiting its lia
bility for the future, most particular limiting
overhead to operating expenses. Indemnifi
cation is what health care insurance is about -
asset protection. The question is whose assets
are being protected: the University's or the
employees? The medical establishment is
fully fully prepared to drive any of us into ab
ject poverty in the event of massive illness.
What Stanford has been assumed to do is to
make affordable options to protect employ
ees and retirees against catastrophic loss.
Most of us can pay our own medical bills, ab
sent some awful health failure that lingers.
1 have been reading Stanford's annual
employee and retiree literature on health
benefits for some years. There has not been
any language in these annual information
packets that limit employee or retiree
health benefits to a fixed dollar value by any
proscribed schedule projected into future
years. There certainly were dollar limits in
a given year. That limit was the cost of the
lowest cost plan, invariably Kaiser. The
University negotiated plans that included
such catastrophic asset protection.
If the University enters these agree
ments with a previously self-imposed dollar
subsidy limit, what does that do to the ne
gotiation on behalf of the employee? Be
yond protecting the University's operating
expenses, the employee or retiree asset
protection becomes at risk, protected only
by the employee's "ability to pay". The re
sult will inevitably be that lower income em
ployees's protection from the medical es
tablishment's police-enforced cost recovery
practices will be compromised. That is my
apprehension of the moment.

Black Student Union clarifies its intent
in funding Husbands / Schwartz
Many of you saw The Stanford Daily's
article entitled "BSU illegally funds Hus
bands / Schwartz". The Black Student
Union's action was a mistake made due
to a lack of detailed familiarity with
ASSU campaign funding policies. Our
organization was not trying to circum
vent regulations in order to unfairly sup
port candidates. We thought there was
nothing wrong with our actions at the
time of the transaction. The campaign
approached us for help, and as a sup
porter of the campaign, we chose to ex
press our endorsement in this manner.
Usually when transactions are not legal
ly fundable by special fees, the ASSU will re
ject the transaction request, and this did
not happen when we requested the funds
for the campaign.
We realize that our error cannot be
undone, but in order to remedy the fi
nancial situation, the BSU core is refund
ing the amount reimbursed using our
personal funds.
BRAN DAN RICHARDSON AND JASMINE SMITH
BSU Co-Cham
Community members offer insights on
elections revelations
As an iilum and a former ASSU senator, I've
been watching the current election process
with some interest. However, it appears that it
has gradually disintegrated from an earnest
process of reflection and investigation into the
school's election practices to meaningless mud
slinging, which is disappointing.
Most recently, there have been allegations of
misuse of BSU special-fees funds in connection
with the Husbands / Schwartz campaign.
While lx)th candidates admit to use of these spe
cial-fees Rinds, the only evidence that this was
"illegal" as stilted repeatedly in The Daily article
is diat there is a clause in the joint By-Laws
which states that, special fee money should be
spent "in accordance with its budget as audio
rized by t he members of the Association."
However, it has been made clear, after
speaking with current BSU members, that
as the money was taken from the General
Advertising fund within the BSU account,
this is not a violation of the Joint Bylaws, as
the money was in fact used for advertising.
Those who argue that there is not a specific
"executive slate Rinding" line item have ob
viously never run an organization at Stan
ford. As a former BSU treasurer and ASSU
appropriations committee member, groups
are always forced to use money for things
which come up over the year, which is why
groups are allowed to have general line
items like the general advertising funds to
deal with such eventualities.
As for those who would equate this use of
funds with corruption, where is the cor
ruption? Does The Chappie not use special
fees? Doesn't The Chappie then endorse
its candidates? The idea of special fees is
not that every student should be able to
agree with every action done by a student
group but rather that they think the group
in general does good work that the school
can benefit from. Using The Chappie as an
example, should I take away their special
fee because they make a bad joke? Can the

BSU not campaign for affirmative action
because some students might not agree
with their principles?
And it would be negligent of me not to
mention The Daily itself — as an organi
zation which receives special fees, how can
it then print endorsements for candidates
— on special fee provided paper — when
every student paid for the paper to be run,
and then speak of "corruption," when a
member of the editorial staff is running
for president?
The idea of campaign spending limits is
to cap spending such that wealthy students
cannot use excessive sums of money to cam
paign, thus squeezing out less fortunate stu
dents. If a student group can help a slate
reach their campaign spending limit, so
much the better — this takes their financial
means out of the equation and leaves them
to campaign on their ideals. Ideally, all slates
would be given an automatic allotment from
the ASSU once they are certified to run, leav
ing the election completely even.
I hope that these allegations will be sum
marily dismissed by the ASSU as they have
no official grounds with which to entertain
them. In addition, I hope that the individu
als who made the above allegations of "ille
gal" activity will withdraw their statements.

The BSU has made public a response to
the Daily article that revealed that they had
illegally donated funds from their special
fees to the Husbands / Schwartz campaign.
They admit they made a mistake and that
they didn't realize that special-fees money
is forbidden for political campaigns.
Undoubtedly, this is true — it's unlikely
that they would intentionally violate ASSU
rules. On the other hand, this response
shows how the special-fees system has been
systematically misused: Originally it was in
tended for the use of students groups in ways
that would benefit the entire student body.
In this case, however, the special fees were
going to support a particular group's politi
cal agenda in the ASSU. Seemingly, it never
even occurred to anyone in the group that
this might be a violation of ASSU rules.
What's even worse is the preface to their
letter: The BSU co-chairs who signed this
letter apparently don't even consider that
their initial conduct was outrageous
enough to warrant a Daily article. Clearly,
it instead must have been a racially-moti
vated attack on the BSU itself. By calling
this attack on their own behavior "an attack
on the black community," the co-chairs
clearly hope to rally black students at Stan
ford around them to shield them from pub
lic disapproval for their actions. Stanford
should not be fooled: This is nothing but an
attempt to avoid the consequences of their
own egregious conduct.

This whole dilemma with the ASSU pres
idency is pure comedy. First, the results cor
roborating the fact that Lee / Mefford won
originally are disqualified. Next, there are
the special elections for which Husbands/
Schwartz do not run. Lee/Mefford bring
two cases against the ASSU Senate to have
them reconsider their believed right to the
ASSU presidency. Both cases fail and there

suits of the special election are certified.
Amusingly enough, we uncover that the
Husbands/Schwartz slate received illegal
funding from the BSU. Here enters the ed
itorial board that has been steadily support
ing the Lee / Mefford cause. The editorial
board initially called for the Lee/Mefford
results to be certified. Now, the editorial
board writes that Daniel Stringer should
step down from his position as chair of the
Appropriations Committee for making a
mistake, and to a certain extent, recall the
whole ASSU Senate for being co-conspira
tors in the plot against Lee / Meflord. The
whole thing is extremely hilarious! Why?
Because Lee / Meflord won't catch a break.
After all is said and done, Lee / Mefford
won't hold the executive position in the
ASSU next year. What 1 suggest they do is
try to till some of the vacancies in the ASSU
Senate and stop crying over the spilled milk
and clean it up. 1 know it's hard to move on
in light of this alleged "injustice." I felt that
same way when Gore lost the 2000 elections
and have been feeling the pain for the past
four years with "W" in office. Unfortunately,
we have to face reality. Lee / Mefford lost.

While lx)th candidates admit to use of these spe
cial-fees Rinds, the only evidence that this was
"illegal" as stilted repeatedly in The Daily article
is diat there is a clause in the joint By-Laws
which states that, special fee money should be
spent "in accordance with its budget as audio
rized by t he members of the Association."
However, it has been made clear, after
speaking with current BSU members, that
as the money was taken from the General
Advertising fund within the BSU account,
this is not a violation of the Joint Bylaws, as
the money was in fact used for advertising.
Those who argue that there is not a specific
"executive slate Rinding" line item have ob
viously never run an organization at Stan
ford. As a former BSU treasurer and ASSU
appropriations committee member, groups
are always forced to use money for things
which come up over the year, which is why
groups are allowed to have general line
items like the general advertising funds to
deal with such eventualities.
As for those who would equate this use of
funds with corruption, where is the cor
ruption? Does The Chappie not use special
fees? Doesn't The Chappie then endorse
its candidates? The idea of special fees is
not that every student should be able to
agree with every action done by a student
group but rather that they think the group
in general does good work that the school
can benefit from. Using The Chappie as an
example, should I take away their special
fee because they make a bad joke? Can the

BSU not campaign for affirmative action
because some students might not agree
with their principles?
And it would be negligent of me not to
mention The Daily itself — as an organi
zation which receives special fees, how can
it then print endorsements for candidates
— on special fee provided paper — when
every student paid for the paper to be run,
and then speak of "corruption," when a
member of the editorial staff is running
for president?
The idea of campaign spending limits is
to cap spending such that wealthy students
cannot use excessive sums of money to cam
paign, thus squeezing out less fortunate stu
dents. If a student group can help a slate
reach their campaign spending limit, so
much the better — this takes their financial
means out of the equation and leaves them
to campaign on their ideals. Ideally, all slates
would be given an automatic allotment from
the ASSU once they are certified to run, leav
ing the election completely even.
I hope that these allegations will be sum
marily dismissed by the ASSU as they have
no official grounds with which to entertain
them. In addition, I hope that the individu
als who made the above allegations of "ille
gal" activity will withdraw their statements.

the Daily article that revealed that they had
illegally donated funds from their special

They admit they made a mistake and that
they didn't realize that special-fees money
is forbidden for political campaigns.
Undoubtedly, this is true — it's unlikely
that they would intentionally violate ASSU
rules. On the other hand, this response
shows how the special-fees system has been
systematically misused: Originally it was in
tended for the use of students groups in ways
that would benefit the entire student body.
In this case, however, the special fees were
going to support a particular group's politi

this might be a violation of ASSU rules.
What's even worse is the preface to their

Effects of health benefit cuts on
retirees is too high a cost
This concerns the ominous Daily article
of May 28 on scheduled health benefits
"Cuts to Future Retirees".
I have a Web site that intends to grope
with these retiree issues: http://www.geod
ties.com/retireesofstanford/.
The University's announcement ap
pears to affect future retirees, and not those
of us already retired from Stanford. Stan
ford can do almost anything it wants with
retirees of any status, so there will be some
comparable action for those already re

tired. I have long felt that for retirees not to
organize in some form is irresponsible to
their own interest and to their cohorts.
What the University announced is that
health benefits will fx* reduced for everylx>dy.
Price rationing is Stanford's notion of equitable
health care for staff and faculty. Not mine.
Working employees of high income will be able
to keep up with this class-based wealth transfer
with no problem. Stanford's wealthy high
ranking insider employees don't care. They live
way above cost. Stanford's plan is regressive.
Who gets squeezed most in this planned
cost transfer are the lower paid employees
and the poorer retirees of the future, often
scheduled for living already at the poverty
level. For these "loyal employees", past or
present, when their health care benefit costs
rise, other essentials become unaffordable.
What Stanford is doing is limiting its lia
bility for the future, most particular limiting
overhead to operating expenses. Indemnifi
cation is what health care insurance is about -
asset protection. The question is whose assets
are being protected: the University's or the
employees? The medical establishment is
fully fully prepared to drive any of us into ab
ject poverty in the event of massive illness.
What Stanford has been assumed to do is to
make affordable options to protect employ
ees and retirees against catastrophic loss.
Most of us can pay our own medical bills, ab
sent some awful health failure that lingers.
1 have been reading Stanford's annual
employee and retiree literature on health
benefits for some years. There has not been
any language in these annual information
packets that limit employee or retiree
health benefits to a fixed dollar value by any
proscribed schedule projected into future
years. There certainly were dollar limits in
a given year. That limit was the cost of the
lowest cost plan, invariably Kaiser. The
University negotiated plans that included
such catastrophic asset protection.
If the University enters these agree
ments with a previously self-imposed dollar
subsidy limit, what does that do to the ne
gotiation on behalf of the employee? Be
yond protecting the University's operating
expenses, the employee or retiree asset
protection becomes at risk, protected only
by the employee's "ability to pay". The re
sult will inevitably be that lower income em
ployees's protection from the medical es
tablishment's police-enforced cost recovery
practices will be compromised. That is my
apprehension of the moment.

Black Student Union clarifies its intent
in funding Husbands / Schwartz
Many of you saw The Stanford Daily's
article entitled "BSU illegally funds Hus
bands / Schwartz". The Black Student
Union's action was a mistake made due
to a lack of detailed familiarity with
ASSU campaign funding policies. Our
organization was not trying to circum
vent regulations in order to unfairly sup
port candidates. We thought there was
nothing wrong with our actions at the
time of the transaction. The campaign
approached us for help, and as a sup
porter of the campaign, we chose to ex
press our endorsement in this manner.
Usually when transactions are not legal
ly fundable by special fees, the ASSU will re
ject the transaction request, and this did
not happen when we requested the funds
for the campaign.
We realize that our error cannot be
undone, but in order to remedy the fi
nancial situation, the BSU core is refund
ing the amount reimbursed using our
personal funds.

Community members offer insights on
elections revelations
As an iilum and a former ASSU senator, I've
been watching the current election process
with some interest. However, it appears that it
has gradually disintegrated from an earnest
process of reflection and investigation into the
school's election practices to meaningless mud
slinging, which is disappointing.
Most recently, there have been allegations of
misuse of BSU special-fees funds in connection
with the Husbands / Schwartz campaign.
While lx)th candidates admit to use of these spe
cial-fees Rinds, the only evidence that this was
"illegal" as stilted repeatedly in The Daily article
is diat there is a clause in the joint By-Laws
which states that, special fee money should be
spent "in accordance with its budget as audio
rized by t he members of the Association."

enough about ASSU Bylaws to read them in
the first place) is a ridiculous waste of space.
At the very least, take these stories off the
front page. Stop feeding the egos of small
time scandal-mongers and write about
something that matters. Stop wasting prime
space with stories about the election — we
simply don't give a damn.

Effects of health benefit cuts on
retirees is too high a cost
This concerns the ominous Daily article
of May 28 on scheduled health benefits
"Cuts to Future Retirees".
I have a Web site that intends to grope
with these retiree issues: http://www.geod
ties.com/retireesofstanford/.
The University's announcement ap
pears to affect future retirees, and not those
of us already retired from Stanford. Stan
ford can do almost anything it wants with
retirees of any status, so there will be some
comparable action for those already re

tired. I have long felt that for retirees not to
organize in some form is irresponsible to
their own interest and to their cohorts.
What the University announced is that
health benefits will fx* reduced for everylx>dy.
Price rationing is Stanford's notion of equitable
health care for staff and faculty. Not mine.
Working employees of high income will be able
to keep up with this class-based wealth transfer
with no problem. Stanford's wealthy high
ranking insider employees don't care. They live
way above cost. Stanford's plan is regressive.
Who gets squeezed most in this planned
cost transfer are the lower paid employees
and the poorer retirees of the future, often
scheduled for living already at the poverty
level. For these "loyal employees", past or
present, when their health care benefit costs
rise, other essentials become unaffordable.
What Stanford is doing is limiting its lia
bility for the future, most particular limiting
overhead to operating expenses. Indemnifi
cation is what health care insurance is about -
asset protection. The question is whose assets
are being protected: the University's or the
employees? The medical establishment is
fully fully prepared to drive any of us into ab
ject poverty in the event of massive illness.
What Stanford has been assumed to do is to
make affordable options to protect employ
ees and retirees against catastrophic loss.
Most of us can pay our own medical bills, ab
sent some awful health failure that lingers.
1 have been reading Stanford's annual
employee and retiree literature on health
benefits for some years. There has not been
any language in these annual information
packets that limit employee or retiree
health benefits to a fixed dollar value by any
proscribed schedule projected into future
years. There certainly were dollar limits in
a given year. That limit was the cost of the
lowest cost plan, invariably Kaiser. The
University negotiated plans that included
such catastrophic asset protection.
If the University enters these agree
ments with a previously self-imposed dollar
subsidy limit, what does that do to the ne
gotiation on behalf of the employee? Be
yond protecting the University's operating
expenses, the employee or retiree asset
protection becomes at risk, protected only
by the employee's "ability to pay". The re
sult will inevitably be that lower income em
ployees's protection from the medical es
tablishment's police-enforced cost recovery
practices will be compromised. That is my
apprehension of the moment.

Keeping perspective in the
current political climate
This surviving vet (France and Germany,
Combat Engineers) gratefully remembers
Eisenhower, who led us to victor) 7 ; he saw a
concentration camp and was shocked to his
soul: He then launched our post-Holocaust
awareness of penitent continuous " Judeo-
Christianity." Vatican II followed suit.
This is newly important as frightened
and confused masses, here (General Zinni,
et al.) and, especially, in France and Ger
many resort to the ancient psychotic temp
tation of scapegoating the Jews. Everybody
knows — Al Jazeera reminds them — that
they drink the blood of gentile children.
