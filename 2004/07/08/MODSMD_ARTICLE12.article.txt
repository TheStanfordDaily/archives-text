Stanford wins 10th consecutive
Sears Cup
Nearly everyone in the country
would love to see a school other tliiin
Stanford win the NACDA Division I Di
rector's Clip (also known as die Sears
Cup), if only for the sake of variety. By
the end of the 2002-03 season, the Car
dinal had been named the top D-I ath
letic program in the nation for the ninth
time in the Cup's nine-year existence.
So when Michigan leaped out to
an early lead in Sears Cup stand
ings-and still had a hold 011 that
lead in May-a few hearts lifted at
the idea of a new champion.
But a spring sport success surge
catapulted the Cardinal back into
first place in the standings-and
Stanford clinched its tenth straight
Director's Cup two lull weeks be
fore the official conclusion of the
Division I race.
When final points w ere tabulated 011
June 29, Stanford had amassed
1337.25 points from its 20 eligible
teams. In addition to the Cardinal's
three national champion squads-the
women's tennis and women's and
men's cross country teams-Stanford
had top-ten finishes in nine other
sports: men's swimming and diving
(second place), women's gymnastics
(third), sofiball (third) women's basket
ball (fifth), women's swimming and div
ing (fifth), men's tennis (fifth), women's
outdoor track and field (sixth), men's
gymnastics (seventh), women's volley
ball (ninth) and fencing (10th).
The Cardinal ended the 2003-04
race 111 points ahead of runner-up
Michigan, which scored in 18 sports,
with 14 top-10 finishes and no na
tional championships. UCLA came
in third in the standings, followed by
Ohio State and Georgia.
Tara Kirk becomes first
Stanford student to be named
Athlete of the Year
Giventhe fart that dominating die
Director's Cup competition is a
decade-long Stanford tradition, few
would guess that the Cardinal has
never had an NCAA Athlete of the
Year. Well, until this year, that is.
Stanford swimmer Tara Kirk be
came the first-ever (Cardinal athlete to
win die Honda-Broderick Award, the
honor given each year to the top male
and female athlete in the NCAA. Kirk
traveled to New York two weeks ago
for the award ceremony.
"I really believe in women's sports,
so it's a huge honor to win this award
and a real thrill for me," she said.
Kirk, a 2004 Olympic hopeful
in the breaststroke events, has
spent the past four years leaving
her mark on collegiate swimming.
She lays claim to the world record
in the 100 breaststroke (short
course meters) in addition to six
American records, 11 NCAA titles,
14 Pacific-10 Conference titles and
16 Ail-American honors.
Four other female athletes
were named finalists for the
Broderick Award along with
Kirk: North Carolina soccer star
Catherine Reddick, Southern
California volleyball standout
April Ross, Connecticut basket
ball marvel Diana Taurasi and
Florida State softball phenome
non Jessica van der Linden.
Taurasi, who led UConn to

three straight national champi
onships, declined to attend the
New York ceremony in order to
practice with her WNBA team. She
was declared ineligible for the
Broderick Award due to a rule stat
ing that the award cannot be pre
sented to an athlete absent from
the ceremony.
Josh Childress chosen in first
round of NBA draft
June seems to be the month of
making history for Stanford ath
letes, and basketball standout
Josh Childress was not one to be
left behind.
The 6-foot-7 forward entered
the draft early and was chosen in
with the sixth pick overall by the
Atlanta Hawks-the highest that
any Stanford player has ever
been selected into the NBA.
Childress is the fifth Cardinal
player chosen in the first round
in the last five years. (Mark Mad
sen, Jason Collins, Curtis Bor
chardt and Casey Jacobsen are

the other four.)
Stanford was 74-21 during Chil
dress's diree-year career on the
Farm. Childress was the first-ever
(Cardinal player named Pacific-10
(Conference Player of the Year dur
ing the 2003-04 season, and aver
aged 15.7 points with 7.5 rebounds
per game during the year.
To say that Atlanta has a club
in transition would be an under
statement. The Hawks were 28-
54 last season and haven't seen
the playoffs in the past five years.
Needless to say, Childress and the
other three Hawks newcomers
will have a challenge to lace in the
2004-05 season.
Childress spoke confidently,
however, during a press confer
ence two weeks ago.
"We're in a situation where
we're going to be part of the re
building process," he told re
porters. "The city of Atlanta is
ready for success from the Hawks.
That's the goal â€” to come out here
and bring that back to the organi
zation. It's just a good situation."
