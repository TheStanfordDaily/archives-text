Stanford wins 10th consecutive
Sears Cup
Nearly everyone in the country
would love to see a school other tliiin
Stanford win the NACDA Division I Di
rector's Clip (also known as die Sears
Cup), if only for the sake of variety. By
the end of the 2002-03 season, the Car
dinal had been named the top D-I ath
letic program in the nation for the ninth
time in the Cup's nine-year existence.
So when Michigan leaped out to
an early lead in Sears Cup stand
ings-and still had a hold 011 that
lead in May-a few hearts lifted at
the idea of a new champion.
But a spring sport success surge
catapulted the Cardinal back into
first place in the standings-and
Stanford clinched its tenth straight
Director's Cup two lull weeks be
fore the official conclusion of the
Division I race.
When final points w ere tabulated 011
June 29, Stanford had amassed
1337.25 points from its 20 eligible
teams. In addition to the Cardinal's
three national champion squads-the
women's tennis and women's and
men's cross country teams-Stanford
had top-ten finishes in nine other
sports: men's swimming and diving
(second place), women's gymnastics
(third), sofiball (third) women's basket
ball (fifth), women's swimming and div

outdoor track and field (sixth), men's
gymnastics (seventh), women's volley
ball (ninth) and fencing (10th).
The Cardinal ended the 2003-04
race 111 points ahead of runner-up
Michigan, which scored in 18 sports,
with 14 top-10 finishes and no na
tional championships. UCLA came
in third in the standings, followed by
Ohio State and Georgia.

Director's Cup competition is a
decade-long Stanford tradition, few
would guess that the Cardinal has
never had an NCAA Athlete of the
Year. Well, until this year, that is.
Stanford swimmer Tara Kirk be
came the first-ever (Cardinal athlete to
win die Honda-Broderick Award, the
