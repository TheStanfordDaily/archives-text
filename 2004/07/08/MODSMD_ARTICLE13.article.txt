nents 73-37, this season's Team
USA was 6-3 as of July 4. The team
swept a six-game series against
Canada but dropped three straight
to Japan's squad.
Lowrie and Mayberry-who are
both first-time Team USA selec
tions-are already showing the of
fensive potency that was such a
common sight at Sunken Dia
mond during the 2004 season.
Lowrie is batting at a .318 clip with
five RBI and one hoinerun, while
Mayberry is hitting .258 with six
RBI and one homer.
Romanczuk has some high ex
pectations to live up to, after he
went 5-0 with a 0.75 ERA for last
vear's Team USA But die south

paw is well on his way. Romanczuk
is 2-0 after (5 2/3 innings of work
widi a 1.35 ERA

The Alaska Baseball League
rounded up seven Cardinal play
ers, and the Mat-Su Miners claimed
three of those.
The righdianded hilrling duo of
risingjuniorsJeffGilmore and Matt
Manship has been working for die
Miners this summer. Manship has
yet to give up a run in his five in
nings of work, while Gilmore boasts
a 1.23 ERA after 7 1/3 innings.
Rising junior John Hester is also
behind the plate for die Miners and
is hitting a solid .227 with one jack
and five RBI.
The Kenai Peninsula Oilers
have two of the most effective
Cardinal so far this summer: ris
ing sophomore Matt Leva and
rising junior Chris Minaker.
Leva has thrown more innings
than any Cardinal pitcher this

suinmer, tossing 18 1/3 and
managing a 3.44 ERA. Minaker
has proven a power threat, bat
ting .321 with two roundtrip
pers and four doubles.
'Ihe Texas Collegiate Baseball
League is home to two Stanford play-

ers: rising junior Pete Duda and ris
ing sophomore Ryan Seawell. Duda
is 0-1 after 10 innings of work, despite
