Coach K passes on Lakers offer
A reported four-year, $10 million con
tract and the opportunity to coach the
Golden State Warriors was enough to lure
former Stanford basketball coach Mike
Montgomery away from the college ranks.
But when another college coaching legend
was offered the most dominant NBA team
of recent years (and a five year contract re
portedly worth $40 million), the NCAA
won the tug-of-war.
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski officially
turned down the head coaching offer from
the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday, saying
that he had to follow his heart-and his
heart has always been with the Blue Devils.
The 57-year-old Coach K-who has a
621-181 record and has led his squad to 10
Final Fours and three national titles-has
been approach by several NBA teams in
the past and nearly took a job coaching the
Boston Celtics 14 years ago. Krzyzewski's
players-not to mention his newest recruits
have expressed relief and gratitude at his

decision to remain at Duke.
ESPN reported that financial "modifi
cations" would be made to Krzyzewski's
lifetime contract at Duke, though certain
ly none that will near the offer made by
the Lakers.
Now that L.A.'s top candidate to fill Phil
Jackson's shoes has declined the job, the
search that began three days after the end
of the NBA Finals (the day that Jackson is
sued his resignation) rages on. It has been
reported that Kobe Bryant was adamant
that the Lakers hire Coach K, and the
team's failure to do so may affect its
chances of resigning Bryant. It is speculat
ed that Bryant will begin talks with the Los
Angeles Clippers some time this week.
Gagne's consecutive saves streak halted at 84
I here was Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hit
streak. Cal Ripken's 2,632 consecutive
game streak. And now Eric Gagne's con
secutive save streak drops itself into the
books as yet another untouchable streak in

baseball history.
Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium, the
Arizona Diamondbacks battled back from
a 5-3 deficit and forced Gagne into his first
blown save since September 2002. Ihe
crowd of more than 30,000 gave Gagne a
standing ovation the moment the streak
was over.
The Dodgers eventually claimed a 6-5
victory in extra-innings, but watching such
a long-standing streak fall made the win
bittersweet.
Gagne finished his streak with an MLB
record 84 successive saves. The previous
record was just 54, set in 1999 by loin
Gordon of the Boston Red Sox.
During his six years in the majors,
Gagne has only five blown saves-three ol
which have come against Arizona.
