# The 						delicate art of being a baseball fan
## 
### 
It's midsummer, which leads to a few unshakeable sports conclu
sions. NBA offseason signings are surpassing even their own
benchmarks of ridiculousness. (MehmetOkur? $50 million?) The
Cincinnati Bengals are oh-so-cute in their optimism about this sea
son's prospects. And the vast majority of the sports universe has dipped
below the horizon, leaving only the sweltering heat of baseball. MLB
highlights dominate Sports Center, and there's no better way to spend a
weekday evening than at Wrigley or Camden Yards or (cough) Network
Associates Coliseum. But if you're going to do it, do it right. The jackass
fan is the object of hatred for an entire section, and it is my duty to pre
sent you with the following guide to not being That Guy.
Before you do anything else, come to the ballpark prepared. This
doesn't mean you have to quote Sparky Anderson or calculate slugging per
centages on the fly, but know the rules and know the players on the home
team. Here I am speaking primarily to women, since at the ballpark this is
expected of men, and they know it. 'I here is a bare minimum of baseball

knowledge that comes in the Guy Handbook, along
with how to operate a barbecue, quotes from Sergio
I jeone films, and how to parallel-park. Failure to grasp
these fundamental concepts often leads to social os
tracism-and justifiably so. The dork who turns around
and asks the guy behind him why runners have to tag
up? Unless he is clearly foreign-bom or under die age
of fifteen, this should be grounds for castration.
'ITie second echelon of Ixdlpark etiquette de<ils with
appearance. First of all, if you're going to wear a hat, wear
the official team cap. Ihe novelty colored-hair wigs have
got to go. Baseball games are nothing if not casual, but

that doesn't mean you have to look like a less masculine rodeo down. Admit
tedly, tills may be a personal vendetta of'mine. Most of my t)aseball experience
has iDeen at Angel Stadium at Anaheim Angels Park, or whatever they're call
ing it now. \Mule most Angel fans are well-informed and professk)nal, we
seem to have an abundance of aging men in down wigs and that godawful
Rally Monkey, which is the worst sports-related use of monkeys since the
movie MVP: Most Valuable Primate.
Tasteful down wigs aside, feel free to peel off your sweat-and-ketchup
stained T-shirt and bask in die afternoon sun, particularly if you weigh 300
pounds or more. Fat men loafing in baseball stadiums is as much a part of
America as the Declaration of Independence. In fact, I dunk that's the back
of Missouri's state quarter - just a beer-bellied fanner in a Cardinals hat in
seat A27. And, for the love of God, do not bring your glove to the game un
less you are ten years old or in a wheelchair. Seriously, I bet when Joe
Twelvepack sits down in the centerfield stands and stuffs a meaty paw into
his Rawlings, part of Garret Anderson dies a little by association.
Now that you are informed enough to enjoy the game and you don't look
like a complete moron, it's time to address the second-best thing to do in the
park other than watch the game: drink. But beware, because the line be
tween the hilarious drunk guy and the obnoxious oaf who the entire section
hopes will choke on his own vomit later is a fine one. Hie seven dollar beer is
baseball's way of telling you that moderation is your friend.
Beer often has a way of leading to one of the fan's primary purposes: the
time-honored tradition of heckling. Like drinking, this Is a delicate issue,
in that if it's going to be done, it has to be done correcdy. Telling the um
pire that Ray Charles is interviewing for his job after the game is a plus, as
is the well-timed "You suck" or jokes about the home dty of the opposing
team. Screaming wildly at every play or exceeding the one-comment-per
inning limit? Unacceptable. Also, gauge the fan reaction around you. If
the line that was oh-so-witty in your mind is met with silence, it's probably
best to keep your mouth shut, because the guy four rows back just started
calculating die physics behind asphyxiating you widi a foam finger.
Fan-created banners are acceptable in the bleacher seats and no place else.
And if you're making an acrostic, don't slack off and use letters in the middle
of words; that's just lazy. Most ofall the >ugh, your sign must be funny and top
ical. Good example, for those of you angry about the Balco steroid scandal:
"Extra Small: Players' Nuts." Timely and hilarious. Bad example: "Another
Braves Championship." Uncreative and dull. And lastly, one more quick
breakdown. l)o: Come for BP, wear your team's colors, eat liberally. Don't:
Get up to pee during an at-bat, die Wave, come for the fireworks. The game
Is worth it if you give it time and effort
Ilie lesson in all of this is that when you come to the stadium, you're
on display. Like die players themselves, you are representing part of a
greater whole - you are a symbol for the pride of a college, a city, or even
an endre state. Being a real fan is a personal commitment, not a right,
and only by proving yourself worthy to nxit for something do you earn
your stripes. Make me, and your teams, proud out there.

Is worth it if you give it time and effort
Ilie lesson in all of this is that when you come to the stadium, you're
on display. Like die players themselves, you are representing part of a
greater whole - you are a symbol for the pride of a college, a city, or even
an endre state. Being a real fan is a personal commitment, not a right,
and only by proving yourself worthy to nxit for something do you earn
your stripes. Make me, and your teams, proud out there.

It's midsummer, which leads to a few unshakeable sports conclu
sions. NBA offseason signings are surpassing even their own
benchmarks of ridiculousness. (MehmetOkur? $50 million?) The
Cincinnati Bengals are oh-so-cute in their optimism about this sea
son's prospects. And the vast majority of the sports universe has dipped
below the horizon, leaving only the sweltering heat of baseball. MLB
highlights dominate Sports Center, and there's no better way to spend a
weekday evening than at Wrigley or Camden Yards or (cough) Network
Associates Coliseum. But if you're going to do it, do it right. The jackass
fan is the object of hatred for an entire section, and it is my duty to pre
sent you with the following guide to not being That Guy.
Before you do anything else, come to the ballpark prepared. This
doesn't mean you have to quote Sparky Anderson or calculate slugging per
centages on the fly, but know the rules and know the players on the home
team. Here I am speaking primarily to women, since at the ballpark this is
expected of men, and they know it. 'I here is a bare minimum of baseball

knowledge that comes in the Guy Handbook, along
with how to operate a barbecue, quotes from Sergio
I jeone films, and how to parallel-park. Failure to grasp
these fundamental concepts often leads to social os
tracism-and justifiably so. The dork who turns around
and asks the guy behind him why runners have to tag
up? Unless he is clearly foreign-bom or under die age
of fifteen, this should be grounds for castration.
'ITie second echelon of Ixdlpark etiquette de<ils with
appearance. First of all, if you're going to wear a hat, wear
the official team cap. Ihe novelty colored-hair wigs have
got to go. Baseball games are nothing if not casual, but

that doesn't mean you have to look like a less masculine rodeo down. Admit
tedly, tills may be a personal vendetta of'mine. Most of my t)aseball experience
has iDeen at Angel Stadium at Anaheim Angels Park, or whatever they're call
ing it now. \Mule most Angel fans are well-informed and professk)nal, we
seem to have an abundance of aging men in down wigs and that godawful
Rally Monkey, which is the worst sports-related use of monkeys since the
movie MVP: Most Valuable Primate.
Tasteful down wigs aside, feel free to peel off your sweat-and-ketchup
stained T-shirt and bask in die afternoon sun, particularly if you weigh 300
pounds or more. Fat men loafing in baseball stadiums is as much a part of
America as the Declaration of Independence. In fact, I dunk that's the back
of Missouri's state quarter - just a beer-bellied fanner in a Cardinals hat in
seat A27. And, for the love of God, do not bring your glove to the game un
less you are ten years old or in a wheelchair. Seriously, I bet when Joe
Twelvepack sits down in the centerfield stands and stuffs a meaty paw into
his Rawlings, part of Garret Anderson dies a little by association.
Now that you are informed enough to enjoy the game and you don't look
like a complete moron, it's time to address the second-best thing to do in the
park other than watch the game: drink. But beware, because the line be
tween the hilarious drunk guy and the obnoxious oaf who the entire section
hopes will choke on his own vomit later is a fine one. Hie seven dollar beer is
baseball's way of telling you that moderation is your friend.
Beer often has a way of leading to one of the fan's primary purposes: the
time-honored tradition of heckling. Like drinking, this Is a delicate issue,
in that if it's going to be done, it has to be done correcdy. Telling the um
pire that Ray Charles is interviewing for his job after the game is a plus, as
is the well-timed "You suck" or jokes about the home dty of the opposing
team. Screaming wildly at every play or exceeding the one-comment-per
inning limit? Unacceptable. Also, gauge the fan reaction around you. If
the line that was oh-so-witty in your mind is met with silence, it's probably
best to keep your mouth shut, because the guy four rows back just started
calculating die physics behind asphyxiating you widi a foam finger.
Fan-created banners are acceptable in the bleacher seats and no place else.
And if you're making an acrostic, don't slack off and use letters in the middle
of words; that's just lazy. Most ofall the >ugh, your sign must be funny and top
ical. Good example, for those of you angry about the Balco steroid scandal:
"Extra Small: Players' Nuts." Timely and hilarious. Bad example: "Another
Braves Championship." Uncreative and dull. And lastly, one more quick
breakdown. l)o: Come for BP, wear your team's colors, eat liberally. Don't:
