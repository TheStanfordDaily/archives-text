## Josh Davis casts a 'Shadow' over us DJ Shadowâ€”Live! In Tune and On Time 
### JOHN HOLGATE INTERMISSION TURNTABLIST 
"We re going to treat this as a late night
movie. It's a cinematic experieixe."
With "In Tune and On Time," a
live CD / DVD combo that captures
a 2002 London performance, DJ
Shadow proves he is the best hip
hop producer currently spinning.
DJ Shadow's style of musical collage,
wherein he samples and steals from
everyone under the sun, has often
been imitated, but never duplicated
(even by himself), since his land
mark album "Endtroducing,"
which basically invented instrumen
tal hip-hop as its own art form. You
could argue that the success of the
Neptunes, the adventurousness of
El-P, or the genre-bending work of
RJ D 2 prove that they are better be
hind the turntables - but I'm sorry,
you would be wrong.
This latest offering from Josh
Davis, aka DJ Shadow, is filled with
melodies that melt you and break
beats that hammer your head,
often simultaneously. Why can't
life be as beautiful as these songs?
The luscious loops, layer upon
layer of lonely sounds, make you
ache, and then the hard beats and
kicking breaks bring you back up.
On this album. Shadow hoped to
create a live mix that not only
matched beats on time, but also
carried the same emotional quali
ties in tune.
By aiming for more than a simple
dance mix or a collection of greatest
hits, Shadow showcases his
strengths as an all-around produc
er. Atmospheric, tender, haunting,
moody ... I could keep up this Bth
grade style of description by contin
uing my search through the the
saurus, but it is truly difficult to con
vey how Shadow constructs such
compelling songs.
The album opener, "Fixed In
come," features a simple two-step
bass-line and a meandering key
board that lulls you into safety. It's
almost as if Shadow took a towel,
soaked it in some heady concoction
of atmosphere, then let the drops
slowly slide down the record nee
dle as he squeezed the towel dry.
"Stem / Long Stem" juxtaposes a
delicate string section with a
smashing beat that forgoes any
need of syncopation, bludgeon
ing the listener with straight
ahead aggression. On "Walkie
Talkie," he uses the signature
turntablist technique of quilting
together a patchwork of words
ripped from various records to
construct phrases, much as a kid
napper might cut out letters from
magazines to write a ransom note.
1)J Shadow lets us all know that he
is indeed a badass motherfucking
nj. and that's why he walks and
talks that way.
Josh Davis has demonstrat
ed his strong song-writing abil
ities time and time again, but
this live album also gives him
room to scratch and tweak his
way to turntablist heaven.
While not up to par with mas
ters such as Q-Bert and the Cut
Chemist, DJ Shadow is no
slouch on the turntables, using
understated scratches to add to
already familiar songs. He con
stantly teases the crowd near
the end of the album, cutting
and re-cutting the phrase
"break down, baby" that kicks
off the roaring "Number
Song." One of the highlights
of the set is his opening to
"Organ Donor." Shadow ex
tends the intro phrase with
organ stabs from his sampler,
building the tension until the
rugged song sends the crowd
into a frenzy.
"In Tune and On Time" also

features a DVD that captures DJ
Shadow's impressive live show.
Josh Davis hoped to put on
more than a display of mixing
virtuosity at his concerts and
commissioned a visual spectacle
to accompany his music. The
DVD meshes shots of the artist
working the turntables with the
huge video projections behind
him. The visuals match the
mood of the music and remain
on beat fora glorious multi-sen
sational effect. You can also find
a few songs that didn't make it
to the CD due to time constric
tions such as the amazing close
of the concert when Shadow
turns "Midnight" into "High
Noon." Throughout the DVD,
.footage displays Shadow's
scratching technique and
demonstrates the speed and
skill with which he moves be
tween songs, smoothly blending
from track to track.
Shadow has evolved from
a hip-hop junkie scrounging
through bins of used vinyl at
San Francisco record shops to a
world-class performer, an
amazing feat for somebody who
relies on the work of others to
create his own music. Every
single voice clip, snare hit, or
guitar riff you hear is culled
from the records of other
artists, something 1 initially
faulted turntablism for as a lack
of creativity. Where others see
nothing but old and tired
records, DJ Shadow sees a
spark and evokes beauty. I now
see this musical cannibalism as
creation on par with the best
that today's musicians can offer,
regardless of genre.
