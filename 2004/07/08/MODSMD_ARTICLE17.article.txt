## Josh Davis casts a 'Shadow' over us DJ Shadowâ€”Live! In Tune and On Time 
### JOHN HOLGATE INTERMISSION TURNTABLIST 
"We re going to treat this as a late night
movie. It's a cinematic experieixe."
With "In Tune and On Time," a
live CD / DVD combo that captures
a 2002 London performance, DJ
Shadow proves he is the best hip
hop producer currently spinning.
DJ Shadow's style of musical collage,
wherein he samples and steals from
everyone under the sun, has often
been imitated, but never duplicated
(even by himself), since his land
mark album "Endtroducing,"
which basically invented instrumen
tal hip-hop as its own art form. You
could argue that the success of the
Neptunes, the adventurousness of
El-P, or the genre-bending work of
RJ D 2 prove that they are better be

Davis, aka DJ Shadow, is filled with
melodies that melt you and break
beats that hammer your head,
often simultaneously. Why can't
life be as beautiful as these songs?
The luscious loops, layer upon
layer of lonely sounds, make you
ache, and then the hard beats and
kicking breaks bring you back up.
On this album. Shadow hoped to
create a live mix that not only
matched beats on time, but also

ties in tune.
By aiming for more than a simple
dance mix or a collection of greatest
hits, Shadow showcases his
strengths as an all-around produc
er. Atmospheric, tender, haunting,
moody ... I could keep up this Bth
grade style of description by contin
uing my search through the the
saurus, but it is truly difficult to con
vey how Shadow constructs such
compelling songs.
The album opener, "Fixed In
come," features a simple two-step
bass-line and a meandering key
board that lulls you into safety. It's
almost as if Shadow took a towel,
soaked it in some heady concoction
of atmosphere, then let the drops
slowly slide down the record nee
dle as he squeezed the towel dry.
