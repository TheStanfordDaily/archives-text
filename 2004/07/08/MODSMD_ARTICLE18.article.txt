# Spider-Man 2 improves by leaps and bounds
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In Sam Raimi's "Spider-
Man," a radioactive spider bite
freed awkward, introverted nerd
Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire)
from his inhibitions. There are
few cinematic moments that can
match die pure, visceral joy of
watching Peter scream delirious
ly as he leaps from rooftop to
rooftop. Of course, the film
quickly turned into a melan
choly, even dour lesson in hero
ism, hammering home the mes
sage, "With great power comes
great responsibility."
Now comes Raimi's superior
sequel, in which the tone turns
darker still. Nothing seems to be
going right in Peter's life - ro
mantically, academically or
super-heroically. He's struggling
in his classes, gets fired from his

pizza-delivery job and dream
girl-next-door Mary Jane Wat
son (Kirsten Dunst) is ted up with
Peter's apparent irresponsibility.
All this stress takes a toll on his
alter ego, and Peter's spider pow
ers start to tail.
Octavius (Alfred Molina),
goes horribly wrong (do exper
iments ever go "right" in comic
book movies?) transforming
the kindly scientist into a de
ranged murderer armed with
mechanical tentacles.
The bulk of "Spider-Man 2"
plays like a protracted version
of the first movie's opening
half-hour, with Peter again
catching wave after wave of bad
luck. Despite the downer tone,
not to mention the soap-opera
earnestness of Peter and MJ's
relationship, it all works re
markably well - you really feel
Peter's misery as he gets

stepped on again and again,
which makes yon root all the
harder when he inevitably re
gains his focus, learns from his
mistakes and dispenses the
righteous ass-kicking that
we've beenwaiting for.
Perhaps the key factor in
"Spider-Man 2"'s success is its
apparent sincerity; as with the
first film, Raimi and his cast
take the material seriously, es
chewing any self-conscious
winks at the audience. Which
isn't to say that the movie isn't
funny - it is, sometimes hysteri
cally so - but the humor works
within the context of the story
and its admittedly silly world.
Maguireand Dunst have both
grown into their roles, reflecting
the increasing maturity of their
characters — I suspect that
Maguire is one of very few actors
who can really pull of Peter's

"aw-sucks" goofiness, and their
scenes together are honest-to-
Ck>cl swooningly romantic. Moli
na is surprisingly moving as the
unfortunate D(x Ock; Danny
Elfman delivers an catchy score
that alternates between monster
movie and soaring epic.
Best of all, Raimi regains the
dementia that fueled the "Evil
Dead" films, staging a terrify
ing operating-room massacre,
as well as some spectacular, ver
tiginous battles between a CGI
Spider Man and his nemesis.
True, there's still some exces
sive preachiness, not to mention
excruciating Spider-Man-as-
Christ-figure imagery. But
Raimi is improving by leaps and
bounds - "Spider-Man 2"'s heart
and energy plate it at the top of
the superhero-movie heap, and
number three will probably be
even better.
