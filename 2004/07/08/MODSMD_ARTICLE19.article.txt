# Of slap bracelets, Skip-its and Slinkies: VH1's 'I Love the 90's!' reminisces about better times
## 
### LUIS ANDRES VERTIZ INTERMISSION POP CULTURE WHORE 
This isn't another piece on being unem
ployed. I'm just stating for the record, that in
my fifth week of summer vacation, I am a still
unemployed. In addition to fringe benefits
such as unlimited access to the refrigerator's
vegetable crisper, allowing my hair to blos
som like an uncut lawn and no explicit need
to wake up before noon, I'm brushing up on
all the television programming that I've ne
glected over the past three quarter.
It's sad to see the once recognizable net
works decay into indistinguishable broad
casts of countdown and reality shows. One
network in particular that's taken a nasty dive
is VHI (which once stood for Video Hits
One). I used to consider E! Entertainment
Television the bottom of the barrel when it
comes to superficial, trivial programming.
Case in point: Celebrities Uncensored, which
now may have more editions than the NOW
that's what I call Music! CI) series. But that's
before I was privileged to learn of VHi's lat
est project: "I Love the 90's."
The upcoming series an the latest install
ment of the countdown-like series that recol
lects recycled pop-culture through the points
of view of recycled celebrity and comedians.
The network has already gone through suc
cessful editions of the series that remember
pop-culture trash (or treasure, if you so opine)
from the 80s and the 70s. The recollection
commentary formula has worked so well for

VHI that they've already launched similar
programs for recent pop-culture items, called
"Best Week Ever" and "Best Month Ever."
Such vacuous, originally unoriginal program
ming makes me feel as though VHI has artis-

tically wasted away faster than an
Olsen-twin with an eating disorder.
We have to ask ourselves, as dis
criminatory viewers who have hun
dreds of permutations of such shows
appearing on E!, CNN and even
ESPN, why do we (by "we" I mean
"I") keep tuning in to VHI ? Why do I
have tangible anticipation for the pre
mier of VHl's "I Love the 90's." Be
sides the obvious point that I'm un
employed and generally look forward
to new shows during the rerun-dri
ven summer months, these recollec
tion-commentary shows do have an
intrinsic appeal. For one, it's material

The History Channel probably won't touch
with a ten-foot pole. Because of "I Love the
80's", I finally got the context for numerous
80s related jokes I've seen in The Simpson's
and Family Guy from the most credible of his
torians, Michael lan Black of television show
Ed. Because of him, I finally figured out the
origins of the phrase "Where's the Beef'?
Second, it's an avenue to allow undiscovered
comedic talent to emerge into mainstream
entertainment. I am not a regular at such no
table comedic hubs as The Laugh Factory in
Ij\ and Caroline's in New York, but the mil
lion dollar question is: who are these "comics"

that VHI digs up for these shows. "Best
Week Ever" has regular appearances from
such notable funny persons as Sherrod Small
and Paul Sheer. Who the fuck is Paul Sheer,
and why is he getting so much airtime?

Third, and most importandy, such recollec
tion-commentary shows like "I Love the 80's"
and "Best Week Ever" remind me of the im
portant issues of the day. Quite frankly, I'm
bored and irritated by watching "high-brow"
political punditry on the cable news channels
and C-SPAN. It's incredible tedious to watch
debate between Republicans addicted to the
Politics of Self-Destruction while Democrats
woefully attempt to condense nuanced political
explanations into sound bites digestible by
NASCAR dads. After being exposed to such

nauseating television, 1 11 take Mo
Rocca's astute dissection of the ap
peal of Pet Rocks in '75 or the band
WHAM in '84 any dav.

On July 12th, I hope to find my
self on my couch, as usually, tuned
in to watch the premiere of" I Love
the 90V\ on VHI at 9 p.m. And if
not, that's okay, because VHI
helps fit programming into my
busy schedule by repeating such
episodes during the daytime more

incessantly than MTV shows re
runs of "The Real World: San
Diego" reunion special or "The
Ashlee Simpson Show."

If you actually think Paid Sheer is funny
and insightful, you can try to convince
