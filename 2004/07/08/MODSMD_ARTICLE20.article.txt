# Roxy's summer: Books, bathrooms and bondage (minus bondage)
## 
### ROXY SASS SUMMER SEX GODDESS 
Oh, the joys of summer... hot sexy bod
ies on the beach, wild flings, one-night
stands and partying every night of the week.
Oh the joys of a Stanford summer ... pale
creepy grad students preying on summer
session hotties, wild uninhibited games of
ultimate Frisbee, followed by those sexy
one night stands with your MCAT and / or
LSAT book.
I'm not saying that everything study-re
lated is frowned upon by Roxy. A few
months ago, 1 happened across an athlete
with washboard abs and his girlfriend hav
ing a great study session in one of the li
brary basements. As any great journalistic
sex-deprived voyeur would have done, I
pulled up a chair and watched silently.
1 fer supple ass made perfect use of several
doctoral dissertations, each one lifting her
to the perfect height of Mr. Athlete's (I'm
sure you can fill in the blank here). Cliche
yes. Hot... definitely. Great use of edu
cational resources in a library. Great use of
dusty dissertations that no one will ever
read. I gave them a 10.
Roxy also happened upon another

public display of affection later that week.
During a late night run around Campus
Drive, I had the very sudden urge to pee.
Frantically, I ran from one locked building
to the next, unable to find my porcelain
savior. Then, in the moonlit distance, I
spotted that never more beautiful woman
on the familiar blue sign with her always
stylish triangle skirt. I ran as fast as I could
to the glowing goddess only to find she had
locked me out. Shit! I ran for the next best
thing, the men's room next door.
As 1 darted for the stall while pulling
down my shorts, 1 heard frantic footsteps
and whispers. That being the last thing on
my mind, I hardly paid attention. My
focus was intent on not making a mess on
myself or the toilet seat. As I was finishing
up, I sneaked a peek under the stall wall
only to find not one, not two, but three
pairs of feet! All quiet, all male, all orgy.
Roxy's seen it all, so 1 complimented their
Manolo Blahnik shoes and quickly left so
as not to steal away any more of their time.
Come on, |>eople! Stanford has yet to be
recognized for the wildly "popular" reputa
tion Roxv has so painstakingly earned, one
sexiud escapade at a time. Over the years, I
have known, witnessed and partaken in many

of the kinky undergoings at this fabulous uni
versity. By "many," I mean "all the raunchi
ness that ever happens, which isn't enough to
satisfy her her libido." We, the regular admit
ted Stanford student, treat this side ofour sex
uidity as if it were that one A- on our high
sch(x>l report card. You, as our summer stu
dent population, am change that.
As for public sex, yes, it is illegal and I'll
leave that for you to explain to the librari
an or Santa Clara police. Sure, you won't
reach the heights of getting it on in a hot air
balloon, like Marge and Homer managed
in"The Simpsons," nor will you find wind
mills a turn-on after a playful romp at your
local mini-golf course. But you can start
small. Guys, please, just ask that girl from
Roble's Summer Research College out.
Roxy will take anyone legal right about
now, so you may get lucky. Girls, quit being
uppity bitches and grab a Jamba juice with
the boy.
Mr. and Mrs. Athelete have since gradu
ated yet they long for someone to till their
shoes. Mr., Mr., and Mr. Toilet Orgy want
you to explore your surroundings and exhi
bitionist longings. listen closely enough and
you can hear their pleas... and moans. Listen
to find out or l)etter vet, follow their lead!
