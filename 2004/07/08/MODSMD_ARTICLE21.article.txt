Fire Safety: Summer, more than
any other season, is a time to eat
foods fresh from over an open
flame. The trick, though, is find
ing an appropriate flame. Should
you be in your backyard roasting
hot dogs and s'mores when your
neighbor's house lights ablaze,
please, before you run over to
gawk, put down your sticks and
marsh mallows.
Be Kind to the Blind: Taking a
day trip to the beach? Trying to
weave your way through that
crowded street alongside the
parking lot without getting an
other hit and run charge? We
all know how you feel, and that
retarded middle-aged woman
who can't keep track of her chil
dren is on everyone's nerves.
Hut before doing anything
rash, take a good look at that
slow person's sunglasses. If
they're just a little bit too dark,

remember that pesky driver's
manual, and DO NOT HONK
AT BLIND PEOPLE! Just
thinking of the flabbergasted
looks they get on their faces
should be enough to deter you.
Have a Politically Correct
Vacation: In any summer hot
spot you may travel to with your
affluent Jewish friends and fam
ily, there is likely to be a wide
cross-section of the world's pop
ulation and culture. Just be
cause someone has dark skin
does not necessarily mean that
they will either park or steal
your car. Those of Hispanic
persuasion could very well not
work in the food or lawn care in
dustries. Though they may look
similar, not every Asian is an en
thusiastic tourist who will ask
you to take photographs of them
in front of what may or may not
be a national landmark using
one of their many cameras. And
if you see a redhead applying
liberal amounts of SPF a billion
sunscreen to pasty white skin,

for the love of his God, do not
offer him a potato. Drunken
people like fights.
Tequila for Tots: As if you
didn't get enough alcohol dur
ing the school year, now you're
wandering the streets with a
keg in a little red wagon and the
fuzz starts giving you a hard
time. Just remember, a happy
cop is a complacent cop. If you
offer him a beer, maybe you can
avoid that MI P.
On Getting that Summer Piece:
It's hot, everyone's walking
around wearing a good bit less
clothing than usual, ads for Spring
Break are everywhere (oddly
enough), and holy crap you're
horny. Well before you snag that
short-lived special someone, the
one who will be lucky if they last
until fall, to hell with their emo
tions, take a minute to see their
side of things. They're probably
just using you for sex too. Not
such hot shit now, are ya? That's
what I thought.
