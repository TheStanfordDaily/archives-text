Changing of the guard
Handing over the board chair
position of Stanford Board of
Trustees to Burton J. McCurty
this past June, Isaac Stein men
tioned in an interview with The
Stanford Report that he was sat
isfied with the way the system
works. Stein was forced to bring

his 10 years of service with the
board to an end, when tenure
rules applied. Stein is taking a
year ofT after having witnessed
the merger of two major univer
sity hospitals and the inaugura
tion of President Hennessy. He
cites the overall stable status of
the school over time as his
proudest accomplishment.

Stein talked about the need to
find more qualified minority ap
plicants but feels diversity
among the undergraduate pop
ulation will come on its own. In
the interview, Stein also pointed
out the negative slow pace of
change at the University but did
mention he will miss his work.
"Nobody ever walks away from

Stanford, especially as a trustee,
and I don't expect to walk away
either," Stein said.
Of Stanford and horses
The Equestrian Center and
Red Barn located on the west
side of campus will be taken over
by Stanford University again this
fall. The athletic program con
tinues to extend its already vast
program by having the Physical
Education and Recreation de
partment take over the Barn and
Center when the 20-year lease
Equestrian Associates has on the
area expires. They will be reno
vated, staffed and open to con
tinue to provide for the commu
nity with interests in the history
of Stanford as well as its horses.
"There are many details to be
worked out, but we're confident
we can improve the facilities and
accommodate the needs of the
many people on campus and in
the community that the Red Barn
serves," Athletics Directed Ted
Leland told The Stanford Report.
Jazz is in the air
For those who haven't yet
caught a part of the Stanford
Jazz festival, there's still time.
The festival, which started in
June 19 and has already featured
Ruth Brown and The George
Brooks Summit, still has a month
to go before it ends August 7.
Upcoming shows include Kim
Nalley, Dee Spencer, The Jim
Cullum Jazz Band and The
Heath Brothers among many
notables. There are many other
events aside from the concerts
for children and families, such as

small workshops. All shows and
events take place on the Stanford
campus. The festival concludes
with an All Star Jam Session and
the Eric Alexander Quintet.
Tickets can be purchased online
or at Tresidder Union.
An uptick in funds
The School of Humanities
and Sciences has increased its
endowment by almost $200 mil
lion this year according to The
Stanford Report. After fundrais
ing $100 million through the
Hewlett Challenge, the school
was matched with $98.9 million
by the Hewlett Challenge. The
money goes towards the many
programs under the Humani
ties and Sciences, such as the
Overseas Studies Program. The
large endowment also gives
H&S the opportunity to create
new academic programs like an
Islamic studies program and a
France-Stanford Center for In
terdisciplinary Studies.
Created in 2001 by William
and Flora Hewlett, the Hewlett
Foundation is now headed by
son Walter Hewlett, who serves
as chairman of the board.
Through its challenge, the foun
dation now hopes to honor the
late William Hewlett.
Aspirations are high for the
future as well. H&S expects to
raise $600 million by 2009 to
continue to support its profes
sorships, directorships and
graduate fellowships as well as to
continue to establish new acade
mic programs at the University.
