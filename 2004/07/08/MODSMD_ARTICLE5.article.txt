## O'Connor draws ovation at Commencement 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
For its 113 th Commencement, Stanford
University featured chickens, a water slide,
swing dancing and Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor as the Class of 2004
continued its unique yet classic matricula
tion traditions on Sunday, June 13.
The words of Rev. Joanne Sanders'
Commencement Benediction brought a se
rious tone to the ceremonies. While her
words, as recounted by The Stanford Re
port, "Each beginning demands an ending.
Every ending promises a beginning," may
have moved some emotionally, the words
succeeded in encompassing what graduat
ing from Stanford means to many. The
2004 Commencement ceremony held at
Stanford Stadium marked the start of a new
path for many graduates who were encour
aged to help others by Commencement
speaker O'Connor.
University President John Hennessy
opened the ceremonies by welcoming the
estimated 25,000 on hand. Hennessy then
introduced O'Connor, Stanford alumna of
1950 and Stanford Law alumna of 1952.
O'Connor first delivered a speech to

Stanford graduates in 1982, one year after
becoming the first woman to hold the of
fice of Supreme Court Justice.
In her speech O'Connor, described her
own struggles after college and in the ca
reer world — including those dealing with
sexism — to encourage the crowd to learn
the lessons life slips in.
"I came to realize almost immediately
what a wonderful path I had taken," said
O'Connor of finally entering the public
sector. "At every step of the way, 1 felt the
thrill of doing something right fora rea
son that was good. It was the thrill of
building bridges."
Recalling the words and praising the ac
tions of the late President Ronald Reagan,
who appointed her into the Supreme
Court, the Stanford alumna urged the
Class of 2004 to fulfill their right to "dream
heroic dreams".
The theme of "building bridges" ran
strongly throughout the speech. Men
tioned in the address were the struggles of
those who fought to end segregation in
schools, such as Brown v. Board of Educa
tion, as well as others who fought racism
throughout the 20th century.
O'Connor told the graduates that while

"Triumphs over injustice — like those
spearheaded by Ronald Reagan and those
that resulted from the efforts of the young
attorneys in Brown — can seem inevitable
if you know how the story ends," these
fights can only help solve the problems of
America. She asked them to consider a life
working for the public.
"I don't know what the future holds, but
I know who holds the future," O'Connor
concluded. "It is you. Commit yourselves
today, as you embark on your new life as a
Stanford graduate, to being a bridge
builder. We need you, and those who cross
the bridges you build will thank you."
The audience largely enjoyed the
speech as graduates and the crowd ap
plauded several times before giving
O'Connor a standing ovation in the end.
"I've always been thinking about [work
ing in the public sector", said Kevin Pong,
Class of 2004. "[The speech] helped me
consider it more and realize that I may not
be the only one considering it."
Fong found the speech inspiring but
joked that as a civil engineer major he
could literally help build those "bridges."
The Wacky Walk, which takes place
every year before Commencement,

proved exciting yet again for graduates
and onlookers. In typical California fash
ion, most students donned shorts and flip
flops, but many took on the challenge of
making their walk a memorable one.
Chicken costumes, picnics, music, a
slip'n'slide complete with young men slid
ing and those infamous (life-size) red cups
showed up. The ever-present goodbye
signs and palm trees also paraded across
the field before the ceremony took place.
Fong said goodbye to his undergradu
ate experience on the Farm by being part
of the hallowed Palm Drive.
"1 used a metal curtain rod," Fong said
of what was used to hold the palm leaves
up, showing the same innovation and
imagination many of his peers displayed in
theii final moments as Stanford Students.
A total 0f4,733 diplomas were handed out
— 1,788 bachelor's degrees, 2,055 mas
ters and 890 doctorates.
"What an accomplishment it was, Stan
ford," said Fong, surely summing up many
of the feelings his fellow graduates shared.
"Once I got the degree and opened it and
saw my name, 1 was like 'Wow'. I was part of
something so amazing. You can't help not
make a mark at Stanford."
