# SRC is a social environment for research-minded students

If the first things thought of
when thinking of "research" were
beach trips, movies, fireworks and
camping, perhaps more students
would be inclined to do summer re
search at Stanford. All too often, re
search is kx)ked at through a stereo
typical lens: grad students and pro
fessors locked in a lab for weeks
without another soul to meet.
But before the beliefs that research
Is either extremely Isolating or too
slow are cemented, Stanford's Sum
mer Research College (SRC) offers
students a new take on the process.
"Students want to do research and
professors need students. SRC] is
g(x)d because it's organized," said
Tom Wang, a sophomore currendy
doing research in computer science.
In its fourth year, the program
mixes traditional research internship
through the University's depart
ments widi a residential program —
which is in simplest terms what SRC,
is. Roble Hall becomes home to over
100 undergraduates involved in re
search for eight to 10 weeks during
the summer pericxl.
Yet while the weather outside
may be gorgeous and fit for sun
bathing, most of the work done calls
for the researchers to be inside. SR( -

expects its students to be prepared
for full time work — about 40 hours
a week — and to be called upon
even in the middle of the night.
Vikram Malhotra,, who is doing re
search with the Department ofElectrical
Engineering admits that the times do
vary, mentioning lus shortened hours
three hours of work done Wednesday.
Malhotra can even d<) much of the work
from Ills room on his computer, llie ju
nior's schedule differs from his room
mate's, John Adams, 9 to 6 workday.
"It takes a lot of time but some
times the professors aren't here,"
Adams said. "A lot of people end up
having free time."
"It's pretty intense," Wang dif
fered. "You're just waiting for
something [to happen]."
For each department, the experi
ence is as different as the procedure.
"( )ne can sit a while in the lab or the
library thinking about a problem on
his own, but one can also be part of a
group activity and research commu
nity," said Assistant Program Director
Ben Davidson.
Started in 2(XX), SRC now hosts re
searchers in 34 different departments
and programs with a wide range of re
search opportunities in both the hu
manities and sciences. Ihese include a
