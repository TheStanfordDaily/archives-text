# SRC is a social environment for research-minded students
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
If the first things thought of
when thinking of "research" were
beach trips, movies, fireworks and
camping, perhaps more students
would be inclined to do summer re
search at Stanford. All too often, re
search is kx)ked at through a stereo
typical lens: grad students and pro
fessors locked in a lab for weeks
without another soul to meet.
But before the beliefs that research
Is either extremely Isolating or too
slow are cemented, Stanford's Sum
mer Research College (SRC) offers
students a new take on the process.
"Students want to do research and
professors need students. SRC] is
g(x)d because it's organized," said
Tom Wang, a sophomore currendy
doing research in computer science.
In its fourth year, the program
mixes traditional research internship
through the University's depart
ments widi a residential program —
which is in simplest terms what SRC,
is. Roble Hall becomes home to over
100 undergraduates involved in re
search for eight to 10 weeks during
the summer pericxl.
Yet while the weather outside
may be gorgeous and fit for sun
bathing, most of the work done calls
for the researchers to be inside. SR( -

expects its students to be prepared
for full time work — about 40 hours
a week — and to be called upon
even in the middle of the night.
Vikram Malhotra,, who is doing re
search with the Department ofElectrical
Engineering admits that the times do
vary, mentioning lus shortened hours
three hours of work done Wednesday.
Malhotra can even d<) much of the work
from Ills room on his computer, llie ju
nior's schedule differs from his room
mate's, John Adams, 9 to 6 workday.
"It takes a lot of time but some
times the professors aren't here,"
Adams said. "A lot of people end up
having free time."
"It's pretty intense," Wang dif
fered. "You're just waiting for
something [to happen]."
For each department, the experi
ence is as different as the procedure.
"( )ne can sit a while in the lab or the
library thinking about a problem on
his own, but one can also be part of a
group activity and research commu
nity," said Assistant Program Director
Ben Davidson.
Started in 2(XX), SRC now hosts re
searchers in 34 different departments
and programs with a wide range of re
search opportunities in both the hu
manities and sciences. Ihese include a
Martin Luther King jr. Paper's
Project, the Drama Depart
ment, work in Gynecology and
()bstetrics and, of course, engi
neering of all soils.
SRC is managed by the Un
dergraduate Research Pro
grams (URP) but is organized
through the school's depart
ments. ITie process can be a bit
perplexing as students do not
apply directly to SRC but
through the department of
their choice. They are then
able to choose to live in Roble.
"You apply knowledge
you learn. The problem sets
in class, you apply it to the re
search" Malhotra said of his
personal experience.
As for the setting, Davidson
talked about how most depart
ments in the natural sciences
require lab work with grad stu
dents and post-docs. Humani
ties research may mean work
ing alone in the library. But
Davidson emphasized how
different each experience is.
" 11 all really varies; it can't be
categorized," Davidson said.
Perhaps this variation is
one of the more intriguing

tilings about research oppor
tunities at Stanlord. Whether
one prefers a solitary work or
group effort, URP has many
different ways students can
work with faculty-led research.
And while other summer
research programs across the
collegiate level give its students
the same chance to work in de
partmental research, Stan
ford's SRC makes a point to
emphasize community build
ing during work breaks.
"To come back for lunch
and just come back from the
lab [is exciting]," said David
son — who spent his last two
summers in SRC] developing
logic textbooks and software
for college courses —: of the
advantageous atmosphere.
"You get to hear what every
one else is working on."
SRC also tries to make sure
that die experience is enjoy
able through various activities
and outings. In other words,
the phrase "All work and no
play" does not apply here.
The residential program
tries to have a social dorm at
mosphere in Roble. Dimitris
Economou, a junior re
searching electrical engi
neering, recognized that
there are lot of events to take
part in but also implied that
social activities fail to work in
some cases and some stu

dent-researchers do fall into
a stereotypical role.
Just recently the students
researchers and staff were able
to enjoy a fireworks twice over
the Fourth of July weekend as
well as a trip to San Gregorio
State Beach. Coming up in two
weeks, SRC residents take a trip
down to Big Basin in the Santa
Cruz redwoods.
On top of the experience
gained through research
and acquaintances made in
the residential program,
SRC offers the same unique
opportunities as other Stan
ford programs. Like Sopho
more College and Honors
College, students are able to
work closely with faculty.
SRC holds weekly academic
events where the stiff proce
dures of daytime research
disappear into less formal
evening events such as din
ners and workshops.
Every Tuesday, a member
of Stanford's distinguished
faculty becomes a guest speak
er for dinner. Planning to
dine with SRC this year in
clude Dean and Political Sci
ence Prof Judy Goldstein,
Stanford Symphony Orches
tra composer Mark Apple
baum, Prof. Paul Fisher (De
partment of Neurology), Prof.
Adina Paytan (Department of
(ieological and Environmen

tal Sciences) and Chemistry
Prof. Richard Zare.
'They're big on fc>stering a
research community where you
leam about opportunities on
doing research, presenting re
search and interacting with ad-

visors," Adams said.
Student-re
searchers gain in
sight into applying
to graduate school,
writing for grant
proposals and even
preparing to write
the daunting task
that is die senior the
sis at in-donn work
shops each Thurs
day evening. In a
few words, SRC
provides plenty of
advantages to these
students aside from
the work done daily.
'You getalot more
work done than dur
ing the year," Adams
said "It's a nice liead
start and it's useful for
graduate school"
Undergradu
ate research can
help when apply
ing fora doctorate
program or when
needing job expe
rience. While
many students do
work directly re-

lated to their major, it is not
a requirement. SRC offers
the chance to pursue other
interesting projects. David
son himself did the summer
research through a Symbol
ic Systems internship even

though he plans to go into
Student Affairs.
As for one ot die best things
to come from SRC, "It's a
quality education and one is
able to contribute to a worth
while project", Davidson said.
