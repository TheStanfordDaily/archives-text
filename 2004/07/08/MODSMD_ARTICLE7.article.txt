# GSC plans for opening of GCC
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Food and fun, along with
more serious items of discussion,
were on the agenda of the Grad
uate Student Council (GSC) dur
ing yesterday evening's meeting
at the Bechtel International Cen
ter. In particular, GSC members
discussed plans to prepare for the
opening of the much-anticipated
Graduate Community Center
(GCC) this fall.
The Center will be host to a
variety of offerings, including a
full-functioning pub and patio
garden, television lounge,
meeting space for students and
groups, and even an area for
aerobic activities.
This September, when the
GCC will first be available to stu
dents, the GSC plans to hold an
opening get-together, and
around that time the University
will also administer an official
dedication ceremony.
Former GSC chair Steve Alli
son, a doctoral student in biologi
cal sciences, explained that the
Council has high hopes for the
opportunities that the GCC will
afford students once it is ready for

the University community.
"The image we want is for it to
be a hub for the graduate commu
nity — a place where people can
come together for social activities,"
he said, "as well as a place for con
ference rooms, holding meetings,
studying and tilings like that"
The building will be able to
hold a large capacity of stu
dents, estimated to be some
where between 500 to 600.
At the meeting, several GSC
members expressed concerns that
diere might not be enough visitor
parking for those who live off cam
pus that are likely to drop by the
Center when it is operational.
"We'll definitely be having a
conversation with Parking and
Transportation,'' Allison said.
GSC members agreed that the
body ought to further lobby for
more visitor par king spaces before
the building is finished.
The construction of the GCC
itself initially led to a loss in park
ing spaces in the Escondido vicin
ity, which some fear that, coupled
with the expected increased de
mand for parking in the area
when the Center opens, could
lead to an even tighter parking
squeeze for all involved.

However, Allison noted at
the meeting that he was under
the impression that portable of
fice trailers in the nearby
Wilbur parking lot would soon
be removed, which would free
up approximately 120 spaces.
The GSC has worked with
others involved in the construc
tion process to determine how
to spend its $200,00 allocated
for the interior design of the
GCC. A wooden floor for aero
bics activities is being installed in
one of the structure's rooms for
$30,000, while another $8,000 is
being spent on dimmable light
ing in areas such as the pub and
TV lounge, with most of the re
maining funds to be spent on
furnishing the Center.
Prior to addressing GCC-relat
ed issues, the GSC discussed its re
cent Fourth of July barbeque held
earlier this week. GSC members
estimated that approximately 600
community members attended
the event, and they unanimously
agreed diat the event went well.
"It was a huge success, and I
think that it really raised the bar."
said GSC Chair Moriah Thoma
son, a neurosciences doctoral stu
dent. "We had a blast."
