## HOLT'S HARANGUE Soda, pop and red states 
### 
Well I'm sure you've had the ar
gument with somebody. "What
do you call a soda' or 'coke' or
'pop' from where you're from?"
Somehow, we are always amazed when
the answer is not what we think it should be.
Stanford being a pretty diverse place, we reg
ularly encounter people from all different
play backgrounds and cultures. We differ in
so many important things, such as sexual ori
entation, religion, or whether or not you hate
the Peking Lakers.
We've learned to accept and even em
brace people of different backgrounds and
beliefs. And yet, we still ogle people who refer

to a soft drink as "pop."
We really shouldn't, be
cause people usually say
coke, pop, or soda de
pending upon what re
gion they are from. If
you are from the south,
"coke" is usually right.
Which leads to such silly
phrases as "What kind
of coke do you want?"
"A Pepsi!" In the Mid-

west it's usually "pop." (I'd like some pop,
please, and then I'll go to the hop and do the
rag-mop.) On the east coast and California,
it's soda. (This is perfectly normal, I have no
jokes here.)
On a completely unrelated note, let's
look at what states went to which presi
dential candidate in the last election. In
2000, Albert Gore got: California, New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and most
New England states. All of those states
also say the word "soda." Bush got the
South, most of the Midwest, and most im
portantly "Florida." These states also say
"pop" and "coke," except for Florida.
Florida (and I swear this is true) is split on
the issue.
Before you infer anything from these
staggering findings, let's look at some
other facts. Coca Cola is a big name
brand, which is run from Atlanta, Geor
gia. In the south, remember, "coke" is
the definition of soft-drink.' The Coca
Cola Company is extremely successful
and powerful, and has contributed
money to all sorts of organizations,
some of them political. In Georgia, the
state where it is headquartered, Coca
Cola contributed $50,000 to the Geor
gia Republican Party in 2004. Last year,
Coca Cola also contributed thousands
of dollars to four senatorial campaigns,
all of which were running Republican
candidates. In the last ten years, Coca
Cola contributed more than twice as
much (roughly $800,000 more) to the
Republican Party as it did to the Demo
cratic Party.
By supporting the Republican Party,
particularly in its headquartered state of

Georgia, Coca Cola is supporting the
community. And that community cer
tainly appreciates the support! Why by
supporting Georgian government, the
Georgian government is nice enough to
favor big corporations like ("oca Cola.
Thanks, Georgia!
And who could blame them for that? Coca
Cola is Grade-A American: just look at its
cans. The trademark red cans takes on a
whole new meaning when you realize that
Republican states — states that go to Repub
licans in elections — are labeled as red.
But Coke is not only there for the
Georgia community of wealthy CEOs.
Coca Cola also supports my genera
tion. As evidenced on Coca Cola's web
site, the company is "right there with
you." Coke encourages you to "watch
as everyone keeps it real in the latest
TV commercials." There are a whole
slew of different kinds of people on
these commercials, all united in drink
ing Coke. This diverse ideal is equally
embodied by the Republican Party:
"Wait! You're Republican AND black?
Sh*t! Can you stand right in front of
that camera?"
It's so great that they are keeping it
real because when 1 saw the commercials
I immediately thought of how much
Chris Rock would agree completely with
how they are keeping it real and how his
generation identifies with them. Yep,
Coca Cola is "right there" with me
through my tough times in life. That eat
ing disorder my cousin had? The high
sugared Coke was right there. That kid I
babysat who has ADHD? Yeah, thanks,
Coke, for being there as I had to peel
him off the ceiling.
And yeah, by supporting a Republican
party that screwed up No Child Left Be
hind, increased the budget deficit, and
gave major tax cuts to the rich —yeah,
they are definitely keeping it real.
Honestly, I don't care what you call
your soft drink. I'm not saying if you call
it one thing you are by default support
ing a certain political party- but I do
think it's an interesting topic for discus
sion. By drinking Coke, you are not only
supporting a product that is unhealthy,
but you are also supporting a company
that has a decidedly conservative agen
da. When you buy a Coke, Bush gets
some fraction of a cent for his reelection
campaign. That doesn't sit too well for
me. That's why I think people should be
united in their reference to soft drinks as
"soda" and their reference to the Lakers
as "Pckheads."
