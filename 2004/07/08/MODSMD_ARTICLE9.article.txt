## Just say no to gas price controls 
### DAVID R. HENDERSON 
Americans are understandably upset by
the high prices they've been paying for gaso
line. Many think that the cause is oil compa
ny greed and that the solution is govern
ment-enforced price controls. But price con
trols on gasoline are a terrible idea. They
would cause shortages and lineups and
would hurt producers and consumers.
Here,s why. What determines the price
of gasoline is the amount producers are
willing to supply at various prices and the
amount drivers demand at various prices.
At the current price of gasoline, say $2.00,
the amount drivers want to buy roughly
equals the amount producers want to sell.
That.s why there are no gas lines. Such a
market-clearing price" evolves in every
competitive market.
What happens, then, when the govern
ment decrees that the price of gasoline be
no higher than, say, $ 1.80. The obvious an
swer is that consumers now can get their
gas for 20 cents a gallon less. But that an
swer is incomplete.
At a price of $1.80, consumers will want
more than they wanted at $2.00. One of the
things economists are surest of is that we want
more of a good when its price falls. At that
lower price, producers want to supply less.
The necessary result, therefore, is a shortage:
the amount demanded exceeds the amount
supplied.
Shortages lead to lineups. Consumers
then compete with each other, not just by
paying money but by spending time in line.
Economists call this lost time a..deadweight
loss,%c a loss to some that is a gain to none.
During the 1979 gasoline shortage, 1 cal
culated that the 80-cent-per-gallon price con

trol caused consumers to spend about $1.1()
a gallon (30 cents per gallon in lost time) and
that if the price controls had been removed,
the market-clearing price of gasoline would
have been $1.00. Consumers actually paid
more than they would have without price
controls, and producers made 20 cents less.
Both lost.
Many people are convinced that high
gasoline prices are due to oil companies,
greed. But that explanation is insufficient
Why such sudden greed? Weren.t oil compa
nies greedy a year ago, when prices were
lower? To explain a change in something,
you need to point to something that changed.
What changed is the world price of oil,
which increased by about $14 between May
2003 and May 2004. Each dollar increase in
the price of oil translates into roughly a 2.5-
cent increase in gasoline prices. About 35
cents of the 50-cent-per-gallon increase in the
price of gasoline, therefore, is due to world
market conditions, one of which is the re
duced oil production in Iraq.
Also, federal regulations fragment what
was once a national gasoline market. The En
vironmental Protection Agency decrees that
certain kinds of gasoline be used in certain re
gions. When a refinery or pipeline goes down
in certain markets, such as California, gaso
line sellers can.t legally buy from other mar
kets. The result: wild swings in gasoline
prices. The regulations also make gasoline
more expensive.
Price controls are a bad idea. Here,s a bet
ter one: reduce gasoline taxes.
