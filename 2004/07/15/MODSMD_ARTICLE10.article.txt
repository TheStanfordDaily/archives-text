## Confronting affirmative action 
### ROBERT ZELNICK 
Because the Bush administration argued
against the two specific University of Michigan
affirmative action plans before the Supreme
Court last year, few appreciated at the time how
much of the constitutional principle of equal
protection it was willing to sacrifice. For exam
ple, Solicitor General Theodore Olson argued
in his brief, "[T]his case requires this Court to
break no new ground," in effect conceding that
race preferences to achieve diversity, articulat
ed in the Bakke case a generation ago, remained
good law. And, said Olson, while not consider
ing race per se, a school might consider such
matters as "a history of overcoming disadvan
tage, geographic origin, socioeconomic status,
challenging living or family situation" and a
host of other technically race-neutral factors.
Got the point (wink, wink)?
The solicitor also pointed with pride to the
"percentage plan," adopted by Texas under the
Bush governorship. The plan got around a circuit
court decision barring race-conscious university
admissions by automatically admitting high
school students from any public high school grad
uating in the top 10 percent of their class.
Now comes word, via The New York Times,
of widespread dissatisfaction with the Texas per
centage plan. The reason is the plan's built-in bias
in favor of students, graduating from low-achieve
ment schools and against those in the tougher aca
demic institutions where many superior students
fail to make the top 10 percent. As a result, many
turned down by the flagship University of Texas
take their talents to other states.
This problem was totally predictable at the
time the law was passed, as were many others in
herent in percentage plans. For one thing, to
"cure" the racial imbalance problem, they rely
on a foundation of de facto segregated high
schools. For another, they have no applicability

to graduate schools or to private or out-of-state
high schools.
The diversity approach sanctioned by the
Court, to which dozens of colleges and universi
ties are now scrambling to adjust, has its own set
of problems. Diversity itself is a vague concept
since it can relate to philosophical viewpoint, reli
gious conviction and areas of academic interest as
easily as to race or ethnicity. Diversity is also sub
ject to diminishing returns. The first African
American in a history or political science course
arguably could bring important perspectives to
bear on many subjects. But what about the sec
ond? Or the 17th? And suppose the course were
biology? Or chemical engineering? Or medicine?
There is at this point overwhelming evidence that
affirmative action at medical schools has pro
duced lower-achieving students who take longer
to graduate, do less well on the medical boards
and materially less well in qualifying to practice
their specialties.
As a matter of principle I continue to oppose
the allocation of rights and rewards based on race.
I wish the administration had shown a bit more
spunk in the leading Michigan cases. But a decade
of attention to this area also persuades me that
this society is unwilling to accept the results of a
race-neutral approach — without gimmicks or
outright intellectual fraud — to college admis
sions. For that reason I believe the least harmful
approach is a straightforward affirmative action
plan modified to avert harm to innocent nonmi
nority students. This could be achieved by en
rolling one nonminority student who would oth
erwise have been rejected for each minority stu
dent enrolled through affirmative action. It is
time to restore integrity to issues of race and uni
versitv admissions.
