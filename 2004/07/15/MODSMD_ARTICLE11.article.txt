## This game means something else in TJ 
### 
Moises is eleven years old. When he was four,
the authorities dropped him off at the Em
manuel orphanage after he was caught run
ning heroin for his addict mother. Now, she
and his older brother are dying of A1 OS, and lie spends his
days behind the gates of the orphanage in the La Gloria
neighborhood on the south side ofTijuana, the expansive
border town just south of San Diego.
Though the language makeup is more or less the same,
driving across the dotted line is like stepping onto another
continent. .After circling the large cement ditch that repre
sents the Tijuana River, the Avenida Internacional runs
west toward the ocean, parallel to the American border.
The highway is a major arterial, yet it runs without a shoul
der or guardrail up a ludicrously steep grade, past five or
six sprawling junkyards and out of die smoggy clatter of
the touristy downtown area. From the right shoulder,

across a hundred-yard treeless
plain littered widi garbage, a 10-
foot-tall white fence looms.
Eventually, the road curls south
and drops down into a narrow
ravine where houses constructed
from aluminum siding and scrap
plywood swarm over the ridges,
crowding one another off the
muddy slopes, some accessible only
by fire escape. Every sign of vegeta
tion has been ripped from the
earth, and the hillsides have been
sculpted by construction machines

into the stark angles of a Spaceman Spiff landscape. Be
hind the endless string of one-man taco stands on the right
shoulder, children play soccer.
Closer to the border, the decrepit Estadio, home of the
National de Tijuana minor-league soccer club, rises out of
the dusty asphalt. It is built out of the sort of tasteful, utilitar
ian poured concrete that dominated sports architecture of
the 19605. Like everything else in Mexico, it has struggled
under the chokehold of bureaucratic corruption. Despite
the fervent support for the game and its status as one of die
nation's 10 largest cities, the drug war that strangles' Tijuana
has scared off many potential major franchises.
When church donors arrive at Moises' orphanage, the
bags of clothing and food are immediately carted away to
the interior of a ramshackle two-story building whose con
struction would give a coronary to any American OS HA in
spector. The soccer balls, however, are left out in the con
crete yard. Moises and the other 20-something boys be
tween the ages of eight and 15 who shuffle in and out of the
orphanage and may or may not be there next week im
mediately begin to run. Seamlessly, their disorganized play
evolves into two teams, with goals against the tall rod-iron
fences on either side of the orphanage yard. Moises drib
bles fluidly past much older boys, deftly touches the ball to
the right of the final defender, sprints around him to the
left and rattles the gate with a shot.
It is foolish to think that the clean lines of the pitch tran
scend the baseness of this place. No matter how small or
strangely constructed, each house has a large steel padlock
on its gate, and at night the sounds of heroin-fueled gunfire
and broken glass echo in the distance. A bitter cloud of des
peration (among other things) hangs in the air in Tijuana,
but there is an underlying passion fora few things. Even re
runs of the Aguilas, Mexico's national team, on television,
cause the city to grind to a halt. Fora few seconds, the beau
tiful game is all that matters, beyond the rocky sand that

It is entirely possible that Moises
will never even see a full-size soccer
field. If he's lucky, at 18 he'll be able
to leave the orphanage and find a
job somewhere in Tijuana, enough
to make a living. But for now,
among the walls topped with bro

ken glass and the dry concrete, he is
the star, an athlete in his element
who rises above the competition to
become a part of the game itself .
Soccer is the great unifier, the ulti
mate level playing field. Even in die
depths of poverty, its simplicity shines
through and makes heroes and
dreams for those who would other
wise have none. Here, on the other
side of the line, eljuego lindo is ;ill they
have, and somehow, it is enough.
