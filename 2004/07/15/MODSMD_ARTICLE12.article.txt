# Kirks, Caverly earn trip to Athens
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Recentlv graduated Stanford swim
mer Tara Kirk is the quintessential
confident competitor. For the past
four years, all eyes have been on the
world-class breaststroke specialist, as
she's flown through the water on the
way to NCAA titles and American and
world records. And although each sea
son Kirk has managed to top her ac
complishments of the previous year,
her post-victory demeanor is always
the same: excited and overwhelmed,
but always composed and modest.
So needless to say, the sight of an
elatedly grinning Tara Kirk jump
ing up and down after a race at the
Olympic Trials on Sunday was a
rare scene to behold.
And even more rare was the event
that Kirk was celebrating. Less than
24 hours after Kirk was named to the
2004 Olympic squad, younger sister
Dana Kirk whipped through the 200-
meter butterfly finals to secure her
own ticket to Athens. The Kirk sib
lings are the first sisters in history to
compete together on the same
Olympic team.
The elder Kirk was nearly con
sidered a lock fora spot on Team
USA. She spent her four years at
Stanford undefeated in the 100-
yard breast and didn't miss a step in
her quest to earn an Olympic berth.
At the Charter All Digital Aquatic
Center in Long Beach, Calif., Kirk
claimed victory in the 100-meter

breast semifinal and ended up with
a second-place finish in Friday's fi
nals. She clocked in just five-hun-

dredths of a second behind
former Arizona swimmer
Amanda Beard and was
named to the Olympic team
two days later.
Dana Kirk seemed less of a
shoo-in, given that her re
sume doesn't quite extend as
far as her older sibling's.
However, the rising Stanford
junior lays claim to the fifth
best 200 fly time in the world
this year and outlasted USC's
Kaitlin Sandeno in the finals
of the event at Long Beach.
Kirk touched the wall at
2:08.86, more than a second
ahead of Sandeno, to earn
her first trip to the Games.
"Being able to go together
is so exciting, 1 Dana Kirk told
reporters after she won.
"We've been waiting for this
fora long time. It's going to
be great to have someone who
knows what I need to swim
my best."
The Kirks are not the lone
Stanford swimmers on the
team, as former Cardinal
great Jenny Thompson was

named to Team USA on Monday.
Heading into her fourth consecu
tive Olympic Games, Thompson is
the most decorated female swim
mer in Olympic history, having
captured eight gold medals. She

will compete in the 100 fly and the
4 x 100 freestyle relay this summer
in Athens.
