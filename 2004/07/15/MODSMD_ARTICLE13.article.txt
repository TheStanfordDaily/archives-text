# Stanford stars seek Olympic berth
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
After Stanford's last trip to Sacramen
to State University for the U.S. Olympic
Trials four years ago, then-juniors Gabe
Jennings and Michael Stember geared
up fora trip to Sydney after dominating
the 1,500 meter run. But their team
mates, then-seniors Toby Stevenson, a
pole-vaulter, and Jonathon Riley, a 5,000
meter runner, went back to the Farm
with only a broken pole and a bloody foot.
Stevenson's pole snapped on his way
up to clear opening height and Riley's
running shoe tell oil alter being stepped
on at the 3,500 meter mark. In a do-or-die
event where only the top three finishers
who have made the Olympic "A" standard
qualify to the Games, neither Stevenson
nor Riley managed to recover from their
mishaps and qualify for the Olympics.
Back in Sacramento four years later,
however, Stevenson celebrates after
vaulting to second place and earning his

first ticket to the Olympic Games this
past Sunday. Riley and several other
Olympic hopefuls from the Farm hope
to follow in Stevenson's footsteps in the
second half of the competition.
Stevenson, the 1998 NCAA champion
and former assistant coach for the (Cardi
nal, came into the trials boasting the world s
l)est vault yet this year with a mark oi 19 leet
and 8.25 inches. Despite his record, Steven
son was not overly confident.
"You never know what can happen in
track and field," said Stevenson after qual
ifying to the final. "Even time we go out
there it's a level playing field. I m going
out there Sunday like I'm a nobody.
Stevenson dueled Goodwill Games
gold medallist Tim Mack for first place,
but settled for second-place and a tic ket
to Athens with a mark of 19 feet and
2.25 inches — just two inches short ol
Mack. Then he celebrated.
" I planned out my celebration Just so 1

could stay relaxed," said Stevenson
after his last vault. "It's a way to have
fun, relieve some stress and get the
crowd involved because I love die
crowd so much in pole vault. Usual
ly I just do them as the moment
comes, but today I needed to relax,
jump my jumps and pray that three
other guys didn't beat me."
Stevenson will be just the third
Stanford pole-vaulter to compete in
the Olympics. He hopes to follow the
path laid out by Stanford graduate
Bill Miller, who won gold in 1932.
Halfway through the nine-day
competition, Stevenson is the first
and only Stanford graduate to
have earned a spot on the Olympic
team. He has set the stage for oth
ers to follow — two of the four cur
rent Stanford athletes, four of the
six 2004 graduates, and several
other alumni have yet to compete.
15-time All-American Jonathon
Riley qualified to compete in the
5,000 meter finals on Friday night
with Class 0f2004 graduates Louis
Luchini and Seth Hejny after fin
ishing in the top 16 in Monday
night's semifinal. Riley came into
the competition with the second
fastest qualifying time of 13:21,
just one second behind Meb Ke

flezighi, and finished seventh in
the semifinals. As long as Riley
keeps his shoes on this Friday, he
will be a strong contender fora
berth on the Olympic team.
Luchini, a runner-up NCAA
champion in the 5,000 meters, could
also be a strong contender after com
ing into the trials seated fifth ;ind fin
ishing twelfth in the semis.
Luchini's fellow Class of 2004
athlete Ji» Cainarena also has a
good "shot."
Camarena, a seven-time All-
American and school record hold
er in the shot put, is seated third at
the trials with a qualifying mark of
18.15 meters. Laura Gerraughty
of North Carolina, who beat
Camerena by six inches to win this
year's NCAA championships, is
seated first in the shot.
Not only will Camarena have
to place in the top three on Thurs
day night, but she will also have to
throw 18.55 meters or better in
order to meet the requisite
Olympic "A" standard.
Camarena's teammate, soon
to-be senior Alicia Craig will run
in the 10,000 meters on Friday
night. Two-time NCAA champion
in the 10,000, Craig is coming into
the race seated seventh with a
qualifying time of 32:19.97. She
will need to take 30 seconds off
that time in order to hit the
Olympic "A" Standard.

Craig's fellow distance runner
and Class of 2005 teammate Sara
Bei took 11th in the 5,000 meter
final on Mondav night with a time
of 15:52.43.
The runner-up to this year's
NCAA championship in the 5,000,
Bei ran one of her fastest times yet
and was pleased to have made the
finals with the likes of Shayne
Culpepper who won the race in
15:07.41 and legally-blind Maria
Runyan who dueled fora close
second in 15:07.48.
"I just wanted to do what I
needed to do out here, 1 didn't
care what place I got," said Bei
after qualifying to the final. "I'm
taking it a step at a time and giving
it a go. I have nothing to lose. I
wanted to do the minimum that I
needed to do to make the final."
The Cardinal has yet to com
pete in what became its showcase
event in the 2,000 trials: the 1,500
meters. Up to six Stanford athletes
will be running in Thursday
night's preliminaries, including se
nior Donald Sage seated 20th, re
cently graduated Grant Robison
and Jason Lunn seated third and
ninth, and repeat offenders Stem
ber and possibly Jennings seated
eighth and 31st.
The final for the 1,500 me
ters will be this Sunday, the
final day of competition in
Sacramento.
