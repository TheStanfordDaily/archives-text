### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
After Stanford's last trip to Sacramen
to State University for the U.S. Olympic
Trials four years ago, then-juniors Gabe
Jennings and Michael Stember geared
up fora trip to Sydney after dominating
the 1,500 meter run. But their team
mates, then-seniors Toby Stevenson, a
pole-vaulter, and Jonathon Riley, a 5,000
meter runner, went back to the Farm
with only a broken pole and a bloody foot.
Stevenson's pole snapped on his way
up to clear opening height and Riley's
running shoe tell oil alter being stepped
on at the 3,500 meter mark. In a do-or-die
event where only the top three finishers
who have made the Olympic "A" standard
qualify to the Games, neither Stevenson
nor Riley managed to recover from their
mishaps and qualify for the Olympics.
Back in Sacramento four years later,
however, Stevenson celebrates after
vaulting to second place and earning his

first ticket to the Olympic Games this
past Sunday. Riley and several other
Olympic hopefuls from the Farm hope
to follow in Stevenson's footsteps in the
second half of the competition.
Stevenson, the 1998 NCAA champion
and former assistant coach for the (Cardi
nal, came into the trials boasting the world s
l)est vault yet this year with a mark oi 19 leet
and 8.25 inches. Despite his record, Steven
son was not overly confident.
"You never know what can happen in
track and field," said Stevenson after qual
ifying to the final. "Even time we go out
there it's a level playing field. I m going
out there Sunday like I'm a nobody.
Stevenson dueled Goodwill Games
gold medallist Tim Mack for first place,
but settled for second-place and a tic ket
to Athens with a mark of 19 feet and
2.25 inches â€” just two inches short ol
Mack. Then he celebrated.
" I planned out my celebration Just so 1
