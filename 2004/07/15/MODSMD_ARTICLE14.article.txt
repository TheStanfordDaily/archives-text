Childress inks 6.7 million dollar
contract with Atlanta's NBA team
The Atlanta Hawks announced on
Monday that the club has signed both of
its first-round picks — high school se
lection Josh Smith and former Stanford
standout Josh Childress. Though fran
chise policies prevented the Hawks
from disclosing the terms of the con
tracts signed, it is being reported that
Childress — who was taken sixth over
all in last month's NBA draft — has
agreed to a three-year deal worth
around 6.7 million dollars.
Hawks general manager acknowl
edged in a press conference on Monday
that Childress' agent had questions
about the contract that prevented the
2004 Pacific-10 Conference Player of the
Year from participating in part of the
first day of summer workouts in Utah.
But Childress was in action at Tuesday's
practice (wearing his new number 22)
and looked "pretty sharp" in workouts,
according to newly-appointed head
coach Mike Woodson.
Childress has expressed nothing but
contentment during his early transition
from college to professional basketball.
He calls Woodson "a tremendous coach"

and remarks that he and the club's three
other draft picks have bonded quickly in
their time together.
"It's a great time right now," Childress
said in a press conference. "I'm getting
paid to play basketball, we have a good
group of guys and we're going to go out
there and work hard."
Three Stanford rowers named
to Olympic teams
Rising senior Jamie Schroeder is one of
three Stanford rowers recently named to
the U.S. Olympic team, and the first male
rower selected to the Games since 1972.
Schroeder was a member of the Cardinal
crew team in 2002 and 2003 before taking
the 2004 season off in order to work with
the men's national team. He will compete
in the men's straight four.
Two members of the Cardinal's 2003
conference champion women's eight are
also on their way to Athens. Rising junior
Samantha Magee spent the 2003 training
with the U.S. national team and will com
pete with Team USA in Athens.
Former teammate and Class of 2003
Stanford graduate Sabrina Kolker will
now be Magee's rival, as Kolker will
compete for Canada in the women's
eight. Kolker has been training with
Canada's national team full-time since
her graduation.

Mayberry Jr. hits game-winner,
Team USA improves to 8-5
Team USA rebounded from a brutal
five-game sweep at the hands of Japan's na
tional team with two straight wins over
squads from the New England Collegiate
Baseball League. With a 4-2 victory over
Keene and a 19-2 blowout over Danbury,
the U.S. national team was boosted to an 8-
5 record.
Rising Stanford junior Jed Lowrie
scored the game-tying run in the sixth
inning of the meeting with Keene, and
fellow Stanford junior John Mayberry Jr.
— who is hitting at a .262 clip — blasted
the game-winning dinger in the top of
the seventh.
The third Cardinal member of the na
tional team, rising junior Mark Ro
manczuk, also had an interesting week,
though not from his usual spot on the
mound. In addition to grasping a 2-0
record with a 2.45 ERA, Romanczuk now
also lays claim to a 1.000 batting average.
The southpaw connected fora base
knock against Danbury in his first and
only pinch-hitting opportunity of the
2004 season.
Nine former Cardinal baseball
players sign pro contracts
Of the 10 Stanford players selected in

the 2004 MLB draft, nine have opted to ac
cept the opportunity to play professionally.
Outfielder Danny Putnam, who has
only one quarter of academic work at Stan
ford remaining, decided to leave before his
senior year after being taken in the draft by
the Oakland A's. Putnam took pre-game
batting practice with the team on June 26
and left soon after to join his Short-Season
Single-A team in Vancouver.
Fellow Class of 2005 Cardinal Donny
Lucy signed with the Chicago White Sox
and is assigned to the club's Advanced
Rookie Great Falls league. First baseman
and outfielder Chris Carter agreed to
the terms laid down by the Arizona Dia
mondbacks last month, and righthand
ed hurler Mark Jecman inked a deal
with the Cleveland Indians. With these
four beginning their pro careers after
their junior year, the Stanford squad will
be left without a senior starter in the
2005 season.
All five of the 2004 Cardinal's seniors
also signed contracts last month. Out
fielder Sam Fuld was signed by the
Chicago Cubs, the same franchise that
drafted, but did not sign him in 2003.
Utility player Brian Hall made a deal with
Toronto, middle infielder Jonny Ash is al
ready playing for Houston's Class A affil
iate in New York and righthander Drew
Ehrlich finalized a contract with the
Boston Red Sox.

from college to professional basketball.
He calls Woodson "a tremendous coach"

and remarks that he and the club's three
other draft picks have bonded quickly in
their time together.
"It's a great time right now," Childress
said in a press conference. "I'm getting
paid to play basketball, we have a good
group of guys and we're going to go out
there and work hard."
Three Stanford rowers named
to Olympic teams
Rising senior Jamie Schroeder is one of
three Stanford rowers recently named to
the U.S. Olympic team, and the first male
rower selected to the Games since 1972.
Schroeder was a member of the Cardinal
crew team in 2002 and 2003 before taking
the 2004 season off in order to work with
the men's national team. He will compete
in the men's straight four.
Two members of the Cardinal's 2003
conference champion women's eight are
also on their way to Athens. Rising junior
Samantha Magee spent the 2003 training
with the U.S. national team and will com
pete with Team USA in Athens.
Former teammate and Class of 2003
Stanford graduate Sabrina Kolker will
now be Magee's rival, as Kolker will
compete for Canada in the women's
eight. Kolker has been training with
Canada's national team full-time since
her graduation.

Mayberry Jr. hits game-winner,
Team USA improves to 8-5
Team USA rebounded from a brutal
five-game sweep at the hands of Japan's na
tional team with two straight wins over
squads from the New England Collegiate
Baseball League. With a 4-2 victory over
Keene and a 19-2 blowout over Danbury,
the U.S. national team was boosted to an 8-
5 record.
Rising Stanford junior Jed Lowrie
scored the game-tying run in the sixth
inning of the meeting with Keene, and
fellow Stanford junior John Mayberry Jr.
— who is hitting at a .262 clip — blasted
the game-winning dinger in the top of
the seventh.
The third Cardinal member of the na
tional team, rising junior Mark Ro
manczuk, also had an interesting week,
though not from his usual spot on the
mound. In addition to grasping a 2-0
record with a 2.45 ERA, Romanczuk now
also lays claim to a 1.000 batting average.
The southpaw connected fora base
knock against Danbury in his first and
only pinch-hitting opportunity of the
2004 season.
Nine former Cardinal baseball
players sign pro contracts
Of the 10 Stanford players selected in

the 2004 MLB draft, nine have opted to ac
cept the opportunity to play professionally.
Outfielder Danny Putnam, who has
only one quarter of academic work at Stan
ford remaining, decided to leave before his
senior year after being taken in the draft by
the Oakland A's. Putnam took pre-game
batting practice with the team on June 26
and left soon after to join his Short-Season
Single-A team in Vancouver.
Fellow Class of 2005 Cardinal Donny
Lucy signed with the Chicago White Sox
and is assigned to the club's Advanced
Rookie Great Falls league. First baseman
and outfielder Chris Carter agreed to
the terms laid down by the Arizona Dia
mondbacks last month, and righthand
ed hurler Mark Jecman inked a deal
with the Cleveland Indians. With these
four beginning their pro careers after
their junior year, the Stanford squad will
be left without a senior starter in the
2005 season.
All five of the 2004 Cardinal's seniors
also signed contracts last month. Out
fielder Sam Fuld was signed by the
Chicago Cubs, the same franchise that
drafted, but did not sign him in 2003.
Utility player Brian Hall made a deal with
Toronto, middle infielder Jonny Ash is al
ready playing for Houston's Class A affil
iate in New York and righthander Drew
Ehrlich finalized a contract with the
Boston Red Sox.
Childress inks 6.7 million dollar
contract with Atlanta's NBA team
The Atlanta Hawks announced on
Monday that the club has signed both of
its first-round picks — high school se
lection Josh Smith and former Stanford
standout Josh Childress. Though fran
chise policies prevented the Hawks
from disclosing the terms of the con
tracts signed, it is being reported that
Childress — who was taken sixth over
all in last month's NBA draft — has
agreed to a three-year deal worth
around 6.7 million dollars.
Hawks general manager acknowl
edged in a press conference on Monday
that Childress' agent had questions
about the contract that prevented the
2004 Pacific-10 Conference Player of the
Year from participating in part of the
first day of summer workouts in Utah.
But Childress was in action at Tuesday's
practice (wearing his new number 22)
and looked "pretty sharp" in workouts,
according to newly-appointed head
coach Mike Woodson.
Childress has expressed nothing but
contentment during his early transition
from college to professional basketball.
He calls Woodson "a tremendous coach"

and remarks that he and the club's three
other draft picks have bonded quickly in
their time together.
"It's a great time right now," Childress
