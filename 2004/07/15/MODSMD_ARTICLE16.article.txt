INTERMISSION GAMER
For the last week, I've been
wirelessly controlling a deadly
robot placed in a hostile environ
ment looking to destroy a mad
scientist and his evil robot cre
ations. And no, I'm not attend
ing Summer Research College.
Folks, I'm talking about
Mega Man, the timeless hero
that has been on video game sys
tems worldwide for 15 years. To
celebrate this momentous an
niversary, the developers at
Capcom have decided to release
a compilation of 10 classic Mega
Man tides on one video game.
For those that recall the glory
days of the Blue Bomber, or for
those just looking to check out
some nostalgic gaming, this is
the perfect title for you.
Haven't played a Mega Man
game before? You're in luck!
Every- single title plays the exact
same way. Each title has vou

controlling the blue robot in a
variety of old-school 21) plat
forming stages, with each stage
culminating in a battle with an
evil robot master. If you man
age to defeat the robot, you gain
his special weapon, which can
be used against another bad
boss. Then, you get to do it all
again with a different stage.
Mega Man may seem a little
repetitive for those newer gamers
spoiled by the current selection of
games, but for those that remem
ber his classic games, Mega Man is
where it all started. Hie graphics
are pixelated and outdated, but
the music is still top-notch and the
difficult) level is still pretty high,
even though Anniversary Collec
tion now has an auto-save feature
so players never need to memo
rize the complicated passwords
classic gamers needed to save in
order to return to a game.
