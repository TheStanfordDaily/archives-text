30. 1,004,960. Those are the numbers of winning
games and dollars, respectively, that Ken Jennings has
accumulated so far on "Jeopardy!" as of yesterday after
noon. .And he shows no signs of letting up.
Among other changes the syndicated game show
(in which contestants answer difficult clues in the form
of questions) made recently, such as doubling dollar
values and introducing the "Clue Crew," "Jeopardy!"
dropped the five-day limit for returning champions
this year. Enter Jennings, a mild-mannered software
engineer from Utah, who is making the producers
rue that decision.
A Mormon who intends to donate part of his win
nings to the Church through tithing, Ken has shown
a surprising amount of knowledge of such categories
as "Potent Potables," despite his religion's strictures
against drinking. Less surprising is his knowledge of
film, TV, and — you guessed it — comic books.
"Sometimes it pays to be a nerd," he quipped to host
.Alex Trebek.
Ken's grasp of general knowledge is impeccable,
and he has undoubtedly benefited from experience
during his long run, especially when it comes to mas
tering "Jeopardy!" 's complex lockout system. But
there is a secret weapon in his arsenal that not many
know about — Ken is an editor for the National Aca
demic Quiz Tournaments (NAQT), an organization
which supplies questions for high school and college
quiz bowl tournaments. In personal correspondence,
Ken noted that "maybe 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 of material on the
show is stuff I know because of playing quiz bowl."
(Hopefully this will inspire Stanford students to join
the University's quiz team.)
Ken has already smashed nearly every "Jeopardy!"
record, and in the past two days has twice tied the all
time one-day record of $52,000. As he closes in on
seven figures, it remains to be seen whether he will un
seat 1980 "Tic Tac Dough" contestant Thom McKee,
who won 43 consecutive games. He is not even close
to the $2.18 million earned by Kevin Olmstead on
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" Still, a backlash has
already begun, with viewers mocking everything from
Jennings' habit of adopting accents (he answered

"Who is Forrest Gump?" in a Southern drawl) to his
squeaky-clean image (which has drawn unflattering
comparisons to pop star Clay Aiken). A visitor to
http://www.jumptheshark.com objected to Jennings'
quiz background, complaining "Maybe the eligibility
requirements should be changed so ringers like Ken

Jennings can't wreck Jeopardy! anymore."
Fans of the program have already begun com
paring Jennings to the legendary winners of the
past, including New York City transit cop Frank
Spangenberg and blind USA Today sportswriter
Kddie Timanus. One fan even fantasized about a
showdown. "I'd love to see him on a Tournament
of Champions against that blind guy," he said.
"Ken would kick his ass, and the guy would never
see it coming."
