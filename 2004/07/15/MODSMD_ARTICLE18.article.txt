# Van's Warped Tour finds itself caught in awkward teen stage

INTERMISSION PUNK
NOFX may have headlined Van's
Warped Tour on July 3, but the show was
far from theirs. This year, W'arped Tour
was taken over by an angry group of bro
ken hearted teens who can scream really
loud. Van's Warped Tour celebrated its
10th anniversary this year. The summer
long, nation-wide tour has stops in virtual
ly every major city along the way. The
Warped Tour has been defined by its eclec
tic alternative brand of music ranging from
punk to ska to hip-hop. W 7 ith 10 years

under its belt, the Warped Tour is the well
established anti-establishment concert.
This year, punk legends NOFX were out
staged and out attended by the screamo
bands. For the uninitiated, "screamo" is a
rather broad label used to describe bands
that feature emo-like lyrics (Girls, suicide,
etc.) with hardcore guitars and loud screams
that can peel paint off walls. The result is
something that is more timid than hardcore
but not as (overtly) whiny as emo. Even by
sampling from the two different genres, it
sounds nothing like Sunny Day Real Estate
or the Misfits.
This is a marked departure from

Warped Tour's usual feel. Ska bands seem
to have disappeared from the lineup, and I
could only find Mohawks when New York
street punks The Casualties played. Even
the pop-punkers going to see New Found
Glory seemed to be outnumbered by the
screamo kids. But how many bands play
Warped that are screamo?
Honestly, I don't know. I saw My Chemi
cal Romance, Story of the Year, Thursday,
Taking Back Sunday and Senses Fail. All of
them vary in degrees of "screamo-ness" —
from Taking Back Sunday's textbook exam
ple to Thursday mostly political melodic
hardcore. There was a theme in the lvrics too

— the singer claimed the admired girl either
has "a gun to my head" or was strangling
them. Upbeat stuff. Also on the Warped
Tour lineup are Coheed and Gambia, Brazil
and Matchbook Romance — you can make
arguments for all of them being screamo
like as well.
There were notable exceptions to this
"summer of screamo" — Irish folk punk
Flogging Molly played well and had a
strong following, Pittsburgh anarchist
punks Anti-Flag was well received, punk
misfits NOFX headlined and the comedic
Vandals were welcomed after years of
being off the tour.
But even old-school political punk leg
ends Bad Religion found that a significant
part of the audience went to the Mauricio
side stage during their time slot. There,
haunting screamo band My Chemical Ro
mance took the stage. My Chemical Ro
mance, taking a page from the goth looks
of Alkaline Trio and AFI, offer brutal and
gory depictions of love, eased into the lis
tener's ear by catchy hooks. The simpleton
lyrics of "I'm Not Okay (I Promise)" are
compensated for by the lead singer's audi
tory bleeding into the microphone. His di
sheveled black hair looks like his linger in
an electric socket — it's enough to con
vince anyone that he is really, really not
over his last girlfriend.
Screamo seems to be the flavor of the
month for alternative music, replacing pop
punk artists like New Found Glory and
Good Charlotte. As much as we all hate fla

vors of the month and how some of these
bands do not deserve the attention they get,
one can appreciate the politically fueled en
ergy of Thursday more than the angsty lul
labies of Good Charlotte.
Still, Warped Tour feels different than
normal. If the Tour is anthropomor
phized, then this is definitely its emotion
ally-unstable teen stage. The first time
you got your heart broken by a gii 1 ■ N eah,
that's what this tour is feeling. Sure, pop
punkers have been singing about girls for
vears, but the gory lyrics and emotional
intensity of screamo lends itsell to a dif
ferent atmosphere. Top-punks Good
Charlotte dress like they play hard street
punk, and their fans follow suit. In com
parison, screamo bands dress like the\ ai e
going to a funeral. Black eye liner and
black clothes can get really hot during the
summer — maybe that s why the\ are so
emotionally fragile.
Although every single band (especially
the anarchist Anti-Flag) mentioned the
need to get George W. Bush out of office,
half the bands there were gushing about
having a torn, bleeding heart. The soul of
punk — its political edge and its rejection

of social norms — is being replaced by a
new genre, screamo. This genre's theme is
to embrace the biggest social norm ot them
all: falling in and out of love. If only these

artists could get over their emotional trau
ma, maybe next year I won't bring a tissue
box to Warped Tour, but my studded
leather jacket.
