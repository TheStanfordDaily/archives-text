# Van's Warped Tour finds itself caught in awkward teen stage

INTERMISSION PUNK
NOFX may have headlined Van's
Warped Tour on July 3, but the show was
far from theirs. This year, W'arped Tour
was taken over by an angry group of bro
ken hearted teens who can scream really
loud. Van's Warped Tour celebrated its
10th anniversary this year. The summer
long, nation-wide tour has stops in virtual
ly every major city along the way. The
Warped Tour has been defined by its eclec
tic alternative brand of music ranging from
punk to ska to hip-hop. W 7 ith 10 years

under its belt, the Warped Tour is the well
established anti-establishment concert.
This year, punk legends NOFX were out
staged and out attended by the screamo
bands. For the uninitiated, "screamo" is a
rather broad label used to describe bands
that feature emo-like lyrics (Girls, suicide,
etc.) with hardcore guitars and loud screams
that can peel paint off walls. The result is
something that is more timid than hardcore
but not as (overtly) whiny as emo. Even by
sampling from the two different genres, it
sounds nothing like Sunny Day Real Estate
or the Misfits.
This is a marked departure from

Warped Tour's usual feel. Ska bands seem
to have disappeared from the lineup, and I
could only find Mohawks when New York
street punks The Casualties played. Even
the pop-punkers going to see New Found
Glory seemed to be outnumbered by the
screamo kids. But how many bands play
Warped that are screamo?
Honestly, I don't know. I saw My Chemi
cal Romance, Story of the Year, Thursday,
Taking Back Sunday and Senses Fail. All of
them vary in degrees of "screamo-ness" —
from Taking Back Sunday's textbook exam
ple to Thursday mostly political melodic
hardcore. There was a theme in the lvrics too

— the singer claimed the admired girl either
has "a gun to my head" or was strangling
them. Upbeat stuff. Also on the Warped
Tour lineup are Coheed and Gambia, Brazil
and Matchbook Romance — you can make
arguments for all of them being screamo
like as well.
There were notable exceptions to this
"summer of screamo" — Irish folk punk
Flogging Molly played well and had a
strong following, Pittsburgh anarchist
punks Anti-Flag was well received, punk
misfits NOFX headlined and the comedic
