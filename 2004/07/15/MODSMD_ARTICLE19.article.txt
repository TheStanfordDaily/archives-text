# Roxy: Summer flings fine by me
## 
### 
ROXY SASS
SKX GODDESS
It's summer, and Roxy always
gets a little misty around this time
of year. Not just because 1 have
fond memories of seeing the line
specimens at the tennis camp
squeezed into tight white outfits,

but also because summer is
the time for meaningless,
short-term fun fests.
Roxy remembers the
pristine blue skies of Santa
Barbara and the fresh smell
of the ocean, but more im
portantly, the hordes of tan,
oiled-up bodies everywhere.
A slice of Paradise on Earth,
and Roxy was going to have
her cake and eat it too. Make
that several slices of cake.
The first question when
embarking on your summer
fling-a-thon is: How many
men can you juggle? Are
you comfortable with seeing
multiple men? "Dating"
more than one guy at a time
is not a skill that every lady
can master. Caller 11) is es
sential. You absolutely must
be able to keep names, faces
and voices (among other
body parts) straight. Red
Bull is going to be your best
friend, because you're going
to be very, very busy.
Once you've slipped into
your teeny-weeny yellow

; .. ~ ..J .. J J
polka dot bikini and have saun
tered over to the Adonis soaking
up the sun, you must remember
the rules of one-night stands. Even
Miss Manners would agree that eti
quette is never more important
than when it comes to sex between
two strangers who will probably

never see each other again. From
the get go, make sure that your
partner has no delusions of
grandeur about a future together.
Clarity about your intentions will
make it evident that there will be
no spooning after sex. Save the in
timate eye contact and cuddling for
a beautiful relationship, not a

short-lived romp in the sack. While
in the act, feel free to let go of your
inhibitions — tap into your kinkier
side, your partner doesn't know
how you normally behave. If your
bed buddy suggests, "Let's do it
again sometime," don't hyperven
tilate. They're not asking for your

hand in marriage, they probably
just want to be available as your
booty call.
Summer flings are as fleeting as
good bikini waxes, but much less
painful. You don't have to actually
like your one-night stand, but it's
not polite to act as if you do. That's
as bad as pretending to be friends

with the nerd in your
Econ class to get the an
swers to the problem sets
while making fun of him
behind his back. When en
gaging in small talk before
and after getting it on,
keep conversation light —
personal issues and life
goals are to be avoided.
After all the fun, a
lady or gentleman is always
discreet. Even though you
never laid eyes on that per
fect stranger, this does not
mean those in your social
circle haven't. ltd be a
good idea to confirm this
by logging on to The Face
book. When sharing sto
ries about your sizzling
summer, avoid name
dropping and over-the
top descriptions. Roxy re
members the scandal of
Washingtonienne, the
Capitol Hill assistant from
Syracuse who juggled
more than four govern
ment employees and offi
cials but revealed a little

too much about their identities (and
their tendency to give her lavish pre
sents and money) on her personal
blog. She was promptly fired, and
signed a lucrative contract to pose
for Playboy. Now that's not a bad
deal. Who says multiple flings can't
end well?
