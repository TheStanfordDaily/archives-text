# Computer Camp? Yes, it exists, and iD Tech leads the way

### ELIZABETH AGUILAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
For his summer vacation,
Cameron Henlin sits in a crowded
room hill of teenage boys, comput
ers and the loud sound effects of
video games. The 16-year-old
works on creating his own project
— a platform video game along the
likes of Mega Man and Mario Bros.
In the room next to him, another
group of teens work on filming a
scene. A few houses down, children

are cropping and fixing photos into
art to place on their own Web pages,
while a few more doors down the
street, another group works on edit
ing and mixing music.
Welcome to the world of iD (In
ternal Drive) Tech's computer
camp.
Computer Camp? It may not
sound exciting to some of us, but to
thousands of kids, and the 170
housed in 808, Durand and Hans
Mitteleuropa, it's a little piece
of heaven.

"It seemed like a natural step,"
said Rene Sorensen, program direc
tor at Stanford on die idea for such
a program. "There's a camp for
everything and there was a need for
something innovative and new."
Henlin, who returned for his
third year, can relate to that as his
own high school has failed to pro
vide its students college prep pro
gramming classes like the one he
takes in iD.
16-year-old Obie Copchack liked
the experience he's gained in his

first year — along with developing a
maze for his 3D game design and
animation course.
"It's a loose, hard-working envi
ronment, much like how tech com
panies describe themselves,' said
Copchack, who came in from Alas
ka, of the camp's advantages "It's
not extremely structured ("Its
camp!" Sorensen chimed in) but it is
highly motivating."
While some kids know what
they are doing, and are preparing
for college, some are just in it for

the fun. Either way, iD and Stan
ford provide an insightful look at
the college life and atmosphere —
which motivates some to l<x)k into
the near future.
"It has definitely shown CS could
be a fun career to pursue,"
Copchack said.
So what exactly makes the camp
so successful?
