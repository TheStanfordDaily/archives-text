# Computer Camp? Yes, it exists, and iD Tech leads the way
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
For his summer vacation,
Cameron Henlin sits in a crowded
room hill of teenage boys, comput
ers and the loud sound effects of
video games. The 16-year-old
works on creating his own project
— a platform video game along the
likes of Mega Man and Mario Bros.
In the room next to him, another
group of teens work on filming a
scene. A few houses down, children

are cropping and fixing photos into
art to place on their own Web pages,
while a few more doors down the
street, another group works on edit
ing and mixing music.
Welcome to the world of iD (In
ternal Drive) Tech's computer
camp.
Computer Camp? It may not
sound exciting to some of us, but to
thousands of kids, and the 170
housed in 808, Durand and Hans
Mitteleuropa, it's a little piece
of heaven.

"It seemed like a natural step,"
said Rene Sorensen, program direc
tor at Stanford on die idea for such
a program. "There's a camp for
everything and there was a need for
something innovative and new."
Henlin, who returned for his
third year, can relate to that as his
own high school has failed to pro
vide its students college prep pro
gramming classes like the one he
takes in iD.
16-year-old Obie Copchack liked
the experience he's gained in his

first year — along with developing a
maze for his 3D game design and
animation course.
"It's a loose, hard-working envi
ronment, much like how tech com
panies describe themselves,' said
Copchack, who came in from Alas
ka, of the camp's advantages "It's
not extremely structured ("Its
camp!" Sorensen chimed in) but it is
highly motivating."
While some kids know what
they are doing, and are preparing
for college, some are just in it for

the fun. Either way, iD and Stan
ford provide an insightful look at
the college life and atmosphere —
which motivates some to l<x)k into
the near future.
"It has definitely shown CS could
be a fun career to pursue,"
Copchack said.
So what exactly makes the camp
so successful?
11), in its fifth year at Stanford, of
fers children aged eight to 17 a mix
of old camp values and new techno
logical processes.
Rene Sorensen, iD program di
lator at Stanford, attributed the
success to the technological age we
currendy live in. Children know so
much about video games, diey play
video games, and so the next step
should be for children designing to
design their video games, he said.
While the price lor a one-week stay
at iD may look steep, at about $639
a week, and $989 to stay in a room
on campus, the camp gives its
campers back plenty. Each student
is assigned a personal computer.
The small classes give the students a
6:1 student / teacher ratio and these
voung instructors, who come as far
as England and Tanzania, come
highly qualified.
The Campell-based, family

owned camp is arguably one the
best educational tech camps in die
nation, with praises hailing from
across the nation. Not only is it of
fered in 36 locations in 17 states, but
it also offers a 2-1 / 2 week program
for teenagers in Spain. Even while
featured throughout die media, il)
doesn't rely solely on word of
mouth for its popularity.
"We're making games and
learning how to use Stagecast cre
ator," John Howard said, who
heard of the camp from a friend
and signed up this year with four
other friends.
"You get a Web site and do what
ever you want," commented Rachel
Plasterer.
" I'm also learning a lot about how
to program. It would be a better pas
time," added Ruchita Pendse.
I hese may sound like the older
students describing their work, but
Plasterer, Pendse and Howard and
11, 10 and 9, respectively. Not only
does il) cater to those already set to
work in the technological industry,
but it reaches out to the next gener

ation. These elementary school
children may actually know a thing
or more about HTML or Adobe
Photoshop than their parents.
" I think it'll Ik- easier to do school
projects," Pendse said.
"I'll be able to make my own Web
site alter this," beamed Plasterer.
The three kids are enrolled in
iD's Multimedia Adventures course

and die word that comes up the
most in their descriptions of the
camp is none other than "fun".
Much of the amusement, they said,
comes from being able to meet other
children with similar interests.
"It's kind of funny," said Plas
terer, who is enrolled in iD's
sports camp, and splits time be
tween the computer and fenc
ing. "We do the same things. I
say, "I like something" and
they [say] "So do I!"
Interaction with their peers is,
across all the age and class
groups, the best thing at iD.
While the camp is centered

around computer-based courses,
il) makes sure the feel of a sum
mer camp stays present with
cheers, nicknames, board games,
sports, evening activities, and of
course, a 10 p.m. lights out.
If the popularity of this com
puter camp seems question
able, the sign-up slots online
completely dispel that possibil
ity. Most sessions, for any
course, you name it, even those
over $900 — not including lab
fees — are sold out for the rest
of the summer.

The Campell-based, family

"We're making games and
learning how to use Stagecast cre

heard of the camp from a friend
and signed up this year with four
other friends.
"You get a Web site and do what

Plasterer.

The three kids are enrolled in
iD's Multimedia Adventures course

and die word that comes up the
most in their descriptions of the
camp is none other than "fun".
Much of the amusement, they said,
comes from being able to meet other
children with similar interests.
"It's kind of funny," said Plas
terer, who is enrolled in iD's
sports camp, and splits time be
tween the computer and fenc

say, "I like something" and

Interaction with their peers is,
across all the age and class
groups, the best thing at iD.

sports, evening activities, and of
course, a 10 p.m. lights out.

For his summer vacation,
Cameron Henlin sits in a crowded
room hill of teenage boys, comput
ers and the loud sound effects of
video games. The 16-year-old
works on creating his own project
— a platform video game along the
likes of Mega Man and Mario Bros.
In the room next to him, another
group of teens work on filming a
scene. A few houses down, children

are cropping and fixing photos into
art to place on their own Web pages,
while a few more doors down the
street, another group works on edit
ing and mixing music.
Welcome to the world of iD (In
ternal Drive) Tech's computer
camp.
Computer Camp? It may not
sound exciting to some of us, but to
thousands of kids, and the 170
housed in 808, Durand and Hans
Mitteleuropa, it's a little piece
of heaven.

"It seemed like a natural step,"
said Rene Sorensen, program direc
tor at Stanford on die idea for such
a program. "There's a camp for
everything and there was a need for
something innovative and new."
Henlin, who returned for his
third year, can relate to that as his
own high school has failed to pro
vide its students college prep pro
gramming classes like the one he
takes in iD.
16-year-old Obie Copchack liked
the experience he's gained in his

first year — along with developing a
maze for his 3D game design and
animation course.
"It's a loose, hard-working envi
ronment, much like how tech com
panies describe themselves,' said
Copchack, who came in from Alas
ka, of the camp's advantages "It's
not extremely structured ("Its
camp!" Sorensen chimed in) but it is
highly motivating."
While some kids know what
they are doing, and are preparing
for college, some are just in it for

the fun. Either way, iD and Stan
ford provide an insightful look at
the college life and atmosphere —
which motivates some to l<x)k into
the near future.
"It has definitely shown CS could
be a fun career to pursue,"
Copchack said.
So what exactly makes the camp
so successful?

Rene Sorensen, iD program di
lator at Stanford, attributed the
success to the technological age we
currendy live in. Children know so
much about video games, diey play
video games, and so the next step
should be for children designing to
design their video games, he said.
