## Foreign students to pay extra $100 fee to Department of Homeland Security 
### PO LI LOO THE DAILY IOWAN 
(I -WIRE) lOWA CITY, lowa—On top
of the visa-application fee imposed by the
Department of State, beginning Sept. 1,
those seeking an American education will
have to pay an additional $ 100 fee to the De
partment of Homeland Security.
Even though many students will be in
convenienced by the new fee, it likely will not
be prohibitive, said Scott King, the director
of the University of lowa Office of Interna
tional Students and Scholars. "One-hun
dred dollars isn't small money, but it isn't so
tremendous that it will be a barrier," he said.
All international students and exchange vis
itors except those on U.S. government-spon
sored programs are required to pay the fee.
11 lose intending to be an au pair, camp coun
selor or participant in a summer work-travel
program will dish out a lesser fee of $35. Pay
ment of the fee does not guarantee diat stu
dents will receive a visa, a requirement for entry
into the United States. Those who do not re
ceive a visa will not receive a refund on the fee.
Students have to provide proof that they
have paid the Student Exchange and Visi
tor Information System fee when they in
terview fora visa in their home country, but
Homeland Security officials say this will not

delay the visa-application process.
"Students do need to plan ahead, but any
delay in an application is not direcdy related
[to the processing of the new fee] in any
shape or form," said Russ Knocke, the pub
lic-affairs director of the Immigration and
Customs Enforcement Agency.
According to the U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services Web site, the fee will
be used to cover the administrative and
maintenance costs of running the comput
erized SEVIS program and ensuring com
pliance by individuals, schools and organi
zations with the system's requirements.
This added cost likely will not deter those
determined to study in the United States. If
they make it mandatory, people will still ac
cept it," said Li-Chuan Chen, a Taiwanese
doctoral candidate in the UI College of En
gineering. "Most students who plan to study
here will put it in their budget."
She admitted, however, that the addi
tional cost would make her think twice
about studying in the States.
Ring thinks the regulation is unfair be
cause the fee will be imposed on students
who ultimately may not be included in the
SEVIS database.
"It's a question of fairness, of paying a fee
so the government can watch over your
shoulder," King said.
