### CLINT JOHNSON DAILY TEXAN 
(U-WIRE) AUSTlN,Texas—The Uni
versity of Texas System will likely not be
alone if it bids in the fall fora contract to
manage Los Alamos National Laboratory.
At least two companies are also officially
considering a bid for the New Mexico
weapons lab, currendy operated by the
University of California System.
Spokeswomen for Lockheed Martin
Corporation and the Battelle Memorial
Institute, a non-profit research compa
ny, said Wednesday they formally noti
fied the National Nuclear Security Ad
ministration of their interest in the Los
Alamos contract.
The NNSA will not accept bids until it is
sues a request for proposals, which is sched
uled to happen in late August.
The administration set a July 12 dead
line for companies to submit written ex
pressions of interest, but refused Wednes
day to release information about the com
panies that met the deadline. The UT Sys
tem has already expressed its interest in
Los Alamos. Dan Saiz, a NNSA contract
specialist in charge of the bidding, said the
names and numbers of the other respon
ded were deemed confidential.

Lockheed and Battelle spokeswomen
said their companies have experience oper
ating research facilities, but that it is too
early to tell how that could influence the
bidding process.
Battelle operates four large labs, includ
ing Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which
it runs with the University of Tennessee,
said spokeswoman Kate Delaney.
Delaney said the four labs are not classi
fied as Department of Energy weapons labs,
but work at the facilities does include some
nuclear research.
"We have a long history in nuclear re
search, and we might be interested in Los
Alamos," she said.
She said Battelle also plans to
compete with a partnership that in
cludes Bechtel Corp. and Texas A&M
University fora contract to manage
Idaho National Engineering and Envi
ronmental Laboratories.
Bechtel spokesman Jonathan Marshall
refused Wednesday to discuss rumors of
the company's interest in Los Alamos.
Lockheed has operated Sandia National
Labs, another DOE weapons lab, since
1993, said spokeswoman Wendy Owen.
The UT System also considered a bid to
manage Sandia in 2002, but the DOE ex
tended Lockheed's contract until 2007.
