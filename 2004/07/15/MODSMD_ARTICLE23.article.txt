# Call of the wild: Working far away from civilization
## 
### 
Every year as summer
approaches, Stanford
students solicit jobs
from professors, look
for interesting work abroad,
and rack every corner of their
brain for the perfect summer
option. And while many stu
dents enjoy the outdoors, few
find themselves roaming the
backcountry in uniform, as a
park ranger. 1 am one of these
unusual few.
This summer I am volun
teering in Olympic National
Park in Washington State, and
while I miss sunny California,
living in a national park has
much to offer.
Far removed from the fast
paced. electronic-intensive life
I've been living, I now find my
self spending five days a week
without Internet access or cell
phone service, telling people
that they can't take their dogs
up trails or leave food out when
camping. I advise people on
which trail to take, and issue
backcountry permits — I meet
almost everyone who comes to
the domain of the park to
which I am beginning to feel
some claim.
Apart from the change in
lifestyle, being a park ranger en
tails living next door to many
species of wildlife.
Just the other day I was cook
ing dinner in the small govern
ment housing quarters where I
live, when I heard a hooting
through the open window. I ran
outside with my friend Sanny,
who has worked in this area for
quite a long time and knows all
the owl hoots to the point of
even imitating them fairly well.
The male and the female
were hooting back and forth —
the female hoot slightly higher
pitched than the male. Then the
two juveniles joined in, with a
whistle-like call that apparently
indicated their desire for food.
This, in turn, solicited a differ

cnt call from the adult Bard owl,
a locating call full of vibrato.
Sanny and I decided to try to
see them.
We silently crashed around
in the forest fora while, until we
could hear them right above us.
And just as owls are known for
being absolutely soundless in
llight, so are they equally im
possible to discern by eye in
fading dusk perched in a tree.
But with the crack of a twig un
derfoot, the owl knew of our ex
istence and took flight, soaring
directly overhead.
Not something I see everyday
in Palo Alto.
The less pleasant part of
being a park ranger is the law
enforcement side — and al
though volunteers do not issue
tickets, 1 have stood by while un
happy campers who had left
food out overnight cursed at
David, a fellow park ranger, who
was writing them a $50 ticket.
We have all felt empathy for
those in the car pulled over on
the side of the road receiving a
speeding ticket, but I would
venture to guess that rarely
have you stopped to feel sorry
for the police officer doing his
or her duty and finding him or
herself called an asshole. David
later told me how hard it was
for him to restrain his emo
tions. "I don't let people treat
me like that in my private life,"
he said.
At the end of the month, I
will return to Palo Alto where I
will be working fora professor,
like so many other Stanford
students. While I have not dis
covered the cure for cancer
while wandering Olympic Na
tional Park, it is a great oppor
tunity for those who enjoy the
outdoors and would like to
spend the summer living in a
national park.
