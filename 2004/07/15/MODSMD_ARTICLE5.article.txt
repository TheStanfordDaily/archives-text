### ELIZABETH AGUILAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
Any developments in the national
search fora new University judicial of
ficer, who would start at Stanford this
fall, remain undisclosed. Assistant
Dean Rick Yuen will continue serving
as a judicial officer until his interim
position ends Aug. 31.
"[At this moment a new officer] has
not been posted," said Laurette Bee
son, Stanford's judicial advisor.
According to the Office of Judicial
Affairs, Dean of Students Greg Board
man has not made any final decision
regarding the still-available position as
of yet.
However, the University is currently
searching fora judicial affairs special
ist, Beeson explained. This specialist
would work with the officer and advisor
as a team, and in certain cases act as the
officer or advisor as well. The duties of
such a position would also include
working through other educational ac
tivities to promote knowledge about the
school's judicial procedures.
While the judicial officer's spot re
mains to be filled, there is reportedly a
lot of interest.
"Stanford is a very attractive place to

want to work," Beeson said. "It's a good
job if people have worked in [those
types of areas before]."
The process lor finding a new officer
may be a difficult one. As for the reason
why it has taken a while to find "the
right match", Beeson cites the unique
process and system the school has
adopted. Above many qualifications, the
office is looking for someone with a per
sonality that would best fit its system.
The Office is also looking for good in
vestigating skills in a candidate, as well
as someone who is sensitive to those he
or she will work with — Stanford's fac
ulty, staff and students.
"Stanford is a difficult place to be," she
said. "People have very high expectations."
The judicial officer at Stanford is in
charge of investigating the facts of a
complaint before charges can be filed
concerning misconduct with the Uni
versity's Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code. He or she is the principal
investigator in these cases, meeting
with all those involved in the case and
gathering evidence. The officer then
decides whether there is enough evi
dence to make formal charges against a
student. Other duties include receiving
reports and complaints, notifying stu
dent's of complaints and presenting in

formation at the Judicial Panel.
"It takes a delicate balance and per
son who is tenacious yet sensitive," Bee
son said. "A person who understands
the politics of the University and will
not be swayed by them."
Meanwhile, Yuen, also the director
of the Asian American Activities Center,
has been doing a "good job". He had
previously worked as a hearing dean
and judicial counselor.
Yuen, who was not available for im
mediate comment, has been serving as
the officer since Nancy Morrison, for
mer assistant to the dean of students,
left in mid April. Morrison served at
Stanford for five years and is currently
assistant vice president for student af
fairs at New York University.
Since the available spot is not a fixed
term position and there is no one wait
ing to be appointed or ready to step up,
an interim officer is needed to keep
things running smoothly. The Office of
Judicial Affairs tries to prevent cases
from waiting.
"Spring quarter is when we get the
most number of cases," said Beeson
of the need for an interim officer dur
ing the busy summer. "We've had a
couple of hearings, and we have several
more scheduled."
