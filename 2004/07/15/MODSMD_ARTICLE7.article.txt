# New study finds overweight parents tend to have overweight children
## 
### SARAH RIZK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent study conducted by several
Stanford Medical School researchers
shows a strong correlation between par
ent and child obesity .
Researchers examined nearly 20
possible risk factors that would con
tribute to child obesity and studied
these factors in 150 children from
birth to 9.5 years of age. The study
showed that the strongest predictor
for an overweight child was an over
weight parent. Following that were
sensitive child temperament, low
parental concern about the child's
thinness, frequent child tantrums
over food, and relatively little sleep
during childhood.
Stanford Prof. Emeritus W.
Stewart Agras, who works in psy
chiatry and behavioral sciences,
led the group of scientists in this
study. Agras is also the author ot
the article "Risk Factors for Child
hood Overweight: A Prospective
Studv from Birth to 9.5 years,"

which appeared in the July 1 edi
tion of Journal of Pediatrics.
"It's important to identify risk fac
tors because they may provide a way to
alter the child's environment and re
duce the chance of becoming over
weight," said Agras in a recent Medical
School press release.
The study found that 64 percent
of children with overweight parents
became overweight, while only 16
percent of those with normal-weight
parents had weight problems; a 49
percent discrepancy. Also, 46 per
cent of children with a sensitive dis
position and overweight parents be
came overweight, rather than 19
percent of those who did not have a
sensitive disposition.
"One possibility is that tempera
ment and overweight are linked
genetically," states the article in the
Journal of Pediatrics.
"An alternative mechanism is that
overweight parents may overcontrol the
behavior of such children, for example,
excessively prompting food use."
As Agras explained in the press re

lease, if temperament is not directly
genetically linked to becoming over
weight, it may be indirectly related. A
parent with a sensitive child may com
fort the child with food; if the parent is
overweight, he or she is probably
more likely to engage in this activity,
placing the child in a high-risk catego
ry. Agras hopes to educate parents
about this possibility.
"It's probably not a good idea to use
food as a calmer," Agras said, according
to the press release. "If we can identify
kids with difficult temperaments we
could educate parents not to use fixxl as
a reward."
Agras and his colleagues are un
clear as to why sleeping less during
childhood years would be linked to
becoming overweight, although
Agras hypothesizes that there may be
a third factor involved and leading to
obesity — less sleep may be a result of
less physical activity.
Other factors that the research
team studied, which seemed to have

less to no effect on a child's
weight, included parent eating
and feeding behaviors, child
caloric intake, parenting behav

iors and maternal weight gain.
While this study offers in
sight into several of the fac
tors associated with becoming
overweight, the small popula
tion size that was studied, in
addition to several differ
ences between the population
studied and the American

population make it an imper
fect indicator for obesity
across America.
