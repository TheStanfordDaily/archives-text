## WEST OF CENTER Workplace Policies report marks a long-awaited step forward 
### 
With little fanfare, the Presi
dential Advisory Committee
on Workplace Policies re
cently released its long
awaited final report at its Web site,
http://workplacepolicies.stanford.edu.
Although labor advocates have criticized
the committee process as slow-moving
and secretive, the final report should be
recognized as a step forward.
There are three main lessons to take
from the report. The first is that, as labor
advocates have asserted, we are indeed

simply not keeping
track of many of the
workers in our com
munity. A large por
tion of those who work
on the Stanford cam
pus are hired not di
rectly by the Universi
ty but by companies
who perform contract
work for Stanford or
lease land on campus.

As the committee noted, Stanford has no
information about the wages, health in
surance coverage or even number of these
workers. The committee would have liked
to survey some of them about working
conditions, but as the report states, "Stan
ford does not know who they are and
where they live."
The second lesson is that there are se
rious costs associated with Stanford's use
of low-wage labor. The committee found
that two-thirds of workers hired at $8 an
hour or less (in 1998 dollars) had left
their jobs by the end of the year. High
turnover and low job satisfaction results
in less productivity and lower-quality
work. Continually replacing and retrain
ing workers also has direct costs in the
human resources department. Workers
without health insurance are likely to
miss more days of work due to illness,
and are more likely to get other workers
sick when they come in. While it's impor
tant to recognize that there are tradeoffs
involved in increasing workers' wages,
too often advocates of better worker
treatment do not emphasize the econom
ic benefits of a very qualified, high
morale, healthy workforce. As it is, we are
not paying many workers we hire
enough to keep them at Stanford.
The third lesson is grounds for opti
mism. Despite the lapses affecting part
time and contract labor, conditions for
most regular full-time workers employed
directly by Stanford are very good. Stan
ford employees typically get decent wages
and health insurance, are satisfied with
their work environment and are proud to
be a part of the Stanford community. Al

though the existing living-wage policy
does not cover many Stanford workers,
those covered bv the policy seem very sat
isfied. This means that our most valuable
asset — Stanford's values, image and rep
utation — continues to be meaningful to
most employees. We can capitalize on and
enhance that asset by extending our good
employment practices to the remaining
workers not yet covered, and likely recoup
most of the cost by increasing productivi
ty, efficiency and morale. The committee
report suggests, for example, that tremen
dous job satisfaction gains could be re
couped simply by extending health insur
ance to a small number of workers who do
not have it.
Moving forward, the clear next step is
to establish data collection procedures
about the campus employees that were
not covered by this report. Stanford could
require companies that perform contract
work with the University or lease land on
campus to disclose employees' names and
addresses, how much they are paid and
what sort of benefits they receive. This sort
of information, almost costless to collect,
would allow us to get a much better pic
ture of the conditions in our community.
A further step for the campus commu
nity to consider is how far to extend the
great employment policies Stanford cur
rently offers many of our workers. Do we
want to extend half our benefits coverage
to half-time workers? It might not be a bad
idea. Likewise, broadening the scope of
our living-wage policy would probably
cost us little — increased wages being off
set by decreased turnover — but would
amount to a realization of the implicit
principle promised by adopting a living
wage policy in the first place.
Stanford is able to excel largely because of
its intangible assets: Students come because
they admire Stanford's image, faculty come
because they appreciate Stanford's reputa
tion, alumni give because they love what Stan
ford stands for. In light of the recent commit
tee report, will we take elementary steps to
gather data, recognize the costs of low-wage
employment and see that we have a great
record to build on by simply extending our
good employment policies? Or will we fritter
away Stanford's precious intangible assets, our
values and the goodwill and cohesion of the
Stanford community, due to economic short
sightedness? Now that the committee has
given us the information we need, it's time, in
the words of University President John Hen
nessy, to take action and "make Stanford the
best possible place for all its employees."
