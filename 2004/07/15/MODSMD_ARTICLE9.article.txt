## Glorifying excess in America 
### PATRICK MATTIMORE 
The cornerstone of the planned Free
dom Tower in New York City was laid on
July 4, the same day that Takeru
Kobayashi set the world hotdog-eating
record at a Coney Island contest.
The Freedom Tower, which will be
come the world's tallest building when it is
completed in 2008, is being built at the for
mer site of the World Trade Center. By re
placing the VVTC Towers with the world's
tallest building, the United States is an
nouncing to worldwide terrorists that it
can remake itself in even grander fashion
than before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Kobayashi won Nathan's Famous
hotdog-eating contest for the fourth year
in a row by consuming 53 and a half
wieners in 12 minutes. He has been feted
for his accomplishment and was profiled
in newspapers and on television specials
prior to his record consumption. Accord
ing to a report in this week's Sports Illus
trated, Kobayashi earns $150,000 a year
as an eater.
If the U.S. Surgeon General Richard
Carmona has his druthers, the United
States will rebuild its gustatory proclivities
with the same relish as it reserves for its
fight on terror.
Carmona, a former SWAT member,
has repeatedly drawn the analogy be
tween obesity and terror calling child
hood obesity "every bit as threatening to
us as is the terrorist threat we face today.
It is the threat from within." Mr. Car
mona's quote is posted on a Web site fora
recent Obesity Summit.
Last year, speaking to a group at the
Public Safety Wellness conference in Or
lando, Carmona called obesity "an epi
demic" and"a health catastrophe" that
has already killed millions, according to a

news report in the Orlando Sentinel.
That same source reported that near
ly two of three North Americans are over
weight or excessively fat and that obesity
has increased nationwide by 50 percent in
the last decade. Only about one quarter of
high school students get the recommend
ed 30 minutes of exercise each day, and
the number of overweight adolescents has
tripled since 1980.
Speaking several weeks ago to a
group of health care and business leaders
in New Hampshire, Carmona discussed
some causes of obesity. He believes that
large food portions, the fact that people
eat indiscriminately and the elimination
of physical activity programs in schools
contribute to our weight problems.
Giuliano Hazan, a cooking instructor
and the author of "Every Night Italian ,
offers a prescription in a recent New York
Times submission. Hazan argues that it is
not so much what we eat as the speed at
which we eat it. As a nutritional example,
Hazan cites Italy, which has only half the
percentage of overweight or obese people
as in the United States. In Italy, people eat
a great deal of pastas and breads (over
half of Italians interviewed say they eat
pasta every day), but they consume food
at a leisurely pace and avoid the tempta
tion to grab a quick bite.
We might do well to rethink our friv
olous attitudes about pie-eating contests
and timed frankfurter engorgements. We
certainly don't consider videotaped ter
rorist beheadings innocuous sport. Nei
ther should we promote dangerous soci
etal attitudes about our eating behaviors.
