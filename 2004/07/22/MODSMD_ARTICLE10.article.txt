The governor has proposed a tuition hike of
$5,000 next year at Boalt, the graduate law school
at Berkeley. That proposed increase would come
on the heels of a $3,000 hike last year. Similar dra
matic increases in tuition at the state's other public
institutions will make it increasingly difficult for
middle-class students to get an education beyond
secondary school.
When I enrolled at The University of Califor
nia, Hastings College of the Law in 1980, that
$8,000 increase would have covered the tuition costs
of two students for their entire three years in school
and left them with about $400 spending money
each. Indeed, at the time, Hastings and the other
UC graduate schools cost less than 10 percent of
comparable private schools and were much cheaper
than virtually every other state school. Today, many
state universities are less costly than the UC schools
and even the most expensive private schools cost
only a third more than the UC schools. With the
state facing a fiscal mess, it's time to develop some
creative solutions to financing college and graduate
education at our public institutions.
One solution would be to link reduced tuition
costs to work / study programs. Law schools might
require newly minted lawyers to serve stints as pub
lic defenders and prosecutors handling misde
meanor cases. This would reduce the backlog of
cases and would improve the quality of the profes
sion. No doubt similar accommodations could be
made at other state graduate schools and under
graduate institutions as well.
Making a University of California education af
fordable does not solve another problem, however
â€” accessibility. Unfortunately, we have endowed
the "name" universities with mystical properties
and accord those gatekeepers credentials far out of
line with the services they actually provide. It has
not always been thus. Until 1973, Berkeley and
UCLA accepted any applicant who graduated in
the top eighth of a high school class in California
and 25 years ago they still accepted two-thirds of all
applicants who had passed that hurdle, according

to Nicholas Lemann, Dean of the Journalism school
at Columbia. Today both institutions reject many
class valedictorians.
Our brand name consumerism consciousness
has been fueled by both our own headlong insis
tence to keep up with the Brahmins as well as by the
artificially fanned rankings of universities by
sources such as U.S. News and World Reports. It is
a phenomenon with which we are all familiar. How
many of us will plunk down an extra $30 for
"Nikes" or pay triple the price fora Coke instead of
a generic cola?
Robert Cialdini in his classic book, "Influence,"
tells an instructive tale about the Mormon Temple in
his hometown of Mesa, Ariz. Cialdini reports that he
had never been interested enough in the temple to
go inside until the day he read a newspaper article
that told of a special inner section of Mormon tem
ples to which no one had access but faithful members
of the church. Fora few days after a temple was built
or refurbished non-Mormon visitors could see the
temple area traditionally banned to them. Cialdini
resolved to take the tour until he called a friend who
wondered why he seemed so intent on visiting some
place he had never been inclined to see and in which
he expected to find nothing more spectacular or stir
ring than what he might see at a number of other
churches in the area. Cialdini realized the sole allure
of seeing the temple was because that possibility
would soon be unavailable. We should not assume
that because something is difficult to achieve that it is
necessarily worth achieving. #
We are being squeezed at the entrances to our
University of California institutions by higher costs
and more rigid academic standards. However,
there is precious little evidence to suggest that once
inside we receive anything like the supernatural
benedictions and nostrums we believe we have pur
chased. Maybe it's time to ask whether we shouldn't
just take our business elsewhere.
