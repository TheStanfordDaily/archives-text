## Take Vlade, drop the Diesel? No way

Chaos reigns in Southern California. The Los
Angeles Lakers this week decided to hang on
to Kobe Bryant and release Shaquille O'Neal
to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Brian
Grant and a raft full of Cuban refugees, marking one
of the worst decisions in their illustrious history.
The Lakers' primary reasoning behind releasing
Shaq seems to be his age. At 32, he is still capable of
dropping the 36-point, 20-board performances charac
teristic of his early career, but his game has deteriorat
ed since the beginning of the Lakers' dynasty-in-train
ing. Also, the L.A. front office has had a long-running
grudge against Shaq for his proclivity to cruise through
the regular season and then turn it on in the playoffs, in
addition to his tendency to show up to training camp
unprepared and well above his playing weight. The de
cision to release O'Neal and re-

tain Bryant, then, was one for the
future of the franchise — dump
ing an aging superstar in order to
reload for the next decade.
However, this means that
the Lakers are left with Kobe
Bryant as their sole franchise
player, a man who, while capa
ble of dominating a game, may
in all likelihood be the No. 1
draft pick in the Colorado State
Penitentiary basketball league

next season. The jabs Shaq laid
on Kobe before leaving were subtle, but he made it
clear that the disparity in the "off-the-court" per
sonas the two men exhibited would have repercus
sions for the franchise. Translated, this means that
while Shaq would spend the upcoming season
lounging in his mansion with his children and
thinking up new nicknames for himself, Kobe's
focus will probably be split between hitting jumpers
and keeping his ass out of prison.
The Lakers' new center will be — are you ready
for this, Los Angeles — Vlade Divac, former Laker
and erstwhile Sacramento King, and a fine-looking
man at that. The Serbian big man who popularized
(all right, maybe "popularized" is the wrong word)
the hot "five days' beard" look, likes to kick back after
games with a pack of Marlboro Lights. Despite his
fashion sense and health-conscious approach to the
game, Divac's primary imprint on the Lakers fran
chise during his tenure there in the early 1990s was
as an actor. Divac's strength as a center has always
been in his ability to work with the officials rather
than against his opponents. Vlade has committed an
astonishing zero fouls in his history as a King, since
every single foul charged to him was, judging by his
mastery of the"I never touched him!" facial expres
sion, a grievous officiating mistake.
So the Lakers, after searching the league fora suit
able replacement for the premier big man in the league
who was, in their assessment, past his prime, settled on
Divac, a 15-year veteran. "Past his prime" does not
begin to describe Divac, whose rebounds per game have
dropped off drastically over the past three years. While
some critics argued that Shaq's occasional lack of hustle
on the court hurt the Lakers, Divac is less mobile than
Christopher Reeve trapped inside a glacier. It also does
not appear to bother the Lakers that, apart from Bryant
