# Olympic Trials leave some in limbo
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
After nine days of competition at track
and field Olympic Trials, most of the
1,000 athletes went home Sunday night
either with tickets to Athens or with bro
ken dreams. Even if they went home dis
appointed, they at least had the comfort
of knowing that their years of work had
been decided.
But five athletes who are Stanford grad
uates went home without that comfort.
Alumni Jonathan Riley and Jason
Lnnn and Class of '04 graduates Jill Ca
marena, Louis Luchini and Grant Robison
instead went home with question marks
looming over their heads. Their Olympic
dreams are still alive, but not secured; they
must wait to see what they and their com
petition do over die next few weeks.
I"he general rule at the trials is diat die
top diree finishers in each event who have
made the Olympic "A" qualifying mark
earn a berth on the Olympic team. Things
get tricky, however, when not all of the top
three finishers have an "A" qualifier under
their belt.
Camarena, a seven-time All-American
and school-record holder in the shot put,
finished third in the shot, but was short of
making the 18.55 meter "A" qualifier. Ifshe
can launch an 18.55-meter or better dirow
between now and August 9, she will be the
third Stanford woman headed to the
Olympics for shot put.
"I think I'm ready to hit the 'A' stan
dard," Camarena told media oudets after
last Friday's final. "As long as I can do
that, everything else will work out. If I

don't do it on Sunday, then it's back to
work on Monday and I'll be looking for

more meets.
Jonathan Riley, NCAA champi
on in 2001 and two-time indoor na
tional champion, ran die 5,000 me
ters in 13:30.85 to finish second
place behind defending national
champion Tim Broe. Broe pulled
ahead on the home stretch fora de
finitive win at 13:27.36, but unlike
Riley, Broe has not yet achieved the
Olympic "A" standard of 13:21.50
or even the "B" standard of
13:25.40.
Accordingly, Broe will be listed
as an alternate on the Olympic
team roster but will be able to chase
the"A" and "B" standards for the
next few weeks and hopes to do so
at a race two-weeks from now in
London. If Broe achieves die "A"
standard by August 9, both he and
Riley will go to Alliens. If he doesn't
achieve either standard, Riley will
head to the Olympics without him.
But if Broe achieves the "B" stan
dard, he will go to Athens and Riley
will stay home.
"I think lim has a great shot at
die 'A' standard, and I'm in an in
teresting position," Riley said. "For
me to qualify, he either has to run
under 13:21 to get the 'A' standard

or slower than 13:25, so he gets neither
standard. 1 came in expecting to win, but
knew Tim would probably be the biggest
competition. That's why they have the
race, you have to go out and earn it."
Riley ran well for the majority of the

race but ran out of gas widi about 600 me
ters left.
"I wish I would have had more left

he said.
Riley shared the track with June gradu
ates Luchini and Seth Hejny who finished
12di and 13th. Luchini is one of die two adi-

Alum Jonathon Riley is one of several atfiietes that
has an Olympic berth hanging in the balance un
less he hits the Olympic "A" qualifying mark.
