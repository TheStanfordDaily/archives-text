# Nnamani, Tom heading to Athens
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
. Logan Tom, Class of '02, had been on
the cover of the inaugural issue of Sports
Illustrated for Women, led the Cardinal
and the Pac-10 in kills and aces, and
helped Team USA finish fourth in Sydney
before she finished her sophomore year.
Only an NCAA championship had es
caped her.
That elusive title would not come until
she was joined on the court by fellow out
side hitter, then-freshman Ogonna Nna
mani. The one-two punch proved unstop
pable in the collegiate field in 2001.
Three years later, Tom and will-be se
nior Nnamani are together again on the
court. I his time, however, they're in
Team USA uniforms and in search of gold
at Athens.
The duo is currently competing on
Team USA in the World Grand Prix —
the final competition before play be
gins at the Olympics on August 14.

Since 10 of the 12 teams competing in
the Grand Prix are also going to
Athens, the tournament serves as a rea
sonable indicator of what to expect at
the Games.
At the midpoint in the tournament —
with two weekends of play behind them
and two weekends ahead for them —
Team USA is ranked fourth with a 4-2
record behind Brazil (6-0), Cuba (6-0) and
China (5-1).
America swept Thailand (1-5) twice
and also beat Korea (1-5) but lost 3-2 to
both China and Cuba — two of the teams
that America will face in its Olympic pool
come August.
Tom played well against Cuba, scoring
a match high of 25 points, 23 kills, a block
and an ace, but it just wasn't enough.
Cuba, led by Yumiika Ruiz, edged out
Team USA 23-25, 25-17, 22-25, 25-22,
15-13.
"We had a tough match," lom told

media outlets after the game. "We
had a chance to beat Cuba, but we
let our chances slip away. I'm a bit
upset with the loss, but it's just
one match."
Fresh lrom the loss, l earn USA re
bounded this past Friday.

Tom led the team to its biggest
victory of the tournament thus
far, outdoing her match-high
with 26 points to beat Italy (4-2)
in five sets. Tom also had a
match-high five service aces on
top of 17 kills and four blocks in
the 25-20, 17-25, 18-25, 25-22,
17-15 victory that assured Ameri
ca's fourth ranking and knocked
Italy to fifth.
Following Tom's lead, Nna

mani was the team's third top
scorer with 14 points in the
match against Italy — quite a
feat for one of the four rookies
named to the national team just
this past January.
Nnamani may have a few years
less experience than Tom, but she
is not short on talent. When she
took to the court as a freshman,
Nnamani averaged 3.88 kills a
game second only on the team to

then-junior Tom. This past sea
son, Nnanami posted 627 kills,
breaking Tom's school record of
621 kills in a single season.
Both Tom and Nnamani were
named Volleyball Magazine's
Freshman of the Year as freshmen
on the Farm, and the 2001 NCAA
championship shows what they can
do together. Time will tell how far
this powerful hitting duo can go on
the international scene.

Next weekend, Team USA will
travel to Rostock, Germany, to face
two other teams that will be in its
Olympic pool: Russia (3-3), which
is currently ranked sixth, and Ger
many (2-4), which is currently
ranked seventh in the tournament.
They will also play Thailand again.
If Team USA maintains its top
five ranking in the tournament
standings, it will travel to Italy for
the finals from July 27 to Aug. 1.
