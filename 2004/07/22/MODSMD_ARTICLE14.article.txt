# Nnamani, Tom heading to Athens

### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
. Logan Tom, Class of '02, had been on
the cover of the inaugural issue of Sports
Illustrated for Women, led the Cardinal
and the Pac-10 in kills and aces, and
helped Team USA finish fourth in Sydney
before she finished her sophomore year.
Only an NCAA championship had es
caped her.
That elusive title would not come until
she was joined on the court by fellow out
side hitter, then-freshman Ogonna Nna
mani. The one-two punch proved unstop
pable in the collegiate field in 2001.
Three years later, Tom and will-be se
nior Nnamani are together again on the
court. I his time, however, they're in
Team USA uniforms and in search of gold
at Athens.
The duo is currently competing on
Team USA in the World Grand Prix —
the final competition before play be
gins at the Olympics on August 14.

Since 10 of the 12 teams competing in
the Grand Prix are also going to
Athens, the tournament serves as a rea
sonable indicator of what to expect at
the Games.
At the midpoint in the tournament —
with two weekends of play behind them
and two weekends ahead for them —
Team USA is ranked fourth with a 4-2
record behind Brazil (6-0), Cuba (6-0) and
China (5-1).
America swept Thailand (1-5) twice
and also beat Korea (1-5) but lost 3-2 to
both China and Cuba — two of the teams
that America will face in its Olympic pool
come August.
Tom played well against Cuba, scoring
a match high of 25 points, 23 kills, a block
and an ace, but it just wasn't enough.
Cuba, led by Yumiika Ruiz, edged out
Team USA 23-25, 25-17, 22-25, 25-22,
15-13.
"We had a tough match," lom told
