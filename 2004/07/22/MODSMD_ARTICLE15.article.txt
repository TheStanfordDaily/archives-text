# Davenport picks up third Bank of the West singles title; Johnson selects new men's basketball assistant coach
## 
### JESSICA PETERS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Perhaps the unpredictable is what
makes sports exciting, but fans got exactly
what they expected this weekend at the
Bank of the West Classic, which was held
at Taube Family Tennis Stadium. The top
two seeds of the tournament — Venus
Williams and Lindsay Davenport —
plowed through the competition and met
up in the final on Sunday night.
The two superstars battled for two
hours and 55 minutes under the watch
of a sellout crowd, and eventually Dav
enport eked out a victory 7-6 (4), 5-7, 7-
6(4).
It was Davenport s third career Bank of
the West title (she pulled out back-to-back
victories in 1998 and 1999) and the fourth
time in seven years that she faced Williams
in the final of the event. Williams lost her
shot at her third career crown on the Stan
ford courts, but maintains a 12-11 edge in
all-time matches against Davenport.
The meeting may have been the last for
the two tennis phenoms, as Davenport has
hinted throughout the year that she will
retire before next season.
The tandem of Eleni Daniilidou and
Nicole Pratt snapped up the doubles title

with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Iveta Benesova
and Claudine Schaul.
The Bank of the West Classic is the
longest-running women-only tournament
in the world and has been held on Stan
ford's campus since 1997.
Hepp hired as men's basketball
assistant coach
When Trent Johnson arrived on the
Farm to replace Mike Montgomery at the
helm of the Cardinal basketball program,
he vowed that few changes would be made
to the staff already in place.
So far, Johnson's kept that promise.
Faced with the task of choosing an as
sistant coach — former assistant Russell
Turner opted to join Montgomery's Gold
en State Warriors coaching staff —John-
son kept it in the family and hired L.J.
Hepp, who for the past year has been serv
ing as the program's video coordinator.
Hepp, a graduate of the University of
North Carolina with a bachelor's in 2001
and a master's degree last year, was in
volved in the Tar Heels basketball pro
gram during his time at the school. He will
focus his energies here on the Farm to re
cruiting, scouting opponents and individ
ual instruction.

"I have been very fortunate to be sur
rounded by such a knowledgeable and
committed staff," Johnson said. "L.J. is
certainly no exception. He is well on his
way to developing into an excellent head
coach."
Three Stanford affiliates named to U.S.
Olympic water polo team
Any Stanford student that heard of
rising senior Tony Azevedo's selection
to the Olympic water polo squad proba
bly had only one thing to say about it:
Duh.
The three-time Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation and NCAA player of
the year is one of the top players in the
world (and a 2000 Olympian), so Team
USA simply seems a natural place for him
to be.
Azevedo will be joined by 1994 grad
uate and three-time Olympian Wolf
Wigo — who has been named the team's
captain — and 1998 graduate Layne
Beaubien. Wigo and Azevedo have each
led their Cardinal teams to two national
crowns, while Beaubien has had his
hand in one championship himself.
The U.S. squad troops into Athens
ranked sixth overall. The Americans faced

off with No. 3 Serbia and Montenegro two
weeks ago and emerged with a win, in ad
dition to pulling an upset victory over top
ranked favorite Hungary earlier this
month.
Quick gets Olympic nod for sixth
consecutive Games
Stanford women's swimming coach
Richard Quick was selected as the assis
tant coach for the U.S. Olympic swim
team this week, sending him to his sixth
Olympics in as many opportunities. He
was the women's head coach in 1988, 1996
and 2000, in addition to being the assis
tant coach to the women in 1992 and the
men's team in 1984.
Quick has coached several successful
U.S. Olympic medalists, including former
Stanford swimmers Jenny Thompson and
Misty Hyman. 112
The Pacific-10 Conference produced all
of Team USA's coaching staff for Athens.
Southern California head coach Mark
Schubert will take the head coaching spot
for the Olympics, while Arizona's Frank
Busch and California's Teri McKeever
(the first woman ever named to a U.S.
Olympic swimming coaching staff) will be
Schubert's other assistant coaches.

and 2000, in addition to being the assis

men's team in 1984.

Perhaps the unpredictable is what
makes sports exciting, but fans got exactly
what they expected this weekend at the
Bank of the West Classic, which was held
at Taube Family Tennis Stadium. The top
two seeds of the tournament — Venus
Williams and Lindsay Davenport —
plowed through the competition and met
up in the final on Sunday night.
The two superstars battled for two
hours and 55 minutes under the watch
of a sellout crowd, and eventually Dav
enport eked out a victory 7-6 (4), 5-7, 7-
6(4).
It was Davenport s third career Bank of
the West title (she pulled out back-to-back
victories in 1998 and 1999) and the fourth
time in seven years that she faced Williams
in the final of the event. Williams lost her
shot at her third career crown on the Stan
ford courts, but maintains a 12-11 edge in
all-time matches against Davenport.
The meeting may have been the last for
the two tennis phenoms, as Davenport has
hinted throughout the year that she will
retire before next season.
The tandem of Eleni Daniilidou and
Nicole Pratt snapped up the doubles title

with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Iveta Benesova
and Claudine Schaul.
The Bank of the West Classic is the
longest-running women-only tournament
in the world and has been held on Stan
ford's campus since 1997.
Hepp hired as men's basketball
assistant coach
When Trent Johnson arrived on the
Farm to replace Mike Montgomery at the
helm of the Cardinal basketball program,
he vowed that few changes would be made
to the staff already in place.
So far, Johnson's kept that promise.
Faced with the task of choosing an as
sistant coach — former assistant Russell
Turner opted to join Montgomery's Gold
en State Warriors coaching staff —John-
son kept it in the family and hired L.J.
Hepp, who for the past year has been serv
ing as the program's video coordinator.
Hepp, a graduate of the University of
North Carolina with a bachelor's in 2001
and a master's degree last year, was in
volved in the Tar Heels basketball pro
gram during his time at the school. He will
focus his energies here on the Farm to re
cruiting, scouting opponents and individ
ual instruction.

"I have been very fortunate to be sur
rounded by such a knowledgeable and
committed staff," Johnson said. "L.J. is
certainly no exception. He is well on his
way to developing into an excellent head
coach."
Three Stanford affiliates named to U.S.
Olympic water polo team
Any Stanford student that heard of
rising senior Tony Azevedo's selection
to the Olympic water polo squad proba
bly had only one thing to say about it:
Duh.
The three-time Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation and NCAA player of
the year is one of the top players in the
world (and a 2000 Olympian), so Team
USA simply seems a natural place for him
to be.
Azevedo will be joined by 1994 grad
uate and three-time Olympian Wolf
Wigo — who has been named the team's
captain — and 1998 graduate Layne
Beaubien. Wigo and Azevedo have each
led their Cardinal teams to two national
crowns, while Beaubien has had his
hand in one championship himself.
The U.S. squad troops into Athens
ranked sixth overall. The Americans faced

off with No. 3 Serbia and Montenegro two
weeks ago and emerged with a win, in ad
dition to pulling an upset victory over top
ranked favorite Hungary earlier this
month.
