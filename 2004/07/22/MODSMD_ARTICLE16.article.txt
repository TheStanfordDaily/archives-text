## Isaac Asimov is rolling in his grave: 'I, Robot' 
### CHRIS LEE INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
In a pivotal moment of "I, Robot", action
star Will Smith utters a chillingly prophetic
line. "Somehow," he says,"I told you so just
doesn't quite cut it." He is, of course, refer
ring to the manmade robots wreaking havoc
in his new summer tlick — an army of im
possibly limber, computer-generated acro
bats that sport spooky plastic faces.
Those of us with less interest — or is that
restraint? — will want to believe that he is
talking about the movie itself, which at
tempts the brave and idiotic task of combin
ing two entirely disparate genres: a serious
science fiction parable (sci-fi author Isaac
Asimov's well thought-out philosophies on
robot behavior) and a Will Smith summer
blockbuster. Somehow, "Isaac Asimov is
rolling in his grave" just doesn't quite cut it.
Smith stars as Detective Del Spooner, a
Chicago cop living in the year 2035 who
seems to be the only man still distrusting of
robots. The movie posits that in three
decades the use of humanoid robots will
have become so common that there will be
one robot for every five people on earth.
(Considering that the highest level of artifi
cial intelligence found in homes today is the
Roomba, I'd say we're pretty safe.) Spoon

er's distrust of robots is ridiculed by all those
around him because as everyone knows ro
bots are programmed with three fundamen
tal laws that prevent them from injuring any
living person.
Fortunately for Spooner, the founder of
U.S. Robotics, Alfred Lanning (James
Cromwell), soon winds up dead. His mur
derer appears to be none other than Sonny
(voiced and performed by Alan Tudyk, in a
process similar to the creation of Gollum
from "Lord of the Rings"), a special robot
Lanning built to have dreams and experi
ence emotions (doesn't every robot inventor
build one of those?). Bridget Moynahan,

who might be mistaking her
own character fora robot,
plays the role of Emotionally
Aloof Hot Scientist Woman —
oops, I mean "renown robot
psychologist Susan Calvin."
Before long Spooner and
Calvin realize that Sonny is the
least of their worries; there are
greater forces at work, as they
eventually find themselves
fighting against entire produc
tion lines of once docile robots.
The movie's one shot at cin
ematic greatness (or at least
self-respect) lies in its director

Alex Proyas, whose lush, eerie sci-fi noir
"Dark City" demonstrated an impeccable vi
sual style and the potential tor innovative
ideas. Remarkably the story Proyas has cho
sen to tell — though laced with that Phillip K.
Dick paranoia that is all the rage these days —
is actually serviceable. The biggest distraction
in the movie is Will Smith himself; simply put,
that "Bad Boys" swagger with which he
throws himself around is entirely out of place
in a narrative meant to be exploring the pos
sibility of free will in artificial intelligence. Oh,
that and the machine-guns. Aid the hordes
of unrealistic-looking CGI robots that leap
and crawl all over cars, buildings and people.

Still, I have to confess that by the end of it
all I still found myself caught up in the final
action sequence, heart aflutter, rooting for
one humanoid robot to triumph. That Brid
get Moynahan sure is a looker.
