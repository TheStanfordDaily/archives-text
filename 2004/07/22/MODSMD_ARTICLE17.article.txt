# What's on your Osaka to-do list? Well, if you have one, that is...

### SHAWN STANDEFER INTERMISSION JAPANOPHILE 
I'm spending my summer in Osaka, Japan. Be
sides being hot and humid, the subway is packed
uncomfortably tight with commuters every

-morning. Nonethe
less, things are going
pretty well. The gener
al atmosphere here in
Osaka is different from
the rest of Japan â€” it
is a bit rougher around
the edges and every
one is a bit louder than
elsewhere.
For anyone inter
ested in visiting, there
are only two particu
larly touristy things
that you should check
out. The Osaka, also
known as Kaiyukan,
Aquarium is wonder
ful. Kaiyukan, which
literally means "play-

ing in the sea pavilion," is huge and reasonably
priced to wander around in fora few engaging
hours. Its exhibits focus primarily on the habi
tats and creatures found in the Ring of Fire (Pan

Pacific Volcanic Zone) and the Ring of Life (Pan
Pacific Life Zone).
You should also check out Osaka Castle,
which is located on the main train line in the
city, a distinct sight among the modern build
ings and skyscrapers. Originally a temple, it
was destroyed and burnt down before it was re-

built by the Tokugawa
shoguns in the 1620s
(only to have its main
tower struck by light
ning 30 years later).
The castle underwent
reconstruction in 1931
and renovation in
1997, which keep it
looking like new. Osaka
castle remains Osaka's
most imposing histori
cal monument.
After the two
tourist spots are out of
the way, you should
hop on the subway and
head over to Tsu
ruhashi for some Kore
an food. Why have Ko-

rean food in Japan? It's tasty and is hard to find
outside of Osaka.
