# What's on your Osaka to-do list? Well, if you have one, that is...

### SHAWN STANDEFER INTERMISSION JAPANOPHILE 
I'm spending my summer in Osaka, Japan. Be
sides being hot and humid, the subway is packed
uncomfortably tight with commuters every

-morning. Nonethe
less, things are going
pretty well. The gener
al atmosphere here in
Osaka is different from
the rest of Japan — it
is a bit rougher around
the edges and every
one is a bit louder than
elsewhere.
For anyone inter
ested in visiting, there
are only two particu
larly touristy things
that you should check
out. The Osaka, also
known as Kaiyukan,
Aquarium is wonder
ful. Kaiyukan, which
literally means "play-

ing in the sea pavilion," is huge and reasonably
priced to wander around in fora few engaging
hours. Its exhibits focus primarily on the habi
tats and creatures found in the Ring of Fire (Pan

Pacific Volcanic Zone) and the Ring of Life (Pan
Pacific Life Zone).
You should also check out Osaka Castle,
which is located on the main train line in the
city, a distinct sight among the modern build
ings and skyscrapers. Originally a temple, it
was destroyed and burnt down before it was re-

built by the Tokugawa
shoguns in the 1620s
(only to have its main
tower struck by light
ning 30 years later).
The castle underwent
reconstruction in 1931
and renovation in
1997, which keep it
looking like new. Osaka
castle remains Osaka's
most imposing histori
cal monument.
After the two
tourist spots are out of
the way, you should
hop on the subway and
head over to Tsu
ruhashi for some Kore
an food. Why have Ko-

rean food in Japan? It's tasty and is hard to find
outside of Osaka.

From there, one should defi
nitely check out the electronics
district of Osaka, Den-den
Town. You can check out the

newest electronics
and video games in
Japan at some of the
best prices you'll
find. It is also one of
the few places in
Japan where barter
ing works.
While wandering
around shopping
and sight-seeing, vis
itors to Osaka should
try some tako-yaki, a
dish the native Os
akans are extremely
proud of. It consists
of a cooked ball of

dough with a small piece of octo
pus placed in the center. Some
sauce and seaweed is sprinkled
on top, and it usually come in
packs of six. It isn't hard to find
a street vendor selling these
wonderful little treats, and they

really shouldn't be passed up.
They're great fora budget too,
running at only a couple of
American dollars.
If the humidity gets to you,
I'd advise stopping into one of
the air-conditioned Mr.
Donuts stores, which are a
Japanese take on the familiar

donut shop. No threat to
Krispy Kreme, the donuts are
so-so, but the real treat here is
the green tea milkshake (or
any flavor really) fora mere
two dollars. While this price
might not rival the McDonalds

value menu back home, drinks
in Japan usually run around
$3 to $4 in restaurants, so a
relatively cheap milkshake is a
great deal.
While wandering around the
city, especially in the Namba or
Umeda areas, you're sure to find
many shops to siphon off your

money. Japanese
clothing is known
for its innovative
style and futuristic
fabrics, so it's hard to
resist buying some.
After spending all
your money on
snacks, clothes and
transportation, how
does one spend the
evening?
That one is easy
to answer: all-night
karaoke. The all
night specials will fit
even the meager.

Throw in a few free drinks to
loosen your vocal chords and in
hibitions, and you're ready to belt
out one of the available English
selections. No trip to Japan is
complete without at least one trip
to a karaoke joint.

many shops to siphon off your

money. Japanese
clothing is known
for its innovative
style and futuristic
fabrics, so it's hard to
resist buying some.
After spending all
your money on
snacks, clothes and
transportation, how
does one spend the
evening?
That one is easy
to answer: all-night
karaoke. The all
night specials will fit
even the meager.

Throw in a few free drinks to
loosen your vocal chords and in
hibitions, and you're ready to belt
out one of the available English
selections. No trip to Japan is
complete without at least one trip
to a karaoke joint.
