# In new Gamecube's 'Tales of Symphonia', save the world ... again, again and again (and again)
## 
### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION GAMER 
Being charged as the sole
barrier between life and the
total destruction of the world is

nothing spectacular for
the video game enthusi
ast. Saving the world
doesn't require diplomat
ic skills or a polisci de
gree; all you need is the
best equipment, a pletho
ra of healing spells and a
lot of time to level up your
characters.
Enter "Tales of Sym-

phonia," Namco's newest (and
quite possibly first) role playing
title for the Nintendo Game
cube. Taking the role of a body
guard on a quest to protect a
young woman given the re
sponsibility of saving the world,
you will travel the globe, discov
er new and exciting weapons,
and go on a detour to become
the best cook in the world (no
joke). The overall story is very
standard for most RPGs (love,
betrayal, surprises and, of

course, religious controversy),
which means that the tale
should provide enough interest
to fuel the average gamer to the
very last battle.

system featuring very nicely
drawn cell-shaded characters
on a polygonal backdrop. This
provides a unique experience
for American audiences that
haven't had much opportunity
to play a cell-shaded RPG.
There are a few shortcomings
in other aspects of the graph
ics, but overall it adds more
than it detracts.
One of the more important
aspects of any RPG title is the
music, and I'm happy to say that
the "Tales" soundtrack succeeds
beautifully. There are vocal,
choral and orchestral tracks fea
tured throughout the game,
adding immensely to the atmos
phere of each scene. My only
gripe is that a few tracks are
overused in several sections, but
other than that, it works.
I he biggest draw for "Tales
of Symphonia" is its unique ac
tive battle system. Most role
playing games feature a turn
based system, where both he
roes and villains wait their
turn before they end up pum
meling each other (as if any
one would ever wait their
turn). "Tales," however, fea
tures battles that are fast, furi
ous and most importantly, fun
for the player. Battles are
never yawn-inducing or em
barrassingly easy to win. Like
the arcade hit "Dance Dance
Revolution," each battle won is

given a grade by the game.
Earn enough good grades and
you can trade them in to learn
a new spell fora character.
Each new encounter gives the
player another opportunity to
learn a new technique or to
train in parrying and counter
attacks that became crucial to
winning in the later parts of
"Tales." This is one part that
will interest any action gamer
and help spread the populari
ty of this title.
As far as longevity and game
play is concerned, "Tales"
should keep any RPG gamer
busy for many hours. There are
countless side quests to under
take and many hidden tech
niques to discover and master.
I he game also features simple
puzzles to solve in between all
the hectic action.
"Tales of Symphonia" should
be given credit simply for being
the first Gamecube RPG. How
ever, it's also an entertaining
title with an engaging story, ver
satile battle system and enough
goodies in there to keep anyone
busy for the summer. Definitely
recommended.
