# His news is bigger than your news: Ferrell shines as '70s 'Anchorman' Ron Burgundy
## 
### SCOTT HOWARD INTERMISSION ONLINE FILM CRITIC 
Everyone's taste in movies is different. A lot of peo
ple can't wait to see "Alien Vs. Predator" (OK, maybe
not a lot of people, but they do exist) while I would
probably be more excited by staring at vinyl siding. I
am well aware that my undying love for European and
Asian art cinema places me well outside of the movie
watching mainstream, but comedy is the genre that

really makes me feel alone in the world. Whenever
you read about a failed TV show that was cancelled
despite "a devoted cult following," I'm usually a mem
ber of that cult ("Mr. Show," "Freaks And Geeks,"
l he State," probably "Da Ali G Show" in the near fu
ture). However, I usually find top-rated sitcoms and
Adam Sandler movies to be about as funny as
1 Schindler's List." To make me laugh, I need some
thing that straddles the fine line between the sophis

ticated and the moronic.
Will Ferrell doesn't just straddle that line, he is the
line. His bizarre, anarchic style may leave many audi
ences cold, but in a lot of ways he is to my generation
what John Belushi and Eddie Murphy were to previous
ones: edgy comics who effectively owned "Saturday
Night Live" by playing strange and unforgettable char
acters in a way that was completely their own. His
movies up to this point have been middling at best (ex
cept for the divisive genius of "Zoolander"), mostly be-

cause they cast Ferrell as dopey average guys
when he should be doing what he does best:
thick-necked, gravel-voiced, megalomanical
alpha males with both feet firmly planted in the
surreal (Robert Goulet, The Lover, George W.
Bush, Neil Diamond). "Anchorman: The Leg
end of Ron Burgundy" is purely and unmistak
ably his, from the flawless re-creation of the shal
low 1970s to the neo-absurdist dialogue (his ex
clamations are typically something like "By the
beard of Zeus!").
For those of us who love Ferrell when he's at his
weirdest, this is a dream come true. Freed from
the confines of sketch comedy and network cen
sors, he's able to push his characters to their lim
its and makes great use of the scope, budget and
length that film allows. Ferrell assembles a fantas
tic cast including many of the best comedians
working today — from talented upstarts like

Steve Carell to unflappable legends like Fred Willard —
who, somehow, all hold their own. The film is complete
ly devoid of the sappy, halfhearted romantic drama that
ultimately kills many of today's comedies; when we fear
that attempts at sincerity will creep in during a love
scene, Ferrell quickly puts us to rest by whispering, "I'm
storming your castle on my steed, m'lady."
Now comes the bad news: nobody else laughed. I lost
it every 10 to 12 seconds, but the rest of the audience sat

in dead silence, offering up a mere chuckle or two, and
robotically filed out of the theater once it was over. It
was late on a Sunday night, so maybe everyone was de-

pressed that they would have to go to work in the morn
ing, but I was still shocked since I couldn't remember
the last time I laughed harder in a theater.
So, if you're one of those people who crack up at a
tagline such as "His news is bigger than your news,"
you'll probably agree with me. Otherwise, you'll proba
bly be one of those people sitting motionless in the the
ater, getting annoying by people like me for alternately
giggling like a little girl and yelling like a retard.
