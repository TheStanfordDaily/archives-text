# Two babies abandoned in PA
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
No shame, no blame, no names.
Due to the discovery of two abandoned babies in Palo
Alto over the past two weeks, the slogan for California's
Safely Surrendered Baby I .aw has attracted much at
tention lately. Yet while the separate cases of infant death
happened next door to Stanford, many students are still
in the dark about the law.
I Tie law provides a way out for soon-to-be-due moth
ers with an unwanted child. Women in 44 states now have
the option to leave their child at a hospital or fire station in
some eases with three days of the newborn's birth. Identi
fied with bracelets, the mother also has die opportunity to
reclaim a child within two weeks of dropping it off.
1 mplemented in 2001, the law, in retrospect, seems as
il it could have provided the answer for the two local
women. Whether the women knew about the law is yet
unknown, but the Santa Clara County district attorney
is now urging for the law to be made known in an effort
to prevent any more attempts at baby abandonment.
Hie first such infant abandonment made news across
the bay area. According to a police report, 23-year-old
Maria Ana Quinones of Palo Alto hid her unwanted preg
nancy from her family and delivered the baby in Febru
ary. Construction workers found a decomposed body
wrapped in a garbage bag near a condominium complex
on El Camino Real near the Days Inn Motel Quinones
worked at Quinones, who only speaks Spanish, faces 25
years to life if convicted in the death of her full-term child.
Just tills week, a second discovery even astonished local
fx>lice. The owner of the 548 Webster St. apartment lound
the dead baby in Ophelia Vartider Hill's former residence.
Hill reportedly left die apartment in April and had not
lived there since. The 31 year-old was arrested on Sunday
and is held without bail under suspicion of manslaughter

and cruelty to a child. Hill is originally from South Africa.
Public Service Announcements have been made in
English and Spanish addressing the law, which targets
those in the 14-to-38 age group, but most women on
campus — and in the state — are unaware it exists.
"I had no idea about the law but I feel it is an impor
tant law for all young women to know," said Stanford
student Preeya Jayakar.
Brochures published by California's Department of
Social Services state the law's intention as to "protect in
fants from abandonment". Creators of the law ultimately
hope baby abandonment will cease to take place. Hie law
has somewhat succeeded, saving at least 56 lives from
abandonment and possibly death, but there have been 98
other cases where babies were found abandoned.
While the community at Stanford is different from
that of cities, the recent attempts to dispose of an un
wanted child bring to light what is and isn't available to
women in distress in college.
Hie Palo Alto Police Department suggested that hos
pitals should have more information regarding the law.
Vaden Health Center is known to most Stanford stu
dents, whether they have visited or not, but if the center
provides enough information, especially on what's avail
able for those already pregnant, for its patients may be
questionable. Jayakar felt that an improvement would be
to make a course on women's health a requirement, as
many odier women in Stanford are in a similar position
and do not take advantage of the services provided.
"There are enough resources at Stanford, but not
enough people use them, and we have all the counselors
and resources we need but they may not be accessible
enough," Jayakar said.
Vaden does provide free services to its registered stu
dents, including medical appointments and counseling.
It also provides resources to help students avoid preg
nancy and STDs.
