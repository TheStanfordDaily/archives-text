## Construction begins on Kavli Building at SLAC 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford researchers hope to deepen their knowl
edge of the universe's mysteries with the construction of
a new building at die Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. June 28 marked the ground breaking for the Fred
Kavli Building, intended to house the Kavli Institute for

Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC).
The planned 25,(XX) square-foot center, set to open
next year, will include an auditorium and a laboratory
area. Its construction was made possible by a $7.5 million
pledge from physicist Fred Kavli and the Kavli Founda
tion in January of last year.

KIPAC is working in conjunction with a number of
eminent organizations on projects designed to uncov
er dark matter and energy, the elusive materials com
prising 96 percent of our universe. Three major pro
jects are set to take place by the fledgling institute,
which started its scientific program just last year.
"Our programs range from physics that happens
in the very early universe to the physical processes of

current sources like black holes, both
from a theoretical and experimental
standpoint," articulated Steve Kahn,
the deputy director for KIPAC, in a
press release.
Higher energy accelerators, coupled
with better observation of the universe,
are expected to yield impressive results for
scientists. Hie Kavli Building has been a
vanguard in this effort through its plans to
engineer a digital camera fora telescope
with 20 times the capability of those cur
rendy used to map the sky. The Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a
joint venture of die National Science
Foundation and Department of Energy,
with KIPAC lending a helping hand in
designing the largest digital camera ever
built. ITie six-foot, thousand-plus-pound
camera will have pixel capability 500 times
the strength of the consumer version, aid
ing the capturing and recording of even
the faintest objects in die sky.
"The telescope will help us under-

stand dark energy, using dark matter as a probe," Kahn
added in his press release.
KIPAC is also on board for another project with the
Department of Energy and NASA in a proposed space-

The Fred Kavli Building, currently under construction at the Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center, will have over 25,000 square feet of space.
