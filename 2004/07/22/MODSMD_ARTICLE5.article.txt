## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Stanford student Daniel J ung pleaded "not guilty"
to counts of murder, unauthorized use of a motor ve
hicle and aggravated vehicular homicide in a case in
which he allegedly stole a family car and ran over and
killed his father Yong H. Jung, 68, in Westlake, Ohio,
and injured his mother, 61 year-old Jemma Jung.
Jemma Jung told police that her 22-year-old son
had been suspended from Stanford. Jung was last
enrolled at Stanford in December and he was
studying physics. Jung had been a Florence Moore
West resident.
Jung's sister, Carol Jung Rivera, told the police ofa
conversation that occurred a week before the alleged
murder, in which her brother talked to her about
killing her and her parents and using $166,000 from
insurance to pay his way through Stanford Universi
ty, said detective James Janis at a municipal court
hearing held Monday.
Retelling the story of the murder in court, Janis

said that Daniel Jung became upset because his par
ents would not let him take the family's Nissan Max
ima to a store to buy orange juice because his mother
needed the car to drive to work. Daniel wouldn't get
out of the back seat of the car.
When his mother got out of the car, Daniel Jung
climbed over the seat and got behind the wheel. He
then reversed the car, hitting his mother with the
open driver's door. His dad ran toward the car,
grabbed the door and tried to reach into the car.
Daniel Jung shifted into drive and veered left. The
car crushed Yong Jung's left leg and body. Daniel
Jung then took off with the car.
His father, a chiropractor, died of injuries to his
head, chest and abdomen on Sunday, July 11, when
the incident took place. Jem ma Jung, 61, was treated
for minor injuries including a broken wrist.
Daniel Jung turned himself in on Tuesday at a
homeless shelter in Toledo after police issued a war
rant for his arrest. After his surrender, Janis said that
Jung told police that he thought he'd only broken his
dad's legs. But he also said he hated his fadier for
putting him through a lifetime of mental and physical
abuse, according to Janis.
Jung's lawyer, Kevin Cafferkey, told the judge that
Jung had not intended to kill Yong H. Jung. Caffer
key said Jung feared his father, who was skilled in
martial arts and had hit his son in the past.
"He was looking to escape," Cafferkey said.
The judge forwarded the case to a Cuyahoga
County grand jury and denied a request to reduce

Jung's $2 million bond.
I don't think he's presented himself as anything
other than an unpredictable individual," the judge said.
Daniel Jung has had a history of run-ins with the
law, including alleged charges of a hit-and-run in
2002, which were later dropped in Rocky River Mu
nicipal Court. J ung was also in a federal court because
he tried to take a stunt gun past a security checkpoint
at an airport.
A court official wrote that Jung's driving history
and the Rocky River charges suggested, "anger man
agement problems and trouble controlling his im
pulses," according to The Cleveland Plain Dealer.
The official also wrote that Jung's mother said that
her son was spoiled and undeveloped socially. Daniel
Jung told the court official that he had a 2.7-grade
point average at Stanford but that he knew he could
do better, as stated b\ The Plain Dealer.
