Stanford student Daniel J ung pleaded "not guilty"
to counts of murder, unauthorized use of a motor ve

which he allegedly stole a family car and ran over and
killed his father Yong H. Jung, 68, in Westlake, Ohio,
and injured his mother, 61 year-old Jemma Jung.

the incident took place. Jem ma Jung, 61, was treated
for minor injuries including a broken wrist.
Daniel Jung turned himself in on Tuesday at a
