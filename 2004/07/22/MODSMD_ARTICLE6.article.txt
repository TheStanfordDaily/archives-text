# Increased growth in research fields creates concern
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
I he University's rate of
growth must be restrained, em
phasized a report done by Stan
ford's Planning and Policy
board. The report, presented to
the Faculty Senate in June, also
advised the faculty to play a
larger role in curbing the
school's growth.
One of the main focuses of
the report was to minimize the
negative consequences of the
school's increased growth. Stan
ford lists its tenure line faculty
at 1,749 but has further hired
3,500 employees in the span of
the last decade. Most of these
employees work in specific re
search-associated programs.
The increase in funding for re
search, especially in the field of
medicine, is credited for the re
cent growth.
"It is clear that over the past
10 to 15 years there has been
rapid growth of many programs
and facilities in medicine, science
and engineering but relatively
little growth in most other parts
of the University," said the re
port. "Continued rapid growth
in these areas will affect the Uni
versity in profound and largely
unpredictable ways."
Mentioned by the PPB were
upcoming growth problems
with Santa Clara's General Use
Permit and the financial bur
dens that can arise with new
buildings and programs. The
report also cites mounting pres
sure on the faculty and staff to
overlook these problems.
"Accommodating the needs
of growing research endeavors
puts significant demands on the
University infrastructure . . .
and administrative support,"
the report stated.
Entitled "Perspectives on
Growth", the study asked various
faculty members for their opin
ions on the University's growth.
An establishment of rates for sus
tainable growth appears to be top
priority for the future.
"Any constraints on growth
must recognize the importance
of maintaining the creative and
dynamic spirit that has made
Stanford great," the report said.

"We need to continue to attract
(and retain) the very best facul
ty, researchers and students."
Perspectives proposed six
recommendations to help curb
the rate of growth over the next
20 years. These included
"mechanisms to develop (and
enforce) sustainable rates of
growth in the number of staff
and the amount of incremental
space utilization on the core
campus", a plan to move new fa
cilities off campus, and more
faculty involvement with a focus
on staff taking responsibility for
the cost and maintenance of ini
tiatives. Also suggested were
support and fundraising of in
terdisciplinary programs on be
half of the University, and bet
ter interaction with the sur
rounding community, especial
ly concerning public schools
and land in the area.
"I think it's fair to say that
what PPB is really saying in our
report is that we fully recognize
that it is the entrepreneurial
spirit of the faculty that is dri
ving growth, and that the facul
ty is more than willing to be
part of the process of govern
ing," said Geophysics Prof.
Mark Zoback to the Faculty-
Senate when he presented the
report, according to the meet
ing's minutes.
" I want to thank the PPB fora
lot of hard work and a good job
of listening to many people and
codifying remarks," concluded
Provost John Etchemendy after
the report's presentation "1
think that the recommendations
certainly will be considered and
many of them implemented."
Not everyone, however, com
pletely agrees with the findings.
At the Faculty Senate's last
meeting, where the report was
the principal item of business,
criticisms arose.
"As the report relates to the
School of Medicine, however, I
think that many of the comments,
or at least a number of the com
ments, from my point of view, are
unnecessarily provocative," said
Dean of the School of Medicine
Phillip Pizzo, as noted in the
meeting's minutes. "I think that that
they set a tone that really is not in the
best interests of the University."
Perspectives focuses in par
ticular on the increase in research,
staff and initiatives in the Medical

Center and the engineering and sci
ence departments. This includes the recent plans and construction for
a new building at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
It was noted that while the school would like to grow, its expansion
must be managed for Stanford to remain "balanced". The report noted
a concern with growth in certain areas but as Pediatrics Prof. Harvey
Cohen was quoted in the minutes, "The realities are that some schools
are bigger and some schools are smaller ... nothing more, nothing less."
Former Senate Chairs Hank Freely, Brad Osgood and Rickford
commissioned the study in the fall 0f2002. The Senate will pass on the
report to next year's senate. The full report can be found on the Fac
ulty Senate's Web site at http://www.facultysenate.stanford.edu.

ing's minutes.
" I want to thank the PPB fora
lot of hard work and a good job
of listening to many people and
codifying remarks," concluded
Provost John Etchemendy after
the report's presentation "1
think that the recommendations
certainly will be considered and
many of them implemented."
Not everyone, however, com
pletely agrees with the findings.
At the Faculty Senate's last
meeting, where the report was
the principal item of business,
criticisms arose.
"As the report relates to the
School of Medicine, however, I
think that many of the comments,
or at least a number of the com
ments, from my point of view, are
unnecessarily provocative," said
Dean of the School of Medicine
Phillip Pizzo, as noted in the
meeting's minutes. "I think that that
they set a tone that really is not in the
best interests of the University."
Perspectives focuses in par
ticular on the increase in research,
staff and initiatives in the Medical

Center and the engineering and sci
ence departments. This includes the recent plans and construction for
a new building at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
It was noted that while the school would like to grow, its expansion
must be managed for Stanford to remain "balanced". The report noted
a concern with growth in certain areas but as Pediatrics Prof. Harvey
Cohen was quoted in the minutes, "The realities are that some schools
are bigger and some schools are smaller ... nothing more, nothing less."
Former Senate Chairs Hank Freely, Brad Osgood and Rickford
commissioned the study in the fall 0f2002. The Senate will pass on the
report to next year's senate. The full report can be found on the Fac

I he University's rate of
growth must be restrained, em
phasized a report done by Stan
ford's Planning and Policy
board. The report, presented to
the Faculty Senate in June, also
advised the faculty to play a
larger role in curbing the
school's growth.
One of the main focuses of
the report was to minimize the
negative consequences of the
school's increased growth. Stan
ford lists its tenure line faculty
at 1,749 but has further hired
3,500 employees in the span of
the last decade. Most of these
employees work in specific re
search-associated programs.
The increase in funding for re
search, especially in the field of
medicine, is credited for the re
cent growth.
"It is clear that over the past
10 to 15 years there has been
rapid growth of many programs
and facilities in medicine, science
and engineering but relatively
little growth in most other parts
of the University," said the re
port. "Continued rapid growth
in these areas will affect the Uni
versity in profound and largely
unpredictable ways."
Mentioned by the PPB were
upcoming growth problems
with Santa Clara's General Use
Permit and the financial bur
dens that can arise with new
buildings and programs. The
report also cites mounting pres
sure on the faculty and staff to
overlook these problems.
"Accommodating the needs
of growing research endeavors
puts significant demands on the
University infrastructure . . .
and administrative support,"
the report stated.
Entitled "Perspectives on
Growth", the study asked various
faculty members for their opin
ions on the University's growth.
An establishment of rates for sus
tainable growth appears to be top
priority for the future.
"Any constraints on growth
must recognize the importance
of maintaining the creative and
dynamic spirit that has made
Stanford great," the report said.

"We need to continue to attract
(and retain) the very best facul
ty, researchers and students."
Perspectives proposed six
recommendations to help curb
the rate of growth over the next
20 years. These included
"mechanisms to develop (and
enforce) sustainable rates of
growth in the number of staff
and the amount of incremental
space utilization on the core
campus", a plan to move new fa
cilities off campus, and more
faculty involvement with a focus
on staff taking responsibility for
the cost and maintenance of ini
tiatives. Also suggested were
support and fundraising of in
terdisciplinary programs on be
half of the University, and bet
ter interaction with the sur
rounding community, especial
ly concerning public schools
and land in the area.
"I think it's fair to say that
what PPB is really saying in our
report is that we fully recognize
that it is the entrepreneurial
spirit of the faculty that is dri
ving growth, and that the facul
ty is more than willing to be
part of the process of govern
ing," said Geophysics Prof.
Mark Zoback to the Faculty-
Senate when he presented the
report, according to the meet
ing's minutes.
" I want to thank the PPB fora
