The leaders of France, Germany,
Russia and a number of smaller
countries — dubbed "Old Europe"
by Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld — criticized George W. Bush's rush
to war in Iraq a year and a half ago as hasty,
rash and stupid. They w ere right. Despite bril
liant military planning, tremendous expendi
ture by the American public and a courageous
effort by American troops and ordinary Iraqis,
the war has failed in all of its diree stated goals.
We have not eliminated a safe haven for ter
rorists, we have not destroyed dangerous
stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and
we have not created a flourishing democracy
in Iraq. Some of these failures are surprising;
others were predictable from the start. Now
Bush is begging for help from die very allies he

once insulted. If French
President Jacques Chirac
tells Bush to go get help
from Cyprus and Malta,
who can blame him?
But is Old Eu
rope's opposition to the
war, as Europeans claim,
based on a principled al
ternative vision for the
world, one in which in-

ternational institutions
maintain peace based on genuine coalition
building and international law? Or are critics
right that French opposition stems from knee
jerk anti-Americanism, military weakness, po
tentially lucrative oil deals with Saddam's gov
ernment and the temptation to free-ride on
American military power? We can tell
whether Europe is principled or hypocritical
based on what European leaders do else
where in the world. Here's four steps Euro
peans should take if they're serious about their
alternative international vision.
1) Call the genocide in Sudan what it
is, and do something about it:
When New Europe's leaders signed state
ments in support of Bush's war in Iraq,
Jacques Chirac observed that "they missed a
great opportunity to shut up." The question
now faces Chirac: Was it Bush's rashness that
created this great opportunity to shut up, or is
France's policy to keep quiet whenever there's
a problem to be solved? Murder, starvation
campaigns, mass rape and scorched-earth tac
tics by government-supported militias in die
Darfur region of Sudan have already killed
30,000 black Sudanese and driven a million
from their homes. If the international com
munity doesn't act, 300,000 more may die. In
ternational law means nothing if this extermi
nation is allowed to continue. Pressure will
probably be enough; if not, Old Europe has
the military capacity to stop the ill-equipped,
ill-trained, disorganized Janjaweed militia.
Will they step up to the task, or will they sit
back, have another glass of wine, and talk

some more about international law?
2) Ante up to stabilize Afghanistan:
If Old Europe is going to sit out Iraq,
fine, but the action in Afghanistan was gen
uinely international. By deciding to invade,
the global community incurred an obligation
to restore Afghanistan to stable, legitimate
government. Currently, regional warlords
and Taliban-sympathetic militias have taken
over the countryside and smaller cides. In
ternational forces are too few to enforce law
outside the capital, giving Afghani President
Hamid Karzai the mocking tide "mayor of
Kabul." Plans for upcoming national elec
tions will fail if militias are allowed to contin
ue killing anyone who registers to vote. Even
if Iraq has distracted the United States from
the war on terror and has caused us to break
our promises to the Afghani people, that
doesn't justify Europe breaking its promises
also. The Europeans need to send enough
peacekeepers to provide security outside of
Kabul, and they need to do it soon.
3) Start spending money on troops
and nation-building:
More broadly, Europe's vision of a inter
national order ruled by law rather than might
does not justify its failure to invest in security
forces. To mean anything, international law
requires international law-enforcement. If
Europe's vision of law is that the Security
Council will vote on what U.S. troops can and
can't do, it's not going to work. To play a role
in world affairs commensurate with its
wealth, Europe will need effective military
force. Realistically, Europe will never be able
to shock and awe like U.S. troops did on the
way to Baghdad. But the Europeans do bring
legitimacy, training in international law and a
strong civil service culture. Europe could pro
vide the global community with peacekeep
ers, reconstruction planners, police trainers,
educators and judicial advisors. As it is, Euro
pean defense spending is too little, uncoordi
nated and spent mosdy on Cold-War era
armies or flagship projects that look more like
employment programs.
In Old Europe, efforts to remove Iraq's dic
tator, build democracy in Afghanistan and stop
genocide in the Sudan may look like expensive
and time-consuming distractions from Euro
pean stockpiles of hors d'oeuvres. Perhaps in
ternational law is just an excuse. If so, it's unfor
tunate: I too was suckered in by European talk
of a responsible and democratic international
community, guided by law, universal morals
and strong institutions, acting to promote
peace, freedom, and prosperity worldwide.
Was it just talk, or does Old Europe intend to
practice what it preaches? ITie next few months
will mark a crucial test of Europe's internation
alist resolve: We'll find out soon enough.
