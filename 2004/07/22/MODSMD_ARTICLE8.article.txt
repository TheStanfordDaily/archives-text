## Evidence for school choice 
### HERBERT J. WALBERG 
Parents are seizing new opportunities
to choose their children's schools through
vouchers and charter schools. But does
such school choice improve learning and
lead to other improvements in schooling?
The evidence from a variety of studies
shows that it does.
Analyses of student achievement indi
cate that school choice leads to higher lev
els of learning in various parts of the Unit
ed States and other countries. Better stud
ies show stronger and more consistent ef
fects, and no study points to substantially
poorer performance of choice schools.
Surveys show that parents most often
choose private and public charter schools
with academic standards superior to regu
lar public schools. Parents are as adept as
education experts in evaluating the acade
mic offerings. To meet parents, desires for
such offerings, charter schools are ex
panding their numbers and enrollments.
Required new achievement reporting
in all 50 states helps parents pinpoint fail
ing schools and choose the best school for
their children. Unlike regular schools,
moreover, schools of choice that fail to at
tract parents must close, which leaves the
successful schools of choice to prosper and
further enlarge opportunities.
In geographic areas with larger num
bers of schools of choice, regular public
schools achieve more, have higher gradu
ation rates and cost less than regular
schools in other similar areas with little
choice. The positive effects of competition
are also notable in metropolitan and urban
areas containing multiple school districts
that consistently outperform areas with a
single monopolistic school districts such as
Los Angeles and New York City. The poor
performance of public schools, particular
ly in such large districts, is attributable to
unwieldy and wasteful central bureacra
cies that are inherently less sensitive to
parent concerns and preferences.

School choice is also effective among
special-needs students with physical and
mental problems such as those in Florida's
McKay Scholarship program. More than
90 percent of parents of McKay children
were satisfied with their chosen schools, far
more than other parents of other special
needs students in nonchosen schools. De
pending on their own preferences, McKay
parents can choose between schools that
focus on a particular disability or schools
that integrate children with and without
disabilities. Parent surveys also show that
McKay students suffer far less harassment
and physical attacks than their peers at
tending nonchosen public schools.
Massively increased choice and re
sulting competition improve schooling
correspondingly. In contrast to the rela
tively small scale of present U.S. choice
programs, Sweden, perhaps surprising
ly, provides an excellent example. In
1993, the Swedish government required
that all school districts fund schools of
choice at a per-student rate of 85 percent
of the per-student cost of regular public
schools. Tuition charges were eliminat
ed, new educational standards estab
lished and an open admission policy ac
cepted students of varying ability, ethnic
ity, and socioeconomic level. Sweden's
nationwide choice program was a rous
ing success in terms of achievement and
parental satisfaction.
Parents have the incentives and infor
mation to choose schools for their children
just as they choose their names, food and
physicians. There seem to be no good rea
sons why they cannot and should not
choose their children's schools.
