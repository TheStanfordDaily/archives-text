## Surprises in this year's AL: Zero 
### 
This week's AL Roundup draws primar
ily on the year's most depressing de
velopment — the first-place New York
Yankees.
The most common theme of every baseball sea
son for the last five or six years has been dethron
ing the Yankees. The Bombers go into every spring
as the Series favorite, and this year has been no dif
ferent, particularly in the American League, where
no true challenger has emerged.
The AL Central has produced its typical midsea
son outcome; the Twins and White Sox are battling
fiercely to earn the honor of being eliminated in the
first round of the playoffs. Despite analysts continu
ally hyping the Central as the AL's most "underrat
ed" division due to its abundance of small-market

(read: bad) teams, the division
winner will likely cruise to a
title with around 85 wins and
be crushed by the Yankees in
the first round.
This is, of course, a matchup
built on two assumptions. The
first is that the Western divi
sion champion will finish with
a better record than their Cen
tral counterpart. The second
is the assumption that the
March darling Red Sox can
hang onto their razor-thin

wild card lead, which seems increasingly unlikely
as long as their infield continues to play defense
like drunken amputees.
Furthermore, let's not even begin to discuss the
ramifications if Randy Johnson ends up in Anaheim
or New York, which in either case will almost cer
tainly result in much gnashing of teeth in Boston.
Johnson has now all but turned down the Angels
after their losses this week in Texas, saying that he
only wants to play for a team that can make the
World Series. Apparently, this can be directly trans
lated to"the Yankees." Adding Johnson to New
York's already-stacked rotation would crush the
Red Sox' slim hopes of winning the East and would
ensure a massive mound advantage in the playoffs,
even against the traditionally stacked A's.
Out West, meanwhile, the Rangers continue to
raise eyebrows, having amassed the second-best
record in the AL after losing the premier player in
baseball. The A's and Angels are hanging tough, de
spite the fact that Anaheim is slipping and threaten
ing to take down the longtime champion Orioles in
the race for "Most Disappointing Team After a Mas
sive Salary Increase." Texas must be starting to
sweat with Oakland entering August, a month in
which it has utterly dominated the competition in
the past few years.
The West, ultimately, will go to the A's. Late-sea
son moves are now becoming critical, and in a
matchup of GMs, pitting Oakland's Billy Beane
against Texas' John Hart is like a cage match be
tween a chainsaw-wielding gorilla on a motorcycle
and Helen Keller. Also, it has been proven by physi
cists that it is impossible to win a division with a
starting rotation that includes Joaquin Benoit and
R.A. Dickey.

But let's be honest with our
selves. As ESPN has taught us,
there are only two teams that
matter in professional baseball
— the Yankees and Red Sox.
Shockingly, as this week's
cathartic brawl confirmed,
these teams have some kind of
dislike towards each other. 1
cannot tell you how good it felt
to see the Red Sox' frustra
tions explode into physical vi
olence. Sox catcher Jason
Varitek taking on A-Rod at the
plate had definite Rocky IV
implications. All the important
elements were there — the
bleached-tipped slave to the
gigantic evil empire, the cult
of personality, the stocky yet
gritty Everyman who fearless
ly chops down an untouchable
opponent. The only way it
could have been more appro
priate would have been if A-
Rod punched out his coach

during the fight, at which
point 1 would have soiled the
couch with joy.
Another thing that got lost in
the shuffle was Yankees starter
Tanyon Sturtze grabbing Gabe
Kapler from behind and doing
everything but breaking a
inetal folding chair over his
head. (The Yankees are, as I
have said before, a classy orga
nization.) Kapler was ejected
for retaliating, yet Sturtze, who
later said, "I was just trying to
pull someone off the pile,"
went unpunished.
It has long been said that
lights are always good for the
struggling team that appears to
be underperforming. That def
inition fits the Sox in July to a
T, and it is yet to be seen
whether Boston, Oakland or
Texas can break the Yankees'
torrid 6-of-8 stretch as the AL
Series representative.
One can only hope.
