## Surprises in this year's AL: Zero 
### 
This week's AL Roundup draws primar
ily on the year's most depressing de
velopment â€” the first-place New York
Yankees.
The most common theme of every baseball sea
son for the last five or six years has been dethron
ing the Yankees. The Bombers go into every spring
as the Series favorite, and this year has been no dif
ferent, particularly in the American League, where
no true challenger has emerged.
The AL Central has produced its typical midsea
son outcome; the Twins and White Sox are battling
fiercely to earn the honor of being eliminated in the
first round of the playoffs. Despite analysts continu
ally hyping the Central as the AL's most "underrat
ed" division due to its abundance of small-market

(read: bad) teams, the division
winner will likely cruise to a
title with around 85 wins and
be crushed by the Yankees in
the first round.
This is, of course, a matchup
built on two assumptions. The
first is that the Western divi
sion champion will finish with
a better record than their Cen
tral counterpart. The second
is the assumption that the
March darling Red Sox can
hang onto their razor-thin

wild card lead, which seems increasingly unlikely
as long as their infield continues to play defense
like drunken amputees.
Furthermore, let's not even begin to discuss the
ramifications if Randy Johnson ends up in Anaheim
or New York, which in either case will almost cer
tainly result in much gnashing of teeth in Boston.
Johnson has now all but turned down the Angels
after their losses this week in Texas, saying that he
only wants to play for a team that can make the
World Series. Apparently, this can be directly trans
lated to"the Yankees." Adding Johnson to New
York's already-stacked rotation would crush the
Red Sox' slim hopes of winning the East and would
ensure a massive mound advantage in the playoffs,
even against the traditionally stacked A's.
Out West, meanwhile, the Rangers continue to
raise eyebrows, having amassed the second-best
record in the AL after losing the premier player in
baseball. The A's and Angels are hanging tough, de
spite the fact that Anaheim is slipping and threaten
ing to take down the longtime champion Orioles in
the race for "Most Disappointing Team After a Mas
sive Salary Increase." Texas must be starting to
sweat with Oakland entering August, a month in
which it has utterly dominated the competition in
the past few years.
The West, ultimately, will go to the A's. Late-sea
son moves are now becoming critical, and in a
matchup of GMs, pitting Oakland's Billy Beane
against Texas' John Hart is like a cage match be
tween a chainsaw-wielding gorilla on a motorcycle
and Helen Keller. Also, it has been proven by physi
cists that it is impossible to win a division with a
starting rotation that includes Joaquin Benoit and
R.A. Dickey.
