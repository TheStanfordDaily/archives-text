### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The 2004 Reebok Rocky Mountain
Revue reunited three former Cardi
nal teammates, but for Casey Jacob
sen, Curtis Borchardt and Josh Chil
dress, the annual NBA summer
league in Salt Lake City, Utah, that
wrapped up last weekend was not just
time to catch up with old friends.
Jacobsen, drafted 22nd overall by the
Phoenix Suns in 2002 after his junior
season on the Farm, was looking to con
tinue the shooting that made him the
NBA's ninth-deadliest shooter from
outside last season, and earn playing
time on a suddenly talented Suns team.
Borchardt, the injury-plagued
18th pick of the same draft, was sim
ply hoping to avoid another date with
the orthopedic surgeon.
And Childress, the latest and most
talented Cardinal to forego his senior
season, was making his first appear
ance as a member of the Atlanta
Hawks, amid the lofty expectations
that come with being the sixth overall
pick of the 2004 draft.
All three players should have
left satisfied.
Borchardt's strong play finally
stood out as his 7-foot frame always
does. He averaged 9.5 points, 8.7 re
bounds and 2.5 blocked shots in six
games. Most importantly, the man
limited to 16 games during his first

two professional seasons due to
injury averaged over 36 min
utes per game. His perfor
mance earned him a spot on the
All-Reebok Rocky Mountain
Revue Team, along with the
Chicago Bulls' first-round selec
tion Luol Deng among others.
Deng led the Bulls to a league
best 6-1 mark while averaging
15.4 points per game. Former
UCLA guard and current Char
lotte Bobcat Jason Kapono was
named MVP, averaging 16.1
points and 2.7 rebounds per
game while leading the expan
sion Bobcats to a 5-2 record.
Borchardt, whose soft touch
and ability to shoot the mid
range jumper has team officials
raving, will look to win the start
ing center job when training
camp opens on Sept. 30. He will
be competing for minutes with
free agent signee Mehmet Okur,
formerly of the defending cham
pion Detroit Pistons, and a famil
iar face, Jarron Collins.
Foot injuries hindered Bor-

chardt while at Stanford, which likely
scared away at least a few teams on
draft day. He missed his entire rookie
season after a stress fracture in the
navicular bone in his right foot re
quired pin replacement surgery. The
injury bug struck again at the start of
last season, as Borchardt sat out

Utah's final seven preseason games
and the first five regular season
games after suffering a broken left
index finger during practice.
He made his long-awaited NBA
debut on Nov. 8 of last year and would
