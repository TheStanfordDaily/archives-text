### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
With help from senior Ogonna Nna
mani and Logan Tom, Class of'o2, the
U.S. women's volleyball team has se
cured a spot in the championship round
of competition in the annual World
Grand Prix — the last serious volleyball
tournament before the Olympic Games.
After three weeks of play, Team USA
has a 6-3 record and is ranked fourth out
of 12 teams, 10 of which will be compet
ing next month in Athens. Last week
end, America edged out Russia (4-5) and
Ihailand (1-8), but faced a narrow loss
against sixth-ranked Germany (5-4).
1 om dominated the game against
Russia, scoring a match-high 20
points on top of 17 kills, two blocks,
and one service ace to lead Team USA
to a 25-13, 21-25, 25-21, 25-15 victo
ry. 1 he win over Russia secured
America's spot in the championship
round with two games yet to go in the

preliminary round.
The match against llth-ranked
Thailand should have been breeze -
Team USA had beaten Thailand twice
already in the tournament. I he match
looked all but wrapped up after Amer
ica soundly took the first two sets 25-
17, 25-20, but Thailand did not go eas
ily. The team put up a fight to take the
next two sets 22-25, 22-25. I earn ISA
took control in the fifth set, however,
winning the set and its third-straight
match 15-5.
Outside-hitters Tom and Nnamani
— who led Stanford to a national
championship in 2001 —did their
part against Thailand, respectively
scoring 15 and 13 points to make them
the second and third top scorers foi
Team USA in the match. Tayyiba Ha
neefof Laguna Hills, Calif., was I SA s
top scorer with 16 points.

rently the tournament's top scor
er with 145 points in addition to
120 kills, 15 blocks, and 10 ser
vice aces.
Haneef and Tom were also the
top two scorers in the match
against Germany, but their respec
tive 17 and 13 points were not

enough to stop Germany and their
21-point-scorer Angelina Grun
from winning the close match 25-
23,21-25, 16-25,25-17, 15-12.
Team USA may have another
shot at Germany in the champi
onship round of the Grand Prix
and if not then, the two teams will
certainly meet again in Athens —
they will be in the same prelimi
nary pool along with Russia,
China and Cuba come Aug. 14
when Olympic play begins.
The championship round of the
Grand Prix opened up yesterday

in Reggio Calabria, Italy. Team
USA is in Pool A, facing fifth
ranked Italy (6-3) and third
ranked China (7-2). Tom and Nna
mani led Team USA to victory over
Italy two weeks ago in the prelimi
naries as the first- and third-top
scorers. But Team USA fell to
China in five sets the week before.
The top two teams in Pool A will
advance to the semifinals on July
31 to face the top two teams in Pool
B which includes top-ranked
Brazil (9-0), second-ranked Cuba
(8-1), and sixth ranked Germany

(5-4). The gold and bronze-medal
games will be played Aug. 1.
As Nnamani and Tom charge
ahead with Team USA, former
teammate Kerri Walsh, Class of
'00, is preparing to take gold in
Athens in a slightly different
sport. After competing on Team
USA's fourth-place indoor volley
ball team in Sydney, the former
Cardinal standout partnered up
with Misty May of Newport
Beach California, adjusted her
playing style and moved from the
hard court to the sand.

Now Walsh and May are
ranked first out of the 24 women's
teams competing in Athens. Their
first place seeding, announced
last week by the Federation Inter
nationale de Volleyball (FVIB), is
based on their performance in
the top eight international events
from Jan. 1 of last year through
July 11, 2004. The announce
ment of the top ranking did not
come as a surprise — Walsh and
May are favored to win Olympic
gold and they both have their
eyes on the prize.

Haneef and Tom were also the
top two scorers in the match
against Germany, but their respec
tive 17 and 13 points were not

enough to stop Germany and their
21-point-scorer Angelina Grun
from winning the close match 25-
23,21-25, 16-25,25-17, 15-12.
Team USA may have another
shot at Germany in the champi
onship round of the Grand Prix
and if not then, the two teams will
certainly meet again in Athens —
they will be in the same prelimi
nary pool along with Russia,
China and Cuba come Aug. 14
when Olympic play begins.
The championship round of the
Grand Prix opened up yesterday

in Reggio Calabria, Italy. Team
USA is in Pool A, facing fifth
ranked Italy (6-3) and third
ranked China (7-2). Tom and Nna
mani led Team USA to victory over
Italy two weeks ago in the prelimi
naries as the first- and third-top
scorers. But Team USA fell to
China in five sets the week before.
The top two teams in Pool A will
advance to the semifinals on July
31 to face the top two teams in Pool
B which includes top-ranked
Brazil (9-0), second-ranked Cuba
(8-1), and sixth ranked Germany

(5-4). The gold and bronze-medal
games will be played Aug. 1.
As Nnamani and Tom charge
ahead with Team USA, former
teammate Kerri Walsh, Class of
'00, is preparing to take gold in
Athens in a slightly different
sport. After competing on Team
USA's fourth-place indoor volley
ball team in Sydney, the former
Cardinal standout partnered up
with Misty May of Newport
Beach California, adjusted her
playing style and moved from the
hard court to the sand.

Now Walsh and May are
ranked first out of the 24 women's
teams competing in Athens. Their
first place seeding, announced
last week by the Federation Inter
nationale de Volleyball (FVIB), is
based on their performance in
the top eight international events
from Jan. 1 of last year through
July 11, 2004. The announce
ment of the top ranking did not
come as a surprise — Walsh and
May are favored to win Olympic
gold and they both have their
eyes on the prize.
