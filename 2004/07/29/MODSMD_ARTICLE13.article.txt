# Gilmore, Minaker thrive in summer baseball matchups
## 
### 
It's tough to believe that soon-to-be junior JefT
Gilmore threw a whopping 2 1/3 innings with
out a decision in his freshman year. After break
ing out during the 2004 season as a reliable
starter — he compiled a 9-2 record — the
righthander isn't slowing a bit.
Gilmore is currently taking the mound for the
Mat-Su Miners in the Alaska Baseball League
and has put together a 2-1 record with a tidy lit
tle 0.90 ERA. And despite not being a power
pitcher like his strikeout-prone Stanford team
mate Mark Romanczuk, Gilmore has racked up
29 K's in his past 20 innings of work.
Maybe it's something in the Alaska air, but the
league has been home to strong summer perfor
mances from two other Cardinal players —
righthanded reliever Matt Manship and back
stop John Hester, both rising juniors.
Manship has putin 27 2/3 innings for the
Miners with a 2.60 ERA, while Hester is batting
.256 with 14 RBI and 21 runs scored (the second
most on the squad).
Rising junior Chris Minaker has the highest
batting average of any Stanford player at the mo
ment (.324) while ranking second on his team in
doubles (7) and driving in 18 runs thus far. Class

mate Ben Summerhays, who was drafted this
year by the Seattle Mariners but declined to sign,
is hitting at a .300 clip. No other Stanford player
is batting above the .300 mark.
Almost-junior Pete Duda lays claim to the
most innings pitched of any Cardinal player,
having thrown 44 frames with one complete
game an a 3.27 ERA.
Rising sophomore Jim Rapoport has been
struggling a bit with the bat in the Cape Cod
League, but the outfielder has managed to tear
up the basepaths for a total of 10 stolen bases in
34 games played.
On the international stage, rising junior John
Mayberry, Jr. is hitting a solid .268 for Team
USA, while classmate Jed Lowrie (who has start
ed a team-leading 18 contests) has dropped to a
.230 average despite having 13 RBI and a .410
slugging percentage. Lefthander Mark Ro
manczuk is 2-1 with a 5.23 ERA in 10 1 / 3 in
nings on the mound.
The national team is 14-7 and currently enjoys
a four-game winnings streak. The squad will be
competing in a tournament in Taiwan this week.
