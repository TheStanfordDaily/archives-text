## Fox News gets a dose of its own medicine in 'Outfoxed' 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN INTERMISSION WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT 
Fox News is second only to the Bush administration
in provoking liberals' ire. Their looseness with the truth
is well-documented bv watchdogs like Media Matters for
.America, and any cogent viewer knows that when Bill
O'Reilly promises to "talk straight" about the Iraq war or
tax cuts, his talk is about as straight as a drunkard's walk.
But since Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/ 11" recently
cemented the documentary genre firmly in the realm of

libera] troublemakers, it was only
a matter of a time before some as
piring knight-on-noble-steed
filmmaker threw the crimes of
Rupert Murdoch 8c Co. in our
collective faces.
The Moore-aspirant in ques
tion here is Robert Greenwald,
director of the new straight-to-
DVD release, "Outfoxed: Ru
pert Murdoch's War on Journal
ism." The documentary uses tes
timony from former Fox em
ployees, media experts and in
ternal Fox News memos to give
us a glimpse of the nefarious Fox
News underworld, where execu
tives and Republican propagan
dists force reporters to tip the
scales rightward in their "fair
and balanced" reports.

Any good documentary does at least one of two
things. The first is to unveil new information about a fa
miliar topic. Errol Morris' brilliant "Fog of War" gave us
Robert McNamara's insight on the Vietnam debacle,
and Moore's "9 /11" was engaging because it highlight
ed images the citizenry doesn't usually get to see (like
civilian deaths in Iraq and, less tragically, Paul Wol
fowitz's ickv hair-care technique).

Other filmmakers use the documentary format to tell
a story. The artistry involved here is more subtle and dif
ficult, but, when done right, the result can be a tale as
gripping as any Bruckheimer explosions fantasy. (See
"Capturing the Friedmans" or "Dig!" for examples.)
"Outfoxed" tries to squeeze its lithe frame into the
first box, but it sits there uncomfortably. Greenwald
starts by parading a half-dozen low-level former Fox em
ployees to sketch out his initial, thinly supported asser
tions. Some big names, like Walter Cronkite and David
Brock, pop their heads into supply generalized sound

bites about Fox's prevarications.
The film is at its best when it narrows
down into specificity. One former Fox
News reporter tells lis about his cover
age of Ronald Reagan's birthday; Fox
managers wanted footage of the adula
tory revelry going on at the ex-Presi
dent's library, but no such bacchanalia
existed. The diligent reporter settled
for footage of the day's only visitors, an
elementary sch(X)l class.
Greenwald also uses direct Fox
footage, including O'Reilly's bullying
attack on Jeremy Glick, whose father
died in the World Trade Center. Most
viewers probably never saw the original
broadcast (What, me? Watch Fox
News? Never), so O'Reilly's blustering,
insensitive attacks on the New York
twentysomething are newly infuriat
ing, like salt in a reopened sore. The

footage makes me want to kick O'Reilly in the shins for
the bully that he is.
But if rehashed television footage is the basis of some
of Greenwald's most effective attacks on Fox News,
what's the point of a documentary at all? Maybe, instead,
liberals should just watch an hour-and-a-half of Fox
News at home. It'll get them riled up more than "Out
foxed" will, and for less monev, too.
