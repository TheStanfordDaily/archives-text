# 'Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon'
## 
### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION GAMER 
Some things should never be
given another chance to live. Crys
tal-clear Pepsi, Full House and that
annoying female Ninja Turtle
(Venus deMilo, for you trivia freaks)
are just a few of a list full of things
that would drive me insane if they
came back in any form. Thankfully,
the folks over at Sega know how to
treat nostalgia-hungry gamers
right, and with the release of "Shin
ing Force: Resurrection of the Dark
Dragon," a modern remake of the
classic strategy role-playing game of
the early '90s, a whole new genera
tion of game players now have a
chance to play one of the classics.
Back in the day, "Shining Force"
was a premier game tide, propelling

Sega to the top with a great series that
could compete with other RPG giants
like Final Fantasy. Unfortunately, the
series only spawned one sequel on
the Sega Genesis, and it would be
many years before another true se
quel would be created. Regardless,
"Shining Force" set the tone for many
similar games to come.
The story is your typical cliched
mysterious-yet-strong-hero-gath
ers-forces-and-saves-world-from-
evil-diabolical-monster type (re
member, this was one of the games
that started that cliche). There are a
few changes to the story in this title,
such as the origin of the hero and
villain, and the inclusion of a whole
new sub-story starring the well
mannered princess of the evil king
that you're fighting against. Some of
the changes are for the better (the

princess plot adds quite a bit of
gameplay), but some of the others I
feel are just quick fixes to try and ap
peal to a new generation of gamers.
Gameplay is pretty simple in
"Shining Force". You control a
group of heroes on a giant battle
field. Players take turns moving all
their characters across the field
while the CPU does the same for the
villains. When a character gets in
range, you can attack via swords,
bows, magic and other forms of de
liciously destructive mayhem. If you
can accomplish the objective (usual
ly killing every one on the opposing
team) before your main hero is de
stroyed, you win and move on to the
next battle.
To spice up the game a litde, the
developers have added a few new
features to the game. For starters,
each battle has a time attack bonus
where if you win the battle in a cer
tain amount of turns you win a c<x>l
item or money. Also, Sega has added
several new characters (hidden or
otherwise) that can be acquired to
aid you on your quest. There are also
a few menu fixes, as well as graphiad
and sound upgrades.
Some gamers may not be able to
appreciate "Shining Force", since
even with the remake addictions, it
pales graphically (and story wise)
to the newer titles. However, for
those l(x>king to play a decent
game that brought the turn based
tactics RPG genre to the forefront
of gaming, then look no further
than this gem. This is one classic
you won't mind seeing brought
back from the dead.
