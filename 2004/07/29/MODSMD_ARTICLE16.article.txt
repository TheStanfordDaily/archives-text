# Damon's new Bourne flick reigns 'supreme'; sequel is even better than original film
## 
### SCOTT HOWARD INTERMISSION ONLINE FILM CRITIC 
The rule used to l)e simple: Se
quels are awful. They existed only
to make money and were, at best,
hollow and brazen repeats of the
movies that we already p;ud to see
("Jurassic Park: The Lost World,"
the entire "Lethal Weapon" canon)
or, at worst, drastic reinventions of
the series that changed / ruined
everything ("Highlander 2,"
"2010: The Year We Make Con
tact"). There was little evidence —
"The Godfather II," "Superman
11Terminator 2" — to prove oth
erwise. But, inexplicably, a new
rule has been enacted: Sequels
must be thousands of times better
than the original movie. Is there
anyone who could, with rational
mind, argue that "X-Men 2" and
"Spiderman 2" are pale imitations
of their predecessors?
"The Bourne Supremacy," a se
quel to the 2002 Matt Damon spy
movie "The Bourne Identity",
continues this trend by topping the
original in every conceivable way.
"Identity" was one of those movies
that was just kind 0f... there. It
wasn't bad, but I didn't remember
a thing about it once the credits
started to roll. The director, Doug
Liman ("Go," "Swingers"), report
edly encountered trouble from the
studio when his cut was deemed
too arty to succeed as a summer
blockbuster.
I was perplexed, then, that
Paul Greengrass signed up to
direct "Supremacy". Liman's
"Go" wasn't "Rambo," but it was
full of the excitement and ener
gy of modern action films. How
ever, Greengrass' claim to fame,
the brutal and magnificent
"Bloody Sunday," was one of the
most politically divisive and un
commercial films I've ever seen;
scowling indictments of British
imperialism filmed with graphi
cally violent accuracy aren't usu
ally big hits with corporate Hol
lywood types.
But what I thought might be
an attempt at selling out in
stead becomes a reaffirmation
of everything that's good
about big budget filmmaking.
For example (and I know this
may sound unbelievable given
that every action movie made
these days is more "techno
thriller" than "action movie"),
I don't think a single comput

er was used in any of the spe
cial effects here. I don't mean
that literally; I'm sure comput
ers were probably used some
where, but I couldn't tell, and
I can always tell. I couldn't tell
because Greengrass wants us
to believe that this is all really
happening, and he wants us to
believe this because he realizes
that the only way he can excite
his audience is if they forget
that Matt Damon's not going
to die.
I've seen a lot of movies in
my life, and I'm smart enough
to know that a marquee star
isn't going to be killed off in
the second installment of a
franchise that's just getting
started. But that simple fact
didn't enter my mind for a sin
gle second while I was watch
ing this movie because Green
grass is such a brilliant direc
tor. Our suspension of disbe
lief is stretched so hilariously
far with most recent movies
that it's usually hard to distin
guish what's supposed to be
fantasy from what's supposed
to be realitv. Not so here. From
the second the title hits the
screen, he begins with razor
sharp editing, handheld camera
work and extreme zooms remi
niscent of guerilla documen
taries from thirty years ago. But
this isn't just some whiz kid co
opting the rawness of an era he
probably didn't even live
through; he does it to confuse
and disorient us to the point
that we feel like we're actually in
the movie. 1 have rather droopy
eyes but during the last hour they
were opened so wide that I
looked like I was on an endless
speed / mescaline / peyote binge.
I felt real suspense, and a lot of it.
That's rare.
Though I hope his days of
difficult art films aren't be
hind him, I can't remember
the last time an indie film
maker was able take up the
reins of a big budget studio
film so skillfully. I have been
surprised by the quality of
quite a few mainstream films
over the past year or so, so
perhaps the studios have de
cided that if they're going to
spend $150 million on a
movie, it would probably be
best if it's something they can
actually sit through.
