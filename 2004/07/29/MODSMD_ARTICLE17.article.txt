In the past 50 years, the global population has in
creased by nearly four billion people according to the
I .S. Census Bureau, and yet the world's non-renew
able resources are dwindling at an astonishing rate. For
tunately, some are looking lor solutions, and on 1 hurs
day.July 28, Stanford will host the "Planet-X" sympo
sium, which will focus on "technology innovations to
ward a sustainable environment." The event is put on
by the Stanford Institute for the Environment, the
School of Engineering and the School of Earth Sciences.
"We are pulling together leaders in industry , govern
ment, non-government and academia to discuss chal
lenges in the environment and to see how we can part
ner together to tackle some of these challenges," said Bill
Layton, School of Engineering associate director.
I he symposium will consist of two main parts, the
iirst of which focuses on climate and energy systems,
and the second of which centers on water systems. Both
sections will discuss global business challenges: I he cli
mate and energy systems section will concentrate on re
newable energy sources, advanced transportation sys
tems and climate policy; the water systems section of
the conference will center on water quality control,
water conservation and advanced water technology
such as membrane bioreactor technology.
In addition to looking toward means of a sus
tainable environment, the Planet-X symposium will
face the problem of incorporating this technology
into the complex ecosystems of the planet Earth.

"We have two large challenges before us in the 21st
century," said Richard G. Luthy, the Silas H. Palmer IYo
fessor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and fac
ulty adviser for the event, according to Hie Stanford Re
port. "(They are] how to provide the basic needs for soci
ety to function — in terms of food, water, energy, shelter
and clean air — and how we do that in a way that pre
serves the basic cycles on Earth on which all life depends."
Speakers for the event range from keynote speaker
Warren Staley, who is die chairman and CEO ofCargill,
to panelist Ralph Cavanagh, who is the director of the
Energy Program of die Natural Resources Defense
Council as well as a graduate from Yale College and Yale
Law School. Odier speakers include guest Rachel Kyte,
who directs the Environmental and Social Development
Department at die International Finance Corporation,
Associate Prof, of Environmental Engineering and Sci
ence Craig Criddle and Prof, of Economics H.
Goulder. The two panelist monitors are Pamela Matson,
who is a Chester Naramore Dean of die School of Earth
Sciences at Stanford, and Richard Ludiy. In total, there
are 17 speakers, 10 of whom are Stanford faculty mem
bers, five of whom are in industry and two of whom are
involved in independent environmental agencies.
"[The speakers] were selected because of their
knowledge in the areas we were trying to address,"
Layton said, emphasizing that the Planet-X staff
chose speakers from a wide variety of areas "to get
different perspectives on the topics.'
The symposium is intended for corporation employ
ees as well as those affiliated with the Stanford Engineer
ing Department, Stanford faculty and invited guests.
