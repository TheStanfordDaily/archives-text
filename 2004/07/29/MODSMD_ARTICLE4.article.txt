## Chronicle editor on leave for political contributions 
### SARAH RIZK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After the San Francisco Chronicle discovered that
its letters editor William Pates had contributed a total
of almost $ 1,000 to political campaigns, he was placed
on paid leave while the paper has now started an in
vestigation into the incident. Pates' most recent con
tributions included two $200 donations to the John
Kerry campaign, according to the Center for Re
sponsive Politics.
Pates' superiors expressed worry that political
action on the part of staff members would compro
mise the Chronicle's credibility, protected by the
Chronicle's Conflict of Interest policy that Pates' al
legedly violated when he made his contributions.
The Conflict of Interest policy states, "The Chron
icle does not forbid employees from engaging in po
litical activities but needs to prevent any appearance
of any conflict of interest. Political involvement could
include campaign contributions, volunteer activities,
public endorsements, displaying bumper stickers or
posters, banners and the like."
It further stipulates that if there are any ques
tions as to whether the political activity would po
tentially appear as a conflict of interest, "Staff
members should consult with the executive editor
or his designee."
Pates did not take this step. Instead, the Chron
icle did not discover the alleged violation until
Stanford's journalistic media research project,
Grade the News, called Pates to confront him about
his political contributions. Rather than returning
the phone call, Pates forwarded the message to ed
itorial page editor John Diaz, who temporarily re

lieved Pates of his duties.
Because Pates worked in the opinions section of
the paper, there are some questions as to how thor
oughly such a section's personnel should he ex
pected to adhere to the Conflict of Interest policy.
However, Diaz believes that affiliation with a cer
tain political group creates the impression that the
writers are not thinking independently.
"Even though we on the editorial page have opin
ions, we think we are subject to the same standards as
every other journalist," Diaz said, according to Grade
the News. "Maybe it's not objectivity we're aiming for
here, but independence. You can't do that if you're
giving political contributions."
As well as contributing to the Kerry campaign,
Pates allegedly contributed $150 to Aaron Peskin
when he ran for San Francisco supervisor in 2000,
$100 to Democrat Harry Britt when he ran for As
sembly in 2001, and $300 to Kamala Harris when
she ran for district attorney.
In addition to Pates, the Chronicle is investigating
four other staff members, according to Grade the
News. These include former tech writer Henry
Norr, who allegedly contributed $ 1,000 to the Green
Party of California; former columnist Ruth Rosen,
who allegedly contributed $450 to the campaign for
Democrat Loni Hancock when she ran for Assembly;
librarian Kathleen Rhodes who allegedly con
tributed $200 to oppose the ban on gay marriages
proposed by Proposition 22; and page designer
Abby Zimberg, who allegedly contributed $100 to
Susan Leal when she ran for mayor last year.
For further information, Grade the News has post
ed on the Web an extensive list of journalists in the Bay
Area who have contributed to political campaigns.
