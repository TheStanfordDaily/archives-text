# Temp worker advocates cite labor 'misuse' by Palo Alto
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
Temporary workers in Palo Alto demanding a
way to join the city's workers' union are receiving
support from groups and students at Stanford as
well as the surrounding areas.
The petition, created by the City of Palo Alto
Hourly Organizing Committee, stresses that
the right "to organize a union free of interfer
ence, intimidator and restraints is well estab
lished". The online petition asks for the city's
commitment and the recognition of the rights
to organize.
"The city has been misusing workers for many
years," said Service Employees International
Union, Local 715 representative Creg Pullman.
The workers have been working "day in and out,
week in and out, the same schedule" for many
years, without benefits.
If enough signatures are collected, tempo
rary workers could soon be a part of SEIU, Local
715, the same union representing 600 full-time

city workers.
"The feeling is very positive and hopeful that we
call all unionize," said Kristin Rasinussen, who has
been working at the Children's Library for three
and half years.
Officially called the Our Community Supports
Palo Alto Hourly Workers, the petition asks for
Stanford students and Palo Alto residents to sign
in a show of support for local workers. Because
the city only employs these workers temporarily,
workers do not receive benefits, similar to the sit
uation faced by many Stanford temporary work
ers. United Stanford Workers is a part of Local
715. In the fall of last year, the school and its
workers settled on a contract, which created per
manent positions for some temporary workers.
Two campus groups, each of which try to edu
cate the Stanford community on labor issues, Stu
dent Labor Action Coalition (SLAC) and MKChA,
have already voiced their opinion and continue to
ask for the support of others by spreading word of
the petition. The petition cur
rently lists 61 signatures.
"TTie community has been e
mailing in their support," Pullman
said. "They hate to see injustice
happening in the city of Palo Alto."
There are an estimated 300 cur
rent temporary workers, many of
which have worked under the same
interim tide for two decades. The
Palo Alto Weekly states that at least
50 percent of these workers must
sign in favor of a union to become
an "official bargaining union".
An April report by City Auditor
Sharon Erickson stated that 21
percent of current temporary
workers exceed the 1,000 work
hour per year maximum that de
fines a temporary worker. Most of
the jobs filled by these workers fall
under community services, such as
librarians, custodians and recre
ation leaders, and they pay $7 to
$26, according to the report. Palo
Alto does not currently offer full
time employment to temporary
workers. As a result, many of the
workers it trains leave to find work

in other cities.
Comprised of temporary
workers, the Hourly Organizing
committee first declared its intent
to start a campaign to the city in
early July.
Written by one of SEIU's orga
nizers, Seth Newton, the petition
places pressure on the city's role in
bringing about the unionization,
stressing that the process "affords
the City of Palo Alto a unique op
portunity to demonstrate its com
mitment not only to its employees
but also to its residents and the
larger community".
According to a draft of the
agenda for the next City Council
meeting, Palo Alto plans to discuss
an SEIU contract on Aug. 2. Earli
er this year Local 715 threatened
to strike but the work stoppage was
avoided when a new contract was
completed in June. Its grievances
for the threat included, among
other charges, the overuse of tem
porary employees.
As to where the attempt to form
a bargaining union is heading,
Pullman believes it is going in a
positive direction thanks to the
support of workers.
"It's just a matter of time be
cause of all the support we've been
receiving."
