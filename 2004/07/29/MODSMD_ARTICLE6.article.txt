# Budget woes cause lay-offs, closure of Web services group
## 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
Media Solutions, a full-ser
vice production group provid
ing Web services to Stanford,
cites financial reasons for its
closure at the end of this fiscal
year. On Aug. 31, the design
and consultation group operat
ed by Stanford University Li
braries and Academic Informa
tion Resources (SULAIR) will
close its services after four years
of work for the University.
Based entirely on financial
considerations, Media Solu
tions will no longer provide
Web, video and broadcast ser
vices for Stanford. Upon its in
ception in 2000, one of the
group's goals was to generate
revenue. Even following re
structuring in 2001, when eight
workers were laid off, Media
Solutions has been unable to
cover its operating costs.
"Based both on our own expe
rience and that of other universi
ties, it is clear that an organization
like ours cannot survive without
being subsidized by the Universi
ty, and that funding isn't avail
able," Director Wynn Hausser
explained in a press release.
Stanford budget cuts were
among the reasons cited for
Media Solutions' closure. Hauss
er claimed that University facul
tv was alreadv stretched thin

with other duties to have suffi
cient capacity for oversight and
management of Web projects.
"It's a financial model and a
business model that doesn't work
on campus without being fund
ed," added Judith Blankman,
Producer for Media Solutions.
Along with work on over 230
projects for 85 Stanford-relat
ed departments from Stanford
Libraries, to Wallenberg Hall
to Financial Systems online
classroom, Media Solutions
also provided application de
velopment and staff training.
The group, committed to work
for the University community
and non-profit organizations,
was a self-proclaimed advocate
of client collaboration.
Media Solutions has been a
proud provider of services for
the Stanford campus and in
tends on completing all of its
current projects up to its closing
in late August. Six workers will
be laid off, many of whom have
already found work elsewhere
in the Stanford community.
Hausser has already received
another position with SULAIR.
"I'm going to miss being here
at Stanford and doing this
work," Blankman said.
"[Media Solutions] made a
great contribution to Stanford,
and it's a shame we weren't able
to survive in the University fi
nancial climate."
