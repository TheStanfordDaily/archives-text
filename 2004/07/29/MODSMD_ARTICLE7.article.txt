## HOLT'S HARANGUE So, how about Kerry's veep? 
### 
m w he selection of the vice-presidential
candidate is always a carefully
planned, critical move. The vice-
JL president will hopefully till in
weaknesses on any party's ticket. The office
of the vice president is an important job, and
so it takes careful consideration to decide
who is ready for the crucial tasks of 1) Break
ing a tie in the Senate and 2) Posing in photo
opportunities the president does not deem
essential enough for his own presence.
For the Democrats, John Edwards was se
lected a few weeks ago. Even I'll admit, he's a
really likeable guy. FrankenKerry I'm am
bivalent on, but Edwards is the kind of guy
you'd invite over to dinner. People know
him; people like him. Kerry's strategists were
very astute in their selection, for they are 110
doubt hoping that people will mistake John
Edwards for John Edward, host of the Sci-Fi
Channel show: "Crossing Over with John Ed
ward." Supposed psychic abilities mav turn
into votes with sci-fib fans and very gullible
old people. John Edwards may not have the
super powers of John Edward, but he does
seem wholesome enough. You can almost
picture him as Robin to Kerry's Batman, say
ing things like, "Sweet civil unions, Batman!
The South hates us!" Then Kerry would
touch him on the shoulder lovingly and say,
"Never fear, friend of friends, we can handle
this . . . together."
The Republicans are just as confident
going into November. And with so many
choices for VP, who wouldn't be? There
have been talks of replacing Cheney on the
ticket, thereby rendering thousands of
"Bush/Cheney '04" stickers on pick-up
trucks useless. Cheney, it seems, is not the
smiling Robin-like figure that Edwards is.
He's more of a hug-able stuffed Humpty
Dumpty. Cheney also does not have any in
teresting name similarities — it's hard to be
lieve voters would mistake him for Chew
bacca or Che Guevara. Both of these people
are well liked, but Cheney is not. He boldly
fits the "bad boy" persona, the scrooge of the
Senate, establishing an approval rating
somewhere in the low forties. The only rat
ing lower, it seems, is the 34 percent percent
of Americans who are concerned about his
heart condition. That makes sense, though,
because no one ever worried about the Fonz
kicking the bucket.
Cheney, like a true bad boy, has dis
missed claims that he will be replaced, usual
ly while using colorful language. For argu
ment's sake, let's look at some other possible
Republican vice-presidential candidates.
Any one of them would surely enhance the
Republican ticket.
Take, for instance, Secretary of State
Colin Powell. There were talks as far back as
1995 that Colin Powell would run for presi
dent some day. He's had years of experience
within the party, served on George H.W.
Bush's cabinet as secretary of defense, and is
well respected internationally and has some

cross-party support. As an added bonus, he
briefed the United Nations 011 Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, so like any
good Republican president, he is both fa
miliar with pissing off the international
community and fully ready to ignore intelli
gence briefings.
What would be even better, though,
would be Dr. Condoleezza Rice. As national
security advisor to the president, she got a
lot of face time due to her role in the 9/11
investigation, when she testified before
Congress. For weeks on end, you could see
Condoleezza Rice up there 011 your TV
screen, so she certainly has face recognition
going for her. She also receives honorary
degrees from schools across the country,
served as provost of Stanford and has basi
cally established herself as the smartest per
son in the White House. The Bush Admin
istration using her as the "fall girl" against

Richard Clarke's attacks
did nothing to diminish
her in the public eye.
One would imagine she
would be frustrated with
her boss for putting her
up to that, but Bush's
Halliburton buddies are
making it up to Dr. Rice
by naming an entire fleet
after her.

There is one other
hopeful candidate for the vice presidential
position. Powell may seem like either a
swindler or a moron, and the Republicans
may have tarnished the only black female
Republican in the history of the US, but
don't fear. I have a solution. Dick Cheney
may be a public relations problem. Mary
Cheney, however, would be a goldmine.
Mary Cheney, Dick's lesbian daughter,
would be just perfect to replace her ailing
(both physically and politically) father.
Why? Who else can rally the nation behind
a constitutional amendment banning gay
marriages than a lesbian Republican al
ready working for the re-election cam
paign? She did some behind the scenes
work in the 2000 election, but already is
helping her pops this time around. Think
about it though: The Democrats have got
nothing on Mary Cheney. She's a lesbian,
which trumps even Condoleezza Rice in
terms of rarities in the Republican Party
(i.e. groups who have been historically op
pressed). What can the Democrats do to
respond to that? "Holy strawberries Bat
man! We're going to get creamed!" What
better way for the Republicans to prove
they are not civil-rights-denying-homo
phobes than to select a lesbian vice presi
dential candidate. Personally, I look for
ward to seeing it.

Chris Holt hopes Cheney does stay on the ticket sim
ply so Kerry and Edwards can kick his ass. Send

would be Dr. Condoleezza Rice. As national
security advisor to the president, she got a
lot of face time due to her role in the 9/11
investigation, when she testified before
Congress. For weeks on end, you could see
Condoleezza Rice up there 011 your TV
screen, so she certainly has face recognition
going for her. She also receives honorary
degrees from schools across the country,
served as provost of Stanford and has basi
cally established herself as the smartest per
son in the White House. The Bush Admin
istration using her as the "fall girl" against

Richard Clarke's attacks
did nothing to diminish
her in the public eye.
One would imagine she
would be frustrated with
her boss for putting her
up to that, but Bush's
Halliburton buddies are
making it up to Dr. Rice
by naming an entire fleet
after her.

There is one other
hopeful candidate for the vice presidential
position. Powell may seem like either a
swindler or a moron, and the Republicans
may have tarnished the only black female
Republican in the history of the US, but
don't fear. I have a solution. Dick Cheney
may be a public relations problem. Mary
Cheney, however, would be a goldmine.
Mary Cheney, Dick's lesbian daughter,
would be just perfect to replace her ailing
(both physically and politically) father.
Why? Who else can rally the nation behind
a constitutional amendment banning gay
marriages than a lesbian Republican al
ready working for the re-election cam
paign? She did some behind the scenes
work in the 2000 election, but already is
helping her pops this time around. Think
about it though: The Democrats have got
nothing on Mary Cheney. She's a lesbian,
which trumps even Condoleezza Rice in
terms of rarities in the Republican Party
(i.e. groups who have been historically op
pressed). What can the Democrats do to
respond to that? "Holy strawberries Bat
man! We're going to get creamed!" What
better way for the Republicans to prove
they are not civil-rights-denying-homo
phobes than to select a lesbian vice presi
dential candidate. Personally, I look for
ward to seeing it.

Chris Holt hopes Cheney does stay on the ticket sim
ply so Kerry and Edwards can kick his ass. Send

m w he selection of the vice-presidential
candidate is always a carefully
planned, critical move. The vice-
JL president will hopefully till in
weaknesses on any party's ticket. The office
of the vice president is an important job, and
so it takes careful consideration to decide
who is ready for the crucial tasks of 1) Break
ing a tie in the Senate and 2) Posing in photo
opportunities the president does not deem
essential enough for his own presence.
For the Democrats, John Edwards was se
lected a few weeks ago. Even I'll admit, he's a
really likeable guy. FrankenKerry I'm am
bivalent on, but Edwards is the kind of guy
you'd invite over to dinner. People know
him; people like him. Kerry's strategists were
very astute in their selection, for they are 110
doubt hoping that people will mistake John
Edwards for John Edward, host of the Sci-Fi
Channel show: "Crossing Over with John Ed
ward." Supposed psychic abilities mav turn
into votes with sci-fib fans and very gullible
old people. John Edwards may not have the
super powers of John Edward, but he does
seem wholesome enough. You can almost
picture him as Robin to Kerry's Batman, say
ing things like, "Sweet civil unions, Batman!
The South hates us!" Then Kerry would
touch him on the shoulder lovingly and say,
"Never fear, friend of friends, we can handle
this . . . together."
The Republicans are just as confident
going into November. And with so many
choices for VP, who wouldn't be? There
have been talks of replacing Cheney on the
ticket, thereby rendering thousands of
"Bush/Cheney '04" stickers on pick-up
trucks useless. Cheney, it seems, is not the
smiling Robin-like figure that Edwards is.
He's more of a hug-able stuffed Humpty
Dumpty. Cheney also does not have any in
teresting name similarities — it's hard to be
lieve voters would mistake him for Chew
bacca or Che Guevara. Both of these people
are well liked, but Cheney is not. He boldly
fits the "bad boy" persona, the scrooge of the
Senate, establishing an approval rating
somewhere in the low forties. The only rat
ing lower, it seems, is the 34 percent percent
of Americans who are concerned about his
heart condition. That makes sense, though,
because no one ever worried about the Fonz
kicking the bucket.
Cheney, like a true bad boy, has dis
missed claims that he will be replaced, usual
ly while using colorful language. For argu
ment's sake, let's look at some other possible
Republican vice-presidential candidates.
Any one of them would surely enhance the
Republican ticket.
Take, for instance, Secretary of State
Colin Powell. There were talks as far back as
1995 that Colin Powell would run for presi
dent some day. He's had years of experience
within the party, served on George H.W.
Bush's cabinet as secretary of defense, and is
well respected internationally and has some

cross-party support. As an added bonus, he
briefed the United Nations 011 Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, so like any
good Republican president, he is both fa
miliar with pissing off the international
community and fully ready to ignore intelli
gence briefings.
What would be even better, though,

security advisor to the president, she got a
