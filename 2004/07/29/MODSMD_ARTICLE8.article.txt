## Violence still plagues Guatemala 
### PATRICK MATTIMORE 
Perhaps you've heard about the
group of Bay Area teenagers who
were kidnapped and robbed this past
week on the road from Quetzeltenan
go to Antigua in Guatemala. None of
the students was harmed and they
and the leaders of their project, Seeds
of Learning, determined to press on
to El Salvador where they will be
building a new school. 1 he robbers
escaped with approximately $11,200,
which the group had collected from
donations in the United States.
My family lias been staying in An
tigua where we have a second home.
One of our son's friends, who is stay
ing with us, recognized a girl from
Seeds of Learning with whom he goes
to school. We invited the group of 17
kids and two adults to our house for
cokes, chips and a movie, and learned
all about their harrowing experience.
The teens and adults were upbeat and
resolved not to let the negative expe
rience interfere with their mission.
Unfortunately, despite its
grandeur and generally friendly and
hard-working people, Guatemala suf
fers from many of the same afflictions
as other poor Latin American nations.
The scars of a 36 year-long civil war
that left an estimated 200,000 people
dead have receded, but the legacy of
violence has not. One of the country's
leading newspapers, Nuestro Diario,
reported in an editorial Monday, that
in the first six months of this year
there had been 3,219 murders — 17
every 24 hours. By way of contrast,
the cities of New York, Los Angeles,
and Chicago combined had over 33
percent less murders in 12 months
with a slightly greater total popula
tion, according to FBI crime statistics.
Violence against women in
Guatemala is profound. I spoke with a
young woman from Boston this past
weekend during the course of a half
marathon in Antigua and she told me

that she had had to give up running in
the streets because site feared for her
safety after being groped repeatedly.
And yet, the experiences of the Bay
Area teenagers, the young woman from
Boston and, indeed, that of my family
and many others who travel here, is a
message of hope. Though she intended
to stay for only a year, my running com
panion has lived here seven years and is
raising three children. Seeds of Learn
ing has begun to collect more money to
complete a school in Salvador as well as
others in Guatemala and Nicaragua.
And this morning, as 1 watched from
my kitchen window an active volcano
spew forth smoke, it was easy to think
about the challenges and magnificence
of this place.
This afternoon I visited a bilingual
school in Panorama close to Antigua.
At the school is a six-vear-old girl. Rox
anne, w ho our family sponsors at a cost
of approximately $80 a month. Rox
anne's story is typical. I took some
Spanish lessons from her mother last
year in a poor coastal village. Although
1 never witnessed any incidents, my
teacher's boyfriend would periodically
arrive, demand money and beat her
up. He threatened her with guns and
tried on one occasion to put her hand
in an exposed electrical socket.
Amidst the chaos was Roxanne,
w ho as a particularly bright student of
five-years old, would read to me in
Spanish. The school in the village
where the family lived was frequently
closed and I urged Roxanne's mother
to return to Antigua where her family
lived. Crowded conditions in that
home and a variety of cultural reasons,
nearly prevented that from happening.
Cheerfully, the family does now
live in Antigua. Today I saw Roxanne
again where I was told by her teacher
that she is first in both her Spanish
and English classes and, more impor
tantly, attends classes regularly.
