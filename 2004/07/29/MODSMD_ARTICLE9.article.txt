# How foreign aid can help the poor, and why it usually doesn't
## 
### BRUCE BUENO de MESQUITA 
People who think foreign aid ought
to be used to help end poverty complain
that it has too many strings attached.
That strings are attached is true; rather,
the problem is not too many strings but
instead that the wrong strings are at
tached to end poverty.
Most aid reflects a deal between lead
ers in rich, democratic countries and
leaders in poor, despotic countries. Auto
crats need money to keep core support
ers — the military, key bureaucrats, close
family members — in line, and democ
rats need policy concessions that help
with reelection. Since few voters care
much about foreign policy, these are
marginal effects, and so small amounts
are spent on aid.
A natural opportunity exists for
deals between democrats and autocrats.
The latter don't need successful policies

to stay in office, so they can agree to
policies their citizens don't like in ex
change for money to sustain them in
power. Just consider Hosni Mubarak's
agreement for Egypt to live in peace
with Israel. In fact, autocrats like
Mubarak must maintain their citizen
ry's dislike for policy concessions they
grant. If the policy could be enforced
without aid, there would be no reason
to continue to pay. Democratic leaders
cannot easily buy incumbency; they
must deliver policies their constituents
like. Thus, the main string attached to
foreign aid deals is money for policy.
That is a winning situation for leaders
in donor and recipient countries and is
pretty good for donor citizens too. But
it is bad for ordinary citizens in the re
cipient country. Their welfare is sold
for aid.
No wonder aid does little to raise in
comes, improve health or education or

do the myriad other things well-inten
tioned people would like aid to do. How
might these problems be corrected?
There are four steps to changing aid into
a means to help the poor:
1) Encourage individuals and groups
giving aid through NGOs or directly to
needy recipients rather than by and to
government. Shifting aid outside govern
ment reduces the danger of government
deals that do not alleviate poverty. (Cur
rently the United States contributes about
$56 per American citizen in global aid.
Total assistance could easily be main
tained if wealthier families contributed
twice that, deducting it from their taxes as
charitable giving.)
2) Require aid recipients to open their
books to independent, external audit.
3) Broadcast audit results in an easi
ly digested form.
4) When aid must be given to gov
ernments, give to those that have at least

two organized, freely operating political
parties or other political groups that ar
ticulate views different from those of
their government, and be sure that these
groups have an unencumbered right to
compete against the incumbent leader
for office.
Until poverty-alleviating aid is
moved out of the government's domain
and into the hands of caring citizens,
and until government aid is constrained
to go as directly as possible to those who
need the money the most, aid will con
tinue to serve as a means to achieve pol
icy goals (a good thing), to prolong
despotism (a bad thing), and to lead re
cipients to engage in policies that are
against the interests of their own citizens
(a very bad thing).
