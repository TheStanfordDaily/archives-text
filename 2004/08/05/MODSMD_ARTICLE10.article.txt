## Will we ever know the whys behind evil behavior? 
### JOHN H. BUNZEL 
Too often left out of the debate over whether the
abuse and humiliation of Iraqi prisoners by American mil
itary personnel was the unauthorized work of a few rogue
guards ("bad apples") or the result of decisions made at a
higher level of command are two profound questions
about individual character, ethical judgment and the
principles of right and wrong behavior that go beyond the
horrors of the present crisis.
The first takes us into what the Chilean writer Ariel
Forman calls "the impossible heart of the matter": Is tor
ture ever justified?
One feels shame and resentment when innocent vic
tims are subject to the worst forms of cruelty and human
violence, a pattern of conduct routinely practiced todav in
countries throughout the world. But this begs a more dis
turbing question: What if the person being tortured is
guilty? What if the person has just been taken into custody
for planning a terrorist attack on the United States and
knows where and when a series of bombs will detonate
that would kill thousands of people? Would torture then
be acceptable?
The issue can be put more directly: If we were part
of an interrogating group using instruments of torture,
would we dissent and be actively opposed? If we be
lieved the interrogators were "just following orders,"
would we stand up and disobey those in authority? Or
would we consent because under these circumstances
torture was permissible?
That, says Forman, is the real question thrown up to
all of us by the pictures of human degradation in the pris
ons of Iraq, Afghanistan and who knows where else.
The second question has haunted the history of hu
manity. Is an all-powerful, all-loving God responsible for
a world filled with evil, or does the fault lie in ourselves?
Fyodor Dostoevsky, in The Brothers Karamazov, provid
ed some disturbing insights into the bases and appeals ol
authoritarian power. Most men, he said, are restless, con
fused and childlike, unable to use their freedom wisely.
Their "troublesome consciences" can only be restrained
by "miracle, mystery and authority." Undercutting demo
cratic assumptions, this remains a savage indictment ol
man's nature and needs.
It was an argument often put forward to explain the
acceptance of fascism by the German people. Over
whelmed by the burden of individual responsibility in a
chaotic world, they willingly surrendered their rights to
Hitler in exchange fora sense of security established by
the state.
Somewhere in what Isaac Newton called "the great
ocean of truth" are answers to the never-ending ques
tions about the mysteries of good and evil, raised most re
cently in Abu Ghraib prison. They are questions that
need to be asked — especially in democratic societies —
even if we are far from answering them. Are decent, or
dinary people capable of "crossing the line into barbari
ty".-' As individual moral actors, can we justly be held re
sponsible for our actions? Or, following Marx and Freud,
are we simply the agents of stronger forces that deter
mine our moral choices?
