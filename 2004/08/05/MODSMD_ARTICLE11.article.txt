An avoidable war?
Debra Sanders concludes that the in
vasion of Iraq was "justified" by Saddam
Hussein's flouting of U.N. resolutions but
also thinks "the war was more avoidable
than American thought." Avoidable isn't
the point, which is: Was it wise?
President Bush long ago affirmed
that the rationale for the war was com
plex, multiple. A major aspect was elo
quently restated a few days ago by the
new ambassador from Iraq, Mrs.
Franke, who called the military inter
vention to remove the horrendously evil
Baathist regime a "supreme moral act"
for Iraq, the region and the world. Like
practically everyone else in the leader
ship of the many countries she believed
in 2003 that weapons of mass destruc
tion still existed in Iraq and thinks they
may still show up. That is not important:
Her revised emphasis, like Bush's, was
that since Saddam (and his equally mon
strous sons) had the capacity to reconsti
tute them once he was "off the hook" of
international tension and attention, that
was a "nightmare" that could not be al
lowed to happen.
That was a very serious reason to act
— one President Bush has reiterated. The
ill-fated use of "imminent" WMD to "put a
handle" on the complex situation fora

somewhat laggard and reluctant public
proved an embarrassment for the admin
istration when the political opposition
seized on it (ignoring the fact that Clinton,
Gore, Kerry and Edwards had been simi
larly flummoxed) but had nothing to do
with the main purposes outlined above
and a further even more important one,
which Bush has often proclaimed: namely,
the need to respond to an enormous on
going threat with more than "fly-swatting"
moves against scattered terrorists around
the globe, by deploying a large army and
"showing" the millions of radical Muslims
(who got the impression earlier that we
were soft) that we mean it big time — and
have the means.
Iraq itself has been irreversibly turned
around and the whole region — not for
getting Afghanistan — has been palpably
stirred against extremism. Libya, Syria,
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Pakistan, even Iran,
perhaps even China and North Korea,
have been jolted into an awareness that we
are not playing tap-on-the-wrist games
anymore; they have to shape up. And that
they can no longer count on the Chiracs,
Villepins, Schroeders, Zapateros, Kofi An
nans and our own leftwing defeatists to
put sticks in our wheels.
Avoidable war? On the contrary,
Henry Lewis Gaddis persuasively sees it as
the smartest and most resolute foreign
policy move we have made since FDR.

Harry Potter and the
International Court of Justice
One of the signs of a good story is that,
though it is fiction, we are able to learn
lessons from it about the real world. Near
the beginning of the most recent Harry
Potter book, "Harry Potter and The Order
of the Phoenix", Harry faces a particularly
disturbing challenge. His unauthorized
use of magic to save his life is grabbed as an
excuse by the government attempting to
tar his reputation and expel him from
world society. Harry finds himself in front
of a full tribunal that is willing only to hear
what Harry has done (his unauthorized
use of magic), but not why. The court is
not willing to hear, understand or appre
ciate the circumstances that necessitated
his actions. He is saved only at the last
moment when the most powerful magi
cian forces the court to look at the evi
dence. As far as I know, all readers of the
book root for Harry, of course: To ignore
the circumstances in which he had found
himself is simply unjust.
Sadly, some countries and news
media seem to have wound up rooting
against Harry. A very similar situation
has just occurred in today's real world. Is
rael, after having more than 1,000 of its
civilians murdered by suicide bombing
terrorists, was forced to defend itself, just
like Harry, and is now building a fence to
keep the murderers away. The Interna
tional Court called Israel in front of a full
tribunal, largely in response to countries

who have reverted to manipulating the
court for political purposes, and accused
Israel of unauthorized use of its power
(building the fence). And, just as in the
story, the court did not allow Israel to pre
sent the surrounding circumstances —
murderous terrorism. The court's ex
cuse? Because the terrorism wasn't for
mally initiated or controlled by another
country, it cannot be used as grounds for
a country-level defensive response, and is
therefore inadmissible.
This story, however, did not quite end
with the Court's decision. Luckily, the role
of the good and strong wizard has been
taken on by the United States. Last week,
the U.S. House of Representatives helped
expose this international travesty of "jus
tice" by passing a Resolution condemning
the International Court of Justice for their
decision against Israel's security barrier. A
huge bi-partisan majority of 361 Con
gressman and Congresswomen voted in
favor of this resolution. In fact, although
virtually every democracy voted against
the ICJ even taking jurisdiction over the
fence case, almost every tyranny in the
world voted for the ICJ to take jurisdic
tion. It is sad and tragic that we live in a
world where many join with such cheering
tyrannies and condemn the Harry Potters.
But, hopefully they'll read some good
books that help open their eyes to the
world about them.
