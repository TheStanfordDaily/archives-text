## It's a bad time to be a Dodger fan 
### 
I love being a Giants fan. I love hating the Dodgers
because it's so ludicrously easy to root against
them. Coming into the trade deadline, the divi
sion leaders chose to make a deal so shortsighted
it is sure to make their fans long for the days when only
the Bums' on-the-field actions prevented them from
making the playoffs.
For those of you that read Michael Lewis' Moneyball,
you will remember Paul DePodesta as the Harvard-edu
cated Tails to Oakland GM Billy Beane's Sonic, a man to
whom Beane entrusted the franchise over grizzled scouts
with decades of baseball experience. Lewis spends almost
300 pages slavering over Beane's knack for isolating and
pursuing what really matters when trying to win ball
games. This magical formula, apparently, includes pri
marily disciplined hitters and pitchers who put the ball in

play. Defense and speed are virtu
ally thrown to the wind, as Beane's
teams —in accordance with the
philosophy that the value of an out
is far less than traditional baseball
wisdom affords it — tend to score
with two consecutive walks and a
three-run bomb rather than the
manufactured run.
It is precisely this shortsighted
philosophy that appears to have
driven DePodesta's moves over
the weekend.

Beginning the week up two games over the Padres
and Giants, the Dodgers decided to act. They sent All-
Star catcher Paul LoDuca, a fan favorite and the un
questioned heart of the clubhouse, to Florida, along with
stud setup man Guillermo Mota and starting right field
er Juan Encarnacion.
This meant losing starting position players who repre
sented two of only a few solid bats in the center of the
Dodgers' order (not one historically noted for its power).
Furthermore, the Dodgers gave up Mota and Tom Mar
tin, two of the rocks in what has been one of the league's
best bullpens this year.
One of the critical factors behind a quality trade is that
you upgrade one major weakness without creating any
glaring new holes. "Glaring" is a kind way to describe the
Dodgers' new catching situation. Dropping LoDuca for
replacement Brent Mayne is like dumping your girl
friend for the actress who played Topanga on Boy Meets
World — tantalizing, but then you realize it was only a
good idea about five years ago. (Speaking of which, I
had a few questions for Ben Savage, it's too bad he's not
around anymore.)
Also, let's not bring up Todd Hundley, whose percent
age of runners thrown out was often confused with his
anemic batting average, and who has had more surgeries
than the cast of an Adult Video Network Awards show.
To put it lightly, it is difficult to comprehend what the
Dodgers were thinking. On the surface, the Dodgers
come out ahead from a purely statistical standpoint, but
even then only by the barest of margins. Their return on
the investment was even more questionable in light of
what they had to give up.
First on the list of new Dodgers is Brad Penny — a guy
who has had one strong October and is a three starter at
best. Despite his impressive performance Tuesday
