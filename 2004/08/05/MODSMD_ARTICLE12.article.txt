## It's a bad time to be a Dodger fan 
### 
I love being a Giants fan. I love hating the Dodgers
because it's so ludicrously easy to root against
them. Coming into the trade deadline, the divi
sion leaders chose to make a deal so shortsighted
it is sure to make their fans long for the days when only
the Bums' on-the-field actions prevented them from
making the playoffs.
For those of you that read Michael Lewis' Moneyball,
you will remember Paul DePodesta as the Harvard-edu
cated Tails to Oakland GM Billy Beane's Sonic, a man to
whom Beane entrusted the franchise over grizzled scouts
with decades of baseball experience. Lewis spends almost
300 pages slavering over Beane's knack for isolating and
pursuing what really matters when trying to win ball
games. This magical formula, apparently, includes pri
marily disciplined hitters and pitchers who put the ball in

play. Defense and speed are virtu
ally thrown to the wind, as Beane's
teams —in accordance with the
philosophy that the value of an out
is far less than traditional baseball
wisdom affords it — tend to score
with two consecutive walks and a
three-run bomb rather than the
manufactured run.
It is precisely this shortsighted
philosophy that appears to have
driven DePodesta's moves over
the weekend.

Beginning the week up two games over the Padres
and Giants, the Dodgers decided to act. They sent All-
Star catcher Paul LoDuca, a fan favorite and the un
questioned heart of the clubhouse, to Florida, along with
stud setup man Guillermo Mota and starting right field
er Juan Encarnacion.
This meant losing starting position players who repre
sented two of only a few solid bats in the center of the
Dodgers' order (not one historically noted for its power).
Furthermore, the Dodgers gave up Mota and Tom Mar
tin, two of the rocks in what has been one of the league's
best bullpens this year.
One of the critical factors behind a quality trade is that
you upgrade one major weakness without creating any
glaring new holes. "Glaring" is a kind way to describe the
Dodgers' new catching situation. Dropping LoDuca for
replacement Brent Mayne is like dumping your girl
friend for the actress who played Topanga on Boy Meets
World — tantalizing, but then you realize it was only a
good idea about five years ago. (Speaking of which, I
had a few questions for Ben Savage, it's too bad he's not
around anymore.)
Also, let's not bring up Todd Hundley, whose percent
age of runners thrown out was often confused with his
anemic batting average, and who has had more surgeries
than the cast of an Adult Video Network Awards show.
To put it lightly, it is difficult to comprehend what the
Dodgers were thinking. On the surface, the Dodgers
come out ahead from a purely statistical standpoint, but
even then only by the barest of margins. Their return on
the investment was even more questionable in light of
what they had to give up.
First on the list of new Dodgers is Brad Penny — a guy
who has had one strong October and is a three starter at
best. Despite his impressive performance Tuesday

against Pittsburgh — which of
course has many sources already
saying DePodesta will get the last
laugh — Penny still has much to
prove as a pitcher.
Steve Finley, the centerpiece of
their new acquisitions, is a better
hitter than Lo Duca and provides
much-needed defensive stability in
the outfield. However, first base
man Hee Seop Choi is not the kind

of impact hat the Dodgers were
looking for, although he did exhib
it remarkable hustle in his first
Dodger at-bat while grounding into
a double play.
The most important part of the
Dodger trade is who didn't move.
Randy Johnson and Charles
Johnson would have been the
perfect complements to the
Dodgers' losses, plugging the
hole created by Lo Duca with one
of the best defensive catchers in
baseball and vastly improving
their pitching staff. But when
those deals crumbled, the

Dodgers were left with the losing
half of what could have turned
out to be a beneficial deal.
The worst part about baseball
trades is that there are always win
ners and losers, yet franchises al
ways feel compelled to take the
public position that they suckered
their partners and came out on
top. If publicity is the reasoning
behind this strategy, then the
Dodgers made a grievous error to
begin with by trading Lo Duca,
who along with Eric Gagne repre
sented the most beloved L.A. bat
tery in years.
Baseball is about intangibles,
and regardless of the numbers
Finley and Penny bring to the
table in August and September,
it is highly unlikely that the
Dodgers will be able to succeed
in the playoffs without a sup
portive core. Are they a more
balanced offensive team, accord
ing to the still-dubious Beane
school? Probably, but at a cost of
the historical Dodger values of
speed and bullpen pitching. Are
they a worse team in the club
house, and a less fan-friendly
product? Definitely. Only one of
those two questions is important
in October.
