# Card optimistic about 2004
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At this year's Bay Area college foot
ball kickoff luncheon, Stanford head
coach Buddy Teevens and several of
his players spoke with enthusiasm
about spring practice, summer condi
tioning and an improved attitude as
the 2004 season approaches.
August breeds optimism, so while
the Cardinal has not forgotten the
last two painful years, it believes that
this is the year things will come to
gether. Underscoring this point
were the four Stanford seniors in at
tendance — men who've seen two
prior seasons fall apart and know
just how hard it can be to win in the
Pacific-10 Conference.
"When I was a freshman, a sopho
more, winning was easy because I
wasn't the one doing it," said senior
safety Oshiomogho Atogwe, an All-
Pac-10 selection last season. "I feel
like it's myjob as a senior to instill that
in the other guys, that it's hard to win,
and when you do win, you hold on to
it and appreciate it."
Teevens, who won two games in
2002 and four last season, is more
comfortable with the shape and direc
tion of the Cardinal than ever before.
"It's a natural progression,"
Teevens said. "I look at the squad and
the experience gained and their un
derstanding of expectations. Each year
1 feel better about where our team is."
And perhaps with good reason.
The 2002 Cardinal was largelv a

shell-shocked unit, wondering what
was happening as a team expected to
be one of the best offensive units in

the country never got off the
ground, stumbling to a 2-9 fin
ish. The 2003 squad showed
more resolve and preparation,
but success on the practice
field didn't always translate to
game day. Still, the team
fought its way to a 4-4 record
before tiring late.
"We feel we have progressed,
and to substantiate that on Sat
urdays is important," Teevens
said. "It's far closer, the under
standing and belief in leader
ship, accountability and owner
ship by the players."
Ask Stanford's seniors what
their goal is, and their hope is
both clear and reasonable.
"The team goal is just to get
back to the bowl game," senior
tight end Alex Smith said.
"That's really the main goal
that the seniors have set."
Helping out Stanford's quest
will be the addition of one more
bowl to the Pac-10's slate of af
filiated postseason contests.
As was announced at Mon
day's luncheon, the Emerald

Bowl (formerly known as the San
Francisco Bowl) has reached an
agreement with the Pac-10 to take
its sixth-best team, to play against
the Mountain West's third-best
team at SBC Park on Dec. 30. The
addition of this bowl will, in all like

lihood, give a bowl berth to a Pac-10
team that otherwise wouldn't re
ceive an invite.

Of course, before Stanford can
worry about bowl games, it will
need to find at least six wins on its
always-difficult schedule. Going
even 2-6 in the Pac-10, as the Cardi-

nal did last year, is not going to
be an easy task. For the second
straight year, Stanford does not
get to play Pac-10 doormat Ari
zona, which was the only team
picked by the media to finish
below the Cardinal this year.
Home dates against San Jose
State and Brigham Young
should — need — to get the
Cardinal off to a good start. After
an off week, Stanford will face
2003 national champion South
ern California and Washington
at home. Circle the Huskies in
red. because they're the kind of
team Stanford must beat this
year if it wants to improve on last
year's record.
The rest of the season offers
road contests at Notre Dame,
Washington State, UCLA, Ari
zona State and Cal, as well as
home dates with Oregon and
Oregon State.
The teams on Stanford's
schedule went a combined 75-63
last year.
In addition to returning nine
defensive and five offensive
starts, Stanford has made what
it hopes are corrective changes
to its game plan. Defensive co
ordinator A.J. Christoff, in his
second season, has installed a 3-
4 defensive scheme and Bill
Cubit, promoted to offensive
coordinator in the wake of
David Kelly's departure, will

bring some new wrinkles to
Teevens' offense.
One change might be a more
focal role for Smith, who caught
30 balls in 2002 and 24 last year.
Smith has been working closely
with starting quarterback Trent
Edwards, who saw action in five
games as a redshirt freshman
last season.
"We've been trying to work
out as much as possible," Smith
said. "Together, we're just trying
to work on timing."
With Smith's strong play in
the middle of the field, Edwards
(77-of-170 for 750 yards last
year) will look to standout Mark
Bradford (37 catches as a true
freshman) down the field. Wide
outs like 6-foot-7 Evan Moore,
Greg Camarillo and converted
safety Marcus McCutcheon —
who Smith cited as one of the
most impressive players in
spring cam — will give Edwards
a variety of other targets.
"Trent was very strong this
spring," Teevens said. "He's
about 15-18 pounds heavier, his
confidence is strong and he's
throwing the ball effectively."
Running backs JR. Lemon
(118 carries for 467 yards) and
Kenneth Tolon (150 rushes for
522 yards) will lead the ground
game behind a young but talent
ed offensive line.
"W r ith J.R. Lemon's work ethic
all through the winter and
spring, I feel he's ready to break
out," Smith said.
On defense, Stanford's line
backing corps — possibly the

team's strongest unit — is excited
about the new four-backer scheme.
"I think since we're playing
a 3-4 now, that just allows us to
blitz from either side of the ball
at any time," said senior David
Bergeron, who ranked third
on the team with 66 tackles last
season. "This just gives us
more flexibility."
Senior linebacker Jared New
berry, who had 67 tackles and a
team-high 9.5 tackles fora loss
last season, believes the success of
the blitz will all start with the play
of junior nose tackle Babatunde
Oshinowo, who had a team-high
four sacks in 2003.
"The defense is really based
on Babatunde," Newberry
said. "If we can get that push
from the front three, that'll
make it so they can't hit those
plays downhill."
Atogwe, the team's defensive
MVP last season with a team
high 90 tackles as a free safety,
will lead the secondary, which re
turns in its entirety. Leigh Tor
rence and Stanley Wilson are the
corners and Trevor Hooper is
the strong safety.
Kicker Michael Sgroi (7-of
-13 on field goals) returns, but
the Cardinal will have to find a
replacement for All-Pac-10
punter Eric Johnson, who often
did kickoffs last year while set
ting a school record with 3,687
gross yards.
Teevens and the Cardinal
know that cynicism is high and ex
pectations are low after the last
two seasons, but that hasn't damp

ened his relentless enthusiasm.
"Certainly, with where we've
been, I understand the (nega
tive) perspective," he said. "[But]
we've played a lot of young play
ers early out of necessity.
Though they may be young in
years, they're a little bit longer in
experience."
For their part, the Cardinal
players want to make 2002-03 go
down as nothing more than a
learning experience.
"You're embarrassed that it
happened, but it's fuel to never
let it happen again," Atogwe said.
"You don't want that to be what
people remember you for."

"Trent was very strong this
spring," Teevens said. "He's
about 15-18 pounds heavier, his
confidence is strong and he's
throwing the ball effectively."
Running backs JR. Lemon
(118 carries for 467 yards) and
Kenneth Tolon (150 rushes for
522 yards) will lead the ground
game behind a young but talent
ed offensive line.
"W r ith J.R. Lemon's work ethic
all through the winter and
spring, I feel he's ready to break
out," Smith said.
On defense, Stanford's line
backing corps — possibly the

team's strongest unit — is excited
about the new four-backer scheme.
"I think since we're playing
a 3-4 now, that just allows us to
blitz from either side of the ball
at any time," said senior David
Bergeron, who ranked third
on the team with 66 tackles last
season. "This just gives us
more flexibility."
Senior linebacker Jared New
berry, who had 67 tackles and a
team-high 9.5 tackles fora loss
last season, believes the success of
the blitz will all start with the play
of junior nose tackle Babatunde
Oshinowo, who had a team-high
four sacks in 2003.
"The defense is really based
on Babatunde," Newberry
said. "If we can get that push
from the front three, that'll
make it so they can't hit those
plays downhill."
Atogwe, the team's defensive
MVP last season with a team
high 90 tackles as a free safety,
will lead the secondary, which re
turns in its entirety. Leigh Tor
rence and Stanley Wilson are the
corners and Trevor Hooper is
the strong safety.
Kicker Michael Sgroi (7-of
-13 on field goals) returns, but
the Cardinal will have to find a
replacement for All-Pac-10
punter Eric Johnson, who often
did kickoffs last year while set
ting a school record with 3,687
gross yards.
Teevens and the Cardinal
know that cynicism is high and ex
pectations are low after the last
two seasons, but that hasn't damp

ened his relentless enthusiasm.
"Certainly, with where we've
been, I understand the (nega
tive) perspective," he said. "[But]
we've played a lot of young play
ers early out of necessity.
Though they may be young in
years, they're a little bit longer in
experience."
For their part, the Cardinal
players want to make 2002-03 go
down as nothing more than a
learning experience.
"You're embarrassed that it
happened, but it's fuel to never
let it happen again," Atogwe said.
"You don't want that to be what
people remember you for."
At this year's Bay Area college foot
ball kickoff luncheon, Stanford head
coach Buddy Teevens and several of
his players spoke with enthusiasm
about spring practice, summer condi
tioning and an improved attitude as
the 2004 season approaches.
August breeds optimism, so while
the Cardinal has not forgotten the
last two painful years, it believes that
this is the year things will come to
gether. Underscoring this point
were the four Stanford seniors in at
tendance — men who've seen two
prior seasons fall apart and know
just how hard it can be to win in the
Pacific-10 Conference.
"When I was a freshman, a sopho
more, winning was easy because I
wasn't the one doing it," said senior
safety Oshiomogho Atogwe, an All-
Pac-10 selection last season. "I feel
like it's myjob as a senior to instill that
in the other guys, that it's hard to win,
and when you do win, you hold on to
it and appreciate it."
Teevens, who won two games in
2002 and four last season, is more
comfortable with the shape and direc
tion of the Cardinal than ever before.
"It's a natural progression,"
Teevens said. "I look at the squad and
the experience gained and their un
derstanding of expectations. Each year
1 feel better about where our team is."
And perhaps with good reason.
The 2002 Cardinal was largelv a

shell-shocked unit, wondering what
was happening as a team expected to
be one of the best offensive units in

the country never got off the
ground, stumbling to a 2-9 fin

more resolve and preparation,
but success on the practice
field didn't always translate to
game day. Still, the team
fought its way to a 4-4 record
before tiring late.
"We feel we have progressed,
and to substantiate that on Sat

said. "It's far closer, the under

Ask Stanford's seniors what

get to play Pac-10 doormat Ari

picked by the media to finish
below the Cardinal this year.
Home dates against San Jose

Cardinal off to a good start. After

at home. Circle the Huskies in

team Stanford must beat this
year if it wants to improve on last
year's record.
The rest of the season offers
road contests at Notre Dame,
Washington State, UCLA, Ari
zona State and Cal, as well as
home dates with Oregon and
Oregon State.
The teams on Stanford's
schedule went a combined 75-63
last year.
In addition to returning nine
defensive and five offensive
starts, Stanford has made what
it hopes are corrective changes
to its game plan. Defensive co
ordinator A.J. Christoff, in his
second season, has installed a 3-
4 defensive scheme and Bill
Cubit, promoted to offensive
coordinator in the wake of
David Kelly's departure, will

bring some new wrinkles to
Teevens' offense.
One change might be a more
focal role for Smith, who caught
30 balls in 2002 and 24 last year.
Smith has been working closely
with starting quarterback Trent
Edwards, who saw action in five
games as a redshirt freshman
last season.
"We've been trying to work
out as much as possible," Smith
said. "Together, we're just trying
to work on timing."
With Smith's strong play in
the middle of the field, Edwards
(77-of-170 for 750 yards last
year) will look to standout Mark
Bradford (37 catches as a true
freshman) down the field. Wide
outs like 6-foot-7 Evan Moore,
Greg Camarillo and converted
safety Marcus McCutcheon —
who Smith cited as one of the
most impressive players in
spring cam — will give Edwards
a variety of other targets.
"Trent was very strong this

about 15-18 pounds heavier, his
confidence is strong and he's

Of course, before Stanford can

field this season as a team captain. Stanford will
be attempting to improve on its slightly shabby 4-

nal did last year, is not going to
be an easy task. For the second
straight year, Stanford does not
get to play Pac-10 doormat Ari
zona, which was the only team
picked by the media to finish
below the Cardinal this year.
Home dates against San Jose
State and Brigham Young
should — need — to get the
Cardinal off to a good start. After
an off week, Stanford will face
2003 national champion South
ern California and Washington
at home. Circle the Huskies in
red. because they're the kind of
team Stanford must beat this
year if it wants to improve on last
year's record.
The rest of the season offers
road contests at Notre Dame,
Washington State, UCLA, Ari
zona State and Cal, as well as
home dates with Oregon and
Oregon State.
The teams on Stanford's
schedule went a combined 75-63
last year.
In addition to returning nine
defensive and five offensive
starts, Stanford has made what
it hopes are corrective changes
to its game plan. Defensive co
ordinator A.J. Christoff, in his
second season, has installed a 3-
4 defensive scheme and Bill
Cubit, promoted to offensive
coordinator in the wake of
David Kelly's departure, will

bring some new wrinkles to
Teevens' offense.
One change might be a more
focal role for Smith, who caught
30 balls in 2002 and 24 last year.
Smith has been working closely
with starting quarterback Trent
Edwards, who saw action in five
games as a redshirt freshman
last season.
"We've been trying to work
out as much as possible," Smith
said. "Together, we're just trying
to work on timing."
With Smith's strong play in
the middle of the field, Edwards
(77-of-170 for 750 yards last
year) will look to standout Mark
Bradford (37 catches as a true
freshman) down the field. Wide
outs like 6-foot-7 Evan Moore,
Greg Camarillo and converted
safety Marcus McCutcheon —
who Smith cited as one of the
most impressive players in
spring cam — will give Edwards
a variety of other targets.
"Trent was very strong this
spring," Teevens said. "He's
about 15-18 pounds heavier, his
confidence is strong and he's
throwing the ball effectively."
Running backs JR. Lemon
(118 carries for 467 yards) and
Kenneth Tolon (150 rushes for
522 yards) will lead the ground
game behind a young but talent
ed offensive line.
"W r ith J.R. Lemon's work ethic
all through the winter and
spring, I feel he's ready to break
out," Smith said.
On defense, Stanford's line
backing corps — possibly the

team's strongest unit — is excited
about the new four-backer scheme.
"I think since we're playing
a 3-4 now, that just allows us to
blitz from either side of the ball
at any time," said senior David
Bergeron, who ranked third
on the team with 66 tackles last
season. "This just gives us
more flexibility."
Senior linebacker Jared New
berry, who had 67 tackles and a
team-high 9.5 tackles fora loss
last season, believes the success of
the blitz will all start with the play
of junior nose tackle Babatunde
Oshinowo, who had a team-high
four sacks in 2003.
"The defense is really based
on Babatunde," Newberry
said. "If we can get that push
from the front three, that'll
make it so they can't hit those
plays downhill."
Atogwe, the team's defensive
MVP last season with a team
high 90 tackles as a free safety,
will lead the secondary, which re
turns in its entirety. Leigh Tor
rence and Stanley Wilson are the
corners and Trevor Hooper is
the strong safety.
Kicker Michael Sgroi (7-of
-13 on field goals) returns, but
the Cardinal will have to find a
replacement for All-Pac-10
punter Eric Johnson, who often
did kickoffs last year while set
ting a school record with 3,687
gross yards.
Teevens and the Cardinal
know that cynicism is high and ex
pectations are low after the last
two seasons, but that hasn't damp

ened his relentless enthusiasm.
"Certainly, with where we've
been, I understand the (nega
tive) perspective," he said. "[But]
we've played a lot of young play
ers early out of necessity.
Though they may be young in
years, they're a little bit longer in
experience."
For their part, the Cardinal
players want to make 2002-03 go
down as nothing more than a
learning experience.
"You're embarrassed that it
happened, but it's fuel to never
let it happen again," Atogwe said.
"You don't want that to be what
people remember you for."
