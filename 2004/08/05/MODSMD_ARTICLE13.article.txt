# Card optimistic about 2004

### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At this year's Bay Area college foot
ball kickoff luncheon, Stanford head
coach Buddy Teevens and several of
his players spoke with enthusiasm
about spring practice, summer condi
tioning and an improved attitude as
the 2004 season approaches.
August breeds optimism, so while
the Cardinal has not forgotten the
last two painful years, it believes that
this is the year things will come to
gether. Underscoring this point
were the four Stanford seniors in at
tendance â€” men who've seen two
prior seasons fall apart and know
just how hard it can be to win in the
Pacific-10 Conference.
"When I was a freshman, a sopho
more, winning was easy because I
wasn't the one doing it," said senior
safety Oshiomogho Atogwe, an All-
Pac-10 selection last season. "I feel
like it's myjob as a senior to instill that
in the other guys, that it's hard to win,
and when you do win, you hold on to
it and appreciate it."
Teevens, who won two games in
2002 and four last season, is more
comfortable with the shape and direc
tion of the Cardinal than ever before.
"It's a natural progression,"
Teevens said. "I look at the squad and
the experience gained and their un
derstanding of expectations. Each year
1 feel better about where our team is."
And perhaps with good reason.
The 2002 Cardinal was largelv a

shell-shocked unit, wondering what
was happening as a team expected to
be one of the best offensive units in

the country never got off the
ground, stumbling to a 2-9 fin
ish. The 2003 squad showed
more resolve and preparation,
but success on the practice
field didn't always translate to
game day. Still, the team
fought its way to a 4-4 record
before tiring late.
"We feel we have progressed,
and to substantiate that on Sat
urdays is important," Teevens
said. "It's far closer, the under
standing and belief in leader
ship, accountability and owner
ship by the players."
Ask Stanford's seniors what
their goal is, and their hope is
both clear and reasonable.
"The team goal is just to get
back to the bowl game," senior
tight end Alex Smith said.
"That's really the main goal
that the seniors have set."
Helping out Stanford's quest
will be the addition of one more
bowl to the Pac-10's slate of af
filiated postseason contests.
As was announced at Mon
day's luncheon, the Emerald

Bowl (formerly known as the San
Francisco Bowl) has reached an
agreement with the Pac-10 to take
its sixth-best team, to play against
the Mountain West's third-best
team at SBC Park on Dec. 30. The
addition of this bowl will, in all like

lihood, give a bowl berth to a Pac-10
team that otherwise wouldn't re
ceive an invite.

Of course, before Stanford can
worry about bowl games, it will
need to find at least six wins on its
always-difficult schedule. Going
even 2-6 in the Pac-10, as the Cardi-

field this season as a team captain. Stanford will
be attempting to improve on its slightly shabby 4-
