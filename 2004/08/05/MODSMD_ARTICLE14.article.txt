# Golden Bears, Spartans prepared for new season
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
California and San Jose State
joined Stanford at Monday's Bay
Area football kick-off luncheon, and
while both teams wear blue and
gold, they present quite a contrast.
Cal, ranked No. 15 nationally in
the pre-season media poll, will battle
national No. 1 Southern California
for the Pacific-10 Conference's Bowl
Championship Series berth. The
Golden Bears were the only team to
defeat the Trojans last year.
San Jose, like Stanford, went 2-
6 in conference last year. The dif
ference, of course, is that the
Spartans play.in the Western Ath
letic Conference. The squad stum
bled to a 3-8 overall record last
year and enters this campaign re

turning just eight starters from
last season. The media picked the
Spartans to finish last in the WAC
this year.
Cal head coach Jeff Tedford
spoke proudly about having "90 or
95" players on campus for summer
conditioning, while San Jose State
head coach Fitz Hill was proud
that the Spartans have 76 scholar
ship players this year (the Spar
tans have never reached the
NCAA maximum of 85 scholarship
players). The disparity is under
standable, since the Spartans drew
75,398 fans for their five home
games, while the Golden Bears
drew 232,159 fans for their six
contests in Berkeley.
But both teams share an enthu
siasm that is sparked by their
coaches. Hill is in his fourth
year and was signed to an ex
tension through 2006 last year.
The Spartans are just 12-24
during his tenure, but Hill —
who holds a doctorate in educa
tion and received a Bronze Star
for his service as an Army lieu
tenant during Operation
Desert Storm — has received
much recognition for his influ
ence on his players. The team's
CPA has improved markedly
during the tenure of one of the
NCAA's few African-American
head coaches.
Tedford enters his third sea
son having already pocketed
one Pac-10 Coach of the Year
award. Tedford engineered the
nation's biggest turnaround in
2002, leading the Bears to a 7-5
record — their first winning
season in nine years — after
they went 1-10 in 2001 under
Tom Holmoe. The Bears are
15-11 during his tenure, and
he has a reputation for devel
oping NFL quarterbacks and
record-setting offense wherev
er he's gone. He's also 2-0 in
Big Games.
San Jose State is the first team
on Stanford's schedule this year,
while Cal is the last, providing an
interesting pair of bookends to
the Cardinal's campaign.
