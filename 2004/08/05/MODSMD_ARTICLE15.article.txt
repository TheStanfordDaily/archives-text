# Women nab bronze medal
## 
### 
The U.S. Olympic volleyball team,
led by dominating Stanford alum
Logan Tom, enacted some revenge
on the Cuban squad on Sunday to
capture a bronze medal at the World
Grand Prix in Italy. Cuba, the
Olympic gold medal team in the last
three Games, defeated the U.S. 3-2 in
the first round of the competition on
July 10.
The American women concluded
the Grand Prix, which is considered
by many to be the most reliable pre
dictor of the Olympic final standings,
with an overall 8-5 record. Ihe
bronze medal is the second consecu
tive for Team USA, which, needless to
say, is seeking a medal of a slightly dif
ferent hue in Athens later this month.
And if the Grand Prix was any in-
dication, Tom will be one of the
keys to the squad's Olympic
success. The former Cardinal
not only notched a match-high
14 points in Team USA's 25-20,
25-22, 25-16 rout of Cuba, but
was the entire tournament's
leading scorer with 66 points in
the final round and the tour
ney's Best Server.
Brazil took top honors at the
Grand Prix, trouncing Italy, 3-1
fora tournament record of 12-1.
Team USA begins its charge
for gold on Aug. 14, when the
squad takes on China in Athens.
