## Fl√ºgtag: Don't forget the umlauts and the Red Bull 
### JOHN HOLGATE INTERMISSION GRAVITY EXPERT 
Touted as "an extraordinary flying day,"
Fliigtag is an event that combines the greatest
strengths of mankind, a showcase of human en
durance and ingenuity. On the final day ofjuly,
27 teams took to the skies above the Willamette
River in Portland, Oregon, attempting to escape
the clutches of gravity. Twenty-seven flying ves
sels left the Fliigtag airstrip, representing the
apogee of human creativity, teamwork, bravery
and craftsmanship.
Yes, the famous 27 left land's safety that day,

stretching for the skies in the continual quest to
defy the gods, to search for self-awareness in
spaces we are not meant to reach. After launch
ing upward and forward from a 30-foot deck,
the flying machines soared through the air,
some traveling as far as 20 or even 22 feet be
fore caressing the cool water of the Willamette.
It was a pitiful spectacle unlike anything I have
ever witnessed.
Fliigtag is German for "how the hell did I get
stuck jumping into a river inside a wooden death
contraption" or "Flying Day" or something like
that. Red Bull has sponsored this minor miracle

of human stupidity for over 10 years now.
Teams of five or six design a non-powered
airplane that aims to fly as far as possible off
the edge of 30-foot barge parked in the middle
of the river. Judges score the teams on dis
tance, creativity of design and overall flair.
Most of the judges were either skateboarders
who had hit their head one too manv times or
DJs at local rock stations that cater to the low
est common denominator of the radio audi
ence. These fine vestiges of American democ
racy voted on which team would be the recipi
ent of the grand prize: a jumbo-sized check to
taling . . . $7,500. Dude, the winning contes
tants could totally afford to pay off the doc
tor's bills after getting whiplash from slam
ming into the water so hard.
With so little incentive to actually try and fly,
but free reign to live out everyone's childhood
fantasy of dressing up like Fat Elvis and jump
ing into a river aboard a giant donut (more on
that later), the day produced plenty of enter
tainment but not so much soaring. Needless to
say, Fliigtag is the ultimate triumph of style
over substance.
This year's contest came under the cloudless
skies of the Rose City with over 7,000 people on
hand to watch a cross between old footage of
the Wright Brothers and MTV's "Jackass". By
far the most entertaining team consisted of the
five Flying Elvi (plural for Elvis, or so they say).
After jiggling various layers of blubber and
shouting "Uh huh!" in thick southern drawls,
the men flung a giant inner tube disguised as a
jelly donut into the water with one unlucky
Elvis aboard. After strutting their stuff in front
of thousands, I'm sure it will crush their egos to
go back home and sit on the porch, spraying
the neighbor's dog when it comes too close to
the wife's geraniums. But those are the perils
of fame.
Lest you think Fliigtag is all fun and donuts,

instant replays will not let you
forget the humiliating pain suf
fered by numerous teams. The
debris-strewn crashes of Hair
Force One's Mullet Brigade and
Willy Wonka's Oompa Loompas
quickly come to mind. But more
than the crashes, it's the faces that

I'll remember: a fully made-up
Chewbacca lamenting the disap
pointing flight of Luke's X-VVing
Fighter; the one-eyed glare of
Captain Blackbeard as the water
rushed up towards his tlying pi
rate ship all too quickly; the
shock on the Pope's face as God's
hand did not catch his Popemo
bile in mid-air . . . Ahh, yes, the
memories, the memories. Fliig
tag: humanity's most stunning
achievement in the perpetual
quest. . . for laughter.
