# The 						definitive summer guide to drunken gaming: Play and forget (everything)
## 
### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION (SOBER) GAMER 
Sick and tired of your mind
less summer job scooping ice
cream for hungry consumers?
Are you fed up with your SRC
work after realizing that re
search is, to say the least, slight
ly repetitive? Looking fora way
to unwind that's cheap, enter
taining and doesn't require
leaving your futon? Well, be
fore you go any further, check
out these excellent party
games, complete with tips in
case you decide to go all out
and get a keg for you and your
three buddies.
Karaoke Revolution (Playstation 2)
What is it? Karaoke Revolu
tion is a series of video games
published by Konami that in
clude about 35 songs per title to
sing along to. The original game
even comes with a free headset
microphone to get you started.
Is it cool? If you're a fan of
any normal karaoke night,
then you'll enjoy it. The game
measures you purely by your
pitch, so you could totally de
stroy the lyrics to the games
and still come out with a good
score if you can hit the notes.
So unless you're William Hung
(i.e. tone deaf), hope is not
completely lost, even if you're
slurring your words by the time
it's your turn. There are vari
ous difficulty levels for the
singing illiterate.
The Beer Factor: Once vou

get a few cold ones inside you and
your friends, everyone will enjoy
your horrible screeching of Brit
ney Spears' latest hit (or The Po
lice if you're into older songs).
The best part? You won't re
member it in the morning. (And
you won't be humiliating your
self in a public place.)
Drunken Fun Rating: 3 out of
4 beers.
Dance Dance Revolution
(X-Box, Playstation 1 and 2)
What is it? Another game
published by Konami, DDR is
still a giant hit in Japan and is
slowly becoming an arcade
and console classic for its com
bination of great dance songs
and hardcore moves. The ar
cade version is perhaps one of
the only places you will see
sober white guys dance (if you
can call coordinating stomps
to colored arrows on a screen
dancing). The home version
includes a touch sensitive pad
that keeps track of your
moves. It is currently lauded
as the only exercise a gamer
will ever get.
Is it cool? If you're into up
beat dance hits, you'll have a
blast dancing along to these
amped up tunes. The arcade
version includes guardrails that
provide grips for inverted
moves on the floor, but you're
on your own for the home ver
sion. There's a tutorial for new
comers and an exercise mode if
you're into counting calories. Just
make sure you get a good pad to
go with it, one that won't slide
around as you try to maneuver to
the next level.
The Beer Factor: You know
you're going to have at least one
person that for some reason is
really good at this game at your
party. It's usually the last person
you'd expect to be coordinated
enough to keep up with Dance
Dance Revolution. Take him
down a notch by making win
ners of dance matches chug a
beer. We'll see how long he
keeps his balance then. Just
make sure you don't have any
hard surfaces nearbv — we

don't want any accidents caused
by tripping, kids.
Drunken Fun Rating: 2 1/2
out of 4 beers.
Super Smash Brothers Melee
(Gamecube)
What is it? The flagship party
title developed by Nintendo. If
you've ever gone near a video
game session at school, you've
probably seen them playing this.
Smash Bros, is notoriously fa
mous for its fast-paced, frenetic
battles where players pick famous
Nintendo characters and beat the
crap out of each other.
Is it cool? The game is ridicu
lously easy to pick up (fling your
opponent off the stage and get a
point for the "kill") and takes
only a bit of time to master.
There's been manv a time where
I've seen a newbie destroy a self

proclaimed veteran. You can
choose from 25 classic Nintendo
characters, play in 18 highly de
tailed arenas (and the unlock
able secret ones) and multiple
play modes. Super Smash Broth
ers Melee is highly addicting and
will have players coming back
for more.
The Beer Factor: Hell, half
the people can't even under
stand what's going on while
they're sober, much less in a
drunken stupor. Bright colors
and graphics help keep tanked
players glued to the screen. Ex
pect lots of inebriated arguing
over who killed who killed
whom and how the last match
was totally fixed. Don't forget
folks: The best way to settle an
argument is with a boat race (of
the chugging kind).

The Beer Factor: Once vou

get a few cold ones inside you and
your friends, everyone will enjoy
your horrible screeching of Brit
ney Spears' latest hit (or The Po
lice if you're into older songs).
The best part? You won't re
member it in the morning. (And
you won't be humiliating your
self in a public place.)

Dance Dance Revolution
(X-Box, Playstation 1 and 2)
What is it? Another game
published by Konami, DDR is
still a giant hit in Japan and is
slowly becoming an arcade
and console classic for its com
bination of great dance songs
and hardcore moves. The ar
cade version is perhaps one of
the only places you will see
sober white guys dance (if you
can call coordinating stomps
to colored arrows on a screen
dancing). The home version
includes a touch sensitive pad
that keeps track of your
moves. It is currently lauded
as the only exercise a gamer
will ever get.
Is it cool? If you're into up
beat dance hits, you'll have a
blast dancing along to these
amped up tunes. The arcade
version includes guardrails that
provide grips for inverted
moves on the floor, but you're
on your own for the home ver
sion. There's a tutorial for new
comers and an exercise mode if
you're into counting calories. Just
make sure you get a good pad to
go with it, one that won't slide
around as you try to maneuver to
the next level.
The Beer Factor: You know
you're going to have at least one
person that for some reason is
really good at this game at your
party. It's usually the last person
you'd expect to be coordinated
enough to keep up with Dance
Dance Revolution. Take him
down a notch by making win
ners of dance matches chug a
beer. We'll see how long he
keeps his balance then. Just
make sure you don't have any
hard surfaces nearbv — we

don't want any accidents caused
by tripping, kids.

Super Smash Brothers Melee
(Gamecube)
What is it? The flagship party
title developed by Nintendo. If
you've ever gone near a video
game session at school, you've
probably seen them playing this.
Smash Bros, is notoriously fa
mous for its fast-paced, frenetic
battles where players pick famous
Nintendo characters and beat the
crap out of each other.
Is it cool? The game is ridicu
lously easy to pick up (fling your
opponent off the stage and get a
point for the "kill") and takes
only a bit of time to master.
There's been manv a time where
I've seen a newbie destroy a self

proclaimed veteran. You can
choose from 25 classic Nintendo
characters, play in 18 highly de
tailed arenas (and the unlock
able secret ones) and multiple
play modes. Super Smash Broth
ers Melee is highly addicting and
will have players coming back
for more.
The Beer Factor: Hell, half
the people can't even under
stand what's going on while
they're sober, much less in a
drunken stupor. Bright colors
and graphics help keep tanked
players glued to the screen. Ex
pect lots of inebriated arguing
over who killed who killed
whom and how the last match
was totally fixed. Don't forget
folks: The best way to settle an
argument is with a boat race (of
the chugging kind).
Drunken Fun Rating: 4 out of

Sick and tired of your mind
less summer job scooping ice
cream for hungry consumers?
Are you fed up with your SRC
work after realizing that re
search is, to say the least, slight
ly repetitive? Looking fora way
to unwind that's cheap, enter
taining and doesn't require
leaving your futon? Well, be
fore you go any further, check
out these excellent party
games, complete with tips in
case you decide to go all out
and get a keg for you and your
three buddies.
Karaoke Revolution (Playstation 2)
What is it? Karaoke Revolu
tion is a series of video games
published by Konami that in
clude about 35 songs per title to
sing along to. The original game
even comes with a free headset
microphone to get you started.
Is it cool? If you're a fan of
any normal karaoke night,
then you'll enjoy it. The game
measures you purely by your
pitch, so you could totally de
stroy the lyrics to the games
and still come out with a good
score if you can hit the notes.
So unless you're William Hung
(i.e. tone deaf), hope is not
completely lost, even if you're
slurring your words by the time
it's your turn. There are vari
ous difficulty levels for the
singing illiterate.
