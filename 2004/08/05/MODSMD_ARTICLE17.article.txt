Sick and tired of your mind
less summer job scooping ice
cream for hungry consumers?
Are you fed up with your SRC
work after realizing that re
search is, to say the least, slight
ly repetitive? Looking fora way
to unwind that's cheap, enter
taining and doesn't require
leaving your futon? Well, be
fore you go any further, check
out these excellent party
games, complete with tips in
case you decide to go all out
and get a keg for you and your
three buddies.
Karaoke Revolution (Playstation 2)
What is it? Karaoke Revolu
tion is a series of video games
published by Konami that in
clude about 35 songs per title to
sing along to. The original game
even comes with a free headset
microphone to get you started.
Is it cool? If you're a fan of
any normal karaoke night,

So unless you're William Hung

you won't be humiliating your
self in a public place.)
Drunken Fun Rating: 3 out of

(X-Box, Playstation 1 and 2)
What is it? Another game
published by Konami, DDR is

slowly becoming an arcade
and console classic for its com
bination of great dance songs
and hardcore moves. The ar
cade version is perhaps one of
the only places you will see
sober white guys dance (if you
can call coordinating stomps
to colored arrows on a screen
dancing). The home version
includes a touch sensitive pad
that keeps track of your
moves. It is currently lauded
as the only exercise a gamer
will ever get.
Is it cool? If you're into up
beat dance hits, you'll have a
blast dancing along to these
amped up tunes. The arcade
version includes guardrails that
provide grips for inverted
moves on the floor, but you're
on your own for the home ver

comers and an exercise mode if
