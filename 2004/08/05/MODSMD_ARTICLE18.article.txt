# M. Night Shyamalan proves that it indeed takes a 'Village'

### SCOTT HOWARD INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
The films of M. Night Shyamalan
are critic-proof. No one is going to give
away the ending in a review, and his

cused of spoiling anything for anybody,
here's part of the official summary from
the movie's Web site: "At first glance, this
