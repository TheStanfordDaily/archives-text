# M. Night Shyamalan proves that it indeed takes a 'Village'
## 
### SCOTT HOWARD INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
The films of M. Night Shyamalan
are critic-proof. No one is going to give
away the ending in a review, and his
movies are all about the endings, so it
logically follows that everything lead
ing up to the last five minutes is a total
lie. If you can put up with this, then
you're a fan of his movies.
I have enjoyed all of Shyamalan's
films, especially 2000's brilliant su
perhero deconstruction "Unbreak
able". Although he broke through

with 1999's "The Sixth Sense," the
film suffered from the director's
then-underdeveloped visual style
and the self-conscious creepiness of
Haley Joel Osment. Since then, his
films have been unmistakably his
own. They operate in a queasy, min
imalistic world with little dialogue
and metaphors aplenty. Though
some feel that his work amounts to
little more than elaborate, melan
choly practical jokes, I view his ninth
inning trickery as just another part
of the Shyamalan style, just as Wes
Anderson always uses Rolling

Stones songs, Oliver Stone always
confronts corrupt authority and
Lars Von Trier always centers his
movies on a simpleminded young
woman being exploited.
"The Village" is his newest, strangest,
most challenging and, in many ways,
least successful film. Unfortunately, 1
can't say very much about it because I'd
reveal too much. So that I won't be ac
cused of spoiling anything for anybody,
here's part of the official summary from
the movie's Web site: "At first glance, this

village seems picture perfect, but
this close-knit communitv lives with
the frightening knowledge that
creatures reside in the surrounding
woods. When curious, headstrong
Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix)
plans to step beyond the boundaries
of the town and into the unknown,
his bold move threatens to forever
change the future of the village."
I hat's not really accurate, but it
doesn't give too much away. The
movie's really about Ivy Walker
(Bryce Dallas Howard, Opie's
daughter), a blind girl who falls in
love with Hunt. All of the perfor
mances are great, and are especial
ly rewarding considering that
Howard and Phoenix were re
placements for the painfully ordi
nary Kirsten Dunst and the
painfully brain dead Ashton Kutch
er (the title then was"The Woods,"
which is much more appropriate).
Shyamalan's direction is the best it
has ever been except for one no
table segment that threatens to ruin
the entire movie by catering to the
lowest common denominator in a
way I would have never expected
from a filmmaker of his stature.
L ntil now, his films have alwavs re
warded his audience's intelligence.
1 his scene is like something made
by a child for children, and it is in

tended to serve as the big suspense
till climax for an important mod
ern-day allegory by one of the
world's most popular film artists.
"The Village" has some small
errors that should have been cor
rected (the sloppy editing in the
first 10 minutes of the film hint at
more in-depth introductions) but
is deeply Hawed in a number of
ways that cannot be fixed (the last
45 minutes). In order to complete
its message, the movie is required
to leave logic at its most critical
moment, and that weakens every
thing it has to say. I know this re
view has been cryptic, but those
who have seen the film probably
know what 1 mean, especially
those who understand its obvious
political message. In many ways
the film is Shyamalan's update of
"The Crucible".
I am the type of movie buff who
loves a movie with rough edges. If
a filmmaker takes a large leap and
stumbles along the way at times,
I'll still probably enjoy the results
of his or her labor. "Gangs of New
York," my number one film of
2002, gave third billing and a good
half hour of screen time to an ac
tress who should have been cut
completely out of the movie. I
liked "The Village" but ultimately
expect more from a man who
fooled a nation of jaded moviego
ers into watching a whole film
without realizing that the main
character was dead.
