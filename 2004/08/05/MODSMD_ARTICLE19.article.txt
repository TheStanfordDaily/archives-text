# Roxy boldly takes on 'The Happiest Place on Earth'
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
"Whenever / go on a ride, I'm always thinking
of what's wrong with the thing and how it ran
be improved."
— Walt Disney
Roxy decided to head to "The Happiest
Place on Earth" (TM) after agreeing with
such encouraging quotes by the head
Mouseketeer himself, Mr. Disney (although
Walt probably wasn't talking about Roxy's
favorite kind of ride, the one that doesn't re
quire tracks or a motor). You're bound to
find mostly screaming families with sobbing
toddlers or über-enthusiastic tourists on any
given day at the Disneyland resort, but cou
ples of every age flock to sunny Anaheim for
the nostalgia. .Although Rox doesn't really
see what's so romantic about feeding your
significant other a gigantic greasy turkey
drumstick or a Mickey Mouse-shaped pret
zel, she adheres to the philosophy "Don't
knock it until you try it." A girl can't com
plain about a guy who's willing to shell out
$3.00 fora measly ice cream sandwich in ad
dition to those $50 admission tickets.
For those of you yet uninitiated into the
rites of all things Disney, there are now two
adjacent parks in the resort — Disneyland
(the original, which opened in 1955) and the
newer California Adventure. Downtown
Disney is located between their entrances,
with plenty of dining, shopping and yes, the

words that strike the fear into any self-re
specting male ... Build-A-Bear.
"When you're curious, you find lots of in
teresting things to do. And one thing it takes
to accomplish something is courage."
It 11 only take a little bit of courage to fig-

ure out exactly why Dis
neyland is known as "The
Happiest Place on Earth."
The Haunted Mansion:
" D<x)mbuggies" transport
couples through this cob
web-infested ride, much of
which takes place in semi
darkness. Lest you think
you're alone, remember
that there are hidden secu
rity cameras galore as you
make your way through
this ghostly haunt. Goths
and those into the macabre
enjoy making out while ac
companied by "hitchhik
ing ghosts." A cast member
once stopped the ride to
ask a guest to pull his pants
back up while his girl-

friend emerged from the floor of their
Doombuggy. Yikes.
Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse statue:
Located between the Plaza Inn and Carna
tion Gardens, this is a must-see. If you ap
proach the statue from Main Street and veer
to the left, Walt appears to be very happy in
deed, thanks to the protrusion that Mickey's

nose makes at precisely the right height. In
tentional or accidental? We'll never know,
but that doesn't stop us from giggling like
seventh graders in sex ed.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Roxy suggests
hopping on tliis watery ride midday when the

/ # /
scorching heat isn't doing
much for your libido or later
at night when everyone and
their mom is watching "Fan
tasmic!" Request a private
boat for you and your good
friend(s); chances are the
bored ride operators will
grant you your wish if there
isn't a line. Even better is hav
ing a boat to yourself plus the
added privacy of being sur
rounded by empty boats in
front and back of you. Just be
cause the ride allows you the
"cover" of fog and mist
doesn't mean that ride oper
ators can't see you
canoodling as the ships bomb
each other. Pirate's booty is
the best booty, but be careful

not to bump your head as your boat plunges
down two small waterfalls at the beginning of
the ride. Sure, the long bench seat allows fora
variety of seaworthy positions, but don't get it
on unless you're prepared to disembark to the
applause of cast members, who may hand you
paper towels as well. "Dead men tell no tales,"
but you'll have plenty to tell after this voyage.

The Matterhorn: Seating on this ride is a
little more intimate than most, with four rid
ers to a car, seated in pairs (one person re
clining against the other). The track on the
left side of the mountain is a little wilder, so if
you like a challenge, go for it. Roxy will leave
the rest to your imagination, but be sure to
wave hello to the Abominable Snowman.
Goofy's Bounce House: You'll find this
kiddie-infested attraction in Mickey's Toon
town. Basically a house made of brightly col
ored mattresses and sproingy furniture,
Goofy s Bounce House gives you extra cush
ioning that you won't find on the rides. Just
think twice before engaging in tonsil hockey
— you might get smacked into by a ram
bunctious toddler.
Splash Mountain: Perhaps it's just me,
but the lyrics to "Zipp-A-Dee-Doo-Dah" are
just a tad suggestive. Sure, I can never re
member more than "Zip-a-dee-doo-dah,
Zip-a-dee-ay! My oh my, what a wonderful
day!'" It's more than wonderful dav when
this ride is transformed into Flash Mountain
as women bare a little more than their smiles
for the camera that snaps a photo as your log
plunges down the waterfall.
So what are you waiting for? Disneyland's
50th anniversary? That's next year, so hurry
up and relive the magic before it's time to go
back to school. You'll find there are plenty
more perks to the park now that you're not
seven anymore. "The way to get started is to
quit talking and begin doing," Walt Disney
once said. Roxy couldn't agree more.

ing a boat to yourself plus the
added privacy of being sur
rounded by empty boats in
front and back of you. Just be
cause the ride allows you the
"cover" of fog and mist
doesn't mean that ride oper
ators can't see you
canoodling as the ships bomb
each other. Pirate's booty is
the best booty, but be careful

not to bump your head as your boat plunges
down two small waterfalls at the beginning of
the ride. Sure, the long bench seat allows fora
variety of seaworthy positions, but don't get it
on unless you're prepared to disembark to the
applause of cast members, who may hand you
paper towels as well. "Dead men tell no tales,"
but you'll have plenty to tell after this voyage.

The Matterhorn: Seating on this ride is a
little more intimate than most, with four rid
ers to a car, seated in pairs (one person re
clining against the other). The track on the
left side of the mountain is a little wilder, so if
you like a challenge, go for it. Roxy will leave
the rest to your imagination, but be sure to
wave hello to the Abominable Snowman.
Goofy's Bounce House: You'll find this
kiddie-infested attraction in Mickey's Toon
town. Basically a house made of brightly col
ored mattresses and sproingy furniture,
Goofy s Bounce House gives you extra cush
ioning that you won't find on the rides. Just
think twice before engaging in tonsil hockey
— you might get smacked into by a ram
bunctious toddler.
Splash Mountain: Perhaps it's just me,
but the lyrics to "Zipp-A-Dee-Doo-Dah" are
just a tad suggestive. Sure, I can never re
member more than "Zip-a-dee-doo-dah,
Zip-a-dee-ay! My oh my, what a wonderful
day!'" It's more than wonderful dav when
this ride is transformed into Flash Mountain
as women bare a little more than their smiles
for the camera that snaps a photo as your log
plunges down the waterfall.
So what are you waiting for? Disneyland's
50th anniversary? That's next year, so hurry
up and relive the magic before it's time to go
back to school. You'll find there are plenty
more perks to the park now that you're not
seven anymore. "The way to get started is to
quit talking and begin doing," Walt Disney
once said. Roxy couldn't agree more.

"Whenever / go on a ride, I'm always thinking
of what's wrong with the thing and how it ran
be improved."
— Walt Disney
Roxy decided to head to "The Happiest
Place on Earth" (TM) after agreeing with
such encouraging quotes by the head
Mouseketeer himself, Mr. Disney (although
Walt probably wasn't talking about Roxy's
favorite kind of ride, the one that doesn't re
quire tracks or a motor). You're bound to
find mostly screaming families with sobbing
toddlers or über-enthusiastic tourists on any
given day at the Disneyland resort, but cou
ples of every age flock to sunny Anaheim for
the nostalgia. .Although Rox doesn't really
see what's so romantic about feeding your
significant other a gigantic greasy turkey
drumstick or a Mickey Mouse-shaped pret
zel, she adheres to the philosophy "Don't
knock it until you try it." A girl can't com
plain about a guy who's willing to shell out
$3.00 fora measly ice cream sandwich in ad
dition to those $50 admission tickets.
For those of you yet uninitiated into the
rites of all things Disney, there are now two
adjacent parks in the resort — Disneyland
(the original, which opened in 1955) and the
newer California Adventure. Downtown
Disney is located between their entrances,
with plenty of dining, shopping and yes, the

words that strike the fear into any self-re
specting male ... Build-A-Bear.
"When you're curious, you find lots of in
teresting things to do. And one thing it takes
to accomplish something is courage."
It 11 only take a little bit of courage to fig-

ure out exactly why Dis
neyland is known as "The
Happiest Place on Earth."
The Haunted Mansion:
" D<x)mbuggies" transport
couples through this cob
web-infested ride, much of
which takes place in semi
darkness. Lest you think
you're alone, remember
that there are hidden secu
rity cameras galore as you
make your way through
this ghostly haunt. Goths
and those into the macabre
enjoy making out while ac
companied by "hitchhik
ing ghosts." A cast member
once stopped the ride to
ask a guest to pull his pants
back up while his girl-

friend emerged from the floor of their
Doombuggy. Yikes.
Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse statue:
Located between the Plaza Inn and Carna
tion Gardens, this is a must-see. If you ap
proach the statue from Main Street and veer
to the left, Walt appears to be very happy in
deed, thanks to the protrusion that Mickey's

nose makes at precisely the right height. In
tentional or accidental? We'll never know,
but that doesn't stop us from giggling like
seventh graders in sex ed.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Roxy suggests
hopping on tliis watery ride midday when the

/ # /
scorching heat isn't doing
much for your libido or later
at night when everyone and
their mom is watching "Fan
tasmic!" Request a private
boat for you and your good
friend(s); chances are the
bored ride operators will
grant you your wish if there
isn't a line. Even better is hav
ing a boat to yourself plus the
added privacy of being sur
rounded by empty boats in
front and back of you. Just be
cause the ride allows you the
