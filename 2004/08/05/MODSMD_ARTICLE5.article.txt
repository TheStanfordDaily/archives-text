### SARAH RIZK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Executive Director of Stanford
Dining Services Nadeem Siddiqui re
cently resigned from his position. On
Aug. 13, Rati Taherian, who is cur
rently the associate director of Stan
ford Dining, will assume Siddiqui's
role as the acting executive director.
Students praised Siddiqui's
work, citing the several large pro
jects he took on, such as the
Tresidder renovation and the
Linx project. He is also highly re
garded for striving to increase the
dining options available to stu
dents around campus.
Siddiqui will be moving to Madi
son, Wis., where his wife currently
lives. He is uncertain of his future ca
reer, but fie will miss Stanford.
"Stanford is really one of the best
places I've worked," Siddiqui said.
"The faculty is amazing, and the stu
dents are just incredible."
Siddiqui, who previously worked
in dining services at die University of
Chicago and more recently at Cor
nell University, added that Stanford
was exceptionally accepting.
"The first day you're part of

Stanford, whether you're faculty or
student," Siddiqui said. "That
doesn't exist in other places."
While he has been at Stanford,
Siddiqui has focused on altering to

students' needs.
Students who
knew him felt he was
easy to approach.
One such student
said, "He knows that
meals are a very im
portant part of the res
idential experience
here at Stanford, and
as a result he works
tirelessly to ensure
that students are
happy and healthy...
He was truly dedicat
ed to the students'
needs during his time
here at Stanford."
Siddiqui has wit
nessed several changes

in student's dining needs while at
Stanford. One major trend has been
an increase in the number of vegan
and vegetarian students, which he
now estimates is 10 to 15 percent of
the student population. Siddiqui
noted diat at manv other schools, the

vegetarian options are limited and
bland, which in turn discourages stu
dents from this dietary option. At
Stanford, Siddiqui has tried to intro
duce flavorful vegetarian dishes,
which he believes encourage students

to explore their options. Additionally,
there has been a push for more
healthy food and organic: ingredients.
In response to this, there is now and
organic "fanner's market" every Fri-
