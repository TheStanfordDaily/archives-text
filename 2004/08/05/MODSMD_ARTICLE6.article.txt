# Harvard grads face off against the facebook.com
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Thefacebook.com is nearing 200,000 registered users at 37 schools. The
social networking site plans to expand to 200 schools by the end of the sum
mer. ITie Web site's success has been featured in The New York Times, The
Washington Post and numerous other publications.
But there is one thorn in creator Mark Zuckerberg's side. The rising
Harvard College junior is being accused of stealing the Facebook idea
while writing the code fora comparable site by Harvard Class 0f2004 grad
uates Cameron Winklevoss, Divya Narendra and Tyler Winklevoss.
Iliey claim that they asked Zuckerberg to develop part of their Connec
tU.com Web site in November of last year. According to Tyler Winkelvoss,
Zuckerberg then proceeded to develop his own site based on their ideas.
Zuckerberg communicated with the ConnectU.com team through 52 e-mail
messages and three personal meetings, which Winkelvoss has records of.
Zuckerberg, on die other hand, claims that he voluntarily agreed to do six
hours of coding for the ConnectU.com site, but he understood it to be a
"personals" site to connect students with alumni and employers.
"I never really understood their product, but it was not a social net
working site," Zuckerberg said.
Winkelvoss insists that Zuckerberg is using ignorance as an excuse.
"It was clear to him what we wanted," Winkelvoss said. "He stalled us
for months while he worked on his own idea, which he launched in Feb
ruary as an original idea."
In fact, Zuckerberg claims that, if anything, the ConnectU.com ere-
ators stole ideas from his site, which went up
at the end of May. The only similarities be
tween the two sites were that people regis
tered and put up information about them
selves that could be used professionally or for
dating purposes.
But the social networking, messaging, "pok
ing" and common course listings functions that
are on the current ConnectU.com site were all
borrowed from thefecebook.com, according to
Zuckerberg.
"Mark has screen shots of the site when he
was working on a part of it, and it is very
much unlike thefacebook.com," said rising
Harvard junior Chris Hughes, spokesperson
for thefacebook.com.
When he was working on their site, it was
called Harvard Connection.com, which
Zuckerberg uses as evidence that their site was
never meant to connect students from differ
ent schools.
"The site looked completely different when
I worked on it," Zuckerberg said.
But Winkelvoss says that their site was
always meant to be an online community
for students that would be rolled out to
other schools.
"Our site was meant to connect students to
alumni, businesses and other students,"
Winkelvoss said. "[Zuckerberg] will say it other

ways, but it's all the same."
The CbnnectU.com creators attempted to
force the Harvard administration to act on
what they viewed as a violation of the universi
ty's honor code. ITiey took the case to the Har
vard Administrative Board and the university
president, but it was ruled to be outside of uni
versity jurisdiction.
The creators don't plan to take the dispute
any further.
"We're not focused on the legal avenue at
this time," Winkelvoss said. "We will continue
to develop our product and let die facts speak
for themselves."
ConnectU.com currendy has 1,660 regis
tered users and is growing five to 10 percent
per day. Winkelvoss boasted the site's cleaner
layout and book exchange, blog and chat func
tions in comparison to thefacebook.com. He
described ConnectU.com as an online meet
ing tool versus thefacebook.com as an online
directory tool.
Meanwhile, Zuckerberg is residing in Palo
Alto area for the summer and possibly the fall.
His team has started selling ads on the site to
cover the costs, which have grown to $3,000
per month. "A handful of people" have ex
pressed interest in buying thefecebook.com,
but Zuckerberg insists that there are no plans to
sell itonlv expand.
"We're just having a good time," Zucker
berg said.
Students can also expect a new version
of thefacebook.com, to be launched in
mid-August.
