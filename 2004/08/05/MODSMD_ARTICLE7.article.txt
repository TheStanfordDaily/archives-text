# Fire, sparked by tractor, burns six acres at Dish
## 
### 
An attempt to prevent fires in the Stanford foothills
was, ironically, the cause of one last week. According to
the Stanford Fire Station, a tractor mower hit a rock,
causing a spark that ignited a small fire near the Dish.
The tractor mower's operator was attempting to establish
a firebreak in case of a possible wildfire.
The fire was seen by a few Stanford tour guides before
a gate guard called it in around 11:05 a.m. The Palo Alto
Fire Department and California Department of Forestry
soon arrived and had the fire easily contained and extin
guished by 11:45 a.m.
"There was no wind, which was very lucky," said As
sociate Director of News Services Jack Hubbard. "[The
firemen] really tackled it."
The fire managed to burn six acres near the popular
walking and jogging spot, according to Hubbard. The
trail was temporarily closed, but only briefly. It was re
opened to the public after the burned shrubbery was
cleared away around 12:30 p.m.
There has not been a large fire in the Stanford
foothills in the last decade, but the University is aware of
the hot conditions during the dry season. There is even a
fire station located at Foothills Park, which operates sole
ly during the fire season.
"We're always watching for that... as it can move
pretty quickly," Hubbard said, regarding area fires dur
ing the summer.
