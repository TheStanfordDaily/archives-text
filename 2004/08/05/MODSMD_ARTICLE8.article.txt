## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
Chest up, stomach in. Lotus,
cobra, bow and arrow. Seemingly
just the commands given in yet an
other yoga class fora generation in
fatuated with the 5,000 year old ex
ercise. Yoga A'sanas, however, sets
itself apart at Stanford, due largely
to its enthusiastic instructor.
Not connected to the classes given
by Nanci Conniff and other Stanford
faculty, Yoga A'sanas aims to control
emotions, balance the endocrine sys
tem and revitalize the nervous sys
tem. It theorizes that the slow move
ments made place pressure on en
docrine glands, causing them to se
crete hormones to calm and balance
the body. The A'sanas, or postures,
also claim to cure hysteria, liver dis
eases and to remove wrinkles.
To practice this form of yoga, cre
ated by die yogis in India who were
inspired by the movements of jungle
animals, A'sanas also recommends
complete fasting and that the left
nostril be open.
Instructor Dasarathi Raghunath
is as unique as the form of yoga he

teaches. Believing every word of the
power of yoga, and even more im
pressively striving to spread it
through dozens of flyers, pamphlets
and books, Raghunath has decided
to offer a free class. Raghunath ad
mits that while some may not fully
comprehend the benefits of A'sanas,
"Someday, it will hit them".
"Most people only use 50 percent
of their lungs," Raghunath said. His
form of teaching emphasizes di
aphragmatic breathing to use full lung
capacity. Using unique metaphors to
represent the levels of the mind and
setting commandments for harmony,
Raghunath also hopes to "bring in all
aspects, physical and mental, in a
body-mind connection."
Though the class is small in com
parison to the hoards of students
signing up for yoga during the fall,
winter and spring quarters, its atten
dees, including business student
Mike Kokalari, still looks forward to
the one hour class offered ever) Fri
day at 6 p.m. in Roble gym.
"I had a very gtxxl experience
from all these classes," said Kokalari.
who will be heading for three weeks
of intensive workout later this month.

Raghunath opened this class
with a Kaoshiki dance to wann up.
Originally meant for women to es
tablish a link with supreme con
sciousness, both men and women
now take part in the 18-step dance.
Done to the beats of a chant playing
on a small stereo, the dance pro
gressively got faster — until Raghu
nath was the only one left; standing,
leaving his students giggling.
ITie group then spread out and
die teacher led his students in poses
ranging from the easy to the incredi
bly hard. While some students easily
did the poses — which included
bending the body upwards over 180
degrees in the bow pose, and the
shoulderstand, in which the body's
weight rests on the shoulders — and
others grunted, Raghunath was
eventually the last one standing again.
Teaching ever since he studied
the form under Shrii Shrii Ananda
Murti in 1978, Raghunath has trav
eled the world teaching yoga. His be
lief only became stronger when he
became sick and turned to yoga, only
to have his health improve. In 1986
