## WEST OF CENTER Three cheers for unilateral moves in the Middle East: Toward peace, without trust 
### 
Imminent peace between Israel and Palestine? You
heard it here first. When Oslo and Bill Clinton's peace
initiative failed, both sides concluded diat they could
not negotiate their way to peace. This may be the foun
dation fora good thing.
Ironically, suicide bombings and advancing settlements
only make sense within die negotiating framework: Each side
is trying to make conflict cosdy so the other side will make more
concessions. With the negotiating framework cast aside, and
facing die prospect of indefinite intifada, each party is not sole
ly focused on improving its position relative to the other, but
also on making its own lot more livable in the meantime.
Through unilateral steps, based on die assumption of mistrust
and continued conflict rather than negotiation and eventual
setdement, we're beginning to see the outlines of peace.
According to die conventional account, the immediate

problem for the Israelis is that there is
no effective and responsible Palestinian
government. Suicide bombers, gun
runners and bomb makers are not
stopped by Palestinian security services
— when they are not themselves the se
curity services. If Palestinians will not
police the Palestinian areas, the reason
ing goes, Israel will have to do the best
it can, crushing Palestinian militants
with a heavy hand.
For the Palestinians, the conven-

tional account continues, the immediate problem is Israeli in
terference in Palestinian areas. Encroaching settlements and
associated security measures rob them of their land; closures
or day-long waits at checkpoints rob them of their livelihood;
and helicopter assassinations rob them of their lives. Pales
tinians must therefore do all they can to resist the occupation
and make it cosdy, forcing an Israeli withdrawal.
Within this conventional framework, coercing the
enemy was the focus. Now the focus has shifted to include
unilateral steps. Instead of asking, "What does the other side
do that makes us miserable and how can we make them stop
it?", each side now concludes, "Indefinite intifada is a fact and
we cannot trust those who seek only our destruction. What
can we do unilaterally to make our lot more bearable?" The
answer, it seems, is a lot: Israel sees that the intrusive occupa
tion is costing them, and is starting to withdraw; Palestinians
see that mismanagement causes insecurity and economic
pain, and they are starting to reform.
The model seems to be Gaza. A security fence, like the
more-controversial one Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon
is building through the West Bank, already exists to sepa
rate Gaza from Israel. Against the will of the far-right par
ties he has traditionally bowed to, Sharon recently decided
to withdraw Israeli setdements and military presence from
the Gaza strip, leaving it entirely in Palestinian hands by the
end of next year. Facing the demographic reality that the
Palestinian population is growing faster than Israel's,
Sharon is scrambling to set up a Palestinian state with its
own borders before Israelis are outnumbered within the
territories they occupy.
A security fence separating the West Bank from Israel is the
clear next step — though its route is, to say the least, problem
atic. If Israel forms a national-unity government, as Sharon
seeks, there will be more political freedom to remove more set
tlements. A withdrawal to the 1967 border is unlikely, but build
ing along the Bill Clinton borders, rather than dividing up
Palestine into closed enclaves separated by walls and check

points, is essentia] to any sustainable plan. Though lor religious
reasons Sharon probably cannot say so, a successful military
withdrawal from Gaza will be followed by military withdrawal
from the West Bank.
On the other side of die fence in Gaza, we see even more
surprising and exciting developments. A1 Mubadara, or the
Palestinian National Initiative, is a grassroots organization de
manding democracy in Palestinian self-rule areas. Their suc
cesses have been resounding: In recent trade union elections
— the few elections that still take place in Gaza —A1
Mubadara won surprising successes fora new political move
ment. In one union Fatah and Hamas even joined forces to
prevent A1 Mubadara from gaining an outright majority.
Part of the Olso process was elections fora Palestinian
parliament. There have long been demands to make these
elections regular, rather than a one-time affair. There has like
wise been pressure to unify the security forces, rather than die
scattered and conflicting militias that Arafat plays against each
other to maintain his rule. There has been pressure for anti
corruption measures — the Gaza police chief was recently
seized by militants who demanded he be put on trial — and
for the rule of law. There has been pressure to account for die
millions of dollars in EU aid that Arafat apparently squan
dered. There has been pressure to cede real power to the par
liament and prime minister. But it looks like this pressure is
approaching a tipping point: Popular outrage with Arafat's
misrule is at a peak, and for the first time there is a new alter
native available.
Think how the map would be reshaped if these two
processes simply carry to their natural conclusions over
the next two years. A democratic, transparent govern
ment in the Palestinian areas, spending aid to better the
welfare of its inhabitants and enforcing the rule of law
with a unified, uniformed security service; Israeli settle
ments dismantled and the military pulled back behind a
security wall — built along a viable interim border that al
lows Palestinians freedom of movement and economic se
curity within their own territory.
This looks a lot like a resolution of the seemingly in
tractable problems earlier: The difference is instead of Israel
trying to secure in the territories and Palestinians trying to
end die occupation, die roles are reversed.
Of course, this non-negotiated peace does not resolve
many problems: the Clinton borders, 1967 or something else;
of East Jerusalem; of water rights; of die status of Palestinian
refugees, among others. The colonial powers did an original
injustice by actively exterminating the jews or passively allow
ing it to happen, and dien carving up die Arabian peninsula
to make it up to them. In die sense that so much injustice has
been irremediably inflicted upon both sides, there will not be
a just solution.
But three generations in, die conflict itself is more costly
than anything either side is likely to gain by its continuation.
Palestinians may say diat accepting peace without resolution of
East Jerusalem is like the United States turning New York over
to al Qaida in return fora truce, and Israelis may call with
drawal from die West Bank akin to giving California back to
Mexico. Perhaps. In die Middle East today, injustice is reality,
but indefinite war need not be. ITie ongoing military cam
paign has not brought either side any closer to dieir goals. It is
time fora new strategy, and botii sides get it Now diat negoti
ation has collapsed in mistrust, we're starting to see unilateral
peacemaking on bodi sides.
