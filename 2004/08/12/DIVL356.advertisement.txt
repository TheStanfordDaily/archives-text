Back when 13 million horses ruled the road, and Palo Alto had a population of 18,
Governor Stanford's Big Red Barn was already standing.
He built eight more like it to house his champion horses and experiment with breeding and his
innovative training methods. He had an unorthodox approach of "calling forth the best natural
qualities of an animal by kindness and encouragement." His horses were, "never touched by a whip.
For 125 years this classic Victorian beauty has been the location of annual Red Barn festivals.
These colorful events feature the best equestrian skills and performances.
Come celebrate this fun filled day on the farm. It's a part of our community legacy that
the whole family will enjoy. Proceeds will help preserve this important symbol of our heritage.
