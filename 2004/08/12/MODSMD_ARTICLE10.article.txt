## Examining 9/11 nostalgia 
### ROBERT ZELNICK 
I have lived in Boston for five years now, so i know it
can't be the water. Or the dust from the Big Dig. Or even
the curse of the Bambino. No, it must be something en
demic to political conventions. The Republicans will hold
theirs soon enough, presumably providing fodder of
their own for observers like me, so let me deal with the
departed Democrats.
I have a title for their folly. 1 call it "9 / 11 Nos
talgia." No, I,m not suggesting the Democrats were
any less affected than most of the civilized world by
the horror of the event. But in its aftermath — the
worldwide expressions of shock, the empathy of the
French, the solidarity of the Alliance, the coming to
gether of the country — the Democrats found a mo
ment that could somehow have been bottled, pre
served for the future as the United States chartered
a course against worldwide terrorism. The presump
tion was that a John Kennedy or Harry Truman
could have set such a course for others to follow just
as they did in the ("old War against communism. And
from Jimmy Carter to Barak Obama to Joseph Biden
to Max Cleland, the convention theme was shame on
George W. Bush for squandering that moment.
Shame on Bush for letting the French and Germans
slip away. Shame on Bush for not racing toward in
dependence from Mideast oil, so, as John Kerry says,
no American soldier will ever again have to die in a
war for oil.
\\ hat a naive misreading of postwar history and of re
cent events. Let us take the French, for example. Saved
twice by American intervention and drawn into a com
mon NATO defense, the French still sought to lessen
American influence by developing their own nuclear de
terrent, strengthening their entente with Germany and
forging their own relations in the Third World.
I he Cold War years seem rosy only in hindsight. In
fact, much of the world chose not to follow the United
States' lead. Certainly the People's Republic of China
didn't. Nor did India, at least in foreign policy. Emerging
African and Asian nations generally chose neutrality. Arab
powers like Egypt and Syria looked to the Soviets for help
against Israel, at least until they had lost four wars.
At international meetings in those years one en
countered a long list of grievances against Washing
ton: coups in Iran, Guatemala and Chile; efforts to
overthrow Castro; support for reactionary tyrants
around the world. Even the Reagan military build-up,
which finally tipped the scales, drew widespread al
liance opposition.
Let us face facts: Those who accepted U.S. leader
ship did so because they did not wish to be overrun by
communist neighbors. Now that threat has passed, and
the L nited States stands as the world's sole superpower
or as the trench say, "hyper-power". Therefore, it is in
the interest of most nations to check Washington's in
fluence. This is the situation that confronted Bush when
he sought allies to fight with the United States in Iraq.
It will confront Kerry or Bush again in the next admin
istration and their successors in administrations beyond
that. All will have to determine what steps are in the
vital U.S. interests with little certainty of military help
from traditional allies.
