## A
						contest that fleshes out inner, not outer, beauty 
### PATRICK MATTIMORE 
Over the years, feminist critics as well as many others have
decried the media's glorification of an unrealistic body image
for women. One of the critics' more visible targets has been the
staging of local, national and international beauty pageants.
Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned about a different kind
of pulchritude from the Mayans.
At 12:50 a.m. this past Sunday morning, Maria de Leon
became Rabin Ajau, the indigenous queen of Guatemala. Al
though nominally a beauty contest, many of the trappings
Americans associate with such an important event were miss
ing. The gymnasium in the city of Coban where the compe
tition was held was only about two-thirds full. Only one
Guatemala national daily newspaper bothered to report the
event Monday. And swimsuits were definitely not the order
of the day.
It is not surprising that after a 36-year-long civil war
which ended in 1996 and in which the indigenous people of
Guatemala were systematically targeted for extinction, that
even a seemingly frivolous event like a beauty pageant has
celebratory undertones, mixing messages of cultural pride
and survival.
DeLeon was chosen from among 66 contestants ranging
in age from approximately 14 to 20. She was selected, not for
her curves and sway, but for her forceful speech and poise.
The ten finalists were subjected to a grueling rhetorical exer
cise in which they spoke for up to 12 minutes, first in their na
tive dialect and subsequently in Spanish, about a topic of na
tional significance. In addition, the young women were ex
temporaneously grilled by a panel of judges. None of the
women could rely on flashes of flesh as they were all dressed
in traditional Mayan clothing.
Through an interpreter, 17-year-old deLeon told me that
she would like to use her crown as a means to promote in
digenous traditions within Guatemala. She intends to enlist
the other "queens" in order that those "seeds will grow." Al
though the theme of her public address emphasized violence
against women in general, de Leon said that she would like
people in the United States to know that there is a great deal
more to Guatemala than its singularly violent image. She has
been invited by an indigenous group in Miami to visit the
United States and intends to do so later this year.
The first runner-up, Rutila Ajanel, is a 19-year-old busi
ness student at a university near her home in Quetzaltenan
go. Ajanel believes that pervasive discrimination against the
indigenous majority in Guatemala has kept many of her peo
ple from achieving very much. She cites as a notable excep
tion her heroine, Rigoberta Menchu, a Nobel Prize winning
author, who has risen above many of the constraints placed
upon indigenous women.
DeLeon and Ajanel concurred that it is important to
maintain a multi-lingual tradition in Guatemala since Span
ish is obviously not the first or primary language of indige
nous peoples. The most impressive folkloric festival of Mayan
traditions concluded Sunday afternoon with a variety of spir
itual dances.
