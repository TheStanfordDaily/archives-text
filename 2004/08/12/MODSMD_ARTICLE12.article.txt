## Exploring the complex, imperfect and necessary policy of affirmative action in America 
### CHRISTOPHER R. VAUGHAN 
A column on affirmative action by a Hoover Insti
tution fellow raises the eyebrows of us affirmed de
fenders of the policy. A first worry with such an article
is that affirmative action will be smeared or ridiculed.
It has happened before: Logic and fairness get
chucked out the window, reductionism blasts in, and
affirmative action mockers get fed new rally lines. So
I was heartened to see that Robert Zelnick in last
month's "Confronting affirmative action" did not at
tack the policy. But he didn't approve of it either, and
some of his slipshod assertions risk becoming anti-af
firmative action fodder of their own. I will address
some of his points here.
Zelnick discusses the Supreme Court's Grutter
case from last June, refers to the Bakke ruling of 1978,
analyzes the Texas "10-percent plan," ruminates on
classroom "diversity," expresses his theoretical opposi
tion to affirmative action, and makes a general policy
prescription. It is a feat that Zelnick does all this in six
paragraphs, and it is even more of a feat that he does it
without stumbling too often. Most of the problems,
however, crop up in the fifth paragraph of the column.
Here, Zelnick boils affirmative action down to the
benefits students might receive in an integrated class
room. Even allowing the author his application of eco
nomic theory to classroom dynamics, which seems a
dubious thought process in itself, one can still take on
his central claim that diversity is "subject to diminish
ing returns." Zelnick writes: "The first African Ameri
can in a history or political science course arguably
could bring important perspectives to bear on many
subjects. But what about the second? Or the 17th? And
suppose the course were biology? Or chemical engi
neering? Or medicine?"
First, the students furnished by any affirmative ac
tion program worth its salt won't "arguably" make
contributions. They will make contributions. And
"perspectives" won't be the only kind of knowledge
they provide. In a history class, it will be history. In bi
ology, biology. Zelnick flirts with the falsity that holds
that the academic worth of affirmative action benefi
ciaries ends at their blackness, or Asian-ness.
What about that second African American in class,
anyway? Zelnick's simplistic question demands the
same in return: Does the author really believe there ex
ists but one black perspective? An affirmative answer
would find its parochial match in the view that the bi
ology, chemical engineering and medicine disciplines
float along in the pure skies of objectivity. As a Stanford
acquaintance of mine would retort, "All sciences are so
cial sciences" — subjective, and therefore dependent
in their practice on the impulses of their practitioners.
In the 19th century, Samuel George Morton dis
pensed with accuracy to "prove" his racist hypotheses
on cranial capacity and intelligence — and he was a
physician. In the 19205, Carnegie- and Rockefeller
funded doctors sterilized Blacks, immigrants and
other "degenerates" in a grand eugenic plan that

Hitler later ted upon. And in recent decades, some bi
ologists have justified their homophobia and social
Darwinism with their genetics research. These are ex
treme examples, but a watchful student will find the
seeds of this subjectivity spread throughout all fields.
Zelnick is right to quibble with the term "diversity."
But heavy usage has rendered it only as vague as the ad
missions processes themselves. Every consideration or
preference — geography, legacy, athleticism, test ac
complishments — is subject to debate. Stanford, like all
schools, isn't quite fair, or representative or disinterest
ed in its acceptance process. We can conclude only that
the University will accept, in a general sense, whomev
er it wishes to accept and that it will adapt its admissions
processes accordingly. Unclear activity begets unclear
language. As to affirmative action, I would personally
ch(X)se a stricter concept like "fair representation."
Semantics aside, Zelnick should bear in mind that
affirmative action was originally adopted not to "diver
sify" and deepen classroom discussions, but to repair
injustice. Blacks — and it was, at first, just blacks under
consideration — had not only suffered the disempow
erment of slavery and Jim Crow, but had been patent
ly excluded from higher education for centuries. Affir
mative action sought to give a nudge through a door
that had long remained shut. The United States of
2004 is a better nation than that of 1964 or of 1904, but
it is a nation still grappling with the legacy of past op
pression (also present, but widely overlooked, is pre
sent-day discrimination, which I won't go into here).
When it comes to affirmative action policies, I urge
criticism, not categorical rejection. Once one sees that
the creative forces behind admissions policies are noth
ing more than political machinations and the weighing
of conflicting interests, one is moved to tinker with these
policies, not abandon them. As a piece of public policy,
affirmative action is no different from, and no more
perfect than, food stamps and gas taxes and zoning
laws. Affirmative action does little for members of racial
sub-groups (What a large category is ".Asian American,"
after all) and little for poor people of any color. Further,
as Zelnick points out, a proxy scheme like Texas' "10-
percent plan" makes for bad policy in the long run, cer
tainly, and maybe also in the short run.
"As a matter of principle," Zelnick writes, "I con
tinue to oppose the allocation of rights and rewards
based on race." Obviously enough, Zelnick would
then oppose slavery and Jim Crow. A last question for
the author: What can society, or at least the universi
ty admissions corner of society, do to repair the in
equities wrought by those evil institutions? Zelnick's
might first think of the distinction between race con
sideration as a wide-scale oppression of minorities,
and race consideration as a small-scale access-granti
ng nudge. I cannot emphasize it enough: Affirmative
action is not just white racism the other way around.
With that in mind, Zelnick will take up rather the
right path in "confronting" these policies.

tion program worth its salt won't "arguably" make
contributions. They will make contributions. And
"perspectives" won't be the only kind of knowledge
they provide. In a history class, it will be history. In bi
ology, biology. Zelnick flirts with the falsity that holds
that the academic worth of affirmative action benefi
ciaries ends at their blackness, or Asian-ness.
What about that second African American in class,
anyway? Zelnick's simplistic question demands the
same in return: Does the author really believe there ex
ists but one black perspective? An affirmative answer
would find its parochial match in the view that the bi
ology, chemical engineering and medicine disciplines
float along in the pure skies of objectivity. As a Stanford
acquaintance of mine would retort, "All sciences are so
cial sciences" — subjective, and therefore dependent
in their practice on the impulses of their practitioners.
In the 19th century, Samuel George Morton dis
pensed with accuracy to "prove" his racist hypotheses
on cranial capacity and intelligence — and he was a
physician. In the 19205, Carnegie- and Rockefeller
funded doctors sterilized Blacks, immigrants and
other "degenerates" in a grand eugenic plan that

Hitler later ted upon. And in recent decades, some bi
ologists have justified their homophobia and social
Darwinism with their genetics research. These are ex
treme examples, but a watchful student will find the
seeds of this subjectivity spread throughout all fields.
Zelnick is right to quibble with the term "diversity."
But heavy usage has rendered it only as vague as the ad
missions processes themselves. Every consideration or
preference — geography, legacy, athleticism, test ac
complishments — is subject to debate. Stanford, like all
schools, isn't quite fair, or representative or disinterest
ed in its acceptance process. We can conclude only that
the University will accept, in a general sense, whomev
er it wishes to accept and that it will adapt its admissions
processes accordingly. Unclear activity begets unclear
language. As to affirmative action, I would personally
ch(X)se a stricter concept like "fair representation."
Semantics aside, Zelnick should bear in mind that
affirmative action was originally adopted not to "diver
sify" and deepen classroom discussions, but to repair
injustice. Blacks — and it was, at first, just blacks under
consideration — had not only suffered the disempow
erment of slavery and Jim Crow, but had been patent
ly excluded from higher education for centuries. Affir
mative action sought to give a nudge through a door
that had long remained shut. The United States of
2004 is a better nation than that of 1964 or of 1904, but
it is a nation still grappling with the legacy of past op
pression (also present, but widely overlooked, is pre
sent-day discrimination, which I won't go into here).
When it comes to affirmative action policies, I urge
criticism, not categorical rejection. Once one sees that
the creative forces behind admissions policies are noth
ing more than political machinations and the weighing
of conflicting interests, one is moved to tinker with these
policies, not abandon them. As a piece of public policy,
affirmative action is no different from, and no more
perfect than, food stamps and gas taxes and zoning
laws. Affirmative action does little for members of racial
sub-groups (What a large category is ".Asian American,"
after all) and little for poor people of any color. Further,
as Zelnick points out, a proxy scheme like Texas' "10-
percent plan" makes for bad policy in the long run, cer
tainly, and maybe also in the short run.
"As a matter of principle," Zelnick writes, "I con
tinue to oppose the allocation of rights and rewards
based on race." Obviously enough, Zelnick would
then oppose slavery and Jim Crow. A last question for
the author: What can society, or at least the universi
ty admissions corner of society, do to repair the in
equities wrought by those evil institutions? Zelnick's
might first think of the distinction between race con
sideration as a wide-scale oppression of minorities,
and race consideration as a small-scale access-granti
ng nudge. I cannot emphasize it enough: Affirmative
action is not just white racism the other way around.
With that in mind, Zelnick will take up rather the
right path in "confronting" these policies.

A column on affirmative action by a Hoover Insti
tution fellow raises the eyebrows of us affirmed de
fenders of the policy. A first worry with such an article
is that affirmative action will be smeared or ridiculed.
It has happened before: Logic and fairness get
chucked out the window, reductionism blasts in, and
affirmative action mockers get fed new rally lines. So
I was heartened to see that Robert Zelnick in last
month's "Confronting affirmative action" did not at
tack the policy. But he didn't approve of it either, and
some of his slipshod assertions risk becoming anti-af
firmative action fodder of their own. I will address
some of his points here.
Zelnick discusses the Supreme Court's Grutter
case from last June, refers to the Bakke ruling of 1978,
analyzes the Texas "10-percent plan," ruminates on
classroom "diversity," expresses his theoretical opposi
tion to affirmative action, and makes a general policy
prescription. It is a feat that Zelnick does all this in six
paragraphs, and it is even more of a feat that he does it
without stumbling too often. Most of the problems,
however, crop up in the fifth paragraph of the column.
Here, Zelnick boils affirmative action down to the
benefits students might receive in an integrated class
room. Even allowing the author his application of eco
nomic theory to classroom dynamics, which seems a
dubious thought process in itself, one can still take on
his central claim that diversity is "subject to diminish
ing returns." Zelnick writes: "The first African Ameri
can in a history or political science course arguably
could bring important perspectives to bear on many
subjects. But what about the second? Or the 17th? And
suppose the course were biology? Or chemical engi
neering? Or medicine?"
