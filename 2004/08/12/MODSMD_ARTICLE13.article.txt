Siddiqui bids Stanford farewell
My colleagues and friends, I would
like to thank the entire Stanford com
munity for letting me be a part of this
wonderful and amazing place called the
"Farm". It truly has been a privilege

and a trmendous honor to serve Stan
ford students, faculty, staff and the
community ... it is the greatest place.
I will miss Stanford tremendously and
specially my entire staff who are one of the
best. I am so extremly proud of their work
and commitments; thank you for every
thing you have done.
I wish Stanford dining staff and the
entire R&DE staff my best wishes; thank
you for all your kindness.

I hope that we do stay in touch. My new e
inail address is neswisc@ginail.com. Take care.
