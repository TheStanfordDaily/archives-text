## Eliminating the doping problem 
### 
There are two big stories at this year's Athens
Olympics. The first is the city itself, which
could not be more shoddily prepared for
the games if the mayor had suddenly said
"Quick, sweep all the homeless people and stray dogs
under the corner of this rug!"
The second major issue of concern is the threat of
terrorist attacks, which has many American athletes
fearing for their safety, most notably the original
starting lineup from the USA Basketball team, which
after torturous deliberation decided to stay home
after finding out that Greece, unlike most other Eu
ropean countries, still criminalizes marijuana.
But the issue lurking beneath every event, even the
ones nobody cares about, has to do with performance
enhancing drugs. Track and field athletes in particular

will be subjected to rigorous test
ing that costs millions of dollars
and still does not remove doubt in
the eyes of fans. Steroids have
been a hot topic: of late, with
everyone from George W. Bush
on down touching on the issue.
MLB has been plagued with ru
mors of widespread steroid use,
as have many track and field ath
letes. Blood doping has brought a
pallor over the l our de France.
The world over, athletes using
such drugs have been exposed as

cheaters, and the fans' trust that the victor in any par
ticular event is actually the best athlete and not just the
most adept evader of the rules has been damaged.
The solution to this problem with enhancers,
though, is pretty simple:
Legalize them.
If there is no penalty for using performance-enhanc
ing drugs, the "unfair advantage" is immediately lost. If
Carl Lewis had been on the same roofie colada that Ben
Johnson had in his system in the 1988 Olympics, he
would have blown by Johnson like a Mustang passing ...
well, whatever a Canadian sports car is.
Furthermore, it is extremely likely that Athens
would be one of the last Olympics where comprehen
sive testing is even possible. While science is coming
up with new ultramodern testing methods, it also
sparks a market for new ultramodern ways of avoid
ing exposure and undetectable drugs.
One major counterargument for the legalization of
performance-enhancing drugs is that it harms the ath
letes' lives outside the sport, severely damaging their
health. But elite athletes already make huge sacrifices
to their well-being, both social and physical, to suc
ceed. The constant stress on muscle groups, combined
with repeated reconstructive surgeries and the use of
supplements that fall within the current constraints of
what is "legal" already shortens any athlete's lifespan.
But if someone wants to drastically reduce his time on
Earth for the sake of glory on the field, who are we to
deny him that opportunity? People already do this every
clay, even in the business world, where putting incredi
ble stress on yourself will probably put you in a casket
faster than a few HGH cocktails.
Another argument is that of access — the idea
that legalizing performance enhancers creates a

gap between those who have
the resources to acquire expen
sive growth hormones and
steroids and those that don't
— but there's already a huge
chasm based on money. Sorry,
but Ngala is already one step
behind simply by virtue of
being born in Lagos rather
than Denver. Should we also
tell athletes how much they can
spend on their shoes or
that they can't altitude-train if
the opportunity is not available
to other competitors? When
you put any kind of artificial
ceiling on an athlete's ability to
perform, you allow yourself
only two options: a watered
down product or rampant
rule-breaking.
Also, the likelihood of see
ing records smashed by juiced
athletes would make ratings
skyrocket, and, as we all know,
the most important name in
sports is Nielsen. Those who
support only "ethical" athletes
who refuse to ingest massive
amounts of EPO or an
drostenedione or Japanese
hornet paste (seriously) would
be far outnumbered by people
that would tune in just to see a

Turk's veins burst right out of
his forearms while lifting the
equivalent of a 1967 GTO.
When we restrict an athlete's
ability to push his body to its
limit, we deaden the essence of
competition. The gold medal
run is no longer the most excel
lent feat imaginable as it was be
fore athletes realized that they
could get that much better by in
gesting all manner of drugs.
We live in a world now where
the theoretical maximum of
hand-eye coordination or foot
speed climbs upward almost
daily, where building your body
into an athletic machine with
performance enhancers has be
come a necessary outgrowth of
performance itself.
This whole process doesn't re
ally interest me either way. It de
presses me that a large fraction of
what makes up success in sports
has moved from on-the-field ath
leticism to bodily preparation,
but such is progress. The best
athletes in the world deserve to
pursue their craft to the best of
their abilities, meaning they
should do whatever they can to
get faster, higher (ha), stronger.
And you know what? If a
sprinter finishes the 100 meters in
8 seconds and then his heart pops
like a zit, more power to him.
