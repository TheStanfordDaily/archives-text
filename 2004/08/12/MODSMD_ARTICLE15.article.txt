# Forty-two athletes try living up to Stanford's Olympic legacy
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
When George Horine cleared a
height of six feet, two and a hall
inches to earn bronze in Stock
holm's 1912 Olympics, he probably
had no idea what he was starting. It
was to be his first and only Olympic
medal, but the first of 182 Olympic
medals won by Stanford athletes at
the summer games.
Since Horine took the podium,
Stanford athletes have not failed to
bring home at least one and as
many as 21 medals from each
Olympic Games. In fact, in every
Olympiad since 1912, Stanford
athletes have won at least one and
as many as 17 gold medals.
The Sydney Olympics in 2000
marked Stanford athletes' 100 th
gold medal and brought the Cardi
nal's gold coffers up to 104 —
more golds than several small
countries can boast.
The 42-member Stanford con
tingent heading to Athens this week
may achieve another historic mark
for the Cardinal. If the athletes
earn 18 total medals, Stanford ath
letes will have earned 200 Olympic
medals since their first in 1912.
To make this mark sound more
poetic, let's just say Stanford ath
letes may be on their way to hitting
their second hundredth medal in

this second summer Olympics
of the second millennium.
If history is any indication,
they've got a pretty good
chance at making the 18-medal
mark. Stanford athletes won 10
medals in Sydney in 2000, 19
in Atlanta in 1996, 19 in
Barcelona in 1992, and 17 in
Seoul in 1988.
The hulk of these medals,
about 75 percent, have been
won in the pool. Of the 46
medals that Stanford athletes
won in the past three Olympics,
34 have been in swimming.
Thirty-seven have been in
aquatic sports — swimming,
synchronized swimming, water
polo and diving.
Cardinal dominance in the
pool has been consistent
throughout Olympic history,
but swimming success has really
peaked over the past 20 years.
From 1912 through 1976,
Stanford averaged about five
and a half aquatic medals per
Olympics. But from 1984
through 2000, Cardinal aquatic
athletes have averaged about
12 medals.

Total medal averages generally
follow the aquatic averages —
Stanford athletes averaged about
seven medals per Olympics from
1912 through 1976 and about 15

medals from 1984 to 2000.
Stanford swimmers had their
best Olympics in 1992. Led by ath
