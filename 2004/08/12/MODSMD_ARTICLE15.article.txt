# Forty-two athletes try living up to Stanford's Olympic legacy
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
When George Horine cleared a
height of six feet, two and a hall
inches to earn bronze in Stock
holm's 1912 Olympics, he probably
had no idea what he was starting. It
was to be his first and only Olympic
medal, but the first of 182 Olympic
medals won by Stanford athletes at
the summer games.
Since Horine took the podium,
Stanford athletes have not failed to
bring home at least one and as
many as 21 medals from each
Olympic Games. In fact, in every
Olympiad since 1912, Stanford
athletes have won at least one and
as many as 17 gold medals.
The Sydney Olympics in 2000
marked Stanford athletes' 100 th
gold medal and brought the Cardi
nal's gold coffers up to 104 —
more golds than several small
countries can boast.
The 42-member Stanford con
tingent heading to Athens this week
may achieve another historic mark
for the Cardinal. If the athletes
earn 18 total medals, Stanford ath
letes will have earned 200 Olympic
medals since their first in 1912.
To make this mark sound more
poetic, let's just say Stanford ath
letes may be on their way to hitting
their second hundredth medal in

this second summer Olympics
of the second millennium.
If history is any indication,
they've got a pretty good
chance at making the 18-medal
mark. Stanford athletes won 10
medals in Sydney in 2000, 19
in Atlanta in 1996, 19 in
Barcelona in 1992, and 17 in
Seoul in 1988.
The hulk of these medals,
about 75 percent, have been
won in the pool. Of the 46
medals that Stanford athletes
won in the past three Olympics,
34 have been in swimming.
Thirty-seven have been in
aquatic sports — swimming,
synchronized swimming, water
polo and diving.
Cardinal dominance in the
pool has been consistent
throughout Olympic history,
but swimming success has really
peaked over the past 20 years.
From 1912 through 1976,
Stanford averaged about five
and a half aquatic medals per
Olympics. But from 1984
through 2000, Cardinal aquatic
athletes have averaged about
12 medals.

Total medal averages generally
follow the aquatic averages —
Stanford athletes averaged about
seven medals per Olympics from
1912 through 1976 and about 15

medals from 1984 to 2000.

Stanford graduate Logan Tom is one of many
returning Olympians representing the United
States in Athens this summer.
Sanders, Janet Evans, and
Jenny Thompson, who have
since become household
names in the sport, Stanford
swimmers racked up 17 of
Stanford's 19 medals in
Barcelona's pool. Ten of them
were gold.
Team USA's assistant swim
coach in Barcelona was none
other than Stanford's current
women's swimming coach,
Richard Quick (nicknamed
Dick Quick). Quick was head
coach of Team USA in 1988,
1996 and 2000. He will return
as assistant coach of Team
USA in Athens, hopefully for
a repeat performance of
Barcelona's success.
If 1992's 38 member Stan
ford contingent had been a
country in the Barcelona
Olympics, it would have
placed 13th in the world with
its 19 medals and ninth with
10 golds.

And Barcelona wasn't even
Stanford's best Games.
In Paris in 1924, Stanford
athletes claimed 21 total
medals, 12 of which were
gold. Rugby, water polo and
diving athletes led the way in
that Olympic Games, respec
tively claiming nine, six and
four medals.
Rugby was statistically Stan
ford's most successful Olympic
sport in the early years —
1920 and 1924. But since nine
rugby players earned gold in
1924, the Cardinal has not
had any Olympic medalists in
that sport.
Track and water polo
essentially split all of Stan
ford's 11 medals in 1932, with
the exception of one swim
mer. After 1932, Stanford's
medal count struggled to
break into the double digits
until 1984. In those interim
years, mostly swimmers and
rowers kept a Cardinal pres
ence on the podium.
Both water polo and track
athletes have been a consistent
presence in the medal-win
ning Stan ford contingent

throughout Olympic history.
Sprinter Chryste Gaines is
the most recent medal win
ner on the track with a gold
in 1996 and bronze in 2000.
She did not qualify to com
pete this year, but Stanford
graduate Toby Stevenson is a
gold medal hopeful in the
pole vault.
Water polo's most recent
medalists were Ellen Estes and
Brenda Villa who took silver
on Team USA in 2000. Both
Estes and Villa will be in
Athens along with several
other Cardinal men and
women seeking to carry on the
medal-winning tradition in
water polo.
The Stanford swimmers
have the biggest shoes to fill.
Jenny Thompson, the most
decorated athlete in Olympic
history with eight gold medals,
a silver and a bronze, will be
back again, joined by Markus
Rogan, Caroline Bruce, Kris
ten Caverly and sisters Tara
and Dana Kirk.
Seconds will likely tell
whether that second hun
dredth medal is earned.
