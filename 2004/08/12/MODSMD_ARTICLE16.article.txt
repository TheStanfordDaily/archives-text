# The
						2004 Games: By the numbers
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
$7.2 billion: The estimated cost
of putting on the 2004 Olympics in
Athens, though some analysts pre
dict that the number could jump to
as much as $12.5 billion by the
time the Games are over. The
number is a far cry from the origi
nal $5.6 billion price tag attached
to the Olympics.
Many have decried the exorbi
tant amount being spent on the
Games, as it will likely saddle
Greece with a deficit that exceeds
European Union ceilings. Ana
lysts predict that the Greek tax
payers could be shelling out
money to cover the Games for the
next decade.
24: The number of hours per day
that military aircraft will be pa
trolling the Athens skies during the
Olympics. The precaution is just

one of several that has run the
Games' security bill up to a record
$ 1.5 billion.
70,000 law enforcement officials
will be on hand, in addition to 200
NATO soldiers and a rapid-re
sponse team of 400 men and
women. A $312 million communi
cation and surveillance system has
also been developed specifically for
the Olympics.
26: The number of countries
through which the historical
Olympic torch has traveled. Six
hundred people will carry the
torch through its final two days, a
trip from Marathon to the open
ing ceremonies in Athens tomor
row night.
Nine-time gold medalist Carl
Lewis and model Naomi Campbell
are said to be among those who will
bring the torch through Athens.
3: The number of hours that the
opening ceremony is expected to

run. Tuesday's dress rehearsal,
which was attended by some 35,000
spectators, revealed many ol the ex
travagant performances that are to
take place. A giant statue of Athena,
protector of the city, is said to rise
from the ground in the stadium,
and a Trojan horse will also be in
volved in the ceremony.
70,000 people are expected to at
tend the ceremony.
2.5 million: The number ol tick
ets sold through Wednesday for
Olympic events. Though 5.3 mil
lion tickets are available, officials
have set a goal of 3.4 million sold, a
mark that will likely be met as the
Games draw closer.
Soccer has accounted lor much ol
the Games' sales (about 25 percent),
while track and field events have
also been a big draw lately.
6: The number of athletes that
