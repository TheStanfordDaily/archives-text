# The 						2004 Games: By the numbers
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
$7.2 billion: The estimated cost
of putting on the 2004 Olympics in
Athens, though some analysts pre
dict that the number could jump to
as much as $12.5 billion by the
time the Games are over. The
number is a far cry from the origi
nal $5.6 billion price tag attached
to the Olympics.
Many have decried the exorbi
tant amount being spent on the
Games, as it will likely saddle
Greece with a deficit that exceeds
European Union ceilings. Ana
lysts predict that the Greek tax
payers could be shelling out
money to cover the Games for the
next decade.
24: The number of hours per day
that military aircraft will be pa
trolling the Athens skies during the
Olympics. The precaution is just

one of several that has run the
Games' security bill up to a record
$ 1.5 billion.
70,000 law enforcement officials
will be on hand, in addition to 200
NATO soldiers and a rapid-re
sponse team of 400 men and
women. A $312 million communi
cation and surveillance system has
also been developed specifically for
the Olympics.
26: The number of countries
through which the historical
Olympic torch has traveled. Six
hundred people will carry the
torch through its final two days, a
trip from Marathon to the open
ing ceremonies in Athens tomor
row night.
Nine-time gold medalist Carl
Lewis and model Naomi Campbell
are said to be among those who will
bring the torch through Athens.
3: The number of hours that the
opening ceremony is expected to

run. Tuesday's dress rehearsal,
which was attended by some 35,000
spectators, revealed many ol the ex
travagant performances that are to
take place. A giant statue of Athena,
protector of the city, is said to rise
from the ground in the stadium,
and a Trojan horse will also be in
volved in the ceremony.
70,000 people are expected to at
tend the ceremony.
2.5 million: The number ol tick
ets sold through Wednesday for
Olympic events. Though 5.3 mil
lion tickets are available, officials
have set a goal of 3.4 million sold, a
mark that will likely be met as the
Games draw closer.
Soccer has accounted lor much ol
the Games' sales (about 25 percent),
while track and field events have
also been a big draw lately.
6: The number of athletes that
have been officially banned from
Olympic competition for using
performance-enhancing drugs.
The most recent of these was
American sprinter Torri Ed
wards, who received a two-year
ban for doping yesterday. Her
place in the 100-meter sprint
will be assumed by 37-year-old
Gail Devers.
After 1 1 athletes — six
medalists — tested positive for
performance enhancers at the
Sydney Games, officials decid
ed to up the number of tests
completed by 25 percent in
Athens. There are also reports
that new bans and improved
tests will be in place for this
summer's Olympics.
102: The age, in years, of
James Stillman Rockefeller,
who until his death on Tuesday
was the oldest known Olympic
medalist in the world. Rocke
feller was a member of the
eight-man rowing team that
won gold in the 1924 Olympics
in Paris.
7: The number of sibling
pairs competing together in
Athens. The count is down by
one since yesterday, when Ser
ena Williams withdrew from
Olympic competition, leaving
sister Venus to defend the
duo's doubles title with anoth
er partner.
Stanford sends two of the
seven pairs: swimmers I ara

and Dana Kirk and tennis play
ers Bob and Mike Bryan.
The other sibling pairs are
Divers Troy and Justin Du
mais, fencers Keeth and Erinn
Smart and Sada and Emily Ja
cobson, gymnasts and twin
brothers Paul and Morgan
Hamm and swimmers Kalyn
and Klete Keller.
13: The number of workers
killed during the construction
of the Olympic venues in
Athens. Anti-Olympics demon
strators gathered in front of
Parliament on Tuesday to
honor the workers.
Amnesty International re
ported that Olympics-related
deaths may be as high as 40.
0: The number of times that

women's wrestling has been an
Olympic sport. 2004 marks the
debut of the event, and the
United States will be sending
four women to represent the
country, including Stanford
graduate Patricia Miranda.
Three of the four won silver
medals at last year's world
championships.

$7.2 billion: The estimated cost
of putting on the 2004 Olympics in
Athens, though some analysts pre
dict that the number could jump to
as much as $12.5 billion by the
time the Games are over. The
number is a far cry from the origi
nal $5.6 billion price tag attached
to the Olympics.
Many have decried the exorbi
tant amount being spent on the
Games, as it will likely saddle
Greece with a deficit that exceeds
European Union ceilings. Ana
lysts predict that the Greek tax
payers could be shelling out
money to cover the Games for the
next decade.

that military aircraft will be pa
trolling the Athens skies during the

women. A $312 million communi
cation and surveillance system has
also been developed specifically for
the Olympics.

through which the historical
Olympic torch has traveled. Six
hundred people will carry the
torch through its final two days, a

row night.
Nine-time gold medalist Carl
Lewis and model Naomi Campbell
are said to be among those who will
bring the torch through Athens.
3: The number of hours that the
opening ceremony is expected to

run. Tuesday's dress rehearsal,
which was attended by some 35,000
spectators, revealed many ol the ex
travagant performances that are to
take place. A giant statue of Athena,
protector of the city, is said to rise
from the ground in the stadium,
and a Trojan horse will also be in
volved in the ceremony.
70,000 people are expected to at
tend the ceremony.
2.5 million: The number ol tick
ets sold through Wednesday for
Olympic events. Though 5.3 mil
lion tickets are available, officials
have set a goal of 3.4 million sold, a
mark that will likely be met as the
Games draw closer.
Soccer has accounted lor much ol
the Games' sales (about 25 percent),
while track and field events have
also been a big draw lately.
6: The number of athletes that
have been officially banned from
Olympic competition for using

will be assumed by 37-year-old
Gail Devers.
After 1 1 athletes — six
medalists — tested positive for
performance enhancers at the

ed to up the number of tests
completed by 25 percent in
Athens. There are also reports
that new bans and improved
tests will be in place for this
summer's Olympics.
