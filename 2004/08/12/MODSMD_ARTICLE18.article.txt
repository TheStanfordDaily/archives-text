# Rogan aims to bring gold to Austria
## 
### HUGH BIGGAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
2004 Stanford graduate Markus Rogan
has won two NCAA swimming champi
onships, and was named the University's
top male athlete in 2002. He's headed to the
Olympics, and already has several endorse
ment deals lined up.
Given all of this, he is a decidedly low-pro
file guy. During a lunch hour last quarter at
Stanford's student union, which was crowd-

Ed with students and the visiting families of
prospective freshmen, nobody gave the 6-
foot-5 Rogan a second look. With his shorts,
sandals, t-shirt, backpack and conversational
language peppered with "like," "sweet," and
"kickin' it," Rogan blended in easily.
In his native Austria, where Rogan is
the number one-ranked swimmer, things
are different.
"I get the double-triple look," Rogan said
of his fellow Austrians. "They send their kids
over to get an autograph. Sometimes when

I buy something and they see
my name, they apologize for
not recognizing me earlier."
By contrast, Rogan said he
didn't mind being just an
other face in the crowd at
Stanford. Swimming at Stan
ford has brought him other
advantages â€” advantages
he believes he would never
have had in Austria.
"In Austria, there is a na
tional culture of being
mediocre. I think they have
just lost too often," Rogan said.
He points out that Austria
has lost all of its major wars
in the last 100 years and has
had an official status of polit-

ical neutrality since 1945.
"[Austrians] are perfectly happy to he in
the middle," Rogan said. "They don't want to
be the best, they don't want to be the worst."
Rogan escaped this middle-ground
malaise by moving to the United States from
Vienna when he was 14. At that time, his
stepfather was assigned to work as a televi
sion correspondent in Washington, D.C.
The move proved providential for
Rogan. A casual interest in swimming in
Austria soon became his full-time focus.
With the help of his high school coach in
suburban Virginia, Rogan became an
All-American swimmer. His coach also
encouraged Stanford to recruit Rogan.
In turn, Rogan was attracted to Stanford
because of its culture of both academics
and athletics.
"In Austria, I would have finished at
school and then would have had to make a
decision. Do 1 want to go the academic way
or the athletic way?" he said.
At Stanford, Rogan felt lucky to be able
to do both, especially since top athletes in
Austria usually skip college altogether. In
addition to practicing 30 hours a week in
preparation for the Olympics, Rogan also
finished his undergraduate degree in polit
ical science and economics in June. He
hopes to use his degree to go to work in

management for one of his sponsors when
he finished with competitive swimming.
Athletically, Rogan feels one of the most
important things he has learned at Stanford
is an American-style confidence that gives
him an edge in the pool.
"I wouldn't have been nearly as good a
swimmer if 1 hadn't come to Stanford," he
said, recalling his experience as an 18-year
old at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. "I was
too scared to do well, then. It was a very
Austrian way to think. "
Now, he says, he has no such fears.
"It's amazing at practice when you know, if
you keep up with [your teammates], you can
keep up with anyone in the world," he said.
The Austrian papers tease him about this
newfound confidence and his tendency to
complain about finishing second.
"At first they allied it an "Americanism,"
Rogan said, "Now they have learned to accept it."
Rogan hopes this confidence will make the
difference in Athens. His goal of gold is as
much a personal desire as it is something he
wants for Austria, a nation normally fanatical
only about skiing, not swimming. Austria
hasn't won an Olympic medal in swimming
since 1912, something Rogan plans to change.
"I feel haven't won anything big yet,"
Rogan said. "I haven't won the Olympics. I
realize there is a lot more to do."
