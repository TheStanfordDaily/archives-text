Faculty Recruitment Office
addresses faculty concerns, issues
While Stanford's California
location allows for multicultur

alism among faculty, there is a
concern for the recruitment
and retention of minority facul
ty and graduate students said
Associate Vice Provost for Fac
ulty Development Sally Dickin
son in an interview with The
Stanford Report. Dickinson
also noted that some minority
faculty members have reported
a sense of "isolation" in some
departments, in particular the
life sciences and natural sci
ences fields.
"We only have a small num
ber in any given group to begin
with, so therefore, losing one
or two Latinos, African Ameri
cans, Native Americans is a real
problem, and we have to try
and make sure we're holding
onto them," said Dickinson to
Stanford Report writer Ray
Delgado.
"I think we also have to let
people know that we are really
committed to not only recruiting
them and having them come to
Stanford but also to provide an
environment of scholars where
they will feel welcome," Dickin
son cited as one of the challenges
the school faces in retaining mi
nority faculty.
Dickinson, who heads the Fac
ulty Recruitment Office, men
tioned the competition the school
has in recruiting faculty of color,
especially with the East Coast. In
an effort to help search for di
verse faculty, the office had come
up with a database of scholars
across the country.

with, so therefore, losing one
or two Latinos, African Ameri
cans, Native Americans is a real
problem, and we have to try
and make sure we're holding
onto them," said Dickinson to
Stanford Report writer Ray
Delgado.
"I think we also have to let
people know that we are really
committed to not only recruiting
them and having them come to
Stanford but also to provide an
environment of scholars where
they will feel welcome," Dickin
son cited as one of the challenges
the school faces in retaining mi
nority faculty.
Dickinson, who heads the Fac
ulty Recruitment Office, men
tioned the competition the school
has in recruiting faculty of color,
especially with the East Coast. In
an effort to help search for di
verse faculty, the office had come
up with a database of scholars
across the country.
