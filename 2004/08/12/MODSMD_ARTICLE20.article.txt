"Harold and Kumar Go to White
Castle" could have easily been the
same, average mind-numbing teen
comedy. Its plot — two stoners taking
a trip to find munchies — seems like a
"Half-Baked" or "Road Trip" rip-off. It

has cameos from Eddie
Kaye of "American
Pie," Ryan Reynolds of
"Van Wilder" and
Doogie Howser him
self. The two main stars
are Kal Penn and John
Cho who are bit char
acters from "Van
Wilder" and "Ameri-

can Pie." And, to make matters worse,
it's directed by Danny Leiner, who was
responsible for "Dude, Where's My
Car?" Despite all these obvious draw
backs, "Harold and Kumar Go To
White Castle" is both original and
clever. Hilarious, depraved, complicat-

Ed with its satire and yet silly through
out, it's the most original teen / pot /
stupid movie in a while.
The opening scene really defines
the movie. Two white entrepreneurs
want to leave work early fora night of
sex and drugs. It's the typical buddy
comedy: one party-animal, one
straight man. Rather than following

these pre
dict a b 1 e
characters
on their ad
ventures,
the camera
pans to
Harold
(John Cho)
— an Asian

banker who is stuck with their work.
He, at first glance, fits the stereotype
Hollywood usually gives of the Asian
male — the brainy, glasses-wearing
straight man who is both too square
and too spineless to warrant an en
tire movie. As the film develops, it's

apparent that Harold isn't any of
these things.
The movie plays with stereotypes
both about race and about teen come
dies. Instead of following the white en
trepreneurs, it follows the Asian math
geek and his pre-med doctor friend,
Kumar. Kumar (Kal Penn) is as com
plicated as his buddy. Unlike Harold,
lie's unemployed, and passes his days
going from med school interview to
med school interview. Each time, he in
tentionally screws them up. Why? He
doesn't want to go to med school (even
with perfect scores), but if he didn't go
to the interviews, his father would take
away Kumar's allowance. Kumar is try
ing to avoid doctorhood because that is
the perceived career path for an intelli
gent South-Asian male. Instead, he and
his pal Harold are a younger, more
frustrated Cheech and Chong.

dozen films and steals jokes from
