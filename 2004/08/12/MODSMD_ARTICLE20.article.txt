### CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION WRITER 
"Harold and Kumar Go to White
Castle" could have easily been the
same, average mind-numbing teen
comedy. Its plot — two stoners taking
a trip to find munchies — seems like a
"Half-Baked" or "Road Trip" rip-off. It

has cameos from Eddie
Kaye of "American
Pie," Ryan Reynolds of
"Van Wilder" and
Doogie Howser him
self. The two main stars
are Kal Penn and John
Cho who are bit char
acters from "Van
Wilder" and "Ameri-

can Pie." And, to make matters worse,
it's directed by Danny Leiner, who was
responsible for "Dude, Where's My
Car?" Despite all these obvious draw
backs, "Harold and Kumar Go To
White Castle" is both original and
clever. Hilarious, depraved, complicat-

Ed with its satire and yet silly through
out, it's the most original teen / pot /
stupid movie in a while.
The opening scene really defines
the movie. Two white entrepreneurs
want to leave work early fora night of
sex and drugs. It's the typical buddy
comedy: one party-animal, one
straight man. Rather than following

these pre
dict a b 1 e
characters
on their ad
ventures,
the camera
pans to
Harold
(John Cho)
— an Asian

banker who is stuck with their work.
He, at first glance, fits the stereotype
Hollywood usually gives of the Asian
male — the brainy, glasses-wearing
straight man who is both too square
and too spineless to warrant an en
tire movie. As the film develops, it's

apparent that Harold isn't any of
these things.
The movie plays with stereotypes
both about race and about teen come
dies. Instead of following the white en
trepreneurs, it follows the Asian math
geek and his pre-med doctor friend,
Kumar. Kumar (Kal Penn) is as com
plicated as his buddy. Unlike Harold,
lie's unemployed, and passes his days
going from med school interview to
med school interview. Each time, he in
tentionally screws them up. Why? He
doesn't want to go to med school (even
with perfect scores), but if he didn't go
to the interviews, his father would take
away Kumar's allowance. Kumar is try
ing to avoid doctorhood because that is
the perceived career path for an intelli
gent South-Asian male. Instead, he and
his pal Harold are a younger, more
frustrated Cheech and Chong.
"Harold and Kumar" references a
dozen films and steals jokes from
many more. It early on alludes to
John Cho's other famous work,
"Better Luck Tomorrow," and
Danny Leiner couldn't resist
placing the line "Dude, where's
my car?" somewhere in the film.
In addition to references, whole
scenes seem stolen from other
teen movies. There is a farting
scene in a school bathroom, with
the heroes in the next stall listen
ing to attractive girls' gastroin
testinal difficulties. It's practical
ly ripped from the frames of
"Not Another Teen Movie." A
raccoon attacks them in a car —
which is the same scene, only
with a deer — in "Tommy Boy."

The raccoon itself may have been
the very same one from "Saving
Silverman." Every time a classic
joke is presented, though, it
twists itself in a new way. The rac
coon incident results in a strange
and humorous encounter at the
hospital. The direction the film
takes as a result of the jokes is
new, if some of the jokes seem a
little stale. As a result, the sea
soned comedy fan enjoys the new
twists and the dumb-movie fa
natic gets what he wants.
The action of the film takes
place in various locales in New Jer
sey. On the way to get their burg
ers, Harold and Kumar encounter
asshole snowboarders, racist cops,
an overzealous Asian culture club
and Doogie Howser on an acid
trip. Not every scene hits — there
are a few where the joke is too for
mulaic or the gross out humor just
doesn't seem warranted (you'll

grow queasy when a boil-covered
hillbilly fixes their car). But one
finds that more jokes hit their
mark than miss.
Whether you enjoy the dumb
teen pot movie or enjoy seeing it
smashed to smithereens, you will
like this movie. Its satire is
tongue-in-cheek and warm even
when dealing with things as
tough as saving an innocent
black man from racist New Jersey
cops. The writers seemed to
know they had the opportunity
to make a scathing satire of the
white teen buddy comedy. They
knew they could make a bold
statement about race and break
ing stereotypes. The writers saw
their opportunity — and then
took another take and instead
went for something much dumb
er. You'll laugh, even if the anti
racist message can't be seen
through all the smoke.
