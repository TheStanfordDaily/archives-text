# 'Collateral' gives Cruise new image
## 
### RANDY MANO INTERMISSION WRITER 
It is easy to pick out the flaws in "Collateral." Prepared to
slam the movie, I have reflected over the past few days and
now realize that it's a fairly sophisticated, nuanced drama be
tween two foils who cross paths one wild night in Ix>s Angeles.
Tom Cruise is trying so hard for that Oscar. Vou can
smell his zealousness as he dons his nouveau persona,
complete with silver hair, designer suit and a lower voice.
Your first impression of him is a wealthy man whose
riches probably come from corrupt means. The interesting
thing is that he is the first character we see in the film —
Cruise is designed to be a mysterious element, meaning he
would normally be infused into the story midstream. We
get a teaser of him and his shiny suitcase, then director
Michael Mann cuts to the other main players, specifically a
by-the-books cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx).
A majority of American adults believe that winning the
lottery will happen during their lifetime. Max is one of
them, in a way. He has big dreams and never lets go of
them, but unfortunatelv, either because of laziness or fear,
he remains entrenched in the
"just-scraping-by" category.
Enter a smart, charismatic, ca
reer-driven woman named Annie
(Jada Pinkett-Smith). Normally,
Max would have no chance of in
teracting with her, but tonight is
different. Annie and Max click in
a clever, cute meeting that be
gins with a driving bet. Being a
SoCal native, I smirked as free
ways and major roads got rattled
off like batting averages or ice
cream ingredients.
What could have been a fairly triv
ial action-suspense piece turns into
artwork on a higher plane. Mind you,
it's tar from perfect — in particular,
the moments alluding to "Termina
tor'-like invincibility and a train chase
reeking of countless other action se
quences. But what Mann does is ele
vate the film past these conventions
and focuses on the metaphysical na
ture of life, as represented by a few
isolated characters.
"Collateral" is going to be a
tough sell from a marketer's stand
point. Even at the screening, there

were two clear demographics tar
geted by the dual-studio produc
tion. Sponsored by an easy-listen
ing radio station, one focused on
people who follow Michael Mann
and Tom Cruise; the other, target
ing those who love Jamie Foxx and
Jada Pinkett-Smith, was an R&B/
hip-hop channel.
Clearly neither will love what
the\ see if they're expecting more of
die same from the aforementioned,
aside from perhaps Michael Mann.
Mann, with earlier complex produc
tions such as "Heat" and"The Insid
er" in his repertoire, delivers a
scathing analysis of the seedy under
belly of the LA culture, including a
dynamic cameo by Javier Bardem
("Before Night Falls") as a shady
crime boss.
Cruise and Foxx, as well as
the few moments with Pinkett
Smith, play solidly against type.
I was incredulous, even to the
point of laughter, when one of
these actors did something total
ly uncharacteristic — such as a
casual reference to murder or a
profanity-laden argument with a
taxi dispatcher.
Yes, "Collateral" is an R-rated
feature strictly for thinking adults
who have yearned fora less-for
mulaic summer movie.
