# Mann's unique talent shines through in 'Collateral'
## 
### SCOTT HOWARD INTERMISSION ONLINE FILM CRITIC 
Michael Mann is among the greatest
filmmakers alive today, although he's not
usually recognized as such. Perhaps it's be
cause in the past 15 years he's only made
five movies, including his latest, "Collater
al." Or maybe it's because his most com
mercially accessible film, "The Last Of The
Mohicans," was a big budget action movie
based on a novel written in 1826.
He may not be the most prolific direc
tor, but his style is instantly identifiable.

Mann uses the widescreen properties of
film like no one else and painstakingly ac
counts for every millimeter of the 2:35:1
frame with a perfectionistic zeal not seen
since the days of spaghetti westerns. He's
a stark minimalist and seldom lets more
than three colors into a shot (or an entire
movie; "Collateral's" are blue, gray and
black). Swelling synthesizer scores a la
Tangerine Dream went out in 1986 for
most filmmakers, but Mann still uses
them in a way that's far from cheesy. The
steely atmosphere extends beyond the
surface, too, as his work rarely deals with

metaphorical content and often follows
jaded professional manly men who are
just trying to make it though their sad
lives; they're usually cops or criminals
("Heat," "Manhunter," "Collateral") but
sometimes they're Morley Safer types
("The Insider"). While watching his
movies we cannot help but realize that
Mann cares, deeply and passionately,
about his material. Many directors total
ly cast off the responsibility of the score
to the composer or the camera angles
fora certain scene to the cinematogra
pher, but Mann's movies live and breathe

a certain way because they're the product
of a singular vision, not a collaborative ef
fort. That's probably why he doesn't work
too often.
Mann has made a career of crafting
lean, no-frills thrillers, but he's never
made anything as stripped-down as "Col
lateral," which mostly deals with two char
acters and one set. Max (Jamie Foxx) is a
cab driver in L.A. who picks up Vincent
(Tom Cruise). Though Vincent looks like
a normal suit in town fora business trip,
we quickly learn that he is a partic
ularly brutal and efficient hitman
who has hijacked Max's cab to use
for transportation to and from
each of his targets.
Now just read that synopsis
and think of how many banal ac
tion movie cliches that the movie
could have succumbed to. Mann,
being the master that he is,
doesn't give in to a single one of
them. I could tell you a million
reasons why this movie shouldn't
work. The hero is a geek with
glasses played by a former "In

Living Color" second-stringer.
The villain is a gray-haired jazz
fan with short man syndrome
who is played by Tom Cruise. An
overly earnest Audioslave song is
prominently featured.
The whole is greater than the
sum of its parts in a large way.
Though Cruise is the epitome of
the shallow star system, he has an
eye for quality and most of his
movies, along with his perfor
mances, are passable to excel
lent. He's never really played a
villain before, and his boyish
charm (still holding strong at 42)
gives Vincent a menacing edge
that other actors wouldn't be able
to match. Foxx continues his as
cent as one of the most talented
everymen of his generation with

his finest performance yet. Javier
Bardem (one of my favorite ac
tors; he earned an Oscar nomi
nation a few years back for "Be
fore Night Falls") registers
strongly in one of the film's best
scenes as a sleepy-eyed drug
lord. The soundtrack seamlessly
mixes techno, salsa, jazz, soul, al
ternative and even Tejano music
to create a portrait of the modern
multicultural Los Angeles.
But even with these checks in
the plus column, "Collateral"
wouldn't succeed without Mann
at the helm. Here, as always, he
achieves a perfect balance of
glossy professionalism and raw
power. It's his electrifying person
al touch that elevates the
mediocre to the exceptional.

doesn't give in to a single one of
them. I could tell you a million
reasons why this movie shouldn't
work. The hero is a geek with
glasses played by a former "In

Living Color" second-stringer.
The villain is a gray-haired jazz
fan with short man syndrome
who is played by Tom Cruise. An
overly earnest Audioslave song is
prominently featured.
The whole is greater than the
sum of its parts in a large way.
Though Cruise is the epitome of
the shallow star system, he has an
eye for quality and most of his
movies, along with his perfor
mances, are passable to excel
lent. He's never really played a
villain before, and his boyish
charm (still holding strong at 42)
gives Vincent a menacing edge
that other actors wouldn't be able
to match. Foxx continues his as
cent as one of the most talented
everymen of his generation with

his finest performance yet. Javier
Bardem (one of my favorite ac
tors; he earned an Oscar nomi
nation a few years back for "Be
fore Night Falls") registers
strongly in one of the film's best
scenes as a sleepy-eyed drug
lord. The soundtrack seamlessly
mixes techno, salsa, jazz, soul, al
ternative and even Tejano music
to create a portrait of the modern
multicultural Los Angeles.
But even with these checks in
the plus column, "Collateral"
wouldn't succeed without Mann
at the helm. Here, as always, he
achieves a perfect balance of
glossy professionalism and raw
power. It's his electrifying person
al touch that elevates the
mediocre to the exceptional.
