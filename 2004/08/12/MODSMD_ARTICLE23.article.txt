# RIP Snoopy: The invasion of the Web comic is upon us

Move over "Cathy," take a hike
"Garfield,'' for the new, Internet-ad
dicted generation of folks, there's a
new way to get your funnies. Enter the
vast world of W r eb comics, online
comics drawn by pretty much anyone
featuring more variety than you would
ever get in your typical Sunday news
paper. Comics range from video game
parodies and satires to romance and
drama, to action and anime-inspired
strips. Normally focusing more on cur
rent pop culture topics than your stan
dard newspaper strip, Web comics

have become very popular for the cur
rent young generation of the world.
Most Web comics start out much
differently than newspaper based
ones. Artists create their works and put
them online for everyone to peruse.
It's only after a fan base is created that
an artist can make a living off of the
comic through donations or merchan
dise sales. Because of this, most popu
lar Web comics are of really high qual
ity and continue to exist only because
they've done well enough to attract
random people on the net.
Looking for some good Web
comics to start off with? Here's a few
popular ones to look at:

Mega Tokyo
(http://www.megatokyo.com)
Known for its beautiful black and
white anime artwork, Mega Tokyo
features a deep cast of characters and
a great story featuring drama, comic,
and the occasional suspense-filled
story lines. Definitely recommended
for any anime fan out there.
Apple Geeks
(http://www.applegeeks.com)
Featuring spectacular colored is
sues, Apple Geeks centers around a
cast of characters just trying to get
through college. Real world college

issues usually lead to hilarious con
sequences for this primarily humor
comic. The artist is known for his
wonderful use of color and ink
style in every single issue, it's truly
a sight to see.
Queen of Wands
(http://www.queenofwands.net)
Recently voted Outstanding Ro
mantic Comic by the Webcartoon
ists Choice Awards, Queen of
Hands takes your standard rela

tionship story to new heights. With
hidden love, betrayals and con
frontation combined with the occa
sional funny break, this comic is
definitely a great choice.
Penny Arcade
(http://www.penny-arcade.com)
The definitive video game web
comic, Penny Arcade has been in
existence for over five years. The
satire and humor in PA is absolute
ly hilarious, and its knack for saying
what every hardcore gamer is
thinking about has garnered a fan
base of humongous proportions.
This is a cult favorite that every
gamer needs to follow.
