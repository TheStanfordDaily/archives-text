# Roxy's Believe it or Not!: When guys say ‘No’
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
No, Hell hath not frozen over. Contrary to
tht' popular belief that guys think any and all
sex is a good thing, the truth is that in some
cases, guys would much rather a) sleep, b) eat
or c) watch figure skating on TV.
Super-emotional sobbing sex: If you're
frequently reaching lor that strategically
placed box of Kleenex to wipe away tears
and runny mascara, not other bodily dis
charges, he's not going to be a happy
camper. Unless he's the kind who actually
wants to watch "Ghost" and "Roman Holi
day" with you, crying isn't going to get you
very far. As wonderful and life-changing as
this experience is for you, it puts a lot of stress
on your partner, who probably isn't as emo
tionally charged. Most guys want to roll over
and sleep afterward; you'd better hope he
wants to spoon and talk about his feelings.

Hooks, bells, and whistles: At the time, that
lacy / satiny beribboned contraption that Fred
ericks of Hollywood calls lingerie seemed like a
g(xxl investment tor the bedroom. Theoreti
cally, that pleather bodysuit and lxx)ts get-up
would have put a spark back in the sack. The
reality, however, is that he doesn't want to
spend 30 minutes (let alone 30 seconds) figur
ing out how to get you out of your fancy un
derwear. If it requires rocket science to re
move, forget it. Fashion victims don't get laid.
Variety is the spice of life, but he'd much rather
just tear off your ratty t-shirt and comfy cotton
granny panties any day.
Boot camp? No thanks: He loves it when
you take the reins and make him feel like
he doesn't have to initiate the action. He
loves it when you give him kinky sugges
tions and vocalize your desires. He loves it
when you tell him that he's sending you to
seventh heaven. But he hates it when
you're bossing him around. You're not a

drill sergeant ordering a soldier to get
down and give her 20 (I mean, unless you
really are a drill sergeant outside of closed
doors). Be bold, not bitchy.
Overplanned and overrated: Remember
prom night? You vowed to lose your V-card
to your high school sweetheart in the most
romantic way possible. A gorgeous dress, a
fancy dinner, the rose petals scattered
around the hotel room, Peter Gabriel's "In
Your Eyes" playing softly in the background
... and the unspectacular sex. Not to men
tion the curtains caught on fire thanks to the
zillion candles you placed everywhere to "set
die mood." You may think that all the special
touches on your anniversary / celebration
make it more meaningful, but they may
build up too much pressure on your partner
to make everything perfect. Guys would just
as soon fall into bed with you on any old bor
ing day of the week.
Squeaky-dean canoodling: Even the horniest

guy is distracted when a girl is more concerned
with keeping hersoo-thread count sheets pristine
than having a g(xxl time between them. Rushing
to change the bed linens right after the act is a sure
mood-killer. It's more likely that he wants to cud
dle afterwards, maybe go fora second round, not
lunge for die shower. Put down the Febreeze and
back away from the paper towels.
Dead-fish fornication: I'm pretty sure that
between the Kama Sutra and the ingenious
writers of Cosmopolitan magazine, you won 't
find a position that calls for you to lie stiffly on
your back, arms frozen at your sides, while
staring holes into the ceiling. When diere's
erotic positions out there like the "Booty
Bridge," "Randy Rider" and the "Carnal
Clench," there's simply no excuse for just lying
there and taking it. You don't have to compete
with the gravity defying antics of porn stars.
Unenthusiastic, motionless sex appeals only to
necrophiliacs. You've got a pulse, so act like it!
Hop on top. Be frisky, dammit.
