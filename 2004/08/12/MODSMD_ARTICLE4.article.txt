## Tourism hot during August month 
### SARH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
Every year over 1 ()(),()()() tourists
and prospective students stream
through Stanford campus, often at
tending a campus tours or stopping
by Hoover Tower for the sweeping
view; of these, approximately 60 per
cent come during the summer, and
the busiest time of the summer is the
first two weeks of August.
"Visitors come with a wide range of
interests and we try to accommodate
their many needs," said Director of
Visitor Information Services (VIS)
Andrea Paz Frost. "However, it they
leave only knowing one thing, we
want them to understand that Stan
ford is a great place to be, whether as
student, as a parent of a student or as
general community member."
In order to achieve this goal, the

VIS otters a wide variety of tours
ranging from a general public

walking tour to a five
person golf-cart tour.
On some days, the VIS
conducts tours at eight
distinct times, with up
to 24 sub-groups, al
lowing fora more per
sonalized experience.
General public walk
ing tour occurs twice a
day and are open to any
one who shows up. The
tour gives a broad look at
Stanford, touring Memo
rial Auditorium, the Sci
ence and Engineer
Court, and Memorial
Church, as well as the

main Quad, the libraries and White
Plaza. Guides discuss everything from
the history of Stanford to student life,

although much of the content de
pends on the audience.

tour is dictated by the questions," said
Jennifer Bland, a VIS student manager.
The other popular tour, which has
only been offered since January of 2002,
is designed for prospective undergradu
ate students and takes place twice a day
Monday through Friday, as part of a larg
er program called Discover Stanford. As
many as 120 people may be present fora
session, with as many as six tour guides.
Paz Frost describes this as a less scenic
route, but one that caters more to the in
formation discussed: specifically acade
mics, residential life and extracurricular
activities. Accordingly, this tour shows
prospective students and their families
such locations as Stern Hall, White Plaza
and the main Quad. The size of the cam
pus makes it difficult for the tour to cover
everything prospective students might
like to see, and as it is the tour is a mile
and a half long. Though several topics are
discussed throughout the tour, academics
remain central to the focus.

Prospective students often are curious
about their chances of being accepted and
often ask about "the formula" (there is no
formula) that gets a student accepted.
"Sometimes they will ask their tour
guide what their SAT scores were," Paz
Frost said, noting that the question of
how hard it is to get in can manifest itself
in many ways.
Other frequently asked questions in
clude those about specific areas of acade
mic study and the living situation, as well
as questions about being a student.
"A lot [of the questions are] just to verity
that what we talk about is really our experi
ence," said Jeff Lu, a VIS student manager.
Lu is one of many students who, dur
ing their undergraduate years, became a
tour guide — a process which involves an
initial 15 hours of training as well as read
ing a large manual.
"I think the part [of being a tour guide]
I like most is meeting all the people," Lu
said. "By the end of the tour, you Find out
all sorts of things about them."
Paz Frost noted that she hopes the tours
inform visitors about Stanford, but that
above all, "Stanford is distinctive and offers
a wealth of opportunities for its students.
