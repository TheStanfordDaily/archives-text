# Program reaches out to small minority
## 
### SARH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
When Whitney Laughlin was a col
lege counselor at the Native Ameri
can Preparatory School 10 years ago,
the only post-secondary programs
that were available for native students
were either career-oriented or fo
cused entirely on recruitment.
"There wasn't really anything for
really motivated students that want
ed to go further than community col
lege," Laughlin said.
The problem existed on the col
lege side, too; Laughlin was contact
ed by several colleges that wanted to
know where to find Native American
students — an especially difficult feat
because approximately 65 percent of
Native Americans do not live on a

reservation, according to Laughlin.
Laughlin decided to set up a pro
gram that would bring together
many of the highest-achieving native
students with college admissions offi
cers that wanted to reach out to the
population. She founded the pro
gram, College Horizons, in 1994
with 45 students and has now ex
panded the program to reach over
150 students who travel to one of
three campuses for the five-day col
lege preparatory event. Stanford
participates in all three programs.
"The goals of the program are two
fold," said Stanford's Assistant Dean
of Undergraduate Admission Jarrid
Whitney. "There is the recruitment
side of it, but my goal is really to edu
cate students on how to apply to col
leges ... If they get interested in

Stanford, that's great, but it's really a
by-product."
During the five day residential
program, students work on test
preparatory skills, begin the process
of filling out the Common Applica
tion, work on a personal statement
and decide which colleges interest
them most.
One of the most important steps,
selecting the colleges of interest, takes
into consideration the financial status
of the student as well as their interests
and high school performance.
" I give them a list of 15 schools and
say 'narrow them down to 10,' "
Laughlin said. "When they come
back with their 10, I ask them why
they chose them."
The intensive sessions are inter-
spersed with skits and lighter activities.
One such skit called "Building Relation
ships with Colleges" acts out a mock inter
view and college fair, each time showing
appropriate behavior and contrasting it
with inappropriate behavior.
As well as representatives from Stan
ford, College Horizons features admis
sions officers from Harvard University,
Yale University, Princeton University,
Dartmouth College, Cal Tech, MIT and
many more, totaling representatives from
nearly 35 high-profile colleges.
The program only costs students $100,
so College Horizons has to cover most of
the expenses. Universities cover half of
the program, but the other half comes
from independent funding. The grant

that Laughlin most recently received for
the program expires soon.
According to The New York Times,
Native Americans make up one percent
of the U.S. population, but are under
represented at most colleges. At Stan
ford however, approximately three per
cent of the student body is Native Amer
ican, according to Whitney. Still, the
ethnic group is smaller than most mi
nority groups on campus, and is com
prised of American Indians, Alaska Na
tives and Native Hawaiians.
The program has been very successful,
and approximately 98 percent of the stu
dents in College Horizons attend a four
year college, according to Laughlin. She
also notes that it has been a great experi
ence for her.
"I could be making a lot more money,"
Laughlin said. "But at the end of the day
this is so gratifying...We are building a
community in the academic world where
it hasn't existed."
