### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
The Democratic National Conven
tion offered a chance for party loyalists,
lobbying groups and an entire new gen
eration of voters — including Stanford
students — to rally behind presidential
hopeful John Kerry. The four-day
event took place at the Boston Fleet
Center from July 26 through July 29
and included the faces ot a handful of
Stanford Democrats.
The College Democrats of America,
the official Democratic Party outreach

group for higher education students,
organized a number of events through
out the Convention that linked seven
Stanford students with their Democrat
ic peers from across the country.
One of the Stanford students attend
ing the Convention, rising Senior Mat
tie Hutton, described the College De
mocrats of America as a "large network
ing organization."
"The College Democrats of America
coordinated plans and gave a bigger
presence to the various Democratic col-
lege groups attending the con
vention," Hutton said.
CDA events included training on

voter outreach and speakers such as
former Democratic presidential
hopeful Reverend A1 Sharpton and
former California gubernatorial
hopeful Arianna Huffington.
"Every person you ran into made
you feel like you were in an alternate
universe," described senior Aaron

Levenstadt, another Stanford stu
dent in attendance. "Everywhere
you turned there were senators, ac
tors, musicians. J ust being in that en
vironment, with all that energy, was
like being on Cloud Nine."
Stanford students were given the
opportunity not only to see but inter
act with a number of prominent fig
ures in die Democratic Party. Leven
stadt described encounters with
Hillary Clinton while the president of
the Stanford Democrats, Kai Stinch
combe, who is also a column contribu
tor to The Weekly, spoke with Bobby

Kennedy Jr. about fixing media bias.
The Stanford students in atten
dance relayed a sense of inspiration
brought forth from die convention.
"It's always been clear that Kerry
lias what it takes to be a president,
but the convention made it clear
that he also has what it takes to be
come the president," Stinchcombe
said. "This election is the most im
portant political decision of our
generation, so it's good to see that
the party is more energized than we
have been in decades."
Stanford students also left rein

vigorated for future political activity.
"It was great to reaffirm with
other experienced people that
we are on the right track," said
Hutton, who heads Stanford for
Kerry. "We feel more confident
about our plans for the fall."
There was a unanimous sense
of hope and awe from the Stan
ford crowd. Many compared the
convention to an extreme sport
ing event, bringing out the big
party names in a Boston arena.
ITie Stanford students hope to
carry their enthusiasm through the
fall by organizing various speaker
events and voter outreach in states,
including Oregon and Nevada. With
support from key figures in the party
and students from across the coun
try, the Convention fostered a
shared sense of purpose for Democ
rats from Stanford.
The convention truly empha
sized the greatness of the human
spirit," Levenstadt said. "I left
every night feeling like 1 had to
do something."
