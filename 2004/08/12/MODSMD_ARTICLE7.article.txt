# Anti-HIV project headed by alumni

### ELIZABETH AGUILAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
A group of Stanford alumni have taken a step
toward stopping the spread of serious disease, in
cluding HIV, during surgical procedures. Special
Devices Medical Incorporated recently developed
a new line of surgical instruments meant to pre
vent sharp injuries.
The company, headed by CEO Joseph Spranza,
has spent the last three years working intensively to
bring safer instruments to the 8,700 plus hospitals
that practice surgery. Last month Special Devices
filed with the FDA to set up clinical trials for its tools
in its attempt to make the medical workplace safer.
"The company's main goal is to make a differ
ence by advancing the field of surgery ... so the
end results are better," said Spranza, a 1974 Stan
ford Honors Co-Op graduate.
One of the main problem doctors encountered
with surgical instruments took place when there
was leaking blood to be collected and saved with a
trocar, a sharp six inch curved instrument used to
drain bodily fluids. According to Spranza, there is
a desire among doctors to know what is going on
within the surgical site once it is closed.
"When you're pushing something through the
[dense] surface, you never know where it's coming
out," Spranza said. " When it's coming through tis
sue, the trocar is bloody. Here is where the problem
is. If you get a scratch or a prick and the patient has
a serious disease, you can contract the disease."
After many cases in the United States in which
doctors and nurses were getting hurt from sharp
injuries, the company decided to focus attention
on the problem. Four years ago Dr. Robert Namba
came up with the concept of a safer line of tools and
presented it to Spranza who realized its impor
tance. With the passing of the legislation H.R.
5178, or the Federal Needlestick Safety Prevention
Act in 2001, the company was allowed to work to
wards creating safer instruments, with Spranza
heading up the design team.
The team of doctors, whom
Spranza calls "water walkers"
because of their achievements,
felt "tremendous jubilation" ac

cording to the chief scientist.
Working with the Center for
Disease Control and the Ameri
can Hospital Corporation, Spe
cial Devices believes it has dri
ven the solution to one of the
most important problems in
medicine — the spread of infec
tion, such as with the AIDS
virus, during surgery.

"lt's a very exciting story,
Spranza said. "We're all very fasci
nated by it."
Special Devices formed 10
years ago when a small group of
orthopedic surgeons — most
former students of the Universi
ty — got together. Unhappy
with the slow pace of large com
panies, such as Johnson and

Johnson, had in developing in
struments, Special Devices
worked to improve the pace.
The company, based in Grass
Valley, Calif., now sells over 200
line items in 15 different families
and has 25 employees working
across the nation. Its instruments
are used in surgeries at hospitals
such as Kaiser, Mt. Sinai, Stan

ford and John Hopkins.
Spranza expects other compa
nies to notice the breakthrough he
and his companions have made.
He hopes large companies try to
compete in the patent process,
working similarly towards advance
ments in the field, instead of spend
ing revenue on promotions unre
lated to the medical workplace.
