Physicists moved steps closer to ex
plaining the reason for solely matter
comprising our universe following an
Aug. 2 experiment at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center. The results of the
Baßar experiment at SLAC, the labora
tory owned by the Department of Energy
and run by Stanford, announced striking
differences in the behavior of matter ver
sus antimatter.
"This is a major experiment at the labo
ratory. From conception to operation it's

been 11 years now,' 1 said spokesman-elect of
the Baßar experiment David MacFarlane.
"At present, the experiment involves 600
physicists from 10 different countries. It's
an exciting environment where many dif
ferent experiences come together to focus
on the experiment."
With the universe's inception following
the Big Bang, matter and antimatter were
found in equivalent amounts, scientists ex
plain. Vet the universe is now formed of
only matter. Though scientists have always
hypothesized that the behavior of matter
