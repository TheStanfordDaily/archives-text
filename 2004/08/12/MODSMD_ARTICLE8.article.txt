# SLAC physicists may soon answer why universe only consists of matter
## 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
Physicists moved steps closer to ex
plaining the reason for solely matter
comprising our universe following an
Aug. 2 experiment at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center. The results of the
Baßar experiment at SLAC, the labora
tory owned by the Department of Energy
and run by Stanford, announced striking
differences in the behavior of matter ver
sus antimatter.
"This is a major experiment at the labo
ratory. From conception to operation it's

been 11 years now,' 1 said spokesman-elect of
the Baßar experiment David MacFarlane.
"At present, the experiment involves 600
physicists from 10 different countries. It's
an exciting environment where many dif
ferent experiences come together to focus
on the experiment."
With the universe's inception following
the Big Bang, matter and antimatter were
found in equivalent amounts, scientists ex
plain. Vet the universe is now formed of
only matter. Though scientists have always
hypothesized that the behavior of matter
and antimatter must explain the
disparity, the Baßar experiment
elucidates the phenomenon of
charge parity violation — one of
the three conditions that ac
counts for the matter anti-matter
imbalance as outlined by Russian
physicist Andrei Sakharov.
Charge parity violation oc
curred in the Baßar experi
ment when the number of B
mesons and their anti-B meson
counterparts decayed at differ
ent rates. SLAC used their PEP
II accelerator, colliding elec
trons and positrons (their anti
matter version) to produce B
and anti-B mesons.
"If there were no difference
between matter and antimatter,
both the B meson and the anti-
B meson would exhibit exactly
the same pattern of decays.
However, our new measure
ment shows an example of a
large difference in decay rates
instead," clarified physicist at
Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nu
cleare (INFN) and the Univer
sity of Pisa Mercello Giorgi in a
press release.
While 910 B mesons de
cayed, scientists found only 696
anti-B mesons decaying at the
conclusion of the experiment.
The drastic asymmetries re
vealed by the Baßar experi
ment are the first results in B
particles obtained by simply
counting the number of matter
and antimatter decays, other
wise known as direct charge
parity violation.
I he results were published in
the journal Physical Review Let
ters. The findings are a stepping
stone for discovering why the
visible world is only matter, a
subject that SIAC will continue
to pursue.
"I think what we're really
hoping to do is to discover
some new physics that doesn't
fit current theoretical predic
tions," said Jeff Rich man, the
physics coordinator for the
Baßar experiment. "We've
measured a large number of
things, and have attained a co
herent picture of the behavior
of matter and antimatter. But
the universe is still telling us
that we're missing something,
and our ultimate goal is to fig
ure out what."
