## WEST OF CENTER Nader, Kerry, McCain and the Democratic Convention; Kai answers all your questions 
### 
Dear Kai:
Rhetoric aside, it's clear that — like in 2000 —
Nader will take more votes from Kerry than Bush, and so
could be once again be one of many factors causing Bush
to be elected. But won't a challenge from the left force
Kerry to defend his base by adopting more progressive
stances on the issues?

Treasured Reader:
Sometimes this works. When it seemed in 2000 that
Bush might be too compassionate and not conservative

enough, Pat Buchanan decided to
run and probably forced Bush to
shore up his conservative bonafides.
(Hm, funny that Buchanan didn't
bother running in 2004 . . . ) John
Kerry, however, is a genuine pro
gressive on almost any issue — just
look at his Senate record. In the end,
every vote on the left that goes to
Nader is one more centrist Kerry
will need to attract. Kerry will be as
progressive as he can get away with,

and as centrist as he needs to be to
win the election. While Nader votes might have pulled
a Gore or Clinton to the left, in 2004 they will push
Kerry to the center.
Dear Kai:
John Kerry seems like a flip-flopper who will take
both sides on any issue just to get re-elected. Of course
I'm not going to vote for Bush, but it's hard to get excit
ed about Kerry. Why can't he make up his mind?
Treasured Reader:
The flip-flopper charge is baloney. In Congress,
you don't get to vote for the plan you like best, you
vote yes or no on the bill in front of you. So, for exam
ple, if you believe that Saddam is a serious threat, that
inspections need time to work, that it doesn't make
sense to invade without a real international coalition,
and that misleading the American people about the
cost of the Iraq war and then adding it into a half-tril
lion dollar deficit is wrong, how do you vote? Well, you
probably vote to authorize force, you vote for an
amendment that takes the cost of the Iraq war out of
the tax cut rather than borrowing money for it, and
then you vote against the appropriation when the
amendment fails.
This does mean that he voted against a bill that would
have paid for body armor for the troops — a provision,
incidentally, left out by the Bush administration and
added by congressional Democrats — but that's because
of the appropriations bill that provision was in. If the bill
had been to give body armor to troops and require a per
sonal note from John Ashcroft in order to purchase con
traception, the Republicans would nail him about voting
against the troops. He was voting against passing the cost
of Iraq war failures on to the next generation, not against
supporting our troops.
Two more quick points: When Bush was asked to
name one mistake he'd made, he said he couldn't think
of anything. It's a fine line between being proud that you
never change your mind and being proud that you never

learn anything. And as for the "saying whatever's popu
lar" charge, the main justification for democracy is that
politicians will only get elected if they promise to do what
the people want. Adopting popular policies is, in this
view, a good thing.
Dear Kai:
I just wish John McCain would run.
Treasured Reader:
I'm glad you brought this up. McCain has good
odds to run in 2008, so it's high time to start cutting
through the John McCain mythology. It says a lot about
the Republican party that you can get as distinguish
yourself as much as McCain has just by talking straight
and making the personal sacrifices you demand of
everyone else. John McCain is not a liar or a hypocrite,
but he's still a conservative Republican. Consider how
he stands on the issues:
— Wants to overturn Roe v. Wade, prosecute doc
tors who provide abortions, deny coverage for those who
can't afford abortions and ban even privately-funded
abortions from military bases or military personnel serv
ing overseas.
— Described the Confederate flag flying over the
South Carolina statehouse as "a symbol of heritage"
rather than a racist relic.
— When asked whether the Ten Commandments
should be posted in schools, said that the virtues exem
plified in the Ten Commandments "could be and should
be taught in every school in America"; supports "absti
nence education."
— Voted against including sexual orientation as a
protected category in hate crimes legislation and voted to
allow businesses to discriminate against gay employees.
— Wants to broaden the use of the death penalty to
help deter crime, including drug crimes, and wants to in
crease penalties including mandatory minimum sen
tences for selling drugs. Voted against the assault
weapons ban.
Dear Kai:
I heard you went to the Democratic Convention?
What's the news?
Treasured Reader:
1) John Kerry has learned a lot about connecting
with a crowd, but Bush is so lucky he doesn't have to run
against Clinton.
2) Barak Obama will be president someday.
3) Bush has got to be kicking himself for pandering to
the religious right on stem cells. He's on the wrong side of
history. Toni Morrison's take: "The Republicans are offer
ing medieval solutions to twenty-first century problems."
4) The Kerry daughters rock. It says a lot about
Kerry that he raised such an ass-kicking family while
Bush the 40-year-old alcoholic could only come up with
Jenna and Barbara.
5) Ignore the pundits, A1 Sharpton is worth listening
to. The transcripts are no good, find the audio or
video online.

Dear Kai:
I heard you went to the Democratic Convention?
What's the news?
Treasured Reader:
1) John Kerry has learned a lot about connecting
with a crowd, but Bush is so lucky he doesn't have to run
against Clinton.
2) Barak Obama will be president someday.
3) Bush has got to be kicking himself for pandering to
the religious right on stem cells. He's on the wrong side of
history. Toni Morrison's take: "The Republicans are offer
ing medieval solutions to twenty-first century problems."
4) The Kerry daughters rock. It says a lot about
Kerry that he raised such an ass-kicking family while
Bush the 40-year-old alcoholic could only come up with
Jenna and Barbara.
5) Ignore the pundits, A1 Sharpton is worth listening
to. The transcripts are no good, find the audio or
video online.

Dear Kai:
Rhetoric aside, it's clear that — like in 2000 —
Nader will take more votes from Kerry than Bush, and so
could be once again be one of many factors causing Bush
to be elected. But won't a challenge from the left force
Kerry to defend his base by adopting more progressive
stances on the issues?

Treasured Reader:
Sometimes this works. When it seemed in 2000 that
Bush might be too compassionate and not conservative

enough, Pat Buchanan decided to
run and probably forced Bush to
shore up his conservative bonafides.
(Hm, funny that Buchanan didn't
bother running in 2004 . . . ) John
Kerry, however, is a genuine pro
gressive on almost any issue — just
look at his Senate record. In the end,
every vote on the left that goes to
Nader is one more centrist Kerry
will need to attract. Kerry will be as
progressive as he can get away with,

and as centrist as he needs to be to
win the election. While Nader votes might have pulled
a Gore or Clinton to the left, in 2004 they will push
Kerry to the center.
Dear Kai:
John Kerry seems like a flip-flopper who will take
both sides on any issue just to get re-elected. Of course
I'm not going to vote for Bush, but it's hard to get excit
ed about Kerry. Why can't he make up his mind?
Treasured Reader:
The flip-flopper charge is baloney. In Congress,
you don't get to vote for the plan you like best, you
vote yes or no on the bill in front of you. So, for exam
ple, if you believe that Saddam is a serious threat, that
inspections need time to work, that it doesn't make
sense to invade without a real international coalition,
and that misleading the American people about the
cost of the Iraq war and then adding it into a half-tril
lion dollar deficit is wrong, how do you vote? Well, you
probably vote to authorize force, you vote for an
amendment that takes the cost of the Iraq war out of
the tax cut rather than borrowing money for it, and
then you vote against the appropriation when the
amendment fails.
This does mean that he voted against a bill that would
have paid for body armor for the troops — a provision,
incidentally, left out by the Bush administration and
added by congressional Democrats — but that's because
of the appropriations bill that provision was in. If the bill
had been to give body armor to troops and require a per
sonal note from John Ashcroft in order to purchase con
traception, the Republicans would nail him about voting
against the troops. He was voting against passing the cost
of Iraq war failures on to the next generation, not against
supporting our troops.
Two more quick points: When Bush was asked to
name one mistake he'd made, he said he couldn't think
of anything. It's a fine line between being proud that you
never change your mind and being proud that you never

learn anything. And as for the "saying whatever's popu
lar" charge, the main justification for democracy is that
politicians will only get elected if they promise to do what
the people want. Adopting popular policies is, in this
view, a good thing.
Dear Kai:
I just wish John McCain would run.
Treasured Reader:
I'm glad you brought this up. McCain has good
odds to run in 2008, so it's high time to start cutting
through the John McCain mythology. It says a lot about
the Republican party that you can get as distinguish
yourself as much as McCain has just by talking straight
and making the personal sacrifices you demand of
everyone else. John McCain is not a liar or a hypocrite,
but he's still a conservative Republican. Consider how
he stands on the issues:
— Wants to overturn Roe v. Wade, prosecute doc
tors who provide abortions, deny coverage for those who
can't afford abortions and ban even privately-funded
abortions from military bases or military personnel serv
ing overseas.
— Described the Confederate flag flying over the
South Carolina statehouse as "a symbol of heritage"
rather than a racist relic.
— When asked whether the Ten Commandments
should be posted in schools, said that the virtues exem
plified in the Ten Commandments "could be and should
be taught in every school in America"; supports "absti
nence education."
— Voted against including sexual orientation as a
protected category in hate crimes legislation and voted to
