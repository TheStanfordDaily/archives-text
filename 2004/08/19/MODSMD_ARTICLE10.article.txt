## HOLT'S HARANGUE Chris goes underwear shopping, but it's not what you think... 
### 
A couple of weekends ago, I went shop
ping. This only occurs twice a year.
Every time, I'm either conned into
doing it by an attractive friend of the
opposite sex or I have run out of deodorant.
Lucky for her, it was only the former.
So my friends Rate and Maggie went with
me to a mall. Kate's objective, and I'm not mak
ing this up, was to buy a thong. I know what
you're thinking, so stop. She needed it for her
school's fundraiser, an annual fashion show. It
was fora good cause, you pervert.

The three of us went
down to the local Victori
a's Secret. I, like many
men, consider this a holy
shrine. It is a fact of life
that any heterosexual
man would love to be
taken to Victoria's Secret
with the intention of his
female companion mod
eling the clothes. Further
more, most guys believe

that the models in the magazines actually live in
the store, walking up and the down the aisles
asking, "Does my bikini line show?" The models
have legs as thin and straight as pencils. After a
hard day of work they are folded like Trans
formers and stocked in boxes.
So Kate, Maggie and I walked around the
store. We walked around aisle after aisle of un
derwear. Victoria's big secret is apparently a
fondness for undergarments. Freud would
have had a ball. The store is swathed in pink.
Everything is pink, the walls, the hangers, the
floor, some of the clothes, the lips on model
Tyra Banks. Where was I again?
Thongs. That's right. Well, Kate finally
found the thongs. We actually had walked past
them before, mistaking them for bracelets.
Being the complete social idiot that I am, I held
up the garments in question for further examina

tion. Some were pink, some were black and some
were red. And some had zebra stripes on them. It
seemed ludicrous to me that an entire rare animal
was killed for the hair thin piece of under gar
ment. Fortunately, I examined this further, and
realized it was not real zebra. By then, however,
every employee in the store was giving me looks.
So I put away my magnifying glass.
Kate wouldn't actually let me see her wear
the thongs in question. Hut she bought a few, all
reasonably priced at $15. That means she gets
one square centimeter of clothing for every dol
lar. Sounds like a deal to me. Especially since it
onlv costs a dollar extra if you want something
classy written on it like "Angel."
Waiting in line, our shopping done, one
thing caught my eve. They had ads in the store,
hung right above the cashiers. Pictured was a
beautiful woman in her under-roos, with the
slogan "Very Sexy." I think this speaks volumes
about the subtlety of advertising these days.
They don't want to leave a doubt in your mind.
That's what the "very" is for. Next year's cam
paign, I've heard, will further drive home the
point. They want to corner the market on het
erosexual horny males: Their begging will drive
their girlfriends to shop exclusively at Victoria's
Secret. Chic and tasteful forty-foot neon signs
will promote every slogan. The phrase "Very
Very" may make a comeback. Braille will be on
every centerfold.
Needless to say, I made a complete jerk of
myself in the store. And the employees didn't
like me much. My comment of "I'm not getting
the support 1 need. Do you have anything in my
size?" was met with blank stares. And my asking:
"Where is the underwear section?" led to my
being escorted out. This experience has dis
proved my deep belief that underwear, no mat
ter what the circumstances, is always funny.
