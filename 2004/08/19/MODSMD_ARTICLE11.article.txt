## Broadening what's meant by 'school' 
### PAUL T. HILL 
To be effective, schools serving poor children must do a lot. They can't assume
that their children come to first grade knowing that letters make sounds or that
older children get family support to do homework. It's not enough to provide co
herent and interesting instruction. Schools that serve the disadvantaged must mo
tivate and compensate as well as instruct.
Schools in which children and teachers occupy the same space five hours a day, five
days a week can be enough for children who have lots of support. But they aren't enough
for children disadvantaged bv poverty, violence or lack of English-language skills.
The most successful schools for poor children keep much longer days (nine to
12 hours) and include nutritional, health, counseling and recreational programs
designed to compliment instruction.
The value of such an approach may be seen in the Knowledge Is Power Program
(KIPP), developed for middle schools by Teach for America alumni to serve poor
Hispanic children, and the Beacons' middle-school network. Religious groups have
also created similar schools for poor children. The Jesuits' Nativity schools, for ex
ample, provide moral instruction (actions have consequences, what you become is
up to you) and organize sports and fun. By adding hours to the school day, they also
ensure that students are available for extra tutoring and supervised homework.
If these schools aren't the ultimate solution to the education of poor city children, thev
are a big step toward it. Unfortunately, they are hard to reproduce. They put big burdens
011 teachers, and they need adults in school for 12 hours each day, not just five or six.
By expanding the meaning of school, KIPP and similar programs also expand the
costs. It costs a great deal more money to run a school nine to 12 hours a day, rather
than six and to develop integrated learning-focused approaches to instruction,
recreation, and family services. Today, KIPP and similar schools live on donations.
Even when they operate as charter schools and receive public funding, such schools
must draw as much as one-third of their income from foundations and businesses.
But philanthropic support isn't adequate to reach the millions of city children
now in narrowly defined six-hour schools. We have to find a way to support en
larged schools with public funds.
The extra money could come from funds normally used to support separate
health and social service agencies, which would require a wrenching change in so
cial services. Funds that now sustain separate social service agencies would go in
stead to schools, such as KIPP, that serve as comprehensive service providers.
Schools would then be more like parishes than government agencies, able to draw
from aw ider array of expertise — and to spend more money — is available to sup
port their purely instructional roles.
Effective schools for poor children require more money than is available lor
other schools and more than is in the education budget. But increasing school-spe
cific spending is not necessarily the right answer. We need to make much better
use of the funds available for vouth services.
