## College admissions should be based on merit 
### PATRICK MATTIMORE 
Commenting about the elder Cieorge Bush in
1988 at the Democratic National Convention, Jim
Hightower, a political commentator from Texas, re
marked that Bush was "born on third base and thinks
he hit a triple." Nice coattails for our current president.
I he current President Bush has enjoyed lega
cy breaks beginning with his admission to Yale
clear through to his appointment as commander
in-chief by the Supreme Court in 2000.
Some people have gone further to suggest the
president has benefitted from affirmative action of
a divine design.
Joe Conason, a columnist for the New York
Observer asked mockingly in an Aug. 17 article,
"Is George W. Bush God's President?" He cited as
authority for that fanatical proposition former
N.Y. mayor Rudolph Giuliani who remarked last
year that "there was some divine guidance in the
president being elected."
For those of us inclined to accept more pedes
trian explanations for the fact that we now have as
our chief executive a man of inherited privilege,
Bush's pronouncement two weeks ago to a conven
tion of minority journalists that we should do away
with legacy admissions was astounding. Perhaps
even more perplexing is why those remarks, though
widely reported the day after they were made, have
escaped serious analysis since that time.
The president was asked by syndicated colum
nist Roland Martin point blank: "So the colleges
should get rid of legacy?" The following response
and characterization quote is from The New York
Times: " 'Well, I think so,' said Mr.Bush, who is a
son, grandson, and also a father of Yale graduates.
'Yeah, I think it ought to be based on merit.' "
Bush elaborated his position by saying that
there should not be "a special exception for certain
people in a system that's supposed to be fair." So
why has there been virtually no follow-up to Bush's
call (that may be a little strong) to end admission
preferences for children of alumni?

Frankly, neither conservatives nor liberals want
to end legacy admissions. It is an illiberal secret that
admissions programs at our most prestigious uni
versities admit alumni children at rates two to four
times higher than nonlegacies. Legacy admits have
lower than average SAT scores and CPAs. Much like
students of color, they benefit from relaxed admis
sions standards; unlike minority students, legacies
do not wear a question mark acceptance tag upon
their skin. I hey get a free boost without the stigma.
Fake a look at the Stanford admissions Web
site. Go to the statistical profile and you will find a
host of information about the undergraduate Class
of 2007, including geography, academic qualifica
tions, applicants receiving aid and race. What you
won't find are statistics about legacy admissions.
While there has been a great deal of fuss over
the last 30 years about affirmative action, including
several Supreme Court Cases, affirmative action
for children of privilege has remained largely ob
structed from public view. Now that the president
has broached the subject, partisans on both sides
seem unwilling to confront the issue.
Liberal admissions, defenders of legacy prefer
ences profess that A) alumni contributions
depend upon them; B) propagating the system
builds a familial type loyalty to the institution;
and C) even if A) and B) are insufficient justifica
tion, the system works as a trade-ofT for other affir
mative action admits.
Conservatives, of course, believe in things like
birthrights. Why shouldn't dad be able to pass on
the keys to the academic kingdom in addition to
whatever else he might have that his offspring may
need or want?
I've no intention to debate the merits of either
side's arguments other than to point out my agree
ment with the president that preferential treatment
for legacies has no place in admissions policies sup
posedly based upon a system of meritocracy.
