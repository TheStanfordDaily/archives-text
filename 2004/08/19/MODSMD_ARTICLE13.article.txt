## Terrorism leaves no room for negotiation 
### THOMAS H. HENRIKSEN 
The nearly 600-page report
from the National Commission
on Terrorist Attacks Upon the
United States paints a disturb
ing picture of a government
largely unprepared for the sui
cide assaults on the World
Trade Center and the Penta
gon. But what it points to in the
future is even more chilling.
The report reminds us that
Osama bin Laden and his fellow
extremists are cold-blooded fa
natics and that no negotiations,
compromise, or appeasement
will placate them.
The 9/11 Commission re
port will be debated and dissect
ed for some time to come, help
ing us to better understand the
vast challenges we face. Perhaps
it, along with the daily news
from Baghdad, will at last pour
cold water on the assumption
that we are in another fledgling
Cold War-like struggle. The

current anti-terrorism cam
paign is not about deterrence,
containment or chess-like
moves on a global board.
Historical analogies are in
structive. Munich and Vietnam
still hold lessons about appease
ment and protracted conflicts in
peripheral areas. The battle
against Islamic fundamentalist
terrorism is not another Cold
War, however. Yes, it will drag
on for decades, like the Cold
War, and resemble aspects simi
lar to the Soviet standoff. Public
diplomacy — how America
spreads its message of hope,
democracy, and tolerance to the
world — will certainly be rekin
dled. Our anti-terrorism strug
gle will necessitate alliances and
occasional cooperation with un
savory regimes — all aspects of
the former East-West rivalry —
but it is not analogous.
The doctrine of preemp
tion, of striking before being at
tacked, is a fundamentally dif

ferent concept than the Cold
War restraint and is here to stay
no matter who wins the presi
dential election in November.
With American civilians and sol
diers dying by jihadi bullets and
beheadings, clearly we are in a
hot war, not the old, icy standoff
with Moscow.
Although the degree of pre
emptive attack should be
weighed soberly, terrorism can
not be prevented by defensive
measures. No White House oc
cupant can simply react to
events. Nuclear and biological
weapons in terrorist hands can
kill far too many people fora re
active posture; jihad upends the
former challenge and response
formula. A glacially paced
strategic response born of Cold
War thinking will not cool the
fires of jihad.
We may not engage in an
other ambitious Iraq war or even
an Afghanistan intervention.
America has already scaled down

to smaller preemptive actions
from these two major counter
terrorism ventures. The United
States is opening bare-bones
bases from which to launch pre
emptive attacks. Special Forces
teams have been deployed in a
globe-spanning belt stretching
from Latin America and the
Philippines through Central
Asia, East Africa and the
Maghreb to train local forces to
battle terrorists.
Future strategies to nip ter
rorist plots in the bud might in
clude surgical airstrikes, cloak
and-dagger operations and even
smash-and-dash commando
raids to take out nuclear facilities
or eliminate terrorist camps. The
old Cold War business as usual is
over and so should be the analo
gous thinking.
