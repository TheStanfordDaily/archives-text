McCarthy wrong on drug
testing in sports
The flaw in Dan McCarthy's
call for sports drug legalization to
solve the problem ("Eliminating
the doping problem," Aug. 12) is
that, in Olympic, top amateur
and professional sports, the test
ing does work when it is done —
that's why the busts are occur
ring — with good reason and
with good results.
And the positive test rates
even when everyone in an en
tire Olympics is tested, and
even for the newest drugs, are
one-half of 1 percent: that's
what it was in Salt Lake.
So the desperation isn't quite
merited when the system works.
And when you think that
what the big guns do is paralleled
by so many kids (a million teens
used steroids last year), it's really
important to set the model of
non-tolerance.
And why enforce this? Be
cause not only are these drugs
cheating, but they are highly
dangerous — just ask the
10,000 East Germans now
dying with diseases like liver
cancer, or Flo-Jo who died 10
years after competing with en
larged organs, a clear steroid
symptom, or Steve Bechler,
who died from ephedra heart
irregularities or the women
with irreversible hair on their
chests or the guys with shrunk
en testes. The euphoria of win
ning a competition in the mo
ment is hardly worth the life of
painful illness —or even the
face you see in the mirror for
cheating fora victory.
No we don't want to go to le
galization. Anarchy is not an an
swer to a problem.

Dan McCarthy's "Eliminat
ing the doping problem" (Aug.
12) argument — that we should
legalize performance enhanc
ing supplements — defies the
entire spirit of the Olympics
and would result in disastrous
consequences. We gaze in
amazement at Michael Phelps
or at Jenny Thompson because
they have spent years training
and are engaging in a culmina
tion of their hard work. Would
the sports be as amazing if we
knew that they had used
steroids? No — we'd think that
it was the drugs, not the ath
lete's hard work. We don't
"deadjen] the spirit of competi
tion" by banning the use of
these drugs — we actually save
the spirit. By legalizing the sup
plements, we would take away
from the athlete's glory.
McCarthy also makes the
case that athletes already make
huge sacrifices to their well-being
by practicing competitively. His
logic states that if they 're already
hurting themselves, why not
push them a little more? What he
fails to keep in mind is that legal
izing the drugs would pressure
athletes who had no intention of
ever touching the supplements
to try them. He's right — ath
letes are already under a great
amount of pressure, so why add
to that?
McCarthy may be one to
watch sports where athletes can
pop steroids like candy, but I'd
much prefer watching sports
where people train — not swallow
or inject — their way to victory.
