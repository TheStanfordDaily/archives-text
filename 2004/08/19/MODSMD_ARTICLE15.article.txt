## Steriods are no good for sports 
### 
I will now peel the skin off my body. That, a pop
ular saying of the great Bill Simmons, sports
writer for ESPN.com, was exactly my senti
ment a few afternoons ago after reading Dan
McCarthy's column advocating for the acceptance of
steroids in the Olympics.
McCarthy wrote such detritus as "the likelihood of
seeing records smashed by juiced athletes would
make ratings skyrocket, and. as we all know, the most
important name in sports is Nielsen. Those who sup
port only 'ethical' athletes who refuse to ingest mas
sive amounts of EPO or androstenedione or Japanese
hornet paste (seriously) would be far outnumbered
by people that would tune in just to see a Turk's veins
burst right out of his forearms while lifting the equiv
alent of a 1967 GTO," and "If a sprinter finishes the

100 meters in eight seconds and
then his heart pops like a zit,
more power to him."
McCarthy's basic argument is
that steroids are becoming more
and more prevalent and less
and less detectable, so in the
name of progress, record
breaking and popularity, why
not let Barry keep blasting into
the bay until he hits 65 when
he's 65? Why keep a dainty,
young Romanian shot-putter
from achieving her goal of a

gold medal and a mustache? Who are we to judge a
woman's right to puberty and a man's right to a
cabeza the size of a pumpkin?
Well, Dan, let me ask you something. W T hat hap
pens when steroids are legal, when a young athlete
values life over lifts and when his trainer decides to
make the opposite choice? What happens when a
country hostile to the United States (or insert a coun
try's main rival here, it just seems like we fit the bill
for most international folks) decides that one ath
lete's long term health is secondary to his emotional,
inspirational and patriotic performance at the
Olympics? What happens when Peter Griffin trains
Joe and sneaks steroids into his waterbottle?
I've said it before, I'll say it again: Let the Family
Guy be your guide.
I'll let my biases be known here. I don't like
Barry Bonds, thanks in some part to the chemical
cloud hanging over him, I didn't like the Sosa-McG
wire home run race, and I found it positively dis
gusting when baseball put Andro, the very chemical
that pumped through Big Mac's patties, on its
banned substances list this year without so much as
a press conference.
But mostly, I just don't like the appalling amount
of coercion, pressure and demands forced upon ath
letes today. I don't want to see the little league world
series won by a kid and his curveball. I don't want to
see 12-year-old gymnasts at the Karolyi Ranch. I
don't want to see a sprinter breaking the world
record while breaking the law.
These feats are fundamentally at odds with the
ideals of sports. For me, Ben Johnson, Mark McG
wire and everyone else on the juice gets placed in the
same athlete category as "Air-Bud" and his golden


Spencer Porter
receptions. They aren't human. Their
love is real, but they are not.
But Dan, there isn't a perfect answer
to this. As you and "Cool Runnings"
told us, not all countries have the same
resources for athletic competition —
financial, geographical and environ
mental. As you mention, a runner from
a third world country is going to have
a much tougher time making it to
Ath ens than a Nike-sponsored Floridi
an. And of course, at what drug do you
draw the line? Should a can of coke re

ally be illegal?
Dan, even I do not have the answers
here. That's why we place our trust in
those that have strived to do so: the
lOC. I don't claim that they are perfect,
but I'll take them over your Man vs.
Beast Olympics.
So call me naive, call me crazy, call me
Spencer, but an Olympic Gold should not
be an invitation fora young death. Well,
unless you peel the skin off your body.

gold medal and a mustache? Who are we to judge a
woman's right to puberty and a man's right to a
cabeza the size of a pumpkin?
Well, Dan, let me ask you something. W T hat hap
pens when steroids are legal, when a young athlete
values life over lifts and when his trainer decides to
make the opposite choice? What happens when a
country hostile to the United States (or insert a coun
try's main rival here, it just seems like we fit the bill
for most international folks) decides that one ath
lete's long term health is secondary to his emotional,
inspirational and patriotic performance at the
Olympics? What happens when Peter Griffin trains
Joe and sneaks steroids into his waterbottle?
I've said it before, I'll say it again: Let the Family
Guy be your guide.
I'll let my biases be known here. I don't like
Barry Bonds, thanks in some part to the chemical
cloud hanging over him, I didn't like the Sosa-McG
wire home run race, and I found it positively dis
gusting when baseball put Andro, the very chemical
that pumped through Big Mac's patties, on its
banned substances list this year without so much as
a press conference.
But mostly, I just don't like the appalling amount
of coercion, pressure and demands forced upon ath
letes today. I don't want to see the little league world
series won by a kid and his curveball. I don't want to
see 12-year-old gymnasts at the Karolyi Ranch. I
don't want to see a sprinter breaking the world
record while breaking the law.
These feats are fundamentally at odds with the
ideals of sports. For me, Ben Johnson, Mark McG
wire and everyone else on the juice gets placed in the
same athlete category as "Air-Bud" and his golden


Spencer Porter
receptions. They aren't human. Their
love is real, but they are not.
But Dan, there isn't a perfect answer
to this. As you and "Cool Runnings"
told us, not all countries have the same
resources for athletic competition —
financial, geographical and environ
mental. As you mention, a runner from
a third world country is going to have
a much tougher time making it to
Ath ens than a Nike-sponsored Floridi
an. And of course, at what drug do you
draw the line? Should a can of coke re

ally be illegal?
Dan, even I do not have the answers
here. That's why we place our trust in
those that have strived to do so: the
lOC. I don't claim that they are perfect,
but I'll take them over your Man vs.
Beast Olympics.
So call me naive, call me crazy, call me
Spencer, but an Olympic Gold should not
be an invitation fora young death. Well,
unless you peel the skin off your body.
