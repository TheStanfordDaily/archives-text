# Cardinal spirit's alive in Athens

### 
ATHENS —ESPN had dubbed
the men's 200-meter freestyle
race as the swimming race of the
generation, the biggest faceoff of
superstars we would likely ever watch. As I
sat in row 20 of the stands I wondered
what it was going to feel like to watch a race
of diat magnitude.
I snapped pictures as lan Thorpe,
Pieter van den Hoogenband and Michael
Phelps were introduced, and I felt butter-
Hies of anticipation in my stomach as they
stepped up to the blocks. I didn't have my
heart set on one of them to win, I just want
ed to see a good race.
I wasn't disappointed; I was on die edge
of my seat as I watched van den Hoogen
band, ahead for the first 175 meters, Phelps
strong off the wall and Thorpe kicking in
the last 25 meters to win the race in Olympic
record time. The entire crowd stood for the
last 50 meters and flashes went off like fire
flies in prime season.
"This is what commentators must be
talking about when they refer to 'the
Olympic moment,'" I thought as the
swimmers reached to touch the wall one,
two, three."This is why I've sat glued to the
TV in past years and why I've traveled 12
hours to watch the Olympics this year."
But the men's 200-meter freestyle was
only the third race of Monday evening and
Monday was only the fourth day of the
Games. I thought competition would be
anticlimactic after the 200 free, but to my
surprise, I was cheering louder for the
races and events that followed.
The men's 100-meter backstroke com
petitors marched out a few minutes later.
Recent Stanford grad Markus Rogan
came out in his Austria warmups and

began to stretch out his arms. When he was
introduced, I yelled "Go Stanford!" for the
first time in Athens.
I've yelled it coundess times at the foot
ball stadium, the soccer field, the track,
Maples, Avery and in front of the TV. I'm
afraid to say that the phrase suffers from
overuse on The Farm — cheering it used
to give me a warm, fuzzy feeling, but that
wore off after freshman year even if I
mixed up with a "Go Card!" or a "Go Stan
fy" every now and then.
But cheering "Go Stanford" at the
Olympics was an entirely different experi
ence. I'm not talking a warm, fuzzy feeling,
I'm talking a compulsion to jump up and
down, scream like it's a heavy metal con
cert and put on one of those one-piece red
numbers that die yell leaders wear in nine
ty-degree-plus heat.
I doubt diat anyone around me had
any idea what I was cheering for and I am
relatively sure the Greek couple behind
me thought I was off my proverbial rock
er. I was holding a Canadian flag since that
is my country of origin, yelling myself
hoarse for some Austrian, and hollering
about Stanford. Needless to say, I got some
confused looks.
Unfazed, I cheered on and stood up
as the swimmers neared the finish.
Rogan finished second and I swelled with
pride knowing that a swimmer from my
school had won an Olympic medal. Of
course I've never met Rogan or con
tributed in anyway to his success, but still
he is a classmate and he won an Olympic
medal. Wicked awesome.
I figured Rogan's silver was warming
up the pool for 2004 grad Tara Kirk, who
I had expected to take gold in the follow

ing race, the 200-meter breastroke.
More confused looks from spectators
came my way as Kirk stepped up to the
starting blocks. I rotated between cheering
"Go Stanford" and yelling "Kirk, Kirk,
Kirk!" as I watched her take out a strong
lead over the first 50 motel's. I was not in
terested in seeing a close race like the men's
200-meter free, I just wanted Kirk to hold
her lead, finish first and collect her gold.
Instead, I clenched my fists in nervous ex
citement as Kirk took a slow turn and began
to lose her lead. My confident "Go Stanford!'
cheer turned into a (rantic yelp of "Swim
faster, faster, fester Tara! Go! Cio! Go!"
She touched the wall in sixth place and
I sunk in my chair.
I felt terrible for my classmate. I imag
ined the thoughts that might be running
through her head. If the race had been 75
instead of 100 meters she would have won
gold. If she had swum her personal best
1:07.33 she would have won. But she had
swum her second-best time of 1:07.59 and
she was sixth.
Then I remeinl)ered what Kirk had said
at a Stanford awards banquet in June —
"They say when you're on the starting
blocks you're all alone ... but that's not true
... I see everyone who has ever supported
me standing beside me at the blocks."
I hoped that the finish line was the same
as the starting blocks.
And I decided it was time to reevaluate
my conception of 'the Olympic moment
— that elusive phrase that commentators
throw around and famous people try to
define in fancy quotes. A great competition
between three superstars no longer
seemed to capture that moment for me.
A short video clip of Nelson Mandela's de
finition popped up on the scoreboard at the
pool before Kirk's race. The Olympic mo
ment for Mandela was before the finish line
and before the race got close. It was the mo
ment where no nation was greater or small
er than the next — the moment right before
the competition began.
I felt satisfied with that interpretation
until I went to watch the next Olympic event
on my family's itinerary — men's synchro
nized springboard diving. I missed the very
start of the competition because the swim
ming ran late, but I am sure I didn't miss 'the
Olympic moment' at that venue.
lhe first four rounds of diving were relative
ly uneventful and after watching over twenty
dives, I was beginning to doze off— jump, flip,
splash, jump, flip, splash. The Chinese and Rus
sians were near perfect but none of the other
competitors were particularly spectacular. I fig
ured the gold and silver medals were pretty
much set in stone.
Wrong again. The Chinese botched their last
dive and received a score of zero of ten. The

Russians followed suit and earned mere threes
and fours. No one could believe it.
Just as my cheers for Kirk had frantically in
creased over the last 25 meters, the Greeks' cheers
for their countrymen climaxed as they watched
the top competitors open the door in the last
round of dives.
The Greek divers, who hadn't been pre
dicted to come close to even a bronze
medal, won their country's first Olympic
gold of these Games. Cheers of "Hellas"
pumped through the stadium, blue and
white flags were unleashed, and the gold
medalists got pushed in the pool during
their celebration.
"This," I thought, "mustlDe the Olympic moment"
But amid the chaotic excitement, I couldn't
help feeling sorry for the Chinese and Russian
divers who had essentially held gold in their
hands and let it slip away. Just like Kirk, I
thought their minds must be filled with that ter
rible phrase: "What if... "
1 suppose those "what ifs" and "but ifs" are
why we have swim races, diving meets and die
Olympic Games themselves. If the favourites al
ways won there would be no point in competing,
no excitement in sport, and perhaps no Olympic
moments — however vou want to define them.
