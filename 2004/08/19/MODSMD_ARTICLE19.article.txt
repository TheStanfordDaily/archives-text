## Dispatch disbands: 110,000 fans say bye at group's final show 
### ANDREW LEIFER INTERMISSION WRITER 
Only two days after John Kerry gave his speech and the dele
gates packed their bags for home, Boston was invaded yet again.
Over 110,000 students and fans from across the nation
swamped the subways, wrecked havoc on downtown traffic and
caused another security nightmare for local law enforcement
agencies. Unlike the delegates who attended the Democratic-
National Convention, these youthful idealists were not interest
ed in bettering our great nation through the political process.
They were here to rock out, smoke pot and to see Dispatch for
one last time, at what many are calling the best below-the-radar
concert of the summer.
Dispatch is well known among Stanford students for their
folksy rock and their commitment to simple thoughtful music.
They offer a refreshing relief from the commercial driven
music industry and they remain surprisingly true to their small
college roots.
Chad Urmston, Brad Corrigan and Pete Heimbold formed
Dispatch in 1996 while friends at Middlebury college. They
practiced on weekends and played at local gigs including frat
parties, keggers and the occasional bar mitzvah. Since then, they
have grown mosdy through word-of-mouth or the Internet.
Early on, the band embraced Napster and file-sharing and sig
nificantly increased their fan base.
By the time 2002 rolled around, Dispatch was performing at
major venues amidst rising popularity and pressure to sign on
to a record label. But band members grew uncomfortable with
their newfound success and the three disbursed fora two year
hiatus to pursue solo gigs. Before officially calling it quits, how
ever, the band decided to throw one last show, dubbed "The
Last Dispatch." This show would be free for all and was adver
tised on the Dispatch Web site and e-mail list. The band was
wholly unprepared for the ecstatic response.
Instead of the usual 8,000 fans that a Dispatch concert nor
mally attracts, an estimated 110,000 fans showed up the Hatch
Shell on the banks of the Charles River. According to The
Boston Globe some traveled from as far away as Saudi Arabia
and Australia.
"We know a lot of you have come a long ways to see us," U rm
chat announced to the crowd. "So to make up for it we're going
to pay fora real long time."
Dispatch played for three and a
half hours straight and the crowd
ate up every minute of it. Fans
threw water bottles, crowd surfed
and created a general ruckus.
Local TV news crews reported
that over 100 concert-goers were
hospitalized from dehydration or
other injuries.
Brother and sister Arian and
Shireen Lalezari of Boulder,
Colo., drove for 30 hours to make
the concert.
"They were amazing live,"
Shireen La said. "Everyone was re
ally into the band — you could tell
that there was a lot of love there."
"It was completely worth it,"

Arian added.
Starting with "Here we Go,"
the band cycled through almost
their entire repertoire of original
rock, hitting such favorites as
"Out Loud, rwo Coins" and
even a brand new song, "Ride a
Tear." Their sound bubbled from
reggae to folk, but tended to settle
somewhere between the free
flowing of a Phish jam and the
steady rhythm of a Jack Johnson
hit. Dispatch ended with "The
General," their best known song
about a seasoned war hero who is
dismayed by his fight and orders
his men home.
Fans that couldn't make it to
Boston still have one more chance
to catch Dispatch before they go.
The band will release a DVD of
The Last Dispatch concert in Octo
ber. And unlike the Democratic
National Convention, this is a per
formance worth reliving.
