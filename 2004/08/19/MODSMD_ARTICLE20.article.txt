# 'Napoleon Dynamite' proves that it has nothing to prove
## 
### SCOTT HOWARD INTERMISSION ONLINE FILM CRITIC 
Creating a convincing drama is
easy. We've all experienced pain, loss
and regret —just get some decent
actors to play it out on camera in a
halfway honest way and wait for the
awards to roll in. If you really want to
cement your credibility, get a good
cinematographer to film it so the au
dience will have nice pictures to look
at while they're absorbing the over
whelming emotion.
Comedy, on the other hand, is an
endlessly difficult genre that some
times makes curing cancer look easy.
People tell me that I'm funny, but I
don't think I could ever string to
gether material that would be strong
enough to make people chuckle for
90 minutes. And that's not even men
tioning the herculean task of making
a comedy appeal to a broad audience.
"Yes Dear" draws in tens of millions
of viewers every week on CBS, but
five seconds ofbasking in its sheer aw
fiilness is enough to send me into
convulsions. I thought Christopher
Guest's "A Mighty Wind" was easily
one of the best movies of last year, a
notion that causes some of my best
friends to furrow their brows and
stare at me in quiet confusion.
The fact of the matter is that no crit
ic can tell vou what is or isn't funny be
cause our senses of humor are so in
credibly different. W 7 e can witness this
undeniable truth in the case of
"Napoleon Dynamite," the debut film
by Jared Hess, which has inexplicably
emerged from the arthouse to invade
multiplexes. Hess basically creates
about a dozen or so bizarre characters

and puts them in situations where
they'll give perftxl recitations of perfect
lines that aren't so much quotable in
print as they are in person. This is due
to the dynamic physicality the actors
give their roles, especially Jon Heder as
tiie unicorn-sketching, gatorade-guz
zling, perpetually squinting antihero
of the tide. He films them in a retro
minimalism that recalls Wes Anderson
without overtly ripping him off.
I thought it was hilarious. So did
most of the audience. So did Ty Burr
ofThe Boston Globe, who called it "an
inspired dead-end stunt that keeps de
livering snarky laughs far longer than
it has any right to." Mary Ann Johan-

son of Flick Philoso
pher heaped on the
praise: "[an] end
lessly cheery film...
highly intellectually
involving." Roger
Moore of The Or
lando Sentinel sim
ply awarded it the
tide of "the funniest
film of the summer."
But others dis
agree. Roger Ebert
of the Chicago Sun-
Times is the highest
profile hater, re
marking, "There is
a kind of studied

stupidity that sometimes passes as
humor, and 'Napoleon Dynamite'
pushes it as far as it can go." Jeanne
Aufmuth of Palo Alto Weekly opts for
cheap provocation: "It mistakes in
sults for jests and racism for narrative
guile." Todd McCarthy of Variety
writes an entire review about the
film's condescending attitude and

then, I guess, attempts to demon
strate true condescension: " There
are lots of laughs for those who enjoy
the sight of bottom dwellers doing
stupid things that make them look
even more idiotic."
But these potent potables are
really just narcissistic salutes to the


writers' supposed wit. Every neg
ative review I've read of
"Napoleon Dynamite" forwards
the view that the film is bad be

cause Hess dislikes and mocks his
characters, a ridiculous and naive
assessment that sloppily disre
gards the film's storybook /
Utopian ending in which every
one ends up happy and, except
ing that, inadvertantly casts
Bergman, Kubrick and Dreyer as
hacks because they weren't al
ways rapturously in love with
their characters.

Forget all that, though. I'll tell
you what you need to know
about "Napoleon Dynamite" to
know whether or not you'll like
it. Did you like "Rushmore?"
Now imagine if it had no depth
and was just about making you
laugh. Would you like that? If so,
that movie is "Napoleon Dyna
mite." If not, watch "The Princess
Diaries 2" or something.

zling, perpetually squinting antihero
of the tide. He films them in a retro
minimalism that recalls Wes Anderson
without overtly ripping him off.
I thought it was hilarious. So did
most of the audience. So did Ty Burr
ofThe Boston Globe, who called it "an
inspired dead-end stunt that keeps de
livering snarky laughs far longer than
it has any right to." Mary Ann Johan-

son of Flick Philoso
pher heaped on the
praise: "[an] end
lessly cheery film...
highly intellectually
involving." Roger
Moore of The Or
lando Sentinel sim
ply awarded it the
tide of "the funniest
film of the summer."
But others dis
agree. Roger Ebert
of the Chicago Sun-
Times is the highest
profile hater, re
marking, "There is
a kind of studied

stupidity that sometimes passes as
humor, and 'Napoleon Dynamite'
pushes it as far as it can go." Jeanne
Aufmuth of Palo Alto Weekly opts for
cheap provocation: "It mistakes in
sults for jests and racism for narrative
guile." Todd McCarthy of Variety
writes an entire review about the
film's condescending attitude and

then, I guess, attempts to demon
strate true condescension: " There
are lots of laughs for those who enjoy
the sight of bottom dwellers doing
stupid things that make them look
even more idiotic."
But these potent potables are
really just narcissistic salutes to the


writers' supposed wit. Every neg
ative review I've read of
"Napoleon Dynamite" forwards
the view that the film is bad be

cause Hess dislikes and mocks his
characters, a ridiculous and naive
assessment that sloppily disre
gards the film's storybook /
Utopian ending in which every
one ends up happy and, except
ing that, inadvertantly casts
Bergman, Kubrick and Dreyer as
hacks because they weren't al
ways rapturously in love with
their characters.

Forget all that, though. I'll tell
you what you need to know
about "Napoleon Dynamite" to
know whether or not you'll like
it. Did you like "Rushmore?"
Now imagine if it had no depth
and was just about making you
laugh. Would you like that? If so,
that movie is "Napoleon Dyna
mite." If not, watch "The Princess
Diaries 2" or something.
