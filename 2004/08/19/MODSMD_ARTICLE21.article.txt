# Behind the sex and sass: Roxy contemplates the meaning of life

### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Dear readers, Roxy has a question
for you: Do you ever tire of reading
about sex? Sure, there's always a time
and a place for it, but we're not Ã¼ber
horny high schoolers anymore, and
there are plenty of other things to oc
cupy our minds these days. This isn't
a "Sex in the City" column, there
aren't cocktail parties to attend or
Manolo Blahniks to buy. Summer is
winding down and with it comes the
pang of loneliness that often accom

for dismal scores that were out long
before the budget was revealed?
Maybe if high schoolers stopped
thinking about getting laid, they
could finally figure out how to use the
Pythagorean theorem and decipher
the meaning of the word "inchoate."

After a recent visit to Disneyland and
Disney's California Adventure, Roxy
couldn't help but marvel at the in
sane amounts of overpriced sou

venirs for sale. I'm still perplexed
over the paradox of the Atomic
Wave brand "illuminated sunglass
es" complete with battery pack (avail
able in neon blue, red / orange, yel
low or green). If you're using the $20
glasses when it's sunny outside, it's
useless to turn them on. When it's
pitch dark and you're able to turn
them on (or flip the switch to the
seizure-inducing "strobe" option),
you would have more trouble navi
gating your way around with them
on than Helen Keller. So when, ex
