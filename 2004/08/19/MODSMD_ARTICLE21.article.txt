# Behind the sex and sass: Roxy contemplates the meaning of life
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Dear readers, Roxy has a question
for you: Do you ever tire of reading
about sex? Sure, there's always a time
and a place for it, but we're not Ã¼ber
horny high schoolers anymore, and
there are plenty of other things to oc
cupy our minds these days. This isn't
a "Sex in the City" column, there
aren't cocktail parties to attend or
Manolo Blahniks to buy. Summer is
winding down and with it comes the
pang of loneliness that often accom
panies a last fling. In a world where

rail-thin models with dark rimmed
eyes sell it with every thrust of their
sharp hipbones and sex tape scandals
ensure at least 15 minutes of fame,
people find that there's no substitute
for good old-fashioned contact com
fort (how else can you explain how
cuddle parties in mugging<apital-of
the-world NY are the newest bizarre
trend?). On a more contemplative
note, Roxy has been thinking about a
few more serious things lately:
California schools: California's el
ementary schools are showing mar
ginal improvements in reading and
math scores on standardized tests,

but high sch(X)ls are falling llat. Some
blame the governator's recent bud
get cuts on these poor performances,
but how can he be held responsible
for dismal scores that were out long
before the budget was revealed?
Maybe if high schoolers stopped
thinking about getting laid, they
could finally figure out how to use the
Pythagorean theorem and decipher
the meaning of the word "inchoate."
Glow-in-the-dark sunglasses:
After a recent visit to Disneyland and
Disney's California Adventure, Roxy
couldn't help but marvel at the in
sane amounts of overpriced sou

venirs for sale. I'm still perplexed
over the paradox of the Atomic
Wave brand "illuminated sunglass
es" complete with battery pack (avail
able in neon blue, red / orange, yel
low or green). If you're using the $20
glasses when it's sunny outside, it's
useless to turn them on. When it's
pitch dark and you're able to turn
them on (or flip the switch to the
seizure-inducing "strobe" option),
you would have more trouble navi
gating your way around with them
on than Helen Keller. So when, ex

acdy, is one able to take advantage of
what this dual function / fashion
statement has to offer? This does not
stop countless kids and adults from
shelling out the bucks for an other
wise useless gimmick.
Courtroom fashion: Michael
Jackson's snow-white outfit debuted
recently in Santa Maria, Calif..
Screaming "I am innocent" or at
least "Not guilty!" the designer suit
attempts to say what the Man in the
Mirror cannot. Honestly, does any
one fall for this none-too-subtle "vir
ginal / pure / sacrificial lamb / help
less victim of desires to play with lit
tle boys / reborn" statement? You
can be sure that master of overem

phasized symbolism himself,
William Golding (remember "Ix>rd
of the Flies"?), is rolling his eyes at
this attempt to win sympathy.
The sanctity of marriage: Yes,
the M word. And no, it's not the
monogamy that's the issue, it's
the alarming popularity of im
pulsive couples who are getting
hitched in Vegas these days. So
cialites and wannabe celebrities
are taking a leaf out of Britney's
book, perhaps in an attempt to
get more media exposure (be
cause all publicity is good public
ity, right?) Who gets married at
2:30 in the morning? Nicky
Hilton, that's who. The younger
and lesser-downloaded-on-the-
Internet sister of Paris married
Todd Andrew Meister in high
roller fashion at the Las Vegas
Wedding Chapel this weekend.
Is there no law against taking

marriage vows under the influ
ence of alcohol and other (possi
bly illicit) substances? I guess
there's no stress over finding a
hotel for the honey moon.
The word "colonel": I know that
it's pronounced "kernel" and not
how it looks, but damn it, coundess
schoolchildren have flunked spelling
tests because this word is so deceptive.
It has nothing to do with popcorn!
Oh screw it. Enough of Roxy's
random thoughts.You've probably
picked up a hobby or two out of
boredom since your internship
ended, so odds are you know how to
knit. Here's a pattern for edible
undies made out of red licorice
laces, only 302 calories: http://knit

star who loves to get crafty in be
tween scenes, you'll never think that
knitting is just for senior citizens.
