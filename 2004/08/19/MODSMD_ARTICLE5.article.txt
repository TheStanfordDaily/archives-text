## Axess unveils new look after system renovation 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
Due to a renovation of the Universi
ty's entire online administration system,
Axess, Stanford's employee and student
record system, has changed its format in
an effort to make the site easier to use.
After shutting down briefly from Aug. 5
to Aug. 10 for the upgrade, Axess is once
again open to faculty, staff and students.
Changes were planned and initiated
earlier this year when the software used
by the student administration system,
People Soft Version 7.6, was replaced by
People Soft 8. The new release allows for

more upgrades and patches. Since Axess
in particular handles so many areas —
working with the offices of graduate and
undergraduate admissions, financial aid,
tuition payment and class enrollment,
among others — Information Technolo
gy Systems and Services (ITSS), the reg
istrar's office, the law school, financial aid
and human resources joined forces to
form a team of 50-plus working on the
project, according to University Regis
trar Roger Frintup, who was involved
with the renovation.
Instead of the old left-side sub
menus, the new Axess home page fea
tures six simple tabs atop the browser

window for easier navigation. These in
clude tabs for courses and grades, fi
nancial matters and personal informa
tion. Many who have logged onto Axess
have already seen the changes made
with the software upgrade.
When it came time to address changes
to be made in Axess, University students
were extensively consulted, Printup ex
plained. Among their suggestions were
the six-tab structure, what links should
be included and how the navigation
should work similar to other Web sites.
"There should [now] be fewer clicks

to get from one place to another," Print
up said. "There's also more information
in the bursar's bill information page, to be
more easily understood by students."
Axess also plans to have more help for
finding classes and establishing study
lists. Rising junior Krysti Garcia has al
ready noticed the new weekly schedule
and what could possibly be a GER track
er, "which is really helpful because it can
be tricky to make sure you have all your
GERs covered."
While the upgrade's main purpose
was to stay current with the company's
software and wasn't necessarily intended
to provide new features, the new look has
been well received, as some students be
lieved the older version of Axess was
trickier to work with.
1 thought it was poorly divided [be
fore]; a long list of links," Garcia said. "It

would also take a while to load when I
needed to use Axess from home. This ver
sion seems to load faster. I like the new
one thus far, but we'll see when I actually
have to use it to sign up for classes and de
clare my major."
"I really like having everything right
there on the main page without any pop
ups," said rising sophomore Tyler Kirt
ley. "Also, they have the most used links
there so you don't have to click on a tab to
drop down all the possible links.
"I like that the important dates are on
the home page instead ol in a pop up win
dow," Garcia added. "No one likes pop
up windows.
Upgrade workers took advantage of
the slow summer month to implement
the changes, Printup said, noting that the
improved Axess had its first visitor within
seconds of start-up.
"We think we've had a pretty smooth
transition," Printup said. But the real
test will come in the fall. Hopefully by that
time we will have had a few weeks to see
how it works out."
