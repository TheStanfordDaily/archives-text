## Axess unveils new look after system renovation 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
Due to a renovation of the Universi
ty's entire online administration system,
Axess, Stanford's employee and student
record system, has changed its format in
an effort to make the site easier to use.
After shutting down briefly from Aug. 5
to Aug. 10 for the upgrade, Axess is once
again open to faculty, staff and students.
Changes were planned and initiated
earlier this year when the software used
by the student administration system,
People Soft Version 7.6, was replaced by
People Soft 8. The new release allows for

more upgrades and patches. Since Axess
in particular handles so many areas —
working with the offices of graduate and
undergraduate admissions, financial aid,
tuition payment and class enrollment,
among others — Information Technolo
gy Systems and Services (ITSS), the reg
istrar's office, the law school, financial aid
and human resources joined forces to
form a team of 50-plus working on the
project, according to University Regis
trar Roger Frintup, who was involved
with the renovation.
Instead of the old left-side sub
menus, the new Axess home page fea
tures six simple tabs atop the browser

window for easier navigation. These in
clude tabs for courses and grades, fi
nancial matters and personal informa
tion. Many who have logged onto Axess
have already seen the changes made
with the software upgrade.
When it came time to address changes
to be made in Axess, University students
were extensively consulted, Printup ex
plained. Among their suggestions were
the six-tab structure, what links should
be included and how the navigation
should work similar to other Web sites.
