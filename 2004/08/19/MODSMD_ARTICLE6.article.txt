# Exhibition raises eyebrows, conversation and questions
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Since its opening in mid-July,
the Cantor Arts Center's innova
tive exhibit entitled "Question"
has encouraged curious museum
goers to take a closer look at art
work and find answers to some of
their most commonly asked ques
tions. While the project is intend
ed to educate the public about art,
it also marks an unprecedented
level of collaboration for the mu
seum's staff.

From the enormous upside
down question mark at the entrance
to words projected on walls, it's ob
vious that "Question" isn't a typical
exhibit. In fact, much of the staff
considers it to be more of an inter
active experiment. Patrons can find
answers to questions ranging from
"Where is the meaning in this
piece?" to "This looks like some
thing my child could do. Why is it in
a museum?"
The main gallery draws paint-
ings, photography, sculptures and
more from Cantor's diverse collec
tions. The exhibit is designed to reflect
the life cycle of a piece of art at a mu
seum, with price tags hanging from
some works while others hang on wire
mesh as if they were in storage. Many
pieces remain unlabeled to allow
passersby to guess at the value and for
mulate unaffected responses. Visitors
are invited to sketch sculptures, change
the colors of the walls to see how it influ
ences the appearance of paintings and
type their opinions, which are then
projected in light.
To stimulate conversation, the ex
hibit's designers even installed record
ings of people's voices discussing art
and even engaging in debates. They
hope that these features will encourage
people to speak up rather than silently
observe, as many onlookers are prone
to do.
"People seem to be very enthusiastic
about it," said Patience Young, the cen
ter's curator for education. "There's a
higher level of conversation going on in
the gallery."
Conceived two years ago, "Question"
required the direct involvement of 30 staff
members, who each contributed different
ideas based on their own curiosities. The

idea first came when Center Director
Tom Seligman threw out the challenge to
redefine the way the public can learn
about art.
"We decided collectively — what to
do throughout many discussions and
meetings — so it really is a shared vi
sion," Young said. "We were fishing
around fora topic that would have uni
versal opportunity to tie together dif
ferent collections. We started compil
ing questions that regular people might
ask, as well as questions scholars and
experts might ask."
While a traditional museum exhibit can
take up to five years to produce, the cen
ter's staff pieced "Question" together in 18
months with the help of local volunteers,
Stanford faculty and employees at other
Bay Area museums.
"One of the intentions of the project
was to have the staff discover new ways of
working together to improve the overall
experience, even it it might not be evident
to visitors," Young said. "It has definitely
improved our channels of communica
tion internally."
Discussion between museum staff and
patrons is a large component of the exhib
it, which offers question and answer ses
sions on Wednesdays at 12:30 p.m., con
versational tours on Thursdays at 12:15
p.m. and Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m.,
and an open conference entitled "The Na
ture of Inquiry" on Nov. 6 at 1 p.m. in An
nenberg Auditorium. The project will end
on Jan. 2.
