## 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
Stanford professor and
former Secretary of De
fense William J Perry has
stepped into the limelight
to support Democratic can
didate John Kerry in his
bid for the presidency.
Perry, who served as a
member of Bill Clinton's cabi
net from 1994 to 1997, is a pro
fessor of management science
and engineering and a senior
fellow at the Stanford's Insti
tute for International Studies.

Despite his years as member
of the Clinton cabinet, Perry
has never been very outspoken
in politics. His support of Kerry
marks his first-ever public en
dorsement of a political candi
date. Perry told the Mercury
News that he is "seriously, seri
ously concerned about the di
rection that George Bush is
taking our country."
T felt it was time for me to
get off the sidelines and be
come a part of the political
process," Perry added, speak
ing to Mercury News corre
spondent Jim Puzzanghera.

Perry also voiced his con
cern at the Democratic Con
vention in Boston on July 22,
telling the crowd, "I have
never been as worried about
the management of our coun
try's security as I am today."
Prof. Perry, who intro
duced Kerry when the candi
date visited the Stanford cam
pus in December of last year,
has been critical of the Bush
administration in the past.
In March, he elaborated
on his positions in a
Newsweek-sponsored panel on
National Security. While he
agreed with many of the priorities
of the Republican administra
tion's foreign policy, he also ex
pressed his opinion that the exe
cution of those priorities had been
poor, particularly in the area of
nuclear disarmament.
'"Hie problem of loose nukes is
worse off by far than it needs to be,"
he said at the time. He went on to
criticize the Bush administration for
alienating other countries in their
handling of international issues, es
pecially America's war in Iraq.
"We cannot rebuild Iraq alone.
We cannot prevent nuclear prolif
eration alone. We cannot stop ter
rorism alone," he told the conven
tion audience.
"We must isolate die terrorists —
not the United States," he added.
