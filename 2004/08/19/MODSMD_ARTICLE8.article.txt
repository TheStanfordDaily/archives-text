In August's issue of the journal of Pedi
atrics, Shelli Kesler and Allan Reiss published
a breakthrough study regarding brain devel
opment in premature babies. Kesler, the lab
manager of Stanford's Psychiatry Neu

roimaging Laboratory, and Reiss, the direc
tor of the laboratory, worked in close collabo
ration with researchers at Brown University
and Yale University to complete the multi
million dollar project.
According to the March of Dimes die rate of
premature births in the United States has risen
from 9.4 percent in 1981 to 12.1 percent in 2002.

"With advances in medical technology,
preterm children of extremely low birth
weights are able to survive. However, we do
not know for certain what their long term
neurological, cognitive and behavioral out
come will lie," Kesler said.
Indeed, due to their low birth weights and
underdeveloped organs, premature babies are

at greater risk than full-term infants for devel
oping complications such as cerebral palsy. Past
studies have also shown that boys born prema
turely have more difficulties than preterm girls
with speech, language acquisition and appro
priate behavioral development in social con-
