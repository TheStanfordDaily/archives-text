# Premature boys at greater risk for complications than girls

### KATIE BEARMAN STAFF WRITER 
In August's issue of the journal of Pedi
atrics, Shelli Kesler and Allan Reiss published
a breakthrough study regarding brain devel
opment in premature babies. Kesler, the lab
manager of Stanford's Psychiatry Neu

roimaging Laboratory, and Reiss, the direc
tor of the laboratory, worked in close collabo
ration with researchers at Brown University
and Yale University to complete the multi
million dollar project.
According to the March of Dimes die rate of
premature births in the United States has risen
from 9.4 percent in 1981 to 12.1 percent in 2002.

"With advances in medical technology,
preterm children of extremely low birth
weights are able to survive. However, we do
not know for certain what their long term
neurological, cognitive and behavioral out
come will lie," Kesler said.
Indeed, due to their low birth weights and
underdeveloped organs, premature babies are

at greater risk than full-term infants for devel
oping complications such as cerebral palsy. Past
studies have also shown that boys born prema
turely have more difficulties than preterm girls
with speech, language acquisition and appro
priate behavioral development in social con-
texts as they age.
"This is a landmark study be
cause it is the first to identify a pos
sible neural marker for the differ
ence in outcome between male
and female preterm children,"

Kesler said.
Kesler, Reiss and their
colleagues scanned the
brains of 96 eight-year-olds
â€”using magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI)-65 of these

children had been born prema
turely , and the other 31 were born
full-term. Volumes of white and
gray brain matter in the prema
ture and full-term subjects, were
then compared

"In the preterm group as a
whole, we found the volumes of
both gray matter and white matter
were reduced," said Reiss in a news
release. "When we divided the
preterm group by gender we
found, bingo, the females had nor
mal or preserved white matter vol
ume, but the males' volumes were
reduced compared to their hill
term peers."
"These results indicate that

there are sex differences in the
neuroanatomic outcome associat
ed with preterm birth, said Kesler.
"White matter in preterm males
may be more vulnerable to
preterm birth."
According to Healthscout.com,
white matter is nerve cells under the
cortex surrounded by myelin. Be
cause myelin facilitates the transmis
sion of nerve symbols, lac k of white
brain matter could cause problems

with speech and behavior.
"I find this research reward
ing," kesler said of die study that
has been going on tor over 12
years." By identifying the neurode
velopmental profile associated
with preterm birth, we will eventu
ally be able to develop specific
treatments that will hopefully help
reduce the risk for learning and
other cognitive difficulties in
preterm children."
