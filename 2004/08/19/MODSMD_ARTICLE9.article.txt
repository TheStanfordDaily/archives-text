# Stanford aids underprivileged with free services at Arbor Clinic
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
This summer, Stanford Medical School's
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation de
partment has become the latest discipline to
volunteer its services at Menlo Park's free
Arbor Clinic, which offers medical exams
and treatment to underserved and indi
gent residents in the South Bay.
The volunteer-based program was con
ceived last spring by Dr. Elaine Date,
Chairman of Physical Medicine and Reha
bilitation at Stanford Medical School, and

Dr. Michael Fredericson, Director of
PM&R Sports Medicine. Drs Jason Atien
za and David Doward, both PM&R resi
dents, contacted clinic manager Maria
Loza and Dr. Lars Osterberg, the clinic's
medical director.
Atienza and Doward worked with clinic
management, settling on a program that
offers once-monthly services with three
physical medicine and rehabilitation resi
dents on duty, attended by Dr Fredricson.
The program was inaugurated on July
25 at the clinic's Menlo Park VA Facility.
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation ser

vices are available on the last Sunday of
every month, offering evaluation and treat
ment for problems including neck, back,
shoulder, and elbow conditions. Like all of
Arbor Clinic's services, the PM&R program
ministers primarily to patients without
medical insurance.
"We are happy to serve the indigent
population and give back to the communi
ty," said Fredericson, who supervises the
team of specialists. Fredericson added that
experience at the Arbor clinic "offers clini
cal pearls to up-and-coming doctors."
"Access to imaging, medication and

physical therapy is quite limited in a clinical
setting," Doward explained. "Therefore
one has to rely on good history skills and a
good physical exam — which are the hall
marks of making the correct medical diag
nosis — since other diagnostic modalities
are not readily available."
"In the era of rising medical costs and
constant budget cuts, these are good skills
to have," he said. "Some of the medical stu
dents also have administrative roles at
Arbor and are able to get a taste of what it
takes to run a medical clinic."
"Our first session was a total
success," Howard recalled."We
saw six patients with medical
problems ranging from low back
pain to a torn ACL. There was a
strong PM&R presence there and
we were able to teach the medical
students and the undergraduate
volunteers some clinical points."
The Physical Medicine and Re
habilitation Department is the lat
est specialty to become available at
the clinic, which was founded in
1990 by Stanford Medical School
students. The clinic also offers in
ternal medicine, opthomology,
and dermatology services.
Howard expressed the hope
that more departments would
soon follow.
"We would like to extend to
challenge to other specialties to
come out and volunteer their ser
vices," he said. "These patients
are so in need of health care and
so grateful for the free service."
"Personally, I find it extremely
gratifying to give back to the com
munity this way," he said.
