decide for yourself once you see the messages on your own computer whether

ITSS Tip of the week: "Say No to Spam." — The settings for the email vacation
message have been changed to "exclude" anything labeled spam at the server
level.That means that the email server will not automatically reply to any message labeled
as spam. When you return from vacation, you can then retrieve your messages and
decide for yourself once you see the messages on your own computer whether
you want to open them or not.
