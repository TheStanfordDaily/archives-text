## Disassembling the dissemblers 
### CHRISTOPHER R. VAUGHAN 
Patrick Mattimore's column
on legacy admissions ("College
admissions should be based on
merit," Aug. 19) last week was a
reminder of the impoverished
discussion of college admissions
that plagues not so much the au
thor's piece as the largest itera
tions of the national debate.
"Merit," "fairness" and "diversity,"
all definable and relevant terms,
have been beaten into pure mush
by the machines of vagary.
Enough people find the remain
ing puree sufficiently palatable to
excuse its lack of substance.
The machines of vagary are
operated by many: admissions
officers, parents, proponents
and opponents of affirmative ac
tion, rankings-producing publi
cations and the president.
"Merit" is the first vicfcim to be
shoved through the Cuisinart. At
the recent UNITY convention
that Mattimore discusses, Presi
dent Bush expressed in a breath
his opposition to legacy admis
sions and approval for "inerit"-
based policies. The implication
is: If we could only sweep away
legacies, we would lay bare an ob
jective "merit."
But I doubt Bush could sup
ply a definition for the word he
uses. To take "merit" as simply
an academic measure, after all,
would be to dismiss the presi
dent's own glory days as a

Phillips Academy cheerleader,
not to mention his widely-recog
nized "emotional intelligence"
(this specific phrasing comes
from Bill Clinton).
Even discounting athletic
and personal traits, we can devise
no fair test of academic or intel
lectual "merit." Standardized
testing suffers from fundamental
flaws, which even the SAT's re
forms cannot escape. As for cur
riculum-based judgments, could
a CPA from the Boise public
school find any common ground
with a counterpart number from
the Singaporean private school?
In the admissions world, objec
tive "merit" simply does not exist.
Next on the chopping block
is "fairness": Bush condemns
"special for certain
people in a system that's sup
posed to be fair." But affirmative
action is the "special exception"
Bush has most eagerly opposed
and that policy has shaped a fair
er university.
Further, if legacy preferences
grease the donation pipelines,
and that money goes to need
blind aid for poorer admits, then
a limited crop of legacies may it
self furnish more fairness. The
machines of vagary spit out a
flawed logic: The path to an un
defined "merit" must avoid legacy
admissions, which are unfair (are
they really?), and affirmative ac
tion policies, which are also un
fair (in most forms, they aren't).

Lab-coat technicians of all
stripes have crowded together to
force "diversity" through the ma
chines of vagary. Here, affirma
tive action lubes the obfuscation.
Opponents claim a desire for "di
versity," but they chronically fail
to explain how to achieve it with
out racial consideration. Propo
nents are even quicker to trum
pet "diversity" — but they strug
gle to get poor people into the
club. "Diversity" seems limp, and
loose, and ready for substitution
by a better term.
It's time to put admissions
policies through a machine of
our own. 1 sense that only by
holding the machinists of va
gary accountable will rhetorical
standards be raised. George
Orwell saw the individual as an
agent provocateur in the reflex
ive improvement of the English
language and politics: "[Tjhe
present political chaos is con
nected with the decay of lan
guage, and one can probably
bring about some improvement
by starting at the verbal end."
In that spirit, I call on my fellow
students to make the analogous
campaign against verbal admis
sions chaos. The puree of pub
licity pablum should be
ditched, and if we who have al
ready passed through the sys
tem must start it, then let the
ditching begin.
