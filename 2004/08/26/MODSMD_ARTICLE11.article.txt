Legacy admits deserve their
admission offers
As a Stanford legacy admit
and alumnus, I must admit I'm
probably not the most objective
person to comment on the issue
of legacy admissions. Still, at the
risk of seeming defensive, after
reading Patrick Mattimore's op
ed in the Daily ("College admis
sions should be based on merit,"
Aug. 19), I'd like to point out
something regarding the legacy
admissions versus affirmative ac
tion argument that Mattimore
chooses to ignore: They are com
pletely different systems.
In the business world, we rou
tinely see corporations offering re
wards to their best customers: Air
lines have frequent flyer miles to
reward their best travelers; cloth
ing stores offer discounts to fre
quent shoppers; Supercuts even
gives you a free haircut if you pay
them to butcher your hair enough
times. The point is, it is common
practice (and even good business
sense) to reward your best cus
tomers in order to breed loyalty
and keep them "coming back."
On the other hand, if a store
were to offer a special discount to
people of a certain race, or if a
business offered special benefits
to a person because of the color of
his skin, liberals and conservatives

alike would cry 'bloody murder"
and run straight to the ACLU.
The fact is, offering special
consideration to legacy appli
cants is not at all the same as giv
ing special consideration to an
applicant based on race. One is a
reward system for "repeat cus
tomers," and the other is a viola
tion of the Constitution.
To say that legacy students
are less deserving of their admis
sion is offensive and without
merit. The Stanford admission
office does not and will not admit
legacy admits (or even relatives
of financial donors) who are un
qualified applicants. Mattimore
seems unwilling to concede that
perhaps legacies at Stanford and
its peer institutions have a high
er acceptance rate because they
are in fact more qualified for ad
mission than the general popu
lation. Instead, he directly con
tradicts himself by declaring that
"legacy admits have lower than
average SAT scores and CPAs,"
and then a few lines later adding
that "you won't find statistics
about legacy admissions" on "the
Stanford admissions Web site."
If Mattimore doesn't have the in
formation, how can he support
his claim?
