## The
						agony that is U.S. basketball 
### 
Last Monday in Athens the American basket
hall team shocked the world in what should
have come as a surprise to no one. After trail
ing 49-27 at halftime, the United States —
basketball's birthplace, home of the original Dream
Team and the best athletes in the world — stormed
back to come within 19 points. Their opponent?
Puerto Rico, a commonwealth whose population is
around the size of the city of Miami, and whose rich
basketball tradition includes legends like Elias Avuso
and Carlos Arroyo.
As a sportswriter, I am contractually obligated to
use this phrase, but nowhere has it been more appro
priate than here: Shame on you, U.S. basketball.
Shame on you, David Stern, for choosing a team based
around marketing the NBA's young talent rather
than winning. Shame on you, elite players that didn't

show up. If the United States
was really that concerned about
the safety of its athletes, it
shouldn't have sent a team at all.
That would have been far less
embarrassing than the effort put
forth these past couple of weeks.
I hope we don't medal. In
fact, I hope we lose by 30 to An
gola. I hope the United States
basketball team gets exposed for
the sorry group it has become,
that Richard Jefferson and
Shawn Marion get less con-

cerned about their headbands and more concerned
about winning basketball games.
But then I guess that's all you can expect from a
"team" assembled from young, internationally mar
ketable NBA players (I'm still hesitant to use the term
"stars") who are grievously lacking in defense and
shooting. Richard Jefferson hit the side of the back
board last Monday — twice. But, as hustle, team de
fense, and outside shooting are only minor parts of
professional basketball, the players can't be expected
to keep up with their counterparts in South America
and Europe.
Let's stop using phrases like "much more experi
enced" and "they played with more heart" about
teams like Puerto Rico and Italy (who thrashed the
United States during their Magical Mystery Exhibi
tion Tour, which apparently included a couple of
basketball games in between autograph sessions,
hotboxing Lamar Odom's hotel room and mer
chandise promos). I believe the appropriate term
now is "better." International basketball hasn't
caught up to the United States — the Americans
have fallen to, and through, the level that the rest
of the world plays on.
This isn't even based around the fact that the
Americans are missing most of their key players. A
group of second-tier players in the NBA should still
be able to dispatch virtually any Olympic opponent,
based on the vast discrepancies in population size,
athleticism and talent. Of course Shaquille O'Neal,
Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant could have crushed
the Puerto Ricans. But putting the blame on them
for not showing up, as if their presence would some
how mitigate the gruesome state of American basket
ball, is asinine.
The fault here lies in the development of profes-
