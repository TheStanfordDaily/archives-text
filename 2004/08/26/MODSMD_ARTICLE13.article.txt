# Stanford athletes earn nine medals
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
At the start of the 2004 Games,
they seemed unbeatable. By the end
of it all, they were clearly untouch
able. So it seems only fitting that the
first Stanford gold medalist of the
Olympics was 2002 graduate Jessica
Mendoza, one of the women of the
U.S. softball team.
Team USA rolled into the cham
pionship game against Australia
with a perfect 8-0 record and a per
fect 0.00 ERA. The Australians
managed to manufacture a run in
the title game, but managed little
else. The Americans captured gold
for the third straight Olympics after
a 5-1 victory.
The medal is the first for Men
doza, who started all nine contests
in right field for the U.S. squad.
She batted .250 over the course of
the Games.
Just one day after Mendoza and
Team USA finished vanquishing
every competitor on the field,
Stanford graduate Kerri Walsh
and Misty May hit the sand to give
Stanford its second gold medal of
the Games.
Walsh, who played volleyball
while on the Farm, and May
teamed up to win the first-ever
American gold in beach volleyball,
remaining undefeated throughout
their run in Athens.
Stanford's medal count now stands
at nine, including the two golds.

Alum Jenny
Thompson swam
her way into history
this week, becoming
the most decorated
Olympian in Ameri
can history. She
clinched silver in
the 4xloo medley
relay, her second
silver of the Games,
and promptly de
clared that the race
marked the end of
her Olympic career.
Thompson has
12 career medals
— eight gold —
from the four
Olympics she has
competed in.
And just as one
Stanford Olympian
collected her final
medal, another

claimed her. Recent graduate Tara
Kirk swam the breaststroke leg of
the qualifying heats for the 4xloo
medley relay team and garnered a
silver in the process.
Fellow 2004 grad Mark us
Rogan was also busy in the pool
this week, picking up his second
silver medal of the Games in the
controversial 200-meter back
stroke. Rogan, who is competing
for Austria, finished behind
Olympic-record holding American
Aaron Peirsol in the finals of the
event, but was given the gold when

Peirsol was disqualified. The boos
of the Athens crowd resounded in
the stadium in protest of the I)Q.
and Rogan joined in, showing sup
port for Peirsol. The 1)Q was over
turned after review and Rogan was
given the silver.
"I am happy with my silver
medal," Rogan told the press. "For
a moment I thought about gold and
the idea was just beautiful, but after
all, it's fair like this. Aaron is a very
honest person, I am sure he swam

fairly, and it is just the way it should be."
Rising junior Samantha Magee be
came the first current Stanford athlete to
medal in Athens, finishing second with
the women's eight rowing team. The
Americans rolled through the finish just
over two seconds behind the team from
Romania, and the silver medal was the
first for the United States in the event in
20 years.
Alum Patricia Miranda also wrote
herself into history books this week, par
ticipating and inedaling in the first
women's wrestling competition in
Olympic history. After falling in the
semifinals to Ukraine's Irini Merleni,
Miranda came back in her next match to
win the bronze medal.
Though seven Cardinal affiliates have
found their way to the medal stand in
Greece, even more than that are return

ing home empty-handed.
The women's volleyball squad was
eliminated from Olympic play this week
after a heartbreaking loss to undefeated
gold medal favorite Brazil. Despite the
efforts of Stanford alum Logan Tom and
rising senior Oganna Nnamani, who
combined for 23 points in the final game,
the squad lost 3-2 in the quarterfinals.
"1 think tonight's match was good in
the fact that we showed a lot of fight and
a lot of heart coming back from being
down two sets," Tom told reporters. "I
am very proud of our girls, especially the
girls who came off the bench. They gave
their all out there. I hope people who saw
our team tonight are proud of us even
though we lost because I know I always
will be."
The men's water polo team, which
has been carried largely by the effec
tiveness of Stanford grad Wolf Wigo
and rising senior Tony Azevedo, had its
hopes fora medal dashed this week
after losing three straight matches. The
squad will begin play in the consolation
bracket tomorrow.

the title game, but managed little
else. The Americans captured gold
for the third straight Olympics after
a 5-1 victory.
The medal is the first for Men
doza, who started all nine contests
in right field for the U.S. squad.
She batted .250 over the course of
the Games.
Just one day after Mendoza and
Team USA finished vanquishing
every competitor on the field,
Stanford graduate Kerri Walsh
and Misty May hit the sand to give
Stanford its second gold medal of
the Games.
Walsh, who played volleyball
while on the Farm, and May
teamed up to win the first-ever
American gold in beach volleyball,
remaining undefeated throughout
their run in Athens.
Stanford's medal count now stands
at nine, including the two golds.

Alum Jenny
Thompson swam
her way into history
this week, becoming
the most decorated
Olympian in Ameri
can history. She
clinched silver in
the 4xloo medley
relay, her second
silver of the Games,
and promptly de
clared that the race
marked the end of
her Olympic career.
Thompson has
12 career medals
— eight gold —
from the four
Olympics she has
competed in.
And just as one
Stanford Olympian
collected her final
medal, another

claimed her. Recent graduate Tara
Kirk swam the breaststroke leg of
the qualifying heats for the 4xloo
medley relay team and garnered a
silver in the process.
Fellow 2004 grad Mark us
Rogan was also busy in the pool
this week, picking up his second
silver medal of the Games in the
controversial 200-meter back
stroke. Rogan, who is competing
for Austria, finished behind
Olympic-record holding American
Aaron Peirsol in the finals of the
event, but was given the gold when

Peirsol was disqualified. The boos
of the Athens crowd resounded in
the stadium in protest of the I)Q.

port for Peirsol. The 1)Q was over
turned after review and Rogan was
given the silver.
"I am happy with my silver
medal," Rogan told the press. "For
a moment I thought about gold and
the idea was just beautiful, but after
all, it's fair like this. Aaron is a very
honest person, I am sure he swam

came the first current Stanford athlete to
medal in Athens, finishing second with
the women's eight rowing team. The
Americans rolled through the finish just
over two seconds behind the team from
Romania, and the silver medal was the
first for the United States in the event in
20 years.
Alum Patricia Miranda also wrote
herself into history books this week, par
ticipating and inedaling in the first
women's wrestling competition in
Olympic history. After falling in the
semifinals to Ukraine's Irini Merleni,
Miranda came back in her next match to
win the bronze medal.

found their way to the medal stand in
Greece, even more than that are return

The women's volleyball squad was
eliminated from Olympic play this week
after a heartbreaking loss to undefeated
gold medal favorite Brazil. Despite the
efforts of Stanford alum Logan Tom and
rising senior Oganna Nnamani, who
combined for 23 points in the final game,
the squad lost 3-2 in the quarterfinals.
"1 think tonight's match was good in
the fact that we showed a lot of fight and
a lot of heart coming back from being
down two sets," Tom told reporters. "I
am very proud of our girls, especially the
girls who came off the bench. They gave
their all out there. I hope people who saw
our team tonight are proud of us even
though we lost because I know I always
will be."
The men's water polo team, which
has been carried largely by the effec
tiveness of Stanford grad Wolf Wigo
and rising senior Tony Azevedo, had its
hopes fora medal dashed this week
after losing three straight matches. The
squad will begin play in the consolation
bracket tomorrow.

2004 graduate Markus Rogan, along with Jenny Thompson, was one of Stanford's two multi
medal athletes in Athens. The Austrian took second in both the 100- and 200-meter backstroke
races, losing both times to American Aaron Peirsol.
At the start of the 2004 Games,
they seemed unbeatable. By the end
of it all, they were clearly untouch
able. So it seems only fitting that the
first Stanford gold medalist of the
Olympics was 2002 graduate Jessica
Mendoza, one of the women of the
U.S. softball team.
Team USA rolled into the cham
pionship game against Australia
with a perfect 8-0 record and a per
fect 0.00 ERA. The Australians
managed to manufacture a run in
the title game, but managed little
else. The Americans captured gold
for the third straight Olympics after
a 5-1 victory.
