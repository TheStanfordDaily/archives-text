# Stanford athletes earn nine medals
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
At the start of the 2004 Games,
they seemed unbeatable. By the end
of it all, they were clearly untouch
able. So it seems only fitting that the
first Stanford gold medalist of the
Olympics was 2002 graduate Jessica
Mendoza, one of the women of the
U.S. softball team.
Team USA rolled into the cham
pionship game against Australia
with a perfect 8-0 record and a per
fect 0.00 ERA. The Australians
managed to manufacture a run in
the title game, but managed little
else. The Americans captured gold
for the third straight Olympics after
a 5-1 victory.
The medal is the first for Men
doza, who started all nine contests
in right field for the U.S. squad.
She batted .250 over the course of
the Games.
Just one day after Mendoza and
Team USA finished vanquishing
every competitor on the field,
Stanford graduate Kerri Walsh
and Misty May hit the sand to give
Stanford its second gold medal of
the Games.
Walsh, who played volleyball
while on the Farm, and May
teamed up to win the first-ever
American gold in beach volleyball,
remaining undefeated throughout
their run in Athens.
Stanford's medal count now stands
at nine, including the two golds.

Alum Jenny
Thompson swam
her way into history
this week, becoming
the most decorated
Olympian in Ameri
can history. She
clinched silver in
the 4xloo medley
relay, her second
silver of the Games,
and promptly de
clared that the race
marked the end of
her Olympic career.
Thompson has
12 career medals
— eight gold —
from the four
Olympics she has
competed in.
And just as one
Stanford Olympian
collected her final
medal, another

claimed her. Recent graduate Tara
Kirk swam the breaststroke leg of
the qualifying heats for the 4xloo
medley relay team and garnered a
silver in the process.
Fellow 2004 grad Mark us
Rogan was also busy in the pool
this week, picking up his second
silver medal of the Games in the
controversial 200-meter back
stroke. Rogan, who is competing
for Austria, finished behind
Olympic-record holding American
Aaron Peirsol in the finals of the
event, but was given the gold when

Peirsol was disqualified. The boos
of the Athens crowd resounded in
the stadium in protest of the I)Q.
and Rogan joined in, showing sup
port for Peirsol. The 1)Q was over
turned after review and Rogan was
given the silver.
"I am happy with my silver
medal," Rogan told the press. "For
a moment I thought about gold and
the idea was just beautiful, but after
all, it's fair like this. Aaron is a very
honest person, I am sure he swam
