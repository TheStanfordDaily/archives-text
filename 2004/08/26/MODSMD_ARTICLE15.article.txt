# Watch the birdie: Small sports shine in Athens Olympics
## 
### BRYAN CHU THE DAILY BRUIN 
U-WIRE —Though it's been 108
years since Athens, Greece, last hosted
(he Olympics, the essence of the games
remains constant — peace, good will
and solidarity.
And though I'm 6,889.66 miles away
from the XXVIII Olympiad, I find my
self cheering louder than ever for Team
USA athletes.
Unlike past Games, I watched the en
lire Opening Ceremonies. Yes, I actually
saw the whole four hours of it and every
one of the 202 national delegations from
the presentation of the United States' 536
athletes to even the British Virgin Is
lands' one athlete.
But for me, the Olympics are more
than just getting to see the greatest ath
letes from around the world. They're
about seeing the sports that aren't glam
orized in the States.
Forget tuning into basketball, soccer,
swimming, track and field and all those
other million-dollar sporting industries. I
find myself glued to watching such sports
as table tennis, badminton and fencing.
Ultimately, the Olympic Games are
about these sports.
They're just as taxing on the body and
just as competitive.
The only things missing are the "ex

tracurricular activities." These are the
sports in which you never hear about ath
letes taking steroids, negotiating their
contracts or, dare I say, going on a strike.
These athletes are the ones that re
main "pure." The ones that remain hon
est to the sport.
They are the ones that are apprecia
tive of representing their country and
would never turn away the opportuni
ty because of fatigue (something many
of our NBA players should be ashamed
of doing).
So there 1 was, mid-afternoon, finish
ing up an episode of "Queer Eye for the
Straight Guy," and fencing was on next.
Though it began in 1896, fencing still
has remained one of the most fast-paced,
quick-scoring sports I have ever seen. It
takes but a modicum of time to parry
(block) and lunge forward at an oppo
nent with a pliable, thin sword.
Though I'm all for watching the ath
letes poke each other like a finger to the
Pillsbury Doughboy, I'd have to say the
most entertaining aspect of the sport is
the get-up fencers wear. It's basically an
outfit that can only be described as a
spacesuit from "2001: A Space Odyssey,"
with red and yellow lights blinking on the
helmets to indicate a hit.
In the men's sabre gold medal match
(fencing has three categories of events foil,
epee and saber), Italy's Aldo Montano and

Hungary's Zsolt Nemcsik faced off.
With the score tied at 13-13 and the
winner needing 15 points, I witnessed a
miraculous event.
It was more of a gesture.
After parrying an offense maneuver by
Nemcsik, Montano blocked and leaned
forward but somehow lost his footing,
which resulted in a twisting of his right
foot and the loss of the point. On the floor
and writhing in pain, his opponent
dropped to his knees and tended to the
injured fencer.
I've never seen that before. But at this
stage of the sport, it's the gamesmanship
that I'm most impressed by. That's what it
means to be a world-class athlete.
In case you're wondering, the gold
medal came down to a sudden death, and
Montano took home the gold.
Another often overlooked sport
that's considered a dainty sport like
cricket, badminton is downright ex
hausting. Who ever would have thought
that smashing a bird that weighs some
thing like a feather could make a condi
tioned athlete perspire like that?
What's even more amazing is that little
feathered ball can come off the racquet
at over 200 mph.
That's nearly 50 mph faster than an
Andy Roddick serve. Nearly 100 mph
faster than a Randy Johnson pitch.
Now, I've played badminton before in

P.E., but it wasn't until now that I've seen
it played at this level.
Amazing. Good thing there's a rubber
pad in the front, or someone's eye might
get poked out.
Balls fly in table tennis, which, if you
haven't seen it, odds are that you don't
know how difficult it is. In fact, I'm sold
that this sport incorporates every ounce
of footwork, balance, speed, strength and
most of mental conditioning than any
other sport. *
Though many people think table ten
nis is only played by Asians, that's far
from the truth. Table tennis is an ex
tremely popular sport worldwide, espe
cially in many European countries.
Those guys and gals can really smack
the heck out of that 1-ounce plastic ball.
Some put so much spin on the ball that
the ball has been clocked at going 140
revolutions per second. It's one of the
most fun sports to watch, as rallies are on
the-edge-of-your-seat entertaining.
Sometimes you can see athletes playing
15 feet away from the table and even in
the grandstands as they force each other
further and further away from the table
with their powering slams.
I'm entrenched into these less illustri
ous sports now.
Something tells me I'll be spending
more than four hours in front of the TV
these next two weeks.

the heck out of that 1-ounce plastic ball.
Some put so much spin on the ball that
the ball has been clocked at going 140
revolutions per second. It's one of the
most fun sports to watch, as rallies are on
the-edge-of-your-seat entertaining.
Sometimes you can see athletes playing
15 feet away from the table and even in
the grandstands as they force each other
further and further away from the table
with their powering slams.
I'm entrenched into these less illustri
ous sports now.
Something tells me I'll be spending
more than four hours in front of the TV
these next two weeks.
U-WIRE —Though it's been 108
years since Athens, Greece, last hosted
(he Olympics, the essence of the games
remains constant — peace, good will
and solidarity.
And though I'm 6,889.66 miles away
from the XXVIII Olympiad, I find my
self cheering louder than ever for Team
USA athletes.
Unlike past Games, I watched the en
lire Opening Ceremonies. Yes, I actually
saw the whole four hours of it and every
one of the 202 national delegations from
the presentation of the United States' 536
athletes to even the British Virgin Is
lands' one athlete.
But for me, the Olympics are more
than just getting to see the greatest ath
letes from around the world. They're
about seeing the sports that aren't glam
orized in the States.
Forget tuning into basketball, soccer,
swimming, track and field and all those
other million-dollar sporting industries. I
find myself glued to watching such sports
as table tennis, badminton and fencing.
Ultimately, the Olympic Games are
about these sports.
They're just as taxing on the body and
just as competitive.
The only things missing are the "ex

tracurricular activities." These are the
sports in which you never hear about ath
letes taking steroids, negotiating their
contracts or, dare I say, going on a strike.
These athletes are the ones that re
main "pure." The ones that remain hon
est to the sport.
They are the ones that are apprecia
tive of representing their country and
would never turn away the opportuni
ty because of fatigue (something many
of our NBA players should be ashamed
of doing).
So there 1 was, mid-afternoon, finish
ing up an episode of "Queer Eye for the
Straight Guy," and fencing was on next.
Though it began in 1896, fencing still
has remained one of the most fast-paced,
quick-scoring sports I have ever seen. It
takes but a modicum of time to parry
(block) and lunge forward at an oppo
nent with a pliable, thin sword.
Though I'm all for watching the ath
letes poke each other like a finger to the
Pillsbury Doughboy, I'd have to say the
most entertaining aspect of the sport is
the get-up fencers wear. It's basically an
outfit that can only be described as a
spacesuit from "2001: A Space Odyssey,"
with red and yellow lights blinking on the
helmets to indicate a hit.
In the men's sabre gold medal match
(fencing has three categories of events foil,
epee and saber), Italy's Aldo Montano and

Hungary's Zsolt Nemcsik faced off.
With the score tied at 13-13 and the
winner needing 15 points, I witnessed a
miraculous event.
It was more of a gesture.
After parrying an offense maneuver by
Nemcsik, Montano blocked and leaned
forward but somehow lost his footing,
which resulted in a twisting of his right
foot and the loss of the point. On the floor
and writhing in pain, his opponent
dropped to his knees and tended to the
injured fencer.
I've never seen that before. But at this
stage of the sport, it's the gamesmanship
that I'm most impressed by. That's what it
means to be a world-class athlete.
In case you're wondering, the gold
medal came down to a sudden death, and
Montano took home the gold.
Another often overlooked sport
that's considered a dainty sport like
cricket, badminton is downright ex
hausting. Who ever would have thought
that smashing a bird that weighs some
thing like a feather could make a condi
tioned athlete perspire like that?
What's even more amazing is that little
feathered ball can come off the racquet
at over 200 mph.
That's nearly 50 mph faster than an
Andy Roddick serve. Nearly 100 mph
faster than a Randy Johnson pitch.
Now, I've played badminton before in

P.E., but it wasn't until now that I've seen
it played at this level.
Amazing. Good thing there's a rubber
pad in the front, or someone's eye might
get poked out.
Balls fly in table tennis, which, if you
haven't seen it, odds are that you don't
know how difficult it is. In fact, I'm sold
that this sport incorporates every ounce
of footwork, balance, speed, strength and
most of mental conditioning than any
other sport. *
Though many people think table ten
nis is only played by Asians, that's far
from the truth. Table tennis is an ex
tremely popular sport worldwide, espe
cially in many European countries.
