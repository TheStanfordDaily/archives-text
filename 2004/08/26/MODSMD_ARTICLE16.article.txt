## From 'Scrubs' to 'State': Braff shines throughout 
### SCOTT HOWARD INTERMISSION ONLINE FILM CRITIC 
Sometimes I'm ahead of the curve, sometimes
I'm behind it. When I first heard about "Garden
State," I think I literally laughed out loud. Al
though I'm not usually the type to read entertain
ment journalism and giggle to myself about how
stupid celebrities are, this was too ridiculous to ig
nore. Zach Braff, the unfortunately-named star of
the NBC sitcom "Scrubs'' (which I haven't watched
to this day), had written, directed and starred in a
dramedy that premiered at the Sundance Film
Festival. He had somehow convinced such es
timable talents as Natalie Portman, Peter Sars-

gaard and even lan Holm to join the cast. I won
dered what line he had fed these people to con
vince them to join him for what was sure to be the
most embarrassing display of a crowd-pleasing
actor getting violendy drunk on his own ambition
since Kevin Costner's post-apocalyptic epic west
ern "The Postman."
The credible advance word kept rolling in, but
it never once occured to me that the film might ac
tually be good until I saw the trailer. That's when
all of my cynicism disappeared. Braff was a real di
rector with something to say, not just some net
work hack moonlighting in Park City and Cannes.
Though the full film doesn't quite sustain the
heartfelt, sometimes morbid phantasmagoria of
that masterpiece of a trailer, it confirms Braff as one

of the most peculiar and original talents of his gen
eration â€” and hopefully sets the stage fora long
career 011 both sides of the camera.
"Garden State" follows Andrew Largeman
(Braff), a heavily-medicated actor/waiter in
L.A. who returns to New Jersey for his mother's
funeral. He encounters his emotionally distant
and manipulative father (Holm), a former
friend who is oblivious to the fact that he's be
come one of the "losers" he relentlessly mocks
(Sarsgaard) and a perpetually hyper but sweet
epileptic (Portman).
Braff recently said in an interview that "your
body goes through puberty in your teens and your
brain goes through puberty in your 205," and that

he wanted his movie to capture that contusion.
He largely succeeds through his innovative
use of widescreen's scope and his pitch-perfect
performance as the maladjusted Andrew.
Like last year's "Lost In Translation," the film
reaps great rewards by unapologetically wear
ing its heart on its sleeve and allowing us to see
its characters' most intimate moments. Braff s
direction is fine-tuned to a point that many ex
changes seem odd at first because we're not
used to seeing them portrayed so realistically.
Andrew's trip to a neurologist's office initially

comes off as an unsuccessful attempt at comedy
until we realize that we teel just as awkward as he
has been made to feel.
The film is not without its flaws. Braff, in an ill
advised attempt to make the movie more accessi
ble, sometimes smothers the sincere emotion of
his characters with way too much schmaltz (com
plete with swelling acoustic guitar numbers).
Portman is a fine actress, but she's utterly miscast
as a tomboy Jersey girl. It's like seeing Audrey
Hepburn as Erin Brockovich.
But slight imperfections rarely dull the impact
and heart of "Garden State." After he has a few
films under his belt, Braff may reveal himself as the
unlikely missing link between Frank Capra and
David Lynch.
