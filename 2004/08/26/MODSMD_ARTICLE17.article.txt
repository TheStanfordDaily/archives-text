# The 						30-second movie psychic speaks to you
## 
### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION WRITER 
I have seen the future . . . and it
is full of pain, suffering and more
awful George Lucas films. Ves
readers, the crystal ball tells all,
and not even the next Spiderman
sequel will save you from what will
be a temporary damnation of hor
rible movies in the near future.
But wait. .. the spirits are speak
ing: "I, Robot will be just like every
other Will Smith movie that doesn't

have Tommy Lee
Jones!" Oh dear
me, it seems I'm a
little late on that
prediction. But
not to worry, just
as Peter Parker
was late with his
pizzas in "Spider
man 2," nothing
will come of this in
significant event.
Let us take a
step back and be
serious fora mo-

ment, unlike the royal abomination
that was "King Arthur" (the pro
ducer's soul still reeks of "Kanga
roo Jack"). I will now try to channel
the energies of movies to come and
catch a glimpse of their successes
(and failures).
I see ... a tired and aging fran
chise, ruined by Iceman and a vil
lain played by the governor of Cali
fornia. I see an origin story told in
every past movie in five minutes,
only this time it shall take nearly the
entire breadth of the movie. I also
catch a glimpse of a meaningless
trip across the world, with the small
possibility of something cool hap
pening. In one year, I see this "Bat

man Begins" destroying innocent
$10 bills throughout the country
and sunlight deprived nerds
wrecking havoc across the vast In
ternet message boards. However, I
see nothing worse than "Batman
and Robin."
As the ball unfogs from the steam
emitted by my top ramen, I see the
stupidest tag line fora movie ever,
nine out of 10 math majors will
agree: 12 is not the new 11.
I see an oceanic comedy with po
tential to dominate the I)VD market.

J acques Cousteau once
said, "The sea is the
universal sewer," but
this film will be a lost
gem in the debris that
litters theaters this up
coming season. This...
"Life Aquatic" will be
an unfortunate martyr
during the Christmas
season. However, I
sense the star power of
a former Ghostbuster
turned fat orange cat
eventually bringing

die masses to what the spirits say is the
sleeper hit of th^vinter.
A great fear envelops me as I par
take in this next vision. I see visions of
"Street Fighter: The Movie" receiv
ing an Academy Award before this
future movie. I see yet again, that
there can never be a good movie
based on a video game. I see cheesy
effects, horrid monsters and . . .
Christian Slater. Be afraid, be very
afraid ... of "Alone in the Dark. "
I he spirits have now left, and I
have nothing more to say. Farewell
readers, and should my predictions
go awry, I simply have to remind
you that you've probably seen "The
Village," and we all make mistakes.
