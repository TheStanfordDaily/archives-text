# Roxy Sass: Tricks and treats for your lover's twins
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Roxy has her finger on the pulse of the
Stanford sex scene, and as usual she
doesn't like what she sees. I've watched one
too many of my tragically repressed peers
dive for the main course, skipping over
salacious side dishes in the process.
Enough is enough. So lie back as Roxy
plays teacher and shows you how to double
the fun.
Two testicles, two breasts — it can seem
like a lot to reckon with, especially if you're
going at it full speed ahead. For once, Roxy
wants you to slow it down. After all we go to

a school full of gifted multi-taskers; why
not take advantage? By the end of this arti
cle, I guarantee you'll jump at the chance
to tame your partner's terrible (but oh so
delicious) twos.
Roxy has always been the belle of the
ball, but with so many neglected testicles
just waiting for the right touch, I suppose
it's time others benefited from my talent.
First off, never underestimate the sensi
tivity of this delightful region. Ix nay to
the queesing say. No biting, tugging or
grabbing either. At risk of sounding trite,
treat your man's family jewels like the
precious gems they are. Gentle is the key
word here.

After all, there's magic to be found in a
little light sucking here, some ticklish
cupping there. Blow some cool air in the
right direction and you'll blow his mind
for sure. Most men won't expect you to
give their testicles such loving care. From
start to finish, getting to be friends with
his boys can make all the difference.
Whether you're simply brushing a hand
over them under the table at Wilbur din
ing or giving them a little (very soft) pull
to prolong his orgasm, it definitely pays
to keep your eye on the ball.
Too often Roxy dispenses advice to
her gal pals without making sure they too
get what they need. So listen up guys, be

cause when it comes to knowing what
makes her nipples stand at attention,
Roxy's cup runneth over. In the great
film "High Fidelity," the male protago
nist says,"it was as if breasts were little
pieces of property that had been unlaw
fully annexed by the opposite sex — they
were rightfully ours and we wanted them
back." So hey, if you feel this way, you're
not alone. But rest assured — there's an
easier, more satisfying way than simply
grabbing for whatever you can get.
A quick note to any of my homegirls
who get anxious whenever a guy might
spot the 34A tag on your bra —
relax already. No guy has ever
seen a breast he didn't like. Trust
me, if it has a nipple and you're
willing to show it to him, he's a

happy camper.
Now guys, the female breast
is filled with literally thousands
of nerve endings, each of which
can be lit like a sparkler on the
Fourth of July under the right
conditions. The most important
thing is to take your sweet time
and pay close attention to her
reactions so you know where to
go next. At first, you want to
keep contact to a minimum.

Trace around the breast with a
single finger, slowly circling in
ward toward the nipple. Once
there, take it between your
thumb and forefinger and very
gently twist back and forth.
She'll feel your touch in all her
pressure points, her wrists, be
hind her knees—and assorted
other places.
If you've made it to this point
without devouring each other,
its time to put your mouth to
work. Nothing delights like a
quick Hick of the tongue fol
lowed by a quick breath of warm
air. And by all means, remember
there are two to work with, so

don't make one jealous by only
focusing on the other. Remem
ber this and you won't have to
invade her territory. She'll open
her borders.
Don't forget, every good sex
god(dess) wouldn't be caught
dead without a trusty toy box, so
neither should you. What you'll
need: a feather, ice cube, scarf,
peppermint tea and toothpaste
(yes, you heard me). Never un
derestimate the power of good
dental hygiene.
It's no myth that when you
take one sense away the others
are intensified. Blindfolds
were fun when you played pin

the tail on the donkey at your
eighth birthday party, and
they still are today. Add this to
hot, cold and minty fresh sen
sations in strategic locations
and you've got yourself a win
ning combination for some
good old-fashioned, cavity
free fun.

Roxy has her finger on the pulse of the
Stanford sex scene, and as usual she
doesn't like what she sees. I've watched one
too many of my tragically repressed peers
dive for the main course, skipping over
salacious side dishes in the process.
Enough is enough. So lie back as Roxy
plays teacher and shows you how to double
the fun.
Two testicles, two breasts — it can seem
like a lot to reckon with, especially if you're
going at it full speed ahead. For once, Roxy
wants you to slow it down. After all we go to

a school full of gifted multi-taskers; why
not take advantage? By the end of this arti
cle, I guarantee you'll jump at the chance
to tame your partner's terrible (but oh so
delicious) twos.
Roxy has always been the belle of the
ball, but with so many neglected testicles
just waiting for the right touch, I suppose
it's time others benefited from my talent.
First off, never underestimate the sensi
tivity of this delightful region. Ix nay to
the queesing say. No biting, tugging or
grabbing either. At risk of sounding trite,
treat your man's family jewels like the
precious gems they are. Gentle is the key
word here.

After all, there's magic to be found in a
little light sucking here, some ticklish
cupping there. Blow some cool air in the
right direction and you'll blow his mind
for sure. Most men won't expect you to
give their testicles such loving care. From
start to finish, getting to be friends with
his boys can make all the difference.
Whether you're simply brushing a hand
over them under the table at Wilbur din
ing or giving them a little (very soft) pull
to prolong his orgasm, it definitely pays
to keep your eye on the ball.
Too often Roxy dispenses advice to
her gal pals without making sure they too
get what they need. So listen up guys, be

cause when it comes to knowing what
makes her nipples stand at attention,
Roxy's cup runneth over. In the great
film "High Fidelity," the male protago
nist says,"it was as if breasts were little
pieces of property that had been unlaw
fully annexed by the opposite sex — they
were rightfully ours and we wanted them
back." So hey, if you feel this way, you're
not alone. But rest assured — there's an
easier, more satisfying way than simply
grabbing for whatever you can get.
A quick note to any of my homegirls
who get anxious whenever a guy might
spot the 34A tag on your bra —
relax already. No guy has ever
seen a breast he didn't like. Trust
me, if it has a nipple and you're
willing to show it to him, he's a

happy camper.
Now guys, the female breast
is filled with literally thousands
of nerve endings, each of which
can be lit like a sparkler on the
Fourth of July under the right
conditions. The most important
thing is to take your sweet time
and pay close attention to her
reactions so you know where to
go next. At first, you want to
keep contact to a minimum.

Trace around the breast with a
single finger, slowly circling in
ward toward the nipple. Once
there, take it between your
thumb and forefinger and very
gently twist back and forth.
She'll feel your touch in all her
pressure points, her wrists, be
hind her knees—and assorted
other places.
If you've made it to this point
without devouring each other,
its time to put your mouth to
work. Nothing delights like a
quick Hick of the tongue fol
lowed by a quick breath of warm
air. And by all means, remember
there are two to work with, so

don't make one jealous by only
focusing on the other. Remem
ber this and you won't have to
invade her territory. She'll open
her borders.
Don't forget, every good sex
god(dess) wouldn't be caught
dead without a trusty toy box, so
neither should you. What you'll
need: a feather, ice cube, scarf,
peppermint tea and toothpaste
(yes, you heard me). Never un
