### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The University has announced
that, as of this September, Dean of
Admission and Financial Aid Robin
Mamlet will be working a reduced
number of hours while still perform
ing professional duties. She plans to
step down from her position alto
gether by June 1 of next year.
'After considerable thought
during the last few months . . .
I've made the decision to have
this be my last year at Stanford,"
Mamlet said to The Stanford Re
port. "This will mean I'll have
been at Stanford for five years,
and at this time, my desire is to be

more focused on my family, espe
cially my children, during this
key time in their development.
"The provost has graciously
agreed that I may begin to spend
more time with my family right
away," she added. "The quality
and commitment of the current
stall in admission, financial aid
and visitor information services
makes this decision easier."
Mamlet presided over several
significant changes in undergrad
uate admission policies, including
the notable shift from Stanford's
prior binding early decision setup
to it's current non-binding, single
choice early action system.
"I think that this certainlv mav

enhance our ability to enroll a di
verse class," Mainlet said regard
ing the change in a prior Nov. 7,
2002 article. "It certainly will not
hinder it. Early action gives stu
dents on financial aid more flexi
bility — they can compare finan
cial aid packages."
Indeed, Stanford's undergrad
uate population witnessed un
precedented diversity gains with
in its entering classes during
Mamlet's tenure. As reported in
an April 3, 2002 Daily article, the
University announced that — for
the first time in its history — more
than half of its admitted class were
students from minority groups.
"The composition of students

she's brought about during her
term at Stanford couldn't be a
more exciting, diverse and tal
ented group of individuals, at
least in my opinion," said Tom
Hanada, a rising senior. "The
University has increasingly be
come a more and more vibrant
place to learn and grow."
Mamlet has been praised dur
ing her term by students and ad
ministrators alike. University of
ficials had nothing but kind
words for the outgoing dean.
"We are very sorry to lose
Robin and she will be extremely
difficult to replace," said Provost
