The U.S. News & World Re
port's recently released annual
rankings continue to hold Stan
ford in the first tier of "Ameri
ca's Top Schools" at the number
five spot. The magazine uses 15
indicators to rate the caliber of
higher education institutions,
creating numerical rankings
that have become increasingly
influential in students' matricu
lation decisions.
Princeton University and Har
vard University share the honor
of the number one spot, with
Yale University ranked third
(there was no number two spot,
as two universities shared num
ber one), University of Pennsyl

vania fourth and a three-way tie
for fifth between Duke, MIT, and
Stanford. This is Princeton's fifth
straight year with a share in the
top spot.
U.S. News distinguished UC-
Berkeley as the number one pub
lic school in the nation. Nonethe
less, rival Cal still finished behind
Stanford overall, placed 21 in
"America's Top Schools."
U.S. News categorizes schools
based on the developments of the
Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Teaching. There
are 248 schools in the national
university category — 162 public
and 86 private — which are evalu
ated against their peer institutions
to yield a numerical ranking.
.The most important deter
minants influencing the U.S.

rankings include assessment of
peer institutions by top school
administrators (comprising 25
percent of a school's score), re
tention rates of freshmen re
turning to school the subse
quent year and eventually
graduating (amounting to 20
percent of the score), faculty
resource (20 percent) and stu
dent selectivity (15 percent).
The remaining 20 percent of
the score is shared among fac
tors like financial resources,
graduation rate performance
and alumni donation rates. The
schools largely volunteer the
categorical data through sur
veys, with the blanks filled in by
the American Association of
University Professors, the
NCAA and the U.S. Depart

ment of Education's National
Center for Education Statistics.
Whether it be to determine
which school is most deserving of
their tuition dollars or to see
recognition of their institution's
achievement, students and ad
ministrators alike await the year
ly U.S. News rankings. Nonethe
less, many of even the most glori
fied universities contend that a
number cannot do justice to the
college experience offered by
their specific school.
In a news statement issued by
Princeton , administrators
claimed rankings "cannot cap
ture the distinctiveness of any in
stitution or whether one or an
other university might be an ap
propriate match for any individ
ual student."

Though Stanford has consis
tently maintained a top spot in
the U.S. News rankings, univer
sity officials have always claimed
that Stanford offers a unique ex
perience and students selected
for reasons beyond grades and
exam scores.
"I don't think a ranking could
ever capture how much I've
taken out of my college experi
ence," said rising junior Ratul
Narain. "But, it's still pretty cool
that other people seem to think a
lot of Stanford too."
While many administrators
and students contend that the in
tangible "college experience"
cannot be captured in a number,
the U.S. News ranking system
will continue to play a large role
in school selection.
