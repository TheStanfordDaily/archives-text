# Maples Pavilion renovation expected to be finished earlier than scheduled
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
The renovations to Maples
Pavilion featuring a four-sided,
center-hung scoreboard with
video display, 360-degree con
course plaza, speakers in en
larged restrooms, elevators and
new seats will be completed a
month ahead of schedule, on
Dec. 1 of this year.
Assistant Athletic Director
Gary Migdol attributed the ear
lier completion to "great collab
oration between people in the
Athletic Department who've
worked on the project and con

tractors who've put in extra
hours and done a fantastic job
of keeping not only on sched
ule, but ahead of schedule.
"And our hats off to them,"
Migdol added.
While the arena will be ready
for occupation on Dec. 1, the
first game in Maples will take
place on Dec. 10 when the
women's basketball team plays
Pepperdine at 7 p.m. There will
be "some gala event" surround
ing the opening, the details of
which are still being worked
out, according to Migdol.
With the renovations being
completed before the expected

January 2005 date, the Cardi
nal women's basketball team
will only have to play four
games at Santa Clara Universi
ty's Levy Center, instead of the
five games they had planned on
playing off campus. The men's
team only has to play one exhi
bition game at the Levy Center
rather than the four games they
were supposed to play off cam
pus before Maples opened for
Pac-10 season play.
"I will be thrilled if Maples
is finished a month early," said
rising junior point guard Chris
