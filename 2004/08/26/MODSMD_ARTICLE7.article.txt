## WEST OF CENTER California's state government: Taxation without representation 
### 
Our local assembly member Joe Simitian tells a story about
trying to line up legislative votes to put a constitutional
amendment on the ballot that would reduce the threshold
for local governments' school parcel tax propositions from
66 percent of the popular vote to 55 percent. To distill: He was asking
elected representatives to vote to allow the people to vote to allow their
local representatives to vote to allow the people to vote, by a superma
jority, to raise taxes exclusively for schools. What did Simitian hear
back? "I can't do that in an election year . . . That's a pro-tax vote!"
Public investment is at a standstill, and our state is suffering. Per
pupil school spending is below the national average, our infrastruc
ture is decaying, Californians increasingly don't have health insur
ance and law enforcement has to rely on obsolete, incompatible ra
dios donated by manufacturers. Even some aspects of the regulatory
climate can be traced to an inability to raise taxes: Because it can't in
crease public health spending, the legislature has required business-

es above a certain size to otter employees health in
surance. We are becoming a first-rate state with a
third-world government.
Reality check: Joe Simitian's proposal was four
steps removed from a higher tax bill. But his fellow
assembly members were also right. They would have
paid a price if they had voted to allow voters to allow
governments allow voters to raise taxes. Public in
vestment is at a standstill. How did the people of Cal
ifornia become so allergic to taxation?
The cause is a breakdown in trust between
Californians and the state legislature. With a 66
percent vote threshold to spend monev, budgets

require the support of both Democrats and Republicans. In Sacra
mento these days that rarely happens, and ironically, Californians
actually prefer this legislative gridlock. With safe districts and closed
primaries, state legislators are typically right-to-life Republicans or
right-to-organize Democrats. The compromisers that understand
California's need to invest in good government but are fiscally tough
enough to earn the trust needed to make these investments mostly
just don't get elected.
When legislative districts are safe, there is no longer an electoral
check on officeholders. You are less likely today to get voted out of Cal
ifornia's legislature than you were to get voted off the USSR's Supreme
Soviet under Stalin in the 19605. That's not democracy.
Voters sense this, and they won't give the power to raise taxes to leg
islators they can't get rid of. More than two hundred years after the
American Revolution, we still don't like taxation without representa
tion. The clear solution is nonpartisan electoral redistricting, and there
is only one person in the state with the electoral mandate to make it hap
pen: Arnold Schwarzenegger.
If he fails to enact this campaign promise, Schwarzenegger will be
remembered as a media-savvy but mediocre Republican governor. He
came to power facing a huge gap between taxes and spending, made
it worse with a tax cut, borrowed enough money to pass the problem
on to our generation and then legalized gambling and chipped away
at education and welfare-to-work while letting our outsized prison
population continue to grow. In contrast, if Schwarzenegger takes on
this problem, he will have genuinely changed California government
for the better.
People close to the governator say there are two Arnolds. One
Arnold always has his eye to the camera. He says the voters don't care
about the numbers, and that JFK and Hitler alike were great politicians
because they got the crowds to cheer for them. The other Arnold real
izes that history judges politicians great for what they do, not who cheers
for them. He is ready to take a few political hits to leave the state better
than when he took on the job.
Who's the real Arnold? We'll have to wait and see.
