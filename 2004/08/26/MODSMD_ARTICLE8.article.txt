## Brown: A great decision — except for schools 
### PAUL E. PETERSON 
Oliver Brown — the plaintiff in the 1954
Brow n vs. Board of Education decision — sued
a school board, not a public park commission,
even though such facilities were also segregat
ed. Within the private sector, discrimination
was pervasive.
Yet today, we see marked progress toward
racial equality in parks, recreation programs,
politics, communications, commerce and indus
try — but not in schools.
The irony is all the greater, inasmuch as the
Supreme Court, in Brown, outlawed only school
segregation — on the shaky grounds that such
segregation harmed the "hearts and minds" of
African American children.
But at a time when the workplace is more
often racially mixed than not, Brown's educa
tional consequences remain ambivalent. On
the plus side, most school districts have be
come as integrated as city demographics allow.
But the price paid for this integration has been
high — involuntary busing that separated
schools from families and communities; large,
difficult-to-manage school campuses; white
Oight; and lowered expectations for students
of all social backgrounds.
Worse, the performance of African Ameri
can students has continued to trail that of
whites. Although the gap narrowed in the
1980s, it opened again in the 19905, a time when
the principles of Brown should have been firm
ly entrenched.
Conventional liberals blame "politicians" for
inadequate funding or "society" for its abiding, if
now hidden, racism. But money has seldom
bought educational progress, and one is hard put

to explain the survival of racism in schools when
it is on the wane elsewhere.
Conventional conservatives are more apt
to "blame the victim," suggesting that the
child-rearing practices of the African Ameri
can family are the root cause. Yet the dispari
ties in black and white achievement are small
est among preschoolers — the age at which
family influences are pronounced and school
influence nil.
Closer to the truth are those who blame Hol
lywood, television and the fashion industry for
fostering a drug-infested, anti-learning, "hip
hop" youth culture that burgeoned in the 19905.
But if street culture is the problem, then assigned
neighborhood schools are not the solution. Onh
in rare instances can traditional neighborhood
schools suppress the seductions of their immedi
ate environment.
Learning is better fostered when schools
draw boundaries that separate classroom life
from the street-culture opiates. Because good
private schools have discovered this secret,
African American students who attend them are
much more likely than their public school peers
to complete college.
Unfortunately, some still argue against
school choice on the grounds that African Amer
ican families are too ill-informed to pick good
schools. But interest, knowledge and commit
ment will come naturally to all parents, once
choice is made available. To claim otherwise is
racist in the extreme. School choice is, indeed,
the civil rights issue of our time.
