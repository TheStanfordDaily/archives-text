## Teaching the kids to read 
### HERBERT J. WALBERG 
Because learning in most subjects depends on reading
skills, reading proficiency can be considered the most im
portant goal in the early grades. Vet a National Assessment
of Educational Progress survey shows that only 29 percent
of fourth graders are proficient in reading. Children who
fall substantially behind in reading in the early grades are
unlikely to catch up — meaning that the process of drop
ping out of high school often starts in the early years.
The problem is more acute for children who live in
poverty. By age four, poor children are exposed to
about 13 million words used by their parents, mostly
in simple sentences, whereas the affluent child is ex
posed to about 45 million words, often in more com
plex sentences.
Researchers have synthesized a great number of con
trol-group studies that reveal scientific principles for effec
tively teaching reading. Preschoolers, for example, benefit
greatlv from talking with and receiving coaching from their
parents, from whom they learn vocabulary, grammar, pro
nunciation and a general knowledge of the world. Their
parents and teachers can also foster sound and letter recog
nition, knowledge of how letters combine to form sounds,
and "decoding," or sounding out words.
After mastering these elements, students need suffi
cient practice to gain fluency and meaningful oral reading.
If fourth graders are still struggling with sounding out
words, and if they need a tongue between their teeth to re
member the sound blend of "th," they are unlikely to enjoy
reading and thrive academically. The more students read
out loud and to themselves, the more they build their flu
ency as well as their vocabulary and the knowledge to un
derstand new texts.
As readers progress, they learn "comprehension strate
gy" — the identification of questions or purposes —to
guide their reading and measure their progress. They need
explicit instruction in how to skim material fora quick
overview or to find a given fact or idea, but they also need to
learn to read a poem or scientific passage reflectively, inten
sively, and perhaps repeatedly until they have a deep and
thorough understanding. Skilled readers have learned to
adapt such methods to their purposes and to look for mile
stones of their progress.
Wise teachers know the inefficiency of teaching students
things they already know and things they are not yet able to
learn. Parents, teachers and students themselves can make
reading time more efficient by choosing material that is suf
ficiently but not overly challenging. Moreover, choosing
material that is inherently interesting for particular students
may enhance motivation.
finally, students need to know how they are progress
ing. Conversations with teachers and parents, classroom dis
cussions and quizzes and formal examinations can provide
useful information about students' mastery of texts and the
strengths and weaknesses of their specific reading skills.
Each of these principles has an excellent record of ios
tering skilled, masterful reading. If all children were afford
ed the scientific principles for effectively teaching reading,
perhaps nine in 10 rather than three in 10 would be profi
cient readers by fourth grade, and we could expect their
success to show in later grades and in high school comple
tion rates.
