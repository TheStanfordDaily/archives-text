## Original sin: Prohibition and psychology 
### PATRICK MATTIMORE 
White House officials are
debating whether or not to re
lease additional photos of the
abuse that took place in Abu
Ghraib prison. By either ra
tioning or prohibiting access al
together, the government can
guarantee that the public's
thirst to see the photos will be
unquenchable, decidedly not
the government's intention.
The Biblical story of Adam
and Eve suggests that Eve ate the
apple because she was tempted
by the serpent. Had there been
no serpent would Eve still have
eaten the forbidden fruit? Psy
chological research suggests she
would have because God first
prohibited Adam and Eve from
eating it.
There are two psychological
factors that would have coalesced
to propel Eve to transgress, even
in the absence of the serpent. The
first factor is attention. We are all
aware of how an admonition not
to think about something, such as
a pink elephant, inevitably brings
that thought to mind. Until we se
lectively attend to something, it

remains outside our perceptions.
Once our attention is focused
upon an object our desire for that
object is heightened when it is ei
ther scarce or prohibited to us.
Remarkably, that principle oper
ates even when we feel no attrac
tion to the item initially.
Psychologist Robert Cialdini
in his classic book, "Influence,"
tells an instructive tale about the
Mormon Temple in his home
town of Mesa, Ariz. Cialdini re
ports that he had never been in
terested enough in the temple
to go inside until the day he
read a newspaper article that
told of a special inner section of
Mormon temples to which no
one had access but faithful
members of the church.
Fora few days after the Mesa
temple was refurbished, Church
law allowed non-Mormon visi
tors to see the temple area tradi
tionally banned to them. Cialdi
ni resolved to take the tour until
he called a friend who wondered
why he seemed so intent on visit
ing someplace he had never
been inclined to see and in which
he expected to find nothing
more spectacular or stirring
than what he might see at a
number of other churches in the
area. Cialdini realized the sole
allure of seeing the temple was
because that possibility would
soon be unavailable.
Prohibitions have general ap
plicability and consequences. Ad
vertisers frequendy sell products
with a taste of forbidden fruit in
mind. One of the most successful
ad campaigns of all time was for
Charmin, the bathroom tissue.
Until customers were advised
"Please don't squeeze the
Charmin," it is doubtful that any
one ever had.
The psychology of prohibi
tion can inform our views about

how censorship works. A few
weeks ago in the now completed
trial of Frank Quattrone, the
judge ordered the media not to
release the names of jurors
pending the trial's outcome. De
spite the fact that there was gen
eral agreement among the
media that jurors' names should
not be released, several newspa
pers hired a lawyer to protest
the judge's ruling. The judge
had, in effect, made something
appealing which had previously
had no appeal.
Many years ago when strug
gling author Mark Twain re
leased his book "Huckleberry
Finn," Twain got an unexpect
ed gift from the city of Boston.
The book was "banned in
Boston," and naturally went on
to become a must-read every
where. Federico Fellini, the
Italian filmmaker once said,
"Censorship is advertising paid
by the government."
Want Howard Stern's show
to attract a few more listeners?
Get Clear Channel to pull him of
the air. Ted Koppel read the
names of soldiers killed in Iraq
without embellishment for half
an hour. His media provider
blacked out the show on its ABC
affiliates and viewership climbed
by 30 percent. Disney's decision
not to distribute Michael
Moore's new film has surely
been a boon to that production.
Understanding the psycho
logical factors that underlie the
appeal of prohibitions can enable
us to better orchestrate choices
for ourselves, and should cause
the Government to release the
prison photos.
