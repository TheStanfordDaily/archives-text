## The
						issue of school funding 
### ERIC A. HANUSHEK 
Many states are currently
locked in court battles in which
they are being sued to provide "ad
equate" funding for their schools.
These adequacy suits, which have
spilled over into legislatures, rep
resent yet another example of a sit
uation where words and slogans
do not match reality.
For three decades, state school
funding has been driven by a series of
court cases concerned with fiscal equi
ty. These cases have a common argu
ment: the individual state constitu
tions require a greater parity in spend
ing between rich and poor school dis
tricts than is typically observed under
mixed state and local funding.
But the supporters of the law
suits were dismayed by the end
results. In fact, some state legisla
tures that were required by the
courts to equalize spending
across districts did not come up to
the highest-spending districts but
instead kept the overall level con
stant. The proponents of these
suits were unhappy because their
desire had been to pry more
school spending out of the states.
In reaction to this apparently
unfortunate outcome, a new kind of
lawsuit and argument developed —
the need for adequate spending.
Under this new legal strategy, a sys
tem could be equalized but could
still be inadequate to provide an ap
propriate education. For example,
one group claimed that New York
State was not providing the constitu
tionally required adequate spend
ing to New York City, even though
New York City schools were spend
ing more than the average being
spent in 42 states.
For the proponents of greater
school spending, adopting the word
"adequate" was a great coup, similar
to adopting the word "equity" many
years before. Surely we all want both
equitable and adequate spending.

The crucial ingredient to these
arguments is an implicit presump
tion that spending translates di
recdy to school quality. Unfortu
nately, a massive amount of evi
dence indicates that spending on
schools is not closely related to
school quality or student learning.
How could this be? In the sim
plest terms there are too few incen
tives that reward good perfor
mance and too few disincentives to
penalize poor performance in our
public schools. Schools introduce
unproven and unproductive pro
grams. They overpay poor teach
ers (and underpay good teachers).
They tolerate ineffective adminis
trators at the state, district, and in
dividual school level. In sum, they
do not ensure that any additional
funds will be spent in ways that im
prove student learning.
Because funding is not related
either to overall student perfor
mance or to the performance of spe
cific groups — minorities, disadvan
taged students or urban students —
it is not a good index of equity. Nor
is it possible to calculate how much
needs to be spent to ensure ade
quate student performance.
Thus, when legislatures
search for adequacy in funding or
when courts demand it, they do
not realize that it is a search for the
Holy Grail — a noble but ultimate
ly futile effort. The proponents of
adequacy on the other hand know
exacdy what is going on. By ex
ploiting this term, they are able to
press for greater spending, know
ing that whatever is spent now will
be insufficient and that more will
be needed tomorrow.
When asked to rally around
equity and adequacy in education,
be skeptical because those words do
not mean what you think they do.
