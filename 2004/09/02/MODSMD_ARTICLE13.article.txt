## The
						Olympics: Not so big a deal 
### 
With the amount of activity in the sports
world this week, I would be remiss if 1
didn't touch on everything, so here goes:
The vast majority of the Olympics is a farce.
I think rhythmic gymnastics is actually just a conspiracy
put together by NBC to provide extra material for weak
Jay Leno jokes.
To the Greek fans who delayed the start of the men's
200-meter final, while whistling and calling for Konstan
tinos Kenteris — later amid claims that a United States
backed conspiracy held him out of the Olympics: You
are dumb. Even if Kenteris, who failed to show up fora
drug test and then voluntarily withdrew from the
Olympics, had been there and run his personal-best time
of 20.09, it would have earned him fourth place and no
medal, behind all three American pig-dog competitors.

Is it just me, or do American
athletes tend to be significantly
better-looking than their Olympic
opponents (with the obvious ex
ception of the Swedes)? I guess
you could argue that this is a cul
tural bias on my part, but I don't
know of any cultures that consid
er braces on a 30-year-old female
beach volleyball player attractive.
Congratulations to the Ameri
can men's basketball team on their
bronze medals after they heroical
ly came back to defeat big, bad

Lithuania in the third-place game. I'm sure they'll wear
them with pride back in the States.
The most important lesson we got from this Olympics
is that judges are worthless. Paul Hamm is on the verge
of losing his all-around gold in gymnastics due to a judg
ing error, and the crowd's booing actually compelled of
ficials to re-evaluate Russian gymnast Sergei Nemov's
score on a high bar routine after a Malaysian judge re
sponded with an inexplicably low mark. If booing were
this effective in real sports (settle down, gymnasts, I
know you could gracefully crush my skull between your
arm and chest if you could reach that high), the Philadel
phia Eagles would win every Super Bowl.
Speaking of the Eagles, 49er fans can rejoice now that
Terrell Owens is catching passes for Philly. And by
"catching," I mean "dropping five passes per game and
then celebrating like he invented the fade pattern when
he scores a touchdown." He managed to drop a pass that
hit him in the chest last Thursday in a preseason game
against the Steelers, which gave me flashbacks to the
hundreds of throws he booted in San Francisco. I can't
tell you how many points my blood pressure has risen
watching tight spirals on 3rd-and-10 bounce off his
palms. His reputation as a money receiver is almost en
tirely based on one big play — the TD catch against the
Packers in the 1999 NFC wild-card game. Pray for pa
tience, Donovan McNabb.
If Stuart Scott's left eye gets any weirder-looking, I
think he will qualify as a Halloween costume. Also, I'm
fairly sure ESPN is cloning their anchors, because he ap
pears on every network at all times.
Consensus No. 1 USC will have to spend the season
without freak-of-nature receiver Mike Williams, which I
choose to interpret to mean that Stanford should beat
them by 35 in their matchup Sept. 25. On the bright
