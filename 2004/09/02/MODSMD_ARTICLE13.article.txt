## The 						Olympics: Not so big a deal 
### 
With the amount of activity in the sports
world this week, I would be remiss if 1
didn't touch on everything, so here goes:
The vast majority of the Olympics is a farce.
I think rhythmic gymnastics is actually just a conspiracy
put together by NBC to provide extra material for weak
Jay Leno jokes.
To the Greek fans who delayed the start of the men's
200-meter final, while whistling and calling for Konstan
tinos Kenteris — later amid claims that a United States
backed conspiracy held him out of the Olympics: You
are dumb. Even if Kenteris, who failed to show up fora
drug test and then voluntarily withdrew from the
Olympics, had been there and run his personal-best time
of 20.09, it would have earned him fourth place and no
medal, behind all three American pig-dog competitors.

Is it just me, or do American
athletes tend to be significantly
better-looking than their Olympic
opponents (with the obvious ex
ception of the Swedes)? I guess
you could argue that this is a cul
tural bias on my part, but I don't
know of any cultures that consid
er braces on a 30-year-old female
beach volleyball player attractive.
Congratulations to the Ameri
can men's basketball team on their
bronze medals after they heroical
ly came back to defeat big, bad

Lithuania in the third-place game. I'm sure they'll wear
them with pride back in the States.
The most important lesson we got from this Olympics
is that judges are worthless. Paul Hamm is on the verge
of losing his all-around gold in gymnastics due to a judg
ing error, and the crowd's booing actually compelled of
ficials to re-evaluate Russian gymnast Sergei Nemov's
score on a high bar routine after a Malaysian judge re
sponded with an inexplicably low mark. If booing were
this effective in real sports (settle down, gymnasts, I
know you could gracefully crush my skull between your
arm and chest if you could reach that high), the Philadel
phia Eagles would win every Super Bowl.
Speaking of the Eagles, 49er fans can rejoice now that
Terrell Owens is catching passes for Philly. And by
"catching," I mean "dropping five passes per game and
then celebrating like he invented the fade pattern when
he scores a touchdown." He managed to drop a pass that
hit him in the chest last Thursday in a preseason game
against the Steelers, which gave me flashbacks to the
hundreds of throws he booted in San Francisco. I can't
tell you how many points my blood pressure has risen
watching tight spirals on 3rd-and-10 bounce off his
palms. His reputation as a money receiver is almost en
tirely based on one big play — the TD catch against the
Packers in the 1999 NFC wild-card game. Pray for pa
tience, Donovan McNabb.
If Stuart Scott's left eye gets any weirder-looking, I
think he will qualify as a Halloween costume. Also, I'm
fairly sure ESPN is cloning their anchors, because he ap
pears on every network at all times.
Consensus No. 1 USC will have to spend the season
without freak-of-nature receiver Mike Williams, which I
choose to interpret to mean that Stanford should beat
them by 35 in their matchup Sept. 25. On the bright

side, we are ranked by SI ahead of Arizona
(75 to 77) and the Cardinal has nine starters
back on defense, meaning that this year
hopefully we won't give up 600 passing
yards per game.
If Adrian Beltre gets voted NL MVP, I
will stab myself in the eye with a rusty fork.
The main argument for not selecting Barry
Bonds seems to be, "But Beltre is having a
breakout year fora first-place team," since it
is an unwritten rule that the MVP must
come from a playoff team and the Giants are
on the bubble. The only factors that matter
in this debate should be that Bonds has a 25-
point advantage in batting average; that he
leads in runs, RBI and OPS; that he has an
on-base percentage of .606 to Beltre's .389
(for you math majors out there, this means
that Bonds could have gone 0 for August
and September and still lead Beltre by a

wide margin in this category) and that he is
down only four in home runs, despite hav
ing 175 fewer at-bats due to his prodigious
walk total. That's like having two months
less to hit in. Barry defines the word "valu
able." Without him, the Giants would be
struggling to make the playoffs in the Ari
zona Fall League.
Number of e-mails 1 received saying Hee
Seop Choi would be a valuable offensive re
source to the Dodgers, after my column be
rating GM Paul DePodesta for trading for
him: seven. Number of RBI has since
becoming a Dodger: 5, with a Herculean
.174 BA.
There is a forthcoming, definitive, an
swer-all-doubters "Sport / Not a Sport" col
umn in the coming month or so. Genius pre
dictions: 1) "Not a Sport" will get more than
its share of use, and 2) I will receive copious
amounts of hate mail. You've been great; I'll
be here all week.

miracles anymore. E-mail him at
