# Fifteen Stanford affiliates get 17 medals during Olympics
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The Olympic Games brought triumph for some,
heartbreak for others, but for the Stanford community
that pinned its hopes to 42 of its own, pride was the only
emotion present as the Olympic torch was put out Sun
day night.
Fifteen Stanford affiliates return home from Athens
this week with a combined 17 medals around their necks.
Eight of those medals were earned since Thursday, and
half of those belong to a fearsome foursome of water polo
alumni: Margie Dingeldein, Ellen Estes, Jackie Frank and
Brenda Villa. The women's water polo squad, which
racked up a 3-2 record in Athens, faltered in semifinal
play and found itself in the bronze medal game on Thurs
day against Australia, the team that trounced Team USA
in Sydney's gold medal match four years ago.
Led by 2003 grad Frank's strong play in goal, in addi
tion to a hat trick and a game-winner by Estes, Team
USA edged out the Aussie squad 6-5 to pick up the
bronze medal.
1992 graduate Julie Foudy added a gold to Stanford's
haul on Thursday as well, playing all 120 minutes of the
2-1 overtime thriller against Brazil. Foudy's perfor
mance was astonishing, as she sprained her ankle only
days earlier.
After the gold medal round, Foudy, who along with
Brandi Chastain, Mia Hamrn, Joy Fawcett and Kristine
Lilly, is hailed as one of soccers "golden girls," announced
that this Olympics was her last. She, along with Fawcett
and Hamm, will retire from the national team this year.
Friday night's pole vault competition was as perfect as
possible for the United States, as American competitors
took the top two medals in the event. Stanford graduate
Toby "Crash" Stevenson grabbed a silver with his jump of
19 feet, 4 1/4 inches, and charmed audiences with his sig
nature, animated competition demeanor.

Stanford swimmer Tara Kirk speeds through the water. She
was one of the 15 Stanford affiliates who brought home a
medal from Athens — she received a silver in the swimming
medley relay race.
"I'm disappointed that I lost, but am I disappointed
that I got a silver? Hell, no," Stevenson told reporters after
the medal ceremony. "[Teammate Timothy Mack and 1
have] been here two weeks, saying to each other, 'let's get
a gold and a silver,' half joking and half serious. And we
did it!"
The Cardinal's final two medals of the Games came
from the place Stanford Olympians have typically been
strongest — the pool. Rising senior Erin Dobratz and in
coming freshman Sara Lowe were both part of the U.S.
synchronized swim team that collected a bronze medal 011
Friday, the team's first medal of any color since the 1996
Games in Atlanta.
At the end of it all, Stanford affiliates had tallied three
gold medals, seven silver and seven bronze, and barely
missed the school record medal count of 21 (set by Stan
ford athletes at the 1924 Olympics.)
