# Men's gymnastics had a rough ride
## 
### 
For those of us passionately in
volved in men's gymnastics,
the last two weeks have been a
little rough.
During our quadrennial 15 min
utes of glory known as the Olympic
Games, the credibility of our competi
tion took a nosedive. Between last
minute rule changes, incorrect start
values, medal controversies and
angry spectators, we have under
standably been bombarded with edi
torials such as one by Josh Belzman of
MSNBC.com suggesting that our
sport should be dropped from the
Olympics altogether for not being an
objective measure of athletic skill.
Could it get any worse for the same
sport that has lost over 100 NCAA
teams in the last three decades?
I think so. Not because I think
there is no fix to the unfortunate er
rors encountered in Athens — there

are ways to deal with the problem -
but because of the effect the usual
remedy will have on future genera
tions of male gymnasts.
I'm not too worried about the sub
jectivity of the sport. People who un
derstand the complicated rules of
men's gymnastics know that with
competent judging, the sport is as
subjective as a game of basketball or
football, though it often doesn't ap
pear that way. For example, the for
mula for calling a foul is inexact at
best, with variables such as severity,
time of foul and player reputation
playing part in the decision to blow a
whistle. In football, can the ball really
be spotted with the precision of
fourth-and-inches?
I'm also not so worried about ram
pant corruption. I have a hard time
attributing the scoring controversies
in Athens to foul play simply because

they can be more easily explained
(though not justified) by the way the
sport deals with the limitations of a
10.0 scoring system. Gymnasts are
well aware of these issues, and in the
perfect storm such as the men's all
around competition, the rest oi the
world is enlightened as well — with
out the help of mischievous judges.
In a way, the controversy in these
Olympics was an ugly manifestation
of what happens when athletes con
stantly become too good for the rules
of their sport. With improved coach
ing techniques, better equipment,
new skills and a better understanding
of the rules, top gymnasts get too
good (or too smart) in a short amount
of time. Someone discovers an "easy
high-scoring combination here, a big
skill there, and — voila! — everyone
