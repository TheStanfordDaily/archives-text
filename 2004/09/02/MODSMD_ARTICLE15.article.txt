# Men's gymnastics had a rough ride
## 
### 
For those of us passionately in
volved in men's gymnastics,
the last two weeks have been a
little rough.
During our quadrennial 15 min
utes of glory known as the Olympic
Games, the credibility of our competi
tion took a nosedive. Between last
minute rule changes, incorrect start
values, medal controversies and
angry spectators, we have under
standably been bombarded with edi
torials such as one by Josh Belzman of
MSNBC.com suggesting that our
sport should be dropped from the
Olympics altogether for not being an
objective measure of athletic skill.
Could it get any worse for the same
sport that has lost over 100 NCAA
teams in the last three decades?
I think so. Not because I think
there is no fix to the unfortunate er
rors encountered in Athens — there

are ways to deal with the problem -
but because of the effect the usual
remedy will have on future genera
tions of male gymnasts.
I'm not too worried about the sub
jectivity of the sport. People who un
derstand the complicated rules of
men's gymnastics know that with
competent judging, the sport is as
subjective as a game of basketball or
football, though it often doesn't ap
pear that way. For example, the for
mula for calling a foul is inexact at
best, with variables such as severity,
time of foul and player reputation
playing part in the decision to blow a
whistle. In football, can the ball really
be spotted with the precision of
fourth-and-inches?
I'm also not so worried about ram
pant corruption. I have a hard time
attributing the scoring controversies
in Athens to foul play simply because

they can be more easily explained
(though not justified) by the way the
sport deals with the limitations of a
10.0 scoring system. Gymnasts are
well aware of these issues, and in the
perfect storm such as the men's all
around competition, the rest oi the
world is enlightened as well — with
out the help of mischievous judges.
In a way, the controversy in these
Olympics was an ugly manifestation
of what happens when athletes con
stantly become too good for the rules
of their sport. With improved coach
ing techniques, better equipment,
new skills and a better understanding
of the rules, top gymnasts get too
good (or too smart) in a short amount
of time. Someone discovers an "easy
high-scoring combination here, a big
skill there, and — voila! — everyone
does similar routines. When the sport
reaches that point, judges have a very hard
time differentiating between the top gym
nasts and start splitting hairs.
For decades, the International Gymnas
tics Federation (FIG) has mitigated this
problem by rewriting the rules after every
Summer Olympics. Drastically. Skills and
combinations are devalued to make room
for bigger and better skills. The result is
fun, spectacular, "crazy" gymnastics — ex
actly what most people love about the sport,
myself included, with the added bonus that
it gets easier to separate the big guns.
Well, in theory anyway.
Because of the rule changes, there are
huge overhead costs in retraining judges
every few years. There is just less time for
consistent judging to permeate the sport,
so universal agreement on credits and de
ductions is rare. And unless they are con
stantly in the gym sharpening their judg
ing skills, silly mistakes are bound to hap
pen. I wish men's gymnastics had the re
sources to evaluate its judges like the pro
fessional sports do, to recognize and learn
from the exceptional judges out there.
Call me an optimist — I believe we will
someday find solution to this problem,
perhaps by dropping the traditional 10.0
scoring system. But it is the second effect
of changing the rules that scare me.
Imagine if basketball raised the basket 3
feet every year. By doing so, you limit the
number of people who can make a basket.
Eventually, when the basket is 50-feet
high, only a couple of players would be
able to participate in the sport.
That's what men's gymnastics is doing.
By improving the competition at the top
level of the sport, we are systematically
shutting people out of the sport so only a
few motivated, usually short and in

jury-free number of people can begin
to compete.
Unlike most sports, it takes years before
a gymnast can perform the simplest ele
ment in the sport. In basketball, for exam
ple, it is possible for someone to make a
basket the first time they ever pick up a
basketball. On the other hand, most peo
ple would die attempting a back flip with
out a few months of training. Now imagine
what it takes to learn a triple back flip. Why
would any boy want to spend so much time
in the gym, risking injury for future glory
when he could be playing ball with his
friends right now?
You really have to love the sport to be
a gymnast.
We are in a no-win situation. If the
rules don't change, we don't stimulate the
advancement, creativity and credibility of
the sport. If rules do change, we diminish
the pool of potential gymnasts who can
hang around long enough to compete in
the system.
Some have suggested a return to the
days when virtuosity and originality were
rewarded with bonus, emphasizing form
and execution while de-emphasizing diffi
culty. Don't raise the basket —just make it
smaller. But this solution is hardly ideal
because the harder judging makes us
more vulnerable to accusations of subjec
tivity and bias.
Without a universal understanding of
what to aim for, we're shooting at 10 dif
ferent (albeit small) baskets.We are well
aware of the problem and now have extra
motivation arrive at a viable solution. We
need to improve our credibility to the
world without making it impossible for
normal human beings to participate. Most
importantly, we need to get involved with
the younger generation of gymnasts so
they are motivated to stick around as long
as possible.
We love die sport too much to let it slip away.

whistle. In football, can the ball really
be spotted with the precision of
fourth-and-inches?
I'm also not so worried about ram
pant corruption. I have a hard time
attributing the scoring controversies
in Athens to foul play simply because

they can be more easily explained
(though not justified) by the way the
sport deals with the limitations of a
10.0 scoring system. Gymnasts are
well aware of these issues, and in the
perfect storm such as the men's all
around competition, the rest oi the
world is enlightened as well — with
out the help of mischievous judges.
In a way, the controversy in these
Olympics was an ugly manifestation
of what happens when athletes con
stantly become too good for the rules
of their sport. With improved coach
ing techniques, better equipment,
new skills and a better understanding
of the rules, top gymnasts get too
good (or too smart) in a short amount
of time. Someone discovers an "easy
high-scoring combination here, a big
skill there, and — voila! — everyone
does similar routines. When the sport
reaches that point, judges have a very hard
time differentiating between the top gym
nasts and start splitting hairs.
For decades, the International Gymnas
tics Federation (FIG) has mitigated this
problem by rewriting the rules after every
Summer Olympics. Drastically. Skills and
combinations are devalued to make room
for bigger and better skills. The result is
fun, spectacular, "crazy" gymnastics — ex
actly what most people love about the sport,
myself included, with the added bonus that
it gets easier to separate the big guns.
Well, in theory anyway.
Because of the rule changes, there are
huge overhead costs in retraining judges
every few years. There is just less time for
consistent judging to permeate the sport,
so universal agreement on credits and de
ductions is rare. And unless they are con
stantly in the gym sharpening their judg
ing skills, silly mistakes are bound to hap
pen. I wish men's gymnastics had the re
sources to evaluate its judges like the pro
fessional sports do, to recognize and learn
from the exceptional judges out there.
Call me an optimist — I believe we will
someday find solution to this problem,
perhaps by dropping the traditional 10.0
scoring system. But it is the second effect
of changing the rules that scare me.
Imagine if basketball raised the basket 3
feet every year. By doing so, you limit the
number of people who can make a basket.
Eventually, when the basket is 50-feet
high, only a couple of players would be
able to participate in the sport.
That's what men's gymnastics is doing.
By improving the competition at the top
level of the sport, we are systematically
shutting people out of the sport so only a
few motivated, usually short and in

jury-free number of people can begin
to compete.
Unlike most sports, it takes years before
a gymnast can perform the simplest ele
ment in the sport. In basketball, for exam
ple, it is possible for someone to make a
basket the first time they ever pick up a
basketball. On the other hand, most peo
ple would die attempting a back flip with
out a few months of training. Now imagine
what it takes to learn a triple back flip. Why
would any boy want to spend so much time
in the gym, risking injury for future glory
when he could be playing ball with his
friends right now?
You really have to love the sport to be
a gymnast.
We are in a no-win situation. If the
rules don't change, we don't stimulate the
advancement, creativity and credibility of
the sport. If rules do change, we diminish
the pool of potential gymnasts who can
hang around long enough to compete in
the system.
Some have suggested a return to the
days when virtuosity and originality were
rewarded with bonus, emphasizing form
and execution while de-emphasizing diffi
culty. Don't raise the basket —just make it
smaller. But this solution is hardly ideal
because the harder judging makes us
more vulnerable to accusations of subjec
tivity and bias.
Without a universal understanding of
what to aim for, we're shooting at 10 dif
ferent (albeit small) baskets.We are well
aware of the problem and now have extra
motivation arrive at a viable solution. We
need to improve our credibility to the
world without making it impossible for
normal human beings to participate. Most
importantly, we need to get involved with
the younger generation of gymnasts so
they are motivated to stick around as long
as possible.
We love die sport too much to let it slip away.

For those of us passionately in
volved in men's gymnastics,
the last two weeks have been a
little rough.
During our quadrennial 15 min
utes of glory known as the Olympic
Games, the credibility of our competi
tion took a nosedive. Between last
minute rule changes, incorrect start
values, medal controversies and
angry spectators, we have under
standably been bombarded with edi
torials such as one by Josh Belzman of
MSNBC.com suggesting that our
sport should be dropped from the
Olympics altogether for not being an
objective measure of athletic skill.
Could it get any worse for the same
sport that has lost over 100 NCAA
teams in the last three decades?
I think so. Not because I think
there is no fix to the unfortunate er
rors encountered in Athens — there

are ways to deal with the problem -
but because of the effect the usual
remedy will have on future genera
tions of male gymnasts.
I'm not too worried about the sub
jectivity of the sport. People who un
derstand the complicated rules of
men's gymnastics know that with
competent judging, the sport is as
subjective as a game of basketball or
football, though it often doesn't ap
pear that way. For example, the for
mula for calling a foul is inexact at
best, with variables such as severity,
time of foul and player reputation
playing part in the decision to blow a
whistle. In football, can the ball really
be spotted with the precision of
fourth-and-inches?
