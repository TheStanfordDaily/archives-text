## Sad but true: Computers and movies a combo from hell 
### SCOTT HOWARD INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
Spurned by the laughable prospect of an
"Alien vs. Predator" movie directed by the vi
sionary behind "Mortal Kombat," I sat down to
watch the original "Predator" and was reminded
of a simple and unavoidable fact: Computers
have ruined movies.
While I'm sure computers were probably used
to a small degree in that 1987 film, they probably
didn't create every character from scratch or con
struct every set without the use of a single ham
mer. Some of the effects shots are wobbly and un
convincing to this discriminating moviegoer's
eyes, but it's obvious that innovation and creativ
ity were employed every step of the way. Genius
es like Stan Winston (the man responsible for the
Predator, the Terminator and the dinosaurs in
"Jurassic Park") and Rick Baker (who master
minded David Naughton's horrifying transfor
mation in "An American Werewolf In London"
and made Eddie Murphy into eight different
people for the "Nutty Professor" movies) em
ployed complex makeup, set design and time
delay photography techniques to achieve stag
gering results. Now they've been largely re
placed by desk jockeys behind computer screens
because today's directors are either too lazy to do
special effects during filming or think their audi
ences are too stupid to tell the difference.
The difference is painfully obvious. Compare
the first "Alien" movies to the later ones. The
creature in the first two movies — which basical
ly consisted of a guy in a suit aided by some pup
peteers — was genuinely frightening, because it
lurked in the shadows and attacked its victims
when we least expected it. In the last movie, the
Alien is computer generated and decidedly un
scary because it's unmistakably fake.
The quality of effects-driven movies has been
on a sharp downward slope since CGI began its

rapid proliferation into the film industry. This is
most notable in George Lucas' butchering of his
own "Star Wars" series, which once stood as a shin
ing example of what great minds could accom
plish with imagination and ingenuity. Now he has
literally torched die original versions of his films
and replaced them with digitally-altered ones. His
recent prequels have paled in comparison, par
tially because the grandeur that comes with real
costumes and sets has been discarded in favor of
constructing everything on a computer screen.
Modern filmmakers' reliance on CGI isn't just
uninspired and bland, it's impersonal and alien
ating. Many people disliked the first "Spider
Man" because Spidey was often reduced to a
shape-shifting blob when he was supposed to be
cruising between die skyscrapers of New York.
The effects were vastly improved for the sequel,
utilizing far more realistic methods (i.e.: Dr. Oc
topus' arms were real). The difference is remark
able, with some critics throwing "best comic book
movie ever made" talk around.
But to really prove my point, think back to
what I consider to be one of the most mind-blow
ing special effects movies ever: "The Ten Com
mandments." The climactic parting of the Red
Sea is incredible even today, and though the Pil
lar of Fire and the Burning Bush look dated,
each one of the animators who created them had
more talent in their pinky fingers than every
techie at ILM combined. Imagine the complete
emotional detachment you would feel during
those sequences if the movie was made today and
totally rendered with computers. It would prob
ably have the dramatic heft of "Van Helsing."
Does anyone really believe that Charlton Hes
ton parted the Red Sea under the direction of
Cecil B. DeMille? No. We as an audience suspend
our disbelief because we understand that it took
a forward-thinking genius to create such a dis
play of bravura. But if cinematic art is to evolve,
Hollywood must stop thinking in terms of pixels.
