### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION GAMER 
just when you thought the world
wide obsession with addicting online
games would setde down, in comes
World of Warcraft, Blizzard Enter
tainment's entry into the hectic world
of massively multiplayer online role
playing games (MMORPGs). Being
hailed as the next best title in the
genre, don't expect to get much done
fall quarter when this game hits.
If you're a serious PC gamer, then
you've already heard of the Warcraft
series, the highly acclaimed real-time
strategy franchise that has been keeping
gamers occupied for many years. World

of Warcraft takes
the rich story devel
oped in the previ
ous titles and puts it
at the center erf" a
giant, beautiful worfd
filled with small vil
lages, sprawhngaties
and some of the
most beautiful nat
ural environments
that you'll ever find

in any MMORPG. Combined with in
ventive enemies, a great game play ex
perience and a decent variety of races
and classes to choose from, World of
Warcraft expects to keep you occupied
fora long, long time.
As with many other MMORPGs, the
object of World of Warcraft is simply to
stay alive. After creating your character,
you are placed in a starter zone filled
with other low level characters and ene
mies (each newbie zone differs depend
ingon race). From there, you can obtain
and complete a large variety of quests,
leveling up your character as well as
finding new weapons and armor that
will boost your stats even further. As you
gain in level, you can leave the starter
area and move on to other more diffi
cult areas, gaining even more items and

experience. As your character becomes
stronger, more exciting abilities and
spells open up, from protective auras to
devastating fireballs. For some gamers,
this repetitive lev eling up objective may
be a turn off, but the wide variety of en
emies, treasure, quests and locations
should keep players occupied.
Another important aspect of World
of Warcraft is the fact that you can basi
cally do whatever you wish. Even at early
levels, vou can travel to distant towns and
villages or ride giant gryphons to other
regions and explore the local culture
there. You can become a powerful fight
ing force to be reckoned with, or become
a master taifor or cook (WoW also pro
vides an entirely different set of skills that

can be acquired by
any player regard
less of race or class).
Some players may
enjoy just explor
ing the beautiful
world of the game,
while others may
enjoy mining ore in
caves and using
such metal to forge
armor for other

players. The possibilities are endless.
World of Warcraft has been in de
velopment for years, and the experi
enced team behind it really shows
through the high quality of this
game. I'm not joking when I say that
graphics wise, it is one of the most
beautiful games I've ever seen (pro
vided you have a fast PC), and the
gameplay and quest system are shap
ing up to be excellent. This is defi
nitely one game to look forward to
when it goes live later this year.
World of Warcraft is scheduled
to be released by the end of the year,
and is currently in a closed beta
state. An open beta is planned in the
weeks before the title is released,
and can be pre ordered at any
major gaming outlet.
