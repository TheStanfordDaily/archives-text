# Roxy hits the jackpot while slinking around Sin City
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
" Whatever happens in Vegas, stays in
Vegas." Forget gambling — Roxy's poker
face has won her enough money to pay fora
quarter's worth of tuition.
If you want a surefire way to make
money, head to the ATM. It's the only ma
chine that guarantees to give you some cash
in return for whatever you put in.
Since the homoerotic talents of
Siegfried and Roy are nowhere to be seen
(not since the white tiger went berserk) at
the Mirage, other Vegas hotspots have
been holding down the entertainment fort.

There's no stronger moodkiller than Ce
line Dion singing her spleen out, so peruse
the many entertainment guides provided
for you for better alternatives. And no,
Roxy's not talking about the free copies of
"Raw," "Naked XXX College Girls" and
"Fantasy Wet Dreams" you encounter
every two seconds along the Strip. Or those
naughty cards those solicitors force upon
you at street corners, as tempting as it is to
have a stripper delivered straight to your
door (like Domino's during an all nighter).
From Elvis impersonators to washed up
singers trying to ride their deceased par
ents' coattails ("Lena Prima: Louis Prima,
that's my Dad!" is a not so subtle produc

tion name) to fame, shows in Vegas are
aplenty. Resisting the impulse to check out
"Thunder from Down Under" (an Aus
tralian male dance troupe) or "Crazy
Girls," I headed past numerous topless re
vues for something more artistic. Cirque
Du Soleil's "O" at the Bellagio was sadly not
about climaxing, as Roxy originally
thought, but it is an extremely wet (think
1.5 million gallon pool used as stage) and
exciting production. If you're looking fora
more titillating experience, head to New
York-New York for Cirque's "Zumanity."
Touted as their first creation to deal with
human sexuality, the show explores "love,
sensuality and eroticism" with a tale of "hu

inanity, emotion, the nature of beauty and
the acceptance of differences" through
dance, aerial theatrics, acrobatics and pul
sating rhythm. Okay, okay, it's just down
right hot!
For some cheaper but just as choreo
graphed thrills, you can head over to the
Crazy Horse Too at the north end of the Strip.
Audience participation in the form of tipping
and purchasing lapdances is encouraged.
If you've had a little too much fun with
those 2-for-l drink deals, Roxy advises you
to stay away from the Stratosphere end of
Las Vegas Blvd. Does the phrase "pulling a
Britney" ring any bells? As pain
less as a drive thru wedding cere
mony sounds ("Would you like
fries with that?"), you should
knowbetter than to get hitched
when you can barely make out
vour soon-to-be-spouse's facial
features. And you thought it
couldn't get worse than waking
up next to your Econ TA after
that crazy SAE kegger.
Need a bite to eat before / after a
hard night of clubbing at Rain, B<xly
English or Studio 54? Wolfgang
Puck and Nobu are just a few of

the names you'll see dropped by
hardcore gourmands in the area.
However, Roxy was a little
turned off by the $$$$$ symbols
indicating how expensive entrees
would be at the Zagat-rated
restaurants. Not only would a
meal and drinks empty out your
wallet, the atmosphere is down
right intimidating at times. Fora
meal that isn't mass-produced or
a threat to your stomach lining,
try the Hard Rock Hotel's Mexi
can restaurant, suggestively
named Pink Taco. If you want a
more modern atmosphere, hit
up the MGM Grand's Diego. One
of the newest additions to the
hotel, it's swanky and sleek
enough to put the aging hipster
to shame yet is modest in prices
for us college kids. You'll defi

nitely impress any date or poten
tial hookup when they see the
restaurant's extensive tequila list.
Starting with fresh complimenta
ry tortilla chips and a trio of sal
sas, from the sweet and spicy
mango mix to the spicier chipo
tle-infused green chile pepper
mix, you can work your way
through smaller appetizers that
are meant to be shared or entrees
such as lime-basil marinated
chicken and flamebroiled steak
tacos. For dessert, pick up a
strawberry margarita popsicle on
your way out.
If you're craving romance, all
you need is an overpriced gon

dola ride at the Venetian (at
night, of course, to avoid the
scorching heat of Vegas by day)
or a couples massage at the ritzy
Canyon Ranch Spa. If you're on
a budget, you can always stroll
through the more than 13,500
square foot Conservatory and
Botanical Cardens at Bellagio or
pause on the bridge walkway to
watch more than 1,000 dancing
fountains in the massive 8.5 acre
lake in front of the hotel. Literal
ly a "ballet" choreographed to
music and lights, you'll hear
them spurt and arc in time to
songs by Andrea Bocelli and Lu
ciano Pavarotti as well as Frank

Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Free is
good, and Vegas is full of offers
you should take advantage of.
Just be careful when something
sounds too good to be true.
In the end, it's hard to screw up
a trip to Vegas. Kven if you lose
your shirt at the blackjack tables,
there's always a cheap bufTet (of
food and well-tanned bodies)
around every corner to soothe
your sorrows. Let's just hope that
your partner is more impressive
and reliable in bed than the Vol
cano at the Mirage that's sup
posed to erupt every fifteen min
utes. That damn thing is always
pretty disappointing.

to stay away from the Stratosphere end of
Las Vegas Blvd. Does the phrase "pulling a
Britney" ring any bells? As pain
less as a drive thru wedding cere
mony sounds ("Would you like
fries with that?"), you should
knowbetter than to get hitched
when you can barely make out
vour soon-to-be-spouse's facial
features. And you thought it
couldn't get worse than waking
up next to your Econ TA after
that crazy SAE kegger.
Need a bite to eat before / after a
hard night of clubbing at Rain, B<xly
English or Studio 54? Wolfgang
Puck and Nobu are just a few of

the names you'll see dropped by
hardcore gourmands in the area.
However, Roxy was a little
turned off by the $$$$$ symbols
indicating how expensive entrees
would be at the Zagat-rated
restaurants. Not only would a
meal and drinks empty out your
wallet, the atmosphere is down
right intimidating at times. Fora
meal that isn't mass-produced or
a threat to your stomach lining,
try the Hard Rock Hotel's Mexi
can restaurant, suggestively
named Pink Taco. If you want a
more modern atmosphere, hit
up the MGM Grand's Diego. One
of the newest additions to the
hotel, it's swanky and sleek
enough to put the aging hipster
to shame yet is modest in prices
for us college kids. You'll defi

nitely impress any date or poten
tial hookup when they see the
restaurant's extensive tequila list.
Starting with fresh complimenta
ry tortilla chips and a trio of sal
sas, from the sweet and spicy
mango mix to the spicier chipo
tle-infused green chile pepper
mix, you can work your way
through smaller appetizers that
are meant to be shared or entrees
such as lime-basil marinated
chicken and flamebroiled steak
tacos. For dessert, pick up a
strawberry margarita popsicle on
your way out.
If you're craving romance, all
you need is an overpriced gon

dola ride at the Venetian (at
night, of course, to avoid the
scorching heat of Vegas by day)
or a couples massage at the ritzy
Canyon Ranch Spa. If you're on
a budget, you can always stroll
through the more than 13,500
square foot Conservatory and
Botanical Cardens at Bellagio or
pause on the bridge walkway to
watch more than 1,000 dancing
fountains in the massive 8.5 acre
lake in front of the hotel. Literal
ly a "ballet" choreographed to
music and lights, you'll hear
them spurt and arc in time to
songs by Andrea Bocelli and Lu
ciano Pavarotti as well as Frank

Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Free is
good, and Vegas is full of offers
you should take advantage of.
Just be careful when something
sounds too good to be true.
In the end, it's hard to screw up
a trip to Vegas. Kven if you lose
your shirt at the blackjack tables,
there's always a cheap bufTet (of
food and well-tanned bodies)
around every corner to soothe
your sorrows. Let's just hope that
your partner is more impressive
and reliable in bed than the Vol
cano at the Mirage that's sup
posed to erupt every fifteen min
utes. That damn thing is always
pretty disappointing.
" Whatever happens in Vegas, stays in
Vegas." Forget gambling — Roxy's poker
face has won her enough money to pay fora
quarter's worth of tuition.
If you want a surefire way to make
money, head to the ATM. It's the only ma
chine that guarantees to give you some cash
in return for whatever you put in.
Since the homoerotic talents of
Siegfried and Roy are nowhere to be seen
(not since the white tiger went berserk) at
the Mirage, other Vegas hotspots have
been holding down the entertainment fort.

There's no stronger moodkiller than Ce
line Dion singing her spleen out, so peruse
the many entertainment guides provided
for you for better alternatives. And no,
Roxy's not talking about the free copies of
"Raw," "Naked XXX College Girls" and
"Fantasy Wet Dreams" you encounter
every two seconds along the Strip. Or those
naughty cards those solicitors force upon
you at street corners, as tempting as it is to
have a stripper delivered straight to your
door (like Domino's during an all nighter).
From Elvis impersonators to washed up
singers trying to ride their deceased par
ents' coattails ("Lena Prima: Louis Prima,
that's my Dad!" is a not so subtle produc

tion name) to fame, shows in Vegas are
aplenty. Resisting the impulse to check out
"Thunder from Down Under" (an Aus
tralian male dance troupe) or "Crazy
Girls," I headed past numerous topless re
vues for something more artistic. Cirque
Du Soleil's "O" at the Bellagio was sadly not
about climaxing, as Roxy originally
thought, but it is an extremely wet (think
1.5 million gallon pool used as stage) and
exciting production. If you're looking fora
more titillating experience, head to New
York-New York for Cirque's "Zumanity."
Touted as their first creation to deal with
human sexuality, the show explores "love,
sensuality and eroticism" with a tale of "hu

inanity, emotion, the nature of beauty and
the acceptance of differences" through
dance, aerial theatrics, acrobatics and pul
sating rhythm. Okay, okay, it's just down
right hot!
For some cheaper but just as choreo
graphed thrills, you can head over to the
Crazy Horse Too at the north end of the Strip.
Audience participation in the form of tipping
and purchasing lapdances is encouraged.
