### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
" Whatever happens in Vegas, stays in
Vegas." Forget gambling â€” Roxy's poker
face has won her enough money to pay fora
quarter's worth of tuition.
If you want a surefire way to make
money, head to the ATM. It's the only ma
chine that guarantees to give you some cash
in return for whatever you put in.
Since the homoerotic talents of
Siegfried and Roy are nowhere to be seen
(not since the white tiger went berserk) at
the Mirage, other Vegas hotspots have
been holding down the entertainment fort.

There's no stronger moodkiller than Ce
line Dion singing her spleen out, so peruse
the many entertainment guides provided
for you for better alternatives. And no,
Roxy's not talking about the free copies of
"Raw," "Naked XXX College Girls" and
"Fantasy Wet Dreams" you encounter
every two seconds along the Strip. Or those
naughty cards those solicitors force upon
you at street corners, as tempting as it is to
have a stripper delivered straight to your
door (like Domino's during an all nighter).
From Elvis impersonators to washed up
singers trying to ride their deceased par
ents' coattails ("Lena Prima: Louis Prima,
that's my Dad!" is a not so subtle produc

aplenty. Resisting the impulse to check out
"Thunder from Down Under" (an Aus

Girls," I headed past numerous topless re
vues for something more artistic. Cirque
Du Soleil's "O" at the Bellagio was sadly not
about climaxing, as Roxy originally
thought, but it is an extremely wet (think
1.5 million gallon pool used as stage) and
exciting production. If you're looking fora
more titillating experience, head to New
York-New York for Cirque's "Zumanity."
Touted as their first creation to deal with
human sexuality, the show explores "love,
sensuality and eroticism" with a tale of "hu

inanity, emotion, the nature of beauty and
the acceptance of differences" through
dance, aerial theatrics, acrobatics and pul
sating rhythm. Okay, okay, it's just down
right hot!
For some cheaper but just as choreo
graphed thrills, you can head over to the
Crazy Horse Too at the north end of the Strip.
Audience participation in the form of tipping
and purchasing lapdances is encouraged.
If you've had a little too much fun with
those 2-for-l drink deals, Roxy advises you
to stay away from the Stratosphere end of
Las Vegas Blvd. Does the phrase "pulling a
