## Workplace advisory committee finds shortcomings 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A report released at the beginning of Au
gust by University President John Hennessy's
advisory committee on workplace policies has
outlined several problems that currently exist
within the University's employment system,
in addition to recommendations for the im
provement of worker welfare and the logistics
of Stanford human resources.
The committee's core finding is diat very lit
tle information is known about the people die
University employs, including whether or not
employees are provided widi healdi insurance
and even die exact number of employees that
work on campus at any given time.
"We know very little about the people
who work for us in temporary jobs and

maybe nothing about the people who work
on campus as part of a contract to do ser
vices," Human Resources Director Diane
Peck told the Stanford News Service.
Ilie report also unearthed an extremely
high turnover rate for University workers, es
pecially diose employed by contractors for low
wage labor. It states that 67 percent of workers
making $8 or less per hour left their jobs by die
end of the year indicating a low rate of worker
satisfaction, leading to a decline in productivi
ty. According to die committee, the status of
worker health insurance is a major factor in the
well being of University employees.
Despite die dissatisfaction of some employ
ees, die report confirmed the satisfaction of
other groups, notably those who are provided
widi health insurance, lliis point is of particu
lar interest to die University, as it also shows

what future actions might be taken to improve
employment conditions for other workers.
The first recommended steps in this di
rection include reform of the current em
ployee grievance procedure to include tem
porary and contacted workers, the removal
of restrictions on the living wage that will
allow more casual workers to benefit from
the policy, and the increased collection of
data on workers and wages that will allow
Stanford to further adjust the living wage to
better meet people's needs.
The advisory committee, comprised of
faculty, staff members and students, also
discussed the possibility of an employment
agency run by Stanford itself in order to
ensure that all critical employment infor
mation is readily available and good em
ployment conditions are maintained.

One of the report's most troubling reve
lations is the fact that workers hired for es
sentially the same work are being paid dif
ferent wages. At the end of last year it was es
timated that temporary and casual employ
ees comprised 16 percent of Stanford's
workforce. Many of these workers earned
far less than nearly all of the University's
regular employees even though some were
engaged in similar types of work.
The committee's report states, "We have
heard descriptions of the work of some tempo
rary and casual employees, and some of them
are close to the work of regular employees."
In order to rectify the problem the advi
sory committee recommends that the Uni
versity create more detailed job descriptions
