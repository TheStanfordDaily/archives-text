# Munger gift to ensure housing for all at Law School
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Thanks to a record $43.5 mil
lion gift from billionaire Charles
Munger, Stanford Law School
will be the only top law school in
the country to guarantee its stu
dents three years of apartment
style, on-campus housing as early
as fall 2007.
Fhe gift is believed to be the
largest individual gift ever given out
right to an American law school and
is greater than the total of all previ
ous gifts to Stanford for student
housing added together, according
to Kathleen Sullivan, dean of the
Law School, who described it as "a
wonderful event for Stanford."
The gift from Charles T.
Munger, vice chairman of Berk
shire Hathaway and a partner at

the Munger, Tolles and Olson law
firm, and his wife, Nancy B.
Munger was announced last
Thursday. While Charles attended
Harvard Law School, Nancy is a
Stanford alumna and served on the
Board of Trustees. Several of t heir
children and grandchildren have
also attended Stanford.
The relatively unusual gift to
ward housing came about as a re
sult of a three-year conversation
between the donor, the Universi
ty and trustees, said Catherine
Nardone, associate dean of exter
nal relations at the Law School.
Munger is said to have "very
strong ideas about the project."
"I would argue that all the uni
versities in the country underweight
the value of housing. Harvard and
Stanford and so forth are no excep
tion," Munger said. "Good housing

will cause more students to be at
tracted to Stanford and will improve
the quality of education."
"More automatic mixing of
students, better, bigger rooms,
more common facilities, better
sound-proofing and very gra
cious landscaping," were some of
Munger's recommendations for
the new residence.
The gift will cover a "good
chunk" of the costs fora new grad
uate student apartment complex,
which would be built in the parking
lot behind Stern Hall and the Law
School, but additional fundraising
will be necessary, according to Nar
done. The new residence will have
several hundred studio and two
bedroom apartment units and
should have plenty of room for
non-law graduate students.
Munger described the pro

ject's size as "enormous" and said
that it would accommodate all of
the law students, a lot of the busi
ness students, as well as other
graduate students.
There are 1,200 graduate stu
dents without campus housing,
including a third of Stanford's 570
law students. Living in Palo Alto,
where the cost of living is astro
nomical, is difficult for those stu
dents, who often have little in
come to spend, Sullivan told The
Daily in October.
Sullivan and Nardone also
pointed out the importance of this
gift in assisting the University's
ability to expand academic space.
Santa Clara County's General Use
Permit states that the University
must expand its housing before it
increases its academic space. The
new graduate residence will subse

quently allow Stanford to add
more academic facilities.
"[The residence] will make
possible the construction of new
laboratories and classrooms for all
Stanford students," Sullivan said.
"Biologists, engineers and many
others thus will benefit from a
project that started out as a law
school dorm."
The new residence should also
free up the current Law School
dorm, Crothers Hall, to house up
to 240 undergraduate students.
An ideal timetable for the pro
ject, according to Cardone, would
be a concept and design approval
from the trustees in October,
breaking ground in the spring and
opening the residence in fall 2007.
"I don't think there is any other
university that's going to have hous
ing like this," Munger concluded.
