# New squad of Dollies is ready to cheer on the Cardinal this autumn
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Sporting white gloves to
match their near permanent
grins, a new squad of Stan
ford Dollies has arrived on
campus to make their mark
and train for the many chal
lenges that lie ahead. Over
the next few weeks the formi
dable fivesome — composed
entirely of sophomores —
will choreograph new dances
and learn the traditional
moves of their forebears, all
the while striving to embody
the distinctive spirit of the Le

land Stanford Junior Univer
sity Marching Band.
To ensure that this year's
group was equal to the task,
the Band held grueling audi
tions during the spring, judg
ing prospective Dollies (known
as Pro Dos) on everything from
dance skill to personality.
"Dollies must be smiling
and cheerful at all times, so
basically we sat them all down
and made them watch old
Polly Shore and Carrot Top
movies and whenever one of
them stopped smiling, she
was automatically cut," said
Band representative Dan

Bentley, a recent graduate.
Once selected, those who
made the cut — numbered
according to height —
Megan Hoarfrost (no. 1),
Lisa Asari (no. 2), Nicole
D'Arcy (no. 3), Jessica Whit
ten (no. 4) and Carrie Ed
wards (no. 5), immediately
went to work learning and
creating 20 dances with a lit
tle help from retired Dollies
and the Band's live music.
And now, with only two
days to go before the first
home football game, the
group has kicked practice into
high gear, dancing for seven hours
every day, plotting new steps and
brushing up on those they inherit
ed. Rehearsing weekly with the
Band, this year's Dollies say they
feel like a solid addition to the
Shak's quirky ensemble.
"The schedule has been pretty
physically challenging, but also a
lot of fun," said Hoarfrost, who
has been dancing for 11 years. "It
is awesome to spend the end of
my summer dancing on campus
with four really good friends."
According to Bentley, this
strenuous six-week training peri
od is critical to the cultivation of
serious and successful Dollies.
"They have to learn how to work
as a cohesive group while constant
ly being mauled by adoring fans,
enemies, wandering tubas, small
children, what have you," he said.
" rhe Band sets the scene, but the
Dollies are expected to steal it."
Clad in prim dresses and daz
zling white tennis shoes, it seems
odd that the squad is a main pil
lar of the unruly LSJUMB. Yet
while the current Dollies agree
that they were intimidated by the
Band's rowdiness at first, they

have quickly come to feel just like
one of the gang.
"Part of the reason I love Stan
ford so much is because it is so
unique compared to other uni
versities," said Whitten, who has
been dancing since age three."I
think the Band is a prime exam
ple of this and I am proud to take
part in it."
The way Hoarfrost sees it, the
two groups are responsible for
watching each other's backs.
"I'm a little nervous to venture
into Cal territory for the Big
Game, but with the Band backing
us up, I'm sure we'll emerged un
scathed," she said.
Despite their close ties with
the Band, the Dollies are look
ing forward to setting them
selves apart when it comes to
their performances. For exam
ple, the squad must come up
with a special themed costume
to wear for the Big Game that
will remain secret — even from
the Band —until they are un
veiled on game day.
"What makes the Dollie expe
rience so rewarding and some
times challenging is that we are
self-run, which means we have to
depend on each other for sup
port, encouragement, and some
times even discipline," said Asari,
who claims that she started danc
ing even before learning to walk.
"Without the aid of a coach we

have become more reliant on the
group dynamic to make decisions
and get the most out of our year
as Dollies."
Edwards, who will moonlight
as a Dollie when not studying
for mechanical engineering,
concurs that the Dollie lifestyle
is not nearly as easy as it might
appear, even if they do get the
best seats in the house at basket
ball games.
"The more difficult duties of
being a Dollie will probably be
giving up all other activities and
devoting all my time to the other
Dollies and the Band," she said,
adding that she is sure the expe
rience and friendships gained
will be well worth the effort.
Every year the Dollies must
give it their all at sporting
events, rallies and anywhere
the Band decides to randomly
show up. Still, Asari doesn't see
the demanding performances
being the toughest aspect of
her term.
"I believe the most challeng
ing thing we will encounter will
be next spring when we have to
turn in our dresses and gloves as
the new group of five girls take
their turn in the long-standing
tradition of Dollie-ness," she
said. "So far, it has been such an
incredible experience that I
don't think I could find it any
where else."

ing thing we will encounter will
be next spring when we have to
turn in our dresses and gloves as
the new group of five girls take
their turn in the long-standing
tradition of Dollie-ness," she
said. "So far, it has been such an
incredible experience that I
don't think I could find it any
where else."
Sporting white gloves to
match their near permanent
grins, a new squad of Stan
ford Dollies has arrived on
campus to make their mark
and train for the many chal
lenges that lie ahead. Over
the next few weeks the formi
dable fivesome — composed
entirely of sophomores —
will choreograph new dances
and learn the traditional
moves of their forebears, all
the while striving to embody
the distinctive spirit of the Le

land Stanford Junior Univer
sity Marching Band.
To ensure that this year's
group was equal to the task,
the Band held grueling audi
tions during the spring, judg
ing prospective Dollies (known
as Pro Dos) on everything from
dance skill to personality.
"Dollies must be smiling
and cheerful at all times, so
basically we sat them all down
and made them watch old
Polly Shore and Carrot Top
movies and whenever one of
them stopped smiling, she
was automatically cut," said
Band representative Dan

Bentley, a recent graduate.
Once selected, those who
made the cut — numbered
according to height —
Megan Hoarfrost (no. 1),
Lisa Asari (no. 2), Nicole
D'Arcy (no. 3), Jessica Whit
ten (no. 4) and Carrie Ed
wards (no. 5), immediately
went to work learning and
creating 20 dances with a lit
tle help from retired Dollies
and the Band's live music.
And now, with only two
days to go before the first
home football game, the
group has kicked practice into
high gear, dancing for seven hours
every day, plotting new steps and
brushing up on those they inherit
ed. Rehearsing weekly with the
Band, this year's Dollies say they
feel like a solid addition to the
Shak's quirky ensemble.
"The schedule has been pretty
physically challenging, but also a
lot of fun," said Hoarfrost, who
has been dancing for 11 years. "It
is awesome to spend the end of
my summer dancing on campus
with four really good friends."
According to Bentley, this
strenuous six-week training peri
od is critical to the cultivation of
serious and successful Dollies.
"They have to learn how to work
as a cohesive group while constant
ly being mauled by adoring fans,
enemies, wandering tubas, small
children, what have you," he said.
" rhe Band sets the scene, but the
Dollies are expected to steal it."
Clad in prim dresses and daz
zling white tennis shoes, it seems
odd that the squad is a main pil
lar of the unruly LSJUMB. Yet
while the current Dollies agree
that they were intimidated by the
Band's rowdiness at first, they

have quickly come to feel just like
one of the gang.
"Part of the reason I love Stan
ford so much is because it is so
unique compared to other uni
versities," said Whitten, who has
been dancing since age three."I
think the Band is a prime exam
ple of this and I am proud to take
part in it."
The way Hoarfrost sees it, the
two groups are responsible for
watching each other's backs.
"I'm a little nervous to venture
into Cal territory for the Big
Game, but with the Band backing
us up, I'm sure we'll emerged un
scathed," she said.
Despite their close ties with
the Band, the Dollies are look
ing forward to setting them
selves apart when it comes to
their performances. For exam
ple, the squad must come up
with a special themed costume
to wear for the Big Game that
will remain secret — even from
the Band —until they are un
veiled on game day.
"What makes the Dollie expe
rience so rewarding and some
times challenging is that we are
self-run, which means we have to
depend on each other for sup
port, encouragement, and some
times even discipline," said Asari,
who claims that she started danc
ing even before learning to walk.
"Without the aid of a coach we

have become more reliant on the
group dynamic to make decisions
and get the most out of our year
as Dollies."
Edwards, who will moonlight
as a Dollie when not studying
for mechanical engineering,
concurs that the Dollie lifestyle
is not nearly as easy as it might
appear, even if they do get the
best seats in the house at basket
ball games.
"The more difficult duties of
being a Dollie will probably be
giving up all other activities and
devoting all my time to the other
Dollies and the Band," she said,
adding that she is sure the expe
rience and friendships gained
will be well worth the effort.
Every year the Dollies must
give it their all at sporting
events, rallies and anywhere
the Band decides to randomly
show up. Still, Asari doesn't see
the demanding performances
being the toughest aspect of
her term.
