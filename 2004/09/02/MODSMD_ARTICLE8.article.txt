# ICFA passes on SLAC approach

The soon-to-be largest particle accel
erator will use German "cold" super
conductor technology instead of the
room temperature approach that the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) has favored in the past, the In
ternational Committee for Future Ac
celerators (ICFA) decided on Aug. 20.
A particle accelerator creates electrons
and their positive counterpart, positrons,
then boosts their energy level and acceler
ates them. Finally, the electrons and
positrons collide and are annihilated,
which results in a release of energy and
the creation of novel particles. The two
technologies — cold versus room tem
perature — differed in the approach to

accelerating the electrons and positrons.
"The two technologies were both
considered to be viable," said Jonathan
Dorfan, the director of SLAC. "[Choos
ing one over the other] was something
that needed to be done in order to pool
our human and monetary resources."
Physicists will work on a new design
that uses the superconductors of the
"cold" technology but may also incorpo
rate aspects of the room temperature
technology. The SLAC team, which con
sists of approximately 3,000 scientists, will
be deeply involved in the creation of the
technology which will eventually be used
in the International Linear Collider.
"Everybody acknowledges that the
strongest assembled team Is at SI AC," Dorfan
said. "We will be crucial to the process."
Thus, while the decision to use
superconductor technology was
disappointing for SLAC, Dorfan
still views the project as a great op
portunity for the physicists at SLAC.
Although plans are still changing,
the final collider may be up to 25
miles long underground and is esti
mated to cost six to eight billion dol
lars, according to The Mercury
News. Furthermore, scientists hope

to build the collider relatively quick
ly, as they hope to use it in conjunc
tion with the Large Hadron Collid
er, scheduled to open in 2007.
According to Dorian, the scientific
community has done extensive re
search into the five percent of the uni
verse that emits light; however, the
remaining "dark matter" is relatively
unstudied. Hopefully the Interna
tional Linear Collider will aid scien
tists in exploring this type of matter.
"We anticipate that some of the tan
talizing super-partxies will be within the
range of discovery, opening the door to
an understanding of one of the great
mysteries of the universe-dark matter,"
said Hirotaka Sugawara, the former di
rector of Japan's KEK laboratory.
