# ICFA passes on SLAC approach

The soon-to-be largest particle accel
erator will use German "cold" super
conductor technology instead of the
room temperature approach that the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) has favored in the past, the In
ternational Committee for Future Ac
celerators (ICFA) decided on Aug. 20.
A particle accelerator creates electrons
and their positive counterpart, positrons,
then boosts their energy level and acceler
ates them. Finally, the electrons and
positrons collide and are annihilated,
which results in a release of energy and
the creation of novel particles. The two
technologies — cold versus room tem
perature — differed in the approach to

accelerating the electrons and positrons.
"The two technologies were both
considered to be viable," said Jonathan
Dorfan, the director of SLAC. "[Choos
ing one over the other] was something
that needed to be done in order to pool
our human and monetary resources."
Physicists will work on a new design
that uses the superconductors of the
"cold" technology but may also incorpo
rate aspects of the room temperature
technology. The SLAC team, which con
sists of approximately 3,000 scientists, will
be deeply involved in the creation of the
technology which will eventually be used
in the International Linear Collider.
"Everybody acknowledges that the
strongest assembled team Is at SI AC," Dorfan
