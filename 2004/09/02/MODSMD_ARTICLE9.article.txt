## WEST OF CENTER It's happening as we speak Kai offers his thoughts on the Republican Party's convention in New York 
### 
Enjoy these next two months: You won't see
the "compassionate" side of the Republican
Party for another four years. We have heard
a lot from the pro-choice, gay-tolerant, pro
gun safety, anti-deficit wing of the Republican Party
on TV these last few days. Meanwhile, the party's offi
cial platform, adopted without dissent, endorsed a
constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, op
posed domestic partnership benefits, described homo
sexuality as "incompatible with military service",and
reiterates a longstanding commitment to end legal
abortion and appoint extremist judges who will over
turn Roe v. Wade.
But the real reason McCain, Giuliani and
Schwarzenegger are starring the convention is not be
cause they're moderates but because they're leaders.
Whatever vou think of their uoli-

»» nuiv. tvi jvu iiiuirv v/ i iiivii
cies, there's no denying that per
sonally they're made of the right
stuff. McCain is a sincere patriot,
willing to make personal sacrifices
and take on special interests and do
what he thinks is right for his coun
try. Giuliani is known for taking
command of the situation immedi
ately after the 9/11 attacks, head
ing right to the site and working
immediately and tirelessly to coor-

/ /
dinate the rescue operation and re
store the city's physical and psychological safety.
Schwarzenegger has reached across party lines time
and again, proved willing to make compromises, back
down from mistakes, buck the Republican Party faith
ful, and do what it takes to get the problem solved.
These three have been marshalled to testify about
Bush's character because in an election about leader
ship, Bush is lacking. Unlike McCain, Bush has not
made personal sacrifices for his country and has not
called on others to make these sacrifices. After 9/11
when McCain proposed an education credit in return
for national service and an expansion of AmeriCorps,
Bush pushed through more tax cuts for the ultra-rich
and urged Americans who wanted to do something for
their country to go shopping. As far as standing up to
special interests, Bush took more lobbyist money in
one year than Kerry did in his entire senate career,
and it shows in his pro-logger forest policies, his pro
oil ANWR drilling, his pro-pharmaceuticals medicare
plan and his pro-Halliburton Iraq contracts.
Unlike Giuliani, Bush didn't visit ground zero
until three days after the attacks. Informed that the
country was under attack, Bush continued to read "My
Pet Goat" to a classroom of second-graders in Saraso
ta, Florida. For the next 10 hours, his airplane chick
en-hopped from air force base to air force base as Dick
Cheney continued to run the country. The White
House press office has stated that Bush finished "My
Pet Goat" in order to project calm, but this implausible
explanation merely demands the question, is the pres
ident's job to tout his own character traits (calm, deter
mination, resolve), or is it to run the country? John
Kerry put it best: "Had I been reading to children and
had my top aide whispered in my ear, 'America is
under attack,' I would have told those kids very polite
ly and nicely that the president of the United States
had something that he needed to attend to." Inciden

tally, has Bush since focused on making New York
safer? New York receives $5 per person in Homeland
Security funding, while Wyoming receives $38.
And unlike Schwarzenegger, Bush has not been"a
uniter not a divider" or lived up to his promise to
"change the tone in Washington." His administration
is as partisan as any in history. Instead of making com
promises to get the job done, he's staked out shrill po
sitions and then attacked the patriotism of anyone who
opposed him. Instead of trying to get the Department
of Homeland Security set up as quickly as possible, for
example, he demanded that Democrats deny basic
union protections to the employees — perhaps unions
are a threat to our national security?
In an election about who will be the strong leader
America needs after Sept. 11, what is the basis of Bush's
claim? While Bush has "resolve" and "courage," John
Kerry is a flip-Hopper.
Let's start with the central claim in this story, about
the $87 billion Iraq appropriation. John Kerry first
voted to allocate $87 billion drawn from Bush's tax
cuts for the very rich. When that amendment was de
feated, Kerry voted against adding the $87 billion to
the deficit. This isn't a flip-flop: John Kerry wanted to
support our troops, but thought it was irresponsible to
borrow more money to do it, rather than asking the
ultra-rich to make a sacrifice just as our troops do.
Meanwhile, Bush opposed Joe Lieberman's pro
posal to create a Department of Homeland Security
before he supported it. Bush opposed John McCain's
campaign finance reform legislation before he sup
ported it. Bush opposed the 9 /II Commission's plan
to create a cabinet-level intelligence officer before he
supported it. Maybe this was an honest change of
heart, or maybe he just couldn't stand up to the polit
ical pressure of a good idea — but not every flip-flop
is a bad thing.
And the other prime-time speaker? Three years
ago, Zell Miller called John Kerry "one of this nation's
authentic heroes, one of this party's best-known and
greatest leaders —and a good friend ... In his 16
years in the Senate, John Kerry has fought against gov
ernment waste and worked hard to bring some ac
countability to Washington . . . [H]e fought for bal
anced budgets before it was considered politically cor
rect for Democrats to do so. John has worked to
strengthen our military, reform public education,
boost the economy and protect the environment."
I wish elections were about issues — about whose
tax plan will create jobs, about whose healthcare plan
will provide more people with cheaper insurance,
about whose foreign policy will make Americans safer,
about whether Alzheimer's or gay marriage is a bigger
threat to American families. Bill Clinton's speech the
first day of the Democratic convention provided a
stark contrast to the Republican speeches, outlining
the ways in which America was better off due to his
policies. But in today's sound-byte era, the election
will be about "leadership" rather than whose policies
are better. Given that, let's hope the electorate takes a
closer look at the records of the two candidates —
leadership is about courage, sacrifice and indepen
dence, not glossy photo-shoots, buzzwords and
celebrity testimonials.

policies. But in today's sound-byte era, the election
will be about "leadership" rather than whose policies
are better. Given that, let's hope the electorate takes a
closer look at the records of the two candidates —
leadership is about courage, sacrifice and indepen
dence, not glossy photo-shoots, buzzwords and
celebrity testimonials.

Enjoy these next two months: You won't see
the "compassionate" side of the Republican
Party for another four years. We have heard
a lot from the pro-choice, gay-tolerant, pro
gun safety, anti-deficit wing of the Republican Party
on TV these last few days. Meanwhile, the party's offi
cial platform, adopted without dissent, endorsed a
constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, op
posed domestic partnership benefits, described homo
sexuality as "incompatible with military service",and
reiterates a longstanding commitment to end legal
abortion and appoint extremist judges who will over
turn Roe v. Wade.
But the real reason McCain, Giuliani and
Schwarzenegger are starring the convention is not be
cause they're moderates but because they're leaders.
Whatever vou think of their uoli-

»» nuiv. tvi jvu iiiuirv v/ i iiivii
cies, there's no denying that per
sonally they're made of the right
stuff. McCain is a sincere patriot,
willing to make personal sacrifices
and take on special interests and do
what he thinks is right for his coun
try. Giuliani is known for taking
command of the situation immedi
ately after the 9/11 attacks, head
ing right to the site and working
immediately and tirelessly to coor-

/ /
dinate the rescue operation and re
store the city's physical and psychological safety.
Schwarzenegger has reached across party lines time
and again, proved willing to make compromises, back
down from mistakes, buck the Republican Party faith
ful, and do what it takes to get the problem solved.
These three have been marshalled to testify about
Bush's character because in an election about leader
ship, Bush is lacking. Unlike McCain, Bush has not
made personal sacrifices for his country and has not
called on others to make these sacrifices. After 9/11
when McCain proposed an education credit in return
for national service and an expansion of AmeriCorps,
Bush pushed through more tax cuts for the ultra-rich
and urged Americans who wanted to do something for
their country to go shopping. As far as standing up to
special interests, Bush took more lobbyist money in
one year than Kerry did in his entire senate career,
and it shows in his pro-logger forest policies, his pro
oil ANWR drilling, his pro-pharmaceuticals medicare
plan and his pro-Halliburton Iraq contracts.
Unlike Giuliani, Bush didn't visit ground zero
until three days after the attacks. Informed that the
country was under attack, Bush continued to read "My
Pet Goat" to a classroom of second-graders in Saraso
ta, Florida. For the next 10 hours, his airplane chick
en-hopped from air force base to air force base as Dick
Cheney continued to run the country. The White
House press office has stated that Bush finished "My
Pet Goat" in order to project calm, but this implausible
explanation merely demands the question, is the pres
ident's job to tout his own character traits (calm, deter
mination, resolve), or is it to run the country? John
Kerry put it best: "Had I been reading to children and
had my top aide whispered in my ear, 'America is
under attack,' I would have told those kids very polite
ly and nicely that the president of the United States
had something that he needed to attend to." Inciden

tally, has Bush since focused on making New York
safer? New York receives $5 per person in Homeland
Security funding, while Wyoming receives $38.
And unlike Schwarzenegger, Bush has not been"a
uniter not a divider" or lived up to his promise to
"change the tone in Washington." His administration
is as partisan as any in history. Instead of making com
promises to get the job done, he's staked out shrill po
sitions and then attacked the patriotism of anyone who
opposed him. Instead of trying to get the Department
of Homeland Security set up as quickly as possible, for
example, he demanded that Democrats deny basic
union protections to the employees — perhaps unions
are a threat to our national security?
In an election about who will be the strong leader
America needs after Sept. 11, what is the basis of Bush's
claim? While Bush has "resolve" and "courage," John
Kerry is a flip-Hopper.
Let's start with the central claim in this story, about
the $87 billion Iraq appropriation. John Kerry first
voted to allocate $87 billion drawn from Bush's tax
cuts for the very rich. When that amendment was de
feated, Kerry voted against adding the $87 billion to
the deficit. This isn't a flip-flop: John Kerry wanted to
support our troops, but thought it was irresponsible to
borrow more money to do it, rather than asking the
ultra-rich to make a sacrifice just as our troops do.
Meanwhile, Bush opposed Joe Lieberman's pro
posal to create a Department of Homeland Security
before he supported it. Bush opposed John McCain's
campaign finance reform legislation before he sup
ported it. Bush opposed the 9 /II Commission's plan
to create a cabinet-level intelligence officer before he
supported it. Maybe this was an honest change of
heart, or maybe he just couldn't stand up to the polit
ical pressure of a good idea — but not every flip-flop
is a bad thing.
And the other prime-time speaker? Three years
ago, Zell Miller called John Kerry "one of this nation's
authentic heroes, one of this party's best-known and
greatest leaders —and a good friend ... In his 16
years in the Senate, John Kerry has fought against gov
ernment waste and worked hard to bring some ac
countability to Washington . . . [H]e fought for bal
anced budgets before it was considered politically cor
rect for Democrats to do so. John has worked to
strengthen our military, reform public education,
boost the economy and protect the environment."
I wish elections were about issues — about whose
tax plan will create jobs, about whose healthcare plan
will provide more people with cheaper insurance,
about whose foreign policy will make Americans safer,
about whether Alzheimer's or gay marriage is a bigger
threat to American families. Bill Clinton's speech the
first day of the Democratic convention provided a
stark contrast to the Republican speeches, outlining
the ways in which America was better off due to his
policies. But in today's sound-byte era, the election
will be about "leadership" rather than whose policies
are better. Given that, let's hope the electorate takes a
