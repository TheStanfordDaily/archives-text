A Message from Phi Beta Kappa, Stanford Chapter
Phi Beta Kappa is a nationwide society honoring students for the excellence and breadth of their under
graduate scholarly accomplishments. Membership in the Stanford Chapter (Beta of California) is open
to undergraduates of all majors. To be elected to Phi Beta Kappa at Stanford, a student must achieve
academic distinction in the major as well as in courses across a broad range of fields.
Approximately a tenth of the members of a graduating class are elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Of this num
ber, about one fifth are chosen in their junior year, the remainder in their senior year.
The Chapter's election guidelines define breadth of study as excellence beyond the major field. To be
considered for election, 5 student must have taken, by the time elections are held early in the Spring
Quarter, at least three courses at Stanford in each of the following three major domains of knowledge:
Humanities; Science, Engineering and Math; and Social Sciences. To be considered for election, stu
dents who transfer in their junior year must have taken at least two courses at Stanford in two of these
major domains and at least one in the third domain, and must have completed a minimum 75 units of
academic work at Stanford by the end of Winter Quarter.
Examples of courses that will satisfy the Phi Beta Kappa breadth criterion include those listed in the
BULLETIN for the undergraduate General Education Requirements (GER) in Areas 2 to 4. Courses
taken for GER Area 1 will not be considered as satisfying the PBK breadth criterion.
A grade of or "CR" is not considered a sign of distinction. Minimally satisfying the "breadth" cri
terion is not considered a sign of distinction.
The academic records of all students are automatically reviewed, so no special action is required for stu
dents wishing to be considered for membership. Anonymity in the election process is ensured by
removal of students' names from their academic records before consideration. Students who desire that
their records not be made available for consideration by the Stanford chapter of Phi Beta Kappa should
inform the Registrar, room 133, Old Union.
