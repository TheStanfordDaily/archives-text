COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL ENGINEERING COURSES FOR FRESHMEN & SOPHOMORES
CME 100, 102, 104, 106 (formerly ENGR 154, 155A, 1558, 155 C)
A sequence of computational mathematics courses has been developed for students
interested in pursuing degrees in engineering. The sequence will cover important
areas of engineering mathematics and computation, such as multivariahle calculus,
linear algebra, ordinary and partial differential equations, numerical methods,
probability and statistics, and will emphasize engineering applications and compu
tation using MATLAB. The intent is a) to introduce freshmen and sophomores to
the relevant mathematics and computational tools early in their college career, b)
to excite their interest in the engineering disciplines and provide early exposure to
the engineering faculty and the use of computation in solving real engineering
problems.
The sequence consisting of El 54 (multivariahle calculus with linear algebra),
EISSA (ordinary differential equations), E1558 (partial differential equations with
linear algebra), and/or EISSC (probability and statistics) can be used to satisfy the
general engineering mathematics requirement.
The courses will be offered during the following quarters:
Fall 2004
CME 100
Winter 2005
CME 102
CME 106
CME 108
Spring 2003
CME 102
CME 104

The sequence covers important areas of engineering mathematics and
emphasizes engineering applications and computation using MATLAB. The
intent is a) to introduce freshmen and sophomores to the relevant mathematics
and computational tools early in their college career, b) to excite their interest
in the engineering disciplines and provide early exposure to the engineering
faculty and the use of computation in solving real engineering problems. The
new sequence consisting of CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, and/or CME 106
can be used as an alternative to Math 51, Math 52, and Math 53 and will satisfy
the general engineering mathematics requirement.
