Total savings
IKEA Economics
Cool furniture costs you less money, thereby leaving you with excess cash (Cheddar, cake, c.r.e.a.m., dead
presidents, etc.). More cash that you can spend on an ice cream float with friends. And some pizza. And
chicken wings. And a burrito as big as your head. After that you can go lie down on some of that cool furniture
that saved you all that money.

Promissory Note
Promise to save: I promise to save money by going to the nearest IKEA store to buy my furniture. All savings
under the terms of this Note, plus any other savings that may occur with IKEA merchandise not mentioned on
this Note may increase my ability to do things other than sit in my dorm and stare at the (windowless) wall. IKEA
furnishings may provide leftover money fora trip to the movies or the obligatory college tattoo. Failure to shop
at IKEA stores may reduce frequency of these or similar extracurricular activities. I understand that I may cancel
or reduce the size of the savings I receive at any time, by choosing not to go to IKEA stores.
My signature certifies that I have read, understood and agreed that IKEA stores are my best bet for saving
money on college crib furnishings.

Total savings
IKEA Economics
Cool furniture costs you less money, thereby leaving you with excess cash (Cheddar, cake, c.r.e.a.m., dead
presidents, etc.). More cash that you can spend on an ice cream float with friends. And some pizza. And
chicken wings. And a burrito as big as your head. After that you can go lie down on some of that cool furniture
that saved you all that money.

Promissory Note
Promise to save: I promise to save money by going to the nearest IKEA store to buy my furniture. All savings
under the terms of this Note, plus any other savings that may occur with IKEA merchandise not mentioned on
this Note may increase my ability to do things other than sit in my dorm and stare at the (windowless) wall. IKEA
furnishings may provide leftover money fora trip to the movies or the obligatory college tattoo. Failure to shop
at IKEA stores may reduce frequency of these or similar extracurricular activities. I understand that I may cancel
or reduce the size of the savings I receive at any time, by choosing not to go to IKEA stores.
My signature certifies that I have read, understood and agreed that IKEA stores are my best bet for saving
money on college crib furnishings.
