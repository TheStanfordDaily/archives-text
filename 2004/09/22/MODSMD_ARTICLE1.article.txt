# ORIENTATION WEEK EDITION
## Pre-orientation trips expand to include frosh 
### JENNY ALLEN 
For this year's new students, Thefacebook.com was
a popular way to meet one another prior to arriving on
campus â€” but it wasn't the only one. Fifty of this year's
freshmen and transfer students traveled to the Sierra
Nevada mountains for five days of backpacking and
bonding last week.
In its second year for transfer students and first for
freshmen, the Stanford Pre-Orientation Trip program
was organized by the New Student Orientation staff
and led by undergraduate and graduate students.
"The purpose of these trips is to meet other new stu
dents and to learn more about Stanford and about
yourself, and also to learn some basic wilderness skills
and, of course, to have fun," said NSO Director Jared
Scherer.
The program, similar to ones offered at other uni
versities like Princeton and Dartmouth, did just that for
freshman Sam Shrank.
"There is nothing like starting Stanford with eleven
new friends," Shrank said.
In the fall of 2003, the program was offered only to
transfer students. But this year, it was open to freshmen
