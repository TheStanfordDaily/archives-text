# ORIENTATION WEEK EDITION
## Pre-orientation trips expand to include frosh 
### JENNY ALLEN 
For this year's new students, Thefacebook.com was
a popular way to meet one another prior to arriving on
campus â€” but it wasn't the only one. Fifty of this year's
freshmen and transfer students traveled to the Sierra
Nevada mountains for five days of backpacking and
bonding last week.
In its second year for transfer students and first for
freshmen, the Stanford Pre-Orientation Trip program
was organized by the New Student Orientation staff
and led by undergraduate and graduate students.
"The purpose of these trips is to meet other new stu
dents and to learn more about Stanford and about
yourself, and also to learn some basic wilderness skills
and, of course, to have fun," said NSO Director Jared
Scherer.
The program, similar to ones offered at other uni
versities like Princeton and Dartmouth, did just that for
freshman Sam Shrank.
"There is nothing like starting Stanford with eleven
new friends," Shrank said.
In the fall of 2003, the program was offered only to
transfer students. But this year, it was open to freshmen

from the Northeast who might benefit
from a smoother east-to-west-coast
transition. In total, 27 freshmen (out of
50 who applied) and 23 transfers at
tended; in 2003,29 transfers participat
ed. This year, 13 trip leaders oversaw six
groups of seven to 10 new students.
The goal of the program is to accli
mate new students to Stanford, accord
ing to one of the program's coordina
tors, Sarah Rubinfeld, a graduate stu
dent in civil and environmental engi
neering.
"Those who participated in SPOT
last fall have consistently rated it as one
of their best experiences at Stanford.
The transfer advisors who work with
them have raved about the impact the
program made in their adjustment to
campus life," Rubinfeld said.
Hie undergraduate and graduate
trip leaders are responsible for teaching
students basic survival skills and for im
parting knowledge about campus life.
Rubinfeld said that the trip leaders as

the "single biggest impact on the partic
ipants' experience," since each is re
sponsible for establishing a positive en
vironment during the outing.
Unlike last year, every team leader
this year underwent an extensive train
ing program that covered leadership
skills, group dynamics, technical wilder
ness skills, wilderness first aid and risk
management. Rubinfeld said the ad
vance training was designed to attract
more trip leaders by offering valuable
experience to students who were inter
ested in leading outdoor trips but were
not sure where to start.
"The leadership training, followed
by a chance to put it into action, was a
great learning experience," said Mason
Curry, Class of 2004.
Geremy Heitz, who led a trip for the
second time this year, said that the pro
gram makes an "invaluable contribu
tion" to orientation programming. "It's
amazing to see a group of total strangers
come together and form such strong

bonds in less than a week. These friend
ships will ease their entrance into a new
community," Heitz, a graduate student
in electrical enginnering, said.
Program coordinators plan to ex
pand the program gradually in order to
maintain a high level of quality. "Stan
ford and the Office of Freshmen and
Transfer Students are committed to
continuing this program in the future,"
Scherer said.
Rubinfeld said that a part of the pro
gram's appeal was because it can ac
commodate a broad range of students.
"It's for students who are nervous
about Stanford, and excited about Stan
ford, and everything in between. It's for
students who love backpacking, and
students who have never been back
packing before but have always wanted
to try.
"It's for current students and other
members of the university who care
about helping new students adjust to
life at Stanford."
