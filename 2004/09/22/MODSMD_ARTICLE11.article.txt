# Flat-screens stolen from Stanford Design Group

### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Two flat-screen monitors were
stolen from the office of the Stan
ford Design Group last weekend.
The group's office is in the Storke
Building on campus, next to the of
fices of the Stanford University
Press and The Stanford Daily.
"The burglar must have smashed
a side window with a rock to get in
side, grabbed the monitors and
their boxes, and probably left from
another window," said Bill Free
man, a designer at the group.
Valued at a total of $2,330, the
flat screen monitors had been
moved from a nearby supply closet
recently, according to Freeman.
"We think that someone knew
about the fact that they had been
moved," Freeman said. "They ap
parently knew exactly what boxes
were used for each monitor and
knew that they changed location."
The group filed a police report
on Monday morning. At present,
the Stanford Department of Public
Safety declined to comment. Free
man said he assumes the theft took
place on Friday or Saturday night,
when people in other parts of the
building were absent.
After the theft, Freeman said
that the group is thinking about ad
ditional safety features to prevent
future theft.
"We are putting cables on the
windows so they can't be opened up
more than six inches and consider
ing motion detectors," said Free
man. "And now we'll be a lot more
careful with what is left in plain
view."
