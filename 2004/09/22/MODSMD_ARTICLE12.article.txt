1967 I Residences go co-ed
On Sept. 22, 1967, The Daily ran a story about the University's
adoption of co-ed residences:
"Men in Branner?
Women in Wilbur?
With University approval!
Residential alternatives expanded this year for freshmen (and the
entire campus) with large-scale adoption of coeducation, residence
seminars, and integration of Freshmen with the other classes.
All-male Wilbur and Stern are no more. And Branner, once for
freshmen women, is now coeducational.
Freshmen women, eight-two in number, moved into previously all
upperclass Florence Moore Housing. This alternative makes inte
grated womens' residences possible for the first time.
Branner was the most popular choice of both men and women in
the summer draw, and the academic-oriented Creativity, Communi
ty-Service, Grove and international Houseshnad two to three times
as many applications as places available, revealed Michael Roster of
the Dean of Students office, who assisted with residence assign
ments."
1999 I University nixes online facebook
On Sept. 22,1999, The Daily ran a story about a Web site that in
cluded scanned Stanford Facebook photos. University administra
tors requested that the photos be removed:
"'First and foremost is the issue of student privacy,' said [then-]
Deam of Students Marc Wais. "We believe students should be af
forded the opportunity to eercise their right to consent or not consent
before their pictures and accompnaying personal information are put
on the World Wide Web.'"
The students contend that all of the information was, in fact, stan
dard directory information, asi t was collected from existing Stanford
directoris, such as Whois.
Wais' primary concern, however, was the use of students' pho
tographs on the site without their prior knowledge or explicit con
sent. He noted that studnet pictures were not included on any of
Stnaford's online directores.
DJ Monkey [one of the three Web site creaters, each of whom
were identified only by their IM screennames in the article] stated
that the Web site designers used the 'same secure methods that Stan
ford's computer secutiy specialists emply' to restrict access to their
Web site to the Stanford community.
'Our Facebook is is meant to empower studnets,' said The Sultan
[another site designer]. "Our online version gives each studnet 100
percent of his or her picture."
