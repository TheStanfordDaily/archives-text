# A-to-Z guide to Stanford
## 
### 
A
ASSU. An acronym for the
Associated Students of
Stanford University, the un
dergraduate student gov
ernment, which was
plagued by controversy
over the past year after
multiple contested elec
tions of its executive offi
cers. Following illicit e
mails, ASSU by-laws viola
tions, an uncertified elec
tion and a series of judicial
battles over the certifica
tion of its second election,
new ASSU President
Chioke Borgelt-Mose and
Vice President Kory Vargas
Caro will take the helm and
try to restore the organiza
tion's credibility.
B
Band, the. Known less for
their music and more for
their crazy attire and scram
bling antics on the football
field, the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching
Band (LSJUMB) provides
unconventional forms of
entertainment across the
campus and sports arenas.
The Band's unprecedented
stunts have resulted in bans
from places like Notre
Dame University, the state
of Oregon, Disneyland and
CBS, just to name a few, in
addition to an extension of
their alcohol probation
until 2007. But that doesn't
stop students from drunk
enly racing across campus
on the annual band run,
dancing along to Stanford's
fight song "All Right Now."
c
Claw. A focal point at the
center of campus, the Claw
is a nickname for the foun
tain between the Bookstore
and Old Union. A favorite
for fountain hoppers on hot
days, the Claw draws its
name from its contorted
shape. Regardless of the
brutality its name might in
voke, the Claw is a popular
spot to lounge and an im
portant marker on campus.
D
Daily, The. Providing stu
dents with the most wide
spread coverage of campus
news and Cardinal sports,
The Stanford Daily is home
to a dedicated band of
sleep-deprived journalists.
You can look for The Daily
in locations all across cam
pus, particularly rolled up in
balls on the floors of Mem
Aud on Sunday nights fol
lowing the ritual paper
fights at Flicks.
E
Eating Clubs. As an alter
native to large dining halls,
some student housing gives

residents an opportunity to
join a themed eating estab
lishment known as an eat
ing club. Available to Toyon
and Suites residents, eating
clubs have a personal chef
for their members and a
reputation for some of the
best food on campus. A
highlight of the eating club
experience is Special Din
ner — a quarterly party
with exquisite cuisine, ex
pensive alcohol and crazy
costumes.
F
Frat parties. Saturated with
the aura of horny and over
worked students, these
campus-wide events are a
popular hangout for foster
ing fleeting and often re
gretful relationships. Under
the influence of beer and
rap blaring across a
dimmed dance floor, fresh
man girls become suscepti
ble to sketchy frat boys and

roofie coladas.
G
Graduate Student Council.
Also known as the GSC. It
is the graduate student ver
sion of the ASSU has a less
controversial, more low
key image than its under
graduate counterpart. It
serves the needs of the
graduate community on is
sues like housing and cost
of living.
H
Hoover Institution. A con
servative think tank located
by the phallic-looking mon
ument on campus, the
Hoover Institution is home
to eminent political figures
like Secretary of State
Colin Powell and National
Security Adviser Con
doleeza Rice. The Hoover's
political bias has a history
of controversy given its ties
to a university with a dis
proportionately liberal stu
dent body. In the US's deci
sion to go to war in Iraq,
many students directed
their opposition at Hoover
Fellows who comprised a
quarter of the Defense Pol

icy Board — a key advising
group to top members at
the Department of De
fense. In spite of protests
and harsh criticism of the
institution for being "hawk
ish," the Hoover Institution
continues to attract a
plethora of politicians, jour
nalists and noteworthy fig
ures for campus-wide pan
els and discussions.
I
I-Center. A nickname for
the Bechtel International
Center, located nearTresid
der Union. It provides pro
gramming and resources
for international and for
eign-born students and
scholars.
J
Jamba Juice. Arefreshingly
smooth drink that is a fa
vorite for those recovering
from hangovers, Jamba

Juice and its wide assort
ment of flavors are a tempt
ing diversion. In the past
year, the campus juice
leader created quite the stir
by adding a smaller size op
tion — bringing in students
formerly intimidated by
Jamba Juice's large sizes.
K
Kairos. Part of the co-op
community, which features
the rare sight of students
cooking and cleaning for
themselves. The co-ops
range from hippie havens
like Columbae and Synergy
to the more conventional
international co-op Ham
marskjold. Look for co
opers dancing naked
through Full Moon on the
Quad.
L
Lake Lagunita. The irony of
the name comes with the
perpetual lack of water in
the weed-covered field on
the east side of campus. If
the rainy season at the be
ginning of winter quarter is
particularly heavy, a few
inches of water accumula
tion will permit a primitive

rafting experience. Evening
rafting get-togethers,
nonetheless, tend to be bro
ken up by Stanford police
concerned with incidents of
drunken drowning.

M
Maples Pavilion. Though it
is currently closed for reno
vations, it is scheduled to re
open for this year's basket
ball season. The stadium
has been home to many un
believable come-from-be
hind victories and fan stam
pedes. The Sixth Man Club,
the students holding season
tickets to home games, cre
ated a riot after Nick
Robinson made a buzzer
beater 3-point shot and car
ried that enthusiasm for
one of most legendary sea
sons in Stanford's history.
N
No dating. The common
rumor that there is no dat
ing at Stanford stems from a
campus plagued with over
committed students who ei
ther budget their time to in
vest in a marriage-like rela
tionship or settle fora one
night stand. However, de
bunkers say that the rumor
is only true for those who
believe in it.
o
Okada. The Asian-themed
dorm, one of four ethnically
themed dorms on campus.
The others are Casa Zapata
(Latino), Ujamaa (black),
and Muwekma-Tah-Ruk
(Native American).
P
Palm trees. Though not in
digenous to northern Cali
fornia, the presence of palm
trees contributes to a gener
al envy from east coast
schools that must limit their
botanical ambitions to
conifers. The scenic en
trance to the Stanford cam
pus, Palm Drive, is famous
for its namesakes and many
students willingly accept
the $30,000 that Stanford
spends to maintain each in
dividual palm tree. Palms
have also served as handy
party decorations until the
arrest of Kappa Sig pledges
for de-palming in prepara
tion for their annual Luau.

Q
Queer. A word that incor
porates the many different
members of the LGBT
CRC — lesbian, gay, bisex-

ual, transgender Communi
ty Resource Center. With
dorm and campus programs
dedicated to sexual aware
ness, safe sex, and defining
one's sexual identity, the
LGBT community plays
host to candid discussions
about issues prevalent
among young adults.
R
RAs. Responsible for dorm
spirit and organizing social
activities, students continu
ally tout their RAs fora bal
ance of compassion and
coolness. The dedication of
RAs at Stanford is unparal
leled, some so involved
(and sketchy) with the stu
dents that they violate the
red light policy.
s
Shibu. Former owner of
Ernie's, a Stanford favorite
for quality beverages. As a
friendly store clerk who
made friends easily and
gave free paraphernalia
with purchases, Shibu could
often be found frequenting
campus-wide parties at
Stanford. Shibu went to
India at the end of last year,
leaving behind him a legend
that will live in the hearts of
Stanford students with
every Friday night Ernie's
beer run.
T
Tree. It is the mascot of the

Band. But it is not the offi
cial mascot of the Universi
ty. Until 1972, the Stanford
mascot was the Indians. But
it was abandoned because

many considered it racist.
Though a number of sug
gestions and student-wide
initiatives have since tried
to change the mascot from
color Cardinal, no official
measure has given Stanford
a new alias. Nonetheless,
the beloved Tree continues
to play a de facto mascot
role during sports events.
U
Uncle John's Band. One of
the largest of the off-cam
pus Dead Houses, which
are a cluster of houses in
Palo Alto names after
Grateful Dead songs. Un
dergraduate and graduate
students can sublet rooms
and enjoy an alternative so
cial community.
v
Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education. John
Bravman is responsible for
building partnerships
among the various schools
and departments on cam
pus. His office focuses on
academic programs, as well
as undergraduate teaching,
advising and research.
Bravman also sponsors lav
ish BBQs for his charges at
Freshman and Sophomore
College, which he oversees.
w
Women's Community Cen
ter. Founded in the 1970s
and currently located in the
Fire Truck House, it is
where the needs and inter
ests of Stanford's female
students are met. It is one of
six community centers on
campus.
x
Xanadu. One of the most
sought-after houses on the
Row, a treasured place of
dwelling for those who
enjoy open kitchens and
don't mind the hashing.
With the exception of the
Native American-themed
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, a
four-class dorm, and frater
nities, the Row is reserved
exclusively for upperclass
men with good draw num
bers.
Y
Yoga. A relaxation tech
nique teaching students all
the flexible positions, yoga
classes have become in
creasingly popular among
students who now sport
yoga mats in addition to
their school bags.
z
Zoo, The. The affectionate
nickname for Stanford's
student radio station,
KZSU (90.1 FM).
