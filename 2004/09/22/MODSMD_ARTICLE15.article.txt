## Editor's Welcome Feel free to experiment, frosh 
### 
Freshman year. I'm sitting in the hall in Bran
ner at 4 a.m. with six or eight other kids,
under a banner that says "Brann-ER: Emer
gency Room!"
This is back in the day. pre-Capital Improvement,
and the halls of this dorm are about as clean and well
lit as San Quentin after a riot. We see each other as lit
tle more than silhouettes in the half-fluorescence.
Maybe it wasn't as dark as I'm remembering.
Maybe it's just my memory that's dimmed by four
years of haze. 1 can't even recall who all the other
frosh were that night. I knew their names, hut I didn't
know them. Still don't. Branner's a big place.
Anyway, we're sitting there, backs slouched on the
walls, socked feet restless on the carpet. We're talk
ing about other frosh, ones who are out of earshot at
the moment.
We're talking about "reinvents."
There's the short kid with glasses who has joined the
ultimate frisbee team and now swaggers through the
hallways in his baggy mesh Stanford shorts, Birken
stocks and S.M.U.T. T-shirt. Wearing contacts, now.
Last spring, he was editor of the yearbook at a
school where no one who was anyone gave a damn
about the yearbook. Now he's a Stanford Athlete.
There's the Quiz Bowl-champ blonde who final
ly got her braces off in February, bought her first
pair of tight-fitting jeans in July and first put them
on so timidly on a day when no one she knew would
see her.
Tomorrow night, she'll be wearing thigh-high
boots and a tube top and stifling her gag reflex as she
drinks her first beer. She'll down it. let out an Oh-my-
God-I'm-on-TRL scream, and instantly feel superior
to all the other girls at the party who are too scared to
do the same.
We laugh, we joke, we gossip about them. How
transparent they are.
We're a perceptive bunch. But we've got our own
private doubts. II I weren't here at this moment,
would it be me that everyone is laughing at? Would I
be the obvious reinvent?
It sounds pretty bad. this reinvention business. It
suggests fakery, reeks of self-consciousness.
But it's not always so shameful.
James Gatz, common bootlegger, became Jay

Gatsby, romantic hero. Dean Moriarty.con artist, be
came the living soul of Beat. Self-invention is part of
the American dream.
We've all been advised never to try to be some
thing we're not. But what's the alternative? Stay the
same all our lives?
Maybe you went by Frank in high school. You
were a shy boy. and wanted to fit in. Now is the time
to proudly introduce yourself as Francisco — a confi
dent. unique Latino man.
Here's the only catch: You can't just be Francisco.
Francisco has to be you.
Follow?
Back to the ultimate-frisbee kid. He was trying to
be something. But the something wasn't him. It was a
stereotype, some composite of coolness that he had in
his head.
As soon as you try to be cool, you're an obvious
reinvent.
Maybe. Frank, you like anime and video games.
Francisco better not hate on anime and videogames.
He better not be an instant Tequila expert if you've
never had a drink. He better not be a ladies' man if
you're shy around girls.
But he doesn't have to be the same old Frank, al
ways following the rules, always scared to try new
things. He can experiment, grow, screw up, learn,
change. And in the process he'll become something
original. He'll become you.
Freshman year is the time when we're most free to
experiment with who we are and how we perceive
ourselves. Our parents aren't around to tell us what
to wear or when to come home. Our old friends aren't
around to put us in our place by reminding us of who
we used to be. We don't have bosses who can fire us
on the spot if we offend their sensibilities.
Welcome to college. You can become something
original. Start today.

Maybe it wasn't as dark as I'm remembering.
Maybe it's just my memory that's dimmed by four
years of haze. 1 can't even recall who all the other
frosh were that night. I knew their names, hut I didn't
know them. Still don't. Branner's a big place.
Anyway, we're sitting there, backs slouched on the
walls, socked feet restless on the carpet. We're talk
ing about other frosh, ones who are out of earshot at
the moment.
We're talking about "reinvents."
There's the short kid with glasses who has joined the
ultimate frisbee team and now swaggers through the
hallways in his baggy mesh Stanford shorts, Birken
stocks and S.M.U.T. T-shirt. Wearing contacts, now.
Last spring, he was editor of the yearbook at a
school where no one who was anyone gave a damn
about the yearbook. Now he's a Stanford Athlete.
There's the Quiz Bowl-champ blonde who final
ly got her braces off in February, bought her first
pair of tight-fitting jeans in July and first put them
on so timidly on a day when no one she knew would
see her.
Tomorrow night, she'll be wearing thigh-high
boots and a tube top and stifling her gag reflex as she
drinks her first beer. She'll down it. let out an Oh-my-
God-I'm-on-TRL scream, and instantly feel superior
to all the other girls at the party who are too scared to
do the same.
We laugh, we joke, we gossip about them. How
transparent they are.
We're a perceptive bunch. But we've got our own
private doubts. II I weren't here at this moment,
would it be me that everyone is laughing at? Would I
be the obvious reinvent?
It sounds pretty bad. this reinvention business. It
suggests fakery, reeks of self-consciousness.
But it's not always so shameful.
James Gatz, common bootlegger, became Jay

Gatsby, romantic hero. Dean Moriarty.con artist, be
came the living soul of Beat. Self-invention is part of
the American dream.
We've all been advised never to try to be some
thing we're not. But what's the alternative? Stay the
same all our lives?
Maybe you went by Frank in high school. You
were a shy boy. and wanted to fit in. Now is the time
to proudly introduce yourself as Francisco — a confi
dent. unique Latino man.
Here's the only catch: You can't just be Francisco.
Francisco has to be you.
Follow?
Back to the ultimate-frisbee kid. He was trying to
be something. But the something wasn't him. It was a
stereotype, some composite of coolness that he had in
his head.
As soon as you try to be cool, you're an obvious
reinvent.
Maybe. Frank, you like anime and video games.
Francisco better not hate on anime and videogames.
He better not be an instant Tequila expert if you've
never had a drink. He better not be a ladies' man if
you're shy around girls.
But he doesn't have to be the same old Frank, al
ways following the rules, always scared to try new
things. He can experiment, grow, screw up, learn,
change. And in the process he'll become something
original. He'll become you.
Freshman year is the time when we're most free to
experiment with who we are and how we perceive
ourselves. Our parents aren't around to tell us what
to wear or when to come home. Our old friends aren't
around to put us in our place by reminding us of who
we used to be. We don't have bosses who can fire us
on the spot if we offend their sensibilities.
Welcome to college. You can become something
original. Start today.
