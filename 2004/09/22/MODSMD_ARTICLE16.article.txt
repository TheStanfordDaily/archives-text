Resident assistants speak out against
Orientation alcohol rules
Twenty-one resident assistants on
the Row sent the following letter to Di
rector of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo last Friday. We chose to also
provide a copy of the letter to The Daily
in the hopes of stimulating a wider cam
pus discussion of Orientation Alcohol
Policy. While The Daily's policy allows
only one of us to sign this letter, it is im
portant to note that RAs from Lambda
Nu, La Maison Francais, Ham
marskjold. Pi Beta Phi, Grove Lasuen,
Roth, Terra, Phi Sigma, Delta Delta
Delta. Storey. Durand, Haus Mitteleu
ropa, Mai's. Bob, Xanadu. Theta Delta
Chi. Theta, Sigma Chi. Kappa Alpha
and ZAP signed the original letter
along with me:
We are writing to express our con
cern about the University's alcohol pol
icy during New Student Orientation.
From the day freshman students arrive
until the day classes start, alcohol is pro
hibited in all public areas on campus —
a prohibition which extends to the com
mon areas and hallways in our resi
dences. Further, all residents of the
Row are being compelled to sign a doc
ument acknowledging this policy when
they move into their rooms.
We believe that the University's
goal of protecting freshman students
from the temptations of alcohol dur
ing this week is laudable. However,
we are convinced that the present pol
icy improperly and unfairly shifts the
burden of accomplishing this goal
onto our residents, severely infringing
upon their ability to enjoy their return
to campus.
Experience suggests that many of
our residents — upon returning— will
want to celebrate somewhat before
they dive back into their academic lives.
This period holds the promise of catch
ing up with friends not seen in months
and the prospect of making new ones.
This year, returning residents will be
met by a University and house staff
seemingly hostile to their social desires.
We will tell them that, if they wish to
drink with their friends, they must clos

et themselves in private rooms or leave
Stanford altogether.
We will tell them that — should
they choose to lawfully drink — the
lounges and hallways of their own
houses are not open to them. Worst of
all. we will drive our residents to places
(rooms, bars, etc.) where the house
staff has a diminished ability to watch
over them and step in before things get
out of control.
We are convinced that there are bet
ter ways to keep alcohol out of fresh
man hands. Perhaps it would be more
appropriate to simply close upper-class
houses to freshmen during Orientation.
( Iliis is a step some of us already volun
tarily undertake.)
Alternatively, the University could
institute a curfew for freshman students
and permit alcohol only after freshmen
are "off the streets." At the very least,
the University could ask freshman stu
dents to acknowledge and affirm the
Orientation Alcohol Policy (which is
designed for their benefit) along with
our residents (to whom it is hostile).
As RAs. we are frustrated by the
prospect that our first responsibility will
be to enforce a poorly drawn policy
sure to alienate our residents. Further,
we don't relish our potential role as
temperance police for the freshman
class. Stanford freshmen are mature
enough to be held responsible for their
own actions; there is no need to shift the
burden of preventing their illegal be
havior onto row residents and staff.
We hope you will take steps to rem
edy this unfortunate situation.

Democrats lack diversity of opinion,
understanding of opposition
Kai Stinchcombe's Sept. 2 column
("Kai offers his thoughts on the Repub
lican Convention in New York") shows
that he does not understand the Re
publican Party. It's probably because its
philosophy differs so much from that of
the Democrats.
Unlike the Democrats, the Republi
cs party does not have litmus tests on
abortion rights and gay marriage. The

party welcomes people of differing opin
ions on these issues.
Lixik no further than the presidential
ticket. Vice President Dick C'heney sup
|x>rts gay marriage, while President
George W. Bush supports a constitution
al amendment banning it. And yet last
month, Dick Cheney heartily endorsed
the president, in spite of this difference.
The modern Democratic Party
seems to have so many litmus tests that
there is little diversity of opinion among
its members, particularly those in leader
ship positions. I think this severely ham
pers the Democrats, because it leads to
groupthink and other flaws in mostly
monolithic, homogenous organizations.
I'm sure Democrats will htxit and
howl about diversity in terms of race,
gender, age, nation of origin and other
demographics. But those aspects of di
versity do not, in and of themselves,
generate the differences of opinion that
stimulate discussion and evolve the or
ganization.
People who support gay marriage
regardless of demographics will agree
that it's right to support gay marriage
without necessarily understanding
why. A group of white middle-aged
men who don't agree about gay mar
riage will discuss the issue and might ac
tually learn something from those
whose views are not the same as theirs.
They will evolve, they will learn, and
they will understand.
1 think the biggest problem facing
this country right now is an unwillingness
to understand opposing views to and
agree to disagree. Instead, those who
disagree are labeled, put down, called
liars, traitors, scumbags and worse.
Until those who disagree are willing
to sit down and understand why some
one else believes differently, and respect
not only their opinion but their right to
have that opinion, this polarization will
continue to drag this country down.
Maybe it would help to recognize,
understand and internalize that
Democrats and Republicans are oppo
nents. not enemies. Our common
enemy lives in hiding in many parts of
the world.

As RAs. we are frustrated by the
prospect that our first responsibility will
be to enforce a poorly drawn policy
sure to alienate our residents. Further,
we don't relish our potential role as
temperance police for the freshman
class. Stanford freshmen are mature
enough to be held responsible for their
own actions; there is no need to shift the
burden of preventing their illegal be
havior onto row residents and staff.
We hope you will take steps to rem

Democrats lack diversity of opinion,
understanding of opposition
Kai Stinchcombe's Sept. 2 column
("Kai offers his thoughts on the Repub
lican Convention in New York") shows
that he does not understand the Re
publican Party. It's probably because its
philosophy differs so much from that of
the Democrats.
Unlike the Democrats, the Republi
cs party does not have litmus tests on
abortion rights and gay marriage. The

party welcomes people of differing opin
ions on these issues.
Lixik no further than the presidential
ticket. Vice President Dick C'heney sup
|x>rts gay marriage, while President
George W. Bush supports a constitution
al amendment banning it. And yet last
month, Dick Cheney heartily endorsed
the president, in spite of this difference.
The modern Democratic Party
seems to have so many litmus tests that
there is little diversity of opinion among
its members, particularly those in leader
ship positions. I think this severely ham
pers the Democrats, because it leads to
groupthink and other flaws in mostly
monolithic, homogenous organizations.
I'm sure Democrats will htxit and
howl about diversity in terms of race,
gender, age, nation of origin and other
demographics. But those aspects of di
versity do not, in and of themselves,
generate the differences of opinion that
stimulate discussion and evolve the or
ganization.
People who support gay marriage
regardless of demographics will agree
that it's right to support gay marriage
without necessarily understanding
why. A group of white middle-aged
men who don't agree about gay mar
riage will discuss the issue and might ac
tually learn something from those
whose views are not the same as theirs.
They will evolve, they will learn, and
they will understand.
1 think the biggest problem facing
this country right now is an unwillingness
to understand opposing views to and
agree to disagree. Instead, those who
disagree are labeled, put down, called
liars, traitors, scumbags and worse.
Until those who disagree are willing
to sit down and understand why some
one else believes differently, and respect
not only their opinion but their right to
have that opinion, this polarization will
continue to drag this country down.
Maybe it would help to recognize,
understand and internalize that
Democrats and Republicans are oppo
nents. not enemies. Our common
enemy lives in hiding in many parts of
the world.

Resident assistants speak out against
Orientation alcohol rules
Twenty-one resident assistants on
the Row sent the following letter to Di
rector of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo last Friday. We chose to also
provide a copy of the letter to The Daily
in the hopes of stimulating a wider cam
pus discussion of Orientation Alcohol
Policy. While The Daily's policy allows
only one of us to sign this letter, it is im
portant to note that RAs from Lambda
Nu, La Maison Francais, Ham
marskjold. Pi Beta Phi, Grove Lasuen,
Roth, Terra, Phi Sigma, Delta Delta
Delta. Storey. Durand, Haus Mitteleu
ropa, Mai's. Bob, Xanadu. Theta Delta
Chi. Theta, Sigma Chi. Kappa Alpha
and ZAP signed the original letter
along with me:
We are writing to express our con
cern about the University's alcohol pol
icy during New Student Orientation.
From the day freshman students arrive
until the day classes start, alcohol is pro
hibited in all public areas on campus —
a prohibition which extends to the com
mon areas and hallways in our resi
dences. Further, all residents of the
Row are being compelled to sign a doc
ument acknowledging this policy when
they move into their rooms.
We believe that the University's
goal of protecting freshman students
from the temptations of alcohol dur
ing this week is laudable. However,
we are convinced that the present pol
icy improperly and unfairly shifts the
burden of accomplishing this goal
onto our residents, severely infringing
upon their ability to enjoy their return
to campus.
Experience suggests that many of
our residents — upon returning— will
want to celebrate somewhat before
they dive back into their academic lives.
This period holds the promise of catch
ing up with friends not seen in months
and the prospect of making new ones.
This year, returning residents will be
met by a University and house staff
seemingly hostile to their social desires.
We will tell them that, if they wish to
drink with their friends, they must clos

et themselves in private rooms or leave
Stanford altogether.
We will tell them that — should
they choose to lawfully drink — the
lounges and hallways of their own
houses are not open to them. Worst of
all. we will drive our residents to places
(rooms, bars, etc.) where the house
staff has a diminished ability to watch
over them and step in before things get
out of control.
We are convinced that there are bet
ter ways to keep alcohol out of fresh
man hands. Perhaps it would be more
appropriate to simply close upper-class
houses to freshmen during Orientation.
( Iliis is a step some of us already volun
tarily undertake.)
Alternatively, the University could
institute a curfew for freshman students
and permit alcohol only after freshmen
are "off the streets." At the very least,
the University could ask freshman stu
dents to acknowledge and affirm the
Orientation Alcohol Policy (which is
designed for their benefit) along with
