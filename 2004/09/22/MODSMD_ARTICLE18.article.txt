## Examining The Daily 
### 
Maybe you thought the se
ries of Campustruth.org
ads that The Stanford
Daily ran last year were
racist and had no place in the paper.
Or maybe once you were asked
by a Daily reporter to give your
thoughts on the University's Alco
hol Policy, only to find yourself
misquoted or misrepresented the
next morning. Or maybe you think
in general the paper just bleeds red
and is no better than a liberal rag.
Maybe you like The Daily and
are impressed by your school's stu
dent-run paper.
Whether you are a friend or foe,
the simple truth is that behind every
issue of The Daily, there is a small
group of editors and writers making
judgments about what is important
enough for you to read and how
they're going to tell you about it.
Sometimes this job is done bet
ter than others. Even for news or
ganizations that hold themselves to
the highest standards, the last few
years have exposed a series of what
these organizations themselves
deem to be misjudgments — rang
ing from The New York Times'
evaluation of its coverage of the
Iraq war to this week's admission
by C BS that it erred in using dis
puted memos on President Bush's
National Guard service.
In the wake of these lapses,
news outfits have increasingly
sought to implement some checks
and balances to be publicly ac
countable for the quality of their
reporting and the soundness of
their judgments.
That's what this column will be
for this upcoming volume. Taking a
lesson from The Washington Post.
The Times and many other presti
gious newspapers. The Daily has
hired a readership editor to serve
as an independent critic of the
paper and its coverage — one
whose opinions appear on The
Daily's very own pages.
So what does this mean?

To steal a line from Dan Rather
while his back is against the wall, it
means that I, the readership editor,
can comment on the job The Daily
is doing "without fear or fa
voritism" — fear of getting my
opinions censored or myself fired,
or favoritism toward colleagues
that would impugn my ability to
judge their work on its merits.
This column, which will appear
at least on a biweekly basis, can be
edited only for clarity and grammar
— not for content.
The readership editor is entirely
removed from any editorial role at
The Daily, serving instead as an in
dependent observer whose pur
pose is to serve as a quality watch
dog as well as to represent and dis
cuss the opinions and reactions of
the paper's readers.
What I write is separate from any
editorial stance of The Daily, which
means you can agree with The Daily
and disagree with me, or hvpotheti
callv disagree with both of us.
Whatever permutation suits
your needs, you can and should
share your thoughts with me at
readership@daily.stanford.edu.
In the spirit of full disclosure, I
spent my first two years at Stanford
as a writer for The Daily and ulti
mately as a managing editor, but
since calling it quits after sopho
more year, I have been entirely re
moved from the paper's editing
process, though 1 did serve as a
columnist this spring.
What this means is 1 know how
The Daily works and what its con
straints are and may have some
opinions about how it could be im
proved, but I am not involved with
the people who currently produce
the paper each morning.
The result is supposed to be that
1 can therefore be a fair and impar
tial critic. If I fail to do this, I'll ex
pect you to let me know.

Athletic Marketing Department
needs improvement
While I wholeheartedly support our
football team, 1 would like to express
my disappointment in our school's Ath
letic Marketing Department.
They provided very little informa
tion during the summer about purchas
ing season tickets. Then they finally put
up a terribly buggy mechanism to buy
tickets eight days before kickoff that
still doesn't work.
Even worse, they don't respond to
requests for technical support, or even
put a notice on GoStanford that they
might be experiencing problems. When
calling the ticket office, they can't give a
straight answer.
The Athletic Marketing Depart
ment has stated their goal is to make
Stanford athletics in general and foot
ball in particular a priority when it
comes to the student decision on where
to spend their time. So why are they
making it difficult to get tickets?

Former Zimbardo advisor speaks out
on Stanford prison experiment
It is with consternation and bernuse
ment that I read the fusillade of non-

sense filling (he press alleging some
connection between the Iraq prison
scandal and the infamous Stanford
prison experiment conducted on the
Stanford campus in 1971.
According to its principle investi
gator, Prof. Philip Zimbardo, this
"landmark" experiment is a classical
treatise on the "power of the situa
tion" and a full-blown, full-tilt expla
nation of the evils of every prison from
Folsom to Abu Ghraib. I can assure
you. it is neither.
I say this not because I am an
African-American ex-con who
served 17 years in San Quentin for at
tempted murder or one who spoke
before Congress on the issue of
prison reform. I say it because I was
there. I was the experiment's chief
consultant and the only one involved
who actually knew a whit about pun
ishment and rehabilitation from first
hand experience.
I armed the doctorates who con
ducted this so-called science with the
ideas which enabled them to infuse
this study with verisimilitude. Ideas
such as bags being placed over the
heads of prisoners, prisoners being
bound together with chains and buck
ets being used in place of toilets in
their cells were products of my experi
ences in the old "Spanish jail" at
Quentin. To allege that the all upper

middle-class Caucasian "guards" in
the experiment dreamed this up on
their own is absurd, offensive and
strains credulity and scientific validity
beyond the breaking point.
How can Zimbardo express horror
at the behavior of his guards when they
were merely doing what he and others,
myself included, encouraged them, or
in fact told them, to do?
At the time, I had hoped that I
would help create a valid, intellectually
honest indictment of the prison system.
In hindsight. I became an unwitting ac
complice to a theatrical exercise es
pousing situational mumbo-jumbo
conveniently absolves all comers of
personal responsibility for their lousy
moral choices.
That may play at Yale or Stanford,
but even at the University of San
Quentin, that's one tough sell.
