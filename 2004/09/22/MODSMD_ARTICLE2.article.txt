# Strong endowment growth may herald improved financial health
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Merged Endow
ment Pool, the primary investment
pool for the University's endow
ment, generated a return of 18 per
cent for the 12-month period ending
June 20,2004, according to the Stan
ford Management Company. The
high return may signal an improve
ment in the University's financial
situation, which suffered during the
low points of the nation-wide reces
sion that began in 2001.
Michael Ross, the chief invest
ment officer for the Stanford Man
agement Company, which oversees
the MEP. attributed the pickup in

investment returns largely to the
performance of equity markets over
the past year, particularly interna
tional equities that were boosted by
the strengthening of currencies like
the Euro and the Yen against the
U.S. dollar.
"We believe that international
equities underperformed versus
U.S. equities fora long period of
time and there's a certain amount of
catch up involved," Ross said.
Although the MEP forms the
lion's share of the University's en
dowment, there remain separately
invested department and school
funds as well as small pockets of cap
ital that are not a part of the MEP,
according to Ross.

While the University's financial
managers are pleased with last
year's returns, they stress that it is
important to put them in the context
of a long-term investment strategy.
"In our business of investment,
one year is not meaningful since we
are trying to preserve the capital of
the endowment for generations to
come," Ross said. "At a minimum,
we look at three-year performance,
and five and ten year data are more
meaningful. We don't invest on the
basis of a one-year forecast."
According Ross, the MEP grew
from 2.6 billion to $10 billion over
the last decade. The annualized re-

turn for the ten-year period ending
June 2004 was 15.1 percent. An an
nualized return refers to the return
gained, on average, each year over a
multi-year period rather than a cu
mulative return.
Yet, Ross is careful not to be
overly optimistic.
"The 10 years we just passed
through was an extraordinary prof
itable period for the endowment
and we would not expect that de
gree of success to persist over the
next decade."
The growth of the merged en
dowment pool will not necessarily
have a direct effect on the Universi
ty's budget, according to Vice Presi
dent for Public Affairs Gordon
Earle.
"It's important to remember that
an endowment is not a checking ac
count," Earle said. "It is more like a
trust fund for future students."
In fact, the endowment growth
will not have any effect on the bud
get until the 2005-2006 academic
year, when last year's growth will be
factored into the payout rate, the
percentage of the endowment that
is allotted to be used in the Univer
sity budget fora given year.
The target for that rate is usual
ly around five percent, though ad-

Other schools
also fare well

justments are made for market
fluctuations.
Meanwhile, other universities
have received similar boosts in their
investments over the past year. The
New York Times reported that pre
liminary numbers for half of the 25
universities with the largest endow
ments earned returns of at least 17.1
percent in the latest year.
Harvard's endowment, already
the largest of any university, pushed
above $22 billion last year, thanks to
a 21 percent return. Unlike Stanford
and most other universities, Har
vard does not rely on outside invest
ment mangers — its investments
are made by in-house personnel.
Recently, Harvard has been criti
cized by its own alumni for paying
out compensations of up to $35 mil
lion dollars to some of its managers.
Ross would not say how much
Stanford pays the 15 senior profes
sionals who manage the endowment
at the Stanford Management Com
pany, but said that "the compensa
tion is substantially less" compared
to that of Harvard Management
Company employees. However,
Ross said that the University also
pays fees to more than 150 outside
managers who control the individ
ual funds in which Stanford invests.

come," Ross said. "At a minimum,
we look at three-year performance,
and five and ten year data are more
meaningful. We don't invest on the
basis of a one-year forecast."
According Ross, the MEP grew
from 2.6 billion to $10 billion over
the last decade. The annualized re-

turn for the ten-year period ending
June 2004 was 15.1 percent. An an
nualized return refers to the return
gained, on average, each year over a
multi-year period rather than a cu
mulative return.
Yet, Ross is careful not to be
overly optimistic.
"The 10 years we just passed
through was an extraordinary prof
itable period for the endowment
and we would not expect that de
gree of success to persist over the
next decade."
The growth of the merged en
dowment pool will not necessarily
have a direct effect on the Universi
ty's budget, according to Vice Presi
dent for Public Affairs Gordon
Earle.
"It's important to remember that
an endowment is not a checking ac
count," Earle said. "It is more like a
trust fund for future students."
In fact, the endowment growth
will not have any effect on the bud
get until the 2005-2006 academic
year, when last year's growth will be
factored into the payout rate, the
percentage of the endowment that
is allotted to be used in the Univer
sity budget fora given year.
The target for that rate is usual
ly around five percent, though ad-

justments are made for market
fluctuations.
Meanwhile, other universities
have received similar boosts in their
investments over the past year. The
New York Times reported that pre
liminary numbers for half of the 25
universities with the largest endow
ments earned returns of at least 17.1
percent in the latest year.
Harvard's endowment, already
the largest of any university, pushed
above $22 billion last year, thanks to
a 21 percent return. Unlike Stanford
and most other universities, Har
vard does not rely on outside invest
ment mangers — its investments
are made by in-house personnel.
Recently, Harvard has been criti
cized by its own alumni for paying
out compensations of up to $35 mil
lion dollars to some of its managers.
Ross would not say how much
Stanford pays the 15 senior profes
sionals who manage the endowment
at the Stanford Management Com
pany, but said that "the compensa
tion is substantially less" compared
to that of Harvard Management
Company employees. However,
Ross said that the University also
pays fees to more than 150 outside
managers who control the individ
ual funds in which Stanford invests.
