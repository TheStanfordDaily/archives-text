# Holt's Harangue
## You don't really need Orientation 
### 
Welcome, overlords.
Once again, the admin
istration has rejected
my suggestions to im
prove Orientation. Namely, to not
have it.
You, the Class of 2008, are all
really bright people. I've seen the stats
on you folks, and I'm having strange
visions of superior-minded super
people, with cranias the size of water
melons and telekinetic abilities. Or
maybe you will all be like the kids
from the Village of the Damned, who
just by blinking can turn a spleen into
mashed potatoes.

Maybe I've
been watching
too much Sci-Fi
Channel.
Even if that's
true. I'm not tak
ing any chances (I
like my spleen).
So I welcome you
to Stanford, over
lords. You'll prob-

ably be hearing that a lot this week,
minus perhaps the "overlords" part.
And you're also probably already re
gretting coming to Orientation, or pos
sibly coming to Stanford at all. You're
thinking you should have just gone to
someplace simpler and less wacky, like
Duke.
And I couldn't agree with you
more. Orientation needs improve
ment. With you people being so ever
bright, why bother with Orientation?
If Stanford had no signs, pamphlets,
info-sessions or life-saving evacua
tion drills, you'd all be fine. Your
sixth sense or mutant powers would
kick in, and you'd somehow just
know where that history seminar is,
even without asking. The rest of the
school would join hands and help you
in this endeavor. We wouldn't coddle
you by pointing you in the right direc
tion, showing you where Tresidder is.

or pointing out: "No, silly freshman,
that's west campus, don't go to a
party there."
I submitted this idea to the adminis
tration, and as always, they had the "No
way, Chris" form letter ready.
Philistines.
So the administration rejected my
humble proposal. They seem to think
you need the information, whereas I
trust you guys and gals.
You seem cool by me, new over
lords. That's why, and don't tell the
Man I wrote this, but I'm giving you a
guide to Orientation Week. You folks
can figure out the rest on your own. But
the following essentials should be kept
with you at all times, tucked under your
watermelon-sized pillow at night.
College officially begins when
your parents go back home to
Delaware.
First day, you meet your room
mate. Realize immediately that the
roommate pairings could not have
been random, because how could you
be put with someone your complete
opposite?
Yes, this "nemesis" complex is
common at Stanford. Clark Kent had
Lex Luther fora freshman roommate
— you'll have your very own super
villain as well.
You'll pretty much be assured of
their villainy when you get a glimpse of
their Tom Jones posters. You can
throw out your roommates' Barry
Manilow albums the first day, but wait
'til later to set their Tom Jones posters
on fire. Being a good roommate means
compromise, after all.
When you go to the dining hall,
ask your hall mates to come along. Be
amazed how much you have in com
mon. You are all pre-med.
These will be your first friends.
They will be like your first pair of un
derpants: You will outgrow them and
snap their elastic spines, discarding
them as you surge onward with

newer, better friends progressing to
wards that super-human ideal. And
you thought Ayn Rand's philosophy
couldn't be directly applied to every
day college life. Ha.
But seriously, you'll encounter a
lot of different people here at Stan
ford. In a hall of 20, you'll see at least
a few drunk during your year, at least
two will be on sports teams, a few will
join student groups and none will
read The Daily.
By the third week, you'll be amazed
how little it rains. Call your friends back
home telling them this. Be amazed how
grumpy they sound. They have "weath
er" at their college.
Say they've changed. End the con
versation early. Go fountain hopping.
Go to the first football game. Learn
the "accepted / rejected" cheer.
Go to MuFuUnSun. Get a "Beat
Cal" T-shirt. Think of it less as a gar
ment and more as a means to delay
doing laundry for another three days.
Go to your first dorm party. Watch
fellow frosh first encounter with alco
hol / opposite sex / alcohol-and-oppo
site-sex.
Learn what sexile means, and why
it is used predominantly by fuzzies.
Find out later that those blurry forms
in the corner — the ones laughing at
everybody — are your RAs.
Welcome to Stanford, overlords.
Despite what I said earlier, don't take
this column too much to heart. The
entire intention was to amuse.
The lesson here really is that I can
poke fun at the school because...
yeah, I like it. 1 went through Orienta
tion once, too. I once was an overlord,
or at least thought I was. And 1 know
it only gets better from here.
