## With new faces come new friendships 
### 
When I think back to
freshman year, the
usual events stand out
in my mind — my first
college party. Full Moon on the Quad,
Big Game, Band Run, Screw Your
Roommate, and so on — but more

than the activities
that 1 did, I re
member the peo
ple that I shared
them with.
People come
to Stanford from
various parts of
the world with
dissimilar back
grounds, eclectic

interests and different aspirations.
As a diverse school, Stanford is a mi
crocosm of the country and a meet
ing place for bright young people at
a turning point in their lives.
Many people form some of their

best friendships during their freshman
year. 1 can testify to the unusual bonds
that are forged at Stanford. One of my
best friends is Muslim and I am Jew
ish. In spite of ethnic and religious dif
ferences, we have some of the same
ambitions and similar world views.
Last Thanksgiving, my friend made a
toast at my brother's Bar Mitzvah,
and this summer he will probably
come to my sister's Bat Mitzvah.
The friendships that are formed at
Stanford transcend political and cul
tural differences in addition to ethnic
ones. As a Democrat hailing from an
extremely liberal high school in Los
Angeles, I was surprised to find that
one of my good friends from Orange
County was very conservative. I have
another friend from an East Coast
prep school who to this day I have
never seen in jeans. In spite of seem
ingly large differences, I've found that
we have more in common than not.

Now that I am a junior, I have
friends around the country and places
to crash throughout California, New
York and Minnesota — places wherel
plan on stopping by whenever I hap
pen to be in the neighborhood.
As freshmen, you too have the op
portunity to forge friendships that
will last a lifetime. Make room for
some time in your busy Orientation
schedules to bond with your class
mates. Stanford is renowned for its
faculty, its research and its academics,
but the best thing that Stanford offers
are your peers.
Long after you have forgotten what
ever it was you learned in I-Hum or the
reason for choosing the major that you
did, maybe you'll be able to laugh about
it with some of your freshman friends.
