# The 						Brooklyn Brat
## She's got the freshman Orientation blues 
### 
As I was packing my bags a
few weeks ago for what will
sadly be my last year here at
Stanford, I kept trying to re
member what it was like leaving home
for the first time as a freshman.

Surely I was
frustrated that I
could not fit the
entire contents of
my bedroom into
two airline-sanc
tioned suitcases,
and of course I
had a latent fear
that my accep
tance letter had

been a mistake and that when I arrived.
Admission Dean Robin Mamlet
would personally escort me off campus.
1 had nightmares for weeks about
my roommates being jersey-chasers,
nature freaks, Abercrombie and Fitch
cutouts or anything else to which I
couldn't relate. And I was dreading the
moment when I would have to say
goodbye to my mom and accept the
fact that I did not know anyone in the
entire state of California — all while
avoiding tears, lest I ruin my reputa
tion for the rest of the year.
For me. Orientation was simply

the sum of every stressful first day of
school, times one week, plus 3,000
miles from home and repackaged in
a cardinal box with a tree on top.
Every conversation began with an
swers to tired questions about where
people were from, what they thought
they would major in and what kind of
computer they just bought from Fry's.
Trips to the dining hall were
marked with stress as I scanned the
room trying to figure out which empty
seat would hold the most promise for
my social career in college.
And all of a sudden, my room
mates — who were essentially
strangers to me — were supposed to
be my best friends.
Yes, the guys over in the NSO office
and their handpicked Orientation Vol
unteers try their best to make Orienta
tion the grand event that seals the deal
in our love affair with Stanford. New
comers are wooed at every opportuni
ty, while frat boys, rowdy athletes and
their kegs are swept under the wel
come mat until the last station wagon
bearing a "Stanford Parent" bumper
sticker drives off.
And while the whole week may
seem a little artificial, I must say 1 got a
little teary-eyed when I walked down

Escondido Road Monday morning and
watched as frosh were frozen in shock
when their RAs began shouting their
names as they walked toward the dorms.
As a freshwoman, after talking to
my friends at other schools that started
in August, I realized that Orientation
and the first week of class — like train
ing wheels or braces — are simply nec
essary evils that we must endure before
getting to bask in the glory of being col
lege students.
So to the Class of 2008,1 say don't
get too bummed by this week of panels
on how to make the most of Stanford,
dry parties that end at midnight and
not knowing where to sit in the dining
hall. It will be followed by the all of
things we have come to expect from
following the Dawson's Creek and
Saved by the Bell crowds to college
and from watching movies like Old
School, Orange County and that little
film with John Belushi... I promise.
