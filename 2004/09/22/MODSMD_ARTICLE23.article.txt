m people are very simi-
M lar. so we should all
S get along great," my
father said to my new roommate's father.
I was mortified. I laughed uncom
fortably. My roommate's family smiled
politely, probably wondering if Stan
ford allowed freshmen to switch rooms.
"What's your major?" my room
mate's father asked me.

"I'm not sure
yet ... probably
economics."
"Huh. Eco
nomics," he snort
ed disapprovingly.
"Oh no, don't
get my dad started
on economics." my
roommate said,
rolling her eyes.

"It's just completely impractical.
They use all these graphs and numbers
to try to teach you how the business
world works and how to run a compa
ny, but in the real world it just doesn't
work that way."
More uncomfortable laughter.
Luckily, my roommate and her
family had to go run errands at that
point, leaving my family and me to fin
ish setting up my side of the room.
When you're at Stanford, there are

so many choices that can be made: the
major and classes you choose, the clubs
and activities you join, the number of
people you kiss at Full Moon on the
Quad, mango madness or raspberry
rush fro yo in the dining hall.
There's only one choice that you can't
make, a condition that is forced upon
you: your freshman-year roommate.
In fact, I think that whoever is
matching up the roommates must get
really bored with their job and purpose
ly matching up complete opposites to
gether. For starters, I'm Chinese, from
California and raised a Christian. She.
on the other hand, was from Pennsylva
nia and raised very, very Jewish.
Even in the little things we didn't
seem to fit at all. In my roommate pref
erences, under "music I can't stand" I
put down "heavy metal." My room
mate listened to what she called "emo
core." Screeching metal guitars and
guys screaming lyrics which were inco
herent because it sounded more like
they were throwing up into the micro
phone definitely sounded like heavy
metal to me.
But after a couple months, I found
that I really liked some of her music —
the softer stuff. Pretty soon, she had me
going with her to conceits such as
Something Corporate and The Juliana
Theory. After that, we would put

"Konstantine" on repeat in our room
and sing it over and over again.
She dragged me out with her to
Shabbat Unplugged, a monthly event
where Jewish students gather and sing
Hebrew songs. I had the honor of being
the only non-Jewish person there.
In turn, I taught her how to speak
Chinese. Well, three phrases to be
exact — "I love you," "Take off your
pants" and"I want your babies." That
is "Wo ai ni," "Tuo diao ni de ku zi"
and "Wo yao ni de xiao hai" for those
of you who care to know.
So that's the story of my freshman
year roommate. Despite our traumati
cally awkward first meeting, which
seems like it would end in a disastrous
year that would go down in the annals
of roommate horror stories, 1 would
have to say it went pretty well. We
were forced to share a room together
freshman year, but in the end we
learned from each other's differences
and quirks. Res Ed would be proud.
Now here comes the I-Hum essay
ending: Love 'em or hate 'em, they're
your roommate, and if you get nothing
out of it at the end, at least you'll have
some good stories to tell your grandkids.
