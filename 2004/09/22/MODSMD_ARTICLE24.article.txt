## Has our campus bubble grown or burst? 
### 
On the fourth anniversary of
a protest brutally sup
pressed by the British gov
ernment, John Hancock
declared that Americans "dread noth
ing but slavery. It is immortality to sac
rifice ourselves for the salvation of our
country. We fear not death."
While Hancock himself did not die for
liberty, he did not shy from the risk. A

wealthy and well
connected busi
nessman, he signed
the Declaration of
Independence
knowing the British
government would
sentence him to
hang for treason.
Though Han
cock survived.

around 25,000 of his compatriots, or 1.7
percent of the colonies' population, died
in the war for independence. Liberty was
worth a lot in those days.
Today we are threatened by the
menace of global terrorism. On Sept. 11,
in the first attack on American soil in
half a century, tragedy came literally out
of the blue to kill around 0.0001 percent
of the American population. Our nation
was stirred to action.
I have never heard the case made that
our civil liberties caused 9/11. nor have 1
heard how giving John Ashcroft access
to my library records will make us safer.
Yet soon after the attacks, we were told
that unless we sacrificed some of our civil
liberties we would never be safe.
Dick Cheney also tells us that voting
Kerry will increase the risk of a terror
ist attack, and the Republican Party has

distributed bumper stickers calling
Kerry Osama bin Laden's candidate.
For those who weren't already
scared enough, a color-coded fear-o
meter was invented to tell us how
scared we should be. Although it's a
mathematical impossibility, the scale
has urged that we keep our fear perma
nently above average.
Our nation's heroes gave much
blood to win our liberties. It is cheap of
us to so quickly pawn them to make
ourselves feel safer.
Is the prohibition against unwar
ranted search and seizure, or the right
to conduct political protests without
police infiltration, worth the loss of
three thousand lives in 9 /11 ? In 1776,
Americans believed so.
Bush claims it was courage to sacrifice
our soldiers' lives, our allies' favor and our
own liberties to fight terrorists. It would
have taken more courage to declare that
terrorism could never stop us from being
America or cause us to shy away from the
values — liberty, peace and shared sacri
fice — that define our nation.
People talk about the Stanford bub
ble, an isolated mental and physical
zone where students allow themselves
to lose track of the outside world. Com
fortable, entertained and pursuing
their own success, Stanford students
aren't inclined to make sacrifices to
make the world a better place.
Sometimes it looks like D.C. has de
veloped a "Stanford bubble." The
ultra-rich have blithely taken the na
tional credit card on a tax-cut spending
spree, running up debts our generation
will have to repay.
The president did not dare ask fora

sacrifice to fund the war on terror,
properly equip our troops, or fully fund
veterans' programs — let alone put the
funds toward fighting poverty, global
AIDS, mediocre public education or
the American healthcare crisis.
But the bubble here on campus
seems to have burst. At this writing,
over 175 students have signed up with
the Stanford Democrats to register
their neighbors to vote. Not since the
Vietnam War have so many students
been involved in the club.
As a nation of ideals, we are called to
make sacrifices not only to keep our
country secure, but also to keep it true
to its founding principles. Today, that
means registering young people to vote.
The Cal Berkeley Democrats,
working in coalition with other student
groups, expect to register 9,000 voters
before the election. If there's any moral
purpose that can light a fire under Stan
ford students this year, it's beating Cal
in voter registration and turnout.
As in the past, this year our nation
will be inspired and led by young peo
ple, who best understand that Ameri
ca's promise lies in passing on an ever
renewed American dream of liberty,
peace, and prosperity.
When he made his speech on the
fourth anniversary of the Boston Mas
sacre, John Hancock, 37 years old, was
15 months past the official age limit for
membership in the Young Democrats.
But in tough times like these, we would
have let him help out anyway.

On the fourth anniversary of
a protest brutally sup
pressed by the British gov
ernment, John Hancock
declared that Americans "dread noth
ing but slavery. It is immortality to sac
rifice ourselves for the salvation of our
country. We fear not death."
While Hancock himself did not die for
liberty, he did not shy from the risk. A

wealthy and well
connected busi
nessman, he signed
the Declaration of
Independence
knowing the British
government would
sentence him to
hang for treason.
Though Han
cock survived.

around 25,000 of his compatriots, or 1.7
percent of the colonies' population, died
in the war for independence. Liberty was
worth a lot in those days.
Today we are threatened by the
menace of global terrorism. On Sept. 11,
in the first attack on American soil in
half a century, tragedy came literally out
of the blue to kill around 0.0001 percent
of the American population. Our nation
was stirred to action.
I have never heard the case made that
our civil liberties caused 9/11. nor have 1
heard how giving John Ashcroft access
to my library records will make us safer.
Yet soon after the attacks, we were told
that unless we sacrificed some of our civil
liberties we would never be safe.
Dick Cheney also tells us that voting
Kerry will increase the risk of a terror
ist attack, and the Republican Party has

distributed bumper stickers calling
Kerry Osama bin Laden's candidate.
For those who weren't already
scared enough, a color-coded fear-o
meter was invented to tell us how
scared we should be. Although it's a
mathematical impossibility, the scale
has urged that we keep our fear perma
nently above average.
Our nation's heroes gave much
blood to win our liberties. It is cheap of
us to so quickly pawn them to make
ourselves feel safer.
Is the prohibition against unwar
ranted search and seizure, or the right
to conduct political protests without
police infiltration, worth the loss of
three thousand lives in 9 /11 ? In 1776,
Americans believed so.
Bush claims it was courage to sacrifice
our soldiers' lives, our allies' favor and our
own liberties to fight terrorists. It would
have taken more courage to declare that
terrorism could never stop us from being
America or cause us to shy away from the
values — liberty, peace and shared sacri
fice — that define our nation.
People talk about the Stanford bub
ble, an isolated mental and physical
zone where students allow themselves
to lose track of the outside world. Com
fortable, entertained and pursuing
their own success, Stanford students
aren't inclined to make sacrifices to
make the world a better place.
Sometimes it looks like D.C. has de
veloped a "Stanford bubble." The
ultra-rich have blithely taken the na
tional credit card on a tax-cut spending
spree, running up debts our generation
will have to repay.
The president did not dare ask fora

sacrifice to fund the war on terror,
properly equip our troops, or fully fund
veterans' programs — let alone put the
funds toward fighting poverty, global
AIDS, mediocre public education or
the American healthcare crisis.
But the bubble here on campus
seems to have burst. At this writing,
over 175 students have signed up with
the Stanford Democrats to register
their neighbors to vote. Not since the
Vietnam War have so many students
been involved in the club.
As a nation of ideals, we are called to
make sacrifices not only to keep our
country secure, but also to keep it true
to its founding principles. Today, that
means registering young people to vote.
The Cal Berkeley Democrats,
working in coalition with other student
groups, expect to register 9,000 voters
before the election. If there's any moral
purpose that can light a fire under Stan
ford students this year, it's beating Cal
in voter registration and turnout.
As in the past, this year our nation
will be inspired and led by young peo
ple, who best understand that Ameri
ca's promise lies in passing on an ever
renewed American dream of liberty,
peace, and prosperity.
When he made his speech on the
fourth anniversary of the Boston Mas
sacre, John Hancock, 37 years old, was
15 months past the official age limit for
membership in the Young Democrats.
But in tough times like these, we would
have let him help out anyway.
