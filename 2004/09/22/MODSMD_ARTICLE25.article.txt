# Learning to let go...
## Parents need an orientation, too 
### CYNTHIA H. CHO MANAGING EDITOR 
When Shahnam Jain dropped off her eldest
daughter at Brainier Hall on Monday evening,
she held hack tears as she watched Niji, an At
lanta, Ga. native, join her peers in line for their
first dinner as Stanford students.
Mrs. Jain and her husband spent the weekend
buying college necessities, such as a bike, and
when it was time to leave, were most concerned
that Niji would be thousands of miles from home.
"There are a lot of students from the area like
Palo Alto and Sunnyvale," Mrs. Jasin said. "We
are so very far away, and if there is anything she
needs, she won't be able to come home as easily."
For many parents of new students, leaving
their children at Stanford stirs mixed emotions.
"They are very proud and sad," said Carolyn
Peterson, a member of the Stanford Parents'
Club. "Parents need to adjust to kids not living
with them."
Many universities, including Stanford, offer
programming for parents so that parting ways
with their kids will be easier and less worrisome.
On Monday, the Stanford Parents' Club hosted a
question-and-answer session, entitled "Letting
Go," at which parents of new students were able
to ask questions to parents and guardians of cur
rent students.
One parent asked, "It would be nice to know
how well my daughter does in school — were you
able to get that info?" Responses varied from
"Tell them that you write the check" to "Tell
them that the car insurance company needs it."
Some car insurance companies in California
offer discounted rates for students who maintain
a grade-point-average of a B or higher.
The panel is "an acknowledgement that fora
lot of parents, what is most difficult about Mon
day is that they are leaving their child behind,"
said Julie Lythcott-Haims, dean of freshmen and
transfer students.
New Student Orientation staff organized
events throughout Monday, the first day of Ori
entation Week, for parents. At the Parent Re
source Center, representatives from many of the
University's major departments — such as the of
fice of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation, Financial Aid office and Residential Edu
cation — were on hand to talk to parents.
Lythcott-Haims called the Parent Resource
Center a "one-stop shop" for parents who had ques
tions about the "nuts and bolts" of the University.
"They had a full-hour window to come and get
a synopsis of every department on campus," said
junior Kyle Woodward, a NSO staff member who
helped plan all of the events for parents. "The
goal was to get them to feel like they can drop
their child off on this large university and have
them taken care of."
The dinner with University Provost John
Etchemendy was another well-attended event;
more than 1,000 parents had reserved to attend.
"The tone [of the event | is of reassurance — that
Stanford is a great place and that your kids will be
safe," Woodward said.
Universities nationwide are devoting more
time to orientation events catered to parents,

partly because more parents are taking an active
role in the lives of their children. The trend has
led to the emergence of the term "helicopter par
ents" to describe those who hover over their chil
dren and, in more extreme cases, intervene in
their lives.
"Today, we had a parent who wanted to meet
with a pre-med advisor on behalf of her child,"
said Lythcott-Haims last Friday. "We applaud
the parent's enthusiasm in getting her son off on
the right foot. We do want to help the parent un
derstand that this is |an issue] that her son needs
to explore." T he parent did, however, get an ap
pointment to see a pre-med advisor.
"It's a very delicate balance — and most par
ents find the right balance," Lythcott-Haims
added. "We're here to reassure the people who
feel the need to be more involved."
Jared Scherer, director of New Student Orien
tation, said that at a time when everyone is con
cerned about security, parents are especially wor
ried about their children. "I think that parents are
probably more concerned since 9/11. We are liv
ing in uncertain times."
I le also added that as college tuition costs rise,
the "value expectation" also rises. "It's an invest
ment that the parents are making," and therefore
they feel a need to know what is going on, ac
cording to Scherer.
While some universities offer several days of
programming lor parents, Stanford only sets
aside one day of Orientation Week for parents —
mainly so that students will be able to adjust to
college life during that week.
"Students need to get on with the work they

need to do — meet with advisors, get to know
each other, get to know resident staff — and the
longer parents stay, the more that gets pushed
back," Scherer said. He added that Parents'
Weekend in February is a time wholly devoted to
parents.
While many parents appreciate and attend the
events sponsored by the University, many simply
take the time on campus to help their children
settle into their dorms.
Celia Sanchez was busy Monday unpacking,
cleaning and running errands (when her daugher
Nuritzi needed more hangers). Even though the
Sanchez family lives a few minutes away in Sun
nyvale, Mrs. Sanchez said that she is sad to have
her daughter away from home.
"I hope that she'll come by the house — at
least to do laundry," she said. When informed
that students no longer need quarters to do laun
dry, making the task easier, she jokingly said that
the University should reinstate coin machines.
Some parents said that giving children their
freedom is the best option.
One mother of a junior who spoke on the
"Letting Go" panel said that she made a pledge
not to call her daughter at night and focused on
keeping in touch via e-mail. Another mother of a
sophomore said that it was important to be in
touch regularly but advised against surprise visits.
Mrs. Jain, the mother of the Branner frosh,
said that she hopes that her daughter will call
home regularly. She added, "I used to hate in
stant messenger because I thought it was a waste
of time for my daughter. But now, it's another
way of communication."
