# After two years, Univ. lifts staff hiring freeze
## $18.5 million surplus expected for upcoming year, from $17 million deficit 
### ANTHONY HA STAFF WRITER 
The University is lifting its two
year hiring freeze for new staff, an
nounced Vice President for Busi
ness Affairs Randy Livingston and
Provost John Etchemendy last week
in a memo to senior administrators.
The freeze — which did not
apply to faculty recruitment —
began during the fall of 2(X)2, when
departmental budgets were being
slashed by up to 12 percent, as a way
to prevent layoffs. Its conclusion sig
nals a more positive outlook for the
University's finances.
"The hiring freeze imposed a sig
nificant administrative burden on
managers trying to hire new employ
ees," Livingston said. "Now that the
budget outl(K»k is stronger, we want to
reduce the administrative overhead."
While the freeze was in effect, all
job openings were placed on hold,
and schools and administrative
units were required to clear job
postings with their respective dean,
vice provost or vice president. Ac
cording to Livingston, this policy
"forced organizations to be very
considerate in deciding to fill open
positions."
Only two areas — the School of
Medicine and Residential and Din
ing Enterprises'— were unaffected
by the freeze and have collectively
added 363 positions, resulting in a
LJniversity-wide net growth in staff
employment of nearly 3 percent.
Livingston noted that the freeze was
effective in Stanford's central ad
ministration, where staff positions
fell by approximately 5.5 percent, or
120 positions.

"We believe the hiring freeze did
slow (he pace of hiring across cam
pus, especially within the central ad
ministrative units, and this made it
easier for units to deal with the bud
get cuts that came soon thereafter,"
Livingston said.
Since the freeze's inception, the
University has gone from a $17 mil
lion operating deficit for fiscal year
2(K)2 to a projected surplus of $18.5
million for the upcoming year.
Livingston and Etchemendy said
in the memo that the impact of the
University's economic difficulties
on existing staff had been minimized
through the hiring freeze, as well as
through a freeze on salaries. But
they also cautioned administrators
to remain prudent in their hiring
practices and to think carefully be
fore filling old positions that have
been left unoccupied since the
freeze began.
Livingston told The Daily that
the freeze had not significantly af
fected student life or staffing in indi
vidual departments. In fact, he ar
gued. even with the freeze gone the
pace of hiring will not increase, but
the process will be simplified.
"The hiring freeze did not stop
Stanford from hiring —we hired
hundreds of staff during the past two
years to fill open positions and re
place people who left," he said.
"With the end of the freeze, we still
expect units to be cautious in hiring,
but we've eliminated much of the
administrative overhead."
In the School of Humanities and
Sciences, the hiring freeze had mini
mal effect.
"We allowed many exceptions to
keep the core business of the school
running. Partly we had to do that be
cuase we're so minimally staffed
throughout the school anyway," said
Karen Nagy, executive dean.
She explained that because the
school is comprised of many small
units that even with one vacancy,
"you couldn't support faculty and
students."
