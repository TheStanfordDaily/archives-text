# Buy, sell books online with other college students
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
In response to the popularity of
last year's Book Buy Back program,
the ASSU is offering a program that
allows Stanford students to buy and
sell textbooks online, a move that
the ASSU hopes will give students
more flexibility when buying books.
"The Book Buy Back program re
quired too many resources from the
ASSU and only offered a limited
amount of textbooks like physics,
economics and psychology text
books," said ASSU Vice President
Kory Vargas Caro, a junior.
"We believe that ComeGe
tUsed.com will make the process of
buying books less expensive for stu
dents, which is something we can all
support," he added.
Launched in 2(X)2 at the Univer
sity of California-Berkeley,
ComeGetUsed.com now has more
than 7,(XH) members on the Cal cam
pus as well as members at San Jose
State University. De Anza College
and other schools. Stanford joined
the first week of Sept. and had 27
Stanford members as of Sept. 20.
"In case a Stanford student didn't
have the book, a Berkeley one
might, which we thought would ben
efit students here," Vargas Caro
said.
Like many other online programs

that allow users to sell and buy
goods, such as Cragslist or eßay, the
success of will depend on the num
ber of people who sign up to use the
service. On the Web site, all stu
dents, after creating a user name and
password, can post their asking price
ior a book.
"I'd use it if it was easy to use and
the service was good and it was avail
able early, before the start of the
quarter, so that I can get the books
on time," said senior Alex Gurevich.
Though the Stanford Bookstore
may prove more convenient for
some students — especially those
looking fora new edition of a text
book or those shop several classes -
Vargas Caro said he expects the pro
gram to do well.
"The Bookstore is an easy one
stop shopping center for books, but
more students are willing to take the
time to spend less on books," he said.
The high cost of textbooks, at a
time when students also face increas
ing tuition and other financial con
straints, has spurred many to seek al
ternatives to buying books at their
campus bookstore.
Some students, for example, buy
books through international retail
ers such as Anla7.on.com. Overseas
vendors often offer substantially
lower prices for textbooks, due to
prices at which wholesalers sell
them.

There are a number of potential
inconveniences to this method,
though, such as delays in shipment,
shipping and handling costs and dif
ficulties returning items.
For senior Greg Eastman, going
to the Bookstore has always been
the easiest option.
"I often shop classes, and since I
don't know what classes I'm going to
being taking before the quarter
starts, I don't like having to wait for
the books to arrive, so I buy my
books from the Bookstore or
through other students," he said.
The ASSU hopes that the ease
with which students can negotiate
with other students through
ComeGetUsed.com, along with the
promise of lower prices, will draw
people to the Web site.
"I do try to buy used books or
books off the Internet," said junior
Teresa Davis. "This sounds like it'd
be easier than off the Internet, so I'd
use it."
Buying and selling books online
directly with other students was al
ready an option through SUMarket,
but Vargas Caro said that some stu
dents find SUMarket "difficult to
navigate."
"But I think that student-to-stu
dent selling and buying has occurred
in dorms, groups lists and classes,
and now person-to-person selling is
facilitated by an easy to use Web

site," he said.
Eastman agreed that SUMarket
was not easy enough to use to make
it worth it, though he was unsure if
he would bother trying ComeGe
tUsed.com.
In order to ensure the success of
the program, each school registered
with the Web site is required to have
a campus representative to publicize
its services and handle any campus
specific issues or complaints.
Since the ASSU initiated the
University's participation in the
program, the ASSU Executive and
Senate offices will fill that role at
Stanford.
A spokesman for Follett Higher
Education Group, which manages
the Stanford Bookstore along with
bookstores on more than 700 cam
puses nationwide, said it is too early
to tell whether the use of such Web
sites will affect sales at student book
stores this year.
"Some of these Web sites are a
newer version of a very old but very
good idea of a student book swap,"
said Cliff Ewert, the spokesman.
Overall, sales have been up for
Follet so far this fall, Ewert said.
He said that prices at the Book
store are determined through a con
tract negotiated with the University
and that the University sets para
meters on pricing, such as student
discounts.

password, can post their asking price
ior a book.
"I'd use it if it was easy to use and
the service was good and it was avail
able early, before the start of the
quarter, so that I can get the books
on time," said senior Alex Gurevich.
Though the Stanford Bookstore
may prove more convenient for
some students — especially those
looking fora new edition of a text
book or those shop several classes -
Vargas Caro said he expects the pro
gram to do well.
"The Bookstore is an easy one
stop shopping center for books, but
more students are willing to take the
time to spend less on books," he said.
The high cost of textbooks, at a
time when students also face increas
ing tuition and other financial con
straints, has spurred many to seek al
ternatives to buying books at their
campus bookstore.
Some students, for example, buy
books through international retail
ers such as Anla7.on.com. Overseas
vendors often offer substantially
lower prices for textbooks, due to
prices at which wholesalers sell
them.

There are a number of potential
inconveniences to this method,
though, such as delays in shipment,
shipping and handling costs and dif
ficulties returning items.
For senior Greg Eastman, going
to the Bookstore has always been
the easiest option.
"I often shop classes, and since I
don't know what classes I'm going to
being taking before the quarter
starts, I don't like having to wait for
the books to arrive, so I buy my
books from the Bookstore or
through other students," he said.
The ASSU hopes that the ease
with which students can negotiate
with other students through
ComeGetUsed.com, along with the
promise of lower prices, will draw
people to the Web site.
"I do try to buy used books or
books off the Internet," said junior
Teresa Davis. "This sounds like it'd
be easier than off the Internet, so I'd
use it."
Buying and selling books online
directly with other students was al
ready an option through SUMarket,
but Vargas Caro said that some stu
dents find SUMarket "difficult to
navigate."
"But I think that student-to-stu
dent selling and buying has occurred
in dorms, groups lists and classes,
and now person-to-person selling is
facilitated by an easy to use Web

site," he said.
Eastman agreed that SUMarket
was not easy enough to use to make
it worth it, though he was unsure if
he would bother trying ComeGe
tUsed.com.
In order to ensure the success of
the program, each school registered
with the Web site is required to have
a campus representative to publicize
its services and handle any campus
specific issues or complaints.
Since the ASSU initiated the
University's participation in the
program, the ASSU Executive and
Senate offices will fill that role at
Stanford.
A spokesman for Follett Higher
Education Group, which manages
the Stanford Bookstore along with
bookstores on more than 700 cam
puses nationwide, said it is too early
to tell whether the use of such Web
sites will affect sales at student book
stores this year.
"Some of these Web sites are a
newer version of a very old but very
good idea of a student book swap,"
said Cliff Ewert, the spokesman.
Overall, sales have been up for
Follet so far this fall, Ewert said.
He said that prices at the Book
store are determined through a con
tract negotiated with the University
and that the University sets para
meters on pricing, such as student
discounts.
In response to the popularity of
last year's Book Buy Back program,
the ASSU is offering a program that
allows Stanford students to buy and
sell textbooks online, a move that
the ASSU hopes will give students
more flexibility when buying books.
"The Book Buy Back program re
quired too many resources from the
ASSU and only offered a limited
amount of textbooks like physics,
economics and psychology text
books," said ASSU Vice President
Kory Vargas Caro, a junior.
"We believe that ComeGe
tUsed.com will make the process of
buying books less expensive for stu
dents, which is something we can all
support," he added.
Launched in 2(X)2 at the Univer
sity of California-Berkeley,
ComeGetUsed.com now has more
than 7,(XH) members on the Cal cam
pus as well as members at San Jose
State University. De Anza College
and other schools. Stanford joined
the first week of Sept. and had 27
Stanford members as of Sept. 20.
"In case a Stanford student didn't
have the book, a Berkeley one
might, which we thought would ben
efit students here," Vargas Caro
said.
Like many other online programs

that allow users to sell and buy
goods, such as Cragslist or eßay, the
success of will depend on the num
ber of people who sign up to use the
service. On the Web site, all stu
dents, after creating a user name and
password, can post their asking price
ior a book.
