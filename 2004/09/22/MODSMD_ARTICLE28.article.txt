A memorial service was held in Memorial
C hurch on Tuesday in honor of Kathleen K. Nam
phy. a lecturer emerita in English and the human
ities. Namphy, f>M, died in a climbing accident in
Iran.
Dean for Religious Life Rev. Scotty McLen
nan gave a welcome to the near-full church. He
described Namphy as a "Christian peacemaker
[and] lifelong adventurer," and the "warmest,
most unassuming friend a colleague could ever
have."

Robert Hamerton-Kelly, Pastor of the Wood
side Village Church in Woodside, California, gave
a eulogy in praise of his former congragant's brav
ery and social conscience.
"Courageous love, that's Kathleen's gift to
those who knew her," he said. "She always made
me feel like a slacker."
After a teenage stint as a "rodeo queen," he
said, Namphy began her formal education at lib
eral arts schools in the Middle East. She went on
to teach at the American University, the Univer
sity of Baghdad and Stanford University.
Hamerton-Kelly praised Namphy's firm com
mitment to various social causes.

"She seemed always to be troubling the power
ful on behalf of the oppressed," he said. "She was
always meticulously well-informed."
He noted that many of these beliefs made her a
controversial figure at Stanford and elsewhere.
Namphy's four children read psalms and
poems for their mother. Her son Paul added his
own words for her.
"Let us remember our mother's example and
strive to continue her work," he said.
Namphy is survived by three sons, Andre,
Paul, and Mychel, one daughter, Lisa-Marie, two
sisters, Pat Spada, and Kay Frawley, and two
grandchildren.
