# Jetsetting with Stanford...
## Univ. alumni and affiliates trot the globe 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Coasting at 100 miles per hour over Australia in a DC-3 plane — a type of
small aircraft often used during World War II — Prof. Ronald Lyon once
lectured to an excited group of students about the geography of the conti
nent. But these were not the usual students Lyon, professor emeritus of geo
logical and environmental sciences, was used to teaching. They were a group
of Stanford alumni and their spouses traveling on one of the Alumni Associ
ation's Travel / Study Programs.
Each year, the program offers about 60 to 65 trips, which vary in both
physical rigor, to places such as Tahiti, Patagonia and Lebanon. Participants
can enroll in the "expeditions," which are physically challenging and requite
much hiking, or the "colleges," which allow passenpers to travel by luxury on
cruise ships, riverboats or trains. Stanford also offers a unique opportunity
for alumni and undergraduates to travel and learn together through the Field
Seminars program, where both can engage in hands-on fieldwork.
Although some trips are composed entirely of Stanford affiliates, larger
tours may pair up with organizations such as the Smithsonian Institution or
the American Museum of Natural History, or even with other universities,
such as Harvard. And while the trips are offered through the Alumni Asso
ciation, travelers do not, in fact, have to be Stanford alumni. Many travelers
are spouses or children of alumni, and those without any Stanford affiliation
can make a $75 contribution to the association to become members.
Stanford's Alumni Association is not alone in hosting these types of trips.
Many other universities offer trips to their alumni to foster a sense of con
nectedness to their alma maters.
"Stanford, however, had one of the first Alumni Associations to offer
such trips," explained Program Coordinator Craig Baumgartner, Class of
2002. "We're also probably the biggest Travel / Study department, and we
play a large part in planning the travel packages. Other universities, such as
the University of Washington, for example, leave much more up to the tour
operator."
However, the association does not plan every detail. The trips are first or
ganized by independent travel companies, such as International Expedi
tions, and then finely tuned by the association. The coordinators finalize the
itinerary and invite a faculty member to lead the trip. Some trips are even de
signed with a specific faculty member in mind and are organized entirely
around his or her field of research. Recently, a program was developed for
Anthropology Prof. Jim Fox.
Regardless of how they are selected, the faculty members become key
players in the program. They generally spend four to six months preparing
for the trip and becoming familiar with the countries they will visit by read
ing historical literature, studying the geography and getting acquainted with
the cultural customs. By the time they are ready to embark on the trip, they
will have prepared an entire educational experience for the passengers.
Run somewhat like Stanford courses, the trips include a reading list, lec

tries am 1 group discussions — but there are no pop quizzes or research pa
pers. The travelers are eager to simply absorb the information first-hand and
actively participate in dialogues with like-minded peers.

"People that take part in these trips are interested in trav
el for the right reasons," said John Rick, an associate profes
sor of anthropological sciences who has led several trips.
"They are going on these trips to learn, to take things at face
value, to become engaged in the history and culture."
One alumna, Barbara Varenhorst, Class of 1964, de
cided to travel with Stanford because she wanted to find
people who were traveling to learn, not just to "say they

had been
some
where." She
found that
Stanford
alumni are
"true re
naissance
people"
who have
achieved
much since
their time at
Stanford.
Past
travelers
have includ
ed Nobel
Prize win
ners, chief
executive
officers of
major cor
porations
and Holly
wood pro
ducers. In

combination with the illustrious passenger list, the dis
tinction of the Stanford affiliation attached to the group
has often given participants unparalleled opportunities.
In the past, groups have met with world leaders, top gov
ernment officials, famous musicians and recognized aca
demics.
"We had the chance to meet the president of Peru, a
Stanford alumnus, during one of the trips I took to South
America," said Rick. "When I lead Stanford tours, I find

myself meeting people that I would not otherwise have the chance to meet."
While the trips are remarkable experiences for the program participants,
the professors also benefit from their travels. They are able to visit areas of
the world where later hope to conduct research or are able to take part in
experiences that would be beyond the means of most faculty.
"One spectacular trip included traveling on a private jet for three
weeks to places such as Australia. Southeast Asia," said Rick. "We were
I able to move very fast and cover quite a bit of ground very efficiently,
| something that is only possible with tremendous resources. The trip was
fantastic, if a bit ostentatious."
The price tag for such trip? It costs about the same amount as a year

of Stanford tu
ition for three
weeks' worth
of travel.
Other trips
are much
more accessi
ble, including
the Budget
Seminars,
which cover
many loca
tions at bar
gain prices.
Despite the
costs, both fac
ulty and alum
ni agree that
these educa
tional trips are
priceless and
make for un
forgettable
memories.
"I remem
ber we took a
hike along a
beach in
Patagonia,"

Varenhorst recounted. "The wind was blowing hard —at
about 65 miles per hour — and a gust of wind suddenly blew me
down. It was at that moment that I realized the amazing force
of nature, and at that same instant, I recognized how lucky I
was to see what the world has to offer."

"We had the chance to meet the president of Peru, a
Stanford alumnus, during one of the trips I took to South
America," said Rick. "When I lead Stanford tours, I find

myself meeting people that I would not otherwise have the chance to meet."
While the trips are remarkable experiences for the program participants,
the professors also benefit from their travels. They are able to visit areas of
the world where later hope to conduct research or are able to take part in
experiences that would be beyond the means of most faculty.
"One spectacular trip included traveling on a private jet for three
weeks to places such as Australia. Southeast Asia," said Rick. "We were
I able to move very fast and cover quite a bit of ground very efficiently,
| something that is only possible with tremendous resources. The trip was
fantastic, if a bit ostentatious."
The price tag for such trip? It costs about the same amount as a year

of Stanford tu

weeks' worth
of travel.

are much
more accessi

"I remem
ber we took a
hike along a
beach in
Patagonia,"

Varenhorst recounted. "The wind was blowing hard —at
about 65 miles per hour — and a gust of wind suddenly blew me
down. It was at that moment that I realized the amazing force
of nature, and at that same instant, I recognized how lucky I
was to see what the world has to offer."

Coasting at 100 miles per hour over Australia in a DC-3 plane — a type of
small aircraft often used during World War II — Prof. Ronald Lyon once
lectured to an excited group of students about the geography of the conti
nent. But these were not the usual students Lyon, professor emeritus of geo
logical and environmental sciences, was used to teaching. They were a group
of Stanford alumni and their spouses traveling on one of the Alumni Associ
ation's Travel / Study Programs.
Each year, the program offers about 60 to 65 trips, which vary in both
physical rigor, to places such as Tahiti, Patagonia and Lebanon. Participants
can enroll in the "expeditions," which are physically challenging and requite
much hiking, or the "colleges," which allow passenpers to travel by luxury on
cruise ships, riverboats or trains. Stanford also offers a unique opportunity
for alumni and undergraduates to travel and learn together through the Field
Seminars program, where both can engage in hands-on fieldwork.
Although some trips are composed entirely of Stanford affiliates, larger
tours may pair up with organizations such as the Smithsonian Institution or
the American Museum of Natural History, or even with other universities,
such as Harvard. And while the trips are offered through the Alumni Asso
ciation, travelers do not, in fact, have to be Stanford alumni. Many travelers
are spouses or children of alumni, and those without any Stanford affiliation
can make a $75 contribution to the association to become members.
Stanford's Alumni Association is not alone in hosting these types of trips.
Many other universities offer trips to their alumni to foster a sense of con
nectedness to their alma maters.
"Stanford, however, had one of the first Alumni Associations to offer
such trips," explained Program Coordinator Craig Baumgartner, Class of
2002. "We're also probably the biggest Travel / Study department, and we
play a large part in planning the travel packages. Other universities, such as
the University of Washington, for example, leave much more up to the tour
operator."
However, the association does not plan every detail. The trips are first or
ganized by independent travel companies, such as International Expedi
tions, and then finely tuned by the association. The coordinators finalize the
itinerary and invite a faculty member to lead the trip. Some trips are even de
signed with a specific faculty member in mind and are organized entirely
around his or her field of research. Recently, a program was developed for
Anthropology Prof. Jim Fox.
Regardless of how they are selected, the faculty members become key
players in the program. They generally spend four to six months preparing
for the trip and becoming familiar with the countries they will visit by read
ing historical literature, studying the geography and getting acquainted with
the cultural customs. By the time they are ready to embark on the trip, they
will have prepared an entire educational experience for the passengers.
Run somewhat like Stanford courses, the trips include a reading list, lec

tries am 1 group discussions — but there are no pop quizzes or research pa
pers. The travelers are eager to simply absorb the information first-hand and
actively participate in dialogues with like-minded peers.

"People that take part in these trips are interested in trav
el for the right reasons," said John Rick, an associate profes
sor of anthropological sciences who has led several trips.
"They are going on these trips to learn, to take things at face
value, to become engaged in the history and culture."
