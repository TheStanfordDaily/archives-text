# Band's Mormon-mocking halftime show leads to apologies, sanctions
## Athletic Dept. apologizes, lets Band punish itself after field show that poked fun at polygamy 
### DAVID HERBERT DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland publicly
apologized and the Stanford Band agreed to impose
sanctions on itself after it performed a halftime show

that mocked Mormonism at a home football game
against Brigham Young University on Sept. 11.
Spokespeople for both the Athletic Department and
the Stanford Band refused to say what the sanctions
were, though The Daily has learned that they include —
and may be limited to — a formal apology and a one
game suspension for Band announcer Mark Ruben, a
recent Stanford graduate.
The halftime show, whose script was approved by the
Athletic Department, featured several jabs at the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which
sponsors BYU.
Most controversial was a swipe at polygamy in which

the Band's assistant manager, senior Tom Hennessy,
pretended to marry all five Dollies, who donned wed
ding veils for the skit. Ruben spoke through the public
address system about the sacred bond "between a man
and a woman ... and a woman ~. and a woman ... and
a woman ... and a woman."
The joke was not lost on Brigham Young fans, and
the visiting contingent unleashed a hail of boos.
Two days after the game, Stanford Athletic Director
Ted Leland issued a public apology, explaining in a writ
ten statement. "We are committed to being good hosts
to our opponents who visit Stanford,
and anything that doesn't reflect
this is regrettable."
On Sept. 14, the Band issued its
own letter of apology as well.
Because the Band is known for
satirical and sometimes controver
sial field shows, it is required to have
its programs approved by the Ath
letic Department before it performs
them.
Assistant Director for Marketing
Bob Carruesco said he had re
viewed the script prior to the game,
but he said that several jokes were
unclear and that the more offensive
jokes caught him off-guard when
the Band performed them.
"We were surprised by a couple
things," he said.
Carruesco said the Athletic De
partment didn't feel the need to im
pose any punishments on the Band
because "they felt they were capa
ble of self-sanctioning."
Band manager Stella Cousins de
clined to discuss the nature of the
sanctions, saying that secrecy was
part of the agreement between the

discuss sanctions

Band and the Athletic Department.
Dollie Lisa Asari, a sophomore, said
she did not feel the Band deserved
sanctions.
"The Athletic Department takes
on the responsibility of censoring
the show, but then they try to back
out of it when something bad hap
pens," she said.
Junior Chris Holt, a spokesman
for the Band, agreed with Carruesco
that parts of the script were open to
interpretation.
"There was a slight ambiguity
about a line where the narrator was
supposed to stutter and said 'and a
woman, and a woman and a
woman"' he said.
However, Holt also noted that
the script clearly read, "Tom mar
ries Dollies."
In Provo, Utah, the incident has
largely been forgotten and was "no
big deal," said BYU Football Media
Relations Director Jeff Reynolds.
"Stanford University handled it
appropriately," he said. "The ath
letics department was completely
professional."
