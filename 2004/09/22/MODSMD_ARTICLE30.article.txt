# Soph. College now 10 yrs. old

### ZUBIN AGARWAL 
In 1995, when Sophomore College was started,
the program consisted of five faculty teaching
seminars to 10 students each. Now, 10 years later,
SoCo has grown to over 250 students taking 21
courses ranging in subject matter from environ
mentally friendly buildings to racial issues in Cal
ifornia to the economic policies of the presiden
tial candidates.
Throughout the expansion, student approval
ratings have been exceptionally high.
According to Sharon Palmer, director of
freshman and sophomore programs, 99 percent
of participants said they would recommend the
experience to their peers. Many have rated it as
one of their best experiences at Stanford.
Dean of Religious Life Scotty McLennan, who
teaches a seminar called "The Meaning of Life,"
said student response has been "almost unam
biguously positive, if not ecstatic."
This kind of buzz explains why the number of
applications has always far exceeded the pro
gram's capacity.
So Co couples intense study with a high level
of faculty interaction and socialization. It usually
culminates in a group or individual project. The
courses allow students to explore fields of study
that may not be part of their planned major.
While many of the courses included field trips
off campus, two of the courses — "Learning The
ater" and "Naturual History, Marine Biology,
and Research," — were taught almost entirely at
the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and the Hop
kins Marine Station, respectively.
Students meet every day with their faculty
member and two course assistants for instruction,
field trips, film screenings and other course-relat
ed activities. They earn two units of credit and
pay a $400 fee toward the cost of board, although
that can be offset by financial aid.
Palmer said the mission of SoCo is "to form
close mentoring relationships with faculty, to
form intellectual communities with fellow stu

dents around the subjects studied in the semi
nars, and generally to explore their academic
interests."
The opportunity to develop an intimate rela
tionship with revered and accomplished members
of the faculty attracts many students to the pro
gram. Both University President John Hennessey
and former University President Gerhard Casper
have taught seminars.
Ravi Gupta, a partipant in "Elementary Parti
cles and their Fundmental Nature." said that So
Co was a "great way to get to know faculty."
Mukund Ramkumar said of his professor:
"You know the really cool teacher you had in high
school? It felt like one of his classes."
At a time when they might still be undecided
about a major, some students choose to test the
waters by working within their interests. Gupta
said that "Elemental Particles" confirmed his in
terest in physics. He plans to take more physics
courses in his sophomore year.
By intensely focusing on only one course doing
a short period of time. So Co provides a different
type of experience to students.
"Studying only one subject at a time allows you
to live it and breathe it," said McLennan. "Mater
ial spills out of the classroom into dining halls or
dormitory discussions, field trips, and non-class
room interactions between students and faculty."

Senior May Chiang, a sophomore college as
sistant for "Human Rights in Theory and Prac
tice," said that students "have access to a profes
sor that they wouldn't have access to under nor
mal circumstances."
So Co was founded to launch students into a
productive sophomore year by providing an in
tense academic experience alongside an introduc
tion to campus resources.
"So Co is not like regular classes where there's
pressure to do well," Gupta said. "You're learn
ing for the sake of learning."
Even though students only enroll in one course,
Palmer dispelled any rumors of a party atmosphere.
"The alcohol policy and enforcement have
been consistent over the last several years and fol
lows general Stanford policy and state law."
Chiang described the environment as "social,
but not partying."
One complaint about this year's program
was that many participants were forced to
switch residences because of the early start date
of orientation.
Sanjee Singla called the requirement "ridicu
lous," saying that it "didn't feel like SoCo was
still going on" after he had moved into his fall
residence.
"I can understand why we had to move, but it
totally changed the dynamic," Ramkamar said.

"I can understand why we had to move, but it
