### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The University has announced that,
as of this September, Dean of Admis
sion and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet
will be working a reduced number of
hours while still perfoll ning pn>fessi<>ll
- duties. She plans to step down from
her position altogether by June 1 of
next year.
"Alter considerable thought dur
ing the last few months ... I've made
the decision to have this be my last
year at Stanford," Mamlet said to
The Stanford Report. "This will
mean I'll have been at Stanford for
five years, and at this time, my desire
is to be more focused on my family,
especially my children, during this
key time in their development.
"The provost has graciously
agreed that 1 may begin to spend
more time with my family tight

away," she added. "The quality and
commitment of the current staff in
admission, financial aid and visitor
information services makes this de
cision easier."
Mamlet presided over several sig
nificant changes in undergraduate
admission policies, including the no
table shift from Stanford's prior bind
ing early decision setup to it's current
non-binding, single-choice early ac
tion system.
"I think that this certainly may en
hance our ability to enroll a diverse
class," Mamlet said regarding the
change in a prior Nov. 7, 2002 arti
cle. "It certainly will not hinder it.
Early action gives students on finan
cial aid more flexibility — they can
compare financial aid packages. 1
Indeed, Stanford's undergradu
ate population witnessed unprece
dented diversity gains within its en
tering classes during Mamlet s

tenure. As reported in an April 3.
2002 Daily article, the University an
nounced that — for the first time in
its history — more than half of its ad
mitted class were students from mi
nority groups.
"The composition of students
she's brought about during her term
at Stanford couldn't be a more excit
ing, diverse and talented group of
individuals, at least in my opinion."
said Tom Hanada, a rising senior.
"The University has increasingly be
come a more and more vibrant
place to learn and grow."
Mi unlet has been praised during
Ilt-f term b\ students and adminis
trators alike. University officials had
nothing but kind words for the out
going dean.
"We are very sorry to lose Robin
and she will be extremely difficult to
replace," said Provost John
Htchemendy to The Stanford Report.

"Nonetheless, I respect her decision
and am grateful for the guidance she
will provide during this transitional
year."
