# Revamped Axess sports new look
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
Due to a renovation of the University's entire
online administration system, Axess, Stanford's
employee and student record system, has
changed its format in an effort to make the site
easier to use. After shutting down briefly from
Aug. 5 to Aug. 10 for the upgrade, Axess is once
again open to faculty, staff and students.
Changes were planned and initiated earlier
this year when the software used by the student
administration system, People Soft Version 7.0.
was replaced by People Soft 8. The new release al
lows for more upgrades and patches.
Since Axess in particular handles so many
areas — working with the offices of graduate and
undergraduate admissions, financial aid, tuition
payment and class enrollment, among others —
Information Technology Systems and Services
(ITSS), the registrar's oflice, the law school, fi
nancial aid and human resources joined forces to
form a team of 50-plus working on the project, ac
cording to University Registrar Roger Printup,
who was involved with the renovation.
Instead of the old left-side sub-menus, the
new Axess home page features six simple tabs
atop the browser window for easier navigation.
These include tabs for courses and grades, fi
nancial matters and personal information.
Many who have logged onto Axess have already
seen the changes made with the software up
grade.
When it came time to address changes to be
made in Axess. University students were exten
sively consulted. Printup explained. Among their
suggestions were the six-tab structure, what links
should be included and how the navigation
should work similar to other Web sites.
"There should [now] be fewer clicks to get
from one place to another." Printup said.
"There's also more information in the bursar's
bill information page, to be more easily under
stood by students."
Axess also plans to have more help for finding
classes and establishing study lists.
Rising junior krysti Garcia has already no
ticed the new weekly schedule and what could
possibly be a GLR tracker, "which is really help
ful because it can be tricky to make sure you have
all your GERs covered."
While the upgrade's main purpose was to stay
current with the company's software and wasn't
necessarily intended to provide new features,
the new look has been well received, as some stu
dents believed the older version of Axess was
trickier to work with.
"I thought it was poorly divided [before]; a
long list of links," Garcia said. It would also take
a while to load when I needed to use Axess from
home.
"This version seems to load faster. I like the
new one thus far, but we 11 see when I actually
have to use it to sign up for classes and declare my
major."
"I really like having everything right there on
the main page without any pop-ups, said rising
sophomore Tyler Kirtley. "Also, they have the
most used links there so you don t have to click
on a tab to drop down all the possible links.
"I like that the important dates are on the
home page instead of in a pop up window, Gar
cia added. "No one likes pop-up windows.
