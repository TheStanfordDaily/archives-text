# Huge gift will ensure housing for all Law School students
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Thanks to a record $43.5 million gilt from bil
lionaire Charles Mlinger, Stanford Law School
will be the only top law school in the country to
guarantee its students three years of apartment
style, on-campus housing as early as lall 2007.
The gift is believed to be the largest individual gilt
ever given outright to an Amei ican law school and is
greater than the total of all previous gifts to Stanford
for student housing added together, according to
Kathleen Sullivan, dean of the Law School, who de
scribed it as "a wonderful event lor Stanford."
The gift from Charles T. Munger. vice chairman
of Berkshire Hathaway and a partner at the
Munger. Tolles and Olson law linn, and bis wile,
Nancy B. Munger was announced last Thursday.
While Charles attended Harvard Law School,
Nancy is a Stanford alumna and served on the
Board of Trustees. Several of their children and
grandchildren have also attended Stanford.
The relatively unusual gift toward bousing
came about as a result ola three-year conversa
tion between the donor, the University and
trustees, said Catherine Nardone, associate
dean of external relations at the Law School.
Munger is said to have "very strong ideas about
the project."
"1 would argue that all the universities in the
country underweight the value of housing. Har
vard and Stanford and so forth are no exception,"
Munger said. "Good housing will cause more stu
dents to be attracted to Stanford and will improve
the quality of education."
"More automatic mixing of students, better,
bigger rooms, more common facilities, better
sound-proofing and very gracious landscaping,"
were some of Monger's recommendations for the
new residence.

The gilt will cover a "good chunk" of the costs for
a new graduate student apartment complex, which
would be built in the parking lot behind Stern I lall
and the Law School, but additional fundraising will
be necessary, according to Nardone. The new resi
dence will have several hundred studio and two
bedroom apartment units and should have plenty of
room lot non-law graduate students.
Munger described the project's size as "enor
mous" and said that it would accommodate all of
the law students, a lot of the business students, as
well as other graduate students.
There are 1,200 graduate students without
campus housing, including a third of Stanford's
570 law students. Living in Palo Alto, where the
cost of living is astronomical, is difficult for those
students, who often have little income to spend,
Sullivan told The Daily in October.
Sullivan and Nardone also pointed out the im
portance of this gift in assisting the University's
ability to expand academic space. Santa Clara
County's General Use Permit states that the Uni
versity must expand its housing before it increas
es its academic space. The new graduate resi
dence will subsequently allow Stanford to add
more academic facilities.
"[The residence] will make possible the con
struction of new laboratories and classrooms for
all Stanford students," Sullivan said. "Biologists,
engineers and many others thus will benefit from
a project that started out as a law school dorm."
The new residence should also free up the cur
rent Law School dorm, Crothers Hall, to house
up to 240 undergraduate students.
An ideal timetable for the project, according to
Cardone, would be a concept and design approval
from the trustees in October, breaking ground in the
spring and opening the residence in tall 2007.
"1 don't think there is any other university that's
going to have housing like this," Munger concluded.
