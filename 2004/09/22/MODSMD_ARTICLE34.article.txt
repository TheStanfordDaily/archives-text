# U.S. News ranks Stanford No. 5

### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
The U.S. News & World Report's recently re
leased annual rankings continue to hold Stanford in
the first tier of "America's Top Schools" at the num
ber five spot.
The magazine uses 15 indicators to rate the cal
iber of higher education institutions, creating nu
merical rankings that have become increasingly in
fluential in students' matriculation decisions.
Princeton University and Harvard University
share the honor of the number one spot, with Yale
University ranked third (there was no number two
spot, as two universities shared number one), Univer
sity of Pennsylvania fourth and a three-way tie for fifth
between Duke, MIT, and Stanford. This is Princeton's
fifth straight year with a share in the top spot.
U.S. News distinguished UC-Berkeley as the num
ber one public school in the nation. Nonetheless, rival
Cal still finished behind Stanford overall, placed 21 in
"America's Top Schools."
U.S. News categorizes schools based on the develop
ments of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advance
ment of Teaching. There are 248 schools in the nation
al university category — 102 public and 86 private —
which are evaluated against their peer institutions to
yield a numerical ranking.
The most important determinants influencing
the U.S. rankings include assessment of peer insti
tutions by top school administrators (comprising
25 percent of a school's score), retention rates of
freshmen returning to school the subsequent year
and eventually graduating (amounting to 20 per
cent of the score), faculty resource (20 percent) and
student selectivity (15 percent).
The remaining 20 percent of the score is shared
among factors like financial resources, graduation
rate performance and alumni donation rates. The
schools largely volunteer the categorical data
through surveys, with the blanks filled in by the
American Association of University Professors, the
NCAA and the U.S. Department of Education's Na
tional Center for Education Statistics.
Whether it be to determine which school is most de
serving of their tuition dollars or to see recognition of
their institution's achievement, students and adminis
trators alike await the yearly U.S. News rankings.
Nonetheless, many of even the most glorified univer
sities contend that a number cannot do justice to the
college experience offered by their specific school.
In a news statement issued by Princeton , adminis
trators claimed rankings "cannot capture the distinc
tiveness of any institution or whether one or another
university might be an appropriate match for any in
dividual student."
Though Stanford has consistently maintained a
top spot in the U.S. News rankings, university offi
cials have always claimed that Stanford offers a
unique experience and students selected for reasons
beyond grades and exam scores.
"I don't think a ranking could ever capture how
much I've taken out of my college experience," said
rising junior Ratul Narain. "But, it's still pretty cool
that other people seem to think a lot of Stanford too. "
While many administrators and students contend
that the intangible "college experience" cannot be
captured in a number, the U.S. News ranking system
will continue to play a large role in school selection.
