The renovations to Maples Pavilion fea
turing a four-sided, center-hung store
hoard with video display, 360-degree con
course plaza, speakers in enlarged re
strooms, elevators and new seats will be
completed a month ahead of schedule, on
Dec. 1 ol this year.
Assistant Athletic Director Gary Migdol
attributed the earlier completion to "great
collaboration between people in the Ath
letic Department who've worked on the
project and contractors who've put in
extra hours and done a fantastic job of
keeping not only on schedule, but ahead
of schedule.
"()ur hats off to them." Migdol added.
While the arena will be ready for occu
pation on Dec. 1, the first game in Maples
will take place on Dec. 10 when the

women's basketball team plays Pepper
dine at 7 p.m. There will be "some gala
event" surrounding the opening, the de
tails of which are still being worked out,
according to Migdol.
With the renovations being completed
beibre the expected January 2005 date,
the Cardinal women's basketball team will
only have to play lour games at Santa
Clara University's Levy Center, instead of
the five games they had planned on play
ing oil campus. The men's team only has
to play one exhibition game at the Levy
Center rather than the four that had been
anticipated.
"1 will be thrilled if Maples is finished
a month early." said rising junior point
guard Chris Hernandez. "We could start
taking advantage of all the new aspects of
the project and it would be nice to have
our fans travel to Santa Clara for only
one game."
