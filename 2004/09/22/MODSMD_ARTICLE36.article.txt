## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A report by University President
John Hennessy's advisory committee
on workplace policies has found that
the University does not know enough
about its employees, including who is
provided with health insurance and
exactly how many employees work on
campus at any given time.
"We know very little about the peo
ple who work lor us in temporary jobs
and maybe nothing about the people
who work on campus as part of a con

tract to do services," Human Resources
Director Diane Peck told the Stanford
News Service.
The report also unearthed an ex
tremely high turnover rate for Univer
sity workers, especially those employed
by contractors for low-wage labor. It
states that 07 percent of workers mak
ing $8 or less per hour left their jobs by
the end of the year indicating a low rate
of worker satisfaction, leading to a de
cline in productivity.
According to the committee, the sta
tus of worker health insurance is a
major factor in the well being of Uni

versity employees.
Despite the dissatisfaction of some
employees, the report confirmed the
satisfaction of other groups, notably
those who are provided with health in
surance.
This point is of particular interest to
the University, as it also shows what fu
ture actions might he taken to improve
employment conditions for other
workers.
The first recommended steps in this
direction include reform of the current
employee grievance procedure to in
clude temporary and contacted work

crs, the removal of restrictions on the
living wage that will allow more casual
workers to benefit from the policy, and
the increased collection of data on
workers and wages that will allow Stan
lord to further adjust the living wage to
better meet people's needs.
The advisory committee, comprised
of faculty, stall members and students,
also discussed the possibility of an em
ployment agency run by Stanford itself
in order to ensure that all critical em
ployment information is readily avail
able and good employment conditions
are maintained.
