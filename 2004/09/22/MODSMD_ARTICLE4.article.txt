could only be one thing: Convocation.
Freshmen, transfer students and their families gath

official welcome to the University. President John Hen

and Dean of Religious Life Scotty McLennan addressed
the crowd.
One of the most salient images offered at the convo
cation was Head Orientation Coordinator Sung-Woo
Cho's metaphor of unpacking. Cho, Class of 2004, com
pared the individual characteristics and eccentricities of
incoming students to the boxes they brought to Stanford.
He encouraged students to unpack their bo* es and ex
pose themselves to new people and experiences.
Cho described the diverse group of friends he met

can discover themselves and their true potential, he
said.
And, in a nod to his older listeners, he added,
" This is what your parents wanted for you."
Cho's words resonated with many new students.
Eugene Adogla, a freshman from Ghana, cited the
speech as the most moving of the afternoon.
"It made me feel more at home," Adogla said. "It
gave me a greater feeling of community."
Brennan Rego, a freshman from Idaho, said that
the speech made him excited to get started.
"I liked Cho's speech because it was neat to see
where you might end up in four years," he said.
Hennessey followed Cho with a speech inspired
by his summer reading, a biography of U.S. Presi
dent Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt, Hennessey
said, shared many characteristics with Stanford stu
dents past and present.
Hennessey said that Roosevelt displayed an early
interest in learning, strongly believed in a healthy
body and mind, demonstrated integrity in spear
heading social reforms, and, most importantly, was
defined by his "intellectual curiosity and passion for
learning."
Hennessey urged students to devote themselves

kicks off with speeches

to the betterment of their society in what he called
"this time of great change."
Specifically, he encouraged students to get to
know their faculty in and out of the classroom, to
seek out opportunities to serve their communities
and take risks along the way. He noted that Roo
sevelt faced several major failures in addition to his
successes.
Many new students appreciated this message.
"It made me feel good to know it's okay to fail
and strive for unattainable goals," said Anne Barry,
a freshman from New York.
Some students said that they were inspired by
Manilet and Bravman's messages as well.
Manilet extolled the talents and accomplish
ments of the incoming class and explained why they
were selected. Bravman wished new students a
warm hello and assured parents that he would take
good care of their children.
Freshman Tod Chubrich was especially struck by
Bravman's "notion of partnership with the world."
He also noted that the convocation was in keeping
with the tone of Orientation thus far.
"It just gets better and better," he said. "It's just
been one ongoing academic and social orgasm."
