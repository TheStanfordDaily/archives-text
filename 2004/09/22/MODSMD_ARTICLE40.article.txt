Card kicks off 21N14 with 43-3 blowout
of San Jo.se State
The Cardinal football team's defense was sharp on
Sept. 4 at Stanford Stadium, keeping San Jose State out
of the end zone all night. But as the first half wound
down, Stanford clung to a slim, 7-0 lead. In the eyes of
sophomore Evan Moore, it was time to make a play.
"Seven to nothing? We've just gotta bust this open,"
the 6-foot-7 receiver recalled thinking. "Better sooner
than later."
So when the Cardinal faced fourth-and-two at the
Spartans' 30-yard line with five minutes left in the half,
Moore and quarterback Trent Edwards were thinking
big things.
Moore sprinted up the sideline, cut back inside as
Edwards lofted a pass downfield, reaching the ball just
in time to bat it with one hand and reel it in as he fell
into the end zone.
The energy from Moore's big play carried over to
the second stanza, and the Cardinal wound up with a
dominant, 43-3 win over the beleaguered Spartans.
"That play wasn't scripted for me to cut inside,"
Moore explained. "Trent and I developed a connection
over the summer that allowed that [play | to happen. He
knew I was gonna take it inside and he made a great
throw. He expects me to make that catch, even if it's
one-handed."
Moore finished with a team-high four catches for 77
yards and two touchdowns, while Edwards was 14-of-22
passing for 187 yards and two touchdowns. He also

rushed fora score in the third quarter before leaving the
game after banging up both his shoulders.
"Our first ballgame, we wanted to be clean opera
tionally, and we were," head coach Buddy Teevens
said. "There were a lot of good things, bu: we've got a
lot of things to do."
Quarterback-punter Dale Rogers led the Spartans
with 44 yards rushing, while also completing 12-of-14
passes for 115 yards. The Spartans chipped away here
and there, but Stanford's defense gave up just five plays
of more than 12 yards, and none of them came on the
same possession.
"We were mixing up our coverage a lot, and they
didn't really test us downfield." said cornerback T.J.
Rushing, who had five tackles, including two fora loss.
"We decided to bring (pressure) up front because they
weren't testing us deep with their receivers."
It worked, as the Spartans managed to score on only
one of their 13 possessions. Jeff Carr kicked a 40-yard
field goal in the fourth quarter, one play after Stanford
linebacker Jared Newberry hit running back Lamar
Ferguson fora 21-yard loss.
Teevens is 3-0 lifetime against the Spartans, and
Stanford hasn't lost to them since 2000, but Saturday's
win was nonetheless a notable one. The Cardinal's 40-
point margin of victory was its largest in 13 years (Stan
ford defeated Cornell, 56-6, in 1991) and the team did
not commit a turnover for the first time in 31 games
Also, the Cardinal and the Spartans do hot play each
other in 2005 or 2006, and the perpetually moribund
San Jose State football program might not be around by
the next time the two teams could play.
Stanford leads the all-time series, 46-13-1.

Stanford mauls
Cougars, 37-10
Less than 12 minutes
into Saturday's game, the
Stanford football team
found itself facing a 10-0
deficit against Brighani
Young, having yielded 123
yards while rushing for
minus-38 yards and man
aging just one pass com
pletion during its first
three possessions.
But after the Matt
Payne field goal that put
the Cougars up 10-0 late,
junior cornerback T.J.
Rushing responded with
an impressive, 99-yard
kickoff return fora touch
down.
The Cardinal would
score six more times while
holding Brigham Young
scoreless for the final 47
minutes, propelling Stan
ford to a 37-10 victory end
a 2-0 Record.
"I was never worried
when they were up 10-0,"
Teevens said. "I knew we
had things we were capa
ble of doing."
And the receivers did a
lot. Tight end Alex Smith
had six catches for 87
yards, including a second
quarter touchdown that
put Stanford up, 14-10.
Making that TD possible
was an incredible 76-yard
reception by Mark Brad
ford. who caught a short
pass in the flat and eluded
three different packs of
Cougars before finally
being dragged out of
bounds.

"We knew they were pretty poor tacklers," Edwards
said. "If you could get them to miss once ..."
The Cougars missed plenty of tackles, although Ed
wards still took his share of hits, thanks in part to his ten-

dency to roll out of the pocket and run for first downs.
On one third-quarter play, the sophomore rolled out
to his left and was cornered near the sideline by a pair
of Cougars before throwing a 21-yard laser off the
wrong foot to Justin McCullum in the end zone, putting
the Cardinal up 24-10.
He also threw a well-timed, 24-yard fade to 6-foot-7
Evan Moore in the fourth quarter for Stanford's last
touchdown.
"I think he grew up a little bit today," Teevens said
of his signalcaller, who set career highs for passing
yards, touchdowns and pass attempts. "He executed
well and showed some toughness."
The defense finished well, too, holding the Cougars'
inventive offense to just 165 yards over the last three
quarters. No Cougar managed a play of longer than 25
yards in the game.
Senior safety Oshiomogho Atogwe explained the

Cougars' failed plan of attack.
"They were doing a lot of influence routes, where
they send a guy in front of you and a guy behind you and
if you jump the guy in front of you, the guy behind you

is open," he said. "But when you start putting pressure
on them, they can't see [the open man]."
The Cardinal defense recovered three fumbles and
intercepted four passes, while hitting the Cougars with
two sacks and seven tackles fora loss.
"The name of the game is turnovers," Atogwe said.
"The more times you get the offense the ball, the more
times they can score with."
Stanford has forced seven turnovers this year, while
giving up only two, and the team has outscored its op
ponents 80-13 — the best two-game stretch in Teevens'
tenure.
After a bye last weekend, though, the Cardinal will
have to take on national No. 1 Southern California — a
daunting challenge for any team.
"I think it's a nice time fora bye week]. It gives us a
chance to study them a little more," Teevens said.
"We've got a lot of work to do."
