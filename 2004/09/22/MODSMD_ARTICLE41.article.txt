# Cardinal seek bowl return behind stronger defense
## Despite a disappointing 2003 season, Stanford sees signs of improvement 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Autumn breeds optimism, so while the Cardinal has
not forgotten the last two painful years, it believes that
this is the year things will come together. Underscoring
this point are four of Stanford's returning seniors — men
who've seen two prior seasons fall apart and know just
how hard it can be to win in the Pacific-10 Conference.
"When I was a freshman, a sophomore, winning was
easy because 1 wasn't the one doing it," said senior safe
ty Oshiomogho Atogwe, an AII-Pac-10 selection last
season. "I feel like it's my job as a senior to instill that in
the other guys, that it's hard to win, and when you do
win, you hold on to it and appreciate it."
Stanford (2-0) head coach Buddy Teevens, who won
two games in 2002 and four last season, is more com
fortable with the shape and direction of the Cardinal
than ever before.
"It's a natural progression," Teevens said. "I look at
the squad and the experience gained and their under
standing of expectations. Each year I feel better about
where our team is."
And perhaps with good reason. The 2002 Cardinal
was largely a shell-shocked unit, wondering what was
happening as a team expected to be one of the best of
fensive units in the country never got off the ground,
stumbling to a 2-9 finish. The 2003 squad showed more
resolve and preparation, but success on the practice field
didn't always translate to game day. Still, the team
fought its way to a 4-4 record before tiring late.
"We feel we have progressed, and to substantiate
that on Saturdays is important." Teevens said. "It's far

closer, the understanding and belief in leadership, ac
countability and ownership by the players."
Ask Stanford's seniors what their goal is, and their
hope is both clear and reasonable.
"The team goal is just to get back to the bowl game,"
senior tight end Alex Smith said. "That's really the main
goal that the seniors have set."
Helping out Stanford's quest will be the addition of
one more bowl to the Pac-10's slate of affiliated post
season contests. The Emerald Bowl (formerly known as
the San Francisco Bowl) has reached an agreement with
the Pac-10 to take its sixth-best team, to play against the
Mountain West's third-best team at SBC Park on Dec.
30. The addition of this bowl will, in all likelihood, give a
bowl berth to a Pac-10 team that otherwise wouldn't re
ceive an invite.
Of course, before Stanford can worry about bowl
games, it will need to find at least six wins on its al
ways-difficult schedule. Going even 2-6 in the Pac-10,
as the Cardinal did last year, is not going to be an easy
task. For the second straight year, Stanford does not
get to play Pac-10 doormat Arizona, which was the
only team picked by the media to finish below the Car
dinal this year.
Coming of this off week, Stanford will face 2003 na
tional champion Southern California and Washington at
home. Circle the Huskies in red. because they're the
kind of team Stanford must beat this year if it wants to
improve on last year's record.
The rest of the season offers road contests at Notre
Dame, Washington State. UCLA, Arizona State and
Cal. as well as home dates with Oregon and Oregon
State.
The teams on Stanford's schedule went a combined
75-63 last year.
In addition to returning nine defensive and five of
fensive starts, Stanford has made what it hopes are cor
rective changes to its game plan. Defensive coordinator
A.J. Christoff. in his second season, has installed a 3-4
defensive scheme and Bill Cubit, promoted to offensive
coordinator in the wake of David Kelly's departure, will

bring some new wrinkles to Teevens' offense.
One change might be a more focal role for Smith,
who caught 30 balls in 2002 and 24 last year. Smith has
been working closely with starting quarterback Trent
Edwards, who saw action in five games as a redshirt
freshman last season.
"We've been trying to work out as much as possi
ble," Smith said. "Together, we're just trying to work
on timing."
With Smith's strong play in the middle of the field,
Edwards (77-of-170 for 750 yards last year) will look to
standout Mark Bradford (37 catches as a true freshman)
down the field. Wideouts like 6-foot-7 Evan Moore,
Greg Camarillo and converted safety Marcus Mc-
Cutcheon — who Smith cited as one of the most im
pressive players in spring camp — will give Edwards a
variety of other targets.
"Trent was very strong this spring." Teevens said.
"He's about 15-to-18 pounds heavier, his confidence is
strong and he's throwing the ball effectively."
Running backs J R. Lemon (118 carries for 467
yards) and Kenneth Tolon (150 rushes for 522 yards)
will lead the ground game behind a young but talented
offensive line.
"With J R. Lemon's work ethic all through the winter
and spring. 1 feel he's ready to break out," Smith said.
On defense, Stanford's lincbacking corps — possibly
the team's strongest unit — is excited about the new
four-backer scheme.
"I think since we're playing a 3-4 now, that just al
lows us to blitz from either side of the ball at any time,"
said senior David Bergeron, who ranked third on the
team with 66 tackles last season. "This just gives us
more flexibility."
Senior linebacker Jared Newberry, who had 67 tack
les and a team-high 9.5 tackles fora loss last season, be
lieves the success of the blitz will all start with the play of
junior nose tackle Babatunde Oshinowo, who had a
team-high four sacks in 2003.
"The defense is really based on Babatunde," New
berry said. "If we can get that push from the front three.

that'll make it so they can't hit those plays downhill."
Atogwe, the team's defensive MVP last season with
a team-high 90 tackles as a free safety, will lead the sec
ondary, which returns in its entirety. Leigh Torrence
and Stanley Wilson are the corners and Trevor Hooper
is the strong safety.
Kicker Michael Sgroi (7-of-13 on field goals) returns,
but the Cardinal will have to find a replacement for All-
Pac-10 punter Eric Johnson, who often did kickoffs last
year while setting a school record with 3,687 gross yards.
Teevens and the Cardinal know that cynicism is high
and expectations are low after the last two seasons, but
that hasn't dampened his relentless enthusiasm.
"Certainly, with where we've been, I understand the
(negative) perspective," he said. "(But] we've played a
lot of young players early out of necessity. Though they

For their part, the Cardinal players want to make the
2002-03 season go down as nothing more than a learning
experience.
"You're embarrassed that it happened, but it's fuel to
never let it happen again," Atogwe said. "You don't
want that to be what people remember you for."

not forgotten the last two painful years, it believes that
this is the year things will come together. Underscoring
this point are four of Stanford's returning seniors — men
who've seen two prior seasons fall apart and know just
how hard it can be to win in the Pacific-10 Conference.
"When I was a freshman, a sophomore, winning was
easy because 1 wasn't the one doing it," said senior safe
ty Oshiomogho Atogwe, an AII-Pac-10 selection last
season. "I feel like it's my job as a senior to instill that in
the other guys, that it's hard to win, and when you do
win, you hold on to it and appreciate it."
Stanford (2-0) head coach Buddy Teevens, who won
two games in 2002 and four last season, is more com
fortable with the shape and direction of the Cardinal
than ever before.
"It's a natural progression," Teevens said. "I look at
the squad and the experience gained and their under
standing of expectations. Each year I feel better about
where our team is."
And perhaps with good reason. The 2002 Cardinal
was largely a shell-shocked unit, wondering what was
happening as a team expected to be one of the best of
fensive units in the country never got off the ground,
stumbling to a 2-9 finish. The 2003 squad showed more
resolve and preparation, but success on the practice field
didn't always translate to game day. Still, the team
fought its way to a 4-4 record before tiring late.
"We feel we have progressed, and to substantiate
that on Saturdays is important." Teevens said. "It's far

closer, the understanding and belief in leadership, ac
countability and ownership by the players."
Ask Stanford's seniors what their goal is, and their
hope is both clear and reasonable.
"The team goal is just to get back to the bowl game,"
senior tight end Alex Smith said. "That's really the main
goal that the seniors have set."
Helping out Stanford's quest will be the addition of
one more bowl to the Pac-10's slate of affiliated post
season contests. The Emerald Bowl (formerly known as
the San Francisco Bowl) has reached an agreement with
the Pac-10 to take its sixth-best team, to play against the
Mountain West's third-best team at SBC Park on Dec.
30. The addition of this bowl will, in all likelihood, give a
bowl berth to a Pac-10 team that otherwise wouldn't re
ceive an invite.
Of course, before Stanford can worry about bowl
games, it will need to find at least six wins on its al
ways-difficult schedule. Going even 2-6 in the Pac-10,
as the Cardinal did last year, is not going to be an easy
task. For the second straight year, Stanford does not
get to play Pac-10 doormat Arizona, which was the
only team picked by the media to finish below the Car
dinal this year.
Coming of this off week, Stanford will face 2003 na
tional champion Southern California and Washington at
home. Circle the Huskies in red. because they're the
kind of team Stanford must beat this year if it wants to
improve on last year's record.
The rest of the season offers road contests at Notre
Dame, Washington State. UCLA, Arizona State and
Cal. as well as home dates with Oregon and Oregon
State.
The teams on Stanford's schedule went a combined
75-63 last year.
In addition to returning nine defensive and five of
fensive starts, Stanford has made what it hopes are cor
rective changes to its game plan. Defensive coordinator
A.J. Christoff. in his second season, has installed a 3-4
defensive scheme and Bill Cubit, promoted to offensive
coordinator in the wake of David Kelly's departure, will

bring some new wrinkles to Teevens' offense.
One change might be a more focal role for Smith,
who caught 30 balls in 2002 and 24 last year. Smith has
been working closely with starting quarterback Trent
Edwards, who saw action in five games as a redshirt
freshman last season.
"We've been trying to work out as much as possi
ble," Smith said. "Together, we're just trying to work
on timing."
With Smith's strong play in the middle of the field,
Edwards (77-of-170 for 750 yards last year) will look to
standout Mark Bradford (37 catches as a true freshman)
down the field. Wideouts like 6-foot-7 Evan Moore,
Greg Camarillo and converted safety Marcus Mc-
Cutcheon — who Smith cited as one of the most im
pressive players in spring camp — will give Edwards a
variety of other targets.
"Trent was very strong this spring." Teevens said.
"He's about 15-to-18 pounds heavier, his confidence is
strong and he's throwing the ball effectively."
Running backs J R. Lemon (118 carries for 467
yards) and Kenneth Tolon (150 rushes for 522 yards)
will lead the ground game behind a young but talented
offensive line.
"With J R. Lemon's work ethic all through the winter
and spring. 1 feel he's ready to break out," Smith said.
On defense, Stanford's lincbacking corps — possibly
the team's strongest unit — is excited about the new
four-backer scheme.
"I think since we're playing a 3-4 now, that just al
lows us to blitz from either side of the ball at any time,"
said senior David Bergeron, who ranked third on the
team with 66 tackles last season. "This just gives us
more flexibility."
Senior linebacker Jared Newberry, who had 67 tack
les and a team-high 9.5 tackles fora loss last season, be
lieves the success of the blitz will all start with the play of
junior nose tackle Babatunde Oshinowo, who had a
team-high four sacks in 2003.
"The defense is really based on Babatunde," New
berry said. "If we can get that push from the front three.

that'll make it so they can't hit those plays downhill."
Atogwe, the team's defensive MVP last season with
a team-high 90 tackles as a free safety, will lead the sec
ondary, which returns in its entirety. Leigh Torrence
and Stanley Wilson are the corners and Trevor Hooper
is the strong safety.
Kicker Michael Sgroi (7-of-13 on field goals) returns,
but the Cardinal will have to find a replacement for All-
Pac-10 punter Eric Johnson, who often did kickoffs last
year while setting a school record with 3,687 gross yards.
Teevens and the Cardinal know that cynicism is high
and expectations are low after the last two seasons, but
that hasn't dampened his relentless enthusiasm.
"Certainly, with where we've been, I understand the
(negative) perspective," he said. "(But] we've played a
lot of young players early out of necessity. Though they

experience.

want that to be what people remember you for."
