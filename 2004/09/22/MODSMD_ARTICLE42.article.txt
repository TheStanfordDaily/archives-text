# Still a powerhouse
## Card start season 7-2 with help from a young roster 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's volleyball
season is underway and has been for
the past month. This year's team has
posted a 7-2 record through three
tournaments getting warmed up for
Pacific-10 Conference play, which
opens Thursday at Burnham Pavilion.
Head coach John Dunning is en
tering his fourth season at the helm
of the team.
After bringing home a national
championship in his inaugural sea
son on the Farm in 2001, Dunning
took the Cardinal to the playoffs in
both 2002 and 2003. Last year's Stan
ford squad was bounced by Washing
ton, 3-1, in the regional semifinal of
the NCAA Tournament.
"When it comes down to it in the
end, the tournament is about the
team with the most momentum,"
Dunning said. "Washington kept
getting better as the year went on,
and they were just on a roll when we
played them."
Senior outside hitter Ogonna
Nnamani — who recently returned
from the Athens, where she com
peted as a member of Team USA —
is coming off a season in which she
set the all-time Stanford record for
kills in a single season with 627 as
part of one of the most explosive
outsides in the college ranks.
She's excited to be back on the
Farm and working with her Cardi
nal teammates again
"It's hard to get back and get in
sync with everyone after 8 months
away, but I feel better and better
each day [I work out] with the
team," Nnamani said.
Joining Nnamani on the outside
will be sophomore Kristen
Richards, last year's Pac-10 and Na
tional Freshman of the Year.
"With Ogonna and Kristen team

ing up, it really gives us a two-head
ed monster that can compete with
any team out there," Dunning said.
"When those two are on, there's no
body out there who we can't beat.
"They could be the best one-two
combination in the country."
At the middle blocker position
— the position at which Stanford
comes in with the least experience
— the Cardinal will turn primarily
to sophomore Lizzie Suiter and
freshman Franci Girard.
Suiter saw limited action during
her freshman campaign, but Dun
ning has been pleased with her
progress.
"Lizzie is a player with great big
hands who loves to get physical at
the net. We're looking forward to
watching her develop into an every
day player and a force at net," Dun
ning said.
Girard has shown impressive ath
leticism and has surprised Stanford
coaches with her level of play in the
early going.
"Franci will be used as our more
offensive blocker. We've been real
ly happy with how quickly she's
taken to the system out here," Dun
ning said of the true freshman from
Brooklyn.
The Cardinal will employ a sec
ond freshman starter this season as
Bryn Kehoe, last year's High School
National Player of the Year (an
honor Kristen Richards won the
year before) takes the court as the
Cardinal's setter.
Junior Katie Goldhahn, who did
most of the setting last season for
the Cardinal, is out with a strained
right Achilles tendon, and Kehoe
will be in the starting lineup until
Goldhahn is fully recovered from
the injury.
Look for senior Jenn Hucke to
contribute from the opposite side as
well. One of three seniors on the
team, Hucke brings loads of leader
ship and experience to an otherwise
young team.
Rounding out the senior roll call
is defensive specialist / libero Leahi
Hall, who will be donning the libero
jersey for the first time as a starter.

Hall will also be allowed to serve for
the first time as a libero and pro
vides valuable leadership for Stan
ford on the court.
The Cardinal opened the 2004
season at the Sands / SBC Tourna
ment in Reno, Nevada. After de
feating the Utah State Aggies 3-1 in
their opening match, the Cardinal
suffered their first loss of the season
in a five-game thriller against St.
Mary's College.
Stanford bounced back to defeat
Nevada and pick up a second-place
finish in the tournament.
At the Stanford Invitational, the
team swept Eastern Washington be-
