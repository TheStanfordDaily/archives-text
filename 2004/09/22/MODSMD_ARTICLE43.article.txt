# Men open year in familiar spot: No. 1
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Last season, the Stanford men's water
polo team (5-1, 0-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) was relatively green,
with only one senior on the squad. Even
so, Stanford advanced to the NCAA fi
nals, where Southern California (4-0) was
able to grab a 9-7 overtime win.
Despite the fact that Stanford's roster
was largely made up of young players, the
team certainly was not inexperienced.
The Cardinal still came away with a 22-5,
7-1 MPSF record and a successful season.
This year the title should be within a
much closer — and more comfortable —

reach for the Cardinal.
There are five returning seniors, and
head coach John Vargas believes the
team is generally more mature. The Stan
ford squad has gained experience and
now includes both players who came so
close to winning it all in 2003 and those
who yearn to return to the feeling of vic
tory that came with the 2002 and 2001 na
tional titles.
The impressive senior class includes
driver Tony Azevedo, who competed for
the United States Olympic team in
Greece, two-meter Greg Crum, and driv
er Matt Moser. Sam Tyre and Trent
Weisen, both of whom can play any side
of the pool, also return for their final

years on the Farm.
"We expect Azevedo to contribute,
but we also have others that [will do
well]," said Vargas, citing junior goal
keeper Chad Taylor, Crum and junior
driver Peter Varellas.
While the remaining 15 players are ei
ther freshmen or sophomores, Vargas, in
his third season at Stanford, has a lot to
boast about when speaking of his crop of
younger players.
"We have a little more depth than the
year before," Vargas said.
Put together, the men make up a tal
ented and heavily favored team. Azevedo
has won MPSF Player of the Year for the
past three years, with a fourth award in
sight. Varellas made the NCAA All-
Tournament first team in the 2003 season,
and senior driver Thomas Hopkins was
named honorable mention All-American.
In addition to the trio, the Cardinal have
also collected a large number of MPSF
awards.
The freshmen don't lag behind in the
honors department either. The class in
cludes incoming goalkeeper Sandy Ho
hener, who has played for the United
States Youth team.
"I definitely feel we have a lot of guys
who will contribute and play well this
year," Vargas said.
No. 1 Stanford has already posted
dominant wins over No. 19 Santa Clara
(1-6) and No. 14 BYU-Hawaii (4-1), beat
ing them 16-4 and 17-7, respectively.
Hopkins led the Cardinal in both games
fora total of 12 goals, which earned him
Co-MPSF Player of the Week. He also
tallied a career-high eight goals against
BYU-Hawaii.
The now-seasoned group continued its
success against four more opponents over
the weekend.
The Southern California Tournament
featured plenty of formidable and talent
ed competition for the Cardinal with the
nation's seven top teams, but the top
seeded Cardinal disposed of No. 12 UC
San Diego (8-4) and No. 6 Long Beach
State (4-3) on Saturday. After beating the
Tritons 16-5 with five goals from Azeve
do, Stanford added another victory, a 13-
3 thrashing of the 49ers.
A win against UCLA Sunday morning
placed the Cardinal in the tournament's
championship game, where it faced its host,
No. 2 USC. The Trojans upset the Cardinal
8-6 Sunday night and Stanford was forced to
settle fora second-place finish.
Stanford water polo heads back to the
pool on Saturday afternoon to face the
Trojans for the second straight game. The
matchup will begin at 1 p.m. at the Avery
Aquatic Center.

The Cardinal has already shown a
knack for leaving its opponents in the
dust with impressive scoring streaks —
including nine unanswered goals in the
season opener against the Broncos and
a second-half shutout against Long
Beach. Vargas and fans have become
aware of the team's offensive force
early in the season, but Vargas will
work both on defense and on balancing
the offense.
"We have a lot offensive weapons,"
Vargas said. "The trick is to be able to
use all of them well."

able to grab a 9-7 overtime win.
Despite the fact that Stanford's roster
was largely made up of young players, the
team certainly was not inexperienced.
The Cardinal still came away with a 22-5,
7-1 MPSF record and a successful season.
This year the title should be within a
much closer — and more comfortable —

reach for the Cardinal.
There are five returning seniors, and
head coach John Vargas believes the
team is generally more mature. The Stan
ford squad has gained experience and
now includes both players who came so
close to winning it all in 2003 and those
who yearn to return to the feeling of vic
tory that came with the 2002 and 2001 na
tional titles.
The impressive senior class includes
driver Tony Azevedo, who competed for
the United States Olympic team in
Greece, two-meter Greg Crum, and driv
er Matt Moser. Sam Tyre and Trent
Weisen, both of whom can play any side
of the pool, also return for their final

years on the Farm.
"We expect Azevedo to contribute,
but we also have others that [will do
well]," said Vargas, citing junior goal
keeper Chad Taylor, Crum and junior
driver Peter Varellas.
While the remaining 15 players are ei
ther freshmen or sophomores, Vargas, in
his third season at Stanford, has a lot to
boast about when speaking of his crop of
younger players.
"We have a little more depth than the
year before," Vargas said.
Put together, the men make up a tal
ented and heavily favored team. Azevedo
has won MPSF Player of the Year for the
past three years, with a fourth award in
sight. Varellas made the NCAA All-
Tournament first team in the 2003 season,
and senior driver Thomas Hopkins was
named honorable mention All-American.
In addition to the trio, the Cardinal have
also collected a large number of MPSF
awards.
The freshmen don't lag behind in the
honors department either. The class in
cludes incoming goalkeeper Sandy Ho
hener, who has played for the United
States Youth team.
"I definitely feel we have a lot of guys
who will contribute and play well this
year," Vargas said.
No. 1 Stanford has already posted
dominant wins over No. 19 Santa Clara
(1-6) and No. 14 BYU-Hawaii (4-1), beat
ing them 16-4 and 17-7, respectively.
Hopkins led the Cardinal in both games
fora total of 12 goals, which earned him
Co-MPSF Player of the Week. He also
tallied a career-high eight goals against
BYU-Hawaii.
The now-seasoned group continued its
success against four more opponents over
the weekend.
The Southern California Tournament
featured plenty of formidable and talent
ed competition for the Cardinal with the
nation's seven top teams, but the top
seeded Cardinal disposed of No. 12 UC
San Diego (8-4) and No. 6 Long Beach
State (4-3) on Saturday. After beating the
Tritons 16-5 with five goals from Azeve
do, Stanford added another victory, a 13-
3 thrashing of the 49ers.
A win against UCLA Sunday morning
placed the Cardinal in the tournament's
championship game, where it faced its host,
No. 2 USC. The Trojans upset the Cardinal
8-6 Sunday night and Stanford was forced to
settle fora second-place finish.
Stanford water polo heads back to the
pool on Saturday afternoon to face the
Trojans for the second straight game. The
matchup will begin at 1 p.m. at the Avery
Aquatic Center.

The Cardinal has already shown a
knack for leaving its opponents in the
dust with impressive scoring streaks —
including nine unanswered goals in the
season opener against the Broncos and
a second-half shutout against Long
Beach. Vargas and fans have become
aware of the team's offensive force
early in the season, but Vargas will
work both on defense and on balancing
the offense.
"We have a lot offensive weapons,"
Vargas said. "The trick is to be able to
use all of them well."
