# Forget 2003: Men's soccer starts 5-0-1
## 
### JESSICA PETERS MANAGING EDITOR 
After the Stanford men's soccer team compiled
the program's worst record in over 30 years, the 2003
season was called a shock, an embarrassment, a let
down, a disappointment and a heartbreaker.
But for the Cardinal, 2003 can only be described
one way.
It's over.
Since last season's end in December, the Stanford
squad has undergone a transformation, physically
and mentally, which makes it apparent that 2003's 3-
15-2 team won't be seen anywhere near Maloney
Field this year.
"We all worked very hard — the players, the
coaches — to completely change the team's charac
ter and environment," said Stanford head coach Bret
Simon, who enters his fourth year at the helm of the
soccer squad. "We've made (the team) much more
competitive, more disciplined."
The off-season began with large amounts of
small-group position work and continued with

scrimmages, drills and endless amounts of running.
Everything was aimed at boosting the Cardinal's al
ready-strong talent and work ethic.
"I think to instill confidence in a team that was
shaken (like ours was in 2003], you have to work
hard and prepare them," Simon said. "(They should]
feel like they deserve to win because they've worked
harder than every opponent out there."
Simon's philosophy seems like a sound one. But
does it work?
Maybe the Cardinal's current 5-0-1 record can an
swer that question.
The team traveled to Dallas, Tex. in early
September and opened the 2004 season with a score
less draw at then-No. 17 Tulsa. Stanford next bull
dozed then-No. 11 Southern Methodist 2-0, and did
it all with five players sidelined by injuries. The Car
dinal has since topped San Jose State, San Diego,
UC-Irvine and Cal State Fullerton.
The offense has been doing its job, bringing on
strong attacks and creating scoring opportunities,
while the defense has been a brick wall that has al
lowed just one goal this season.
Yeah, 2003 is definitely over.
The Cardinal transformation has been helped
along by the fact that Stanford lost only three players
to graduation and the MLS draft — midfielder Mike
Wilson and defenders Abe Geiger and Chad Marshall.
The team returns seven seniors who provide a
strong leadership base on and off the pitch. The
group includes goalkeeper and team captain Robby
Fulton and 2003 points leader Matt Janusz, in addi
tion to striker Darren Fernandez (who lays claim to
four of the Cardinal's nine goals this year) and de
fender James Twellman, who has been voted onto
two all-tourney teams already.
"[The seniors are] a big group of really talented
players," sophomore midfielder Galen Thompson
said. "It all started with them. They just set the bar,
and when the guys at the top are working that hard,
the rest of us follow suit."
The Cardinal also gets a helping hand in the lead
ership department from its one transfer student and
one graduate student, both seasoned veterans from
solid NCAA soccer programs.
Defender Jason Griffiths arrived at Stanford
from Middlebury College in order to obtain a mas
ter's degree in International Education, and will
play out his final year of eligibility with the Cardinal.
Junior midfielder Cooper McKee was actually one of
Stanford's top recruits two years ago. and when he
decided to transfer from St. Louis this season, it gave
Simon another shot at incorporating his talents into
the Cardinal lineup.
"It was just a little bit lucky that we were able to
get these guys," Simon said of the newcomers. "To
have lightning strike twice with two great players is
just wonderful."
As is typical of the Stanford soccer program, the
coaching staff once again managed to recruit one of
the top groups of freshman players in the nation, and
the abilities of the class of 2008 have been apparent
from the beginning. Forward Dan Shapiro and mid
fielder Evan Morgan have both played in three con
tests each — Morgan became the f'rst of the incom
ing class to score a against Jhapiro be
came the second against CSU-Fullerton — while
Mark Bartlett has already started three games on the
back line.
With so much talent on the squad, any success
that Stanford will have comes down to the team's
depth. While injuries left last season's unit vulnera
ble in several positions, this year's team has shown
strength regardless of the health of its starters.

Sophomore goalkeeper Andrew Kartunen is the
most evident example of this, as he and his 0.00
goals-against average were between the posts for the
first five games of the year, while Fulton's injured
hand healed.
The depth has created an ongoing competition for
playing time that seems to be working to the Cardi
nal's advantage.
"It keeps you on your toes because you know that
there's a guy behind you who can do your job,"
Twellman Mid. "And maybe [he] can do i t ."

Conference rivals — made NCAA tourney appear

"We've had a great start," Twellman said. "But if

you ask any player on this team they'll tell you that

goal to hit, considering that 11 of their regular-sea

"We've had a great start," Twellman said. "But if

you ask any player on this team they'll tell you that
we're not even close to our potential. We're very

LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily File
Sophomore midfielder Bret Shimizu is a dangerous offensive force looking to improve on his breakout fresh
man season.
After the Stanford men's soccer team compiled
the program's worst record in over 30 years, the 2003
season was called a shock, an embarrassment, a let
down, a disappointment and a heartbreaker.
But for the Cardinal, 2003 can only be described
one way.
It's over.
Since last season's end in December, the Stanford
squad has undergone a transformation, physically
and mentally, which makes it apparent that 2003's 3-
15-2 team won't be seen anywhere near Maloney
Field this year.
"We all worked very hard — the players, the
coaches — to completely change the team's charac
ter and environment," said Stanford head coach Bret
Simon, who enters his fourth year at the helm of the
soccer squad. "We've made (the team) much more
competitive, more disciplined."
The off-season began with large amounts of
small-group position work and continued with

scrimmages, drills and endless amounts of running.
Everything was aimed at boosting the Cardinal's al
ready-strong talent and work ethic.
"I think to instill confidence in a team that was
shaken (like ours was in 2003], you have to work
hard and prepare them," Simon said. "(They should]
feel like they deserve to win because they've worked
harder than every opponent out there."
Simon's philosophy seems like a sound one. But
does it work?
Maybe the Cardinal's current 5-0-1 record can an
swer that question.
The team traveled to Dallas, Tex. in early
September and opened the 2004 season with a score
less draw at then-No. 17 Tulsa. Stanford next bull
dozed then-No. 11 Southern Methodist 2-0, and did
it all with five players sidelined by injuries. The Car
dinal has since topped San Jose State, San Diego,
UC-Irvine and Cal State Fullerton.
The offense has been doing its job, bringing on
strong attacks and creating scoring opportunities,
while the defense has been a brick wall that has al
lowed just one goal this season.
Yeah, 2003 is definitely over.
The Cardinal transformation has been helped
along by the fact that Stanford lost only three players
to graduation and the MLS draft — midfielder Mike
Wilson and defenders Abe Geiger and Chad Marshall.
The team returns seven seniors who provide a
strong leadership base on and off the pitch. The
group includes goalkeeper and team captain Robby
Fulton and 2003 points leader Matt Janusz, in addi
tion to striker Darren Fernandez (who lays claim to
four of the Cardinal's nine goals this year) and de
fender James Twellman, who has been voted onto
two all-tourney teams already.
"[The seniors are] a big group of really talented
players," sophomore midfielder Galen Thompson
said. "It all started with them. They just set the bar,
and when the guys at the top are working that hard,
the rest of us follow suit."
The Cardinal also gets a helping hand in the lead
ership department from its one transfer student and
one graduate student, both seasoned veterans from
solid NCAA soccer programs.
Defender Jason Griffiths arrived at Stanford
from Middlebury College in order to obtain a mas
ter's degree in International Education, and will
play out his final year of eligibility with the Cardinal.
Junior midfielder Cooper McKee was actually one of
Stanford's top recruits two years ago. and when he
decided to transfer from St. Louis this season, it gave
Simon another shot at incorporating his talents into
the Cardinal lineup.
"It was just a little bit lucky that we were able to
get these guys," Simon said of the newcomers. "To
have lightning strike twice with two great players is
just wonderful."
As is typical of the Stanford soccer program, the
coaching staff once again managed to recruit one of
the top groups of freshman players in the nation, and
the abilities of the class of 2008 have been apparent
from the beginning. Forward Dan Shapiro and mid
fielder Evan Morgan have both played in three con
tests each — Morgan became the f'rst of the incom
ing class to score a against Jhapiro be
came the second against CSU-Fullerton — while
Mark Bartlett has already started three games on the
back line.
With so much talent on the squad, any success
that Stanford will have comes down to the team's
depth. While injuries left last season's unit vulnera
ble in several positions, this year's team has shown
strength regardless of the health of its starters.

Sophomore goalkeeper Andrew Kartunen is the
most evident example of this, as he and his 0.00
goals-against average were between the posts for the
first five games of the year, while Fulton's injured
hand healed.
The depth has created an ongoing competition for
playing time that seems to be working to the Cardi
nal's advantage.
"It keeps you on your toes because you know that
there's a guy behind you who can do your job,"
Twellman Mid. "And maybe [he] can do i t ."
