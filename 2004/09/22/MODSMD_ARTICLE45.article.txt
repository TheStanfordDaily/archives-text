# Women seek seventh straight Tournament berth
## 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's soccer team wrapped up
the Nike Invitational this past weekend, defeating
unranked Yale 1-0 on Sunday afternoon. Senior
Martha West connected with a goal in the 76th
minute of play to give the Cardinal the win. The
squad qualified for the final game of the tournament,
where it defeated Cal State Fullerton 2-0 on Friday
night.
Before hosting the invitational, the No. 20 Cardi
nal (5-2-0) had won two straight road games over Big
XII schools Missouri and Nebraska. The two wins
propelled the Cardinal above .500 and into the na
tional top 25 for the first time since its season open
er against Utah.
Despite the early season success, this year's team
still finds itself under heavy pressure. Last season's
squad finished third in the Pac-10 and was handed an
early exit from the NCAA tournament after losing to
Santa Clara.
"Last season we were extremely disappointed
with the way the season turned out," said junior de-

fender Jenny Farenhaugh. "We definitely expect to
do better this season."
With seven seniors at the helm, this year's squad
has the seasoned veterans that can lead a team to
success. Many of them were members of the historic
2002-03 squad, which posted a 21-2 record and
charged all the way to the quarterfinals in the NCAA
tournament. Their postseason experience should be
of value should the Cardinal qualify for its seventh
straight NCAA Tournament this year.
"The seniors bring hard work and commitment to
the team." Farenbaugh said. "Their attitudes are
contagious, helping our team play at the highest level
possible."

Although the Cardinal has weapons on all sides of
the field, their strongest unit is the defense, which is
tied together by co-captain and filth-year senior
Nicole Barnhart. Barnhart has been the Cardinal's
starting goalkeeper since returning from a season
ending ACL injury in 2002.
Last year, Barnhart racked up 66 saves while al
lowing only 17 goals. She took home First Team All -
Pac-10 honors and finished as a semifinalist for the
Hermann Trophy, collegiate soccer's highest honor.
The Cardinal should also benefit from having two
backup goalies in junior Elizabeth Barnard and
freshman Erica Holland.
Leading the defensive unit in the field are senior
Emilee Shim and juniors Hayley and Lindsey Hunt.
The defense allowed only 167 shots last season and
has held opponents to just three goals in their first
seven games so far this year.
On the offensive side, the Cardinal are excited to
welcome back forward Marcie Ward, who missed the
entire 2003 season with an injury. The co-captain and
fifth-year senior already owns a spot in the Stanford
record books as the school's all-time career assists
leader with 38.
Leading the midfield are senior Amy Grady and
junior Leah Tapscott. Although the Cardinal are
without graduate Allyson Marquand, both Tapscott
and Grady have filled the void, combining for seven
points in the team's first seven games.
The Cardinal has also started the season by play
ing in a 4-4-2 formation, different from last year's 4-
3-3 formation.
Leading the Cardinal from the sidelines is second
year head coach Paul Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe helped the
Cardinal to a 10-9-2 record in his inaugural campaign
after coaching the St. Mary's women's soccer team
for five years. Ratcliffe compiled a 55-34-7 record
during his term with the Gaels, helping them earn
their highest national ranking in school history.
Joining Ratcliffe are returning assistant coach Jay
Cooney and newcomer Sarah Kate Noftsinger.
Noftsinger brings an impressive resume to the Farm, hav
ing played at both the collegiate and professional levels.
"(Noftsinger) has already made a big impact on
the team," said junior defender Hayley Hunt. "She
adds a new perspective to our coaching staff. The
girls all respect her as a coach."
While the Cardinal has struggled to maintain a na
tional Top 25 ranking the past two seasons, that is not
to say that they have not been able to compete with
the nation's best. Last season, the Cardinal held
highly touted Notre Dame and UCLA squads score
less through two double-overtime ties.
The Cardinal already showed similar resilience
this season when they squared off against then-No. 3
Notre Dame in the Notre Dame Tournament. De
spite being handed a 1-0 loss, the Stanford women

gave a gritty performance, holding the Fighting Irish
scoreless for the first SI minutes of play.
"Our team is not getting as caught up in the rank
ings this year." said Hunt. "After last season's drop
from the rankings, we realize that we just need to

take each game one at a time."
I he Cardinal have a tough schedule ahead with
games against St. Mary's. Arizona State and UCLA.
While the expectations are high, this year's squad has
already shown that it can compete with the best.

for five years. Ratcliffe compiled a 55-34-7 record
during his term with the Gaels, helping them earn
their highest national ranking in school history.
Joining Ratcliffe are returning assistant coach Jay
Cooney and newcomer Sarah Kate Noftsinger.
Noftsinger brings an impressive resume to the Farm, hav
ing played at both the collegiate and professional levels.
"(Noftsinger) has already made a big impact on
the team," said junior defender Hayley Hunt. "She
adds a new perspective to our coaching staff. The
girls all respect her as a coach."
While the Cardinal has struggled to maintain a na
tional Top 25 ranking the past two seasons, that is not
to say that they have not been able to compete with
the nation's best. Last season, the Cardinal held
highly touted Notre Dame and UCLA squads score
less through two double-overtime ties.
The Cardinal already showed similar resilience
this season when they squared off against then-No. 3
Notre Dame in the Notre Dame Tournament. De
spite being handed a 1-0 loss, the Stanford women

gave a gritty performance, holding the Fighting Irish
scoreless for the first SI minutes of play.
"Our team is not getting as caught up in the rank
ings this year." said Hunt. "After last season's drop
from the rankings, we realize that we just need to

take each game one at a time."
I he Cardinal have a tough schedule ahead with
games against St. Mary's. Arizona State and UCLA.
While the expectations are high, this year's squad has
already shown that it can compete with the best.

the Bulldogs on Sunday
The Stanford women's soccer team wrapped up
the Nike Invitational this past weekend, defeating
unranked Yale 1-0 on Sunday afternoon. Senior
Martha West connected with a goal in the 76th
minute of play to give the Cardinal the win. The
squad qualified for the final game of the tournament,
where it defeated Cal State Fullerton 2-0 on Friday
night.
Before hosting the invitational, the No. 20 Cardi
nal (5-2-0) had won two straight road games over Big
XII schools Missouri and Nebraska. The two wins
propelled the Cardinal above .500 and into the na
tional top 25 for the first time since its season open
er against Utah.
Despite the early season success, this year's team
still finds itself under heavy pressure. Last season's
squad finished third in the Pac-10 and was handed an
early exit from the NCAA tournament after losing to
Santa Clara.

with the way the season turned out," said junior de-

fender Jenny Farenhaugh. "We definitely expect to
do better this season."
With seven seniors at the helm, this year's squad
has the seasoned veterans that can lead a team to
success. Many of them were members of the historic
2002-03 squad, which posted a 21-2 record and
charged all the way to the quarterfinals in the NCAA
tournament. Their postseason experience should be
of value should the Cardinal qualify for its seventh
straight NCAA Tournament this year.
"The seniors bring hard work and commitment to
the team." Farenbaugh said. "Their attitudes are
contagious, helping our team play at the highest level
possible."

Although the Cardinal has weapons on all sides of
the field, their strongest unit is the defense, which is
tied together by co-captain and filth-year senior
Nicole Barnhart. Barnhart has been the Cardinal's
starting goalkeeper since returning from a season
ending ACL injury in 2002.
Last year, Barnhart racked up 66 saves while al
lowing only 17 goals. She took home First Team All -
Pac-10 honors and finished as a semifinalist for the
Hermann Trophy, collegiate soccer's highest honor.
The Cardinal should also benefit from having two
backup goalies in junior Elizabeth Barnard and
freshman Erica Holland.
Leading the defensive unit in the field are senior
Emilee Shim and juniors Hayley and Lindsey Hunt.
The defense allowed only 167 shots last season and
has held opponents to just three goals in their first
seven games so far this year.
On the offensive side, the Cardinal are excited to
welcome back forward Marcie Ward, who missed the
entire 2003 season with an injury. The co-captain and
fifth-year senior already owns a spot in the Stanford
record books as the school's all-time career assists
leader with 38.
Leading the midfield are senior Amy Grady and
junior Leah Tapscott. Although the Cardinal are
without graduate Allyson Marquand, both Tapscott
and Grady have filled the void, combining for seven
points in the team's first seven games.
The Cardinal has also started the season by play
ing in a 4-4-2 formation, different from last year's 4-
3-3 formation.
Leading the Cardinal from the sidelines is second
year head coach Paul Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe helped the
