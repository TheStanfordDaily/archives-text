# Cross Country to defend pair of NCAA crowns

### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
The 2003 Stanford men's and women's
cross country teams are going to be a tough
act for this year's respective groups to fol
low. For the second time in eight years, the
C ardinal men and women capped domi
nating seasons by capturing NCAA titles
at the NCAA Championships in Waterloo,
lowa last November the first time any
university has won dual men's and
women's national championships in the
same year on two separate occasions.
Is an encore sweep in order? Perhaps.

women the hands-down favorites to de
fend their title. The Stanford women's
team could be one of the most dominant
in school history with all seven runners
who ran to Stanford's second women's
cross country title at NCAAs back in ac
tion this fall.
Bei headlined that group throughout
the season, as she defended her Pac-10 in
dividual title and finished third at NCAAs
to garner All-American honors.
In addition to Bei, fellow senior Alicia
Craig, the premier collegiate long distance
runner in the United States, helps anchor
a distinguished and highly experienced
Stanford squad. The eight-time All-
American finished sixth individually at
NCAAs after winning the NCAA West
Regional meet, where she was named
West Regional Athlete of the Year fora
second consecutive season.
Also back for the eight-time defending
Pac-10 champion Cardinal are seniors
Anita Siraki and Jeanne Golf, both of
whom have competed at NCAAs the past
two seasons. Sophomore Arianna Lambie.
the 2003 Pac-10 Cross Country Newcomer
of the Year, will look to build on her daz
zling freshman campaign. Lambie placed
third at Pac-10 Championships and 24th
overall at NCAAs. She was even more im
pressive in the spring, clocking the sev
enth fastest time in Pac-10 history in the
1500 meters (4:13.14) for the women's
track team.
Two of the Cardinal's impressive fresh
men, Shannon Bergstedt and Lindsay
Flacks, offered a preview of good things to
come with strong showings at last week
end's season-opening USF Invitational.
Bergstedt placed third in 17:21.4 and
Flacks, who was the California state two
mile champion during a decorated career
at Harvard-Westlake, placed fourth in
17:21.7.
Siraki won the 5,000-meter event in
17:20.8, crossing the line just ahead of

teammate Katy Trotter (17:21.1). Stan
lord run away with the team victory with
15 points. UCLA placed second in the ten
team event with 53 points. While both
were healthy, Bei and Craig did not com
pete in the meet.
By contrast to the familiar look of the
women's team, the men said goodbye to
Grant Robison, lan Dobson, Louis Luchi
ni, Adam Tenforde and Donald Sage, who
finished fourth, fifth, sixth, 12th and 13th,
respectively, at NCAAs last season.
But the cupboard is hardly bare for Ger
ard, and the Cardinal's hopes for another
title start with Hall, a senior, who placed
second at NCAAs and is a serious con
tender to win the individual title this year.
Senior Chris Emme will help provide
necessary veteran leadership in addition
to fast times. Emme placed in the top
seven at the Pac-10 and NCAA West Re
gional Championships last season.
The men got off to a strong start at the
USF Invitational as well, claiming eight of
the top 10 spots, including the first six.
Meindl took home first-place honors with
a time of 23.29.2, crossing the line ahead of
teammates Jacob Gomez (23:34.0), Jon
Pierce (23:41.4). Forrest Tahdooahnippah
(24:05.3), Roll Steier (24:09.9) and Steven
DeWill (24:1 1.1).
Redshirt freshmen Lauren Jespersen
placed eighth, senior Evan Fox finished
10th and redshirt junior Justin Romaniuk
placed 12th. Stanford returns to action
this Saturday when it co-hosts the 2004
Stanford Cross Country Invitational along
with Palo Alto High School.
The 31st running of the event will draw
3,000 collegiate and high school runners
from around the country and will be held
at the Stanford Golf Course.
The Stanford men took the top five po
sitions at last year's Invite to claim the
team title while the women finished sec
ond behind UCLA. Gates open at 8:30

Anita Siraki and Jeanne Golf, both of
whom have competed at NCAAs the past
two seasons. Sophomore Arianna Lambie.
the 2003 Pac-10 Cross Country Newcomer
of the Year, will look to build on her daz

third at Pac-10 Championships and 24th
overall at NCAAs. She was even more im
pressive in the spring, clocking the sev
enth fastest time in Pac-10 history in the
1500 meters (4:13.14) for the women's
track team.
Two of the Cardinal's impressive fresh
men, Shannon Bergstedt and Lindsay
Flacks, offered a preview of good things to
come with strong showings at last week
end's season-opening USF Invitational.
Bergstedt placed third in 17:21.4 and
Flacks, who was the California state two
mile champion during a decorated career
at Harvard-Westlake, placed fourth in
17:21.7.
Siraki won the 5,000-meter event in
17:20.8, crossing the line just ahead of

teammate Katy Trotter (17:21.1). Stan
lord run away with the team victory with
15 points. UCLA placed second in the ten
team event with 53 points. While both
were healthy, Bei and Craig did not com
pete in the meet.
By contrast to the familiar look of the
women's team, the men said goodbye to
Grant Robison, lan Dobson, Louis Luchi
ni, Adam Tenforde and Donald Sage, who
finished fourth, fifth, sixth, 12th and 13th,
respectively, at NCAAs last season.
But the cupboard is hardly bare for Ger

title start with Hall, a senior, who placed
second at NCAAs and is a serious con
tender to win the individual title this year.
Senior Chris Emme will help provide
necessary veteran leadership in addition
to fast times. Emme placed in the top
seven at the Pac-10 and NCAA West Re
gional Championships last season.
The men got off to a strong start at the
USF Invitational as well, claiming eight of
the top 10 spots, including the first six.
Meindl took home first-place honors with
