# Men's and women's golf swing away

### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's golf team may be
one of the Farm's most pleasant athletic
surprises this year. At the end of last year,
that statement would have seemed rather
far-fetched.
After all, the Cardinal were coming off
their third consecutive year of failing to
qualify for the NCAA Championship. In
fact, the program has qualified for the na
tional competition only once since Tiger
Woods last called Stanford his home
course.
A poor postseason performance was fol
lowed by personnel turnover, both among
the players and the coaching staff. Sopho
more Brandon Lawson, who played in nine
events during his freshman campaign, will
not return to the team this fall.
On June 3, as UCLA was taking a lead in
the NCAA Championship in Virginia, head
coach Jeff Mitchell was thanking the Stan
ford athletic department for the chance to
coach the Cardinal and announcing his in
tention to seek other opportunities.
Yet. with the team seemingly in disar
ray, Stanford enters the season with rea
sons for optimism. Mitchell, a veteran of
the college coaching world, was replaced
by Conrad Ray, a coaching rookie and
alumnus of Stanford's 1994 NCAA Cham
pionship team.
Of Stanford's six individual top-10 fin
ishes last year, last year's MVP Zack Miller
accounted for all but one. He almost be
came the first Stanford freshman to win a
tournament since Woods in 1995, when he
finished second at the Prestige in Novem
ber. That performance began a streak of
five straight events in which Miller recorded
a top-10 finish.
In the team's first action of the year,
the Gold Rush in Calimesa, Calif., fresh
men Teddy Collins and Rob Grube im
mediately showed their mettle. At five
under par, Grube led the team with a
fifth-place finish in his first collegiate
event. Collins also held up well, compil
ing a two-over-par total over two days
and tying for 29th place individually.
Perhaps the biggest surprise for Stanford
at the Gold Rush was the play of junior Scott
Mac Donald. After participating in just eight
events in his first two years, Mac Donald was
still looking for Ins first career top-25 finish
coming into the fall, until he managed an
eighth-place finish in Calimesa.
The team's second-place finish at the

The Bottom Line: With few additions
to either team, both squads should use
experience to their advantage and im
prove on last year's results.

Gold Rush last weekend was the best since
2002, and the team will look to build on its
early success at the Windon Memorial in
two weeks.
Meanwhile, on the women's side, new
laces and a fresh perspective may mean the
beginning of a brighter chapter for Stanford
golf fans.
For the last few years, the No. 9 Stan
ford women's golf team (Golfweek mag
azine preseason rankings) has benefitted
from veteran leadership in the form of
multiple seniors in each starting lineup.
This year, youth will be the new order
for the Cardinal. With the departure of
senior standouts Kim Kouwabunpat and
Angic Rho, coach Caroline O'Connor
and senior Wendra Liang are the only
members of the team with more than two
years of experience under their belts.
In addition to being young, this year's
team will also be quite small â€” slightly
less than 5'4" on average, to be exact.
More importantly, the women's squad will
consist of just six players. Since the Cardi
nal are required to send five players to
each regular-season tournament, sopho
more Jenna Seki and junior Kelly Hustcd
(six events combined last year) will most
likely be pressed to play a larger role than
either has in the past.

In addition to No. 1 UCLA, five other
teams from the Pac-10 find themselves in
the top 20 of Golfweek's pre-season rank
ings, including California. Arizona, Ari
zona State. Southern California and Wash
ington. The road through the regular season
and Pac-10 tournament, in short, will be a
tough one.
On a team that might lack veteran
leadership, coach O'Connor will provide
a steadying influence. Beginning her
ninth season at Stanford, O'Connor has
consistently led her teams to success on
the largest stages. Last year's team, with
out the aid of any player ranked higher
than 71st in the country, finished in 12th
place at the NCAA Championship, best
ing stronger teams from the regular sea
son. such as No. 6 New Mexico and No. 10
Arizona.
As for the rest of the team, it's just an
other day at the office. No player will par
ticipate in her first collegiate tournament
this year, and each one. save Jenna Seki.
who saw action in just two events, notched
at least one top-25 finish a year ago.
Perhaps all of this explains why they're
ranked No. 19.
Perhaps this is why they don't seem scared.
Perhaps this is why the rest of the Pac-10
should be.
