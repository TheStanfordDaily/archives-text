# Young Cardinal field hockey squad up to Pac-10 challenge: Beat Cal
## 
### MIA ASHTON DESK EDITOR 
This year, the Stanford field hockey
team (5-4) is full of surprises. The team's
roster includes just 15 people fora sport
that demands 11 field players at a time —
players who will he competing against
schools with at least five more on their
benches. The Cardinal's roster also in
cludes only one senior, forcing a strong
group of underclassmen to take the reins.
And the squad has already upset previ
ously unbeaten Northwestern (4-3) 1-0 on
Sept. 8 before defeating lowa (2-4) on Sept.
10 in a 5-1 slam.

The Bottom Line: Though strong for
their youth and size, the Cardinal will
likely fall from playoff contention if
injuries occur.

Sole senior Eleanor Morgan says her
team's early success is due to a combination
of skill and intensity that is a marked im
provement from last year.
"I think everyone's presence on the
field is way stronger," Morgan said. "Peo
ple have gained a lot of confidence since
last spring."
The youth of the team, in particular, cer
tainly has. Sophomores Liz Robinson and
Katherine Brooks combined for three
goals against the Hawkeyes. Junior Missy
Halliday tallied one.
Morgan proved why she is a team cap
tain by adding a goal and two assists, and
explained that coming up with such a team
effort for the win is one of the Cardinal's
strengths. She noted especially the play of
younger team members like Robinson and

Brooks who have risen to the challenge this
season.
"We had a bunch of freshmen starting last
year and now they're much more confident in
their skills," Morgan said. "It's pretty incred
ible that they're stepping up as sophomores
— that's inspiring to everyone else."
Robinson took the team lead in points
with seven after her pair of goals against
lowa. She also credited a team mentality
with her success.
"The passes up front have really been
connecting well lately, and that has created
many scoring opportunities for our of
fense," Robinson said. "We've been work
ing on taking more shots in the circle, and it
seems like that is paying off."
Eleanor also noted the team's offensive
movement.
"We were passing really well," she said.
"We have a pretty simple game — a passing
game. We're a pretty fast team this year so
when we have our passing game combined
with intensity, it ends up working out well."
It also ended up working out well against
Drexel (3-3) —who Stanford defeated on
Sept. 14 off a remarkable assist combination
that involved four players — and Provi
dence (2-5), who the Cardinal came from
behind to beat, 3-2. The Cardinal also beat
Louisville before going on to wins over
Northwestern and lowa, giving Stanford a
three-game win streak on the road.
"Winning three games in a row and
beating a team like lowa, especially on the
road, is huge for our program," said head
coach Lesley Irvine. "Our team has a lot of
potential and is starting to believe in itself."
Morgan agrees, citing the team's roster
size as a reason.
"I think we've gelled much more easily
this year because our team is so small. It al
lows for us to be much closer, but it's a seri
ous challenge in terms of endurance."
Even so. with a strong running and pass
ing game and exceptional output from
players with only one year of college expe
rience, Morgan is already looking forward
to the rest of the season.
"The goal is to make it to NCAAs and
win our conference, meaning beat Cal.'"
