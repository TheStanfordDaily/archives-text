# Res Ed orders Row dry for week
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY DESK EDITOR 
It is typical for many upperclassmen to celebrate their
return to campus by reuniting with their friends over
rounds of quarters or beer pong in dorm lounges.
But this year, students living on the Row cannot
check into their residences unless they sign a document
that prohibits them from "hosting any formal or infor
mal house gathering where alcohol is served or provid
ing alcohol to any new student."
Violating the New Student Orientation alcohol poli
cy can lead to "the loss of housing privileges and put at
risk the social host privileges for my house."
Upon hearing of the policy during a Row staff retreat,
a group of 21 resident advisors sent a letter last Thursday
addressed to Director of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo to protest the manner in which the NSO alco
hol policy is being enforced. University President John
Hennessy and The Daily also received copies.
The RAs argued that the policy unfairly "shifts the
burden" of accountability from freshmen and onto up
perclassmen living on the Row.
"As RAs. we are frustrated by the prospect that our
first responsibility will be to enforce a poorly drawn pol
icy sure to alienate our residents. Further, we don't rel
ish our potential role as temperance police for the fresh
man class," they wrote.
They suggested closing upper-class houses to fresh
men and instituting a freshman curfew as two alternative

solutions to the problem of drinking during Orientation.
Camarillo issued a written response to the RAs de
fending the new policy while offering to include student
staff in future discussions related to the University's al
cohol policy. She cited, as examples of the dangers of
abusive drinking, the recent death of a Colorado State
freshman by alcohol poisoning and an incident at Stan
ford last week involving an inebriated upperclassman
who fell 12 feet from a railing.
"Abusive use of alcohol is a fact on college campuses
and our charge is to restore safer environments by dis
couraging in every possible way abusive or illegal drink
ing," she wrote.
Her letter did not address specifically the contention
made by the RAs that the policy would force upper
classmen to drink in less well-monitored environments
during Orientation week, such as in their rooms.
"A certain fraction of students want to drink when
they come back," said Sigma Alpha Epsilon RA Luppe
Luppen. "This policy will not stop them, it is just going to
move them to different places."
Nonetheless, Luppen and other RAs believe their
stance on freshman drinking is actually very close to that
of Residential Education.
"We agree that freshmen are in a difficult position
during the first week because it is a new environment,
and that they will have a diminished ability to drink a re
sponsible amount," Luppen said. "We just think that
what they're doing is shifting the primary responsibility
for this onto residents of the Row, and that's unfair."
