### KAIYA REEVE STAFF WRITER 
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for some
top-notch men's tennis action this year.
The season hasn't started yet. but already
some members the Stanford men's tennis team
are near the top of the rankings.
Senior standout Sam Warburg garnered a
No. 2 singles ranking in the Intercollegiate Ten
nis Association preseason polls, gathering 1035
votes. C'atalin Gard of Mississippi barely edged
him out, gathering 1044 votes to grab the No. 1
ranking.
The No. 2 ranking is the highest Warburg has
been awarded in the collegiate tennis circuit, but
he's not getting too worked up about it just yet.

Men's Tennis Quick Facts
Coach: John Whitlinger (Ist yr.)
Current Rank: N/A
Current Record: N/A
2003 Record: 19-8
2003 NCAA Tournament: lost to USC in
quarterfinals, 4-0
Players to Watch: junior KC Corkery, se
nior Sam Warburg
The Bottom Line: With so many return
ers and a still-strong coaching staff, the
squad will likely remain among the best
in the NCAA.

"It's exciting, but it doesn't mean anything at
this point," Warburg said.
To prepare for the upcoming season. War
burg and many other players have been compet
ing in various tournaments around the country.
"I've played in six singles tournaments and
doubles in several of those," Warburg said. He
has also won a singles event in Decatur, 111., the
Decatur Futures, a $10,(MX) entry level event.
Warburg will enter the season as a huge
power hitter for Stanford, after walking away
from the 2003-2004 season with such accolades
as 2004 Pac-10 Player of the Year and 2004 Pac

10 Singles Champion.
Riding the wave of success with Warburg is
junior KC Corkery, ranked No. 20. The Cardi
nal tandem had a whirlwind year last season and
blazed its way to a NCAA Doubles Champi
onship victory.
After taking home the NCAA trophy, Cork
ery / Warburg played in the main draw of one
of the most prestigious tournaments in the
country â€” the U.S. Open.
"We lost in the first round but we played pret
ty well. We weren't that far off," Warburg said.
Corkery / Warburg will kick off the 2003-
2004 season with a No. 1 doubles preseason
ranking, the highest ranking either player has
achieved.
Tennis fans, players and coaches alike will
also be keeping their eyes open for sophomore
James Wan, who was dubbed the 2004 Pac-10
Co-Newcomer of the Year and received a 2004
AII-Pac-10 Honorable Mention award. During
the 2003-2004 season, Wan reached a 22-0 dual
match win streak, and he will be a driving force
for the team this year.
Look for solid play from senior Phil
Sheng. who has shown great consistency in
the past seasons.
Stanford will welcome one new player to the
team, freshman Philip Kao.
"Phil Kao was Nor Cat's number one player
this year, and he was a great high school player,"
head coach John Whitlingersaid. "Hedidn't play
a ton of tennis this summer but in previous sum
mers he's done very well on a national level."
One of the biggest changes in the team this
year is the shuffling of the coaching staff positions.
Last year's associate head coach Whitlinger
will take the reins of the program after former
head coach Dick Gould assumed the role of Di
rector of Tennis at Stanford.
The Farm will also greet newcomer David
Hodge as he steps into the position of top assis
tant to Whitlinger. Hodge joins the Farm after
acting as the top assistant and recruiting coordi
nator at the University of Colorado.
The Cardinal have three major tournaments
to look forward to this fall before the dual match
season starts during winter quarter.
