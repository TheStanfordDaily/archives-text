# Women's tennis begins title defense following championship season
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
After closing out a fairytale
season (29-0) with an NCAA
Championship victory over Pacif
ic-10 Conference challenger
UCLA, the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team is riding
high as it begins the new year.
It's not enough to consider that
the Cardinal boast a record 13
NCAA titles, ahead by leaps and
bounds of the second-place finish
er. Florida, with four.
It's not enough to consider
sophomore Theresa Logar's
formidable first-year run. No. 26
Logar stormed through the regu
lar season untouched, clinched her
first individual title in January at
the Freeman Memorial Champi
onships in Las Vegas, and is set to
move up from her No. 5 singles slot
this year.
Throw in junior Alice Barnes'
being named Most Valuable Play
er at NCAA's, top-ranked junior
Amber Liu claiming the NCAA
Singles title for the second time in
as many years, and the No. 1 dou
bles team of senior Erin Burdette
and recent graduate Lauren
Barnikow (32-3) being named
ITA National Doubles Team of
the Year.
We're getting closer still, but
it's not enough.
Evoking Stanford's presence
in the college tennis circuit is like
being up a break in the second set:
The crowd never wants a sweet
and simple closeout victory, it
only wants more, more, more.
Speaking of the phenomenal
Liu, speculation abounds yet
again about her future on the
Farm. Last year, Liu took time
off in the fall to compete in satel
lite-level professional tourna
ments, only to return as the No. 1
force on the squad.
Weathering the ups and downs
of the regular season (23-4) as
well as the pressure to be a flaw
less No. 1, Liu worked tirelessly to
improve the consistency of her al
ready rock-solid game.
Liu's efforts paid dividends in
the NCAA Singles Champi
onship, where she dispatched
Fresno State's No. 3 Jelena
Pandzic (29-2) in a rough-and
tumble three sets, 6-4, 0-6, 6-3.
Pandzic, now a sophomore,
had handed Liu a straight-set loss
earlier in March, 6-2, 6-2.
Liu's poise, maturity, and con
sistent results also earned her the
Honda Award in June, an honor

bestowed on the top female ath
lete across 12 sports.
The 2004-05 lineup has yet to be
released, but if last year's results
are any indicator. No. 6 Barnes is
on track to repeat her success in
the No. 2 singles slot.
Barnes had just one blemish on
her regular season record, suffer
ing a straight-set loss to Southern
California's Carine Vermeulen,
6-2, 6-2.
Still, it would be unfair to place
Barnes in Liu's shadow; her close
results against top-notch com
petitors such as Pandzic and Cali
fornia's recently graduated
Raquel Kops-Jones are a testimo
ny to her quietly consistent career
which centers around her touch
game. frustratingly on-the-mark
slice backhand, and her unending
modesty.
Adding to the singles lineup is
senior Erin Burdette (23-5). The
5' 11" powerhouse is looking to
overpower competitors with her
serve, which strikes fear in the
hearts of many opponents as it
whizzes by.
With two seniors gone, two
spots on the singles roster are up
for grabs. Well in contention for
them are sophomore Anne
Yelsey, who acclimated to Stan
ford women's tennis at No. 3 dou
bles with now-graduated Emilia
Anderson, and incoming fresh
man Whitney Deason.
Deason is one of the top ju
niors in the country and the 2001
Orange Bowl champion (think:
the US Open of the junior cir
cuit). Seeded at No. 16 in the tour
nament. she made quick work of
second seed Delia Sesioreanu, 6-
3, 6-3.
Waiting in the Cardinal wings
are reserve players Joanna Kao
and Jessica Leek, both juniors.
Kao had solid results last year,
winning in straight sets in the No.
5 singles slot against Hawaii's Re
nata Camargo.
Kao also reached the semifi
nals of the invitational bracket at
the Pac-10 Individual Tourna
ment, where she fell to teammate
Yelsey, 6-2, 6-1.
Leek, however, posted a losing
1-8 record. The future is cloudier
still for senior reserve player Kara
Guzman, who suffered repeated
shoulder injuries last year.
The Cardinal will have plenty
of time this fall to solidify in body
and spirit. Heading its agenda are
next month's ITA Invitational
and the Farm's own ITA North
west Regional Championships.

serve, which strikes fear in the
hearts of many opponents as it
whizzes by.
With two seniors gone, two
spots on the singles roster are up
for grabs. Well in contention for
them are sophomore Anne
Yelsey, who acclimated to Stan
ford women's tennis at No. 3 dou
bles with now-graduated Emilia
Anderson, and incoming fresh
man Whitney Deason.
Deason is one of the top ju
niors in the country and the 2001
Orange Bowl champion (think:
the US Open of the junior cir
cuit). Seeded at No. 16 in the tour
nament. she made quick work of
second seed Delia Sesioreanu, 6-
3, 6-3.
Waiting in the Cardinal wings
are reserve players Joanna Kao
and Jessica Leek, both juniors.
Kao had solid results last year,
winning in straight sets in the No.
5 singles slot against Hawaii's Re
nata Camargo.
Kao also reached the semifi
nals of the invitational bracket at
the Pac-10 Individual Tourna
ment, where she fell to teammate
Yelsey, 6-2, 6-1.
Leek, however, posted a losing
1-8 record. The future is cloudier
still for senior reserve player Kara
Guzman, who suffered repeated
shoulder injuries last year.
The Cardinal will have plenty
of time this fall to solidify in body
and spirit. Heading its agenda are
next month's ITA Invitational
and the Farm's own ITA North
west Regional Championships.

The Bottom Line: The Cardinal's opponents should probably pre
pare themselves to be completely vanquished.


GRANT HOCHSTEIN/ The Stanford Daily File
Sophomore Anne Yelsey prepares a return shot. Yelsey advanced to the
semifinals of the ITA Northwestern Regional Championship as a freshman.
After closing out a fairytale
season (29-0) with an NCAA
Championship victory over Pacif
ic-10 Conference challenger
UCLA, the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team is riding
high as it begins the new year.
It's not enough to consider that
the Cardinal boast a record 13
NCAA titles, ahead by leaps and
bounds of the second-place finish
er. Florida, with four.
It's not enough to consider
sophomore Theresa Logar's
formidable first-year run. No. 26
Logar stormed through the regu
lar season untouched, clinched her
first individual title in January at
the Freeman Memorial Champi
onships in Las Vegas, and is set to
move up from her No. 5 singles slot
this year.
Throw in junior Alice Barnes'
being named Most Valuable Play
er at NCAA's, top-ranked junior
Amber Liu claiming the NCAA
Singles title for the second time in
as many years, and the No. 1 dou
bles team of senior Erin Burdette
and recent graduate Lauren
Barnikow (32-3) being named
ITA National Doubles Team of
the Year.
We're getting closer still, but
it's not enough.
Evoking Stanford's presence
in the college tennis circuit is like
being up a break in the second set:
The crowd never wants a sweet
and simple closeout victory, it
only wants more, more, more.
Speaking of the phenomenal
Liu, speculation abounds yet
again about her future on the
Farm. Last year, Liu took time
off in the fall to compete in satel
lite-level professional tourna
ments, only to return as the No. 1
force on the squad.
Weathering the ups and downs
of the regular season (23-4) as
well as the pressure to be a flaw
less No. 1, Liu worked tirelessly to
improve the consistency of her al
ready rock-solid game.
Liu's efforts paid dividends in
the NCAA Singles Champi
onship, where she dispatched
Fresno State's No. 3 Jelena
Pandzic (29-2) in a rough-and
tumble three sets, 6-4, 0-6, 6-3.
Pandzic, now a sophomore,
had handed Liu a straight-set loss
earlier in March, 6-2, 6-2.
Liu's poise, maturity, and con
sistent results also earned her the
Honda Award in June, an honor

bestowed on the top female ath
lete across 12 sports.
The 2004-05 lineup has yet to be
released, but if last year's results
are any indicator. No. 6 Barnes is
on track to repeat her success in
the No. 2 singles slot.
Barnes had just one blemish on
her regular season record, suffer
ing a straight-set loss to Southern
California's Carine Vermeulen,
6-2, 6-2.
Still, it would be unfair to place
Barnes in Liu's shadow; her close
results against top-notch com
petitors such as Pandzic and Cali
fornia's recently graduated
Raquel Kops-Jones are a testimo
ny to her quietly consistent career
which centers around her touch
game. frustratingly on-the-mark
slice backhand, and her unending
modesty.
Adding to the singles lineup is
senior Erin Burdette (23-5). The
5' 11" powerhouse is looking to
overpower competitors with her
serve, which strikes fear in the
hearts of many opponents as it
whizzes by.
With two seniors gone, two
spots on the singles roster are up
for grabs. Well in contention for
