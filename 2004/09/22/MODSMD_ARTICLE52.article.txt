## Campus Life Familiar faces Frosh forge friendships in Cyberspace Class of 2008 utilizes online directories to meet fellow classmates 
### DAVID HERBERT DESK EDITOR 
Felicia Yiu has already used Theface
book.com, the popular social networking
Web site, to sell concert tickets and make
new acquaintances. She had 18 friends at
Stanford as of Sept. 20. And that was be
fore she had even arrived on campus for
Orientation.
Yiu is one of 981 incoming freshmen who
joined Thefacebook before they had moved
into the dorms, tasted dining hall food or
heard the shrill cries of "oh-eight!" from
frenzied Orientation Volunteers.
"My friends from high school kept telling
me to sign up," said Yiu, who will live in
Serra this year.
She said the site has already come in
handy. Stuck with several tickets to a Pixies
concert, she used the Web site's search fea
ture to find other Stanford students who
shared an interest in the band, eventually
selling the tickets and making a few contacts
in the process.
Her 18 Stanford friends online are a col
lection of high school classmates, students
she met at a Stanford alumni party in the
East Bay and acquaintances from her recent
ticket experience.
Other freshman have been using The
facebook's search feature to find their dorm
mates. Larkin residents Nila Bala and
Kristin Hughes contacted each other
through the Web site and exchanged e-mails
over the summer. On move-in day, Bala was
pleasantly surprised to learn that Hughes
lives across the hall.
"It was easier coming to Stanford know
ing I knew a name and a face," she said.
Besides being a social networking tool,
many students have also come to view The
facebook as a contest to see who can have
the most "friends." With students racking up
dozens and even hundreds of friends (one re
cent graduate clocked in at 764), some are
beginning to wonder what the true nature of
Thefacebook friendship is.
"You're not going to meet lifelong friends
online," said freshman Andrew Burmon. "I
have no frickin' idea (how many friends I
have)," he added, noting that he has received
friendship requests from Stanford students
he hardly knows. Having accepted all of
those requests, Burmon has 21 friends.
As Thefacebook's membership rolls
grow daily, some are concerned that the pro
gram may have unintended drawbacks for
incoming freshmen.
"I think a lot of people are prone to think

ing stereotypically," said junior Melissa Luu-
Van, a resident assistant in Larkin, where 59
of the 100 freshman residents are registered
on Thefacebook. "If someone's picture
looks 'gothy,' people may think he or she is a
'goth.'"
Thefacebook is not the first online com
munity for Stanford freshmen. Yahoo
groups spring up every year after early ac
ceptance letters are mailed out in December.
These e-mail lists allow accepted students to
contact each other over the Internet, often
attracting hundreds of members.
What separates Thefacebook is the vast
amount of personal information that is
shared, including photographs, likes and dis
likes, and political views.
"Thefacebook is a bad thing," said Josh
Seifert, another Larkin RA. "We start form
ing images of residents, which is against the
Stanford philosophy of everyone starting off
on an equal footing."
In one case, a queer staff member in a

freshman dorm was reading the profile of
one of his incoming freshman residents and
was disturbed to find bigoted sexual refer
ences throughout.
"When you read homophobic com
ments from residents, it singles that person
out as someone you don't want to interact
with," said the staff member, who asked
not to be named. "That's not fair to [the
freshman]."
Benefiting from word of mouth and
plenty of free publicity, Thefacebook al
ready claims more than 250,000 members
at nearly 100 colleges nationwide, less than
a year after its inception. Enthusiasm for
the Web site at Stanford, which was among
the first schools to have access to Theface
book last winter, shows no signs of dissi
pating. with nearly two-thirds of incoming
freshmen and upwards of 75 percent of
sophomores using the service.
"I joined Thefacebook to have a distrac
tion from chemistry, but it can be useful

when you're trying to put names to faces,"
said sophomore Megan Watkins, who added
that the Web site is also a handy tool for
would-be matchmakers.
For some, that potential use can be a
headache.
"I had to change my profile to say 'In a
Relationship' after a sketchy guy in Naranja
'poked' me," said a senior female, who re
quested that her name be withheld.
The online program has even begun to in
fluence the way students speak, with the
slang term "to facebook," meaning to track
down and analyze an acquaintance's online
profile, entering common vernacular.
At least one staff member is assuming
that the Web site is here to stay. Senior
Kasey Alderete, an RAin Larkin, started
the group "Larkin 04-05" on the Web site in
an effort to keep Larkin residents in touch
when the year ends. Then, of course, the
question becomes whether those people will
want to stay in contact offline.

The birth of a campus craze
Thefacebook.com was first made
available to Stanford students on Feb.
26 of this year. Modeled after social net
working Web sites such as
Friendster.com and Xanga.com, The
facebook allows students to connect to
fellow Stanford students, as well as
friends at colleges across the nation.
Harvard University sophomore
Mark Zuckerberg first coded the site for
students at his school after he grew tired
of waiting for his university's adminis
tration to fulfill its promise of making an
online facebook. Zuckerberg's creation
was launched at Harvard on Feb. 6, and
access was extended to Columbia, Yale
and Stanford by the end of the month.
Within two weeks of the site's launch at
Stanford, almost 3,000 students had
signed up.
