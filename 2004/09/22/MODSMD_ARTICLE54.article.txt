# The
						countdown to Orientation: Behind the scenes
## 
### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three things are bound to happen this
week: New students will wander around
campus and wonder why Building 10 is
next to Building 240 in the Quad.
Freshmen will be impressed by their dorm
staff s mastery of their names and faces.
And members of the class of 2QOB will
be told they are, without a doubt, the best
and brightest Stanford has ever admitted.
Such are memories of Orientation
Week that all Stanford students carry
with them throughout their time on the
Farm. Little do they do know that their
welcome to the University was the cul
mination of a year's worth of effort by
the New Student Orientation staff.
Others had a handful, too. Resident
Advisors decorated dorm lounges and
practiced dorm chants. Hundreds of cur
rent Stanford students volunteered to greet
the frosh and their families on Palm Drive,
Campus Drive and throughout campus.
Below, we offer a glimpse of how key in

dividuals and groups prepared for this week.
New Student Orientation director
According to NSO Director Jared Scher
er, his office coordinates approximately 200
events that involve over 75 academic and
athletic departments. All are aimed at en
abling the newest class of Farmers to take
advantage of Stanford's resources.
The office hired over 150 student
volunteers and four full-time student
employees over the summer.
Scherer has been working with NSO
for four years and oversees the staff, as
well as the planning and execution of all
orientation activities. His staff is re
sponsible for reserving rooms for panel
events, blowing up balloons, painting
signs and hanging banners.
"I hope they walk away from NSO
saying that 4 I feel at home' and 'I'm
ready to take on everything Stanford has
to offer,' " Scherer said. "I also want stu
dents to say, T know I made the perfect
decision in coming to Stanford.' "

Dean of freshman and transfer students
Julie Lythcott-Haims, dean of fresh
men and transfer students, addressed the
newcomers yesterday morning at Memo
rial Auditorium as part of the "Discover
Stanford" orientation event. She has also
been busy these past few days, doing
much more than just practicing saying
"Oh-Eight."
Lythcott-Haims is responsible for
overseeing the transition of freshman
and transfer students into university life.
Throughout their first year, new stu
dents can seek her office fora number of
advising and tutoring resources.
"The goal of Orientation is to intro
duce our newest undergraduates to the
intellectual life, diversity, history and
traditions that epitomize the Stanford
undergraduate experience, and to
begin establishing community in the
residences," Lythcott-Haims said.
"Hopefully we manage to give them a
sense of their place in the Stanford
family as well."

Lythcott-Haims still fondly remembers
her own orientation at Stanford 19 years ago.
"My two favorite memories from my
own freshman orientation are when the
Band jumped into the pool and began
playing, and when the RAs shouted out
my name," she recalled.
Orientation volunteers
Among the first people the new stu
dents encountered as they arrived Mon
day morning to move into their resi
dences were NSO's student volunteers.
According to Sung-Woo Cho, Class of
2004, the Head Orientation Coordinator,
the volunteers are essential to a success
ful orientation. When he began his job
early last spring, he spent much of his
time recruiting the volunteers.
During the summer, Cho worked
full-time for NSO and shifted his atten
tion to planning the orientation events
with the three other orientation coordi-
