# Hip hangouts: Because sometimes the Treehouse isn't enough
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As a freshman, one of the greatest fictions is the notion
that freshmen never get off campus. The truth is that the ab
sence of cars makes this the perfect time to begin what will
certainly he a life-long experiment with public transportation
and procrastination.
Not only will you ride the Caltrain in your comfy Stan
ford sweatshirt, but you will also spend hours — nay,
days — puttering around San Francisco and Berkeley,
trying to forget about the undigested entrails of the I-
Hum or SLE papers you will give yourTA the next morn
ing. But hey. if a visit to a hookah joint helps you choose
a major, who cares?
Palo Alto hangouts
University Avenue is U>o obvious a locale to include in
this subtle dissection of Bay Area hangouts — so we will skip
it in favor of locations you are less likely to stumble upon.
To begin with, try out Tea Time, a quaint shop with over
20 varieties of tea (including Cocoa Chai) and an average
client age of 70 that you can lower with your unique presence.
The Dutch Goose in Menlo Park, meanwhile, provides
relief from Palo Alto's sterility with its peanut-covered floor,
cheap beer and super deviled eggs.
On the other end of the spectrum, there's Menlo Park's
Cafe Borrone with its sunny terrace and relaxed yuppiness,
andQ-Cupon University Avenue, which is one of Stanford's
newest pearl nulk tea venues. Gelato Classico is the spot for
icy Italian treats.

Entertainment
If the Marguerite isn't your idea of smooth lane-cruis
ing. hit up Palo Alto Bowl, only a couple of miles from cam
pus. Since Stanford's last real party was back in 1891, the
Saturday night disco set-up — complete with smoke, mir
rors and music — will be a welcome escape from your
monochrome existence.
Not satisfied with the spastic fooz-ball players in your
lounge? Dig out your fake ID and visit Dave and Busters, de
scribed rather alarmingly as "Chuck E. Cheese for adults" by
one e-zine. Get into a batting cage, feed your NRA fantasies
in the shinning gallery and knock around some pool balls.
Q-Zar Laser Tag in RedwtxxJ City is the perfect place to in
vite that arrogant kid from I-Hum ;uid shoot his virtiuil brains out.
Further, if you wish to putt a safe distance away from Stan
ford's club-wielding graduate students, try Sunnyvale's
Golfland USA. This mini-golf venue is home to such famous
holes as Wonky Castle and Requisite Windmill and boasts
two mid-level courses.
San Francisco
Your dorm scavenger hunt, run by highly conservative
RAs, will take you to Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square,
North Beach, China Town, the Metreon and Big Al'sSexShc>p.
For anyone new to the city, however, there is no place
more fascinating than Haight-Ashbury. Full of egregiously
expensive hipster hangouts posing as thrift stores and pot
heads posing as potheads, this street succeeds in retaining its
60s hippie vibe.
Browse the awesome book shops, camp out in the huge

music stores and check out the wide range of eateries. Kan
zaman. an Arabian restaurant with flavored hookahs and
friendly belly-dancers, is highly recommended.
Other districts worthy of a stroll are the Mission, famous
for its dirt-cheap shops and gigantic Hispanic murals, and the
Castro, the hub of the rainbow movement in S.F. and a great
introduction to this city's unique culture (one shop is named,
rather characteristically: "Does Your Father Know?")
And if all this urban excitement makes you yearn for the
rural environs of Stanford, amble through The Golden Gate
Park's fabulous Botanical Gardens (consisting of a Cloud
Forest and Bamboo patch, among other delights) and learn
that life's a picnic waiting to happen.
Berkeley
There are a few experiences — sky-diving and bungee
jumping being among them — that can approach the
sheer adrenaline-pumping thrill of walking down Berke
ley's famed Telegraph Avenue in an oversize Stanford jer
sey. So don't miss out.
Apart from the usual fare of palm-readers and used book
stores, you will encounter Amoeba, a sprawling music ware
house. And then, once you've tired of thumbing through the
stacks of used CDs. head to Rasputin to compare prices.
This guide is not. as you may surmise, a complete listing of
happening places in the Bay Area, but it should give you
good enough reason to get off your butt and explore.
And the moral of the story, as with most other things on
the Farm, is couched in paradox: You can have a life here at
Stanford — but only if you get out of it often enough.

Castro, the hub of the rainbow movement in S.F. and a great
introduction to this city's unique culture (one shop is named,
rather characteristically: "Does Your Father Know?")
And if all this urban excitement makes you yearn for the
rural environs of Stanford, amble through The Golden Gate
Park's fabulous Botanical Gardens (consisting of a Cloud
Forest and Bamboo patch, among other delights) and learn
that life's a picnic waiting to happen.
Berkeley
There are a few experiences — sky-diving and bungee
jumping being among them — that can approach the
sheer adrenaline-pumping thrill of walking down Berke
ley's famed Telegraph Avenue in an oversize Stanford jer
sey. So don't miss out.
Apart from the usual fare of palm-readers and used book
stores, you will encounter Amoeba, a sprawling music ware
house. And then, once you've tired of thumbing through the
stacks of used CDs. head to Rasputin to compare prices.
This guide is not. as you may surmise, a complete listing of
happening places in the Bay Area, but it should give you
good enough reason to get off your butt and explore.
And the moral of the story, as with most other things on
the Farm, is couched in paradox: You can have a life here at
Stanford — but only if you get out of it often enough.

Though it didn't make our "hip hangouts" short list,
Ikea is a very, very "hip" place to hang, indeed.
As a freshman, one of the greatest fictions is the notion
that freshmen never get off campus. The truth is that the ab
sence of cars makes this the perfect time to begin what will
certainly he a life-long experiment with public transportation
and procrastination.
Not only will you ride the Caltrain in your comfy Stan
ford sweatshirt, but you will also spend hours — nay,
days — puttering around San Francisco and Berkeley,
trying to forget about the undigested entrails of the I-
Hum or SLE papers you will give yourTA the next morn
ing. But hey. if a visit to a hookah joint helps you choose
a major, who cares?
Palo Alto hangouts
University Avenue is U>o obvious a locale to include in
this subtle dissection of Bay Area hangouts — so we will skip
it in favor of locations you are less likely to stumble upon.
To begin with, try out Tea Time, a quaint shop with over
20 varieties of tea (including Cocoa Chai) and an average
client age of 70 that you can lower with your unique presence.
The Dutch Goose in Menlo Park, meanwhile, provides
relief from Palo Alto's sterility with its peanut-covered floor,
cheap beer and super deviled eggs.
On the other end of the spectrum, there's Menlo Park's
Cafe Borrone with its sunny terrace and relaxed yuppiness,
andQ-Cupon University Avenue, which is one of Stanford's
newest pearl nulk tea venues. Gelato Classico is the spot for
icy Italian treats.

Entertainment
If the Marguerite isn't your idea of smooth lane-cruis
ing. hit up Palo Alto Bowl, only a couple of miles from cam
pus. Since Stanford's last real party was back in 1891, the
Saturday night disco set-up — complete with smoke, mir
rors and music — will be a welcome escape from your
monochrome existence.
Not satisfied with the spastic fooz-ball players in your
lounge? Dig out your fake ID and visit Dave and Busters, de
scribed rather alarmingly as "Chuck E. Cheese for adults" by
one e-zine. Get into a batting cage, feed your NRA fantasies
in the shinning gallery and knock around some pool balls.
Q-Zar Laser Tag in RedwtxxJ City is the perfect place to in
vite that arrogant kid from I-Hum ;uid shoot his virtiuil brains out.
Further, if you wish to putt a safe distance away from Stan
ford's club-wielding graduate students, try Sunnyvale's
Golfland USA. This mini-golf venue is home to such famous
holes as Wonky Castle and Requisite Windmill and boasts
two mid-level courses.
San Francisco
Your dorm scavenger hunt, run by highly conservative
RAs, will take you to Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square,
North Beach, China Town, the Metreon and Big Al'sSexShc>p.
For anyone new to the city, however, there is no place
more fascinating than Haight-Ashbury. Full of egregiously
expensive hipster hangouts posing as thrift stores and pot
heads posing as potheads, this street succeeds in retaining its
60s hippie vibe.
Browse the awesome book shops, camp out in the huge

music stores and check out the wide range of eateries. Kan
zaman. an Arabian restaurant with flavored hookahs and
friendly belly-dancers, is highly recommended.
