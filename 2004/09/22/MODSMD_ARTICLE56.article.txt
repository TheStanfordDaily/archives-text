# Frosh frequently-asked-questions, for those who just want some answers
## 
### TAM VO DESK EDITOR 
Despite all the staff members who have been hired to
make your life easier, all the "informative" presentations
scheduled for your benefit and all the advice given to you
about everything by just about everyone, you may still have
some unanswered questions. But it's highly doubtful that
they are any of the following:
Q: I really want to organize a water fight in my hallway
hut I spent all my money on Febreze and ramen noodles.
Can Absolute Fun help me out?
A: While the ASSU's Absolute Fun program can't fund
individual requests, the SHPRCcan hook you up with 12
free condoms each quarter (feel free to mix and match the
condoms with lubes, dental dams and massage oil, all of
which come in a variety of colors and flavors).
While there, you can ask fora demonstration of how to
put on a condom using only your mouth. They're probably
more durable than any water balloons you could buy at
Safewav. And they're FREE.

Q: My best friend from high school at Harvard is already
rushing Omega Beta Zeta Kappa Omicron Alpha. I want to
he his long-distance frat brother, but I hear that there's no
rush. What gives?
A: There is no fall rush for freshman, true, but that's be
cause Stanford doesn't want to be like 1 iarvard. We already
both have mascots that are named after similar colors; isn't
that enough? Actually, this is probably because the admin
istration wants you to use this time to get to know your fel
low freshmen. There will be plenty of time for brotherly
love and paddling later in your Stanford career. You can
start training now for Smashy Smashy and keg rolling,
which happen during spring rush, kids.
Q: Ihe administration keeps telling me, "We did not
make a mistake in admitting you. "How can they be so sure?
A: Well, while we don't know what your parents were
thinking when they conceived you, we're pretty sure you're
not an admit mistake. You're here, aren't you? Calm down.
Make the most of your freshman year. They wouldn't have
allowed you to move in if you weren't supposed to be here.
They would still take your tuition payment, though.

Q: / was sth grade president, secretary of my Bth grade stu
dent council ami vice president of ASH for all four years of
high school. / really want to run forASSUpresident but only
have enough money for one election — what should I do?
A: Only suckers run the first time. Pull a Chioke / Kory
and plan your victory during the second round of elections,
complete with catchy slogans and brightly colored t-shirts.
Or be like the Intermission slate and go to Coachella in
stead of campaigning. You may be eliminated in the first
round, but at least you spent money on good music, not mil
lions of flyers that you have to eventually take down.
O: My I-Hum requires us to read, like, 20 books, includ
ing some stuff that I'm pretty sure isn't in English. How do /
manage all of that on top of my other classes?
A: I la, I-I lum reading. No one actually reads for I-Hum.
Q: How do I navigate through the Intersection of Death
without becoming part of a five-bike pileup?
A: Located at the corner of the Quad by the Education
building and the Clock Tower, the Intersection of Death is
where you'll witness smart kids gettinij into bike accidents

every day. Researchers are busy studying the phenomenon,
which continues to baffle them: Is I.Q. negatively correlat
ed to bike-riding ability?
Actually, surviving the intersection is just a matter of
paying attention to your surroundings and having common
sense. People will not notice you until they're about to crash
into you, so begin screaming "1 DO NOT HAVE
BRAKES!" as you cruise down the hill by the Bookstore.
Follow any groups of people going in your direction, and try
to cushion yourself in the middle. 11 anything happens, they
will get hit first.
If you still can't ride a bike, opt fora longboard or skate
board, which you can train yourself to jump off of when it
appears an accident is inevitable. If all else fails, you might
want to wear a helmet, at the risk of being mistaken fora
sketchy grad student.
O: Will everyone know that I'm a freshman?
A: You're the only ones standing in the middle of the
Quad trying to find Jamba Juice on your campus map.
Looking confused. While wearing your keys on red lan
yards around your necks. It's kind of obvious.

which come in a variety of colors and flavors).
While there, you can ask fora demonstration of how to
put on a condom using only your mouth. They're probably
more durable than any water balloons you could buy at
Safewav. And they're FREE.

Q: My best friend from high school at Harvard is already
rushing Omega Beta Zeta Kappa Omicron Alpha. I want to
he his long-distance frat brother, but I hear that there's no
rush. What gives?
A: There is no fall rush for freshman, true, but that's be
cause Stanford doesn't want to be like 1 iarvard. We already
both have mascots that are named after similar colors; isn't
that enough? Actually, this is probably because the admin
istration wants you to use this time to get to know your fel
low freshmen. There will be plenty of time for brotherly
love and paddling later in your Stanford career. You can
start training now for Smashy Smashy and keg rolling,
which happen during spring rush, kids.
Q: Ihe administration keeps telling me, "We did not
make a mistake in admitting you. "How can they be so sure?
A: Well, while we don't know what your parents were
thinking when they conceived you, we're pretty sure you're
not an admit mistake. You're here, aren't you? Calm down.
Make the most of your freshman year. They wouldn't have
allowed you to move in if you weren't supposed to be here.
They would still take your tuition payment, though.

Q: / was sth grade president, secretary of my Bth grade stu
dent council ami vice president of ASH for all four years of
high school. / really want to run forASSUpresident but only
have enough money for one election — what should I do?
A: Only suckers run the first time. Pull a Chioke / Kory
and plan your victory during the second round of elections,
complete with catchy slogans and brightly colored t-shirts.
Or be like the Intermission slate and go to Coachella in
stead of campaigning. You may be eliminated in the first
round, but at least you spent money on good music, not mil
lions of flyers that you have to eventually take down.
O: My I-Hum requires us to read, like, 20 books, includ
ing some stuff that I'm pretty sure isn't in English. How do /
manage all of that on top of my other classes?
A: I la, I-I lum reading. No one actually reads for I-Hum.
Q: How do I navigate through the Intersection of Death
without becoming part of a five-bike pileup?
A: Located at the corner of the Quad by the Education
building and the Clock Tower, the Intersection of Death is
where you'll witness smart kids gettinij into bike accidents

every day. Researchers are busy studying the phenomenon,
which continues to baffle them: Is I.Q. negatively correlat
ed to bike-riding ability?
Actually, surviving the intersection is just a matter of
paying attention to your surroundings and having common
sense. People will not notice you until they're about to crash
into you, so begin screaming "1 DO NOT HAVE
BRAKES!" as you cruise down the hill by the Bookstore.
Follow any groups of people going in your direction, and try
to cushion yourself in the middle. 11 anything happens, they
will get hit first.
If you still can't ride a bike, opt fora longboard or skate
board, which you can train yourself to jump off of when it
appears an accident is inevitable. If all else fails, you might
want to wear a helmet, at the risk of being mistaken fora
sketchy grad student.
O: Will everyone know that I'm a freshman?
A: You're the only ones standing in the middle of the
Quad trying to find Jamba Juice on your campus map.
Looking confused. While wearing your keys on red lan
yards around your necks. It's kind of obvious.
