# For the freshman who aspires to bleed Cardinal red
## Stanford traditions 
###

DESK EDITOR
There was a time at Stanford when corduroys were restricted to seniors; stu
dents from different graduating classes were distinguished by the kind of hat
they wore; freshmen were dunked in tubs in Encina Hall, then an all-male
dorm; and students soaked up the sun on Lake Lagunita. While these customs
are long gone, Stanford is still rich in offbeat traditions, from the Band run in
September to Wacky Walk at Commencement.
All year long, Stanford students can participate in a

range of activities that will give them a sense of home, ca
maraderie and what exactly it means to be a Stanford stu
dent. Here is a guide for incoming students to learn the
campus lingo, understand the history of the Cal rivalry and
discover a hidden place to make out.
September / October
Full Moon on the Quad
Under the light of the first full moon of the quarter,
freshmen boys become men and freshmen girls become
women with the kiss of a senior, according to legend. Full
Moon on the Quad is also a favorite event for non-seniors
to pucker up with a generous crowd. Originally, the tradi
tion was for couples to congregate in the Quad to share a
kiss under the moonlight.
Band Run
Meet the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching
Band on a run through campus. With the tree in tow, the
run culminates in the Quad.
First football game, Sept. 25
In 1963, the Stanford band premiered a new version of
the Star Spangled banner; at a game that took place days
after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, the song
left fans in tears. Today, learn to jump at the right time to
"All Right Now," the band's anthem, played after touch
downs, at this year's first football game against USC. The
original song is a 1970s one-hit wonder by the British pop
band Free. With abdominals blazoned Stanford red, rat
tle your keys at the kickoff and organize a "wave" with
dorm members.
Flicks
Procrastinate on Sunday nights in Memorial Auditori
um at Flicks, which is celebrating its 66th anniversary this
year. A weekly movie is screened at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m., and
the event is open to undergraduate and graduate students.
But Flicks is not just a movie — it's a paper fight too. First
showing of the year is on Oct. 3.
San Francisco scavenger hunt
Get to know your dorm mates during a hunt in the big
city. From Big A1 'a sex shop to the tattoo parlor, the team
that executes the most outrageous assignments (wearing
the fewest pieces of clothing) is the winner.
Stanfor-dictionary
Learn what CoHo, FloMo, Pro Fro, MemChu and
FroSoCo mean. Or eschew them.
November
Big Game, Nov. 20
This battle of brawn is fought on the football field on
Nov. 20 between two schools whose students are more
renowned for their brains. The yearly rivalry began in 1892
when the older University of California challenged
fledgling Stanford to a friendly match. The inexperienced
Stanford boys had no equipment, no coach, no uniforms
and no playing field. But on March 19, on the Haight Street
field in San Francisco, Stanford upset favored Cal in a 14-
10 game. This year the two meet at Berkeley for their 107 th
match-up.
Pre-Big Game pump-iips: Rally, Countdown and Red Hot
Prof competition
In April 1899. during a pre-game bonfire rally, the yell
leader introduced a real axe into his "Give 'em the axe"
chant, directed toward Cal. The axe was used to decapi
tate a straw effigy dressed in Cal's colors, gold and blue.
After Stanford's loss, Cal students nabbed the axe and
held it captive until 1930, when Stanford students recov
ered it in a daring heist. The rescuers were immortalized
as the Stanford 21.
Today, the Axe Committee protects the battle
weapon and pumps up the spirit of the student body.
Camping out in White Plaza before the two teams crash
helmets, the committee marks each hour leading to the
game with the sounding of a train whistle. (This year, the
committee members camp out for 107 hours to mark the
107 th game.)
During the countdown, campus celebrities like Uni
versity President John Hennessy stop by White Plaza to
sound the whistle. Last year, former secretary of defense
and Management Science and Engineering Prof. William
Perry won the Red Hot Prof competition, in which the
most spirited professor is chosen to assist the committee
with the axe yell on the field during Big Game. Accord
ing to Dave Daly, a member of Stanford Historical Soci
ety's Board of Directors, Perry made sure his flight from
Washington, D.C. arrived at Stanford in time for his turn
to sound the whistle.

Gaieties, Nov 17-19
Big Game season is not complete without Gaieties — a student-written, -
produced and -directed musical performed in preparation for Stanford's
match against Cal. Special performances by Hennessy, Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet and other members of the administration
are coupled with shots at Cal. Dorms often reserve group seats in Memorial
Auditorium to witness a show where anything goes.
Sixth Man Club

As football season comes to a close, basketball begins in a newly renovated
Maples Pavilion. Sit in the student-section and cheer Stanford to victory. Who
knows, maybe Tiger Woods will show up at a game again this year.
December
Secret Snowflake
In the spirit of the holiday season/dormmates are secretly paired to devise
embarrassing antics for their partner lo perform in front of their housemates.

Primal Scream
At midnight each night during Dead Week, students yell at the top of their
lungs from their windows to relieve their end-of-quarter stress and anguish.
January
Dorm ski trips
Hit the slopes or play poker in the cabin during dorm ski trips to Tahoe and
other nearby snow-bunny hot spots.

Library Check-out
Hook up in Green Library's South Stacks, amidst rows of dusty books. Hey,
at least there's no roommate.
February
Screw Your Roommate
An opportune time to get set up with that hot chick you have had your eye
on in I-Hum or that guy in the dorm next door. The perfect blind date dance

— set up your roommate with a date, and your roommate
sets you up.
Parents' Weekend
Parents invade campus for "back to school" lectures,
Q&A with Hennessy, special performances by campus
groups and, of course, quality time on campus with
you.
Viennese Ball
The Viennese Ball Committee hosts the event so you
can show off your twinkle toes. Make sure you are dressed
appropriately - gowns and tuxedos are the norm. The
group normally charges students to attend the event, but
this policy created a stir on campus last year. Some argued
that the committee could not charge students since it al
ready received ASSU Special Fees.
March
Midnight Breakfast
Students take a break during paper-writing season fora
midnight meal, served by the University president and
other administrators. It is an annual event for students,
staff, and faculty to bond over bagels.
April
Fountain-hopping
Jump into a fountain to cool off on a hot day. Feel like a
bubble bath? Take some laundry detergent by the fountain
in front of Green library.
Frisbce Golf
Run around campus throwing Frisbees at designated
landmarks. Nighttime preferable.
The Game
A 24-hour hunt where students decode elaborate clues
that lead to a final destination. First to solve all the clues is
the winner.
May
Assassins
Water gun in hand, perform covert missions to tag dorm
mates. Last one who has not been soaked is the winner.
Competition to be the Tree
Adopted as a spoof on mascot selection processes at
other universities, the competition to become the Tree was
created by members of the Band in 1973. The Tree accom
panies the Band at athletic events and can also be seen at
on-campus rallies.
Tree hopefuls execute outrageous stunts (such as scal
ing Hoover Tower) to win the honored position. The Tree,
however, is not the official symbol of the University - that
would be Cardinal, the color. In 1930, the University adopt
ed the Indians as an additional mascot.
Due to concern that the mascot presented a racist
stereotype of Native Americans, in 1972 the ASSU voted to
discontinue the Indians. Stanford students then picked
Robber Barons as the mascot, but the Athletic Department
ignored their wishes and decided to stick with simply the
Cardinal.
Pledge Parties
New pledge classes throw elaborate bashes to out-do
their fellow fraternities.
Exotic Erotic
No entrance with more than two pieces of clothing. This
party was once rated by Playboy magazine as one of the
wildest on any college campus.
Admit Weekend
Be a RoHo or a HoHo and hang out with a Pro Fro.
Boat Dance
Dorms rent a floating vessel and hit the deck to con
clude freshmen dorm bonding.
June
Wacky Walk at Commencement
Only Grad students walk in straight lines. Undergrads
must pour into the stadium unorganized, chaotic and
dressed down, often with only cap and gown and nothing
underneath.
Steamtunneling
Explore Stanford's underground tunnels, but watch out
for rats and asbestos. Also, be sure not to get locked in, as
that would lower your chances of returning for sophomore
year.
