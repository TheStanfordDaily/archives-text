# 'Doing Stanford'
## 
### TAM VO DESK EDITOR 
The following is not a message
from the administration, the U AC, the
CDC, the "Unofficial Guide to Stan
ford" or your parents.
1) Shooting ducks on water — It's
easy to get discouraged by the fact
that everyone around you is amazing.
In fact, every year, the administration
admits "the most diverse, most tal
ented class" ever!
Not only are they certified ge
niuses that play croquet like no
body's business, they also research
the mating patterns of adolescent
penguins on the weekdays in be
tween teaching kids how to play the
/.ither. It also happens that they in
vented their own language! Holy
crap! And here you are, just trying to
stay afloat.
What you might not know is that
they're furiously trying to keep up
with their activities and they proba
bly don't even have time to breathe.
Everyone is here fora reason. Screw
overachieving, you got into Stanford
already. Now let's learn to settle for
"happily mediocre" — find what
you enjoy.
2) Screech Powers, eat your heart
out — You'll find that a lot of people
complain that there's no dating at
Stanford. It strikes me as ironic that
incredibly intelligent people aren't
more pro-active about these things. If
v»>u want to date, date. If you don't
want to jnake the effort, shut up!
We're all really nerds deep down,
so don't let that pretty girl who sits
two seats ahead of you in Poli Sci in
timidate you with her scorching good
looks. Take a lesson from Jason
Schwartzman's creepy character
"Ethan" from the movie "Slackers"
and stay away from unhealthy infatu
ation and making hair dolls.
3) Escape Artist — Wake up, show
er, eat, class, work, sleep, rinse, repeat.
Sound familiar? If you find yourself in a
rut, it's usually because you haven't es
caped your life at schtxil lately.
Taking the afternoon off to win
dow shop longingly at the Stanford
Shopping Center doesn't count. Give

yourself two ditch days — one for
sunny weather, and the other for rainy
days. DonVt worry, no truancy officers
will chase after you.
Have an adventure away from the
bubble. Mini-golf or go-kart race in
the middle of the day. Catch a matinee
at the Metreon in San Francisco and
grab a c!u)colate malted milkshake at
Mel's Diner afterwards. Have a warm,
buttery crepe on Haight-Ashbury.
Hide in the exhibits at the SFMOMA.
Drive off to Half Moon Bay and get
some perspective at the beach. Go
where no I-Hum paper can followyou.
4) Shove it, Goldman Sachs
Schwartz Merrill Lynch — We're
under a lot of pressure to succeed in all
aspects of life. Even a cavity at the den
tist is enough to make some perfec
tionists freak out. Just because a job is
prestigious doesn't mean you'll be
happy with it. You could easily end up
in a swankier version of "Office
Space," complete with corporate Ikea
furniture and sterile cubicles. Titles,
company cars and business cards may
leave you feeling unfulfilled.
What's the point of slaving away
fora salary that you don't even have
time to enjoy? If what you really want
to do is teach underwater basket
weaving to chimpanzees or run a
bungee jumping company in Tanza
nia, do it. Now get me those TPS re
ports, peon.
5) Play the game of Risk — Step
outside your comfort zone once in
awhile, you pansy. I'm not sure how
many of your professors here will
ask you to get up on your desk and
chant "Carpe Diem!" (a la Dead
Poet's Society) but you should defi
nitely explore some things you
never had the guts to do before.
Talk to a random person. They
may be a little weirded out at first,
but you have no idea how much you
could gain from one five-minute
conversation. Now the real test is if
you can do it long after Orientation
is over.
Learn to longboard. Stand in the
Intersection of Death with your eyes
closed. I was kidding about that last
one. Shake things up a bit. The un
predictable is exciting.

The Dish offers nice views for those sick of staring at
fellow Stanford overachievers in Meyer Library.

Places in Palo Alto like the Edge Nightclub can be fun,
even when their liquor licenses are suspended. Really.

ask you to get up on your desk and
chant "Carpe Diem!" (a la Dead
Poet's Society) but you should defi
nitely explore some things you
never had the guts to do before.
Talk to a random person. They
may be a little weirded out at first,
but you have no idea how much you
could gain from one five-minute
conversation. Now the real test is if
you can do it long after Orientation
is over.
Learn to longboard. Stand in the
Intersection of Death with your eyes
closed. I was kidding about that last
one. Shake things up a bit. The un
predictable is exciting.

Places in Palo Alto like the Edge Nightclub can be fun,
even when their liquor licenses are suspended. Really.
The following is not a message
from the administration, the U AC, the
CDC, the "Unofficial Guide to Stan
ford" or your parents.
1) Shooting ducks on water — It's
easy to get discouraged by the fact
that everyone around you is amazing.
In fact, every year, the administration
admits "the most diverse, most tal
ented class" ever!
Not only are they certified ge
niuses that play croquet like no
body's business, they also research
the mating patterns of adolescent
penguins on the weekdays in be
tween teaching kids how to play the
/.ither. It also happens that they in
vented their own language! Holy
crap! And here you are, just trying to
stay afloat.
What you might not know is that
they're furiously trying to keep up
with their activities and they proba
bly don't even have time to breathe.
Everyone is here fora reason. Screw
overachieving, you got into Stanford
already. Now let's learn to settle for
"happily mediocre" — find what
you enjoy.
2) Screech Powers, eat your heart
out — You'll find that a lot of people
complain that there's no dating at
Stanford. It strikes me as ironic that
incredibly intelligent people aren't
more pro-active about these things. If
v»>u want to date, date. If you don't
want to jnake the effort, shut up!
We're all really nerds deep down,
so don't let that pretty girl who sits
two seats ahead of you in Poli Sci in
timidate you with her scorching good
looks. Take a lesson from Jason
Schwartzman's creepy character
"Ethan" from the movie "Slackers"
and stay away from unhealthy infatu
ation and making hair dolls.
3) Escape Artist — Wake up, show
er, eat, class, work, sleep, rinse, repeat.
Sound familiar? If you find yourself in a
rut, it's usually because you haven't es
caped your life at schtxil lately.
Taking the afternoon off to win
dow shop longingly at the Stanford
Shopping Center doesn't count. Give

yourself two ditch days — one for
sunny weather, and the other for rainy
days. DonVt worry, no truancy officers
will chase after you.
Have an adventure away from the
bubble. Mini-golf or go-kart race in
the middle of the day. Catch a matinee
at the Metreon in San Francisco and
grab a c!u)colate malted milkshake at
Mel's Diner afterwards. Have a warm,
buttery crepe on Haight-Ashbury.
Hide in the exhibits at the SFMOMA.
Drive off to Half Moon Bay and get
some perspective at the beach. Go
where no I-Hum paper can followyou.
4) Shove it, Goldman Sachs
Schwartz Merrill Lynch — We're
under a lot of pressure to succeed in all
aspects of life. Even a cavity at the den
tist is enough to make some perfec
tionists freak out. Just because a job is
prestigious doesn't mean you'll be
happy with it. You could easily end up
in a swankier version of "Office
Space," complete with corporate Ikea
furniture and sterile cubicles. Titles,
company cars and business cards may
leave you feeling unfulfilled.
What's the point of slaving away
fora salary that you don't even have
time to enjoy? If what you really want
to do is teach underwater basket
weaving to chimpanzees or run a
bungee jumping company in Tanza
nia, do it. Now get me those TPS re
ports, peon.
5) Play the game of Risk — Step
outside your comfort zone once in
awhile, you pansy. I'm not sure how
many of your professors here will
ask you to get up on your desk and
chant "Carpe Diem!" (a la Dead
Poet's Society) but you should defi
nitely explore some things you
never had the guts to do before.
Talk to a random person. They
may be a little weirded out at first,
but you have no idea how much you
could gain from one five-minute
conversation. Now the real test is if
you can do it long after Orientation
is over.

Intersection of Death with your eyes
closed. I was kidding about that last
