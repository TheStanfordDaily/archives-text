You've been cooped up all summer, trying
to avoid the heat by hiding out in the movie
theater, listening to Usher's "Yeah!" in the car
with the air on full blast. But now that fall's
here, it's time to get out and get active.
Because your dorm can get pretty stuffy, it's
good to know the ins and outs of the great out
doors around the Stanford campus. Whether
you're into lazy afternoon hikes or extreme
sport, the Bay Area boasts something for all.
While you're on campus, take the opportu
nity to check out some of the great running
and hiking trails around the golf course and
Lake Lagunita. There's an excellent running
trail to the Dish that will surely get your heart
pounding and keep it that way for three-and
a-half miles. If you choose to run the perime
ter of the golf course, it's about two-and-a-half
miles, and for those of you interested in a
shorter jog, the path around Lake Lag is al
most one mile. .

If you prefer the ocean to the lake,
Half Moon Bay, located about 45 min
utes north of Stanford on Interstate 280,
remains a popular spot for those longing
to hit the beach. If you're looking for an
area to surf. Half Moon Bay State
Beach, along Highway 1, is one of the
state's longest stretches of uninterrupt
ed beach. For campers, Francis Beach
(at the Kelley Avenue exit off Highway
92) allows for overnight camping.
Santa Cruz is also a great close desti
nation for those looking to spend an af
ternoon in the sun and sand â€” and
aboard some of the state's oldest roller
coasters. Monterey, about an hour and
a half south of Stanford, offers scuba
diving and sea kayaking.
If you're interested in other water
sports, check into river rafting. The
season extends from March to Octo
ber. While rafting is less easily accessi
ble, tours are available through a
number of rafting companies, such as
All Outdoors Whitewater Trips and
Outback Adventures.
If you are at Lake Lag in the winter,
swing by the kayak club's boathouse.
The club, open to students, faculty and
staff, specializes in whitewater kayaking.
Don't be surprised if you run into a
few sailors and windsurfers while
you're at the lake. If you're interested in

getting started with sailing, the one-unit sailing
activity class is a great way to get your feet wet.
And if you really feel like going overboard, set
sail with the Stanford Sailing Association.
For true outdoor aficionados, one of the
most beautiful national parks, Yosemite, is just
4.5 hours east. A popular destination for both
hikers and campers, Yosemite offers the
chance to get up close and personal with the
scenery that inspired photographer Ansel
Adams. A haven for hikers and nature enthusi
asts alike, Yosemite offers trails for all levels.
If you'd prefer a weekend trip, drive up to
Lake Tahoe. The drive can take about six
hours, depending on traffic. The ski season
runs from about December through May.
For those of you with a truly adventurous
spirit looking to take to the skies, bungee
jumping, flying, hang gliding, skydiving and
ballooning can all be done in the Bay Area. If
you really want to take off, get in touch with
the Stanford Flying Club. They can get you in
the pilot's seat in no time.
