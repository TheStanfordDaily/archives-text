# Stanford steals two top scholars from Harvard
## 
### JENNIE KIM STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has hired African and
African American studies profes
sors from Harvard, a move designed
to establish Stanford's Center for
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity as the national leader in
the field.

Professors Lawrence Bobo and
Marcyliena Morgan, who are mar
ried, will arrive in January and work
in the sociology and communication
departments, respectively. Bobo
will also take the reigns of the
CCSRE in the fall of 2005.
"Stanford sociology is positioned
to become the most intellectually
exciting unit in the discipline today,"

Bobo said.
Bobo, who was recently elected
to the National Academy of Sci
ences, is best known for his research
on racial attitudes and relations, so
cial psychology, public opinion and
political behavior.
Morgan is the founder and direc
tor of the Hip Hop Archive, a collec
tion of song lyrics that she will bring
to Stanford.
Her research has focused on
language, culture and identity, and
sociolinguistics, particularly within
the African and African American
communities. She will join Stan
ford as an associate professor in
communication.
"These are crowning appoint
ments," said Claude Steele, a psy
chology professor and current direc
tor of the CCSRE. "We are devel
oping perhaps the strongest center
for the comparative study of race
and ethnicity, in the nation."
"We are very fortunate to recruit
Professors Bobo and Morgan," said
in Sharon Long, the Dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
in a press release. "Their work ad
dresses centrally important ques
tions about race, identity and equal
ity in our society."
The appointments add clout to
an already prominent academic pro
gram on campus, Steele said.
"CCSRE has both a strong un
dergraduate major and a research
institute (Research Institute for the
Comparative Study of Race and
Ethnicity) that has over 100 faculty
in affiliation."
Long said, in an interview, the
open, interdisciplinary structure of
CCSRE was highly influential in
recruiting Bobo and Morgan.
"We were able to attract Larry
and Marcy because at Harvard they
were cornered over in
African American studies," she
said. "Stanford provides a better
context and home for their work. I

think (CCSRHJ will become a model
of how to break through disciplinary
boundaries and strengthen the clus
ter to make the whole more than the
sum of the parts," she added.
Several Stanford faculty have al
ready expressed excitement at the
news. History professor
Clayborne Carson, who is also
the director of the King Papers Pro
ject, called the appointments "a
major step forward for the CCSRE
and for Stanford."
However, he added that the Uni
versity has room for improvement.
"I remain disappointed that the his
tory department still has no full
time person in the African Ameri
can field," Carson said.
Students are also eagerly await
ing Bobo's arrival. Before he trans
ferred from Harvard two years ago,
Stanford NAACP president Chris
Cowan, a senior, was enrolled in
Bobo's sociology seminar, "Race
and Crime."
"We dealt with so many issues
surrounding disparities in crimes
and punishments by race," he said.
"The class was a great experience."
Harvard, historically the preemi
nent institution for African and
African American scholarship, has
recently lost several renowned pro
fessors in the field since university
president Lawrence H. Summers
took the helm three years ago.
Other high-profile departures in
clude Cornel West and Kwame An
thony Appiah, who both decamped
for Princeton two years ago.
West is scheduled to speak at
Stanford on Sept. 30.
