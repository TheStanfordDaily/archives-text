During Admit Weekend, many Pro Fros
(see definition below) are apt to dismiss the
silly-sounding names they hear for otherwise
respectable institutions.
"I'm sure no one really calls Memorial
Church 'MemChu,'" they scoff.
Well, now that you're a full-fledged frosh,
it's time you familiarized yourself with these
abbreviations, because contrary to common
sense, they are actually used.
Here's a short glossary to get you started.
A A: Academic Advisor. These are the facul
ty and staff members who advise freshmen.
CoHo: The Coffee House. The recently ren
ovated Stanford hangout at Tresidder Union
that serves food and coffee. Also host to as
piring musicians, Stanford and otherwise.
Dink: Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The auditori
um located across from the CoHo.
FloMo: Florence Moore Hall. A big dormito
ry located just off of the Row, named after a
woman named Florence Moore. She gave
Stanford lots of money, enough to build a
bunch of housing, under the condition that
real ice cream be served at every meal. She
rules.
FroSoCo: Freshman Sophomore College. Fro
So Co holds two titles: First, it is the most iso
lated and borderline-off-campus dorm, and
second, it has the biggest rooms for freshmen.
FroSoSo: Freshman / Sophomore Seminars.
Generally, these are interesting, small classes
that provide you with a lot of face time with
University faculty with a minimal amount of
work. Highly recommended.
HoCo: Honors College. You know that
you're going to be writing an honors thesis
senior year, and you're going to hate your
life every minute for it. so why not get an
early start on it by attending HoCo, the
two-week thesis workshop for seniors that
takes place before the start of your final
school year?
MemAud: Memorial Auditorium. An audi
torium located across from Hoover Tower.

They show FLiCKS there every Sunday
night. FLiCKS are cheap movies with paper
fights included.
MemChu: Memorial Church. A non-denom
inational church located in the Quad. The
pews are hard wood, but the peaceful atmo
sphere of the church make it an ideal after
noon nap spot.
MuFuUnSun: Music and Fun Under the Sun.
Event. Free food. You should go.
PAA: Peer Academic Advisor. These are
the upperclassmen who advise freshmen.
Ask them for directions, so you don't look
like a tourist.
PoCo: Potter College. A new offering to
students, PoCo hopes to foster a dorm at
mosphere that is both social and intellectu
al, allowing students with various research
interests to live together. The jury is still out
on this one, but at least most PoCo residents
will be blessed with singles or two-room
doubles.
Pro Fro: Prospective Freshman. The official
term is now "admits." This term is disliked by
most students, as there is no potential abbre
viation for it. Ro Hos (Room Hosts), stu
dents who host Pro Fros in their rooms dur
ing Admit Weekend, are not to be confused
with Ho Hos (House Hosts), who coordinate
the dorm's Pro Fro Ro Ho activities.
KesEd: Residential Education. The people
who coordinate educational programs in
dorms all year.
SoCo: Sophomore College. Billed as an op
portunity to further the academic pursuits of
upcoming sophomores. So Co is also an ex
pensive way to spend two weeks partying on
campus or a cheap way to get a luxury cruise
to the Galapagos.
TresEx: Tresidder Express. The on-cainpus
store, located in Tresidder. They sell Chee
tos, deodorant and other tasty things. For
bigger orders, head to Safeway, down El
Camino toward Menlo Park. There's anoth
er Safeway, but that one's a secret.
