# Sex at the 'S'
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
You would think that the big 'S' — Stanford, an
elite school famous for its mellow, happy setting and
undergraduate diversity — would have some kind of
dating scene, wouldn't you? Well, you'd be wrong.
Dating, as you know it. is dead at Stanford. For
immobile freshmen, it's the worst. Dinner and a
movie? It's more like sharing your points at Wilbur
Dining and ducking paper missiles at Flicks. For
the uninitiated, deciphering Stanford's dating code
can take months — even some upperclassmen still
don't get it. Here's a guide to understanding the
basic terminology:
Non-dating
It may be wishful thinking to call a half-hour con
versation at Moonßeans a date, but you did pay for
her chai latte ... Non-dates are would-be dates in
pedestrian settings: the CoHo, SLE lounge and
Flicks all apply. But to qualify for non-date status,
the meeting must have been scheduled beforehand.
Otherwise it's just an extended run-in.
Dating Long Distance / Life on a Chain
Lots of freshmen move into their dorm rooms and
immediately perch a picture of their hometown
honey on their nightstand. But slowly, the phone
calls taper off, e-mails go unanswered. Boyfriends
and girlfriends stray, and that heart-shaped frame
gets chucked out the window.
It's much better to come to Stanford with a clean
slate. Otherwise, you'll inevitably suffer guilt and
temptation until winter break, a popular time for
splits. On the upside, if you've been eyeing someone
with "a boyfriend at home," don't despair, she'll be
single soon enough.
Kccurring Hook-Ups
Not to be confused with its feistier little sister,
Random, the Recurring Hook-Up requires a three
hook-up minimum within a set time span — four to
six weeks is standard. Eschewing courtship rituals
like dinner and mini-golf, recurring hook-ups fast
forward past the formality and get straight to the
good stuff.
By Invitation Only
Screw Your Roommate dances, class formals,
fraternity date dashes, sorority special dinners. All
outings that require arm candy, often at the last
minute, fall under this brand of dating under pres
sure. If you are invited to an event, expect a free meal
and a bottomless cup of Franzia or Charles Shaw.
Romantic Multitasking
Flirt while you spot each other at the gym; get
your problem set done and cuddle at the same time;
or have a romantic adventure at IKEA. A model of
efficiency, activity dating is the Eames chair of ro
mance — fun and functional!
Dating in a Crowd
Couples who date in a crowd aren't fooling any
one with their casually platonic demeanor. They use
groups of friends as airbags, but they manage to
share moments of intimacy nonetheless.
A Marriage of Convenience
Commonly referred to as dormcest, this type of
relationship is great for the lazy. Why take her out to
dinner when you'll be sharing a table at the dining
hall anyway?
While they may seem blissfully convenient at
first, in-dorm relationships tend to fizzle out quickly.
Nothing kills romance faster than living together.
There's a reason why half of all marriages end in di
vorce. you know.
But even if you manage to beat the odds, there
are major pitfalls. Be prepared for the entire dorm to
know all about your private life and to offer you un
solicited relationship advice while you're selecting
dressing at the salad bar.
Whatever you do, do NOT become the much-re
viled Dorm Couple, the nauseatingly affectionate
nonstop hand-holders who make out during house
meeting.
Helpful as they are, I know that these guidelines
are still woefully limited in their scope. Stanford's
bizarre mating dance is too charming, hilarious, acci
dental and sloppy to convey with words alone. If you
really want to understand the sweet ineptitude of
dating at the Farm, you've got to experience it
hands-on: Wreak havoc, break hearts, flirt shame
lessly, play mind games — all with people smarter
than you. Welcome to Stanford.
