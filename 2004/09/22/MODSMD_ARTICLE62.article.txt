# Hat fights and other tales of students from Stanford's past
## 
### NICOLE WRIGHT STAFF WRITER 
Next time some misty-eyed alum starts waxing po
etic to you about "da best years of my life" on the
Farm, don't think hula skirts, mandatory curfews and
lantern-jawed jocks. Here's our Stanford History Cliff
Notes, complete with freak accidents, freakier stu
dents and maybe even a little mayhem:
Wining and moonshining
Last spring, Stanford crafted an alcohol policy that
was widely booed for what many students saw as its
strictness — namely, no drinking in freshman com
mon areas. But back back before Prohibition. Stan
lord faculty were a bit more relaxed, loosened up.
comfortable. You get the draft, uh. drift, about things.
In the early 19205, the faculty had its own yell at
Stanford football games:
"Cigars, cigars,
( igarettes, beer.
Faculty, faculty,
We're right here!"
My, how times have changed. This tidbit might
come in handy next time you're headed home one Sat
ui day night and a friendly campus cop starts writing
up a BUI slip for biking under the influence ("But of
ficer, those old-time professors said . .. ") Then again,
you'll probably be too drunk to remember.
Tubthumping
Back in the good old days, upperclassmen had a
tradition of "tubbing" freshmen. It was a bad scene.
As this is a family newspaper, it will be left to the read
ers' imaginations. At least no females were involved,
since the campus was not yet coed.
According to reports, sometimes those rowdy kids
overdid it. It's rather indelicate to elaborate on what
that means, since dead men tell no tales.
But the tradition was thwarted when Encina Hall
was renovated; the tubs were ripped out and replaced
with showers. So lrosh, don't pout about not getting to

take a bubble bath. Giving up frolicking in the foam is
a small price to pay for bruiseless buttocks.
The thicker-chickcr-pickcr-upper
. . . on most campuses would be beer, but those
wholesome Stanford students of bygone days grabbed
an excuse to grope in frosh-soph mud fights known as
the "Stanford Rough." Photo evidence shows wran
glers in their skivvies. The fights ceased in the 19305, a

disappointment to
freshmen with
anger management
issues. Some had
complained that
the influx of female
participants was
toning down the
roughhousing.

Before 1920
when coeds were
living in 01 d
Roble. the girls de

One Timothy Hop
kins said that the
idea was that "a
fair maiden would
pluck a ripe peach

for her devoted swain." Oh puhleeze. Anyway, the
girls planted the orchard, but the trees died from ne
glect before they reached maturity. Guess once you're
getting busy, horticulture gets less interesting. (Un
less. maybe, if you're Susan Orlean.)

The original sphinxes guarding the Mausoleum ex
uded a vibe more Hooters than hauteur with their

ample bosoms. But the chesty half-woman, half-lion
creatures did not amuse Jane Stanford — after all, she
didn't pawn her pearls for these girls.
"Jane didn't fancy the extreme femininity of the
sphinxes originally placed in front," said University
Archivist Maggie Kimball. "So it is understood that
around 1900 she had them switched with the mascu
line ones."
In line with Mrs. Stanford's sense of propriety, the
male sphinxes guarding the tomb today would not be

to have their
own fight club.
And the first
rule was ... to
duke it out with
hats. Yeah. See,
freshmen sport
ed beanies,
sophomores
wore porkpies
and seniors

donned Stetsons. During prearranged "Plug Ugly"
brawls, students would lob the so-called "plug hats"
(stiffened by dipping in white lead) at each other. One
photo shows a group of strapping guys fresh from bat
tle, proudly brandishing limbs in casts, bandaged
heads, taped jaws and arms in slings. Inevitably, ad
ministrators cracked down and the fights were banned.
Damn. That wasn't in the fight club rulebook.
Professors and schoolgirls
Vladimir Nabokov, the author of that infamous pe
dophile love story "Lolita," started work as a creative
writing teacher here in the summer of 1941. One can't
help but wonder if there were any freckled nymphette
types in his class.
Also contributing to sexual scholarship was Henry
James' older brother, the eminent psychologist
William James. He was an acting professor of psychol
ogy here in 1906. Luckily for all those who like to de
scribe annoying people as "anal-retentive," James was
among the first American boosters of Freud's theo
ries, then widely reviled by most Stateside folk as per
verse. He was also a major influence in the field of ed
ucational psychology.
French twist
The Office of Residential Education founded La
Maison Francaise in 1975, but by 1979 decided to give
another language a go in the house. In a desperate
ploy to keep the prime Row real estate. French and
Italian Chair Ralph Hester called on his French con
nections. Sure enough. Dr. Alain Pompidou, son of
then-French President Georges Pompidou, was dis
patched to campus.
Upon arrival, he got down ("Saturday Night
Fever"-style) with La Maison's chef Babette on the
front lawn of the Maison. This photo op made the
front page of The Daily. When Dean of Students
James Lyon saw the pic, he relented and overruled
the decision to suspend the Maison. Good call. Vive
le Eurotrash!
Shacking up
As the Age of Aquarius drew to a close, English
major Sigourney Weaver built a treehouse with her
own bare hands. Then, for an entire term, she lived
there with some lucky chap described as her "male
friend" (can I get a mm-hmm girls?). Her way with
power tools and her acting Japanese Noh plays, as well
as her habit of showing up in class in elfin garb, surely
gave Weaver preparation for her gutsy lead per
formances in the blockbuster "Alien," not to men
tion the 1997 movie "Snow White: A Tale of Terror."
It's not easy being SLE
"Alexander Payne, Oscar-nominated director of
'About Schmidt,' 'Election' and 'Citizen Ruth,' is a
SLE grad," points out Meredith Rowe, a former Car
denal RA. Take that, anyone who would razz the
home of the 24-hour final. The same SLEster you're
taunting right now just might be dangling multi-mil
lion-dollar contracts and groupies a few years down
the line. Heck, you might end up his groupie or her
gigolo. Treat them well.
Flash me
Yeah, it's tough work to emulate Stanford's illus
trious deviants, but someone's gotta do it. Sean Sav
age finds relief from his work as a mild-mannered
Stanford computer analyst when managing his Web
site, the disturbing-mental-picture-inducing
www.cheesebikini.com.
His site organizes "flash mobs," sudden gatherings
of people in randomly chosen location, in which they
clap and then disperse seconds later. Although Har
vard's Coop got flashmobbed last year, so far Stanford
Bookstore hasn't had to try out how many bloggers
can fit in the upstairs cafe.
Carpal tunnel of love
Thanks to the oh-so-blissful wonders of modern
technology, Stanford deviants can now make their
mark on history far beyond our fair campus, even if it
does only last for their 15 seconds of fame. Stanford
grads can post epic personals on rightstuffdating.com
— only Stanford folk and grads of other top-shelf col
leges need apply.

among the first American boosters of Freud's theo

The Office of Residential Education founded La

then-French President Georges Pompidou, was dis
patched to campus.
Upon arrival, he got down ("Saturday Night

power tools and her acting Japanese Noh plays, as well
as her habit of showing up in class in elfin garb, surely
gave Weaver preparation for her gutsy lead per

lantern-jawed jocks. Here's our Stanford History Cliff
Notes, complete with freak accidents, freakier stu
dents and maybe even a little mayhem:
Wining and moonshining

was widely booed for what many students saw as its
strictness — namely, no drinking in freshman com
mon areas. But back back before Prohibition. Stan
lord faculty were a bit more relaxed, loosened up.

In the early 19205, the faculty had its own yell at
Stanford football games:
"Cigars, cigars,
( igarettes, beer.
Faculty, faculty,
We're right here!"
My, how times have changed. This tidbit might
come in handy next time you're headed home one Sat
ui day night and a friendly campus cop starts writing
up a BUI slip for biking under the influence ("But of
ficer, those old-time professors said . .. ") Then again,
you'll probably be too drunk to remember.
Tubthumping
Back in the good old days, upperclassmen had a
tradition of "tubbing" freshmen. It was a bad scene.
As this is a family newspaper, it will be left to the read
ers' imaginations. At least no females were involved,
since the campus was not yet coed.
According to reports, sometimes those rowdy kids
overdid it. It's rather indelicate to elaborate on what
that means, since dead men tell no tales.
But the tradition was thwarted when Encina Hall
was renovated; the tubs were ripped out and replaced
with showers. So lrosh, don't pout about not getting to

take a bubble bath. Giving up frolicking in the foam is
a small price to pay for bruiseless buttocks.
The thicker-chickcr-pickcr-upper
. . . on most campuses would be beer, but those
wholesome Stanford students of bygone days grabbed
an excuse to grope in frosh-soph mud fights known as
the "Stanford Rough." Photo evidence shows wran
glers in their skivvies. The fights ceased in the 19305, a

disappointment to
freshmen with
anger management

photo shows a group of strapping guys fresh from bat
tle, proudly brandishing limbs in casts, bandaged
heads, taped jaws and arms in slings. Inevitably, ad
ministrators cracked down and the fights were banned.
Damn. That wasn't in the fight club rulebook.
Professors and schoolgirls
Vladimir Nabokov, the author of that infamous pe
dophile love story "Lolita," started work as a creative
writing teacher here in the summer of 1941. One can't
help but wonder if there were any freckled nymphette
types in his class.
Also contributing to sexual scholarship was Henry
James' older brother, the eminent psychologist
William James. He was an acting professor of psychol
ogy here in 1906. Luckily for all those who like to de
scribe annoying people as "anal-retentive," James was
among the first American boosters of Freud's theo
ries, then widely reviled by most Stateside folk as per
verse. He was also a major influence in the field of ed
ucational psychology.
French twist
The Office of Residential Education founded La
Maison Francaise in 1975, but by 1979 decided to give
another language a go in the house. In a desperate
ploy to keep the prime Row real estate. French and
Italian Chair Ralph Hester called on his French con
nections. Sure enough. Dr. Alain Pompidou, son of
then-French President Georges Pompidou, was dis
patched to campus.
Upon arrival, he got down ("Saturday Night
Fever"-style) with La Maison's chef Babette on the
front lawn of the Maison. This photo op made the
front page of The Daily. When Dean of Students
James Lyon saw the pic, he relented and overruled
the decision to suspend the Maison. Good call. Vive
le Eurotrash!
Shacking up
As the Age of Aquarius drew to a close, English
major Sigourney Weaver built a treehouse with her
own bare hands. Then, for an entire term, she lived
there with some lucky chap described as her "male
friend" (can I get a mm-hmm girls?). Her way with
power tools and her acting Japanese Noh plays, as well
as her habit of showing up in class in elfin garb, surely
gave Weaver preparation for her gutsy lead per
formances in the blockbuster "Alien," not to men
tion the 1997 movie "Snow White: A Tale of Terror."
It's not easy being SLE
"Alexander Payne, Oscar-nominated director of
'About Schmidt,' 'Election' and 'Citizen Ruth,' is a
SLE grad," points out Meredith Rowe, a former Car
denal RA. Take that, anyone who would razz the
home of the 24-hour final. The same SLEster you're
taunting right now just might be dangling multi-mil
lion-dollar contracts and groupies a few years down
the line. Heck, you might end up his groupie or her
gigolo. Treat them well.
Flash me
Yeah, it's tough work to emulate Stanford's illus
trious deviants, but someone's gotta do it. Sean Sav
age finds relief from his work as a mild-mannered
Stanford computer analyst when managing his Web
site, the disturbing-mental-picture-inducing
www.cheesebikini.com.
His site organizes "flash mobs," sudden gatherings
of people in randomly chosen location, in which they
clap and then disperse seconds later. Although Har
vard's Coop got flashmobbed last year, so far Stanford
Bookstore hasn't had to try out how many bloggers
can fit in the upstairs cafe.
Carpal tunnel of love
Thanks to the oh-so-blissful wonders of modern
technology, Stanford deviants can now make their
mark on history far beyond our fair campus, even if it
does only last for their 15 seconds of fame. Stanford
grads can post epic personals on rightstuffdating.com
— only Stanford folk and grads of other top-shelf col
leges need apply.

Next time some misty-eyed alum starts waxing po
etic to you about "da best years of my life" on the
Farm, don't think hula skirts, mandatory curfews and
lantern-jawed jocks. Here's our Stanford History Cliff
Notes, complete with freak accidents, freakier stu
dents and maybe even a little mayhem:
Wining and moonshining
Last spring, Stanford crafted an alcohol policy that
was widely booed for what many students saw as its
strictness — namely, no drinking in freshman com
mon areas. But back back before Prohibition. Stan
lord faculty were a bit more relaxed, loosened up.
comfortable. You get the draft, uh. drift, about things.
In the early 19205, the faculty had its own yell at
Stanford football games:
"Cigars, cigars,
( igarettes, beer.
Faculty, faculty,
We're right here!"
My, how times have changed. This tidbit might
come in handy next time you're headed home one Sat
ui day night and a friendly campus cop starts writing
up a BUI slip for biking under the influence ("But of
ficer, those old-time professors said . .. ") Then again,
you'll probably be too drunk to remember.
Tubthumping
Back in the good old days, upperclassmen had a
tradition of "tubbing" freshmen. It was a bad scene.
As this is a family newspaper, it will be left to the read
ers' imaginations. At least no females were involved,
since the campus was not yet coed.
According to reports, sometimes those rowdy kids
overdid it. It's rather indelicate to elaborate on what
that means, since dead men tell no tales.
But the tradition was thwarted when Encina Hall
was renovated; the tubs were ripped out and replaced
with showers. So lrosh, don't pout about not getting to

take a bubble bath. Giving up frolicking in the foam is
a small price to pay for bruiseless buttocks.
The thicker-chickcr-pickcr-upper
. . . on most campuses would be beer, but those
wholesome Stanford students of bygone days grabbed
an excuse to grope in frosh-soph mud fights known as
the "Stanford Rough." Photo evidence shows wran
glers in their skivvies. The fights ceased in the 19305, a

disappointment to
freshmen with
anger management
issues. Some had
complained that
the influx of female
participants was
toning down the
roughhousing.
(•one to seed
Before 1920
when coeds were
living in 01 d
Roble. the girls de
cided to plant a
fruit orchard
across the street.
One Timothy Hop
kins said that the
idea was that "a
fair maiden would
pluck a ripe peach

for her devoted swain." Oh puhleeze. Anyway, the
girls planted the orchard, but the trees died from ne
glect before they reached maturity. Guess once you're
getting busy, horticulture gets less interesting. (Un
less. maybe, if you're Susan Orlean.)
Busted!
The original sphinxes guarding the Mausoleum ex
uded a vibe more Hooters than hauteur with their

ample bosoms. But the chesty half-woman, half-lion
creatures did not amuse Jane Stanford — after all, she
didn't pawn her pearls for these girls.
"Jane didn't fancy the extreme femininity of the
sphinxes originally placed in front," said University
Archivist Maggie Kimball. "So it is understood that
around 1900 she had them switched with the mascu
line ones."
In line with Mrs. Stanford's sense of propriety, the
male sphinxes guarding the tomb today would not be

appraised by
Cosmo sex colum
nists as well-hung.
It ain't heavy, it's
my load of books
Also hitting the
stacks, so to speak,
was Geology Prof.
John Casper Bran
ner. In 1892. Bran
ner came to Stan
ford toting so many
tomes that he re
sorted to using a
freight train car to
transport his gigan
tic library. Yet for
some reason. Bran
ner-dwellers of re
cent years haven't
been similarly
renowned as hard-

core hookworms. Maybe this year the recently reno
vated digs will inspire bouts of studying.

Re d -

to have their

And the first
rule was ... to
duke it out with
hats. Yeah. See,
freshmen sport

sophomores

and seniors

donned Stetsons. During prearranged "Plug Ugly"
brawls, students would lob the so-called "plug hats"
(stiffened by dipping in white lead) at each other. One
photo shows a group of strapping guys fresh from bat
