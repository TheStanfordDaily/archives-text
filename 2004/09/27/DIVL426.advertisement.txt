The Stanford Program in Law, Science & Technology and its Center tor Law and the
Biosciences are proud to present Professor June Carbone of Santa Clara University
School of Law as this year's first speaker in the Center's Speaker Series. In her talk
entitled "The Biology of Commitment: The Implications for Family Law" Professor
Carbone will explore recent developments in evolutionary psychology and neuro
science to argue that humans are more inclined toward serial monogamy than lifelong
fidelity. She will then consider the implications for family law at a time when many
of the traditional restrictions on sexuality are being relaxed.
