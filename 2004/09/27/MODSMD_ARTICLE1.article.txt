# Students march for lower tuition
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With camping gear and guitars in
tow, students from the University of
California Santa Cruz spent a night
at Stanford nearly two weeks ago as
part of their 90-mile march to 14 dif
ferent Bay Area college campuses
to discuss the shortcomings of Cali
fornia's higher education system.
Spurred by decreased funding
for public higher education and ris
ing tuition, the seven students start
ed their walk on Sept. 15 at San Jose
State University, passed through
UC Berkeley and concluded their
trek at the UC Regents meeting in
San Francisco on Sept. 22. Along
the way, they stopped to speak with
students participating in Stanford's
Public Policy Leadership Institute, a
two-week long seminar sponsored
by the department of Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity, on
Sept. 16.
"This march was really just about
outreaching, because we know how
the budget cuts have affected our
education at UC Santa Cruz, but we
weren't sure how it was affecting the
education at other schools and com
munity colleges, so we wanted to
start a dialogue," said UCSC sopho
more Laurel Carlsen, who partici
pated in the walk.
State spending on higher educa
tion has decreased for the past two
years, and this is the fourth consecu
tive year that the UC system has
faced budget cuts. Students at pub
lic schools are now paying as much
as 40 percent more in tuition than
they were two years ago.
"At Santa Cruz our tuition has
gone up a lot, and a lot of the pro
grams like outreach to urban youth
and minorities were cut," Carlsen
said. "A lot of programs got cut, like
the writing program and the jour
nalism program, and it's hard to or
ganize clubs on campus."
Carlsen said many students at
the schools visited during the walk
expressed concern over cuts for the arts
and other extracurricular programming.
Another repercussion of budget cuts at
UCSC, according to Carlsen, is the weak
ening bond between students at the cam
pus's 10 "colleges" and the employees at
those colleges.
"Each college had its own theme and its
own community," she said. "You saw the
same employees every day. Now with the
budget cuts they're building more build
ings but not hiring more people, so labor is
getting stretched further. You might not
see the same workers all the time, so it
might not be as easy to empathize with
their cause."
The walk was organized as part of the
Education Rising campaign, a UCSC
based project. Education Rising Founder
Will Parrish, a recent UCSC graduate, said
that state budget cuts on higher education
are not simply an issue of California's mas

sive budget deficits.
Parrish cited a study
released in 2002 by the
Justice Policy Institute,
a nonprofit research
group dedicated to find
ing alternatives to incar
ceration, showing that
since 1985, the increase
in money spent on pris
ons nationwide topped
$20 billion — almost
twice the increase in
dollars spent on colleges
and universities.
"This demonstrates
there's a direct correla
tion, that when funding
for prisons goes up,
funding for education
goes down," Parrish
said. "The state is invest
ing not in opportunities
for young people but for
their punishment."
Education Rising be
lieves that there should
be a progressive tax in
crease aimed at the
wealthiest Californians,
that the state's alleged
"prison-industrial com
plex" should be abol
ished, and that curfew
laws and school surveil
lance should be retract-

ed.
The walkers shared these viewpoints
with Stanford students at the Public Policy
Leadership Institute, and Carlsen said they
received good feedback.
Stanford junior Chris Vaughan, who
was present for the discussion with the
walkers, said the connection between de
creased education funding and increased
prison funding was interesting in theory.
"There is a major theoretical element,"
he said. "How does the State relate to the
individual? What buildings does the State
construct and finance for the 'education' of
its citizens-classrooms on the one hand,
and prisons on the other."
He noted, however, that such an em
phasis on the relationship between schools
and prisons might not further the ultimate
goals of the campaign.
"I happen to think that California
politicians should take a more imaginative
and less antagonistic approach to both ed
ucation and incarceration," he said. "But
the way California politics works, it's not
that there is a stash of money for prison
building that can immediately be trans
ferred to school building.
Marisol Wauters, a junior who partici
pated in the Public Policy Institute pro
gram, said that the group may have re
ceived more notice if it had come to cam
pus later in the month.
"At Stanford, I don't

know how many people
knew that they were
here," said junior
Marisol Wauters, a stu
dent in the Public Policy
Institute program.
"Maybe at other
schools they had a big
ger reception. It would
have been nice if they
came when school was
in session."
According to
Carlsen, the ultimate
goal of the Education
Rising campaign is to
create a statewide stu
dent union based on
participatory democra
cy and participatory
budgeting modeled
after the city of Porto
Alegre, Brazil, which
takes a participatory ap-

proach to budgeting.
Upon arriving at the UC regents meet
ing, three members of the walking group
were given a minute each to speak in front
of the regents.
"We tried to convey that we want the
UC regents to take a proactive stance for
the students," Carlsen said. "They're the
ones appointed by the governor and that
dole out the budget, and they should be
working with us, which we feel that they're
not."
After the UCSC students met with Pub
lic Policy Leadership Institute students at
Stanford, they spent the night in vacant
rooms in Synergy.
"We had dinner — some potatoes and
rice they brought and some of our own
stuff — and chilled and shot the breeze
and then played music," said Vaughan.
"They had some guitars being toted along
in the accompanying car."
Carlsen said the walk could have been
better organized but was a good learning
experience.
"This is something that a lot of the kids
that walked want to do for the rest of their
lives — be activists, and this taught us a lot
about how things have to be organized,"
she said. "I can't wait to apply the things I
learned from that and next year I hope we
have an even larger and more successful
walk."
