### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With camping gear and guitars in
tow, students from the University of
California Santa Cruz spent a night
at Stanford nearly two weeks ago as
part of their 90-mile march to 14 dif
ferent Bay Area college campuses
to discuss the shortcomings of Cali
fornia's higher education system.
Spurred by decreased funding
for public higher education and ris
ing tuition, the seven students start
ed their walk on Sept. 15 at San Jose
State University, passed through
UC Berkeley and concluded their
trek at the UC Regents meeting in
San Francisco on Sept. 22. Along
the way, they stopped to speak with
students participating in Stanford's
Public Policy Leadership Institute, a
two-week long seminar sponsored
by the department of Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity, on
Sept. 16.
"This march was really just about
outreaching, because we know how
the budget cuts have affected our
education at UC Santa Cruz, but we
weren't sure how it was affecting the
education at other schools and com
munity colleges, so we wanted to
start a dialogue," said UCSC sopho
more Laurel Carlsen, who partici
pated in the walk.
State spending on higher educa
tion has decreased for the past two
years, and this is the fourth consecu
tive year that the UC system has
faced budget cuts. Students at pub
lic schools are now paying as much
as 40 percent more in tuition than
they were two years ago.
"At Santa Cruz our tuition has
gone up a lot, and a lot of the pro
grams like outreach to urban youth
and minorities were cut," Carlsen
said. "A lot of programs got cut, like
the writing program and the jour
nalism program, and it's hard to or
ganize clubs on campus."
Carlsen said many students at
the schools visited during the walk
