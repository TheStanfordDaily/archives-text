# Stanford Webmail switches to IMAP
## 
### JESSICA SHIN 
Webmail has been recently up
graded by Information Technology
Systems and Services simplifying the
two login options into one to become
a unified, full-featured e-mail client.
Although many students use Eu
dora or Outlook fora wider range of
options in e-mail configuration. Web
mail has been updated as of Sept. 20
to include spam filters and folder op
tions.
Previously, once a user accessed
Webmail, there was a choice of either
logging into "Regular Webmail" or
"IMAP Webmail." This distinction
confused many people, and as a result
of a survey conducted in 2003, ITSS
eliminated (he Regular Webmail op
tion and upgraded its features to sole
ly IMAP.
Former IMAP users are unaffect
ed by the new changes. Previous Reg
ular Webmail users now have the abil
ity to create folders, use a trash mail
box, save sent messages and set up
spam filters.
