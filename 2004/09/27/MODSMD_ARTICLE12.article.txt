19771 Daily enrages university
On September 27, 1977, The Daily ran a story about its own
controversy with the administration.
"University administrators expressed dismay Monday after
learning that confidential files, which the Daily reported on yes
terdav, were found recentlv in a desk which the University sold to
The Daily.
The Overseas Studies files, found some two weeks ago, relate to
such topics as student drug use and facility salaries. Among the
files are student medical files and a transcript.
Mark Mancall, director of overseas studies, said he 'honestly
can't say' how the strict University procedures over handling con
fidential files were passed.
Mancall said the transfer of the files was 'very, very strange.'
When told the files were in a desk which had been sold to The
Daily, he then questioned whether The Daily had legally come
into possession of the desk."
1990 I Stanford moves toward four-year housing
On September 27. 1990, The Daily ran a story on the construc
tion of Castano and Lantana.
"The University will move one step closer to its goal of four
years of guaranteed undergraduate housing with two additional
residences being planned for Manzanita Park.
The new residences, temporarily called 'Phase 2' and 'Phase 3,'
will stand next to the Kimball Hall site and are scheduled for com
pletion in the fall of 1992.
Private donations will comprise over two-thirds of the $12.15
million needed to complete the residences. According to Olivier
Pieron, project manager for the new dorms, several donors from
the Board of trustees have pledges about $8 million to the project.
After the projected completion of 'Phase 2' and 'Phase 3,' an es
timated 50 to 55 of the 95 Manzanita trailers will remain standing.
Pieron [project manager for the new dormsj said he believes that
the University will benefit from not entirely demolishing Man
zanita. 'Basically, what the trailers cost is their maintenance. They
are a very good source of revenue for housing and food services.""
