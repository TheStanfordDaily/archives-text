## Editorial Alcohol restrictions on Row upperclassmen unwarranted 
### 
This year. Residential Education prevented
upperclassmen on the Row from serving al
cohol in any of the common areas of their
residences during Orientation week. That
policy unfairly punished returning students and like
l\ did little to stop freshmen from drinking. Res Ed
should woik to prevent freshmen drinking during
( Mientation in manner that does not infringe on the
rights of other Stanford students.
Res Ed does have valid reasons for keeping Ori
entation diy. I he atmosphere that freshmen students
encounter the first week before school sets a tone for
i Ik- i est of the year. Having alcohol play a large role
or any role — in Orientation could detract from
Stanford's academic mission and alienate freshmen
who do not drink, as well as reinforce the belief that
one can only have fun when drinking.
112 urthermore, there is potential for real danger.
New students do not yet have a support group and
may or may not have prior experience with alcohol.
At this point especially, students who are insecure
ma\ be tempted to drink past their limit. A dry first
week allows some time for freshmen to acclimate
themselves to Stanford in a setting that does not in
volve alcohol.
I hat said. Res Ed went too far in enacting such a
stringent policy on upperclassman living in Row
houses. These students had to sign documents ac
knowledging that they were prohibited from hosting

formal or informal parties where alcohol is served,
and the week-long prohibition on alcohol extended
into the hallways and common areas of those resi
dences. But many of the students liv ing in these hous
es are legally entitled to drink. This approach unfair
ly puts the burden of responsibility on upperclassmen
when it should fall on the freshmen.
It appears that the rules were devised to avoid the
creation of a party atmosphere in which freshman
might be served alcohol. I lowever. there are more ef
fective means of keeping Orientation dry.
For example, freshmen could have been prohibit
ed from going to Row houses during their first week.
With a busy Orientation schedule, there is little rea
son for freshman to go to an all-upperclass house any
way, so this would not be a great inconvenience for
them. While even a solution such as this might not be
ideal, it would at least place the burden on the appro
priate people. And we still believe upperclassmen
should do their part to ensure a dry first week for
freshmen through steps such as not serving strangers
who might be freshmen.
The intent of this year's policy was to keep alcohol
away from new students. We agree with the spirit of
this effort, but not the means. Adopting an approach
that shifts the burden from upperclassmen to fresh
man students would have allowed those on the Row
to be able to enjoy a more festive environment while
more effectively limiting freshman alcohol exposure.
