# Editor's Note
## What is the editorial board? 
### 
/ believe that Ihe Stanford Daily's readers are
better served the more they understand about how
the paper operates. In my three years as an editor at
the Daily, / have noticed that the editorial board is
one of the least understood facets of the paper. Even
oin own staff members are not always clear on the
editorial hoard's role. The following is intended to
explain what the editorial board is, what it does and
n h \ it exists.

About The Daily's editorial board
At I he Stanford Daily, our news department in
loi ins readers about issues and events without taking
sides or pushing an agenda. Our news reporters
strive to discover the truth and convey it clearly, but
often they instead discover two or more competing
veisions of the truth, each with legitimate evidence
to support it. In these cases, they do their best to pre
sent ;i fair picture of each side of the story, regardless
of their own opinions.
Sometimes this is enough for readers to make
up their own minds. But other times readers may
want more interpretation of the news or more
guidance as to which of several conflicting argu
ments is the most compelling. It is with these read
ers in mind that The Daily's editorial board writes
its editorials, researching a given topic and then
expressing its informed views about who is right,
what policies would most benefit the University
and its students, or what should be done to make
things better.
I lie Daily's editorial board is separate from the
news department. The board is led by the managing
editor of opinions, and also includes the two opinions
editors and several editorial writers from diverse

backgrounds — none of whom is involved with the
paper's news coverage in any way.
The only person involved with the paper's news
coverage who sits on the editorial board is the editor
in chief, who according to The Daily 's bylaws has final
say over everything that goes into the paper. Howev
er, on the editorial board, he is a non-voting member;
he may offer advice and guidance and contribute to
discussions, but he does not write any editorials and
generally avoids trying to shape the board's stances.
The reason for the division between news and
opinions is so that our news editors and writers do not
have to take sides on controversial issues. Their only
goal is to inform, not to persuade. If they were asked
to do both, it could present a conflict of interest for
them and could undermine their credibility in the
eyes of readers.
As for members of the editorial board: Although
they inevitably have their own agendas and biases,
they arc expected to participate in the decision mak
ing and editorial-writing process with the best interest
of the broader Stanford community in mind. The
board makes its decisions by consensus whenever
possible, and by majority rule when necessary. Occa
sionally a member may write a signed dissenting edi
torial on a particularly divisive issue.
In an effort to understand and advocate for the
needs of all segments of the student body, the opin
ions department selects its editorial board members
with an eye toward diversity — both cultural and ide
ological — as well as reporting ability and knowledge
of the campus and its inner workings.
