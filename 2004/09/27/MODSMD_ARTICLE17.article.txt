# The 						Brooklyn Brat
## Summer of intern abuse 
### 
From the fiist day of kinder
garten to the first day of class
as a senior in college, some
things never change.
For one. it's the only time of year
when everyone is certain that they
will he getting straight A's come the
end of the term. Secondly, it's prob-

ably the only
time of year
when notes are
neat, students
are awake and
lectures are let
out early. And
most important
ly, it's the only
day when you
can be sure that

every conversation will begin with
the phrase, "What did you do this
summer?"
Since the bulk of us here at Stan
ford are overachievers, I can say
that I most certainly know what you
did last summer. You researched
fruit fly DNA with a world
renowned professor, created a new
clothing line for Nike, worked 60
hours a week as a consultant to se
cure a lifelong position at Morgan
Stanley, and sailed to Greece on
your 200-foot yacht just in time for
the summer Olympics, 111 which you
won seven gold medals.
While I must admit that I did
none of the above, I feel just as ac
complished as the Athens hep
tathlon winner, having not only
completed an internship which got
me more than a few positive eye
brow raises, but also having fig
ured out exactly what I want to do
in my life after Stanford.
No. I didn't fall in love with
writing and reporting the news,
and nor did I discover a hidden tal
ent for editing veibose columnists
while maintaining the integrity of
their voices, opinions, etc. My sum
mertime stint at a community
newspaper in Brooklyn made me
realize that when I grow up. I want
to take my $150,000 degree, slap it
up on a wall, and set up shop as a
professional intern abuser.
What other profession makes
years of pulling all-nighters more
satisfying than the one that gives me
the authority to rule over future
generations of overachievers? What
greater service is there to the com
munity than breaking down the spir
its of arrogant students who believe
that, with a 1600 SA I score, they
can draft a peace treat) for the Mid
dle East?

And finally, what better way to
repay present day ball-busters than to
create an opportunity for their chil
dren to suffer the slings and arrows of
an outrageous internship, like so
many of my friends this summer?
That said, as a bona fide intern
abuser. I would create the most ir
resistible internship positions that
boasted of free housing, excellent
networking opportunities and a
glamorous working environment
for which anyone would die.
Naturally, because of the pres
tige associated with working for
Athalie, Inc., none of my interns
would be paid. However, they
would he expected to pay for all the
coffee, lunch and dry-cleaning trips
they may take throughout the day
in an effort to keep me well-dressed
and properly fed and cafleinated.
Excellence does not restrict it
sell to nine-to-live; therefore nei
ther will my interns: who will be on
call 24 hours a day, seven days a
week. Their responsibilities will in
clude pre-ordering my meals be
fore even 1 know what I want to
eat, and hand-delivering my mail,
as 1 don't trust the postal service.
In case of illness, family obliga
tion or death, they will not be ex
cused from work. And.in the event
of a failure to show up for work for
any of the petty reasons listed above,
they would be promptly served with
a Donald Trump-style "you're
tiled'' â€” hand gestures included.
Being the fair person that I am,
I couldn't possibly mistreat my in
terns all summer long without any
rewards. They would have full ac
cess to office freebees (pens, sta
plers and all the yellow post-it
notes they can carry in their pock
ets). and upon completion of their
internships, they would all receive
glowing recommendations that
guarantee them their dream jobs as
professional intern abusers in their
respective fields.
After all. what is the point of all
of this abuse that we endure now (9
a.m. classes. 20-page term papers,
group projects and the like) if not
to ensure that one day we, too, will
gain the privilege to impose such
torture on someone else?

Athalie Laguerre loved her newspaper
internship this summer, and all exam
ples of intern abuse come from urban
legends, the experience of her friends
and the genius of her imagination. E
ntail her at athalie@stanford.edu to tell
her about your summer internship.
