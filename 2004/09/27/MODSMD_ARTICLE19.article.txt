Athletic Department should not try
to pass blame for halftime show
The Athletic Department is a
wimp for apologizing to Brigham
Young University and for apparent
ly leaning on the Stanford Band to
sanction itself for the Band's half
time show mocking BYU.
The Athletic Department knows
that the Band always mocks the
other school during its halftime
show What makes a school's reli
gious all illation and religious history
entitled to special protection against
satiie (Kitoimed in any context, let
alone a Stanford halftime show?

Is the Athletic Department afraid
that the BYU campus will be boo
hooing because we made fun of their
religion? The Athletic Department
needs to make a decision: Either
allow the Band to satire opposing
schools or don't.
And if the Athletic Department
is going to review the Band's half
time show script beforehand, the de
partment should either approve it or
not. It shouldn't approve the script
and then, like a coward, trash the
Band after it performs the show as
scripted.

USC fan cheers on Band
I'm an American teacher living
in Romania. I follow college foot
hall and recently read an article
ahout the "antics" of the Stanford
Band at the Brigham Young Uni
versity game. One of the main
reasons I left the United States is
because of superficial political
correctness.
The fact that five members of the
hand had on wedding veils is great.
Polygamy was practiced in Utah —
and still is in sonic parts — and the
Stanford Band, in their creative
way, was pointing this out. Why

should the University, let alone the
Band, apologize?
Look, I am a die-hard USC fan
Over the years the band has not
been too kind to the Trojans. Let's
go back to the O.J. Simpson case.
Remember the Homecoming King
and Oueen going around Stanford
Stadium in a white Bronco with
blood all over it? This may be mor
bid, but this is what makes the
Stanford Band so unique. All I
have to say to the Band is keep up
the great work.

Daily misses key developments
in Cardinal men's golf
The Daily's sports department
writes of the Stanford men's golf team
as if its writer attends C'al and has
never stroked a putt. Facts the writer
missed to share: The unusual makeup
of the Gold Rush was a tourney of 30
California teams — 180 players.
This young team, playing without
their veteran senior, Kevin Blue,
came within a stroke in the final
round of first-place UCLA. Scott
Mac Donald played head to-head
against UCLA senior star John
Poucher in the final round and heat

him 69-72, by 3 strokes. And he led
Poucher by three others until hole 13.
Last year, Mac Donald had two
fine finishes when given a chance to
play. The only surprise is that Stan
ford's longest driver hasn't been
given more opportunities to shine.
New coach Conrad Ray is inspir
ing confidence and a palpable new
team spirit in his players. TTie UCLA
Web site has a much more flattering
view of Stanford's feat in the Gold
Rush. Enough negative journalism.
Let's get behind this coach and his
talented players.
