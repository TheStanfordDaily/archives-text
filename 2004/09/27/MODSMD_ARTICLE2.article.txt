# Coming up short
## Cardinal blows halftime lead, loses to No. 1 USC, 31-28 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Oh, the things that could've been.
The Stanford football team took a stunning, 28-17
halftime lead against top-ranked Southern California
Saturday at Stanford Stadium but came up tantaliz
ingly short in the end, losing to the defending national
champions, 31-28.
It was an impressive evening, all in all, for the Car
dinal, who entered the game a 22-point underdog and
fell behind 10-0 in the first quarter. But the tears in the
eyes of the Stanford players and the head coach's
steely gaze showed that the Cardinal were not content
with a moral victory.
"I want them to be real disappointed with the loss,"
head coach Buddy Teevens said. "We had an oppor
tunity to beat a real good football team, and we lost."

Nonetheless, the Cardinal pushed the Trojans (4-0,
1-0 Pacific-10 Conference) all over the football field for
the last 20 minutes of the first half, outscoring them 28-
7 over that stretch. The Cardinal (2-1.0-1) outclassed
the most-respected team in the nation, running up the
score thanks to smarts, skill and determination.
"We played really well fora quarter-and-a-half,"
said quarterback Trent Edwards, who completed 20-
of-26 passes before the break. "But a football game
isn't a quarter-and-a-half long."
The Cardinal's impressive half was capped by J.R.
Lemon's gritty 82-yard touchdown run as time ex
pired at the end of the first half. The tailback ran a rou
tine play into the line, the kind of rush that both teams,
55,750 fans and a national TV audience all expected to
result in five yards and the end of the half.
Everyone except for Lemon, that is.
"I found myself just trying to avoid people and
run through people," Lemon said. "A couple guys
tried to tackle me and I broke through those and I

Redshirt junior Justin McCullum chipped in 36 receiving yards on five catches in the Cardinal's home game

jan defenders and hauled his 225-pound body
all the way to the end zone, somehow out

It was an improbable play, an "effort"
play if there ever was one, and it enabled the
Cardinal to hold a lead into the fourth quar
ter despite a second-half offense that man
aged just two first downs and 36 yards.
The Trojans opened a 10-0 lead in the first
quarter on a field goal and a two-yard touch
down pass from Matt Leinart to Steve Smith
that was set up Kevin Arbet's 66-yard inter
ception return. Then the Cardinal took over.
Evan Moore hauled in a perfect 3-yard
fade pass from Edwards for Stanford's first
touchdown, capping an 11-play, 79-yard
drive.
On its next possession, Edwards took the
Cardinal 76 yards in 15 impressive plays be
fore floating a 2-yard scoring pass to Patrick
Danahy.
Danahy had lined up as the first fullback
ma triple-I formation and headed out into
the flat untouched, one of several creative
play calls by offensive coordinator A.J.

cent defense with a variety of underneath
looks.
Stanford's next score was the most gutsy,
as it lined up fora field goal attempt on
fourth and two from the Trojans' 11-yard line
late in the second quarter. Holder Kyle Mat
ter took the snap and raced to the corner of
the end /.one, thanks to a crushing block by
tight end Alex Smith.
I lie Trojans showed a glimpse of second
half scores to come, though, marching 66
yards in just six plays to score on a 17-yard
lun by Reggie Bush just 52 seconds before
the half.
The Cardinal went in at halftime knowing
that I JSC' was going to mount a fearsome sec
ond-hall effort, and the defense fought hard,
but the offense wouldn't get close to the end
/.one again.
At halftime, Teevens told the team "that
[the Trojans] were gonna come out and
play," he said. "They're a great football team
and they have a lot of pride. We were gonna
have to play harder in the second half."
Stanford tried, but so did DSC. which
played a more inspired brand of football in
forcing four punts and a turnover on downs
while rolling up 224 yards of their own.

30 passing for 308 yards. "We know we're a
second-half team, and you can never win a
game in the first half."
A 51-yard pass from Leinart to Smith,
who finished with eight catches for 153 yards,
set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Leinart,
which brought USC within four points 12
minutes into the third.
Ryan Killeen prolonged the excitement
by missing a 23-yard field goal after Stan
ford's defense made an inspired stand deep
in its own territory, but with six minutes to
play, a 33-yard punt return by Bush set up a
3-yard touchdown run by LenDale White
that completed the scoring.
Stanford would record just its second first
down of the half on its last possession, but on
the next scries, Edwards' fourth-down pass
was just out of Smith's reach and the Trojans
were able to run out the clock.
"We never had any doubt, because we've
been in this situation before," Bush said.
"Stanford was a hard-fighting team, but I
think we wanted it just a little bit more than
they did today."
Stanford's defense never quit, though,
fighting the Trojans for every yard despite
USC's superior talent. The Cardinal sacked
Leinart for the first time since 2002 — Casey
Carroll did so twice — and didn't allow a run
longer than 17 yards.
"We were just securing our assignments
and responsibilities," safety Oshiomogho
Atogwe said. "We'd cut off [the ballcarrier's]
cutback lanes and he'd have to run into the
pile."
The Trojan players wouldn't concede too
much credit to the Cardinal — and indeed,
that's not really the sort of thing that nation
al champions tend to do — but head coach
Pete Carroll did have some praise for Stan
ford's effort.
"I thought that was a fantastic football
game played by Stanford today." he said.
" They came out of the box flying and they
gave us all we could handle in the first half.
Fortunately, our guys just wouldn't accept
it."
Stanford doesn't want to accept what hap
pened Saturday, despite the many encourag
ing signs it displayed.
"Deep in our hearts, we know we could
have beaten this team and have beaten this
team," Lemon said. "That hurts more than
anything."
Stanford will get a chance to ease the pain
this weekend at Stanford Stadium when it
hosts Washington (0-3, 0-1). which fell to
Notre Dame Saturday, 38-3.

It was an improbable play, an "effort"
play if there ever was one, and it enabled the
Cardinal to hold a lead into the fourth quar
ter despite a second-half offense that man
aged just two first downs and 36 yards.
The Trojans opened a 10-0 lead in the first
quarter on a field goal and a two-yard touch
down pass from Matt Leinart to Steve Smith
that was set up Kevin Arbet's 66-yard inter
ception return. Then the Cardinal took over.
Evan Moore hauled in a perfect 3-yard
fade pass from Edwards for Stanford's first
touchdown, capping an 11-play, 79-yard
drive.
On its next possession, Edwards took the
Cardinal 76 yards in 15 impressive plays be

play calls by offensive coordinator A.J.

Stanford's next score was the most gutsy,
as it lined up fora field goal attempt on
fourth and two from the Trojans' 11-yard line

tight end Alex Smith.

The Cardinal went in at halftime knowing

At halftime, Teevens told the team "that

second-half team, and you can never win a

A 51-yard pass from Leinart to Smith,
who finished with eight catches for 153 yards,
set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Leinart,
which brought USC within four points 12
minutes into the third.
Ryan Killeen prolonged the excitement
by missing a 23-yard field goal after Stan
ford's defense made an inspired stand deep
in its own territory, but with six minutes to
play, a 33-yard punt return by Bush set up a
3-yard touchdown run by LenDale White
that completed the scoring.
Stanford would record just its second first
down of the half on its last possession, but on
the next scries, Edwards' fourth-down pass
was just out of Smith's reach and the Trojans
were able to run out the clock.
"We never had any doubt, because we've
been in this situation before," Bush said.
"Stanford was a hard-fighting team, but I
think we wanted it just a little bit more than
they did today."
Stanford's defense never quit, though,
fighting the Trojans for every yard despite
USC's superior talent. The Cardinal sacked
Leinart for the first time since 2002 — Casey
Carroll did so twice — and didn't allow a run
longer than 17 yards.
"We were just securing our assignments
and responsibilities," safety Oshiomogho
Atogwe said. "We'd cut off [the ballcarrier's]
cutback lanes and he'd have to run into the
pile."
The Trojan players wouldn't concede too
much credit to the Cardinal — and indeed,
that's not really the sort of thing that nation
al champions tend to do — but head coach
Pete Carroll did have some praise for Stan
ford's effort.
"I thought that was a fantastic football
game played by Stanford today." he said.
" They came out of the box flying and they
gave us all we could handle in the first half.
Fortunately, our guys just wouldn't accept
it."
Stanford doesn't want to accept what hap
pened Saturday, despite the many encourag
ing signs it displayed.
"Deep in our hearts, we know we could
have beaten this team and have beaten this
team," Lemon said. "That hurts more than
anything."
Stanford will get a chance to ease the pain
this weekend at Stanford Stadium when it
hosts Washington (0-3, 0-1). which fell to
Notre Dame Saturday, 38-3.
Oh, the things that could've been.
The Stanford football team took a stunning, 28-17
halftime lead against top-ranked Southern California
Saturday at Stanford Stadium but came up tantaliz
ingly short in the end, losing to the defending national
champions, 31-28.
It was an impressive evening, all in all, for the Car
dinal, who entered the game a 22-point underdog and
fell behind 10-0 in the first quarter. But the tears in the
eyes of the Stanford players and the head coach's
steely gaze showed that the Cardinal were not content
with a moral victory.
"I want them to be real disappointed with the loss,"
head coach Buddy Teevens said. "We had an oppor
tunity to beat a real good football team, and we lost."

Nonetheless, the Cardinal pushed the Trojans (4-0,
1-0 Pacific-10 Conference) all over the football field for
the last 20 minutes of the first half, outscoring them 28-
7 over that stretch. The Cardinal (2-1.0-1) outclassed
the most-respected team in the nation, running up the
score thanks to smarts, skill and determination.
"We played really well fora quarter-and-a-half,"
