## Volleyball sweeps Wildcats, Sun Devils 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Pacific-10 Conference season began
last Thursday night at Burnham Pavilion for
the women's volleyball team. If their perfor
mance was indicative of things to come, it will
be a very good year for the Cardinal.
No. 12 Stanford (8-2 overall, 1-0 Pac-10)
beat the visiting No. 14 Arizona Wildcats (8-3
overall, 0-1 Pac-10) in a quick three-game
sweep. The victory was Stanford's first over a
ranked opponent in 2004.
Game one started out very evenly matched
as the Cardinal and the Wildcats swapped
points for the first half of the game. Tied at 16,
the Cardinal then put together a four point run
to open up a lead at 20-16 when the 'Cats took
a time out. The teams played back and forth
until a kill from Ogonna Nnamani made the
score 28-23 and Arizona took its second time
out. Stanford came out and closed out the
game on a block by Lizzie Suiter and Bryn
Kehoe, 30-23.
Game two saw the Cardinal pick up right
where they left off, opening up a 6-2 lead on a
kill by Nnamani. After an Arizona timeout,
Stanford scored twice more to make it 8-2 and

the 'Cats called for time again. Coming out of
the second timeout, Arizona pulled within
three at 12-9, but the Cardinal then rolled off
five straight points and never looked back,
winning game two as Suiter smashed down an
overpass to win, 30-26.
Game three was more reminiscent of the
first, with neither team opening up a big lead
until Stanford put together back-to-back
blocks to stretch its lead to five at 16-11. Stan
ford went back and forth fora while with the
'Cats after an Arizona timeout, but then pulled
away following a Cardinal timeout at 21-16.
Jenn Hucke hammered the final nail into the
coffin after a vicious cross court kill to win the
game, 30-22, and the match, 3-0.
Nnamani led both teams with 17 kills while
Kim Glass was the only Wildcat to reach dou
ble digits with 10 kills. Sophomore Kristen
Richards chipped in nine kills and 7 digs and
Jenn Hucke had 7 kills. Sophomore middle
blocker Lizzie Suiter tied a career high with 9
blocks and contributed 4 kills.
With that victory, Stanford has won five
straight matches and 12 straight games.
"They just keep getting better everyday."
Cardinal head coach John Dunning said.
"They're becoming more used to playing with

one another and have been very focused in
practice."
Not missing a beat, Stanford welcomed the
Arizona State Sun Devils to Burnham Friday
night and quickly destroyed them.
The match was never really in question, as
Stanford was able to dismantle the Sun Devils
in three games by scores of 30-21, 30-21, and
30-12.
Game one started out competitively, with
Stanford leading 13-12 in the early going be
fore a six-point run opened things up, punctu
ated by two blocks and a kill by Lizzie Suiter.
From there, the teams played back and forth
until a Sun Devil service error gave the Cardi
nal the opener by a score of 30-21. Arizona
State had eight service errors in Game 1.
Game two saw the Cardinal race out to a 7-
1 lead before Arizona State called a timeout.
The Sun Devils were able to tie the game at 12
on a service ace, but then Stanford went on a
10-2 run and didn't look back. Jenn Hucke
killed an overpass to take the second game for
the Cardinal, again 30-21.
Game 3 wasn't even a contest, as the Cardi
nal opened up an early 10-5 lead. That was the
