# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## Blame Spencer for near-miss 
### 
I blew it. It was me. I take all the blame.
Don't look to Evan, don't look to J.R.,
and certainly don't look to Trent. It was
me. I lost the game for the Stanford Cardinal.
I'm sorry, but it just all happened so fast!
One second. I'm watching J.R. trying to run
out the clock, only to find an 82 yard hole in
front of him, and the next, I'm crying, crying
because I know that my actions have led to

the demise of the Cardi
nal. Entrusted with keep
ing Buddy Teevens locked
up in a closet for the whole
of the game, I could only
make it halfway, and failed
this school.
Disagree? Check this.
Stanford dominated,
yes, I will use the word
"dominated," USC in the
first half. Everyone saw it,
even the yell leaders.

However, USC is a better football team
than Stanford.
Let me repeat this for emphasis, "USC is a
better football team than Stanford."
But don't necessarily read this as a bad
thing. So what? They have a better football
team? No big deal... Bill Simmons writes a
better sports column than me, but you don't
see me crying.
So here's the question: when faced with an
opponent who is obviously a better football
team than you, what should you do?
Play something else.
It's so goddamned simple. Play something
else. Checkers, chess, Yahtzee! Just don't
play football. Henry Rowengartner, The
Rookie of the Year, knew it. Once his arm
lost it's magical power to throw the gas, what
did he do in the biggest baseball game of his
life? He didn't play baseball! He threw soft
ball pitches and made the big hitter (I have
searched online for the last 30 minutes trying
to find what the guy's name was. but now I'm
tired and just don't care anymore) look silly
on stuff that little leaguers feast on.
Which is exactly what we did in the first
half. We didn't play college football, and we
made USC look silly. Fake field goals. Quick
