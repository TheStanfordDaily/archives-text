# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## Blame Spencer for near-miss 
### 
I blew it. It was me. I take all the blame.
Don't look to Evan, don't look to J.R.,
and certainly don't look to Trent. It was
me. I lost the game for the Stanford Cardinal.
I'm sorry, but it just all happened so fast!
One second. I'm watching J.R. trying to run
out the clock, only to find an 82 yard hole in
front of him, and the next, I'm crying, crying
because I know that my actions have led to

the demise of the Cardi
nal. Entrusted with keep
ing Buddy Teevens locked
up in a closet for the whole
of the game, I could only
make it halfway, and failed
this school.
Disagree? Check this.
Stanford dominated,
yes, I will use the word
"dominated," USC in the
first half. Everyone saw it,
even the yell leaders.

However, USC is a better football team
than Stanford.
Let me repeat this for emphasis, "USC is a
better football team than Stanford."
But don't necessarily read this as a bad
thing. So what? They have a better football
team? No big deal... Bill Simmons writes a
better sports column than me, but you don't
see me crying.
So here's the question: when faced with an
opponent who is obviously a better football
team than you, what should you do?
Play something else.
It's so goddamned simple. Play something
else. Checkers, chess, Yahtzee! Just don't
play football. Henry Rowengartner, The
Rookie of the Year, knew it. Once his arm
lost it's magical power to throw the gas, what
did he do in the biggest baseball game of his
life? He didn't play baseball! He threw soft
ball pitches and made the big hitter (I have
searched online for the last 30 minutes trying
to find what the guy's name was. but now I'm
tired and just don't care anymore) look silly
on stuff that little leaguers feast on.
Which is exactly what we did in the first
half. We didn't play college football, and we
made USC look silly. Fake field goals. Quick


Spencer Porter
slants. Lofted halls for 8'8" Evan Moore. It was
like we were third-graders playing at recess, and
the only rules were two completions fora first,
and OB runs are legal on a blitz.
And it was so simple! Ready, Set, Hike and
whip it to your best friend. No running backs, no
fly patterns, no outs.
Quick passes to take the defense out of the
game. If they press our receivers, make them
pay for one-on-one coverage; if they sit back,
throw the quick stuff.
We knew we were overmatched in the box, so
why fight it? Throw quick screens, isolate the
tallest guy on the field, and deliver.
And sure enough, suddenly it's halftime, we
have thrown a little deuce-eight up on the board,
and my buddy Steve is saying "Pete Carroll woke
up this morning thinking he was coaching the
New England Patriots."
But then, as soon as you could say "please
don't-change-the-game-plan," 1 averted my eyes
for one second, just one, only to see the coaching
staff emerge from the closet we had all. as Stan-

Cardinal drop aggressive approach
in second half; victory slips away

ford Students, locked them in.
The second half began, and we did the one
thing that could lose the game for us.
We started playing football.
Gone were the slants. Say goodbye to the
trickery. Adios to the home-crowd advantage.
Starting in the second half, we tried to kill the
clock and therefore lost the game. I mean, just
look at the stats. To start the third quarter, we
went rush,rush,rush,rush,rush,sack, rush. For
a net total of negative three yards.
Nobody wins football games by running the
ball seven times for negative three yards. It does
not happen. And things never got better. J.R.
ended up rushing 10 times for 96 yards: fantastic.
Until you realize that that really means 9 times
for 14 yards (thanks to the 82-yard TD) and you
want to vomit.
But do I really hate the Stanford coaching staff?
No, in all honesty, I don't blame them, either. We
did play cautiously in the second half, but if you
lose by just a field goal to the number-one team in
the nation, you've done loads of good. And to be

sure, some credit is certainly due to USC.
In the end. I was very impressed. This year's
team is a good one, perhaps even better than my
freshman year's Seattle Bowl-worthy team.
We played USC to the brink, forcing Trojan
running back LenDale White to fake a fall to in
duce a devastating pass interference penalty: "I
knew he was going to push me so I flopped,"
White said. "I gave it a little act."
I just felt like we had a chance, that the back
yard style of play was working, and that we could
take down the top-ranked team in the country.
Forgive me, 1 just wonder what could have
been.

Nobody wins football games by running the
ball seven times for negative three yards. It does
not happen. And things never got better. J.R.
ended up rushing 10 times for 96 yards: fantastic.
Until you realize that that really means 9 times
for 14 yards (thanks to the 82-yard TD) and you
want to vomit.
But do I really hate the Stanford coaching staff?
No, in all honesty, I don't blame them, either. We
did play cautiously in the second half, but if you
lose by just a field goal to the number-one team in
the nation, you've done loads of good. And to be

sure, some credit is certainly due to USC.
In the end. I was very impressed. This year's
team is a good one, perhaps even better than my
freshman year's Seattle Bowl-worthy team.
We played USC to the brink, forcing Trojan
running back LenDale White to fake a fall to in
duce a devastating pass interference penalty: "I
knew he was going to push me so I flopped,"
White said. "I gave it a little act."
I just felt like we had a chance, that the back
yard style of play was working, and that we could
take down the top-ranked team in the country.
Forgive me, 1 just wonder what could have
been.

I blew it. It was me. I take all the blame.
Don't look to Evan, don't look to J.R.,
and certainly don't look to Trent. It was
me. I lost the game for the Stanford Cardinal.
I'm sorry, but it just all happened so fast!
One second. I'm watching J.R. trying to run
out the clock, only to find an 82 yard hole in
front of him, and the next, I'm crying, crying
because I know that my actions have led to

the demise of the Cardi
nal. Entrusted with keep
ing Buddy Teevens locked
up in a closet for the whole
of the game, I could only
make it halfway, and failed
this school.
Disagree? Check this.
Stanford dominated,
yes, I will use the word
"dominated," USC in the
first half. Everyone saw it,
even the yell leaders.

However, USC is a better football team
than Stanford.
Let me repeat this for emphasis, "USC is a
better football team than Stanford."
But don't necessarily read this as a bad
thing. So what? They have a better football
team? No big deal... Bill Simmons writes a
better sports column than me, but you don't
see me crying.
So here's the question: when faced with an
opponent who is obviously a better football
team than you, what should you do?
Play something else.
It's so goddamned simple. Play something
else. Checkers, chess, Yahtzee! Just don't
play football. Henry Rowengartner, The
Rookie of the Year, knew it. Once his arm
lost it's magical power to throw the gas, what
did he do in the biggest baseball game of his
life? He didn't play baseball! He threw soft
ball pitches and made the big hitter (I have
searched online for the last 30 minutes trying
to find what the guy's name was. but now I'm
tired and just don't care anymore) look silly
on stuff that little leaguers feast on.
Which is exactly what we did in the first
half. We didn't play college football, and we
made USC look silly. Fake field goals. Quick

slants. Lofted halls for 8'8" Evan Moore. It was
like we were third-graders playing at recess, and
the only rules were two completions fora first,
and OB runs are legal on a blitz.
And it was so simple! Ready, Set, Hike and
whip it to your best friend. No running backs, no
fly patterns, no outs.
Quick passes to take the defense out of the
game. If they press our receivers, make them
pay for one-on-one coverage; if they sit back,
throw the quick stuff.
We knew we were overmatched in the box, so
why fight it? Throw quick screens, isolate the
tallest guy on the field, and deliver.
And sure enough, suddenly it's halftime, we
have thrown a little deuce-eight up on the board,
and my buddy Steve is saying "Pete Carroll woke
up this morning thinking he was coaching the
New England Patriots."
But then, as soon as you could say "please
don't-change-the-game-plan," 1 averted my eyes
for one second, just one, only to see the coaching
staff emerge from the closet we had all. as Stan-

Cardinal drop aggressive approach
in second half; victory slips away

ford Students, locked them in.
The second half began, and we did the one
thing that could lose the game for us.
We started playing football.
Gone were the slants. Say goodbye to the
trickery. Adios to the home-crowd advantage.
Starting in the second half, we tried to kill the
clock and therefore lost the game. I mean, just
look at the stats. To start the third quarter, we
went rush,rush,rush,rush,rush,sack, rush. For
a net total of negative three yards.
