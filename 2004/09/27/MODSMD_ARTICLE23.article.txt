# Men triumph over USC
## Card defeat No. 1 rivals, 9-8 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
An early lead; a come-from-behind attempt; a tight es
cape; two Olympians squaring off; stands full of fans; and
enough roughing between the players to satisfy both
freshman girls and bloodthirsty men.
The first of two Stanford men's water polo games this
weekend featured just enough of everything — including

a 9-8 Stanford win.
No. 1 Southern California (7-1, 0-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) and No. 2 Stanford (6-1, 1-0 MPSF)
battled so intensely for four grueling periods that some
fans at the Avery Aquatic Center felt the need to pro
claim this USC- Stanford match-up as the one to watch
Saturday.
Going into their first conference games, both teams had
a lot on the line. The undefeated Trojans came into Stan
ford with a new number-one ranking — the one they ac
quired when beating previously top-ranked Stanford 8-6
last week in the Southern California Tournament at USC.

The Cardinal, handed their first loss of the season that
day, came back and returned the favor, giving the Trojans
the first dent in their record.
There has been a growing water polo rivalry between
the two schools, who often duel to be the best in the na
tion. The highly talented Stanford women's squad (21-5)
was unable to beat the Lady Trojans (29-0) last year, and
the men's team has not had much luck against the Trojans
either. USC beat Stanford in the 2003 NCAA final, and of
the Cardinal's six losses in two seasons, five of those have
come at the hands of the Trojans.
Senior driver Tony Azevedo. who turned down post-
Olympics professional offers to stay for his final year on
the Farm, set the tone of the game before the clock had
even started to run down with an emotional speech to his
teammates at half tank. Less than two minutes into the
match, however, USC led 1-0 after senior Cameron
Kaiser scored.
The score hadn't even been displayed for 20 seconds
when Stanford began an explosive scoring streak. Four
consecutive shots by Azevedo, junior driver Thomas
Hopkins and senior two-meter Greg Crum fell into the
cage, and good defense and forced turnovers made the
score 4-1 in favor of the Cardinal.
Even after a timeout the Trojans seemed shaken. With
three men covering him, Azevedo was able to get Stan
ford's fifth goal when USC goalkeeper Don Ricci came
out of the cage too quickly and left the net unattended.
That seemed to be a wake-up call for the Trojan squad.
Taking advantage of a six-on-five opportunity, USC's star
sophomore two-meter Juraj Zatovic, who played for his
native Slovakia in Athens this summer, scored the Tro
jans' second goal. The Trojans came closer with two more
goals to make it 5-4.
Garton's goal attempted to stop the USC scoring run but
succeeded only fora few seconds before Shin once again
brought the Trojans within one. The back-and-forth action
continued as Stanford junior driver Peter Varellas scored
inside the four-meter with a man-up advantage and gave the
Cardinal a two-goal cushion to end the second half.
The next two periods were just as tense. USC's ball
skipped off the water past Stanford's junior goalkeeper
Chad Taylor. Varellas scored his second goal, fora total
of 15 goals on the season. Crum also got to the 15-goal
mark with his third goal of the game, putting the Cardinal
up to a more comfortable 9-6 lead as the defense did a
good job of grabbing loose balls.
The Trojans made a final push for victory in the
fourth. Shin scored his third of the match and a backhand
shot by USC once again brought spectators to their feet.
The scoreboard read 9-8; and there was plenty of time
left.
Unfortunately for the Trojans, a bad passing game ru
ined their chances of a comeback. Three consecutive bad
passes by USC gave the ball away, allowing Stanford to
conserve the win. The Cardinal, at last, beat USC after
five straight losses to the squad.

Taking advantage of a six-on-five opportunity, USC's star
sophomore two-meter Juraj Zatovic, who played for his
native Slovakia in Athens this summer, scored the Tro
jans' second goal. The Trojans came closer with two more
goals to make it 5-4.
Garton's goal attempted to stop the USC scoring run but
succeeded only fora few seconds before Shin once again
brought the Trojans within one. The back-and-forth action
continued as Stanford junior driver Peter Varellas scored
inside the four-meter with a man-up advantage and gave the
Cardinal a two-goal cushion to end the second half.
The next two periods were just as tense. USC's ball
skipped off the water past Stanford's junior goalkeeper
Chad Taylor. Varellas scored his second goal, fora total
of 15 goals on the season. Crum also got to the 15-goal
mark with his third goal of the game, putting the Cardinal
up to a more comfortable 9-6 lead as the defense did a
good job of grabbing loose balls.
The Trojans made a final push for victory in the
fourth. Shin scored his third of the match and a backhand
shot by USC once again brought spectators to their feet.
The scoreboard read 9-8; and there was plenty of time
left.
Unfortunately for the Trojans, a bad passing game ru
ined their chances of a comeback. Three consecutive bad
passes by USC gave the ball away, allowing Stanford to
conserve the win. The Cardinal, at last, beat USC after
five straight losses to the squad.
