# Men's soccer outdone

### JESSICA PETERS MANAGING EDITOR 
Spectators at Friday night's men's
soccer contest at Maloney Field ar
rived at the scene expecting to see
sparks fly.
No. 22 Stanford and No. 11 Santa
Clara have always had a rivalry on the
soccer field, as both programs often
encounter each other in the regular
season and then again in the NCAA
Tournament. But in the last year, the
rivalry has heated up:
The squads played to a 1-1 draw
last October that included 47 fouls
and a few months later, Stanford
edged out the Broncos in a spring
scrimmage that was even more physi
cal than the October match up.
But while fans started taking bets
on the number of fights that would
break out, the Broncos and the Cardi
nal had already made up their minds
about how they were going to play.
"Coming into this as players, even
we expected (the game] to be a little
chippy," senior defender Aaron

Maines said. "But both teams decided
when we got on the field that we were
going to play the game, play for pos
session. That ended up making it a
better game for the fans and for the
players."
The teams still combined for 43
fouls, but Stanford head coach Bret
Simon noted that the game was "phys
ical, but fair."
Though Friday's style of play was
much more suited to the Cardinal
than the heated clashes of months past
had been, the final result didn't suit
the team at all. The Broncos handed
Stanford its first loss of the year, 2-0.
Neither squad was particularly
dominant in the first half, with most
play being confined to the midfield.
However, it's been said that the
best teams are those that will capital
ize when their opponents make a mis
take. And that's precisely what turned
the tide of the game for the Broncos.
Santa Clara began challenging the
Cardinal back line early in the second
half, and when a defender's pass unintention
ally found its way to Broncos midfielder
Medhi Ballouchv in the 51st minute, he pun
ished Stanford with a shot that lined its way
right past senior goalkeeper Robby Fulton
and into the net.
The Broncos scored again in the 54th
minute, but Simon noted that it was that first
goal to break the tie that made all of the dif
ference in the contest.
Ballouchy, who Simon said is the most
commanding player that his team has taken
the field against this year, was one of two mid
fielders that effectively ran the Broncos squad
for the game, a system that clearly works for
the 2003 Final Four team.
In Sunday afternoon's game against
Brown, however, the Cardinal appeared more
like their normal selves, doing an impressive
job of maintaining possessions, though Simon
attributed the difference in part to the weath
er — it's tough to keep defenders pressuring
on the ball constantly in midday heat.
But despite the Cardinal's success at keep
ing Brown from getting too many good looks
at the goal, Stanford struggled to execute in
the top third and the match-up ended in a
scoreless double-overtime draw, Stanford's

Stanford falls to
Broncos at home, 2-0

second of the season.
"We've got to work on our decision-mak
ing in the final third," Maines said. "We only
had three shots on goal, and you can't win if
you can't score."
Senior forward Darren Fernandez led the
Cardinal with three shots in the scoreless
weekend, while Fulton had a strong second
game in goal, making five saves on the after
noon.
The Cardinal counted themselves lucky to
he continuing their tradition of tough
scheduling, as it is a good chance to face the
teams that they will run into come playoff
time.
"The top 50 teams in college soccer are
pretty even," Simon said. "And we haven't re
ally dominated anyone, but we haven't been
dominated by anyone either."
The Stanford Nike Invitational concluded
last night with a meeting between California
— which fought Brown to a 0-0 tie on Friday
night — and Santa Clara.
The Cardinal's homestand will continue
next weekend when the Golden Bears arrive
at Maloney Field for the start of Pacific-10
Conference play.
