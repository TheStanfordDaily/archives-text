### JESSICA PETERS MANAGING EDITOR 
Spectators at Friday night's men's
soccer contest at Maloney Field ar
rived at the scene expecting to see
sparks fly.
No. 22 Stanford and No. 11 Santa
Clara have always had a rivalry on the
soccer field, as both programs often
encounter each other in the regular
season and then again in the NCAA
Tournament. But in the last year, the
rivalry has heated up:
The squads played to a 1-1 draw
last October that included 47 fouls
and a few months later, Stanford
edged out the Broncos in a spring
scrimmage that was even more physi

But while fans started taking bets
on the number of fights that would
break out, the Broncos and the Cardi

about how they were going to play.
"Coming into this as players, even
we expected (the game] to be a little
chippy," senior defender Aaron

Maines said. "But both teams decided
when we got on the field that we were
going to play the game, play for pos
session. That ended up making it a
better game for the fans and for the
players."
The teams still combined for 43
fouls, but Stanford head coach Bret
Simon noted that the game was "phys
ical, but fair."
Though Friday's style of play was
much more suited to the Cardinal
than the heated clashes of months past
had been, the final result didn't suit
the team at all. The Broncos handed
Stanford its first loss of the year, 2-0.
Neither squad was particularly
dominant in the first half, with most
play being confined to the midfield.
However, it's been said that the
best teams are those that will capital
ize when their opponents make a mis
take. And that's precisely what turned
the tide of the game for the Broncos.
Santa Clara began challenging the
Cardinal back line early in the second
