# Cardinal hang zeroes on Denver, Marquette
## 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart has been
keeping busy between the posts all season
long, facing more than seven shots per
game. Under the lights at Santa Clara on
Friday, however, Barnhart did not touch
the ball once, thanks to a stellar perfor
mance by the Cardinal defense. No. 15
Stanford (7-2-0) held unranked Denver
University (2-6-1) to just one shot on goal
en route to an easy 3-0 victory.
The shutout was the Cardinal's fifth in
a row, after blanking the likes of Nebras
ka, Cal State-Fullerton and Yale.
Stanford and Denver were joined at
Buck Shaw Stadium by Santa Clara and
Marquette University for the Santa Clara
adidas Classic.
While Stanford's defense looked as
strong as ever, the offense also made
plenty of noise. The Cardinal scored three
goals on the night, two of which were as

sisted by junior defender Jenny Faren
baugh.
Stanford shot out to an early lead when
it scored its first goal just six minutes and
thirty-two seconds into the first half.
Farenbaugh made a clean pass to senior
forward Marcie Ward, who connected
with the back of the net for the goal.
Ward now leads the team with five
goals on just thirteen shots this season.
"It was a great pass and a great run,"
said head coach Paul Ratcliffe of the Car
dinal's first goal. "There's always pres
sure to win, so scoring an early goal helps
ease that pressure."
Stanford connected fora second time
in the 60th minute of play. Farenbaugh
was again in the middle of the action, reg
istering her second assist of the game with
a pass to freshman midfielder Lizzy
George.

dinal won in dominant fashion.
midfielder Shari Summers all but
sealed the deal, scoring the Cardi
nal's third and final goal of the
night off of an unassisted corner
kick.
Stanford put up a total of 14
shots against the Pioneers, its high
est total since posting against
Southern Methodist earlier in the
season.
Following the Cardinal's victory,
Santa Clara took the field against
Marquette University. No. 9 Santa
Clara faced mostly smooth waters
as expected, defeating the Golden
Eagles 2-0 with a game-winning
penalty kick by Tina Estrada.
Stanford returned to the field
on Sunday afternoon, this time fac
ing off against Marquette (4-5-0).
The Cardinal rolled passed the
(iolden Eagles, handing them a 5-0
loss.
While the Cardinal defense was
outstanding once again, it was the
offense's ability to keep the ball on
the opposition's side of the field
that ultimately wore down the
Golden Eagles.
"Overall the team played great
possession," Ratcliffe said. "We
weren't forcing the ball down one
side. We were being patient and
trying to find the right time to go
forward."
The Cardinal struck their first
blow 14 minutes into the first half
with a goal from Ward.
The play began with a corner
kick by sophomore Gina Farias-
Eisner towards Marquette's goal
box. Freshman April Wall redirect
ed the kick towards Ward, who
headed the ball into the net for the
score.
"It gave the team a lot of confi
dence so that we could carry for
ward from there," Ratcliffe said of
his team's opening goal.

With a one-goal lead, the Cardi
nal were able to continue attacking
the opposition. While the team
took several shots in the minutes
that followed, each one of them
went wide of the goal.
The Cardinal faced a scary mo
ment late in the first half when
Farias-Eisner collided with Mar
quette goalie Jessica Zetlau. Al
though she came up limping, Eisner
carried herself off of the field and
eventually returned to the action in
the second half.
While the Stanford offense man
aged only one goal in the first half,
it exploded after the break, adding
four goals to its total.
Eisner proved to be uninjured
from her collision, as she scored her
first goal of the season and the
team's first of the half at 54:58.
Less than five minutes later,
George found the net on an assist
ed corner kick from senior mid
fielder Amy Grady.
Grady would return to the spot
light a second time, after scoring
the Cardinal's fifth and final goal of
the game with just under ten min
utes remaining. Grady broke away
from defenders and won the one
on-one match with Marquette goal
keeper Katie Bissen.
"I think it was obviously a great
weekend for us," Ratcliffe said.
"We scored eight goals and our op
ponents didn't score any. We go
into our next game with a ton of
confidence."
Stanford was named the tourna
ment's championship team for the
weekend as Farenbaugh nabbed
tournament MVP honors.

ease that pressure."

on Sunday afternoon, this time fac
ing off against Marquette (4-5-0).
The Cardinal rolled passed the
(iolden Eagles, handing them a 5-0
loss.
While the Cardinal defense was
outstanding once again, it was the
offense's ability to keep the ball on
the opposition's side of the field
that ultimately wore down the
Golden Eagles.
"Overall the team played great
possession," Ratcliffe said. "We
weren't forcing the ball down one
side. We were being patient and
trying to find the right time to go
forward."

blow 14 minutes into the first half
with a goal from Ward.
The play began with a corner
kick by sophomore Gina Farias-
Eisner towards Marquette's goal

ment late in the first half when

quette goalie Jessica Zetlau. Al
though she came up limping, Eisner
carried herself off of the field and
eventually returned to the action in
the second half.

from defenders and won the one
on-one match with Marquette goal

Goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart has been
keeping busy between the posts all season
long, facing more than seven shots per
game. Under the lights at Santa Clara on

the ball once, thanks to a stellar perfor
mance by the Cardinal defense. No. 15
