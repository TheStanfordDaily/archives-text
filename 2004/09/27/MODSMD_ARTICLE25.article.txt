# Cardinal hang zeroes on Denver, Marquette

### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart has been
keeping busy between the posts all season
long, facing more than seven shots per
game. Under the lights at Santa Clara on
Friday, however, Barnhart did not touch
the ball once, thanks to a stellar perfor
mance by the Cardinal defense. No. 15
Stanford (7-2-0) held unranked Denver
University (2-6-1) to just one shot on goal
en route to an easy 3-0 victory.
The shutout was the Cardinal's fifth in
a row, after blanking the likes of Nebras
ka, Cal State-Fullerton and Yale.
Stanford and Denver were joined at
Buck Shaw Stadium by Santa Clara and
Marquette University for the Santa Clara
adidas Classic.
While Stanford's defense looked as
strong as ever, the offense also made
plenty of noise. The Cardinal scored three
goals on the night, two of which were as

sisted by junior defender Jenny Faren
baugh.
Stanford shot out to an early lead when
it scored its first goal just six minutes and
thirty-two seconds into the first half.
Farenbaugh made a clean pass to senior
forward Marcie Ward, who connected
with the back of the net for the goal.
Ward now leads the team with five
goals on just thirteen shots this season.
"It was a great pass and a great run,"
said head coach Paul Ratcliffe of the Car
dinal's first goal. "There's always pres
sure to win, so scoring an early goal helps
ease that pressure."
Stanford connected fora second time
in the 60th minute of play. Farenbaugh
was again in the middle of the action, reg
istering her second assist of the game with
a pass to freshman midfielder Lizzy
George.
