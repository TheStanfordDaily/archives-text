# Good signs abound in loss to Trojans
## 
### WILL OREMUS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
It's hard to say whether it's the new offen
sive coordinator, the maturation of an uncom
monly talented group of sophomores, or the
players' growing comfort within head coach
Muddy Teevens' system, but one thing was ev
ident Saturday at Stanford Stadium: This is not
the same (Cardinal team we've seen the past
two years.
The loss notwithstanding, Saturday's per

formance against No. I Southern California
showed that the Cardinal are Pac-10 punching
bags no longer. This is a team on the rise.
Teevens said after the 31-28 defeat that he
doesn't believe in moral victories. Still, he
couldn't deny the vast difference between Sat
urday's heartbreaker and last year's 44-21 loss
to the Trojans, when, in his words, "We got our
butt kicked."
The difference is "attitude, it's personality,
it's commitment, it's leadership, it's physiolog
ical maturation," Teevens said. "We've gotten

better."
In Stanford's brilliant 28-point first half,
there was trickery and there was luck, but
there was more, too. There was a level of
speed, teamwork and discipline that Cardinal
fans haven't seen since the days of Tyrone
Willingham.
There was quarterback Trent Edwards
confidently looping a touchdown toss to Evan
Moore as though no defenders were on the
field. There was junior defensive lineman
Casey Carroll slamming USC quarterback
Matt Leinart down in the backfield on two
plays in a row. For two quarters, there was an
anxious buzz in the USC crowd, jubilation and
surprise in the Stanford crowd, and a sense that
the Cardinal were outplaying the best team in
the conference, and maybe the country.
This wasn't a fluke. This was a close game
between worthy opponents.
In the end, the top-ranked Trojans, de
fending national champions, were clearly bet
ter. They were far stronger, and they were
more experienced. All of that showed in a sec
ond half in which they repeatedly marched
down the field while holding Stanford to 36
total yards.
But even in the second half, when Stan
ford's offense was stuck in either "park" or
"reverse" rather than "drive," the Trojans
didn't walk all over the Cardinal. Stanford
kept popping (JSC's receivers with big hits,
and while both the offensive and defensive
lines were overpowered, they never seemed
overwhelmed.
And they never expected to be over
whelmed.
Sophomore quarterback Trent Edwards
said he had been convinced that the Cardinal
would be able to pull off the upset.
Senior safety O.J. Atogwe was so disap
pointed with the loss, he could barely come up
with anything positive to say after the game.
"We feel like we only get so many of these
types of opportunities," he said, summing up
the team's frustration at letting a potentially
historic victory slip away.
Sophomore wide receiver Evan Moore ex
plained the team's feelings.
"Because of the way the general public
looks at football, (Stanford's effort] looks
great to them. People know we're for real, that
this is no joke.
"But from our point of view, we already
knew that, and we just really wanted to win
this ball game."
Surely the large Stanford crowd wanted the
same. But if a 3-point loss to one of the best
teams in the country is a disappointment, then
there could be a lot of joy in Stanfordville this
year.

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Trent Edwards came out gunning against USC, but the
Cardinal struggled to produce after the half. Edwards was 23 of 35 for 183 yards.
