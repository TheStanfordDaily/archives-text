# Academic Director joins Wilbur as part of freshman advising plan

### ALIYYA HAQUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Undergraduate advising at Stanford has undergone
many changes for the upcoming school year, most notably
the creation of the full-time position of Academic Director
for Wilbur Hall, which houses approximately 25 percent of
the freshman class.
Christina Mesa, who received her Ph.D. at Stanford in
the Modern Thought and Literature program, will be re
sponsible for bringing on-campus resources, such as those of
the Undergraduate Advising program and the Disabilities
Resource Center, into the residence hall.
The AD will complement the current dorm staff, which
includes resident fellows, resident advisors, head peer acad
emic coordinators and peer academic advisors. But, unlike
the AD, these individuals have other responsibilities since
they are also full-time students, faculty or staff.
"Students at this age are confronting so many decisions
that are integral to their adult lives," said Senior Associate
Vice Provost Carol Porter. "That's why it's such a relief to
have an adult presence in an advising capacity in the resi
dences with whom to talk through some of these issues. The
Academic Director will have an opportunity to really get to
know the students in Wilbur along with being a nexus for
other resources around campus."
Porter said that Mesa will also advise non-freshman
students, although her main responsibilities are toward
freshmen.
Still in its pilot phase, the AD post will expand to all Stan
ford residents if proven successful. University officials said
that this type of in-dorm advising program has been suc
cessful at other universities, such as the University of Penn
sylvania, Harvard and Wellesley.
"Student life is very much based in the residences, and
that's the place where ultimately students will reflect the
most about their academic needs," said Assistant Vice
Provost and Director of Undergraduate Advising Programs
Lorraine Sterritt.
Many upperclassmen, including students who were dis
satisfied with their freshman advising experience, are opti-

mistic about the AD program. Sophomore Zarina Zainul
Rahim, who lived in the Wilbur dorm Okada last year, felt
that an on-site academic director would have been a great
benefit during her stay in Wilbur.
"The advisor seems like a very convenient way to handle
most of your academic work," she said. "I would have prob
ably gone to see her very often, because it's a lot easier to see
one person than going all over campus, especially since stu
dents are so busy."
Helping freshmen focus on their academics outside of
the classroom has become a priority at Stanford. Recently,
the Office of Freshmen and Transfer Students was moved
from the Office of the Vice Provost of Student Affairs to the
Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education,
which oversees the undergraduate advising program. The
move was also an effort to consolidate services for freshmen
and transfers under one roof.
Some of the influences of this change were noticeable
during New Student Orientation week.
"This year, we weaved academic programming through
out NSO as opposed to leaving them as stand-alone pro
grams in contrast to more 'fun' events," said Dean of Fresh
man and Transfers Students Julie Lythcott-Haims. "Rather,
we want to emphasize that academics is part of the fun."
An example of this type of special academic program
ming that took place during orientation was the"Three
Books" discussion, which featured Stanford alumni authors
on a panel.
"We wanted to better prepare students for what they
were about to encounter at Stanford and to give them a clear
picture that pleasure and learning can be one and the same,"
said Faculty Director of Undergraduate Advising Steven
Zipperstein.
Reconciling advising and student life with the intellectu
al atmosphere that attracts so many to Stanford remains a
central role of undergraduate advising.
"We want students to realize that advising at Stanford is
so much more than just picking classes and fulfilling re
quirements," said Porter. "Advising goes hand in hand with
teaching, and research and is very much a part of the mission
of Stanford University."
