# Contrary to rumor, Full Moon on the Quad in four weeks
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY DESK EDITOR 
Throughout campus last week, it
was hard to miss the buzz that Full
Moon on the Quad, the annual gath
ering dedicated to freshman and se
nior saliva-swapping, was only a few
days away. After all, tomorrow
marks the first full moon of fall quar
ter, an event that for many students
has typically signaled the coming of
this highly publicized Stanford rite
of passage.
However, Associate Dean of
Students Nancy Howe set the
record straight to The Daily: "There
will be a Full Moon, and it's not this
Tuesday."
Rather, the event will take place
almost a full month later, on
Wednesday, Oct. 27.
For many eager freshmen, this
news may come as a letdown. But
they can take comfort in the fact that
this year, unlike last year, Full Moon
will actually take place on the same
day as the astronomical activity for
which it is named, according to ju
nior Joey Natoli, the chair of a com
mittee that examined last year's
event and made recommendations
on how to improve it for this year.
The misunderstanding about the
date of Full Moon on the Quad
forced some people to change their
social plans for the week. The Kappa
Alpha fraternity, working with the
Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, was
planning a pre-party for tomorrow
night, according to KA social man
ager junior Chris Bobel. They only
became aware of their mistake after
trying register the party with the
University.
Natoli and Howe also talked with
The Daily about changes that are
planned for the event to make it
more fun and less focused on alcohol
consumption. The biggest of these
changes is that this year, all of the ac
tivities surrounding Full Moon will
be organized through Absolute Fun,
a social programming board that
sponsors campus-wide, non-alco
holic events.
"We have not had one group of
people running Full Moon on the
Quad for the past five years," Natoli

said. "Now the leader will be Ab
solute Fun."
However, Howe recognizes that
the University will not be able to
prevent students from drinking, or
"pre-gaming," before the event, nor,
she says, will it attempt to. She said
that the same amount of security
that was present last year would be
available this year.
"The main issue is not whether
students choose to drink or not
drink, but whether they know they
don't have to drink or drink to ex
cess to have a good time," Howe
said.
However, she did admit that the
event has become associated with al
cohol, something she would like to
see changed. Last year, several stu
dents were hospitalized after having
consumed too much prior to arriving
at the Quad.
"In the last few years, some stu
dents perceived alcohol consump
tion as a goal in and of itself."
Both Howe and Natoli described
the linking of Full Moon to excessive
alcohol consumption as a "self-ful
filling prophecy."
Instead, Howe said the organiz
ers are trying to restructure Full
Moon as a "fun, zany, last-minute
event." She suggested that students
should use their creativity to have a
good time, like dressing up in out
landish costumes.
Natoli said that there would be
live music at the event this year and
that the organizers were looking
into carnival-like sources of enter
tainment, like a fire breather and a
sword swallower. He said that part
of the organizers' strategy is to pro
vide "watchers" — those who come
to Full Moon but choose not to lock
lips — with something else to do.
Sophomore Tania Juarez, who is
in charge of organizing this year's
festivities through Absolute Fun,
said that there would be a "freak
show" theme with entertainment on
three different stages.
Although Absolute Fun events
have often suffered from low atten
dance and negative word-of-mouth,
Natoli does not expect the organiza-
