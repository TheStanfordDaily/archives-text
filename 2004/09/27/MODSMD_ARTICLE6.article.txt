# GSC lobbies politician for tax relief
## 
### JENNY ALLEN 
Benjamin Franklin declared that
the only two certainties in life are
death and taxes. The Graduate Stu
dent Council is working to alleviate
the latter by petitioning a local con
gressman to throw his weight behind
a national bill that would provide tax
relief for students.
Graduate students would benefit
especially from the bill, called the
Higher Education Affordability and
Equity Act, because it would allow
them to keep more of their stipends
and to pay back their loans sooner.
The GSC petition, which was cir
culated at the Graduate Orientation
Activities Lunch and Information

Event on Friday, asks Congressman
George Miller of California's 7th Dis
trict, who is the ranking Democrat on
the Education and Workforce Com
mittee, to co-sponsor the bill. Mem
bers of the GSC view tax advocacy as
an important way to involve graduate
students in political processes.
"The petition is the first step to
ward increasing awareness of politics
and improving the quality of life of
graduate students by lifting financial
hardships that can derail the success
ful studies of the next generation of
world leaders," said GSC Deputy
Chair Roger Stanley, a second-year
student at the Graduate School of
Business.
The bill, which was introduced to

the House of Representatives by
Pennsylvania Republican Phil Eng
lish, contains a number of provisions
that can benefit students, according to
GSC Tax Coordinator Tom Lee, an
electrical engineering PhD candidate.
"The bill will increase the take
home pay of students by making the
room and board portions of fellow
ship stipends and R A and TA salaries
tax exempt," Lee said. "It also allows
more people to deduct student loan
interest from their income taxes and
removes the limit on how much can
be deducted each year."
Other graduate student organiza
tions in California, as well as The Na-
tional Association of Graduate and Profession
al Students, of which the GSC is an affiliate, are
also in support of the bill.
Last February, GSC Chair Moriah Thoma
son, a fourth-year neurosciences PhD candi
date. traveled to Washington D.C. to lobby for
congressional support of the bill alongside more
than 100 other graduate students.
During her trip, Thomason and other Cali
fornia graduate students met with representa
tives from both California senators' offices as

Grad students work with other Calif, students for tax relief

well as representatives of 10 California mem
bers of congress.
The GSC is currently focusing on California
schools for support. Earlier this month, the
GSC contacted student government presidents
throughout California to garner additional lob
bying momentum.
They asked the presidents to encourage mem
bers of their organizations to participate in a na
tional day of action on Oct. 20, when graduate and
professional students nationwide will contact leg-

islators in search
of co-sponsorship
of the bill. The
GSC Web site has
a link where stu
dents can e-mail
Miller.

According to Lee, Miller's support is essen
tial for the bill to pass. The 52 graduate students
who signed the petition on Friday sought to en
courage Miller to co-sponsor the bill.
"Tax relief is necessary because there is al
ready enough stress on students who are tapped
out financially," said Adelina Anthony, a grad
uate student in the drama department who
signed the petition.
Some students were initially concerned that
the bill would eliminate all taxes paid by graduate
students. However, after reading additional liter
ature on the bill, most opted to sign the petition.
"In general, 1 don't mind paying taxes be
cause even though I m poor there are other peo
ple with fewer opportunities than me," said
Salena Copeland, a first-year student at the Law
School. "I am in support of this particular bill

because it provides more exemptions to help
students pay off their loans."
The Graduate Student Programming Board
organized GOALIE for its seventh year at Stan
ford. GOALIE offered a "one-stop-shop" for
graduate students to view a range of student life
from administrative offices like the Vaden
Health Center to student groups including 19
religious clubs.
In total, students had an opportunity to
check out 80 campus organization.
"One key benefit of GOALIE is that students
can have personal interaction with university
staff and student leaders," said Associate Dean
of Graduate Student Life Christine Griffith.
Griffith also said she expects attendance to
rise next year. By that time, the GSC hopes to
have seen the tax relief bill signed into law.

the House of Representatives by
Pennsylvania Republican Phil Eng
lish, contains a number of provisions
that can benefit students, according to
GSC Tax Coordinator Tom Lee, an
electrical engineering PhD candidate.
"The bill will increase the take
home pay of students by making the
room and board portions of fellow
ship stipends and R A and TA salaries
tax exempt," Lee said. "It also allows
more people to deduct student loan
interest from their income taxes and
removes the limit on how much can
be deducted each year."
Other graduate student organiza
tions in California, as well as The Na-
tional Association of Graduate and Profession
al Students, of which the GSC is an affiliate, are
also in support of the bill.
Last February, GSC Chair Moriah Thoma
son, a fourth-year neurosciences PhD candi
date. traveled to Washington D.C. to lobby for
congressional support of the bill alongside more
than 100 other graduate students.
During her trip, Thomason and other Cali
fornia graduate students met with representa
tives from both California senators' offices as

Grad students work with other Calif, students for tax relief

well as representatives of 10 California mem
bers of congress.
The GSC is currently focusing on California
schools for support. Earlier this month, the
GSC contacted student government presidents
throughout California to garner additional lob
bying momentum.
They asked the presidents to encourage mem
bers of their organizations to participate in a na
tional day of action on Oct. 20, when graduate and
professional students nationwide will contact leg-

islators in search
of co-sponsorship
of the bill. The
GSC Web site has
a link where stu
dents can e-mail
Miller.

According to Lee, Miller's support is essen
tial for the bill to pass. The 52 graduate students
who signed the petition on Friday sought to en
courage Miller to co-sponsor the bill.
"Tax relief is necessary because there is al
ready enough stress on students who are tapped
out financially," said Adelina Anthony, a grad
uate student in the drama department who
signed the petition.
Some students were initially concerned that
the bill would eliminate all taxes paid by graduate
students. However, after reading additional liter
ature on the bill, most opted to sign the petition.
"In general, 1 don't mind paying taxes be
cause even though I m poor there are other peo
ple with fewer opportunities than me," said
Salena Copeland, a first-year student at the Law
School. "I am in support of this particular bill

because it provides more exemptions to help
students pay off their loans."
The Graduate Student Programming Board
organized GOALIE for its seventh year at Stan
ford. GOALIE offered a "one-stop-shop" for
graduate students to view a range of student life
from administrative offices like the Vaden
Health Center to student groups including 19
religious clubs.
In total, students had an opportunity to
check out 80 campus organization.
"One key benefit of GOALIE is that students
can have personal interaction with university
staff and student leaders," said Associate Dean
of Graduate Student Life Christine Griffith.
Griffith also said she expects attendance to
rise next year. By that time, the GSC hopes to
have seen the tax relief bill signed into law.
