# GSC lobbies politician for tax relief

### JENNY ALLEN 
Benjamin Franklin declared that
the only two certainties in life are
death and taxes. The Graduate Stu
dent Council is working to alleviate
the latter by petitioning a local con
gressman to throw his weight behind
a national bill that would provide tax
relief for students.
Graduate students would benefit
especially from the bill, called the
Higher Education Affordability and
Equity Act, because it would allow
them to keep more of their stipends
and to pay back their loans sooner.
The GSC petition, which was cir
culated at the Graduate Orientation
Activities Lunch and Information

Event on Friday, asks Congressman
George Miller of California's 7th Dis
trict, who is the ranking Democrat on
the Education and Workforce Com
mittee, to co-sponsor the bill. Mem
bers of the GSC view tax advocacy as
an important way to involve graduate
students in political processes.
"The petition is the first step to
ward increasing awareness of politics
and improving the quality of life of
graduate students by lifting financial
hardships that can derail the success
ful studies of the next generation of
world leaders," said GSC Deputy
Chair Roger Stanley, a second-year
student at the Graduate School of
Business.
The bill, which was introduced to

the House of Representatives by
Pennsylvania Republican Phil Eng
lish, contains a number of provisions
that can benefit students, according to
GSC Tax Coordinator Tom Lee, an
electrical engineering PhD candidate.
"The bill will increase the take
home pay of students by making the
room and board portions of fellow
ship stipends and R A and TA salaries
tax exempt," Lee said. "It also allows
more people to deduct student loan
interest from their income taxes and
removes the limit on how much can
be deducted each year."
