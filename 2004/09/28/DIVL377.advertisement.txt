Black Social Dance
Performance Workshop
Drama 157J (4 credits)
cross-listed in Dance, AAAS & CSRE
Mondays (Roble Dance Studio)
and Wednesdays (Roble 142)
7-9PM
taught by Aleta Hayes (Stanford, '91)
Princeton Lecturer, Choreographer, Singer, Dancer (most recently featured in this summer's New York
Shakespeare Festival production of Much Ado About Nothing, with Jimmy Smits and Sam Waterston)
This workshop will create a multi-disciplinary, site-specific performance at Roble Gym,
unlike any before seen at Stanford! Students will work with guest artists in social dance,
site specific installation, interview techniques and avant garde theatre. Material for the
performance will include interviews conducted in the community.
For more information,
contact Kim Fowler at 5-6739 or lizardl@stanford.edu.
This class is sponsored by the Committee on Black Performing Arts through our Resident Dialogues
program, funded by the Ford Foundation.
