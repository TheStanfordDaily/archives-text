# Election fever sweeps campus
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the presidential election
only five weeks away, Stanford stu
dents and student organizations are
launching aggressive get-out-the
vote campaigns, ranging from coordi
nating in-dorm registration drives to
providing educational information
online. These efforts mirror a nation
wide trend: Interest in the election
among 18 to 30 year olds has in
creased significantly since the Bush-
Gore battle of 2000.
Prominently linked from the
ASSU Senate's homepage is a Stan
ford-specific voter Web site for both
California and out-of-state residents.
Sophomore Omar Shakir, the ASSU
Senate advocacy chair, said the Web
site will also be linked to the Office of
Student Affairs and the Stanford
University homepages shortly.
"We've been working with Stan
ford in Government, student groups
like the Stanford Democrats and the
College Republicans, and communi
ty centers all summer," Shakir said.
The ASSU Senate plans to launch an
intensive, nonpartisan voter registra
tion drive this week, which includes
talking to students at house meetings
tomorrow.

By next week, registration tables
will be set up in White Plaza and out
side large lecture halls. For California
residents, the last day to register to
vote, in order to vote in the presiden
tial election, is Oct. 18. The deadline
varies from state to state; most states
set theirs 30 days prior to election
day.
Junior Bob Sensenbrenner, presi
dent of the Stanford College Repub
licans, said his group will work close
ly with the ASSU and will also plan
Republican events.
"We'll be involved in the physical
campaign — registering people to
vote is definitely a good thing," he
said. "Outside Republican groups

have contacted us about bringing
their campaigns on campus, and
we're happy to work with them."
The Stanford Democrats are
spearheading a nonpartisan get-out
the-vote campaign of their own — it
has enlisted 184 volunteers to serve as
hall captains to help register all eligi
ble student voters on campus in a
drive that began on Monday.
"It's more personal than tabling in
White Plaza," Kai Stinchcombe, a
graduate student in political science
and president of the Stanford De
mocrats, said of the hall captain pro
gram. "Everyone is on the ground,
and since the hall captains actually
live in the dorms, they know who
everyone is."
Stinchcombe predicted the strate
gy would also increase the likelihood
that registered voters will turn out in
large numbers on Election Day.
"Registration is only half the battle."
he said.
His statement is backed by find
ings of the New Voter Project, a $10
million nonpartisan research project
sponsored largely by the Pew Chari
table Trusts. The project found that
registered voters between the ages of
IS to 24 are less likely to cast a vote
than those over the age of 25. They
cite studies by Yale professors Don
Green and Alan Gerber that suggest
that young voters would benefit from
the kind of the peer-to-peer voter
contact that is currently directed to
older voters.
Green and Gerber estimate that
such direct contact effort could in
crease youth voter turnout by five to
eight percentage points among those
registered voters who were contact
ed, a significant increase considering
that there are currently 23.9 million
18 to 24 year-old Americans eligible

to vote, only 50.7% of whom are reg
istered.
John Hamilton, a junior co-lead
ing the Stanford chapter of Dem
Swingers, acknowledged the need to
increase turn out among young peo
ple.
"Being enfranchised isn't just
about being registered; it's about
being registered and then voting," he
said. "We connect swing state voters
with trained officers to make sure that
happens."
Dem Swingers, a national "adopt a
swing voter" group, was founded by
Stanford juniors Ben Elberger and
Adam Schwartz earlier this year and
is an offshoot of the special interest
group Americans Coming Together.
The Stanford branch "spent most of
the summer getting information
about each state's voting require
ments to form an extensive and ex
haustive toolkit to help absentee vot
ers navigate the process," Hamilton
said.
Schwartz, who stopped out this
quarter to work on political organiza
tions, is also the lead organizer of the
Baobabs Campus Lab Project, which
seeks to mobilize young voters and
"get out the progressive vote."
"A baobab is a tree that grows
with its roots going up, like grassroots
reaching upwards," Schwartz said.
The project's goal is "to be like the
Iron Chef of college organizing" by
"acting as a soundboard" — Baobabs
employees supply college activists
with all the tools and information
they need. "But we let them make of
it what they will because they know
their own colleges better than we do,"
Schwartz said.
527 political organizations (made
famous by the groups like
moveon.org and the Swift Boat Vet

eran s for Truth) like Dem Swingers
and Baobabs are required by law to
remain separate from national politi
cal parties and cannot explicitly en
dorse a candidate. Also by law. voter
registration drives must be nonparti
san.
Organizers must give out registra
tion forms in their possession to all
who ask, regardless of their political
affiliation, but they are not obligated
to offer forms to everyone. Organiz
ers cannot fill out any part of the form
for the voter or instruct the voter to
choose a particular party.
The efforts of student groups and
universities are motivated by both pa
triotic and legal duty; universities that
receive federal funding are required
by the Higher Education Act of 1998
to commit to a "good faith effort to
distribute a mail voter registration
form" to each student and to "make
such forms widely available to stu
dents at the institution."
A joint study recently conducted
by the Institute of Politics at Har
vard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government and the Chronicle of
Higher Education found that only
16.9 percent of universities meet the
strict standards of the law, but "about
two-thirds are at least meeting the
spirit of the law, which is terrific," said
David King, a Harvard public policy
professor and a research director at
the Institute, in an interview.
According to King, Stanford is in
compliance with the spirit of the law
"by having physical registration
forms on campus" and "by having a
voter registration drive anywhere on
campus" in advance of the election.
The voter registration drive does not
have to be initiated by the University.
King applauded specific voter out
reach measures enacted by Stanford's

ASSU — such as putting registration
forms in freshman and new graduate
student welcome packets, and ad
dressing the issue of absentee voting,
for example. He encouraged the Uni
versity to continue to go above and
beyond the dictates of the law.
"Universities are not required to
help register absentee voters but they
should," he said.
The excitement at Stanford sur
rounding this year's election may
prove to be part of a larger trend na
tionwide. Surveys this year show that
young voters are more interested in
the election than they've been in
decades, the New York Times report
ed earlier this month. Youth voter in
terest is close to the highest level it has
reached at any time since the voting
age was lowered to 18 in 1972, it re
ported.
Polls conducted by Harvard's
John F. Kennedy School of Govern
ment have shown that in September
of 2000,25 percent of those surveyed
said they had spoken to someone
about the election in the last 24 hours.
When the same question was asked
this September, that figure doubled.

Junior Bob Sensenbrenner, presi

"We'll be involved in the physical
campaign — registering people to

said. "Outside Republican groups

have contacted us about bringing
their campaigns on campus, and
we're happy to work with them."
The Stanford Democrats are
spearheading a nonpartisan get-out
the-vote campaign of their own — it
has enlisted 184 volunteers to serve as
hall captains to help register all eligi
ble student voters on campus in a
drive that began on Monday.
"It's more personal than tabling in
White Plaza," Kai Stinchcombe, a
graduate student in political science
and president of the Stanford De
mocrats, said of the hall captain pro
gram. "Everyone is on the ground,
and since the hall captains actually
live in the dorms, they know who
everyone is."
Stinchcombe predicted the strate
gy would also increase the likelihood
that registered voters will turn out in
large numbers on Election Day.
"Registration is only half the battle."
he said.
His statement is backed by find
ings of the New Voter Project, a $10
million nonpartisan research project
sponsored largely by the Pew Chari
table Trusts. The project found that
registered voters between the ages of
IS to 24 are less likely to cast a vote
than those over the age of 25. They
cite studies by Yale professors Don
Green and Alan Gerber that suggest
that young voters would benefit from
the kind of the peer-to-peer voter
contact that is currently directed to
older voters.
Green and Gerber estimate that
such direct contact effort could in
crease youth voter turnout by five to
eight percentage points among those
registered voters who were contact
ed, a significant increase considering
that there are currently 23.9 million
18 to 24 year-old Americans eligible

to vote, only 50.7% of whom are reg
istered.
John Hamilton, a junior co-lead
ing the Stanford chapter of Dem
Swingers, acknowledged the need to
increase turn out among young peo
ple.
"Being enfranchised isn't just
about being registered; it's about
being registered and then voting," he
said. "We connect swing state voters
with trained officers to make sure that
happens."
Dem Swingers, a national "adopt a
swing voter" group, was founded by
Stanford juniors Ben Elberger and
Adam Schwartz earlier this year and
is an offshoot of the special interest
group Americans Coming Together.
The Stanford branch "spent most of
the summer getting information
about each state's voting require
ments to form an extensive and ex
haustive toolkit to help absentee vot
ers navigate the process," Hamilton
said.
Schwartz, who stopped out this
quarter to work on political organiza
tions, is also the lead organizer of the
Baobabs Campus Lab Project, which
seeks to mobilize young voters and
"get out the progressive vote."
"A baobab is a tree that grows
with its roots going up, like grassroots
reaching upwards," Schwartz said.
The project's goal is "to be like the
Iron Chef of college organizing" by
"acting as a soundboard" — Baobabs
employees supply college activists
with all the tools and information
they need. "But we let them make of
it what they will because they know
their own colleges better than we do,"
Schwartz said.
527 political organizations (made
famous by the groups like
moveon.org and the Swift Boat Vet

eran s for Truth) like Dem Swingers
and Baobabs are required by law to
remain separate from national politi
cal parties and cannot explicitly en
dorse a candidate. Also by law. voter
registration drives must be nonparti
san.
Organizers must give out registra
tion forms in their possession to all
who ask, regardless of their political
affiliation, but they are not obligated
to offer forms to everyone. Organiz
ers cannot fill out any part of the form
for the voter or instruct the voter to
choose a particular party.
The efforts of student groups and
universities are motivated by both pa
triotic and legal duty; universities that
receive federal funding are required
by the Higher Education Act of 1998
to commit to a "good faith effort to
distribute a mail voter registration
form" to each student and to "make
such forms widely available to stu
dents at the institution."
A joint study recently conducted
by the Institute of Politics at Har
vard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government and the Chronicle of
Higher Education found that only
16.9 percent of universities meet the
strict standards of the law, but "about
two-thirds are at least meeting the
spirit of the law, which is terrific," said
David King, a Harvard public policy
professor and a research director at
the Institute, in an interview.
According to King, Stanford is in
compliance with the spirit of the law
"by having physical registration
forms on campus" and "by having a
voter registration drive anywhere on
campus" in advance of the election.
The voter registration drive does not
have to be initiated by the University.
King applauded specific voter out
reach measures enacted by Stanford's

ASSU — such as putting registration
forms in freshman and new graduate
student welcome packets, and ad
dressing the issue of absentee voting,
for example. He encouraged the Uni
versity to continue to go above and
beyond the dictates of the law.
"Universities are not required to
help register absentee voters but they
should," he said.
The excitement at Stanford sur
rounding this year's election may
prove to be part of a larger trend na
tionwide. Surveys this year show that
young voters are more interested in
the election than they've been in
decades, the New York Times report
ed earlier this month. Youth voter in
terest is close to the highest level it has
reached at any time since the voting
age was lowered to 18 in 1972, it re
ported.
Polls conducted by Harvard's
John F. Kennedy School of Govern
ment have shown that in September
of 2000,25 percent of those surveyed
said they had spoken to someone
about the election in the last 24 hours.
When the same question was asked
this September, that figure doubled.

With the presidential election
only five weeks away, Stanford stu
dents and student organizations are
launching aggressive get-out-the
vote campaigns, ranging from coordi
nating in-dorm registration drives to
providing educational information
online. These efforts mirror a nation
wide trend: Interest in the election
among 18 to 30 year olds has in
creased significantly since the Bush-
Gore battle of 2000.
