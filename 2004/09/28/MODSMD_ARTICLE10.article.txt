1990 I Grad student victim of homicide
On Sept. 28, 1990, The Stanford Daily ran a story about the
murder of a Stanford graduate student living off campus.
"Gurmeet S. Shergill, a 36-year-old honors graduate student in
engineering, was fatally stabbed Sunday evening outside his Sun
nyvale home, police said yesterday.
Three youths followed Shergill home after an argument in a
McDonald's restaurant on El Camino Real and Bernardo Av
enue, Sunnyvale police said.
Police said about half an hour passed before the suspects, de
scribed as three Latino men between the ages of 16 and 20, at
tacked and stabbed Shergill as he got out of his car.
Sunnyvale Police Capt. James Brice was in the restaurant when
the argument broke out. Brice said he heard Shergill ask the
youths, who were in front of him in line, to place their order.
Shergill died of stab wounds to the chest and abdomen on the
way to Valley Medical Center.
Sinclair described Shergill as 'a very quiet individual, the sort of
person you wouldn't expect to get into that situation.'"
19931 Title IX forces self-defense course cut
On Sept. 28, 1993. The Stanford Daily ran a story about Femi
nist Studies canceling its self-defense course because it was
charged for violating Title IX:
"The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights
notified the University of possible violations after receiving an
anonymous complaint in mid-August agaist the course, titled is
sues in Self-Defense for Women.'
For the past few weeks, the Feminist Studies Department and
the Women Defending Ourselves Collective — who sponsor and
teach the course, respectively — have been scrambling to change
the course to comply with the Title IX anti-discrimination statutes.
But the collective decided last week to pull the course until a
suitable format could be arranged.
According to Assoc. University Counsel Iris Brest, the un
named complaint alleged discrimination because the class was of
fered to two sections limited by sex. and because the men's section
did not include the physical self-defense component."
