Contrary to popular belief, the
words "neutronic decay" and
"particle waveform" are no
longer the exclusive jargon of
physicists. Walk into an art exhib
it and you may very well find
quantum phenomena explained
there just as well as in your
physics textbook.
Dawn Meson is one such artist.
In her recent works, she has been
attempting to paint the quantum
world. According to Meson, her
latest pieces "explore the tiny
quantum phenomena that per
vade our everyday world."
Meson's series of paintings en
titled "Temporal Explorations:

Sum of Histories," is currently on
exhibit at the halls of the Research
Office Building at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center. The
collection will be on exhibit until
this Friday.
The artwork depicts physical
phenomena that are theoretically
understood but cannot be seen
directly. For example, in a paint
ing called "Entanglement,"
Meson tries to portray the occur
rence of opposite spins. When
two isolated particles interact
with each other, the opposite
spins phenomenon takes place:
The spin of the second particle is
always opposite in spin to the
first particle, regardless of their
relative locations.
Meson's exhibition is unique

and daring not only in its theme
but also in its presentation style.
Typical art exhibits involve only
static displays of paintings, so the
viewer only sees the final result of
the exhibit and not its different
stages of progress from beginning
to end.
The pieces in Meson's exhibi
tion. however, are not merely
standard stand-alone paintings.
Each is accompanied by a video,
which captures the piece of art at
different steps in the process of its
creation. Thus, the viewer not
only gets to see the final version of
the painting, but also how the
painting looked at each stage of
her work on the piece.
Meson is undaunted by con
flicting scientific outlooks on
physical processes. Two of her
paintings, both called "Neutronic
Decay," appear entirely different,
since they each represent a differ
ent understanding of the neutron
ic decay phenomenon.
One of the pieces is a portrayal
of neutronic decay based on the
Standard Model. The Standard
Model explains the interaction of
fundamental particles as elemen
tary elements of matter.
The second painting is a por
trayal of neutronic decay based on

String Theory, which describes el
ementary particles as tiny one-di
mensional objects — or strings —
rather than zero-dimensional
points.
Meson presents these paintings
as animations of a sort.
"Each stage of the painting
mirrors the process by which such
decay is described in each theo
ry," she said.
Another of Meson's tech
niques is to use color, translucen
cy, textures and shape to symbol
ize complexities at the subatomic
level.
One of her works, "Particle
Waves," is based on the wave
particle duality of tiny subatomic
phenomena. Different colors and
opacities in this painting repre
sent the different levels of proba
bility of "where" in quantum di
mensions this particle is.
A piece called "Waveform" de
picts the notion of a wave function
on the edge of collapse. Accord
ing to Meson, "Lighter shades are
used to indicate higher probabili
ties of the wave's location at the
point which it is measured."
Meson sees a parallel between
theoretical physics and religion:
Each one is a "meticulously
framed description of a largely in

visible reality that is seen and in
terpreted by a few."
To convey this, Meson uses col
ors and lines to create the image
of stained-glass windows.
Meson's boldness and creativi
ty can be seen through the diver
sity of subjects that she employs
in her paintings. Apart from theo
retical physics. Meson has paint
ed deep sea creatures as well as
life drawings.
Meson has also held a number
of art exhibitions in San Francis
co. Some of these include "The
Art of Burning Man," held in
July 1998 at the San Francisco
Arts Commission Gallery, and
"Women's Sensual and Erotic
Art", which was held in February
2000 in the Mission Badlands

Gallery.
Professionally, Meson has
gained a diverse set of experi
ences. She has been a set design
er at a summer theatre program,
a mentor, and an art instructor
for various organizations includ
ing the New Generations Health
Center in San Francisco, the
California Arts Council and the
Palo Alto Arts Foundation. She
has even been to Capetown,
South Africa, to be a visiting art
instructor fora community art
project.
Currently, she is an art in
structor for the Palo Alto Chil
dren's Summer Art Program.
She is also an illustrator and de
signer for various clients and
publications.
