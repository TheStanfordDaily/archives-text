# Another way to beat Cat: Stanford alums shoot for the moon
## 
### SU FEN LEE DESK EDITOR 
In 10 years' time, Stanford
may own a dish not only in the
foothills, but also on the moon.
Perhaps even further into the fu
ture, the moon may join the
ranks of Oxford, Paris and Flo
rence as one of the exotic desti
nations of the Stanford Overseas
Program.
A group of past Stanford stu
dents are organizing the Stanford
Alumni Moon Project, with the
goal of "creating a significant
lunar presence" for Stanford
University by 2015.
According to the group's Web
site, "The Stanford University
community of students, profes
sors, scientists and administra
tors will be at the forefront of any
new and ongoing lunar research
and development."
Many academic disciplines will
be involved, including physics, en
gineering, aeronautics, astronau
tics, astronomy, geology, chem
istry, biology and others.
Possibilities range "from
sophomore seminars to satellite
engineering, biosphere studies to
telemedicine, telerobotics to

radio telescopes."
More immediately, the project
will focus on commercial, scien
tific, educational and interna
tional enterprises. For the alumni
community, the Stanford Alumni
Moon Project believes that this is
"a unique and unprecedented op
portunity and responsibility to
explore and develop our nearest
neighbor."
The group's proposal for the
"Stanford on the Moon" mission
was posted on the Web site of
Space Age Publishing Company,
which produces newsletters re
garding the space industry.
Dubbed as "Your Internet source
for the latest global space news,"
the organization, located in Palo
Alto, was founded and owned by
Steve Durst, Class of 1965.
Durst first raised the idea of
"Stanford on the Moon" to his
Class of 1965 at his 35-year Re
union panel in October 2000.
Since then, his vision has attract
ed alumni, professors and media
communicators.
An exploratory committee for
the Stanford Alumni Moon Pro
ject was formed within 18
months. In May 2002, a group
from this committee visited the

Stanford campus to explore ini
tiatives with various Stanford de
partments. These included the
Overseas Studies Program Of
fices, the University President's

Office, the Stanford Alumni As
sociation Center and the Stan
ford Dish.
In April of last year, the ex
ploratory committee participated

in a discussion on how to publi
cize the Stanford Alumni Moon
Project to the larger Stanford
community. Stanford alumni
Steve Durst, Jim McCotter,

Kristi Nelson, Ruth Richards,
Chia Tze, Sharon Swinyard and
Bill Brown attended the discus
sion. Also present were Greg Ne
mitz of Orbital Development and

Jennifer Valcov of Space Age
Publishing Company.
Most of the Stanford alumni
involved in this project are from
Durst's Class of 1965. They were
"the generation that entered the
University with the New Fron
tier's promise of the stars and the
moon," as the organization's
press release explains.
A mission to the moon could
possibly "provide laboratory
hands-on learning," according to
Durst's organization, "giving stu
dents, faculty and alumni an op
portunity to engage in a multidis
ciplinary, cooperative approach
to real world problem solving â€”
a skill which certainly any educa
tional institution aims to instill in
its students."
Telerobotics, which allows op
erators on earth to control the ac
tivities of robots on the moon,
will play a key role in such a mis
sion. Other sophisticated robots
will also be needed to construct a
base facility on the moon. A radio
observatory and a dish could also
be set up on the moon
Durst suggested that Stanford
could also set up a Moon Society
chapter, or establish a Lunar
Studies Institute to promote

more academic lunar research.
But the project has larger
goals as well: "The Moon project
could also inspire new genera
tions of Stanford students to
excel in leading edge science,
business and law, by providing a
new arena of activities, on the
Moon," according to Durst.
It may be too early to tell what
the exact outcome of the "Stan
ford on the Moon" project will
be. But one thing is for sure:
Echoing the words of Durst's or
ganization, Stanford's participa
tion in such an unprecedented
initiative is a clear reflection of
"Stanford's pioneering, enter
prising ethos in bringing us face
to face with the implication of
humanity's evolution to a multi
world species," according to pro
ject's coordinators.
This Saturday, from 9-11:30
a.m., Durst is organizing a "Stan
ford on the Moon" symposium.
The agenda does not only include
discussion of both long term and
intermediary goals. Guest speak
ers will also be presenting their
lunar mission proposals. Open to
the public, it will be held in the
Cypress Room at Tresidder
Memorial Union.
