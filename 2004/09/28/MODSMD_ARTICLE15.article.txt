Hi igliain »iung I Iniversity a wcek-and-a hall
ago But tlu Stanford Athletic Department was right in
not imposmi' any sanctions on the Band despite the de
partment's decision to apologize publicly to BYU. It is
cncouiaging tli.it the I nivei at\ lelt it could leave the
sanctioning process up to the Band, although we do not
believe that any sanctions imposed externally or by
the Band on itself were necessary.
I he Band s halftimc show script had been previous
ly icv le wed and approved by the Athletic Department,
but BYU outrage over the skit in which Band assistant
manager loin llennessy pretended to marry all five
I Jollies caused both the Band and the Athletics De
partment to dispute exactly what had been intended in
the text of the script. Arguments revolved around how
the announce! was supposed to stutter the line about
the sacred bond "between a man and woman .. . (stut
ter)." Athletic Department officials said they were
under the impression the word "woman" should have
been partially stuttered as "wo-" in the sentence,
whereas Band officials maintained that they thought it
was deal the sciipted stutter would involve repeating
the whole phrase "and woman" over and over again.
It is understandable that the Athletic Department
might not have assumed th.it the entire phrase would be
repeated liyc times, alluding to the practice* of
polygamy. However, the subsequent line in the sciipt
"I Jollies inai iy I'om" should have been clear enough for
I i n\e i sit v officials to recognize the Band's intent to re I
eieiic'L polygamy.
Since the Department reviewed and approved the
sciipt, and the text clearly enough indicated the insinua
tion ul polvgainv. ii would have been inappropriate for the-
Band to Ik* punished as a result of a misunderstanding on
(lie part of the Athletic Department, despite the Band's
compliance with requited procedures.
Some suspect that the Band was pressured or encour
aged by the Athletic Department to sell sanction and

offer an apology through an implicit threat that the Band
would be sanctioned by Stanford if it did not take such
steps on its own. The Band's act of apologizing and sanc
tioning itself certainly did divert attention in the nation
al media from the fact that the Athletic Department oiig
inally decided to approve the script. However, the Band
and the Athletic Department have both adamantly de
nied such speculation. If such a tacit arrangement were
the case, we would strongly disapprove, but we tiust that
the Band's decision was indeed made independent of any
pressure — express or implied — from the University.
But even if the script had not been reviewed before
hand by the Athletic Department, the Band's actions
would still not merit sanctions. Ihe Band is renowned
for its tendency to satirize groups of all denominations.
Generally, the Band's antics are not carried out in the
spirit of malice, but rather — as its members have sinii
larly insisted in this situation — in the interest ol good
humor. That was the case in this incident as well.
While some BYU fans or members of the Mormon
faith might have taken offense at the stereotyj>e iterated
in the show, such lighthearted stereotypes are a fairly in
tegral component of most comedy. II the Band went out
of its way to single out a specific ethnic or religious group,
rather than equally distributing its humor and poking fun
at all groups, we would then agree that there was a prob
lem. But that has not been the case. And this incident did
not cross the line from liom being humorous to being ex
cessively negative or objectionable.
The Band has always been, and will always be, a
lightning rod for controversy on campus. However, so
long as the Band pursues its humor in a balanced man
ner and does not overly target any specific groups or in
dividuals. such jokes should be seen as little more than
that jokes. And as long as the Athletic Department
opts lt> review and approve field show scripts before
they run, provided the intent and manner in which the
script will be performed is relatively clear, it would be a
shame for the Band to be punished despite meeting its
obligations by tully complying with the regulations laid
upon it by the University.

not imposmi' any sanctions on the Band despite the de
partment's decision to apologize publicly to BYU. It is
cncouiaging tli.it the I nivei at\ lelt it could leave the
sanctioning process up to the Band, although we do not
believe that any sanctions imposed externally or by
the Band on itself were necessary.
I he Band s halftimc show script had been previous
ly icv le wed and approved by the Athletic Department,
but BYU outrage over the skit in which Band assistant
manager loin llennessy pretended to marry all five
I Jollies caused both the Band and the Athletics De
partment to dispute exactly what had been intended in
the text of the script. Arguments revolved around how
the announce! was supposed to stutter the line about
the sacred bond "between a man and woman .. . (stut
ter)." Athletic Department officials said they were
under the impression the word "woman" should have
been partially stuttered as "wo-" in the sentence,
whereas Band officials maintained that they thought it
was deal the sciipted stutter would involve repeating
the whole phrase "and woman" over and over again.
It is understandable that the Athletic Department
might not have assumed th.it the entire phrase would be
repeated liyc times, alluding to the practice* of
polygamy. However, the subsequent line in the sciipt
"I Jollies inai iy I'om" should have been clear enough for
I i n\e i sit v officials to recognize the Band's intent to re I
eieiic'L polygamy.
Since the Department reviewed and approved the
sciipt, and the text clearly enough indicated the insinua
tion ul polvgainv. ii would have been inappropriate for the-
Band to Ik* punished as a result of a misunderstanding on
(lie part of the Athletic Department, despite the Band's
compliance with requited procedures.
Some suspect that the Band was pressured or encour
aged by the Athletic Department to sell sanction and

offer an apology through an implicit threat that the Band
would be sanctioned by Stanford if it did not take such
steps on its own. The Band's act of apologizing and sanc
tioning itself certainly did divert attention in the nation
al media from the fact that the Athletic Department oiig
inally decided to approve the script. However, the Band
and the Athletic Department have both adamantly de
nied such speculation. If such a tacit arrangement were
the case, we would strongly disapprove, but we tiust that
the Band's decision was indeed made independent of any
pressure — express or implied — from the University.
But even if the script had not been reviewed before
hand by the Athletic Department, the Band's actions
would still not merit sanctions. Ihe Band is renowned
for its tendency to satirize groups of all denominations.
Generally, the Band's antics are not carried out in the
spirit of malice, but rather — as its members have sinii
larly insisted in this situation — in the interest ol good
humor. That was the case in this incident as well.
While some BYU fans or members of the Mormon
faith might have taken offense at the stereotyj>e iterated
in the show, such lighthearted stereotypes are a fairly in
tegral component of most comedy. II the Band went out
of its way to single out a specific ethnic or religious group,
rather than equally distributing its humor and poking fun
at all groups, we would then agree that there was a prob
lem. But that has not been the case. And this incident did
not cross the line from liom being humorous to being ex
cessively negative or objectionable.
The Band has always been, and will always be, a
lightning rod for controversy on campus. However, so
long as the Band pursues its humor in a balanced man
ner and does not overly target any specific groups or in
dividuals. such jokes should be seen as little more than
that jokes. And as long as the Athletic Department
opts lt> review and approve field show scripts before
they run, provided the intent and manner in which the
script will be performed is relatively clear, it would be a
shame for the Band to be punished despite meeting its
obligations by tully complying with the regulations laid
upon it by the University.
