dents to vote. We
discussed setting up
tables in While
Pla/a, distiihuting
(onus to incoming
students, knocking
on doors, setting up
awareness events
and election night
festivities. It seemed

like our plan was
ready to go wl len the pi esident ol t he St ai i
ford College RepuNiauis said that he
didn't want to be involved.
"We're keeping our options open
for the fall" he explained.
We decided to go on anyway. Over
the summer. Omar and I were hashing
out what would go on the voter regis
tration instruction form. At the end of
an e mail, hall joking, I pointed out
that ()inar had only listed ASSU advo
cacy and Stanford in Government as
the contacts, leaving out the
Democtats. He wrote hack and ex
plained that he didn't want the letter to
seem like it was a partisan effort.
2) I got an e-mail two weeks ago from
the Stanford Speakers Bureau, asking if
the Stanford Democrats would be able
to pitch in for the honorarium if they
were able to get I loward IX an to come
speak (Ml campus lielore the election.
I had toe mail back and tell him that
we didn't get any student government
funding, so probably not. I talked to the
SCR president a few days later and
asked if he thought |x>litical groups
should have the same access to campus
funding other groups have for bringing
speakers t< > campus.
Me said the Republicans weren't
planning on applying lor funding since
they could get their money elsewhere,
and that he thought it was a bad idea for
the ASSI I to fund I Xnn >ci ats' events but
not Republicans .
3) 'I he next week, my friend Claire
Adida was or ganizing a |x>litkal forum
for new LGBT freshmen. She e-mailed
leaders from the Green. 1 )emociaticand
Republican groups on campus to see il
they 'd be interested in sin >w ing up U > talk
about political issues facing queer stu
dents and opporl unities to get involved.
However, the next time I ran into
her. she said she might have to cancel it
since the Republicans hadn't written
back, and she wasn't completely com

lot table having a partisan forum.
4) A ci >uplc days later, I was turning
in a form to David, the extraordinarily
beleaguered guy who handles room
icservations in I residder.
"Moie looms for the Democrats,
Kai he asked. "11l have to see about this.
You know the Republicans haven't even
comeby and asked for anything yet."
5) Al I ranken was once challenged
when he called George Bush a liar:
"I )c>i i't you think that's a little bit harsh?"
"Well I would," Al Frankenreplied,
"if Hush wasn't,you know, a liar. I.ike
he tells lies."
As an example, Franken cites the
Bush statement in Febiuary 2(XJ() that
"By far the vast majority of my tax cuts
go to the bottom end of the specti um."
1 hat's not ti ue, because only 30 per -
cent of the tax cuts go to the bottom SI)
percent of the spectrum. Highly per
cent is more than the bottom end, and
30 percent is less than the vast majority.
When you say something that you
know isn't true, that's a lie.
Each story has its own logic: 1) If lots
ol students vote. Republican candidates
will do worse; 2) Republicans get paid
as much as $25 by the party for every
student they legist er — compared to
the Democrats' $0 — so it's easier for
them to fund their campus events; 3)
I lie Republicans won't get many re
el nits at a meeting for queer students
beat use their platform for them is lack
ing; 4) Ihe Republicans just aren't as
numerous or active on campus, so they
don't need as many rooms; 5) And fi
nally, lx)th Al Gore and Bush made
statements on how the benefits of
Bush's tax plan would be distributed,
but only Gore's statement was true.
In each case, people were trying to
be balanced. You give the same spon
sorship rights, the same funding, the
same access and the same facilities to
each political group. When two candi
dates disagree, it's "controversial" —
you don't ptoclaim one right and the
other one wrong.
I n each case, better than "balanced"
would be "fair." Fairness — as Repub
licans will Ix.* the first to remind us — is
about equal opportunities, not equal
outcomes. If all parties are offered a
spot at LGBT events but one party's
choices make its recruitment efforts
less successful, the responsibility lies
with that party alone. A fair policy
would offer equal coalition member
ship. funding, speaking opportunities
and facilities to all groups. If only one
party takes advantage of those oppor
tunities, so be it.

"By far the vast majority of my tax cuts
go to the bottom end of the specti um."
1 hat's not ti ue, because only 30 per -
cent of the tax cuts go to the bottom SI)
percent of the spectrum. Highly per
cent is more than the bottom end, and
30 percent is less than the vast majority.
When you say something that you
know isn't true, that's a lie.
Each story has its own logic: 1) If lots
ol students vote. Republican candidates
will do worse; 2) Republicans get paid
as much as $25 by the party for every
student they legist er — compared to
the Democrats' $0 — so it's easier for
them to fund their campus events; 3)
I lie Republicans won't get many re
el nits at a meeting for queer students
beat use their platform for them is lack
ing; 4) Ihe Republicans just aren't as
numerous or active on campus, so they
don't need as many rooms; 5) And fi
nally, lx)th Al Gore and Bush made
statements on how the benefits of
Bush's tax plan would be distributed,
but only Gore's statement was true.
In each case, people were trying to
be balanced. You give the same spon
sorship rights, the same funding, the
same access and the same facilities to
each political group. When two candi
dates disagree, it's "controversial" —
you don't ptoclaim one right and the
other one wrong.
I n each case, better than "balanced"
would be "fair." Fairness — as Repub
licans will Ix.* the first to remind us — is
about equal opportunities, not equal
outcomes. If all parties are offered a
spot at LGBT events but one party's
choices make its recruitment efforts
less successful, the responsibility lies
with that party alone. A fair policy
would offer equal coalition member
ship. funding, speaking opportunities
and facilities to all groups. If only one
party takes advantage of those oppor
tunities, so be it.

discussed setting up
tables in While
Pla/a, distiihuting
(onus to incoming
students, knocking
on doors, setting up
awareness events
and election night
festivities. It seemed

like our plan was
ready to go wl len the pi esident ol t he St ai i
ford College RepuNiauis said that he
didn't want to be involved.
"We're keeping our options open
for the fall" he explained.
We decided to go on anyway. Over
the summer. Omar and I were hashing
out what would go on the voter regis
tration instruction form. At the end of
an e mail, hall joking, I pointed out
that ()inar had only listed ASSU advo
cacy and Stanford in Government as
the contacts, leaving out the
Democtats. He wrote hack and ex
plained that he didn't want the letter to
seem like it was a partisan effort.
2) I got an e-mail two weeks ago from
the Stanford Speakers Bureau, asking if
the Stanford Democrats would be able
to pitch in for the honorarium if they
were able to get I loward IX an to come
speak (Ml campus lielore the election.
I had toe mail back and tell him that
we didn't get any student government
funding, so probably not. I talked to the
SCR president a few days later and
asked if he thought |x>litical groups
should have the same access to campus
funding other groups have for bringing
speakers t< > campus.
Me said the Republicans weren't
planning on applying lor funding since
they could get their money elsewhere,
and that he thought it was a bad idea for
the ASSI I to fund I Xnn >ci ats' events but
not Republicans .
3) 'I he next week, my friend Claire

about political issues facing queer stu

However, the next time I ran into
her. she said she might have to cancel it
since the Republicans hadn't written
back, and she wasn't completely com

lot table having a partisan forum.
4) A ci >uplc days later, I was turning
in a form to David, the extraordinarily
beleaguered guy who handles room
icservations in I residder.
"Moie looms for the Democrats,
Kai he asked. "11l have to see about this.
You know the Republicans haven't even
comeby and asked for anything yet."
5) Al I ranken was once challenged
when he called George Bush a liar:
"I )c>i i't you think that's a little bit harsh?"
"Well I would," Al Frankenreplied,
"if Hush wasn't,you know, a liar. I.ike
he tells lies."
As an example, Franken cites the
