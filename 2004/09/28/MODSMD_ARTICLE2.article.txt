# Univ. censors sculpture
## Hennessy cancels plan for Oppenheim sculpture on campus 
### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
In a controversial and arguably
unprecedented decision. Universi
ty President John Hennessy over
ruled the recommendation of the
President's Panel on Outdoor Art
when he terminated plans to ac
quire a 25-foot sculpture from
prominent New York-based artist
Dennis Oppenheim.
Oppenheim's publicist says
Hennessy cited potentially inflam
matory elements of the sculpture
pointed out by Dean for Religious
Life Rev. Scotty McLennan.
The sculpture, "Device to Root
Out Evil," portrays an upside
down church with its steeple
wedged into the ground. It is the
third version of the sculpture that
Oppenheim has created; the first
was met with wide critical acclaim
when it was featured in the 1997
Venice Biennale.

Oppenheim, in a phone interview,
contended that the cancellation
was based on a faulty interpreta
tion of his work.
"There's no reason why it should
have been censored," he said. "The
President and other conservative
people projected content into this
work that wasn't there. It's about
the fusion of sculpture and archi
tecture; I'm not interested at all in
the religious aspect."
His choice to depict a church was
due to its unique structure, he said.
"A church is the only thing that
does that," he said. "It's the only
structure with a protruding spire to
go into the ground."
Tom Seligman, the director of
the Cantor Arts Center, expressed
dissatisfaction over the decision.
"I was sad at the outcome; it
wasn't what I'd hoped for,"he said
in an interview. "I respect Dennis's
work, and I always have. I was an
advocate for the work."
However, Seligman disputes
Oppenheim's claim that the work
can be entirely divorced from reli
gion and politics.
"I think Dennis's work is pur-
