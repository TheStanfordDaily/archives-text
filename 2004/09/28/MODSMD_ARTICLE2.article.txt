# Univ. censors sculpture
## Hennessy cancels plan for Oppenheim sculpture on campus 
### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
In a controversial and arguably
unprecedented decision. Universi
ty President John Hennessy over
ruled the recommendation of the
President's Panel on Outdoor Art
when he terminated plans to ac
quire a 25-foot sculpture from
prominent New York-based artist
Dennis Oppenheim.
Oppenheim's publicist says
Hennessy cited potentially inflam
matory elements of the sculpture
pointed out by Dean for Religious
Life Rev. Scotty McLennan.
The sculpture, "Device to Root
Out Evil," portrays an upside
down church with its steeple
wedged into the ground. It is the
third version of the sculpture that
Oppenheim has created; the first
was met with wide critical acclaim
when it was featured in the 1997
Venice Biennale.

Oppenheim, in a phone interview,
contended that the cancellation
was based on a faulty interpreta
tion of his work.
"There's no reason why it should
have been censored," he said. "The
President and other conservative
people projected content into this
work that wasn't there. It's about
the fusion of sculpture and archi
tecture; I'm not interested at all in
the religious aspect."
His choice to depict a church was
due to its unique structure, he said.
"A church is the only thing that
does that," he said. "It's the only
structure with a protruding spire to
go into the ground."
Tom Seligman, the director of
the Cantor Arts Center, expressed
dissatisfaction over the decision.
"I was sad at the outcome; it
wasn't what I'd hoped for,"he said
in an interview. "I respect Dennis's
work, and I always have. I was an
advocate for the work."
However, Seligman disputes
Oppenheim's claim that the work
can be entirely divorced from reli
gion and politics.
"I think Dennis's work is pur-

New York-based artist Dennis Oppenheim's "Device to Root Out
Evil," a 1997 version of the sculpture, was featured at the Venice Bien
nale. The third version of the work was approved for Stanford's outdoor
art collection but. University President Hennessy recently overturned
the decision.

posely ambiguous and enigmatic.
That's part of what makes it so inter
esting," Seligman said. "It has multi
ple interpretations, which is one of
the characteristics of good art."
Hennessy defended his decision,
hut did not offer specific reasons for
it.
"I made a decision — after exten
sive consultation with various mem
bers of the Stanford community —
that this particular piece was not an
appropriate addition given our long
term goals for outdoor art," he said
in an e-mail.
Seligman cited a "constellation
of things" that contributed to the
decision.
"There were issues around its
maintenance, attractiveness, con
cerns coming from the Dean of Reli
gious Life, including its title, and
earthquake issues," he said.
Oppenheim. however, noted that
he had twice visited the campus to
discuss the sculpture's placement
and earthquake precautions, among
other preparations. Following the
panel's approval of the acquisition of
the sculpture in 2002, Seligman
helped raise funds and Oppenheim
began meeting with University ad
ministrators to further the project,
he said.
McLennan admitted that his ad
vice was solicited by the President
and by the panel, but refused to com
ment further.
Another point of contention be
tween the artist and the University is
whether the decision to overrule the
panel sets a precedent. Oppenheim
asserts that the President has never
rejected a piece selected by the
panel. Seligman does not see this
cancellation as unique.
"We make decisions not to bring
art to Stanford every day."he said.
"It's not the first time."
Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to
the president and secretary of the
board of trustees, emphasized that
Stanford never broke a contract with
Oppenheim.

"This was not a cancellation of a
commission, but rather a decision
not to acquire a particular piece of
art." he said in an e-mail.
Oppenheim seemed to have a dif
ferent perception of his agreement
with the University.
"I would never have done it had I
known [that it would be rejected],"
he said. "They curtailed an artwork
that was in the works for five years.
It's been sitting in my studio, com
pletely finished for years now...l'm
out $100,000 easy."
Oppenheim does not yet know
what he will do with the sculpture,
but neither he nor the President rule
out the possibility of Oppenheim's
contributing a different work for
Stanford's collection in the future.
A Stanford alumnus, Oppenheim
received his MFA from Stanford in
1965 and has been a pioneering
artist since the late 19605. He is
known for separating familiar ob
jects from their normal contexts and
meanings — by changing their size,
spatial orientation and structure.
His works have been exhibited
across North America, Europe and
Asia, and can be found in public col
lections in Zurich, Los Angeles and
New York.
Oppenheim said that he learned
he could not win in cases of censor
ship last year when his Blue Shirt
sculpture — commissioned for Mil
waukee's Mitchell International
Airport — was cancelled by govern
ment officials amid concern that the
work would be construed as a nega
tive reference to the blue-collar
image of the city.
He joked that the title of the can
celled Stanford sculpture. Device to
Root Out Evil, which caused him
trouble with the University, has
grown ironically appropriate.
"It really did root out evil in a
strange, circuitous way," Oppen
heim mused. "The President and
others have conservative views and
are afraid of a work of art, and now
we know about it. It really worked."
