Footbol (earn deserves some credit
I tina Pac 10 lan all the way. It not
l<»r my lather graduating from the Uni
versity of Southern ( alilomia hack in
the late 2(K. I would have been yelling
foi Stanford a! Saturday's football
game against the I r< ijans. As a matter
of fact. I was pretty proud of Ihe ( ardi
nal for their effort.
Hnl don't leaders realize that USC
liead eoaeh Peter ( arroll did not show
much in the lust half on purpose? He
slaved in base defense and /one cover
age the entire In si half. Never did I see
anyone blitz 111 the lirst hall, only the
front four were allowed to put pres

sure on the first half.
Pete keeps it close the first half with
i»ul showing anything more that he has
to. Actually, except for the two spectac
ular unexpected plays — the hike field
goal and the "kill the clock'" fullback
dive up the middle — USC' would have
been leading at half. By doing this. USC
stays in the game on talent and basic
plays, therefore not giv ing their oppo
nent very much to work on for half time
adjustments.
(>n the other hand, when the sec
ond half started, here came the stunts
on every single down and the Stanford
quarterback had someone in his face
the entire second half. Hie coverages

were changed up by adding defensive
back stunts and man-to-man coverage.
This is why Buddy could not con
tinue to use his first-half game plan. It
was an entirely different defensive
scheme they were facing, and they
were never in a position to take advan
tage of those "trick plays."
Give Buddy the credit he deserves
for coming up with such a good first half
of offense: and also give the Stanford
defense a big pat on the back for playing
a one hell of an entire game.

Band's baWtime show
insensitve and inappropriate
How could anyone think that
mocking another person s belief sys
tem, past or present, is appiopriate?
Polygamy was officially abandoned by
the Mormon faith over KM) years ago.
Hate to bieak the late news flash, but
we're no longer living in the nine
teenth century.
Public ridicule of any part of anoth
er's religious beliefs, particularly during
an official university sponsored event,
is shameful. On most campuses, being
anti-Semitic — or anti-Catholic or anti-
Moslem or ant i-gay or anti-whatever

is deemed taboo. So why is it okav to
be anti Mormon? The Band's conduet
smacks of hypocrisy in the extreme.
Even the most intellectually chal
lenged Calilornian must know that
Mormons have a tragic history of being
persecuted. In a post-9/ II world, in
fantile displays of religious intolerance
are even less appropriate.

Mormons have not practiced
polygamy for over a century
It seems to me the joke ended up

being 011 the heads of your own Band
and Band leaders, because the Mor
mons don't practice polygamy. Yes,
they did back in the nineteenth centu
ry fora few years, but that decision was
recalled.
1 have lived in and around the
state of Utah for 42 of my 47 years
and have never met a polygamist.
And the same goes for 99 percent of
my friends and neighbors. Those of
the Mormon faith do not believe in
polygamy, just like the rest of the
nation.
