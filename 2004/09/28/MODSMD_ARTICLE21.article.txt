## Students must fight for right to party 
### PAUL HAYNE 
Congratulations to the Universi
ty administration. You've done a
marvelous job of enacting sweeping
changes to the social life at Stanford
over the past four years with little or
no protest from the student body.
Taking advantage of the four
year turnaround inherent in the
undergraduate collective memory,
drastic changes can be made to
seem minor by moving in incre
mental steps. Start with the ex
tremities, and before they know it,
you've got them by the throat.
To the students: Since when does
the administration run your social
lives? If you want to have Full Moon
this week, then that's when it is.
And while we're at it, why not
take back control of the rest of
your social events? Remember
when Band Run was more than a
police-cordoned cattle roundup?
Come on, seniors, you're old

enough to remember that. Remem
ber when you partied like rock
stars with your friends in the dorm
lounge after a summer apart? Re
member that sense of freedom ?
While it's understandable the
administration wants to keep stu
dents safe, they have clearly over
stepped their boundaries. The role
of the administration should not be
parent or social manager; rather, it
should be one of facilitator.
By taking responsibility out of
the students' hands, the adminis
tration, along with the ASSU, is
undermining the process of social
growth into adulthood. Adults of
legal age should be able to drink
alcohol in a responsible fashion.
Those who abuse this privilege
should face the consequences, but
the reality is that these incidents
are few and far between and the
student body as a whole has been
punished for the actions of a few.
Social events at Stanford should

be planned, coordinated and imple
mented by and for students, not ad
ministrators. Regulations should
keep students safe, while allowing
maximum freedom under the con
straint of laws.
As recently as four years ago, the
trust afforded students by University
administrators was the cornerstone
of residential life. No major incident
that I'm aware of spawned the
changes that have taken place since
then. No amount of Absolute Fun
will take the place of mutual trust be
tween students and administrators.
I hope the administration sees
the errors of its ways before Stan
ford gradually becomes dry as a
bone, a "zany" caricature of its for
mer self. More importantly, I hope
students wake up and take back
their campus.
