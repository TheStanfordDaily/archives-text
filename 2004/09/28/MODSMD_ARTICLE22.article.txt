## What elections mean for Afghanistan 
### J. ALEXANDER THIER 
Afghanistan is holding its first
ever presidential elections on Oct.
9. This landmark event comes al
most exactly three years after the
United States and its allies
launched a war to dislodge the Tal
iban and destroy al Oaeda. But is
this the birth of real democracy or
a show election to satisfy the con
science and political needs of
Western governments?
By most measures, Afghanistan
seems far from ripe for democracy.
As President Hamidi Karzai strug
gles to build a government in Kabul,
much of the country remains under
the control of warlord armies.
More than 20,000 U.S.-led mili
tary forces continue to battle in
surgents, and another 8,000 inter
national soldiers are maintaining
peace in the capital. Factional
fighting has touched every corner
of the country, and more soldiers
and aid workers have been killed
this year than in the previous two.
The opium trade, which pro
vides substantial resources to ter
rorists, was worth $2.3 billion last
year and will increase an estimated
50 to 100 percent this year.
It will be difficult to ensure free
and fair elections in this environ
ment. More than 10 million
Afghans have registered to vote,
many at great personal risk. This is
a promising sign that Afghans

want a say in their future.
But the United Nations, which is
helping organize the elections, re
cently released a report warning that
many Afghans would be unable to
freely exercise their political rights
owing to warlord intimidation. The
Organization for Security and Co
operation in Europe has refused to
send election monitors, citing a lack
of security. And on his first major
campaign trip outside Kabul. Karzai
was nearly assassinated.
Concerns about fairness are
muted, however, because the out
come of the elections seems as
sured. There are 18 candidates for
the top spot, but there is little doubt
that U.S.-backed Karzai will win.
There is some value to holding
elections, even if they will not be
completely free and fair. If this
election is successful. Karzai will
win a clear victory, giving him a
patina of legitimacy.
This election will also serve as
an important political and logisti
cal test in preparation for parlia
mentary and local elections next
spring. Those elections, which will
be much more hotly contested,
have the potential for far greater
upheaval.
However, many believe, rightly
or wrongly, that the presidential
elections have been rushed not to
hasten democracy in Afghanistan
but to precede the presidential
elections in the United States.

Elections themselves are only a
small part of democracy. Effective
government service, protection of
individual rights, accountability —
these are the true fruits of democ
racy. Holding elections without
the rule of law can undermine
democracy by sparking violence,
sowing cynicism and allowing un
democratic forces to become en
trenched. Slow progress on dis
arming militias and creating a na
tional army and police force has
left the central government with
little power to enforce laws. The
court system, controlled by funda
mentalist Islamists in Kabul, is
barely functioning in the provinces
and cannot be relied on to enforce
the most basic laws — let alone ad
judicate politically sensitive issues
such as electoral disputes.
Instead of focusing on elections
— the end product of a successful
democracy — we must do more to
strengthen the institutions that will
truly make elections meaningful.
We have inspired millions of
Afghans with the promise of
democracy; we must now commit
to turning that rhetoric into reality.
