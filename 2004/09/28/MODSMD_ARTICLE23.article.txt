## Bears edge Cardinal in overtime Cal field hockey survives upset scare to stretch nine-game win streak over Stan ford 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY 
For almost 59 minutes, it seemed as though the Car
dinal field hockey team (5-6, 0-2 Northern Pacific Ath
letic Conference) was about to end rival California's
six-game win streak.
The Cardinal held a 1-0 lead over the Golden Bears
(11-2, 3-1 NorPac) through 58 minutes of play, and
looked to be on their way to an upset victory.
But it was not to be, as Cal tied up the score in the
59th minute and scored again in the 94th minute —
double-overtime — to edge Stanford 2-1 in the Cardi
nal's second game of conference play.
More than 330 fans, a season high, came out to the
Varsity Field Hockey Turf at Stanford on a clear, sunny
Saturday to watch rivals Stanford and California in an
early key NorPac matchup.
Stanford entered the game having lost its first con
ference game at Pacific and needing a win to avoid
falling two full games behind Cal.

The Golden Bears dominated play early, as Stanford
found itself stuck on the defensive end.
But going against the flow of play, Stanford struck
first, converting one of its two penalty corners for the
game in the 21st minute. Sophomore Aska Sturdevan
scored her team-leading fourth goal of the season with
assists from junior Lyndsay Erickson and senior
Eleanor Morgan.
Sturdevan's goal held up for more than 30 minutes,
as the Stanford defense and junior goalkeeper Ana
Kralovec kept the Golden Bears at bay. Cal failed to
convert any of its 13 penalty corners and outshot the
Cardinal 25-4.
The Golden Bears' pressure eventually cracked the
Stanford defense, though, as junior Teela Crosthwaite
scored off an assist from sophomore Valentina Godfrid.
Godfrid now leads the NorPac with 31 points on 12
goals and 7 assists.
Crosthwaite's goal seemed to induce a collective
groan of disbelief from the Cardinal faithful, who were
expecting Stanford's first win over Cal since a home
match on October 6, 2001.
Both teams played cautiously during the first over
time and came away without scoring. In the fourth
minute of the second overtime period, Godfrid collect
ed the ball in the attacking third of the field, put on a
dribbling exhibition as she weaved through the Stanford

defense, and finally flipped a shot past Kralovec to win
the game for the Golden Bears and end the Cardinal's
upset bid.
In spite of the loss, Kralovec picked up a career high
11 saves, while junior Tammy Shuer added two saves for
Stanford.
On the other side. Golden Bears senior goalkeeper
Kelly Knapp grabbed the victory while recording two
saves.
The loss put Stanford a full two games behind Cal in
the NorPac West standings. The five remaining confer
ence games include a rematch with the Golden Bears at
Cal on Oct. 30.
After having lost three of their first four games, the
Cardinal looked to have been picking up steam, winning
four of their next six before the loss to Cal.
But coming so close to victory against the highly
ranked Golden Bears makes the Cardinal feel opti
mistic about the rest of their conference schedule lead
ing up to the NorPac championships. And although it's
never easy to stomach a loss to Cal, the conference sea
son is just starting.
"We were really proud of the way we played today
against a very strong California team," said Stanford
head coach Lesley Irvine.
The Cardinal will next travel to take on Southwest
Missouri State on Friday and Saturday.
