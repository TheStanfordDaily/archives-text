# XCountry wows visitors, opponents

### MIA ASHTON DESK EDITOR 
The entire stretch of Campus Drive Loop
was madness on Saturday afternoon, and no,
it wasn't just for the football game.
Thousands of high school runners were
pouring out of bright yellow buses, eyes sur
veying the Stanford golf course, looking for
their competitors and scanning excitedly for
a glimpse of their hosts, the storied defend
ing national champion Stanford Cardinal
cross country teams.
The Stanford cross country invitational an
nually hosts nearly 4,000 runners, collegiate
and prep teams alike, and the event has become
an opportunity for younger athletes to compete
amongst the NCAA runners they idolize.
"It's exciting and cute how some of the
high school students are like, here comes
Stanford!"' senior Anita Siraki said. "It's
definitely a cool dynamic."
Here comes Stanford, indeed.
The Cardinal put on an impressive per
formance which proved that in the cross
country world, their runners need no fan
fare, no introduction, only a bit of road to do
what they do best — stun their opponents.
In a dominating performance, the Stan
ford women's cross country team outran
their competitors to a first-place finish. The
No. 1 Cardinal clinched the top three spots in
both the 4,000 meter and 6,000 meter races,
while the Stanford men posted a fourth place
finish in the 4,000 and took the top two spots
in the 8,000.
Senior Sara Bei won the 4k race in 13
minutes, 16 seconds at a 5:21 per mile clip. In
a superb team effort, two Cardinal runners
followed not too far behind. Freshman
Shannon Bergstedt ran the course in 13:55
with sophomore Katy Trotter trailing one
second behind her.
Awestruck high schoolers had more to
watch as the women also swept the 6,000
meter race, thanks in part to some new
Cardinal stars fresh out of high school
themselves.
Siraki led the field with a 21:14 finish with
Stanford freshman Teresa McWalters on
her heels. Sophomore Amanda Trotter and
freshman Julie Allen placed third and
fourth, respectively.
The Cardinal effort impressed women's
head coach Dena Evans.
"I feel like the kids did great," she said.
"Obviously, the scores reflect that. I wanted
them to run confidently and take some risks.

and they did that really well."
According to Saraki, pressure didn't af
fect the Cardinal's confidence.
"We try to do our best regardless of
where we're ranked, so we don't feel any
extra pressure," she said.
The Stanford women ran with absolute
confidence, statistically squashing the oppo
sition. Though the Cardinal took half of the
top 10 spots in the 4k and four in the 6k, the
team remains weary of the competition.
"I think there were a lot of good teams in
there," Evans said. "But I think, like us,
they're also teams that are evolving, and they
didn't put all their people out there today. I'm
sure that some of those teams will be better by
the end of the season, and I know we will too."
The fact that the Stanford men's team
couldn't quite match the performance of its
female counterparts doesn't diminish the
men's stellar showing.
The Cardinal placed three runners in the
top 10 of both the 4k and 8k and took the top
two spots in the longer course. Sophomore
Peter Meindl ran a 23:52 8,000 meter race to
take the number one spot. Teammate Neil
Davis, a junior, crossed the finish line four
seconds behind him.
Meindl noted that the home venue
played a part in his win.
"In last couple hundred meters, when I
was hurting pretty bad, I thought it would re
ally stink to lose here," he said. "It made a
difference. It helped us out."
Stanford didn't stink at all. Sophomore
Steven DeWitt and freshman Joaquin Chapa
took fourth and seventh in the 4k, respective
ly, as part of a performance that Meindl said
he felt little pressure about.
The men's team has changed dramatically
since graduation, leaving a different group to
strive for the continued legacy of NCAA
champions.
"I think more than anything it's exciting,
because it's our chance to add something to
this tradition and keep it going," Meindl said.
"It's a big motivator and it could go either
way. It's not really pressure because we are
the underdog in most people's minds be
cause we lost so many people.
We're not ranked first and most people
aren't expecting a repeat, but for the pro
gram it's a big year."
The men's and women's team will have
another opportunity to prove themselves at
the Notre Dame Invitational in South Bend,
lnd. on Friday.
