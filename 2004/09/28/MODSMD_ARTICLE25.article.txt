## 'Say Anything,' just don't say SF is done for 
### 
Last Thursday I took a break from following
my San Francisco Giants in their stumbling
quest for the final playoff spot to watch the 80's
cult-classic film "Say Anything" for the first
time.
For those unfamiliar with the movie, lovable

but underachieving heart
throb Lloyd Dobler (John
Cusack) tries to win the heart
of the smart, beautiful and
unattainable Diane Court
(lone Skye).
The highlight of the movie
— a seminal scene enshrined
on t-shirts. on posters on dis
play in front of Tresidder, and
in the hearts of certain im

pressionable female viewers
— finds lovable Lloyd standing alone at night
outside Diane's window, holding a totally-80s
boom box over his head, blasting Peter Gabriel's
ballad "In Your Eyes."
I am by no means a pop culture all-star, but
even without having seen the movie I was aware
of the"In Your Eyes" moment. So you can
imagine — or I can say it and you will accept it as
fact — that I was pretty excited to get to this
scene. As the movie approached the assumed
climax I was on the edge of my friend's futon,
and I swear I could hear the SBC Park organist
cue up "More Bounce to the Ounce," Barry
Bonds' pre at-bat song.
And then Barry was intentionally walked.
Lloyd Dobler let me down. He didn't take a
stand in the bright lights, but rather cowered in
the shadows. The scene was over almost before
it began. Diane rolled over in bed but did not
even think of getting up and moving like Juliet to
the window. And as far as pump-up movie songs
go, "In Your Eyes" is as far from perfection
("Eye of the Tiger") as you can get.
I was so disappointed I felt as if I had signed
Tom Brady only to have Ryan Leaf show up on
the first day of camp.
Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe I
should just suck it up and recognize that this
movie spawned an entire genre of films and set
the standard for the next 15 years. But I got a
knot in my stomach and that same bitter taste in
my mouth that comes every time I see the San
Francisco Giants take a step backwards from the
postseason. Yes, this is a sports column and I'm
bringing it back.
The Giants and their fans are fortunate to
have Barry Bonds on their team. He is the great
est ballplayer in the last 50 years, (soon to be) the
greatest home run hitter ever, and the most
feared batter since Ted Williams.
And like the Red Sox with Teddy Ballgame,
the Giants are going to squander their chance to
win a World Series. Barry Bonds has never had
the supporting cast he needs to take a team to the
top, and he has never gotten the chance to re
deem the reputation for poor playoff perfor
mance that he picked up in Pittsburgh.
Last week we were treated to a great specta
cle, as Barry Bonds crushed his 700 th career
home run to put him in an exclusive club with
Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth.
Like Lloyd Dobler and his boom box, in a few
short days the image of Bonds reaching the 700
plateau has been enshrined in television replays,
in radio clips of Dave Flemming (Stanford grad
uate, class of '98), and in $20 t-shirts you can buy
at the Giants Dugout store at SBC Park.
Like Lloyd Dobler and his boom box, the
movie of the 2004 San Francisco Giants has been
tremendously disappointing.
Coming off of a 100-win breeze through the
NL West, the Giants unloaded Tim Worrell and
Joe Nathan and dismantled a dominant bullpen.
They failed to shore up a starting pitching rota-

tion decimated by the never-to-be-spoken
of Ponson Fiasco. And, like every season,
they refused to pick up a big-name, big-time
bat to put behind Barry Bonds. Incidental
ly, have you noticed that A.J. rhymes with
"double play"?.
And like Lloyd Dobler and his boom
box, the excitement surrounding Bonds' in
credible stand-alone feat has led to no tan
gible results. As long as no one in the line
up can punish opponents for putting Barry
on base, as long as Dustin Hermanson
blows saves with regularity, as long as the
bullpen cannot finish what the starting rota
tion has provided, and as long as this team
cannot find a way to win close games, the
Giants will squander the great career mile
stone of Barry Bonds and leave their fans
once more standing alone in the cold under
a tree with that dreamy look in their eyes of
what miehl have been.

It's not over yet. The Giants are in the
midst of a season-ending 15-game stretch
against teams in direct competition with
them for the final two playoff spots in the
National League. They have three road
games left against both the Padres and the
Dodgers. If the Giants can get hot and
watch the Cubs succumb to the Billy Goat
Curse, they have a chance to make the post
season.
Like they say in "Say Anything", this
isn't a scam. There's still the possibility of
romance.
And playoff baseball in San Francisco is
a beautiful siyht.
