# Despite injury, Card seeks payback win over St. Mary's
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If revenge is a dish best served
cold, then the St. Mary's Gaels
have a lot to worry about when
the No. 11 Stanford Cardinal (9-
2. 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference) roll
iflto Moraga tonight. Stanford
has had almost a month to recov
er from the five-game loss that St.
Mary's saddled them with at the
SBC/Sands Tournament in Reno,
Nevada. The match marked the
first time that the Gaels have ever
beaten the Cardinal.
The Cardinal started that
match slowly, dropping the first
two games to the unranked Gaels
before coming back to take
games three and four and force a
game five. In the final game, how
ever, the Cardinal simply had too
many mistakes, tallying eight un
forced errors to give St. Mary's
the game. 15-8 and the match, 3-2.

To their credit, St. Mary's
played a solid match and spread
the ball well, with four players
tallying double digit kills. Led by
junior outside hitter and tourna
ment MVP Kaui Salzman, the
Gaels would go on to beat Utah
State and win the tournament.
The Cardinal finished second.
"Give St. Mary's credit for
coming out and playing good vol
leyball against us," said Stanford
head coach John Dunning. "We
didn't play very well, but they did
a good job of frustrating our hit
ters and not being scared. They
just outplayed us and deserved
the win."
So the Cardinal will head
across the bay looking to pull
even and prove that they can
beat the Gaels. While the match
is non-conference, look for the
Cardinal to take this one very
Goldhahn returns to
lineup, Hall still out

seriously.
"Every match we play, we're
looking to improve on our last
match," senior lihero Leahi Hall
said. "We didn't play like we want
ed to last time against St. Mary's,
so this match is doubly important
because it gives us a chance not
only to improve but to correct our
mistakes from last time."
The Gaels will be facing a
slightly different Cardinal team
Tuesday night.
In Reno, junior setter Katie
Goldhahn was out with a strained
right Achilles tendon and is now
back in the lineup.
"Being able to use both setters
[freshman Bryn Kehoe and Gold
hahn] is a great advantage for us,"
Dunning said. "The 6-2 set gives us
a lot more options for attacking
and makes us a more dangerous
team."
The Cardinal lineup at the be
ginning of the month also featured
Hall, who is currently out with a
hamstring injury. Though the
libero was improving, she re-in
jured herself during yesterday's
practice. The team plans to take
Hall's recovery slowly.
"Because of the nature of her

injury and all the explosive mo
tions volleyball requires, we're
going to ease her back slowly into
things," Dunning said. "We'll miss
her on the defensive side of the
ball in the meantime."
With Hall out, junior Courtney
Schultz has shifted back to the
libero position she occupied last
year.
Because of the changes to the
rules, Schultz will be able to con
tinue to serve, a skill that will help
the Cardinal.
"It feels good to be back at
libero," Schultz said. "I played there
my first two years, so I'm most com
fortable there. I love passing and
working on my defense."
"Courtney is one of those play
ers who just wants to be out there
and play no matter what she's
doing," Dunning added. "She's a
great defensive player and adds a
lot of stability to our passing
game."
Sophomore Lizzie Suiter looks
to have a repeat performance of
her match against the Gaels earlier
this year. She posted a career high
nine blocks and added four kills.
Suiter has matched that career
high in Stanford's last two contests

against Arizona and Arizona
State.
"Because I get to play more
often, I've become much more
comfortable on the court," Suiter
said. "I understand how our system
works now; it's a good system, and
I've gotten so used to it that I don't
have to think about it."
For the Cardinal to top the
Gaels, outside hitters senior
Ogonna Nnamani and sophomore
Kristin Richards must have better
matches than they did in Reno.
Constantly frustrated by the St.
Mary's block, which often threw
two and sometimes three bodies
up against the kill, Nnamani only
managed to hit .180 and Richards
.103.
However, the pair is feeling
more in tune with freshman setter
Bryn Kehoe and the rest of the
team.
"Our chemistry improves every
week," Nnamani said. "I've never
been a part of a team at Stanford
that improves so much every week.
We're gelling fast as a unit. It's es
pecially great having Katie back."
The Cardinal take the court
tonight at McKeon Pavilion at St.
Mary's College at 7 p.m.

Senior outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani recently tallied her 1,843 th

Mary's block, which often threw
two and sometimes three bodies
up against the kill, Nnamani only
managed to hit .180 and Richards
.103.
However, the pair is feeling
more in tune with freshman setter
Bryn Kehoe and the rest of the
team.
"Our chemistry improves every
week," Nnamani said. "I've never
been a part of a team at Stanford
that improves so much every week.
We're gelling fast as a unit. It's es
pecially great having Katie back."
The Cardinal take the court
tonight at McKeon Pavilion at St.
Mary's College at 7 p.m.

Senior outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani recently tallied her 1,843 th
Stanford kill, giving her the third place spot in Cardinal career kills.
If revenge is a dish best served
cold, then the St. Mary's Gaels
have a lot to worry about when
the No. 11 Stanford Cardinal (9-
2. 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference) roll
iflto Moraga tonight. Stanford
has had almost a month to recov
er from the five-game loss that St.
Mary's saddled them with at the
SBC/Sands Tournament in Reno,
Nevada. The match marked the
first time that the Gaels have ever
beaten the Cardinal.
The Cardinal started that
match slowly, dropping the first
two games to the unranked Gaels
before coming back to take
games three and four and force a
game five. In the final game, how
ever, the Cardinal simply had too
many mistakes, tallying eight un
forced errors to give St. Mary's
the game. 15-8 and the match, 3-2.

To their credit, St. Mary's
played a solid match and spread
the ball well, with four players
tallying double digit kills. Led by
junior outside hitter and tourna
ment MVP Kaui Salzman, the
Gaels would go on to beat Utah
State and win the tournament.
The Cardinal finished second.
"Give St. Mary's credit for
coming out and playing good vol
leyball against us," said Stanford
head coach John Dunning. "We
didn't play very well, but they did
a good job of frustrating our hit
ters and not being scared. They
just outplayed us and deserved
the win."
So the Cardinal will head
across the bay looking to pull
even and prove that they can
beat the Gaels. While the match
is non-conference, look for the
Cardinal to take this one very
Goldhahn returns to
lineup, Hall still out

seriously.
"Every match we play, we're
looking to improve on our last
match," senior lihero Leahi Hall
said. "We didn't play like we want
ed to last time against St. Mary's,
so this match is doubly important
because it gives us a chance not
only to improve but to correct our
mistakes from last time."
The Gaels will be facing a
slightly different Cardinal team
Tuesday night.
In Reno, junior setter Katie
Goldhahn was out with a strained
right Achilles tendon and is now
back in the lineup.
"Being able to use both setters
[freshman Bryn Kehoe and Gold
hahn] is a great advantage for us,"
Dunning said. "The 6-2 set gives us
a lot more options for attacking
and makes us a more dangerous
team."
The Cardinal lineup at the be
ginning of the month also featured
Hall, who is currently out with a
hamstring injury. Though the
libero was improving, she re-in
jured herself during yesterday's
practice. The team plans to take
Hall's recovery slowly.
"Because of the nature of her

injury and all the explosive mo
tions volleyball requires, we're
going to ease her back slowly into
things," Dunning said. "We'll miss
her on the defensive side of the
ball in the meantime."
With Hall out, junior Courtney
Schultz has shifted back to the
libero position she occupied last
year.
Because of the changes to the
rules, Schultz will be able to con
tinue to serve, a skill that will help
the Cardinal.
"It feels good to be back at
libero," Schultz said. "I played there
my first two years, so I'm most com
fortable there. I love passing and
working on my defense."
"Courtney is one of those play
ers who just wants to be out there
and play no matter what she's
doing," Dunning added. "She's a
great defensive player and adds a
lot of stability to our passing
game."
Sophomore Lizzie Suiter looks
to have a repeat performance of
her match against the Gaels earlier
this year. She posted a career high
nine blocks and added four kills.
Suiter has matched that career
high in Stanford's last two contests

against Arizona and Arizona
State.
"Because I get to play more
often, I've become much more
comfortable on the court," Suiter
said. "I understand how our system
works now; it's a good system, and
I've gotten so used to it that I don't
have to think about it."
For the Cardinal to top the
Gaels, outside hitters senior
Ogonna Nnamani and sophomore
Kristin Richards must have better
matches than they did in Reno.
Constantly frustrated by the St.
Mary's block, which often threw
two and sometimes three bodies
up against the kill, Nnamani only
managed to hit .180 and Richards
