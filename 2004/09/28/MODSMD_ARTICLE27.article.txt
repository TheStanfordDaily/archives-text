# Golf struggles against tough Duke squad
## 
### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
The No. 20 Stanford women's
golf team understands that the col
lege golf season is a marathon, not
a sprint.
The Cardinal began the season
with a 12th-place finish at the Mer
cedes-Benz of Bend Fall Preview
Sept. 20-22. Meanwhile, No. 1
Duke picked up right where it left
off a year ago by claiming an im
pressive six-stroke victory over an
elite field.
Unlike many regular-season
events, the Fall Preview normally
attracts teams from across the
country. This year's tournament
was no exception, as the nation's
strongest teams descended upon
the par-71 Meadows Course in
Sunriver, Ore. fora three-day
competition and the official start of
the golf season.
"This tournament had one of
the strongest fields of teams aside
from nationals," sophomore Jenrti
Tangtiphaiboontana said. "This

tou,rnament gave us a good insight
of what we, as a team, need to work
on over the year to prepare for [the
NCAA Championship]."
The 21-team field included 13
teams ranked in the nation's Top
25, as well as traditional power
houses, such as Arizona, Vander
bilt and Southern California, who
were ranked just outside the Top
25. The defending NCAA Cham
pion UCLA Bruins were there, as
were runner up Oklahoma State
and an excellent California team.
Ultimately, however, all chal
lengers withered in the face of
Duke's 3-under-par 281 on the
final day â€” the second best team
round of the tournament. Sopho
more Brittany Lang paced the
Blue Devils with a school-record
64 on the first day and finished
third individually.
After last year's Blue Devil
team was considered possibly the
best college squad in history, this
year's edition looked no weaker
despite losing impact seniors
Leigh Anne Hardin and Virada

Nirapathpongporn to graduation.
"We still have a lot of talent on
this team, and it's exciting to come
out and win this tournament to
start the year," Duke head coach
Dan Brooks said.
The Blue Devils have now won
a ridiculous 23 of their last 28 tour
naments.
While Duke continued its win
ning ways, Stanford struggled a bit
in the early going, recording a 16-
over-par 300 on the first day of play
as the team dropped into 13th
place after 18 holes. The poor start
left 12 teams and 17 strokes be
tween Stanford and the lead, es
sentially ending any hopes of a top
five finish in the season's inaugural
event.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal
fought on gamely, returning with a
295 on the second day, led by
Tangtiphaiboontana. She fired her
second consecutive 73 and sat in
22nd place individually heading
into the final day of competition.
