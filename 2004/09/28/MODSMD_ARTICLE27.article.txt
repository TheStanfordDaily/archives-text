# Golf struggles against tough Duke squad
## 
### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
The No. 20 Stanford women's
golf team understands that the col
lege golf season is a marathon, not
a sprint.
The Cardinal began the season
with a 12th-place finish at the Mer
cedes-Benz of Bend Fall Preview
Sept. 20-22. Meanwhile, No. 1
Duke picked up right where it left
off a year ago by claiming an im
pressive six-stroke victory over an
elite field.
Unlike many regular-season
events, the Fall Preview normally
attracts teams from across the
country. This year's tournament
was no exception, as the nation's
strongest teams descended upon
the par-71 Meadows Course in
Sunriver, Ore. fora three-day
competition and the official start of
the golf season.
"This tournament had one of
the strongest fields of teams aside
from nationals," sophomore Jenrti
Tangtiphaiboontana said. "This

tou,rnament gave us a good insight
of what we, as a team, need to work
on over the year to prepare for [the
NCAA Championship]."
The 21-team field included 13
teams ranked in the nation's Top
25, as well as traditional power
houses, such as Arizona, Vander
bilt and Southern California, who
were ranked just outside the Top
25. The defending NCAA Cham
pion UCLA Bruins were there, as
were runner up Oklahoma State
and an excellent California team.
Ultimately, however, all chal
lengers withered in the face of
Duke's 3-under-par 281 on the
final day — the second best team
round of the tournament. Sopho
more Brittany Lang paced the
Blue Devils with a school-record
64 on the first day and finished
third individually.
After last year's Blue Devil
team was considered possibly the
best college squad in history, this
year's edition looked no weaker
despite losing impact seniors
Leigh Anne Hardin and Virada

Nirapathpongporn to graduation.
"We still have a lot of talent on
this team, and it's exciting to come
out and win this tournament to
start the year," Duke head coach
Dan Brooks said.
The Blue Devils have now won
a ridiculous 23 of their last 28 tour
naments.
While Duke continued its win
ning ways, Stanford struggled a bit
in the early going, recording a 16-
over-par 300 on the first day of play
as the team dropped into 13th
place after 18 holes. The poor start
left 12 teams and 17 strokes be
tween Stanford and the lead, es
sentially ending any hopes of a top
five finish in the season's inaugural
event.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal
fought on gamely, returning with a
295 on the second day, led by
Tangtiphaiboontana. She fired her
second consecutive 73 and sat in
22nd place individually heading
into the final day of competition.

Senior Wendra Liang tied for 78th in the
NCAA Fall Preview last week.
T\vo golfers finish
in 40th for Card

The rest of the team bounced back from a
tough first day as well. Senior Wendra Liang shot
her best round of the tournament, 74, and junior
Kelly Husted improved on her opening 79 with a
74 to match Liang.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, much of the
second day's momentum seemed to vanish
overnight, and the team stumbled in a final round
in which three of the five players carded their
worst scores of the event.
"We still need to work on our short games a
great deal," sophomore Lauren Todd said. "That
is the thing that separated us from the teams at
the very top."
One lonely bright spot for Stanford on the
final day was the play of Husted, who posted the
team's best individual round of the tournament.
Three birdies on the back nine and one at the
final hole secured a 71 and the best score of her
collegiate career.
Junior Stephanie Lue also played solidly in

the final round, carding a 73 en route to a 57th
place finish overall.
After two rounds of nice play. Tangtiphai
boontana faltered badly in her last 18 holes,
shooting 77 and dropping down to 4()th place to
tie with Husted and a host of others.
Sophomore Lauren Todd posted a pair of
double-bogeys on the front nine and never re
covered, shooting 78. She slid down the leader
board to finish in a tie for 66th place.
Liang rounded out the Cardinal's scores.
After hanging tough through the first two days,
she disintegrated amidst a flock of bogeys on the
back nine, and shot 81. Liang tied for 78th place.
Despite finishing in the middle of the pack,
there was optimism to be found on this young
team.
"We are pretty confident about our games
right now," Lue said. "We all showed glimpses of
excellence this weekend and can't wait for the
rest oi the season."

The 21-team field included 13
teams ranked in the nation's Top
25, as well as traditional power
houses, such as Arizona, Vander
bilt and Southern California, who
were ranked just outside the Top
25. The defending NCAA Cham
pion UCLA Bruins were there, as
were runner up Oklahoma State
and an excellent California team.
Ultimately, however, all chal
lengers withered in the face of
Duke's 3-under-par 281 on the
final day — the second best team
round of the tournament. Sopho
more Brittany Lang paced the
Blue Devils with a school-record
64 on the first day and finished
third individually.
After last year's Blue Devil
team was considered possibly the
best college squad in history, this
year's edition looked no weaker
despite losing impact seniors
Leigh Anne Hardin and Virada

Nirapathpongporn to graduation.
"We still have a lot of talent on
this team, and it's exciting to come
out and win this tournament to
start the year," Duke head coach
Dan Brooks said.
The Blue Devils have now won
a ridiculous 23 of their last 28 tour
naments.
While Duke continued its win
ning ways, Stanford struggled a bit
in the early going, recording a 16-
over-par 300 on the first day of play
as the team dropped into 13th
place after 18 holes. The poor start
left 12 teams and 17 strokes be
tween Stanford and the lead, es
sentially ending any hopes of a top
five finish in the season's inaugural
event.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal
fought on gamely, returning with a
295 on the second day, led by
Tangtiphaiboontana. She fired her
second consecutive 73 and sat in
22nd place individually heading
into the final day of competition.

The rest of the team bounced back from a
tough first day as well. Senior Wendra Liang shot
her best round of the tournament, 74, and junior
Kelly Husted improved on her opening 79 with a
74 to match Liang.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, much of the
second day's momentum seemed to vanish
overnight, and the team stumbled in a final round
in which three of the five players carded their
worst scores of the event.
"We still need to work on our short games a
great deal," sophomore Lauren Todd said. "That
is the thing that separated us from the teams at
the very top."
One lonely bright spot for Stanford on the
final day was the play of Husted, who posted the
team's best individual round of the tournament.
Three birdies on the back nine and one at the
final hole secured a 71 and the best score of her
collegiate career.
Junior Stephanie Lue also played solidly in

the final round, carding a 73 en route to a 57th
place finish overall.
After two rounds of nice play. Tangtiphai
boontana faltered badly in her last 18 holes,
shooting 77 and dropping down to 4()th place to
tie with Husted and a host of others.
Sophomore Lauren Todd posted a pair of
double-bogeys on the front nine and never re
covered, shooting 78. She slid down the leader
board to finish in a tie for 66th place.
Liang rounded out the Cardinal's scores.
After hanging tough through the first two days,
she disintegrated amidst a flock of bogeys on the
back nine, and shot 81. Liang tied for 78th place.
Despite finishing in the middle of the pack,
there was optimism to be found on this young
team.
"We are pretty confident about our games
right now," Lue said. "We all showed glimpses of
excellence this weekend and can't wait for the
rest oi the season."
The No. 20 Stanford women's
golf team understands that the col
lege golf season is a marathon, not
a sprint.
The Cardinal began the season
with a 12th-place finish at the Mer
cedes-Benz of Bend Fall Preview
Sept. 20-22. Meanwhile, No. 1
Duke picked up right where it left
off a year ago by claiming an im
pressive six-stroke victory over an
elite field.
Unlike many regular-season
events, the Fall Preview normally
attracts teams from across the
country. This year's tournament
was no exception, as the nation's
strongest teams descended upon
the par-71 Meadows Course in
Sunriver, Ore. fora three-day
competition and the official start of
the golf season.
"This tournament had one of
the strongest fields of teams aside
from nationals," sophomore Jenrti
Tangtiphaiboontana said. "This

tou,rnament gave us a good insight
of what we, as a team, need to work
on over the year to prepare for [the
NCAA Championship]."
