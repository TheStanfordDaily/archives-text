# Cal water polo squad honors legendary coach Pete Cutino
## 
### GINA MERLONE THE DAILY CALIFORNIAN (UC-BERKELEY 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. — Most
people don't get awards named for them until
after they die.
Pete Cutino, however, was not most people.
The venerated Cal men's water polo coach
passed away Sept. 19, but the Peter J. Cutino
award — the water polo equivalent of the
Heisman trophy — was established in his
honor five years ago.
Such is the legend of Pete Cutino, whose
memorial service was held Friday in Mon
terey, Calif.
The Bears' water polo match against Pa
cific — scheduled for the same day as the ser
vice — was postponed so the team could at
tend. Current players paid their respects
alongside former ones who flew in from all
over the country — one from as far as North
Carolina.
Cutino's tenure at Cal began in 1963,
coaching the men's swim team for 12 years
(1963-74) and the water polo team for 26
(1963-88).
Well known for his intimidating stature,
loud voice and intense personality, Cutino
often treated water polo spectators to two
shows — the one in the pool, as his Bears con
sistently thrashed their competition, and the
one on deck, as he made his opinion clear
about every play and call.
"He was a strong figure." said Ben Maser,
who played for Cutino at Cal from 1983 to
'87. "He had this way of motivating you — he
was a guy who could be angry with you and
you would love him at the same time."
Cutino's distinct coaching style apparently

worked, as his teams were national champi
ons eight times (1973, '74, '75. '77, '83. '84, '87,
'88) and runners-up another four (1969, '78,
'80, '86).
Cutino won his fair share of coaching
awards as well.
He was a four-time NCAA and Pac-10
coach of the year, head coach of the U.S. na
tional (1972-76), World University (1987)
and Olympic (1976) teams and received the
College Swim Coaches' Association's Mas
ter Coach Award, considered the most dis
tinguished accolade in aquatics.
"Pete created this program and he's had a
huge influence on the sport." said current
Bears water polo coach Kirk Everist.
Everist would know — Cutino was his
coach when he played for Cal from 1986-88.
An NCAA All-American three years in a
row, 1988 Pac-10 and NCAA Player of the
Year and member of two national title-winning
teams, Everist said he owes a lot to Cutino.
"Pete was about as close to a father as I can
lose. He is the reason why I'm coaching at
Cal," Everist said.
Everist was only one among many in Cuti
no's stable of stars. Cutino coached five men
who ended up on Olympic teams, six NCAA
and Pac-10 Players of the Year — one of
them his son, Peter Cutino, Jr. — and 68 All-
Americans.
But it wasn't just the stars who Cutino
touched.
"The thing I remember most about him
was that he was a very inclusive guy," said
Maser. "1 mean. 1 was no Kirk Everist. but he
still made me feel a part of the team. Every
one was important.
"To this day, I miss playing, and I think
that's because I miss being coached by him."
