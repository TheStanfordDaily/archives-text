# Chem dept. changes core classes

### MEGAN WATKINS 
The chemistry department has made changes to
its core classes to help students fulfill major require
ments and to make the department more accessible
to non-majors.
Starting this fall, the introductory Chem 31 class
will be divided into two tracks. Chem 31X will be a
more grueling track that replicates what was previ
ously known as Chem 31. A new series, Chem 31A
and Chem 318. will cover the same material over two
quarters.
According to Chemistry Professor Richard Zare,
the new series is designed in part for those students
without high school chemistry experience and for
those who want a less intense introduction to college
level material.
"The undergraduate population has a vast range
of backgrounds and we want to be able to accommo
date all of these people," he said. "Contrary to popu
lar belief, we don't want to make people suffer."
The less intense track, he added, was not intended
solely for non-majors.
"We hope chemistry majors will come from

[both] tracks," Zare said.
The changes will also help non-majors who need
to take chemistry for other concentrations, like biol
ogy and engineering, or for students try ing to fulfill
medical school requirements, he added.
So far, some students have voiced optimism about
the new sequences.
"Chem 31A and Chem 318 are probably better
options for freshman," said Cailean Cooke, a sopho
more pre-med who took Chem 30,31 and 33 last year.
"Chem 31 covered a lot of material and spreading
it over two quarters would definitely allow kids to un
derstand the stuff better before starting organic
chemistry," she added.
Cooke took Chem 30 last fall, a class that was de
signed to prepare students for Chem 31, but she said
that she found the class unhelpful in her later studies.
Chem 30 is no longer offered by the department.
Christy Titchenal, a freshman considering an en
gineering major, agreed that the new series was a
smart idea.
"Chemistry is a complicated subject and some peo
ple will need more time to process it," Titchenal said,
though she added that she will still take Chem 3IX.

Zare said that the curricular changes being imple
mented this fall are the most significant of those he
has seen during his 27-year career at Stanford.
In addition to offering Chem 31A and Chem 318,
the department is now allowing students to take
Chem 35 and Chem 130 concurrently, which will give
students more flexibility in completing major re
quirements.
Sophomore Rand Miller sees benefits for chem
istry majors in these changes. This arrangement, he
said, will enable students to take Chem 33 and Chem
36, a lab course, simultaneously.
"I think that is good because it allows lab work to
correspond to lecture material," he said.
Some students had suggestions for further im
provements to the curriculum.
Freshman Adam Monroe, a likely chemistry
major, said that offering Chem 33 in the fall would
allow experienced and motivated freshmen to accel
erate their progress in the discipline. Currently,
Chem 33 is only offered in the winter. On the recent
changes, however, he was more blunt.
"Maybe the name of chemistry won't be such a
kiss of death," Monroe said.
