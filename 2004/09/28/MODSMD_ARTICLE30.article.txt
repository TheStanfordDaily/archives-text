### JUSTIN KUNKEL THE DAILY COLLEGIAN (PENN STATE 
(U-WIRE) UNIVERSITY PARK.
Pa. â€” Duke Hashimoto had a week
end almost as great as his name, but
when push came to shove he just
couldn't contend with the Penn State
men's soccer team's overtime magic.
Hashimoto scored four goals in
No. 15 Southern Methodist Universi
ty's two games on the weekend, but
with 10 seconds left in the first over
time in Sunday's match with Penn
State, he found the ball on his foot
with nothing standing between him
and a game winning goal except 10
yards worth of green grass. And the
crossbar, which he in turn nailed as
time expired.
About five minutes later Joe Zewe
scored his second goal of the game,
and the Nittany Lions ran their un
beaten streak to a national best 11
games.
The 3-2 win, combined with Fri
day's 3-2 victory against No. 25 Tulsa
improved the Lions to 5-0-3 on the
season.
Friday. Penn State jumped out to
an early lead as midfielder Mike Lin
demann scored only 4:43 into the
game. Chad Severs added two goals
of his own before halftime. and the
Lions barely survived a furious sec
ond-half rally from Tulsa that includ
ed two goals from All-American
Ryan Pore.
Sunday afternoon the Lions twice
trailed in the game, the first time the
Lions had trailed since Sept. 10 against
Georgetown, but proved their resilien
cy by coming back to win the game.
For the second weekend in a row
Penn State's bench put in a fantastic
effort, with reserve forwards Yan
Carvalho and Zewe combining for all
three of Penn State's goals.
Penn State coach Barry Gorman
appreciated the effort, but said that
the strong play of the bench was not
unexpected.
"That's what they have to do,"
said Gorman. "They gave us valuable
minutes today."
SMU's talented front line put the
Lions under extreme pressure for much
of the second half, but the defense re
sponded with what may have been its
best performance of the season.
Gorman praised all the defenders,
highlighting Markku Viitanen, Pasi
Karppinen, Stephen Rheiner, Antho
ny Calvano, and David Gray. He also
said that the midfield played a large
part in a total defensive effort and
that Brian Devlin and David Walters,
"put in a yeoman's effort."
Freshman goalkeeper Conrad
Taylor continued his spectacular
play in the net. making seven saves
including many that kept Penn State
in the game shortly after falling be
hind, 2-1.
Penn State also finished its
chances extremely well on the week
end, and for the first time this year,
the Lion's offense could be described
as opportunistic. All of Penn States
three goals Sunday came on only four
shots on goal.
