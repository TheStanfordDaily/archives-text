# FLiCKS revamps to boost attendance
## 
### CYNTHIA H. CHO MANAGING EDITOR 
A 67-year old Stanford tradition is
getting a facelift.
For the first time in its history,
FLiCKS will offer students two week
ends to catch a movie. If you miss the
10 p.m. showing of "Shrek 2" on Oct. 3,
the first night of screening for the 2004-
2005 season, you can catch the green
ogre. Princess Fiona and their friends
again next weekend at 7 p.m. Also, 11
movies will be shown each quarter in
stead of 10.
"We know that attendance hasn't
really been the best the last two years,
and we looked into it and, really, the
reason is that people are so busy," said
sophomore Debby Chang, manager
for FLiCKS, in an interview.
Justin Fishner-Wolfson, chief exec
utive officer of Stanford Student En
terprises, which oversees FLiCKS, said
that last year's attendance "dropped
noticeably" from the previous year.
One of the main reasons for the
changes is to increase profits for the or
ganization. Chang said in an interview
that it "hasn't been in the best of finan
cial situations." She added that in recent
years, technical costs have increased at
least 50 percent, mainly because the ris
ing costs of movie budgets have caused
prices to rise across the board.
A problem that FLiCKS has faced
for the past few years was students
handing over passes to one another at
the door.
"Some people would enter the the
ater and then pass their pass to some
one outside the theater," Chang said.
"What ended up happening is that
people have been doing it more often,"
Chang said. Students also let their

peers borrow their FLiCKS passes on
Sunday afternoons, students often
send pass requests via e-mail to their
dormlists.
Junior Brian Salomaki said that
during his freshman year, he did not
buy a pass fall and winter quarters but
used his friends' passes when they did
not use them.
Starting this year, students must
present photo identification for entry.
Individual passes are $25; last year, it
was $22. Also, dorm resident advisors
have the option of buying $40 dorm
passes that do not require photo iden
tification and can be used by anyone in
that dorm. In the past, some residences
bought several individual passes for
the entire dorm to share; this year is the
first time that FLiCKS is offering a
dorm pass.
Salomaki, a resident assistant in
Alondra, said that many freshmen do
purchase individual passes. He and his
staff have not decided whether they
will purchase dorm passes. But he
added that the new policy would "pre
vent some people from going" to
FLiCKS.
"I'll encourage freshmen to go be
cause it's a good way to see recent
movies, cheaply," Salomaki said.
"Plus, freshmen can't go off campus to
see movies. And it's a fun Stanford tra
dition."
One of Salomaki's residents, fresh
man Adrian lon, said that he plans to
go to FLiCKS this weekend. A self-de
scribed "movie fan," he said that if he
has never seen a movie being screened,
he will go to the "quiet" show at 7 p.m.
But. if a large group of his dormmates
goes to the later show, he would go
with them.
If, unlike lon, you're not a film buff

but rather a Jamba Juice junkie, there
may still be a reason for you to invest in
a FLiCKS pass. With a FLiCKS pass at
the on-campus smoothie spot, students
will receive a $0.50 discount per pur
chase throughout fall quarter. FLiCKS
hopes to expand this kind of discount
program to include other businesses
on or around campus for winter and
spring quarters.
"We approached this year thinking
that we needed to increase customer
appreciation of FLiCKS," Chang said.
