### ERIK J. HOPE 
Former U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz and Nobel Prize win
ners Milton Friedman and Gary S.
Becker are among nine Hoover Insti
tution fellows selected on Sept. 17 by
Calif. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
to his 16-member Council of Eco
nomic Advisers.
The council is a group of econo
mists and policy advisers who will be
working for the governor without
pay. Hoover fellow Martin Ander
son, a former policy adviser to Presi
dents Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan, said he is expecting to work
on implementing the policy propos
als Schwarzenegger made during his
campaign. The council will have pri
vate meetings with the governor and
on its own. It will first assemble on
Oct. 4.
"This is a group of brilliant indi
viduals with a clear understanding of
the complexities of our economy
and the steps necessary to rebuild
it," Schwarzenegger said in a state
ment released on his Web site. "I
look forward to gaining their insight
and advice as we work together to
improve California's economic and
jobs climate."
The other Hoover fellows named
to the council are Annelise Anderson
and John Cogan, the former associate
and deputy directors, respectively, of
the Office of Management and Bud
get under Reagan; Michael J. Boskin.
former chairman of President
George H.W. Bush's Council of Eco
nomic Advisers; John Shoven, cur

rent research associate at the Nation
al Bureau of Economic Research;
and James Sweeney, a senior fellow
at the U.S. Association of Energy
Economics and at the Stanford Insti
tute for Economic Policy Research.
Located on the upper floors of
Hoover Tower and the nearby Lou
Henry Hoover and Herbert Hoover
Memorial Buildings, the Hoover In
stitution was founded by Herbert
Hoover in 1919 as an archive of docu
ments about the causes and effects of
World War I.
It has since grown to become one
of the nation's leading centers for
conservative economic and policy re
search and a haven for former gov
ernment officials and presidential ad
visers. There are currently over 100
Hoover research fellows.
Among other distinguished cur
rent and former Hoover fellows are
Nobel Prize winners Douglass North,
Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Michael
Spence. Former Secretary of Defense
and Stanford professor William
Perry and current National Security
Adviser Condoleezza Rice are also
Hoover fellows.
"The people at Hoover study pol
icy around the clock," Anderson said.
"The people on this committee have
been advising presidents fora long
time."
Council appointee James
Sweeney — a professor in the Man
agement Science and Engineering
department who was selected for
the council to conduct energy and

— said that his work at Stanford
and his work for the council
would compliment each other.
Sweeney teaches courses in eco
nomics of natural resources and
in energy and environmental
policy analysis.
"It is clear that my work here
at Stanford will underlie my role
on the council,"he said. "And
my work on the council is apt to
help my teaching role here at
Stanford."
According to Anderson, the
council will operate as a panel of
private individuals, not as a group
that is beholden to the governor.
"Because (the council mem
bers) don't work for the govern
ment. they can speak freely," he
said. "They are all very indepen
dent people."
However, critics of the ap
pointees would like more points
of view to be represented. Jean
Ross, executive director of the

Group criticizes Gov.'s
selection of advisors

California Budget Project in
Sacramento, thinks that the coun
cil is too conservative.
"I think it represents a very
narrow and not particularly main
stream spectrum of the econom
ics profession," she said in a tele
phone interview. "The state
would be better served by having
a diversity of opinion."
Ross said she does not believe
that choosing advisors for such a
council should be a partisan issue,
and she named the UCLA An
derson Forecast, an economic
think tank, as another resource
that the governor should have
tapped while assembling his
council.
"I don't think it is a partisan
issue," Ross said. "There are
some people who are very distin
guished with respect to their
knowledge of the California
economy, and the Governor
could benefit from their work."
In response, Anderson replied

that the political and economic
beliefs of those on the council re
flect the governor's.
"(The governor) will talk to
people who have views which he's
comfortable with," he said.
Anderson also disagreed that
the appointment of a committee
such as this one is a nonpartisan
issue, pointing out that Democ
rats do the same thing.
"One of the things about the
political process is that when De
mocrats win, they don't bring in
Republicans to advise them," he
said.
Despite these criticisms, An
derson and Sweeney are looking
forward to meeting with the rest
of the council and with the Gover
nor to solidify an agenda. Right
now, council members do not
know where their efforts will be
focused when they begin work.
"Where it goes depends on
what the governor wants," An
derson said.
