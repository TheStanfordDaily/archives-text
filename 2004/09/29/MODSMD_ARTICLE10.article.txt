19931 Sports games free to students
On Sept. 29,1993, the Daily ran a story about free student ad
mittance to athletic events.
"Budget crunch? What budget crunch??
Thanks to a financing program formulated by the Department
of Athletics over the summer, students will now be admitted free
to virtually all Cardinal athletic contests.
The $2 student ticket charge that was instituted in 1990 for all
home sporting events other than football and basketball has been
eliminated. Free passes will also be issued to the first 1,500 Stan
ford students attending each Cardinal men's and women's bas
ketball home game.
Even the price of the 1992 football season package — a deal
that includes a ticket to this year's Big Game in Berkeley — has
been reduced from $50 to $32.
According to Associate Athletic Director Tom Beckett, the
changes were brought about because of research done over the
past year by the Athletics Department's marketing committee.
'We've received lots of input from [the marketing committee's]
student focus group,' Beckett said. 'One thing that kept ringing
through was that students found it difficult to watch events that
were costing them a couple of dollars.'"
1979 I Sororities await university recognition
On September 29, 1979, the Daily ran a story about the sorori
ties' renewal bid.
"The fate of the seven sororities here is now in the hands of ad
ministration officials, who are reviewing the groups' applications
for official University recognition.
The sororities, formed after a 33-year ban was lifted in Decem
ber 1977, are awaiting decisions that are expected within two
weeks from Assoc. Dean of Residential Education Norm Robin
son, Student Activities Adviser Patricia Brandt, the Committee
on Services to Students and, ultimately. Dean of Students James
Lyons.
Lyons said he 'hasn't seen the proposals recently,' but added,
'Last spring it looked to me like a number of them were well on the
way to recognition, both in their intent and their policies.'"
