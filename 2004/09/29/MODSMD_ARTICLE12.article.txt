# Stanford Names Among List of Richest Americans
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford alumni Larry Page
and Sergey Brin, whose Internet
search engine company went pub
lic this year, made Forbes Maga
zine's annual list of "The 400 Rich
est Americans" for their first time.
Tied for 43rd place, the Google
founders each possess an estimat
ed personal fortune of $4 billion.
The 31-year-old entrepreneurs
were the youngest people to make
the list.
After meeting at Stanford while
pursuing graduate degrees in com
puter science, the pair created
Google in 1998 and opened their
first office in a garage. They
watched their wealth skyrocket
after taking the company public in
August. Brin now serves as presi
dent of technology, and Page runs
the product division.
Forbes creates its list by calcu
lating the estimated value of stock
and other assets, such as real estate,
held by the wealthiest Americans.
A number of other former
Stanford students also appear on
the list, including Yahoo founders
David Filo and Jerry Yang. Filo,

who is 38 years old. was no. 74 on
the list with a fortune of $2.6 bil
lion. 35-year-old Yang was ranked
97th, with $2.2 billion.
"It's great to see many technol
ogy-based companies and techies
on the list," said Riitta Katila, an
assistant professor in the depart
ment of Management Science and
Engineering, in an e-mail to The
Daily. "It shows that technology
and engineering provide opportu
nities for success."
Katila. whose research focuses
on technology strategy and organi
zational evolution and change, said
that the publicity might not be en
tirely a good thing for those on the
list who run businesses.
"While publicity is often benefi
cial for companies, some recent re
search suggests that the celebrity
status of CEOs or top managers
has its risks too," she said. "It may
start taking away from running the
business, or distracting the CEOs,
and eventually may hurt the per
formance of the company."
On the other hand, it could
help the leaders' images, accord
ing to Kathleen Eisenhardt, a
management science and engi
neering professor widely known

for her work on strategy, strategic
decision-making and innovation
in rapidly changing and highly
competitive markets.
"At least some people might
construe it as a scorecard — like
getting an A-plus in 'starting com
panies'" Eisenhardt said in an e
mail.
California had the most resi
dents on the Forbes list — there
were 98. The Bay Area alone is
home to 44 people on the list.
"This is an extraordinarily fer
tile climate for innovation —
probably best in the world,"
Eisenhardt said. "Plus, the weath
er is also attractive."
Microsoft co-founder Bill
Gates topped the list with $48 bil
lion. 313 people listed have $1 bil
lion or more.
Other people who attended
Stanford and made the list include
Riley and Stephen Bechtel, co
owners of the engineering giant
that bears their name; Gap
founders John, William and
Robert Fisher, Cisco chairman
John Morgridge: real estate mogul
John Arrillaga; Stephen Bing;
Leonore Annenberg; and Penny
Pritzker.
