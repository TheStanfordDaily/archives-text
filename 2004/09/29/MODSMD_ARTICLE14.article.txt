# When cramming isn't enough...
## Students use cell phones to cheat 
### CAROLINE CICCONE STAFF WRITER 
It used to be that professors considered cellphones
annoying for interrupting lectures. But now, they have
another reason to keep cell phones out of classrooms:
Students across the country are using cell phones to
cheat on exams.
A camera phone can store pictures of graphs, formu
las, you name it. Answers can be shared via text-messag
ing.
This trend is alarming to many educators and some,
like Stanford economics instructor Mark Tendall, are
taking action to prevent this sort of cheating.
"I have included a few words about cell phone use
('no visible cellphones') to my usual Honor Code re
minders before exams ... but as far as I am aware, we
have not yet had any specific cases (actual or alleged
cheating) in the economics department," he wrote in an
e-mail.
On campus, officials at the Office of Judicial Affairs,
a division of the Office of the Dean of Students, the use
of cell phones to cheat hasn't become a problem yet.
Laurette Beeson, judicial advisor, said that in her five
years at Stanford, there has been only one case brought
to Judicial Affairs involving the use of cell phones in
cheating.
The case, processed in fall quarter 2002, involved two
students accused of text messaging each other during an
in-class exam. Both students produced their cell phone
records, which showed no incidence of this text messag
ing. Due to lack of evidence, the case was withdrawn.
"The more articles I've read say it's happening on the
high school level," Beeson said. But other than the 2002
incident, she has not seen any evidence of cell phone
cheating on campus.
An article published in the Wall Street Journal on
Sept 10 cited examples of picture-sending at Virginia
State University and text-messaging at the University of
Maryland. The article reported that cell phone use dur
ing exams is a growing form of cheating.
While this kind of cheating may not be taking place on
campus, some students are aware of the cell phone's ca
pability as a cheating tool.
Arihant Jain. Class 2004, says that the use of cell

phones to cheat is common in private high schools in
India, where he is from.
"What's more interesting is when people are in the
same examination room," Jain said. "Under their proc
tor's nose, people are ballsy enough to exchange an
swers, to exchange pictures."
That's not to say that cheating using cell phones
doesn't happen here, Beeson admits. Similarly, it's im
possible to compare the actual incidence of cheating to
the number of accused or charged perpetrators.
"We don't have any way to measure what's not com
ing to us," Beeson said.
Yuen said that there is a lot of potential for abusing
technology to cheat.
"There are so many different mediums for storing in
formation — iPods, Blackberries, Treos, cell phones,"
he said.
For now, Beeson hopes to educate professors and
teaching assistants about their roles and responsibilities
involving the Honor Code, and the possibility of cell
phone use in cheating.
"Teaching staff are more aware of the possibility,"
Beeson said.
Employees of the Office of Judicial Affairs are aware
that cell phone cheating may become more prevalent as
students become more comfortable and knowledgeable
of the capabilities of technology.
Beeson believes that this sort of preventative educa
tion can help students to realize when someone might
think they are cheating, even when they are not. Then stu
dents can protect themselves from a wrongful accusation.
"You want to help students avoid the appearance [of
cheating]," Beeson said.
At least for now, students, professors and administra
tors are becoming aware of this new form of cheating.
Beeson says there is little harm in reporting in question
able situation.
"People certainly can report them and should," she
said. If students see something disconcerting, under the
honor code, students are obligated to do something. Peo
ple should be asked to get off their cellphones [in class]."
As of July 16, the Office of Judicial Affairs reviewed
65 cases involving honor code violations in 2004.
There were 104 cases in 2000-01,84 in 2001-02 and %
in 2002-03.

ing. Due to lack of evidence, the case was withdrawn.
"The more articles I've read say it's happening on the
high school level," Beeson said. But other than the 2002
incident, she has not seen any evidence of cell phone
cheating on campus.
An article published in the Wall Street Journal on
Sept 10 cited examples of picture-sending at Virginia
State University and text-messaging at the University of
Maryland. The article reported that cell phone use dur
ing exams is a growing form of cheating.
While this kind of cheating may not be taking place on
campus, some students are aware of the cell phone's ca
pability as a cheating tool.
Arihant Jain. Class 2004, says that the use of cell

phones to cheat is common in private high schools in
India, where he is from.
"What's more interesting is when people are in the
same examination room," Jain said. "Under their proc
tor's nose, people are ballsy enough to exchange an
swers, to exchange pictures."
That's not to say that cheating using cell phones
doesn't happen here, Beeson admits. Similarly, it's im
possible to compare the actual incidence of cheating to
the number of accused or charged perpetrators.
"We don't have any way to measure what's not com
ing to us," Beeson said.
Yuen said that there is a lot of potential for abusing
technology to cheat.
"There are so many different mediums for storing in
formation — iPods, Blackberries, Treos, cell phones,"
he said.
For now, Beeson hopes to educate professors and
teaching assistants about their roles and responsibilities
involving the Honor Code, and the possibility of cell
phone use in cheating.
"Teaching staff are more aware of the possibility,"
Beeson said.
Employees of the Office of Judicial Affairs are aware
that cell phone cheating may become more prevalent as
students become more comfortable and knowledgeable
of the capabilities of technology.
Beeson believes that this sort of preventative educa
tion can help students to realize when someone might
think they are cheating, even when they are not. Then stu
dents can protect themselves from a wrongful accusation.
"You want to help students avoid the appearance [of
cheating]," Beeson said.
At least for now, students, professors and administra
tors are becoming aware of this new form of cheating.
Beeson says there is little harm in reporting in question
able situation.
"People certainly can report them and should," she
said. If students see something disconcerting, under the
honor code, students are obligated to do something. Peo
ple should be asked to get off their cellphones [in class]."
As of July 16, the Office of Judicial Affairs reviewed
65 cases involving honor code violations in 2004.
There were 104 cases in 2000-01,84 in 2001-02 and %
in 2002-03.
