# In Stanford Running Club, students stay in shape by running ... Marathons
## 
### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This summer, Olympians re
turned to the home of the most
legendary long-distance race,
running from the town of
Marathon to the city of Athens.
On campus, students are also
undertaking the arduous task of
training for the 26-mile-and-385-
yard-long race.
Seasoned runners and first
time marathon trainees are hit
ting the turf to prepare for
marathons around the country,
training both independently and
with the help of running groups
on campus.
That Stanford students are
training and running marathons
may reflect a larger trend.
According to some marathon
organizers, more young people in
their twenties are now participat
ing in races.
Junior Pam Morganroth ran
her first marathon as a freshman
and is now training for her third
visit to the Napa Valley
Marathon in March.
As a member of the student
organized Stanford Running
Club, an informal group that
meets three times a week, she has
had the opportunity to meet peo
ple with similar running goals.
Morganroth said that marathons
are not just for competitive run
ners, pointing out that many
marathons also offer walking op
tions.
"Marathons used to be re
stricted to disciplined athletes,
but they are becoming much
more common among average
people who just want to increase
their fitness level," Morganroth
said.
The Running Club, a group for
former competitive cross country
runners like Morganroth to meet
and new runners to get involved,
boasts a consistent number of
members who have participated
in marathons.
According to senior Dan An
thony, last year three Running
Club participants ran in the
Boston Marathon and five in the
Napa Valley marathon.
"When I'm doing four hour
training runs, I often question
whether I'm crazy, but with those
final steps over the finish line I
change my mind and decide that
it's worth it," Morganroth said. "I
also promise myself that I'll never
do a marathon again, but each
year I forget that promise and
start training again."
Biology graduate student
Charlie Anderson, co-president
of the Stanford Triathlon Club,
said that while competing in a
marathon is very painful it is a eu
phoric experience.
He is currently training for the
Philadelphia Marathon in No
vember.
"I want to run marathons be

cause they provide a great, chal
lenging goal for my exercise,"
Anderson said. "Finishing one
feels like a real accomplishment."
Despite a growing trend of
young athletes, training fora
marathon is not something that
should be undertaken lightly, said
Eric Bean, the Stanford Triathlon
Team coach. He cautions every
one who is looking to train for any
large-scale race to follow appro
priate training schedules.
"Make sure you allow yourself
plenty of time to work up slowly,"
Bean said. "This isn't the sort of
thing that should be done on a
whim because there is a great po
tential for injury."
While a person's training regi
men will vary depending on their
background, Bean suggests that
people begin training at least six
months in advance to be really in
top shape.
Bean, a former professional
tri-athlete, also coaches outside
of Stanford. He detailed four dif
ferent cycles of training in
preparing fora marathon. The
first is a base cycle where the
focus is to prepare the body by
conditioning the muscles and
joints for dealing with the
mileage.
"Every time you run, your
joints absorb three times your
body weight," Bean said. "There
fore, you have to progress run
ning mileage very slowly. The
benefits from training are a func
tion of how much time you spend
training, not the intensity of the
training."
After six to eight weeks of base
training. Bean moves on to what
he calls the economy phase where
the focus is on running efficiently.
During this time, a runner should
continue to slowly add mileage to
their workout.
At the same time, the focus
should be on running short, fast
intervals with perfect form and
increasing speed and endurance.
Bean noted that elite distance
runners run at 180 strides per
minute which has been found to
be the most efficient pace.
Next, comes the six week long
VO2 Max phase where trainees
will work on boosting their body's
ability to produce the maximum
amount of oxygen. These inter
vals are slower, but cover more
distance with less rest.
"This is the most arduous
training phase an athlete will go
through," Bean warned. "While
it is the most intense and painful,
it is also the most rewarding."
The final part is the long-run
phase, which is a combination of a
short faster run, a one hour long
run, followed up with another
faster run.
This phase will prepare run
ners for their marathons by
boosting endurance and teaching
them to run fast even when they
are tired.

This Sunday, over 7,000 run
ners will be participating in the
Portland Marathon.
According to Les Sherwood,
the Event Director, people are
coming from 48 states and 15 dif
ferent countries to participate. Its
participants range from 18 to 90
years old.
For the Portland Marathon,
the average age for women par
ticipants is 34, and for men, 35.
Sherwood noted that in his 22
years working for this event, he
has seen a trend for more people
between the ages of 20 and 30 to
participate, which he attributes to
the involvement of different char
ity organizations using marathon
running as a source of fundraising.
About one-third of this
marathon's participants are walk
ers. Sherwood boasted that this is
one of the most walker-friendly
marathons because there is no
time limit and the route will not
close early.
Other Stanford students had
suggestions for possible
marathons to run. Morganroth
was partial to the Napa Valley
Marathon.
"Napa is a great race, and I
recommend it to anyone consid
ering a marathon," Morganroth
said. "It's small, but the fans are
very supportive.
"People line the streets with
all kinds of little treats for the
runners, from the mundane water
and Gatorade to trays of Vaseline
and even assorted cups of sorbet.
In addition, because the race is
sponsored by the vineyards, the
winners win their weight in wine."
Ben Cowen suggested the
Boston Marathon, which he had
just participated in this past April
because of a certain leg of the
race which went through Welles
ley College.
"The Wellesley students have
a tradition where they watch the
race and just scream at the top of
their lungs to cheer the runners
on," Cowen recounted.
"All of a sudden all these guys
start to pass me. Then I realize of
course that it's because of the
Wellesley girls. A half a mile
later, after the race has left
Wellesley, I pass the same guys.
They're walking.
"Some of them had their
phone numbers written on their
backs."
For training, several seasoned
runners suggested looking to the
Stanford Running Club for route
suggestions and to find people to
run with.
Anthony, who is working to
wards his fourth marathon, is glad
for the opportunities he's had
running with the club.
"Stanford is a good time to
start because of friends to work
with, great weather and terrain to
train in.and the opportunity to be
in the best shape of your life,"
Anthony said.

members who have participated
in marathons.
According to senior Dan An
thony, last year three Running
Club participants ran in the
Boston Marathon and five in the
Napa Valley marathon.
"When I'm doing four hour
training runs, I often question
whether I'm crazy, but with those
final steps over the finish line I
change my mind and decide that
it's worth it," Morganroth said. "I
also promise myself that I'll never
do a marathon again, but each
year I forget that promise and
start training again."
Biology graduate student
Charlie Anderson, co-president
of the Stanford Triathlon Club,
said that while competing in a
marathon is very painful it is a eu
phoric experience.
He is currently training for the
Philadelphia Marathon in No
vember.
"I want to run marathons be

cause they provide a great, chal
lenging goal for my exercise,"
Anderson said. "Finishing one
feels like a real accomplishment."
Despite a growing trend of
young athletes, training fora
marathon is not something that
should be undertaken lightly, said
Eric Bean, the Stanford Triathlon
Team coach. He cautions every
one who is looking to train for any
large-scale race to follow appro
priate training schedules.
"Make sure you allow yourself
plenty of time to work up slowly,"
Bean said. "This isn't the sort of
thing that should be done on a
whim because there is a great po
tential for injury."
While a person's training regi
men will vary depending on their
background, Bean suggests that
people begin training at least six
months in advance to be really in
top shape.
Bean, a former professional
tri-athlete, also coaches outside
of Stanford. He detailed four dif
ferent cycles of training in
preparing fora marathon. The
first is a base cycle where the
focus is to prepare the body by
conditioning the muscles and
joints for dealing with the
mileage.
"Every time you run, your
joints absorb three times your
body weight," Bean said. "There
fore, you have to progress run
ning mileage very slowly. The
benefits from training are a func
tion of how much time you spend
training, not the intensity of the
training."
After six to eight weeks of base
training. Bean moves on to what
he calls the economy phase where
the focus is on running efficiently.
During this time, a runner should
continue to slowly add mileage to
their workout.
At the same time, the focus
should be on running short, fast
intervals with perfect form and
increasing speed and endurance.
Bean noted that elite distance
runners run at 180 strides per
minute which has been found to
be the most efficient pace.
Next, comes the six week long
VO2 Max phase where trainees
will work on boosting their body's
ability to produce the maximum
amount of oxygen. These inter
vals are slower, but cover more
distance with less rest.
"This is the most arduous
training phase an athlete will go
through," Bean warned. "While
it is the most intense and painful,
it is also the most rewarding."
The final part is the long-run
phase, which is a combination of a
short faster run, a one hour long
run, followed up with another
faster run.
This phase will prepare run
ners for their marathons by
boosting endurance and teaching
them to run fast even when they
are tired.

This Sunday, over 7,000 run
ners will be participating in the
Portland Marathon.
According to Les Sherwood,
the Event Director, people are
coming from 48 states and 15 dif
ferent countries to participate. Its
participants range from 18 to 90
years old.
For the Portland Marathon,
the average age for women par
ticipants is 34, and for men, 35.
Sherwood noted that in his 22
years working for this event, he
has seen a trend for more people
between the ages of 20 and 30 to
participate, which he attributes to
the involvement of different char
ity organizations using marathon
running as a source of fundraising.
About one-third of this
marathon's participants are walk
ers. Sherwood boasted that this is
one of the most walker-friendly
marathons because there is no
time limit and the route will not
close early.
Other Stanford students had
suggestions for possible
marathons to run. Morganroth
was partial to the Napa Valley
Marathon.
"Napa is a great race, and I
recommend it to anyone consid
ering a marathon," Morganroth
said. "It's small, but the fans are
very supportive.
"People line the streets with
all kinds of little treats for the
runners, from the mundane water
and Gatorade to trays of Vaseline
and even assorted cups of sorbet.
In addition, because the race is
sponsored by the vineyards, the
winners win their weight in wine."
Ben Cowen suggested the
Boston Marathon, which he had
just participated in this past April
because of a certain leg of the
race which went through Welles
ley College.
"The Wellesley students have
a tradition where they watch the
race and just scream at the top of
their lungs to cheer the runners
on," Cowen recounted.
"All of a sudden all these guys
start to pass me. Then I realize of
course that it's because of the
Wellesley girls. A half a mile
later, after the race has left
Wellesley, I pass the same guys.
They're walking.
"Some of them had their
phone numbers written on their
backs."
For training, several seasoned
runners suggested looking to the
Stanford Running Club for route
suggestions and to find people to
run with.
Anthony, who is working to
wards his fourth marathon, is glad
for the opportunities he's had
running with the club.
"Stanford is a good time to
start because of friends to work
with, great weather and terrain to
train in.and the opportunity to be
in the best shape of your life,"
Anthony said.
This summer, Olympians re
turned to the home of the most
legendary long-distance race,
running from the town of
Marathon to the city of Athens.
On campus, students are also
undertaking the arduous task of
training for the 26-mile-and-385-
yard-long race.
Seasoned runners and first
time marathon trainees are hit
ting the turf to prepare for
marathons around the country,
training both independently and
with the help of running groups
on campus.
That Stanford students are
training and running marathons
may reflect a larger trend.
According to some marathon
organizers, more young people in
their twenties are now participat
ing in races.
Junior Pam Morganroth ran
her first marathon as a freshman
and is now training for her third
visit to the Napa Valley
Marathon in March.
As a member of the student
organized Stanford Running
Club, an informal group that
meets three times a week, she has
had the opportunity to meet peo
ple with similar running goals.
Morganroth said that marathons
are not just for competitive run
ners, pointing out that many
marathons also offer walking op
tions.
"Marathons used to be re
stricted to disciplined athletes,
but they are becoming much
more common among average
people who just want to increase
their fitness level," Morganroth
said.
The Running Club, a group for
former competitive cross country
runners like Morganroth to meet
and new runners to get involved,
boasts a consistent number of
members who have participated
in marathons.
