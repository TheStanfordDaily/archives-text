Bill Clinton famously proclaimed
that the era of big government is over.
He was wrong: It just moved to the
suburbs.
State and local governments now
dwarf the national government. Fully
8b percent of civilian government em
ployees work for state and local enti
ties. That translates into 46 million
Americans who either work for local
governments or depend on someone
who does.
By long-standing tradition, Ameri
cans prefer their government to be
close to home, where ostensibly we can
control it. We've got half our wish:
Most government is local, but it is out
of control. Local governments are
multiplying like rabbits, at a rate of one
new entity added each day. They oper
ate the schools our children attend, de
termine the uses of our property and
tax us at a higher rate than the nation
al government.
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
The founding fathers, fearing all gov
ernment, created federalism not to ag
grandize state governments but to pro
tect individual liberty, presuming that
government closer to the people could
be trusted to guard those rights.
As tyrannical state leaders violate
liberty in the name of states' rights, we
discover that those who coined that

term had it wrong. States do not have
rights. People have rights. And the
purpose of federalism is to protect
those rights.
Grassroots tyranny usually afflicts
the proverbial little guy. In Mesa,
Ariz., Edward Salib owns a Winchell's
Donut franchise and posts the compa
ny's signs in his store windows.
But Mesa ordered him to cease the
advertising, citing an ordinance declar
ing that signs could only cover a certain
percentage of a window to protect the
city's aesthetics. But the standard
Winchella's advertising signs covered
more than the allowed space. Salib
asked if he could comply by leaving
one window empty of signs. Not
enough, the city responded.
Salib turned to the judicial system.
Federal courts often strike down local
laws when they violate freedom of
speech, except when the speech is
commercial. Although many people
highly value commercial speech, the
courts do not. Salib's challenge to
Mesa's ordinance failed in the trial
court and is now on appeal.
There are thousands of such stories.
The typical person lacks the resources
to take on local governments. The
odds are further stacked by the politi
cians' ability to use their citizens' tax
dollars against them. Even when peo
ple can stand up for themselves, they
often encounter court systems that in

dulge every presumption in favor of
local government power.
What can we (Jo to fight the
leviathan? First, we should pay atten
tion. The school board member or zon
ing commissioner often has more im
pact on the lives of ordinary people than
does the president of the United States.
We should get to know local officials
and expend as much effort on local pol
itics as we do on national politics.
We also need to rediscover federal
ism. We must remember that the ob
ject of American constitutional gov
ernment is the preservation of individ
ual liberty and that government at
every level is a constant threat to that
liberty.
In terms of fighting grassroots
tyranny, we should look to state consti
tutions. Many state constitutions pro
vide greater protections of liberty than
does their national counterpart.
Most important, we can fight back.
Washington, D.C., remains an object
of concern for those who value free
dom. But the more dangerous bully
may live closer than we think. Only by
standing up against it can we hope to
vindicate our own freedom and cause
government officials to act like the
public servants they are meant to be.
