## 1984 in 2004: Fear sets political agenda 
### TED RUDOW 
Banned B<x>ks Week has been ob
served since 1482, with the purpose of
reminding people of their freedom to
read whatever they want. This year's
event takes place through Oct. 2. with
the theme, "Elect to Read a Banned
Book
In Orwell's book "N84." the main
character worked for the "Ministry of
Truth." dedicated to eliminating
every vestige of the truth and replac
ing it with what the government said
was truth.
The leading protagonist, Winston
Smith, enters his Hat in the dingy
building ironically named Victory
Mansions and is immediately con
scious of the "Big Brother" poster
with the inscription "Big Brother is
Watching You."The "Party" has
taken over all aspects of life and is in

tent on eradicating individuality.
Winston is painfully aware of the
telescreen, which is both a receiver
and transmitter at the same time. It in
cessantly relays messages from the
Party and simultaneously allows the
dreaded "thought police" to tune into
the activities of any individual at any
given time.
"War is important for consuming
the products of human labour; if this
work were being used to increase the
standard of living, the control of the
party over the people would decrease.
War is the economic basis of a hierar
chical society."
Sounds just like some govern
ments today, and like many politi
cians. Fear is the devil's favorite
weapon, and it works as well with
governments as it does with individu
al people. Currently it's a day of fear
— of "terror." Nations and people

are terrified of terrorism, and many
are quite willing to give up all sorts of
freedoms — many of the very free
doms we are supposedly "fighting
for" — to avoid it.
The prophetic novel, about a gov
ernment that controls the masses by
spreading propaganda, cracking
down on subversive thought and al
tering history to suit its needs, was in
tended to be read as a warning about
the evils of totalitarianism.
In "1984," the state remained per
petually at war against a vague and
ever-changing enemy. The war took
place largely in the abstract, but it
served as a convenient vehicle to fuel
hatred, nurture fear and justify the
regime's autocratic practices
Sound familiar? Sometimes fic
tion is just as strange as truth.
