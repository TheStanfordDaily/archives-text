"Censored" culture article title was
overly editorial
While I enjoyed reading your
front-page story regarding Mr. Op
penheim's sculpture ("Univ. cen
sors sculpture." Sept. 28), I take
issue with the choice of headlines
used. Headline writing is clearly a
difficult art form.
However, saying that Stanford
"censored" the sculpture is exces
sively judgmental. The actual arti
cle strikes a relatively fair balance

between perspectives, while the
title implies a far greater amount of
editorializing.
"Censors" is clearly a loaded
word that is not supported by the
contents of the article. This style of
biased headline writing is more ap
propriate for the New York Post
than The Stanford Daily.
1 hope that The Daily continues
to uphold the high journalistic
standards that it has been known
for in the past.

Polygamy thriving in Utah
I am writing in response to Cindy
Lowe ("Mormons have not prac
ticed polygamy for over a century,"
Sept. 28). who wrote, "It seems to
me the joke ended up being on the
heads of your own Band and Band
leaders, because the Mormons don't
practice polygamy. Yes, they did
back in the nineteenth century fora
few vears, but that decision was re

called."
This statement is fallacious, and
Ms. Lowe's letter portrays her
anecdotal evidence as the truth.
I felt compelled to write be
cause continued ignorance about
polygamy continues the abuse that
goes on in the state of Utah. I grew
up in Salt Lake City, UT, and have
met polygamists.
Besides my experiences with
polygamy, the issue has recently
been in the national news. Tom
Green, a self-admitted Mormon

polygamist, was recently arrested for
impregnating a thirteen-year-old girl
who later became his wife. While it is
true that mainstream Mormonism
does not overtly condone polygamy,
it is erroneous to say that there is no
Mormon polygamy.
According to Tapestry Against
Polygamy, a non-profit organiza
tion located in Salt Lake City that
advocates against polygamy, there
are roughly 100,000 polygamists in
the state of Utah. The people in
cluded in this number consider

themselves fundamentalist mem
bers of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints.
The current state of polygamy is
one rife with subjection of women
and child abuse. Tapestry has been
set up as a support group for
women who have escaped
polygamy. This is necessary be
cause women who escape
polygamy fear for their lives.
