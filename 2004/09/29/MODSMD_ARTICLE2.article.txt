# Two Stanford faculty win Mac Arthur 'genius' awards
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As recipients of the lucrative
Mac Arthur Fellowships, Daphne
Roller and Julie Theriot will soon
have $500,000 dollars, "no-strings
attached," with which to advance
their work. The Fellowship, also
known as the "genius award," is
unique in the way it allows its re
cipients a great deal of latitude in
pursuing their passions.
Some of the qualities that the
John D. and Catherine T.
Mac Arthur Foundation looked
for in selecting Roller, Theriot,
and 21 other winners from across
the U.S. were "originality, cre
ativity, and the potential to do
more in the future."
Roller is an associate profes
sor of computer science whose
work focuses on complex compu
tational modeling. She received
her bachelor's and master's de
grees from the Hebrew Universi
ty of Jerusalem and her doctorate
from Stanford.
Theriot, an assistant professor

of biochemistry and of microbiol
ogy and immunology at the
School of Medicine, has done ex
tensive research on, among other
things, bacterial infections. She
studied physics and biology at
MIT and went on to study cell bi
ology at UC-San Francisco.
Roller and Theriot bring the
total number of Stanford
Mac Arthur winners to 22.
"I'm glad I didn't get it earli
er," Theriot said, according to a
release from the Stanford News
Service.
"It's only recently that I've be
come comfortable with myself. I
know who I am and what I want
to do in a global sense. It's a great
opportunity to take some of the
ideas I've wanted to do in the
long-term and do them in a short
term way."
One difficulty for the two re
cipients will be to find a produc
tive way to use so much money.
"It's really a major decision,
and they give you some time to
think about it," Roller told the
Stanford News Service.
