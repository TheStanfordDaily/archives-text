# Holt's Harangue
## Rejected dorm themes that really aren't so bad 
### 
Dorm themes. Everyone
has them, but who comes
up with them? Some of
you may think they are

randomly gener
ated: Take the
name of the
dorm and ran
domly take a
pop-culture ref
erence, hoping
that the two
mesh well to
gether.
This was sure
ly the case in such

dorm themes as 19%'s Brannerecto
my or 2001's Okadawood Squares.
But most of the time, the staff actu
ally spends a great deal of time cre
ating the theme.
, I should know, because 1 was on
summer staff this year. Seeing some of
the better dorm themes, like The
Royal Tenenßobs, you think to your
self, "Wow, there must have been
some genius RA behind that one."
You could not be further from
the truth. The genius RA thing?
Never happens. We may be some of
the brightest minds in the country,
but lock us in a room fora few hours
and tell us to come up with a dorm
theme and you will find our minds
turn to silly putty. A resident staff
meeting is always complete anarchy.
Howler monkeys equipped with
bullhorns and chainsaws are more
organized, coherent and productive
than the residential staff meeting
where the dorm theme is decided. It
is decided by committee — and by
the end of the meeting any good idea
has been completely watered down
and over-salted so that it simply has
no taste, and that's a perfectly good
souffle you have to throw out.
I know the horrors of "democra
cy" and "one person, one vote" after
working with this bunch of
Philistines this summer. I had some
amazing dorm theme ideas — and
they were all shot down. 1 worked in
Branner, and so we were trying to
come up with some witty play on
words.
For instance, I was thinking since
it was Branner, the only logical
theme could be "Twisted Sister."
My entire staff didn't get it. 1 told
them that we could do a tribute to an
obscure hair metal band. They said
that it had nothing to do with the
theme. But I was insistent: The dec

orations would include posters, py
rotechnics and cocaine.
The rest of the staff claimed that
Twisted Sister's album covers, which
usually feature graphic portrayals of
death and gore, might frighten the
12-year-olds who would be living
there. I told them that to deny them
Twisted Sister was a fate worse than
death and that the metal gods would
not stand for this.
To this day, I think the real rea
son my idea was shot down was be
cause they were all Whitesnake fans.
But 1 didn't give up. I thought to
myself, "There has to be some kind
of joke we can make about this being
a high school program." Thus,
"Branneßejected from Stanford."
They said no. I didn't even get to
explain to them that the decorations
could all be pamphlets for schools
that were easier to get into. They
didn't hear me out. Damn howler
monkeys.
My philosophy is that you need a
non sequitur every so often. For in
stance, I like Edgar AllenPoco, even
though it is a bit of a stretch pronun
ciation wise. On the other hand, I re
ally look forward to seeing illustra
tions from"A Tell-tale Heart" as
decorations. In comparison, I'm not
as big a fan of "Throw PaloMa From
the Train."
Aside from the fact that everyone
makes references to terrible Danny
Devito movies (like last year's
"Mars Attacks!" and "Okada Peo
ple's Money"), it also lacks good
decoration ideas. Trains?
Snoozeville.
So here are some dorm themes I
would love to see. If any of them
have actually been dorm themes,
please inform me and it will make
my day.
A committee of howler monkeys
came up with the following, so enjoy:
"Ro-bleeding from the Head."
"Cute and Fluffy Xanimals." "Ack!
I'm allergic to Mars-zipans." "Slav
ingly Kissing You." "Ayn Du-
Rand." "SoTo-tally A Lush." "Slav-
Dom-inatrix." And last but not least,
"MirrieLeave Now Or I'm Calling
the Cops."

Chris thanks all resident staffers for
their hard work setting up for this
year. He also commends them for
never listening to his terrible theme
ideas. Send your complaints to
cholt@stanford.edu.

Dorm themes. Everyone
has them, but who comes
up with them? Some of
you may think they are

randomly gener
ated: Take the
name of the
dorm and ran
domly take a
pop-culture ref
erence, hoping
that the two
mesh well to
gether.
This was sure
ly the case in such

dorm themes as 19%'s Brannerecto
my or 2001's Okadawood Squares.
But most of the time, the staff actu
ally spends a great deal of time cre
ating the theme.
, I should know, because 1 was on
summer staff this year. Seeing some of
the better dorm themes, like The
Royal Tenenßobs, you think to your
self, "Wow, there must have been
some genius RA behind that one."
You could not be further from
the truth. The genius RA thing?
Never happens. We may be some of
the brightest minds in the country,
but lock us in a room fora few hours
and tell us to come up with a dorm
theme and you will find our minds
turn to silly putty. A resident staff
meeting is always complete anarchy.
Howler monkeys equipped with
bullhorns and chainsaws are more
organized, coherent and productive
than the residential staff meeting
where the dorm theme is decided. It
is decided by committee — and by
the end of the meeting any good idea
has been completely watered down
and over-salted so that it simply has
no taste, and that's a perfectly good
souffle you have to throw out.
I know the horrors of "democra
cy" and "one person, one vote" after
working with this bunch of
Philistines this summer. I had some
amazing dorm theme ideas — and
they were all shot down. 1 worked in
Branner, and so we were trying to
come up with some witty play on
words.
For instance, I was thinking since
it was Branner, the only logical
theme could be "Twisted Sister."
My entire staff didn't get it. 1 told
them that we could do a tribute to an
obscure hair metal band. They said
that it had nothing to do with the
theme. But I was insistent: The dec

orations would include posters, py
rotechnics and cocaine.
The rest of the staff claimed that
Twisted Sister's album covers, which
usually feature graphic portrayals of
death and gore, might frighten the
12-year-olds who would be living
there. I told them that to deny them
Twisted Sister was a fate worse than
death and that the metal gods would
not stand for this.
To this day, I think the real rea
son my idea was shot down was be
cause they were all Whitesnake fans.
But 1 didn't give up. I thought to
myself, "There has to be some kind
of joke we can make about this being
a high school program." Thus,
"Branneßejected from Stanford."
They said no. I didn't even get to
explain to them that the decorations
could all be pamphlets for schools
that were easier to get into. They
didn't hear me out. Damn howler
monkeys.
My philosophy is that you need a
non sequitur every so often. For in
stance, I like Edgar AllenPoco, even
though it is a bit of a stretch pronun
ciation wise. On the other hand, I re
ally look forward to seeing illustra
tions from"A Tell-tale Heart" as
decorations. In comparison, I'm not
as big a fan of "Throw PaloMa From
the Train."
Aside from the fact that everyone
makes references to terrible Danny
Devito movies (like last year's
"Mars Attacks!" and "Okada Peo
ple's Money"), it also lacks good
decoration ideas. Trains?
Snoozeville.
So here are some dorm themes I
would love to see. If any of them
have actually been dorm themes,
please inform me and it will make
my day.
