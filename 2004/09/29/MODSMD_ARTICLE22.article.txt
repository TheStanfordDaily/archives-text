# College student tries to return uneaten food for partial refund
## 
### POLLY BROWN 
Checking his dignity at the cash register,
college student Andy Pernsteiner recently
presented a local diner cashier with a plate of
picked-over food, demanding money for the

vittles he didn't ingest. The
cashier —who wishes to remain
anonymous—was flabbergasted
by the whole incident. "It was
both sick and sad at the same
time," she said. Pernsteiner had
a different take: "1 didn't eat the

bone, so why should I pay for it?" Pete
Woychick—a childhood friend of Pernsteiner s —
said it was monthly fees tacked on to his friend's
checking account that drove him to the shameless
act. "Andy has been pounded for months by

"/ didn 7 eat the
bone, so why should
I pay for it? "

fees on his checking account. He's pathetic. I
never really liked him when we were kids either."
Woychick—who says he personally was
financially saved by Washington Mutual's Free

Checking Deluxe —thought his
childhood friend needed to get
his act together and visit a
Washington Mutual Financial
Center or go to wamu.com. Then
he, too, could sign up for Free
Checking—an account with

optional Deluxe services like free online bill
pay. "Until Andy decides to get Free Checking,"
said Woychick, "I'm never eating out with him
again. I'm pretty sure I won't return his phone
calls either. I might even change my name."
