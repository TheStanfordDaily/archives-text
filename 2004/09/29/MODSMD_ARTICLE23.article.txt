## Sport, not a sport: consider Dan the expert 
### 
All right, I'll be honest. This column has al
ways been most appropriately described
as a "soapbox." Providing — and, to a
lesser extent, settling — arguments is my job, so
here comes the big one.
Outlining what falls under the definition of
the word "sport" always results in arguments
about the relative merits of things like golf and
bowling. People are always quick to make some
poorly thought-out assertion about the athleti
cism that dance, rock climbing or even band re
quires. as if carting around a tuba in between A V
Club meetings somehow makes you a ninth
grade Clinton Portis.
I 'm sick of having this discussion; hence, I plan to
settle it in the only way I know how — by unilater
ally producing an articulation of the word "sport"
so perfect that only an idiot would dispute it.
First of all, before I get a barrage of e-mails
berating me about the physical stresses involved
in synchronized swimming and cheerleading:
Whether an activity is a sport is independent of
the level of physical difficulty involved.
Cheerleading is not a non-sport because it's

typically for neurotic blondes
with disorders of both the eat
ing and attention deficit variety
(although it is); it's a nonsport
because there's no on-the-fly
competition.
Athleticism, preparation,
and fitness, while commend
able, do not a sport make. Say
ing that physical difficulty de
fines sport means that I could

make climbing the stairs while drunk a sport,
since that requires a far more taxing effort than
table tennis — which is, of course, a sport.
In order to be a sport, an activity must fulfill
only two major criteria. First, it must be, on some
level, physically active. Second, and more im
portantly, it must be the immediate, reactive
physical implementation of a strategy designed
to beat an opponent.
This eliminates a lot of the pastimes that we
typically refer to as sports. Golf, for one, is a
turn-based competition where your play is inde
pendent of your opponent's. While your strategy
might be tailored to your opponent's score —
perhaps taking necessary risks to close a deficit,
or playing conservatively with a large lead —
there is no active, direct response to an oppo
nent's action that must be translated into a phys
ical performance. This makes it a game, on equal
footing with bowling, billiards, archery, etc.
This is also why the sports that are highest on
the food chain are those that involve two com
petitors acting directly against one another si
multaneously. Football, boxing, basketball and
Ultimate Frisbee all fall into this category:
hence, they are all sports.
The caveat of direct competition against a
specific opponent aims to eliminate the possibil
ity of judges determining the outcome of the
contest. While arbiters in most sports exist sole
ly to make objective judgments (who arrived at
the bag first; where was the ball when the knee
was down), the authorities in activities like fig
ure skating and gymnastics serve to quantify a
performance based largely on aesthetics, rather
than concrete information.
Gymnastics is not a sport because, although
the competitor may strive to conform to some
objective standard of perfection, that individu
al's success in doing so is measured in a subjec
tive sense. The athlete is attempting to reach a
personal standard of perfection, rather than re
acting to an opponent's performance. A quick
rule to live by dictates that if "style points" are
ever awarded, under any circumstances, the ac
tivity in question is a non-sport.
A qualifier on the physically active rule is that
the action must be done on the part of a human
being. Activities within the "race" category
(track, swimming, downhill skiing) are sports,
because they involve an individual battling the
clock as a representation of another racer who
could, theoretically, be competing at the same

time, on the same playing field. However, once a
car, horse, kangaroo or lawnmower is added, it ceas
es to he a sport.
Finally, what angers me more than anything is
the idea that some activities can become sports sim
ply by popular consent (poker), or that things like
ballet are somehow less worthy or difficult due to
their exclusion from the Sports Club.
Furthermore, anyone who uses the argument,
"But it's in the Olympics!" should be taken behind
the woodshed and shot. The all-inclusive Olympics
are as relevant an authority on sport as Sean Penn is
on foreign policy.
All of this provides a fairly broad spectrum of
behavior that could be classified as sport. However,
the physical stress involved is still important. Let's

Poker doesn't
even come close

not go overboard and say that poker players are
somehow athletes because the game requires
"stamina." I know people hooked to dialysis ma
chines that are more athletic than most professional
card players.
So, to clarify: Unless you are making an immedi
ate, athletic response to your opponent's physical
action — not a sport. Out: golf, sailing, synchro
nized swimming, billiards, chess, poker, weightlift
ing, cheerleading, gymnastics.
Your outrage is appreciated.
