## Card look to get back at Broncos 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 16 Stanford women's
soccer team (7-2-0) will have re
venge on its mind when it squares
off against local rival No. 15 Santa
Clara (6-2-1) tomorrow night.
The Cardinal lost their regular
season match-up 2-0 against the
Broncos last year in the first round of
the Nike Invitational. The squad was
then dealt an even more devastating
blow when the Broncos spoiled the
Cardinal's run at an national title by
handing them a 1-0 first-round loss in
the NCAA Tournament.
"Santa Clara is always a huge
game for us," said junior defender
Hayley Hunt. "They're a great
team. I think our team is looking for

a little revenge from last year after
they knocked us out of the NCAA
tournament."
The Cardinal's most recent vic
tory over the Broncos came in 2002,
when they downed Santa Clara 3-0
at Buck Shaw Stadium.
It is the Broncos, however, who
have dominated the series, beating
Stanford four times in the regular
season since 1999.
The Broncos come into the
match as the slight favorite over
Stanford, since their national rank
is just above that of the Cardinal.
As is often the case, however, the
teams' national rankings fail to tell
the whole story.
The Cardinal, who fell out of the
national Top 25 after losing two
straight to Notre Dame and South

em Methodist, have slowly climbed
back all the way to No. 16 during
the past two weeks.
Santa Clara, on the other hand,
started out the season ranked as
high as No. 2 in some polls but has
fallen considerably as of hite.
The Cardinal, thanks to shutout
victories over Denver and Mar
quette this past weekend, are cur
rently enjoying a season-best, six
game win streak. During this span,
the Cardinal have outscored their
opponents 13-0 while allowing just
38 shots on goal.
Perhaps even more telling than
the team's 13 goals is the fact that
those goals have been scored by
eight different Cardinal players. Se
nior forward Marcie Ward has ac


Junior Lindsey Hunt and the Cardinal have already played
higher-ranked teams, such as Yale, ealier this season. The ex
perience should come in handy against No. 15 Santa Clara.
counted for four of the team's last thir
teen goals while newcomer Lizzy
George has contributed three.
Other than that, however, no other
woman has scored more than one goal
during the team's win streak, showing
that the Cardinal should have plenty
of options on offense come Thursday
night.
Ward, who missed all of last year
with an iniury, has sparked the Cardi
nal's offensive attack in a big way this
season. In just nine games this season.
Ward has found the net six times. Her
most recent two goals have been
game-winners.
Ward's ability to find the net
should help the Cardinal against a
gritty Bronco defense that allowed
just nine goals in its lirst nine games.
The Cardinal will again have to face
senior defenders Jessica Ballweg and

line for women

Lana Bowen and sophomore goal
keeper Julie Ryder, all of whom were
instrumental in keeping Stanford
scoreless through both Stanford /
Santa Clara matchups last season.
On the other side, the Cardinal de
fense was nearly perfect over the
weekend, holding both of its oppo
nents to just one goal each.
Santa Clara's offense, however, is
much more explosive than that of
Denver or Marquette and will no
doubt give the Cardinal one of their
biggest challenges of the season thus
far. â™¦
Stanford will look to contain the
West Coast Conference's 2003 Player
of the Year, Leslie Osborne, and up
and-coming sophomore Tina Estrada.
Together, Osborne and Estrada have
combined for nine of the team's 18
goals scored this season.

"Santa Clara is a top ranked team,"
said head coach Paul Ratcliffe. "It's
going to be a battle. I think we are
going into the game very confident
and that should help our chances."
Fortunately the Cardinal are no
strangers to playing higher ranked
teams, having played both Notre
Dame and Yale earlier in the season.
With that experience and the mo
mentum of a six-game winning streak,
the Cardinal looks poised to pull off an
upset on the highly touted Broncos.
Payback will be the only thing on
the team's mind come Thursday.
"I think as a team, we all look for
ward to playing Santa Clara," said ju
nior defender Jenny Farenbaugh.
"They are one of our biggest rivals and
we have something to prove."
Kick-off is at 7 p.m on Thursday
night at Buck Shaw Stadium.
