## Card look to get back at Broncos 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 16 Stanford women's
soccer team (7-2-0) will have re
venge on its mind when it squares
off against local rival No. 15 Santa
Clara (6-2-1) tomorrow night.
The Cardinal lost their regular
season match-up 2-0 against the
Broncos last year in the first round of
the Nike Invitational. The squad was
then dealt an even more devastating
blow when the Broncos spoiled the
Cardinal's run at an national title by
handing them a 1-0 first-round loss in
the NCAA Tournament.
"Santa Clara is always a huge
game for us," said junior defender
Hayley Hunt. "They're a great
team. I think our team is looking for

a little revenge from last year after
they knocked us out of the NCAA
tournament."
The Cardinal's most recent vic
tory over the Broncos came in 2002,
when they downed Santa Clara 3-0
at Buck Shaw Stadium.
It is the Broncos, however, who
have dominated the series, beating
Stanford four times in the regular
season since 1999.
The Broncos come into the
match as the slight favorite over
Stanford, since their national rank
is just above that of the Cardinal.
As is often the case, however, the
teams' national rankings fail to tell
the whole story.
The Cardinal, who fell out of the
national Top 25 after losing two
straight to Notre Dame and South

em Methodist, have slowly climbed
back all the way to No. 16 during
the past two weeks.
Santa Clara, on the other hand,
started out the season ranked as
high as No. 2 in some polls but has
fallen considerably as of hite.
The Cardinal, thanks to shutout
victories over Denver and Mar
quette this past weekend, are cur
rently enjoying a season-best, six
game win streak. During this span,
the Cardinal have outscored their
opponents 13-0 while allowing just
38 shots on goal.
Perhaps even more telling than
the team's 13 goals is the fact that
those goals have been scored by
eight different Cardinal players. Se
nior forward Marcie Ward has ac


Junior Lindsey Hunt and the Cardinal have already played
higher-ranked teams, such as Yale, ealier this season. The ex
perience should come in handy against No. 15 Santa Clara.
