### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The tens of thousands of Cardinal faithful who
packed Stanford Stadium for Saturday's loss to top
ranked Southern California (4-0.1-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) may not have gotten to see the upset of the year,
but at the least they witnessed the Pac-10's most exciting
game of the weekend, as three of the other four Pac-10
contests ended in double-digit margins of victory for the
home teams.
Washington State 20, Arizona 19
If there was a rival to the Stanford-USC game in terms
of interest and intensity, it was the Cougars' last-minute
win over the resurgent Wildcats.
Washington State scored twice in the fourth quarter.

only eclipsing Arizona on Josh Swogger's 15-yard touch
down pass to Jason Hill with 53 seconds remaining.
The host Wildcats (1-3, 0-2 Pac-10) were picked by
the media to finish last in the Pac-10, and indeed they
haven't produced many victories, but they held No. 20
Wisconsin to nine points and took a strong Cougar team
(3-1,1-0) down to the wire in Tucson.
Swogger completed 18-of-37 passes for 282 yards,
throwing two touchdowns to Hill. His Arizona counter
part, Kris Heavner, was 15-of-31 for 183 yards and two
scores, both to speedy sophomore Syndric Steptoe, who
totaled 105 yards on six catches. Neither quarterback was
intercepted.
Sean Jones recovered two fumbles and forced anoth
er in helping the Wildcats build a 13-7 third-quarter lead.
Both defenses were strong, as the schools combined to
punt 16 times.

Notre Dame 38, Washington 3
Stanford's opponents this Saturday, the Huskies (0-3,
0-1), fell hard at the hands of the Cardinal's Oct. 9 foes,
the Fighting Irish (3-1).
Brady Quinn threw four first-half touchdown passes
— two apiece to Anthony Fasano and Matt Shelton —
and finished with 266 yards passing for host Notre Dame.
Darius Walker added 88 yards rushing and a fourth
quarter touchdown.
The Huskies managed only a second-quarter field
goal and are off to their worst start since 1%9. They
haven't suffered a losing season since 1976, although
they needed an improbable Apple Cup victory to finish
6-6 last year.

the end zone for the first time since 1992. 6-foot-1 sopho

formance, catching five balls for 72 yards.
No. 22 Arizona Slate 27, (>regon State 14
The Beavers scored first and last Saturday in Tempe,
but the Sun Devils squeezed three touchdowns and two
field goals in between to remain unbeaten.
Arizona State (4-0,1-0), amazingly, did it all despite 16-
of-40 passing from Andrew Walter, who totaled just 124
yards. The Devils got plenty of other contributions,
though, as Hakim Hill and Randy Hill carried a combined
33 times for 103 yards, Jamar Williams intercepted two
passes and Jordan Hill recovered two fumbles.
Oregon State (1 -3,0-1) put some pretty numbers on the
stat sheet, if not the scoreboard. Derek Anderson passed
for 384 yards and former walk-on Mike Hass caught 14
passes for 172 yards and a touchdown to lead the Beavers.
However, the team managed just 35 yards rushing on 22 at
tempts.
Jesse Ainsworth's 33-yard field goal put the Sun Devils
up 10-7 in the second quarter, and his 45-yarder gave them
a 27-7 lead in the fourth.
Oregon 48, Idaho 10
Coming off tough non-conference losses to Indiana and
No. 2 Oklahoma, the Ducks got just what they needed
from the visiting Vandals (0-4), winning their first game of
the year.
Oregon (1-2, 0-0) took a 34-3 lead early in the second
quarter and never looked back. Kellen Clemens threw
three touchdowns and ran for another, completing 11-of
-19 passes for 157 yards. Terrence Whitehead rushed 18
times for 116 yards and a score to lead the Ducks, who had
10 players carry the ball, nine players catch a pass and three
kickers convert extra points.
Michael 1 larrington, brother of former Ducks star Joey
Harrington, completed 20-of-32 passes for Idaho but was
intercepted twice.
