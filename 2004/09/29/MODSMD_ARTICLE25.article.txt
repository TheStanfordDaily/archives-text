The tens of thousands of Cardinal faithful who
packed Stanford Stadium for Saturday's loss to top
ranked Southern California (4-0.1-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) may not have gotten to see the upset of the year,
but at the least they witnessed the Pac-10's most exciting
game of the weekend, as three of the other four Pac-10
contests ended in double-digit margins of victory for the
home teams.
Washington State 20, Arizona 19
If there was a rival to the Stanford-USC game in terms
of interest and intensity, it was the Cougars' last-minute
win over the resurgent Wildcats.
Washington State scored twice in the fourth quarter.

down pass to Jason Hill with 53 seconds remaining.
The host Wildcats (1-3, 0-2 Pac-10) were picked by
the media to finish last in the Pac-10, and indeed they
haven't produced many victories, but they held No. 20

(3-1,1-0) down to the wire in Tucson.
Swogger completed 18-of-37 passes for 282 yards,
throwing two touchdowns to Hill. His Arizona counter
part, Kris Heavner, was 15-of-31 for 183 yards and two
scores, both to speedy sophomore Syndric Steptoe, who
totaled 105 yards on six catches. Neither quarterback was

Sean Jones recovered two fumbles and forced anoth

Both defenses were strong, as the schools combined to
punt 16 times.

Stanford's opponents this Saturday, the Huskies (0-3,
0-1), fell hard at the hands of the Cardinal's Oct. 9 foes,
the Fighting Irish (3-1).
Brady Quinn threw four first-half touchdown passes
— two apiece to Anthony Fasano and Matt Shelton —
and finished with 266 yards passing for host Notre Dame.
Darius Walker added 88 yards rushing and a fourth
quarter touchdown.
The Huskies managed only a second-quarter field
goal and are off to their worst start since 1%9. They
haven't suffered a losing season since 1976, although
they needed an improbable Apple Cup victory to finish
6-6 last year.
