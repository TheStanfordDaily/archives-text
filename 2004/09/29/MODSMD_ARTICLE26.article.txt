##

Sometimes, lightning does strike twice.
Just ask members of the No. 11 Stanford
Cardinal women's volleyball team, who lost
fora second time this season to the under
dog St. Mary's Gaels at McKeon Pavilion in
Moraga, Calif., 3-1, Tuesday night.
Stanford played a close match, but came
up short in the end. The No. 24 Gaels im
proved to 11-1 overall with conference play
to come, and the Cardinal dropped to 9-3,2-
0 Pacific-10 Conference.
The Gaels frustrated the Cardinal all
night with solid defense, excellent digging,
and a block that often saw two or three bod
ies thrown at the outside hitters.
Stanford started game one slowly, hav
ing problems putting down its kills against
good digging by St. Mary's. The Gaels put
up points early and held onto their lead.
After a Jenn Hucke service error, the

Gaels had game point at 29-23. Stanford
held St. Mary's off fora point, but a kill by
middle blocker Stacey O'Connor sealed
the game for the Gaels, 30-24.
Head coach John Dunning talked with
the team about its serving before game two,
asking the Cardinal to serve harder and
away from the Gaels.
Game one saw a career moment for
Ogonna Nnamani. With six kills, Nnamani
passed Sara Silvernail of Washington State
for seventh on the all-time Pac-10 career
kills list with 1,849. It would not be her last
milestone of the night. In game three, by tal
lying her 17th kill of the evening, the senior
outside hitter passed Arizona's Barb Bell for
sixth on the same list.
The game also saw the end of the Cardi
nal's streak of 15 straight victories. The last
game the Cardinal lost was Sep. 17 against
Western Kentucky.
St. Mary's came out strong in game two.
Stanford pulled to within one at 17-16. but

then saw the Gaels put together three points
to extend their lead. Three straight kills by
Ogonna Nnamani made the score 20-19. but
Lindsay Bogason had two kills and a service
ace to give the Gaels the lead at 23-19. Stan
ford then scored six of the next seven points
to win the second game, on the strength of
devastating kills by Hucke — who had eight
kills to lead the Cardinal comeback — and
stone cold blocking by Suiter.
The teams played closely to open game
three. Neither team led by more than two
until a Hucke ace gave Stanford the lead 9-6.
The Gaels fought back to tie the game at 14-
14 and take the lead on a passing error by
Richards. Stanford had game point. 29-28,
but the Gaels fought back and forced Stan
ford into extra points. Seven game points
later, the Gaels were able to put the Cardinal
away 36-34.
St. Mary's took the lead early in game
four, scoring the first three points and only
relinquishing the ball on a service error.

Stanford would be outplayed over the next
stretch of the game as the Gaels did a great
job digging and persisting against the Stan
ford block. The Gaels overcame a slight
Stanford comeback and took down the
Cardinal. 30-27 and 3-1.
Throughout the match, the Gaels played
solid defense, doing an exceptional job of
digging the Cardinal hitters and frustrating
the Stanford attack. The quick movement in
the front line kept Stanford blocked and
hard pressed to find open court.
Stanford next sees action against No. 13
California on Friday night at Burnham
Pavilion at 7 p.m. Both the Cardinal and the
Bears will be coming off losses, as Cal
dropped a three-game match to the Santa
Clara Broncos last night.
Friday's game is the White-Out Game,
where the first 1 .(XX) fans will receive a free
white t-shirt as the Cardinal attempt to
white-out the stands and take down the
Bears.

to win the second game, on the strength of
devastating kills by Hucke — who had eight
kills to lead the Cardinal comeback — and
stone cold blocking by Suiter.
The teams played closely to open game
three. Neither team led by more than two
until a Hucke ace gave Stanford the lead 9-6.
The Gaels fought back to tie the game at 14-
14 and take the lead on a passing error by
Richards. Stanford had game point. 29-28,
but the Gaels fought back and forced Stan
ford into extra points. Seven game points
later, the Gaels were able to put the Cardinal
away 36-34.
St. Mary's took the lead early in game
four, scoring the first three points and only
relinquishing the ball on a service error.

Stanford would be outplayed over the next
stretch of the game as the Gaels did a great
job digging and persisting against the Stan
ford block. The Gaels overcame a slight
Stanford comeback and took down the
Cardinal. 30-27 and 3-1.
Throughout the match, the Gaels played
solid defense, doing an exceptional job of
digging the Cardinal hitters and frustrating
the Stanford attack. The quick movement in
the front line kept Stanford blocked and
hard pressed to find open court.
Stanford next sees action against No. 13
California on Friday night at Burnham
Pavilion at 7 p.m. Both the Cardinal and the
Bears will be coming off losses, as Cal
dropped a three-game match to the Santa
Clara Broncos last night.
Friday's game is the White-Out Game,
where the first 1 .(XX) fans will receive a free
white t-shirt as the Cardinal attempt to
white-out the stands and take down the
Bears.
