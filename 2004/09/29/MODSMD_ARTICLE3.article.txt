# Report clears way for trail
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The University may soon begin
to build one of two proposed trails
on the eastern border of campus,
though several local environment
groups contend that the pathway
will not serve the community.
These trails have been a focal
point in the debate between Stan
ford and community groups over
the future of campus development.
A recently released environmen
tal impact report concluded that two
of the three proposed trails will not

have a significant impact on their
surroundings. The report, which
was funded by Stanford and drafted
by the group Environmental Sci
ence Associates for Santa Clara
County, said that the third trail
could damage important habitats,
including that of the endangered
California red-legged frog.
"We're pleased that the environ
mental work has concluded, and
that two environmentally satisfacto
ry working options have been
found," said Larry Horton, the Uni
versity's associate vice president of
government and community rela

tions, who added that he did not un
derstand why the issue has become
"so politicized."
The proposed trails have drawn
heavy criticism from local environ
mental groups.
"It's pretty much a useless trail,"
said Brian Schmidt, the Committee
for Green Foothills' legislative ana
lyst for Santa Clara County. He said
that the report was too limited in its
scope and failed to investigate
which trail will have the most posi
tive impact on the community.
"They only looked at all poten
tial harm from the trail and at none
of the benefits. The outcome of that
is that you're going to do the least
amount possible, which is the Uni
versity's preferred option."
Stanford is required by its De
cember 2000 General Use Permit
with Santa Clara County to offset
the construction of new academic
and housing facilities — estimated
to add five million square feet of de
veloped land — by building two
recreational trails through campus.
The University has agreed to add
trails that run along the edge of its
land; critics argue that the commu
nity would be better served by paths
cutting through the heart of campus.
"Five million square feet trans
lates into a lot of people," Schmidt
said. "They're going to be out using
parks and other recreational re
source areas, which are already
crowded. The deal was that Stan
ford agreed and promised to give
these people somewhere else to go."

Schmidt also noted that the Uni
versity declined to fund the county's
investigation into the impacts of al
ternate trails.
This investigation would have
cost over $170,000.
Horton countered that the Uni
versity never agreed to build trails
through its interior.
"If you sign a contract, you cannot
change its terms after the fact," he
said. "Since the outset, we've always
maintained that we're not going to
build trails on the interior. We've
never agreed to build those trails be
cause it would cause significant limi
tations on what Stanford could do
with this land in the future."
The trails examined in the envi
ronmental report run through the
eastern side of campus; plans fora
western trail, which will likely be
built along Alpine Road, still need
to be investigated.
Both paths are expected to be
paved and to serve walkers, runners
and bicyclists.
Schmidt described the Universi
ty's attitude as a "property rights
orientation" that failed to take into
account the needs of the entire com
munity.
Horton, on the other hand, char
acterized the situation as a "Stan
ford issue," adding that "the Univer
sity has a superb record of land use."
On Nov. 4, Santa Clara's plan
ning commission will hold a hearing
on the report, which is then expected
to go before the Board of Supervi
sors for the final selection .of a trail.

The University must build trails like this one through campus land to offset
new construction projects.
