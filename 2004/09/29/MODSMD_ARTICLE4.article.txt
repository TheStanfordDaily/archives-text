# WISDOM OF THE STACKS
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There are two types of people at Stanford:
those who respect University property and
those who willfully deface it.
The handiwork of the latter can he found at
Green Library, where gralfiti-covered desk
tops and carrels distract bored students, luring
them to make their mark.
After conducting an entirely non-scientific
hieroglyphic survey, the following inscriptions
seemed to best represent the student body:
The almost painfully earnest girl
"To this Desk,
Thank you for 4 years of loyalty. May you
help future generations of students the way
you helped me. Thank you and keep it real!
— EMSFATM, Class of 2003"
Two Californians and a New Yorker
"How does one try to prove the existence or
non-existence of God w/o human restrictions
and prejudices?"
— "One cannot 'prove' nor disprove God's ex
istence. But 1 would suggest that if you have to
look around for something, then it's lost from
you. The question then becomes should you
believe or should you not. and if you have no

motivating reason to believe, then you can quit
believing without theory to be proven to you
one way or another."
— "You guys have obviously been to one
too many C.I.V. lectures."
The recently fired outreach
director of Stanford Bridge
"Sometimes I wonder how much the world

would change if I were not in it."
— "NOT MUCH"
People who enjoy being obvious
"I'm bored!"
"Finals suck"
"I love my mom"


LINDSAY COIEMAN/The Stanford Daily
The words and phrases scrawled on desks and carrels in Green Library offer a glimpse into the
complex psyches of Stanford students.
The tough but tender frat guy
who never met a cliche he
didn't like
"HELP SAVE ME!"
— "Shit, I can't even save my
self. So how can I save you?
Sink or swim dude."
Four guys in the front row of
Econ 50 who hitch at each
other while diligently taking
notes on graph paper
"Why do you worship the
work ethic?"
— "Why do you?"
— "$ - Have you jot an alter
native?"

Etched in the cubicles of Green, anguish of students

— "Marx did."
— "No he didn't his economic
analysis was fundamentally
flawed, as he admitted."
A roommate who only knows
one lyric of the song, but com
pensates by repeating it over
and over again
"You better shape up 'cause I
need a man ... And my heart
is set on you ..
The kid in your IHUM
section who likes big words
"The key to being a good aca
demic is finding new and cre

ative generalizations/ charac
terizations about various po
litical, social or economic
forces. Then you can write
long books about it and be
CITED BY OTHERS, Com
ments?"
— "What?"
Frustration, the hard line,
then acceptance
"I hate chem!"
—_"Chem hates you."
— "I know."
The whole goddamn school
"I need to get laid."
