# WISDOM OF THE STACKS

### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There are two types of people at Stanford:
those who respect University property and
those who willfully deface it.
The handiwork of the latter can he found at
Green Library, where gralfiti-covered desk
tops and carrels distract bored students, luring
them to make their mark.
After conducting an entirely non-scientific
hieroglyphic survey, the following inscriptions
seemed to best represent the student body:
The almost painfully earnest girl
"To this Desk,
Thank you for 4 years of loyalty. May you
help future generations of students the way
you helped me. Thank you and keep it real!
— EMSFATM, Class of 2003"
Two Californians and a New Yorker
"How does one try to prove the existence or
non-existence of God w/o human restrictions
and prejudices?"
— "One cannot 'prove' nor disprove God's ex
istence. But 1 would suggest that if you have to
look around for something, then it's lost from
you. The question then becomes should you
believe or should you not. and if you have no

motivating reason to believe, then you can quit
believing without theory to be proven to you
one way or another."
— "You guys have obviously been to one
too many C.I.V. lectures."
The recently fired outreach
director of Stanford Bridge
"Sometimes I wonder how much the world

would change if I were not in it."
— "NOT MUCH"
People who enjoy being obvious
"I'm bored!"
"Finals suck"
"I love my mom"

The words and phrases scrawled on desks and carrels in Green Library offer a glimpse into the
complex psyches of Stanford students.
