# Ed School, Hillel, others get new buildings
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Just like a real farm changes its crops, the Farm
known as the Stanford campus is sprouting new
buildings. Five large-scale construction projects that
will change the face of the campus are currently in the
planning, building or finishing stages.
The Graduate Student Community Center
opened its doors to students yesterday after comple
tion in late August and the old Dunn-Bacon house on
the Row will become Hillel's new home at the end of
November.
Construction for an athletic recreation center is
currently taking place at the site of the old Encina
gym. Plans are being drawn up for new graduate stu
dent dorms behind the Law School and for an educa
tion building in the former home of the Career De
velopment Center, next to the Clock Tower.
New School of Education building
The old CDC was damaged in an electrical fire
three years ago, and since then people on campus
have come to accept the sight of a slightly charred
and abandoned-looking building in the middle of
campus.
On Friday, however, the University reported that
it received $3 million from alumni and longtime

donors Bill and Donnalisa Barnum to renovate the
building and turn it into a School of Education facili
ty. Named after its donors, the Barnum Family Cen
ter for School and Community Partnerships will
open in the fall of 2006 and will house the School of
Education's John W. Gardner Center for Youth and
Their Communities, as well as the Center for Re
search on Teacher Education and School Reform.
"The renovation and the new building will take
full advantage of this wonderful, central site." said
Project Manager Regina Coony.
In order to integrate the Barnum Family Center
into the center of campus, a new entrance courtyard
will be created along Escondido Mall, across from the
Cubberley building. The current entrance off Lasuen
Mall will be upgraded to include landscaping and bi
cycle parking, explained Coony. The end goal of the
Barnum Center construction is to establish a triangle
of education buildings made up by Barnum, Cubber
ley and the Center for Educational Research at Stan
ford.
"The project entails renovation of two existing
buildings built in 1925 â€” the old bookstore and the
old candy store. There will be a new addition of ap
proximately 4,500 square feet," Coony said.
Graduate Community Center
While the Barnum Center project is just begin

ning, the Graduate Community Center project is
coming to a close after about two years of planning
and one year of construction. Construction of the
building, located near the Studio One building, was
finished ahead of schedule and doors opened to stu
dents yesterday, although the formal dedication is on
Oct. 15.
A multi-purpose social hub and meeting place for
Stanford's 7,600 graduate students, the GCC was ini
tially proposed based on discussions of graduate stu
dent needs between the Graduate Student Council
and Associate Dean of Graduate Student Life Chris
Griffith.
"Students are really excited about this space,"
said GSC member Steve Allison, who has worked on
the project fora year and a half. "We have wanted
something like this since the GSC was started about
seven years ago."
Funded by a donation from real estate entrepre
neur and philanthropist John Arrillaga, the 12,000
square foot, two-story center includes conference
rooms, a multi-functional meeting room or ballroom,
a children's room and, among other amenities, a pub
that will open by winter of this year pending obtain
ing its liquor license.
"Students gave input on the design and were real-
