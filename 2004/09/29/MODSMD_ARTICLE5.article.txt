# Ed School, Hillel, others get new buildings
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Just like a real farm changes its crops, the Farm
known as the Stanford campus is sprouting new
buildings. Five large-scale construction projects that
will change the face of the campus are currently in the
planning, building or finishing stages.
The Graduate Student Community Center
opened its doors to students yesterday after comple
tion in late August and the old Dunn-Bacon house on
the Row will become Hillel's new home at the end of
November.
Construction for an athletic recreation center is
currently taking place at the site of the old Encina
gym. Plans are being drawn up for new graduate stu
dent dorms behind the Law School and for an educa
tion building in the former home of the Career De
velopment Center, next to the Clock Tower.
New School of Education building
The old CDC was damaged in an electrical fire
three years ago, and since then people on campus
have come to accept the sight of a slightly charred
and abandoned-looking building in the middle of
campus.
On Friday, however, the University reported that
it received $3 million from alumni and longtime

donors Bill and Donnalisa Barnum to renovate the
building and turn it into a School of Education facili
ty. Named after its donors, the Barnum Family Cen
ter for School and Community Partnerships will
open in the fall of 2006 and will house the School of
Education's John W. Gardner Center for Youth and
Their Communities, as well as the Center for Re
search on Teacher Education and School Reform.
"The renovation and the new building will take
full advantage of this wonderful, central site." said
Project Manager Regina Coony.
In order to integrate the Barnum Family Center
into the center of campus, a new entrance courtyard
will be created along Escondido Mall, across from the
Cubberley building. The current entrance off Lasuen
Mall will be upgraded to include landscaping and bi
cycle parking, explained Coony. The end goal of the
Barnum Center construction is to establish a triangle
of education buildings made up by Barnum, Cubber
ley and the Center for Educational Research at Stan
ford.
"The project entails renovation of two existing
buildings built in 1925 — the old bookstore and the
old candy store. There will be a new addition of ap
proximately 4,500 square feet," Coony said.
Graduate Community Center
While the Barnum Center project is just begin

ning, the Graduate Community Center project is
coming to a close after about two years of planning
and one year of construction. Construction of the
building, located near the Studio One building, was
finished ahead of schedule and doors opened to stu
dents yesterday, although the formal dedication is on
Oct. 15.
A multi-purpose social hub and meeting place for
Stanford's 7,600 graduate students, the GCC was ini
tially proposed based on discussions of graduate stu
dent needs between the Graduate Student Council
and Associate Dean of Graduate Student Life Chris
Griffith.
"Students are really excited about this space,"
said GSC member Steve Allison, who has worked on
the project fora year and a half. "We have wanted
something like this since the GSC was started about
seven years ago."
Funded by a donation from real estate entrepre
neur and philanthropist John Arrillaga, the 12,000
square foot, two-story center includes conference
rooms, a multi-functional meeting room or ballroom,
a children's room and, among other amenities, a pub
that will open by winter of this year pending obtain
ing its liquor license.
"Students gave input on the design and were real-
ly viewed as partners in constructing," Al
lison said. "We pushed fora wood floor,
pub space, soft seating couches and chairs
and a big screen TV."
The space will accommodate meetings
between graduate students from different
departments and serve as a gathering
place for graduate students who do not
have on-campus housing, according to
Griffith.
"The Center will provide a better
sense of connection and community
among grad students," she said. "Forty
eight percent of grad students are off cam
pus and don't have a residence connection
so this will be critical as a place to meet
their associates."
Graduate student Kyle Douglas, who
lives in Mountain View, visited the center
yesterday and said he was impressed with
the space, particularly the common area.
Although no one else was there at 6 p.m.
yesterday, he said he would use the facili
ty as a place to get out of his office every
now and then.

Five large-scale projects will
change face of campus

Hillel building on Row
Community space for both graduate
and undergraduate students will also be in
creased this year by the new Harold and
Libby Ziff Center for Jewish Life, located
at 565 Mayfield, the old Dunn-Bacon
House. Leased by Hillel, the Ziff Center
will be complete around Thanksgiving and
will provide a community center for Hillel
and a meeting space for at-large student
groups.
The Ziff Center project has been about
four years in the making. Unlike other
University-funded construction projects
on campus, the Ziff Center is funded by
Hillel, an independent non-profit organi
zation. As such, explained Hillel's Execu
tive Director Adina Danzig, it took the or
ganization several years to raise sufficient
funds for the restoration.
Other projects
Graduate student dorms and the Ar
riliaga Family Recreation Center are the
two other major construction projects in

the works on campus at this time.
The Arrillaga Family Recreation Cen
ter will stand in place of the old Encina
Gym, which used to house the Stanford
Marching Band, and will serve as an ath
letic facility focused on serving University
students and staff.
According to project manager Mark
Bonino, the recreation center will provide
basketball courts, fencing facilities, weight
training, fitness programs, a climbing wall,
squash courts, an academic resources cen
ter and a sports medicine clinic. Construc
tion is running on schedule and will likely
be completed in July of 2005.
The plans fora large graduate student
dorm project are scheduled to be complete
around the same time. Funding for the
dorms comes from the largest housing do
nation in University history — $43.5 mil
lion from Charles T. Munger and his wife
Nancy. The dorms will house about 600
students, roughly the same number as
Stern Hall, and will be located behind the
Law School.
