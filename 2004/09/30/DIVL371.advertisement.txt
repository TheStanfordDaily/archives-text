Be a Daily columnist.
Applications are due by Friday, Oct. 8
Submit a packet with your contact information, two sample columns (500-600 words each), a list of 10 column ideas and a proposed theme for your column to The Daily either by e-mail at opinions@daily.stanford.edu or in a
sealed envelope to The Daily's offices at the Storke Publications Building. Applications will be reviewed in an anonymous fashion, so do not mention your name in your sample columns or ideas. AH applicants will be considered
to either be a features or opinions columnist. Feel free to indicate a preference fora type of column if you have one. Features columnists generally write social commentary pieces that deÂ§l with issues such as fashion and style,
mating and dating, food and entertainment, travel and beer pong. Opinions columnists generally tackle issues regarding campus, local, state or national news and affairs, although their pieces should still be written in an engag
ing manner and can be lighthearted in tone, unlike this paragraph.
