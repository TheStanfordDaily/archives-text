SOME: MEN ARE CHANGED BY HISTORY...OTHERS MAKE IT.
"KERIIYS 'APOCALYPSE NOW!' Butler can be a powerful
storyteller. What stares you in the face is the anguish and grief of
men who put their lives in the line of fire fora government that
undertook a pointless war, mismanaged it, kept it going out of
hubris and then abandoned it.
WATCH THIS AND TRY NOT TO WEEP."
Frank Rich. THE NEW YORK TIMES
"COMPELLING. POTENT AND EYE-OPENING." GRADE: A
Owen GlolDerman, ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY
"IT'S A MOVIE MUCH LIKE ITS SUBJECT:
PASSiIONATE BUT DELIBERATE.
AVOIDING SENSATION BUT
DETERMINED TO TELL
THE FULL, TRUE STORY."
Richard Coillis, TIME
"ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED
POLITICAL DOCUMENTARIES OF
THE FALL! 'Going Upriver' provides
an inspiring portrait of Kerry."
