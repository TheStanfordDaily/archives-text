# Panel analyzes Putin's Russia, compares his tenure to Bush's
## 
### JOE SEXTON 
Professors from Stanford and UC - Santa Cruz spoke on a
panel to discuss the recent terrorist attacks in Russia and Pres
ident Vladimir Putin's moves to consolidate power within his
country. Panelists drew parallels between Putin and President
George W. Bush.
The speakers each criticized Putin's handling of the
Chechen insurgency, arguing that his aggressive tactics are
deepening the conflict. On Sept. 1, Chechen rebels took a
school hostage in Beslan. Russia, a stand-off that ended three
days later with over 300 dead. Stanford Institute for Interna
tional Studies Senior Fellow Gail Lapidus set a sharp tone for
the discussion, arguing that Putin has used military force reck
lessly in his counter-terrorist initiatives.
"Both governments [Yeltsin's and Putin's] rejected a
whole range of options for using diplomacy," she said. "They
were deliberately rejected."
Lapidus also said that the excessive use of military force is
exacerbating the problem of terrorism.
"The use of the military itself has involved an ever-widen
ing circle of casualties, but also an ever-widening circle of en
emies," she said. "Revenge becomes a major motivation for
joining the insurgency."
Fellow panelist Kathryn Stoner-Weiss — senior researcher
and assistant director at the Center on Democracy, Develop
ment and the Rule of Law —joined Lapidus in condemning
Putin's tendency to use military force prematurely and unilat
erally, claiming that more international support should be
pursued in the future.
"It is a good time to involve international institutions, and
perhaps the United Nations is one avenue," she said.
Stoner-Weiss also criticized Putin's strategy of trying to
centralize power in Russia by assuming the authority of re
gional. democratically elected legislatures.
"The state is getting bigger and the population is getting
smaller. Instead of moving away from democracy, Putin
should be moving towards it," she said, adding that a stronger,
multi-party political system would stabilize Russia and ulti
mately make the nation less vulnerable to terrorism.
Panelist Michael Urban, professor of politics at UC Santa
Cruz, soon turned the discussion toward the political land
scape in the United States, noting that the global war on ter
ror has been crucial to the popularity of both the Bush and
Putin administrations.
"Politically, war in Chechnya was Putin's trampoline into
power," he said. "Russia's rulers do not act to stop the war,
they act to manage it."
He argued that in both Russia and in the United States, cit
izens want "champions, fighting on their behalf—people
who are not afraid of terrorists."
Urban's comments resonated with some Stanford students
in the lecture, including coterminal graduate student Bonnie
Bratnober.
"I hadn't ever thought about Russia and Chechnya as a paral
lel between the U.S. and Iraq conflict," she said. "Putin and Bush
did not seem to entertain any other method of resolving the con
flict other than aggressive tactics. Also, the exploitation of a
tragedy: the countries are so vulnerable, and to think back and
see how they are using this tragedy as a launching point for this
other agenda is sobering and kind of disgusting."
This panel discussion was the first of many events that will
be hosted by the Center for Russian, East European &
Eurasian Studies this fall.
