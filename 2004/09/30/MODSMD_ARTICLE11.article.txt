1937 — On Sept. 30, The Stanford Daily ran a story on an Associate Supreme
Court Justice's refusal to comment on his involvement in the Ku Klux Klan
and how it could alienate President Franklin Roosevelt's voters. Below is an
excerpt.
"The continued silence of Associate Supreme Court Justice Hugo L.
Black on his asserted membership in the Ku Klux Klan, the white-hooded
'secret organization' once prominent in American politics, may result in
alienating from President Roosevelt several important racial and religious
groups of voters that once supported him, according to Professor Thomas S.
Barclay of the Stanford political science department.
Justice Black returned yesterday from a four-week trip to France and
England, and refused to comment on a series of newspaper articles published
recently which declared that the former Alabama Senator and the first ap
pointment of Roosevelt to the Supreme Court held a life membership in the
Klan.
•Black's appointment to the court seems to have been primarily the result
of political jockeying between the President and the Senate,' Barclay co
mented. He added that 'as a contest in tactics, it has well been said that all the
winners seem to have lost. In the East and North where the Democratic Party
has recently achieved great success, the Klan is thoroughly despised."
1960 — On Sept. 30, The Stanford Daily ran a story about the Michigan gov
ernor's Memorial Auditorium speech blasting presidential nominee Richard
Nixon on his civil liberties record. Below is an excerpt.
"G. Mennen 'Soapy' Williams, Democratic governor of Michigan, in a
Memorial Auditorium appearance yesterday, portrayed Republican presi
dential nominee Richard Nixon as a villain who has subverted American civil
liberties.
The governor's attacks on Nixon came as part of a highly partisan ap
praisal of the differences between the two political parties before a partly
filled auditorium. He said that there is nothing more pernicious than views
that there is little difference between the parties.
Using the civil liberties issue as a point of comparison. Williams said, it is
almost unkind to compare the Nixon record on civil liberties with that of any
other person. The mere name of Nixon recalls the many Herblock cartoons
of Nixon with the tarbrush, Nixon emerging from the sewer ...
'Here in California it is too painful to fill in all the details — for Nixon in
vented McCarthyism before anyone heard of McCarthy.
'Nixon impugned the loyalty of a Congressman, a nominee of the Senate,
a Secretary of State, and a President of the United States. He drafted a piece
of legislation which Thomas E. Dewey, his own party's presidential nominee,
denounced....'"
