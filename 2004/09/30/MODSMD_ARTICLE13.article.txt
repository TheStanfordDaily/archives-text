Alcohol use and abuse
If you suspect that you or a friend
may have a problem with alcohol,
there are many resources you can
turn to for help. Resident assis
tants,undergo training to aid their
residents dealing with alcohol-relat
ed issues and can point you in the
right direction. If you would like pro
fessional counseling, Drug Educator

Ralph Castro
offers assess
ment sessions.
Contact him
at (650) 723-
3429 or at rj
castro@stan-
ford.edu.
breakfast:
Fuel for
your brain
Many stu-

dents skip
breakfast, rolling out of bed at the
last possible minute before they
have to bike to class. But missing
out on this first meal will set you up
for low blood sugar, making it

more difficult to concentrate in
class. If you are pressed for time,
keep a stock of single-serving yo
gurt cups in your fridge and shove
one in your bag before you hit the
road. Pair it with a piece of fruit
and you are set to go.
Cpr training and first aid
classes
Many students, faculty and staff on
campus choose to undergo CPR

training to prepare
for unexpected
health emergencies.
The Vaden Student
Health Center of
fers a series of cours
es for groups —
open to student or
faculty organiza
tions and dorms —
for those who would
like to receive CPR
certification or learn
first-aid basics. The
four-hour adult

CPR training class
costs $20 per student per class.
Check out http://vaden.stanford.edu
for more information on that and
other courses.

Don't avoid the dentist
Perhaps it was the candy-binge
during a late-night chat session or
a result of too many sugary Krispy
Kremes — whatever the reason
for your cavity, deal with it pronto
before it gets serious. Vaden
keeps a list of local dentists on
hand that offer student discounts.
You can pick up a dental resource
packet on the first floor of the
health center.
Eating disorders and disor
dered eating
It is estimated that 10 to 15 percent
of college-age women suffer from
an eating disorder. If you find
yourself preoccupied with body
image, food or exercise, or just
want some sound nutrition advice,
schedule an appointment with
Stanford's on-site nutritionist at

Vaden, Vivian
Crisman. You can
reach her at (650)
723-1999 or at
vcrisman@stan
ford.edu.
Feeling under
the weather?
When you are
feeling blue, there
are a variety of
support struc
tures to help you
see the silver lin-

ing in those gray clouds. Drop by
the Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) at Vaden fora
free counseling session (all regis
tered students get free short-term
counseling) or head over to The
Bridge — a student-run counsel
ing service — on Salvatierra Walk
(near the bike shop) for some peer
help from 9 a.m. to midnight. If you
are in need of counseling during
off-hours, call the Bridge hotline,
available 24 hours a day, at (650)
723-3392.
Gynecological exam —
Yep, every year
Women who over 18 or who are
sexually active are advised to
make an annual visit to the gyne
cologist. Discuss birth control op
tions, take your Pap smear and
get all of your pressing questions
answered at your yearly appoint
ment. If you choose to see the
doctor at Vaden, download their
medical history form from the
Web site at http://vaden.stan
ford.edu/medical_services/ms_w
omenhealth.html.
Hiv / AIDS testing on campus
Free, anonymous HIV testing and
follow-up counseling is available to
all Stanford students. Every person
goes to two appointments: one for
the test and the second for the result
consultation — both with the same
counselor. Results are kept confi
dential. To schedule an appoint
ment, call (650) 498-2336, ext. 1.
Immunizations and illness
prevention
According to the American College
Health Association studies have
shown that people living in high
density residences (such as dorms)
are six times more likely to get sick
than those living off-campus. No
surprises there, so make sure your
immunizations are up-to-date.
Freshmen are particularly vulnera
ble to bacterial meningitis, and
many experts recommend a vacci
nation against this potentially life
threatening disease.

Just not feeling we 11...
If you feel sick or have a health con
cern and would like to see a doctor or
a nurse, you can make an appoint
ment at Vaden's Medical Services.

Vaden is a fully-stocked clinic that
can perform a variety of diagnostic
tests and prescribe medications.
The facility is not open on week
ends, but appointments are avail
able all throughout the week. While
you can drop in without an appoint
ment, unless you enjoy waiting, ap
pointments are highly recommend
ed. Call Vaden to schedule yours at
(650) 498-2336, ext. 1.
Keeping the nights safe
Looking fora safe ride home dur
ing the late night hours? Student
run 5-SURE is available from 8
p.m. to 2 a.m. every night to drive
you home safely in a golf cart when
you don't feel comfortable walking
around alone. Give 5-SURE a cal,l
(650) 725-SURE from a cell
phone, inform them of your loca
tion and your destination, and wait
fora second phone call that will let
you when your ride has arrived.

Let's get it
Started in
Here...
The Sexual
Health Peer
Resource Cen
ter, SHRPC, on
the second
floor of Vaden,
gives out 12
condoms to
every student
each quarter

and offers an assortment of other
goodies for purchase. Students who
have undergone a rigorous training
class are available to answer your
most difficult sex-related questions

(except how to
get some —
that's a task for
Roxy Sass).
The center is
open from
noon to 5 p.m.
Monday thru
Saturday.
Medicate
me
You don't
need to go to

downtown Palo Alto to fill your
prescriptions: Vaden's pharmacy
can supply what you need, often at
lower prices. The campus pharma
cy even takes out-of-area prescrip
tions.
Nutritious bites on and
off campus
Looking fora change from Stern or
FloMo dining, but want to keep it
healthy? There are several healthy
eating options on the Farm. Fora
quick snack, Jamba Juice offers
smoothies and fruit juices. Other
campus eateries such as Olives and
Bytes offer fresh options for those
days when you miss the dining hall
open hours. Popular off-campus

spots that
won't bust
your wal
let or
boost your
chol e s -
terol lev
els include
Pluto's on
University
Ave. or
Mediter
ran e an
Wraps on
California
Ave.

Oh #$%@! My roommate
passed out!
You come home from a party and
your roommate is as sick as a dog
from the world's longest game of
Beirut. First, check if he or she is
conscious. If not, call 9-11 (or 9-911
from a campus phone) immediate

ly and then inform your RA. If he
or she is fully conscious and hurling
away, make sure that he or she is
laying on the side to prevent the in
halation of vomit.
Peer Health Educators:
Your health gurus
Turn to your Peer Health Educa
tor when you're in need of some
quick health advice. These stu
dents have taken a Vaden-spon
sored class and are knowledgeable
about a wide range of health top
ics. If you are interested in becom
ing a PHE, you must attend an in
formational session in January.

Quakes:
Yes, you're
in Califor
nia
Many East
Coast stu
dents trem
ble at the
thought of a
quake. Un
derstand-
able, given
that the
Golden State
has a history

of big quakes. If you feel the ground
shaking, move away from windows,
bookcases and any items that are
likely to fall. Stand under a dorm
frame or duck under a sturdy desk,
holding on until the shaking stops,
then walk to an outside location.
up on your health

Vaden has an ex
tensive health li
brary on the sec
ond floor near the
Health Promo
tion desk with
books about any
thing and every
thing you needed
to know about
your health.
Comfy couches in
front of the book
collection make
for cozy and edu
cational reading.

Sexual assault assistance
If you believe you have been a vic
tim of sexual assault, Stanford has
its Campus Sexual Assault Re
sponse and Recovery Team that
can provide various forms of assis
tance, from medical and psycholog
ical to legal and academic. If some
thing happens, don't wait: Call
(650) 725-9955. The Coalition
Against Sexual Assault offers out
reach educational programs to pre
vent sexual assault. If you would
like your dorm to feature one of
their programs, contact Kate Bed
ford at Vaden at (650) 725-3190 or
at health@stanford.edu.

Traveling soon?
Stop by the Vaden
Travel Clinic, where
you can get a full brief
ing on health issues you
are likely to encounter
in the countries you are
visiting. The clinic also
offers immunizations
and medications that
you may need while
traveling. Each ap
pointment is $30 for
registered students.

Call (650) 498-2336, ext. 1, for an ap
pointment.

Undergraduate health care
All undergrads are automatically
subscribed to Stanford's health in
surance plan. Cardinal Care, for
$516 each quarter. If you receive
health insurance from another
source, you can waive the insur
ance on Axess. For more informa
tion, visit the Web site at

http://CardinalCare.stanford.edu.
Volunteer to keep Stanford
healthy
There are many ways students
can volunteer in keeping the
Stanford community in tip-top
shape. Students can volunteer or
work in different positions — as
PHEs, staff members at the
SHPRC, with the Bridge, to name
a few. Some volunteers have cre
ated health awareness campaigns,
working with Health Promotion
Services at Vaden. If you are in
terested in getting involved, con
tact Staff Specialist Kate Bed
ford, health@stanford.edu.

out on
the Farm
There are endless
ways to get moving
at Stanford: Swim
in the Avery
Aquatic Center's
olympic-size pool,
play tennis in the
Taube Tennis Sta
dium or pump
some iron at
Tresidder Fitness
Center or in the Ar-

illaga Family Sports Center
weight room. Check out
http://www.stanford.edu/dept/pe/
recsched.html for the recreation
hours of all of the fitness facilities
on campus or join one of the
dozens of physical education
classes offered through the De
partment of Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation.
X-rays and broken limbs
If you think you may have broken
or sprained a wrist or ankle playing
basketball or any other sport, get
yourself over to the emergency
room at the Hospital for x-rays. If
you think the injury is serious,
don't attempt to move —just have
a friend call 911 (or 9-911 on a cam
pus phone).
I oga on the Farm
The Athletics Department offers
yoga classes nearly every day for
beginners and intermediate stu
dents — check the time schedule
on http://axess.stanford.edu to find
a class that fits your schedule. If
you need a yoga mat (which can
also be used for Pilates classes),
you can pick one up at Roble Gym.

Zzz's — You need 'em!
According to surveys by William
Dement, professor of psychiatry
and behavioral sciences, a full 80
percent of undergrads suffer from
sleep deprivation. Stanford will
offer you plenty of opportunities to
stay awake 24 hours a day, but if
you don't get enough sleep, you'll
be low on energy and may find
your academic or athletic activities
suffer. If you need help with time
management, schedule an appoint
ment at the Undergraduate Advis
ing Center — and make some time
to get your precious shut-eye.
