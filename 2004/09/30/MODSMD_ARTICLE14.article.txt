## Why women's health issues deserve a closer look 
### LAUREN GONG COLUMNIST 
The majority of people in the
world are women. The majority of
people living in poverty are women.
The majority of adolescents with
eating disorders, victims of domes
tic violence and contractors of the
HIV virus are all women. Can you
see a trend here?
This column is just a short intro
duction to some pressing women's
health issues. In the future, I will
focus specifically on a single issue
each week, but whether I address
issues on the Stanford campus or
regarding global health concerns,
the ongoing theme here is
women's health, a topic that is
often overlooked.
First, a little about me: I'm a ju
nior majoring in human biology
with a concentration in global
health and human behavior. I first
became interested in women's
health after researching adoles
cence and AIDS this summer,
doing research with Prof. Anne
Firth Murray and working with
adolescent medicine specialist Dr.
Rebecka Peebles. They were two
completely different experiences,
one focused mostly on world
health concerns, while the other
focused on a single psychological
disease, eating disorders. The link
between the two, however, was the
fact that the majority of victims are
women.
Throughout my work experi
ence, I was shocked at the over
whelming number of health issues
specifically facing women. Around
the world, being female can mean
reduced access to health care,
greater exposure to violence and
sexual assault and economic depen
dence for life.
As Stanford students, we are not
sheltered from gendered health is
sues. Take eating disorders: While
disordered eating among male ath
letes has received some publicity,
eating disorders remains a disease
predominantly affecting women.
Studies have shown rates as high as
15 percent of girls in high school
purge daily.
Because we hear so much about
them, however, anorexia and bu
limia have become buzzwords,
leading some people to take the
conditions less seriously. Others
view these psychological conditions
as merely a problem of over-privi
leged girls with low self-esteem. In
reality, eating disorders cause the

most deaths among psychological
illnesses and affect many more
women than most can imagine.
Globally, the problems facing
women are equally — if not more
— serious. According to the Joint
U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS, in
some African countries, adoles
cent girls have a risk of contracting
AIDS that is two to three times
higher than males of that same
age. Girls are biologically more
susceptible and, as a whole, are
less educated on sexual health is
sues, putting them at an even
greater risk for contracting the
disease. The conference reported
that, of newly infected cases in the
world, females in Asia make up a
full 25 percent.
Currently, AIDS is not just a dis
ease affecting one subgroup or even
one continent. It is a global pan
demic, and one that is affecting
women in a significant way.
While the situation may sound
bleak for the health of women in
developing and developed coun
tries, women can certainly make a
difference in both their health and
the health of their communities,
becoming key health resources.
Over the summer, the U.N. AIDS
conference in Bangkok, Thailand
painted the image of an African
woman as both the key victim and
key fighter against the virus.
Women are now officially recog
nized as major players in the fight
against the virus and as the prima
ry caretakers of the sick, even if
they are the primary contractors of
such diseases.
I hope this column has served
as a short introduction into why I
think women's health is such an
important issue. While there are
many so-called "health" maga
zines out there aimed at women,
they have traditionally focused on
the aesthetic aspect of being
healthy — often to the point of
advocating unhealthy habits (such
as extreme diets) — I still think
that women's health has been
largely ignored. On a global scale,
and even just on Stanford campus,
many health problems exist that
are gendered and should be treat
ed as such.
