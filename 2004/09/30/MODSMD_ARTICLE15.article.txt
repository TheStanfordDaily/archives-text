## Editorial Stanford Dining's scheduling changes add value for students 
### 
Scheduling changes at Florence Moore Din
ing Hall have left its residents wondering
where they will eat on Fridays and Satur
days when Residential Education and Din
ing shuts down meal services beginning Nov. 5. Al
though this may be an inconvenience for students
who will now have to eat elsewhere, eliminating
those days of service has allowed Stanford Dining
to extend its operational hours to better suit Uni
versity students' needs throughout the rest of the
week.
FloMo residents, especially freshmen, have ex
pressed concern over losing five meals a week in
their residence hall, inhibiting their ability to con
nect with dorm mates. This worry is accentuated by
the fact that the eliminated meals fall toward the
end of the week, an ideal time for students to so
cialize without the pressures of classes and problem
sets looming over their heads.
Although some have speculated that these
changes are the result of budget cuts, Stanford Din
ing maintains this is not the case. Rather, the
changes were made to "create more flexibility,
choice and simplicity without raising meal plan
rates nor comprising efficiencies," according to
Rafi Taherian, acting executive director of Stan
ford Dining.
By eliminating Friday and Saturday meals at
Flo Mo, Stanford Dining has enabled itself to pro
vide other services in response to feedback from
students, Stanford Dining staff and University ad
ministrators last year. Dining officials have ex
tended dining hall hours until 8 p.m., Monday
through Friday, at FloMo and two other dining lo
cations on campus.
Additional changes at FloMo include an organ
ic station offering an organic entree every lunch
and dinner, and the dining staff is designing its
own organic vegetable and herb garden. Rotisserie
equipment is also being installed. FloMo students
with meal plan points can now use those points at
any retail or residential location managed by Stan
ford Dining.
Although some of the changes are somewhat
limited in appeal — particularly the self-run organ
ic vegetable and herb garden, which will cater to a
very small minority of students — we applaud Stan
ford Dining's decision to cut meals on Fridays and
Saturdays in favor of extending dinner hours during
other nights, which is practical in light of students'

often packed schedules. Staying open until 8 p.m.
will allow students more flexibility in choosing
when they eat, rather than being forced to eat when
they are not yet hungry or unable to eat at all be
cause of conflicting classes or extracurricular activ
ities.
From a business perspective, Stanford Dining's
decision was reasonable, as less than 50 percent of
FloMo residents eat their lunch and dinner there on
Fridays and Saturdays, and only 20 percent eat
breakfast on Friday mornings. It hardly makes
sense for the FloMo dining hall to stay open with
such limited usage.
Many students — including members of this edi
torial board — have made the argument that Stan
ford Dining should aim to operate in the style of an
efficient, market-driven business. The organization
still has a long way to go in this regard, as dining
prices are still far too expensive relative to value pro
vided. But the changes that Stanford Dining is cur
rently undertaking are steps in the right direction.
Demand should always guide allocation deci
sions. Given Stanford Dining's current financial sit
uation, students cannot have both extended dining
hours and seven-day-a-week service at Flo Mo. If
Stanford Dining wants to avoid ballooning meal
plan costs, it has to make some difficult decisions
such as this one. Thus, it is encouraging that Stan
ford Dining is listening to student input and trying
to make the best of its limited resources.
Even car-less FloMo freshmen, who cannot
leave campus on weekends and must instead go to
an alternative dining location, might benefit from
this new schedule arrangement. On the weekends,
they will have the opportunity to meet students
from other residence halls and broaden their net
work of contacts. Notably, this will force SLE stu
dents, housed in East FloMo, to become more ac
quainted with those not in their program, which
some have said to be too isolating.
According to Taherian, Stanford Dining's prima
ry objective in making these changes was "to honor
students' requests for more access to retail locations
and later hours of service at the dinner meal peri
od." Although Stanford Dining plans are still not a
great buy, dining officials are working to provide
more value through changes such as this scheduling
rearrangement. We and the rest of the Stanford
community appreciate their efforts to better serve
students.
