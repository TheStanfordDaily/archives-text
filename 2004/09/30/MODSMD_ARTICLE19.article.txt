## Remember that there's no place like Stanford 
### CHRISTOPHER R. VAUGHAN 
At one point during my time
abroad in Chile last year, I took
up an invitation to watch a
psychedelic film made by the cult
idol Alejandro Jodorowsky at the
financial behest of John Lennon.
In some scenes of "The Holy
Mountain," the actors walked
naked. In the version that had en
tered Chile under the Pinochet
dictatorship, however, white discs
had been superimposed on the
screen to conceal the actors' pri
vate parts.
What was revealed to me in this
movie were two things: that the
tentacles of censorship reached
deep and wide, and that white
dots can't cover everything.
To grasp that this hypnotic
anti-military film even entered
Pinochet's Chile nearly requires a
flight of mind in itself, since so
many other works of art didn't.
Art that questioned the political
norm or seemed skeptical of reli
gious conservatism met a closed
door, beginning with the irrup
tions of 1973 and continuing well
past the fall of the military regime
in 1990.
The laughable dot-censorship
of "The Holy Mountain" points to
a depressing reality not exclusive
to South American military
regimes: that the banning or half
concealing of "threatening" art
finds its political match in the sti
fling of dissent and its psycho-so
cial match in the constriction of
the imagination.
1 was reminded of these retro
grade things, and then at once
hoped they bore no relevance to
Stanford, when I picked up Tues
day's Daily and read that the Uni
versity had reneged on its plan to
acquire Dennis Oppenheim's
sculpture entitled "Device to
Root Out Evil." It is hard to draw
conclusions from the article, but
let us at least step back and con
sider what we know.

The commission of a university
with explicit aspirations to a lib
eral education petitioned — at
great cost and commitment to the
artist — the making of a sculp
ture, which the president then
banned as "not appropriate" in an
overrule of his official recommen
dation panel, a decision impor
tant enough to gain the front page
of the campus paper but that has
not yet been explained in a sub
stantial way.
Perhaps the rejection was just a
matter of landscaping. Perhaps no
contract with Oppenheim was
broken. Perhaps nothing like cen
sorship occurred. 1 want to be con
vinced of these things, but that can
only occur with a transparent an
swer from the administration.
When 1 think of these events,
1 am also reminded of the impor
tance of Lennon and Jodor
owsky's project. Art can fulfill
the daunting tasks of inquiry,
dissent and transgression that so
often seem inaccessible to anx
ious humans. When the soul's
impulse to ask anything and try
everything meets the barriers of
judgment and self-doubt, it is art
that can carry the day — and the
idea.
We need make no concessions to
hateful art — so much of it religious
in nature —as we permit, if not
quite demand, the entry of uncom
fortable art. When I finished read
ing Tuesday's article, I turned to the
next page, the innovation section, to
see its massive headline, "Physical
Beauty," and its sub-headline,
"Learn the latest in Physics; toss
your textbooks."
There are many ways, evidently,
to judge innovation and beauty.
Let us hope, on this putatively lib
eral campus, that "appropriate
ness" is not among them. Universi
ty President John Hennessy owes
Stanford a meaningful explanation.
