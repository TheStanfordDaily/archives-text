# Law students sacrifice to repay debt
## Grads forced to take private sector jobs to pay off loans 
### ALIYYA HAQUE 
Allegations that a Stanford Law School
graduate worked as a prostitute partly in
order to repay her loans have raised questions
among students and administrators about the
difficulties law school students face in paying
back their educational debt.
At Stanford, the average student owes ap
proximately $83,000 upon graduation.
Though Stanford offers a loan repayment
program that is comparable to those offered
by other top law schools, students say they
feel pressure forgo their top-choice jobs for
ones that pay more.
According to the Oakland Tribune, feder
al prosecutors are alleging that Cristina
Schultz, Law School Class of 2001, worked as
a call girl in part to pay off close to $300,000 in
student loans. No charges have been filed
against Schultz at this point.
Though Schultz's case is extreme, the real
ity is that many law school students are tens of
thousands of dollars in debt once they receive

their diplomas. As a result, few law students
enter the public sector, where jobs pay far less
than those at top private firms.
Frank Brucato. senior associate dean for
finance at the Law School, said that approxi
mately 10 percent of each year's graduating
class enter government or public service posi
tions, while the vast majority end up in higher
paying private-sector jobs.
Taking a high-paying job strictly for finan
cial reasons is not unique to Stanford Law
School students.
Jan Conroy, spokesperson for Yale Law
School, said that reconciling law student loan
debt with students' entry-level jobs, whether
they are high- or low-paying, is an issue that
all law schools must face.
In 1987, the Stanford's Law School created
its own loan repayment assistance program,
which allows graduates working in public ser
vice or government positions to pay off their
educational debt more easily.
"We believe our average payout per grad
uate is higher than in any other law school,"
Brucato said. "[The repayment program]
does not only minimize the economic hard
ship of loans, but in fact also eliminates this

The financial aid office is often the first stop for law school students, but
their financial struggles rarely end there.
