# Law students sacrifice to repay debt
## Grads forced to take private sector jobs to pay off loans 
### ALIYYA HAQUE 
Allegations that a Stanford Law School
graduate worked as a prostitute partly in
order to repay her loans have raised questions
among students and administrators about the
difficulties law school students face in paying
back their educational debt.
At Stanford, the average student owes ap
proximately $83,000 upon graduation.
Though Stanford offers a loan repayment
program that is comparable to those offered
by other top law schools, students say they
feel pressure forgo their top-choice jobs for
ones that pay more.
According to the Oakland Tribune, feder
al prosecutors are alleging that Cristina
Schultz, Law School Class of 2001, worked as
a call girl in part to pay off close to $300,000 in
student loans. No charges have been filed
against Schultz at this point.
Though Schultz's case is extreme, the real
ity is that many law school students are tens of
thousands of dollars in debt once they receive

their diplomas. As a result, few law students
enter the public sector, where jobs pay far less
than those at top private firms.
Frank Brucato. senior associate dean for
finance at the Law School, said that approxi
mately 10 percent of each year's graduating
class enter government or public service posi
tions, while the vast majority end up in higher
paying private-sector jobs.
Taking a high-paying job strictly for finan
cial reasons is not unique to Stanford Law
School students.
Jan Conroy, spokesperson for Yale Law
School, said that reconciling law student loan
debt with students' entry-level jobs, whether
they are high- or low-paying, is an issue that
all law schools must face.
In 1987, the Stanford's Law School created
its own loan repayment assistance program,
which allows graduates working in public ser
vice or government positions to pay off their
educational debt more easily.
"We believe our average payout per grad
uate is higher than in any other law school,"
Brucato said. "[The repayment program]
does not only minimize the economic hard
ship of loans, but in fact also eliminates this

The financial aid office is often the first stop for law school students, but
their financial struggles rarely end there.
hardship. If their starting salary is
$40,000 or less, then graduates will
pay nothing towards their educa
tional debt."
Similar loan forgiveness pro
grams have been developed at top
law schools around the country, in
cluding Harvard, where students
leave with an average debt of around
$79,000, and Columbia.
Conroy, of Yale Law School,
said, "We want to make sure that our
graduates will be able to take the job
they really want, regardless of debt.
If Yale Law graduates take a rela
tively low-paying job. Yale helps
them make their loan payments."

But such help is far from enough
to compensate for the vast differ
ences in pay between public- and
private-sector jobs.
"The average starting salary fora
Stanford law graduate in these top
firms is $ 125.000 plus bonuses, so it is
easier to pay back loans," Brucato
said. "Stanford Law School makes it
possible for all of its graduates to
pursue all types of legal careers."
Still, some students say that the
decision between entering into a top
firm or a public service job is largely
based on financial circumstances.
"Student loans have been a big
factor in my decision to join a private

firm," said a second-year Stanford
law student who asked to remain
anonymous.
"In top firms, it's so much easier
to pay back loans, since the starting
salary is almost $200,000 per year. It
would take forever if I was in a pub
lic-service oriented job."
For other students, the lifestyle
associated with higher-paying, cor
porate jobs is the attracting feature,
more so than financial burdens.
"Stanford offered the best finan
cial aid out of any of the schools I ap
plied to, so I wasn't as concerned
with loans," said a first-year Stan
ford law student, who also asked to

remain anonymous. "But I still want
to work fora private firm.
"It's also more socially accept
able, and I'd be having a better life."
Though Stanford eases the finan
cial hardships of its graduating stu
dents in terms of educational debt, it
cannot ease the burdens of living on
a small salary.
"There is a clear difference in
lifestyle between those working in a
private firm and those working in
public interest, and unfortunately,
mainly due to financial reasons, this
remains a difficult decision for grad
uating students to make," Brucato
said.

still feel pressure to work in private sector
