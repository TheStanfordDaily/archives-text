Stanford Band's halftime show
did 'cross the line'
I have to wonder if the editorial
board is being intellectually honest
with itself in its opinion entitled
"Athletic Department was right to
not sanction the Band" (Sept. 28)..
The editorial board essentially
reached the conclusion that it was
okay to poke fun at the Mormon re
ligion because the band pokes fun at
all groups.
Would the band ever dare make
fun of gays or of Jews in one of its
routines? There should not be a dou

hie standard. Visitors in attendance
were obviously offended by the half
time show — that should he evi
dence enough that the entertain
ment crossed the line of good humor.

Field show by Band was done in
good humor
I applaud the Stanford Band for
letting us all laugh. Making fun of
polygamy is funny. It was done in a
tasteful manner, and for those of

fended, in the future, please close
your eyes and stop listening to things
that do not please you. Don't ruin the
humor and fun for those of us that
understand a joke when we see one.

Band's show was a 'very poor at
tempt at humor'
As a Mormon I do not view the
Stanford Band's halftime show as
anti-Mormon, nor do I believe it was
intended as such. I also believe no of

fense was meant.
However, the halftime show was
definitely a very poor attempt at
humor. To base the show on a false
stereotype that the Mormon church
has tried to distance itself from is in
sensitive and inappropriate.
To call the show juvenile is accu
rate, as it would seem some effort
would be expended to consider how
the group being made fun of would
feel about the subject. It would appear
that little or no such effort was made.
There is plenty of current and rel
evant Mormon culture to make fun
of. Mormons can laugh at themselves.

but some subjects are just not funny.

Fan gives tips to Buddy on football
I'm still fuming about the football
team's loss to USC. Stanford didn't
lose because of "poor execution" of
the offense in the second half, as
Coach Buddy Teevens claimed at
the press conference. Stanford lost
because of the mind-boggling horri
ble second-half playcalling by the
Stanford coaches.

The entire first half, Stanford had
been chewing up the SC defense
with the pass. But in the second half,
Stanford inexplicably gave up pass
ing and ran the ball almost every
down — with no success. What were
the Stanford coaches thinking —
they trying to run out the clock? All
we needed was one touchdown in
the second half to seal the victory.
I hope the coaches wise up for the
remainder of the season — for our
sake and the players' sake.
