# Thursday Throwback
## Stanford's very own athletic version of 'A Winter's Tale' 
### JEFF COOPER This column originally ran on April 9, 2001 
Stanford's brand spanking new Avery
Aquatic Center will open May 19, an
event that you, no doubt, have found
yourself waking up in the middle of the night
for several weeks to ponder. The breathless
press release declares the new facility "one of
the finest outdoor swimming, diving and water
polo facilities in the United States, and per
haps the world."
Strong words indeed. But I draw your at
tention to the key disclaimer: "outdoor."
The Indiana University Natatorium at Indi
anapolis has long been considered the fastest
pool in America and its aquatic facilities
among the very best worldwide. The Natatori
um is legendary for its climate control, its pro
tection from the elements, its temperate pools
in mid-February â€”all standards to which
Stanford's new facilities cannot adhere.
Which got me to thinking. The Avery
Aquatic Center may be taking perfect advan
tage of the natural weather of Northern Cali
fornia. But what if the makers of "Deep Im
pact" and "Armageddon" were right? What
would happen to our way of life if an apoca
lyptic, meteor-spawned winter struck, burying
the continent in snow and ice year-round?
Would the nation survive? Would we ever see
our families again? Most importantly: How
would Stanford athletes fare in these Arctic
conditions? Let's take a glimpse at the Stan
ford campus, post-apocalypse:
Avery Aquatic Center: That fancy new
pool isn't doing you much good now, is it,
Speedo boys? Duck-like, synchronized swim
mers tread water day in and day out to keep
small pockets of the pool's surface unfrozen.
Below the water line, Olympic Gold Medalist
Misty Hyman swims endless laps, finally free
to reveal her Kevin Costner-esque webbed
feet to the world.
Main Quad: Across most of the campus,
terror reigns as packs of feral Stanford hockey
players, burning with years of being disre
spected, take to the icebound asphalt on their
skates. "We won five games, damn you!" they
cry, slashing at passersby with sticks sharp as
razors. Freshmen are kidnapped and put to
work in the bowels of Wilbur washing and re
washing the team's fetid, stinking uniforms.
Ford Center: Passersby are warned away
from this seeming oasis of warmth and tran
quility by the skeletons of intramural coordi
nators mounted on stakes outside. Those un
wary enough to venture nearby find them
selves ambushed from the trees by silent,
black-clad gymnasts protecting their lair. Like
ninjas, they appear from the shadows and
strike with deadly force, pausing only to
square their shoulders, raise their arms and
smile brightly to the judges before vanishing
back into the cold darkness.
