# Thursday Throwback
## Stanford's very own athletic version of 'A Winter's Tale' 
### JEFF COOPER This column originally ran on April 9, 2001 
Stanford's brand spanking new Avery
Aquatic Center will open May 19, an
event that you, no doubt, have found
yourself waking up in the middle of the night
for several weeks to ponder. The breathless
press release declares the new facility "one of
the finest outdoor swimming, diving and water
polo facilities in the United States, and per
haps the world."
Strong words indeed. But I draw your at
tention to the key disclaimer: "outdoor."
The Indiana University Natatorium at Indi
anapolis has long been considered the fastest
pool in America and its aquatic facilities
among the very best worldwide. The Natatori
um is legendary for its climate control, its pro
tection from the elements, its temperate pools
in mid-February —all standards to which
Stanford's new facilities cannot adhere.
Which got me to thinking. The Avery
Aquatic Center may be taking perfect advan
tage of the natural weather of Northern Cali
fornia. But what if the makers of "Deep Im
pact" and "Armageddon" were right? What
would happen to our way of life if an apoca
lyptic, meteor-spawned winter struck, burying
the continent in snow and ice year-round?
Would the nation survive? Would we ever see
our families again? Most importantly: How
would Stanford athletes fare in these Arctic
conditions? Let's take a glimpse at the Stan
ford campus, post-apocalypse:
Avery Aquatic Center: That fancy new
pool isn't doing you much good now, is it,
Speedo boys? Duck-like, synchronized swim
mers tread water day in and day out to keep
small pockets of the pool's surface unfrozen.
Below the water line, Olympic Gold Medalist
Misty Hyman swims endless laps, finally free
to reveal her Kevin Costner-esque webbed
feet to the world.
Main Quad: Across most of the campus,
terror reigns as packs of feral Stanford hockey
players, burning with years of being disre
spected, take to the icebound asphalt on their
skates. "We won five games, damn you!" they
cry, slashing at passersby with sticks sharp as
razors. Freshmen are kidnapped and put to
work in the bowels of Wilbur washing and re
washing the team's fetid, stinking uniforms.
Ford Center: Passersby are warned away
from this seeming oasis of warmth and tran
quility by the skeletons of intramural coordi
nators mounted on stakes outside. Those un
wary enough to venture nearby find them
selves ambushed from the trees by silent,
black-clad gymnasts protecting their lair. Like
ninjas, they appear from the shadows and
strike with deadly force, pausing only to
square their shoulders, raise their arms and
smile brightly to the judges before vanishing
back into the cold darkness.
Stanford Golf Course: Now the
private hunting grounds of War
lords Hennessy and Leland. Woe he
to the innocent undergrad who
poaches from these pristine groves,
for he will be hunted down by assis
tant athletics directors and made to
watch fencing highlights for the rest
of his days.
Arrillaga Family Sports Center:
The stronghold of Warlord Leland
is a hulking fortress, where Leland
reclines in the Stanford Athletics
Hall Of Fame on a pile of NCAA
Championship plaques, drinking
from a shattered Sears Cup and
hearing pleas from local villagers.
An army of slaves chained to com
puters pounds out press releases,
which are fed into the furnace as
fast as they are produced.
Travelers are welcome, but are
warned to wear Nike: Those wear
ing Reebok or Adidas are subject to
summary execution.

Roscoe Maples Pavilion: Once a
place of joy. Maples is now a house
to madness, run as a prison by
crazed Sixth Man Club members.
Each morning, pallid and skinny
basketball players shuffle out in
chains and run endless slam dunk
drills, each one sending their un
washed crowd of captors into a red
faced frenzy of "Who's your
daddy?" chants. At irregular inter
vals, a volleyball player is made to
take a half-court shot while wearing
Jason Collins's uniform; those that
succeed are given free Round Table
Pizza, while those that fail are ritu
ally sacrificed.
Cobb Track & Angell Field:
Alone among the athletic tribes,
the track and field teams have
thrived in the Ice Age conditions.
A lone javelin thrower stalking his
prey is a common sight now in the
nearby woods, as is Gabe Jennings
trudging barefoot home through

the snow, a wild boar pursued to
exhaustion slung over his shoul
ders. Fat and happy, the teams
roam farther afield every day,
searching for the one thing they
can't provide for themselves:
Krispy Kreme.
Boyd & Jill Smith Family Stadi
um: This is the softball field. I would
say something funny about it, but
you haven't been there.
Stanford Stadium: High on the
ramparts of the Stadium, Tyrone
Willingham watches and waits. He
hears the faint cries of his team from
the locker room below. They are out
of food, firewood, clothing; they
have been starving for days. Also, he
forgot to recruit a punter again. But
he waits still. He will wait forever if
need be. Because even in this new
world, buried under ice and snow,
Tyrone knows one truth: Cal is com
ing. And when they come, he will be
ready for them.

supreme in Maples
Stanford's brand spanking new Avery
Aquatic Center will open May 19, an
event that you, no doubt, have found
yourself waking up in the middle of the night
for several weeks to ponder. The breathless
press release declares the new facility "one of
the finest outdoor swimming, diving and water
polo facilities in the United States, and per
haps the world."
Strong words indeed. But I draw your at
tention to the key disclaimer: "outdoor."
The Indiana University Natatorium at Indi
anapolis has long been considered the fastest
pool in America and its aquatic facilities
among the very best worldwide. The Natatori
um is legendary for its climate control, its pro
tection from the elements, its temperate pools
in mid-February —all standards to which
Stanford's new facilities cannot adhere.
Which got me to thinking. The Avery
Aquatic Center may be taking perfect advan
tage of the natural weather of Northern Cali
fornia. But what if the makers of "Deep Im
pact" and "Armageddon" were right? What
would happen to our way of life if an apoca
lyptic, meteor-spawned winter struck, burying
the continent in snow and ice year-round?
Would the nation survive? Would we ever see
our families again? Most importantly: How
would Stanford athletes fare in these Arctic
conditions? Let's take a glimpse at the Stan
ford campus, post-apocalypse:
Avery Aquatic Center: That fancy new
pool isn't doing you much good now, is it,
Speedo boys? Duck-like, synchronized swim
mers tread water day in and day out to keep
small pockets of the pool's surface unfrozen.
Below the water line, Olympic Gold Medalist
Misty Hyman swims endless laps, finally free
to reveal her Kevin Costner-esque webbed
feet to the world.
Main Quad: Across most of the campus,
terror reigns as packs of feral Stanford hockey
players, burning with years of being disre
spected, take to the icebound asphalt on their
skates. "We won five games, damn you!" they
cry, slashing at passersby with sticks sharp as
razors. Freshmen are kidnapped and put to
work in the bowels of Wilbur washing and re
washing the team's fetid, stinking uniforms.
Ford Center: Passersby are warned away
from this seeming oasis of warmth and tran
quility by the skeletons of intramural coordi
nators mounted on stakes outside. Those un
wary enough to venture nearby find them
selves ambushed from the trees by silent,
black-clad gymnasts protecting their lair. Like
ninjas, they appear from the shadows and
strike with deadly force, pausing only to
square their shoulders, raise their arms and
smile brightly to the judges before vanishing
back into the cold darkness.
Stanford Golf Course: Now the
private hunting grounds of War
lords Hennessy and Leland. Woe he
to the innocent undergrad who
poaches from these pristine groves,
for he will be hunted down by assis
tant athletics directors and made to
watch fencing highlights for the rest
of his days.
Arrillaga Family Sports Center:
The stronghold of Warlord Leland
is a hulking fortress, where Leland
reclines in the Stanford Athletics
Hall Of Fame on a pile of NCAA
Championship plaques, drinking
from a shattered Sears Cup and
hearing pleas from local villagers.
An army of slaves chained to com
puters pounds out press releases,
which are fed into the furnace as
fast as they are produced.
Travelers are welcome, but are
warned to wear Nike: Those wear
ing Reebok or Adidas are subject to
summary execution.

Roscoe Maples Pavilion: Once a
place of joy. Maples is now a house
to madness, run as a prison by
crazed Sixth Man Club members.
Each morning, pallid and skinny
basketball players shuffle out in
chains and run endless slam dunk
drills, each one sending their un
washed crowd of captors into a red
faced frenzy of "Who's your
daddy?" chants. At irregular inter
vals, a volleyball player is made to
take a half-court shot while wearing
Jason Collins's uniform; those that
succeed are given free Round Table
Pizza, while those that fail are ritu
ally sacrificed.
Cobb Track & Angell Field:
Alone among the athletic tribes,
the track and field teams have
thrived in the Ice Age conditions.
A lone javelin thrower stalking his
prey is a common sight now in the
nearby woods, as is Gabe Jennings
trudging barefoot home through

the snow, a wild boar pursued to
exhaustion slung over his shoul
ders. Fat and happy, the teams
roam farther afield every day,
searching for the one thing they
can't provide for themselves:
Krispy Kreme.
Boyd & Jill Smith Family Stadi
um: This is the softball field. I would
say something funny about it, but
you haven't been there.
Stanford Stadium: High on the
ramparts of the Stadium, Tyrone
Willingham watches and waits. He
hears the faint cries of his team from
the locker room below. They are out
of food, firewood, clothing; they
have been starving for days. Also, he
forgot to recruit a punter again. But
he waits still. He will wait forever if
need be. Because even in this new
world, buried under ice and snow,
Tyrone knows one truth: Cal is com
ing. And when they come, he will be
ready for them.
