## HOME, SWEET HOME Maples Pavilion renovation nears completion 
### JESSICA PETERS MANAGING EDITOR 
From the outside, Roscoe Maples Pavilion looks like any
average construction zone, a mass of concrete surrounded
by dirt and a cyclone fence.
But on the inside. Maples is already looking like a sports
lover's dream.
If you can ignore the stacks of boxes and seats and boards,
you can almost picture junior point guard Chris Hernandez
running the floor for the Cardinal. If you can set aside the
clanging sounds of the contractors hard at work, you can
nearly hear the boom of the crowd, the energy of the Sixth
Man Club and the blare of horns from the Band.
And if you take a quick glance around at the renovation's
progress, you'll see all you need to know â€” you'll certainly
be watching another basketball and volleyball season being
successfully played out at the Pavilion this year.
The renovation, which was started in February under

the constraint of a 30 million dollar budget, is now sched
uled to be finished Dec. 1, a month earlier than originally
projected. The first game to take place in the refurbished
facility will be the Stanford women's basketball contest
against Pepperdine.
According to Maple Project Manager Kellie Elliott, the
project was carried out with four goals in mind: improving fa
cilities for student-athletes, keeping costs within the limits of
the budget, maintaining the Pavilion's reputation as a "com
petitive atmosphere" and improving the amenities in place
to make fans more comfortable at events.
Every one of those goals has been met.
"This is one of the most successful projects we've ever un
dertaken," said Athletic Director Ted Leland, who added
that the department will not be in debt when the project is
completed.
While most reactions to the renovation have been posi
tive, some fans have raised concerns about the seating
scheme, which was altered when the lower level bleachers

behind the team benches were converted into padded stadi
um seats. Each bleacher seat was 18 inches wide, but the new
seats are 22" in width, which results in a net loss of 181 seats
in that area. Many season ticket holders were relocated to
spots one to three sections away from their normal seats, and
174 were even bumped to the upper-deck areas.
Overall, the capacity of Maples decreased from 7,391 to
an estimated 7,233. The approximation does not include the
fluctuating number of Sixth Man attendees.
Movement of season ticket holders was kept to a mini
mum, as the athletic department evaluated the holder's do
nations to any part of the university, the length of time that
they have held their tickets and their service to the university.
Leland pointed out that the system is unique, as at
least three other Pacific-10 Conference schools have
done renovations to their basketball facilities and re-

The Maples Pavilion renovation project, which made several improvements and dropped seated capacity by 158, will wrap up Dec. 1, one month ahead of time.
seated season ticket holders based primarily on do
nations to the athletic program.
The Sixth Man Club will not be affected by the re
aranging of the Pavilion, as the lower section on the east
side of Maples will still be home to the marching band and
the screaming, flailing, stomping, clapping student-fans.
The bleachers in this section, however, have been re
placed by standing-only risers, a change that is intended to
fit more students in the section. There will also still be an
overflow section of l(X)-plus seats on the upper level.
Of course, the seats will probably be the last thing on
the minds of guests to the new Maples. The newly-in
stalled fan amenities add striking accents to the already
atmospheric home of Stanford sports.
A 29,(XX) square foot outside concourse is currently
being added, which will replace the fencing around the
Pavilion with store-front glass walls. The concourse will
stretch all the way around the arena and has restrooms
and concession stands scattered throughout.
The first thing to notice upon entry to the new Pavilion
is the $1 million-dollar, state-of-the-art, four-sided hang
ing scoreboard with video display.
Construction Project Manager Dave Schinski ex
plained the impressive scoreboard this way: "You know
the giant screen at the football games? This has three
times the resolution."
The scoreboard will now be the only hanging appara
tus in the building, as championship banners have been
removed and the baskets have been converted to floor
standing hoops in order to improve sightline from the
upper level seating areas.
The PA system was also upgraded in the project.
Using the advice of an audio/visual consultant, the six

overhead speakers are being replaced by 36 speakers
spread out in two rings on the Maples ceiling, which is now
painted black.
"It's more of a theater effect," Schinski said of the paint
job, which is meant to keep attention focused on the floor.
Speaking of the floor, the legendary bouncy Maples
court has been torn out and replaced with a top-of-the
line supported neoprene floor. While the floor does have
some give to it.the next time the crowd rushes the court
and jumps up and down to the beat of "All Right Now",
the spring just won't be the same.
Among the improvements to the athlete facilities are
brand-new lounges and locker rooms, three new rooms
for visiting teams, and vastly upgraded training and
weight rooms. Maples also includes several other behind
the-scenes upgrades, including a brand-new media room
and an enhanced mechanical system.
"I am so thankful that in my senior season I have the
opportunity to play in the new Maples," forward Nick
Robinson said. "There are so many great aspects of
Maples, including the game day atmosphere, the fans,
the Sixth Man Club and the great support we get from
the community. All those aspects will remain when we
play in the new Maples Pavilion."
ITie first opportunity for the public to view the reno
vated Pavilion will be on Dec. 4 when the athletic depart
ment hosts Maples Fan Fest. The event will include tours,
autograph sessions with the basketball teams, shooting
contests, free food and activities for children. Season tick
et holders for men's and women's basketball and
women's volleyball are invited to attend, along with all
Stanford students.
