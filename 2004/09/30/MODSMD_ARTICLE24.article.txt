## HOME, SWEET HOME Maples Pavilion renovation nears completion 
### JESSICA PETERS MANAGING EDITOR 
From the outside, Roscoe Maples Pavilion looks like any
average construction zone, a mass of concrete surrounded
by dirt and a cyclone fence.
But on the inside. Maples is already looking like a sports
lover's dream.
If you can ignore the stacks of boxes and seats and boards,
you can almost picture junior point guard Chris Hernandez
running the floor for the Cardinal. If you can set aside the
clanging sounds of the contractors hard at work, you can
nearly hear the boom of the crowd, the energy of the Sixth
Man Club and the blare of horns from the Band.
And if you take a quick glance around at the renovation's
progress, you'll see all you need to know â€” you'll certainly
be watching another basketball and volleyball season being
successfully played out at the Pavilion this year.
The renovation, which was started in February under

the constraint of a 30 million dollar budget, is now sched
uled to be finished Dec. 1, a month earlier than originally
projected. The first game to take place in the refurbished
facility will be the Stanford women's basketball contest
against Pepperdine.
According to Maple Project Manager Kellie Elliott, the
project was carried out with four goals in mind: improving fa
cilities for student-athletes, keeping costs within the limits of
the budget, maintaining the Pavilion's reputation as a "com
petitive atmosphere" and improving the amenities in place
to make fans more comfortable at events.
Every one of those goals has been met.
"This is one of the most successful projects we've ever un
dertaken," said Athletic Director Ted Leland, who added
that the department will not be in debt when the project is
completed.
While most reactions to the renovation have been posi
tive, some fans have raised concerns about the seating
scheme, which was altered when the lower level bleachers

behind the team benches were converted into padded stadi
um seats. Each bleacher seat was 18 inches wide, but the new
seats are 22" in width, which results in a net loss of 181 seats
in that area. Many season ticket holders were relocated to
spots one to three sections away from their normal seats, and
174 were even bumped to the upper-deck areas.
Overall, the capacity of Maples decreased from 7,391 to
an estimated 7,233. The approximation does not include the
fluctuating number of Sixth Man attendees.
Movement of season ticket holders was kept to a mini
mum, as the athletic department evaluated the holder's do
nations to any part of the university, the length of time that
they have held their tickets and their service to the university.
Leland pointed out that the system is unique, as at
least three other Pacific-10 Conference schools have
done renovations to their basketball facilities and re-

The Maples Pavilion renovation project, which made several improvements and dropped seated capacity by 158, will wrap up Dec. 1, one month ahead of time.
