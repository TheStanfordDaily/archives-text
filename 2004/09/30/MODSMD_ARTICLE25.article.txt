# Ultimate frisbee athletes in it for fun

### ALICE ANN SPURGIN 
Their A-teams are known as "Superfly" and "Bloodthirsty." They
have coaches who have recently competed at the world champi
onships. They are the men and women of Stanford Ultimate Frisbee.
Collegiate Ultimate teams across the country are known for their
quirky names, and the Stanford teams are no exception. In addition
to Superfly and Bloodthirsty, the women on the B-team — and the
top B-team in the nation at that — call themselves the "Wild Rum
pus,'' while B-team men, who went by "Bad Blood last year, change
their name annually.

The sport is based on a simple concept. With 14 players on the field,
teammates try to score by catching the Frisbee in their opponents' end
zone. However, this is made more challenging by the rule that the play
er carrying the frisbee is not allowed to run with it.
Only 12 players will be returning to Superfly this season, but three
of them will be out studying abroad in the fall quarter. This means
that there will be several spots open for this year's team.
"Don't be intimidated if you've never thrown a Frisbee before,"
said former Superfly member and current Wild Rumpus coach
Heather Armstrong. "Now is the time to learn, and there are all sorts
of awesome players and coaches at Stanford who want to teach you."
Despite the fact that the women's team graduated several strong
players last year, spirits remain high for this season.
"Our lack of seasoned veterans doesn't mean that we won't be
competitive," said senior Lauren Casey, one of this year's Superfly
co-captains. Her fellow co-captains are senior Enessa Janes and ju
nior Mary Lyn Stein.
Superfly coach Gwen Ambler, who graduated with the class of 2003
after playing on the team for four years, shares this optimism.
"The core group of returning veterans have all the skills they need
to take the team far," Ambler said.
Bloodthirsty faced a similar situation last year but still made it all
the way to the national semifinals. This year, said Bloodthirsty cap
tain Doug Allen, they hope to win it all.
Despite these teams' impressive records, they never forget that
club sports are all about having fun. These athletes get no scholar
ships and have to pay for their own uniforms, so every player on the
team is there purely for love of the sport.
"That's one of the great things about Ultimate," Armstrong said.
"Not only is it a challenging, competitive sport, but we have a ton of
fun, too."
One of the annual highlights for the men's team is the President's
Day weekend tournament in Hawaii. Team members sleep in tents
on the beach, wake up fora swim in the ocean, have fruit and smooth
ies for breakfast, and then spend the day playing Ultimate against top
players from across the nation.
After the tournament, they usually spend a week on the island re
laxing, surfing, and hiking.
"It's definitely the most fun trip I've ever taken, and probably ever
