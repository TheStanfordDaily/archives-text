While the West Coast may currently
lag behind the East Coast in squash, it
will only be a matter of time before the
Pacific side catches up. With the arrival
Mark Talbott, the new director of
Squash coaching the Stanford men's and
women's squash teams. Stanford has a
unique chance to level the playing field.
Stanford's Squash Club was found
ed in the summer of 1998 by Mark
Goldenson, a student at the time, and
has now grown to over 500 players in
the community.
"It's a testament to the success of the
program so far and its potential that
Mark left a National Championship
team at Yale [to come to] Stanford," se
nior captain of the women's team. Maisy
Samuelson said.
On July 1 .Talbott officially resigned
from the position as the women's head
coach at Yale; in the half a dozen years
he coached there, the team showed
marked improvement, going undefeat
ed in the 2003-04 season with a record
of 15-0.
When Talbott arrived at Yale in 1998,
the team was ranked sixth; in his final
season there, the former top-ranked
squash player in the world coached the
nation's top-ranked women's team,
leading Yale to its first undefeated sea

many recruits, as many squash players

man who had spent 13 years — from
1983 until 1995 —at the top of the

his long reign at the top of the charts,
the rest of Talbott's resume is equally
impressive.
Talbott was a part of the inaugural
class of the United States Squash Hall of
Fame in 2000. He was the World Profes
sional Squash Association's Player of
the Year eight times and also appeared
in numerous magazines, including two
showings in Sports Illustrated. Not only
was Talbott the Olympic Athlete of the
year on three occasions, he also cap
tained the first USA Team to compete in
the Pan Am Games in 1995.
"Mark's arrival is huge," Goldenson
commented. "He's a former world
champion, a national champion coach,
and the greatest American player ever.
It's like getting Michael Jordan to coach
your hoops team."
Although he was a part of a family
with a strong legacy at Yale, Talbott en
rolled at Trinity College after appearing
on the squash court as a junior then an
amateur. However, Talbott was not sat
isfied with college and soon left without
telling anyone of his whereabouts.
He traveled the world, and after a
long stint in South Africa, his squash
game improved greatly. Talbott became
