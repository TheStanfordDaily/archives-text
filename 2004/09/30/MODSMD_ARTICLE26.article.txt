### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the West Coast may currently
lag behind the East Coast in squash, it
will only be a matter of time before the
Pacific side catches up. With the arrival
Mark Talbott, the new director of
Squash coaching the Stanford men's and
women's squash teams. Stanford has a
unique chance to level the playing field.
Stanford's Squash Club was found
ed in the summer of 1998 by Mark
Goldenson, a student at the time, and
has now grown to over 500 players in
the community.
"It's a testament to the success of the
program so far and its potential that
Mark left a National Championship
team at Yale [to come to] Stanford," se
nior captain of the women's team. Maisy
Samuelson said.
On July 1 .Talbott officially resigned
from the position as the women's head
coach at Yale; in the half a dozen years
he coached there, the team showed
marked improvement, going undefeat
ed in the 2003-04 season with a record
of 15-0.
When Talbott arrived at Yale in 1998,
the team was ranked sixth; in his final
season there, the former top-ranked
squash player in the world coached the
nation's top-ranked women's team,
leading Yale to its first undefeated sea
son in 18 years and winning both the
Howe Cup National Championship and
an Ivy League Title.

in his time at Yale,Talbott attracted
many recruits, as many squash players
jumped at the chance to be trained by a
man who had spent 13 years — from
1983 until 1995 —at the top of the
world's squash rankings. In addition to
his long reign at the top of the charts,
the rest of Talbott's resume is equally
impressive.
Talbott was a part of the inaugural
class of the United States Squash Hall of
Fame in 2000. He was the World Profes
sional Squash Association's Player of
the Year eight times and also appeared
in numerous magazines, including two
showings in Sports Illustrated. Not only
was Talbott the Olympic Athlete of the
year on three occasions, he also cap
tained the first USA Team to compete in
the Pan Am Games in 1995.
"Mark's arrival is huge," Goldenson
commented. "He's a former world
champion, a national champion coach,
and the greatest American player ever.
It's like getting Michael Jordan to coach
your hoops team."
Although he was a part of a family
with a strong legacy at Yale, Talbott en
rolled at Trinity College after appearing
on the squash court as a junior then an
amateur. However, Talbott was not sat
isfied with college and soon left without
telling anyone of his whereabouts.
He traveled the world, and after a
long stint in South Africa, his squash
game improved greatly. Talbott became
more disciplined and dedicated; he
gained a deeper understanding of
the tactics of the game.
"Going overseas really helped,"
Talbott said. "I was exposed to [and
able to play with) a lot of the best
players in the world. I worked really
hard."
Upon his return to the United
States, Talbott made his break
through in the 1982-83 season. Dur
ing this span, Talbott appeared in all
17 ranking tournament finals and
lost only two of them.
He swept four Grand Slam events
in 1988-89 and even created the Tal
bott Squash Academy in Newport,
R.I. in 1991. This academy is now the
national training center of the
USSRA (United States Squash Rac
quets Association) and is considered
to be the best junior and adult train
ing center in the world.
"He is literally an icon in the
squash world," Samuelson said. "Ev
eryone is thrilled to be on the same
court as him."
Known for his sportsmanship and
positive manner, Talbott brings pa
tience, confidence and accuracy to
the game.
"He's also known for his sports
manship, calling his own faults and
complimenting his opponent,"
Goldenson said. "I think he'll be a
role model for the teams in how to
play smart and enjoy the game re
gardless of the outcome."
Talbott has also always demon
strated the importance he places on
family, citing his own as part of the
reason why he chose to relocate to
Palo Alto. Growing up, the Talbott
brothers were extremely tight-knit.

In his early days, Mark's brothers
would accompany him to many tour
naments and provide support and
advice.
Filling the void Mark left in
Yale's coaching staff is none other
than Mark's older brother, Dave,
someone who is all too familiar with
Yale's squash program. Having been
involved with the squash program at
Yale for over 16 years, Dave will
now coach the women's team in ad
dition to the men's team, at least for
the upcoming season.
Talbott arrives in Palo Alto along
with his wife, Michelle (an interna
tionally acclaimed cellist), and their
two children, Nicolas and Maya.
In addition to coaching the
squash teams, Talbott will manage
the new squash facility, complete
with six glass-backed courts, to be
opened in 2005 at the Arrillaga Fam
ily Recreation Center. Senior Chris
Fesenmaier, captain of the men's
team, thinks that the completion of
the center will "allow the team and
program to really take off."
"Mark has earned a reputation
for being dedicated to the develop
ment of squash, which is [important]
here on the west coast where squash
is less well known," Fesenmaier said.
"We anticipate that with his leader
ship and the support of the universi
ty, Stanford can help promote the
game and become the focus of
squash for the entire western U.S."
Women's tryouts are on Oct. 4
and 6 from 4-6 p.m.. and men's try
outs are on Oct. 5 and 7 from 4-6 p.m.
