# Men to face Princeton, NorCal foes
## Cardinal hope to stay No. 1 through weekend 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Sure, water polo is a West Coast sport. Cali
fornia thrives on the water sport. Only one of
Stanford's 23 men's water polo players (7-1,1-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) is not
originally from California. Some students, es
pecially those who have lived bounded by land,
aren't even aware that the sport exists until they
come to Stanford.
Therefore one would not be completely mis
taken to believe that left coast teams have a mild
advantage over their Atlantic competitors.
"West Coast teams have always been better
than East Coast teams," said junior driver
Thomas Hopkins. And occasionally, accord
ing to Hopkins, when a player from the west
goes to an East Coast school, he might just be
the reason that the school's program is able to
succeed.
It's not surprising then that nine of the top 10
teams in the nation, according to the National
Collegiate Top 20 poll, come from California,
with only No. 7 St. Francis College (13-2) mak
ing an appearance on behalf of the east. De
spite the Final Four requiring having two East
Coast teams, California still dominates the na
tional scene.
Newly crowned top-ranked Stanford has a
strong argument for being the top squad in the
nation, with only No. 2 Southern California (7-
1, 0-1 MPSF) challenging the team. Each
squad's only loss this season has come in match
es where they played each other, and the
schools have already flip-flopped rankings
twice in two weeks.
A game against an East Coast school would
therefore appear to be an easy battle, yet the
Cardinal aren't gong to take any risks, especial
ly considering their next game comes against
one of the best East Coast teams out there. No.

11 Princeton (10-1).
After taking Monday off, the Cardinal got
hack to practice at Avery Aquatic Center this
week to prepare for four games in three days.
First on their list are the Tigers, and the Cardi
nal aren't going to change their successful game
plans for Princeton. Stanford is approaching
the game as it would any other match, with
gelling as a team singled out as one of the most
crucial focus points.
"We are taking (the game) seriously," Hop
kins said. "We're trying to mold as a team, get
to know each other and play together. But we
will warm up the same, and play the same
strategies."
Those strategies will he put to work against
Collegiate Water Polo Player of the Week John
Stover, who scored three goals in a loss to St.
Francis during the Eastern College Athletic
Conference Tournament.
Fellow Tiger Zach Beckman, who hails from
California, may also give the Cardinal trouble,
proving that while East Coast teams may not
dominate the sport, they certainly do provide a
worthy challenge.
Once its Friday home game against Prince
ton is over, Stanford travels to Stockton, Calif,
to face stiff competition at the Northern Cali
fornia Tournament.
The Cardinal's first opponent at the tourna
ment is yet to he decided. As the second seed,
the Cardinal will wait for the results of the No.
19 Cal Baptist (4-7), No. 16 Pacific (2-5, 0-0
MPSF) game, but the determined squad should
get past the first round easily.
"We have momentum right now," said Hop
kins, who leads the team in scoring with 23
goals. "We came off a big win against USC and
then UOP. Our focus right now is keeping the
momentum going through the tournament."
The Cardinal continue to succeed by shut
ting out their competition and scoring big, as
they did in a 13-3 victory over Pacific on Sun
day. MPSF Player of the Week Greg Crum,
who follows Hopkins with 17 goals, led that at
tack with three goals.
The combined defensive effort of three Stan

ford goalkeepers aided the Cardinal in scoring
nine straight times. Eight different players
scored in Stockton, displaying the depth the
team brings to the Nor Cal tournament.
Of the 20 teams competing in the UOP-host
ed tournament this weekend, a few have al
ready caught Hopkin's eye. No. 4 UCLA (6-2,0-
0 MPSF), No. 5 UC-Irvine (7-3,0-0 MPSF) and
No. 3 California (8-1, 0-0 MPSF) already look
strong this season, as, of course, do the Trojans.
For there to he another exciting rematch be
tween the two top teams, Stanford will have to
wait and hope it gets to the final match, Sunday
at 5:30 p.m.
And the team is already looking ahead to
ward the national championship that eluded it
last year.
"If we win this tournament, it'll keep us in a
good spot for the at-large bid into the
NCAA's," Hopkins said.

gelling as a team singled out as one of the most
crucial focus points.
"We are taking (the game) seriously," Hop
kins said. "We're trying to mold as a team, get
to know each other and play together. But we
will warm up the same, and play the same
strategies."
Those strategies will he put to work against
Collegiate Water Polo Player of the Week John
Stover, who scored three goals in a loss to St.
Francis during the Eastern College Athletic
Conference Tournament.
Fellow Tiger Zach Beckman, who hails from
California, may also give the Cardinal trouble,
proving that while East Coast teams may not
dominate the sport, they certainly do provide a
worthy challenge.
Once its Friday home game against Prince
ton is over, Stanford travels to Stockton, Calif,
to face stiff competition at the Northern Cali
fornia Tournament.
The Cardinal's first opponent at the tourna
ment is yet to he decided. As the second seed,
the Cardinal will wait for the results of the No.
19 Cal Baptist (4-7), No. 16 Pacific (2-5, 0-0
MPSF) game, but the determined squad should
get past the first round easily.
"We have momentum right now," said Hop
kins, who leads the team in scoring with 23
goals. "We came off a big win against USC and
then UOP. Our focus right now is keeping the
momentum going through the tournament."
The Cardinal continue to succeed by shut
ting out their competition and scoring big, as
they did in a 13-3 victory over Pacific on Sun
day. MPSF Player of the Week Greg Crum,
who follows Hopkins with 17 goals, led that at
tack with three goals.
The combined defensive effort of three Stan

ford goalkeepers aided the Cardinal in scoring
nine straight times. Eight different players
scored in Stockton, displaying the depth the
team brings to the Nor Cal tournament.
Of the 20 teams competing in the UOP-host
ed tournament this weekend, a few have al
ready caught Hopkin's eye. No. 4 UCLA (6-2,0-
0 MPSF), No. 5 UC-Irvine (7-3,0-0 MPSF) and
No. 3 California (8-1, 0-0 MPSF) already look
strong this season, as, of course, do the Trojans.
For there to he another exciting rematch be
tween the two top teams, Stanford will have to
wait and hope it gets to the final match, Sunday
at 5:30 p.m.
And the team is already looking ahead to
ward the national championship that eluded it
last year.
"If we win this tournament, it'll keep us in a
good spot for the at-large bid into the
NCAA's," Hopkins said.

Sure, water polo is a West Coast sport. Cali
fornia thrives on the water sport. Only one of
Stanford's 23 men's water polo players (7-1,1-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) is not
originally from California. Some students, es
pecially those who have lived bounded by land,
aren't even aware that the sport exists until they
come to Stanford.
Therefore one would not be completely mis
taken to believe that left coast teams have a mild
advantage over their Atlantic competitors.
"West Coast teams have always been better
than East Coast teams," said junior driver
Thomas Hopkins. And occasionally, accord
ing to Hopkins, when a player from the west
goes to an East Coast school, he might just be
the reason that the school's program is able to
succeed.
It's not surprising then that nine of the top 10
teams in the nation, according to the National
Collegiate Top 20 poll, come from California,
with only No. 7 St. Francis College (13-2) mak
ing an appearance on behalf of the east. De
spite the Final Four requiring having two East
Coast teams, California still dominates the na
tional scene.
Newly crowned top-ranked Stanford has a
strong argument for being the top squad in the
nation, with only No. 2 Southern California (7-
1, 0-1 MPSF) challenging the team. Each
squad's only loss this season has come in match
es where they played each other, and the
schools have already flip-flopped rankings
twice in two weeks.
A game against an East Coast school would
therefore appear to be an easy battle, yet the
Cardinal aren't gong to take any risks, especial
ly considering their next game comes against
one of the best East Coast teams out there. No.

11 Princeton (10-1).
After taking Monday off, the Cardinal got
hack to practice at Avery Aquatic Center this
week to prepare for four games in three days.
First on their list are the Tigers, and the Cardi
nal aren't going to change their successful game
plans for Princeton. Stanford is approaching
the game as it would any other match, with
gelling as a team singled out as one of the most
crucial focus points.
