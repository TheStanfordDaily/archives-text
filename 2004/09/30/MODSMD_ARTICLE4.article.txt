# Students complain dorm furniture often damaged
## 
### DAVID HERBERT DESK EDITOR 
As the year begins and students pile into
dormitories across campus, many residents
will rest easy with new mattresses, though
others will not.
Under the Student Housing Asset Re
newal Program, University furnishings are
replaced every few years, though the life
cycle of each type of furniture varies, ac
cording to Imogen Hinds, manager of Un
dergraduate Housing.
That some students have returned to
campus to new furniture and others have not
has caused some students to question the
quality of the furniture Stanford provides.
For this fall, Florence Moore Hall, Stern
dorms Burbank. Larkin, Donner and Twain,
plus a number of Row Houses received new
mattresses. So far, the new bedding has re
ceived positive reviews.
"I like the mattresses a lot," said fresh
man Matt Canty. "Larkin kicks ass."
Despite this capital improvement, some
students are still moving into damaged
rooms. One such student is sophomore Ryan
Fletcher, who lives in a two-room quad in
Toyon Hall.
"When we woke up for class this morning,
my roommates and I discovered that the
doorknob of the door leading to our com
mon room had fallen off," Fletcher said yes
terday. "We were trapped in the bedroom
until we called our RA and had him let us
out."

Fletcher and his roommates submitted an
emergency fix-it request and maintenance
staff reattached the knob hours later. How
ever, he added, fix-it requests for his broken
desk drawers and his roommates' damaged
keyboard trays have fallen on deaf ears.
Other students have also had problems
with broken furnishings. Sophomore Radhi
ka Zopey moved into her Toyon triple to
find the brackets on the bunk bed's ladder
broken.
"We were all frustrated because my
roommate couldn't sleep in her bed and had
to sleep on the floor," Zopey said. "We kept
stepping on her."
According to Hinds, Undergraduate
Housing inspects rooms for damaged furni
ture before move-in, but their efforts are
never 100 percent effective.
"Sometimes students do find an item that
either we didn't notice or that hasn't been re
paired yet (usually due to the tight turns be
tween programs, such as the one day turn be
tween Sophomore College and the early
move-ins)," she said.
Damage issues aside, some students also
have problems with the furniture Stanford
provides, many arguing that the furnishings
are not always ideal for the rooms.
"It's clear that the people who designed
the furniture are not the same people that
designed the room," said sophomore Mohini
Rustagi, who lives in Castano. "When you
try to put two desks against one wall, there is
about a foot of useless space left."


Despite satisfaction about new mattresses in select dorms on campus, some students still complain
about broken furniture.
