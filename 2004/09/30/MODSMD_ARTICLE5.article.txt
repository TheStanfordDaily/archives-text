Seniors throughout campus are
already hearing a buzz, both good
and bad. about tonight's Senior Pub
Night, which organizers boast is now
better coordinated and predict will
enjoy larger turnout.
Senior class presidents are work
ing in conjunction with the Risk
Management Department, the Of
fice of Student Activities and Vaden
Health Center to ensure students a
safe and enjoyable Senior Pub Night,
said Victor Madrigal, director of Stu
dent and Young Alumni Outreach at
the Stanford Alumni Association.
The Marguerite shuttles will also
help to transport students to and
from the events for convenience and
safety purposes, he added.
Senior Class President Steve
Myrick added that the class presidents
have worked hard to notify pubs in ad
vance to ensure the venues will be
staffed to accommodate the seniors.
According to Madrigal, improved
publicity via e-mail will increase at
tendance at Senior Pub Night.
Despite the event's increased
popularity, some seniors are frustrat
ed that the event will exclude seniors
who are underage.
This year's first Senior Pub Night
will be held at Nola's, a local Palo
Alto bar and restaurant. Despite at
tempts to create an inclusive atmos
phere, however, seniors under 21 will
not be permitted into Nola's after 10
p.m. due to identification checks by
restaurant security, Myrick said.
In the past. Senior Pub Nights
have been held at locations such as
Old Pro, Gordon Biersch. BBC and
Blue Chalk.
"It sucks for seniors who are
under 21 and can't even get into this
event," said senior Jacqueline Dozier
said. But she added, "A lot of my
friends are excited about [Senior Pub
Night] and are definitely keeping
Thursday nights free."
Myrick believes that part of seniors'
excitement about Senior Pub Night is
due to the event's unique setting.
"It's a good way to get to know the
area nightlife and a great option for
seniors who have become tired of the
on-campus party scene after three
years." he said.
Some students, however, say that
they are turned off by the focus on al
cohol consumption.
"Drinking really isn't my thing, so
there really wouldn't be a reason for
me to go," senior Jacqueline Hoang
said. "I would rather spend time with
my friends doing other activities."
According to Myrick, the event is
meant to provide a casual and fun so
cial atmosphere for seniors. He
maintains that both non-drinkers
and drinkers are welcome.
