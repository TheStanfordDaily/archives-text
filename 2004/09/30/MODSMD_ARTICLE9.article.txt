man tix>k off all of his clothes in the store, poured
coffee over his head and then ran headfirst into
the window of the store.
He fell back and ran into the window fora sec
ond time, she said.
The man then left the convenience store
naked and walked to the library. He walked
down the stairs of the Love Library dome en
trance, when an off-duty officer tackled him by
the neck.
Four police officers, one off-duty, tried to
wrestle the man on the ground but were not able
to hold him down with their hands, Cavarlez said.
"He was fighting so hard, we had to taze him
three times," C avarlez, who gave the order to
taze the man, said.
Tazer guns, which have about 75,(XX) volts of
electricity, temporarily incapacitating the person
by causing muscles to lock up.
"He was sweating profusely," Cavarlez said.
The hot coffee that he poured on himself at
the convenience store made him slippery and
hard to tackle, Cavarlez said after the incident.
"As I started to go toward him. he charged
back away from me and took a swing at me," he
said.
Police initially suspected the man was on
drugs, but when he was taken to Mercy Hospital
fora complete toxicology exam, the police report
showed no illicit drugs in his body, Cavarlez said.
"I'm on race," the naked man said while lying
on the ground. "Class, gender. I'm a homo," he
added.
When one of the lieutenants asked him his
name, he said, "Heather Will." When asked
where he lived, he said, "I live here, San Diego
State."
"I le told us he smoked marijuana and some
other drugs. He consistently commented that he
was a homosexual," Cavarlez said.
English graduate student Jose Medrano was
reading right in front of the scene.
"He looked like he was out of it. Maybe he
wasn't on anything. Maybe he was just psyched
for something," he said.
