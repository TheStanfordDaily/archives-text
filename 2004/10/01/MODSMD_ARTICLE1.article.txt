# It's Been A Long Time
## Cardinal's last win over UW came in 1994 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Don't look now, hut Stanford is a two-touchdown
favorite heading into tomorrow's game against
Washington at Stanford Stadium.
Granted, Stanford is 2-1 and nearly upset top
ranked Southern California last weekend, while
Washington (0-3) is off to its worst start since 1969.
But the Huskies are still the Huskies. The same
Huskies who've beaten the Cardinal six times in a
row — including a 2001 win in Seattle that spoiled
Stanford's Bowl Championship Series hopes — and
has won 16 of the last 17 meetings between the
schools. Clearly, this is a team that loves to play Stan
ford, and the Cardinal know it.
"Washington comes in a better team than their
record indicates," head coach Buddy Teevens said.
"It's a very physical and aggressive football team."
Teevens now has a very good chance to do some
thing that predecessor Tyrone Willingham never
could: defeat Washington. The last man to coach
Stanford to a win over the Huskies was the legendary
Bill Walsh, who did so in 1994.
That's not the only reason Saturday's game is im
portant, though. It will almost assuredly turn out to
be the Cardinal's easiest Pacific-10 Conference con
test, and it is essentially a must-win for an up-and
coming team trying to fight its way to the magical six
win mark to become bowl eligible. A win over the
Huskies would place Stanford at 3-1, requiring just a
3-4 effort to close out the year to finish with a winning
record.
Washington, though, needs this game, too. Both
the Huskies and the Cardinal are 0-1 in conference
play, and head coach Keith Gilbertson and the
Huskies need to start somewhere if they are to avoid
the school's first losing season since 1976.
"You're not going to have smooth sailing all the
time, you're going to have some downs, and our guys
understand that," Gilbertson said. "You've got to
play out of it."
Unfortunately for the Huskies, they're facing a
stacked deck. Junior quarterback Casey Paus has
been benched in favor of a freshman, Carl Bonnell,
although Gilberston has not ruled out playing Paus if
Bonnell struggles.
And there's a good chance Bonnell is going to

Junior linebacker Kevin Schimmelmann and the rest of the Cardinal will look to gain a handle on something that
has eluded Stanford football teams 16 out of the last 17 times they have faced Washington: a win. The Huskies

struggle. Freshman quarterbacks rarely do well in the
Pac-10, no matter how talented they arc. Look at
Stanford's Trent Edwards and Arizona's Kris Heavn
er last year. While both are talented competitors
playing solid ball this year, they both struggled might
ily last year. Bonnell's off to a similar start in his
rookie campaign, having completed just 9-of-22 pass
es for l >() yards and an interception.
To make matters worse, the 1 luskies will be without
several key players. Receiver Charles Frederick is
"very, very doubtful," according to Gilberston, after
hurting his hamstring last week against Notre Dame.
Also, fullback Zach Tuiasosopo broke his leg in the
first quarter. As if that wasn't bad enough, receiver
Corey Williams broke his wrist on the very next play.
Frederick (14 catches), Williams (10) and Tuia
sosopo (5) rank 1-2-3 in receptions for the Huskies this
season. Sonny Shackleford, a sophomore who's played
only one game, is now the team's active leading re
ceiver, with three catches.
"We had built a lot around Corey and [Frederick]
and Zach, so it's going to be different," Gilbertson
said. "Obviously, it's ;i big concern, because our pass
ing game is anemic right now. We're hurting."
Paus and Bonnell threw fora combined 223 yards in
the Huskies' 38-3 loss to Notre Dame last weekend,
but they needed 44 pass attempts to do it. averaging
just 5.0 yards per pass attempt.
One positive to the Huskies, who rank last in the
Pac-10 in passing efficiency by a wide margin, is the
fact that Stanford ranks last in the Pac-10 in pass de
fense (243 yards per game).
The Huskies will also look to Kenny James for sig
nificant yardage. James has rushed for 80.3 yards per
game and has scored two touchdowns. However, his
longest run is just 15 yards and it's unclear how effec
tive he will be against a Stanford team that ranks first
in the Pac-10 in rush defense, allowing just 83.7 yards
per game.
Stanford may seek to follow Notre Dame's lead and

attack the Huskies through the air. Brady Quinn threw
four first-half touchdowns against them last week, and
Stanford's passing attack has proven potent this season.
Edwards is completing 57 percent of his passes and
averaging 222 yards per game this year, having thrown
seven touchdowns against just one interception. He is
a quarterback who thrives on having time to roll out
and look deep downfield, and Washington has had
trouble pressuring quarterbacks all season long. The
Huskies haven't recorded a sack in either of their last
two games. To make matters worse, the Huskies' sec
ondary has struggled, too.
"We were way out of position back there," Gilber
ston said of the defensive backfield against Notre
Dame. "We did some undisciplined things back there.
Our corners didn't play as well as we hoped or as well
as they're capable of playing."
The Huskies rank last in the Pac-1() in pass defense
efficiency. Even so, they are allowing just 171 passing
yards per game — probably because they're giving up
235.7 rushing yards per contest, the second-worst mark
in the Pac-10.
Stanford's J R. Lemon, who's averaging 5.8 yards
per carry, will try to take advantage, as will Kenneth
Tolon, who's averaging 3.9 yards per carry and has a
team-leading two rushing touchdowns.
Clearly, the Huskies aren't very good on paper. But
Teevens knows how important this game is, and after
two tough seasons, the Cardinal knows better than to
underestimate any foe, no matter how woeful they
might seem.
"Our team's maturity is such that we realize we
have to play our best football each week to have an op
portunity to have success," Teevens said. "We empha
size the balance in the conference and realize that
prior records don't mean much on game day."
They will, however, mean quite a bit after the con
clusion of tomorrow's contest.
Kickoff will be at 2 p.m. tomorrow at Stanford
Stadium.
