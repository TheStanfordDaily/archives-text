# It's Been A Long Time
## Cardinal's last win over UW came in 1994

Don't look now, hut Stanford is a two-touchdown
favorite heading into tomorrow's game against
Washington at Stanford Stadium.
Granted, Stanford is 2-1 and nearly upset top
ranked Southern California last weekend, while
Washington (0-3) is off to its worst start since 1969.
But the Huskies are still the Huskies. The same
Huskies who've beaten the Cardinal six times in a
row — including a 2001 win in Seattle that spoiled
Stanford's Bowl Championship Series hopes — and
has won 16 of the last 17 meetings between the
schools. Clearly, this is a team that loves to play Stan
ford, and the Cardinal know it.
"Washington comes in a better team than their
record indicates," head coach Buddy Teevens said.
"It's a very physical and aggressive football team."
Teevens now has a very good chance to do some
thing that predecessor Tyrone Willingham never
could: defeat Washington. The last man to coach
Stanford to a win over the Huskies was the legendary
Bill Walsh, who did so in 1994.
That's not the only reason Saturday's game is im
portant, though. It will almost assuredly turn out to
be the Cardinal's easiest Pacific-10 Conference con
test, and it is essentially a must-win for an up-and
coming team trying to fight its way to the magical six
win mark to become bowl eligible. A win over the
Huskies would place Stanford at 3-1, requiring just a
3-4 effort to close out the year to finish with a winning
record.
Washington, though, needs this game, too. Both
the Huskies and the Cardinal are 0-1 in conference
play, and head coach Keith Gilbertson and the
Huskies need to start somewhere if they are to avoid
the school's first losing season since 1976.
"You're not going to have smooth sailing all the
time, you're going to have some downs, and our guys
understand that," Gilbertson said. "You've got to
play out of it."
Unfortunately for the Huskies, they're facing a
stacked deck. Junior quarterback Casey Paus has
been benched in favor of a freshman, Carl Bonnell,
although Gilberston has not ruled out playing Paus if
Bonnell struggles.
And there's a good chance Bonnell is going to

Junior linebacker Kevin Schimmelmann and the rest of the Cardinal will look to gain a handle on something that
has eluded Stanford football teams 16 out of the last 17 times they have faced Washington: a win. The Huskies
enter tomorrow's game at Stanford Stadium 0-3.
