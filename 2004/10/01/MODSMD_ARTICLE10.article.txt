# Our democratic experiment is waning, says Cornel West
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
Princeton Prof. Cornel West gave an impassioned
talk last night to a crowded Memorial Auditorium on
the state of democracy in America. It came hard on the
heels of the first presidential debate, which was broad
cast live in the auditorium just before his speech began.
The event was sponsored by Stanford's Aurora
Forum, which invites various speakers to campus to
discuss democratic ideals.
West wove commentary about historical philoso
phers like Socrates, Hegel. Dante and Melville into a
contemporary political message.
Aurora Forum Director Mark Gonnerman, who in
troduced West as a "deep-sea diver in the realm of the
intellect," emphasized West's connection to the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
"Like King, West calls upon us to organize and mo
bilize to bring people-pressure to bear on the status
quo and resist the improper use of state power,"
Gonnerman said. "He is a radical Christian and a radi
cal Democrat," he added, noting that West was giving
his speech from the same stage where King spoke out
against the Vietnam War in 1967.
West mixed humorous and serious comments in his
references to the presidential debate.
"Maybe I'll just keep my distance from the debate
tonight — in the interest of high quality," he quipped,
drawing laughter and applause from the crowd.

West spoke about Socrates and the tradition of So
cratic debate, holding up the Dialogues as a model for
public discourse.
"I didn't see the [presidential! debate myself, but my
hunch is that it fell short of Socratic questioning," he said.
"I can imagine what happens when a democracy be
gins to lose the art of dialogue. Media salesmanship,
more and more, moves to the center, with packaged en
tities, spinsters and pollsters."
Without explicitly mentioned President George W.
Bush or his policies. West's discussed the current polit
ical situation in the United States.
"Our democratic experiment is waning, weaken
ing," he said. "The Socratic tradition, so indispensable,
is waning."
West talked about the still-fresh shock of the Sept.
11 attacks but warned against letting outrage degener
ate into extremism.
"You can't sustain a democratic project by reducing
public discourse about one of its most explosive issues
to revenge and demonizing the Other."
"We're going to sustain our discourse at the level of
justice," West said, making reference to King as well as
Mamie Till Mobley, whose son was lynched by racists
in 1955. West invoked Mobley as a model of bravery
and forbearance for sustaining a high level of intellec
tual integrity in the face of tremendous suffering and
personal loss.

Students gathered in Roble lounge last night to watch the first presidential debate. While the event was sponsored
by the ASSU and Stanford in Government, a non-partisan group, the audience was largely pro-Kerry.
West also criticized what he per
ceives as shallow American opti
mism surrounding the war on ter
ror, and he warned against the "con
stitution of the American empire
abroad."
West invoked the historical
plight of African Americans and
Native Americans and urged the au
dience to remember the injustice
and imperialism at the roots of the
well-intentioned "great American
democratic experiment."
"These realities are denied,
avoided, evaded by a mainstream
American civilization that believes
that it's always on the right track,
exemplifying morality at its highest
level," West said. "This is a Disney
World sensibility, of not having to
deal with the darkness and the un
derside of the democratic experi
ment. American terrorism is quite
relevant these days in the 'war
against terrorism.'"
"Dogma, parochialism and
provincialism constitute our false
security, our false illusions," he said.
"Justice? Yes. Revenge? No!
'No' to demonization," West said,
amid shouts, cheers and ovations
from the crowd.
In his concluding remarks. West
advocated "a blues sensibility," call
ing for and end to American
naivete, challenging the country to
embrace difficult challenges.
"This is what I call the black in
vention of the blues: the tragic
comic hope that is different from
mainstream American optimism,"
he said.
"The days of America being on
automatic pilot regarding its opti
mistic future are over. In some
ways, for some people, they've al
ways been over," he said.
"As the American democratic
experiment has grown old. the chal
lenge is for that experiment to real
ly grow up," he said, as he received
a standing ovation from the crowd.

the state of democracy in America. It came hard on the
heels of the first presidential debate, which was broad
cast live in the auditorium just before his speech began.
The event was sponsored by Stanford's Aurora
Forum, which invites various speakers to campus to
discuss democratic ideals.
West wove commentary about historical philoso
phers like Socrates, Hegel. Dante and Melville into a
contemporary political message.
Aurora Forum Director Mark Gonnerman, who in
troduced West as a "deep-sea diver in the realm of the
intellect," emphasized West's connection to the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
"Like King, West calls upon us to organize and mo
bilize to bring people-pressure to bear on the status
quo and resist the improper use of state power,"
Gonnerman said. "He is a radical Christian and a radi
cal Democrat," he added, noting that West was giving
his speech from the same stage where King spoke out
against the Vietnam War in 1967.
West mixed humorous and serious comments in his
references to the presidential debate.
"Maybe I'll just keep my distance from the debate
tonight — in the interest of high quality," he quipped,
drawing laughter and applause from the crowd.

West spoke about Socrates and the tradition of So
cratic debate, holding up the Dialogues as a model for
public discourse.
"I didn't see the [presidential! debate myself, but my
hunch is that it fell short of Socratic questioning," he said.
"I can imagine what happens when a democracy be
gins to lose the art of dialogue. Media salesmanship,
more and more, moves to the center, with packaged en
tities, spinsters and pollsters."
Without explicitly mentioned President George W.
Bush or his policies. West's discussed the current polit
ical situation in the United States.
"Our democratic experiment is waning, weaken
ing," he said. "The Socratic tradition, so indispensable,
is waning."
West talked about the still-fresh shock of the Sept.
11 attacks but warned against letting outrage degener
ate into extremism.
"You can't sustain a democratic project by reducing
public discourse about one of its most explosive issues
to revenge and demonizing the Other."
"We're going to sustain our discourse at the level of
justice," West said, making reference to King as well as
Mamie Till Mobley, whose son was lynched by racists
in 1955. West invoked Mobley as a model of bravery
and forbearance for sustaining a high level of intellec
tual integrity in the face of tremendous suffering and
personal loss.

Students gathered in Roble lounge last night to watch the first presidential debate. While the event was sponsored
by the ASSU and Stanford in Government, a non-partisan group, the audience was largely pro-Kerry.
West also criticized what he per
ceives as shallow American opti
mism surrounding the war on ter
ror, and he warned against the "con
stitution of the American empire
abroad."
West invoked the historical
plight of African Americans and
Native Americans and urged the au
dience to remember the injustice
and imperialism at the roots of the
well-intentioned "great American
democratic experiment."
"These realities are denied,
avoided, evaded by a mainstream
American civilization that believes
that it's always on the right track,
exemplifying morality at its highest
level," West said. "This is a Disney
World sensibility, of not having to
deal with the darkness and the un
derside of the democratic experi
ment. American terrorism is quite
relevant these days in the 'war
against terrorism.'"
"Dogma, parochialism and
provincialism constitute our false
security, our false illusions," he said.
"Justice? Yes. Revenge? No!
'No' to demonization," West said,
amid shouts, cheers and ovations
from the crowd.
In his concluding remarks. West
advocated "a blues sensibility," call
ing for and end to American
naivete, challenging the country to
embrace difficult challenges.
"This is what I call the black in
vention of the blues: the tragic
comic hope that is different from
mainstream American optimism,"
he said.
"The days of America being on
automatic pilot regarding its opti
mistic future are over. In some
ways, for some people, they've al
ways been over," he said.
"As the American democratic
experiment has grown old. the chal
lenge is for that experiment to real
ly grow up," he said, as he received
a standing ovation from the crowd.
