# Our democratic experiment is waning, says Cornel West

### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
Princeton Prof. Cornel West gave an impassioned
talk last night to a crowded Memorial Auditorium on
the state of democracy in America. It came hard on the
heels of the first presidential debate, which was broad
cast live in the auditorium just before his speech began.
The event was sponsored by Stanford's Aurora
Forum, which invites various speakers to campus to
discuss democratic ideals.
West wove commentary about historical philoso
phers like Socrates, Hegel. Dante and Melville into a
contemporary political message.
Aurora Forum Director Mark Gonnerman, who in
troduced West as a "deep-sea diver in the realm of the
intellect," emphasized West's connection to the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
"Like King, West calls upon us to organize and mo
bilize to bring people-pressure to bear on the status
quo and resist the improper use of state power,"
Gonnerman said. "He is a radical Christian and a radi
cal Democrat," he added, noting that West was giving
his speech from the same stage where King spoke out
against the Vietnam War in 1967.
West mixed humorous and serious comments in his
references to the presidential debate.
"Maybe I'll just keep my distance from the debate
tonight â€” in the interest of high quality," he quipped,
drawing laughter and applause from the crowd.

West spoke about Socrates and the tradition of So
cratic debate, holding up the Dialogues as a model for
public discourse.
"I didn't see the [presidential! debate myself, but my
hunch is that it fell short of Socratic questioning," he said.
"I can imagine what happens when a democracy be
gins to lose the art of dialogue. Media salesmanship,
more and more, moves to the center, with packaged en
tities, spinsters and pollsters."
Without explicitly mentioned President George W.
Bush or his policies. West's discussed the current polit
ical situation in the United States.
"Our democratic experiment is waning, weaken
ing," he said. "The Socratic tradition, so indispensable,
is waning."
West talked about the still-fresh shock of the Sept.
11 attacks but warned against letting outrage degener
ate into extremism.
"You can't sustain a democratic project by reducing
public discourse about one of its most explosive issues
to revenge and demonizing the Other."
"We're going to sustain our discourse at the level of
justice," West said, making reference to King as well as
Mamie Till Mobley, whose son was lynched by racists
in 1955. West invoked Mobley as a model of bravery
and forbearance for sustaining a high level of intellec
tual integrity in the face of tremendous suffering and
personal loss.

Students gathered in Roble lounge last night to watch the first presidential debate. While the event was sponsored
by the ASSU and Stanford in Government, a non-partisan group, the audience was largely pro-Kerry.
