# Lawsuits; loss of SUNet IDs for file sharing
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY DESK EDITOR 
The Recording Industry Association
of America announced yesterday that it
has filed 762 lawsuits against illegal file
sharers around the nation. Thirty-two of
them are members of networks at 26 dif
ferent universities, including Stanford.
Unrelated to the actions taken by the
music industry, the University has
cracked down on file swapping.
Under Stanford's computer usage
policy, several students have had their
SUNet IDs disabled for sharing files on
the school's computer network.
The loss of a SUNet ID can severely
hinder a student's ability to fulfill his or
her academic requirements — such as
registering for classes and enrolling in
Course Work — and using Webmail.
The purpose of this procedure is to pro
tect the University from liability for
copyright infringement violations.
Yesterday's filing is the second made
against a Stanford network user. Earlier
in 2(X)4. another network user was al
leged to have unlawfully shared or
downloaded 11 songs: the individual set
tled out of court by paying a fine. The
University does not publicly release the
names of those who are sued.
When the RIAA discovered that
someone had been illegally sharing files
on the Internet, it notified Stanford of its
intention to file a lawsuit. Between the
time when that complaint was made a
few weeks ago and yesterday, when the
lawsuit was filed. Stanford took action
of its own.
"Even before we received any sub
poena from the RIAA, the Legal Office
decided that the best way to handle it
was to try to identify the Stanford user as
quickly as we could, and to give that user
appropriate notice," said Senior Univer
sity Counsel Lauren Schoenthaler.
Litigation is one method, under the
1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act,

used by copyright owners to fight piracy.
Another important tactic is to enforce
the Safe Harbor Provisions of the
DMCA, which requires that Stanford ei
ther terminate copyright infringers from
its network or be held responsible for files
that are illegally shared on the network.
Often, both options are used in concert —
one targets the network provider and one
targets the individual user.
"Safe Harbor"
The disabling of SUNet IDs is part of
an aggressive strategy, which has been in
effect for under a year, to protect the
University from fines of up to $150,000
for every file that is illegally download
ed on its network.
"We never look for file sharers our
selves," said C.J. Hafner. the Universi
ty's assistant computer security officer.
Rather, she said, the University re
ceives complaints against students from
what many call "digital bounty hunters"
— companies working for recording or
movie studios who monitor peer-to-peer
file sharing networks for illegal activity.
On average, she estimates that she re
ceives five DMCA complaints per day.
The University uses a"three strikes"
approach to deal with piracy, beginning
with a request to stop file sharing and
ending with the revocation of the user's
SUNet ID.
After the first strike. Hafner sends a
letter to the user telling them to stop
downloading illegally and to remove the
offending files.
On the second occasion, the user's
Internet is disabled and, for students,
their residence dean is notified.
Hafner said that the vast majority of
students who receive two strikes choose
to cease all illegal activities. However, in
the event of a third complaint, the Uni
versity terminates the user's SUNet ID
account to prevent him from using pub
lic computers to unlawfully share files.

Back to the "Dark Ages"
Hafner. assistant computer security
officer, reported that the first incidence
of a student losing his SUNet ID oc
curred during 2003-2004 academic year.
She said that "several" students had
already lost their IDs, with several more
in the "queue" to have their privileges
revoked.
When students lose their SUNet IDs,
the process can be extremely traumatic
for both them and their families.
"It's like being in the dark ages," said
Acting Information Security Officer
Tina Darmohray. "We've had parents
on the other end of the phone who were
crying. It's a nightmare."
"Some folks are quite angry about the
situation, some of them are really scared,
and some are just like. Oh my God. what
next? Help me,"' Darmohray said.
However, she noted that the revoca
tion of the SUNet ID is not a punish
ment — it is done to protect the Univer
sity from getting sued. The process for
revocation is "completely separate"
from any action the Office of Judicial
Affairs takes against the student. Stu
dents can be charged with a violation of
the Fundamental Standard if they accu
mulate three violations.
The University is currently trying to
make the effects of losing the SUNet ID
less severe by offering, in some cases, a
way for the user to access Stanford in
franet to register for classes without
being able to use the outside Internet
from the network.
Students unaware of consequences
Although on Sept. 13. Provost John
Etchemendy released a letter to the
Stanford community warning about the
disabling of SUNet IDs if anyone ac
crues three violations, and also about
students' liabilities to direct litigation,
many students are unaware of the po

tential consequences for illegal file
sharing.
One sophomore, who asked to re
main anonymous, said that neither he
nor his roommates were aware that it
was possible to have his SUNet ID taken
away. He has never received a DMCA
complaint, nor, he says, does he expect
to.
"I turned uploading off on my com
puter so people can't take my music off.
I don't think they can track you if you're
downloading music. Or, I just hook up
to my friends' computers and steal the
music they have already stolen."
He currently uses the Lime Wire
peer-to-peer program to download files
and has accumulated over 1,200 files il
legally over the course of about two
years.
Another sophomore, who also asked
to remain anonymous, said that he would
continue downloading music using a
peer-to-peer network even as he ac
knowledged the risk that he could receive
DMCA complaints or even a lawsuit.
"It's always a risk, I guess," he said.
"I think of it like safe sex: There's al
ways a risk, but you do what you do to
minimize it."
A prcfcrcncc for litigation?
Schoenthaler worries that attitudes
in the recording industry are shifting to
ward a preference for lawsuits against
individual network users rather letting
Internet service providers handle the
problem internally.
The Motion Picture Association of
America does not currently use litiga
tion as a tool to fight piracy, according to
Matthew Grossmand of digital strategy
and corporate communications.
Jonathon Lamy. a spokesperson for
the RIAA, said over the phone that his
organization relies on both filing com
plaints with universities and filing law
suits against individuals.
"Generally speaking, these are
parallel enforcement mechanisms,
and we continue to utilize both
tools," he said. "We continue to
send out thousands of cease and de
sist notices to University networks.
For more egregious examples of
piracy, we might decide that a law
suit is warranted."
"My concern is that they are no
longer favoring the DMCA pro
cess," Schoenthaler said. "It's my

Univ. counsel would
prefer education

hunch that they're choosing to go
straight to litigation." She added that
she feels that lawsuits might not he
the most effective means of changing
the minds of illegal file-sharers.
"My personal preference is
strong education campaigns," she
said. i think if you put the money
into advertising you might reach a
broader audience than targeting the
specific folks who are on the other
end of a lawsuit."

tect the University from liability for
copyright infringement violations.
Yesterday's filing is the second made
against a Stanford network user. Earlier
in 2(X)4. another network user was al
leged to have unlawfully shared or
downloaded 11 songs: the individual set
tled out of court by paying a fine. The
University does not publicly release the
names of those who are sued.
When the RIAA discovered that
someone had been illegally sharing files
on the Internet, it notified Stanford of its
intention to file a lawsuit. Between the
time when that complaint was made a
few weeks ago and yesterday, when the
lawsuit was filed. Stanford took action
of its own.
"Even before we received any sub
poena from the RIAA, the Legal Office
decided that the best way to handle it
was to try to identify the Stanford user as
quickly as we could, and to give that user
appropriate notice," said Senior Univer
sity Counsel Lauren Schoenthaler.
Litigation is one method, under the
1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act,

used by copyright owners to fight piracy.
Another important tactic is to enforce
the Safe Harbor Provisions of the
DMCA, which requires that Stanford ei
ther terminate copyright infringers from
its network or be held responsible for files
that are illegally shared on the network.
Often, both options are used in concert —
one targets the network provider and one
targets the individual user.
"Safe Harbor"
The disabling of SUNet IDs is part of
an aggressive strategy, which has been in
effect for under a year, to protect the
University from fines of up to $150,000
for every file that is illegally download
ed on its network.
"We never look for file sharers our
selves," said C.J. Hafner. the Universi
ty's assistant computer security officer.
Rather, she said, the University re
ceives complaints against students from
what many call "digital bounty hunters"
— companies working for recording or
movie studios who monitor peer-to-peer
file sharing networks for illegal activity.
On average, she estimates that she re
ceives five DMCA complaints per day.
The University uses a"three strikes"
approach to deal with piracy, beginning
with a request to stop file sharing and
ending with the revocation of the user's
SUNet ID.
After the first strike. Hafner sends a
letter to the user telling them to stop
downloading illegally and to remove the
offending files.
On the second occasion, the user's
Internet is disabled and, for students,
their residence dean is notified.
Hafner said that the vast majority of
students who receive two strikes choose
to cease all illegal activities. However, in
the event of a third complaint, the Uni
versity terminates the user's SUNet ID
account to prevent him from using pub
lic computers to unlawfully share files.

Back to the "Dark Ages"
Hafner. assistant computer security
officer, reported that the first incidence
of a student losing his SUNet ID oc
curred during 2003-2004 academic year.
She said that "several" students had
already lost their IDs, with several more
in the "queue" to have their privileges
revoked.
When students lose their SUNet IDs,
the process can be extremely traumatic
for both them and their families.
"It's like being in the dark ages," said
Acting Information Security Officer
Tina Darmohray. "We've had parents
on the other end of the phone who were
crying. It's a nightmare."
"Some folks are quite angry about the
situation, some of them are really scared,
and some are just like. Oh my God. what
next? Help me,"' Darmohray said.
However, she noted that the revoca
tion of the SUNet ID is not a punish
ment — it is done to protect the Univer
sity from getting sued. The process for
revocation is "completely separate"
from any action the Office of Judicial
Affairs takes against the student. Stu
dents can be charged with a violation of
the Fundamental Standard if they accu
mulate three violations.
The University is currently trying to
make the effects of losing the SUNet ID
less severe by offering, in some cases, a
way for the user to access Stanford in
franet to register for classes without
being able to use the outside Internet
from the network.
Students unaware of consequences
Although on Sept. 13. Provost John
Etchemendy released a letter to the
Stanford community warning about the
disabling of SUNet IDs if anyone ac
crues three violations, and also about
students' liabilities to direct litigation,
many students are unaware of the po

tential consequences for illegal file
sharing.
One sophomore, who asked to re
main anonymous, said that neither he
nor his roommates were aware that it
was possible to have his SUNet ID taken
away. He has never received a DMCA
complaint, nor, he says, does he expect
to.
"I turned uploading off on my com
puter so people can't take my music off.
I don't think they can track you if you're
downloading music. Or, I just hook up
to my friends' computers and steal the
music they have already stolen."
He currently uses the Lime Wire
peer-to-peer program to download files
and has accumulated over 1,200 files il
legally over the course of about two
years.
Another sophomore, who also asked
to remain anonymous, said that he would
continue downloading music using a
peer-to-peer network even as he ac
knowledged the risk that he could receive
DMCA complaints or even a lawsuit.
"It's always a risk, I guess," he said.
"I think of it like safe sex: There's al
ways a risk, but you do what you do to
minimize it."
A prcfcrcncc for litigation?
Schoenthaler worries that attitudes
in the recording industry are shifting to
ward a preference for lawsuits against
individual network users rather letting
Internet service providers handle the
problem internally.
The Motion Picture Association of
America does not currently use litiga
tion as a tool to fight piracy, according to
Matthew Grossmand of digital strategy
and corporate communications.
Jonathon Lamy. a spokesperson for
the RIAA, said over the phone that his
organization relies on both filing com
plaints with universities and filing law
suits against individuals.
"Generally speaking, these are
parallel enforcement mechanisms,
and we continue to utilize both
tools," he said. "We continue to
send out thousands of cease and de
sist notices to University networks.
For more egregious examples of
piracy, we might decide that a law
suit is warranted."
"My concern is that they are no
longer favoring the DMCA pro
cess," Schoenthaler said. "It's my

Univ. counsel would
prefer education

hunch that they're choosing to go
straight to litigation." She added that
she feels that lawsuits might not he
the most effective means of changing
the minds of illegal file-sharers.
"My personal preference is
strong education campaigns," she
said. i think if you put the money
into advertising you might reach a
broader audience than targeting the
specific folks who are on the other
end of a lawsuit."
The Recording Industry Association
of America announced yesterday that it
has filed 762 lawsuits against illegal file
sharers around the nation. Thirty-two of
them are members of networks at 26 dif
ferent universities, including Stanford.
Unrelated to the actions taken by the
music industry, the University has
cracked down on file swapping.
Under Stanford's computer usage
policy, several students have had their
SUNet IDs disabled for sharing files on
the school's computer network.
The loss of a SUNet ID can severely
hinder a student's ability to fulfill his or
her academic requirements — such as
registering for classes and enrolling in
Course Work — and using Webmail.
