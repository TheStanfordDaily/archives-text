1969 — On October 1, the Daily ran a story on the controversy of the department head
overriding a professor and subsequently changing student grades. Below is an excerpt.
"A former drama instructor has voiced strong complaints against the attempted
change of three of his final grades by his department chairman last spring.
The instructor. Michel Langinieux, has charged that Michael Barry, chairman of the
department of speech and drama, changed three grades of F to B's in the one-unit move
ment course. Speech and Drama 265 C, without Langinieux's knowledge or permission.
(Langinieux makes this charge in the letters section, p. 2 in today's Daily.)
Barry told the Daily last night that he 'accept responsibility . as chairman of the de
partment. for the action.' He had stated earlier that 'since University statues say that no
one has the right to change the grades' given by an instructor, 'the grades for all three
students.
All parties asked that the students involved remain anonymous.
Barry stated yesterday, that 'All of this is over now. Everything has been resolved satis
factorily. The grades are changed back. Why then is Mr. Langinieux raising the issue now?"'
1996 — On October 7, the Daily ran a story about vice-presidential candidate Jack Kemp
coming to Menlo Park. Below is an excerpt.
"Jack Kemp, the GOP nominee for vice president, visited Silicon Valley yesterday to
accept the endorsement of 220 computer industry executives in Mountain View and tour
a high school in Menlo Park.
Speaking to a small crowd of professionals at Netscape Communications Corp.. an In
ternet software company, he promised the crowd a more business-friendly environment
in a Dole-Kemp administration.
'We know that this country can compete with any nation in the world if we stop the
type of regulations, litigations, litigation and taxation that makes America less competi
tive and is driving American jobs offshore.' the former congressman and housing secre
tary said.
Kemp also spoke at the James Flood Science and Technology Magnet School in Menlo
Park. Kemp was greeted at the school by a group of 75 Clinton-Gore supporters including
a continent of 20 Stanford Democrats led by junior Dave Thomas, chair of the group."
