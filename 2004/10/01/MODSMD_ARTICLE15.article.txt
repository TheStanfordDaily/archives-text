# Landlines lose to cell phones
## Students ditch their 5-digit numbers 
### DEVON MAYLIE DESK EDITOR 
The cell phone is a versatile tool. It can
take pictures, check e-mail, list news head
lines, serve as a portable IM unit and, of
course, make phone calls. With all the new
mobile technology, some students are find
ing traditional landline phones an unneces
sary expense.
The most recent data from the Yankee
Group, a research and consulting firm, show
that about 14 percent of cell phone users be
tween the ages of 18 and 24 have dropped
their landlines and rely on cell phones as
their source of communication.
The nationwide trend among students
and young adults to drop landlines is also
being witnessed on the Stanford campus.
Information Technology Systems and
Services, the University's not-for-profit net
work and telecommunications provider, is
trying to reverse decreasing landline use and
cover growing infrastructure costs. Among
ITSS's efforts is a partnership with AT&T
wireless and a proposal fora telecommuni
cation fee that would be charged to everyone
in on-campus housing.
Use of room phones slowly declining
ITSS Technical Manager Bert Stubbs es
timates that out of the approximately 6,200
rooms on campus. 2,000 rooms did not have
a landline last year.
"There is a decided shift to cell phones,"
Stubbs said, adding that the trend has been
gradual.
Nancy Ansaldo with ITSS marketing ser
vices notes that the number of people who
have subscribed fora landline as of late last
week was similar to the number during the
same time period last year.
"From the beginning of the subscription
period to present we've processed 738 voice
orders," Ansaldo said earlier this week.
"Presently, we have a total of 1,918 active
student voice lines. These numbers are very
close to last year's subscriptions for the same
time frame."
However, many students who are transi
tioning to cell phone use alone argue that
landlines are not worth the cost.
"Cell phone reception is better now than
when I was a freshman," said senior Matt
Henick. "It's the future. Live for tomorrow."
Senior Chris Gaines, who had a landline
freshman year but now only uses his cell
phone, pointed to value and portability as
the main reasons to go wireless.
"I have free long-distance and nights and
weekends," Gaines said. "I can take it with
me, I am always accessible and a cell phone is
less bulky and I can put it in my pocket."
"It makes me feel like a man," he added.
Traditionally fees coming from landline
use cover the costs of providing telephone
service and some of the costs associated with
the network infrastructure, said Ethan Rik
leen, Residential Computing Network and
Systems Administrator. As fewer students
sign up for landlines. ITSS loses revenue, but
infrastructure costs are never-ending be
cause cables continually need to be upgraded
and expanded.

New fees cover costs of landline service
"As fewer and fewer people get phone
service (land lines) from ITSS, they collect
less and less money to cover the network in
frastructure costs," Rikleen wrote in an e
mail. "The costs are the same, so they've
started collecting some of it via the 'in-room
network connection fee.' That's the big part
of why the in-room fee went up this year. "
Rikleen said that 60 percent of the in
room fee goes to Networking Systems at
ITSS, which manages the residential network
in partnership with residential computing.
ITSS is making an effort to preserve land
line use on campus. Nancy Ware, director of
business planning and communication at
ITSS, said landlines are the most reliable way
to dial 911 in an emergency. The location of
a caller on a cell phone cannot be tracked,
whereas a landline caller can be traced.
"Folks still believe landlines will be here,"
Ware said. "They have higher reliability and
landline prices are decreasing. Cell phones
are a reality, but there are needs that will
continue for some time related to landlines."
Rikleen also said that, with landlines, stu
dents can buzz friends into their dorm from
their room via the Door King system. Many
students also bring their cell phones from
home, carrying long-distance area codes,
creating an additional cost for students and
the University to absorb.
ITSS and Residential Computing are
proposing a telecommunication fee to help
recover from losses that may further result
from a landline subscription decrease. The
fee would be applied to all students living in
campus residences and cover in-room inter
net and telephone connections.
Rikleen says that if the proposal is accept
ed, then the fee could be covered by financial
aid, because it appears on the University bill.
He hopes the fee will be enacted next year.
Discounts attract students to cell phones
While ITSS and Residential Computing
are working towards strengthening landline
services, ITSS cannot avoid the fact that

more and more students are getting cell
phones. The AT&T Wireless providers in
front of the Stanford Bookstore said last
week that for the previous two weeks they
have been signing up between 30 and 90 stu
dents per day.
The Yankee Group reported that one of
the steps many universities are taking to
counter the cell phone trend is to team up
with wireless providers, which is what ITSS is
doing. Stanford students, through a special
Stanford-AT&T Wireless Sponsorship Pro
gram negotiated by the University, which
went into effect September 1, 2004, receive
discounted cell phone plans.
In the past, ITSS was the middleman
working with AT&T and student cell phone
plans on campus, according to Nancy Ware,
director of business planning and communi
cation at ITSS.
"[Cell phone plans] are more efficient
handled in the open market," Ware said in an
interview. "Students see better rates. We
have partnered with AT&T fora number of
years. Getting ITSS out of the middle, stu
dents get better service in the open market."
Students who already subscribe to the
Stanford-AT&T Wireless service managed
by ITSS can opt to switch to the new Spon
sorship Program, but aren't required to do so
and will still be covered by ITSS.
Many incoming freshmen come in with
their cell phones, such as Maura Burk, and
choose not to get a landline.
"I have always had a cell phone," Burk, an
athlete, said. "I'm not in my room, I'm al
ways out and about. I already have three e
mail accounts to check - it is more convenient
to have one phone line."
Others, such as freshman Liz Renman,
are taking advantage of the new Stanford-
AT&T partnership and switching to wireless
for the first time.
"I looked at prices," Renman said.
"[Landlines] charge an arm and a leg. It is
worth getting a cell phone [even though] I
would rather have a landline. I think cell
phones are annoying."
