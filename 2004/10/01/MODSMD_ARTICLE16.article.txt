# Huge upset! BICs beat bikes
## 
### CASSIDY DELINE 
Ever since BIC pens worth pennies have
proved capable of defeating expensive,
steel bike locks, campus cyclists have wor
ried about the safety of their bikes.
$80 to $100 locks are rendered useless
by the barrel of a pen. On a campus where
the average student is already a victim of
bike theft at least once in their four years,
this news has many worried.
The lock sabotage method was posted
on a San Francisco cycling Web site, Bike-
Forums, two weeks ago and has since
prompted a full recall by the leading maker
of U-locks with circular keys, Kryptonite.
The company plans to give costumers new
locks at no charge.
"I just got a brand new bike that 1 paid
$200 for," freshman Marina Scannell com
plained. "1 bought the lock, which guaran
teed that your bike wouldn't be stolen and
now I feel like it could be stolen right
away."
Christian Parker of the Campus Bike
Shop affirmed this fear, saying that he has
seen a student break a U-lock in about 20
seconds using the pen method.
"It's crazy that you can break the un
breakable lock with a bit of plastic," fresh
man Amy Briggs said.
Parker claims that the bike shop hopes
to be able to replace all U-locks on campus,
regardless of where the lock was bought.
However, they have not yet negotiated a
deal with Kryptonite. Also, anyone hoping
to exchange their lock needs to register on
the Kryptonite Web site.
It will take several weeks until new, al
ternative locks are manufactured and dis
tributed, and BIC-resistant brands of locks
— including On Guard — are sold out at
the campus bike shop.
Jeff Selzer, from Palo Alto Bicycles, said
that most local shops are also sold out.
"We have no U-locks left," he said. "Ev
eryone rushed in and depleted everything

we had."
However, Palo Alto Bicycles, like many
stores, is receiving a new shipment of locks
later this week that cannot be picked with a
BIC.
This still leaves the majority of students
who use the U-lock formerly touted by the
university with less high-tech methods of
protecting their bikes.
Because cable locks can be easily cut,
Parker claims the best defense against bike
theft is to simply make bikes ugly. There
are spray paint stands at bicycle registration
sites that help to make bicycles less attrac
tive to potential thieves.
Freshman Ethan Kottke took matters
into his own hands, or rather his father did.
"He went crazy with the spray paint," Kot
tke said. "My entire bike is covered. I real
ly don't think anybody would want it now
though."
Campus police predict that, despite the
new inefficiency of U-locks, bicycle theft
will not increase perceptibly, notably be
cause thieves are said to steal based on the
bike, not the lock.
A spokeperson from the police depart
ment stated in an e-mail that if a bike thief
sees a bicycle that they want, they are going
to take it and there have always been meth
ods of that-from grinders to car jacks.
Senior Erem Boto agrees.
"There are so many better bikes on the
rack than mine, I don't really feel like it is
likely [that it gets stolen], or that 1 need to
buy another lock," he said.
Parker predicts that actual bike theft will
not increase, but recreational "bike bor
rowing" may become more of a problem.
Students may begin to experiment with
their pens and take their friends bikes fora
ride.
"Locks kept honest people honest," he
said. "Now the pens make it possible for
honest people to be dishonest. The dishon
est people are dishonest, regardless."
