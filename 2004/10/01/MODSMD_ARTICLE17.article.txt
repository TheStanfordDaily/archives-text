# Flip-flops: Your favorite footwear may be flawed
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
If there is a shoe that is nearly
übiquitous on campus, it's the flip
flop. Bright and flashy, sturdy and
comfortable, flip-flops come in all
shapes, sizes, colors and prices.
From a $3.99 pair at Walgreen's to a
$ 19.840 diamond-and-gold pair sold
by Brazilian jewelry company H.
Stern, the possibilities are endless.
Spanning in popularity across
the country, and even across the
globe, they have become the
world's most popular footwear, ac
cording to the San Francisco-based
marketing research company
Trendscape.
Why the craze? They are the ul
timate comfort shoes.
"Flip-flops require minimal ef
fort," said Katie Rasor, a senior.
"They are also great for me because
I'm tall. I 'm not going to put on cute
little heels and tower over everyone
when I head out to party."
Many Stanford girls said they
prefered to wear flip-flops to heels
when heading out for the night.
"You can actually dance in
them," said senior Chloe Rothstein.

"My former roommate once made
me wear high-heeled shoes that were
really cute. When I wore them to a
frat party though, I had to leave after
45 minutes because it was too
painful. I prefer to stick to flip-flops."
Rasor. who owns 10 pairs of flip
flops, has been wearing them for
years. Others only discovered flip
flops after spending some time in
California, where surf-inspired
fashion has spread from the beach
es to the pavement.
"The shoes are definitely part of
the surfer look," said Anjail Floyd-
Pruitt, Class of 2004. "If a guy is
wearing board shorts and flip-flops -
that's a very hot look."
Guys don't have to say "dude"
and tote a surfboard to join the
trend: Men currently make up a
quarter of flip-flop sales and have
become equal devotees.
"I didn't start wearing flip-flops
until sophomore year." said Gau
tam Raghavan, Class of 2004. "But
then I got a pair of Reefs — they
were the most popular type at the
time — and now find myself wear
ing flip-flops all of the time."
Raghavan, who is from Seattle,
said that most of the people in his

hometown did not wear flip-flops.
Now that he has graduated and
headed outside of the Golden State,
he's having a hard time switching
back to real shoes.
"I spent some time in Washing
ton D.C. and people definitely
asked me why I wasn't wearing real
shoes," Raghavan said.
Floyd-Pruitt said she found flip
flops to be considerably less preva
lent outside of California, although
the trend was slowly spreading,
much to her dismay.
Some doctors and health experts
are concerned about the rising pop
ularity of flip-flops. Flip-flops are
troublesome fora variety of rea
sons, most notably because of their
lack of arch support. For some,
walking around fora long around of
time with flip-flops can lead to in
flammation of a connective tissue
running along the bottom of the
foot, a condition known as plantar
fasciitis.
"It is certainly possible — and bi
ologically plausible — that a lack of
arch support might aggravate the
condition," said Rachelle Buch
binder, an associate prof, of clinical
epidemiology at Monash University

in Australia, in an e-mail. Buch
binder has written extensively on
plantar fasciitis and is researching
the factors that lead to the condition.
People who wake up with a dull
pain in their heel or in their arch are
advised to minimize their use of
flip-flops — or at least to alternate
them with other shoes that support
the arch.
Additionally, in order to keep
flip-flops on your feet, you grip your
toes every time you take a step,
causing the knees to lock and the
tissue along the shin to tighten-up.
Overuse of any muscle, includ
ing the muscle groups that allow
you to wear the shoes, can lead to
cramps or inflammation.
Finally, there is the issue of
breaking them in - and the blisters
are never pretty.
"I've seen girls walking around with
bloody feet," said Floyd-Pruitt. "It
looks very painful."
Despite the pain, it appears that
once people catch the trend, they
are hard-pressed to give up their fa
vorite shoes.
"I never wear anything else,"
said Rasor. "How could I? It would
be too much of a hassle."

Available in an array of styles, flip fops are popular among college stu
dents because of their comfort — but they're bad news for your feet.
