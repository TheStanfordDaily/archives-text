## Editorial Pre-Orientation trips not inclusive 
### 
For the first time, Stanford freshmen had the
opportunity to bond before Orientation
through a pre-orientation trip, which began
on Sept. 20, but not all freshman had the op
portunity to attend. There was not even an open ap
plication process: Only freshman from the Northeast
were informed of the weekend trip.
Although the coordinators are planning to expand
the program's capacity in the future, a chance to at
tend a pre-orientation trip should either be extended
to every freshman or none at all.
Pre-orientation gives a select group of freshmen a so
cial advantage at the very start of the year. Aside from a
handful of athletes, the vast majority of incoming fresh
men arrive on the same day on an equal social footing.
Incoming students go through the same Stanford rites of
passage, and nobody knows who their roommates and
others are until the first day of Orientation.
Many freshmen are understandably anxious at the
start of the year, but they can be comforted to know that
every body else is at the same stage of the process as them.
Pre-orientation trips disturb that balance. Al
though the short multi-day trip only allows so much
time for students to form friendships, it is an advan
tage that some students have over others.
Even more disturbing is the manner 111 which the trip
is marketed. Students from anywhere other than the
Northeast are not even informed about the program.
The coordinators said they did not want to have too
large of an applicant pool for the limited number of
spots available. Geographical discrimination is a
strange and unacceptable remedy to such a problem.
The coordinators decided to extend the limited

sluts to students from the Northeast because they face
the hardest transition to Stanford. Students from the
Northeast are from a different culture and far from
home.
But students from the Southeast can have trouble
adapting, and those from the Midwest often report
feeling out of place at first as well. The bottom line is
that designating one group as more deserving of such a
trip experience is an arbitrary and unfair decision.
If the pre-orientation trips are to continue, they
should be offered to everyone. At the very least, the
application process for the limited number of spots
should be open to all Stanford admits so that there is
a level playing field. Although more people would be
disappointed when they were not accepted, at least
such a setup it would be fair.
The unpaid coordinators of the trip are working to
expand access to the program, and their effort is com
mendable. But one problem of expanding the pro
gram's number of slots is a lack of financial resources
to fund a larger enrollment in the trips. This raises an
important concern. If the administration does decide
to fund pre-orientation trips for freshmen in order to
make the program larger in size, it should be wary of the
cost. Stanford already has a full-fledged Orientation
program, and there comes a point at which the cost of
additional activities aimed at orienting incoming fresh
men might outweigh any benefits.
To arbitrarily allow some freshmen the opportunity
to bond with classmates and others is unfair. We don't
see a particularly compelling reason for pre-orientation
trips to exist in the first place, but at the very least, all
freshmen should have an equal chance to attend them.
