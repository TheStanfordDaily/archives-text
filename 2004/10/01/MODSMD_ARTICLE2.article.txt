# Despite rough start, UW coach deserves better
## 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON 
It has not been pretty in Montlake of late.
Washington's once-proud football program —
which unseated USC for Pac-10 supremacy in the
80's, won a share of the national championship in
1991 and sent eight quarterbacks to the NFL in the
past decade — is staring down the barrel at an un
heard-of 0-4 start.
Tawdry off-the-field behavior and on-the-field in
eptitude have become the norm. An internal investi
gation, with the NCAA right behind, has ripped apart
the athletic department.
The man with the target on his back, and the guy
who will likely feel the axe, is head coach Keith
Gilbertson.
There's no one left to fire. The school president
left for Rutgers. Former coach Rick Neuheisel was
shown the door after taking part in high-stakes
NCAA Tournament betting pools. Athletic director
Barbara Hedges bowed out soon after, chased by the
embarrassment of "Slick Rick's" fast and loose
regime.
A Washington native, Gilby has been of great ser
vice to the university as the offensive coordinator of
their most recent Rose Bowl teams (1992 and 2001)
with eight years as an assistant. As the most sensible
(or perhaps only) choice, he took the reins barely a
month before the 2003 season opener once
Neuheisel's firing became official.
His first major decision was widely praised " the
suspension of fullback Zach Tuiasosopo pending the
resolution of his legal action for drunk and disorderly
conduct. This set a precedent that Neuheisel,s shrug
a-shoulder attitude towards athlete crime would be
no more.
Cobbling together a staff of new hires and UW vet
erans, he guided the ship through a disconcerting 6-6
campaign marked by uneven play, spotty focus and
poor on-field leadership. Despite having the most dy
namic player in the Pac-10 in receiver Reggie
Williams, the Huskies were crushed by Ohio State and
USC, lost to doormat programs Nevada and Arizona
and were annihilated by Cal to the tune of 54-7. Only
an amazing comeback win against hated rival Wash
ington State put even a meager face on the season.
This year has begun like a nightmare: home losses
to Fresno State, where turnovers gave the game away,
and UCLA, where the defense allowed 4(H) rushing
yards. Then came the 38-3 shellacking in South Bend,
where the game was practically over at kickoff.
This is without mentioning that Neuheisel did not
leave the roster in the best of shape. UW features two
great tailbacks, but a line incapable of blocking for them;
a dynamic receiver in C harles Frederick, but no quar
terback to consistently complement his playmaking
ability; a ferocious inside linebacker with freshman de
fensive tackles to protect him.
This is not to say Gilbertson is blameless; players have
had time to adjust to his style and have not responded
well. He has drawn fire for his rotation of Husky quar
terbacks. He can also exhibit a clipped, if not curt, atti
tude toward the press that makes his standing with fans
tenuous. Mixed records as head coach at Cal and Idaho
suggest to some that he's not head-coach material.
IJW fans are antsy and angry. They've seen the
Cougars rise to the top of the conference, having gone
19-5 in Pac-1() play the past three seasons. This weekend

As Huskies struggle,
coach faces criticism

would be a pood time for Gilbertson to work another
coaching miracle; judging by the two teams' play last
weekend, UW might be lucky to get out of Stanford Sta
dium short of another massive humiliation. If that hap
pens. the fans will criticize what he cats for breakfast.
It is hard to feel sorry for anyone who makes six fig
ures to teach a game. It is easy to say that these are the
breaks that come in big-time sports. But it is not hard to
feel fora man who, after giving his best fora decade of
his career, stepped in when the school needed him most,
and now seems destined to be cast aside.
The head coach is always responsible for his team,
and part of that is taking the fall. But for all the service
Gilbertson has given the Huskies, it seems a cruel price
to make him pay.

vice to the university as the offensive coordinator of
their most recent Rose Bowl teams (1992 and 2001)
with eight years as an assistant. As the most sensible
(or perhaps only) choice, he took the reins barely a
month before the 2003 season opener once
Neuheisel's firing became official.
His first major decision was widely praised " the
suspension of fullback Zach Tuiasosopo pending the
resolution of his legal action for drunk and disorderly
conduct. This set a precedent that Neuheisel,s shrug
a-shoulder attitude towards athlete crime would be
no more.
Cobbling together a staff of new hires and UW vet
erans, he guided the ship through a disconcerting 6-6
campaign marked by uneven play, spotty focus and
poor on-field leadership. Despite having the most dy
namic player in the Pac-10 in receiver Reggie
Williams, the Huskies were crushed by Ohio State and
USC, lost to doormat programs Nevada and Arizona
and were annihilated by Cal to the tune of 54-7. Only
an amazing comeback win against hated rival Wash
ington State put even a meager face on the season.
This year has begun like a nightmare: home losses
to Fresno State, where turnovers gave the game away,
and UCLA, where the defense allowed 4(H) rushing
yards. Then came the 38-3 shellacking in South Bend,
where the game was practically over at kickoff.
This is without mentioning that Neuheisel did not
leave the roster in the best of shape. UW features two
great tailbacks, but a line incapable of blocking for them;
a dynamic receiver in C harles Frederick, but no quar
terback to consistently complement his playmaking
ability; a ferocious inside linebacker with freshman de
fensive tackles to protect him.
This is not to say Gilbertson is blameless; players have
had time to adjust to his style and have not responded
well. He has drawn fire for his rotation of Husky quar
terbacks. He can also exhibit a clipped, if not curt, atti
tude toward the press that makes his standing with fans
tenuous. Mixed records as head coach at Cal and Idaho
suggest to some that he's not head-coach material.
IJW fans are antsy and angry. They've seen the
Cougars rise to the top of the conference, having gone
19-5 in Pac-1() play the past three seasons. This weekend

As Huskies struggle,
coach faces criticism

would be a pood time for Gilbertson to work another
coaching miracle; judging by the two teams' play last
weekend, UW might be lucky to get out of Stanford Sta
dium short of another massive humiliation. If that hap
pens. the fans will criticize what he cats for breakfast.
It is hard to feel sorry for anyone who makes six fig
ures to teach a game. It is easy to say that these are the
breaks that come in big-time sports. But it is not hard to
feel fora man who, after giving his best fora decade of
his career, stepped in when the school needed him most,
and now seems destined to be cast aside.
The head coach is always responsible for his team,
and part of that is taking the fall. But for all the service
Gilbertson has given the Huskies, it seems a cruel price
to make him pay.
