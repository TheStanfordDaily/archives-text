# Despite rough start, UW coach deserves better
## 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON 
It has not been pretty in Montlake of late.
Washington's once-proud football program —
which unseated USC for Pac-10 supremacy in the
80's, won a share of the national championship in
1991 and sent eight quarterbacks to the NFL in the
past decade — is staring down the barrel at an un
heard-of 0-4 start.
Tawdry off-the-field behavior and on-the-field in
eptitude have become the norm. An internal investi
gation, with the NCAA right behind, has ripped apart
the athletic department.
The man with the target on his back, and the guy
who will likely feel the axe, is head coach Keith
Gilbertson.
There's no one left to fire. The school president
left for Rutgers. Former coach Rick Neuheisel was
shown the door after taking part in high-stakes
NCAA Tournament betting pools. Athletic director
Barbara Hedges bowed out soon after, chased by the
embarrassment of "Slick Rick's" fast and loose
regime.
A Washington native, Gilby has been of great ser
vice to the university as the offensive coordinator of
their most recent Rose Bowl teams (1992 and 2001)
with eight years as an assistant. As the most sensible
(or perhaps only) choice, he took the reins barely a
month before the 2003 season opener once
Neuheisel's firing became official.
His first major decision was widely praised " the
suspension of fullback Zach Tuiasosopo pending the
resolution of his legal action for drunk and disorderly
conduct. This set a precedent that Neuheisel,s shrug
a-shoulder attitude towards athlete crime would be
no more.
Cobbling together a staff of new hires and UW vet
erans, he guided the ship through a disconcerting 6-6
campaign marked by uneven play, spotty focus and
poor on-field leadership. Despite having the most dy
namic player in the Pac-10 in receiver Reggie
Williams, the Huskies were crushed by Ohio State and
USC, lost to doormat programs Nevada and Arizona
and were annihilated by Cal to the tune of 54-7. Only
an amazing comeback win against hated rival Wash
ington State put even a meager face on the season.
This year has begun like a nightmare: home losses
