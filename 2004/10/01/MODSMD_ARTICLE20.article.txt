## Dancing should be left to Dollies 
### 
Recently the Competitive Cheer team has been
performing in the alumni section of sporting
events, threatening the Dollies' role of being
the exclusive performers at basketball and
football games. Competitive Cheer performs on the
other side of the field from the Dollies, but this can be
confusing and distracting. In the name of tradition and
in the interest of maximizing the Dollies' dramatic ef
fect at athletic events, ('ompetitive C 'heer should not be
allowed to perform at sporting events.
Stanford has many time-honored traditions: Full Moon
on the Quad. Secret Snowllake, Band Run and Screw
Your Roommate. The Band and the Dollies are part of
Stanford's unique identity as well. By permitting competi
tive cheerleaders at sporting events, the Dollies get less at
tention, and this can change the feeling in the stands. At a
time when many of Stanford's traditions are coming under
assault, this is one that should still be revered.

Some people argue that there is no need to exclude
anybody from performing at sporting events. However,
not everybody gets to be on the football and basketball
teams, and even the Competitive Cheer members have
cuts. Exclusivity does play a role in many of our activi
ties, and tradition is a valid reason for preventing the
competitive cheerleaders from performing at games.
That is not to say that Competitive Cheer team
should be disbanded. If students want to be a part of
such a squad, they should be allowed to train for and
compete at cheerleading events. The Cheer Squad
should still be allowed to perform at halftime shows, but
they should not have a presence when the game is on.
Stanford is an open and accepting community, but
every institution must have its share of practices and
traditions. The Stanford community can try its best to
accommodate all of our members, but sometimes tra
dition should trump inclusivity.
