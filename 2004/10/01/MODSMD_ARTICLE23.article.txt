# Readership Editor
## What The Daily leaves out of the paper... 
### 
Why was a story about the
University lifting a two
year hiring freeze buried
on page AlO when a story
about 50 students going on a camping
trip was on page A1 above the fold?
Is it appropriate for The Daily to
print an editorial in yesterday's paper
about changes to Flo Mo Dining's
hours ("Stanford Dining scheduling
changes add value for students," Sept.
30) when it never ran a news story on
the modifications?
And is saying that the University
"censored" a sculpture really crossing
the line between reporting and edito
rializing?
After about a week on the job (and
having received only one e-mail), it's
clear to me that the concept of a "read
ership editor" is still foreign to much
of The Daily's audience. Since five
newspapers don't really create
enough of a body of work to expound
cogently on broad trends in The
Daily's coverage. I'm going to use this
column to demonstrate to readers
what readership editors think about
— and how they keep the paper in
check.
One is the placement of stories —
what does the paper think is impor
tant, and who are they writing for?
The top stories in the first issue of Vol
ume 226 were about controversy over
the Stanford Band, pre-orientation
trips for new students and University
President John Hennessy's Freshman
Convocation message — clearly
demonstrating the staff's desire to
reach out to new students in what is
billed the "Orientation issue."
So what falls by the wayside? For
years, graduate and professional stu
dents have consistently agitated for in -
creased coverage in The Daily, which
is handicapped by the fact that its staff
is comprised almost entirely of under
graduates (although these students
should be pleased to see Thursday's
lead story on the trade-offs facing law
students).
And while stories on the financial
strength of the University and new
professorial acquisitions made the
front page (albeit on the bottom),
news that the University was lifting its
hiring ban in the face of a rosier finan
cial outkx>k was left to the corner of
AlO — reflecting another trend for
Daily editors to be less jazzed about
news on the scholarly and monetary
health of the University. It's too early
to tell if these tendencies will extend

into this new volume, but they are pat
terns to watch for.
A second issue is what the paper
decides to not tell you about. For ex
ample, most of the campus wouldn't
have known that Flo Mo Dining was
being shut down on weekends until
yesterday, when The Daily ran an edi
torial commending Stanford Dining
for making a tough but appropriate
decision in the face of student com
plaints. An angered Faisan freshman
could argue that such an editorial was
unfair — this event apparently wasn't
worthy of a news story, but now the
campus' only information about the
change in services comes from the
Daily's argument supporting the deci
sion?
Editorials are notoriously danger
ous sources of news, and readers
should be wary of editorials in the ab
sence of related news stories, since ed
itorials aren't designed to give you all
of the facts.
A third concern is whether The
Daily covers and represents its stories
fairly. A letter to the editor in
Wednesday's paper alleges that a
Tuesday headline, "Univ. censors
sculpture," was judgmental, implying
that the paper cast the story in a light
favorable to the artist involved. If you
look up the meaning of "censor," in
this case it seems pretty clear that The
Daily's characterization was accurate,
but headlines can carry enormous
weight and a misleading headline can
color an entire story.
Looking at how The Daily covers
stories can also include what voices
are left out. For example, Monday's
story on Full Moon on the Quad heav
ily quotes Joey Natoli and Nanci
Howe — two of the events main orga
nizers— while leaving unanswered
the question of why Full Moon on the
Quad wasn't held on the first full
moon of the quarter, Sept. 28. Does
this show a bias toward authority?
It is far too early to make judg
ments about the current volume of
The Daily and where its focus, biases
and emphases will fall — but these are
the elements of newspaper writing
that any critic (positive or negative)
should be aware of. and I encourage
you all to join me in being an engaged
reader.

Why was a story about the
University lifting a two
year hiring freeze buried
on page AlO when a story
about 50 students going on a camping
trip was on page A1 above the fold?
Is it appropriate for The Daily to
print an editorial in yesterday's paper
about changes to Flo Mo Dining's
hours ("Stanford Dining scheduling
changes add value for students," Sept.
30) when it never ran a news story on
the modifications?
And is saying that the University
"censored" a sculpture really crossing
the line between reporting and edito
rializing?
After about a week on the job (and
having received only one e-mail), it's
clear to me that the concept of a "read
ership editor" is still foreign to much
of The Daily's audience. Since five
newspapers don't really create
enough of a body of work to expound
cogently on broad trends in The
Daily's coverage. I'm going to use this
column to demonstrate to readers
what readership editors think about
— and how they keep the paper in
check.
One is the placement of stories —
what does the paper think is impor
tant, and who are they writing for?
The top stories in the first issue of Vol
ume 226 were about controversy over
the Stanford Band, pre-orientation
trips for new students and University
President John Hennessy's Freshman
Convocation message — clearly
demonstrating the staff's desire to
reach out to new students in what is
billed the "Orientation issue."
So what falls by the wayside? For
years, graduate and professional stu
dents have consistently agitated for in -
creased coverage in The Daily, which
is handicapped by the fact that its staff
is comprised almost entirely of under
graduates (although these students
should be pleased to see Thursday's
lead story on the trade-offs facing law
students).
And while stories on the financial
strength of the University and new
professorial acquisitions made the
front page (albeit on the bottom),
news that the University was lifting its
hiring ban in the face of a rosier finan
cial outkx>k was left to the corner of
AlO — reflecting another trend for
Daily editors to be less jazzed about
news on the scholarly and monetary
health of the University. It's too early
to tell if these tendencies will extend

into this new volume, but they are pat
terns to watch for.
A second issue is what the paper
decides to not tell you about. For ex
ample, most of the campus wouldn't
have known that Flo Mo Dining was
being shut down on weekends until
yesterday, when The Daily ran an edi
torial commending Stanford Dining
for making a tough but appropriate
decision in the face of student com
plaints. An angered Faisan freshman
could argue that such an editorial was
unfair — this event apparently wasn't
worthy of a news story, but now the
campus' only information about the
change in services comes from the
Daily's argument supporting the deci
sion?
Editorials are notoriously danger
ous sources of news, and readers
should be wary of editorials in the ab
sence of related news stories, since ed
itorials aren't designed to give you all
of the facts.
A third concern is whether The
Daily covers and represents its stories
fairly. A letter to the editor in
Wednesday's paper alleges that a
Tuesday headline, "Univ. censors
sculpture," was judgmental, implying
that the paper cast the story in a light
favorable to the artist involved. If you
look up the meaning of "censor," in
this case it seems pretty clear that The
Daily's characterization was accurate,
but headlines can carry enormous
weight and a misleading headline can
color an entire story.
Looking at how The Daily covers
stories can also include what voices
are left out. For example, Monday's
story on Full Moon on the Quad heav
ily quotes Joey Natoli and Nanci
Howe — two of the events main orga
nizers— while leaving unanswered
the question of why Full Moon on the
Quad wasn't held on the first full
moon of the quarter, Sept. 28. Does
this show a bias toward authority?
It is far too early to make judg
ments about the current volume of
The Daily and where its focus, biases
and emphases will fall — but these are
the elements of newspaper writing
that any critic (positive or negative)
should be aware of. and I encourage
you all to join me in being an engaged
reader.
