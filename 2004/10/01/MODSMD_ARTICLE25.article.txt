## The 						CBS scoop on Bush's Vietnam records was inaccurate journalism 
### ROBERT ZELNICK 
At the 1980 Republican convention
in Detroit I came within a few tele
phone digits of reporting that Ronald
Reagan had offered the vice presiden
tial candidacy to Cierald Ford before
deciding my information was too soft.
Seven years later, misled by an unreli
able source. I reported that a special
White House panel would soon accuse
presidential chicf-of-staff Donald
Regan of leading the Iran-Contra
cover-up. I retracted that erroneous

scoop later the same evening.
So my initial sentiment when a
major news organization like CBS
botches a big one is both sympathy and
empathy. I know what is like to have the
smell of the hunt in your nostrils, the
building euphoria as pieces of a big
story fall into place, the adrenalin rush
as you wateh your enterprise make air
and know that millions of others are
watching too.
But I felt a sense of professional be
trayal as Dan Rather and colleagues
defended their "60 Minutes" report

providing documentary proof that
George W. Bush had shirked his duties
as a Texas air national guardsman and
that his superior. Lt. Colonel Jerry B.
Killian. now long deceased, had been
pressed to sugar-coat the affair.
After an odd couple assortment of
bloggersand traditional news organiza
tions raised doubts about what CBS
claimed were Killian s notes, the net
works position began to unravel. Their
source. Bill Burkett. turned out to be an
emotionally disturbed former Texas
guardsman who had long been on an

anti-Bush vendetta. As a quid pro quo
for delivering the material, he had de
manded access to a top Kerry campaign
official, a request senior "60 Minutes"
producer Mary Mapcs obliged, con
tacting Joe Lock hart days before the
piece aired. Burkett would later say he
lied about his own source for the docu
ments, something even a desk assistant
could have discovered had the CBS
team insisted on establishing a chain of
custody. Instead. CBS rushed to air de
spite caveats from its own document
experts that serious authenticity ques

tions were unanswered.
Unconscionably, Rather vouched
for the document's authenticity and at
tacked critics as partisan. Even after ac
knowledging he could no longer defend
the papers, he offered no retraction of
the story, instead claiming that the
heart of the report attacking the presi
dent was unchallenged.
Unchallenged indeed. Without the
documents there was no heart of the re
port. only 30-year-old hearsay. Without
them the report would never have made
"60 Minutes." or the Evening News, or

for that matter, the Podunk Press.
CBS has now retained a committee
of two: former attorney general Dick
Thornburg and former Ass<xnate Press
President Louis D. Boccardi, to explore
what went wrong and why. Similar post
debacle inquires at The New York
Times, USA Today and CNN have re
sulted in personnel changes up to the
very top. CBS, a monument to the arro
gance of fading network power, might
kxik better with that sort of makeover.
