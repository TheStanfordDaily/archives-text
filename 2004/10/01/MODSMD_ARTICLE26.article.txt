## Women earn hard-fought tie at Santa Clara 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was an all-out battle under the lights at Buck
Shaw Stadium last night as the No. 16 Stanford
women's soccer team (7-2-1) finished its eagerly
awaited match-up against No. 15 Santa Clara (6-2-2)
in a scoreless tie. The game went into double over
time as neither team could register the game-winning
goal.
It was exactly the type of performance the Cardi
nal were looking for against a gritty Bronco team that
defeated them twice last season.
"Its always a battle with Santa Clara because
they're our huge rivals," said sophomore midfielder
Shari Summers. "We played really well defensively
and we were able to create a lot of opportunities that
just unluckily didn't go in."
The Cardinal started off the first half rather slug
gishly, generating no shots on goal and very few scor
ing opportunities. The team struggled to get the ball
into the Broncos' zone, which gave Santa Clara plen
ty of early chances.
Luckily the Cardinal defense was able to limit the
damage to just three shots and no goals. It also held

Santa Clara's double threat of Tina Estrada and
Leslie Osborne to few touches.
While the Cardinal did look slow at the start, their
play soon intensified, a sign of what was to be seen for
the rest of the game. Together Stanford and Santa
Clara racked up 11 fouls in the half.
"It was hard play on both sides and it was fair
play." said junior midfielder Leah Tapscott. "Every
one's bruised up a bit but that's because we both re
ally wanted it."
Things got a bit too physical for Stanford, howev
er, when defender Jenny Farenbaugh went down late
in the first half in a collision. After finally getting up,
Farenbaugh spent the remaining minute of the first
half limping around the field.
Fortunately Farenbaugh was back in action for
the entire second half and both overtime sessions.
The Cardinal had a much more aggressive sec
ond half, playing better possession and keeping the
ball out of their own zone. Scoring leaders Marcie
Ward and Lizzy George combined for five shots on
goal as the Cardinal outshot the Broncos 6-2 in the
half.
Senior Natalie Sanderson also had a good look
late in game, but missed as the ball sailed just high.

"First half was definitely chaotic," said Tapscott.
"We came out a little slow, but rebounded well in the
second half. We had some great chances and didn't
put them away, but didn't put our heads down."
The two overtimes offered more gritty perfor
mances and continued physical play from both sides.
But as in the regular two quarters, neither team could
penetrate past the other's defense to score.
Nicole Barnhart had a stellar performance in goal
for the Cardinal, registering one save en route to her
fifth shutout of the season.
The Cardinal will have two days to recuperate
from their grueling match before facing off against
yet another Bay Area rival on Sunday. This time
Stanford will be playing host to unranked Saint
Mary's in what will be the team's final game before
beginning Pac-1() play.
Stanford has been dominant against the Gaels in
the past, posting a 13-5-2 career record against them.
Even more impressively, the Cardinal have not lost to
Saint Mary's since 1989, when they were shutout 1-0.
While the Cardinal have history on their side, that
does not mean Sunday's match will be an easy one.
