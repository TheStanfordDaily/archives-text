# Volleyball set to face Cal

### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
You have to play one game at a time.
One of the oldest sports cliches in the
book has rarely held so true for the Stan
ford women's volleyball team, which looks
to rebound from a 3-1 loss to St. Mary's as
it jumps back into its Pacific-10 Confer
ence schedule.
The No. 11 Cardinal (9-3, 2-0 Pac-10)
host No. 12 California (7-4, 2-0) at Burn
ham Pavilion tonight at 7 p.m. Cal is fresh
off a loss as well after being swept by Santa
Clara on Tuesday.
Stanford has long dominated its cross
bay rivals in volleyball and has a com
manding 52-4 edge over the Bears in the
all-time series. Cal split the season series
last year after winning a thriller in Berke
ley, 3-2, for its first win against Stanford
since 1982. The Bears haven't won at
Stanford since November 15, 1979, a du
bious streak that includes a 3-1 loss at
Maples Pavilion last season.
"The way college volleyball is right
now, there are so many teams evenly
matched," said head coach John Dunning.
"More and more, the home team is win
ning the close matches because the crowd
gives them that extra boost. We've got to
defend our home court."
Stanford comes off a loss against a St.
Mary's team that defeated the Cardinal for
the second time this season. The Cardi
nal's first loss to the Gaels, back on Sept. 4,
came in a five-game thriller and was their
first loss of the season.
"St. Mary's is a really good team,"
Dunning said. "They aren't given as much
credit as they deserve in the polls. The
crowd was behind them, all good things
were going for them, and we just didn't
play as well as we should have and we
knew it."
The Cardinal seemed frustrated by
the Gaels' solid defense, including great
digging on Stanford's outside hitters. In
addition, the smaller St. Mary's team
seemed to move more quickly than the
Cardinal and put a two or three person
block in the face of almost all Cardinal
kill attempts. The Cardinal didn't exact
ly help their cause, however, as Stan
ford's serve was often soft and directly at
the Gaels.
"If I had to give our service a grade, I'd
say it was a D'," Dunning said. "We've
talked about it, and we want to take that
extra risk and serve tough. Volleyball is a
bit like dominos. By serving soft, we let St.
Mary's pass well almost every time, and
that set up good sets and kills. Once that
first domino falls, everything else is just in
line.
"We're having a hard time right now

because we're still not firing on all cylin
ders, and this is something we expected.
Jenn Hucke is doing a great job for us, but
Kristin Richards and Ogonna Nnamani
are being climbed all over by other teams
because they know where we're going.
Without our middle blockers, which are
getting better, we don't have many op
tions. Our offense is too predictable right
now."
Not all was bad news for the Cardinal,
however. In addition to posting a career
high with 18 digs against St. Mary's, senior
outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani moved
into sixth place on the all-time career kills
list for the Pac-1() and looks to move into
fifth in the match against Cal. She needs
only five kills to pass Christine Garner of
Arizona State at 1.871 kills.
Sophomore middle blocker Lizzie Suit
er also set a new career high for blocks in a
match with 10. The match marked the
fourth time this year Suiter has either tied
or set a new career high. In addition to
playing solid defense. Suiter has not com
mitted a hitting error in nine of her last 12
matches.
Junior Katie Goldhahn, slowed by in
jury at the beginning of the season, is back
and making her presence felt, as she tallied
a season high nine digs against the Gaels
on Tuesday.
Dunning would reach a personal mile
stone with a win against the Bears. He has
99 wins during his tenure at Stanford.
"I really don't think about stuff like
that," said Dunning. "My job is to concen
trate on this game, this season, and this
team. The only time I ever think about
something like that is when someone from
the media reminds me that I've gotten a
little older."
Cal lost its top hitter in the offseason, as
senior Mia Jerkov was ruled ineligible by
the NCAA because of her offseason par
ticipation in a Russian professional league.
Jerkov put up over 700 kills last season for
the Bears, well over 1 / 3 of the team's total
output. Look for the Bears to be led by
redshirt junior outside hitter Gabrielle
Abernathy, whose younger sister Jennifer
plays for Arizona. Through 11 matches
this season, she leads the Bears in kills, ser
vice aces and points.
Head coach Rich Feller is 88-71 at Cal.
Last year, he was named Pac-10 coach of
the year after leading the Bears to the
Sweet Sixteen for the first time in school
history.
The match has been announced as com
pletely sold out. Student sections along the
balcony will be filled on a first-come first
serve basis. As a reminder, the match is a
"White-Out" match, and all spectators are
encouraged to wear white and support the
Cardinal in whiting out the Bears.
