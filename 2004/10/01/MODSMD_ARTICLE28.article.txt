The Stanford women's field hockey team (5-6.0-2
Northern Pacific Athletic Conference) continues its
masquerade as Goldilocks this weekend with three
important conference games.
Coming off a disappointing double-overtime loss
to California, the Cardinal will face-off with the
Southwest Missouri State Bears (5-3,1-1) in back-to
back games on Friday and Saturday to complete a trio
of encounters with Bears teams before facing off with
Saint Louis on Monday. The Cardinal hope that their
trip to Missouri turns out to be "just right.
In Saturday's painful home loss to Bay Area rival
Cal, the Cardinal failed to hold on to a lead they had
held through the first 58 minutes of play. Neverthe
less, the team remains proud of its effort and opti
mistic about the games to come.
"The game against Cal was a good test for us,"
said senior goalkeeper Ana Kralovec. "It was unfor
tunate that we lost, but it did give us confidence in
terms of what we're capable of. and I think that going
on the road this time we're confident in the ability of

our team."
The loss dropped Stanford to 0-2 in the NorPac
conference and adds even more importance to this
upcoming road trip.
"We definitely want to get our first (conference]
win under our belt," said head coach Lesley Irvine.
"Southwest Missouri State is a very good team, so it'd
be a very good win."
SMS stands at 1-1 in the conference after splitting
a pair of matches with Cal.
"We need to pull through this weekend with three
wins, and it's going to take the whole team," added
Kralovec.
SMS is led by midfielder Gabby Gomez and for
ward Adrien Trumpy, who have each logged five
goals in the season so far. Irvine indicated that the
Cardinal were aware of the scoring duo but declined
to comment on any particular strategies Stanford
would employ to shut them down.
The Bears have looked impressive in early con
ference play, beating No. 15 Cal in their first
matchup and then losing a hard-fought rematch against
the Golden Bears 1-0. There is no doubt that SMS still
has a bitter taste left in its mouth after the Cardinal won
two of the schools' three head-to-head matches last
year, including a 2-1 overtime victory that ended the
Bears' season.
"Last year we beat them 6-0 the first time, and then two
days later we lost to them, so we need to make sure we
come out hard for both games," said junior midfielder
Lyndsay Erickson. "I think we learned our lesson last
year."
"1 remember last year, they're a pretty feisty team ...
some of their players aren't the nicest girls," said sopho
more midfielder Aska Sturdevan, who scored Stanford's
only goal in the loss to Cal. "We can expect a physical
game."
The NorPac conference has boasted a high level of par
ity in recent years, with Cal leading a pack of very close
teams. The upcoming road trip should clear up the muddy
picture that is the early NorPac standings. With several
conference games ahead, Stanford is already getting fo-

Cardinal hit road
to take on SMS

cused for the NorPac Conference tournament.
"I think the key is that we focus on the conference tour
nament being the most important thing," Irvine said.
'Whoever wins that tournament goes on to the NCAA
playoff."
The Cardinal failed to make the NCAA playoffs last
year, hut finished the year strong with two overtime wins
that placed them third in the conference. Stanford re
turns six starters and fields a young team that shows a lot
of promise for the future. With only one senior, mid
fielder Eleanor Morgan, Irvine expressed her positive
outlook for the rest of this season and beyond.
"We do have a very young team but they don't play like
they're a young team. Everyone's a leader out there, it's
exciting for the future."
The future of Cardinal field hockey may look bright,
but the focus is on this weekend. With a good week of prac
tice. Stanford is ready and determined to start climbing the
conference standings. With a young team and strong vet
eran leadership. Stanford is ready to don their boots, pull
out their Winchesters and go Bear hunting.
