The Stanford women's field hockey team (5-6.0-2
Northern Pacific Athletic Conference) continues its
masquerade as Goldilocks this weekend with three
important conference games.
Coming off a disappointing double-overtime loss
to California, the Cardinal will face-off with the
Southwest Missouri State Bears (5-3,1-1) in back-to
back games on Friday and Saturday to complete a trio
of encounters with Bears teams before facing off with
Saint Louis on Monday. The Cardinal hope that their
trip to Missouri turns out to be "just right.
In Saturday's painful home loss to Bay Area rival
Cal, the Cardinal failed to hold on to a lead they had
held through the first 58 minutes of play. Neverthe
less, the team remains proud of its effort and opti
mistic about the games to come.
"The game against Cal was a good test for us,"
said senior goalkeeper Ana Kralovec. "It was unfor
tunate that we lost, but it did give us confidence in
terms of what we're capable of. and I think that going
on the road this time we're confident in the ability of

our team."
The loss dropped Stanford to 0-2 in the NorPac
conference and adds even more importance to this
upcoming road trip.
"We definitely want to get our first (conference]
win under our belt," said head coach Lesley Irvine.
"Southwest Missouri State is a very good team, so it'd
be a very good win."
SMS stands at 1-1 in the conference after splitting
a pair of matches with Cal.
"We need to pull through this weekend with three
wins, and it's going to take the whole team," added
Kralovec.
SMS is led by midfielder Gabby Gomez and for
ward Adrien Trumpy, who have each logged five
goals in the season so far. Irvine indicated that the
Cardinal were aware of the scoring duo but declined
to comment on any particular strategies Stanford
would employ to shut them down.
The Bears have looked impressive in early con
ference play, beating No. 15 Cal in their first
