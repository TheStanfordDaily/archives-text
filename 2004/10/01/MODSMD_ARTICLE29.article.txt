# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## A 						word to the wise: The "Overrated!" chant is just that 
### 
This one wasn't even supposed to be close.
Branson High School had a six-foot-six phenom;
a large, angry, beast of a man who had stabbed
someone and wasn't expelled.
We had my buddy Ryan, whose shooting per
centage hovered around the legal limit and who
drove a white Jetta.
They had a pound-it-in style of offense with a le
gitimate height and size advantage at most posi-

tions.
We had a simple give-it-to-the
tall-guy-in-the-middle-or-shoot of
fense that typically did not yield
the sort of results we were looking
for.
But none of it mattered in the
biggest game of the year.
It was Marin Academy vs. Bran
son, and in Northern California
Small Private High School basket-

ball, there was no game bigger. For you see. friends,
the rival high school, Branson, was moving to the
big public school league, telling the rest of the pri
vate schools that its 350 students were better ath
letes than us, that our competition was not needed
any more. They were moving from the BCL to the
MCAL; we were moving from rival to afterthought.
But somehow, we're up three with three seconds
left, the gym is a furnace, and my voice punched out
sometime during the third quarter. We're all stand
ing now, probably half of the school is at this game,
truly believing our best friends can hold fast for one
more Branson inbounds play.
But the game isn't over.
We haven't won.
And we're screaming, "Overrated!"
We mockingly chant "MCAL", we tease their
oversized frontcourt, we gloat in a victory still three
seconds away.
We watch Branson swing the ball to shooting
guard Justin Hoeveler.
Justin Hoeveler, the one kid on that team that
could truly hurt us with his three. Justin Hoeveler,
the No. 23 on my CYO team throughout grade
school. Justin Hoeveler, the alpha male of the
blacktop since before I can remember.
He went to Little League a year early, was na
tionally ranked in who knows how many sports, and
caught the basketball with one second left, down
three.
To tell the truth, I don't actually remember
watching the ball splash through the net. 1 like to
think that I turned my head, that 1 didn't see it, that
it never actually happened. But here's what I do re
member: Justin Hoeveler, staring down the
stunned home crowd, holding his finishing pose.
Three fingers, up in the air — Reggie Miller,


Spencer Porter
How many Stanford
students does it take
to fire a cannon?

Michael Jordan and Justin freak
ing Hoeveler.
He didn't just make us eat our
words; he made us lick the plate.
In overtime, his "overrated"
team absolutely rolled us. They
had all the momentum, all the
adrenaline, and just flat out beat
us in the extra period. Three sec
onds from victory, we seemed to
have it in the bag, I was chanting
"Overrated,", and my heart was
ripped out of my chest by my
childhood foe.
Which brings me to last Satur
day.
For the most part, I love Stan
ford. The weather is fantastic, the
people are "chall," and it's in the
Yay Area. Hell, I'm a senior class
president this year solely because
I wanted to revel in the fun. But
as you might expect from this
segue, I have a bone to pick.
Guess how many times the stu
dents around me decided to chant
"Overrated!" while Stanford
Football was playing USC. No,
really, guess.
Spencer, I'm not going to guess
. . . you're lucky I'm still reading
this garbage.
Three. Three times. Three sep
arate "Overrated!" chants, all in
the first half. Hell, one broke out
while we were losing 10-7.
Unless you were betting on
Stanford to cover the 22-point
spread, I have absolutely no idea
how you could justify that chant.
Please, let me know. Maybe I'll
learn something.

But what rant column about
Stanford Football fans would be
complete without a nice ripping
of the Axe Committee? Ax
eComm, in case you missed it, did
not receive special fees last year,
which was a personal victory for
all of us, to be sure. Yet amazing
ly, like the head lice that infested
half of my hallway freshman year,
they refuse to go away.
Again, I make my personal
plea to you all: Help me help you.
Why? Why? Why does Ax
eComm deem it necessary to have
12 people on the field making a
mockery of the Stanford student?
These kids are running through
the giant helmet as they please,
not paying attention to the game
at will, and generally just taking
up space on the field for no good
reason. Do we need 12 people to
blow a cannon a few times per
game? Do we? Is that stipulated
in the cannon's instructional
manual? Just let me know. Throw
me a frickin' bone here.
Talk about overrated . . . my
roommate told me to read this col
umn . . . what a waste of time.
And Stanford loves me right
back.

while we were losing 10-7.
Unless you were betting on
Stanford to cover the 22-point
spread, I have absolutely no idea
how you could justify that chant.
Please, let me know. Maybe I'll
learn something.

But what rant column about
Stanford Football fans would be
complete without a nice ripping
of the Axe Committee? Ax
eComm, in case you missed it, did
not receive special fees last year,
which was a personal victory for
all of us, to be sure. Yet amazing
ly, like the head lice that infested
half of my hallway freshman year,
they refuse to go away.
Again, I make my personal
plea to you all: Help me help you.
Why? Why? Why does Ax
eComm deem it necessary to have
12 people on the field making a
mockery of the Stanford student?
These kids are running through
the giant helmet as they please,
not paying attention to the game
at will, and generally just taking
up space on the field for no good
reason. Do we need 12 people to
blow a cannon a few times per
game? Do we? Is that stipulated
in the cannon's instructional
manual? Just let me know. Throw
me a frickin' bone here.
Talk about overrated . . . my
roommate told me to read this col
umn . . . what a waste of time.
And Stanford loves me right
back.

This one wasn't even supposed to be close.
Branson High School had a six-foot-six phenom;
a large, angry, beast of a man who had stabbed
someone and wasn't expelled.
We had my buddy Ryan, whose shooting per
centage hovered around the legal limit and who
drove a white Jetta.
They had a pound-it-in style of offense with a le
gitimate height and size advantage at most posi-

tions.
We had a simple give-it-to-the
tall-guy-in-the-middle-or-shoot of
fense that typically did not yield
the sort of results we were looking
for.
But none of it mattered in the
biggest game of the year.
It was Marin Academy vs. Bran
son, and in Northern California
Small Private High School basket-

ball, there was no game bigger. For you see. friends,
the rival high school, Branson, was moving to the
big public school league, telling the rest of the pri
vate schools that its 350 students were better ath
letes than us, that our competition was not needed
any more. They were moving from the BCL to the
MCAL; we were moving from rival to afterthought.
But somehow, we're up three with three seconds
left, the gym is a furnace, and my voice punched out
sometime during the third quarter. We're all stand
ing now, probably half of the school is at this game,
truly believing our best friends can hold fast for one
more Branson inbounds play.
But the game isn't over.
We haven't won.
And we're screaming, "Overrated!"
We mockingly chant "MCAL", we tease their
oversized frontcourt, we gloat in a victory still three
seconds away.
We watch Branson swing the ball to shooting
guard Justin Hoeveler.
Justin Hoeveler, the one kid on that team that
could truly hurt us with his three. Justin Hoeveler,
the No. 23 on my CYO team throughout grade
school. Justin Hoeveler, the alpha male of the
blacktop since before I can remember.
He went to Little League a year early, was na
tionally ranked in who knows how many sports, and
caught the basketball with one second left, down
three.
To tell the truth, I don't actually remember
watching the ball splash through the net. 1 like to
think that I turned my head, that 1 didn't see it, that
it never actually happened. But here's what I do re
member: Justin Hoeveler, staring down the
stunned home crowd, holding his finishing pose.

How many Stanford
students does it take
to fire a cannon?

Michael Jordan and Justin freak
ing Hoeveler.
He didn't just make us eat our
words; he made us lick the plate.
In overtime, his "overrated"
team absolutely rolled us. They
had all the momentum, all the
adrenaline, and just flat out beat
us in the extra period. Three sec
onds from victory, we seemed to
have it in the bag, I was chanting
"Overrated,", and my heart was
ripped out of my chest by my
childhood foe.
Which brings me to last Satur
day.
For the most part, I love Stan
ford. The weather is fantastic, the
people are "chall," and it's in the
Yay Area. Hell, I'm a senior class
president this year solely because
I wanted to revel in the fun. But
as you might expect from this
segue, I have a bone to pick.
Guess how many times the stu
dents around me decided to chant
"Overrated!" while Stanford
Football was playing USC. No,
really, guess.
Spencer, I'm not going to guess
. . . you're lucky I'm still reading
this garbage.
