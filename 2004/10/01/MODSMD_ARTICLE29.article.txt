# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## A
						word to the wise: The "Overrated!" chant is just that 
### 
This one wasn't even supposed to be close.
Branson High School had a six-foot-six phenom;
a large, angry, beast of a man who had stabbed
someone and wasn't expelled.
We had my buddy Ryan, whose shooting per
centage hovered around the legal limit and who
drove a white Jetta.
They had a pound-it-in style of offense with a le
gitimate height and size advantage at most posi-

tions.
We had a simple give-it-to-the
tall-guy-in-the-middle-or-shoot of
fense that typically did not yield
the sort of results we were looking
for.
But none of it mattered in the
biggest game of the year.
It was Marin Academy vs. Bran
son, and in Northern California
Small Private High School basket-

ball, there was no game bigger. For you see. friends,
the rival high school, Branson, was moving to the
big public school league, telling the rest of the pri
vate schools that its 350 students were better ath
letes than us, that our competition was not needed
any more. They were moving from the BCL to the
MCAL; we were moving from rival to afterthought.
But somehow, we're up three with three seconds
left, the gym is a furnace, and my voice punched out
sometime during the third quarter. We're all stand
ing now, probably half of the school is at this game,
truly believing our best friends can hold fast for one
more Branson inbounds play.
But the game isn't over.
We haven't won.
And we're screaming, "Overrated!"
We mockingly chant "MCAL", we tease their
oversized frontcourt, we gloat in a victory still three
seconds away.
We watch Branson swing the ball to shooting
guard Justin Hoeveler.
Justin Hoeveler, the one kid on that team that
could truly hurt us with his three. Justin Hoeveler,
the No. 23 on my CYO team throughout grade
school. Justin Hoeveler, the alpha male of the
blacktop since before I can remember.
He went to Little League a year early, was na
tionally ranked in who knows how many sports, and
caught the basketball with one second left, down
three.
To tell the truth, I don't actually remember
watching the ball splash through the net. 1 like to
think that I turned my head, that 1 didn't see it, that
it never actually happened. But here's what I do re
member: Justin Hoeveler, staring down the
stunned home crowd, holding his finishing pose.
