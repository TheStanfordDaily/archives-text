# Pac-10 extended forecast: USC, Cal
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As Stanford enters its second weekend of Pacific-10
Conference play, it does so in a conference climate that
is anything but clear and sunny.
The Cardinal are set on securing a winning record
this season and, they hope, a berth in one of the Pac
10's seven affiliated bowl games, but they're just one of
10 teams with the same goal. So, without further ado.
The Daily takes a look at the Pac-10 picture, team by
team.
No. 1 Southern California
Stanford fans saw both sides of the Trojans last
weekend. In the first half, the team's young, inexperi
enced side was shown; in the second half, its dominant
physical talent and excellent coaching was on display.
USC (4-0,1-0) sits atop the Pac-10 standings and the
national rankings. The road to the Rose Bowl leads
through Los Angeles this year, and the conference
crown is the Trojans' to lose.
The offense is punishing. Quarterback Matt Leinart
(1,023 yards and eight touchdowns) ranks second in the
Pac-10 in pass efficiency, receiver Steve Smith ranks
third with 25 receptions and running backs LenDale
White and Reggie Bush rank fourth and fifth, respec
tively, in rushing.
The defense is even more dominant. The Trojans
may rank second in scoring offense (36.5 points per
game), but they're first in scoring defense (12.8 points
per game).
On the down side, national No. Is tend to have big
targets on their backs, and Pac-10 teams will bring their

"A" game every week in hopes of springing a monu
mental upset, like Stanford nearly did last weekend.
The Trojans have a bye this weekend, so their position
atop the conference can't change fora couple of weeks,
but they face crucial Pac-10 showdowns with ranked
opponents California and Arizona State in subsequent
weeks.
No. 10 California
Granted, it's easy to look good playing Sun Belt
Conference member New Mexico State and a depleted
Air Force team. But the Golden Bears (2-0) showed
quite a bit of spunk during an 8-6 campaign last year,
and their high national ranking reflects the fact that
they returned most of their talent from 2003.
Junior quarterback Aaron Rodgers, a junior college
transfer who led the Bears to big things last year, leads
the conference in passing efficiency, having completed
31-of-42 attempts for 474 yards, three touchdowns and
nary an interception.
He's done so despite just three catches from last
year's star receiver, Geoff Mac Arthur, who figures to
come around when the Bears start passing more in
more competitive conference games.
One pleasant by-product of its easy early schedule
has been the success of J.J. Arrington, who's averaging
a mind-blowing 11.2 yards per carry, a figure that
would be impressive fora high school running back or
even a kid in a competitive pee-wee football league.
With 32 rushes for 353 yards and a Pac-10-best six
touchdowns, Arrington has shown that it will not be
easy to bring him down this year.
Cal won't have to wait to be tested, though, as it
plays an always-difficult road game against Oregon

State this weekend before traveling to Los Angeles to
take on the Trojans.
No. 21 Arizona State
After a disappointing 2003 that saw them go 5-7, the
Sun Devils (4-0, 1-0) have returned to the form that
made them an eight-win team in 2002.
Arizona State has defeated quality opponents three
weeks in a row, having outgunned Northwestern, lowa
and Oregon State. With senior quarterback Andrew
Walter under center and head coach Dirk Koetter at
the helm, this is a team that no defense likes to face.
Walter has thrown a conference-best 12 touch
downs, racking up 1,085 yards while being intercepted
only once in 156 pass attempts. Derek Hagan has
caught 31 balls for 451 yards and five touchdowns,
ranking second in the conference in each category.
The Sun Devils' defense has given up just 51 points
in four games (12.8 points per game), tying USC for
first in the Pac-10.
While Arizona State doesn't possess much of a rush
ing game — the team's longest rush of the year is just
17 yards, and the team has only two rushing touch
downs — it does possess a tremendous weapon: Jesse
Ainsworth's leg.
Ainsworth has connected on 10-of-12 field goals al
ready this year. The next-best in the Pac-10? Arizona's
Nick Folk, who's made four.
The Devils defeated Oregon State last weekend, but
they must travel to face Oregon this week before tak
ing on USC in Los Angeles on Oct. 16.
