# Pac-10 extended forecast: USC, Cal
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As Stanford enters its second weekend of Pacific-10
Conference play, it does so in a conference climate that
is anything but clear and sunny.
The Cardinal are set on securing a winning record
this season and, they hope, a berth in one of the Pac
10's seven affiliated bowl games, but they're just one of
10 teams with the same goal. So, without further ado.
The Daily takes a look at the Pac-10 picture, team by
team.
No. 1 Southern California
Stanford fans saw both sides of the Trojans last
weekend. In the first half, the team's young, inexperi
enced side was shown; in the second half, its dominant
physical talent and excellent coaching was on display.
USC (4-0,1-0) sits atop the Pac-10 standings and the
national rankings. The road to the Rose Bowl leads
through Los Angeles this year, and the conference
crown is the Trojans' to lose.
The offense is punishing. Quarterback Matt Leinart
(1,023 yards and eight touchdowns) ranks second in the
Pac-10 in pass efficiency, receiver Steve Smith ranks
third with 25 receptions and running backs LenDale
White and Reggie Bush rank fourth and fifth, respec
tively, in rushing.
The defense is even more dominant. The Trojans
may rank second in scoring offense (36.5 points per
game), but they're first in scoring defense (12.8 points
per game).
On the down side, national No. Is tend to have big
targets on their backs, and Pac-10 teams will bring their

"A" game every week in hopes of springing a monu
mental upset, like Stanford nearly did last weekend.
The Trojans have a bye this weekend, so their position
atop the conference can't change fora couple of weeks,
but they face crucial Pac-10 showdowns with ranked
opponents California and Arizona State in subsequent
weeks.
No. 10 California
Granted, it's easy to look good playing Sun Belt
Conference member New Mexico State and a depleted
Air Force team. But the Golden Bears (2-0) showed
quite a bit of spunk during an 8-6 campaign last year,
and their high national ranking reflects the fact that
they returned most of their talent from 2003.
Junior quarterback Aaron Rodgers, a junior college
transfer who led the Bears to big things last year, leads
the conference in passing efficiency, having completed
31-of-42 attempts for 474 yards, three touchdowns and
nary an interception.
He's done so despite just three catches from last
year's star receiver, Geoff Mac Arthur, who figures to
come around when the Bears start passing more in
more competitive conference games.
One pleasant by-product of its easy early schedule
has been the success of J.J. Arrington, who's averaging
a mind-blowing 11.2 yards per carry, a figure that
would be impressive fora high school running back or
even a kid in a competitive pee-wee football league.
With 32 rushes for 353 yards and a Pac-10-best six
touchdowns, Arrington has shown that it will not be
easy to bring him down this year.
Cal won't have to wait to be tested, though, as it
plays an always-difficult road game against Oregon

State this weekend before traveling to Los Angeles to
take on the Trojans.
No. 21 Arizona State
After a disappointing 2003 that saw them go 5-7, the
Sun Devils (4-0, 1-0) have returned to the form that
made them an eight-win team in 2002.
Arizona State has defeated quality opponents three
weeks in a row, having outgunned Northwestern, lowa
and Oregon State. With senior quarterback Andrew
Walter under center and head coach Dirk Koetter at
the helm, this is a team that no defense likes to face.
Walter has thrown a conference-best 12 touch
downs, racking up 1,085 yards while being intercepted
only once in 156 pass attempts. Derek Hagan has
caught 31 balls for 451 yards and five touchdowns,
ranking second in the conference in each category.
The Sun Devils' defense has given up just 51 points
in four games (12.8 points per game), tying USC for
first in the Pac-10.
While Arizona State doesn't possess much of a rush
ing game — the team's longest rush of the year is just
17 yards, and the team has only two rushing touch
downs — it does possess a tremendous weapon: Jesse
Ainsworth's leg.
Ainsworth has connected on 10-of-12 field goals al
ready this year. The next-best in the Pac-10? Arizona's
Nick Folk, who's made four.
The Devils defeated Oregon State last weekend, but
they must travel to face Oregon this week before tak
ing on USC in Los Angeles on Oct. 16.

Sophomore LenDale White and the Trojans remain the fa
vorites to run away with the Pac-10 title.
Washington State
The Cougars (3-1, 1-0) are an anonymous bunch —
have you heard the names Josh Swogger. Jason Hill and
Chris Bruhn before? — but they're playing solid foot
ball for Bill Doba, including a 20-19 comeback win at
Arizona last weekend.
They don't score a ton of points — they rank seventh
in conference with 25.5 points per game — but the de
fense has done its job, yielding only 16 points per game.
Sophomore Josh Swogger has been a nice surprise for
the fans in Pullman, throwing nine touchdowns while
being intercepted only two times. However, he's com
pleting less than half his passes, and his efficiency rating
ranks eighth in the Pac-10.
No one can doubt the value of sophomore Jason Hill,
who's caught a conference-best six touchdowns. He has
419 yards receiving despite having actually hauled in only
15 balls, a stunning 27.9-yard average.
The Cougars will probably need more out of either
Swogger or their ground game to compete against the
Pac-10's best. Bruhn leads the team with 220 yards rush
ing, but he's averaging 3.8 yards per carry and has yet to
find the end zone.
Washington State hosts Oregon this weekend in an
important game for both clubs before hosting Stanford
next weekend.
UCLA
The Bruins (2-1,1-0) have had an inconclusive season.
They were outclassed at home by No. 25 Oklahoma State
before running their way to road wins against struggling
Illinois and Washington teams.
They gave up 31 points to the winless Huskies and
rank eighth in the Pac-10 in scoring defense (26.3 points
per game). They've scored slightly more than they've al
lowed, but it seems rather unlikely that both Maurice
Drew and Manuel White will continue to average over
1 (K) yards rushing per game.
Drew, a talented sophomore, has scored six times and
is averaging 8.6 yards per carry. White, a 250-pound senior,
has powered his way to three scores and a 5.3 average.
Quarterback Drew Olson hasn't had to pass much,
which is fine by Bruins coach Karl Dorrell. Olson has
thrown four interceptions and three touchdowns this
season and ranks ninth in Pac-10 passing efficiency.
UCLA faces winnable home dates against San Diego
State and Arizona before facing Cal and Arizona State in
two tough road games.
Stanford
The Cardinal (2-1, 0-1) have the fifth-best overall
record in the Pac-10. The defense is yielding just 14.7
points per game, while Trent Edwards has thrown for
seven touchdowns and just one interception.
J R. Lemon and Kenneth Tolon form a respectable
ground tandem, averaging 101.7 combined yards per
game. It's the air attack that's lifted the Cardinal so far
this season, though, as four different receivers have
caught at least 10 balls.
Kickoff returner T.J. Rushing ranks first in the nation
with a 41.8 yard average per return, including a 99-yard
runback for a touchdown.
The Cardinal hosts Washington tomorrow before a
pair of intriguing road matchups against Notre Dame
and Washington State that should reveal a lot about the
team's possibilities this year.
Oregon
The Ducks (1-2) have somewhat of a depleted squad
this season after producing talent-stocked teams for
years. They suffered an embarrassing home loss to Indi
ana to open the season and couldn't keep up with No. 2
Oklahoma, although they did blow out a winless Idaho
team last weekend.
Junior Kellen Clemens has performed respectably at
quarterback, throwing for 218 yards per game and seven
touchdowns against three interceptions. However, he's

been sacked seven times and is working with a number of
inexperienced receivers.
The Ducks' defense is yielding 23.7 points per game,
seventh in the Pac-10. having totaled just two sacks and
two interceptions so far this season.
The speedy Terrence Whitehead is averaging 5.7
yards per carry and ranks third on the team with nine re
ceptions. He should continue to be one of the focal points
of the Ducks' offense as a runner and a receiver.
Oregon hosts Arizona State in the Ducks' conference
opener this weekend before traveling to Washington
State. A win in either contest would be a big accomplish
ment for the Ducks.
Oregon State
The Beavers (1-3, 0-1) went 8-5 last year for Dennis
Erickson, including a win in the Las Vegas Bowl, but
they're off to a tough start this year. A brutal non-con
ference schedule handed the Beavers three road losses,
all against ranked teams, and the team had to fight to get
past a gritty New Mexico squad at home.
Six-foot-six Derek Anderson, in his senior season, re
mains a hit-or-miss quarterback. He passes for 325 yards
per game — by far the best mark in the Pac-10 — but
he's also the runaway leader in pass attempts (192) and
interceptions thrown (seven). In other words, he ranks
first in passing yards and even in all-purpose yards, but
ranks 10th in passing efficiency.
His favorite target, former walk-on Mike Hass, has
been deadly ever since torching Stanford for 225 yards
and two scores last year. He leads the Pac-10 in recep
tions (36) and receiving yards (575) and has scored four
times.
Steven Jackson's departure for the NFL hit the pro
gram hard, but Dwight Wright has done his best as a fill
in, averaging 64.2 yards per game and scoring twice.
Sabby Piscitellli leads the always-tenacious defense with
three interceptions.
The Beavers host Cal this weekend before playing
Washington. Washington State and Arizona — a trio of
games that could give the Beavers an opportunity to
move up in the conference standings.
Arizona
The Wildcats' lone win came against Northern Ari
zona, but they played two ranked teams — Utah and
Wisconsin — very tough, and lost to Washington State
by just one points last week.
The Wildcats (1-3, 0-1) are led by new head coach
Mike Stoops. Sophomore Kris Heavner runs a conserva
tive offense, having thrown only four touchdowns and
one interception.
Mike Bell is the main option on the ground, averaging
4.0 yards per game, while Syndric Steptoe has totaled 222
receiving yards and three touchdowns already. Kicker
Nick Folk has shown a capable leg, connecting on four
of-six field goals from a variety of distances.
Up next for the Wildcats are UCLA and Oregon on
the road, two teams Arizona probably needs to beat if it
wants to keep its bowl hopes alive, given its tough sea
son-ending schedule.
Washington
Coach Keith Gilbertson has admitted that this will be
a tough, rebuilding year for the Huskies (0-3, 0-1), who
have long been among the best teams in the Pac-10.
However, stricken by graduation and injuries to their
top three receivers this year, the Huskies seem a longshot
to equal last year's 6-6 record.
Casey Paus and freshman Carl Bonnell (who will start
this weekend) have both completed well under 50 per
cent of their passes while throwing four interceptions and
just two touchdowns. Kenny James leads the ground
game with 4.4 yards per carry and two scores.
The beleaguered defense yields 36.7 points per game,
by far the worst mark in the Pac-10.
The Huskies play at Stanford this weekend before
hosting a 1-2 San Jose State team, which should be a con
fidence booster for the inexperienced Huskies.


LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily
Despite letting a shocking upset slip away against No. 1 USC, Stanford remains optimistic about its chances in Pac
-10 play thanks in part to a much-improved passing game led by sophomore quarterback Trent Edwards.
