# Against Cal, men's soccer just hoping to start Pac-10 season on the right foot
## 
### JESSICA PETERS MANAGING EDITOR 
Forget what people say about the rivalry, about
the never-dying Cardinal desire to beat Cal. Forget
that they say a win over the Golden Bears means a lit
tle something extra; forget about the California /
Stanford battle for the Gauntlet.
Truth is, beating No. 10 California (7-0-1) doesn't
mean anything more to the unranked Stanford men's
soccer team (5-1-2) than beating Oregon State, or
Washington or UCLA.
A win over the Golden Bears tonight would mean
only one thing: a strong start to a grueling Pacific-10
Conference schedule.
And really, that's something the Cardinal desper
ately need.
Conference play was a thorn in the side of the 2003
Stanford squad, as the team ended the season with a
0-10-0 Pac-10 record and was outscored in those con

tests 20-4.
Now that the Cardinal are a victory away from
doubling are 2003 win total, it seems that the shadows
of last season are long gone. But the team will still
have a tricky job to do tonight against an undefeated
California squad — and the Cardinal have the disad
vantage of coming off of a scoreless weekend.
Stanford fell out of the Top 25 over the weekend
after the team played to a 0-0 tie with Brown and
chalked up its first loss of the season to Santa Clara.
The loss came as a result of a few costly mistakes
— and the Golden Bears are just the kind of team
that will punch through defenders if the slightest
error is made. Cal returned its starting 11 this season,
allowing the Bears to build upon the team that ad
vanced to the second round of the NCAA Tourna
ment last year.
