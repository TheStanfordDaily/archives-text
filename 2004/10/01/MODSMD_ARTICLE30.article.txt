# Against Cal, men's soccer just hoping to start Pac-10 season on the right foot
## 
### JESSICA PETERS MANAGING EDITOR 
Forget what people say about the rivalry, about
the never-dying Cardinal desire to beat Cal. Forget
that they say a win over the Golden Bears means a lit
tle something extra; forget about the California /
Stanford battle for the Gauntlet.
Truth is, beating No. 10 California (7-0-1) doesn't
mean anything more to the unranked Stanford men's
soccer team (5-1-2) than beating Oregon State, or
Washington or UCLA.
A win over the Golden Bears tonight would mean
only one thing: a strong start to a grueling Pacific-10
Conference schedule.
And really, that's something the Cardinal desper
ately need.
Conference play was a thorn in the side of the 2003
Stanford squad, as the team ended the season with a
0-10-0 Pac-10 record and was outscored in those con

tests 20-4.
Now that the Cardinal are a victory away from
doubling are 2003 win total, it seems that the shadows
of last season are long gone. But the team will still
have a tricky job to do tonight against an undefeated
California squad — and the Cardinal have the disad
vantage of coming off of a scoreless weekend.
Stanford fell out of the Top 25 over the weekend
after the team played to a 0-0 tie with Brown and
chalked up its first loss of the season to Santa Clara.
The loss came as a result of a few costly mistakes
— and the Golden Bears are just the kind of team
that will punch through defenders if the slightest
error is made. Cal returned its starting 11 this season,
allowing the Bears to build upon the team that ad
vanced to the second round of the NCAA Tourna
ment last year.
Forward Carl Acosta and midfielder Mike
Munoz are the key offensive threats back for the
Golden Bears. Acosta, a 5-foot-4 senior and the
team's most dangerous attacking player, led the
squad last season with 21 points off of nine goals
and three assists —and he already has three goals
this year. Munoz, a senior, ran the midfield for
Cal and paced the squad with 49 shots in 2003,
while racking up 10 points.
While containing these players will be key to
the Cardinal's chances, you can't win if you can't
score, and getting past the Cal defense takes
more than a wink and a smile. It'll certainly take
more scoring opportunities than the Cardinal put
together against Santa Clara and Brown.
After last weekend's scoring struggle, Stan
ford senior Aaron Maines predicted a long week
of working on moving the ball in the attacking
third.
"We need to work on runs and patterns, get
ting those into the guy's heads," the defender

said. "We're going to need to feed the ball in bet
ter to [senior striker Darren Fernandez]: we need
to create more chances."
If the Cardinal can do that, they still have to
contend with Cal's strong goalkeeping unit.
Sophomore Mike Osguera, who went 9-6-2 in
goal last year with seven shutouts, has been un
seated for the time being by junior Eric Kron
berg. The 6-foot-4 transfer from Fresno State has
allowed only two goals on the season in seven
complete games.
Despite all of California's weapons on the
field, the Cardinal have just as many players to
match, and if they can put behind last week's set
back. Stanford has a chance to bring the Bears'
momentum to a screeching halt.
And at least in the Pac-10, momentum is a pre
cious commodity.
The Cardinal and Golden Bears will face off
tonight at 7 p.m. at Maloney Field.
