### TOM HANADA TAM VO INTERMISSION EDITORS 
At last, the perfect tandem for
Intermission editors. One is Tarn.
One is Tom. One is Asian. One is

only half Asian. One was your edi
tor last volume of Intermission and

the Sum me r
Weekly (she
seems to enjoy
journalistic
masochism).
The other
knows nothing
about journal
istic style and
thus is horribly
unqualified
for this job.
And together
we will pre
vent Intermis
sion from tum
bling over the
cliff of failure

without using the word "端ber."
We know that all you freshmen.

transfers and other people who
never read The Daily are asking the
same questions: What the fuck is
Intermission? Can you really use
the F-bomb in print? And why am I
reading The Daily on a Friday?

To put it
simply. Inter
mission is
cooler than
"your mom"
jokes and
more infor
mative than
dead baby
jokes. We are
the massive
eight-page
(sometimes
12 page, when
we're feeling
bulbous),
usually week
ly enema that
Stanford stu
dents so des
perately need

(warning: use of Intermission as an
enema may result in bleeding). Within

these weekly pages, you will find all
the reasons you need to live. We strive

to educate the public about things that
kick ass and tilings that simply suck ass
(like your mom). Entertainment, art
and fashion will all find a home here to
be glorified, ridiculed and critiqued by
a jury of your peers.
So what does your $150,000 edu
cation buy you? A crapload of I-
I lum books and course guides, that's
for sure. But that's not all! We'll
bring you exclusive interviews with
artists, musicians, style mavens and
filmmakers. We'll flout journalistic
standards and challenge codes of
ethics. We'll give you the best op
portunities to lose your virginity
while still in college under the guid
ance of our trusty resident sex god
dess, Roxy Sass. We'll explore the
nether regions of Stanford culture,
the seedy underbelly of Entertain
ment and ves, all the shit that doesn't

classify as either. All without the use
of parentheses. (Pretend that you

don't see
this set that
is mocking
us, mocking
us oh so
dearly!).
Now just
sit back and
enjoy our
little world
of random
ass titles,
question
able advice,
articles by
overquali
fied writers
and semi
constant re
in i 11 d e r s
that pop cul
ture will al
ways have a

home in Intermission.
But our greatest fear is that some
day, the Man will crack down on us and
force us to conform to the politically

correct, standardized Times New
Roman block-like layout and factu-

ally accurate articles that the Daily
is so famous for.
Until then, let the Asian jokes
commence. Unless ...
