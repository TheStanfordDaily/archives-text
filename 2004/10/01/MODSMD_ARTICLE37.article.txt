### JIM MOSQUEDA INTERMISSION COUCH POTATO 
Now that "The Amazing Race"
is over and the summer of Charla
has passed, it's time to turn our at
tention to fall TV. These next five
shows are the best combination of
entertaining study-breaks, guilty
indulgences and outright plea
sures on the tube right now.
I) "The Apprentice" — If
you're not watching the second
season of television's best reality
show, you're even crazier than Sta
cie J. Sure, The Donald seems to be
playing up the boardroom drama
for ratings this season, but hey, it's
still better than most reality crap
on TV, like the lame Apprentice
rip-off "The Benefactor." (Thurs
days at 9 p.m. on NBC)
2. "Lost" — JJ Abrams has
consistently put out the best TV
in the last several years, such as
"Alias" and the late, great "Felic
ity." "Lost" is his latest and most
ambitious project yet: survivors
of a plane crash marooned on an
island in the middle of nowhere
and being stalked by a giant, un
seen beast. No, it's not the Skip
per ... at least I don't think it is.
(Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on ABC)
3) "American Dreams" — Now
in its third season, this l%os-era
drama is a true delight. Teenage
Meg Pryor and her family's journey
through the Best Decade Ever is
earnest yet never schmaltzy. Why
take the Visions of the 1960s class
when you can just watch this show?
Well, it's either this or the"The
Simpsons," and that shit hasn't
been funny since the last decade.
(Sundays at 8 p.m. on NBC)
4) "Jack & Bobby" — In the fu
ture one brother will be president,
but until then you can watch him
geek his way through high school
in this new show. The name may
bring to mind the Kennedy broth
ers, but this show is more family
drama than political Dynasty.
Christine Lahti is clutch as the
neurotic, pot-smoking mother.
And the future flashforwards (ver
sus flashbacks to the past) drop
clues that force viewers to connect
the dots between present and fu
ture. Now if only they hadn't given
it all away in the first episode.
(Sundays at 9 p.m. on The WB)
5) "The Surreal Life" — When I
say "reality crap" I mean shows
