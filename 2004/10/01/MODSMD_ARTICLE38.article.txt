### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
Whether you've been locked in
a concrete jungle or trapped in a
class case of emotion, chances are

you've missed some of
summer's best flicks. If so,
let's take some time to re
view:
Best of the best
"Spiderman 2" — The
film deserves two enthusi
astic thumbs up. Fine fam
ily fun. Is it better than the
original? Ouite possibly.
Can we expect to see a
third film? As long as
there's cash to be had and
Spidey video games and
action figures to be sold,
I'd say you can bank on it.
"Harry Potter and the
Prisoner of Azkaban" —
More misadventures from
those loveable British
Hogwarts kids. Won't they
ever learn — time travel is
not to be tampered with.
Maybe they're too young
to have seen those "Back
to the Future" movies.
"Anchorman" — Will
Farrell strikes again and

scores with his super-snazzy leg
end of Ron Burgundy. The movie
single-handedly brings back the
career of Christina Applegate, as

well as the popularity of unicorns
in love scenes.
"Napoleon Dynamite" — If
you were ever a dork in middle
school, high school, now or antici-

pate being a dork in the future,
you will get this movie. It perfectly
captures what it feels like to be an
awkward teen searching for accep

tance and a better hair-do. Best
movie I've seen in a long time. Pe
riod. Pedro for President.
"Garden State" — After a
summer of frivolous fare like "The

Stepford Wives," the darling of
Sundance hits you like a sucker
punch of emotion. Natalie Port
man makes an incredibly quirky

and endearing Jersey girl and
writer / director Zach Braff (aka
"that guy from 'Scrubs' ") proves
he's able to tap into the cerebral
consciousness of a too often zom
biefied mass America.

Honorable mentions
"Harold and Kumar go to
White Castle" — An up
lifting tale of woe and de
spair, as one man's search
for quality pot gets two
friends entangled in a
night of debauchery and
misadventure.Doogie
Howser guest stars. Sure to
leave you feeling high ...
on life. Anybody hungry?
"The Bourne Suprema
cy" — Surprisingly sus
penseful. Matt Damon re
turns as Jason Bourne, that
memory-challenged ex-se
cret agent who, yet again,
has no idea why other se
cret agents are trying to
kill him. Julia Stiles finally
gets to say a few lines.
"Dodgeball" — For an
hour and a half about bona
fide losers playing a
"sport" often dominated
by the likes of third
graders, the film was sur-

prisingly not that painful to watch.
Vince Vaughn makes himself out

Man, this movie really blew. The white chicks were black guys. Not that we have anything
against black guys. But, you know, we had our hopes up. For white chicks. I want a refund.
to be quite a nice guy, and Ben
Stiller takes every opportunity
to prove he'll do anything fora
laugh. Yes, even put a slice of
pizza down his pants.
"Wimbledon" — Looking fora
cute romantic comedy about tennis
and British people? As far as feath
er-light romances go, the film has
enough charm to stay in the game,
even if it's not exactly an ace.
And a few films we wish we
hadn't seen:
"King Arthur" — A lot of
lighting, some snow, a couple of
men in ugly fur coats and then
some more fighting. Don't you
hate it when you go to the
movies for sex and violence and
only get violence?
"White Chicks" — They're
not white. They're not chicks. I
want a refund.
"Vanity Fair" — There is no way
the novel could be as long as this film.
It certainly can't be as boring.

to prove he'll do anything fora
laugh. Yes, even put a slice of
pizza down his pants.
"Wimbledon" — Looking fora
cute romantic comedy about tennis
and British people? As far as feath
er-light romances go, the film has
enough charm to stay in the game,
even if it's not exactly an ace.
And a few films we wish we
hadn't seen:
"King Arthur" — A lot of
lighting, some snow, a couple of
men in ugly fur coats and then
some more fighting. Don't you
hate it when you go to the
movies for sex and violence and
only get violence?
"White Chicks" — They're
not white. They're not chicks. I
want a refund.
"Vanity Fair" — There is no way
the novel could be as long as this film.
It certainly can't be as boring.
