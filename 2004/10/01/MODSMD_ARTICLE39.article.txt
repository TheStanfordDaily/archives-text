### ANNA NORTH INTERMISSION POP CULTURE COLUMNIST 
My mom is worried about my
brother. This time, it isn't his text
messaging habit or his refusal to eat
anything prepared in our home —
it's his obsession with ESPN's
"World Series of Poker." I try to help
my mom out at times like this, as part

of an ongoing apology for certain
events that involved me. So it was out
of filial duty that I parked myself in
front of the TV to evaluate her fears.
I don't know much about
poker, but that turned out to be
just fine. Like the Olympics, the
WSOP isn't just about the game.
It's also about the personalities.
Take Greg Raymer. This man
looks as though he was molded out

of mashed potatoes, so it's lucky he
has a couple of tricks. One is sheer
orneriness. The other is a pair of
round Lennon glasses with a holo
gram of an orange pair of eyes.
In tournament play, these glass
es skirt the line between a great
idea and completely ridiculous.
Coincidentally, this is also the line
on which the WSOP exists.
ESPN makes some attempt to

pass poker off as a legitimate
sport. A display at the bottom of
the screen shows the viewer not
only what is in each player's hand,
but the odds — in percent —of
each player's triumph. Commen
tators Norman Chad and Louis
McEanhern helpfully interpret
these odds, as well as telling you
which cards each player needs to
win. "Pocket cams" give a play
er's-eye-view of the cards, while a
special "rabbit cam" hides under
the table.
What all this business fails to con
ceal — and you do get the sense that
the folks at ESPN aren't really trying
— is that the contenders sometimes
behave more like children than ath
letes. Unlike, say. pole vaulting,
poker allows its players extensive
face time with one another. They
mostly use it to bicker or to half
heartedly apologize for bickering so
they can bicker some more.
Savs one announcer, "I'm tired

Cashin' in the chips ain't always easy

of seeing guys act like punks and
then apologize for it afterward."
Luckily for ESPN, viewers don't
agree. 1.5 million households
watched the 2004 WSOP finale on
Sept. 14. By way of comparison,
consider that only 318,000 watched
the World Cup Hockey quarterfi
nal the same night on ESPN2
(source: http://si.com). The U.S.
hockey team could probably re
duce Greg Raymer to his compo
nent starches, but he'd trounce
them in a popularity contest. Part
of that is KSPN's lack of preten
sion. The WSOP includes some
Olympics-style human-interest
spots, but they're mercifully short
on triumphs over adversity. Its just
a card game, after all — they can't

get away with that noble-persever
ance crap.
What they can and do get away
with is getting some guys together,
offering up a lot of money — the
first-place winner takes home $5 mil
lion— and letting them go at each
other. If the formula sounds awfully
familiar, that's because it is. The
WSOP is basically a reality show.
But unlike the kinds of reality
shows that give critics recurring
nightmares, it doesn't make you
feel that your moral fiber is being
shredded. For one thing, it's not try
ing to manufacture stars. Greg
Raymer entered the contest as a
patent attorney, and when he
leaves, the most he'll be is a very
rich patent attorney. Perhaps more

importantly, and surprisingly, it's
got a certain sense of purpose.
Yes, the guys fight. They say
they're sorry. They fight again.
But you understand — and if you
don't, the announcers will explain
— that all this isn't quite the
point. Eventually, they've got to
play cards. It's not noble, but —
unlike eating rats or singing show
tunes in front of nasty judges —
it's fun.
Last year, my brother was
hooked on "American Idol," where
a few B-list celebrities relentlessly
mocked all comers before launch
ing a lucky few into such career
making masterpieces as "From
Justin to Kelly." This year, I told
Mom not to worry.

looks as though he was molded out

of mashed potatoes, so it's lucky he
has a couple of tricks. One is sheer
orneriness. The other is a pair of
round Lennon glasses with a holo
gram of an orange pair of eyes.
In tournament play, these glass
es skirt the line between a great
idea and completely ridiculous.
Coincidentally, this is also the line
on which the WSOP exists.
ESPN makes some attempt to

pass poker off as a legitimate
sport. A display at the bottom of
the screen shows the viewer not
only what is in each player's hand,
but the odds — in percent —of
each player's triumph. Commen
tators Norman Chad and Louis
McEanhern helpfully interpret
these odds, as well as telling you
which cards each player needs to
win. "Pocket cams" give a play
er's-eye-view of the cards, while a
special "rabbit cam" hides under
the table.
What all this business fails to con
ceal — and you do get the sense that
the folks at ESPN aren't really trying
— is that the contenders sometimes
behave more like children than ath
letes. Unlike, say. pole vaulting,
poker allows its players extensive
face time with one another. They
mostly use it to bicker or to half
heartedly apologize for bickering so
they can bicker some more.
Savs one announcer, "I'm tired

Cashin' in the chips ain't always easy

of seeing guys act like punks and
then apologize for it afterward."
Luckily for ESPN, viewers don't
agree. 1.5 million households
watched the 2004 WSOP finale on
Sept. 14. By way of comparison,
consider that only 318,000 watched
the World Cup Hockey quarterfi
nal the same night on ESPN2
(source: http://si.com). The U.S.
hockey team could probably re
duce Greg Raymer to his compo
nent starches, but he'd trounce
them in a popularity contest. Part
of that is KSPN's lack of preten
sion. The WSOP includes some
Olympics-style human-interest
spots, but they're mercifully short
on triumphs over adversity. Its just
a card game, after all — they can't

get away with that noble-persever
ance crap.
What they can and do get away
with is getting some guys together,
offering up a lot of money — the
first-place winner takes home $5 mil
lion— and letting them go at each
other. If the formula sounds awfully
familiar, that's because it is. The
WSOP is basically a reality show.
But unlike the kinds of reality
shows that give critics recurring
nightmares, it doesn't make you
feel that your moral fiber is being
shredded. For one thing, it's not try
ing to manufacture stars. Greg
Raymer entered the contest as a
patent attorney, and when he
leaves, the most he'll be is a very
rich patent attorney. Perhaps more

importantly, and surprisingly, it's
got a certain sense of purpose.
Yes, the guys fight. They say
they're sorry. They fight again.
But you understand — and if you
don't, the announcers will explain
— that all this isn't quite the
point. Eventually, they've got to
play cards. It's not noble, but —
unlike eating rats or singing show
tunes in front of nasty judges —
it's fun.
Last year, my brother was
hooked on "American Idol," where
a few B-list celebrities relentlessly
mocked all comers before launch
ing a lucky few into such career
making masterpieces as "From
Justin to Kelly." This year, I told
Mom not to worry.
