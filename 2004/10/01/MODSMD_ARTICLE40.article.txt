## Kerry Conran discusses directing 'Sky Captain' 
### ALICE KIM INTERMISSION WRITER 
Not every filmmaker gels to revolutionize film on his or her
first venture out, but Kerry Conran, writer and director of
"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is doing his best,
even though his true allegiance is to the black-and-white cine
ma of yore.
"Sky Captain" is almost entirely computer-generated, pop
ulated with real, in-the-llcsh actors. But despite its highly mod
ern conception, "Sky Captain" is a dreamy throwback to the
science fiction and noir films of the thirties and forties. Its fa
miiiar yet stylized lix>k adorns a story rife with mad scientists,
zeppelins, and ray guns — pure pulp never looked so tasty.
INTERMISSION: Which films had the greatest influence on
"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"?
KERRY CONRAN: The film that I probably reference the
most for this movie, strangely, is a film cidled "The Third Man."
With Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, directed by Carol Reed. It
was a film that 1 looked at for the tone, and the way the charac
ters were portrayed. To some extent, even the visuals—it's a
really beautiful film. That film provided a sort of dramatic tone
for the film, but King Kong was probably the smelling salt for
me as a kid that made me kind of wake up to movies and made
me feel like 1 wanted to make them. That certainly played a
role in influencing various things in this film.
As a lateral kind of move, 1 discovered early German cine
ma —the films of Fritz Lang and Mumau, certainly "Metrop
olis," and "Dr. Mabusc" - that had a very vivid kind of influence
in terms of the visual design of the film. Also, there was a car
toon series that the Fleisher brothers made of Superman, a car
toon in the thirties and forties, and that was the first kind of at
tempt to bring that sort of pulp sensibility to life. 1 don't think
they've been rivaled since then. They're an amazing combina
tion of science fiction and film noir.
And lastly, the serials of that era — Commander Cody and
King of the Rockelmen to Dick Tracey to Captain Marvel —
and all those things were stiired up into a big soup and this film
emerged as a result of that.
INT: One thing that really struck me about the film was how it
incorporated almost every thirties and forties pulp scenario
imaginable — for instance, Shangri-La and Art Deco New
York City. While you were developing this story and plot, did
you consider the elements you wanted to include, or did it come
about more naturally?
KC: It did emerge more naturally than anything else. When I
was writing, I didn't think, "I'll put King Kong in," or this and
that; I was just telling a story. It was influenced, certainly,
whether through osmosis or consciously, from those very
sources. It was really during the design phases that, since we
had greater control and could treat every frame like it was a
painting or an illustration, we started to incorporate some of
those things. Given that those were the kinds of films we were
most trying to emulate, it was only common sense that you'd
examine those films and look at them.
That's when we started to go a little loony and add refer
ences to those films, like — we're nerds, but we sunk the ship
that carried King Kong back, called the Venture, and we put it
underwater. For the five people that see it and appreciate it.it
makes as happy, but that kind of stuff is peppered throughout
the film; it's not intended to take away from the film or distract
you, because I don't think you'd even notice it unless you look

lor it. But that did evolve as we made the film, rather than being
a conscious decision from the start.
INT: It seems that you had an extremely clear idea of the set
ting and background for "Sky Captain," but what did you en
vision in terms of the actors?
KC: Probably Cary Grant and Jean Arthur. For Dex, 1 proba
bly had me in mind. | Laughs]. But that's what my mindset was.
I sat down and thought about the film in the sense that 1 was liv
ing in 1 939, and 1 was merely making a film. Those were the ac
tors I almost felt I had at my disposal, and that's what the script
is really patterned after, those are the voices I tried to hear for
the dialogue. Visually as well, 1 tried to represent the film in that
regard — not so much to create a modern interpretation of it,
but to literally try to create something like if they had the tools
available that I was using. What would Orson Welles have
made, back in '39, if he made a science fiction film? That was
the approach.
INT: Is that why you used Olivier as Dr. Totenkopf?
KC: Olivier -1 wish I could take credit for that. I should start
taking credit for that, but it was Jude Law's idea, actually. We
were going to cast just an actor for that part. We were shoot
ing in London and Jude came up to me and said, "I know who
can play Totenkopf," and I said, "Who?" and he said, "Lau
rence Olivier."
It wasn't lost cm me that he was dead. But I thought it was a great
idea. Whether we used him or Boris Karioff or someone from that
era, it was an inspired idea, because in the context of the film it made
sense. So I think Jude actually picked up on the spirit of the film, in
a way. And then we set about trying to bring him to life.
INT: 1 thought that the tone of "Sky Captain" was really well
balanced—it wasn't ironic and schlocky. How did you go
about modernizing an essentially pulpy film without losing the
fun of it, the sense of wonder?
KC: That was the tricky part, honestly, because we never
wanted to create a parody, because 1 take comic books seri
ously. It was an attempt to kind of treat this as a very realistic
setting but not lose the fun involved. We certainly looked at
films -1 won't name any films — but that were less successful,
in my estimation. Not less successful, but they made the choice
to make it more tongue-in-cheek or campy. And then I looked
at films that actually went to the dark side, where they became
an oppressively bleak kind of thing. We tried to straddle that,
so that you had humor that provides humanity, in a way, cou
pled with some sense of dnima, some sense of playing the
whole situation quite straight. and tried to balance the two. I'm
glad that's what you think that's what we did; it really was
something we desperately tried to do. It was very important
for the film to not sink into the depths of parody.
INT: "Sky Captain" has been a long time in the making — how
did you start as a filmmaker, and what was involved in getting
this film made?
KC: 1 grew up in Flint, Michigan, so first I just escaped from
there and realized there was a world outside of that. I found
myself in California, went to a school called CalArts. When
I graduated, 1 realized that I was just as far away from getting
a chance to make a movie as 1 was in Flint, Michigan, just be
cause of the expense involved. So about two years after 1
graduated, 1 noticed that the emerging technology was capa

blc d 1 doing amazing tilings. The software that was available,
which used to be in the millions of dollars, was suddenly at
my fingertips.
CalArts has a strong tradition of traditional animation, and
1 recognized that the computer might be used in the same way
that an animation stand is used for animation, applied to live ac
tion. In a way, 1 thought that 1 could treat the live actors in the
same way you would with Bugs Bunny cartoons. For the next
four years, I sat down to actually make this entire film, but 1
only had six minutes. So I cried uncle and looked for help.
Thai's when Jon Avnet got involved as producer, and shortly
thereafter, Jude Law and Gwyneth Pattrow became involved,
and we finally had a budget. That only took six more years. So
the whole process was a ten year journey to this point, which is
sort of amazing, thinking back on it.
INT: What kind of effect do you think this film will have on
Hollywood special effects in general?
KG 1 think that this film was an evolutionary step more than
anything else, in that it leveraged the techniques that were used
historically, and we just took it to the extreme conclusion. What
we discovered by doing a film this way was that you could dras
tically reduce the cost involved. It also gives you incredible con
trol over the imagery.
But I also don't think it's for everyone. I think it's applicable
to any genre, though. It certainly doesn't have to look the way
this film does — I think it can be a benefit to people who want
to make a very intimate little film set in Paris, but can't afford
to fly there. What it most represents, though, isn't so much for
Hollywood.
It's mostly the independent filmmakers who typically have
nothing. These techniques might finally level the playing field
a little bit, where with <m iMac and Photoshop and Aceffects,
you can create something that rivals what studios could do just
a couple years ago. If anything comes out of this film, it might
serve as a template for that, for other people to take a chance
and realize what's in their head.
INT: This may or may not be true — I had read somewhere
that although you recreated New York City in "Sky Captain,"
you had never actually visited the city when you started mak
ing the film.
KC: That's mostly true. I had made one trip there, about eight
years ago, but it was principally Radio City that I had never
been inside, to this day. So the sequence when they walk into
the lobby and the theater — 1 don't know what that looks like.
I sent our D.P. to New York, where they took photos. Prior to
that, out of books, 1 got the vague dimensions of Radio City and
we built it in the computer. I lramed the shots on this little vir
tual set, so they were armed with my little animatics. and they
went to New York and shot photos that loosely approximated
the backgrounds that we needed. Then we pieced it together
from that. I've been to New York since then, but not inside
Radio City.
INT: Do you think it helped you to conceive of New York as
more of a fantasy city?
KG In a way, yes. 1 think that my goal was to create the ideal
ized image of New York City, sort of the fairy tale version of it
— the thing that probably inspired Gotham City from "Bat
man," and "Metropolis," and "Superman" — so this was that
little childlike version of New York City, in a way, concocted by
somelxxly who had no idea what it looked like.

little childlike version of New York City, in a way, concocted by
somelxxly who had no idea what it looked like.
Not every filmmaker gels to revolutionize film on his or her
first venture out, but Kerry Conran, writer and director of
"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is doing his best,
even though his true allegiance is to the black-and-white cine
ma of yore.
"Sky Captain" is almost entirely computer-generated, pop
ulated with real, in-the-llcsh actors. But despite its highly mod
ern conception, "Sky Captain" is a dreamy throwback to the
science fiction and noir films of the thirties and forties. Its fa
miiiar yet stylized lix>k adorns a story rife with mad scientists,
zeppelins, and ray guns — pure pulp never looked so tasty.
INTERMISSION: Which films had the greatest influence on
"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"?
KERRY CONRAN: The film that I probably reference the
most for this movie, strangely, is a film cidled "The Third Man."
With Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, directed by Carol Reed. It
was a film that 1 looked at for the tone, and the way the charac
ters were portrayed. To some extent, even the visuals—it's a
really beautiful film. That film provided a sort of dramatic tone
for the film, but King Kong was probably the smelling salt for
me as a kid that made me kind of wake up to movies and made
me feel like 1 wanted to make them. That certainly played a
role in influencing various things in this film.
As a lateral kind of move, 1 discovered early German cine
ma —the films of Fritz Lang and Mumau, certainly "Metrop
olis," and "Dr. Mabusc" - that had a very vivid kind of influence
in terms of the visual design of the film. Also, there was a car
toon series that the Fleisher brothers made of Superman, a car
toon in the thirties and forties, and that was the first kind of at
tempt to bring that sort of pulp sensibility to life. 1 don't think
they've been rivaled since then. They're an amazing combina
tion of science fiction and film noir.
And lastly, the serials of that era — Commander Cody and
King of the Rockelmen to Dick Tracey to Captain Marvel —
and all those things were stiired up into a big soup and this film
emerged as a result of that.
INT: One thing that really struck me about the film was how it
incorporated almost every thirties and forties pulp scenario
imaginable — for instance, Shangri-La and Art Deco New
York City. While you were developing this story and plot, did
you consider the elements you wanted to include, or did it come
about more naturally?
KC: It did emerge more naturally than anything else. When I
was writing, I didn't think, "I'll put King Kong in," or this and
that; I was just telling a story. It was influenced, certainly,
whether through osmosis or consciously, from those very
sources. It was really during the design phases that, since we
had greater control and could treat every frame like it was a
painting or an illustration, we started to incorporate some of
those things. Given that those were the kinds of films we were
most trying to emulate, it was only common sense that you'd
examine those films and look at them.
That's when we started to go a little loony and add refer
ences to those films, like — we're nerds, but we sunk the ship
that carried King Kong back, called the Venture, and we put it
underwater. For the five people that see it and appreciate it.it
makes as happy, but that kind of stuff is peppered throughout
the film; it's not intended to take away from the film or distract
you, because I don't think you'd even notice it unless you look

lor it. But that did evolve as we made the film, rather than being
a conscious decision from the start.
INT: It seems that you had an extremely clear idea of the set
ting and background for "Sky Captain," but what did you en
vision in terms of the actors?
KC: Probably Cary Grant and Jean Arthur. For Dex, 1 proba
bly had me in mind. | Laughs]. But that's what my mindset was.
I sat down and thought about the film in the sense that 1 was liv
ing in 1 939, and 1 was merely making a film. Those were the ac
tors I almost felt I had at my disposal, and that's what the script
is really patterned after, those are the voices I tried to hear for
the dialogue. Visually as well, 1 tried to represent the film in that
regard — not so much to create a modern interpretation of it,
but to literally try to create something like if they had the tools
available that I was using. What would Orson Welles have
made, back in '39, if he made a science fiction film? That was
the approach.
INT: Is that why you used Olivier as Dr. Totenkopf?
KC: Olivier -1 wish I could take credit for that. I should start
taking credit for that, but it was Jude Law's idea, actually. We
were going to cast just an actor for that part. We were shoot
ing in London and Jude came up to me and said, "I know who
can play Totenkopf," and I said, "Who?" and he said, "Lau
rence Olivier."
It wasn't lost cm me that he was dead. But I thought it was a great
idea. Whether we used him or Boris Karioff or someone from that
era, it was an inspired idea, because in the context of the film it made
sense. So I think Jude actually picked up on the spirit of the film, in
a way. And then we set about trying to bring him to life.
INT: 1 thought that the tone of "Sky Captain" was really well
balanced—it wasn't ironic and schlocky. How did you go
about modernizing an essentially pulpy film without losing the
fun of it, the sense of wonder?
KC: That was the tricky part, honestly, because we never
wanted to create a parody, because 1 take comic books seri
ously. It was an attempt to kind of treat this as a very realistic
setting but not lose the fun involved. We certainly looked at
films -1 won't name any films — but that were less successful,
in my estimation. Not less successful, but they made the choice
to make it more tongue-in-cheek or campy. And then I looked
at films that actually went to the dark side, where they became
an oppressively bleak kind of thing. We tried to straddle that,
so that you had humor that provides humanity, in a way, cou
pled with some sense of dnima, some sense of playing the
whole situation quite straight. and tried to balance the two. I'm
glad that's what you think that's what we did; it really was
something we desperately tried to do. It was very important
for the film to not sink into the depths of parody.
INT: "Sky Captain" has been a long time in the making — how
did you start as a filmmaker, and what was involved in getting
this film made?
KC: 1 grew up in Flint, Michigan, so first I just escaped from
there and realized there was a world outside of that. I found
myself in California, went to a school called CalArts. When
I graduated, 1 realized that I was just as far away from getting
a chance to make a movie as 1 was in Flint, Michigan, just be
cause of the expense involved. So about two years after 1
graduated, 1 noticed that the emerging technology was capa

blc d 1 doing amazing tilings. The software that was available,
which used to be in the millions of dollars, was suddenly at
my fingertips.
CalArts has a strong tradition of traditional animation, and
1 recognized that the computer might be used in the same way
that an animation stand is used for animation, applied to live ac
tion. In a way, 1 thought that 1 could treat the live actors in the
same way you would with Bugs Bunny cartoons. For the next
four years, I sat down to actually make this entire film, but 1
only had six minutes. So I cried uncle and looked for help.
Thai's when Jon Avnet got involved as producer, and shortly
thereafter, Jude Law and Gwyneth Pattrow became involved,
and we finally had a budget. That only took six more years. So
the whole process was a ten year journey to this point, which is
sort of amazing, thinking back on it.
INT: What kind of effect do you think this film will have on
Hollywood special effects in general?
KG 1 think that this film was an evolutionary step more than
anything else, in that it leveraged the techniques that were used
historically, and we just took it to the extreme conclusion. What
we discovered by doing a film this way was that you could dras
tically reduce the cost involved. It also gives you incredible con
trol over the imagery.
But I also don't think it's for everyone. I think it's applicable
to any genre, though. It certainly doesn't have to look the way
this film does — I think it can be a benefit to people who want
to make a very intimate little film set in Paris, but can't afford
to fly there. What it most represents, though, isn't so much for
Hollywood.
It's mostly the independent filmmakers who typically have
nothing. These techniques might finally level the playing field
a little bit, where with <m iMac and Photoshop and Aceffects,
you can create something that rivals what studios could do just
a couple years ago. If anything comes out of this film, it might
serve as a template for that, for other people to take a chance
and realize what's in their head.
INT: This may or may not be true — I had read somewhere
that although you recreated New York City in "Sky Captain,"
you had never actually visited the city when you started mak
ing the film.
KC: That's mostly true. I had made one trip there, about eight
years ago, but it was principally Radio City that I had never
been inside, to this day. So the sequence when they walk into
the lobby and the theater — 1 don't know what that looks like.
I sent our D.P. to New York, where they took photos. Prior to
that, out of books, 1 got the vague dimensions of Radio City and
we built it in the computer. I lramed the shots on this little vir
tual set, so they were armed with my little animatics. and they
went to New York and shot photos that loosely approximated
the backgrounds that we needed. Then we pieced it together
from that. I've been to New York since then, but not inside
Radio City.
INT: Do you think it helped you to conceive of New York as
more of a fantasy city?
KG In a way, yes. 1 think that my goal was to create the ideal
ized image of New York City, sort of the fairy tale version of it
— the thing that probably inspired Gotham City from "Bat
man," and "Metropolis," and "Superman" — so this was that
little childlike version of New York City, in a way, concocted by
somelxxly who had no idea what it looked like.

— the thing that probably inspired Gotham City from "Bat
man," and "Metropolis," and "Superman" — so this was that
little childlike version of New York City, in a way, concocted by
somelxxly who had no idea what it looked like.
Not every filmmaker gels to revolutionize film on his or her
first venture out, but Kerry Conran, writer and director of
"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is doing his best,
even though his true allegiance is to the black-and-white cine
ma of yore.
"Sky Captain" is almost entirely computer-generated, pop
ulated with real, in-the-llcsh actors. But despite its highly mod
ern conception, "Sky Captain" is a dreamy throwback to the
science fiction and noir films of the thirties and forties. Its fa
miiiar yet stylized lix>k adorns a story rife with mad scientists,
zeppelins, and ray guns — pure pulp never looked so tasty.
INTERMISSION: Which films had the greatest influence on
"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"?
KERRY CONRAN: The film that I probably reference the
most for this movie, strangely, is a film cidled "The Third Man."
With Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, directed by Carol Reed. It
was a film that 1 looked at for the tone, and the way the charac
ters were portrayed. To some extent, even the visuals—it's a
really beautiful film. That film provided a sort of dramatic tone
for the film, but King Kong was probably the smelling salt for
me as a kid that made me kind of wake up to movies and made
me feel like 1 wanted to make them. That certainly played a
role in influencing various things in this film.
As a lateral kind of move, 1 discovered early German cine
ma —the films of Fritz Lang and Mumau, certainly "Metrop
olis," and "Dr. Mabusc" - that had a very vivid kind of influence
in terms of the visual design of the film. Also, there was a car
toon series that the Fleisher brothers made of Superman, a car
toon in the thirties and forties, and that was the first kind of at
tempt to bring that sort of pulp sensibility to life. 1 don't think
they've been rivaled since then. They're an amazing combina
tion of science fiction and film noir.
And lastly, the serials of that era — Commander Cody and
King of the Rockelmen to Dick Tracey to Captain Marvel —
and all those things were stiired up into a big soup and this film
emerged as a result of that.
INT: One thing that really struck me about the film was how it
incorporated almost every thirties and forties pulp scenario
imaginable — for instance, Shangri-La and Art Deco New
York City. While you were developing this story and plot, did
you consider the elements you wanted to include, or did it come
about more naturally?
KC: It did emerge more naturally than anything else. When I
was writing, I didn't think, "I'll put King Kong in," or this and
that; I was just telling a story. It was influenced, certainly,
whether through osmosis or consciously, from those very
sources. It was really during the design phases that, since we
had greater control and could treat every frame like it was a
painting or an illustration, we started to incorporate some of
those things. Given that those were the kinds of films we were
most trying to emulate, it was only common sense that you'd
examine those films and look at them.
That's when we started to go a little loony and add refer
ences to those films, like — we're nerds, but we sunk the ship
that carried King Kong back, called the Venture, and we put it
underwater. For the five people that see it and appreciate it.it
makes as happy, but that kind of stuff is peppered throughout
the film; it's not intended to take away from the film or distract
you, because I don't think you'd even notice it unless you look

lor it. But that did evolve as we made the film, rather than being
a conscious decision from the start.
INT: It seems that you had an extremely clear idea of the set
ting and background for "Sky Captain," but what did you en
vision in terms of the actors?
KC: Probably Cary Grant and Jean Arthur. For Dex, 1 proba
bly had me in mind. | Laughs]. But that's what my mindset was.
I sat down and thought about the film in the sense that 1 was liv
ing in 1 939, and 1 was merely making a film. Those were the ac
tors I almost felt I had at my disposal, and that's what the script
is really patterned after, those are the voices I tried to hear for
the dialogue. Visually as well, 1 tried to represent the film in that
regard — not so much to create a modern interpretation of it,
but to literally try to create something like if they had the tools
available that I was using. What would Orson Welles have
made, back in '39, if he made a science fiction film? That was
the approach.
INT: Is that why you used Olivier as Dr. Totenkopf?
KC: Olivier -1 wish I could take credit for that. I should start
taking credit for that, but it was Jude Law's idea, actually. We
were going to cast just an actor for that part. We were shoot
ing in London and Jude came up to me and said, "I know who
can play Totenkopf," and I said, "Who?" and he said, "Lau
rence Olivier."
It wasn't lost cm me that he was dead. But I thought it was a great
idea. Whether we used him or Boris Karioff or someone from that
era, it was an inspired idea, because in the context of the film it made
sense. So I think Jude actually picked up on the spirit of the film, in
a way. And then we set about trying to bring him to life.
INT: 1 thought that the tone of "Sky Captain" was really well
balanced—it wasn't ironic and schlocky. How did you go
about modernizing an essentially pulpy film without losing the
fun of it, the sense of wonder?
KC: That was the tricky part, honestly, because we never
wanted to create a parody, because 1 take comic books seri
ously. It was an attempt to kind of treat this as a very realistic
setting but not lose the fun involved. We certainly looked at
films -1 won't name any films — but that were less successful,
in my estimation. Not less successful, but they made the choice
to make it more tongue-in-cheek or campy. And then I looked
at films that actually went to the dark side, where they became
an oppressively bleak kind of thing. We tried to straddle that,
so that you had humor that provides humanity, in a way, cou
pled with some sense of dnima, some sense of playing the
whole situation quite straight. and tried to balance the two. I'm
glad that's what you think that's what we did; it really was
something we desperately tried to do. It was very important
for the film to not sink into the depths of parody.
INT: "Sky Captain" has been a long time in the making — how
did you start as a filmmaker, and what was involved in getting
this film made?
KC: 1 grew up in Flint, Michigan, so first I just escaped from
there and realized there was a world outside of that. I found
myself in California, went to a school called CalArts. When
I graduated, 1 realized that I was just as far away from getting
a chance to make a movie as 1 was in Flint, Michigan, just be
cause of the expense involved. So about two years after 1
graduated, 1 noticed that the emerging technology was capa

blc d 1 doing amazing tilings. The software that was available,
which used to be in the millions of dollars, was suddenly at
my fingertips.
CalArts has a strong tradition of traditional animation, and
1 recognized that the computer might be used in the same way
that an animation stand is used for animation, applied to live ac
tion. In a way, 1 thought that 1 could treat the live actors in the
same way you would with Bugs Bunny cartoons. For the next
four years, I sat down to actually make this entire film, but 1
only had six minutes. So I cried uncle and looked for help.
Thai's when Jon Avnet got involved as producer, and shortly
thereafter, Jude Law and Gwyneth Pattrow became involved,
and we finally had a budget. That only took six more years. So
the whole process was a ten year journey to this point, which is
sort of amazing, thinking back on it.
INT: What kind of effect do you think this film will have on
Hollywood special effects in general?
KG 1 think that this film was an evolutionary step more than
anything else, in that it leveraged the techniques that were used
historically, and we just took it to the extreme conclusion. What
we discovered by doing a film this way was that you could dras
tically reduce the cost involved. It also gives you incredible con
trol over the imagery.
But I also don't think it's for everyone. I think it's applicable
to any genre, though. It certainly doesn't have to look the way
this film does — I think it can be a benefit to people who want
to make a very intimate little film set in Paris, but can't afford
to fly there. What it most represents, though, isn't so much for
Hollywood.
It's mostly the independent filmmakers who typically have
nothing. These techniques might finally level the playing field
a little bit, where with <m iMac and Photoshop and Aceffects,
you can create something that rivals what studios could do just
a couple years ago. If anything comes out of this film, it might
serve as a template for that, for other people to take a chance
and realize what's in their head.
INT: This may or may not be true — I had read somewhere
that although you recreated New York City in "Sky Captain,"
you had never actually visited the city when you started mak
ing the film.
KC: That's mostly true. I had made one trip there, about eight
years ago, but it was principally Radio City that I had never
been inside, to this day. So the sequence when they walk into
the lobby and the theater — 1 don't know what that looks like.
I sent our D.P. to New York, where they took photos. Prior to
that, out of books, 1 got the vague dimensions of Radio City and
we built it in the computer. I lramed the shots on this little vir
tual set, so they were armed with my little animatics. and they
went to New York and shot photos that loosely approximated
the backgrounds that we needed. Then we pieced it together
from that. I've been to New York since then, but not inside
Radio City.
INT: Do you think it helped you to conceive of New York as
more of a fantasy city?
KG In a way, yes. 1 think that my goal was to create the ideal
ized image of New York City, sort of the fairy tale version of it
— the thing that probably inspired Gotham City from "Bat
man," and "Metropolis," and "Superman" — so this was that
