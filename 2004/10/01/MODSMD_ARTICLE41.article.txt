Sometimes escapism is purely about getting stupid. Certain
kinds of films force you to forget about the bills piling up on the
kitchen table, about disgruntled spouses and cars caked with
months of mud and bird shit. And sometimes, when a film permits
you to escape so completely, you get stupid about the film itself, and
dreamily forgive all errors.
Thus I was smitten with "Sky Captain and the World of Tomor
row"—and yeah, it rendered me positively stupid with happiness.
From the very beginning, "Sky Captain" imagines an alternative 1939,
one so nostalgia-slathered that the Great Depression never happened,
and the Hindenbuig never crashed. In fact, the first few minutes show
the Hindenburg ID docking in New York through blurred snowflakes.
And here it was that I thought, "Mother of $%&!" This isn't just
alternate '39 in timeline, it's also otherworldly in appearance. The
colors are muted, almost sepia-toned. Light, in the "Sky Captain"

world, feels almost like an invasive force, blurring outlines and suf
fusing characters and objects with pure-white luminosity.
(Side-note and explanation of strong bias: If you have even the
slightest boner for this time period in design and art — for Art
Deco, for Machine Age technology £tnd Norman Bel Geddes and
Hugh Ferriss — as I do, then you will like this film, without any
choice in the matter. The mobile airstrip might make you weep.)
The intensely, strangely beautiful look of the film contrasts with
its pulpy stoiy. Make no mistake — this is true pulp, dastardly pulp.
The plot is more interesting because of the elements it contains, not
the directions it takes.
1) Someone's going to take over the world.
A) Maybe end it too?
2) Guy's going to save the world (J ude Law).
3) There's a girl; she's annoying (Gwyneth Pal trow).
4) There's another girl; she's kind of awesome (Angelina Jolie).
5) And so on.
At its heart, "Sky Captain" is unapologetically retro. Despite its
simple plot it is crammed with myriad thirties and forties-era pulp
set pieces—robots trampling New York City, Shangri-La, the in
side of an old-school fighter jet, everything else imaginable. This is
part of the great fun of the film. As it luxuriates in an era and style
of cinema it takes us everywhere within it.

For such a simple talc, the actors are mostly <irchetypes, beauti
fully costumed and coiffcd. J ude Law, as Sky Captain, is steely / sen
sitive / soul-destroyingly sexy, a calmer sort of Errol Flynn. Angeli
na Jolie, as Captain Franky Cook, is once again Hollywood's Ex
ample of a swaggering and slightly masculine without being unsexy
woman, though I was quickly won over by her eyepatch and the way
she shouted, "Aiert the ampliibious forces!" (I wasn't lying when I
said this film contained every pulp scenario imaginable.) Giovanni
Ribisi, as Dex, Is a relentlessly likeable sidekick, good with gadgets,
and complete with cute accent. Gwyneth Paltrow, however, gives
an awful performance as Polly Perkins — awkward and ass-drag
gingly imenergetic. It took some doing, but 1 managed to ignore her
irritating presence in the film.
By the end, "Sky Captain" has ripped off every film and comic
and serial imaginable with a light-hearted sort of respect, reveling in
its source material. But the film is unabashedly something, from
starkly pretty to cheesy to weird.
So for those of you who can't, won't turn off your stupid plot de
tectors, your Gwyneth Paltrow sucks complaints, and whatever
other hang-ups you have — God, just look at the pretty pictures zip
ping past And if you have to empty your mind, quiet those voices,
to really invest yourself in those pictures, then believe this: For "Sky
Captain," it's worth it
