When discussing British director Edgar Wright's zombie spoof
"Shaun of the Dead," the relevant question isn't 'is it any good?"
Nor is it "How great is this movie?" No, the question that really
needs answering is. "Why is 'Shaun of the Dead' so unbelievably
awesome?" For insight. Intermission turns to Asian zombie experts
Anthony Ha and Alice Kim.
INTERMISSION: Why is "Shaun of the Dead" so unbeliev
ably awesome?
ANTHONY HA: 1 tliink the first thing that I realized when watch
ing the "Shaun" is how goofy zombies actudly are. I mean, a guy
lurching around, waving his arms and moaning, is not naturally
scary, and it's to the credit of past directors George Romero espe
cially that they've been able to fashion some truly bugfuck terrify
ing imagery from this incredibly hokey idea.
Oddly enough, Wright's approach to the monsters isn't too dif
ferent from "serious" zombie flints. Yeah, there are a few gags that

play off the moaning, the stag
gering and so on the bit with
the coipsc lending a hand to
our protagonists' rendition of
"While Lines" is particularly
hysterical but by and large the
zombies play straight man and
woman to the spastic antics of
the (living) cast.
Wright has enough faith in
the basic silliness of the material

that he doesn't need to play it up. and this allows him to get serious not
to mention, yes, bugfuck terrifying once in a wliile. The scares include
a few harrowing chase moments, and loads of gross-out body horror,
with skin peeling, blood spewing and body parts flying everywhere.
And although the characters are generally written as broad car
icatures (the exasperated girlfriend, the slackcr buddy, etc.), the ac
tors seem deeply invested in the reality of their roles. It might not
take its place up there in the annals of great cinematic romances, but

the relationship between Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Liz (Kate Ash
field) is actually more believable and sympathetic than anything
I've seen in the recent spate of romantic films ("Before Sunset" ex
cluded). The advertising tagline, "a romantic comedy with zom
bies" isn't far off at all.
ALICE KIM: Lesson one: the Apocalypse arrives slowly. "Shaun
of the Dead" begins as a movie about a guy, his roommates, and a
girl. A few disconcerting details nudge into view - smashed cars, a
suspiciously numb-looking populace, frantic-yet-collected news
reporters. But hey, isn't this just post-Thatcher modem Britain?
Yes. But also no. After all, this is a zombie movie, and a great one
at that. Pretty stxm, we can't ignore the fuckers, and neither can
Shaun and his hetero life partner Ed (Nick Frost). They slip into
hero mode, fighting the zombies off and trying to rescue loved ones
— these are dudes that know their "Evil Dead"sand "Night-
Dawn-Day of's backwards and forwards.
However, "Shaun of the Dead" isn't merely a parody, or a com
ment on zombie films past. The stakes are high, and pedestrian as
these characters arc, we care about their fates. I still can't figure out
how the sudden shifts in tone work as well as they do - during com
ical splatterfests, characters will shout or wheeze heartfelt confes
sions, and Sweet Baby Jesus! I feel for them.
Perhaps they pull off this neat trick because this is a zombie film
made for me and my kind. We grew up on a gamey diet of zombie
films and. to this day, consider them some of the most—can we say
it?—awesome examples of cinema around. The makers of "Shaun
of the Dead" have made a film about themselves, about us. The film
is about people who get blasted and shout-sing "White Lines." Peo
ple who can't get decent jobs. People who have seen zombie films
and are both elated and terrified about suddenly being in one.
Other zombie films may be better, on a technical or emotional
level. But in the end, the zombie horror-comedy about getting
dumped and killing shit wins.
INT: But surely not everytliing was perfect?
AH: The ending feels arbitrary and rushed But even then, it's cool to
see a world of zombies coexisting with humans that doesn't involve mad
scientists and vivisection.

AK: And the fact that we didn't know, up until the end, if the protagonists
would live or die was highly admirable. Everything was perfect
INT: Best zombie death?

AH: Girl zombie falls on pole.
Pole goes through girl zombie.
Blood spurts. Camera shows
view through gaping wound.
Done before, but never this
funny or awesome.
AK: Cricket-batted to death.
INT: Best human death?

AK; Someone dies in a pub, and it's spectacularly disgusting. I'll say
this: entrails buffet free-for-all.
All: And then his girlfriend, severed leg in hand, follows hiin out.
(High fives director for "Night of the Living Dead" reference.)
INT: Best anti-zombie weapon?
AH: Cricket bat. So practical and multi-purpose.
AK; A Dire Straits record.
INT: Best use of music?
AK: "Don't Stop Me Now" by Queen, during a golf clubbing
sequence.
AH: God, how could I choose anything else? Ditto.
INT: Did you cry at the end?
AH: Hell yeah. Manly tears.
AK: No. Too much joy.

ANTHONY HA and ALICE K3M
INTERMISSION ZOMBIE EXPERTS

When discussing British director Edgar Wright's zombie spoof
"Shaun of the Dead," the relevant question isn't 'is it any good?"
Nor is it "How great is this movie?" No, the question that really
needs answering is. "Why is 'Shaun of the Dead' so unbelievably
awesome?" For insight. Intermission turns to Asian zombie experts
Anthony Ha and Alice Kim.
INTERMISSION: Why is "Shaun of the Dead" so unbeliev
ably awesome?
ANTHONY HA: 1 tliink the first thing that I realized when watch
ing the "Shaun" is how goofy zombies actudly are. I mean, a guy
lurching around, waving his arms and moaning, is not naturally
scary, and it's to the credit of past directors George Romero espe
cially that they've been able to fashion some truly bugfuck terrify
ing imagery from this incredibly hokey idea.
Oddly enough, Wright's approach to the monsters isn't too dif
ferent from "serious" zombie flints. Yeah, there are a few gags that

play off the moaning, the stag
gering and so on the bit with
the coipsc lending a hand to
our protagonists' rendition of
"While Lines" is particularly
hysterical but by and large the
zombies play straight man and
woman to the spastic antics of
the (living) cast.
Wright has enough faith in
the basic silliness of the material

that he doesn't need to play it up. and this allows him to get serious not
to mention, yes, bugfuck terrifying once in a wliile. The scares include
a few harrowing chase moments, and loads of gross-out body horror,
with skin peeling, blood spewing and body parts flying everywhere.
And although the characters are generally written as broad car
icatures (the exasperated girlfriend, the slackcr buddy, etc.), the ac
tors seem deeply invested in the reality of their roles. It might not
take its place up there in the annals of great cinematic romances, but

the relationship between Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Liz (Kate Ash
field) is actually more believable and sympathetic than anything
I've seen in the recent spate of romantic films ("Before Sunset" ex
cluded). The advertising tagline, "a romantic comedy with zom
bies" isn't far off at all.
ALICE KIM: Lesson one: the Apocalypse arrives slowly. "Shaun
of the Dead" begins as a movie about a guy, his roommates, and a
girl. A few disconcerting details nudge into view - smashed cars, a
suspiciously numb-looking populace, frantic-yet-collected news
reporters. But hey, isn't this just post-Thatcher modem Britain?
Yes. But also no. After all, this is a zombie movie, and a great one
at that. Pretty stxm, we can't ignore the fuckers, and neither can
Shaun and his hetero life partner Ed (Nick Frost). They slip into
hero mode, fighting the zombies off and trying to rescue loved ones
— these are dudes that know their "Evil Dead"sand "Night-
Dawn-Day of's backwards and forwards.
However, "Shaun of the Dead" isn't merely a parody, or a com
ment on zombie films past. The stakes are high, and pedestrian as
these characters arc, we care about their fates. I still can't figure out
how the sudden shifts in tone work as well as they do - during com
ical splatterfests, characters will shout or wheeze heartfelt confes
sions, and Sweet Baby Jesus! I feel for them.
Perhaps they pull off this neat trick because this is a zombie film
made for me and my kind. We grew up on a gamey diet of zombie
films and. to this day, consider them some of the most—can we say
it?—awesome examples of cinema around. The makers of "Shaun
of the Dead" have made a film about themselves, about us. The film
is about people who get blasted and shout-sing "White Lines." Peo
ple who can't get decent jobs. People who have seen zombie films
and are both elated and terrified about suddenly being in one.
Other zombie films may be better, on a technical or emotional
level. But in the end, the zombie horror-comedy about getting
dumped and killing shit wins.
INT: But surely not everytliing was perfect?
AH: The ending feels arbitrary and rushed But even then, it's cool to
see a world of zombies coexisting with humans that doesn't involve mad
scientists and vivisection.

AK: And the fact that we didn't know, up until the end, if the protagonists
would live or die was highly admirable. Everything was perfect
INT: Best zombie death?

AH: Girl zombie falls on pole.
Pole goes through girl zombie.
Blood spurts. Camera shows
view through gaping wound.
Done before, but never this
funny or awesome.
AK: Cricket-batted to death.
INT: Best human death?

AK; Someone dies in a pub, and it's spectacularly disgusting. I'll say
this: entrails buffet free-for-all.
All: And then his girlfriend, severed leg in hand, follows hiin out.
