# Even dorks get laid, so flaunt it you nerd

### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
What would you do if a troupe
of porn stars showed up at your
dorm and asked you to perform
with them as part of their newest
film? At Arizona State, a dozen or
so frat hoys jumped at the chance,
earning the ire of campus adminis
trators for their appearance in
"Shane's World #29: Frat Row
Scavenger Hunt 3."
The dean certainly won't have
to worry about a "Shane's World"
crew roving our campus. 1 lowever,
for students, especially you fresh
men, the incident is a sore re-

minder of a painful
fact: At Stanford,
getting laid can be
tough. Breathe easy
and thank the gods,
though. because
Roxy is here with
your first lesson on
navigating the sexual
Sahara that is the
Stanford campus.
The most impor
tant thing to realize
right now is that nei
ther male nor female
porn stars are show
ing up in your dorm's
lounge anytime soon.
Sex comes a bit

more difficult than that for Stan
ford students. During the first
weeks of school, some of your new
dormmates will try to regale you
with stories about how cool they
were in high school. When this
happens, remember what Public
Enemy's Flava Flav said: "Don't
believe the hype!"
Let's face it. None of us here
are cool. Those "hip" kids down
the hall? They spent their week
ends taking classical piano lessons,
and you spent yours either at de
bate tournaments or tutoring un
derprivileged children. Learn to
embrace your true self. Confi

dence in who you are and what you
have is very sexy; insecurity is the
quickest path to four long years of
swollen wrists and a semen
soaked, short-circuited keyboard.
Understanding that you are not
cool will help you get laid that
much quicker.
How can this be, you ask?
Well, if you hope to find yourself
swimming in a beautiful ocean of
tits, ass, penis and vagina, you
need to be realistic about the
world you've gotten yourself into.
Despite what you've been told, in
some ways Stanford mirrors the
world you came from. That means
that if you're a lady who wants to

screw or be screwed,
you need do relative
ly little; merely find
ing a partner is a sim
ple task for any en
terprising woman.
An adequate part
ner? Well, that's the
subject of a future
Roxy column. Men,
on the other hand,
have got some work
ahead of themselves.
Men. the vast ma
jority of you are
dorks. Am I repeat
ing myself? Yes, and
that's because I'm
trying to get some-

thing across to you. Like in high
school, football, water polo and
basketball players will get far more
attention than you here. Stanford
athletes spend many hours each
week honing their bodies for com
petition. You. on the other hand,
go to Tresidder Fitness on
Wednesdays. Worse yet, the ath
letes here are not the blockheads
you knew from high school.
Women fawn at the sight of them in
their nylon Stanford-embroidered
get-ups.
Deep down, many Stanford
women want to relive that dream
of dating the popular school star.

They search for Stanford's own
version of A.C. Slater, if you will.
Naturally, they imagine them
selves as Bayside High's Kelly,
hanging faithfully on his arm. Or
was that Jessie? Never mind. Hell,
even Roxy's got her own fantasy
about A.C. in a chantilly lace sin-

glet teaching yours truly a few
wrestling moves. Anyone game for
the corkscrew moonsault or the go
rilla press?
The point is that you have an
obstacle ahead of yourself. But do
not despair. Remember that for
every well-toned dreamboat, there
is a small platoon of men like you

— Dick-in-hand, waiting in line for
a few minutes of attention.
So what's a young, bright cam
pus virgin to do? Leverage your as
sets. If played correctly, sincere
dorkiness is a turn-on for some
women. Look around, and you'll
see some of the most beautiful

women with com
plete dorks.
Think of yourself
as Eddie Murphy
in"The Nutty
Professor" or
Adam Sandler in
"Billy Madison."
Alternatively,
you could start
drinking and hang
ing out with girls
who do the same.
Most of them
never did this in
high school and
will think you're
cool if you drink
with them — even
though you're not.
And whether
you're a guy or girl,
if you've got a near
by high school
sweetheart, tap that
ass for all it's worth.
But don't tell your
friends it's a high
school sweetheart.
Tell them he or she
just lives on the
other side of cam
pus. After all. it
looks cool to be nail
ing someone after
just a week at school
— something that

will undoubtedly aid you in your future
sexual quests.

Jessie Spano was quite the character . Always an ardent anti
marine life activist, she enjoyed donning fish-skeleton earrings.
