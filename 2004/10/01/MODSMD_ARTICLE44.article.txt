## COMMENTS ON FIRE This ain't Porno for Pyros, folks . . . 
### KARAN MAHAJAN INTERMISSION WRITER 
You've got to watch Comets on
Fire in concert. They've got so many
amps that they're literally forced to
perform at the very lip of the stage,
dripping hairy-hippy sweat all over
their ecstatic followers. Each song is a
yarn straight out of the '70s: meowing
guitars, thunderous chords and an
guished Robert Plant spirits shriek
out from "Blue Cathedral." Which
gets me thinking: Fuck. Karan, this is
it.this is the age of excess, and you're
living in it, you're just a kid who's into
indie-rock — what are you doing here
rubbing shoulders with these earnest
mullets? Go home, retire to your In
terpol. your Belle and Sebastian, trim
your hair, tie your boxers in a knot, sit
down and catch your breath: Your lin
eage doesn't extend beyond the DIY
losers of the 1980s; you don't need to
be knee-deep in this shit.
Okay, so I'm being dramatic.
But it's a point to consider: If you
were reborn with mad songwriting
skills would you write something
called "The Antlers of the Midnight
Sun" or "Wild Whiskey"? And then
scream enough to make AC / DC
seem articulate in comparison? Per
haps, yes, maybe? God, what is it
about these times? Something about
now, this decade, engenders it, en
dorses it — this hallelujah of self-con
scious excess. No less than three al
bums by three major bands this past
five months have contained the word

"cathedral" in their titles (Clinic's
"Winchester Cathedral," Castanet's
"Cathedral," and of course, this one)
and parody is solidifying into re
spectable art even as we spit. Acts like
The Darkness, McLusky, The Future

heads and Comets on Fire — and
films like Shaun of the Dead and pres
idents like George Bush — are all
showing us that parody, for better or
for worse, is more powerful and de
structive than, ahem, the real thing.

So let's dig in and pig out, shall we?
"The Bee and The Cracking Egg"
uses a repetitive riff that would serve
as the scaffold fora basic punk song,
but these Santa Cruz rockers rein
force it with a jamming aesthetic: The

drummer literally blasts out from the
front of the outfit and the second gui
tar belches out random high voltage
solos. It lasts seven minutes and 45
seconds, an indulgent length by any
standard. "Pussy Foot the Duke" is
dreamy — an almost obnoxious de
scent down that "Stairway to Heav
en" path that such bands love to lodge
between more savage cuts. It uses or
gans, harp-like arpeggios, you know,
(he works. The rest of the album oscil
lates between these two extremes; the
first two songs tutor us well in this for
mula. And by God. it works.
But really, what gets me every
time is how the indistinct, reverbed
vocals have a whirlpool effect, suck
ing everything into the fuzzy back
drop. Call it what you will: post
heavy-metal -Lou -Reed-Machine-
Music-NOT-Grateful-Dead-plus-a
bunch-of-amps-post-Verve-static for
people who're leading really boring
lives, but in the end, this is music.
This is nostalgic space riffage minus
the annoying self-importance. Paro
dy begets excess but self-conscious
excess begets humility and kids, this
is the humblest band I've listened to
in years, and that's why I'm here
writing this article to get you keen to
it. That's why I'm saying: Let's go,
you and I, to the next Comets show,
where we'll scream a lot and make
lots of gratuitous drug references
("they're riding the pulse of our
times like a shot of heroin!") and not
apologize ever, because hey, isn't this
the 60s?

Hell yeah, this is some hot shit. This is beyond garage — note the modern art hanging in the background. We're talking
"upper-middle class living-room rock" folks. If only the damn camera man could get himself orthogonal to the ground. Sick.
