Black Dice: "Creature Comforts"
(LP review) — June 2004
Black Dice knows the way of the
future. Even with my musical luddism
and penchant for arcane technologies
like the guitar. I admit this. The future
as told bv Black Dice is electronic

noise: pure, crisp sounds manipulated
into arrangements falling between
musique concrete and the experimen
tal rock of the mid-60s, with computer
geek sensibility and precision. Per
formed by two DJs accompanied by
Lightning Bolt's former vocalist on
occasional drums, improvisation and
deliberate space characterize the
Black Dice method. This album is
considerably more subdued than the

band's live show, but no record could
capture the full glory of that delicious,
unadulterated sound.
Brilliant though it may be (or per
haps because it is), many people find
this totally unpalatable. Try it anyway.
!!!: "Louden Up Now"
(LP review) — June 2004
Where did this come from? I could

name influences like Pigbag and ESG,
but that wouldn't quite nail it down.
As though the spirit of Joe Strummer
had possessed the body of Bootsy
Collins and emerged from a sewer east
of the East Village in the dead of the
night,!!! (say "chk chk chk") have hit
upon an underground vein of dark,
dance-imperative righteous rock (inci
dentally, the vocalist does sound un
cannily like Strummer). The entire

record is solid and even passes too
quickly, but the real masterpiece is the
nine-minute dance epic "Me and Giu
liani Down by the Schoolyard," a mes
sage to Rudy (and Mike) that must
have left Paul Simon bewildered. !!!
