Black Dice: "Creature Comforts"
(LP review) — June 2004
Black Dice knows the way of the
future. Even with my musical luddism
and penchant for arcane technologies
like the guitar. I admit this. The future
as told bv Black Dice is electronic

noise: pure, crisp sounds manipulated
into arrangements falling between
musique concrete and the experimen
tal rock of the mid-60s, with computer
geek sensibility and precision. Per
formed by two DJs accompanied by
Lightning Bolt's former vocalist on
occasional drums, improvisation and
deliberate space characterize the
Black Dice method. This album is
considerably more subdued than the

band's live show, but no record could
capture the full glory of that delicious,
unadulterated sound.
Brilliant though it may be (or per
haps because it is), many people find
this totally unpalatable. Try it anyway.
!!!: "Louden Up Now"
(LP review) — June 2004
Where did this come from? I could

name influences like Pigbag and ESG,
but that wouldn't quite nail it down.
As though the spirit of Joe Strummer
had possessed the body of Bootsy
Collins and emerged from a sewer east
of the East Village in the dead of the
night,!!! (say "chk chk chk") have hit
upon an underground vein of dark,
dance-imperative righteous rock (inci
dentally, the vocalist does sound un
cannily like Strummer). The entire

record is solid and even passes too
quickly, but the real masterpiece is the
nine-minute dance epic "Me and Giu
liani Down by the Schoolyard," a mes
sage to Rudy (and Mike) that must
have left Paul Simon bewildered. !!!
have wrathful social and political criti
cism to spare left over from their previ
ous lives as punk rockers. 1 .yrics take
Mmm, sweet sounds of summer and innocence lost

backseat to rhythm in the form of tight
rifling, heavy bass and creative percus
sion on every number. "We live here
and now dude, here and now, so get on
down." Damn right.
Kimva Dawson: "My Cute Fiend
Sweet Princess"
(LP review) — August 2004
Can't play, can't sing, can't do much

but hang around the Sidewalk Cafe in
Brooklyn packaging cassette tapes
with comic books for appreciative Lon
doners on the other side of the pond.
But theanti-folkster, like Jeffrey Light
ning Ix'wis. the Herman Diine broth
ers and fellow Moldy Peach Adam
Green, has her own charming, crude
brand of insight that makes her music -
widely available on CD for the first
time — irresistibly endearing. Art rock
will never give you lyrics like this:
"I was sitting tina couch some

where. watching VIII / when I learned
that Bruce Springsteen is his mother's
only son / I'm my mother'sonly daugh
ter; we were both Born to Run / but
even he says it's amazing raising babies
in the place where you come from."
Best thing since "Leopard-skin
Pill-box 1 hit." Folk lives on.
Bjnrk: "Medulla"
(LP review) — August 2004
One of my housemates walked in

on me listening to this record and
asked if I was becoming religious.
Musical light years from her work
with The Sugarcubes, Bjork's new
album makes good on her famous re
cent declaration that "instruments
are so over."
Medulla is the post-modern tri
umph of an ancient instrument, an in
tricate, intimate sonic terrain careful
ly sculpted almost entirely out of
human voices: national choirs, throat
singers, beatboxers and the ethereal,

matchless vocals of the Icelandic wiz
ard herself. Programmers like Mat
mos, the undercredited soundscapers
of Vespertine, cut and layer to create
impeccable, unsettling arrangements
from sobbing, gasping, growling and
a whole lot of singing. The obvious
single is "Who Is It (Carry My Joy on
the Left, Carry Mv Pain on the
Right)," one of several tracks on
which Rahzel, formerly of The
Roots, beatboxes to beat the drum
machine.
