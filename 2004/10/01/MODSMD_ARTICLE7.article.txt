## Treehouse will offer free pizza delivery 
### CYNTHIA H. CHO KAIYA REEVE STAFF WRITERS 
Ray Klein is going to make sure
that Stanford students don't go hun
gry— well, at least until 3 a.m.
every night.
Starting next week, students can
have pizza delivered to their dorms
from the Treehouse — the on-cam
pus eatery located in Tresidder that
has been serving burritos, burgers
and bowls of teriyaki chicken for
about eight years.
Klein, who owns the Treehouse
with his wife Judy, was first ap
proached about offering pizza by
the ASSU a few years ago. Back
then, the Treehouse was not
equipped to make pizza.
But now, after a $20.(XX) upgrade
that included pizza ovens, the Tree
house will soon take orders via
phone for pizza delivery. Klein is
just waiting fora digital subscriber
line, or DSL, to be installed by the
phone company.
From 6 p.m. to 3 a.m. every night,
pizzas will be delivered to dorms
throughout campus. Individual
slices of pizza can also be bought at
the Treehouse after 9 p.m. Pies start
at around $10, and slice and drink
combinations will be about $2.50.
Some students this week may
have gotten a sneak peek of what's
to come: Treehouse staff made
pizza, to test out the ovens, and gave
it out to customers for free.
Klein said that the Treehouse
will serve gourmet pizzas — ones
topped with artichokes or pesto, for
example.
Sophomore Alex Medearis, who
regularly orders pizza from Domi
no's, said that he would be willing to
give the Treehouse pizzas a try.
"1 would order pizza from the
Treehouse if it was good," Medearis
said. "Domino's was basically the
cheapest, but 1 didn't really like it
that much. It was the only place that
was open really late at night. I prefer
Round Table."
Others were more skeptical.
Senior Matt Dyer said that even
though he eats at the Treehouse a
few times a week, he would not
order pizza to his dorm.
"I wouldn't order pizza from the
Treehouse, because when I'm that
hungry I'd rather get it myself be
cause it's faster."
