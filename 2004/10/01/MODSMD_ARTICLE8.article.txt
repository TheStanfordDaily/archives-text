# Axess problems plague first week
## 
### ELAINE CHOI 
For several days during the first week of classes, many
students and faculty had trouble logging into Axess be
cause of changes made to the system. Even those who
were able log in faced other problems, such as delays in
loading Web pages.
Although the system has now been repaired, many stu
dents expressed anger and frustration with their inability
to arrange their schedules.
"The only way to find out where my classes were being
held was through Axess because I had to change my class
es so many times," said freshman Laura Holmes.
"Since Axess was down, 1 had to ask a bunch of people
where classes were and no one really knew."
Another student had similar problems with changing
classes on the system.
"I wound up having to make changes in classes, but
since Axess was down. I couldn't enroll," said sophomore
Ben Smalley. "My classes and activities conflicted in the
afternoons, so I had to drop a class. Then I needed to en
roll in two more classes, but I couldn't even shop other
classes bccaose Axess wasn't up."
In response to the problems, many students turned to
their Resident Computing Coordinators for help.
"I just told them to try again later because there was no
way to troubleshoot the problem," said Freshman /
Sophomore College RCC Nick Cheng, a sophomore.
"Perhaps too many people were trying to connect at the
same time."
One of the main reasons that Axess users had difficulty
logging into the system was because, prior to the start of
the school year. ITSS changed Axess from an HTML for
mat to a Web-based format. After making the switch. ITSS
could not test the log-in processes because they depend on
unique, SUNetlDs.
"We are always continuing to figure out a way to speed
up the process. Currently we are working on integrating
the login process in future stress tests," Director of Appli
cation Support Bob Allen said.
"We apologize and feel very badly for these problems.
Our team has worked very hard for the last ten months.
We are working round the clock to improve it,"he added.
Because of these problems, deadlines for filing certain
paperwork have been pushed back since most students use
Axess to meet those deadlines. For example, the last day to
be able to waive insurance was pushed back to Wednes
day, Sept. 29 at 11:59 p.m.
