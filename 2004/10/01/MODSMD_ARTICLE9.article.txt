# Non-partisan debate-viewing party draws mostly Dems
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students from across campus packed into Roble's main lounge last
night to watch the first debate between presidential candidates George
W. Bush and John Kerry. A standing-room-only crowd made up primar
ily of Kerry supporters stood on tiptoes to peer over each other's shoul
ders, cheering, jeering and laughing at each candidate's remarks, which
focused on foreign policy and homeland security.
The viewing party was sponsored by Stanford in Government, a non
partisan campus group, but most of the crowd unabashedly took Kerry's
side in comments during and after the event. And for all of the attendees
grilled by The Daily — who all acknowledged that they supported Kerry
and were unlikely to be swayed by last night's discussion — Kerry was the
clear winner.
"I would've expected Bush to be more composed or ready for the de
bate," said sophomore Miguel Gradilla.
"It was almost farcical watching the difference between the two of them,"
agreed sophomore Leena Sanzgiri. "Bush's presentation was so arrogant.
He was absolutely apathetic, as if he'd thought that he'd already won."
Stanford College Republicans President Bob Sensenbrenner, a junior,
said that he watched the debate from his room.
When asked about the dearth of vocal conservatives at the SIG event,
he responded, "I think that when you're talking about an event on a col
lege campus, it's tough to be a conservative around here."
Sensenbrenner was also more reserved in his assessment of the candi
dates' performances.
"John Kerry's a good debater, of course, but the president showed that
he was a good debater too," Sensenbrenner said. "He displayed the ded
ication and resolve that he's shown for the past four years."
Kerry drew a large round of applause from Stanford students during
his discussion of the fight against terrorism when he declared, "We also
have to be smart, Jim." talking to Jim Lehrer of PBS's News Hour.
The positive responses and enthusiasm for Kerry continued for the
rest of the evening. The audience responded strongly to Kerry's repeated
condemnations of Bush's strategy in Iraq, and his emphasis on prevent
ing nuclear proliferation.
Bush, on the other hand, was the target of booing and laughter when
ever he stumbled or paused, and received only a few scattered claps when
he concluded his remarks, emphasizing once again his steadfastness in the
face of what he characterized as Kerry's constantly changing positions.
Discussion went beyond the candidates' statements and mannerism.
One student was overheard asking, "Did you notice that Bush is wearing
a blue tie and Kerry is wearing a red tie?"
According to event organizer Julie Lein, the co-director of SlG's Cam
pus Awareness Committee, the group sponsored the event with the sup
port of the ASSU Advocacy Committee as part of a larger voter outreach
campaign.
"We thought that just by advertising it, we'd make people more
aware," she said. "People who weren't necessarily going to come to Roble
would at least know to watch the debate."
Lein, an editor for The Daily and a junior, added that the main impe
tus for SlG's sponsorship of the event was to create a nonpartisan envi
ronment. which might bring out more students.
"The anti-Bush comments were
an unfortunate side effect, I guess,"
she said. "Just because the event is
sponsored by a nonpartisan group,
you can't expect the comments to re
flect that. It was a skewed audience,
but that's the nature of the campus."
Although the Stanford
Democrats and Stanford College
Republicans were approached to
cosponsor the event, both groups ul
timately declined.
"We both thought that Stanford
in Government was going to do a
great job of organizing it." said Stan
ford Democrats President Kai
Stinchcombe, a doctoral student in
political science. "We didn't want to
make it more partisan than it need
ed to be. We figured that for some
thing like that people wanted to
hear the positions of the two candi
dates rather than having people
cheering, having drinking games
and trying to do a show of force."
Most students said they got a
clear picture of the candidates' posi
tions, but some were less enthusias
tic about the debate's content. Sanz
giri said that the quality of the dis
cussion could have been higher, a
failing that she blamed on Bush.
"I think in a debate, when one of
the participants is lacking, it brings
the quality of the debate down," she
said. "The difference between the
two of them was not quite as clear as
it could have been."
Junior Sarah Carroll, also a
Kerry supporter, echoed Sanzgiri's
disappointment with the content.
"It was too easy for both of the
candidates to avoid the question."
she said. "But I don't know if there's
another way to do it."

Students from across campus packed into Roble's main lounge last
night to watch the first debate between presidential candidates George
W. Bush and John Kerry. A standing-room-only crowd made up primar
ily of Kerry supporters stood on tiptoes to peer over each other's shoul
ders, cheering, jeering and laughing at each candidate's remarks, which
focused on foreign policy and homeland security.
The viewing party was sponsored by Stanford in Government, a non
partisan campus group, but most of the crowd unabashedly took Kerry's
side in comments during and after the event. And for all of the attendees
grilled by The Daily — who all acknowledged that they supported Kerry
and were unlikely to be swayed by last night's discussion — Kerry was the
clear winner.
"I would've expected Bush to be more composed or ready for the de
bate," said sophomore Miguel Gradilla.
"It was almost farcical watching the difference between the two of them,"
agreed sophomore Leena Sanzgiri. "Bush's presentation was so arrogant.
He was absolutely apathetic, as if he'd thought that he'd already won."
Stanford College Republicans President Bob Sensenbrenner, a junior,
said that he watched the debate from his room.
When asked about the dearth of vocal conservatives at the SIG event,
he responded, "I think that when you're talking about an event on a col
lege campus, it's tough to be a conservative around here."
Sensenbrenner was also more reserved in his assessment of the candi
dates' performances.
"John Kerry's a good debater, of course, but the president showed that
he was a good debater too," Sensenbrenner said. "He displayed the ded
ication and resolve that he's shown for the past four years."
Kerry drew a large round of applause from Stanford students during
his discussion of the fight against terrorism when he declared, "We also
have to be smart, Jim." talking to Jim Lehrer of PBS's News Hour.
The positive responses and enthusiasm for Kerry continued for the
rest of the evening. The audience responded strongly to Kerry's repeated
condemnations of Bush's strategy in Iraq, and his emphasis on prevent
ing nuclear proliferation.
Bush, on the other hand, was the target of booing and laughter when
ever he stumbled or paused, and received only a few scattered claps when
he concluded his remarks, emphasizing once again his steadfastness in the
face of what he characterized as Kerry's constantly changing positions.
Discussion went beyond the candidates' statements and mannerism.
One student was overheard asking, "Did you notice that Bush is wearing
a blue tie and Kerry is wearing a red tie?"
According to event organizer Julie Lein, the co-director of SlG's Cam
pus Awareness Committee, the group sponsored the event with the sup
port of the ASSU Advocacy Committee as part of a larger voter outreach
campaign.
"We thought that just by advertising it, we'd make people more
aware," she said. "People who weren't necessarily going to come to Roble
would at least know to watch the debate."
Lein, an editor for The Daily and a junior, added that the main impe
tus for SlG's sponsorship of the event was to create a nonpartisan envi
ronment. which might bring out more students.
"The anti-Bush comments were
an unfortunate side effect, I guess,"
she said. "Just because the event is
sponsored by a nonpartisan group,
you can't expect the comments to re
flect that. It was a skewed audience,
but that's the nature of the campus."
Although the Stanford
Democrats and Stanford College
Republicans were approached to
cosponsor the event, both groups ul
timately declined.
"We both thought that Stanford
in Government was going to do a
great job of organizing it." said Stan
ford Democrats President Kai
Stinchcombe, a doctoral student in
political science. "We didn't want to
make it more partisan than it need
ed to be. We figured that for some
thing like that people wanted to
hear the positions of the two candi
dates rather than having people
cheering, having drinking games
and trying to do a show of force."
