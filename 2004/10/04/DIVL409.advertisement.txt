Stanford Lively Arts brings the finest

Just for students, we have saved a limited
number of tickets for our most popular artists
coming this fall and we'll be selling the last of
them in White Plaza. Get them now because
after October 12, the best seats will be gone!
Limit two tickets per event per student with valid Stanford ID.
IDs will be checked at the door for each event. Valid throughout
the 2004-05 season. Stanford student half-price tickets are
underwritten in full by Helen and Peter Bing and the Office of
Student Affairs.
