# Cops bust underage tailgaters for alcohol violations
## 
### WILL OREMUS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
When a man in shorts and a tank
top and a woman in a green fleece
approached a student tailgate party
outside the Stanford football game
on Saturday, senior Bobby Fraser
figured they were probably alumni
dropping by to chat about the
game.
"They just looked like normal
fans," he said.
Turns out they were undercover
officers, according to several wit
nesses.
One of Fraser's friends, who is
under 21. "picked up a beer out of
the cooler and was about to open it.
and they just took him aside," Fras
er said.
According to Fraser and other
witnesses, uniformed officers soon
arrived on the scene to issue the
student a citation for being a minor
in possession of alcohol.
Sgt. David Lee of Stanford Po
lice said he didn't know whether
undercover officers were patrolling
tailgate parties Saturday. He
wasn't on duty at the time, and The
Daily yesterday was unable to
reach any Stanford Police officers
who were on duty at the time of the
game.
Lee did confirm that Stanford
Police issued two minor-in-posses
sion citations at tailgate parties
outside the game.
"We do have people monitoring
the tailgates." he said. "Alcohol
possession laws are fair game [for
enforcement) in any public venue."
Co-terminal student Marcus
Smith, who saw the plain-clothes
officers at the party, said they
weren't Stanford Police - he said
they identified themselves as offi
cers from a state agency.
Lee said the California Depart
ment of Alcoholic Beverage Con
trol, or ABC, occasionally sends
out agents to enforce liquor laws,
but he couldn't say whether that
was the case on Saturday.

citation issued

According to Smith, the officers
didn't only hand out minor-in-pos
session citations.
They also asked who was going
to take responsibility for the tail
gate party, and when one student
said he would take responsibility,
they cited that student for serving
alcohol to minors.
Senior Alberto Mann said he
has seen the same two plain
clothes officers at other Stanford
events. He added that he thought
such enforcement would dampen
student enthusiasm for tailgating,
which is already minimal.
"There's going to be even less
people out here next time," he said
as he gestured toward the sparse
crowd of about 30 student tail
gaters.
"Either that, or next time
they're just going to come here
more drunk already."
The athletic department has re
cently made efforts to stimulate
student excitement about home
football games, including making a
pitch to social managers at Row

Houses encouraging them to re
serve space for tailgate parties.
Two visiting University of
Washington alumni said the Stan
ford tailgate scene pales in compar
ison to that at Washington home
games.
"I've definitely never had an un
dercover cop come up to me at a
tailgate," added Washington alum
na Kristen Auten.
Fraser said he thought law en
forcement energies would be best
directed elsewhere.
"They're right, it's the law," he
said. "But I don't think it merits
this kind of enforcement.
"I'd like to see some research on
how many violent acts students at
tailgates have caused."
Lee, of the Stanford Police, said
that tailgate parties can, in fact,
present security problems.
"Certain groups congregate in
certain areas," he said. "Rival fans
can come into the area, you have
high emotion, and it does present a
potential problem depending on
how much alcohol is involved."
