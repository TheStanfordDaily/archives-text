# Cops bust underage tailgaters for alcohol violations
## 
### WILL OREMUS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
When a man in shorts and a tank
top and a woman in a green fleece
approached a student tailgate party
outside the Stanford football game
on Saturday, senior Bobby Fraser
figured they were probably alumni
dropping by to chat about the
game.
"They just looked like normal
fans," he said.
Turns out they were undercover
officers, according to several wit
nesses.
One of Fraser's friends, who is
under 21. "picked up a beer out of
the cooler and was about to open it.
and they just took him aside," Fras
er said.
According to Fraser and other
witnesses, uniformed officers soon
arrived on the scene to issue the
student a citation for being a minor
in possession of alcohol.
Sgt. David Lee of Stanford Po
lice said he didn't know whether
undercover officers were patrolling
tailgate parties Saturday. He
wasn't on duty at the time, and The
Daily yesterday was unable to
reach any Stanford Police officers
who were on duty at the time of the
game.
Lee did confirm that Stanford
Police issued two minor-in-posses
sion citations at tailgate parties
outside the game.
"We do have people monitoring
the tailgates." he said. "Alcohol
possession laws are fair game [for
enforcement) in any public venue."
Co-terminal student Marcus
Smith, who saw the plain-clothes
officers at the party, said they
weren't Stanford Police - he said
they identified themselves as offi
cers from a state agency.
Lee said the California Depart
ment of Alcoholic Beverage Con
trol, or ABC, occasionally sends
out agents to enforce liquor laws,
but he couldn't say whether that
was the case on Saturday.
