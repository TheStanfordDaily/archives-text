psychic healing at a symposium on the subject held at Stanford. Below is an
excerpt.
" 'Someday we will look back and say that the beginning of the psychic
age of man was the early 1970'5,' said Protessor of Materials Science
William Tiller.
His speech at the four day symposium, 'Dimension of Healing,' which
concluded at Stanford yesterday, compared psychic researchers to the first
ocean explorers, and said that.' like the explorers, parapsychologists 'will
map the domain.'
The conference opened Saturday with two days of public presentations
focusing on paranormal methods of healing. The Academy of Parapsychol
ogy and Medicine and the departments of industrial engineering and mate
rials science co-sponsored the event.
Faith healer Olga Worrall described her success with the laying on of
hands to a first day audience of about 900 people in Memorial Auditorium.
Worrall, a clairvoyant since the age of nine, explained that a healer provides
the conditions necessary for healing to occur.
1991 — On Oct. 4, The Stanford Daily ran a story about seven campus hous
es demanding improved food service. Below is an excerpt.
"Residents in seven University-operated Row houses, angry that their
in-house cooks have been re-assigned to larger dorms, say they want the sit
uation rectified either by having their cooks returned or allowing some
houses to become self-operatives.
When they arrived back on campus this year, residents of Roth, Yost,
Murray, 558 Mayfield. Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, Grove Mayfield and Grove
Lasuen learned their in-house cooks would no longer be a part of their res
idential communities.
Instead, their meals are prepared in Wilbur Hall and Lagunita Court and
trucked in to the respective houses. According to residents, the food is not
up to par.
At least one house, 558, has sought legal counsel and claims there is a
breach of spirit of contract,' according to resident Craig Klugman, a senior.
But he noted that taking legal action would be a 'very extreme action.'
