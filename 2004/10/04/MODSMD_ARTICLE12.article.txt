## 
### JEN MARTINEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Out of 138 Pi Beta Phi chapters
internationally, the Stanford chap
ter has been awarded the Balfour
Cup this year.
"Winning this award is like win
ning an Oscar or the World Series,"
said Pi Beta Phi President Chelsea
Maughan. a senior.
The sorority's national head
quarters names the top 20 chapters
each year, based on criteria ranging
from community involvement to
academic excellence. In recent
years, the Stanford Pi Beta Phi
chapter has fallen somewhere in the
top twenty, but has never cracked
the top ten.
According to Maughan, part of

what catapulted the Stanford chap
ter to the front of the pack was a
new on-campus house, which it re
ceived in 1999. The house, she said,
had helped establish Pi Beta Phi on
campus as a huh for community ser
vice and fostered camaradarie
among the women.
"Fraternities and sororities' mis
takes are highlighted a lot more
than their contributions." Maughan
said. "In the house we have an
Olympic synchronized swimmer.
Gaieties performers, members of
the Chamber Chorale, and one of
the senior class presidents. Pi Phis
are empowering, strong women."
For the past four years, Stanford
Pi Beta Phi members have held the
highest grade point average among
all the chapters in the nation. This

past year, the overall grade point
average was 3.65, with fourteen
women receiving 4.05.
"School doesn't come second,"
Maughan said.
Another factor that helped Pi
Beta Phi snag the award was its
commitment to the community and
its creative philanthropic projects,
said senior Natalie Schwartz, who is
the sorority's Vice President for
Moral Advancement.
Each fall. Pi Beta Phi members
turn their house in the Cowell Clus
ter into a Haunted House open to
local residents and their children.
The admission to enter the house is
one book, which is later donated to
the East Palo Alto Library.
Another popular Pi Beta Phi
philanthropic event held every

spring is Les Beaux Arts, which
showcases the art and music of
Stanford students.
Proceeds are donated to the Ar
rowmont School of Arts and Crafts
in Tennessee.
"I think the [national headquar
ters] liked our chapter because we
came up with our own ideas, and
they admire the individuality of the
members," Schwartz said.
And on a campus in which fra
ternities and sororities are often
dismissed, said sophomore Jane
Dunlevie, the award was a testa
ment to their unconventionality.
"We're being rewarded for
being different," she said.
The group celebrated the award
at a ceremony at the Menlo Coun
try Club yesterday afternoon.
