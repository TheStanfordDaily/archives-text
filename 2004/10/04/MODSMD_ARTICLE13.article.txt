# Duke outfits its freshman class with free iPods
## 
### SPENCER KALLICK DAILY NORTHWESTERN (NORTHWESTERN UNIV 
(U-WIRE) EVANSTON, 111. â€” Bringing
mobile technology to campus, Duke University
purchased 1,650 Apple iPods for incoming fresh
men this fall.
Although many universities are looking into
similar offers. Northwestern University current
ly has no plans to make such an investment.
"So far the response from the community is
that this isn't a priority," said Wendy Woodward,
director of Technology Support Services at NU.
During orientation, Duke freshmen received
the 20-GB iPods, which retail for about $3(X).
The units came preloaded with an academic
calendar, the president's convocation address
and the Duke fight song.
Students also have access to a specially de
signed Web site that lets them download class
lectures and readings.
"Hearing the lectures again can definitely be
helpful," Duke freshman Katie Karsh said in a

phone interview. "Not many classes use it be
cause they found out about it late in the summer
so they weren't really able to incorporate it into
their lesson plans."
Some at Duke worry that class attendance
might drop it" students are able to listen in later.
But Karsh said her economics professor warned
that if class population dwindled, she would stop
posting the lectures.
According to a Duke press release, the pro
ject's total cost could exceed $500,000, which in
cludes hiring an academic computing specialist
for the project, counting associated research
costs and purchasing the iPods.
Duke decided to pursue the iPod project only
after extensive input from teachers and profes
sionals, said David Menzies, manager of the
school's Office of Information Technology.
The money came from a special technology
fund set aside two years ago, he added.
Some NU students said they weren't sure if the
iPods would be useful.
"If the school is going to spend money for
something, it should be something that is greatly

beneficial instead of something that just saves us
some time," said Courtney Soderberg, a commu
nication freshman.
Other students echoed Soderberg's concern.
"It would be a cool feature," said freshman
Mark Patterson, "but I would like to see my
money go toward another section of Spanish."
Nevertheless, NU is investigating which mobile
technology device would be best for the campus.
Woodward said.
"While we recognize that mobility is very
much a part of where we are at today, our cus
tomers are telling us that they don't want to be
forced into one place," Woodward said. "We try
to do all we can to embrace that choice."
NU is open to exploring all forms of technol
ogy, she added. If students are interested in lob
bying for mobile technology, they can go through
groups such as the Associated Student Govern
ment's Information Technology Committee.
In the spring, the Duke pilot program will be
reviewed to decide if it should be continued. The
iPods then also will become the personal proper
ty of each Duke freshman.
