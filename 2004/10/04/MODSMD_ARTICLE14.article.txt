# Colleges pair roommates online

### KASIA GALAZKA DAILY NORTHWESTERN (NORTHWESTERN UNIV 
line roommate database is specifi
cally designed for students living off
campus. The site allows students to
view off-campus roommate possibil
ities before making a choice.
"We've had lots of positive feed
back," Bawolek said. "It has a high
satisfactory rate. We also recom
mend meeting in a public place
prior to selection in case there's any
problems."
Arizona also offers students ref
erences to a lawyer to mediate, ad
vise or help with roommate or rent
troubles should they arise in the fu
ture.
Bowling Green State University
in Ohio also experimented with an
online database system. Officials set
up message boards through Black
board where students could search
for roommates.
Some students took the initiative
to make their own personal Web site
with additional contact information
and were able to find a roommate
that way, said Christy Gurga, a
freshman at Bowling Green.
"I have a roommate with the
same morals and values as me," said
Gurga, who made her own Web site
this year to search fora roommate.
We were able to contact and meet
up with each other over the sum

handshake, a hug and a smooch on
the cheek all are acceptable greet
ings when meeting an acquaintance
in person. But what about an invisi
ble wave over the Internet?
Universities across the country
are experimenting with online
roommate searches that allow stu
dents to seek the perfect roommate,
but Northwestern University has yet
to participate in any similar process.
Some schools use an online data
base to list basic student informa
tion. Users also can fill in response
sections on Web-based applications
where they can list additional facts
about themselves. Students can view
profiles and personal preferences
regarding living conditions and can
select their desired type of academic
atmosphere.
"We give students a resource to
find a roommate," said Carrie Ba
wolek, student desk coordinator for
the University of Arizona's Com
muter Student Affairs, which coor
dinates housing for both on- and off
campus students.

mer."
Although many students who use
these databases report positive re
sults, some university housing direc
tors still are debating whether such
services are needed and should re
place their existing systems.
NU continues to ask only a few
questions — such as drinking and
smoking preferences — on housing
forms sent to incoming students.
There presently is no system to help
match off-campus students with a
roommate.
"The incidence of roommate
conflict is less than one percent,"
said Mark D'Arienzo, NU's associ
ate director of Housing and Food
Service.
"It's not a static-stagnant assign
ment process. The system is more
than adequate."
Some NU students said the
roommate database system sounds
interesting but is not needed.
"It's a little less random but you
still don't know the person," said
McCormick sophomore Brian Pat
ton, who also serves as president of
Sargent Hall. "I think the way we
have it now is perfectly fine. My
roommate and I were paired ran
domly and we haven't had any
problems."
