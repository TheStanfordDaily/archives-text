# Growing in popularity, wireless connections proliferate on campus
## 
### SARAH PAPÉ STAFF WRITER 
Have you ever been in class where, in between
the professor's sentences, all you can hear is fin
gers rapidly clicking on a keyboard? Have you
then wondered why anyone would bother tran
scribing, word for word, an entire lecture?
Well, you may have been fooled — there's a
good chance that the diligent student whose 60-
words-per-minute skills you envied was chatting
on Instant Messenger or writing e-mails, thanks to
the growing number of wireless access points on
campus.
Despite some security concerns. Residential
Computing and Information Technology Systems
Services have been expanding the wireless net
work at Stanford, making it easier for students,
staff and faculty to connect to the Internet from
over 300 wireless access points on campus, includ
ing the Main Quad and the Bookstore cafe. How
ever, budget constraints are limiting the speed of
the network's growth.
"The goal is to have wireless where the most
freshmen live," said Ethan Rikleen, Residential
Computing Network and Systems Administrator.
"And then work towards the other residences

when money becomes available."
Branner. Stern, Wilbur, Roble and Florence
Moore, which house the majority of freshmen, all
have wireless. The only freshman residence with
out wireless is Lagunita.
Other residences with wireless include Bob
and those in the Cowell Cluster. Wireless is also
available in academic areas like Dinkelspiel Audi
torium and the Clark Center. The Law School and
all of the libraries have set up their own wireless
access points.
Currently, Res Comp is working to install wire
less access points in Sterling Quad and hopes that
they will be up and running some time this quar
ter. However, the rest of Governor's Corner will
have to wait indefinitely for wireless until Res
Comp acquires adequate funding.
Res Comp and ITSS allow students and houses
to set up their own wireless access points, as long
as they do not interfere with the network already
in place. Narnia, for example, plans to install its
own wireless access point soon.
"If students can provide something that we
can't, that's great," Rikleen said. "As long as what
they are doing works with the existing system."
Despite enthusiasm for wireless, installation is
slow because there is not yet a specific fund allot

ted for it. Last year Res Comp submitted a budget
proposal to the university for $1 million to put
wireless in all the residences, but it did not receive
any additional funding.
"The trick is finding ways to pay for it," Rik
leen said. "It is a new technology and there hasn't
been a lot of money in the past few years for cur
rent programs, let alone new things."
Beyond the costs of installing wireless, addi
tional funding is also needed to sustain the net
work, which includes maintenance and replacing
the hardware.
Students coming back to school this fall saw a
rise in their monthly in-room network bill, which
is due to the rising costs of running Internet con
nections. Although it may allow for some con
tinued wireless expansion, the increased cost is
unrelated to the rising demand for wireless.
Though many people are attracted to the mo
bility of wireless, Alvin Chew, network specialist
for ITSS, cautions that wireless is not as secure as
a wired connection.
"There is a lot of enthusiasm for wireless,"
Chew said, "but people need to be aware when
using wireless technologies that connections
aren't as secure. Though it is almost as good as
having a wired connection, people need to be
cautious."
Phil Reese, Technical Manager for ITSS,
noted that usernames and passwords when log
ging in using MacLeland, PC-Leland or Web au
thentication are equally secure on wired and
wireless networks. But other information is not
secure. ITSS is working on technologies to im
prove secure connections, but they probably
won't be in place until next academic year.
"Wireless is great for sitting in the lounge or
going outside," Rikleen said. "But when I'm
working at my desk, I want to be wired
Wireless is not as fast nor is it as secure as a
wired connection."
Despite these disadvantages, officials at ITSS
and Res Comp are excited about the future of
wireless computing at Stanford.
Reese believes that the University is in a tran
sition from people using mostly wire connections
to wireless. He hopes many more access points
will be added by next academic year, including ex
pansion to the athletic complexes.
"We don't see wireless as a luxury," Reese said.
"It's a part of doing everyday business. The con
venience of not having to plug into a jack is ap
pealing to many students and faculty. They don't
have to stop using the Internet just because they
are leaving their desk."
Many students are beginning to take advantage
of the mobility that wireless offers. In a survey of
students in the residences conducted by Res
Comp last spring, 26 percent of respondents said
they used wireless daily. Among incoming fresh
men, 88 percent have laptops, which, according to
Reese, virtually all have wireless capabilities.
Senior Wenfei Xie used wireless almost every
day last year in Serra, which has five wireless ac
cess points.
"1 like not being tethered to my desk," Xie said.
"It was nice to be able to sit on my futon and still
be able to use the Internet. I would use wireless
this year, but that's not really an option since I live
in Governor's Corner."
