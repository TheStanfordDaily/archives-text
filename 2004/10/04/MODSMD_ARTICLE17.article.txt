# Stanford's laptop rapper...
## Senior takes time from class with a new record and air time 
### DEVON MAYLIE DESK EDITOR 
He is profiled in the "New Faces" section of Rolling Stone magazine
and has a music video on mtvll. MC Lars, a.k.a. senior Andrew Nielsen,
is forging a new genre of music he calls "post-punk laptop rap."
On his second album, "The Laptop EP," released in July, Nielsen cre
ates a sound that Rolling Stone called a fusion of "low-fi hip-hop, emo
guitar samples and a nerd sensibility." The new sound is catching on, es
pecially in the United Kingdom, so Nielsen decided to take a leave of ab
sence from school this quarter to tour the United States and record his
full-length album, due out in 2005.
After the release of "The Laptop EP," Nielsen toured the West Coast
in June and the United Kingdom in July. He has a song ranked in the top
80 for college stations, and since July he estimates that about 2,000 copies
of "The Laptop EP" have sold. Songs from the album are aired on radio
stations in San Francisco, Boston, Sacramento and Rhode Island. He has
played a total of 113 gigs, 31 of which were at Stanford.
Wearing his signature Oakland As baseball hat, Nielsen weaves lyrics
around computer-driven beats, samples and live guitar. He also makes a
point of not using swear words.
"It has the energy of punk music," Nielsen said, emphasizing that the
rhythms generated from his friend's 12-inch Power√üook G4 are an im
portant component to the overall sound. "It is not just punk. It is also rap
and pop sounding. It is not one genre."
Nielsen, who strives to be like KRS-One, a rapper he calls intelligent
and educational, likes to write about the things he is thinking about and
subjects not commonly used in hip-hop. He name-checks poets and artists
to create a time reference.
On his second CD, song topics range from the changing face of emo
music in "Signing emo" (The label pres. calls and yells, "Sign more emo!"
/ How about screamo? "If it sells, sign Nemo," / "We're down 2%, and
BMG knows / My Daughter likes Dashboard, so get me one of those!") to

the effects of technology in 'iGeneration" (See the iGeneration knew or
ganization meant optimization and unification / When imagination gave
participation in creation of culture a manifestation / The Berlin Wall fell
and out we came, the post-Cold War kids laid claim to AIM).
"Andrew's rapping style is definitely unique," said senior Damondrick
Jack, laptop guru and occasional backup vocalist for Nielsen on stage.
"His choice of lyrics is usually funny and / or thought-provoking and / or
just plain silly."
Nielsen, an English major and psychology minor, chose Edgar Allen
Poe for the song "Mr. Raven" because he wanted to face the challenge of
fitting the meter of his verse over a sample from a song by the group Brand
New. The theme for "UK Visa Versa" came out of his study abroad ex
perience in the United Kingdom.
Nielsen started experimenting with sound recording and computers
when he was in the fifth grade, but his music career took off when he spent
winter quarter of his junior year at Oxford through Stanford's Overseas
Studies Program.
While performing around Oxford, he was discovered by the local label
Truck Records. He released his first CD, "Radio Pet Fencing," with them
that quarter. SideCho Records released the CD in the United States in
2003.
"There quite simply hasn't been anyone quite like him ... especially
not in Oxford," said Paul Bonham of Truck Records in a press release.
"His... spirit was what encouraged us most, the 'I record in my dorm' atti
tude contrasted with a professional stance on how to get on with people
and make the most out of life."
Due to the growing support and success, Nielsen said that he is seri
ously considering a career in music after he graduates this year.
"As long as we're having fun and able to feed ourselves, I think we'll
still be playing together," he said, referring to the friends, including Jack,
he performs with.
He has a performance at the Cantor Arts Center on Thursday at
9:30 p.m.
