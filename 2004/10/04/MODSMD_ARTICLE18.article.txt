## Editorial Returning students should get back their rightful P.O. Boxes 
### 
At the beginning of this quarter, the Stan
ford postal system mistakenly reassigned
the P.O Boxes of some returning stu
dents due to a computer glitch. Even
though these students renewed their P.O. Boxes
online via Axess last spring, the boxes were still re
keyed and assigned to other members of the Uni
versity community.
While it is encouraging that the postal system
has taken measures to help those affected, not
enough has been done to remedy the situation. Re
turning students whose boxes have been reas
signed should have the right to reclaim their for
mer P.O. Boxes.
For upperclassmen, losing their specific P.O.
Box numbers is nothing short of a disaster. Such
students typically have important mailings coming
to their P.O. Boxes, often containing time-sensi
tive material.
The inconvenience fora returning student of
having to change his P.O. Box address - after hav
ing used that address for correspondence with
friends and family, financial bills, graduate school
applications, job searching, etc. - would be much
greater than the burden placed on a student who
had just been assigned the new P.O. Box.
Instead of working to meet the needs of return
ing students affected by this mistake, the mail sys
tem has forced such students to wait in line to

check on the status of their mailboxes and then
reapply for new mailboxes if their old mailboxes
have been reassigned. Such students must return
several days later to pick up their new key, and
then they have to go to the length of informing ev
eryone of their new address.
It would be expensive and burdensome to re
key all the wrongly assigned P.O. Boxes in order to
return them to their prior owners, but this is the
only appropriate and fair way to resolve this situa
tion. Those who have held an address fora pro
longed time period - and who have done every
thing that they were required to do in order to
maintain the privilege of having that address for
another year - should not be forced to pay for
someone else's mistake. While reverting reas
signed P.O. Boxes back to their original holders
would inconvenience freshmen and others who
were just assigned those boxes, individuals who
have held the P.O. Boxes only fora few weeks
have much less at stake than those who have held
them for years.
Students who followed the proper protocol for
renewing their mailboxes should have priority in
retaining those boxes regardless of any computer
errors that arise. We hope that the Stanford mail
system works to bring about a more satisfying and
accommodating conclusion to this unfortunate
mistake.
