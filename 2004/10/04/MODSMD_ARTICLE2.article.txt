# Ugly but effective
## Stanford grinds out mistakefilled win over Huskies, 27-13

It wasn't always pretty, but the Cardinal did exact
ly what they were supposed to do Saturday at Stan
ford Stadium.
The Cardinal came into Saturday's game at Stan
ford Stadium favored to win by two touchdowns, and
they did exactly that, defeating Washington. 27-13.
Junior tailback J.R. Lemon rushed fora career
high 162 yards and three touchdowns, including a 58-
yard scoring run in the first quarter, and the special
teams blocked two punts, one of which sophomore
Nick Sanchez returned for Stanford's final touch
down.
The big plays helped offset a mistake-filled day for
the Cardinal. Trent Edwards threw three intercep
tions, Lemon lost a fumble, Michael Seroi missed an

extra point and the team committed eight penalties
totaling 77 yards.
"This was the ugliest game 1 think I've ever seen,
and unfortunately I coached in it," head coach Buddy
Teevens said. "I told the guys to take some satisfac
tion in the fact that we played poorly and still came
out on top."
The win was critical for the Cardinal (3-1, 1-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference), who could hardly afford to drop
a home game to the Pac-10's lone winless team.
The Huskies (0-4.0-2) put up little fight Saturday,
as freshman quarterback Carl Bonnell completed just
9-of-25 passes for 118 yards and tailback Kenny
James gained only 40 yards on 15 rushes.
"You cannot give somebody a blocked punt fora
touchdown," Huskies head coach Keith Gilbertson
said. "We've got to make more plays to win the
game."
Still, facing a mistake-prone Cardinal, the Huskies
entered halftime trailing by only one score, 14-7.

Redshirt senior Kenneth Tolon and the Cardinal put together 456 yards of total offense to help Stanford snap
a six-game losing streak against Washington. Tolon had four rushes for 36 yards as part of a pounding ground
attack, as Tolon and J.R. Lemon combined for 198 yards against the outmanned Husky defense.
