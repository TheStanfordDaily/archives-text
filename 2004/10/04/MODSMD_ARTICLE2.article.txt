# Ugly but effective
## Stanford grinds out mistakefilled win over Huskies, 27-13 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It wasn't always pretty, but the Cardinal did exact
ly what they were supposed to do Saturday at Stan
ford Stadium.
The Cardinal came into Saturday's game at Stan
ford Stadium favored to win by two touchdowns, and
they did exactly that, defeating Washington. 27-13.
Junior tailback J.R. Lemon rushed fora career
high 162 yards and three touchdowns, including a 58-
yard scoring run in the first quarter, and the special
teams blocked two punts, one of which sophomore
Nick Sanchez returned for Stanford's final touch
down.
The big plays helped offset a mistake-filled day for
the Cardinal. Trent Edwards threw three intercep
tions, Lemon lost a fumble, Michael Seroi missed an

extra point and the team committed eight penalties
totaling 77 yards.
"This was the ugliest game 1 think I've ever seen,
and unfortunately I coached in it," head coach Buddy
Teevens said. "I told the guys to take some satisfac
tion in the fact that we played poorly and still came
out on top."
The win was critical for the Cardinal (3-1, 1-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference), who could hardly afford to drop
a home game to the Pac-10's lone winless team.
The Huskies (0-4.0-2) put up little fight Saturday,
as freshman quarterback Carl Bonnell completed just
9-of-25 passes for 118 yards and tailback Kenny
James gained only 40 yards on 15 rushes.
"You cannot give somebody a blocked punt fora
touchdown," Huskies head coach Keith Gilbertson
said. "We've got to make more plays to win the
game."
Still, facing a mistake-prone Cardinal, the Huskies
entered halftime trailing by only one score, 14-7.

Redshirt senior Kenneth Tolon and the Cardinal put together 456 yards of total offense to help Stanford snap
a six-game losing streak against Washington. Tolon had four rushes for 36 yards as part of a pounding ground
attack, as Tolon and J.R. Lemon combined for 198 yards against the outmanned Husky defense.

teams key attack

the Cardinal's first drive of the second half, it looked like
the Huskies might be coming alive.
However, Washington's subsequent drive stalled at
midfield, and Stanford responded with a 10-play, 92-yard
drive. Lemon's one-yard plunge put Stanford up 20-7.
The Husky offense stalled again on the next posses
sion, and sophomore Brandon Harrison broke through
to block Sean Douglas' punt. Redshirt freshman Nick
Sanchez was right there to scoop it up and race 11 yards
to the end zone, putting the Cardinal on top, 27-7.
"It's something we've been practicing," Harrison said
of his teamwork with Sanchez. "We've been talking
about it all year."
A jubilant Sanchez said there was never any doubt
that the Cardinal's punt-block play would pay dividends.
"If we run it. he's gonna block it and I'm gonna
score," Sanchez said.
David Bergeron also blocked a Douglas punt in the sec
ond quarter, making Saturday the latest in a string of im
pressive performances by the Cardinal special-teamers.
"There are a lot of opportunities for big plays to be
made on special teams." Bergeron said. "It can set the
tone of a game. The momentum on (the blocked punts)
is invaluable, the message that sends to the other team."
Lemon sent a more conventional message to the
Huskies by repeatedly beating them for significant
yardage with rushes around the end.
"This team wasn't as great laterally as other teams, so
we tried to get outside," he said.
It didn't take L.emon long to do so, as the last play of
the first quarter saw him run off right tackle and then cut
upfield, reaching the end zone untouched. It was the lat
est in a series of astute reads by the Stanford offense,
which hurried to run the play before the first-quarter
clock expired.
"They were just real thin on that side and we checked
it outside (at the line]." Lemon said. "The guy who was
playing outside stayed outside, so I went back inside."

Lemon had also used his speed earlier in the first to
score Stanford's first touchdown. Facing first-and-goal
from the 3-yard line, Edwards threw a lateral to the out
side and Lemon beat the Husky defenders to the goal
line.
The pass was barely a lateral, but while its lack of for
ward motion gave Lemon three rushing scores on the
day, it left Edwards without a passing touchdown for the
first time this season. He finished 23-of-33 for 254 yards,
a strong enough performance had it not been for his by
three interceptions — all of which came in or near the
Huskies' end zone.
"He forces some plays," Teevens said. "The tough
thing is the turnovers."
The Huskies scored on James' 1-yard run in the sec
ond quarter and on a 28-yard pass from backup Casey
Paus to Sonny Shackelford late in the fourth. Shack
elford led the Huskies' depleted receiving corps — its
top three receivers all suffered injuries in the Huskies'
previous game — with five catches for 54 yards.
Lemon was the star for Stanford, although Kenneth
Tolon added 44 yards on four carries and Mark Bradford
caught a season-high five passes for 79 yards.
The Cardinal defense was once again staunch, total
ing three sacks, six tackles fora loss and one intercep
tion, which Stanley Wilson returned 51 yards.
"I think their defense is really stout," Gilbertson said.
"They're very good physically."
The Cardinal's win was its first against Washington
since 1994 and just its second in the schools' last 18 meet
ings. There were a mere 27,550 fans on hand to witness
the rare triumph, though — less than half the number
that showed up to watch Stanford play Southern Cali
fornia Sept. 25.
Up next for Stanford are four road games in five con
tests, including Oct. 9's nationally televised game against
former Cardinal head coach Tyrone Willingham at
Notre Dame.

The Huskies (0-4.0-2) put up little fight Saturday,
as freshman quarterback Carl Bonnell completed just
9-of-25 passes for 118 yards and tailback Kenny
James gained only 40 yards on 15 rushes.
"You cannot give somebody a blocked punt fora
touchdown," Huskies head coach Keith Gilbertson
said. "We've got to make more plays to win the
game."
Still, facing a mistake-prone Cardinal, the Huskies
entered halftime trailing by only one score, 14-7.

Redshirt senior Kenneth Tolon and the Cardinal put together 456 yards of total offense to help Stanford snap
a six-game losing streak against Washington. Tolon had four rushes for 36 yards as part of a pounding ground
attack, as Tolon and J.R. Lemon combined for 198 yards against the outmanned Husky defense.
Lemon, special
teams key attack

the Cardinal's first drive of the second half, it looked like
the Huskies might be coming alive.
However, Washington's subsequent drive stalled at
midfield, and Stanford responded with a 10-play, 92-yard
drive. Lemon's one-yard plunge put Stanford up 20-7.
The Husky offense stalled again on the next posses
sion, and sophomore Brandon Harrison broke through
to block Sean Douglas' punt. Redshirt freshman Nick
Sanchez was right there to scoop it up and race 11 yards
to the end zone, putting the Cardinal on top, 27-7.
"It's something we've been practicing," Harrison said
of his teamwork with Sanchez. "We've been talking
about it all year."
A jubilant Sanchez said there was never any doubt
that the Cardinal's punt-block play would pay dividends.
"If we run it. he's gonna block it and I'm gonna
score," Sanchez said.
David Bergeron also blocked a Douglas punt in the sec
ond quarter, making Saturday the latest in a string of im
pressive performances by the Cardinal special-teamers.
"There are a lot of opportunities for big plays to be
made on special teams." Bergeron said. "It can set the
tone of a game. The momentum on (the blocked punts)
is invaluable, the message that sends to the other team."
Lemon sent a more conventional message to the
Huskies by repeatedly beating them for significant
yardage with rushes around the end.
"This team wasn't as great laterally as other teams, so
we tried to get outside," he said.
It didn't take L.emon long to do so, as the last play of
the first quarter saw him run off right tackle and then cut
upfield, reaching the end zone untouched. It was the lat
est in a series of astute reads by the Stanford offense,
which hurried to run the play before the first-quarter
clock expired.
"They were just real thin on that side and we checked
it outside (at the line]." Lemon said. "The guy who was
playing outside stayed outside, so I went back inside."

Lemon had also used his speed earlier in the first to
score Stanford's first touchdown. Facing first-and-goal
from the 3-yard line, Edwards threw a lateral to the out
side and Lemon beat the Husky defenders to the goal
line.
The pass was barely a lateral, but while its lack of for
ward motion gave Lemon three rushing scores on the
day, it left Edwards without a passing touchdown for the
first time this season. He finished 23-of-33 for 254 yards,
a strong enough performance had it not been for his by
three interceptions — all of which came in or near the
Huskies' end zone.
"He forces some plays," Teevens said. "The tough
thing is the turnovers."
The Huskies scored on James' 1-yard run in the sec
ond quarter and on a 28-yard pass from backup Casey
Paus to Sonny Shackelford late in the fourth. Shack
elford led the Huskies' depleted receiving corps — its
top three receivers all suffered injuries in the Huskies'
previous game — with five catches for 54 yards.
Lemon was the star for Stanford, although Kenneth
Tolon added 44 yards on four carries and Mark Bradford
caught a season-high five passes for 79 yards.
The Cardinal defense was once again staunch, total
ing three sacks, six tackles fora loss and one intercep
tion, which Stanley Wilson returned 51 yards.
"I think their defense is really stout," Gilbertson said.
"They're very good physically."
The Cardinal's win was its first against Washington
since 1994 and just its second in the schools' last 18 meet
ings. There were a mere 27,550 fans on hand to witness
the rare triumph, though — less than half the number
that showed up to watch Stanford play Southern Cali
fornia Sept. 25.
Up next for Stanford are four road games in five con
tests, including Oct. 9's nationally televised game against
former Cardinal head coach Tyrone Willingham at
Notre Dame.
It wasn't always pretty, but the Cardinal did exact
ly what they were supposed to do Saturday at Stan
ford Stadium.
The Cardinal came into Saturday's game at Stan
ford Stadium favored to win by two touchdowns, and
they did exactly that, defeating Washington. 27-13.
Junior tailback J.R. Lemon rushed fora career
high 162 yards and three touchdowns, including a 58-
yard scoring run in the first quarter, and the special
teams blocked two punts, one of which sophomore
Nick Sanchez returned for Stanford's final touch
down.
The big plays helped offset a mistake-filled day for
the Cardinal. Trent Edwards threw three intercep
tions, Lemon lost a fumble, Michael Seroi missed an

extra point and the team committed eight penalties
totaling 77 yards.
"This was the ugliest game 1 think I've ever seen,
and unfortunately I coached in it," head coach Buddy
Teevens said. "I told the guys to take some satisfac
tion in the fact that we played poorly and still came
out on top."
The win was critical for the Cardinal (3-1, 1-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference), who could hardly afford to drop
a home game to the Pac-10's lone winless team.
