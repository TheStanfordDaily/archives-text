# Op-Ed
## Pre-orientation trips need time 
### SARAH RUBINFELD 
While 1 realize the job of an edito
rial board is to provide opinions, 1
must respectfully disagree with those
put forward in The Daily's editorial
on the Stanford Pre-Orientation
Trips (SPOT) program on October 1.
I realize that The Daily's concerns
may be shared by others on campus
who are not familiar with the pro
gram, and this seemed like a good op
portunity to address them.
The goal of everyone involved
with SPOT is to build the program
until it can accommodate all interest
ed students. We sincerely regret that

we are not yet able to do so, and are
actively working on expanding the
program. However, The Daily states
that the opportunity to participate
should either be extended to every
freshman or none at all. If we were to
follow that rule, we would be forced
to settle on none at all, not only now,
but in the future.
Even with infinite resources,
there is simply no way to build a pro
gram like this instantly. Gradual ex
pansion is necessary to train student
trip leaders, explore new trails, ac
quire equipment and maintain our
focus on safely.
As far as our selected applicant

pool, I am in complete agreement
that students from the Northeast are
an arbitrary choice. Yes, we could
just as easily have chosen a different
geographical region, or names from
the beginning of the alphabet, or any
other subgroup of freshmen. The bot
tom line is, there was no non-arbi
trary way to narrow down our appli
cant pool.
And while we could have sent ap
plications to all 160() plus members of
the Class of 2008. the task of printing,
mailing, receiving, and reading those
applications would have been huge.
Give SPOT a chance to shine

not lo mention writing regretful "no"
letters to all the students we would
have had lo turn down. Frankly, we'd
lather spend that time and effort on
expanding the piogiam rather than
on increasing the number of disap
pointed applicants.
I inally, I'lie Daily expresses doubt
as to whether prc-orientation trips

should exist at all. 1 think that if you
talk to those who had the opportunity
to participate, you'll find very few who
think they shouldn't. After all. 100
years ago no one thought New Student
Orientation was necessary either.
SPOT provides a unique opportunity
to meet other new students, ask honest
questions of experienced undergradu
ates and get to know the world around
your new home. It also provides out

door leadership training and experi
ence to a growing group of student trip
leaders, and we encourage all those
who wish they had been able to partic
ipate to get involved as trip leaders and
help the program to grow.
