# Holt's Harangue
## Totally absurd politics 
### 
Kerry and Bush traded words,
looks of consternation, and compli
ments about their daughters. There
were few surprises: Kerry men
tioned Vietnam, Bush mispro
nounced words and both were fea
tured in a dark room, alone, bare
knuckled with only a few feet of blue
carpet and tie selection separating
the two.
But there is another thing that
separates them. According to Presi
dent Bush, Kerry made some state
ments that were "totally absurd."
Let's have you, the reader, be the
judge of what is really absurd, shall
we?
Kerry is, if you didn't know, a flip
flopper. Yep, he changes his mind
the issues. Once he was a Chevy
man; now he drives Fords. I mean,
look at the facts. In the debate, Bush
said Kerry "voted against the $87 bil
lion supplemental to provide equip
ment for our troops, and then said he
actually did vote for it before he
voted against it." If that's not flip
flopping. I don't know what is.
Somehow, though. Bush didn't
expand on the situation. You see,
Kerry originally supported a dif
ferent version of the bill, with a
measly $67 billion in spending.
This version had all the money go
to the troops, but it was opposed
by the administration. Kerry was
against spending an additional $20
billion on reconstruction costs.
The thing is, so were many con
gressional Republicans. That is,
until Bush threatened to veto the
whole thing. So when Bush says
Kerry was flip-flopping on sup
porting our troops, what he means
is that Kerry was actually reacting
to changes in the bill. How absurd!
In Bush's mind, at least, a presi
dent who would veto a bill to sup
port our troops is much better than
a flip-flopper.
Aside from the absurdity of the
two candidates' arguments, there
were also some interesting compar
isons made between their two styles.
During the debate, Kerry was
writing notes the entire time. No
doubt they were letters recanting his
previous statements (that flip-flop
per), or perhaps thank-you letters to
military brass for all those unde
served medals.
In contrast. Bush bounced
around a lot on the podium: He
used this technique to emphasize
points he was making, or to transi
tion ideas, or to accept a cue, or be
cause his link with Karl Rove was

getting static. This is all part of
Bush / Rove's "Sock Monkey"
technique. Bush would move
around and smirk (to amuse the
children) while Karl Rove would
talk through him by use of an ear
piece. It looked like Bush's mouth
was moving, but what's even more
incredible is how Rove's lips hardly

moved.
As an English
major, nothing
resonated with
me more than the
president's vo
cabulary: He ac
cused Kerry of
"maxed mixed
messages," mis
pronounced a
couple leaders'

names, and my favorite, used the
word "vociferously" in a sentence.
Correctly. What 1 really like in a
president is someone who is pre
pared to memorize vocab-increasing
SAT cards.
The funniest line the entire night
was moderator Jim Lehrer's, hands
down. He told the candidates: "We'll
come back to Iraq in a minute." For
those who were counting at home,
everything in the debate was about
Iraq. Next week, it'll be harder for
the candidates to shoehorn their
comments into stabs about Iraq, but
for now that's the only foreign policy
discussed.
Kerry: "The unemployment rate
during your administration..."
Bush: "Stop questioning the war
on Iraq. You flip-flopper."
In a few weeks, we'll have the vice
presidential debates. The presiden
tial debate was held on a college
campus and broadcast over network
television. The VP debate, in con
trast, will be held in a junior high
school gym and broadcast on ham
radio.
Instead of seeing Kerry being a
stiff and Bush being Karl Rove's
sock monkey, we get to see John
Edwards look more and more like
Robin from the Batman comics,
and we get to see Dick Cheney re
semble that bitter, gin-soaked uncle
you keep in the corner at Thanks
giving. This should be an interest
ing, if "totally absurd," fall presi
dential race.

Chris has flip-flopped too. He now
thinks John "Franken" Kerry is the
best debater this side of Transylvania.

Bush: "Stop questioning the war
on Iraq. You flip-flopper."
In a few weeks, we'll have the vice
presidential debates. The presiden
tial debate was held on a college
campus and broadcast over network
television. The VP debate, in con
trast, will be held in a junior high
school gym and broadcast on ham
radio.
Instead of seeing Kerry being a
stiff and Bush being Karl Rove's
sock monkey, we get to see John
Edwards look more and more like
Robin from the Batman comics,
and we get to see Dick Cheney re
semble that bitter, gin-soaked uncle
you keep in the corner at Thanks
giving. This should be an interest
ing, if "totally absurd," fall presi
dential race.

Chris has flip-flopped too. He now
thinks John "Franken" Kerry is the
best debater this side of Transylvania.

Kerry and Bush traded words,
looks of consternation, and compli
ments about their daughters. There
were few surprises: Kerry men
tioned Vietnam, Bush mispro
nounced words and both were fea
tured in a dark room, alone, bare
knuckled with only a few feet of blue
carpet and tie selection separating
the two.
But there is another thing that
separates them. According to Presi
dent Bush, Kerry made some state
ments that were "totally absurd."
Let's have you, the reader, be the
judge of what is really absurd, shall
we?
Kerry is, if you didn't know, a flip
flopper. Yep, he changes his mind
the issues. Once he was a Chevy
man; now he drives Fords. I mean,
look at the facts. In the debate, Bush
said Kerry "voted against the $87 bil
lion supplemental to provide equip
ment for our troops, and then said he
actually did vote for it before he
voted against it." If that's not flip
flopping. I don't know what is.
Somehow, though. Bush didn't
expand on the situation. You see,
Kerry originally supported a dif
ferent version of the bill, with a
measly $67 billion in spending.
This version had all the money go
to the troops, but it was opposed
by the administration. Kerry was
against spending an additional $20
billion on reconstruction costs.
The thing is, so were many con
gressional Republicans. That is,
until Bush threatened to veto the
whole thing. So when Bush says
Kerry was flip-flopping on sup
porting our troops, what he means
is that Kerry was actually reacting
to changes in the bill. How absurd!
In Bush's mind, at least, a presi
dent who would veto a bill to sup
port our troops is much better than
a flip-flopper.
Aside from the absurdity of the
two candidates' arguments, there
were also some interesting compar
isons made between their two styles.
During the debate, Kerry was
writing notes the entire time. No
doubt they were letters recanting his
previous statements (that flip-flop
per), or perhaps thank-you letters to
military brass for all those unde
served medals.
In contrast. Bush bounced
around a lot on the podium: He
used this technique to emphasize
points he was making, or to transi
tion ideas, or to accept a cue, or be
cause his link with Karl Rove was

getting static. This is all part of
Bush / Rove's "Sock Monkey"
technique. Bush would move
around and smirk (to amuse the
children) while Karl Rove would
talk through him by use of an ear
piece. It looked like Bush's mouth
was moving, but what's even more
incredible is how Rove's lips hardly

moved.
As an English
major, nothing
resonated with
me more than the
president's vo
cabulary: He ac
cused Kerry of
"maxed mixed
messages," mis
pronounced a
couple leaders'

names, and my favorite, used the
word "vociferously" in a sentence.
Correctly. What 1 really like in a
president is someone who is pre
pared to memorize vocab-increasing
SAT cards.
The funniest line the entire night
was moderator Jim Lehrer's, hands
down. He told the candidates: "We'll
come back to Iraq in a minute." For
those who were counting at home,
everything in the debate was about
Iraq. Next week, it'll be harder for
the candidates to shoehorn their
comments into stabs about Iraq, but
for now that's the only foreign policy
discussed.
Kerry: "The unemployment rate
during your administration..."
Bush: "Stop questioning the war
on Iraq. You flip-flopper."
