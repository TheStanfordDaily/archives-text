Pre-orientation trips achieve
objectives, should be encouraged
The Daily's Friday Editorial re
garding pre-orientation week camp
ing trips seems to scream "that's not
fair!"
Unfortunately, it was also hope
lessly myopic in its view. There are
many means for incoming freshmen
to meet their classmates and not all
are available to everyone.
Too bad.
Some incoming freshmen have
high school classmates who will also
be attending Stanford. To what ex
tent is that not fair to those who are
the onlv one from their high school?

How should we correct it?
Should the admission department
only offer admission to people
where more than one person from
their high school is qualified?
Should they revoke an offer of ad
mission if one of two students de
clines? Of course not.
Some incoming freshmen live in
areas with many other incoming
freshmen. It is often the case that
the local alumni club will hold a re
ception for this group. To what ex
tent is that not fair to those who
are from areas of the world with
out a concentration of incoming
freshmen? Should the nearest
alumni club pay to fly them to an

other part of the world so that they
can attend such an event? Of
course not.
This new program was, in effect,
a pilot. The plan is to expand it. Pilot
programs make mistakes. That's
why they're called pilot programs.
But the bottom line is that
there are many ways for incom
ing freshmen to meet each other
and network long before Orien
tation Week. Those methods old
and new should be applauded
and encouraged, not criticized
and discouraged.

Cheer Squad should have a place
at sporting events
This Daily editorial is way off the
mark ("Dancing should be left to
Dollies," Oct. 1). As an alum and
former member of Axe Comm, 1
support the Competitive Cheer
squad and hope the young squad
continues to grow in a difficult sport.
Kudos to any group that wants to
add spirit to a sometimes moribund
stadium.
Dollies, 1 support your squad, but
let's be real, five dancers in a
seat-plus stadium doesn't add up to
the "dramatic effect" that the edi
tor's seem to think. And if the five

dancers are feeling any heat from
another squad, then raise your rou
tines to another level. Simple as that.
Cheer on. cheer squad. The more
the merrier, and go Stanford.

Flip Flop sandals are hazardous
The Daily should be applauded
for pointing out the hazards of flip
flops; awareness is the first step in
the right direction. After my own
mishap. I had hoped to wage a cam
pus wide campaign against flip
flops, but now that I have graduated

I can only tell my story:
Sophomore year, I flopped out of
my trusty flip-flops. Hipped down the
concrete stairs and was stranded in
the Mirlo stairwell until friends dis
covered me. I did not make it to class
on time, and my flip-Hops quickly out
grew their dollar price tag: Two years,
two surgeries, two crutches and a
cane later, 1 can walk and run again.
1 still have the Speak I )p for Safety pin
that I was given at the hospital. I was for
tunate, but for some, by the time one gets
to the hospital it is t<xi late to speak up.
Start now, wear sneakers and save flip
flops for gymnastics.
