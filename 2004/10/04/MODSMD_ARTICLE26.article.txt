## Voting junior off to war abroad 
### DAVE YUNZER 
Moms, dads, grandmas, grand
pas, aunts, uncles, and yes, you, the
19-to-25 year old male and female,
get ready to send your child off to
combat or go to combat. The Bush
administration, after horribly
bungling our righteous, wrathful re
sponse to the 9/11 attacks has the
cross hairs of the first draft since
1973 squarely on your kids' fore
head. Denials abound, but you can
take that to the bank.
Shortly after the 9/11 attacks.
President George W. Bush, Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the
Congress asked then-Army Chief of
Staff, General Eric Shinscki how
many troops he thought it would
take to stabilize Iraq after a poten
tial invasion. Shinscki — a seasoned
combat veteran, a serious scholar of
warfare, the best military mind the
Army had to offer with over 35 years
of practicing the military art — said
it would take 300.000 troops.
This was not what Bush or
Rumsfeld wanted to hear since
those high, albeit accurate, num
bers of deployed American soldiers
were militarily and politically un
sustainable. Shinscki was treated as
a pariah by the administration for
his candor and subsequently retired
with honor and integrity while the
administration pressed its lie that
Iraq could be managed with
130,000 troops.
One thousand and fifty-one pre
cious, brave and dead American C ils

later, 7,250 beautiful sons and
daughters maimed and disfigured
later, 30.(M)0 dead Iraqis later, whiz
kids Bush and Rumsfeld know that
Shinseki was right, and they're
scrambling like all heck to come
with poor kids, yours and my sons
and daughters, to feed their mis
guided war machine.
Hear what some professional
military, political and media people
have to say about the administra
tion's unacknowledged plan to get
your kids into camouflage and com
bat quicker that you can say four
more years.
On Sept. 23, the New York Times
reported that a pentagon panel of out
side experts concluded that the mili
tary does not have sufficient forces to
sustain current and anticipated opera
tions in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Senator Jack Reed relayed the
report the following day. Defense
Secretary Rumsfeld categorized this
very report as an excellent piece of
work.
The Defense Science Board fur
ther said there are inadequate total
numbers of U.S. troops.
Craig Fields, a former chairman
of the Defense Science Board, and
Philip Odeen, a former senior De
fense Department official, referring
to the current inadequate number of
ground troops, concluded that
something started wrong tends to
continue wrong.
On Sept. 23, Inside the Pentagon,
a military affairs newsletter, said
current force structure will not sus

tain our commitments.
This past January, Michael
Wynne, undersecretary of defense,
said current operations in
Afghanistan and Iraq will not be the
last of such operations.
Defense Secretary Rumsfeld said
that if current initiatives fail to ad
dress military manpower needs,
then we'll have to increase military
end strength.
On Sept. 23, the Washington Post
reported that General John
Abizaid, commander of U.S. forces
in Iraq, said more forces will be
needed in Iraq. He said he'd like
them to be Iraqi troops (fat chance).
He did come clean to some extent
saying we can't discount more
American troops. Both Rumsfeld
and Bush said that if U.S. comman
ders do ask for new troops, they'll
get them.
Senator Joseph Lieberman, a
member of the Armed Services
Committee, also acknowledged the
possibility more U.S. forces could be
necessary. Senator John Cornyn, a
Republican from Texas, mentioned
queries about countless emails and
claims of a draft plan after the
November elections.
On Sept. 21, Bloomberg.com re
ported that Representative Jack
Murtha, the senior Democrat on
the House defense appropriations
subcommittee, similarly reported
an administration plan to mobilize
unspecified numbers of the Individ
ual Ready Reserve. These are sol
diers that served their active duty
time, were honorably discharged,
and will be called back for combat
in Iraq.
Secretary Rumsfeld and Gener
al Meyers, the top military com
mander, denied any secret, post
election call-up plans. However, on
Sept. 15, the Army did activate 800
members of the Ready Reserve and
plans to activate an additional 4,800
by December, with the potential to
go higher. Both Rumsfeld and Mey
ers acknowledged this to be true.
On Sept. 23, the Associated Press
reported that Lt. Gen. Steven Blum,
chief of the National Guard Bureau,
said the Guard will fall short of this
year's recruiting goal by 5,000 sol
diers.
Last month. Inside the Pentagon,
reported that a senior Pentagon pol
icy official, William Luti, stated that
the Bush administration, if it wins a
second term, may carry its pre-emp
tive war strategy to five or six other
nations.
OK, you get the point. Fellow
parents, grandparents and young
Americans, this administration is on
an inexorable path to instituting a
new draft. It may be an actual draft;
it may come in the form of a stop loss,
an existing Pentagon program that
shanghais currently serving troops
into serving past their separation
dates; or, you might find all of our re
servists drafted back to active duty.
Some things you can be sure of:
President Bush attacked the wrong
country, ignored military advice
over political expediency; Iraq is in
the toilet; the Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds,
Baath loyalists and Imams will agree
on an Iraqi policy when the Hat
field's and McCoy's host a love fest;
and finally, my kid and your kid may
be drafted to die in Iraq for the buf
foonery of President Bush, and it
breaks my heart.
