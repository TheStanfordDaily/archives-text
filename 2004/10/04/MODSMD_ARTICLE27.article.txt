## Card fall to Bruins 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Four wins in live games.
Stanford men's water polo (11-2.1 -0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
just kept on rounding up those victo
> ries — until a 10-9 overtime loss in the
Northern California tournament.
The top-ranked team inched closer
to its goal, but in its final game of a
busy weekend and the final game of
the tournament, the Cardinal fell to
No. 4 UCLA (9-2.0-OMPSF).
Stanford didn't face too much trou
ble in adding the VV's to ils record until
last night. The defining moment that
might have led to the squad's second
loss of the season?
"The ejection (of Tony Azevedo)
— that cost us the game," said head
Coach John Vargas, also mentioning
that Thomas Hopkins led the Cardinal
with three goals.
The Cardinal did kick off the week
end right, however, with a 15-4 home
win over No. 12 Princeton (11-3) Fri
day evening.
Junior driver Greg Ci urn's back

hand shot into the goal began the ac
tion less than a minute into the game.
Senior driver Tony Azevedo lobbed a
shot over the head of senior Princeton
goalkeeper Peter Sabatini for the Car
dinal's second goal.
Crum easily pushed the ball into the
cage for his second goal, and junior
driver Peter Varellas scored off an as
sist from Azevedo in the first period to
put Stanford up 4-0.
With the help of a couple saves by
Chad Taylor, the Cardinal were able to
quickly get the ball from defense back
on offense in the first half, enabling
them to score goal after goal.
Azevedo led the charge with five
goals in the game, followed by Varel
las, who scored three.
After the first period, the Tigers
didn't have much of a chance to catch
up. The closest threat they posed came
in the first, and even then the Tigers
could only get three goals past Taylor.
Stanford shut out the East Coasters in
the second and third periods, shutting
the door on any possibility of a Princeton win.
In the first day of play at the NorCal tournament in
Stockton, CA, Stanford waited for host No. 16 Pacific
(4-7,0-0 MPSF) to heat No. 20 Cal Baptist before con
tinuing its impressive scoring. Junior driver Thomas
Hopkins scored four times in the Stanford win, with fel
low '06 class member Varellas following closely behind
in scoring with three goals.
By the end of the first half, the Cardinal led 9-1,
thanks to a 4-0 first period start. The squad outscored
the Tigers seven to five in the second half en route to a
16-6 victory.
In its second match of the day, Stanford jumped out
to a decisive lead once again and didn't look back as it
beat No. 6 UC-San Diego (15-5). While the Tritons
stayed in the game during the first period, putting up
two goals to the Cardinal's five, the Stanford squad
managed to pull away 9-1 by the end of the first half.
Both teams scored five goals in the second half, but
the Stanford defense was able to keep San Diego at bay
long enough to break the Tritons' eight-game winning
streak.
Jesse Casellini, Joe Woodring and Adnan Jerkovic
each scored twice for San Diego. Azevedo and Varellas
each scored three times during the game in leading the

Stanford offense.
Rounding up victories stayed present in the Cardi
nal's minds Sunday morning in their match against
cross-bay rival No. 3 California (10-1, 0-0 MPSF) in its
semi-final. Stanford beat former NorCal tournament
champion Cal, 12-7, to advance to the final game, where
it was sure to face a Southern California foe.
Second ranked Southern California (9-2,0-1 MPSF)
avoided what was sure to be another aggressive and
well-played match against heated rival Stanford when it
fell to UCLA in its semifinal game 8-6.
The Trojans were shut out in the second and third
periods but put up four goals in the final period, scaring
the Bruins, who only managed one more goal in the
fourth.
The Bruins previously beat Navy and escaped Irvine
to advance out of Saturday's games.
Out of 20 teams, UCLA and Stanford were the
teams to meet at Pacific, 5:30 P.M Sunday, for the Nor-
Cal title game. In the similar Southern California tour
nament two weeks ago, the Bruins placed fourth. Stan
ford took second in the SoCal tournament as USC won
that title.
As for what some might still see as a successful week
end, Vargas could only say, "Fine, it's fine."

Men take 4 of 5
but drop final

the Tigers seven to five in the second half en route to a
16-6 victory.
In its second match of the day, Stanford jumped out
to a decisive lead once again and didn't look back as it
beat No. 6 UC-San Diego (15-5). While the Tritons
stayed in the game during the first period, putting up
two goals to the Cardinal's five, the Stanford squad
managed to pull away 9-1 by the end of the first half.
Both teams scored five goals in the second half, but
the Stanford defense was able to keep San Diego at bay
long enough to break the Tritons' eight-game winning
streak.
Jesse Casellini, Joe Woodring and Adnan Jerkovic
each scored twice for San Diego. Azevedo and Varellas
each scored three times during the game in leading the

Stanford offense.
Rounding up victories stayed present in the Cardi
nal's minds Sunday morning in their match against
cross-bay rival No. 3 California (10-1, 0-0 MPSF) in its
semi-final. Stanford beat former NorCal tournament
champion Cal, 12-7, to advance to the final game, where
it was sure to face a Southern California foe.
Second ranked Southern California (9-2,0-1 MPSF)
avoided what was sure to be another aggressive and
well-played match against heated rival Stanford when it
fell to UCLA in its semifinal game 8-6.
The Trojans were shut out in the second and third
periods but put up four goals in the final period, scaring
the Bruins, who only managed one more goal in the
fourth.
The Bruins previously beat Navy and escaped Irvine
to advance out of Saturday's games.
Out of 20 teams, UCLA and Stanford were the
teams to meet at Pacific, 5:30 P.M Sunday, for the Nor-
Cal title game. In the similar Southern California tour
nament two weeks ago, the Bruins placed fourth. Stan
ford took second in the SoCal tournament as USC won
that title.
As for what some might still see as a successful week
end, Vargas could only say, "Fine, it's fine."

Men take 4 of 5
but drop final

Senior utilityman Sam Tyre pushes ahead for the Cardinal. Stanford finished the weekend in Stockton 4-1.
Four wins in live games.
Stanford men's water polo (11-2.1 -0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
just kept on rounding up those victo
> ries — until a 10-9 overtime loss in the
Northern California tournament.
The top-ranked team inched closer
to its goal, but in its final game of a
busy weekend and the final game of
the tournament, the Cardinal fell to
No. 4 UCLA (9-2.0-OMPSF).
Stanford didn't face too much trou
ble in adding the VV's to ils record until
last night. The defining moment that
might have led to the squad's second
loss of the season?
"The ejection (of Tony Azevedo)
— that cost us the game," said head
Coach John Vargas, also mentioning
that Thomas Hopkins led the Cardinal
with three goals.
The Cardinal did kick off the week
end right, however, with a 15-4 home
win over No. 12 Princeton (11-3) Fri
day evening.
Junior driver Greg Ci urn's back

hand shot into the goal began the ac
tion less than a minute into the game.
Senior driver Tony Azevedo lobbed a
shot over the head of senior Princeton
goalkeeper Peter Sabatini for the Car
dinal's second goal.
Crum easily pushed the ball into the
cage for his second goal, and junior
driver Peter Varellas scored off an as
sist from Azevedo in the first period to
put Stanford up 4-0.
With the help of a couple saves by
Chad Taylor, the Cardinal were able to
quickly get the ball from defense back
on offense in the first half, enabling
them to score goal after goal.
Azevedo led the charge with five
goals in the game, followed by Varel
las, who scored three.
After the first period, the Tigers
didn't have much of a chance to catch
up. The closest threat they posed came
in the first, and even then the Tigers
could only get three goals past Taylor.
Stanford shut out the East Coasters in
the second and third periods, shutting
the door on any possibility of a Princeton win.
In the first day of play at the NorCal tournament in
Stockton, CA, Stanford waited for host No. 16 Pacific
(4-7,0-0 MPSF) to heat No. 20 Cal Baptist before con
tinuing its impressive scoring. Junior driver Thomas
Hopkins scored four times in the Stanford win, with fel
low '06 class member Varellas following closely behind
in scoring with three goals.
By the end of the first half, the Cardinal led 9-1,
thanks to a 4-0 first period start. The squad outscored
the Tigers seven to five in the second half en route to a
16-6 victory.
