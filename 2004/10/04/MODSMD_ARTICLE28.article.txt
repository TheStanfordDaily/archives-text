# Men's soccer storms back to tie No. 10 Cal
## 
### JESSICA PETERS MANAGING EDITOR 
It was one of those nights when the
erowd of Stanford fans at Maloney Field al
ternated between leaping up and scream
ing in excitement and jumping to its feet
and staring open-mouthed in disbelief.
The Cardinal men's soccer team (5-1-3,
0-0-1 Pacific-10 Conference) battled to a 2-
2 tie with No. 10 California (7-0-2, 0-0-1
Pac-10) after 110 minutes of unconvention
al scoring opportunities and tough strug
gles for possession.
The Golden Bears got onto the board
first after sophomore midfielder Nick
Hatzke drilled a 20-yard free kick past Car
dinal senior goalkeeper Robby Fulton and
into the net in the 15th minute. The free
kick was awarded after Fulton was whistled
for handling the ball outside the box.
Technically, the Cardinal scored three
goals on the night, but one proved to be just
a stroke of good fortune for Cal. In the 39th
minute, a Bears corner kick landed in traf

lie in front of the goal and in a bout of con
fusion. the ball was knocked into the goal
by a Cardinal player. The stunned looks on
the faces of the Stanford athletes said it all.
"1 think in the first half we made a cou
ple of mistakes, especially on restarts." said
Stanford head coach Bret Simon. "[Cal] is a
terrific team on restarts. 1 think that we al
lowed them to get into positions where they
could really make the most of it."
The chances that the Cardinal could
overcome an embarrassing mistake like
scoring a goal for its opponent may have
seemed slim, but the team regrouped at
halftime and defeated the odds, continuing
to put together strong attacks.
The efforts paid off in an unexpected
way when sophomore midfielder Bret
Shimizu was fouled to set up a penalty kick.
The Cardinal opted to send senior forward
Matt Janusz into the one-on-one with Cal
junior goalkeeper Eric Kronberg, and
Janusz won the face-off, boosting the ball

That first goal seemed to be just what the Cardinal
needed, as the squad's play jumped up a notch for the re
mainder of the second half. Stanford continued to move
the ball well in the attacking third and the Cardinal de
fenders held the Bears to a single shot in the period.
In the 88th minute Stanford finally caught the break it
needed. Shimizu dropped a pass in front of the goal
which was deflected by a diving Kronberg. Senior Seyi
Abolaji found senior striker Darren Fernandez a few
feet from the goal and Fernandez headed the ball into
the net to even up the score and send the contest into
overtime.
The second half epitomized the energy of the Stan
ford squad as it showed its ability to compete with some
of the best teams in the nation. The Cardinal outshot Cal
10-6 in regulation and held the Bears' biggest offensive
threat, senior Carl Acosta, to three shots and no goals
during the contest.
"We played more attacking players than we have in
the past and that made us more dangerous in that re
spect," Simon said. "But every positive has a negative —
by throwing more attacking players on the field, you

make yourself more vulnerable to the Cal attacking
players."
The Golden Bears came out lighting in overtime,
maintaining more possessions than the Cardinal and out
shooting Stanford 7-1 over the two OT periods. Fulton
made four saves after the end of regulation — he had
only two in the first 90 minutes of the game — to halt the
Bears' hopes fora "W." Stanford simply couldn't get off
a solid shot.
The tie allows Cal to remain one of six currently un
defeated men's soccer squads in the country. No. 1 UC-
Santa Barbara, No. 2 UNC Greensboro, No. 5 New Mex
ico. No. 7 Duke and No. 19 South Florida are the others.
Simon called the draw a positive result for his squad,
especially considering the tough Pac-10 schedule that
awaits Stanford.
"1 believe Cal is one of the top four or five teams in the
country." Simon said, "And it says a lot that we played
them to a draw. I don't expect that we'll see a better team
than Cal this year."
The Cardinal will take to the road this weekend for
conference contests against Washington (8-3-1, 1-0-0
Pac-10) and Oregon State (5-5-1,0-1-0 Pac-10).

"1 believe Cal is one of the top four or five teams in the
country." Simon said, "And it says a lot that we played
them to a draw. I don't expect that we'll see a better team
than Cal this year."
The Cardinal will take to the road this weekend for
conference contests against Washington (8-3-1, 1-0-0
Pac-10) and Oregon State (5-5-1,0-1-0 Pac-10).
It was one of those nights when the
erowd of Stanford fans at Maloney Field al
ternated between leaping up and scream
ing in excitement and jumping to its feet
and staring open-mouthed in disbelief.
The Cardinal men's soccer team (5-1-3,
0-0-1 Pacific-10 Conference) battled to a 2-
2 tie with No. 10 California (7-0-2, 0-0-1
Pac-10) after 110 minutes of unconvention
al scoring opportunities and tough strug
gles for possession.
The Golden Bears got onto the board
first after sophomore midfielder Nick
Hatzke drilled a 20-yard free kick past Car
dinal senior goalkeeper Robby Fulton and
into the net in the 15th minute. The free
kick was awarded after Fulton was whistled
for handling the ball outside the box.
Technically, the Cardinal scored three
goals on the night, but one proved to be just
a stroke of good fortune for Cal. In the 39th
minute, a Bears corner kick landed in traf

lie in front of the goal and in a bout of con
fusion. the ball was knocked into the goal
by a Cardinal player. The stunned looks on
the faces of the Stanford athletes said it all.
"1 think in the first half we made a cou
ple of mistakes, especially on restarts." said
Stanford head coach Bret Simon. "[Cal] is a
terrific team on restarts. 1 think that we al
lowed them to get into positions where they
could really make the most of it."
The chances that the Cardinal could
overcome an embarrassing mistake like
scoring a goal for its opponent may have
seemed slim, but the team regrouped at
halftime and defeated the odds, continuing
to put together strong attacks.
The efforts paid off in an unexpected
way when sophomore midfielder Bret
Shimizu was fouled to set up a penalty kick.
The Cardinal opted to send senior forward
Matt Janusz into the one-on-one with Cal
junior goalkeeper Eric Kronberg, and

That first goal seemed to be just what the Cardinal
needed, as the squad's play jumped up a notch for the re
mainder of the second half. Stanford continued to move
the ball well in the attacking third and the Cardinal de
fenders held the Bears to a single shot in the period.
In the 88th minute Stanford finally caught the break it
needed. Shimizu dropped a pass in front of the goal
which was deflected by a diving Kronberg. Senior Seyi
Abolaji found senior striker Darren Fernandez a few
feet from the goal and Fernandez headed the ball into
the net to even up the score and send the contest into
overtime.
The second half epitomized the energy of the Stan
ford squad as it showed its ability to compete with some
of the best teams in the nation. The Cardinal outshot Cal
10-6 in regulation and held the Bears' biggest offensive
threat, senior Carl Acosta, to three shots and no goals
during the contest.
"We played more attacking players than we have in
the past and that made us more dangerous in that re
spect," Simon said. "But every positive has a negative —
by throwing more attacking players on the field, you

make yourself more vulnerable to the Cal attacking
players."
The Golden Bears came out lighting in overtime,
maintaining more possessions than the Cardinal and out
shooting Stanford 7-1 over the two OT periods. Fulton
made four saves after the end of regulation — he had
only two in the first 90 minutes of the game — to halt the
Bears' hopes fora "W." Stanford simply couldn't get off
a solid shot.
The tie allows Cal to remain one of six currently un
defeated men's soccer squads in the country. No. 1 UC-
Santa Barbara, No. 2 UNC Greensboro, No. 5 New Mex
ico. No. 7 Duke and No. 19 South Florida are the others.
Simon called the draw a positive result for his squad,
especially considering the tough Pac-10 schedule that
awaits Stanford.
"1 believe Cal is one of the top four or five teams in the
country." Simon said, "And it says a lot that we played
them to a draw. I don't expect that we'll see a better team
than Cal this year."
The Cardinal will take to the road this weekend for
conference contests against Washington (8-3-1, 1-0-0
Pac-10) and Oregon State (5-5-1,0-1-0 Pac-10).
