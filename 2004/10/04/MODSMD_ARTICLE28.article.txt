### JESSICA PETERS MANAGING EDITOR 
It was one of those nights when the
erowd of Stanford fans at Maloney Field al
ternated between leaping up and scream
ing in excitement and jumping to its feet
and staring open-mouthed in disbelief.
The Cardinal men's soccer team (5-1-3,
0-0-1 Pacific-10 Conference) battled to a 2-
2 tie with No. 10 California (7-0-2, 0-0-1
Pac-10) after 110 minutes of unconvention
al scoring opportunities and tough strug
gles for possession.
The Golden Bears got onto the board
first after sophomore midfielder Nick
Hatzke drilled a 20-yard free kick past Car
dinal senior goalkeeper Robby Fulton and
into the net in the 15th minute. The free
kick was awarded after Fulton was whistled
for handling the ball outside the box.
Technically, the Cardinal scored three
goals on the night, but one proved to be just
a stroke of good fortune for Cal. In the 39th
minute, a Bears corner kick landed in traf

lie in front of the goal and in a bout of con
fusion. the ball was knocked into the goal
by a Cardinal player. The stunned looks on
the faces of the Stanford athletes said it all.
"1 think in the first half we made a cou
ple of mistakes, especially on restarts." said
Stanford head coach Bret Simon. "[Cal] is a
terrific team on restarts. 1 think that we al
lowed them to get into positions where they
could really make the most of it."
The chances that the Cardinal could
overcome an embarrassing mistake like
scoring a goal for its opponent may have
seemed slim, but the team regrouped at
halftime and defeated the odds, continuing
to put together strong attacks.
The efforts paid off in an unexpected
way when sophomore midfielder Bret
Shimizu was fouled to set up a penalty kick.
The Cardinal opted to send senior forward
Matt Janusz into the one-on-one with Cal
junior goalkeeper Eric Kronberg, and
