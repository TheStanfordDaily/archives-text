# Volleyball downs Bears
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW 
Milestones are meant to be reached, and
that's just what happened in Burnham Pavil
ion on Friday night.
Going into the match against the No. 12
California Golden Bears (7-5. 2-1 Pacific-10
Conference), Stanford head coach John
Dunning had 99 wins with the Cardinal vol -
leyball program. Senior outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani needed only five kills to
move into fifth place on the Pac-10 all-time
kills list, having moved into sixth place on
Tuesday. Sophomore middle blocker Lizzie
Suiter had topped or matched her career
high blocking total in each of the last three
matches.
Friday's sellout crowd of 1,441 — the ma
jority clad in white Nike T-shirts handed out
at the door — saw two of these landmarks
reached in the three-hour match, won by No.
11 Stanford (10-3, 3-0 Pac-10) in five games,
30-28,28-30,30-27,28-30,15-13.
Dunning got his 100 th win. making his ca
reer record with Stanford an impressive 100-
16 (.855).
Nnamani got the five kills she needed to
overtake Christine Gardner of Arizona
State, and then some, finishing the night with
a match-leading 28 kills fora career total of
1,894. Cal was led by freshman Angie Pressey
with 18 kills.
Lizzie Suiter did not reach her career high
of 10 blocks on Friday, settling fora re
spectable seven blocks and five kills.
Though Suiter was not as productive as in
recent games, the rest of the team stepped up,
fora team total of 18 blocks, nine more than
Cal. Six players on the Stanford roster had
blocks, including freshman middle blocker
Franci Girard with six block assists and fresh
man setter Bryn Kehoe with seven. Camille
Leffall was the top blocker for the Golden
Bears with six, including one solo.
Stanford entered this match with a record
of 9-3,2-0 Pac-10, having just lost a non-con
ference match to Saint Mary's. Rather than
be discouraged by the loss, the team looked
at it as a source of inspiration.
"We took it as extra motivation." Nna
mani said. "It was annoying, frustrating to
lose to a team two times in the same season,
but there's nothing we could [do] about that
game. It was over. We had to move on ... For
playing our rival team, we couldn't ask for
any more motivation."
This victory helped erase memories not
only of last week's match with Saint Mary's,

but also of last year's stunning defeat at the
hands of the Cal Bears. Last fall. Cal sur
prised the Cardinal with a thrilling five-game
victory in Berkeley's Haas Pavilion, ending a
21-year drought against Stanford. Stanford
won its next meeting, 3-1.
Cal returns all of the starters from last
year's team except star outside hitter Mia
Jerkov of Croatia, who was unable to return
to the team because of NCAA eligibility
rules.
Play was very even in the first game on Fri
day, but Stanford was finally able to build a
six-point lead before Cal closed the gap to 28-
27, capitalizing on Stanford miscommunica
tion. strong play at the net. and consecutive
aces by setter Samantha Carter. Stanford's
Girard ended the game with a kill off a quick
set. giving Stanford the first game with a score
of 30-28.
Despite inspired play by Stanford's Kehoe
and Girard, Cal took the second game by a
score of 30-28, helped greatly by the passing
of sophomore libero Jillian Davis, who led all
players with 33 total digs. Cal put the game
away on a missed connection by Stanford.
The Cardinal's defense helped the team to
an eight-point lead (17-9) midway through
the third game, winning three consecutive
points on blocks. Cal moved within live, but
the momentum stayed in the Cardinal's favor
when a service ace barely clipped a Cal play
er on its way out of bounds. A Cal hitting
error gave Stanford game point at 29-26 and
a kill by Jennifer Hucke gave the game to
Stanford, 30-27.
Overcoming a five-point deficit, Stanford
gained a 16-15 lead in the fourth game after
three consecutive kills by Nnamani, a Hucke
kill, an ace by Kehoe and three scorching kills
from sophomore Kristen Richards. Cal fought
back to take the lead, and a deep tip by middle
blocker Alicia Powers gave the Golden Bears
the point they needed fora 28-30 victory in the
fourth game, forcing a decisive fifth.
Cal jumped out to a 6-2 lead in the fifth,
but an Amanda Fox hitting error, solo block
by Richards, and errors by Fox, Powers, and
Abernathy turned a four-point Stanford
deficit into a tie. Stanford took its first lead of
the game at 11-10 when Fox hit the ball out to
end the longest rally of the match. A Nna
mani kill gave Stanford match point at 14-13,
and a block by Suiter gave the Cardinal the
victory.
Stanford next faces No. 3 Southern Cali
fornia (8-2,3-1) and No. 10 UCLA (10-3,3-1)
on the road.
