# Paradise Pizza serves alcohol at Coffee House
## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
Every day during the last school year, at least
one student would come into the Stanford Coffee
House and ask Supervisor Jordan Huizing the same
question: "Where's the beer?"
A sign on the door stated that due to the change
in ownership from Bon Apetit to Stanford Dining,
the CoHo had not secured a new liquor license, hut
alcohol would be available soon.
"Students were very adamant about it," Huizing
said. "I'd try to explain that we were waiting for legal
clearance, and their eyes would sort of glaze over."
Several months later, during spring quarter of
last year, the CoHo struck a deal with Paradise
Pizza that allowed the latter to provide and serve al
cohol at the CoHo. Unbeknownst to many students,
who are unaware of the new arrangement, they can
now go to the CoHo for beer, pear cider and wine.
"Paradise Pizza's name has the liquor license,"
explained Paradise Pizza Manager Dan Overton.
"We can't pour at our location [in Tresidder], so our
employees pour here. CoHo employees don't touch
the beer."
Paradise Pizza stocks the bar, employs the bar-

The Coffee House is once again serving beer and wine, after being dry for months while its liquor li
cense application was pending.

tenders and claims the profits. The CoHo has no plans to
acquire its own license and take over the bar.
"That's not a goal," Huizing said. "Paradise Pizza is
doing an excellent job of handling it."
Those students who are aware of the new bar express
enthusiasm.
When asked for their reactions to the development,
seniors Erin Lashnits, Abby McDaniel and Alicia
Dant/.ker responded, in unison, "Oh, it's awesome."
Lashnits added, "I think the option of having an on
campus bar is good because downtown Palo Alto can
seem really far away."
"It could turn the CoHo back into a social gathering
venue for students," senior Mike Asmar said. "I'm not
much of a patron right now, but I feel like I'll probably
spend more time there this year."

"It's cheaper than the Nuthouse, surprisingly," said
Chris Ayer, class of 2004 and aspiring musician. "And, as
someone who plays there, [I can say that] it definitely
helps bring people out to shows."
Managers say that they have not yet seen a noticeable
increase in customers or performers.
"There's been no dramatic increase, and program
ming has been pretty consistent," Huizing said. "The
same bands are still drawing the same crowds."
"One increase might be in sporting-event viewing,"
she added.
Mahiri Moore, supervisor for the Subway restaurant
in Tresidder, who often fills in at the CoHo, agreed with
Huizing but added that it might be too soon to tell.
"We have to see what's going on first," he laughed.
"The year's just starting."
