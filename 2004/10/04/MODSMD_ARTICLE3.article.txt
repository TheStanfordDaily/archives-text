# Paradise Pizza serves alcohol at Coffee House
## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
Every day during the last school year, at least
one student would come into the Stanford Coffee
House and ask Supervisor Jordan Huizing the same
question: "Where's the beer?"
A sign on the door stated that due to the change
in ownership from Bon Apetit to Stanford Dining,
the CoHo had not secured a new liquor license, hut
alcohol would be available soon.
"Students were very adamant about it," Huizing
said. "I'd try to explain that we were waiting for legal
clearance, and their eyes would sort of glaze over."
Several months later, during spring quarter of
last year, the CoHo struck a deal with Paradise
Pizza that allowed the latter to provide and serve al
cohol at the CoHo. Unbeknownst to many students,
who are unaware of the new arrangement, they can
now go to the CoHo for beer, pear cider and wine.
"Paradise Pizza's name has the liquor license,"
explained Paradise Pizza Manager Dan Overton.
"We can't pour at our location [in Tresidder], so our
employees pour here. CoHo employees don't touch
the beer."
Paradise Pizza stocks the bar, employs the bar-

The Coffee House is once again serving beer and wine, after being dry for months while its liquor li
cense application was pending.
