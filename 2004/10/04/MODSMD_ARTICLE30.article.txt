# Women's soccer sneaks by St. Mary's in thriller
## 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following Thursday night's grueling double
overtime tie with Santa C lara, the Stanford
women's soccer team was hoping fora less intense
matchup against Bay Area rival St. Mary's on Sun
day. The game was anything but relaxed, however,
as the Cardinal (8-2-1) and Gaels (8-4-0) were
deadlocked through the game's final minutes.
The No. 16 Cardinal eventually broke through
the 1-1 tie with just six minutes, 47 seconds re
maining in regulation.
Junior midfielder Leah Tapscott, who had
been trying to find the net all afternoon, got the
game-winner with a kick into the left corner of the
goal.
The Cardinal have now won seven of their last
eight games and have not lost since Sept. 3.
The Gaels, on the other hand, suffered their
third loss in four games.
The thrilling finish began when senior defender
Emilee Shim made a leading pass through several
Gael defenders. As the ball rolled towards the St.
Mary's net, both Tapscott and St. Mary s goal
keeper Andrea Lee raced alter it.
It was Tapscott who arrived at the ball first, just

ahead of a sliding Lee. She fired a desperation shot
that went up and over the Gael goalkeeper and into
the empty net.
Tapscott, on the ground after colliding with Lee,
was soon engulfed by her Stanford teammates.
"Emilee put a beautiful through ball into the
space for Leah and Leah had great running off the
ball and connected," said head coach Paul Rat
cliffe. who defeated St. Mary's for the second time
since leaving the school two years ago. "It was a
great goal late in the game."
The Cardinal wasted little time at the front end
of the game, scoring just 6 minutes and 30 seconds
into the first half.
Sophomore midfielder Gina Farias-Eisner car
ried the ball to the far corner of the field before fir
ing a cross pass toward the goal box. Freshman
Lizzy George connected off the pass, heading it
into the corner of the net for her fourth goal of the
season.
Getting out in front was an important task for
the Cardinal, who arc now 8-0 when scoring the
game's first goal. It was especially important in
Sunday's matchup, considering St. Mary's has not
had a come-from-behind win all season.
Following the opening goal, St. Mary's put on a
strong attack, keeping the ball out of its own zone

and limiting Stanford's scoring attacks.
Tapscott changed that in the middle of the half
with a strong breakaway through two Gael defend
ers. Although the ball was kicked out of bounds
and no goal was scored, it helped Stanford put the
Gaels back on the defensive.
Unfortunately it was not enough to completely
hold off the Gaels, who tied up the game with a
goal from standout Genevieve Mollis toward the
end of the first half.
Mollis got possession of the ball following a
Gael corner kick that was deflected by a Stanford
defender. From outside the goal box, Hollis fired a
shot toward the far end of the net that just got by an
outstretched Nicole Barnhart.
It is the first goal that Barnhart has given up
since she let one get by her against Notre Dame on
Sept. 3. Barnhart has still posted an incredible 0.37
goals-against-average so far this season.
The Cardinal showed new intensity in the sec
ond half, doing a better job at pushing the ball into
the Gaels' zone and creating scoring opportunities.
They doubled their shot total from the first half,
posting six in the second.
"I think our strength was our possession play,"

Sunday. Stanford defeated the Gaels 2-1 to improve to 8-2-1.
Ratcliffe said. "I think we played pretty good soccer,
knocking the ball around from side to side."
Even so, the Cardinal struggled to get any of their
shots past Lee, who posted six saves on the afternoon.
"Its frustrating, especially when you're playing in
the backline," said junior defender Jenny Farenbaugh
of the team's inability to score. "We just got unlucky
bounces until the second goal went in."
Stanford finally broke through when Tapscott con
nected with the game-winner that brought the crowd of
1,335 to its feet.

While Shim and Tapscott were undoubtedly the
heroes, it was the Cardinal defense that kept Stanford
in the game when the offense struggled to score. They
allowed just two shots in the half and three shots in the
entire game.
With the win over St. Mary's, the Cardinal are now
set to begin Pacific 10 play, which will begin on Sunday
against Berkeley.
They finish non-conference play with just two loss

Gael corner kick that was deflected by a Stanford
defender. From outside the goal box, Hollis fired a
shot toward the far end of the net that just got by an
outstretched Nicole Barnhart.
It is the first goal that Barnhart has given up
since she let one get by her against Notre Dame on
Sept. 3. Barnhart has still posted an incredible 0.37
goals-against-average so far this season.
The Cardinal showed new intensity in the sec
ond half, doing a better job at pushing the ball into
the Gaels' zone and creating scoring opportunities.
They doubled their shot total from the first half,
posting six in the second.
"I think our strength was our possession play,"

Sunday. Stanford defeated the Gaels 2-1 to improve to 8-2-1.
Ratcliffe said. "I think we played pretty good soccer,
knocking the ball around from side to side."
Even so, the Cardinal struggled to get any of their
shots past Lee, who posted six saves on the afternoon.
"Its frustrating, especially when you're playing in
the backline," said junior defender Jenny Farenbaugh
of the team's inability to score. "We just got unlucky
bounces until the second goal went in."
Stanford finally broke through when Tapscott con
nected with the game-winner that brought the crowd of
1,335 to its feet.

Cardinal defense
shuts down Gaels

While Shim and Tapscott were undoubtedly the
heroes, it was the Cardinal defense that kept Stanford
in the game when the offense struggled to score. They
allowed just two shots in the half and three shots in the
entire game.
With the win over St. Mary's, the Cardinal are now
set to begin Pacific 10 play, which will begin on Sunday
against Berkeley.
They finish non-conference play with just two loss
es, a huge improvement over their 5-5-1 non-confer
ence finish last year.
Following Thursday night's grueling double
overtime tie with Santa C lara, the Stanford
women's soccer team was hoping fora less intense
matchup against Bay Area rival St. Mary's on Sun
day. The game was anything but relaxed, however,
as the Cardinal (8-2-1) and Gaels (8-4-0) were
deadlocked through the game's final minutes.
The No. 16 Cardinal eventually broke through
the 1-1 tie with just six minutes, 47 seconds re
maining in regulation.
Junior midfielder Leah Tapscott, who had
been trying to find the net all afternoon, got the
game-winner with a kick into the left corner of the
goal.
The Cardinal have now won seven of their last
eight games and have not lost since Sept. 3.
The Gaels, on the other hand, suffered their
third loss in four games.
The thrilling finish began when senior defender
Emilee Shim made a leading pass through several
Gael defenders. As the ball rolled towards the St.
Mary's net, both Tapscott and St. Mary s goal
keeper Andrea Lee raced alter it.
It was Tapscott who arrived at the ball first, just

ahead of a sliding Lee. She fired a desperation shot
that went up and over the Gael goalkeeper and into
the empty net.
Tapscott, on the ground after colliding with Lee,
was soon engulfed by her Stanford teammates.
"Emilee put a beautiful through ball into the
space for Leah and Leah had great running off the
ball and connected," said head coach Paul Rat
cliffe. who defeated St. Mary's for the second time
since leaving the school two years ago. "It was a
great goal late in the game."
The Cardinal wasted little time at the front end
of the game, scoring just 6 minutes and 30 seconds
into the first half.
Sophomore midfielder Gina Farias-Eisner car
ried the ball to the far corner of the field before fir
ing a cross pass toward the goal box. Freshman
Lizzy George connected off the pass, heading it
into the corner of the net for her fourth goal of the
season.
Getting out in front was an important task for
the Cardinal, who arc now 8-0 when scoring the
game's first goal. It was especially important in
Sunday's matchup, considering St. Mary's has not
had a come-from-behind win all season.
Following the opening goal, St. Mary's put on a
strong attack, keeping the ball out of its own zone

and limiting Stanford's scoring attacks.
Tapscott changed that in the middle of the half
with a strong breakaway through two Gael defend
ers. Although the ball was kicked out of bounds
and no goal was scored, it helped Stanford put the
Gaels back on the defensive.
Unfortunately it was not enough to completely
hold off the Gaels, who tied up the game with a
goal from standout Genevieve Mollis toward the
end of the first half.
Mollis got possession of the ball following a
Gael corner kick that was deflected by a Stanford
defender. From outside the goal box, Hollis fired a
shot toward the far end of the net that just got by an
outstretched Nicole Barnhart.
It is the first goal that Barnhart has given up
since she let one get by her against Notre Dame on
Sept. 3. Barnhart has still posted an incredible 0.37
goals-against-average so far this season.
