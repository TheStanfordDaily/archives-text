## Remembering baseball in Montreal 
### 
Truth be told. I've never actually met a
Montreal Expos fan. And with MLB s
recent approval, the Expos have depart
ed Montreal for D.C.
In fact, I can only claim two Expos experi
ences. First, my buddy Mahesh: Although he
never actually attended an Expos game, he

once saw the home of the
Expos, Le Stade
Olympique, and described
the stadium as looking like a
UFO. Second, I own one of
those nifty Tri Color hats.
That's it. However, the de
molition of the Expos over
the last 10 years is a story
that needs telling, as it's one
of utter injustice.

Let's rewind to 1994, a year that will hence
forth be known as: The End of Canadian
Sports Dominance. Looking at '92 and '93. it is
fairly obvious why Canada could boast being
the dominant sports nation â€” the Toronto
Blue Jays had won two consecutive World Se
ries. Also, in '93, in possibly the only Stanley
Cup that has ever been somewhat memorable
to me, the Montreal Canadiens overcame a
Los Angeles team led by Wayne Gretzky.
The only moment that still resonates in my
mind from this Cup was in Game 2. when
Canadiens coach Jacques Demers challenged
the curvature of the stick used by Los Angeles
enforcer Marty McSorley. End result: The
stick was overly curved, and the subsequent
goal on the power play changed not only the
tide of the game, but also the momentum of
the series. But I digress.
'94 was also the year of the baseball strike,
a strike that cost the Expos a possible place in
the annals of baseball history. 94 was the year
Matt Williams was going to break Maris'
record, Tony Gwynn was going to bat .400 and
the Expos were going to win the World Series.
For anyone who tells you that the Braves have
won the Division title for 14 straight years,
they are incorrect. Montreal had compiled the
best record in baseball, and was heading to
wards the division title. Enter baseball strike.
Exit Canadian sports dominance.
Since that time. Canada has been forced to
