## Remembering baseball in Montreal 
### 
Truth be told. I've never actually met a
Montreal Expos fan. And with MLB s
recent approval, the Expos have depart
ed Montreal for D.C.
In fact, I can only claim two Expos experi
ences. First, my buddy Mahesh: Although he
never actually attended an Expos game, he

once saw the home of the
Expos, Le Stade
Olympique, and described
the stadium as looking like a
UFO. Second, I own one of
those nifty Tri Color hats.
That's it. However, the de
molition of the Expos over
the last 10 years is a story
that needs telling, as it's one
of utter injustice.

Let's rewind to 1994, a year that will hence
forth be known as: The End of Canadian
Sports Dominance. Looking at '92 and '93. it is
fairly obvious why Canada could boast being
the dominant sports nation — the Toronto
Blue Jays had won two consecutive World Se
ries. Also, in '93, in possibly the only Stanley
Cup that has ever been somewhat memorable
to me, the Montreal Canadiens overcame a
Los Angeles team led by Wayne Gretzky.
The only moment that still resonates in my
mind from this Cup was in Game 2. when
Canadiens coach Jacques Demers challenged
the curvature of the stick used by Los Angeles
enforcer Marty McSorley. End result: The
stick was overly curved, and the subsequent
goal on the power play changed not only the
tide of the game, but also the momentum of
the series. But I digress.
'94 was also the year of the baseball strike,
a strike that cost the Expos a possible place in
the annals of baseball history. 94 was the year
Matt Williams was going to break Maris'
record, Tony Gwynn was going to bat .400 and
the Expos were going to win the World Series.
For anyone who tells you that the Braves have
won the Division title for 14 straight years,
they are incorrect. Montreal had compiled the
best record in baseball, and was heading to
wards the division title. Enter baseball strike.
Exit Canadian sports dominance.
Since that time. Canada has been forced to

Miss Morrissette in '95. Vinsanity. The Vancouver Griz
zlies. And to top it off, further hemorrhaging of Canadi
an hockey with the departure of the Quebec Nordiques
and the Winnipeg Jets.
To all the readers out there who are pondering why a
kid who has never been to Canada, let alone attended an
Expos game, cares so deeply about the 'Spos, let me ex
plain. In August of 92, my beloved San Francisco Giants
were sold to a group of investors in Tampa Bay, Florida,
and were set to begin play in the Florida Seacoast Dome
the next season.
While this sale was later rejected by MLB owners, this
Black Friday taught my impressionable 4th grade mind
about the impermanence of sports franchises. Thus, I
feel for the collective Expos Nation (if one still exists).
Montreal was once a vibrant baseball town, chock full
of homegrown talent. All hyperbole aside, the demoli
tion of the Expos is possibly the most underreported
sports story of the 20th century. This is a franchise that
cultivated Larry Walker, Randy Johnson, The Hawk,
Pedro, Moises Alou, and Vlad. not to mention their love
able mascot Youppi. But thanks to cheap owners and
downright criminal behavior (as evidenced by diabolical
owner Jeffrey Loria), the Expos stood little chance
against franchises actually willing to spend money.
A quick look down memory lane shows Loria riding

into Montreal on a white horse, billing himself as the sav
ior of baseball in Canada. However, during his owner
ship he both refused to pay market rates for players and
squandered the English Language radio and TV rights
(in 2000 Montreal had NO English language broadcast).
Yes, I know it's Quebec, and people speak French, but a
quick look at demographics shows that 40 percent of
Montreal speaks English.
Finally, on his way out of Montreal, after buying the
Florida Marlins with an interest-free loan from his
buddy Commissioner Bud "My real name is Allen but
nobody calls me that" Selig, he bribed the entire Expos
front office to leave with him fora $5,000 bonus, taking
all of the team's computers and scouting reports.
No sports fans should have had to endure this. Let
alone sports fans in a nation that has not won a major
championship (and no, curling does not count) in over a
decade. I'll leave you with the prescient words of Alanis.
who asked, "Isn't it ironic? Dontcha think?"
And to answer her rhetorical, not-meant-to-be-an
swered question — yes, yes it is ironic. It is ironic that
a country that lives, dies and breathes hockey has not
won a Stanley Cup in a decade. Ponder that. Miss
Morrissette.

Miss Morrissette in '95. Vinsanity. The Vancouver Griz

To all the readers out there who are pondering why a
kid who has never been to Canada, let alone attended an
Expos game, cares so deeply about the 'Spos, let me ex
plain. In August of 92, my beloved San Francisco Giants
were sold to a group of investors in Tampa Bay, Florida,
and were set to begin play in the Florida Seacoast Dome
the next season.
While this sale was later rejected by MLB owners, this
Black Friday taught my impressionable 4th grade mind
about the impermanence of sports franchises. Thus, I
feel for the collective Expos Nation (if one still exists).
Montreal was once a vibrant baseball town, chock full
of homegrown talent. All hyperbole aside, the demoli
tion of the Expos is possibly the most underreported
sports story of the 20th century. This is a franchise that
cultivated Larry Walker, Randy Johnson, The Hawk,
Pedro, Moises Alou, and Vlad. not to mention their love
able mascot Youppi. But thanks to cheap owners and
downright criminal behavior (as evidenced by diabolical
owner Jeffrey Loria), the Expos stood little chance
against franchises actually willing to spend money.
A quick look down memory lane shows Loria riding

into Montreal on a white horse, billing himself as the sav
ior of baseball in Canada. However, during his owner
ship he both refused to pay market rates for players and
squandered the English Language radio and TV rights
(in 2000 Montreal had NO English language broadcast).
Yes, I know it's Quebec, and people speak French, but a
quick look at demographics shows that 40 percent of
Montreal speaks English.
Finally, on his way out of Montreal, after buying the
Florida Marlins with an interest-free loan from his
buddy Commissioner Bud "My real name is Allen but
nobody calls me that" Selig, he bribed the entire Expos
front office to leave with him fora $5,000 bonus, taking
all of the team's computers and scouting reports.
No sports fans should have had to endure this. Let
alone sports fans in a nation that has not won a major
championship (and no, curling does not count) in over a
decade. I'll leave you with the prescient words of Alanis.
who asked, "Isn't it ironic? Dontcha think?"
And to answer her rhetorical, not-meant-to-be-an

a country that lives, dies and breathes hockey has not
won a Stanley Cup in a decade. Ponder that. Miss
Morrissette.

Truth be told. I've never actually met a
Montreal Expos fan. And with MLB s
recent approval, the Expos have depart
ed Montreal for D.C.
In fact, I can only claim two Expos experi
ences. First, my buddy Mahesh: Although he
never actually attended an Expos game, he

once saw the home of the
Expos, Le Stade
Olympique, and described
the stadium as looking like a
UFO. Second, I own one of
those nifty Tri Color hats.
That's it. However, the de
molition of the Expos over
the last 10 years is a story
that needs telling, as it's one
of utter injustice.

Let's rewind to 1994, a year that will hence
forth be known as: The End of Canadian
Sports Dominance. Looking at '92 and '93. it is
fairly obvious why Canada could boast being
the dominant sports nation — the Toronto
Blue Jays had won two consecutive World Se
ries. Also, in '93, in possibly the only Stanley
Cup that has ever been somewhat memorable
to me, the Montreal Canadiens overcame a
Los Angeles team led by Wayne Gretzky.
The only moment that still resonates in my
mind from this Cup was in Game 2. when
Canadiens coach Jacques Demers challenged
the curvature of the stick used by Los Angeles
enforcer Marty McSorley. End result: The
stick was overly curved, and the subsequent
goal on the power play changed not only the
tide of the game, but also the momentum of
the series. But I digress.
'94 was also the year of the baseball strike,
a strike that cost the Expos a possible place in
the annals of baseball history. 94 was the year
Matt Williams was going to break Maris'
record, Tony Gwynn was going to bat .400 and
the Expos were going to win the World Series.
For anyone who tells you that the Braves have
won the Division title for 14 straight years,
they are incorrect. Montreal had compiled the
best record in baseball, and was heading to
wards the division title. Enter baseball strike.
Exit Canadian sports dominance.
