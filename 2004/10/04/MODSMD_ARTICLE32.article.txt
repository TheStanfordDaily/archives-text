# Stanford overcomes mistakes
## 
### WILL OREMUS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Third quarter, the score is 14-7 Stanford, and the small
home crowd is antsy for the Cardinal to pull away from a
pitiful Washington team. It's time to put up some points.
Sophomore quarterback Trent Edwards drops hack,
feels pressure, slings a long line-drive pass that spirals per
fectly into the hands of a streaking Mark Bradford on the
sideline. Forty-four yards, down to the 12 yard line. Just
what the Cardinal needed.
Next play: interception in the end zone.
it's frustrating to make a throw like that to Mark and
then to have the interception." Edwards said. "Plays like
that were typical of our offense today."
Though Stanford rolled up 456 yards of offense and
won the game 27-13, everyone in the locker room after the
game knew they wouldn't be able to get away with so
many mistakes against better competition.
"We turned the ball over a bunch, which we really have
not done" in the season's first three names, said head

coach Buddy Teevens. "It was frustrating being out there
watching it."
On the errant pass intended for sophomore wide re
ceiver Evan Moore — one of three interceptions thrown
by Stanford in the game — Edwards took the blame for
trying to force something that wasn't there.
"I put it a little behind Evan, and he went a little bit in
side," he said.
Small mistakes, to be sure. Fixable. But potentially ru
inous in a tight game.
Junior running back J R. Lemon devoured yardage all
day and scored three touchdowns, but he too committed
an expensive mistalA: On third and goal from the one
yard line with eight minutes left in the game, he fumbled
the ball away.
"I tried to jump over the line," Lemon recalled. "I didn't
realize the linebacker was right there. We kind of collided
in mid-air and I think he got [the ball| with his helmet."
Lemon's error: "I shouldn't have stretched my arms
out with the ball. I should have kept it tucked in tight."
"Lesson learned," he added.
The Cardinal's blunders weren't all on offense. Like
Edwards and Lemon, redshirt freshman cornerback Nick
Sanchez made some huge plays and then followed them
up with screw-ups.
On a designed punt-block play, Sanchez helped open a
hole for Brandon Harrison and then recovered Harrison's
block and ran it into the end zone. On the Huskies' next
possession, Sanchez nearly intercepted a pass. But later in
the fourth quarter he got called for pass interference, and
near the game's end he got thoroughly beaten in coverage
and allowed Sonny Shackleford to make a 28-yard touch
down catch.
"I had a lot of ups and downs today," Sanchez said rue
fully. He couldn't keep the smile off his face for long. "But
it sure was exciting to be out there," he added.
The Cardinal as a team felt about the same way. No
one was pleased with all the team's execution overall, and
everyone felt bad about their miscues. But just as the team
was disappointed with its loss the previous week to No. 1
USC despite a masterful performance, this week the play
ers found it hard to conceal their excitement at being 3-1
despite playing below their own standards.
For the Cardinal, as for Sanchez, this is new territory.
A win on the road over Notre Dame next weekend could
land them into the national Top 25. Three more wins this
season and they will likely be headed to a bowl game.
But the road ahead is long, and the margin for error
narrow.
So if Lemon was right — if lessons were learned in this
sloppy victory — then count Stanford lucky to have got
ten the kinks out while still posting a win.
