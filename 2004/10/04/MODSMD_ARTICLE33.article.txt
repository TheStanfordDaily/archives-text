# Field hockey loses pair of heartbreakers in Missouri
## Stanford must execute in conference tournament 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY 
Perhaps the Stanford women's field hockey team's
recent conference play is best described by musical mae
stro Brandy: "Almost doesn't count."
The Cardinal (5-8, 0-4 Northern Pacific Athletic
Conference) traveled to Missouri this weekend to face
the Southwest Missouri State Bears (7-3,3-1 NorPac) in
back to back match-ups. The Cardinal dropped both
games in heartbreaking fashion, losing the first game in
overtime and the second in the final minute of the game.
But the Stanford women know something Brandy
doesn't: Sometimes, "almost" can count for something.
"It's advantageous that we'll go into the conference
tournament as an underdog so we can surprise some of
these teams." said freshman forward Jessica Zutz.
Stanford came to Southwest Missouri State having
lost its first two conference games. In Friday's matchup
at Plaster Field, the Cardinal jumped out to a lead in the
22nd minute when Julia Drewes converted on Stan
ford's first penalty stroke of the season. The Cardinal
was awarded the penalty stroke when Southwest Mis
souri State midfielder Gabby Gomez stopped a Stan
ford shot with her foot.
But, as has been the trend in recent games, Stanford
couldn't add to its lead and eventually allowed SMS to
tie the game.
In the 34th minute, just before halftime, SMS sopho
more forward Adrien Trumpy scored unassisted to knot
up the game at one.
SMS outshot the Cardinal 19-14 in the game, and
held a 12-8 advantage in penalty corners. Zutz had a
game-high four shots for the Cardinal.
"A lot of the shots that other teams are getting on us
are penalty corners, a great way to score." said Zutz.
"Most of our shots aren't. It's great that we're taking a
lot of shots, but I think we need to have a little more shot
selection."
The teams held even for most of the second half, until
the recent Stanford field hockey curse of close games
struck again. With only minutes to play in regulation,
SMS's Gomez gave the Cardinal another penalty stroke

hy stopping the ball on the goal line with her hand, pre
venting an otherwise definite goal. Drewes was unable
to convert on her second penalty corner of the day, as
her stroke hit the right goalpost and bounced off.
"We were cheated out of the game when the ball was
stopped on the goal line," said head coach Lesley Irvine.
The Bears scored early in the overtime period to win
the game, as Cami White deflected a shot from Gomez
into the goal off of a penalty corner in the 74th minute.
"We put a lot of effort and our hearts into the game;
I just don't think we clicked 1(X) percent," said Zutz.
"We need to execute more sharply."
In the second game on Saturday, the Cardinal again
failed to pull out a victory in a close game, as SMS scored
in the final minute of regulation to win.
Gomez, the leading scorer for SMS, scored the
game-winner to give the Bears a two-game sweep of
the Cardinal.
The defeat extended Stanford's losing streak to a
season-high four games. Six of the Cardinal's eight loss
es have been by a single goal.
Following what has become an almost formulaic pat
tern, Stanford jumped out to an early 1 -0 lead as sopho
more Jamie Mais picked up her first career points, scor
ing on an assist from Katherine Brooks. Gomez and
Trumpy, the prominent SMS scoring duo, each added a
goal to give SMS a lead early in the second half. The
Cardinal came back to tie the game on a Missy Halliday
goal in the 64th minute.
It looked like Stanford was headed for another over
time showdown until Gomez took matters into her
hands and scored on an unassisted goal with less than a
minute to play.
"The team played two really hard games." said
Irvine. "The two losses were hard to swallow, especially
when we dominated play but just didn't get the result."
With the other teams in the NorPac conference
pulling away from the Cardinal, the Stanford women
are beginning to focus on tuning up for the confcrence
tournament.
The Cardinal will conclude the three-game road trip
with a non-conference matchup against St. Louis (3-4).
A win would certainly help wash the bitter taste of three
straight close losses out of the Cardinal mouths.
"We're going to get really pumped up coming off two
hard losses." said Zutz. "We really want to go out there
and take it to [St. Louis]."

was awarded the penalty stroke when Southwest Mis
souri State midfielder Gabby Gomez stopped a Stan
ford shot with her foot.
But, as has been the trend in recent games, Stanford
couldn't add to its lead and eventually allowed SMS to
tie the game.
In the 34th minute, just before halftime, SMS sopho
more forward Adrien Trumpy scored unassisted to knot
up the game at one.
SMS outshot the Cardinal 19-14 in the game, and
held a 12-8 advantage in penalty corners. Zutz had a
game-high four shots for the Cardinal.
"A lot of the shots that other teams are getting on us
are penalty corners, a great way to score." said Zutz.
"Most of our shots aren't. It's great that we're taking a
lot of shots, but I think we need to have a little more shot
selection."
The teams held even for most of the second half, until
the recent Stanford field hockey curse of close games
struck again. With only minutes to play in regulation,
SMS's Gomez gave the Cardinal another penalty stroke

hy stopping the ball on the goal line with her hand, pre
venting an otherwise definite goal. Drewes was unable
to convert on her second penalty corner of the day, as
her stroke hit the right goalpost and bounced off.
"We were cheated out of the game when the ball was
stopped on the goal line," said head coach Lesley Irvine.
The Bears scored early in the overtime period to win
the game, as Cami White deflected a shot from Gomez
into the goal off of a penalty corner in the 74th minute.
"We put a lot of effort and our hearts into the game;
I just don't think we clicked 1(X) percent," said Zutz.
"We need to execute more sharply."
In the second game on Saturday, the Cardinal again
failed to pull out a victory in a close game, as SMS scored
in the final minute of regulation to win.
Gomez, the leading scorer for SMS, scored the
game-winner to give the Bears a two-game sweep of
the Cardinal.
The defeat extended Stanford's losing streak to a
season-high four games. Six of the Cardinal's eight loss
es have been by a single goal.
Following what has become an almost formulaic pat
tern, Stanford jumped out to an early 1 -0 lead as sopho
more Jamie Mais picked up her first career points, scor
ing on an assist from Katherine Brooks. Gomez and
Trumpy, the prominent SMS scoring duo, each added a
goal to give SMS a lead early in the second half. The
Cardinal came back to tie the game on a Missy Halliday
goal in the 64th minute.
It looked like Stanford was headed for another over
time showdown until Gomez took matters into her
hands and scored on an unassisted goal with less than a
minute to play.
"The team played two really hard games." said
Irvine. "The two losses were hard to swallow, especially
when we dominated play but just didn't get the result."
With the other teams in the NorPac conference
pulling away from the Cardinal, the Stanford women
are beginning to focus on tuning up for the confcrence
tournament.
The Cardinal will conclude the three-game road trip
with a non-conference matchup against St. Louis (3-4).
A win would certainly help wash the bitter taste of three
straight close losses out of the Cardinal mouths.
"We're going to get really pumped up coming off two
hard losses." said Zutz. "We really want to go out there
and take it to [St. Louis]."
