# Dollies, Competitive Cheer vie for fans' attention
## 
### DAVID HERBERT DESK EDITOR 
Members of Cardinal Competi
tive Cheer spent one quarter of Sat
urday's football game on the side
lines near the student section. The
situation was not exactly cause for
celebration among many members
of the Band, but the cheerleading
squad denies a rivalry.
During the third quarter of Satur

day's game against the University of
Washington. Cardinal Competitive
Cheer moved from its usual spot on
the alumni side of the field at Stan
ford Stadium to the side in front of
the student section. The cheerlead
ing squad's repositioning did not sit
well with some in the Band, which
traditionally occupies the area.
"We were definitely surprised to
see them there." said sophomore
Nicole Darcv. a Dollie. "The Band is

the central entertainment for sport
ing events, and it is its right to be the
center of attention. Since the Dollies
are part of the Band, that follows for
us. It's not only a tradition but also a
well-deserved honor."
According to Band Manager Stel
la Cousins, Class of 2(X)4, an agree
ment brokered by the Athletic De
partment last spring stipulated that
Cardinal Competitive Cheer could
come to the "sunny side" of the stadi

um for one quarter per game, but
added that the exact position and
timing still needed clarification.
"We'll probably continue talking
about it," she said.
Senior Chelsea Dudek, who co
founded Cardinal Competitive
Cheer in 2(X)2 and now serves as a
co-captain, said that her squad's in
tent was not to overshadow the
Competitive Cheer
seeks to avoid rivalry

Band.
"We understand that the Band is a tradition, and we
appreciate what the band is doing," she said. "I would
hope that people don't think we detract from the Dol
lies."
There is room for both the Dollies and Cardinal Com
petitive Cheer, Dudek added, because her
group's mission is unique.
"We are there to get the crowd to yell," she said. "The
Dollies are there to entertain."
Some students in the crowd also objected to the
cheerleading squad's move, arguing that the Band's tra
ditional role should not be overshadowed.
"I was disheartened to find them replacing the Dol
lies, because in my opinion the Dollies really embody the
spirit of Stanford football whereas Cardinal Competitive
Cheer does not," said sophomore Jarret Guajardo.
Other students, like sophomore Cynthia Querio,
cited an already packed sideline as another reason to
keep Cardinal Competitive Cheer near the alumni sec
tion.

"There are too many people — with the Yell Leaders,
the Dollies, the Band and the Tree," she said. "It gets too
crowded."
Darcy argued that beyond their roles as morale boost
ers, other factors are working against co-existence.
"There's a general competition between cheerleaders
and dancers, and it is aggravated by having to compete
with each other," she said.
Another Dollie, sophomore Jessica Whitten, agreed,
saying that the two groups needed to establish clear
boundaries.
"If we are going to be standing so close to each other,
we need an understanding as to what we are each doing,"
she said.
Looking ahead to the basketball season. Cousins ar
gued that while the Band might be able to share the stage
with Cardinal Competitive Cheer at football games,
events at Maples Pavilion might be another matter.
"At smaller athletic events like basketball games, it
doesn't make sense to crowd all of that entertainment
into such a small place," she said.
