# Stanford Democrats call, travel to reach voters in swing state
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY DESK EDITOR 
For those who are working on
one of the many grassroots get-out
the-vote efforts for this year's presi
dential election, even unused cell
phone minutes can be used to pull in
a few more independent and unde
cided voters.
Yesterday at the Geology build
ing, the Stanford Democrats hosted
their first of several "phone-bank"
parties, at which students used their
free weekend calling plans to dial up
swing state voters and pitch the
Kerry / Edwards platform.
In addition, a separate and more
loosely organized group called "Stu
dents for Kerry" — which, unlike
the Stanford Democrats, is not tied
to the local or national Democratic
parties and does not receive ASSU
funding — is planning to send stu
dents by the van-load to Nevada
each weekend between now and
Election Day.
The biggest trip is being orga
nized for the weekend of Oct. 29, the
last weekend before Election Day,
when students will go to Las Vegas
to help Democrats' efforts there.
Kara Bischoff, who graduated
last year and is now working as a
Human Biology teaching assistant,
was one of the two main organizers

for yesterday's event. She has never
regularly attended meetings of the
Stanford Democrats, but she said
she became interested in politics
over the summer.
"Why do I care all of a sudden?
The stakes are higher in this election
than in any I've noticed before.
Also, this could be an extremely
close race, and our efforts could
make the difference."
In an attempt to woo passers-by,
the organizers set up a table with
Capri Sun. Doritos and other
snacks. But inside, the tables were
covered with calling lists, scripts, and
stickers.
Before they set to work. Bischoff
gave her volunteers some pointers
about how to go about calling voters
from Ohio, the targeted swing state
of the day. For example, she remind
ed them that many undecided voters
are socially conservative, and there
fore they should focus on issues like
the economy and not, for example,
on gay marriage. She also advised
them to be "nice." "gentle" and not
to get discouraged if a voter does not
change his or her mind.
Senior Mattie Hutton came to
the event to help out and also to
spread the word about upcoming
Nevada canvassing trips.

Emily Warren and Bernard Fraga were among the students who
used their free weekend minutes to call voters in Ohio to make a pitch
for the Kerry / Edwards campaign.
Students to
travel to Vegas

"The areas where we'll he going,
principally Las Vegas, have had
amazing success at getting new De
mocrats registered this year."
According to one trip organizer,
senior Bonnie Johnson, a small
group of Stanford students already
traveled to Reno this past weekend
to identify supporters, recruit volun
teers and provide candidate infor
mation to undecided voters. Both
the weekend trips to Nevada and the
Sunday phone-hank gatherings will
continue every week up until Elec
tion Day.
"Students for Kerry" is working
with a larger grassroots group called
"America Coming Together,"
which is unaffiliated with the nation
al Democratic party, to arrange
some of the logistics of the trip and
to provide funding. Nevada, unlike
California, is one of the most hotly
contested swing states, and
"Newsweek" listed it as a "tossup
state"in its latest issue.
"Students for Kerry" hopes to at

tract as many as 20() Stanford stu
dents to go Las Vegas, according to
Hutton. She pitched the experience
as an "absolutely, disgustingly
amazing time" to the volunteers, but
she said it was also hard work.
The trip, she said, would be an
"insane number of people working
insane times," with hours routinely
running between 5:30 a.m. and 11:00
p.m., and that volunteers' diets
would consist almost entirely of
pizza and their sleeping arrange
ments often confined to the floor of
a YMCA gym.
However, Hutton said students
will have some nights off, and she is
hoping that the opportunity to
spend Halloween in Las Vegas will
be a major draw.
Hutton, like Bischoff, hopes that
the get-out-the-vote efforts will ap
peal broadly to Stanford students.
She described "Students for Kerry
as "a venue for students influencing
the election, not some kind of fran
chise for the Democratic party."
