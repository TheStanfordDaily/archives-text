# Stanford Democrats call, travel to reach voters in swing state
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY DESK EDITOR 
For those who are working on
one of the many grassroots get-out
the-vote efforts for this year's presi
dential election, even unused cell
phone minutes can be used to pull in
a few more independent and unde
cided voters.
Yesterday at the Geology build
ing, the Stanford Democrats hosted
their first of several "phone-bank"
parties, at which students used their
free weekend calling plans to dial up
swing state voters and pitch the
Kerry / Edwards platform.
In addition, a separate and more
loosely organized group called "Stu
dents for Kerry" — which, unlike
the Stanford Democrats, is not tied
to the local or national Democratic
parties and does not receive ASSU
funding — is planning to send stu
dents by the van-load to Nevada
each weekend between now and
Election Day.
The biggest trip is being orga
nized for the weekend of Oct. 29, the
last weekend before Election Day,
when students will go to Las Vegas
to help Democrats' efforts there.
Kara Bischoff, who graduated
last year and is now working as a
Human Biology teaching assistant,
was one of the two main organizers

for yesterday's event. She has never
regularly attended meetings of the
Stanford Democrats, but she said
she became interested in politics
over the summer.
"Why do I care all of a sudden?
The stakes are higher in this election
than in any I've noticed before.
Also, this could be an extremely
close race, and our efforts could
make the difference."
In an attempt to woo passers-by,
the organizers set up a table with
Capri Sun. Doritos and other
snacks. But inside, the tables were
covered with calling lists, scripts, and
stickers.
Before they set to work. Bischoff
gave her volunteers some pointers
about how to go about calling voters
from Ohio, the targeted swing state
of the day. For example, she remind
ed them that many undecided voters
are socially conservative, and there
fore they should focus on issues like
the economy and not, for example,
on gay marriage. She also advised
them to be "nice." "gentle" and not
to get discouraged if a voter does not
change his or her mind.
Senior Mattie Hutton came to
the event to help out and also to
spread the word about upcoming
Nevada canvassing trips.
