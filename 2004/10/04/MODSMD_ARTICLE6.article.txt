# In carpool lanes, making room for hybrid vehicles
## 
### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTION WRITER 
Hybrid cars, which can get up to
61 miles per gallon in city driving,
are gaining popularity among the
enviromentally-conscious drivers
and those concerned about rising
gas prices. A new bill in California
may increase the draw of rush hour
commuters to the more energy effi
cient vehicle.
Despite owning a Hummer,
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
signed a bill in late September he
hopes will encourage the purchase
of hybrid cars, cut greenhouse gas
emissions and boost the Califor
nia's energy independence. As
sembly Bill 2628 will allow certain
hybrid cars, regardless of the num
ber of passengers inside, to use
freeway carpool lanes. Although
the bill still awaits federal ap
proval. it is already praised as a
step toward greater environmental

consciousness. However, many still
stress that further actions are need
ed to cut air pollution and protect
the environment.
The hill, introduced by Assem
blywoman Fran Pavley. D-Agoura
Hills, allows hybrids that get more
than 45 miles per gallon and meet
tough emissions restrictions to use
high-occupancy vehicle lanes. That
means the 2004 Toyota Prius,
Honda Civic Hybrid and Honda
Insight will qualify for single-occu
pant HOV lane status.
The bill needs federal approval
for it to go into effect because fed
eral funds are used in the construc
tion of HOV lanes.
Lecturer Carolyn Ross from
the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric drives a hybrid car and is
optimistic that the bill will receive
federal approval.
New bill may not
solve the problem

"I think that the recent oil supply
and price jitters have reminded
many voters and legislators that our
nation is too dependent on
petroleum, a fuel source that is pro
jected to reach its production peak
worldwide by 2005 while demand
for it will continue to rise long after
ward," Kott said.
Ross also remarked that the bill
will provide some of the extra in
centive needed for people to invest
in hybrid cars.
"It helps build critical mass to
ward real, significant environmen
tal change, namely reduced depen
dence on fossil fuels. In this coun
try, the consumer has tremendous
power to drive change," she said.
Junior Dario Amodei, who owns
a Prius, also said that the bill is a
step in the right direction.
"I think it's excellent for the gov
ernment to provide a form of sub
sidy for people driving hybrid cars,"
he said. "It's something we defi
nitely need to encourage."
Many environmental advocates
believe that the bill will not be very
effective in improving air quality,
but that it will set an important
precedent and will draw attention
to the problems of consumption of
non-renewable energy and harmful
air emissions into the atmosphere.
"I believe the bill will have little

effect in meeting its goals of cleaner
air â€” more drastic changes such as
tougher emission standards are nec
essary," said Efe Cakarel, a mem
ber of the Stanford Center for Envi
ronmental Science and Policy. "I
believe that policy makers in Cali
fornia should resist the powerful
auto lobby and adopt more effec
tive measures."
Students also agree that while
the bill is a step away from depen
dency on fossil-fuels, there is a long
way to go before fossil-fuel use can
be eliminated altogether.
"Greater emphasis on existing
technologies such as bio-diesel and
battery electric vehicles would
drive more aggressively toward
eliminating fossil fuel dependence,"
said senior and team leader Erik
Hantsoo from the Stanford Solar
Car Project.
As for the governor, who ran in
last year's recall election as a strong
environmentalist, even some skep
tics are now convinced that he is the
leading Republican in the state in
environmental issues.
"Arnold Schwarzenneger is the
most liberal Republican I know,"
said sophomore Bryan Schell.
"He's trying to represent the people
of California and not his own gas
guzzling SUV needs, and that's
what a politician should do."
