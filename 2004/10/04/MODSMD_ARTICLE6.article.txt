# In carpool lanes, making room for hybrid vehicles
## 
### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTION WRITER 
Hybrid cars, which can get up to
61 miles per gallon in city driving,
are gaining popularity among the
enviromentally-conscious drivers
and those concerned about rising
gas prices. A new bill in California
may increase the draw of rush hour
commuters to the more energy effi
cient vehicle.
Despite owning a Hummer,
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
signed a bill in late September he
hopes will encourage the purchase
of hybrid cars, cut greenhouse gas
emissions and boost the Califor
nia's energy independence. As
sembly Bill 2628 will allow certain
hybrid cars, regardless of the num
ber of passengers inside, to use
freeway carpool lanes. Although
the bill still awaits federal ap
proval. it is already praised as a
step toward greater environmental

consciousness. However, many still
stress that further actions are need
ed to cut air pollution and protect
the environment.
The hill, introduced by Assem
blywoman Fran Pavley. D-Agoura
Hills, allows hybrids that get more
than 45 miles per gallon and meet
tough emissions restrictions to use
high-occupancy vehicle lanes. That
means the 2004 Toyota Prius,
Honda Civic Hybrid and Honda
Insight will qualify for single-occu
pant HOV lane status.
The bill needs federal approval
for it to go into effect because fed
eral funds are used in the construc
tion of HOV lanes.
Lecturer Carolyn Ross from
the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric drives a hybrid car and is
optimistic that the bill will receive
federal approval.
