It isn't always clear to people at first that they're right for the
D. E. Shaw group. Like the poetry M.F.A. we hired to head an
automated block trading unit. Or the woman who designs solar
powered race cars; we hired her to help launch a new venture
in computational chemistry. They didn't think of themselves
as "financial types," and neither did we. We thought of them as
people with extraordinary talent.
The firm currently has openings in quantitative analysis, software
development, information technology, computer architecture, busi
ness development, computational chemistry, accounting, finance,
and trading. We're looking for creative but pragmatic people: articu
late, curious, and driven. Our working environment is intense but
surprisingly casual. We provide unusual opportunities for growth.
And we compensate extraordinary people extraordinarily well.
The D. E. Shaw group is an investment and technology develop
ment firm. Since 1988 we've grown into a number of closely related
entities with approximately US $8 billion in aggregate capital by
hiring smart people from a wide range of backgrounds and let
ting them implement—and manage —what they invent. A robotics
guru. A nationally ranked blackjack player. An operatic mezzo
soprano. And a lot of people who are just exceptionally strong in
CS, EE, math, and finance.
The D. E. Shaw group will be attending the Fall Career Fair
today, October 5 from 11:00 am to 3:00 pm outside at
White Plaza. Please stop by our booth. We will also host
an information session tomorrow, Wednesday, October 6,
at 6:00 pm in the Gates Building, Room 104. On-campus
interviews will take place November 8. To apply for an
interview, log on to http://cardinalrecruiting.stanford.edu/
intent2oo3/. If this isn't possible, please send a resume and
cover letter stating your CPA and standardized test scores,
broken down by section where applicable, to jobs@deshaw.
com. All applications must be received by October 20.
Members of the D. I:. Shaw group do not discriminate in employment matters on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran
status, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other protected class.
