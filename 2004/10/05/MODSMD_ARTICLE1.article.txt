### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
CLEVELAND, OH —Last week
end, Stanford sent five delegates to
participate in simulated political con
ventions and a debate preceding the
national vice presidential debate at
Case Western Reserve University.
Along with this reporter, a senior, the
Stanford group was comprised of se
nior Michael Ortiz and juniors Sihong
Chan, Victor McFarland and Josh
Sandberg.
The conventions took place over
the weekend and were capped by yes
terday's debate, which was moderat
ed by CNN anchor Judy Woodruff.
Segments of the debate will be broad
cast on CNN. MTV and C-SPAN
later this week.
Stanford joined undergraduates
from Case Western and 13 other uni
versities, which included M.1.T.,
Duke, Cornell, Johns Hopkins,
Emory, Carnegie Mellon and Wash
ington University of St. Louis, the
host of the second presidential debate
this Friday.
Each university acted as a state
representing its interests in a national
political convention. The student del

egations, split into Republicans and
Democrats, drew up political plat
forms for their respective parties,
which were divided into four subcom
mittees: domestic policy, social issues,
the economy and national security.
Segments of the platforms were pub
lished in the Cleveland Plain Dealer.
In his welcome address, John L.
Anderson, Case Western's provost
and vice president, said he hoped the
student conventions would "serve as
a civic lesson for all of us," adding
that "more than half of what stu
dents learn comes from outside the
classroom."
Students had mixed opinions
about the convention, which mimic
ked the actual, often frustrating
process of formulating and getting a
party platform.
"This convention made me realize
how futile much of the political
process is," Sandberg said. He added,
"Most people here have views so
strong that no amount of argument
will change them."
Student Democratic party secre
tary Skylar Zwick, a senior at the
University of Miami, said overall,
the platform process was "enriching
for all the students involved" and

"educational, because it let our voic
es be heard by other young voters
who will be the deciding factor in this
election."
At the mock conventions, stu
dents also heard from individuals
with first-hand experience in national
politics who encouraged young peo
ple to get more involved.
Alice Germond, the Democratic
National Committee secretary, spoke
about the significance of this election,
calling it"the most important elec
tion in my lifetime" and"the most im
portant election since 1%8." Urging
students to vote, she said to them,
"You guys are stuck with whatever
mess my generation makes."
The conventions culminated in a
90-minute televised debate on Mon
day evening, which was conducted in
the format of the vice presidential de
bate. Four student representatives
from each party defended their re
spective platforms on the subjects of
domestic policy, social issues, the
economy and national security.
No winner was declared at the de
bate's conclusion, but both sides were
pleased with their performance.
Sarah David, a sophomore from
Johns Hopkins who debated for the

Democrats, believed her party easily
won the debate. "We swept the floor
with the Republicans — 8 days a
week, and twice on Sunday," she said.
Republican debater Ken Nesmith,
a senior at M.I.T. disagreed. "Our
side had a better command of the
facts," he said. "The debate was real
ly a prize for doing so much research
during the convention."
Moderator Judy Woodruff said
she was "blown away" by both sides.
"I was very impressed. Everyone was
loaded with information," she said.
"It was astonishing; they could han
dle whatever I threw at them."
"They were absolutely fantastic,"
Case Western President Edward M.
Hundert said of the debaters. "Today
has been a great day for American ed
ucation," he added.
Case Western spent over $4 mil
lion to upgrade facilities and secure
the campus in preparation for the vice
presidential debate. The event is ex
pected to draw over 1.000 media rep
resentatives from across the country
— a welcome spotlight on Case West
ern. which is the only Ohio school
consistently ranked among the top 50
national universities by U.S. News

"Most people here have views so
strong that no amount of argument
will change them."
Student Democratic party secre
tary Skylar Zwick, a senior at the
University of Miami, said overall,
the platform process was "enriching
for all the students involved" and

"educational, because it let our voic
es be heard by other young voters
who will be the deciding factor in this
election."
At the mock conventions, stu
dents also heard from individuals
with first-hand experience in national
politics who encouraged young peo
ple to get more involved.
Alice Germond, the Democratic
National Committee secretary, spoke
about the significance of this election,
calling it"the most important elec
tion in my lifetime" and"the most im
portant election since 1%8." Urging
students to vote, she said to them,
"You guys are stuck with whatever
mess my generation makes."
The conventions culminated in a
90-minute televised debate on Mon
day evening, which was conducted in
the format of the vice presidential de
bate. Four student representatives
from each party defended their re
spective platforms on the subjects of
domestic policy, social issues, the
economy and national security.
No winner was declared at the de
bate's conclusion, but both sides were
pleased with their performance.
Sarah David, a sophomore from
Johns Hopkins who debated for the

Democrats, believed her party easily
won the debate. "We swept the floor
with the Republicans — 8 days a
week, and twice on Sunday," she said.
Republican debater Ken Nesmith,
a senior at M.I.T. disagreed. "Our
side had a better command of the
facts," he said. "The debate was real
ly a prize for doing so much research
during the convention."
Moderator Judy Woodruff said
she was "blown away" by both sides.
"I was very impressed. Everyone was
loaded with information," she said.
"It was astonishing; they could han
dle whatever I threw at them."
"They were absolutely fantastic,"
Case Western President Edward M.
Hundert said of the debaters. "Today
has been a great day for American ed
ucation," he added.
Case Western spent over $4 mil
lion to upgrade facilities and secure
the campus in preparation for the vice
presidential debate. The event is ex
pected to draw over 1.000 media rep
resentatives from across the country
— a welcome spotlight on Case West
ern. which is the only Ohio school
consistently ranked among the top 50
national universities by U.S. News
and World Report.
