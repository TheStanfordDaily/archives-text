1960 — On Oct. 5, The Stanford Daily ran a story about a rally held by the
Stanford Area Young Republicans and its strong audience participation.
Below is an excerpt.
"A state senator and audience participation highlighted An Old Fash
ioned Political Rally' staged by the Stanford Area Young Republicans last
night at the Stanford Elementary School.
Sen. Richard Dolwig praised the excellent administration California had
been given under the Republicans. This was compared to some of the
things messed up under the Brown administration.'
The spirit of the rally was conveyed through a motion picture in which
Vice President Nixon delivered an address geared to Republican Party
workers throughout the nation. The Republican standard-bearer stated, 'I
will make no speech to a more important group of people. The Republican
Party must attract the votes of independents and change people's votes.'
To invite audience participation, questions were tossed at the onlookers
by YR leaders. Are we going to put Nixon in office?' was greeted by a
hearty cheer. 'Do we want Junior Kennedy in office?' received immediate
no's and hissing."
1983 — On Oct. 5, The Stanford Daily ran a story about opponents chal
lenging East Palo Alto's city hood. Below is an excerpt.
"East Palo Alto is a city - at least for the moment.
Although it has been incorporated since the June 7 election, its enemies
are still hoping to declare the election a fraud, and its skeptics are predict
ing a rocky road fora city with big problems and little money.
The election that incorporated East Palo Alto last June also gave birth
to a lawsuit that, though overruled, is still pending. Several local realtors,
notably Arn Cenadella, and an anti-incorporationist member of the EPA
city council, Gertrude Wilks, charge that the election was invalid because of
voter fraud.
According to former Rep. Paul Pete' McCloskey, who represents the
anti-incorporationists, the circumstances surrounding the collection of ab
sentee ballots were more than a little unusual. Many absentee ballots were
filled out by pro-incorporationists John Goodwill and James Blakey,
though with the consent of the voter; and many of the ballots were hand-de
livered both to and from the home of the voter by Blakey and Goodwill.
