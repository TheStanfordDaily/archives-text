# Victoria's Secret selects Ohio State students for advertising campaign

### DAVID CROSS THE LANTERN (OHIO STATE U 
(U-WIRE) COLUMBUS, OH
— The face of Victoria's Secret sub
brand Pink is a supermodel, but for
Ohio State University, two students
will be using their brains and not
their modeling skills.
During the spring of 2003 Victo
ria's Secret searched the nation's col
leges for young women who would
be their campus's face for the brand.
But these young ladies aren't su
permodels. They're business women,
chosen for their hard work and not
their bodies.
"They weren't just looking fora
pretty face, but for someone who is
known around campus." said Kara
Silverman, a senior in geography and
Jewish studies.
Silverman and Amy Porter, a ju

nior in fashion merchandising, were
chosen out of thousands of applica
tions to become part of Team Pink, a
group of 21 college students who rep
resent the PINK line on their local
campuses.
"For most of the girls it was — I'm
never going to get picked and then
we all got the same phone call from a
fast speaking New Yorker telling us
we got the job," Silverman said.
Both are planning to use this job
as a way to gain real world experi
ence, but the reason each decided to
walk to a room and be interviewed
on camera is completely different.
For Porter it was a chance to be
part of the fashion world and put a
foot in the door in a industry she
plans to work in after college. For Sil
verman — who describes herself as
not girly, not frilly and not pink — the
decision came from heartbreak.
Wanting to be a career politician

and having run for Undergraduate
Student Government vice-president
in 2003 and losing, Silverman had
been depressed and went for the in
terview on a whim.
"When I lost 1 was heartbroken. 1
had been really looking forward to
working for student government, and
when the vision fell apart 1 was left
with nothing. 1 had to start from the
ground up," Silverman said. "I think
it was the most random thing I've
done in college."
Silverman believes it was her
background in student government
that helped land her the job.
"All they are really asking me to
do is support another cause, and the
cause happens to be underwear in
stead of the homeless, child poverty
or hunger," she said. "It felt really
good that Victoria's Secret saw
something in me that I had always
seen."

Working fora major company —
especially one that had never worked
with college student and whose head
quarters are in the same city as they
live in — is difficult, the two said.
"College students don't always on
the whole have a track record of
being dependable or successful." Sil
verman said. "I think we are doing
the best we can."
The clothing, which is being mar
keted towards 18- to 22-year-olds, is
described as lounging around in and
doing your homework in type of
clothing.
Part of their plan for is to hide
1.000 pink stuffed dogs — the lines
mascot — throughout the campus,
which can be taken to Victoria Se
cret's stores and redeemed for mer
chandise and a chance to win a pink
polka dotted Vespa.
"Pink would look good on Bru
tus," Silverman said.
