# Calif, passes laws to curb textbook prices
## 
### DUSTIN VISSERING THE DAILY AZTEC (SAN DIEGO STATE U 
(U-WIRE) SAN DIEGO —
Note to textbook publishers: The
ball is now in your court.
Gov. Schwarzenegger recently
signed one bill and vetoed another,
both designed to help lower the
price of college textbooks.
The bill he signed — known as
the book price reduction bill — will
put in place a list of recommenda
tions for publishers to follow, such
as removing book bundles and dis
closing how new editions have
changed from existing editions.
Steve Blackledge, the legislative
director for the California Public
Interest Research Group which
funded both bills, said the bill is an
important victory for California
college students and is a first step in
reducing textbook costs.
"If textbook publishers begin to
follow these guidelines — not com
ing out with new editions when
there's no new content and not
bundling them with unneeded ma
terials, then students will see imme
diate benefits." he said.

However, some feel the bill will
do little to make an impact on text
book prices.
Laura Nakoneczny, public rela
tions director for the National As
sociation of College Stores, said a
lot of the objectives set forth in the
bill reflect changes already happen
ing in the textbook industry.
"Publishers and college stores
try and provide as many avenues as
possible for students to purchase or
to have access to books," she said.
"Also, book loan programs and on
line book swaps are growing in pop
ularity on many campuses, so it's
hard to say whether the bill will re
ally bring down costs in addition to
those factors."
Psychology senior Cindy Huang
said she thinks companies won't
take the bill seriously if they are not
punished for violating them.
"Textbook companies are al
ways going to find a way to make a
profit, so if following these sugges
tions isn't profitable for them, then
I doubt they will do so just because
the governor hopes they will," she
said.
Nakoneczny said faculty play an
important role in determining how

much students pay for textbooks
because ultimately, faculty mem
bers choose the books for their
classes.
"If professors feel bundles are
more valuable than a black and
white, three-hole punched copy of a
book, then they are going to ask you
to buy the bundle and that's what
will be stocked in the bookstore,"
she said.
At the same time the book price
reduction bill was signed, the gover
nor chose to veto the textbook
rental bill that would have promot
ed textbook rental programs at col
leges.
In a letter to the members of the
state Assembly, Gov. Schwarzeneg
ger said while he is generally sup
portive of textbook rental pro
grams, he felt the cost needed to
fund the programs would ultimately
come back to college students in the
form of higher school fees.
Nakoneczny said many people
are interested in exploring the idea
of college textbook rentals, but it
would cost millions of dollars to
arrange the program.
"Without state funding for this,
you're looking at a huge bill with no

one to pay for it," she said.
Blackledge said the governor made
the wrong decision when he vetoed
the rental bill.
"It could have saved money for
college students each semester, and
that's something politicians should
really embrace," he said.
Blackledge said a number of col
leges have successfully launched a
textbook rental program. Students
who participate in the program are
the ones who provide the funding
for it.
"What the students end up pay
ing is just a small amount compared
to what they'd pay if they bought
the books," he said.
Nakoneczny said the main goal
of any textbook reduction program
is to make sure the cost does not
come back to the student.
"Textbook costs are becoming a
solid public issue and everyone
wants to find a solution," she said.
Blackledge said the most important
thing for students to do is to keep
the heat on the publishers.
"If publishers ignore the guide
lines, then we're going to have to
come back and get tougher," he
said.

the wrong decision when he vetoed
the rental bill.
"It could have saved money for
college students each semester, and
that's something politicians should
really embrace," he said.
Blackledge said a number of col
leges have successfully launched a
textbook rental program. Students
who participate in the program are
the ones who provide the funding
for it.
"What the students end up pay
ing is just a small amount compared
to what they'd pay if they bought
the books," he said.
Nakoneczny said the main goal
of any textbook reduction program
is to make sure the cost does not
come back to the student.
"Textbook costs are becoming a
solid public issue and everyone
wants to find a solution," she said.
Blackledge said the most important
thing for students to do is to keep
the heat on the publishers.
"If publishers ignore the guide
lines, then we're going to have to
come back and get tougher," he
said.
