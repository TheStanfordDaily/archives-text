# ELECTRONIC VOTING HITS CALIFORNIA
## Stanford professors point to lingering security concerns... 
### BONITA SONG STAFF WRITER 
Last week. Gov. Arnold Schwarzeneg
ger signed a bill requiring that all electron
ic voting machines provide a paper trail for
verifying votes by 2006. The bill was writ
ten after paperless machines lost thou
sands of votes cast in the California March
primaries.
"This bill represents a great victory for
us," said Computer Science Prof. David Dill.
The new legislation represents a decisive vic
tor)', too: The bill passed unanimously through
both bodies of the state legislature.
Dill is an expert on hardware verification
by day and a major proponent of verified vot
ing in his free time.
As one of the pioneering advocates for
paper trails, he remembers when the idea
of ensuring a paper trail was not so popular.
He and colleagues first presented potential
problems regarding paperless systems to
the Santa Clara County Board of Supervi
sors last year.
Their concerns at the time were met with
indifference and skepticism.
"Initially," he said, "it really seemed
hopeless."
Since then, a lot has changed in the voting
technology.
In 2001, the nation had just come off a
painful experience with punch-card systems,
which rendered election officials eager to try
something new. Electronic voting seemed to
present itself as the perfect alternative.
First of all, a standard electronic voting
machine somewhat resembles the übiqui
tous ATM that millions of Americans are al
ready comfortable using. Additionally,
these voting machines had already been in
limited use for over a decade. Given this,
election officials felt they had good reason
to consider the technology both sound and
voter-friendly.
Moreover, electronic voting machines

tabulate votes nearly instantaneously, so re
counts would be a snap. Electronic voting
machines are particularly accessible to sight
and hearing-disabled people. And they are
also more convenient for citizens who speak
languages other than English.
As such, the machines were slated to
one day replace the punch cards that had
menaced Florida in the 2000 presidential
election.
But the first bad news about electronic
voting came later that year. The fledgling
Caltech-MIT Voting Technology Project
published a report that compared voting
systems according to a standard accuracy
benchmark called the "residual vote." Ap
parently. after compiling records from
presidential elections in 1988 to 2000. the
VTF found that electronic voting was actu
ally barely more accurate than punch-card
systems.
This also meant it fell far short of the most
accurate system, determined to be optical
scanning used with "bubble sheet" ballots.
Nevertheless, electronic voting fans were
undaunted. Blaming the disappointing re
sults on the newness of the technology, opti
mists pointed to the VTP's additional find
ing that electronic voting accuracy had at
least improved with time, and re-rallied
around the technology's strength as an ac
cessible voting system.
In 2002, their strategy proved effective:
The Help America Vote Act passed through
the U.S. Congress that year. Under this act,
all states have to provide electronic voting
machines for their disabled voters by 2006.
Also in that same year, electronic voting
received some popular support from new e
voters, who appreciated the reported effi
ciency of the process.
Such appreciation was illustrated in a
2002 press release by the Johnson County,
Kansas election commissioner, in which an
anonymous first-timer cites the county's
new electronic voting machines as "another

reason Johnson County is one of the best
places to live."
Just as electronic voting seemed to settle
into place, however, the rap on security is
sues came.
Last year, a woman named Bev Harris
came across an insecure FTP site of election
systems manufacturer Diebold Inc. She re
trieved the source code for one of their most

popular electronic voting machines — the
AccuVote-TS — and proceeded to post the
code online.
This attracted the notice of Adam Stub
blefield and Avi Rubin, computer scientists
at the Johns Hopkins University Informa

tion Security Institute. They ran the code on
their personal computers, analyzed it and ul
timately published a paper of their findings
in lEEE Symposium on security and privacy.
Blasting the lines of C++ computer code
as lacking "even the most minimal security
standards applicable in other contexts," the
authors contended (and still contend) that
insiders and outside hackers alike could in
flict serious attacks on the AccuVote-TS
system — with or without the code — and
back out without a trace.
Immediately Diebold countered with the
declarations that the stolen code was o£ an
old version, and the scientists' claims were
either inaccurate or incomplete. Neverthe
less, the damage was done: Having caught
the media's attention, forgotten incidences
of e-voting anomalies then bubbled up all
over the country.
The reputation of e-voting security has
been dogged ever since.
Diebold Inc. in particular has suffered re
curring blows to its credibility since 2003.
During the March primaries this year,
Diebold illegally installed uncertified and
federally unqualified voting systems across
counties in both Maryland and California.
Not only that, but several of the uncerti
fied machines installed in California subse
quently suffered mechanical failures, re
sulting in the permanent loss of several
thousand votes. This combination of
events convinced California Secretary of
State Kevin Shelley to completely ban e
voting machines in four counties. He also
unleashed a livid press statement against
Diebold. Shelley also launched a criminal
suit against Diebold. which was later
dropped.
Finally, in this cynical and polarized
election season it has been pointed out that
most of the voting machines currently in
use are manufactured by just three compa
nies — Election Systems & Software,
Diebold Inc. and Sequoia Voting Systems

— and that both ES&S and Diebold have
maintained strong ties with the Republican
Party.
Whether or not you believe in the variety
of conspiracy theories, there are a number of
ways in which electronic voting can go
wrong.
Without paper trails, explained Dill,
there may be no way to do a recount or oth
erwise check for fraud or machine failure —
both of which remain potential hazards as e
voting technology matures.
Also, electronic voting technology is still
under development, even though its propo
nents present e-voting machines as fail
proof "voting ATMs" ready for primetime.
While touch-screen voting machines
may look and interact like ATMs, their
use is subject to very different constraints.
After all, as Dill pointed out, ATMs don't
have to preserve the anonymity of the
user — in fact, they are designed to do the
opposite. As a result, much of the security
protocol needed for voting machines must
be designed specifically for the voting
process.
In the ASSU elections on campus, for ex
ample, votes must be tallied on two separate
lists: One which records who has voted, the
other which tallies what the votes are, said
Peter Pawlowski of the ASSU Elections
Commission.
Dill did not rule out the possibility of at
taining trustworthy elections that are com
pletely paperless some day. However, he
contended that it will take "considerable
time" to develop the technology and gain
sufficient user trust.
In the meantime, it looks like we might
have to stick with what we have right now.
In the case of Santa Clara County resi
dents, that means using paperless electronic
systems which it purchased against the
pleadings of Dill and other computer scien
tists last year — and which it will now have
to replace or modify by 2006.

published a report that compared voting
systems according to a standard accuracy
benchmark called the "residual vote." Ap
parently. after compiling records from
presidential elections in 1988 to 2000. the
VTF found that electronic voting was actu
ally barely more accurate than punch-card
systems.
This also meant it fell far short of the most
accurate system, determined to be optical
scanning used with "bubble sheet" ballots.
Nevertheless, electronic voting fans were
undaunted. Blaming the disappointing re
sults on the newness of the technology, opti
mists pointed to the VTP's additional find
ing that electronic voting accuracy had at
least improved with time, and re-rallied
around the technology's strength as an ac
cessible voting system.
In 2002, their strategy proved effective:
The Help America Vote Act passed through
the U.S. Congress that year. Under this act,
all states have to provide electronic voting
machines for their disabled voters by 2006.
Also in that same year, electronic voting
received some popular support from new e
voters, who appreciated the reported effi
ciency of the process.
Such appreciation was illustrated in a
2002 press release by the Johnson County,
Kansas election commissioner, in which an
anonymous first-timer cites the county's
new electronic voting machines as "another

reason Johnson County is one of the best
places to live."
Just as electronic voting seemed to settle
into place, however, the rap on security is
sues came.
Last year, a woman named Bev Harris
came across an insecure FTP site of election
systems manufacturer Diebold Inc. She re
trieved the source code for one of their most

popular electronic voting machines — the
AccuVote-TS — and proceeded to post the
code online.
This attracted the notice of Adam Stub
blefield and Avi Rubin, computer scientists
at the Johns Hopkins University Informa

tion Security Institute. They ran the code on
their personal computers, analyzed it and ul
timately published a paper of their findings
in lEEE Symposium on security and privacy.
Blasting the lines of C++ computer code
as lacking "even the most minimal security
standards applicable in other contexts," the
authors contended (and still contend) that
insiders and outside hackers alike could in
flict serious attacks on the AccuVote-TS
system — with or without the code — and
back out without a trace.
Immediately Diebold countered with the
declarations that the stolen code was o£ an
old version, and the scientists' claims were
either inaccurate or incomplete. Neverthe
less, the damage was done: Having caught
the media's attention, forgotten incidences
of e-voting anomalies then bubbled up all
over the country.
The reputation of e-voting security has
been dogged ever since.
Diebold Inc. in particular has suffered re
curring blows to its credibility since 2003.
During the March primaries this year,
Diebold illegally installed uncertified and
federally unqualified voting systems across
counties in both Maryland and California.
Not only that, but several of the uncerti
fied machines installed in California subse
quently suffered mechanical failures, re
sulting in the permanent loss of several
thousand votes. This combination of
events convinced California Secretary of
State Kevin Shelley to completely ban e
voting machines in four counties. He also
unleashed a livid press statement against
Diebold. Shelley also launched a criminal
suit against Diebold. which was later
dropped.
Finally, in this cynical and polarized
election season it has been pointed out that
most of the voting machines currently in
use are manufactured by just three compa
nies — Election Systems & Software,
Diebold Inc. and Sequoia Voting Systems

— and that both ES&S and Diebold have
maintained strong ties with the Republican
Party.
Whether or not you believe in the variety
of conspiracy theories, there are a number of
ways in which electronic voting can go
wrong.
Without paper trails, explained Dill,
there may be no way to do a recount or oth
erwise check for fraud or machine failure —
both of which remain potential hazards as e
voting technology matures.
Also, electronic voting technology is still
under development, even though its propo
nents present e-voting machines as fail
proof "voting ATMs" ready for primetime.
While touch-screen voting machines
may look and interact like ATMs, their
use is subject to very different constraints.
After all, as Dill pointed out, ATMs don't
have to preserve the anonymity of the
user — in fact, they are designed to do the
opposite. As a result, much of the security
protocol needed for voting machines must
be designed specifically for the voting
process.
In the ASSU elections on campus, for ex
ample, votes must be tallied on two separate
lists: One which records who has voted, the
other which tallies what the votes are, said
Peter Pawlowski of the ASSU Elections
Commission.
Dill did not rule out the possibility of at
taining trustworthy elections that are com
pletely paperless some day. However, he
contended that it will take "considerable
time" to develop the technology and gain
sufficient user trust.
In the meantime, it looks like we might
have to stick with what we have right now.
In the case of Santa Clara County resi
dents, that means using paperless electronic
systems which it purchased against the
pleadings of Dill and other computer scien
tists last year — and which it will now have
to replace or modify by 2006.

machine in a recent election.
Last week. Gov. Arnold Schwarzeneg
ger signed a bill requiring that all electron
ic voting machines provide a paper trail for
verifying votes by 2006. The bill was writ
ten after paperless machines lost thou
sands of votes cast in the California March
primaries.
"This bill represents a great victory for
us," said Computer Science Prof. David Dill.
The new legislation represents a decisive vic
tor)', too: The bill passed unanimously through
both bodies of the state legislature.
Dill is an expert on hardware verification
by day and a major proponent of verified vot
ing in his free time.
As one of the pioneering advocates for
paper trails, he remembers when the idea
of ensuring a paper trail was not so popular.
He and colleagues first presented potential
problems regarding paperless systems to
the Santa Clara County Board of Supervi
sors last year.
Their concerns at the time were met with
indifference and skepticism.
"Initially," he said, "it really seemed
hopeless."
Since then, a lot has changed in the voting
technology.
In 2001, the nation had just come off a
painful experience with punch-card systems,
which rendered election officials eager to try
something new. Electronic voting seemed to
present itself as the perfect alternative.
First of all, a standard electronic voting
machine somewhat resembles the übiqui
tous ATM that millions of Americans are al
ready comfortable using. Additionally,
these voting machines had already been in
limited use for over a decade. Given this,
election officials felt they had good reason
to consider the technology both sound and
voter-friendly.
Moreover, electronic voting machines

tabulate votes nearly instantaneously, so re
counts would be a snap. Electronic voting
machines are particularly accessible to sight
and hearing-disabled people. And they are
also more convenient for citizens who speak
languages other than English.
As such, the machines were slated to
one day replace the punch cards that had
menaced Florida in the 2000 presidential
election.
