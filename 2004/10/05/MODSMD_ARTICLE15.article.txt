# What site do you 'google' to learn about Google?
## When in doubt, just try GoogleGuide.com 
### SU FEN LEE DESK EDITOR 
Googleguide.com, or Google Guide, is
an entire Web site dedicated to teaching
users — both beginner and advanced —
how to best leverage the Google search en
gine and all of its features. If you learn by
trying examples and working through ex
ercises, Google Guide is the place for you.
Google Guide, however, was not writ
ten by any member of the Google team.
Neither is Google Guide the property of
Google.
"I include many examples and exercis
es designed to give users practice with the
material presented and to inspire them to
find amusing or useful information," said
Nancy Blachman, who is president and
founder of Variable Symbols.
A former Stanford computer science in
structor and a self-proclaimed Google fan,
Blachman is the writer and owner of
Google Guide.
"Just as the best way to learn how to
sail is to sail, the best way to learn how to
search with Google is to search with
Google," Blachman said.
Even though Google has yet to give
Nancy an official response to Google
Guide, this self-guided tutorial has al
ready been used by over 2 million people
since February.
Not only have some Google engineers
publicized Google Guide internally and
in their blogs, but even "some Google
employees have offered me suggestions
and corrections," she said.
Blachman advises visitors to her site to
"try the examples, work the exercises and
click on the links (usually underlined) to
see Google in action and to learn more
about a topic."

Some might wonder why Blachman
decide to write Google Guide.
"Before I started working on Google
Guide, I — like many users — used only
a small number of Google's services and
features," Blachman said.
"I learned about Google from a friend
in April of 1999 when she told me her site
was listed highly on the search engine,"
she continued. "That was the first time 1
had heard of it. I got more interested in it
when my husband interviewed and start
ed working for Google in the summer of
1999."
Blachman explained that she then de-

cided to learn more about Google's fea
tures and capabilities in order to "de
scribe them in more depth than what
you'll find on Google's help pages."
"As I learned more, I became more
adept at quickly finding what I sought,"
she added.
Early last year, Jerry Peek, author of
Unix Power Tools, gave Blachman the
idea of writing a book about using
Google.
"I found this idea appealing because I
was a fan of Google, was interested in learn
ing how to use it better, there were no other
books about Google when I started writing,
and I could work flexible hours with such a

job," Blachman recalled.
Blachman gave seminars on searching
with Google to get feedback from users.
She wanted to make sure that she was de
veloping material that users would find
useful and engaging.
In spring of last year, Blachman start
ed developing the Google Guide.
"I started by copying a short tutorial
that Google developed, which is no longer
online," Blachman said. "I changed the
content of the pages. When it became clear
that Google wasn't going to put Google
Guide up on its site, I hired a graphic de
signer to give Google Guide a distinct look
and feel," she added.
Wanting to have a big audience and real
izing that people might copy Google Guide
even if she copyrighted it, Blachman decid
ed to place the Google Guide under a cre
ative commons license. Such a license gives
users more rights than a copyright allows:
Users are free to copy, distribute, display
and perform the work, as well as make
derivative works, provided they give her
credit and link to the original version of
Google Guide.
Users are also not allowed to use this
work for commercial purposes. In addi
tion. they can only distribute any deriva
tive works under the same license.
As a result of this, other search-engine
enthusiasts have translated Google Guide
into one other language, with many more
translations on the way. It is currently
available in Danish. Italian. French, Per
sian and Chinese versions are in the works.
Even teachers have incorporated sec
tions of Google Guide into their course
materials.
During the summer of last year,
Blachman started co-authoring a book
entitled. "How to Do Everything with

Google." She completed the book in Oc
tober, and the book was published in
December.
In addition to enhancing Google
Guide, Blachman has plans to turn the
contents of Google Guide into a book. She
also wants to add tips on how to search for

different types of information.
"1 would like to make moje audience
specific tutorials on the web," Blachman
said, "But I have four-year-old twins that
currently keep me from doing things
other than working on Google Guide."

Variable Symbols, of which Blachman is
owner and founder, is a company that spe
cializes in software training and consulting.
Blachman founded Variable Symbols
in 1989 shortly after leaving her job as
technical training manager at Wolfram
Research, Inc., the company that devel
oped Mathematica.
"Variable Symbols has moved wherev
er I've moved," Blachman said, "It's
been located in Berkeley, Oakland,
Princeton, Palo Alto, and now it's in
Mountain View."
"These days, when I'm not working for
Variable Symbols, I work on Google
Guide or on things related to it," Blach
man added.
Google Guide is not merely about
strategies for finding what you want on the
Google search engine. It also describes
special features, like the built-in calcula
tor, map search and news alerts.
Blachman's favorite feature is Google
Answers. Fora fee, Google Answers pro
vides assistance from expert online re
searchers to find the information you need.
"I'm most impressed with Google An
swers," Blachman said. "I'm surprised it
isn't a more popular service. Not only can
you ask research questions, you can ask
opinion questions. For example, how can
I improve Google Guide?"
This was precisely what Blachman did:
She asked Google Answers for suggestions
to improve her Google Guide Web site.
"I'm grateful to Google Answers re
searchers for their feedback and sugges
tions for improving Google Guide." she
said.
From 1990 to 1998, Blachman taught
the University course Computer Science
50: "Problem Solving with Mathematica
at Stanford."



Nancy Blachman, who taught CS courses at
Stanford from 1990 to 1998, has created a
new guide !o the Google search engine.
