## Editorial Nepotistic Row staff selection process should be reformed 
### 
Cries of nepotism ring around campus
during winter quarter when it comes
time for the selection of coveted Row
staff positions.
Because the Row house staff of the current
year is allowed to choose the staff for the next
year, it is a common perception that those who
are able to live on the Row one year are favored
to be on staff the following year. Additionally,
because the Row house staff of the following
year is chosen by the staff of the current year,
many are suspicious that the current staff will
choose either themselves or their friends.
It is natural for applicants to be disgruntled
when they discover that a position they want has
been filled by someone who lived in the house the
previous year, or worse yet, someone who is
friends with the old staff. Those who are qualified
might not stand a chance against those with per
sonal connections.
It also becomes a concern for Row residents
who may as a result be suspicious that someone on
staff did not earn his or her position but was mere
ly good friends with someone from the previous
year. The quality of the staff is called into ques
tion when the system of selection is susceptible to
favoritism for certain applicants.
One student who has been on Row staff both
last year and this year admitted that if applicants
knew someone on staff, they would most likely
be guaranteed an interview. However, he de
fended the current system by saying the appli
cant would be on equal footing with everyone
else applying for the same position during the in
terview process.
The issue is definitely not a new one, as The
Daily has run editorials in the past urging the Row
housing office to reform the process so that it is
more fair for students who have never lived on the

Row before. The Row housing office has plenty of
time to make the changes necessary to ensure a
more fair system where such nepotism can be
eliminated.
The selection of applicants that are eligible to
move on to the interview process could be much
more fair. For example, if the applicants were
kept anonymous for those choosing among
them, current staff members would not feel
pressured to grant a position to a friend that
they do not feel is qualified.
Along that line of reasoning, it is not clear in
the first place why students should select the staff
in the first place. Row house office staff members
could determine who would make the best Row
house staff members.
When students are applying for staff positions
in dorms, resident fellows base their selections on
the same criteria: the application and the inter
view. There are none of the friendships or grudges
or any other complicated relationships that come
into play when students choose fellow students for
positions of power.
However, as one current Row staff member
pointed out, students know each other best, espe
cially their friends and people they have lived with
in the same house all year. They know who will ac
tually make the best staff members: the ones who
will pitch in during hash, who will make an effort
to be friendly with all the residents, and so on.
Yet this problem could be remedied by a stu
dent providing references in their application to
people who could vouch for their ability to do the
job well. One of these references could be a cur
rent Row house staff member who could tell an
objective selector how wonderful their friend is
and why they deserve a positionâ€”rather than
having the power to grant them that position and
be accused of nepotism.
