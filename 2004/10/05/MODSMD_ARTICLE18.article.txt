## Good leaders reevaluate decisions 
### JONATHAN KARPICK 
The presidential debates may
be the closest we get to a frank dis
cussion away from the sound-bite
politics that appear to be the main
focus of this election.
Thanks to the candor of the
candidates and Jim Lehrer's point
ed questions, the electorate may fi
nally be able to focus on critically
evaluating the differences between
President Bush and Senator Kerry.
One of the starkest differences
is each candidate's plan for our
continued effort in Iraq.
As a veteran of Operation Iraqi
Freedom, I feel a connection to
Senator Kerry's experience upon
returning from Vietnam and can
relate to his statements during the
debate regarding the war.
He drew a sharp contrast be
tween his criticism of the policies
and planning that led to our in
volvement in Iraq and his support
for the U.S. military with the state
ment, "It is vital for us not to con
fuse the war, ever, with the war
riors."
For me, this is an extremely im
portant point. During my year as
an activated reservist in Iraq, I
found myself in the company of the
most incredible people with whom

one could ever hope to work.
It is not an exaggeration to say
that, overall, the citizens currently
serving with the military in Iraq
represent the absolute best the
United States has to offer.
Senator Kerry said it best when
he stated that our soldiers' effort
and sacrifice in Iraq is noble:
"That's the most noble thing that
anybody can do, and I want to
make sure the outcome honors
that nobility."
Since returning from Iraq, I
have been troubled by the discon
nection between my perception of
the ability and determination our
forces display and results that do
not match what one would expect
from such Herculean efforts.
During my year in Iraq, I
worked 16 to 18 hours a day, seven
days a week, and I doubt that
tempo has changed since my de
parture.
In my view, the difficulties
plaguing the stabilization of Iraq
are not a result of poor implemen
tation by the military, but are an
indication of troubling policies
held by the current administration.
During the debate, one of the
topics discussed was which candi
date would be the best choice for
commander in chief. President

Bush takes the position that, as the
current commander in chief, he
maintains an unwavering stance
and any contrarian views fail to
support our troops and endanger
our country.
Those who disagree with this
view are labeled as unfit for lead
ership. I do not understand this ar
gument. and I agree with Senator
Kerry when he says that "certain
ty, sometimes, can get you in trou
ble."
I have found that the best lead
ers in the military are those who
continuously reevaluate the situa
tion and adapt their actions and
decisions appropriately.
When presented with an ongo
ing operation going awry, focusing
too much on past events and who
was to blame proved less effective
than simply reassessing your op
tions given new information and
establishing a new path.
Staying the course was rarely
the correct answer. Someone un
able to adapt to changing and
evolving environments would
never last in the military.
