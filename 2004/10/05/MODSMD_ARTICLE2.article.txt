# After nine months, Slav Dom rehires chef
## 
### SARAH RIZK 
The chef for Row house Slavian
skii Dom has returned, a relief to
the staff, which had been improvis
ing to provide sustenance to its res
idents since the beginning of spring
quarter last year.
When Slav Dorn's chef. Charles
Wilson, left to take a different job
at the end of winter quarter, the res
idence staff struggled to find a re
placement. The staff scrambled to
feed their residents without a cook
or meal schedule, relying on their
creativity and a telephone.
"Two residents and one former
resident offered to cook to fill the
gap," said Slav Dom Kitchen Man
ager Scott Chanatry, a junior. "We
also ordered take-out food from
local eateries such as Quiznos."
To decrease the cost of ordering
take-out, the Slav Dom staff or
dered from restaurants that would
give a discount for the large quanti
ties of food, such as pizza places, the
Treehouse, and a local Indian
restaurant.
Even so, residents shouldered
an extra $100 on their board bill to
cover the take-out and costs in
curred searching fora new chef this
summer.
The search continued through
out the summer but staff members
did not find qualified applicants,
even after they posted notices on
the Web site Craigslist and inter
viewed numerous candidates.
The resident staff realized, how
ever. that take-out was not a long
term solution, since without a chef
coordinating the meals, the staff
had difficulty accommodating the
dietary needs of everyone in the
house.
"Every effort was made to ac
commodate allergies and other di
etary restrictions." Chanatry said.
"Vegetarian alternatives were of
fered at meals and a trip was made
to Whole Foods for special pur
chases."
Still, some of the students were
unhappy with the food provided,
listing one skipped meal and unsuit
able provisions for those with di
etary needs as some of the prob
lems residents endured.
"When we ordered In-N-Out
last week, there were no accommo
dations for vegetarians," said one
resident who asked to remain
anonymous. "Also, my drawmate
has a wheat allergy and he could not
eat most of the meals because no
special provisions were made."
So it was welcome news that
Wilson would re-assume his posi
tion as chef for the Russian and
East European theme dorm. Yes
terday, his first day back, he served
his signature Chinese chicken salad
for lunch.
Slav Dom is not the first house
to have difficulties with chefs leav
ing for personal or career-driven
reasons. Last year, Bob's chef took
a sick leave in the middle of winter

quarter, forcing the house staff to
search for an interim chef, which
they did by the beginning of spring
quarter. Bob's staff also had to
order take-out during the period in
which they lacked a chef.
"The reality with any job is that
employees will become sick or
quit," said senior Joey Natoli, who
was Bob's financial manager last
year. "It is impossible and impracti
cal to have a backup chef at all
times."
