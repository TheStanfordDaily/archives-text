### SARAH RIZK 
The chef for Row house Slavian
skii Dom has returned, a relief to
the staff, which had been improvis
ing to provide sustenance to its res
idents since the beginning of spring
quarter last year.
When Slav Dorn's chef. Charles
Wilson, left to take a different job
at the end of winter quarter, the res
idence staff struggled to find a re
placement. The staff scrambled to
feed their residents without a cook

to Whole Foods for special pur

Still, some of the students were
unhappy with the food provided,
listing one skipped meal and unsuit
able provisions for those with di
etary needs as some of the prob

"When we ordered In-N-Out
last week, there were no accommo

resident who asked to remain
