## Hoover: How to deal 
### 
In 1932, the U.S. economy was
shrinking at 10 percent per year
and one in four workers had lost
their jobs. The Republican candi
date, Herbert Hoover, seemed un
willing to recognize the disaster or
change his policies. He branded his
Democratic opponent. Franklin
Roosevelt, an advocate of big gov
ernment.
Hoover proclaimed that, "It we
help big business, everyone will bene
fit — the trickle

down effect will
help everyone get
back to work."
Roosevelt won in
a landslide. By
1938. under Roo
sevelt's leader
ship, unemploy
ment was down
by 2.6 million
people. By the

time Roosevelt died in office, there
were more jobs than people.
Today, only one monument exists
to President Hoover. You see it
every day on your way to class. Al
though it seems like the rest of the
world has moved on since the
Hoover era, within the walls of that
one forlorn monument his spirit has
been kept alive.
The Hoover Institution puts out a
"paid editorial" series as ads in news
magazines. My favorite of these is by
Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka.
They argue that our tax code is too
complicated: Every incentive to do
some specific worthwhile thing re
sults in a higher overall tax rate. This
punishes everyone who works.
That's a serious argument, and
Hoover employs a lot of serious and
very smart people. We're lucky to
have them on this campus.
But the story doesn't end there.
When they got started in 1981, Hall
and Rabushka wrote a serious rev
enue-neutral proposal that just sim
plified the tax code. Today, their pro
posal has become the Hoover Insti
tution plan to roll our government
back two decades and give the bene
fits to the ultra-rich.
Just as Herbert Hoover promised
to raise spending, cut taxes and bal
ance the budget, Robert Hall and

Alvin Rabushka now disingenuously
state that everyone gets a tax cut
under their plan. Whoa, money for
free. The Hall-Rabushka plan, once
serious thinking, is now anti-tax pro
paganda with a hokey Herbert
Hoover veneer.
This story exemplifies the Hoover
business model in action. Contrary to
popular belief. Hoovers right-wing
activities are not funded by the Uni
versity. Hoover raises money from
conservative activists in return for
publishing that the greenhouse effect
is not a problem or stating, with com
plete seriousness, that we need to
end the sanctions on Cuba "and
that's why I hate Bill Clinton." The
donations just pour in. To adamant
right-wingers, validation from seri
ous, well-respected academics is
priceless.
So Hoover doesn't fund right
wing activities with University
money; they fund University activi
ties with right-wing money. Hoover
does serious scholarship, but in re
turn they lend their respectability to
the right wing.
How do we fight Hoover's right
wing nonsense? Well, Roosevelt did
in 1932. His solution: Don't get mad,
get even.
If Hoover is out of touch, point
out the problems; if Hoover offers
bad policies, outline better ones; if
Hoover proposes moving backward,
offer a vision for the future; if Hoover
puts something in print, rebut it; and
if Hoover runs for president, beat
him.
We don't want to kick Hoover off
campus or shut it down — we're glad
these smart people are here. And we
don't want to cut off University fund
ing— we only fund the library, and
it's a smart arrangement on our end.
We just need a systematic answer to
the right-wing propaganda.
Fortunately, it will only take
about three students working five
hours a week to systematically rebut
all the nonsense Hoover puts out.
Stanford, get ready for the Roosevelt
Institution.

Kai Stinchcombe is president of the
