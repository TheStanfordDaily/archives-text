Students should be able to
reclaim their P.O. Boxes
I'd just like to extend my thanks
to The Daily for once. This time,
they found out about something
before I even did.
I wondered why I had not re
ceived any mail since the start of
the school year, and why someone
else's mail kept popping up in my
box. It had not even occurred to
me that my box had been reas
signed, but in fact, that's what had
happened.
I had to go to the post office,
wait in their long line, and then be

told to join the mob at the P.O.
Box renewal office in the base
ment of Old Union before I could
even find out for myself.
I am more than upset at this
glitch. The Daily hit it right on the
nose when they said that the up
perclassmen deserve their P.O.
Boxes back.
My credit history, my bills, my
bank account, my paychecks, my
magazine subscriptions, my cell
phone, my taxes and more are all
affiliated with that P.O. Box. The
number of customer service orga
nizations with whom I'm going to
have to speak is uncountable, not

to mention time consuming and
costly.
Because of the address change,
the checks that my bank gave me
are no longer valid, and I will have
to pay them to print me new ones.
It is not right that I have to spend
my own money in order to correct
someone else's error.
And what about the other per
son? The person who now has my
P.O. Box has a prime location in
the front and center, while I've
been relegated to the dark rear
corners of the Post Office.
They've received a couple
coupon flyers in the two or three

weeks they've squatted in my box,
while I've been waiting on two
paychecks. They probably don't
even have a local bank account yet,
and Mom's first care package is
still in transit. Meanwhile my mail
is drifting about the mail-sorting
room, trying to find a home.
Why did I have to find out about
this through The Daily? This error
has been known since before
school began. Why was I not
changed back, or at the very least
notified of the change in time for
my return to campus?
I asked the person in the P.O.
Box Renewal office about this.

and he pointed to a sign — posted
only on their door and nowhere
else — about switched locks as
justification. My lock was not
switched; my key still works. The
box number itself was switched. I
asked why he could not give me
back my rightful number, and he
just shrugged.
On behalf of all those who have
been affected by this computer
glitch. I demand a prompt return
of my P.O. Box, and an explana
tion for the incompetence of those
in charge of the situation.
Why were we not immediately
informed of the error and given a

policy statement detailing the plan
of corrective action? If all you had
to do to give us a new P.O. Box
number was click a button on a
Web form, why is it impossible to
do that for the other people who
are now using our rightful P.O.
Boxes?
I am livid at the mishandling of
this situation. My P.O. Box is right
fully mine, and I want it back. Im
mediately.
