## Keep Electoral College 
### BILL WHALEN 
The prospect of another close
presidential election has some peo
ple demanding that the nation's
Electoral College be reformed. It's
one reason to hope that whichever
party prevails this November does
so decisively, to discourage any
change in how America chooses its
leaders.
At present, 270 electoral votes
are required to win the presidency
— each state's electoral count is
the same as its congressional dele
gation (California, for example,
with 53 House members and 2 sen
ators, has 55 electoral votes). All
but two states — Maine and Ne
braska — award their electoral
votes on a winner-take-all basis
that does not take into account
margin of victory.
Thus there is room for contro
versy, such as that which occurred
four years ago when George W.
Bush earned 271 electoral votes to
A1 Gore's 266, despite Mr. Gore's
winning the popular vote. It was
the third time since the Civil War
that the presidency has been decid
ed by such a split verdict.
But does the outcome four years
ago — and the outside chance that
the pattern could repeat itself this
fall — merit a change to the Con
stitution? The answer is a resound
ing no, when one considers many of
the alternatives. Those include
1. Popular vote. Scrap the Elec
toral College: whichever candidate
gets the most votes gets the top of
fice.
2. Popular bonus. Retain the
current system, but give the winner
of the popular vote extra electoral
votes as a reward for carrying a
state's popular vote.
3. Congressional districts. In
stead of winner-take-all, award
electoral votes per congressional
district (this is the system in effect
in Maine and Nebraska).
4. Proportional allocation. Di

vide each state's electoral votes ac
cording to the popular vote (such a
change is on the ballot in Colorado
this November).
Unfortunately, America's
smaller states stand to lose if any of
these reforms take place. Candi
dates would spend more time in
larger states where there are a
greater number of votes and, po
tentially, greater rewards.
Big states, with their large
media markets, would dominate
the fall campaign. That would
make fora tactical and stylistic
change: presidential elections
based more on mass marketing in
urban areas than on retail political
skills in rural communities.
Ironically, that's the polar oppo
site of how the two parties choose
their nominees: sizing up candi
dates as they go door to door in
small towns in lowa and New
Hampshire.
Over the past 200 years, some
700 proposals have been intro
duced in Congress to reform or
eliminate the Electoral College. In
stead. lawmakers should recognize
the realities of these times: in the
past three presidential elections,
no candidate achieved 50 percent
of the vote.
Although he did lose the popu
lar vote by 0.5 percent of the na
tional total, Mr. Bush nevertheless
carried 30 of the 50 states, 228 of
the 435 congressional districts, and
2,480 counties to Mr. Goie's 674.
In this regard, the Electoral Col
lege narrowly chose a winner based
on his performance as the candi
date with broader national appeal.
Come to think of it.it is a national
election, not a regional choice.
