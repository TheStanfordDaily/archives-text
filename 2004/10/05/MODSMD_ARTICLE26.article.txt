## XCountry runs to double victory at Notre Dame Invite 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alter its success at the Stanford Invitational last
week, the Stanford cross country team traveled all the
way to Indiana this weekend but continued running as
though it had a home-turf advantage.
Both the men's and women's teams won the meet,
which included a 5,000 meter course for the women
and an 8,000 meter run for the men, solidifying the
Cardinal's reputation as one of the fastest teams in
the country.
It also solidified senior Sara Bei's reputation as a
leader. In her second consecutive victory, Bei led the
top-ranked Stanford women's cross country team to a
first-place finish at the 49th Annual Notre Dame In
vitational held at Burke Memorial Golf Course on
Oct. 1.
Setting the pace at a five minute, 17 second per mile
clip, Bei beat 194 other runners to complete the 5,000
meter race in 16:22. Her performance led the defending
NCAA champions to a win that was 50 points ahead of

second-place Michigan and 93 points in front of third
place Notre Dame. Missouri and Michigan State round
ed out the top five.
Women's head coach Dena Evans partially attribut
ed the team's win to the consistent performance of Bei.
"[Bei] went out and really executed the last two
weeks, and that always gives encouragement to other
girls on the team to give a solid team performance,"
Evans said.
The senior completed the race nine seconds ahead of
the second-place finisher. Notre Dame's Molly Huddle.
Craig was 12 seconds behind Bei and finished in third,
while Katy Trotter's time was 30 seconds off of Bei's,
placing her in seventh. Anita Siraki completed the top
ten with a time of 17:02.
In addition to the two time Pac-10 individual champ,
the other competing runners included eight of Bei's own
teammates, among them redshirt freshman Julie Allen,
freshmen Lindsay Allen and Shannon Bergstadt, sopho-

Though the men's cross country runners couldn't clinch an in

all win. The women's squad also took first, claiming three of
the top ten spots in the 5,000 meter race.

and Siraki.
"I am very happy with the team
performance on Friday," Amanda
Trotter said. "Everyone executed
their plan and we came out on top. I
think that the team has a lot of po
tential to do well in upcoming
meets. Right now, it is our job to
stay focused on each race as they
come. There are many good teams
out there."
Many of those good teams were
present at the Invitational. The ex
cellent showing was especially sweet
against tough competition, since
nine of the Cardinal's 24 opponents
were ranked in the top 30.
"It was good to get some of the
cobwebs out early in the season,"
Evans said. "I was pleased with the
way the athletes responded to the
challenge."
The women weren't alone. The
No. 2 Cardinal men beat out 23
other teams to clinch third place in
their 8,000 meter race and first place
overall.
Leading the pack for Stanford
was redshirt freshman Nef Araia,
who finished with a time of 23:44.
Arriving ten seconds behind Araia
and in 10th place was redshirt
sophomore Jacob Gomez, who fin
ished 20th at the Pac-10 Champi
onships last year.
Also competing for Stanford
were freshman Forrest Tahdooah
nippah, redshirt sophomores Brett
Gotcher and Jon Pierce, and red
shirt juniors Robert Smitson and
David Vidal.
The two-time defending NCAA
champions also faced stiff competi

tion that included No. 9 BYU, No.
11 Butler, No. 13 Air Force and No.
15 Indiana.
"I think we were taken aback by
the intensity of the race at Notre
Dame," men's head coach Andy
Gerard said. "The course there is
about as flat and fast as any in the
NCAA and the field was very, very
solid. We expected it to give the
guys a very stiff challenge, which it
did. It forced our guys to step up,
which they did."
In spite of losing six seniors last
year to graduation, the Cardinal
beat second place Notre Dame by
six, finishing with 89 points. Butler,
Air Force and BYU took the next
three spots.
Now new faces are beginning to
appear in the men's lineup, and de
cisions are still being made about
who will redshirt.
Gerard was pleased to have an
early opportunity to gauge the sta
tus of his team.
"[lt's] more of an experience
issue, so meets like Notre Dame,
where we are under pressure from
high level competition, are impor
tant as learning tools." he said.
Stanford looked less like a team
that was in the learning process and
more like the seasoned runners that
are looking to maintain the NCAA
championship tradition.
"I was pleased for the guys to
come away with the win, and at the
same time, learn some very good
lessons for the coming weeks," Ger
ard said.
The Cardinal will have a chance
to utilize those lessons when they
travel to San Luis Obispo for the Cal
Poly Invitational on Oct. 16.

Stanford looked less like a team

Bei leads
Cardinal
Alter its success at the Stanford Invitational last
week, the Stanford cross country team traveled all the
way to Indiana this weekend but continued running as
though it had a home-turf advantage.
Both the men's and women's teams won the meet,
which included a 5,000 meter course for the women
and an 8,000 meter run for the men, solidifying the
Cardinal's reputation as one of the fastest teams in
the country.
It also solidified senior Sara Bei's reputation as a
leader. In her second consecutive victory, Bei led the
top-ranked Stanford women's cross country team to a
first-place finish at the 49th Annual Notre Dame In
vitational held at Burke Memorial Golf Course on
Oct. 1.
Setting the pace at a five minute, 17 second per mile
clip, Bei beat 194 other runners to complete the 5,000
meter race in 16:22. Her performance led the defending
NCAA champions to a win that was 50 points ahead of

second-place Michigan and 93 points in front of third
place Notre Dame. Missouri and Michigan State round
ed out the top five.
Women's head coach Dena Evans partially attribut
ed the team's win to the consistent performance of Bei.
"[Bei] went out and really executed the last two
weeks, and that always gives encouragement to other
girls on the team to give a solid team performance,"
Evans said.
The senior completed the race nine seconds ahead of
the second-place finisher. Notre Dame's Molly Huddle.
Craig was 12 seconds behind Bei and finished in third,
while Katy Trotter's time was 30 seconds off of Bei's,
placing her in seventh. Anita Siraki completed the top
ten with a time of 17:02.
In addition to the two time Pac-10 individual champ,
the other competing runners included eight of Bei's own
teammates, among them redshirt freshman Julie Allen,
freshmen Lindsay Allen and Shannon Bergstadt, sopho-

Though the men's cross country runners couldn't clinch an in

all win. The women's squad also took first, claiming three of
the top ten spots in the 5,000 meter race.

and seniors Alicia Craig, Jeane Goff
and Siraki.
"I am very happy with the team
performance on Friday," Amanda
Trotter said. "Everyone executed
their plan and we came out on top. I
think that the team has a lot of po
tential to do well in upcoming
meets. Right now, it is our job to
stay focused on each race as they
come. There are many good teams
out there."
Many of those good teams were
present at the Invitational. The ex
cellent showing was especially sweet
against tough competition, since
nine of the Cardinal's 24 opponents
were ranked in the top 30.
"It was good to get some of the
cobwebs out early in the season,"
Evans said. "I was pleased with the
way the athletes responded to the
challenge."
The women weren't alone. The
No. 2 Cardinal men beat out 23
other teams to clinch third place in
their 8,000 meter race and first place
overall.
Leading the pack for Stanford
was redshirt freshman Nef Araia,
who finished with a time of 23:44.
Arriving ten seconds behind Araia
and in 10th place was redshirt
sophomore Jacob Gomez, who fin
ished 20th at the Pac-10 Champi
onships last year.
Also competing for Stanford
were freshman Forrest Tahdooah
nippah, redshirt sophomores Brett
Gotcher and Jon Pierce, and red
shirt juniors Robert Smitson and
David Vidal.
The two-time defending NCAA
champions also faced stiff competi

tion that included No. 9 BYU, No.
11 Butler, No. 13 Air Force and No.
15 Indiana.
"I think we were taken aback by
the intensity of the race at Notre
Dame," men's head coach Andy
Gerard said. "The course there is
about as flat and fast as any in the
NCAA and the field was very, very
solid. We expected it to give the
guys a very stiff challenge, which it
did. It forced our guys to step up,
which they did."
