### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alter its success at the Stanford Invitational last
week, the Stanford cross country team traveled all the
way to Indiana this weekend but continued running as
though it had a home-turf advantage.
Both the men's and women's teams won the meet,
which included a 5,000 meter course for the women
and an 8,000 meter run for the men, solidifying the
Cardinal's reputation as one of the fastest teams in
the country.
It also solidified senior Sara Bei's reputation as a
leader. In her second consecutive victory, Bei led the
top-ranked Stanford women's cross country team to a
first-place finish at the 49th Annual Notre Dame In
vitational held at Burke Memorial Golf Course on
Oct. 1.
Setting the pace at a five minute, 17 second per mile
clip, Bei beat 194 other runners to complete the 5,000
meter race in 16:22. Her performance led the defending
NCAA champions to a win that was 50 points ahead of

second-place Michigan and 93 points in front of third
place Notre Dame. Missouri and Michigan State round
ed out the top five.
Women's head coach Dena Evans partially attribut
ed the team's win to the consistent performance of Bei.
"[Bei] went out and really executed the last two
weeks, and that always gives encouragement to other
girls on the team to give a solid team performance,"
Evans said.
The senior completed the race nine seconds ahead of
the second-place finisher. Notre Dame's Molly Huddle.
Craig was 12 seconds behind Bei and finished in third,
while Katy Trotter's time was 30 seconds off of Bei's,
placing her in seventh. Anita Siraki completed the top
ten with a time of 17:02.
In addition to the two time Pac-10 individual champ,
the other competing runners included eight of Bei's own
teammates, among them redshirt freshman Julie Allen,
freshmen Lindsay Allen and Shannon Bergstadt, sopho-

Though the men's cross country runners couldn't clinch an in
