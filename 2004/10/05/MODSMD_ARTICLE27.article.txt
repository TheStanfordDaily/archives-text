# Stanford Tennis preps for ITA All-American
## Cardinal look to capitalize on tourney's low-pressure environment and recover from 2003 disappointments 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
The No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team sends five of its
players to the IT A Women's All-American Championships
this week with the usual arsenal of consistent groundstrokes
a lid aggressive net plays.
But throw in the ever-potent, frustrating blend of confi
dence and flair, and you've got the makings of the squad
which lays claim to 13 NCAA Championship titles and has
topped the Pacific-10 Conference standings 17years running.

Last year. No. 17 senior Erin Burdette made a strong
showing at the All-American, losing to California alumna
Raquel Kops-Jones in the final, 6-3,6-2.
Kops-Jones (30-8), the first African-American woman
to win an NCAA Division I collegiate tennis title, closed out
her career at third in the nation. In her final season, Kops-
Jones troubled Stanford more than any other opponent,
posting a 5-1 record against Cardinal players.
Burdette received another automatic berth into this
year's competition, appropriately joined by her new dou
bles partner. No. 6 junior Alice Barnes.
Sophomores Theresa Logar and Anne Yelsey will join
the duo, provided they break through qualifying rounds of
play, which began yesterday.
Freshman Whitney Deason will team up with Yelsey for
her college tournament debut in the qualifying rounds of
doubles match play.
With the 2004-05 season opening for business at this Pa
cific Palisades, Calif., tournament, the Cardinal arrives on
the scene with victory on the brain and plans to remain chill.

despite what sweltering courtside conditions and stiff com
petition may come.
Barnes is one of the top eight seeds at Ail-American, a
tournament that recently expanded its singles playing field
from 32 of the nation's top players to 64. Joining Barnes are
Oregon's No. 8 Daria Panova, a two-time title-winner last
season, and Fresno State's No. 3 Jelena Pandzic, the runner
up at the NCAA Singles Championship to Stanford's own
top-ranked Amber Liu.
Barnes is no stranger to top rankings, competing in the
No. 2 singles slot as a sophomore and dropping only one
match in the regular season. Just the same, after a summer
of little match play, Barnes takes this coveted designation
with a sigh of relief.
"Being seeded took a little bit of the pressure off,"
Barnes said. "There are some great players who aren't seed
ed. [especially freshmen], but it just keeps you away from
the very best players fora couple of the first rounds."
It's no small feat to weather the ever-changing ranking
winds, but Barnes has never fallen below No. 21 in her blos
soming career. In light of her accomplishments, Barnes ap
proaches the first tournament of the season unfazed by her
lapse in competitive play this summer.
"To be honest, I felt kind of mentally drained after last
season," Barnes said. "So I trained [this summer] but I
didn't really play. [Now] I feel that I'm probably not playing
my best tennis as of yet, but we're working on it, so the form
should be good."
And sometimes, a first tournament is just that, a first.
Drawing 22 of the 25 top players in the preseason rankings,
the Ail-American gives its entrants a taste of challenging
non-league competition lacking from the regular season.
Consider it a mere October offering of talent that has yet to
train and will flourish by the end of next March, when the
stakes are higher.
Knowing that this year's team has yet to make its mark
in the competitive sphere, Stanford head coach Lele
Forood is content sending newbie Deason off to the quali
fying round of All-American while freshman Leila Hodzic
remains on the Farm.
"Right now, it's hard to tell where anyone will be in the
lineup," Forood said. "I need the All-American results. Re
gional, and maybe even the Indoor tournament to start to
get an idea of where everyone will end up."
Barnes added, "We always worry [in the fall] about how
the new recruits are settling in. Whitney and Leila look
eager, happy, and I couldn't be more excited about having
them on the team. They're excellent players."
That said, the All-American has the Cardinal looking to
improve on their mixed results of last fall. Barnes hopes to
survive the Round of 16, where she fell unceremoniously to
Tennessee's Tammy Encina in straight sets, 7-6 (4), 6-1.
No. 26 Logar hopes to make it out of the starting quali
fying gate, where novice jitters got the best of her in a 6-0,6-
3 shutout by Arizona's No. 7 Dianne Hollands.
No. 71 Yelsey, too, has a year of experience to help her
improve upon last October's prequalifying round loss. Her
three-set battle defeat at the hands of UCLA's Laura Gor
don, and lost 6-3,4-6,6-3, barely registered as a blip on the
radar.
Qualifying match play continues today, and the main
draw action begins Wednesday.

Kops-Jones (30-8), the first African-American woman
to win an NCAA Division I collegiate tennis title, closed out
her career at third in the nation. In her final season, Kops-
Jones troubled Stanford more than any other opponent,
posting a 5-1 record against Cardinal players.
Burdette received another automatic berth into this
year's competition, appropriately joined by her new dou
bles partner. No. 6 junior Alice Barnes.
Sophomores Theresa Logar and Anne Yelsey will join
the duo, provided they break through qualifying rounds of
play, which began yesterday.
Freshman Whitney Deason will team up with Yelsey for
her college tournament debut in the qualifying rounds of
doubles match play.
With the 2004-05 season opening for business at this Pa
cific Palisades, Calif., tournament, the Cardinal arrives on
the scene with victory on the brain and plans to remain chill.

despite what sweltering courtside conditions and stiff com
petition may come.
Barnes is one of the top eight seeds at Ail-American, a
tournament that recently expanded its singles playing field
from 32 of the nation's top players to 64. Joining Barnes are
Oregon's No. 8 Daria Panova, a two-time title-winner last
season, and Fresno State's No. 3 Jelena Pandzic, the runner
up at the NCAA Singles Championship to Stanford's own
top-ranked Amber Liu.
Barnes is no stranger to top rankings, competing in the
No. 2 singles slot as a sophomore and dropping only one
match in the regular season. Just the same, after a summer
of little match play, Barnes takes this coveted designation
with a sigh of relief.
"Being seeded took a little bit of the pressure off,"
Barnes said. "There are some great players who aren't seed
ed. [especially freshmen], but it just keeps you away from
the very best players fora couple of the first rounds."
It's no small feat to weather the ever-changing ranking
winds, but Barnes has never fallen below No. 21 in her blos
soming career. In light of her accomplishments, Barnes ap
proaches the first tournament of the season unfazed by her
lapse in competitive play this summer.
"To be honest, I felt kind of mentally drained after last
season," Barnes said. "So I trained [this summer] but I
didn't really play. [Now] I feel that I'm probably not playing
my best tennis as of yet, but we're working on it, so the form
should be good."
And sometimes, a first tournament is just that, a first.
Drawing 22 of the 25 top players in the preseason rankings,
the Ail-American gives its entrants a taste of challenging
non-league competition lacking from the regular season.
Consider it a mere October offering of talent that has yet to
train and will flourish by the end of next March, when the
stakes are higher.
Knowing that this year's team has yet to make its mark
in the competitive sphere, Stanford head coach Lele
Forood is content sending newbie Deason off to the quali
fying round of All-American while freshman Leila Hodzic
remains on the Farm.
"Right now, it's hard to tell where anyone will be in the
lineup," Forood said. "I need the All-American results. Re
gional, and maybe even the Indoor tournament to start to
get an idea of where everyone will end up."
Barnes added, "We always worry [in the fall] about how
the new recruits are settling in. Whitney and Leila look
eager, happy, and I couldn't be more excited about having
them on the team. They're excellent players."
That said, the All-American has the Cardinal looking to
improve on their mixed results of last fall. Barnes hopes to
survive the Round of 16, where she fell unceremoniously to
Tennessee's Tammy Encina in straight sets, 7-6 (4), 6-1.
No. 26 Logar hopes to make it out of the starting quali
fying gate, where novice jitters got the best of her in a 6-0,6-
3 shutout by Arizona's No. 7 Dianne Hollands.
No. 71 Yelsey, too, has a year of experience to help her
improve upon last October's prequalifying round loss. Her
three-set battle defeat at the hands of UCLA's Laura Gor
don, and lost 6-3,4-6,6-3, barely registered as a blip on the
radar.
Qualifying match play continues today, and the main
draw action begins Wednesday.
