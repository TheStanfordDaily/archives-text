Minimum requirements fora Stanford field hockey
player: one field hockey stick, a pair of shin guards and
eight heavy-duty Energizer batteries. Reason: 70 min
utes of play just doesn't seem to satisfy the Stanford
field hockey women; they just keep playing and playing
and playing.
In their third overtime game in four games, the Car
dinal (6-8, 0-4 Northern Pacific Athletic Conference)
sneaked past the St. Louis Billikens (2-5) with a score of
3-2 in double overtime. The Cardinal finished their
three-game road trip to Missouri with one win and two
losses after their victory Monday afternoon at the An
heuser-Busch Center.
Coming into the match with a four-game losing
streak, including back-to-back losses against the South
west Missouri State Bears, the Cardinal were desperate
to get back on track. They found their remedy in the
sliding St. Louis Billikens who have lost five of their last
six games. After two road games in which most of the
shots and penalty corners were going to the other team,
Stanford outshot the Billikens 11-6 and held a 9-6 ad
vantage in penalty corners.
SLU jumped out to an early lead as walk-on fresh
man forward Catherine Donovan scored in the third
minute of the game. She was assisted by senior forward
Marissa Lynn, who leads the NorPac in assists.

After that, the flow of play was in the Cardinal's
favor for most of the first half, and the Stanford pres
sure finally paid off as freshman forward Jessica Zutz
punched in a goal off an assist from sophomore Aska
Sturdevan with less than four minutes left in the half.
Stanford came out of the locker room strong, scoring
in the fifth minute of the second period. Sturdevan
found Zutz again off a penalty corner to give the Cardi
nal a 2-1 lead.
Zutz, in her first year with the team, is proving to be
a valuable offensive weapon. She led the team in shots
in the first game against Southwest Missouri State and
had her first multi-goal game of her career against the
Billikens.
Holding a slim 2-1 lead going into the last ten min
utes of the game, the Cardinal decided a Stanford field
hockey game just wouldn't be a Stanford field hockey
game without at least one overtime period. SLU evened
the score with Lynn's first goal of the season off a penal
ty corner, with assists coming from junior Jamie Sme
land and sophomore Michelle Sinclair.
The Cardinal found themselves in familiar territory
in the first overtime, and battled with the Billikens
through the first period without score. Both teams
earned two penalty corners, but neither converted.
In the second overtime period. Stanford capitalized
on a break-away, as sophomore forward Liz Robinson
scored on an assist from Zutz.

"Going into the second overtime, we knew we had
played a great game and just realized we needed to fin
ish it out because we deserved to win," said Robinson.

"It was great to finally score in overtime. Having played
so many overtime games will motivate us to play an in
tense seventy minutes in the games to come so we don't
have to go to overtime to win."
Zutz and Robinson provided almost all of the offen
sive firepower in the game, further underscoring the
promise and talent of the young Stanford team. Zutz, a
freshman from Wilmington, Delaware, was a first team
Ail-American and has made an immediate impact with
the Cardinal. She leads the team with five goals, two of
which came in the matchup against SLU.
Robinson, a sophomore from Alton, Illinois, has
drawn praise from the coaching staff for honing her
abilities in the offseason. She is tied for second on the
team with four goals.
Having ended their season-long losing streak, the
Cardinal will face off with Boston College at neutral site
Berkeley on Oct. 10. The team returns to conference
play with a match-up against Pacific on Oct. 23. The
Cardinal can breathe a little easier going into their up
coming games with this win under their belts.
"This win gives us great confidence," said head
coach Lesley Irvine. "We dominated the game, and I
was just thrilled for the girls that we could come out
with a win."
