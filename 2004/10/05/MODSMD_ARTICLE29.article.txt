# Soto Tape Chronicles
## True champs rise up while the would-bes choke 
### 
A champion is not measured by trophies
or accolades. It is measured by heart,
toughness and perseverance in the face
of adversity. The San Francisco Giants are not
champions.
They are not the champions of the NL West.
They are not the victors in the Wild Card race.
Saturday's 7-3 collapse at the hands of the Los
Angeles Dodgers took care of destroying those
dreams.

It appeared that maybe things would turn
out well. Needing a three-game sweep of the
Dodgers in LA, the Giants came out throwing
their best couple of pitching performances since

the All-Star break, and had
the Dodgers against the ropes
3-0 in the bottom of the ninth
inning of Game 2.
I wasn't there. I wasn't
even watching. I was in San
Francisco on my dorm's scav
enger hunt, hanging out on
Fisherman's Wharf trying to
avoid being caught by roving
groups of residents. I had

called my friend Peattie min
utes earlier to get the scoring update. Things
were looking good for the City by the Bay.
Ah, but why tease myself and relive those
sweet minutes of bliss before reality came
crashing down. The Giants choked. This
wasn't unexpected choking like Chris Webber
in the 1993 Final Four against UNC, but rather
the type of choking you see coming from a
mile away, like Chris Webber in the NBA
playoffs for the Sacramento Kings.
The Giants succumbed to the same ills that
have been plaguing them all season long: the
bullpen couldn't hold a lead; the defense boot
ed easy grounders that any Little Leaguer
could have handled; they lost all momentum in
an instant, and with it all their October hopes.
The Giants are not the only ones who fell
apart on Saturday. They are not even the
only Bay Area professional baseball team to
succumb to SoCal demons in the final week
of the season.
The Oakland A's could not win two out of
three from the Angels at home in the last se
ries of the season with everything hanging in
the balance. Maybe they were drunk on their
Moneyball success that predicts a late-season
surge to put them ahead of any competition.
Maybe they took the set against the Mariners
for granted. Either way, they faltered down
the stretch and could not win when it counted.
The dominant "Big Three" of Hudson, Zito
and Mulder lost its magic. Billy Beane's signa
ture midseason acquisition — this time it was
Octavio Dotel to bolster the bullpen — back
fired when Dotel allowed the winning run to
score on a single by Garret Anderson.
Again, this was nothing unexpected. The
A's blew 27 of 62 save opportunities this year,
which ... wait, let me say that again and let you
savor the absurdity of it. The A's blew 27 of 62
save opportunities this year. You cannot expect
to win ballgames, let alone a division champi
onship, if you give up three runs in the eighth
when you're holding on to a two-run lead.
Or even better: you can't expect to win when
you give up seven runs in the bottom of the
ninth against your most hated rival when you
need a win to stay alive in the hunt for October.
I guess some good came out of these de
feats. My GPA will certainly appreciate me
not spending all those hours in front of the TV.
I won't have to suffer eliminations like I did
during last year's Game 5 at Oakland, or dur
ing Game 4 in Florida when Pudge Rodriguez
held onto the ball for the final out after collid
ing with J.T. Snow.
And there are lots of championship teams
much closer to home on which I can focus my
sports-watching energies.
Take the men's soccer team, for example.
There weren't too many students at the game
last Friday night against Cal, but those who were
there were treated to a comeback that shows all
that is good and decent in this world of sports.
Stanford men's soccer will warrant its own
column later in the quarter, but for now we can
talk about how they dominated play from the
start against the undefeated Golden Bears. We
can talk about how they bounced back from
two unlucky breaks that resulted in a 0-2 deficit
at halftime. We can talk about how they re
fused to lose, and came out for the second half
playing like they knew victory was within their
grasp.
We can talk about how they never lost com
posure though Cal's defense was stifling. We
can talk about the penalty kick goal with 18
minutes left, and the scramble in front of the
net that resulted in the equalizer with 1:22 on
the clock. We can talk about how this team's
attitude is vastly different from last year's, and
how this tie feels more like a victory but the
players aren't satisfied.
We can talk about filling up Maloney Field
in two weeks when the men return home to
face off against UC-Davis and UCLA.
Professional baseball is finished for the
year in the Bay Area, but I'm over it. Bring on
the Bruins!

I wasn't there. I wasn't
even watching. I was in San
Francisco on my dorm's scav
enger hunt, hanging out on
Fisherman's Wharf trying to
avoid being caught by roving
groups of residents. I had

called my friend Peattie min
utes earlier to get the scoring update. Things
were looking good for the City by the Bay.
Ah, but why tease myself and relive those
sweet minutes of bliss before reality came
crashing down. The Giants choked. This
wasn't unexpected choking like Chris Webber
in the 1993 Final Four against UNC, but rather
the type of choking you see coming from a
mile away, like Chris Webber in the NBA
playoffs for the Sacramento Kings.
The Giants succumbed to the same ills that
have been plaguing them all season long: the
bullpen couldn't hold a lead; the defense boot
ed easy grounders that any Little Leaguer
could have handled; they lost all momentum in
an instant, and with it all their October hopes.
The Giants are not the only ones who fell
apart on Saturday. They are not even the
only Bay Area professional baseball team to
succumb to SoCal demons in the final week
of the season.
The Oakland A's could not win two out of
three from the Angels at home in the last se
ries of the season with everything hanging in
the balance. Maybe they were drunk on their
Moneyball success that predicts a late-season
surge to put them ahead of any competition.
Maybe they took the set against the Mariners
for granted. Either way, they faltered down
the stretch and could not win when it counted.
The dominant "Big Three" of Hudson, Zito
and Mulder lost its magic. Billy Beane's signa
ture midseason acquisition — this time it was
Octavio Dotel to bolster the bullpen — back
fired when Dotel allowed the winning run to
score on a single by Garret Anderson.
Again, this was nothing unexpected. The
A's blew 27 of 62 save opportunities this year,
which ... wait, let me say that again and let you
savor the absurdity of it. The A's blew 27 of 62
save opportunities this year. You cannot expect
to win ballgames, let alone a division champi
onship, if you give up three runs in the eighth
when you're holding on to a two-run lead.
Or even better: you can't expect to win when
you give up seven runs in the bottom of the
ninth against your most hated rival when you
need a win to stay alive in the hunt for October.
I guess some good came out of these de
feats. My GPA will certainly appreciate me
not spending all those hours in front of the TV.
I won't have to suffer eliminations like I did
during last year's Game 5 at Oakland, or dur
ing Game 4 in Florida when Pudge Rodriguez
held onto the ball for the final out after collid
ing with J.T. Snow.
And there are lots of championship teams
much closer to home on which I can focus my
sports-watching energies.
Take the men's soccer team, for example.
There weren't too many students at the game
last Friday night against Cal, but those who were
there were treated to a comeback that shows all
that is good and decent in this world of sports.
Stanford men's soccer will warrant its own
column later in the quarter, but for now we can
talk about how they dominated play from the
start against the undefeated Golden Bears. We
can talk about how they bounced back from
two unlucky breaks that resulted in a 0-2 deficit
at halftime. We can talk about how they re
fused to lose, and came out for the second half
playing like they knew victory was within their
grasp.
We can talk about how they never lost com
posure though Cal's defense was stifling. We
can talk about the penalty kick goal with 18
minutes left, and the scramble in front of the
net that resulted in the equalizer with 1:22 on
the clock. We can talk about how this team's
attitude is vastly different from last year's, and
how this tie feels more like a victory but the
players aren't satisfied.
We can talk about filling up Maloney Field
in two weeks when the men return home to
face off against UC-Davis and UCLA.
Professional baseball is finished for the
year in the Bay Area, but I'm over it. Bring on
the Bruins!

A champion is not measured by trophies
or accolades. It is measured by heart,
toughness and perseverance in the face
of adversity. The San Francisco Giants are not
champions.
They are not the champions of the NL West.
They are not the victors in the Wild Card race.
Saturday's 7-3 collapse at the hands of the Los
Angeles Dodgers took care of destroying those
dreams.

It appeared that maybe things would turn
out well. Needing a three-game sweep of the
Dodgers in LA, the Giants came out throwing
their best couple of pitching performances since

the All-Star break, and had
the Dodgers against the ropes
3-0 in the bottom of the ninth
inning of Game 2.
