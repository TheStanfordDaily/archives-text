# Computer glitch forces 150 students to switch P.O. Boxes
## 
### GERRY SHIH 
Leaning against the counter,
sophomore Preeya Jayakar impa
tiently listened to a Stanford post
office employee while twiddling
quarters with her fingers. She had
waited 25 minutes in line, only to be
told now that her P.O. Box had been
reassigned for the second time in
two weeks. She needed yet another
new key. and that would be found in
Old Union.
With a scowl on her face, Jayakar
stomped out of a packed post office
that reeked of frustration.
She wasn't the only one with a
P.O. Box problem, and she wasn't
the only one frustrated.
According to University Regis
trar Roger Printup, about 900 re
turning students were affected by a
glitch in the University computer
system over the summer. The bug
prevented students from renewing
their old P.O. Boxes at the end of
last year. To compound the prob
lem, a separate computer problem
assigned many returning students
to different boxes and assigned

their old, supposedly unrenewed
and empty boxes to incoming fresh
men. As a result, about 150 return
ing students have now had their
boxes permanently reassigned,
causing headaches for those affect
ed.
"We've been trying to get the
mailboxes of returning students
back to them," said Eduardo
Morales, manager of the P.O. Box
rental office. "Incoming freshmen
will have their boxes taken away,
but we understand how important it
is for students who have been here
for three or four years to keep their
boxes, and we're doing everything
we can."
Despite a postal regulation that
prohibits reassignments of P.O.
Boxes, the post office allowed 750 of
the 900 students originally affected
to reclaim their old boxes, according
to Printup. But on Sept. 28. the post
office decided to halt the reassign
ment of mailboxes.
That left 150 students stuck with
a new mailing address. To compli

cate the issue, many students have
not been able to retrieve their mail
for weeks, as the post office is hold
ing some mail in the midst of the
chaos.
Many of the 750 students — the
lucky majority — affected by the
mix-up. like junior Allison McCar
ty, were only minimally inconve
nienced.
"They changed my lock, so I
went down to Old Union and just
exchanged my key," said McCarty.
"They let me keep the same P.O.
Box, so really it was about as much
trouble for them as it was for me."
Other students weren't as fortu
nate. Senior Wenfei Xie is one of
the 150 who now has to deal with a
permanent address change, and for
her it will take more than an extra
walk to Old Union to straighten
things out.
Addressing information for
credit card billings, magazine sub

scriptions, tuition checks and more
will all have to be changed, Xie said.
Plus, she has not received some ex
pected time-sensitive mail for two
weeks.
According to Printup, his office is
working to prevent future mix-ups.
"Everyone here at the Regis
trar's Office is dreadfully sorry, and
obviously we wish this had not hap
pened." Printup said. "But as for
the future, we will look at the com
puter program like it's never been
looked at before and test it like it's
never been tested before."
But for all the trouble many stu
dents have gone through, the
apologies and promises made on
behalf of the University are scant
consolation.
"I am disappointed and frustrat
ed," Xie said. At this point, she says,
she can only wait and hope.
"It would be nice just to have my
mail."

permanent address change, and for
her it will take more than an extra
walk to Old Union to straighten
things out.
Addressing information for
credit card billings, magazine sub

scriptions, tuition checks and more
will all have to be changed, Xie said.
Plus, she has not received some ex
pected time-sensitive mail for two
weeks.
According to Printup, his office is
working to prevent future mix-ups.
"Everyone here at the Regis
trar's Office is dreadfully sorry, and
obviously we wish this had not hap
pened." Printup said. "But as for
the future, we will look at the com
puter program like it's never been
looked at before and test it like it's
never been tested before."
But for all the trouble many stu
dents have gone through, the
apologies and promises made on
behalf of the University are scant
consolation.
"I am disappointed and frustrat
ed," Xie said. At this point, she says,
she can only wait and hope.
"It would be nice just to have my
mail."
