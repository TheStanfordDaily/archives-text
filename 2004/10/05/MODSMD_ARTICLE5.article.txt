# Campus crime statistics for 2003 show spike in sex offenses
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
According to statistics released by Stanford's
Department of Public Safety last week, reports of
forcible sexual assaults on campus increased
nearly tenfold in 2003, a change largely attrib
uted to last year's "serial groper."
The statistics also show substantial declines in
the number of drug violations and bicycles thefts.
Burglaries and violations of alcohol law held
steady, while robbery, aggravated assault and
arson all remained rare.
All 31 assaults attributed to the groper oc
curred between May 22 and Oct. 30 of 2003. Fol
lowing the Oct. 30 incident, a suspect was de
tained by the police but released because no one
could identify him in a lineup. No incidents have
been reported since then.
In addition, there were six reports of acquain
tance rape and one report of forcible oral copu
lation. There were only four reports of forcible
sexual assault in 2002, but it is not clear whether
the increase reflects more incidents of sexual as
sault or that more women reported the crimes.
Police Chief Laura Wilson told the Stanford
News Service that the Department of Public
Safety has been collaborating with Vaden Health
Center and Residential Education to increase
awareness and comfort with discussion of sexual
assault.
"It's a student's choice if they want to report
it." said Sgt. Tim Hanrahan in an interview with
The Daily. "All we can do is try to create a wel
coming environment for them to come forward."
There were also eight incidents of sexual as

sault reported to University counselors but not
the police, a figure similar to the seven incidents
of that kind from 2002.
Hanrahan also noted, "In the cases of vari
ous forms of sexual assault and rape, it's very
often related to alcohol and over-consumption
of alcohol."
The crime statistics were released in compli
ance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Cam
pus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act,
which was passed in 1998.
Although the number of reported drug viola
tions dropped from 29 to 13 last year, Hanrahan
was hesitant to conclude that there had been an
actual decrease in drug use.
"I don't think it at all mathematically equates
that if reports went down then the actual abuses
went down," he said. "We've gone through a lot
of training with new people, and we just may not
have come across as many cases because of the
hiring process and because of the training
process. We'll see what happens and see if cases
go up."
Bicycle thefts went from 483 in 2002 to 268 last
year, which Hanrahan was quick to credit to in
creased knowledge and prevention.
"As you look over the years, the people most
responsible for the decrease are the students who
have gotten better at locking their bikes, at lock
ing their bikes to something, and getting better
locks," he said.
Hanrahan acknowledged that stolen bicycles
are seldom recovered, but he said that the num
ber of recoveries has been increasing.

"There's been a push in students
getting their hikes registered," he
said. "It's one of the only chances of
getting your hike hack.
"We often catch people leaving
campus on hikes at night, and we
run serial numbers through our
records and we can track down the
owner and call them to make sure
they know where their bikes are.
We can only do that when bikes are
licensed."

In 2003, the Department of Pub
lic Safety made a more concerted ef
fort to reach out to Stanford stu
dents and increase communication.
"We're developing a program
where deputies can adopt a dorm."
Hanrahan said. "They meet the RFs
and the RAs and students, and gen
erally open lines of communication
with students in a very positive
way."
