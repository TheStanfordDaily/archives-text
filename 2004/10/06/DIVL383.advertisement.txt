Provost will sponsor Community Day at Stanford, a university
wide open house for Stanford's neighbors. Community Day
planners are looking for student organizations to participate by
setting up,an exhibit or running a program of interest to our
visitors. Registered student groups that are able to educate,
entertain or involve Stanford's neighbors are encouraged to
apply. Performance groups will be hired separately.
