# 5-SURE service to roll out changes
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
5-SURE, the free, student
staffed campus transportation ser
vice, has delayed starting operations
until Tuesday. The staff is taking
time to implement changes such as
the use of Global Electric Motorcars
rather than golf carts and the even
tual operation of a weekend "party
van."
According to 5-SURE student
manager Lawrence Zieske, a senior,
the changes to the nightly service
should make it broader and more ef
ficient.
"Our purpose is to ensure that
everyone on the Stanford campus
feels safe by offering fast, safe and
reliable rides on campus to men and
women," Zieske said.
Electric motorcars require the
use of seatbelts and can travel up to
25 miles per hour, while golf carts
only reach about 15 miles per hour.
However, vehicle-switch also means
that every 5-SURE driver will need
to be retrained.
"We also need to rescan every
body's drivers licenses to make sure
everyone is an exemplary driver,"
Zieske said.
Many students consider 5-SURE
to be a very useful service, one which
they look forward to having avail
able for the rest of the year.
"I really could've used [5-SURE]
one night," said freshman Jasmine

Aarons about a trip from Wilber
back to her dorm room at Flo Mo.
"We ended up almost off campus. It
was so late and we were so utterly
lost."
According to Zieske, the service
typically is not available until the
second week of school because of
the time needed to hire and train a
full staff, but an extra week of train
ing was necessary this year to intro
duce all new and returning 5-SURE
drivers to the changes.
"We have a very small staff that
returned, and we cannot get early
housing, so we can't get things start
ed early, in the summer," Zieske ex
plained.
5-SURE was interested in mak
ing changes to its program for the
past two years, Zieske said, but only
began to implement such changes,
with the help of the ASSU and its
president, Chioke Borgelt-Mose. at
the end of last year.
"Thanks to Chioke's commit
ment, the longest people will have to
wait this year is 10 minutes," Zieske
said, alluding to the common com
plaint that 5-SURE takes too long to
arrive.
In addition to its nightly services,
5-SURE is working on running a
"party van" on Friday and Saturday
nights. Zieske described the vans as
a "more reliable way to get to parties
than the Marguerite."

One of the major changes 5-SURE is implementing this year is to switch from
traditional golf carts like these to faster electrical motorcars.
