offices by four Palo Alto policemen.
Judge Robert F. Peckham made
the declaratory judgment in a suit
filed by the Daily and several current
and former staff members against

policemen.
In making his decision, he accept
ed the Daily's motion fora summary

without a full trial.
Peckham ruled that the officials
had violated Fourth Amendment
against unreasonable searches and
seizures by failing to establish suffi
cient cause to obtain the search war
rant used in he search.
Police used a search warrant is

Hospital.
At least 37 persons were injured,
and 23 demonstrators were arrested,

Peckham said that 'a search pre

sents an overwhelming threat to the
press's ability to gather and dissemi
nate news.'"

ran a story about an unwelcome in
truder under the headline, "She came
in through the bathroom window."
"A dead, partially skinned opos
sum was tossed through an open
bathroom window at the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest last weekend, ac
cording to Stanford Police.
The animal was removed from
the campus cooperative and inciner
ated, according to Sgt. Del Bandy,
who called the incident "a little grue
some.' Police have no leads in he
case, he added.
EBF House Manager Carl Gold
schmidt said a resident called police
after discovering the dead opossum
near the window late Saturday night.
'The animal was 'about the size of
a small cat,' he said, and was not de
composed. 'It didn't smell too
much.'
This is the second time in less
than a week EBF has been the target
of a crime.
Six UC-Berkeley students were
arrested last Tuesday for allegedly
stealing a vacuum cleaner and fire
extinguisher from EBF as part of
their fraternity's rush."
