# Political gear suddenly in style
## 
### MICHELLE KESSEL U-WIRE (DC BUREAU 
(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON â€”
With less than a month until this
year's heated election, the presiden
tial candidates are not the only ones
making political statements.
Politicians, celebrities and voters
have been spotted sporting apparel
with unique political messages. Pop
ular topics include promoting a fa
vorite presidential candidate or en
couraging people to vote on Nov. 2.
College students say that clothing
with election-related messages re
minds people that it is important to
vote.
"People who wear shirts like this
are saying that it's important to
vote," said Sarah Miller, a senior at
the George Washington University.
"It lets people express their freedom
of speech."
Miller also said that as long as
they are not offensive, wearing
shirts with political messages
helps others feel more comfort
able to vote,
"I saw someone wearing a Kerry
/ Edwards shirt, and it made me feel
more better that there are other
people out there who feel the same
way I do."
Other students said that political
messages on clothing do not affect
them.
"I'm not going to vote because a
T-shirt tells me to," said Katelyn
Taylor, a junior at Assumption Col
lege. "I think it's important to vote
based on what the issues are."

While voters are expressing
themselves, both of the candidates
also have signature fashion.
Since the 1960 election between
Richard Nixon and John Kennedy,
image has become increasingly im
portant. This election had the first
televised debates and some politi
cians and historians say image is one
of the reasons why Nixon lost the
election.
At more formal events, such as
the Thursday's debate, both Presi
dent George W. Bush and his demo
cratic opponent. Senator John
Kerry were dressed in similar cam
paign couture: both wear dark suits,
a red or blue tie and a light colored
shirt.
Both men, however, are also noted
for their characteristic fashion acces
sories. When they are more causal,
critics say that Bush and Kerry both
have very different looks.
Since his Black Tie & Boots inau
gural gala in 2001, President Bush
has been known for wearing cowboy
boots.
The boots are designed by fellow
Texan Rocky Carroll, who has also
designed shoes for the Queen of
England and Oprah Winfrey.
Bush's boots for his inauguration in
cluded the Presidential and Texas
state seals.
Kerry has sparked attention with
his $65 custom-made neckties, de
signed by Vineyard Vines. Designs
on Kerry's ties include: Lacrosse
sticks, hot air balloons, parrots and
palm trees. On the cover of Time
magazine. Kerry wore a custom tie

with "JKO4" and little American
flags on it.
There are T-shirts with messages
that encourage people to vote, or to
support or oppose a candidate.
Sales associates at Washington's
Urban Outfitters, a popular retailer
among college students, said that
the shirts the election-related shirts
they sell are popular.
Shirt slogans there include: "I dig
girls that vote," "I dig boys that
vote," "Vote John," with a picture
of John Adams on the shirt and
"Vote George," with a picture of
George Washington on the shirt.
Other T-shirt slogans found
around the Internet include: "Luvya
Dubya," "Re-defeat Bush," "John
Kerry: Bringing complete sentences
back to the White House" and
"Vote Bush. Jesus Would."
While the retail shops and the In
ternet are full of t-shirts to buy,
other types of accessories are also
promoting candidates.
Remember HBO's "Sex and the
City"? Carrie Bradshaw was famous
for her gold name necklace. On
www.carrieforkerry.com, one can
purchase a replica necklace replac
ing "Carrie" for "Kerry." The neck
lace costs $20, with 25 percent of the
profits going to Move On, a political
action committee working to beat
Bush.
Anti-Kerry activists are making
use of Kerry's "flip flopping" repu
tation. Different styles of flip-flops
are being sold on www.johnker
ryflipflops.com, for around $15 to
$19 per pair.
