# Your features column here

Way back in middle school, hav
ing opinions was considered "un
cool." You may remember this be
cause there's a decent chance that
you, too, were considered "uncool,"
perhaps because you held such opin
ions. Or because your pants were
above your navel and you regularly
set off metal detectors with your ex
tensive orthodontal apparati.
Good news, nerds: Those days
are gone. These days, at Stanford U,
it's defnitely considred cool to have
opnions, and it's "Ã¼ber-cool" to
share them.
You can score lots of non-dates
with all the moderately attractive
objects of your desire by sharing
your random musings on such varied

topics as dating at Stanford, eating at
Stanford, what it's like to actually
iive in a frat. what it's like to actually
be a nerd, or why Dubya had that
constipated look on his face
throughput the debate last Thurs
day. All you need is a face (for the
mugshot). And a good theme that
will carry you 10-12 columns, from
now through January.
Just submit two sample columns
(500-600 words each) and 10 story
ideas by e-mail to
opinions@daily.Stanford .edu or in a
sealed envelope to The Daily's of
fices at the Storke Publications
Building by this Friday, October Bth.
There's hope that you, too, can be
cool. Write features columns!
