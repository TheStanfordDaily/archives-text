# Golf carts in high demand, often stolen
## 
### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While some may think that their
walk to class from Mirrielees is far,
consider how long and strenuous it
would be to wheel yourself uphill
from West Lag to the Quad every
day. This is the daunting task that se
nior T.G. Falcon faced when he ar
rived on campus his freshman year.
"When I came to campus, 1 was
the only person with a manual
wheelchair," Falcon said.
Falcon was living in Adelfa,
which, as he noted, is downhill from
the center of campus. He therefore
had to deal with a tiring hill every
day as he went to class. Since the
state of California would not provide
him with an electric chair, the Finan
cial Aid Office helped him acquire
the funds to get a golf cart,s which he
has used ever since.
Falcon recalled how at the begin
ning of his freshman year, he was
constantly tired from getting around
in his wheelchair.
"Having a golf cart has really
been a savior to me," he said. "It's re
ally made a big difference."
Unless absolutely necessary, such
as when going to classes in the inner
Quad. Falcon avoids sidewalks and
sticks to the roads to get around
campus. However, even this leads to
some difficulties.
He recalled once time in the
Quad when a biker who wasn't pay
ing attention hit his stationary cart
and flipped over the cart.
Falcon has also had problems
with theft. Over the past three
years, his golf cart has been stolen
lour times. Once, he found it just
half a block away at another dorm.
Other times, the damage has been
more serious.
"One time, some people who
were drunk took it and drove it into
the lake, which led to very expensive
repairs," Falcon said. "I know that
people think that they're like toys,
but when it's stolen, 1 can't get
around campus."
Golf cart theft has made life diffi
cult for other students as well, and is
taken seriously by Stanford Police
Department. During the last aca
demic year, 36 golf carts were re
ported stolen. In 2002-03, 20 were
stolen and in the previous year, 33
were stolen.
To prevent theft. Deputy Ken
Bates recommended securing carts
with a chain and padlock, or a club,
similar to the one made for car steer
ing wheels.
While stealing a golf cart may

seem like a harmless act. Bates notes
that a lot of people depend on their
golf carts to get around campus.
"If someone's out to pull a cart,
they should think about someone
who possibly has a mobile impair
ment," Bates said. "It could be their
sole mode of transportation."
Bates emphasizes that under Cal
ifornia vehicle codes, golf carts are
considered to be cars, and their
drivers are subject to all traffic laws.
"Yes, you can be arrested fora
DUI while driving a golf cart," Bates
said. "Stealing a golf cart has the
same ramifications as stealing a car."
Larry Gibbs, associate vice
provost for environmental and
health safety, notes that golf carts
can only be used by university de
partments for valid business purpos
es and students with disabilities, and
must be registered through the Uni
versity garage.
"Student use of golf carts for per
sonal transportation, other than for
disability need or 5-SURE Escort
Services, is prohibited on campus,"
Gibbs said.
According to Susan Burk, assis
tant athletic director for student ser
vices, injured student-athletes can go
to Turf Industrial Equipment Com
pany in Santa Clara to get a golf cart

delivered to campus. Students then
pay for the carts themselves and are
later reimbursed by NCAA funds if
they submit medical documentation.
There is also a service called
Disgo Cart available to anyone in the
Stanford Community if they need to
arrange a ride to get around campus.
Teri Adams, assistant director at the
Office of Accessible Education, de
scribed Disgo as a necessary student
run service and added that it is fund
ed by the Parking and Transporta
tion Department.
"Disgo Cart Service fills a gap
that the Marguerite can't quite fill,"
Adams said. "Because the campus is
so spread out, someone with a mod
erate mobility problem or with a
temporary disability can find it hard
to get from a Marguerite stop to their
class or dorm."
"Our riders range from students
with permanent disabilities who
need mobility assistance, to stu
dents who've broken their leg skiing
over Winter Break," Adams added.
"We also provide rides to staff and
faculty."
According to Regina Aiello, a
service technician at the University
garage, there is currently no exact
count on the number of golf carts on
campus. She estimates the number

to be in the hundreds because many
departments are purchasing more
and more of them.
The Stanford Police Department
has two electric golf carts and ac
cording to Bates, it utilizes a small
fleet during football games.
"It's a lot easier to get through a
crowd in a golf cart than in a full-size
patrol car," Bates said.
Imogen Hinds, the manager of
Undergraduate Housing Opera
tions, notes that the 25-to-30 golf
carts the department owns are very
useful.
"Many student housing staff has
to cover a wide area of Housing in
their duties." Hinds said. "Walking is
not always an option. Golf carts are
less expensive to purchase than cars,
easier to operate and maintain than
gas powered vehicles, and they are
more environmentally friendly than
cars."
According to Brodie Hamilton,
Director of Parking and Transporta
tion Services, the University is work
ing on creating a preferred route
map to distribute to help people
avoid complications near the fre
quently trafficked areas around
campus. They are also looking at es
tablishing formal parking areas and
charging stations for golf carts.

campus. However, even this leads to
some difficulties.
He recalled once time in the
Quad when a biker who wasn't pay
ing attention hit his stationary cart
and flipped over the cart.
Falcon has also had problems
with theft. Over the past three
years, his golf cart has been stolen
lour times. Once, he found it just
half a block away at another dorm.
Other times, the damage has been
more serious.
"One time, some people who
were drunk took it and drove it into
the lake, which led to very expensive
repairs," Falcon said. "I know that
people think that they're like toys,
but when it's stolen, 1 can't get
around campus."
Golf cart theft has made life diffi
cult for other students as well, and is
taken seriously by Stanford Police
Department. During the last aca
demic year, 36 golf carts were re
ported stolen. In 2002-03, 20 were
stolen and in the previous year, 33
were stolen.
To prevent theft. Deputy Ken
Bates recommended securing carts
with a chain and padlock, or a club,
similar to the one made for car steer
ing wheels.
While stealing a golf cart may

seem like a harmless act. Bates notes
that a lot of people depend on their
golf carts to get around campus.
"If someone's out to pull a cart,
they should think about someone
who possibly has a mobile impair
ment," Bates said. "It could be their
sole mode of transportation."
Bates emphasizes that under Cal
ifornia vehicle codes, golf carts are
considered to be cars, and their
drivers are subject to all traffic laws.
"Yes, you can be arrested fora
DUI while driving a golf cart," Bates
said. "Stealing a golf cart has the
same ramifications as stealing a car."
Larry Gibbs, associate vice
provost for environmental and
health safety, notes that golf carts
can only be used by university de
partments for valid business purpos
es and students with disabilities, and
must be registered through the Uni
versity garage.
"Student use of golf carts for per
sonal transportation, other than for
disability need or 5-SURE Escort
Services, is prohibited on campus,"
Gibbs said.
According to Susan Burk, assis
tant athletic director for student ser
vices, injured student-athletes can go
to Turf Industrial Equipment Com
pany in Santa Clara to get a golf cart

delivered to campus. Students then
pay for the carts themselves and are
later reimbursed by NCAA funds if
they submit medical documentation.
There is also a service called
Disgo Cart available to anyone in the
Stanford Community if they need to
arrange a ride to get around campus.
Teri Adams, assistant director at the
Office of Accessible Education, de
scribed Disgo as a necessary student
run service and added that it is fund
ed by the Parking and Transporta
tion Department.
"Disgo Cart Service fills a gap
that the Marguerite can't quite fill,"
Adams said. "Because the campus is
so spread out, someone with a mod
erate mobility problem or with a
temporary disability can find it hard
to get from a Marguerite stop to their
class or dorm."
"Our riders range from students
with permanent disabilities who
need mobility assistance, to stu
dents who've broken their leg skiing
over Winter Break," Adams added.
"We also provide rides to staff and
faculty."
According to Regina Aiello, a
service technician at the University
garage, there is currently no exact
count on the number of golf carts on
campus. She estimates the number

to be in the hundreds because many
departments are purchasing more
and more of them.
The Stanford Police Department
has two electric golf carts and ac
cording to Bates, it utilizes a small
fleet during football games.
"It's a lot easier to get through a
crowd in a golf cart than in a full-size
patrol car," Bates said.
Imogen Hinds, the manager of
Undergraduate Housing Opera
tions, notes that the 25-to-30 golf
carts the department owns are very
useful.
"Many student housing staff has
to cover a wide area of Housing in
their duties." Hinds said. "Walking is
not always an option. Golf carts are
less expensive to purchase than cars,
easier to operate and maintain than
gas powered vehicles, and they are
more environmentally friendly than
cars."
According to Brodie Hamilton,
Director of Parking and Transporta
tion Services, the University is work
ing on creating a preferred route
map to distribute to help people
avoid complications near the fre
quently trafficked areas around
campus. They are also looking at es
tablishing formal parking areas and
charging stations for golf carts.

The cluster of lines in the center of campus marks areas that are off-limits to cars but can be reached via golf
carts. Over the past three years, 89 golf carts have been reported stolen.
While some may think that their
walk to class from Mirrielees is far,
consider how long and strenuous it
would be to wheel yourself uphill
from West Lag to the Quad every
day. This is the daunting task that se
nior T.G. Falcon faced when he ar
rived on campus his freshman year.
"When I came to campus, 1 was
the only person with a manual
wheelchair," Falcon said.
Falcon was living in Adelfa,
which, as he noted, is downhill from
the center of campus. He therefore
had to deal with a tiring hill every
day as he went to class. Since the
state of California would not provide
him with an electric chair, the Finan
cial Aid Office helped him acquire
the funds to get a golf cart,s which he
has used ever since.
Falcon recalled how at the begin
ning of his freshman year, he was
constantly tired from getting around
in his wheelchair.
"Having a golf cart has really
been a savior to me," he said. "It's re
ally made a big difference."
Unless absolutely necessary, such
as when going to classes in the inner
Quad. Falcon avoids sidewalks and
sticks to the roads to get around
campus. However, even this leads to
some difficulties.
