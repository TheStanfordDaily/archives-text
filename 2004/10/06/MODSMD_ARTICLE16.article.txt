# Furry, but forbidden...
## Students house pets on campus 
### MELANIE CORBETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When a certain student, who
asked to remain anonymous, found
a kitten taped up in a box near a
dumpster, she didn't worry about
the Stanford University policy for
bidding pets on campus — she won
dered who could abandon such a
helpless creature.
"I fell in love with the animal,"
she recalled, and explained that the
cat still lives with her on campus, un
beknownst to Student Housing Ser
vices.
The Housing Policies and Ser
vices manual states, "the keeping of
pets of any kind — including fish
and caged animals — in or about
University residences is prohibited
to students."
It continues with the warning that
"residents who are found to have a
pet will be charged $100 upon dis
covery and $100 per day until it is
permanently removed."
Not all University rules are
obeyed by students, though, and the
policy on pets is no exception.
One undergraduate who asked to
remain anonymous has lived with
her Yorkshire Terrier for two years.
"She is trained to be completely
quiet whenever she is in my purse,"
she said.
She takes the well-behaved dog

with her to class every day.and
even the most stoic members of
academia have softened at the
sight of the petite creature peering
out from her bag.
"One professor saw her and loved
her. She laughed her head off."
Despite the chance of being
caught, this owner has no doubts
that keeping her pet on campus is
worth the risk.
"Having a dog is a cure in so
many ways," she said. "It affects not
just mood and basic feelings, but it
creates a reality and sense of home
in the midst of classes and work."
Not all pet situations are as ideal.
The difficult circumstances faced by
one student have forced her to seek
an alternate home for her feline.
"It is a young baby, and waking
up at 5 a.m. doesn't really work for
me," she said. "I love the kitten,
though, and my care for him has
motivated me to keep him as long
as I have."
The practice of keeping animals
on campus is not a new occurrence.
Many graduates recall their college
pets with affection
"During the fall of 2001, Terra
had sixty residents, including one
hamster, two marsupials, three
guinea pigs and two baby chickens."
said former Terra resident Lexi Sup
pes. "No one in Terra was ever
caught for having pets on campus

[that year], most likely because the
pet owners comprised half of the
house staff."
Phil Sayegh attributes his suc
cessful two-year-long maintenance
of two guinea pigs in Terra to the na
ture of a co-op.
"It was unlikely for anyone, [such
as| a staff member or an RF, to com
plain or report us," he said.
Imogen Hinds, manager of Un
dergraduate Housing Operations,
affirmed that students with pets
are not often discovered by the
University.
"1 would say this is a fairly infre
quent occurrence," she said.
This is not to say that it never
happens, though. Dogs, cats, ro
dents. snakes and fish have all been
discovered on campus before sepa
rating from their owners.
"Residents typically will remove
the pet on their own," Hinds said. "If
the pet is abandoned, we would con
tact the appropriate service for re
moval of the animal."
Whether they remain with their
student owners until graduation or
enjoy only a brief stay, pets can
bring happiness and humor to the
rigorous lives of Stanford students.
"When you're up at 4 a.m. trying
to write a paper and your chickens
have just shat on your copy of 'Being
and Time," you can't take yourself
that seriously," Suppes said.
