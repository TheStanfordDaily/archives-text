## Editorial School wisely limits legal liability 
### 
With an increasing number of college stu
dents across the nation being sued by the
Recording Industry Association of
America, downloading music has be
come a risky business for individual Stanford users.
And because of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the
199K Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Univer
sity could also be held responsible for files that are il
legally shared on its network.
To protect itself from incurring such fines, the
University has implemented a three-strikes policy
regarding the unauthorized downloading of copy
righted materials. This is a sound and realistic ap
proach to controlling illegal network activity, and
it is good that Stanford is working to meet the
needs of its users while also protecting itself from
the potential financial liabilities posed by such
downloading.
The University could be forced to pay fines of up
to $ 150,000 for every file that is illegally download
ed on its network. With the risk of such high penal
ties, it is clear that Stanford cannot afford to be too
lax with its users. But it is certainly possible to limit
liability in a flexible and non-draconian manner, and
it is encouraging that the University has fashioned
just such a response.
A student who is caught illegally downloading for
the first time is sent a letter telling him that he must
stop the activity and remove any offending files. On
the second offense, the user's Internet is temporarily
disabled and the residence dean of the student's dorm
is notified. And in the event of a third incident, the
University terminates the user's SUNet II) account
to prevent him or her from using University comput
ers to share illegal files.
Although this third strike does severely inconve
nience students, as they can then no longer register

for classes, enroll in Course Work or use Webmail.
the policy is fair and appropriate. In fact, it is remark
able that Stanford's approach is forgiving enough to
allow students to reach a third strike, given the po
tential risk for the University.
Students who illegally share files are not only
bringing the potential of unfavorable legal and finan
cial consequences upon themselves - copyright law
suits can be time-consuming and expensive to settle -
but their recklessness could also incur a large penalty
for the University.
After one strike, violating students should have
the sense to stop, if for no other reason than that
the University will closely monitor their subse
quent activity. And after a second strike, there's
little excuse fora third. So while the third-strike
penalty might be harsh, it is appropriate given the
circumstances.
However, while Stanford's policy itself is satis
factory, the University could improve its efforts to
educate and inform students about the realites of il
legal file sharing. Many students are still unaware of
the potential consequences for both themselves and
Stanford that could result from such online activity.
If more students knew about the three-strikes poli
cy, it is likely that they would give more thought to
whether or not the files they were illegally down
loading were worth the risk.
The University can be and will be held liable in
these cases if it does not take measures to prevent
students from using its servers to share files. The
University is doing what it can to protect itself and
students from being sued by the recording industry,
and we appreciate its efforts. They represent both
their understanding of the severity of the situation
and also its sensitivity toward the needs of Stanford
students.
