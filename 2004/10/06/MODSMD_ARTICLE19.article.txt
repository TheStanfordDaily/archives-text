## 5-SURE should start right away 
### 
Due to stall training, 5-SURE, Stanford's
free nighttime escort service, will not be op
erating until the third week of this school
year. But Stanford needs 5-SURE during
the first weeks of the quarter to serve new students
who have trouble finding their way around campus in
the dark and possibly under the influence of alcohol. 5-
SURE should invest money to train staff and handle
logistics in order to provide the service to students at
the start of next year.
5-SURE officers have attributed the delayed start
to the need to train personnel to operate the new elec
tric Think! Carts and party vans. However, that is no
excuse for closing 5-SURE. Many established campus
groups already require an early return for their mem
bers so they can prepare for the upcoming year. Train
ing should have taken place before the school year

began, and housing should be made available to ac
commodate 5-SURE's needs. While this would cost
money, 5-SURE is a necessary component of Stan
ford's safety network. Asking past drivers to report to
campus early would allow 5-SURE to operate during
the first weeks of school.
Officers also claim that it is difficult to get staff to
commit to a definite driving schedule because they are
shopping for classes. However, 5-SURE has pushed
back its operational hours from dusk to 9 p.m. Because
few classes meet at that time, class scheduling is not a
valid excuse
5-SURE provides an invaluable service to the
Stanford community. 5-SURE will gain the apprecia
tion and trust of new and old students by making
preparations to provide, this service at the start of
next year.
