The National Association for
College Admission Counseling, an
organization of professionals that in
cludes primary school counselors
and college admissions officers, at its
annual conference last weekend of
ficially voted to allow its member
colleges to adopt "single-choice
early action" policies.
The admission policy, which is
non-hinding, has already been
adopted at some top-tier colleges
and universities, including Stanford.
Last weekend's vote "eased re
cent tensions between [the associa
tion] and the three high-profile insti
tutions that had been in violation of
the association's previous guide
lines," according to the Chronicle of
Higher Education.
Harvard's dean of admissions
and financial aid told the Chronicle
that the university would have con
sidered leaving the association if its
admissions guidelines had not
changed.

According to Stanford's admis
sions department Web site, "The
Stanford Early Action option is de
signed to honor the original intent
and spirit of early admission pro
grams —to serve those students
who have clearly identified a first
choice school."
The current Stanford policy al
lows students to learn about their ad
mission decision in December in
stead of April, but they do not have
to commit to attending Stanford be
fore hearing from other schools they
applied to under the regular admis
sion timeframe.
However, they may not apply to
any other school early.
This year's freshman class was
the first at Stanford to be affected by
the early action policy. Prior to last
year, the University used a binding
"early decision" policy, which had
been criticized at many schools na
tionwide as being overly restrictive.
After the policy change, Stanford
received 62 percent more early ap
plications last year, as reported in
The Daily on Nov. 14 of last year.
