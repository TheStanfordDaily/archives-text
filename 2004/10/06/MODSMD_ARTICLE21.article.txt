## Get units for activities outside of the classroom 
### 
Announcement: There are six
shopping days until the study list
deadline. And even though this
shopping season probably won't
involve any of the Christmas time
fistfights or stampedes over the
last 12 Tickle-Me-Elmos at FAO
Schwartz, we still have to face the
dreaded unit count at the end the
week.
PA As, HPACs and academic
advisors everywhere try to make us
think that it is easy to put together
a study list with 12 to 20 units that
fulfills major requirements, knocks
out a GER or two, and — if we're
lucky — doesn't include any class
es before noon.
But based on the conversations
that I have had with people since
last Monday, it seems as if these
pesky units are eluding the masses
this fall quarter.
I.for one, had the perfect sched
ule planned with two days off a
week. No more than one class a
day and no classes in the morning.
That was until my friend, the
new Axess, reminded me that I was
only signed up for 10 units.
And so, while 1 was dragging
myself back to the course catalog
for more shopping (not the fun
kind that results in a pair of booty
hugging jeans for half price off the
Macy's double sale rack), I real
ized that this would never be a
problem if the Registrar's Office
would recognize that we all have
lives outside of the lecture hall or
seminar room and in turn award us
units accordingly.
The most obvious example of
this would be to assign units to
University-based activities. If
Stanford claims the right to adver
tise its abundance of student
groups and organizations, why not
put its money where its mouth is
and fork over those precious units
for anyone on a dance team or a
part of a life-consuming produc
tion like Gaieties?
Similarly, anyone who works
for the University should also get
compensated with a unit or two for
the quarter. As an RA, I'm sure
that the school would not be able
to function if everyone were per
manently locked out of their
rooms, so there should be an
agreement whereby every R A gets
a unit of credit towards graduation
for every dozen or so doors un
locked.
This may sound ridiculous, but
if my friends can take EDGE three

times in four years and still get
units for that, then what is stopping
me from trying to claim units for
sifting through hundreds of cam
pus e-mails a day under the pretext
of teaching myself how to be tech
no-savvy?
Its not like I am asking for Roger
Printup to give me three units for

my weekly ap
pearances at Se
nior Pub Night,
five units for the
hours that 1
spend at Moon
beans rehashing
the week's gossip
with my girl
friends and four
units for hosting
weekly viewings

of The Real World / Laguna Beach
hour in my room fora class-free
total of the minimum 12 units. But is
it too much to ask for two units in
exchange for all of this necessary so
cializing?
It just makes sense that if each
unit is supposed to represent three
hours of work outside of the class
room, then many non-classroom
activities that take up a certain
number of hours a week should
generate default units.
For example, my roommate has
a boyfriend who lives in New
Hampshire, and while she is not
burdened with the fabled five-unit,
on-campus significant other that
takes up more time than I-Hum
reading and sections combined,
she spends on average 15 hours a
week engaged in boyfriend-related
activities that include text-messag
ing, e-mailing, calling and the ever
-so-time-consuming kissing of pic
tures. Why should she not get five
units to add on to her pre-existing
13?
That said, taking a look at my
own life this quarter, 1 should be
able to add 10 units for University
-based extracurricular activities,
five units for socializing, five units
of home economic units for living
in Mirrielees, three units for time
wasted standing in line at the post
office and two units fielding calls
from home, fora total of 40 units
including my academic classes.
So much for senioritis.
