Electoral College favors small
states at others' expense
For over 200 years, the Electoral
College was America's political
equivalent of the old Imperial sys
tem of measurement. It was a quirky
animal, hut it seemed to work, so re
form efforts never got off the
ground. After the debacle of 2(XX).
however, Americans, like Bill
Whalen. need to face reality. The
Electoral College is unfair, in
equitable, and unjust.
Whalen's defense of the Electoral
College ("Keep Electoral College,"
Oct. 4) stems from the arbitrary value
he places on breadth of political sup
port. but he never acknowledges that

this comes at the expense of equity.
As a California voter, my vote for
president counts for less than that of
every other state's residents. In what
political universe is this just?
Whalen also portrays the Elec
toral College as a sort of insurance
policy for small states. He must also,
then, object to the oppressive pro
portionality of the House of Repre
sentatives. Why do small states need
even more protection when they al
ready have an equal playing field in
the Senate? In fact, I would ask
Whalen if he thinks we stack the
cards in favor of small states enough.
Why not add another 5,10 or 20 elec
toral votes to every state? This would
certainly "protect" the interests of

states without people even more.
The president does not derive au
thority from deliberations among
municipalities, counties or states.
He is accountable to the people. So
let's stop pretending that it's fair to
staple, essentially, a little extra
weight to certain people's ballots
and just count everyone equally.

The electoral college benefits the
states with close presidential races
Bill Whalen argues that abolishing
the Electoral College would result in
less power for voters in small states

("Keep Electoral College," Oct. 4).
The 10 least populous states ac
cording to the 2000 Census are
Wyoming, the District of Columbia,
Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Delaware, Montana.
Rhode Island and Hawaii. 1 don't
think it's possiblefor these states to
receive less attention from presiden
tial candidates than they have in
2004. The reason these states have
been ignored has nothing to do with
their size; the real reason is that
none of these state races are close.
The real effect of the Electoral Col
lege is that presidential candidates
focus on a handful of states where
changing a few minds may result in a
sizable swing of electoral votes.

As Whalen himself writes, "It is a
national election, not a regional
choice." Presidential candidates
should not be rewarded for com
pletely ignoring most of the country
in order to focus on voters in a few
swing states. Give all voters an equal
say: Abolish the Electoral College.
