## Encourage public service by reducing student debt 
### CORENE KENDKICK 
I read the Recent Stanford Daily
article on the dilemma facing debt
burdened law students with great in
terest, as I am a recent graduate who
chose a low-paying public interest
legal job, despite a crushing debt of
more than $100,000 in loans.
1 was troubled to see that one
anonymous first-year law student
told the reporter that corporate jobs
are "more socially acceptable" at
Stanford than taking government or
public service jobs. I think that cor
porate jobs are easier to get, but so
cial acceptability has nothing to do
with it.
I hope that she is not implying
that non-corporate jobs are viewed
as unacceptable by the student body.
If true, then things have changed for
the worse at Stanford Law since 1
was there.
This student also was quoted as
saying she'd have a "better life" at a
corporate job - but at what price?
Sure, she'll make $150,000 a year,
but she'll work every Saturday and
most Sundays, have 80-hour work
weeks, spend her first two years in
the drudgery of document reviews,
all to help one corporation sue or
take over another corporation? De
pends on how you define a better
life, I suppose.

So besides having little dispos
able income, what would a law
school graduate be doing in a social
ly "unacceptable" public interest
position?
Well, since graduating from Stan
ford Law School last year, I have
worked in Tennessee and Mississip
pi helping abused and neglected chil
dren in a dysfunctional foster care
system, and ironically enough, the
day this article appeared, I was in
northern Mississippi, up at 5 a.m. for
a meeting with one of my clients, a
17-year-old who has been in foster
care since he was 4 years old.
I was able to successfully advo
cate on his behalf that he be moved
from a lock-down institution for ju
venile delinquents (he wasn't a
delinquent, they just don't have
enough foster homes) and a manda
tory GED program, into a well-re
spected small group home and a top
public high school where he's on the
football team and choir, and he is
planning on attending a four-year
college.
As I stood at the door of his new
high school, my client hugged me
and thanked me for being one of the
few adults who care about him, and
for giving him a chance to strive fora
future. It's at times like that, or when
I sat in a falling-down house in rural
Jones County, Miss., talking to an el

derly woman with a second-grade
education trying to care for her four
mentally challenged grandchildren
on less than $250 a month, that I
wonder, "What are my classmates at
law firms doing right at this very in
stant?"
1 realize that perhaps working at a
corporate firm would ensure that I'd
be able to afford a new car - or even
the security of being able to pay for
repairs to my used car - and any of
the other accoutrements of the six
figured-salary, but material goods
would never amount to anything
compared to seeing the broad smile
on my young client's face as he told
me of his plans to one day go to col
lege. That is why I went to law school
and got into all that crazy debt, 1
thought to myself, as I watched my
client walk off to greet his new
friends and enter the school building
But to each her own. The reason
why one chose in the first place to
go to law school and get into debt,
and the choice of future career -
these are individual decisions, and
I will not second-guess the choices
of others.
Yet I can't help but think that
perhaps more law students and grad
uates would be willing to go into
public interest work and have an op
portunity to experience these type of
humanizing legal encounters if they

were in less law school debt in the
first place.
While Stanford Law School's
Loan Repayment Assistance Pro
gram helps pay the need-based por
tions of school debt (it does not pay
all debts, as Associate Dean Frank
Brucato was quoted as saying in the
article), it is still very psychologically
intimidating to make the leap to a
low-paying job and to have tens or
hundreds of thousands of dollars in
debt looming.
I hope that all present and for
mer law students who would like to
one day work in the nonprofit legal
world or in government would
press the law school to not only
continue to improve the LRAP
system, but also to increase the
amount of non-loan-based finan
cial assistance to law students.
And I hope that more of the
alumni who often give money to
build (and to get their names on)
new buildings will reflect on how
their money could create the great
est possible good, and instead con
sider directing their donations to
increase LRAP as well as grants
and scholarships for law students.
