## Men kick off first of national tournaments 
### KAIYA REEVE STAFF WRITER 
With only a few days of practice under their
belts, the men of the Stanford tennis team will jump
into the competitive fray at the 2004 Icy Hot / ITA
Men's All-American Championships in Chat
tanooga, Tenn. this upcoming week.
This will be the first of three national champi
onship tournaments held during the 2004-05 season.
Historically the largest collegiate tournament in the
nation, this will be Stanford's first chance to see
what new players the team is up against this year.
Because most schools have been in session since
August, the competition has had over a month more
to prepare for this tournament. Regardless, head
coach John Whitlinger still has confidence in his
team.
"We've had three days of practice, and at this
tournament you want them to start going and play
ing," Whitlinger said. "You hope for the best and
they do the best they can. The guys have taken a lit
tle time off in the summer, so we're just getting
going."
The competition was put into motion on Friday
with the start of the pre-qualifying rounds, which
was void of any Stanford players. The qualifying
rounds began yesterday when two Cardinal players

took to the courts at noon.
Senior Phil Sheng had a close first-round match
against No. 5 seeded Matt Lockin of Vanderbilt but
was unable to pull past his opponent. Lockin and
Sheng split the first two sets, but the Commodore
player closed out Sheng in the final set, nabbing a 6-
7(6), 7-6(4), 6-3 victory.
"I played well, but I just need to get in better
shape," Sheng said. "It's the first tournament of the
year, and I'm happy with how I played considering
we just started practice a week ago."
Sophomore No. 70 James Wan, seeded No. 9 in
the qualifying rounds, also had a rough first day at
the Champions Club. Wan was ousted in first-round
play after losing 6-4,6-3 to Alexander Farquharson
of Texas-Arlington. Considering his fantastic win
streak last year. Wan was not pleased with the out
come of yesterday's matches.
"This is the first time in a long time that I've lost
two matches in one day," Wan said.
Sheng and Wan entered the doubles tournament
as an alternate team, but were shut down by Paul
Rose and David Robinson of Purdue in a close 9-7
match.
"It was a great match," Whitlinger said. "It
wasn't the greatest tennis in the world, but they
competed hard. It was an interesting match to
watch, but unfortunately we came up a little short in

the end. I'm proud of the way they competed, and
we're going to get better and better."
Main draw action will begin on Thursday. Car
dinal fans should keep a lookout for senior No. 2
Sam Warburg, also seeded No. 2 in the tourna
ment, and junior No. 20 KC Corkery.
Both have improved their game over the past
year, and they will team up to form the No. 1 dou
bles duo, both in the tournament and in the nation.
The main draw will be posted on Wednesday,
which will name Corkery and Warburg's opponents
and state when match play begins.
"Both Sam and KC played a little bit this sum
mer on the Futures levels tournament on the ATP
Tour as amateurs," Whitlinger said. "I'm hoping for
the best for those guys. I want them to be in the final,
but we'll just see where they're at."
"I always want to win tournaments, that's for
sure, but it's very early in the season," Whitlinger
added. "I'm just anxious to see them play."
In total, the Icy Hot / ITA All-American Cham
pionship will host 192 singles players and 96 doubles
teams, downsizing into a 128-singles-player and 64-
doubles-team qualifying tournament. The winners
of the qualifying matches are fed into the 64-singles
player and 32-doubles-team main draw.

Junior James Pade and the men's tennis team will play at Icy Hot /
ITA Men's Ail-American Championships throughout the week.
The Cardinal will look toward a better outcome
this year after a disappointing showing at last year's
tournament.
Warburg was ousted in the first round of the main
draw after being defeated by Jeremy Wurtzman of Ohio
State, while Corkery was defeated in the second round
by Washington's Alex Vlaski.
Unfortunately, Warburg and Corkery will not be able
to seek revenge. Wurtzman has since graduated and
Vlaski will not be participating in the tournament.
Last year's singles title went to Vlaski, who defeated
Benedikt Dorsch of Baylor for the championship tro
phy. Lester Cook and Ante Matijevic of Texas A&M
overcame Rice's Richard and William Barker for the

doubles title.
For Whitlinger, this tournament is only the beginning
of a long string of challenges to look forward to.
"Everything is a building block, all the way though
the season, culminating at the NCAAs," he said. "I'm
looking forward to any of the tournaments we play this
fall; we just try to get better and better every day. When
this tournament is over the focus will be on the guys get
ting fitter in practice."
After this week, the next big tournament will be the

Junior James Pade and the men's tennis team will play at Icy Hot /
ITA Men's Ail-American Championships throughout the week.
The Cardinal will look toward a better outcome
this year after a disappointing showing at last year's
tournament.
Warburg was ousted in the first round of the main
draw after being defeated by Jeremy Wurtzman of Ohio
State, while Corkery was defeated in the second round
by Washington's Alex Vlaski.
Unfortunately, Warburg and Corkery will not be able
to seek revenge. Wurtzman has since graduated and
Vlaski will not be participating in the tournament.
Last year's singles title went to Vlaski, who defeated
Benedikt Dorsch of Baylor for the championship tro
phy. Lester Cook and Ante Matijevic of Texas A&M
overcame Rice's Richard and William Barker for the

doubles title.
For Whitlinger, this tournament is only the beginning
of a long string of challenges to look forward to.
"Everything is a building block, all the way though
the season, culminating at the NCAAs," he said. "I'm
looking forward to any of the tournaments we play this
fall; we just try to get better and better every day. When
this tournament is over the focus will be on the guys get
ting fitter in practice."
After this week, the next big tournament will be the
ITA National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships,
which are held in November. The NCAA Champi
onships rounds out the list of major tournaments for the
season.
With only a few days of practice under their
belts, the men of the Stanford tennis team will jump
into the competitive fray at the 2004 Icy Hot / ITA
Men's All-American Championships in Chat
tanooga, Tenn. this upcoming week.
This will be the first of three national champi
onship tournaments held during the 2004-05 season.
Historically the largest collegiate tournament in the
nation, this will be Stanford's first chance to see
what new players the team is up against this year.
Because most schools have been in session since
August, the competition has had over a month more
to prepare for this tournament. Regardless, head
coach John Whitlinger still has confidence in his
team.
"We've had three days of practice, and at this
tournament you want them to start going and play
ing," Whitlinger said. "You hope for the best and
they do the best they can. The guys have taken a lit
tle time off in the summer, so we're just getting
going."
The competition was put into motion on Friday
with the start of the pre-qualifying rounds, which
was void of any Stanford players. The qualifying
rounds began yesterday when two Cardinal players

took to the courts at noon.
Senior Phil Sheng had a close first-round match
against No. 5 seeded Matt Lockin of Vanderbilt but
was unable to pull past his opponent. Lockin and
Sheng split the first two sets, but the Commodore
player closed out Sheng in the final set, nabbing a 6-
7(6), 7-6(4), 6-3 victory.
"I played well, but I just need to get in better
shape," Sheng said. "It's the first tournament of the
year, and I'm happy with how I played considering
we just started practice a week ago."
Sophomore No. 70 James Wan, seeded No. 9 in
the qualifying rounds, also had a rough first day at
the Champions Club. Wan was ousted in first-round
play after losing 6-4,6-3 to Alexander Farquharson
of Texas-Arlington. Considering his fantastic win
streak last year. Wan was not pleased with the out
come of yesterday's matches.
"This is the first time in a long time that I've lost
two matches in one day," Wan said.
Sheng and Wan entered the doubles tournament
as an alternate team, but were shut down by Paul
Rose and David Robinson of Purdue in a close 9-7
match.
"It was a great match," Whitlinger said. "It
wasn't the greatest tennis in the world, but they
competed hard. It was an interesting match to
watch, but unfortunately we came up a little short in

the end. I'm proud of the way they competed, and
we're going to get better and better."
Main draw action will begin on Thursday. Car
dinal fans should keep a lookout for senior No. 2
Sam Warburg, also seeded No. 2 in the tourna
ment, and junior No. 20 KC Corkery.
Both have improved their game over the past
year, and they will team up to form the No. 1 dou
bles duo, both in the tournament and in the nation.
The main draw will be posted on Wednesday,
which will name Corkery and Warburg's opponents
and state when match play begins.
"Both Sam and KC played a little bit this sum
mer on the Futures levels tournament on the ATP
Tour as amateurs," Whitlinger said. "I'm hoping for
the best for those guys. I want them to be in the final,
but we'll just see where they're at."
"I always want to win tournaments, that's for
sure, but it's very early in the season," Whitlinger
added. "I'm just anxious to see them play."
In total, the Icy Hot / ITA All-American Cham
pionship will host 192 singles players and 96 doubles
teams, downsizing into a 128-singles-player and 64-
doubles-team qualifying tournament. The winners
of the qualifying matches are fed into the 64-singles
player and 32-doubles-team main draw.
