# Cardinal golf fails to execute at Windon
## 
### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's golf team had a great
chance to start the season with a pair of top
five finishes. Instead, the Cardinal followed
up their second-place finish at the Gold Rush
California Collegiate Golf Showcase with an
uninspired 12th-place finish at the Windon
Memorial Classic on Tuesday. Meanwhile,
host-team Northwestern took top team hon
ors by four strokes over Duke.
Stanford traveled to Lake Forest, 111. and
the Conway Farms Golf Course with hopes of
building on a strong start and gaining momen
tum for the fall season, but the team struggled
in unfamiliar conditions. An ugly opening
round made for an uphill battle through the
remaining 36 holes of competition.
It was a field that offered Stanford easy
pickings. Of the 18 teams in Lake Forest, only
three (No. 18 Oklahoma, No. 21 California,
No. 25 Minnesota) boasted top-25 rankings.
Furthermore, the Golden Bears quickly
and inexplicably took up residence at the bot
tom of the leader board on the first day, leav
ing the top spots open for the taking. Stan
ford, however, was unable to capitalize.
Stanford coach Conrad Ray refused to
make excuses.
"We felt prepared going into [the Windon
Memorial], but we just didn't execute the
shots we needed."
Louisiana State, Duke and defending
champion Minnesota rounded out the top
three spots after the first day, while the Car
dinal settled down into 10th place overall.
Senior Pat Phillips and freshman Rob
Grube could take no blame,. They each carded
a 73 on the first dayto tie for 16th individually.
From then on, though, it was all downhill.
Senior Kevin Blue shot 77, while junior Scott
Mac Donald recorded a 78. Meanwhile,
sophomore Zack Miller struggled mightily in
the opening round, carding an 82, the worst
regular-season round of his career.
"The green speeds were three to four feet
faster than the ones that we were used to see
ing [on the West Coast]," Grube said. "Of
course, we could blame the greens or the
wind, or whatever, but golfs a game where
you just don't play well sometimes."

"Hie Stanford men's golf team was in position to
place highly at the Windon Memorial Classic,
but the Cardinal struggled in the first round.
Stanford was unable to mount any sort of comeback.
Grube followed up his initial 73 with rounds of 77 and
70, finishing in a tie for 19th place, his second top-25 fin
ish in as many events.
Phillips, however, ballooned to SO and 74 on Tues
day, falling to 50th place individually and a tie with
Blue. Mac Donald and Miller notched matching pairs
of 77s on the day, settling for 73rd place and 82nd
place, respectively.
On the women's side, things went better. Stanford's
No. 19 women's golf team completed the second of
three rounds at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational on
Tuesday in eighth place among a 14-team field. No. 5
Oklahoma State was holding off Oregon and No. 6
Southern California for the top spot.
The competition is significantly stiffer than that at
the Windon, as half the participating teams are na
tionally ranked, and the tournament takes place at the
challenging Sahalee Country Club in Sammamish,
Wash.
Sophomore Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana is leading
the way for Stanford yet again, with rounds of 73 and 74.
She currently stands in a tie for fifth place individually.
Fellow sophomore Lauren Todd and junior Kelly
Husted have also played solidly. Todd is nine over par
and tied for 19th, while Husted is just a shot back, in a
tie for 22nd.
The final three spots, however, have not come
through thus far for the Cardinal. Sophomore Jenna
Seki shot S3 in her first round of the year, but she re
bounded nicely Tuesday and is tied for 39th place.
Senior Wendra Liang has carded rounds of SO and
S3, and she currently sits in a tie for 53rd place.
Junior Stephanie Lue. rounding out the scoring for
Stanford, battled blow-up holes on both Monday and
Tuesday and is tied for 59th place.
"We weren't as sharp or crisp with our short games
as we needed to be," said coach Caroline O'Connor.
"We spent some time on that, working on long putts,
trying to get our pace right."
Although the Cardinal women have started out
slowly, they still remain just five shots out of the top
five, and a solid finish is well within reach fora talented

squad.
"If we go out there and play our games the way we
know how, we should be fine," Husted said. "We should
definitely be able to move up a few spots."
After the conclusion of play today, the team will re
turn home where they will host an excellent field at the
Stanford Pepsi Intercollegiate Oct. 15-17.
