# Cardinal golf fails to execute at Windon
## 
### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's golf team had a great
chance to start the season with a pair of top
five finishes. Instead, the Cardinal followed
up their second-place finish at the Gold Rush
California Collegiate Golf Showcase with an
uninspired 12th-place finish at the Windon
Memorial Classic on Tuesday. Meanwhile,
host-team Northwestern took top team hon
ors by four strokes over Duke.
Stanford traveled to Lake Forest, 111. and
the Conway Farms Golf Course with hopes of
building on a strong start and gaining momen
tum for the fall season, but the team struggled
in unfamiliar conditions. An ugly opening
round made for an uphill battle through the
remaining 36 holes of competition.
It was a field that offered Stanford easy
pickings. Of the 18 teams in Lake Forest, only
three (No. 18 Oklahoma, No. 21 California,
No. 25 Minnesota) boasted top-25 rankings.
Furthermore, the Golden Bears quickly
and inexplicably took up residence at the bot
tom of the leader board on the first day, leav
ing the top spots open for the taking. Stan
ford, however, was unable to capitalize.
Stanford coach Conrad Ray refused to
make excuses.
"We felt prepared going into [the Windon
Memorial], but we just didn't execute the
shots we needed."
Louisiana State, Duke and defending
champion Minnesota rounded out the top
three spots after the first day, while the Car
dinal settled down into 10th place overall.
Senior Pat Phillips and freshman Rob
Grube could take no blame,. They each carded
a 73 on the first dayto tie for 16th individually.
From then on, though, it was all downhill.
Senior Kevin Blue shot 77, while junior Scott
Mac Donald recorded a 78. Meanwhile,
sophomore Zack Miller struggled mightily in
the opening round, carding an 82, the worst
regular-season round of his career.
"The green speeds were three to four feet
faster than the ones that we were used to see
ing [on the West Coast]," Grube said. "Of
course, we could blame the greens or the
wind, or whatever, but golfs a game where
you just don't play well sometimes."
