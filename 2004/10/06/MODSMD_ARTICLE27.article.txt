### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the second week in a row, Stanford was involved in
the most competitive game in the Pacific-10 Conference —
and the Cardinal won by 14 points.
This weekend also saw two of the Pac-10's ranked teams
assert their dominance on the road, while Stanford's perfor
mance inched it closer to the Top 25 and UCLA continued to
show offensive potential.
No. 19 Arizona Slate 28, Oregon 13
After a scoreless first quarter, the Sun Devils jumped out
to a halftime lead of 14-6. They held on for an impressive vic
tory over the host Ducks (1-3, 0-1 Pac-10), who have now
dropped two of their three home games at normally-inhos
pitable Autzen Stadium.
Senior signal-caller Andrew Walter completed 14-of-23
passes for 164 yards and three touchdowns for Arizona State,
while third-string tailback Hakim Hill rushed 25 times fora
career-best 142 yards and a touchdown.
Terrence Whitehead rushed for 98 yards and had 45
yards and a touchdown receiving for the Ducks, while
Kellen Clemens threw for 177 yards and rushed for 62
more. Jared Siegel kicked 22- and 34-yard field goals in the
second quarter.
Neither team committed a turnover. They combined to
punt 12 times.
Hill, pressed into action because starter Loren Wade was
suspended and Randy Hill was injured, helped carry the Sun
Devils (5-0,2-0) to their best start since they won 11 straight
during their 1996 Rose Bowl season.
No. 7 California 49. Oregon State 7
Playing for the first time in three weeks, the Golden Bears
(3-0, 1-0) thoroughly outclassed the Beavers (1-4. 0-2) at
Reiser Stadium. Cal led 21-7 after one quarter and never
looked back.
Cal quarterback Aaron Rodgers completed 12-of-16
passes for 140 yards and three touchdowns and rushed for
another.
Running back Terrell Williams completed the only pass
he threw fora 79-yard touchdown, and not to be outdone,
backup OB Reggie Robertson completed his only throw for
a 58-yard score.
Meanwhile. Beavers quarterback Derek Anderson's up
and-down career continued. He completed just 14-of-34
passes for 137 yards, was intercepted twice and failed to

throw a touchdown pass for the first time in 23 games.
J.J. Arrington added 108 yards rushing and a touchdown
for Cal, while Chase Lyman caught touchdown passes of 11,
79 and 31 yards.
Dwight Wright rushed for 73 yards, including a 45-yard
touchdown, for Oregon State, which was forced to punt 10
times.

allowing just five, averaging 539 yards per game while allow
ing just 262 yards.
UCLA 33, San Diego State 14
The Bruins rode the incredible legs of Maurice Drew to
their 17th consecutive win over the Aztecs. And this time, his
arm even got in on the act.
Pac-10 rushing leader Drew rushed 21 times for 165 yards,
including a 57-yard touchdown run, and completed a 47-yard
pass, while Pac-10 leading tackled Spencer Havner returned
an interception 52 yards fora touchdown.
Justin Medlock kicked field goals of 22,40,43 and 45 yards
and is a perfect 7-of-7 this year.
Those efforts helped UCLA survive another mediocre
outing from Drew Olson, who completed just 14-of-29 pass
es for 158 yards, one touchdown and one interception.
Brandon Bornes rushed for 62 yards and San Diego
State's only touchdown.
The non-conference contest moved the Bruins halfway to
bowl eligibility. UCLA's 10 points allowed were a season-low.
Stanford 27, Washington 13
Stanford blocked two punts and J.R. Lemon rushed for
three touchdowns and a career-high 162 yards as the Cardi
nal (3-1, 1-1) edged the beleaguered Huskies (0-4, 0-2) in a
mistake-filled game.
Lemon compiled his yardage on just 19 carries and also
caught four passes from Trent Edwards, who completed 23-
of-33 passes for 254 yards but was intercepted three times in
Husky territory.
Washington's quarterback, true freshman Carl Bonnell,
completed just 9-of-25 passes for 118 yards and was inter
cepted once, while its tailback, Kenny James, gained just 40
yards on 15 rushes.
The teams combined to miss two extra points and commit
five turnovers.
Next Week: Cal @ No. 1 Southern California; Stanford @
Notre Dame (3-2); Oregon @ Washington State (3-1); Ari
