## Hermanson must die (and other thoughts on SF's exit) 
### 
Remember in high school, when you
would come in late or get caught in a
lie, and your parents would send you to
your room with the ominous, "We'll discuss
this later"? A heavy silence would fill the
room; the air around you was somehow thick
and sticky, and each second dragged on longer
than the one before it as you waited for the
hammer to fall. Time itself slowed down, and
you remembered every minute detail of your
own errors — and, even

more clearly, the catastro
phe that resulted.
The San Francisco Gi
ants' bullpen finally got
caught on Saturday. Possess
ing a 3-0 lead entering the
ninth inning at Dodger Sta-i
dium, they managed to sur-1
render seven runs beforeP
getting two outs, ending the
Giants' postseason hopes.

Let's just lay it out there: The Giants' re
lievers, for the majority of the season, rede
fined awful. Dustin Hermanson, in addition to
looking like a child molester and winning the
Rollie Fingers Award for Worst Facial Hair in
Sports, is as adequately suited to close base
ball games as Michael Jackson is to be a pedi
atrician.
Watching him jog in from the pen makes
me wince and all my bodily sphincters con
tract like I'm about to go into anaphylactic
shock. The Giants have had bullpen problems
all season, but never did anything about it.
Still, I held out hope.
1 watched the second half of the game in my
room, watched Brett "the Undead" Tomko
reach back for another quality start, watched
Marquis Grissom come up with the offense to
back him up.
I was giddy. The Giants had Jason Schmidt
going on Sunday, giving them a good chance
to steal the division from the Dodgers. And
then came the ninth inning:
2:35 p.m.: Tomko exits the game in a tense
situation in the bottom of the eighth. Scott
Eyre comes on and gets a big out. Hermanson
enters the game and gets out of the inning.
2:42: After a scoreless top of the ninth,
Cody Ransom replaces Deivi Cruz at short
stop. a fact noted by the Fox announcers. My
friend Dan, a Dodgers fan, remarks, "Ran
som's going to make an error." My roommate
and I respond in unison. "No he's not — he's
a defensive replacement."
2:43: Hermanson returns to pitch the
ninth. He immediately surrenders a single
and two walks. The room is now approxi
mately 120 degrees.
2:43: My roommate Noah, a Giants fan,
leaves the room to play Wayne Gretzky's 3D
Hockey. He knows what's coming.
2:45: The bases are loaded with one out.
Hermanson walks pinch-hitter Hee Seop
Choi to drive in a run. making it 3-1. Choi has
hit .158 since joining the Dodgers in August.
2:47: Jason Christiansen enters the game
for the Giants. He gets Cesar Izturis to ground
to short. Ransom moves into the shadow cre
ated by the stadium's upper deck just as he
reaches the ball, and boots it. A girl in the hall
hears me scream like Howard Dean getting
his nuts slammed in a drawer. She looks
scared. It is 3-2.
2:52: Matt Herges comes in to pitch. Jayson
Werth singles to right, tying the game. I am be
ginning to look around for hard liquor.

2:55: Wayne Franklin (who?), the Giants' fourth
pitcher of the inning, throws two pitches to Steve Finley.
The second one is deposited into the right-field stands. 7-
3 Dodgers; game over, playoffs over, season over.
2:56:1 find Noah, calmly playing hockey. "I know,"he
says, before I can complain.
3:22:1 receive this voicemail, from my dad: "Listen, 1
don't want you dealing with this loss through your copi
ous liquor cabinet. I'm sorry too. I'm having enough
trouble dealing with your mother [my mom is a Dodgers
fan). Have a quiet weekend."
1 don't need to tell you that the Astros won the Wild
Card Sunday, eliminating the Giants' last shred of hope.
In any case, it would have been a horrific injustice had

Dan's timeline:
how Giants failed

the Giants made the playoffs after Saturday. They don't
belong, and things are right the way they are now.
At some point, probably during one of the ten shots
Fox provided us of the Giants' bullpen (all filed under
"Obvious Foreshadowing"), I realized something. This
is not a team that deserves to make the playoffs. If you
can't hold a three-run lead late in the ninth, you will not
succeed in October.
Still, it hurt. A lot. Dustin Michael Hermanson, you
go to your room RIGHT NOW.

when the Dodgers got their asses handed to them by St.
