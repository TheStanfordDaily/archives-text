### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
CLEVELAND, Ohio — Vice
President Dick Cheney and Sena
tor John Edwards squared off in a
contentious 90-minute debate last
night here at Case Western Re
serve University.
Moderated by PBS newswoman
Gwen Ifill, the debate began on the
topic of foreign policy, with an em
phasis on the war in Iraq, before
switching to domestic issues for the
second half.
At a private reception at the
Case Western Historical Society,
student representatives from across
the country, this reporter included,
joined University benefactors and
public officials to watch the debate
live.
Throughout the debate, Ed
wards stressed the theme of credi

bility and new leadership, while
Cheney focused on Kerry's incon
sistent record in contrast to Presi
dent George W. Bush's resolve.
"We need a fresh start. We need
a president who has credibility,"
Edwards said. In response to ques
tions regarding his relative youth
and inexperience, he said, "A long
resume does not equal good judg
ment."
Cheney criticized both Edwards
and Kerry on their voting record.
"You've not been consistent,
and there's no indication that Kerry
has the conviction to carry through
on the war on terror," he told Ed
wards.
Students watching the debate
said they were impressed by both
candidates' performances.
"It was, finally, a chance to see
some substance," said Lakshimi
Nambiar, a junior at M.I.T. "Both
argued very well, but I was espe
cially impressed with how Edwards
defended himself."
Stanford junior Victor McFar
land agreed. "I was impressed by
the fact that neither candidate
ducked the questions," he said. "I
thought Edwards was fantastic,"
McFarland said, but added that the
senator's closing statement - in
which he talked about a childhood
experience — was his "least fa
vorite because it was the least sub
stantive."
Substance was lacking through
out Edwards's performance, said

Don Donelson Jr., a senior at the
University of Miami.
"John Edwards looked like a
college sophomore, and Dick Ch
eney looked like the Vice President
of the United States," he said. "Ch
eney was authoritative. He was
powerful, and Edwards was lapping
at his heels like a child."
Case students and other Cleve
land residents appreciated both
candidates' mention of their city,
which was recently ranked by the
U.S. Census as the poorest major
city in the nation, with a poverty
rate of 31 percent in 2003.
Following the debate, Edwards
spoke to a rally of supporters and

urged the young people in the audi
ence to vote.
"This is your country," he said to
a crowd of about 1.000 students and
community members. "You have
the ability to change this country."
Edwards recalled a statement
made by a political pundit in re
sponse to a questions about how he
could predict the outcome of the
election before the votes were tal
lied.
"He said. 'If you drive by the
polls, and there are a lot of young
people in line. John Kerry will be
the next President of the United
