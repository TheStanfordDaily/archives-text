# VP candidates clash in Cleveland
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
CLEVELAND, Ohio — Vice
President Dick Cheney and Sena
tor John Edwards squared off in a
contentious 90-minute debate last
night here at Case Western Re
serve University.
Moderated by PBS newswoman
Gwen Ifill, the debate began on the
topic of foreign policy, with an em
phasis on the war in Iraq, before
switching to domestic issues for the
second half.
At a private reception at the
Case Western Historical Society,
student representatives from across
the country, this reporter included,
joined University benefactors and
public officials to watch the debate
live.
Throughout the debate, Ed
wards stressed the theme of credi

bility and new leadership, while
Cheney focused on Kerry's incon
sistent record in contrast to Presi
dent George W. Bush's resolve.
"We need a fresh start. We need
a president who has credibility,"
Edwards said. In response to ques
tions regarding his relative youth
and inexperience, he said, "A long
resume does not equal good judg
ment."
Cheney criticized both Edwards
and Kerry on their voting record.
"You've not been consistent,
and there's no indication that Kerry
has the conviction to carry through
on the war on terror," he told Ed
wards.
Students watching the debate
said they were impressed by both
candidates' performances.
"It was, finally, a chance to see
some substance," said Lakshimi
Nambiar, a junior at M.I.T. "Both
argued very well, but I was espe
cially impressed with how Edwards
defended himself."
Stanford junior Victor McFar
land agreed. "I was impressed by
the fact that neither candidate
ducked the questions," he said. "I
thought Edwards was fantastic,"
McFarland said, but added that the
senator's closing statement - in
which he talked about a childhood
experience — was his "least fa
vorite because it was the least sub
stantive."
Substance was lacking through
out Edwards's performance, said

Don Donelson Jr., a senior at the
University of Miami.
"John Edwards looked like a
college sophomore, and Dick Ch
eney looked like the Vice President
of the United States," he said. "Ch
eney was authoritative. He was
powerful, and Edwards was lapping
at his heels like a child."
Case students and other Cleve
land residents appreciated both
candidates' mention of their city,
which was recently ranked by the
U.S. Census as the poorest major
city in the nation, with a poverty
rate of 31 percent in 2003.
Following the debate, Edwards
spoke to a rally of supporters and

urged the young people in the audi
ence to vote.
"This is your country," he said to
a crowd of about 1.000 students and
community members. "You have
the ability to change this country."
Edwards recalled a statement
made by a political pundit in re
sponse to a questions about how he
could predict the outcome of the
election before the votes were tal
lied.
"He said. 'If you drive by the
polls, and there are a lot of young
people in line. John Kerry will be
the next President of the United

The vice presidential debate
topped off a full day of political ac
tivity at Case. Along with CNN,
MSNBC, MTV, and over 1,000
media representatives, protesters
and party loyalists gathered around
the debate hall early in the morning
and circulated around central cam
pus all day.
Carli Citraro, a sophomore at
Baldwin Wallace College, arrived a 7
a.m. to support the Bush/Cheney
ticket. "I came with the College Re
publicans," she said. "I just wanted
to show my support for Cheney and
possibly see Cheney after the de
bate." She plans to vote for Bush be
cause "he promotes stability. If
Americans break down, what mes
sage does that send to the rest of the
world?"
Juliana Gildener-Leapman, a
freshman at Case, was out campaign
ing on behalf of pro-Israel student
groups. "I support Kerry's position
on a two-state Israel/Palestine solu
tion," she said. However, she said
she remains undecided because of
"Kerry's wavering on the issue."
Bush and Kerry supporters flood
ed the CNN booth in the afternoon
for their chance to be seen — and

Students divided about
performance of candidates

heard — in the background of a live
taping of "Crossfire."
"I've studied Kerry for four to
five months, and I like what he says
about working with other countries
fora common solution in Iraq," said
Robert Ballinger, 60. a volunteer for
the Kerry campaign from Akron,
Ohio. To him, the war in Iraq was the
most important issue. "We need to
put an end to the misery in Iraq, and
we cannot do it alone."
A registered Independent,
Ballinger has voted for Republican
presidents in the past but said he was
voting for Kerry in what he believes
is "the most important election in my
lifetime." He added, "I've never
been more involved in a political
campaign as I have in this one."
Students crowded MTV's "Rock
the Vote" tent later in the evening,
where the cable network teamed up
with Case to throw a debate viewing
party. Case students seemed excited
and overwhelmed by the flurry of
campus activity.
Case freshman Janice Makinen
spent much of the afternoon follow
ing the media circus before heading
to a pro-choice rally.
"It's ridiculous," she said of the
national attention to her campus.

"It's definitely a really good promo
tional thing for the school. I see all
the ads on MTV — it's crazy!" she
added.
"In a way, it feels like the campus
has been usurped from us," Gilden
er-Leapman said. Yet she welcomed
the media presence: "It's an exciting
time to get to be out here, where
everything is taking place."
Case Provost and Vice President
John Anderson said he hoped the
political excitement surrounding the
debates would "energize the cam
pus," students and faculty included.
"Among the faculty, it's created a di
alogue where there wasn't one be
fore," he said.
Anderson believed the events of
this week would prove to be the be
ginning of a growing trend. "We
would be disappointed if this politi
cal energy didn't last; if it didn't carry
on from class to class."
He suggested that Case's reputa
tion in science and technology
should not prevent students in those
fields from being politically active.
"It is really too bad that there
aren't more science and technology
students involved in politics. We
hope that just being at Case, it will
encourage those students," he said.

tion," she said. However, she said
she remains undecided because of
"Kerry's wavering on the issue."
Bush and Kerry supporters flood

for their chance to be seen — and

heard — in the background of a live
taping of "Crossfire."
"I've studied Kerry for four to
five months, and I like what he says
about working with other countries
fora common solution in Iraq," said
Robert Ballinger, 60. a volunteer for
the Kerry campaign from Akron,
Ohio. To him, the war in Iraq was the
most important issue. "We need to
put an end to the misery in Iraq, and
we cannot do it alone."
A registered Independent,
Ballinger has voted for Republican
presidents in the past but said he was
voting for Kerry in what he believes
is "the most important election in my
lifetime." He added, "I've never
been more involved in a political
campaign as I have in this one."
Students crowded MTV's "Rock
the Vote" tent later in the evening,
where the cable network teamed up
with Case to throw a debate viewing
party. Case students seemed excited
and overwhelmed by the flurry of
campus activity.
Case freshman Janice Makinen
spent much of the afternoon follow
ing the media circus before heading
to a pro-choice rally.
"It's ridiculous," she said of the
national attention to her campus.

"It's definitely a really good promo
tional thing for the school. I see all
the ads on MTV — it's crazy!" she
added.
"In a way, it feels like the campus
has been usurped from us," Gilden
er-Leapman said. Yet she welcomed
the media presence: "It's an exciting
time to get to be out here, where
everything is taking place."
Case Provost and Vice President
John Anderson said he hoped the
political excitement surrounding the
debates would "energize the cam
pus," students and faculty included.
"Among the faculty, it's created a di
alogue where there wasn't one be
fore," he said.
Anderson believed the events of
this week would prove to be the be
ginning of a growing trend. "We
would be disappointed if this politi
cal energy didn't last; if it didn't carry
on from class to class."
He suggested that Case's reputa
tion in science and technology
should not prevent students in those
fields from being politically active.
"It is really too bad that there
aren't more science and technology
students involved in politics. We
hope that just being at Case, it will
encourage those students," he said.
CLEVELAND, Ohio — Vice
President Dick Cheney and Sena
tor John Edwards squared off in a
contentious 90-minute debate last
night here at Case Western Re
serve University.
Moderated by PBS newswoman
Gwen Ifill, the debate began on the
topic of foreign policy, with an em
phasis on the war in Iraq, before
switching to domestic issues for the
second half.
At a private reception at the
Case Western Historical Society,
student representatives from across
the country, this reporter included,
joined University benefactors and
public officials to watch the debate
live.
Throughout the debate, Ed
wards stressed the theme of credi

bility and new leadership, while
Cheney focused on Kerry's incon
sistent record in contrast to Presi
dent George W. Bush's resolve.
"We need a fresh start. We need
a president who has credibility,"
Edwards said. In response to ques
tions regarding his relative youth
and inexperience, he said, "A long
resume does not equal good judg
ment."
Cheney criticized both Edwards
and Kerry on their voting record.
"You've not been consistent,
and there's no indication that Kerry
has the conviction to carry through
on the war on terror," he told Ed
wards.
Students watching the debate
said they were impressed by both
candidates' performances.
"It was, finally, a chance to see
some substance," said Lakshimi
Nambiar, a junior at M.I.T. "Both
argued very well, but I was espe
cially impressed with how Edwards
defended himself."
Stanford junior Victor McFar
land agreed. "I was impressed by
the fact that neither candidate
ducked the questions," he said. "I
thought Edwards was fantastic,"
McFarland said, but added that the
senator's closing statement - in
which he talked about a childhood
experience — was his "least fa
vorite because it was the least sub
stantive."
Substance was lacking through
out Edwards's performance, said

Don Donelson Jr., a senior at the
University of Miami.
"John Edwards looked like a
college sophomore, and Dick Ch
eney looked like the Vice President
of the United States," he said. "Ch
eney was authoritative. He was
powerful, and Edwards was lapping
at his heels like a child."
Case students and other Cleve
land residents appreciated both
candidates' mention of their city,
which was recently ranked by the
U.S. Census as the poorest major
city in the nation, with a poverty
rate of 31 percent in 2003.
Following the debate, Edwards
spoke to a rally of supporters and

urged the young people in the audi
ence to vote.
"This is your country," he said to
a crowd of about 1.000 students and
community members. "You have
the ability to change this country."
Edwards recalled a statement
made by a political pundit in re
sponse to a questions about how he
could predict the outcome of the
election before the votes were tal
lied.
"He said. 'If you drive by the
polls, and there are a lot of young
people in line. John Kerry will be
the next President of the United

States."'
The vice presidential debate
topped off a full day of political ac
tivity at Case. Along with CNN,
MSNBC, MTV, and over 1,000
media representatives, protesters
and party loyalists gathered around
the debate hall early in the morning
and circulated around central cam
pus all day.
Carli Citraro, a sophomore at
Baldwin Wallace College, arrived a 7
a.m. to support the Bush/Cheney
ticket. "I came with the College Re
publicans," she said. "I just wanted
to show my support for Cheney and
possibly see Cheney after the de
bate." She plans to vote for Bush be
cause "he promotes stability. If
Americans break down, what mes
sage does that send to the rest of the
world?"
Juliana Gildener-Leapman, a
freshman at Case, was out campaign
ing on behalf of pro-Israel student
groups. "I support Kerry's position
on a two-state Israel/Palestine solu
tion," she said. However, she said
she remains undecided because of
