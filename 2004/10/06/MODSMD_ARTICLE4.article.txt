# Cheney and Edwards highlight differences...
## 
### 
... on American credibility
Edwards: "We are actually going to tell the American people the truth.
And it's not just the American people. We are also going to tell the
world the truth."
Cheney: "It's awfully hard to portray a sense of credibility when you
voted for the war and then say it's the wrong war in the wrong place at
the wrong time."
... on taxes
Cheney: "I think the Kerry / Edwards approach basically is to raise
taxes and to give government more control over the lives of individual
citizens. We think it's the wrong way to go. There's a fundamental dif
ference of opinion here."
Edwards: "And there is a philosophical difference between us and them.
We are for more tax cuts for the middle class... we are not for more tax
cuts for multimillionaires."

... on the war in Iraq
Cheney: "The world is safer today because Saddam Hussein is in jail, his
government's no longer in power, and we did exactly the right thing."
Edwards: "There is no connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11,
period. And any connection between Saddam and al Qaeda is tenuous
at best."
... on Halliburton and campaign rhetoric
Edwards: "While he was C.E.O. of Halliburton, they paid millions of
dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just
like Enron and Ken Lay."
Cheney: "The reason they keep mentioning Halliburton is because
they're trying to throw up a smoke screen. They know the charges are
false."
