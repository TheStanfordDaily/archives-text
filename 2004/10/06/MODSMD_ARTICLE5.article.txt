Stanford's commitment to sup
port its African-American commu
nity was recognized by recently pub
lished college rankings from Black
Enterprise Magazine.
Many students in the black com
munity, while they agreed with the
ranking, said the University still has
room for improvement, citing the
need fora larger Black Community
Services Center, also known as the
Black House, as one example.
The University has retained its
seventh-place ranking in Black En
terprise Magazine's recently pub
lished list of the "50 Best Colleges
and Universities for African Ameri
cans" for the year 2004. Most of the
schools ranked ahead of the Stan
ford are historically black colleges
such as Howard University in Wash
ington. D.C. and Xavier University
in New Orleans.
According to the article, a panel
of over 1,500 African-American pro
fessionals rated various colleges and
universities "based on whether they
felt the schools were a good social
and educational environment for
African-American students."
The list of rankings was then com
piled by Thomas A. LaVeist, profes
sor of health policy, management
and sociology at Johns Hopkins Uni
versity.
LaVeist said in an e-mail that four
major factors contributed to a

school's ranking: the percentage of
African-American undergraduate
students; the five-year graduation
rate for African Americans; and two
survey scores, for the school's acade
mic and social environments.
Many members of the black com
munity at Stanford are pleased with
the University's high ranking on
Black Enterprise's list and cite Uni
versity support and diversity within
the community itself as reasons for
its success.
"Whereas most universities fail to
see the importance of having com
munity centers for minorities, in
cluding women and the LGBT com
munity, Stanford does more than
just vocally proclaim the importance
of diversity, by supporting and cele
brating the centers and their contri
butions," said junior Chioke
Borgelt-Mose, who is the current
ASSU president.
"Every time 1 walk into the Black
House, I know that I'll find a friend
ly face who will sincerely inquire
about my day, regardless of whether
or not they know me."
Some black students decided to
attend Stanford because of its em
phasis on diversity, especially among
minority communities.
"The strength of the black com
munity was one of the main reasons
why I came to Stanford," said senior
and Black Community Service Cen
ter Staff Member Ashleigh Collins.
