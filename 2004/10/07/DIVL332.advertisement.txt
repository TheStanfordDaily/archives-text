Forget the first date jitters!
Hooking up your camera and computer couldn't be easier. With USB
products, you just plug and go. But USB connects more than just
cameras. Look for certified USB MP3 players, PDAs, printers, joysticks
and more. This could just be a match made in heaven.
Look for certified USB products at your local retailer.
