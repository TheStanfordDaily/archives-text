# Seats empty, Council unable to hear case
## 
### DAVID HERBERT DESK EDITOR 
Senior Dylan Mefford will not
drop the suit he filed lust May
against the ASSU, but with just one
member of the Constitutional Coun
cil remaining after a string of resig
nations last spring, ASSU officials
are struggling with how to proceed.
"This isn't about me," said Mef
ford. who filed the suit after the Sen
ate refused to certify the executive
election results last April that would
have made senior Mikey Lee and
Mefford ASSU president and vice
president, respectively. "It's not
going to affect who is in office. Bring
ing the case causes people to consid
er the need for reform of the elec
toral and certification processes."
Mefford's case argues that the
Senate's main reason for overturn
ing the election results — that Lee
abused his power as senior class
president when he sent out a cam
paign e-mail to the class of 2(X)4 list
— was unconstitutional because it
infringed on Lee's free speech
rights.
The case could not be heard at the
end of last year because three of the
Council's four members resigned,
leaving the Council without the four
members needed for quorum. Ac
cording to Council Chair Bill Curry,
a fifth-year doctoral candidate in
geophysics, the situation is difficult
to resolve because the officials that
select new Council members are in
volved in the case.
Current ASSU president Chioke
Borgelt-Mose, a junior, came into of
fice on the heels of the Senate's deci
sion to nullify the election results.
The conflict of interest, in this case, is
that the ASSU president is responsi
ble for nominating candidates for the

Council.
The Senate, which is the respon
dent in Mefford's case, is responsible
for confirming those nominees.
"The number of conflicts of inter
est is almost entertaining," Curry
said.
In an effort to minimize the ap
pearance of partiality. Borgelt-Mose
has suggested naming an indepen
dent commission to nominate candi
dates for the four open Council
seats. The nominees would then go
before the Senate and Graduate Stu
dent Council for the usual confirma
tion process.
"Our first priority is to select stu
dents to sit on a nominating council
in the next three weeks," she said.
However, according to Senate
Chair Chris Lin. a senior, a shortage
of qualified and interested candi
dates could be a problem.
"It's not exactly like we have peo
ple lining up for this position." said
Senate Chair Chris Lin, a senior.
Another problem. Curry said,
was that Borgelt-Mose's plan did not
address the issue of the Senate's con
flict of interest in the matter.
"This would be like the US Con
gress appointing Supreme Court jus
tices during lawsuits alter the presi
dential election in 2000."
Mefford. however, said he did not
care who ended up on the Council,
as long as the case was heard.
"I don't think it really matters
who is on it or which way the case
goes," he said. "It's more just to
make sure people continue to con
sider election issues."
Curry added that issues of con
flict of interest aside, the episode
highlighted serious Haws within the
ASSU. This Senate, he said, was the


JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily
same that rejected appointing a fifth
Council member last spring, a move
he argued was political because ac
cording to Council protocol, the pe
titioner, in this case Mefford, loses
the case in the event of a tie. Mef
ford lost the case in a unanimous de
cision. with one abstention.
Curry argued that the senators'
inaction —many of whom openly
opposed the Lee / Mefford ticket —
opposed the standard practice of
keeping at least five members on the
Council to prevent the body's num
bers from dipping below four.
" This could have been partially
prevented if the Senate had appoint
ed Ying Wong last year." said Curry,
who had pushed encouraged the
Senate to appoint a fifth member.
Curry added that while the
Council is not often called into ser
vice. if it remains defunct, it could
have wider reaching consequences.
"In theory, if the students are not
upholding the Constitution, the
Hoard of Trustees could dissolve the

Just one Council
member remains

ASSU," he said.
Last April, Lee and Mefford beat
then-junior Ajani Husbands and
then-sophomore Alyssa Schwartz in
the race for the executive branch.
Elections violations on both sides,
however, led the Senate to refuse to
certify the election results. The con
troversial decision led to a special
election and set off a two-month
long political battle during which
Lee and Mefford brought two cases
to the Constitutional Council in an
effort to have the first election re
sults certified.
The failure of their second case
brought the special-elcction victors,
then sophomores Chioke Borgelt-
Mose and Kory Vargas Caro, to of
fice. Mefford. however, filed a case
in the closing weeks of the quarter
arguing fora third time the uncon
stitutionality of the Senate's deci
sion. but the resignations of three of
the council's four members kept the
suit from being heard.

stitutionality of the Senate's deci
sion. but the resignations of three of
the council's four members kept the
suit from being heard.
Senior Dylan Mefford will not
drop the suit he filed lust May
against the ASSU, but with just one
member of the Constitutional Coun
cil remaining after a string of resig
nations last spring, ASSU officials
are struggling with how to proceed.
"This isn't about me," said Mef
ford. who filed the suit after the Sen
ate refused to certify the executive
election results last April that would
have made senior Mikey Lee and
Mefford ASSU president and vice
president, respectively. "It's not
going to affect who is in office. Bring
ing the case causes people to consid
er the need for reform of the elec
toral and certification processes."
Mefford's case argues that the
Senate's main reason for overturn
ing the election results — that Lee
abused his power as senior class
president when he sent out a cam
paign e-mail to the class of 2(X)4 list
— was unconstitutional because it
infringed on Lee's free speech
rights.
The case could not be heard at the
end of last year because three of the
Council's four members resigned,
leaving the Council without the four
members needed for quorum. Ac
cording to Council Chair Bill Curry,
a fifth-year doctoral candidate in
geophysics, the situation is difficult
to resolve because the officials that
select new Council members are in
volved in the case.
Current ASSU president Chioke
Borgelt-Mose, a junior, came into of
fice on the heels of the Senate's deci
sion to nullify the election results.
The conflict of interest, in this case, is
that the ASSU president is responsi
ble for nominating candidates for the

Council.
The Senate, which is the respon
dent in Mefford's case, is responsible
for confirming those nominees.
"The number of conflicts of inter
est is almost entertaining," Curry
said.
In an effort to minimize the ap
pearance of partiality. Borgelt-Mose
has suggested naming an indepen
dent commission to nominate candi
dates for the four open Council
seats. The nominees would then go
before the Senate and Graduate Stu
dent Council for the usual confirma
tion process.
"Our first priority is to select stu
dents to sit on a nominating council
in the next three weeks," she said.
However, according to Senate
Chair Chris Lin. a senior, a shortage
of qualified and interested candi
dates could be a problem.
"It's not exactly like we have peo
ple lining up for this position." said
Senate Chair Chris Lin, a senior.
Another problem. Curry said,
was that Borgelt-Mose's plan did not
address the issue of the Senate's con
flict of interest in the matter.
"This would be like the US Con
gress appointing Supreme Court jus
tices during lawsuits alter the presi
dential election in 2000."
Mefford. however, said he did not
care who ended up on the Council,
as long as the case was heard.
"I don't think it really matters
who is on it or which way the case
goes," he said. "It's more just to
make sure people continue to con
sider election issues."
Curry added that issues of con
flict of interest aside, the episode
highlighted serious Haws within the
ASSU. This Senate, he said, was the


JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily
same that rejected appointing a fifth
Council member last spring, a move
he argued was political because ac
cording to Council protocol, the pe
titioner, in this case Mefford, loses
the case in the event of a tie. Mef
ford lost the case in a unanimous de
cision. with one abstention.
Curry argued that the senators'
inaction —many of whom openly
opposed the Lee / Mefford ticket —
opposed the standard practice of
keeping at least five members on the
Council to prevent the body's num
bers from dipping below four.
" This could have been partially
prevented if the Senate had appoint
ed Ying Wong last year." said Curry,
who had pushed encouraged the
Senate to appoint a fifth member.
Curry added that while the
Council is not often called into ser
vice. if it remains defunct, it could
have wider reaching consequences.
"In theory, if the students are not
upholding the Constitution, the
Hoard of Trustees could dissolve the

Just one Council
member remains

ASSU," he said.
Last April, Lee and Mefford beat
then-junior Ajani Husbands and
then-sophomore Alyssa Schwartz in
the race for the executive branch.
Elections violations on both sides,
however, led the Senate to refuse to
certify the election results. The con
troversial decision led to a special
election and set off a two-month
long political battle during which
Lee and Mefford brought two cases
to the Constitutional Council in an
effort to have the first election re
sults certified.
The failure of their second case
brought the special-elcction victors,
then sophomores Chioke Borgelt-
Mose and Kory Vargas Caro, to of
fice. Mefford. however, filed a case
in the closing weeks of the quarter
arguing fora third time the uncon
stitutionality of the Senate's deci
sion. but the resignations of three of
