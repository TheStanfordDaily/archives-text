1966 —On Oct. 7, The Stanford
Daily ran a story about the draft test
conflicting with Big Game day.
Below is an excerpt:
"Is anything capable of competing
with The Big Game? The Selective
Service System thinks so. It has
scheduled the draft deferment test
for November 18 and 19.
Mr. Walter Findeisen, Head of
the National Service Office, strong
ly recommended taking the tests.
Although non-commital about test
ing during Big Game period, Mr.
Findeisen said, "Taking the test is
important for everyone who wants a
deferment. It can t hurt, but it can
help a lot."
The University Testing and
Counciling Service expects about
1,500 students will take the tests.
This would be 3,500 less than last
year. This drop is due to the one
test-to-a-student policy of the Selec
tive Service. Most students from 18
to 26 took it last year, leaving main
ly the new crop of 18 year-olds.
Protest marked the administra
tion of the tests at Stanford last year.
During the summer, the Academic
Committee of the University debat
ed whether to continue them this
year. Mr. Findeisen said the admin
istration could not predict if there
would be protests this year. If there
are any they are expected to be mild.
Sample results of last year's tests
show that 81 percent got a passing
score of 70 or better. Of the high
school seniors who took the test, 68
percent got 70 or above. College
freshmen did better, 80 percent
scoring over 70."

1981 —On Oct. 7, The Stanford
Daily ran a story about Oxford deny
ing a Stanford overseas proposal.
Below is an excerpt:
"Stanford's Overseas Studies
Program has been denied permis
sion to relocate a teaching facility in
Oxford. England, according to
Overseas Studies Director Mark
Mancall.
Although the University has not
yet received an official explanation
from the Oxford City Planning
Committee, Mancall said he specu
lates that the action was 'political' in
nature.
Mancall said that there are al
ready a large number of colleges in
existence in the city (as part of Ox
ford University). This is a possible
reason for the planning committee's
decision, he said.
The Overseas Studies Program
here currently operates a campus in
Great Britain at the country estate
of Cliveden, a 19th century manor
house located west of London.
According to Mancall, the pro
posed move from Cliveden to Ox
ford is desirable because of Oxford's
status as 'one of the major academic
centers in the English-speaking
world.'
Mancall said he does not expect
another overseas campus to be
opened in the near future, but hopes
to establish a campus 'outside of Eu
rope - in Latin America or Asia.'
'We are always exploring other op
portunities," he said."
