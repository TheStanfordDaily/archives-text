# Alcohol cases clog discipline system at Dartmouth
## 
### ALEX BELSER THE DARTMOUTH (DARTMOUTH COLLEGE 
(U-WIRE) HANOVER, N.H. -
It might not come as much of a sur
prise to students, but a significant
majority of those who tangle with
Dartmouth College's disciplinary
system do so because of alcohol, offi
cial College reports indicate.
For the third straight year, rough
ly 60 percent of the cases entering
the disciplinary system this past aca
demic year resulted in students
being found responsible for either
public intoxication or underage pos
session of alcohol, according to the
latest Office of Undergraduate Judi
cial Affairs report.
In all, 261 students were found re
sponsible for public intoxication and
85 received violations for underage
possession of alcohol, according to
the report.
This represented 68 percent of
sanctions, down slightly from last
year.
In a particularly serious incident in
volving drinking this past year, one
intoxicated student started a fire in a
residence hall stairwell and then ran
away, in the end getting expelled

from the college.
"The sanction reflects the seri
ousness and danger of the student's
behavior, inconsistencies between
the student's account and the physi
cal evidence and the fact that the stu
dent ran away from the fire without
pulling an alarm," the report con
cluded.
The incident, described in the re
port as "not typical," was one of 588
disciplinary cases handled by the
College during the 2003-04 academ
ic year.
Four students were suspended for
driving under the influence, and also
faced local court cases, while 17 stu
dents were disciplined for possessing
drugs or drug paraphernalia.
The report also recorded five se
rious cases of students becoming
"extremely belligerent and uncoop
erative" with Safety and Security
and Dick's House personnel, leading
to two suspensions and some court
charges.
In one case of alleged sexual
abuse, a male student was suspended
for six terms.
In another incident, two students
having relationship problems were
placed on College Discipline and
"directed to have no further contact

with each other," and one of the stu
dents was later suspended for violat
ing that order.
"Though students may hope to
keep their relationship issues pri
vate, there can be disciplinary rami
fications when problems in a rela
tionship lead to either noise com
plaints or other situations that bring
the matter to the college's atten
tion," the report noted.
Most other college discipline
cases involved the Academic Honor
Principle.
Seventeen of 18 students found
responsible for violations received
some type of suspension. For the
first time this year, students charged
with Honor Principle violations
were able to opt out of a Committee
on Standards hearing and meet with
a dean instead. As a result, just six of
20 cases reached the committee.
Former director of Undergradu
ate Judicial Affairs Marcia Kelly
said in some plagiarism cases, stu
dents plead ignorance of the proper
way to cite sources, but that doesn't
necessarily absolve students of pun
ishment.
"It really depends upon the na
ture of the situation," said Kelly.
The report cites the "Sources"

handbook in recommending stu
dents write down their sources as
they do research, and notes that stu
dents are supposed to do something
if they find out about a violation of
the Academic Honor Principle.
In at least one case last year, a stu
dent alerted a professor about an e
mail containing exam answers, lead
ing the professor to change the
exam.
The student who sent the e-mail had
apparently taken the exam early and
sent information to the class.
The report framed such cases as a
question of confidence.
"Faculty at Dartmouth approach
their teaching from a perspective of
trusting students and expecting trust
in return. That trust may be irrepara
bly harmed by the failure of students
to report this type of incident," the
report said.
The report was compiled mainly
by Kelly, a 10-year college veteran,
who was promoted to an associate
dean position effective Friday, re
placing Janet Terp. Assistant direc
tor of Undergraduate Judicial Af
fairs April Thompson is serving as
the acting director of the depart

a dean instead. As a result, just six of
20 cases reached the committee.
Former director of Undergradu
ate Judicial Affairs Marcia Kelly
said in some plagiarism cases, stu
dents plead ignorance of the proper
way to cite sources, but that doesn't
necessarily absolve students of pun
ishment.
"It really depends upon the na
ture of the situation," said Kelly.
The report cites the "Sources"

handbook in recommending stu
dents write down their sources as
they do research, and notes that stu
dents are supposed to do something
if they find out about a violation of
the Academic Honor Principle.
In at least one case last year, a stu
dent alerted a professor about an e
mail containing exam answers, lead
ing the professor to change the
exam.
The student who sent the e-mail had
apparently taken the exam early and
sent information to the class.
The report framed such cases as a
question of confidence.
"Faculty at Dartmouth approach
their teaching from a perspective of
trusting students and expecting trust
in return. That trust may be irrepara
bly harmed by the failure of students
to report this type of incident," the
report said.
The report was compiled mainly
by Kelly, a 10-year college veteran,
who was promoted to an associate
dean position effective Friday, re
placing Janet Terp. Assistant direc
tor of Undergraduate Judicial Af
fairs April Thompson is serving as
the acting director of the depart
ment.
