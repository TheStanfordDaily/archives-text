# [Diet] Coke Addicts
## 
### LAUREN GONG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
It's sweet, bubbly and — to the delight of
many — calorie-free. Diet soda is one of
those things that seems too good to be true.
From the houses to the dining halls to the
vending machines, you can grab a cold, frosty

can, bottle or glass
of the bubbly stuff
at nearly every
hour of the day.
With all of the
taste and none of
the sugar, no won
der it is the drink

of choice of many calorie-conscious indi
viduals. In fact, when 1 asked a number
of Stanford students why Diet Coke was
their beverage of choice, the most fre
quent response was, "Well, it has zero
calories."

"I originally started drinking it be
cause it was a cheaper alternative to espres
so drinks." said a junior who wished to re
main anonymous. "I drank diet over regular
because drinking that much regular Coke
would be just a whole lot of empty calories."
For some, the diet soda habit began when
they stepped on the Stanford campus.
"I started drinking Diet Coke because all
of my drawmates were drinking it," said an
other junior. "I felt it was weird that I was
not. My roommate would drink up to five or
six glasses of Diet Coke a day."
Mike Orme, the former kitchen manager
of Narnia house, said that Diet Coke was the

number-two most frequently
changed soda in the soda foun
tain, with regular Coke still fill
ing the number-one spot.
Some people believe diet
cola is healthier than its sugar
packed relative, yet even with
out the high-fructose corn syrup
that makes up most other regu
lar carbonated beverages, diet
soda is not exactly a "health
food." The component of diet
cola that separates the diet from
the regular is the artificial sweet
ener aspartame, which some re
searchers suspect may not be
completely benign.

The [fake] sweet stuff
Artificial sweeteners were previously
given a bad rap when the Food and Drug Ad
ministration forced manufacturers to slap
warning labels on all products containing the
artificial sweetener saccharin. Studies had
shown that lab rats that consumed large
amounts of saccharin were prone to develop
ing cancerous tumors.
Nutritionists are quick to point out,
however, that these tests were performed
only on animal subjects that were given
very high doses.

"The results [from this study] are mostly
used as a scare tactic," said Vivian Crisman,
the nutritionist at the Vaden Student Health
Center. "The amount of saccharin the rats
were given would be equivalent to about
1.000 Diet Cokes consumed in one day. Be
sides, she added. "Saccharin and aspartame
are two completely different chemicals with

completely different structures."
The FDA has also issued warnings
about aspartame, saying that ex
cessive consumption of the sweet
ener may cause headaches. The
link between moderate consump
tion of aspartame and cancer,
though, has

not proven
conclusive
in studies.
One of
the compo
nents that

has some doc
tors worried
about aspar
tame is the
amino acid
phenylalanine.
This essential
amino acid is

found in most foods containing protein, in
cluding meat, dairy products, tofu and beans.
Even though people consume this amino
acid every day, one can of Diet Coke has
more phenylalanine than one would normal
ly need in one vear. accordine to adolescent

of Diet Coke a day."

medicine specialist Dr. Rebecka Peebles.
Is too much phenylalanine dangerous?
Crisman said an increased intake of the
amino acid is not really an issue. Excess
phenylalanine is only a concern for individu
als with the rare metabolic disorder
phenylketonuria, who cannot metabolize the
amino acid and must avoid foods with a high
phenylalanine content.
Peeling the [caffeine] buzz
Diet sodas may be lacking in calories, but
they have additional ingredients that may
pose health risks when consumed in large

quantities — and they have zero nutrients.
"Diet cola has no nutritive value and
should not replace water or other more nu
tritive drinks like milk." Peebles said. "Caf
feine acts as a diuretic, so putting aside any
possible risks of aspartame, as that is contro
versial, you are dehydrating yourself daily by
[drinking too much diet cola]."
According the Coca Cola Web site, caf
feine is added to the sodas sold by the com
pany as a flavor component and adds a slight
ly bitter taste to the beverage. But is the fla
vor worth it?
Besides dehydration, there are other
risks involved with drinking large amounts
of any caffeinated beverage, including ul
cers, headaches and possible decreases in
bone density. Long-term consumption can
lead to difficulty sleeping, headaches, ner
vousness and higher levels of stomach acid.
A can of Diet Coke has 45 mg. of caffeine.
Pepsi-lovers can breathe a little easier: A can

of Diet Pepsi,
by compari
son, has 36 mg.
Both of these
have less caf
feine than a
cup of coffee
or a shot of

espresso. Yet
many students consume more than one can
of diet cola, which can lead to caffeine over
load.

Women and [Diet] Coke
While Crisman said that
one to two cans (12 to 24 ounces)
a day in terms of aspartame con
sumption is reasonable, some stu
dents on campus who live in
houses with soda fountains that
are accessible all day can drink up
to five to eight glasses of soda a
day — a particularly bad habit
for women, who are risking their
bone health.
"Women must maintain a
calcium-phosphorus balance.
When eating foods high in phos
phorus, like soda, it is a double
hit for one's bone health, espe-

cially for women who are at a
higher risk for osteoporosis," Crisman said.
Women are likely to consume diet cola
when watching their weight, but some fear
that sodas such as Diet Coke may actually
increase appetite. While in the past, some
studies supported the idea that aspartame
increases one's appetite, recent studies
have shown no association between greater
appetite and artificial sweeteners.
"If I found out that Diet Coke made me
eat more, that would totally negate my entire
reasoning for drinking it in the first place,"
commented another anonymous junior. "I'd
rather drink regular soda."
So if diet sodas don't affect the appetite,

can they help people lose weight?
Crisman said she questions the connection
between drinking diet soda and weight loss.
"We've had [artificial sweeteners] in our
food supply for 40 to 50 years already and we're
getting even more overweight." Crisman said.
Given that many students end up con
suming significantly more than one or two
glasses of diet cola per day, some wonder
whether the beverage is addictive. The
body can certainly get used to a caffeine
kick, but the addiction is probably pri
marily psychological.
Drinking a lot of soda when one is
young can be the start to a permanent
habit. Because the long-term health risks
of drinking great amounts of diet soda —
or even soda in general — are basically
unknown, soda consumption should be

watched.
Both Peebles and Crisman agreed that
the age at which food habits start is one
concern that comes to mind when they
hear of young people consuming a lot of
diet cola.
"I don't think we know the results of
high-dose, long-term usage," Peebles
said. "I am not trying to make people
panic, as aspartame seems to be safe in
low-to-moderate doses in studies. I'm just
questioning, though, the wisdom of start
ing to drink it in heavy quantities from
adolescence onward."
