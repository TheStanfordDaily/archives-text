# Low-carb, net-carb, carb-lite: The truth behind the flashy diet claims
## 
### 
These days, it is hard to read a food label without getting a dose of information overload. While the
Food and Drug Administration regulates the labeling of low-fat non-fat, light and reduced-fat foods, it
has not — ana most likely will never — regulate low-carb labeling. Why? Because doing so would be
admitting that low-carb diets are acceptable, a position the agency is not willing to take.
So what do the food companies say wnen they mean that something nas "fewer cams"? Basically, there is no
regulation of the phrases "low-carb,' "reduced-carb," "carb-lite," so don't relv on flashy ads. A glance at the
nutrition labels on the back of the product, which are regulated by the FDA, will prove to be much more useful.
Some foods, such as the low-carb wraps at the Treehouse in Tresidder, advertise the number of "net
carbs." Companies calculate "net carbs" dy discounting the carbohydrates in the food that come from
fiber. Your body is not very good at breaking down plant fiber, known as cellulose, and it passes pri
marily undigested through your intestine tract. Thus, when an item contains a large amount of fiber, such
as a whole-wheat tortilla or whole-wheat bread, it will contain fewer digestible carbohydrates.
The bottom line? Keep in mind that "low-carb" does not equal "healthy." For instance, the "Atkins-
Friendly Chicken Bacon Ranch Wrap" at Subway contains 440 calories and 26 grams of fat —
hardly "healthy" food. Rather than falling for advertising tricks, follow the simple and common sense
advice of Mary Duch, nutrition consultant for Stanford Dining: "The way to become more healthy
and control your weight is to develop good eating habits and exercise habits for [your] lifetime."
