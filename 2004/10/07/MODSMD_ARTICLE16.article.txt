## Editorial Goals not met in advising changes 
### 
This year, the freshman advising program was re-
I'ormed with the intention of matching advisees
and advisors in a way taht is more conducive to
one-on-one relationships. Although the pro
gram meets most of its objectives, some of the changes
have had unanticipated consequences in spite of their
good intentions, such as making it more difficult for
groups to schedule meetings.
To improve the program, the I Jndergraduate Advis
ing Center should rethink the large advising group sizes,
and the dorm locations of the people in those groups.
Academic advising is a very important part of the
freshman experience. A student's Academic Advisor
and Peer Advising Assistant can help him or her adjust
to Stanford life, choose classes and decide upon majors.
Hundreds of students and faculty are involved in fresh
man advising and their commitments are noteworthy.
However, recent changes have not markedly im
proved freshman advising. Although it would he nice to
match all advisees with advisors who have common in
terests, the benefit of better matches does not exceed
the burden of different locations.
For one, freshmen often change their interests, tak
ing advantage of the flexibility Stanford provides them
their first year to explore the fields of engineering, hu
manities anil social sciences. Because interests change,
which is expected at a liberal arts school, advising should

consider focusing on more general advice instead of nar
row advice in a specific field.
Second, matching advisees this year has created
groups of freshman in different — yet nearby — dorms.
Although dorms may be close, group meetings are hard
er to coordinate when different dorms arc involved.
According to the IJAC, the old group dynamic has
been deemphasized in favor of developing one-on-one
relationships between advisor and advisee. This change
was made to accommodate busy faculty members who
chose to be AAs despite not receiving extra compensa
tion in the position. However, social interactions in a
group setting also foster closer relationships.
At the same time, the group size has expanded to an
average of eight advisees. Considering that AAs have
more advisees It) deal with and that it is harder to meet
with them as a group, it seems that freshmen advising
would need to either take more time or decrease in qual
ity
Instead of matching freshmen so carefully, the UAC
should think about reducing the group sizes. With fewer
advisees to work with, AAs and PAAs will be able to
focus more closely on the freshmen in their group. By
spreading the amount of work among more people, this
will also decrease the amount of time that AAs have to
invest in freshman advising.
