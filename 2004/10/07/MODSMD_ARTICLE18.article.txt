## Cheerleaders deserve spot on field 
### GLENN TRUITT 
The editorial hoard's attack on
Cardinal Competitive Cheer was
mean-spiriled. uninformed and in
competent. I have, for three years
here at the law school, seen people
proudly walk around with Direc
tor's Cup T-shirts, proclaiming
Stanford as the nation's top athletic
university and then seen these same
students attend football games with
all the vigor of a calculus lecture.
Having the cheerleaders on the
field makes the games feel like big
time college football. The football
team works harder than most of us
at balancing their school with their
athletic pursuits and the least we
can do is be excited when they're
doing well
Cardinal Competitive Cheer is
out at everv fiame trying to motivate

an otherwise apathetic crowd and
demonstrating their own athletic
skills. Further, they're there for the
team — not for the students — and
certainly not for the Band and Dol
lies.
Like it or not, cheerleading is a
real college sport, offering full
scholarships at many of the nation's
top schools. There are nationally
televised competitions, and recent
ly, major motion pictures all devot
ed to the sport. Why shouldn't Stan
ford have a team? And why should
we have to hide it? The sidelines is
where the cheerleaders do their
thing, and it's fun to watch, too.
The Daily's editorial spoke of
equal access to the sidelines, and
how CCC shouldn't get a spot just
because they asked for one. That's
absolutely right. They should get a
spot because they're better and

work harder than any of the groups
presently on the sideline. And, if
there's not enough room, let's ask
the football team who they want on
the sideline, because the students
won't show up anyway.
1 spent last year as a member of
CCC and 1 can personally attest to
all of this. ( heerleaders, as silly as it
may sound, are out there risking
themselves to motivate one of the
least interested crowds in college
football.
Here's an idea: Instead of com
plaining. tell your spirit groups to
practice, get better, be exciting to
watch and then maybe the cheer
leaders won't need to take their
spots.
