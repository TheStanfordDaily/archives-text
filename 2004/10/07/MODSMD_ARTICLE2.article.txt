# New a cappella group vies for talent
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Singing, dancing and otherwise
strutting their stuff, members of
Stanford's nine a cappella groups
took to tabling in White Plaza, flyer
ing over campus and performing in
dorms last week to recruit students
to audition for their groups.
No, the number nine wasn't a
typo.
For over a decade, the correct an
swer to the Stanford trivia question,
"How many a cappella groups call
Stanford home?" has been eight.
This year, however, a new group
joined the ranks. Founded in 2(X)2
and officially declared a Stanford a
cappella group by the Office of Stu
dent Affairs this past April, the all
male, Hindi music group Raagapella
joined the formal a cappella audi
tions process this fall.
"The a cappella community is ex
cited about having a new group with
its own new style," said Harmonics
president senior Mvles Morrison.
"Adding another group did make
auditioning scheduling a bit tighter,
but Raagapella was really responsi
ble about not stepping on anyone's
toes."
The two weeks that groups spend
recruiting and holding auditions is
perhaps the most intense time of the
year fora cappella groups. Alumni
come from across the country to
help out and group members get
very little sleep between recruiting,

auditioning and deliberating-as evi
denced by cans of Red Bull and
Moonbeans coffee cups scattered
around the Harmonics' audition
room.
The auditioning process was par
ticularly intense for Raagapella—
group members were lucky to get
three hours of sleep a night. Having
no alumni and only seven returning
members, the group could not field
enough singers to perform at dorm
shows or the O-Show during Orien
tation Week, and it barely had
enough hands to man a table in
White Plaza or post flyers around
campus.
The group focused on recruiting
from the South Asian community,
performing at events sponsored by
the Asian American Students Asso
ciation and the Asian American
New Student Orientation Commit
tee.
On top of the usual workload of
auditions, Raagapella was faced
with the challenge of creating its
own new audition style. Other
groups have already forged their
identities, complete with specific tra
ditions for the audition process —
Counterpoint sings "These are the
Days" when it rolls out its new mem
bers, the Harmonics have their audi
tionees stand on a silver star when
they try out. and Fleet Street throws
a miniature party whenever a poten
tial singer walks into the audition
room.
"The students are auditioning for

groups, but the groups are also audi
tioning for students so we try to he as
enthusiastic as possible and show
our best face," said former Harmon
ics member Matthew Kaufman.

"When you walk into an audition
you really get a feeling for what the
group is like — immediately," said
Raagapella president senior Bobby
Ghosh, who has auditioned fora
myriad of a cappella groups over the
past years including the Mendicants,
Mixed Company and Talisman.
Raagapella crafted its auditions
to create the feeling of a group of

laidback guys with tight-knit friend
ships, explained financial officer se
nior Mehul Trivedi.
"We want people to join the
group because they love the music
and stay in the group because they
love the guys," Trivedi said.
The group picked up on other
groups' traditions like hosting a bar
beque before callbacks and cheering
rampantly when auditionees enter
the audition room.
It also created traditions of its
own. For example, they made home-
