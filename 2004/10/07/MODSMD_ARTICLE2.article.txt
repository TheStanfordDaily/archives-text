# New a cappella group vies for talent
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Singing, dancing and otherwise
strutting their stuff, members of
Stanford's nine a cappella groups
took to tabling in White Plaza, flyer
ing over campus and performing in
dorms last week to recruit students
to audition for their groups.
No, the number nine wasn't a
typo.
For over a decade, the correct an
swer to the Stanford trivia question,
"How many a cappella groups call
Stanford home?" has been eight.
This year, however, a new group
joined the ranks. Founded in 2(X)2
and officially declared a Stanford a
cappella group by the Office of Stu
dent Affairs this past April, the all
male, Hindi music group Raagapella
joined the formal a cappella audi
tions process this fall.
"The a cappella community is ex
cited about having a new group with
its own new style," said Harmonics
president senior Mvles Morrison.
"Adding another group did make
auditioning scheduling a bit tighter,
but Raagapella was really responsi
ble about not stepping on anyone's
toes."
The two weeks that groups spend
recruiting and holding auditions is
perhaps the most intense time of the
year fora cappella groups. Alumni
come from across the country to
help out and group members get
very little sleep between recruiting,

auditioning and deliberating-as evi
denced by cans of Red Bull and
Moonbeans coffee cups scattered
around the Harmonics' audition
room.
The auditioning process was par
ticularly intense for Raagapella—
group members were lucky to get
three hours of sleep a night. Having
no alumni and only seven returning
members, the group could not field
enough singers to perform at dorm
shows or the O-Show during Orien
tation Week, and it barely had
enough hands to man a table in
White Plaza or post flyers around
campus.
The group focused on recruiting
from the South Asian community,
performing at events sponsored by
the Asian American Students Asso
ciation and the Asian American
New Student Orientation Commit
tee.
On top of the usual workload of
auditions, Raagapella was faced
with the challenge of creating its
own new audition style. Other
groups have already forged their
identities, complete with specific tra
ditions for the audition process —
Counterpoint sings "These are the
Days" when it rolls out its new mem
bers, the Harmonics have their audi
tionees stand on a silver star when
they try out. and Fleet Street throws
a miniature party whenever a poten
tial singer walks into the audition
room.
"The students are auditioning for

groups, but the groups are also audi
tioning for students so we try to he as
enthusiastic as possible and show
our best face," said former Harmon
ics member Matthew Kaufman.
Class of 1997.
"When you walk into an audition
you really get a feeling for what the
group is like — immediately," said
Raagapella president senior Bobby
Ghosh, who has auditioned fora
myriad of a cappella groups over the
past years including the Mendicants,
Mixed Company and Talisman.
Raagapella crafted its auditions
to create the feeling of a group of

laidback guys with tight-knit friend
ships, explained financial officer se
nior Mehul Trivedi.
"We want people to join the
group because they love the music
and stay in the group because they
love the guys," Trivedi said.
The group picked up on other
groups' traditions like hosting a bar
beque before callbacks and cheering
rampantly when auditionees enter
the audition room.
It also created traditions of its
own. For example, they made home-

made t-shirb> with iron-on logos and served burg
ers and hof dogs with chicken curry and manttar
paneer at their barbeque to reflect the group's
goal of fusing 1 lindi and Western music.
Since the group didn't have enough members
or alumni to have someone greet singers when
ihey came to audition, two dedicated fans volun
teered to help out.
"Our volunteer greeters rounded out the feel
ing of a group of guys with a small but dedicated
fan base," said music director Sanjay Kswrim.
The actual auditions took place last Wednes
day and last Thursday. On Thursday night, all the
groups met to coordinate callback schedules for
Friday so there would be nooverlapps. After a full
night of callbacks and deliberations, the group di
rectors met again in Meyer Library at 4 a.m. on
Saturday to sort out which groups get which
singers.
Commonly known as the "envelope meeting,"
the 4 a.m. meeting is voluntarily facilitated by an
alumnus and former Everyday People singer,
Ethan Rikleen Auditionees write down their
group preferences on index cards and seal them in
envelopes. Rikleen opens the envelopes whenev
er more than one group wants the auditionee.
Stanford's envelope process works very well com
pared to processes at other schools like Yale
where the groups line up at a gale and literally
race to the doors of the singers they want, ex
plained Rikleen.
When Rikleen opened Raagapella's first en
velope, the group directors shared a little Kodak
moment and let out sighs of "Aw. it's your first
envelope!"
Raagapella left the meeting with its top five
choices and waited no less than three minutes be
fore running off to roll-out their new members as
the sun began to rise.
"After the envelope meeting we were all fa
tigued because we hadn't slept, but we were all
smiling," said Trivedi. "It was one of the most re
warding experiences I've had, we had five new
amazing voices."

Every group rolled out its new members in the
wee hours of Saturday morning and sang at each
new member's door. Raagapella picked up the
tradition and sang "O Carol" during roll-outs.
The song has been a feature of the group through
out Raagapella's short history. Showcasing
Hindi, English and Punjabi solos, the song is a
prime example of Raagapella's Eastern and
Western fusion style.
After roll-outs, the group went to a Santa Cruz
beach and taught the song to all the new members.
Minutes later they were serenading two girls who
happened to be on the beach — replacing their
names for the name "Carol" in the song.
Ghosh, Trivedi and Kairam reported that the
process went as smoothly as they could have
hoped despite initial concerns last spring about
how they would be received by the a capella
community.
"Because I'm heavily involved in the a capella
community, 1 had received concerns last year that
Raagapella would be stretching the talent on cam
pus too far," said Kairam who also sings in Fleet
Street. "Some people thought the a capella com
munity was already saturated and couldn't ac
commodate another group."
The concern of spreading talent too thin is the
primary reason why proposals for new a capella
groups have consistently been turned down by the
Office of Student Affairs each year, explained
Ghosh. The OSA hasn't approved a new group
since Testimony and the Harmonics joined the
scene in 1991.
Raagapella made its case, however, by indicat
ing that it was carving out a unique niche in the a
capella community with its South Asian focus.
"I'm surprised that all of Stanford's groups
have survived this long," said Rickleen. "1 think
groups survive because each has its own niche...
Raagapella has got a specific group of singers and
a specific audience. If they didn't have clear a rai
son d'etre, they wouldn't have been received as
well."
Both the OSA and the a capella community at

large have been very receptive and supportive of
Raagapella's formation. Some groups were even
referring auditionees to Raagapella's table in
White Plaza and Fleet Street offered to help Raa
gapella put up flyers.
Raagapella's distinctiveness was confirmed
during the auditions process. Half of its new re
cruits and three-quarters of its auditionees only
tried out for Raagapella — evidence, said Ghosh,
that Raagapella brought out new singers who
wouldn't have otherwise auditioned.
"It was very gratifying to see that we weren't
pulling talent from other groups, but rather creat
ing space for new talent on campus," said Kairam.
"We didn't want to step on the toes of other
groups," continued Trivedi. "So we were really
glad that we could harness talent that wouldn't
have been used."
Freshman Sahil Dhandhia is an example of tal
ent that would have likely gone untapped without
Raagapella's existence. Born and raised in Bom
bay, Dhandhia auditioned and joined Raagapella
because it offered a taste of home.
"I love India," Dhandhia said after his first re
hearsal with the group. His fellow new group
members chuckled with Dhandhia over his au- *
thentic pronunciation of "India." complete with
heavy inflection on the last syllable Although aH
of Raagapella's members are of South Asian de
scent. Dhandhia is the only member who was born
and raised in India.
At their first rehearsal with Ragapella, Dhand
hia and the four other new members joined the
seven returning members around a piano at the
Braun music building to learn One of their first
pieces of music, Sukiyaki. The new members
looked a bit timid as they stood still next to re
turning members who were bouncing to the
rhythm.
But when they closed the rehearsal by singing
"O Carol," there was a look of comfort in their
eyes — "we know how to do this," piped up a
freshman in the back. "We've done this one too
many times now!"

Days" when it rolls out its new mem
bers, the Harmonics have their audi
tionees stand on a silver star when
they try out. and Fleet Street throws
a miniature party whenever a poten
tial singer walks into the audition
room.
"The students are auditioning for

groups, but the groups are also audi
tioning for students so we try to he as
enthusiastic as possible and show
our best face," said former Harmon
ics member Matthew Kaufman.
Class of 1997.
"When you walk into an audition
you really get a feeling for what the
group is like — immediately," said
Raagapella president senior Bobby
Ghosh, who has auditioned fora
myriad of a cappella groups over the
past years including the Mendicants,
Mixed Company and Talisman.
Raagapella crafted its auditions
to create the feeling of a group of

laidback guys with tight-knit friend
ships, explained financial officer se
nior Mehul Trivedi.
"We want people to join the
group because they love the music
and stay in the group because they
love the guys," Trivedi said.
The group picked up on other
groups' traditions like hosting a bar
beque before callbacks and cheering
rampantly when auditionees enter
the audition room.
It also created traditions of its
own. For example, they made home-

made t-shirb> with iron-on logos and served burg
ers and hof dogs with chicken curry and manttar
paneer at their barbeque to reflect the group's
goal of fusing 1 lindi and Western music.
Since the group didn't have enough members
or alumni to have someone greet singers when
ihey came to audition, two dedicated fans volun
teered to help out.
"Our volunteer greeters rounded out the feel
ing of a group of guys with a small but dedicated
fan base," said music director Sanjay Kswrim.
The actual auditions took place last Wednes
day and last Thursday. On Thursday night, all the
groups met to coordinate callback schedules for
Friday so there would be nooverlapps. After a full
night of callbacks and deliberations, the group di
rectors met again in Meyer Library at 4 a.m. on
Saturday to sort out which groups get which
singers.
Commonly known as the "envelope meeting,"
the 4 a.m. meeting is voluntarily facilitated by an
alumnus and former Everyday People singer,
Ethan Rikleen Auditionees write down their
group preferences on index cards and seal them in
envelopes. Rikleen opens the envelopes whenev
er more than one group wants the auditionee.
Stanford's envelope process works very well com
pared to processes at other schools like Yale
where the groups line up at a gale and literally
race to the doors of the singers they want, ex
plained Rikleen.
When Rikleen opened Raagapella's first en
velope, the group directors shared a little Kodak
moment and let out sighs of "Aw. it's your first
envelope!"
Raagapella left the meeting with its top five
choices and waited no less than three minutes be
fore running off to roll-out their new members as
the sun began to rise.
"After the envelope meeting we were all fa
tigued because we hadn't slept, but we were all
smiling," said Trivedi. "It was one of the most re
warding experiences I've had, we had five new
amazing voices."

Every group rolled out its new members in the
wee hours of Saturday morning and sang at each
new member's door. Raagapella picked up the
tradition and sang "O Carol" during roll-outs.
The song has been a feature of the group through
out Raagapella's short history. Showcasing
Hindi, English and Punjabi solos, the song is a
prime example of Raagapella's Eastern and
Western fusion style.
After roll-outs, the group went to a Santa Cruz
beach and taught the song to all the new members.
Minutes later they were serenading two girls who
happened to be on the beach — replacing their
names for the name "Carol" in the song.
Ghosh, Trivedi and Kairam reported that the
process went as smoothly as they could have
hoped despite initial concerns last spring about
how they would be received by the a capella
community.
"Because I'm heavily involved in the a capella
community, 1 had received concerns last year that
Raagapella would be stretching the talent on cam
pus too far," said Kairam who also sings in Fleet
Street. "Some people thought the a capella com
munity was already saturated and couldn't ac
commodate another group."
The concern of spreading talent too thin is the
primary reason why proposals for new a capella
groups have consistently been turned down by the
Office of Student Affairs each year, explained
Ghosh. The OSA hasn't approved a new group
since Testimony and the Harmonics joined the
scene in 1991.
Raagapella made its case, however, by indicat
ing that it was carving out a unique niche in the a
capella community with its South Asian focus.
"I'm surprised that all of Stanford's groups
have survived this long," said Rickleen. "1 think
groups survive because each has its own niche...
Raagapella has got a specific group of singers and
a specific audience. If they didn't have clear a rai
son d'etre, they wouldn't have been received as
well."
Both the OSA and the a capella community at

large have been very receptive and supportive of
Raagapella's formation. Some groups were even
referring auditionees to Raagapella's table in
White Plaza and Fleet Street offered to help Raa
gapella put up flyers.
Raagapella's distinctiveness was confirmed
during the auditions process. Half of its new re
cruits and three-quarters of its auditionees only
tried out for Raagapella — evidence, said Ghosh,
that Raagapella brought out new singers who
wouldn't have otherwise auditioned.
"It was very gratifying to see that we weren't
pulling talent from other groups, but rather creat
ing space for new talent on campus," said Kairam.
"We didn't want to step on the toes of other
groups," continued Trivedi. "So we were really
glad that we could harness talent that wouldn't
have been used."
Freshman Sahil Dhandhia is an example of tal
ent that would have likely gone untapped without
Raagapella's existence. Born and raised in Bom
bay, Dhandhia auditioned and joined Raagapella
because it offered a taste of home.
"I love India," Dhandhia said after his first re
hearsal with the group. His fellow new group
members chuckled with Dhandhia over his au- *
thentic pronunciation of "India." complete with
heavy inflection on the last syllable Although aH
of Raagapella's members are of South Asian de
scent. Dhandhia is the only member who was born
and raised in India.
At their first rehearsal with Ragapella, Dhand
hia and the four other new members joined the
seven returning members around a piano at the
Braun music building to learn One of their first
pieces of music, Sukiyaki. The new members
looked a bit timid as they stood still next to re
turning members who were bouncing to the
rhythm.
But when they closed the rehearsal by singing
"O Carol," there was a look of comfort in their
eyes — "we know how to do this," piped up a
freshman in the back. "We've done this one too
many times now!"

Raagapella creates its own traditions to
stand out among crowded a capella field
Singing, dancing and otherwise
strutting their stuff, members of
Stanford's nine a cappella groups
took to tabling in White Plaza, flyer
ing over campus and performing in
dorms last week to recruit students
to audition for their groups.
No, the number nine wasn't a
typo.
For over a decade, the correct an
swer to the Stanford trivia question,
"How many a cappella groups call
Stanford home?" has been eight.
This year, however, a new group
joined the ranks. Founded in 2(X)2
and officially declared a Stanford a
cappella group by the Office of Stu
dent Affairs this past April, the all
male, Hindi music group Raagapella
joined the formal a cappella audi
tions process this fall.
"The a cappella community is ex
cited about having a new group with
its own new style," said Harmonics
president senior Mvles Morrison.
"Adding another group did make
auditioning scheduling a bit tighter,
but Raagapella was really responsi
ble about not stepping on anyone's
toes."
The two weeks that groups spend
recruiting and holding auditions is
perhaps the most intense time of the
year fora cappella groups. Alumni
come from across the country to
help out and group members get
very little sleep between recruiting,

auditioning and deliberating-as evi
denced by cans of Red Bull and
Moonbeans coffee cups scattered
around the Harmonics' audition
room.
The auditioning process was par
ticularly intense for Raagapella—
group members were lucky to get
three hours of sleep a night. Having
no alumni and only seven returning
members, the group could not field
enough singers to perform at dorm
shows or the O-Show during Orien
tation Week, and it barely had
enough hands to man a table in
White Plaza or post flyers around
campus.
The group focused on recruiting
from the South Asian community,
performing at events sponsored by
the Asian American Students Asso
ciation and the Asian American
New Student Orientation Commit
tee.
On top of the usual workload of
auditions, Raagapella was faced
with the challenge of creating its
own new audition style. Other
groups have already forged their
identities, complete with specific tra
ditions for the audition process —
Counterpoint sings "These are the
Days" when it rolls out its new mem

singers.
Commonly known as the "envelope meeting,"
the 4 a.m. meeting is voluntarily facilitated by an
alumnus and former Everyday People singer,
Ethan Rikleen Auditionees write down their
group preferences on index cards and seal them in
envelopes. Rikleen opens the envelopes whenev
er more than one group wants the auditionee.
Stanford's envelope process works very well com
pared to processes at other schools like Yale
where the groups line up at a gale and literally
race to the doors of the singers they want, ex
plained Rikleen.
When Rikleen opened Raagapella's first en
velope, the group directors shared a little Kodak
moment and let out sighs of "Aw. it's your first
envelope!"
Raagapella left the meeting with its top five
choices and waited no less than three minutes be
fore running off to roll-out their new members as
the sun began to rise.
"After the envelope meeting we were all fa
tigued because we hadn't slept, but we were all
smiling," said Trivedi. "It was one of the most re
warding experiences I've had, we had five new
amazing voices."

Every group rolled out its new members in the
wee hours of Saturday morning and sang at each
new member's door. Raagapella picked up the
tradition and sang "O Carol" during roll-outs.
The song has been a feature of the group through
out Raagapella's short history. Showcasing
Hindi, English and Punjabi solos, the song is a
prime example of Raagapella's Eastern and
Western fusion style.
After roll-outs, the group went to a Santa Cruz
beach and taught the song to all the new members.
Minutes later they were serenading two girls who
happened to be on the beach — replacing their
names for the name "Carol" in the song.
Ghosh, Trivedi and Kairam reported that the
process went as smoothly as they could have
hoped despite initial concerns last spring about
how they would be received by the a capella
community.
"Because I'm heavily involved in the a capella
community, 1 had received concerns last year that
Raagapella would be stretching the talent on cam
pus too far," said Kairam who also sings in Fleet
Street. "Some people thought the a capella com
munity was already saturated and couldn't ac
commodate another group."
The concern of spreading talent too thin is the
primary reason why proposals for new a capella
groups have consistently been turned down by the
Office of Student Affairs each year, explained
Ghosh. The OSA hasn't approved a new group
since Testimony and the Harmonics joined the
scene in 1991.
Raagapella made its case, however, by indicat
ing that it was carving out a unique niche in the a
capella community with its South Asian focus.
"I'm surprised that all of Stanford's groups
have survived this long," said Rickleen. "1 think
groups survive because each has its own niche...
Raagapella has got a specific group of singers and
a specific audience. If they didn't have clear a rai
son d'etre, they wouldn't have been received as
well."
Both the OSA and the a capella community at

large have been very receptive and supportive of
Raagapella's formation. Some groups were even
referring auditionees to Raagapella's table in
White Plaza and Fleet Street offered to help Raa
gapella put up flyers.
Raagapella's distinctiveness was confirmed
during the auditions process. Half of its new re
cruits and three-quarters of its auditionees only
tried out for Raagapella — evidence, said Ghosh,
that Raagapella brought out new singers who
wouldn't have otherwise auditioned.
"It was very gratifying to see that we weren't
pulling talent from other groups, but rather creat
ing space for new talent on campus," said Kairam.
"We didn't want to step on the toes of other
groups," continued Trivedi. "So we were really
glad that we could harness talent that wouldn't
have been used."
Freshman Sahil Dhandhia is an example of tal
ent that would have likely gone untapped without
Raagapella's existence. Born and raised in Bom
bay, Dhandhia auditioned and joined Raagapella
because it offered a taste of home.
"I love India," Dhandhia said after his first re
hearsal with the group. His fellow new group
members chuckled with Dhandhia over his au- *
thentic pronunciation of "India." complete with
heavy inflection on the last syllable Although aH
of Raagapella's members are of South Asian de
scent. Dhandhia is the only member who was born
and raised in India.
At their first rehearsal with Ragapella, Dhand
hia and the four other new members joined the
seven returning members around a piano at the
Braun music building to learn One of their first
pieces of music, Sukiyaki. The new members
looked a bit timid as they stood still next to re
turning members who were bouncing to the
rhythm.
But when they closed the rehearsal by singing
"O Carol," there was a look of comfort in their
eyes — "we know how to do this," piped up a
freshman in the back. "We've done this one too
many times now!"

Raagapella creates its own traditions to
stand out among crowded a capella field
Singing, dancing and otherwise
strutting their stuff, members of
Stanford's nine a cappella groups
took to tabling in White Plaza, flyer
ing over campus and performing in
dorms last week to recruit students
to audition for their groups.
No, the number nine wasn't a
typo.
For over a decade, the correct an
swer to the Stanford trivia question,
"How many a cappella groups call
Stanford home?" has been eight.
This year, however, a new group
joined the ranks. Founded in 2(X)2
and officially declared a Stanford a
cappella group by the Office of Stu
dent Affairs this past April, the all
male, Hindi music group Raagapella
joined the formal a cappella audi
tions process this fall.
"The a cappella community is ex
cited about having a new group with
its own new style," said Harmonics
president senior Mvles Morrison.
"Adding another group did make
auditioning scheduling a bit tighter,
but Raagapella was really responsi
ble about not stepping on anyone's
toes."
The two weeks that groups spend
recruiting and holding auditions is
perhaps the most intense time of the
year fora cappella groups. Alumni
come from across the country to
help out and group members get
very little sleep between recruiting,

auditioning and deliberating-as evi
denced by cans of Red Bull and
Moonbeans coffee cups scattered
around the Harmonics' audition
room.
The auditioning process was par
ticularly intense for Raagapella—
group members were lucky to get
three hours of sleep a night. Having
no alumni and only seven returning
members, the group could not field
enough singers to perform at dorm
shows or the O-Show during Orien
tation Week, and it barely had
enough hands to man a table in
White Plaza or post flyers around
campus.
The group focused on recruiting
from the South Asian community,
performing at events sponsored by
the Asian American Students Asso
ciation and the Asian American
New Student Orientation Commit
tee.
On top of the usual workload of
auditions, Raagapella was faced
with the challenge of creating its
own new audition style. Other
groups have already forged their
identities, complete with specific tra
ditions for the audition process —
Counterpoint sings "These are the
Days" when it rolls out its new mem
bers, the Harmonics have their audi
tionees stand on a silver star when
they try out. and Fleet Street throws
a miniature party whenever a poten
tial singer walks into the audition
room.
"The students are auditioning for

groups, but the groups are also audi
tioning for students so we try to he as
enthusiastic as possible and show
our best face," said former Harmon
ics member Matthew Kaufman.
Class of 1997.
"When you walk into an audition
you really get a feeling for what the
group is like — immediately," said
Raagapella president senior Bobby
Ghosh, who has auditioned fora
myriad of a cappella groups over the
past years including the Mendicants,
Mixed Company and Talisman.
Raagapella crafted its auditions
to create the feeling of a group of

laidback guys with tight-knit friend
ships, explained financial officer se
nior Mehul Trivedi.
"We want people to join the
group because they love the music
and stay in the group because they
love the guys," Trivedi said.
The group picked up on other
groups' traditions like hosting a bar
beque before callbacks and cheering
rampantly when auditionees enter
the audition room.
It also created traditions of its
own. For example, they made home-

made t-shirb> with iron-on logos and served burg
ers and hof dogs with chicken curry and manttar
paneer at their barbeque to reflect the group's
goal of fusing 1 lindi and Western music.
Since the group didn't have enough members
or alumni to have someone greet singers when
ihey came to audition, two dedicated fans volun
teered to help out.
"Our volunteer greeters rounded out the feel
ing of a group of guys with a small but dedicated
fan base," said music director Sanjay Kswrim.
The actual auditions took place last Wednes
day and last Thursday. On Thursday night, all the
groups met to coordinate callback schedules for
Friday so there would be nooverlapps. After a full
night of callbacks and deliberations, the group di
rectors met again in Meyer Library at 4 a.m. on
Saturday to sort out which groups get which
singers.
