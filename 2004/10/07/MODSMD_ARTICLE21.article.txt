## Where are the WMDs? 
### ILIAS CHRISSOCHOIDIS 
It's official as death: Iraq had no
weapons of mass destruction. One
thousand Americans and as many
as 25,000 mostly civilian Iraqis
have been slaughtered on the altar
of empty egos in Washington, D.C.
One hundred and fifty billion
dollars (only a fraction of the pro
jected cost) have been snatched
from our future to oil armies of
consultants, squadrons of lobby
ists. and regime-cementing compa
nies.
Let alone the ecological disaster
from depleted uranium ammuni
tion or burning oilfields or lack of
sanitation. Let alone the damaged
health of hundreds of thousands of
Iraqis, the maimed children, the
sick American soldiers and the
world disgust that invading a
sovereign state has generated.
What really matters is the big
boy's mantra "mission accom
plished." Accomplished indeed:
Pandora's Box is now open again.
Of all the evils unleashed to the
world, however, the most horrid is
this: Man defeated his humanity.
Man ignited war, when dialogue
(even a clandestine one) was still
possible. Man broke the law and
destroyed partnerships-in-princi
ples to forge opportunistic al
liances with bought-out states.
And man abused power, manipu
lated evidence and pretended false
emergencies to justify a decision
taken years ago. That this "man" is
America's leadership makes us all
partners in crime.
It is not that we had no clue
about the crime. Here at Stanford
alone, we had been warned about
such plans as early as fall of 2001.
Hans von Sponeck, a former U.N.
assistant secretary, gave a passion
ate presentation on Anglo-Ameri
can efforts to tighten the rope
around Iraq's neck. And months
before last year's invasion. Robert
Fisk predicted with amazing accu
racy the events we are experienc
ing now.
How is it that a British journal
ist could foretell developments
that the mighty American govern
ment proved incapable of contem
plating? The answer is simple. Fisk
is an independent journalist,
whereas the case for invading Iraq
was made by lobbyists for certain
industries and one foreign state.
It was a superb weapon of mass
distraction: from the administra
tion's inability to capture Osama
bin Laden: from a souring econo
my and an alarming unemploy

ment record; from exploding
deficits; and from efforts to yield
even more power and wealth to the
only minority who has never suf
fered in the history of this country.
Mind also that Fisk resides in a
country where the press still ob
serves certain standards. By con
trast, American mainstream media
have turned from bullies to bears
in their coverage of the current ad
ministration.
So much so that some of them
have publicly apologized. Too late,
too crappy. The American couch
citizen has by now formed distort
ed views about Iraq, if not of many
other countries.
One wonders if the official re
port on weapons of mass destruc
tion will deliver a shock of truth to
America's flag patriots.
But it should do something to us
here at Stanford. Our university
has been so strongly linked with
the current administration that any
taint on its record affects our
image. Many of us speculated on
President Hennessy's use of Teddy
Roosevelt in his Orientation week
speech. Was it a gesture of support
or of disapproval for the current
U.S. president?
To be sure, it was not neutral.
And understandably so. Stanford,
both as a community and a re
search university, has a lot at stake.
Prominent members of its faculty
are serving an administration that
in the best of cases has created a
monster in the Middle East and in
the worst has showed incompe
tence in handling international
policy, humanitarian crises and
even military operations.
We may perhaps discount the
lobbyist wing at Hoover Institu
tion. But it becomes an embarrass
ment to claim as our flesh and
blood the iron lady who poses as
liberated descendant of black
slaves and acts as Cinderella to the
household of Texan millionaires.
Whatever the outcome of the
Nov. 2 election may be, we will
have to spend time and effort
clearing our image of these associ
ations.
Admitting the colossal failure
of American civil institutions to re
sist a reckless administration and
prevent the humanitarian disaster
in Iraq is a first step in the road
leading back to our souls.
