Stanford men could use some help
learning to socialize with women
As juniors at this esteemed
university, we have had the plea
sure of attending numerous
evening soirees sponsored by var
ious organizations on campus.
Despite the plethora of up
standing. handsome young men
attending these benefits, we have
not had the satisfaction of actual
ly exchanging niceties with them
besides the usual "Stanford IDs."
We have cause to believe that
this lack of conversation stems
from the University's admittance
of men who have been raised in
an environment that deempha

sizes communication between the
sexes. Perhaps such respectable
young men would deem it inap
propriate to make such advances
or, more likely, are so engaged in
their studies they think it
frivolous.
In actuality, interaction with
the opposite sex is essential for
normal social practice. The apa
thetic attitude toward women
among many male scholars here
has led to an inversion of social
norms, as women have been
forced to resort to more aggres
sive tactics to attract men's atten
tion.
While female-initiated interac
tion is admirable, even these at

tempts are often futile, met with
blank stares or monosyllabic re
sponses.
In our exchanges with our fe
male peers, many of whom are at
tractive, charismatic, and avail
able. our theories have been sub
stantiated. Any insight into this
matter would be greatly appreci
ated.

Edwards clear winner
of vice-presidential debate
The vice-presidential Cheney /
Edwards debate was a sharp con
trast in styles and persona.
Cheney responded to Ed
wards' stinging criticisms with
mean, vindictive and snide re
sponses clearly unaccustomed to
being challenged.
Cheney failed to offer a clear
justification to the premature,
preemptive war on Iraq. He failed
to explain why so few troops were
deployed, which according to
Paul Bremmer contributed to the
lawlessness that took place after
Bush's famous mission accom

plished' declaration.
Cheney insisted that the Bush
Administration made the right
decision but failed to offer con
vincing reasons — no WMD, no
Al Qaeda connection (confirmed
by Donald Rumsfeld). Four more
years of the same — mayhem in
Iraq and Afghanistan, staggering
deficits, lost International friends
and alliances, lost jobs, worsening
health care crisis is not a viable
option.
Edwards clearly won this de
bate by his command of the facts,
his demeanor and his refusal to be
intimidated by Cheney's patron
izing attitude and comments.
In all fairness, it is doubtful if

either candidate has a near term
exit strategy in Iraq. Fortunately,
we do have an exit strategy for
Mr. Bush on Nov. 2.
