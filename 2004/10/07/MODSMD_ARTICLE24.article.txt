### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women sailors claimed the
top spot in the Bryson Women's Invitational
for the first time in three years after impres
sive outings from all of their teams. Hosting
the invitational in Redwood City Saturday
and Sunday, the Cardinal women took first in
both divisions.
Running away with first in the 10-race re
gatta was Stanford's A-Division team, skip
per junior Liz Roundtree and crew senior
Julie Pitts. The duo placed no less than fourth
in its first four races, including coming in first
in the third race. The team did well enough in
the remaining races to finish with 27 points.
The Stanford 2 team also placed highly
over the weekend, taking fifth in the invita

tional with 33 points. Crews sophomore
Alexa Binns and freshman Marianna
Beardsworth shared time with freshman skip
per Evan Brown in the successful effort.
In the B-Division, the Cardinal were just as
successful. Skipper Caroline Young, a sopho
more, and crews sophomore Becca Levine and
senior Ali Salatti finished seven of their 10
races in first or second. By weekend's end, with
21 points, the trio took first in their division.
Sophomore Joanna Madsen and newcomer
Carrie Denning placed sixth.
The Cardinal's top team posted 48 total
points while the Stanford 2 team finished a
few places back with 91.
The Stanford men also saw action in the
Pacific Coast Men's Singlehanded Champi
onships held at Cal's Treasure Island Sailing
Center. Out of the three Cardinal sailors com

peting, sophomore Emery Wager was the
only one to finish in the top five, with seniors
Andy Mesher and Jeff Allen finishing eigth
and ninth respectively.
While Wager competed respectably, he was
unable to lock down the top honor in the regat
ta. Wager led by as many as six points through
out the races but had to settle for second, one
point out of first. Southern California's Mikee
Anderson pulled himself back into first after
dropping back behind Wager earlier in the day.
The Trojans also took third and fourth.
Wager, however, was able to secure a Pa
cific Coast berth for the Intercollegiate Sail
ing Association Singlehanded National
Championships. He travels to Lake Min
netonka. Minn, later this month to represent
the Pacific Coast and compete for the na
tional title.
