have been warned.
The Pastime is back. Following up last
year's red-hot postseason were a pair of
nail-biting races this past weekend. The
playoffs are in gear. St. Louis has the most wins
(105), New York the most hardware (four
rings since 1996) and Minnesota the best pitch
er (Johan Santana). but when it comes to pure
enjoyment, you can't beat the Boston Red
Sox.
Going to school across the river in Cam
bridge. I was surprised by the sheer ferocity of
the fan base. The streets every day were flood
ed with red and dark-blue caps, visors, shirts
and pullovers. Cars were plastered with "B"
stickers.
Sometimes, late at night after a big win. 1
thought it was drawing me in too.
It was a treat to hear Joe Castiglione's radio
calls: "He swings and hits one deep to left. If
it's fair it'sgo-oone! HOME RUN!"
People like to make a big deal about the 86
years since Boston has won a World Series, but
world titles are not the point for me. I care
about good baseball, and the Sox have it.
It starts with leadoff man Johnny Damon, a
reliable singles hitter whose bearded resem
blance to Western images of Christ has only
expanded his fan-favorite status ("What
would Johnny do?").
Consecutive batters Manny Ramirez and
David Ortiz are so übiquitous in their 1-2
power punch that Senator John Kerry mistak
enly referred to "Manny Ortiz" this summer.
Cerebral Curt Schilling and visceral Pedro
Martinez lead a diverse and confident pitching
staff. Run production comes from all over the
order, and they really do seem like a team, not
an assembly of whiny overpaid athletes.
The weak point may be the coaching. Terry
Francona is the latest in a revolving door of
managers, installed last winter after the re
lease of Grady Little. Little's departure was
precipitated by a long series of poor decisions
culminating in the failure to lift a tiring Mar
tinez from the final game of the American
League Championship Series; Pedro allowed
three Bth-inning runs that tied the game and
put the Yankees in position to seal the Ameri
can League pennant.
"Tito" has shown reluctant authority and a
reticence to bunt and steal — not that Boston
is a small-ball outfit, but there were times
when critical runs may have been scored but
fora little offensive risk-taking — but he has
presided over a fantastic run to the postseason.
Much to the indigestion of the Red Sox Na
tion. there have really been three teams this
season: The first burst out of the gate, winning
or tying six straight series and taking six of
seven from New York, including a three-game
sweep in the Bronx.
The second tainted almost every game with
maddening mistakes. Fielding was atrocious;
pitching was thin; injuries racked up; Mark
Bellhorn seemed to lead the league in both er
rors and hitting into double plays.
After trading oft-injured shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra for defensive reinforcements, the
team has taken off again, wresting the wild card
berth away from the AL West and clinching the
season series with New York (11 games to eight).
Home field Fenway Park is the oldest and
smallest stadium in the major leagues, with a re
ported capacity of 33.871. With its pistachio
green walls, cherry-red wooden seats and hand
operated outfield scoreboard, it is a quaint
throwback to the mid-century days when base
ball dominated American sports in all its pas
toral glory. (The food prices will shock you back
into the present, mind you, but use
your imagination.)
Beantown to me seemed an un
likely place for baseball fever, with
its salty shores and East Coast
street city attitude. It's far removed
from the "Field Of Dreams" Mid
western ideal. But looking at it
again, Boston — the seat of liberty,
mother of the Revolution, a proud
city, hardworking and stubborn —
is the perfect place for the ail-
American game.
Before this is a week old. the
BoSox may be off the field for good

(or at least until April). If that hap
pens. 1 won't cry, hang my head or
tear up my Kevin Youkilis t-shirt.
Instead. I will say thank you. Red
Sox. You gave me six months of ex
citement, frustration, pride and hu
mility, offense and defense, power
and finesse, teamwork, heart and
passion. For 162 games, everything I
want to see in a baseball team.
