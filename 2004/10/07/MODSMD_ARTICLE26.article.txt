# Quite the balancing act
## After struggling with his own questions for a year, Thomas Hopkins opens up on finding his footing in water polo 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
One look at Thomas Hopkins, his competitive style of
play and his team-leading 34 goals, and your mouth drops
into an O of awe for what he does in the pool. One look
at the native Hawaiian's work and life outside water polo,
and your jaw drops a few more inches. Aside from being
a civil engineering major and a member of the Kappa
Alpha fraternity, Hopkins is one of the junior class pres
idents this year.
Surely, being Thomas Hopkins can't be all that bad.
Yet being Hopkins isn't as easy as he makes it seem.
There was a time when the Ail-American was not com
pletely sure of the direction his life was heading. During
his freshman year at Stanford. Hopkins questioned why
he was still playing a sport he had been playing since the
fifth grade.
"There was something inside of me," Hopkins re
membered. "I was [just] going through the motions, the
plays."
What bothered him were the burning questions con
cerning his future: Would he put his life on hold and try
out for the 2008 Olympics? What would he do after col
lege graduation? Why was he putting in so much time
into something that would be over in the span of four
years?
It took him the whole year to get over those questions,
including a trip to the 2002 NCAA Championship game
where the Cardinal squad took the national title. It
wasn't until last year that Hopkins got through his self
proclaimed slump.
Working on his own. Hopkins made his own decisions
about his collegiate career — discovering that what he
wanted to do was to play water polo after all.
While no one but Hopkins influenced his own deci
sion, his problem wasn't kept a secret. Because junior
driver Peter Varellas and Hopkins — who met in high
school through the U.S. Junior National Team and who
now share a room in KA — spend a lot of time together
in and outside the pool, Varellas remembers what his
friend went through.
"I try to keep him positive about the [situation], and
encourage him to keep playing." Varellas said. "Some
one like him has so much to offer the sport. Losing him
would be a shame."
The transition from high school to college proved to
be a bit challenging that first year as well. In high school,
Hopkins ruled the athletic scene. He played tennis and
soccer as well as serving as captain of the water polo
team.
"1 was always bigger in high school until senior year,"
Hopkins recalled. "In college I've worked hard in the
weight room. I make up [what I lack in size] with quick
ness and anticipation."
Being the son of two physical education majors might

just contribute to Hopkins' gungho spirit. As children, he.
his older brother Jonathan (now a senior who plays water
polo for UC-San Diego) and his younger sister were ori
ented to participating in athletic activities in Coronado,
Calif. Hopkins remembers playing three to four sports at
a time. But never was Hopkins the type of kid who got
burnt out — he relished it.
"He's the kind of guy that's so athletic, he can pick up
any sport quickly," Varellas said.
Of all the sports he played as a child, Hopkins settled
on the one he liked the best: water polo. He tried out with
his brother and found that the water sport came easy to
him. As it turns out, the years of multi-hour practices
have paid off.
This season the junior driver leads the team in goals.
He scored a career-high eight times in one game earlier
this year. He has also helped the squad to two NCAA
Championships in as many seasons.
In spite of all his success in the game, Hopkins still
finds time to immerse himself in other activities. Aside
from contributing to the top-ranked squad in the nation.
Hopkins is what fellow '06 class president Melanie Kan
nokada calls a "naturally a good leader."
"Our cabinet members and students notice that, and
are therefore optimistic that our events and programs
will be organized and worthwhile," Kannokada added.
Although during water polo season Hopkins admits to

letting his co-presidents step in and pick up some of the
work he is unable to attend to, Hopkins still enjoys his po
sition. In fact, he would only like to meet more of his
classmates.
"He's got this way of seeing the true nature of things,"
said Varellas. who also serves as a member of the '06 cab
inet. "He does it with people; he knows what they think
and he helps them."
This extends to Hopkins' play on the team. He admits
to being "extremely competitive," wanting to win in
style, and wanting to dominate the game. More impor
tantly. however, he knows his team has the ability to
dominate the game.
"One of the best things about him is he makes other
people look really good," Varellas explained. "He un
derstands that's what it takes to make a great team."
And while some professional athletes risk their team's
outcome for their own glory. Hopkins does the opposite.
"If we're down by a goal with a minute left, I want
to win." Hopkins said. "I realize three or four other
guys in the pool are thinking the exact same thing. So I
calm down, take a breath, stay composed and let the
play develop."
"We have all these great players that could be team
leaders," Hopkins continued. "My coach [John Vargas]
says: 'You've got to give up a little bit of yourself for the
good of the team.'"
