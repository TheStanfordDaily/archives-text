# Club Sports Update: Hockey, rugby kick off the season
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN 
We might not like to admit it, but even
here in California, East Coast culture has
a definite influence on our lives. Lacrosse
is a prominent example of this fact. How
ever, there is another, lesser-known sport
that has come to Stanford from the frigid
climates of Harvard and Princeton: ice
hockey.
Despite the sun and the palm trees,
Stanford ice hockey has been relatively
successful. The team has won the Pac-8
Championship several times, even though
the squad's most recent trip to nationals
was several years ago.
But this year's team sees this fact as an
opportunity, not an obstacle.
"I suspect that our team is going to be
the best Stanford team out of the five
years 1 have played here," grad student
Taku Ide said.
Stanford hockey will open its season
with a home game this Friday, Oct. 8
against UC-Davis.
Where's the ice, you ask? A place
called Belmont Iceland, just a 15 minute
CalTrain ride from campus, hosts the

team's practices and home games.
"It has been hard to get fans to show up
consistently to games off-campus," said
junior Joe Bonneau, a forward for the
team. "Most people will tell you that
hockey is one of the best sports to watch
live, so hopefully a lot of students will
make it out to games this year."
Students who attend Stanford hockey
games have more than one reason to do
so. For one thing, these games provide
something to do in the down time before
the campus nightlife gets going.
"We have awesome game times — 9:15
p.m and 8 p.m — which leave enough time
to party after watching one of our games,"
said Ide.
Most of the home games, including the
one tomorrow night, are at 9:15 p.m.. Be
fore these games, students can come to
the rink at 8 p.m. to enjoy a public skating
session. Figure skaters and wall-clingers
alike are encouraged to take advantage of
the flat-rate fee that will give them access
to both the skating hour and an action
packed hockey game.
Players say that games against Califor
nia are particularly fun and rowdy. Home

games against C'al this season will be Nov.
19 and Feb. 5.
The band also comes to some of the
team's games, adding to the lively atmo
sphere.
"One of the reasons we like going so
much is that we are usually some of the
only fans there, and we really have a pres
ence." said senior Amy Blasberg, social
co-chair for the band.
The team hopes that, as a result of the
earlier game times this year, band mem
bers will no longer be the only students in
the stands.
Students who would like to actually be
on the ice at practices and games still have
time to try out for the team this year. As
with almost all club sports at Stanford,
prospective players need no prior experi
ence in the sport.
Everything from skating skills to puck
handling can be taught by Coach Marvin
Hirschel and veteran teammates.
"I grew up in California playing base
ball, football, rugby and water polo."
Bonneau said. "Hockey is a secondary
sport for me, and sometimes it shows on
the ice. But. hey, I love sports, so I really

enjoy getting out there and competing."
A note of caution to ambitious first
time players: ice time is typically given to
the more experienced athletes. However,
beginners who work hard and learn quick
ly have been known to find themselves on
the ice just as much as the veterans.

session. Figure skaters and wall-clingers
alike are encouraged to take advantage of
the flat-rate fee that will give them access
to both the skating hour and an action
packed hockey game.
Players say that games against Califor
nia are particularly fun and rowdy. Home

games against C'al this season will be Nov.
19 and Feb. 5.
The band also comes to some of the
team's games, adding to the lively atmo
sphere.
"One of the reasons we like going so
much is that we are usually some of the
only fans there, and we really have a pres
ence." said senior Amy Blasberg, social
co-chair for the band.
The team hopes that, as a result of the
earlier game times this year, band mem
bers will no longer be the only students in
the stands.
Students who would like to actually be
on the ice at practices and games still have
time to try out for the team this year. As
with almost all club sports at Stanford,
prospective players need no prior experi
ence in the sport.
Everything from skating skills to puck
handling can be taught by Coach Marvin
Hirschel and veteran teammates.
"I grew up in California playing base
ball, football, rugby and water polo."
Bonneau said. "Hockey is a secondary
sport for me, and sometimes it shows on
the ice. But. hey, I love sports, so I really

enjoy getting out there and competing."
A note of caution to ambitious first
time players: ice time is typically given to
the more experienced athletes. However,
beginners who work hard and learn quick
ly have been known to find themselves on
the ice just as much as the veterans.
