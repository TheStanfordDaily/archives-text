# Low-carb trend makes inroads

### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Diet Pepsi. Michelob Light. Total Cereal. In
today's health-conscious culture, it is safe to say
that the average Stanford student's consumer
bundle includes these diet-friendly, low-calorie
products.
But how about Pepsi Edge, Michelob Ultra
and Total Protein? These new products, created
and advertised for their low-carbohydrate con
tent. are the result of an attempt by food com
panies to capitalize on the low-carb, high pro
tein diet trend that has swept the nation over the
past few years.
At Stanford, several dining halls, residences
and on-campus eateries offer low-carb options.
The "Atkins-Friendly chicken and bacon ranch
wrap" is available at Subway. Nearby Tree
house offers two low-carb wraps made with
whole-wheat tortillas.
University dining halls now feature bun-less
burgers and low-carb protein offerings such as
grilled chicken, tofu and fish. In addition, all fa

cilities have salad bars and vegetable dishes to
satisfy vegetarians and vegans as well as carb
curbing dieters.
Rafi Taherian. the acting executive director
for Stanford Dining, is proud of the fact that the
dining services at Stanford are able to anticipate
campus food trends even before students them
selves realize what they want.
"We started thinking about the Atkins diet
before it was ever popular," he said. "It takes
twelve to sixteen months for manufacturing to
respond to a particular demand in the market.
We can actually respond to it much faster."
According to Taherian, Stanford Dining uti
lizes data published by the Culinary Institute of
America and the U.S. Department of Agricul
ture to find out what Americans are eating.
While copies of low-carb diet books are fly
ing off shelves, at Stanford, most students have
not drastically altered their eating habits. Pasta,
bread and cereal remain popular in most food
serving facilities.
