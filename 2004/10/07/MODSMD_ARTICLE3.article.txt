# Low-carb trend makes inroads
## 
### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Diet Pepsi. Michelob Light. Total Cereal. In
today's health-conscious culture, it is safe to say
that the average Stanford student's consumer
bundle includes these diet-friendly, low-calorie
products.
But how about Pepsi Edge, Michelob Ultra
and Total Protein? These new products, created
and advertised for their low-carbohydrate con
tent. are the result of an attempt by food com
panies to capitalize on the low-carb, high pro
tein diet trend that has swept the nation over the
past few years.
At Stanford, several dining halls, residences
and on-campus eateries offer low-carb options.
The "Atkins-Friendly chicken and bacon ranch
wrap" is available at Subway. Nearby Tree
house offers two low-carb wraps made with
whole-wheat tortillas.
University dining halls now feature bun-less
burgers and low-carb protein offerings such as
grilled chicken, tofu and fish. In addition, all fa

cilities have salad bars and vegetable dishes to
satisfy vegetarians and vegans as well as carb
curbing dieters.
Rafi Taherian. the acting executive director
for Stanford Dining, is proud of the fact that the
dining services at Stanford are able to anticipate
campus food trends even before students them
selves realize what they want.
"We started thinking about the Atkins diet
before it was ever popular," he said. "It takes
twelve to sixteen months for manufacturing to
respond to a particular demand in the market.
We can actually respond to it much faster."
According to Taherian, Stanford Dining uti
lizes data published by the Culinary Institute of
America and the U.S. Department of Agricul
ture to find out what Americans are eating.
While copies of low-carb diet books are fly
ing off shelves, at Stanford, most students have
not drastically altered their eating habits. Pasta,
bread and cereal remain popular in most food
serving facilities.

"In the past two years, we have
seen the national trend of in
creased consumption of animal
protein," Taherian said. "Howev
er, here at Stanford we did not ex

perience the same proportion of
[increased] consumption. We still
see a lot of pasta."
Although the Atkins, Zone and
South Beach diets have popular
ized nutritional plans that reduce
carbohydrate intake, chefs on cam
pus gear their menus toward the
notion that a well-balanced diet is
the best way to keep students
healthy. For Renny Wright, the

chef at the Row house Phi Sig, fol
lowing food trends on a whim
could prove to be dangerous for
students who don't take their
lifestyle into account before start
ing a diet.
"The low-carb diets may not be
healthy for younger kids and for
growing boys and girls," he said.
"You're denying the body, and it is
going to rob [nutrients] from some

place else, and it will hurt you."
Such views echo the opinions of
Dr. Keith Ayoob, spokesman for
the American Dietetic Associa
tion, who has argued against the
adoption of low-carb diets such as
the Atkins Diet. He explained that,
among other negative effects, low
carb diets cause healthy glycogen
levels in the body to drop, which
causes fatigue and a weakened
ability to exercise rigorously.
Along with Ayoob, there are a
growing number of critics who be
lieve that low-carb dieting cannot
sustain weight-loss and weight
maintenance in the long term.
"Anytime you eliminate a
food group you are placing your
self at risk," said Mary Duch, nu
trition consultant for Stanford
Dining. "There is no easy fix or
magic pill to controlling weight.
The idea is to respect your body,
eat and be healthy — not having
to look like one of the air
brushed models in magazines."
Duch is aware the promoting
diets, including low-carb diets, at the
dining halls can be a dangerous tactic.
"As in many universities, we
have a serious issue with eating dis
orders. so we are wary of concen
trating on pushing too much diet
ing," Duch said.
According to Taherian, participa
tion in low-carb diets is already begin
ning to diminish on a national level,
and that trend seems to be reinforced

on Stanford's campus today.
"I personally believe that the
quick rise of low-carb diets has
peaked and is on a decline. It will
later level off at a much lower par
ticipation and will continue to be
an option for those who are look
ing fora quick fix," he said.
For those who choose low-carb
offerings as part of their diet, din
ing options on campus are flexible
enough to accommodate these re
quests without making any consid
erable menu changes. Even cam
pus eating clubs — student-run or
ganizations that are not affiliated
with Stanford Dining — find it
quite simple to adjust their menus
to fit a low-carb lifestyle.
General Manager for the Stan
ford Eating Clubs Sarah Williams,
Class of 2004. mentioned that
there only seem to be a handful of
low-carb dieters each year.
"The people that are on low
carb diets are generally very
adamant about [their needs]," she
said. "They are mostly graduate
students, and they tend to be gen
erally older. The only thing they
ask us to do is to keep carbohy
drates separate from the meat and
vegetables, and at least have a sep
arate [low-carb] dish."
These are all requests that could
easily have been made by a vege
tarian or vegan, and so carb-curb
ing dietary needs fit easily into the
dining options that earlier trends

have established in campus menus.
"At Stanford, it's still vegetarians
who have the rule of the world
around here," Williams said.
At other eating clubs on campus,
the story seems to run the same way.
"Salad bars get emptied faster than
they did before," said senior
Nicholas Prionas, general manager
of the Governor's Corner Dining
Societies." But everything else gets
eaten as well."
And in campus houses with
their own chefs, the close relation
ship between residents and their
chefs makes it easy for people to
make special dietary requests.
Rafael Velazquez, who works as
a chef at Tri-Delt, believes that pro
viding a balanced meal supercedes
the need to change menus based on
the current food trend. Velazquez,
who has been trimming the fat off of
chicken for the girls in Tri-Delt for
seven years, found that cooking for
girls lent itself to creating a healthier
list of options.
"Here with the girls, everything is
totally different," he said. "They like
healthy food. Always, for example,
for lunch. I serve different kinds of
salads, fruit, different soups."
And even when he does cook
carb-laden foods like pasta, Ve
lazquez still tries to allow fora great
deal of choice within his menu.
"My menu is very wide," he said.
"If I make pasta today, 1 won't make
it again for six or seven weeks."

orders. so we are wary of concen
trating on pushing too much diet
ing," Duch said.
According to Taherian, participa
tion in low-carb diets is already begin
ning to diminish on a national level,
and that trend seems to be reinforced

on Stanford's campus today.
"I personally believe that the
quick rise of low-carb diets has
peaked and is on a decline. It will
later level off at a much lower par
ticipation and will continue to be
an option for those who are look
ing fora quick fix," he said.
For those who choose low-carb
offerings as part of their diet, din
ing options on campus are flexible
enough to accommodate these re
quests without making any consid
erable menu changes. Even cam
pus eating clubs — student-run or
ganizations that are not affiliated
with Stanford Dining — find it
quite simple to adjust their menus
to fit a low-carb lifestyle.
General Manager for the Stan
ford Eating Clubs Sarah Williams,
Class of 2004. mentioned that
there only seem to be a handful of
low-carb dieters each year.
"The people that are on low
carb diets are generally very
adamant about [their needs]," she
said. "They are mostly graduate
students, and they tend to be gen
erally older. The only thing they
ask us to do is to keep carbohy
drates separate from the meat and
vegetables, and at least have a sep
arate [low-carb] dish."
These are all requests that could
easily have been made by a vege
tarian or vegan, and so carb-curb
ing dietary needs fit easily into the
dining options that earlier trends

have established in campus menus.
"At Stanford, it's still vegetarians
who have the rule of the world
around here," Williams said.
At other eating clubs on campus,
the story seems to run the same way.
"Salad bars get emptied faster than
they did before," said senior
Nicholas Prionas, general manager
of the Governor's Corner Dining
Societies." But everything else gets
eaten as well."
And in campus houses with
their own chefs, the close relation
ship between residents and their
chefs makes it easy for people to
make special dietary requests.
Rafael Velazquez, who works as
a chef at Tri-Delt, believes that pro
viding a balanced meal supercedes
the need to change menus based on
the current food trend. Velazquez,
who has been trimming the fat off of
chicken for the girls in Tri-Delt for
seven years, found that cooking for
girls lent itself to creating a healthier
list of options.
"Here with the girls, everything is
totally different," he said. "They like
healthy food. Always, for example,
for lunch. I serve different kinds of
salads, fruit, different soups."
And even when he does cook
carb-laden foods like pasta, Ve
lazquez still tries to allow fora great
deal of choice within his menu.
"My menu is very wide," he said.
"If I make pasta today, 1 won't make
it again for six or seven weeks."
Diet Pepsi. Michelob Light. Total Cereal. In
today's health-conscious culture, it is safe to say
that the average Stanford student's consumer
bundle includes these diet-friendly, low-calorie
products.
But how about Pepsi Edge, Michelob Ultra
and Total Protein? These new products, created
and advertised for their low-carbohydrate con
tent. are the result of an attempt by food com
panies to capitalize on the low-carb, high pro
tein diet trend that has swept the nation over the
past few years.
At Stanford, several dining halls, residences
and on-campus eateries offer low-carb options.
The "Atkins-Friendly chicken and bacon ranch
wrap" is available at Subway. Nearby Tree
house offers two low-carb wraps made with
whole-wheat tortillas.
University dining halls now feature bun-less
burgers and low-carb protein offerings such as
grilled chicken, tofu and fish. In addition, all fa

cilities have salad bars and vegetable dishes to
satisfy vegetarians and vegans as well as carb
curbing dieters.
Rafi Taherian. the acting executive director
for Stanford Dining, is proud of the fact that the
dining services at Stanford are able to anticipate
campus food trends even before students them
selves realize what they want.
"We started thinking about the Atkins diet
before it was ever popular," he said. "It takes
twelve to sixteen months for manufacturing to
respond to a particular demand in the market.
We can actually respond to it much faster."
According to Taherian, Stanford Dining uti
lizes data published by the Culinary Institute of
America and the U.S. Department of Agricul
ture to find out what Americans are eating.
While copies of low-carb diet books are fly
ing off shelves, at Stanford, most students have
not drastically altered their eating habits. Pasta,
bread and cereal remain popular in most food
serving facilities.

"In the past two years, we have
seen the national trend of in
creased consumption of animal
protein," Taherian said. "Howev
er, here at Stanford we did not ex

perience the same proportion of
[increased] consumption. We still
see a lot of pasta."
Although the Atkins, Zone and
South Beach diets have popular
ized nutritional plans that reduce
carbohydrate intake, chefs on cam
pus gear their menus toward the
notion that a well-balanced diet is
the best way to keep students
healthy. For Renny Wright, the

chef at the Row house Phi Sig, fol
lowing food trends on a whim
could prove to be dangerous for
students who don't take their
lifestyle into account before start
ing a diet.
"The low-carb diets may not be
healthy for younger kids and for
growing boys and girls," he said.
"You're denying the body, and it is
going to rob [nutrients] from some

place else, and it will hurt you."
Such views echo the opinions of
Dr. Keith Ayoob, spokesman for
the American Dietetic Associa
tion, who has argued against the
adoption of low-carb diets such as
the Atkins Diet. He explained that,
among other negative effects, low
carb diets cause healthy glycogen
levels in the body to drop, which
causes fatigue and a weakened
ability to exercise rigorously.
Along with Ayoob, there are a
growing number of critics who be
lieve that low-carb dieting cannot
sustain weight-loss and weight
maintenance in the long term.
"Anytime you eliminate a
food group you are placing your
self at risk," said Mary Duch, nu
trition consultant for Stanford
Dining. "There is no easy fix or
magic pill to controlling weight.
The idea is to respect your body,
eat and be healthy — not having
to look like one of the air
brushed models in magazines."
Duch is aware the promoting
diets, including low-carb diets, at the
dining halls can be a dangerous tactic.
"As in many universities, we
have a serious issue with eating dis
orders. so we are wary of concen
trating on pushing too much diet
