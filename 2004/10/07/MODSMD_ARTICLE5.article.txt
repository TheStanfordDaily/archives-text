# Students satisfied with new laundry facilities

### JOE SEXTON 
Students no longer have to save their
quarters for the laundry machines in their
residence halls. The recently introduced
"Just Like Home" laundry service pro
gram, which lets undergraduates clean
unlimited amounts of laundry fora year
ly fee of $44. has a been a hit with stu
dents.
"I like the change and think that the
flat rate makes it more convenient," said
sophomore Mary Kate Hanlon, who lives
in Toyon. "It's nice to be able to do laun
dry without worrying about whether or
not you can find quarters or if the change
machine is working."
Other students agreed that the old
coin-operated laundry machines are not
missed.
"Now instead of saving my quarters
and doing laundry only once a month, my
clothes are constantly clean," said sopho
more Alai Tseggai, who lives in Mir
rielees.
According to former ASSU Vice Pres
ident Joey Natoli, a senior, students ini
tially needed to be convinced of the now
â€” popular laundry program's merits.
Natoli and former ASSU President
Nadiya Figueroa "helped champion the
idea until it became a reality," Natoli
added.
"The ASSU specifically worked with
Student Housing to understand students'
thoughts on the idea," Natoli said. "Also,
we helped to rouse support among the
student bodv for the idea. Finally, when

the idea was initially announced there
.was some negative sentiment, so we as
sisted in understanding the concerns and
figuring out if the idea was still worth
while."
Only weeks into the new program,
several student concerns have already
been put to rest. Natoli said.
"One of the concerns was that laundry
machines would never be available be

cause students would be doing their laun
dry more often," he said. "However
where I live [Suites] that has so far not
been the case."'
Other students agreed.
"I was concerned about it. but it hasn't
been much of a problem," said junior An
gela Rastegar, who live? in Slavianskii

The coinless washing machines and dryers have been a hit among students tired of
rooting around drawers and pockets for quarters.
