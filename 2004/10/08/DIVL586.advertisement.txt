We'll say this about tomorrow's showdown in South Bend: It will be more competitive than the last time the two
schools met. Stanford (3-1) has likely not forgotten the 57-7 smackdown Notre Dame (3-2) laid upon it in the sea
son finale at home last year. The Cardinal could take a giant step toward securing their first bowl bid since 2001 by
exacting some serious revenge with a win tomorrow. Here are three key matchups to watch:
T.J. Rushing vs. Notre Dame Special Teams
The Cardinal boast the No. 3 kickoff return unit in the nation, primarily thanks to the
sweet moves and quick feet of Rushing. The junior cornerback has averaged 37.6 yards
per return on eight chances thus far, including an electric 99-yard burst fora touchdown
that shifted the momentum in Stanford's 37-10 blowout of Brigham Young. Add to that
the fact that Notre Dame has allowed a kickoff to be returned fora touchdown in two
of its last three games and you have the early makings of another special day from the
Cardinal's special teams. "| Rushing) has done a very good job against some other very
112 * good teams," Willingham said. "We'll have to put in some safeguards to make sure he
/ does not have that kind of success against us."

Notre Dame Starting Lineup
CH Notre Dame DE Justin Tuck
L3 vs. Stanford Offensive Line
Tuck, a senior, was a pass-rushing truck in Notre Dame's IT*
57-7 win at Stanford Stadium last season. The 6-foot-5,261-
pound converted linebacker recorded seven tackles and a ,
career-high four sacks to set the Notre Dame single-season
sack record with 13.5. Tuck is back at it again this season p*
with 3.5 sacks and a team-high five tackles fora loss. Stan
ford has allowed 11 sacks through four games this season,
including three in each of the last three games

Willingham has won the first two games against his ex-team by a
combined score of 88-14. Ouch. While the outcome of tomor
row's game will ultimately come down to the level of execution
by the players on the field, solid play stems in part from solid
play-calling. So who will dictate the better game plan? Will one
or both coaches reach into his bag of tricks?

We'll say this about tomorrow's showdown in South Bend: It will be more competitive than the last time the two
schools met. Stanford (3-1) has likely not forgotten the 57-7 smackdown Notre Dame (3-2) laid upon it in the sea
son finale at home last year. The Cardinal could take a giant step toward securing their first bowl bid since 2001 by
exacting some serious revenge with a win tomorrow. Here are three key matchups to watch:
T.J. Rushing vs. Notre Dame Special Teams
The Cardinal boast the No. 3 kickoff return unit in the nation, primarily thanks to the
sweet moves and quick feet of Rushing. The junior cornerback has averaged 37.6 yards
per return on eight chances thus far, including an electric 99-yard burst fora touchdown
that shifted the momentum in Stanford's 37-10 blowout of Brigham Young. Add to that
the fact that Notre Dame has allowed a kickoff to be returned fora touchdown in two
of its last three games and you have the early makings of another special day from the
Cardinal's special teams. "| Rushing) has done a very good job against some other very
112 * good teams," Willingham said. "We'll have to put in some safeguards to make sure he
/ does not have that kind of success against us."

Tuck, a senior, was a pass-rushing truck in Notre Dame's IT*
57-7 win at Stanford Stadium last season. The 6-foot-5,261-

career-high four sacks to set the Notre Dame single-season
sack record with 13.5. Tuck is back at it again this season p*
with 3.5 sacks and a team-high five tackles fora loss. Stan

Willingham has won the first two games against his ex-team by a
combined score of 88-14. Ouch. While the outcome of tomor
row's game will ultimately come down to the level of execution
by the players on the field, solid play stems in part from solid
play-calling. So who will dictate the better game plan? Will one
or both coaches reach into his bag of tricks?
