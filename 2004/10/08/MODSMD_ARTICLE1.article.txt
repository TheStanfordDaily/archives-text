## Teevens, Cardinal head to South Bend for third crack at Willingham 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the two years since Tyrone Willingham left
Stanford to coach Notre Dame's football team, he's
had his share of struggles. The Fighting Irish were just
5-7 last year and are an inconsistent 3-2 this year.
Of course, you wouldn't know that from watching
Stanford play Willingham's squad. Buddy Teevens'
Cardnnal fell 31-7 in an emotional 2002 game in South
Bend, and then the Irish handed Stanford the worst
home loss in program history last year, 57-7.
But, the Cardinal will tell you, this year is different.
Two years and 16 losses later, Teevens and the Cardi
nal (21-1, 1-1 Pacific-10 Conference) look like a new
squad. They feel that way, too.
"We've been in a bunch of different situations, and
I think we've felt all the emotions that we can as a
football team," sophomore quarterback Trent Ed
wards said after last Saturday's win over Washington.
"That's what separates this year's team from the last
two years. We expect to win every game."
Tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. Pacific time, in front of a
packed Notre Dame Stadium and a national televi
sion audience on NBC, Stanford will get its big chance
to prove how far it has come.
"It's certainly an important game," Teevens said at
Tuesday's press conference. "Going out in front of a
nationwide audience and playing in a special place
that is historic like Notre Dame is big."
But what about last year's embarrassing loss, Will
ingham s history with Stanford and all those other dis
traction s that were so apparent in South Bend two
years ago, when emotional Cardinal congregated on
the field after the game with their former head coach?
"Our team is full of forward-thinking people and
players that work toward their goals and ambitions,"
Teevens said.
Willingham concurred.
"Some of them were recruited by myself, [and]
hopefully they have some fond memories of our rela
tionship,'' he said. "But when the game starts, I'm
quite sure they will forget who is on the other side and
see only Notre Dame and see only that they want to
defeat Notre Dame."
In other words: The past is out the window.
Notre Dame, like Stanford, is seeking to better de
fine its place in the national picture and in the hunt for

an eventual bowl-game berth. Both polled on the
fringes of the AP Top 25 poll, with Stanford receiving
15 votes and Notre Dame two, making them the 31 st
and 35th-ranked teams in Division I-A (117 schools).
That, of course, leaves both schools with a lot to
prove.
