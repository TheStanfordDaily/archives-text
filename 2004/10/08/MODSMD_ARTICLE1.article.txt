## Teevens, Cardinal head to South Bend for third crack at Willingham 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the two years since Tyrone Willingham left
Stanford to coach Notre Dame's football team, he's
had his share of struggles. The Fighting Irish were just
5-7 last year and are an inconsistent 3-2 this year.
Of course, you wouldn't know that from watching
Stanford play Willingham's squad. Buddy Teevens'
Cardnnal fell 31-7 in an emotional 2002 game in South
Bend, and then the Irish handed Stanford the worst
home loss in program history last year, 57-7.
But, the Cardinal will tell you, this year is different.
Two years and 16 losses later, Teevens and the Cardi
nal (21-1, 1-1 Pacific-10 Conference) look like a new
squad. They feel that way, too.
"We've been in a bunch of different situations, and
I think we've felt all the emotions that we can as a
football team," sophomore quarterback Trent Ed
wards said after last Saturday's win over Washington.
"That's what separates this year's team from the last
two years. We expect to win every game."
Tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. Pacific time, in front of a
packed Notre Dame Stadium and a national televi
sion audience on NBC, Stanford will get its big chance
to prove how far it has come.
"It's certainly an important game," Teevens said at
Tuesday's press conference. "Going out in front of a
nationwide audience and playing in a special place
that is historic like Notre Dame is big."
But what about last year's embarrassing loss, Will
ingham s history with Stanford and all those other dis
traction s that were so apparent in South Bend two
years ago, when emotional Cardinal congregated on
the field after the game with their former head coach?
"Our team is full of forward-thinking people and
players that work toward their goals and ambitions,"
Teevens said.
Willingham concurred.
"Some of them were recruited by myself, [and]
hopefully they have some fond memories of our rela
tionship,'' he said. "But when the game starts, I'm
quite sure they will forget who is on the other side and
see only Notre Dame and see only that they want to
defeat Notre Dame."
In other words: The past is out the window.
Notre Dame, like Stanford, is seeking to better de
fine its place in the national picture and in the hunt for

an eventual bowl-game berth. Both polled on the
fringes of the AP Top 25 poll, with Stanford receiving
15 votes and Notre Dame two, making them the 31 st
and 35th-ranked teams in Division I-A (117 schools).
That, of course, leaves both schools with a lot to
prove.

Third-year head coach Tyrone Willinqham didn't have much reason to smile after
last week's 41-16 loss to Purdue, but me Irish did upset Michigan earlier this year.
throw the ball, and they're protecting him we:ll,"
Teevens said. "But they have talented running
backs and a physical offensive line as well, so 1
think they'll mix and match running the ball with
throwing it."
Freshman Darius Walker's grinding ground
game has produced averages of 25 carries and 89
yards per game as well as three touchdowns. Ju
nior Rashon Powers-Neal has just seven carries
all season, but he has extensive college experi
ence and is more than capable of spelling Vv'alk
er.
Indeed, the up-and-down Willingham era has
produced a team rich in young talent and proven
veterans. Former starting quarterback Carlyle
Holiday, for example, is spending his senior year
as a punt returner.
The hard part for the Irish hasn't been getting
production. Last week, they rolled up an aston
ishing 460 passing yards, but scored onliy two
touchdowns and lost by 25 points, thanks ;in part
to seven sacks, a stagnant ground game an d poor
defense.
"It's that same old good and bad," Willing
ham said. "You are kind of always juggling and
walking that tight wire of being good in one area
sometimes and not good enough at other times."
Stanford will counter with a much stronger
passing attack than Notre Dame saw from it the
last two seasons. Sophomore Edwards is averag
ing 230 yards through the air per game —
fourth-best in the Pac-10 — and has thrown
seven touchdowns against four interceptnons.
He has four main targets, each of whom has
caught 12 or more passes. Evan Moore, Mark
Bradford. Alex Smith and Justin McCullum
combine to average 218 receiving yards per
game.
Thanks to runs of 82, 58 and 54 yards during
the last two weeks, J.R. Lemon is the new leader
for the Cardinal rushing attack. He's averaging
an impressive 6.9 yards per carry, has scored four
touchdowns and ranks fourth in the Pac-10 in
rushing yards per game (84.0).
"His success is a combination of his running
and the play of the offensive line," Teevens said.
"He's very confident and he's breaking tackles,
which is a huge thing for us. The fact that we've
been able to throw the football is another reason
that our running game has had some success."
Lemon has a capable partner in Kenneth
Tolon. last year's rushing leader, who' is averag
ing 4.4 yards per carry and 41.8 yards per game
and has scored twice.
Stanford has an edge on special teams. Kick
returner T.J. Rushing is averaging 37.6 yards per
return and has one touchdown, and the punt-re
turn unit blocked two punts last week. Notre
Dame, meanwhile, allowed a 100-yard kickoff
return last week.
The Stanford defense has been strong, too, al
lowing just 14.2 points per game and only 85.5
rushing yards per game, the best mark, in the Pac
-10. Notre Dame has yielded 21.6 points per
game.
This is a different Cardinal squad than in
years past, and the Fighting Irish know it.
"They have got one loss, that one loss to co
national champion USC, and they took them
right down to the wire." Willingham said. "Stan
ford is coming to town probably the best that
we've seen them in the last two years."
