# Rec gyms not working out for students

Freshman Jordi Handcox has been
on campus for less than three weeks
but has already made one observation
about Stanford: "It seems around here
if you're not a Varsity athlete, gym
time and athletic facilities become a
real issue." she said.
With many Stanford students de
scribing the machines at Tresidder Fit
ness Center as "sparse" and complain
ing about the "intimidating" equip
ment and inconvenient times at Arril
laga Family Sports Center, there has
been a trend among students to ac
quire memberships at off-campus
gyms.
In response to increasing outside
gym use and student dissatisfaction
with current facilities, the Athletics
Department is building a new recre
ation center next to Arrillaga to be
completed this summer.
Sherry Posthumus, assistant athlet
ic director, agreed that a new facility is
necessary.
"[The popularity of outside gyin
memberships is] the reason we're
building a new rec center," she said.
""We need to have something for the
students, and we just have not had that
sufficiently to this point. Four or five
years ago when Tresidder was put in, it
served its purpose, but we grew out of
it within a short period of time."
Sophomore Radhika Zopey decid
ed to start using 24 Hour Fitness be
cause it offered "so many more ma
chines" than Tresidder and offered a

number of free classes. With a family
discount, she pays between five and
seven dollars a month.
In addition to the extra fees, Zopey
must also make the commute from
campus to the gym. Despite that,
Zopey said it is worth the time driving
to Mountain View to exercise.
"I feel like I get more out of it than
going to Tresidder because you don't
have to wait in line fora machine and
don't have a time limit," she said.
An employee at 24 Hour Fitness in
Mountain View estimates that rough
ly 20 Stanford students visit the gym
daily.
Dave Shinsky, assistant athletic di
rector for capital planning, was in
volved in the building of Tresidder
gym and is now also helping with the
organization of the new recreation
center.
He noted that dissatisfaction with
the current cardiovascular facilities at
Tresidder can be attributed to a shift
ing interest from weight lifting to car
dio equipment among Stanford stu
dents and in the exercise industry as a
whole.
Some of the biggest complaints re
garding Tresidder are that it only has a
total of three treadmills, 12 bike ma
chines and 14 stairmasters, with a 20-
minute limit on the cardio equipment.
While Arrillga has a much wider va
riety of machines, students complain
about the limited hours and varsity
