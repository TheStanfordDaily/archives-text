# Rec gyms not working out for students

### COURTNEY WEAVER 
Freshman Jordi Handcox has been
on campus for less than three weeks
but has already made one observation
about Stanford: "It seems around here
if you're not a Varsity athlete, gym
time and athletic facilities become a
real issue." she said.
With many Stanford students de
scribing the machines at Tresidder Fit
ness Center as "sparse" and complain
ing about the "intimidating" equip
ment and inconvenient times at Arril
laga Family Sports Center, there has
been a trend among students to ac
quire memberships at off-campus
gyms.
In response to increasing outside
gym use and student dissatisfaction
with current facilities, the Athletics
Department is building a new recre
ation center next to Arrillaga to be
completed this summer.
Sherry Posthumus, assistant athlet
ic director, agreed that a new facility is
necessary.
"[The popularity of outside gyin
memberships is] the reason we're
building a new rec center," she said.
""We need to have something for the
students, and we just have not had that
sufficiently to this point. Four or five
years ago when Tresidder was put in, it
served its purpose, but we grew out of
it within a short period of time."
Sophomore Radhika Zopey decid
ed to start using 24 Hour Fitness be
cause it offered "so many more ma
chines" than Tresidder and offered a

number of free classes. With a family
discount, she pays between five and
seven dollars a month.
In addition to the extra fees, Zopey
must also make the commute from
campus to the gym. Despite that,
Zopey said it is worth the time driving
to Mountain View to exercise.
"I feel like I get more out of it than
going to Tresidder because you don't
have to wait in line fora machine and
don't have a time limit," she said.
An employee at 24 Hour Fitness in
Mountain View estimates that rough
ly 20 Stanford students visit the gym
daily.
Dave Shinsky, assistant athletic di
rector for capital planning, was in
volved in the building of Tresidder
gym and is now also helping with the
organization of the new recreation
center.
He noted that dissatisfaction with
the current cardiovascular facilities at
Tresidder can be attributed to a shift
ing interest from weight lifting to car
dio equipment among Stanford stu
dents and in the exercise industry as a
whole.
Some of the biggest complaints re
garding Tresidder are that it only has a
total of three treadmills, 12 bike ma
chines and 14 stairmasters, with a 20-
minute limit on the cardio equipment.
While Arrillga has a much wider va
riety of machines, students complain
about the limited hours and varsity

Many students who work out at Tresidder Fitness Center
complain of the lack of equipment available.
athlete presence.
Zopey has never been to Arrilla
ga, hut she has heard from friends
that it is intimidating to go work out
where there is such a large percent
age of varsity athletes.
Freshman Briana Beltran agrees.
"If you're a tiny girl. [Arrillaga]
sucks," complained Beltran. "All
they have are big weight machines
and bike machines. I ride my bike all
day; 1 don't want to work out on a
bike machine."
Other students complain about
the restricted hours. The weight
room does not open until 11 a.m. and
then closes in the middle of the day
for two and a half hours during the
week. It is also only open fora total
of four hours on Sunday.
Arrillaga's hours are a problem

New gym for
students

for freshman Chase Grayson.
"I think we have an amazing gym
with a variety of equipment, but I
just think that some of the hours are
inconvenient for non-athletes."
Grayson said.
Due to transportation hassles and
the extra cost of using an off-campus
facility, Grayson would not consider
having an outside gym membership.
The new 77.(XX) square foot ath
letic facility will offer features such
as eight squash courts, a large aero
bic / dance space and a climbing
wall. Its weight and cardio room will
be roughly the same size as the one
located in Arriallga. Shinsky fore
sees equipment more like that of a
24-Hour Fitness and less like the cur
rent machines at Arrillaga and
Tresidder.
