### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hip-hop artist Talib Kweli will headline
this year's Big Game concert on Nov. 20, the
Stanford Concert Network announced last
night.
Tickets will be on sale at the Stanford Tick
et Office on Friday, Oct. 15. and will also be
available from 12 to 1 p.m. that day in White
Plaza. They will cost $17 with an SUID card
and $23 without.
In an effort to ensure students get first pri
ority in ticket sales, SCN is sponsoring a dorm
pre-sale. Resident advisors can reserve a bloc
of tickets for their dorms before they are re

leased to the general public.
The three dorms with the largest percent
age of ticket-buying residents will get the best
seats at the venue. Memorial Auditorium.
Kweli has been a longtime critical favorite,
both as one half of the duo Black Star (along
with Mos Def) and as a solo artist. His latest
album, "The Beautiful Struggle," was re
leased two weeks ago. USA Today gave the
album four stars.
The video for the album's first single, "I
Try," was deemed "buzzworthy" by MTV and
is currently on heavy rotation on the net
work's airwaves.
SCN director Alida Garcia, a senior, said
signing Kweli marked a major achievement

for the Stanford music community.
"Talib Kweli is well respected in the hip
hop game in terms of credibility and lyrical tal
ent," she said.
The Maximum, a Bay Area group, will
open for Kweli. Garcia compared the Maxi
mum to the Roots, a popular hip-hop group
with an inventive sound. The Maximum re
cently toured with Michael Franti & Spear
head.
Garcia said this year's Big Game concert
addresses a long-standing demand for live hip
hop at Stanford.
"SCN has been trying to get a good hip-hop
show fora while — last year we didn't have
one, so we really wanted one this year."
