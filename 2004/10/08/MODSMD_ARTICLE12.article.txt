# Lake construction to prevent flooding
## 
### NANCY WANG 
Joggers around Lake Lagunita may have
noticed that the lake is not filled with water
right now, hut instead with construction.
The Stanford Utilities Division is currently
installing a flood-control outlet valve on the
west side of Lake Lagunita to help control po
tential floods from water runoff during years
with high amounts of rain.
The construction is not expected to signifi
cantly disturb the habitat of the lake or normal
activity around the lake.
The valve will allow the lake to de-water
after a storm,. so that the lake will be able to

collect water from the next storm. Construc
tion on the valve is estimated to continue for
another four weeks.
Alan Launer, a biologist and research asso
ciate with the Stanford Center for Conserva
tion Biology, stressed the importance of the
construction.
"The floods of 1998 spooked everyone suf
ficiently enough that an improved Lagunita
drain was designed," Launer said.
Launer has worked closely with the con
struction team to make sure that the endan
gered tiger salamanders that live in the lake
during the rainy season are not disturbed.
Tom Zigterman, associate director of utili

ties, added that the valve will prevent the de
struction of the dam at Lake Lagunita, allow
ing the lake to remain a water-holding facility
and, as a result, salamander-friendly.
"There will be some destruction of the
pathway along the top of damn, hut that will
be only temporary and everything will be re
stored," Zigterman said.
The policy toward the filling of the lake will
also be unchanged by construction.
"Based on how much runoff goes in the
lake, we may supplement it with water from
runoff creeks," said Zigterman. "During a dry
or average rain season, however, the lake is
not intentionallv filled."
