# Europeans can't get enough of capri pants on men. But will the trend catch on at Stanford?

Fashionability is all about functionality for Julie. "When
I'm at school, it has to be bikeable," she said. When asked
about the bikeability of the short jean skirt she was wearing,
she coyly replied: "This skirt is a lot longer than it could be."
But Julie is somewhat of a fashion chameleon, changing her
styles between campus life and her home in Arizona. "Blous
es are a joke," she made perfectly clear. Julie added, "Capri
pants [on males] are okay, and so are guys in overalls."
When asked if there was any connection between Capri
pants and overalls, she replied that both are generally disliked
by the same kind of people, "those who can't handle 'cutesy'
fashion." However, one thing her major has taught her is that
though Capri pants may be popular in Russia, overalls are not.

Chris is sporting the sleeveless headphones-on-a-bicycle look. The
approach is entirely about fashion at the expense of utility — the bike
has no gears and the headphones are plugged into a special spot on the
bike handle incapable of playing music. Chris opted against the cur
rent hot trend of white headphones for the old-school black-head
phones look. When asked about current styles on campus, he said:
"Girls are really getting into those short ruffly skirts. And dudes,
dudes are really liking those tight fitting shirts." When asked his opin
ion regarding Capri pants on gentlemen, he responded with a re
sounding, "Hell Yeah!"

Man in capri pants

Molly was quick to point out that everyone has their own style.
"Sweats and t-shirts are pretty popular around here, but cowboy
hats and boots are coming back, too." She was also very excited
about the idea that Capri pants might finally be catching on for
Stanford men. "Oh my god. I was in Europe, and everyone was
wearing them. It was hilariously beautiful and exciting." She said
that she would not necessarily be more or less attracted to men
wearing Capri pants, but that she appreciated the thoughtfulness
such pants implied. "When I see a guy wearing Capri pants, 1 know
he's thinking about wearing Capri pants."

After several rounds of
questioning to ensure that
we were, in fact, from The
Daily. Shila shared her opin
ion on the current state of
fashion at Stanford. Mod
fashions with dots, solid col
ors and an "Andy Warhol"
feel are in. But Sheila won't
just buy her clothes from
anyone. "There are certain
brands I'll avoid: Gap, Old
Navy, and Child Labor."
When asked whether her
yoga mat could be consid
ered trendy, she explained,
"Any kind of Eastern thing is
getting into style." She was
down on the Capri-for-men
question, but added, "I just
want to make sure you're not
crazy people."

Alejandro complains that in
graduate school, there is not
enough fashion sense. Except, he
noted with disdain, perhaps at the
business school. Alenjandro em
phatically told us that, yes, "Capri
pants are COOL [on men] ...
though not very popular in Mexi
co."
For picking his daily wardrobe,
Alejandro fell back on the classic
graduate student answer of,
"whatever's clean." But for shop
ping, he had a slightly more per
sonal approach. "When you shop,
you need to maximize your fash
ion — think of the other sex, man
— subject to the constraints of
your Stanford stipend."
