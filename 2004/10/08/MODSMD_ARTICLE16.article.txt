## Editorial President wisely rejected sculpture 
### 
Last week. President Hennessy made the deci
sion to not acquire Dennis Oppenheim's
sculpture "Device to Root Out Evil." Al
though the decision has been criticized by
some as censorship, we believe the University's actions
were appropriate given the nature of the situation.
If this work had been acquired, it would not have
been on display in Cantor Arts Center merely as a piece
of art. Rather, it would have been added to the Univer
sity's collection of outdoor art. Having such a work dis
played in a public space means that it would be more
than ]ust a work of art. It would come to symbolize the
University itself by being an integral part of campus.
Art is, by its very nature, subjective. The same
piece of artwork can be interpreted by different peo
ple in different ways. Some might appreciate it; oth
ers might find it ugly. It has the potential to be intel
lectually or emotionally stimulating. It also has the
potential to be offensive, if it is interpreted as such.
This particular work's meaning was especially am
biguous. Oppenheim claimed the work was about a
fusion of sculpture and architecture, having nothing
to do with religion. Tom Seligman, the director of the
Cantor Arts Center, although dissatisfied with the
University's decision, disputed that the work could
be entirely removed from religion and politics.
We agree with Seligman that it is hard to believe
the work, featuring an upside-down church with its
steeple wedged into the ground, is not intended to be
interpreted in a religious or political light. According
to Jeff Wachtel, assistant to President Hennessy,
"The president was not afraid that the sculpture
might be offensive but was certainly sensitive to the
impact it might have on the community."
Some people could interpret the sculpture as of
fensive to Christians. We hope that the president
would treat this sculpture as carefully as he would a
piece of art that was offensive to Jews or Muslims or
any other religion.
Hut this is not to say that the University should not

acquire controversial works at all. In fact, the Univer
sity certainly has acquired controversial works of art
in the past. The difference, though, is that these works
put forward a positive message of inclusion and ac
ceptance instead of an arguably negative one against
a certain religion.
For example, the "Gay Liberation" sculpture by
George Segal was installed on campus in 1984. Locat
ed between the physics and mathematics buildings, it
consists of bronze figures of a gay male couple and a
lesbian couple on a park bench. The work was vandal
ized that same year, evidence of its controversial na
ture. The sculpture touches on a controversial subject
— homosexuality — yet it is not at all disparaging to
any other groups, such as heterosexuals.
In addition to the concerns over the impact on the
community, there were other more practical concerns
raised as well regarding the "Device to Root Out Evil"
sculpture. According to Wachtel, these factors includ
ed aesthetics, the sitting of the piece, and the costs as
sociated with securing and maintaining it.
The University clearly has no opposition to Oppen
heim himself, as it already owns four of his works in the
museum. Additionally, although the University did not
acquire this particular work, it said it has not precluded
the possibility of acquiring any of his future works.
And although Oppenheim said that his agreement
with the University was broken, no official contracts
were signed. Stanford made no promise to buy the
piece. The decision passed commitee, but it was un
derstood that the president still had the authority to
reject it.
In addition to arguments against the work, no one
has offered any compelling reasons to actually buy it.
Many have found the piece unattractive. The artist de
signing it said that it had cost him over $ 1 (K).(KX) to cre
ate, so it is clear the piece would be expensive to buy.
And the sculpture's unclear message offers little justi
fication for its purchase. Ultimately, Hennessy made
the right decision rejecting the piece.
