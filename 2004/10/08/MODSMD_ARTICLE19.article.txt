## Country needs some real standards for our teachers 
### TERRY MOE 
No Child Left Behind is best
known as a landmark and contro
versial effort by the federal gov
ernment to hold public schools ac
countable for their performance by
means of standards and tests.
It is also a landmark in another,
less publicized sense: It requires
that all academic courses in every
public school be taught by highly
qualified teachers. This teacher re
quirement is unprecedented, and it
has great promise.
There is a fly in the ointment,
however: a problem in the way
NCLB is currently written and exe
cuted that undermines its own ef
forts to improve teacher quality.
This is a problem that our political
leaders are ignoring, and they
shouldn't be.
On the surface, NCLB's ap
proach makes sense. It mandates
that to be highly qualified a teacher
must not only have a bachelor's de
gree and be certified, which the
states already require, but also
demonstrate competence in the sub
ject being taught.
This is the great innovation of the
act: It requires competence.
For new teachers, competence
can be demonstrated by having a
college major in the relevant subject
or by taking a rigorous test of knowl
edge.
Veteran teachers can demon
strate competence in these same
ways.
Or they can do it by meeting a
high, objective, uniform state stan
dard of evaluation (HOUSSE),
which the states are allowed to de
vise on their own.
Herein lies the problem.
The HOUSSE provisions create
a loophole big enough to drive three
million veteran teachers through,
and the states have incentives to do
just that.
They are under intense political
pressure, especially from the teach
ers unions, to protect the interests
of veteran teachers and to ensure
that no one loses a job. It is no acci
dent that bad teachers have long
been virtually impossible to re
move from high school classrooms
in this country.
And it is no accident that most

states are now designing their
HOUSSE standards to ensure that
every veteran teacher can meet
them, regardless of their true levels
of competence.
How do the states pull off this
charade?
By stipulating that their veteran
teachers are not required to take
substantive tests or have the rele
vant college majors, but can in
stead gain highly qualified status
through some combination of
teaching experience, classes in pro
fessional development, self-com
piled portfolios, supervisor evalua
tions and other factors that can eas
ily produce positive outcomes for
every teacher.
In Arkansas, for example, teach
ers with five years experience auto
matically satisfy the HOUSSE stan
dard and become highly qualified to
teach in high schools.
In Ohio and Massachusetts,
teachers can meet the standard by
simply racking up enough hours in
professional development courses.
In New Hampshire, teachers
can do it by engaging in a self-as
sessment with a supervisor and a
partner.
And so it goes, for virtually
every state, making a mockery of
the law and ensuring that incompe
tent and mediocre teachers will not
be weeded out.
This is a national travesty. The
solution is for Congress to modify
NCLB by eliminating the
HOUSSE option, and requiring
that all veteran teachers either
have a college major in their sub
ject area or pass a rigorous test of
substantive competence.
The purpose of our public
school system is to see that our
children are receiving a quality ed
ucation, not to protect the jobs of
the adults who are hired to teach
them.
Especially if they can't demon
strate that they are knowledgeable
enough to do so.
