# Willingham and Irish in the MIDST OF A ROLLER-COASTER YEAR

### ALEX GYR 
As Stanford moves into Saturday's game against
Notre Dame, the question Buddy Teevens and the
Cardinal must ask is, "Which Notre Dame team will
Stanford see?"
Will it be the team that knocked off then-eighth-

ranked Michi
gan 28-20, or
will it be the one
that was
trounced 41-16
at home by Pur
due?
It cer
tainly has been
an up and down
year for the
Fighting Irish
who enter to
morrow's game
at Notre Dame
Stadium with a
puzzling 3-2
record.
Coming
into the 2004
season, there
were already
questions about
this Notre
Dame team.
The team fin
ished the 2003
season with a
disappointing
5-7 record — its
third losing sea
son in the last
five years —
something that
had never hap
pened in the
school's long
football history.

Notre Dame opened the 2004 season facing BYU in
Provo, Utah, hoping to move past last season's losing
record. But the Irish were unable to stop the Cougars

late and fell on the road 20-17.
This opening-game loss marked only the third time
in the last 18 seasons that Notre Dame had lost their
opening game.
The key statistic in this game was Notre Dame's in
ability to move the ball on the ground. The Irish of
fense looked one-dimensional, as it racked up only 26
yards rushing compared to 265 through the air. The
Irish were also forced to punt 11 times, their most in a
game since 1982.
A pivotal play came late in the fourth quarter when
BYU had the ball on a third-and-long play. Notre
Dame needed a stop to get the ball back fora chance to
win or send the game into overtime. But Cougars back
up quarterback Matt Berry completed a 37-yard pass,
allowing BYU to run out the clock and pick up the vic
tory.
Notre Dame actually rescheduled the game with
BYU ahead of the Michigan game so that it would have
an easier opening-game opponent.
Notre Dame's only other loss of the season came
last week against a very good Purdue team led by Heis
man Trophy candidate Kyle Orton.
While the Irish were playing from behind for most
the game, the Boilermakers held Notre Dame to only
76 yards on the ground.
Notre Dame also had little success in stopping
Orton, who is arguably the best quarterback in the na
tion. He torched the Irish defense for 385 yards and
four touchdowns in the win.
Special teams also presented a major concern for
Notre Dame, as Purdue's Jerome Brooks returned a
kickoff 100 yards fora touchdown in the first quarter,
putting Notre Dame in an early hole.
While Notre Dame did have problems in their two
losses, they also picked up three impressive wins
against Big Ten and Pac-10 opponents.
Without a doubt. Notre Dame's best game of the
season came against Michigan in a must-win situation.
After their loss to BYU, there was talk in the national
media that Tyrone Willingham was on the hot seat.
Even Willingham admitted importance of the
Michigan game.
"I believe that because of the prominence of this
game and the tradition that it's had and the success that
the teams have had. that this game becomes extremely
