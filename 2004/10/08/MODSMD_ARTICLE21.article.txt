Leave the Dollies alone
The debate between Dollies and
Cardinal Competitive Cheer has
gotten ridiculous ("Cheerleaders de
serve spot on field," Oct. 7). I don't
know what Glenn Truitt's purpose
was in attacking the Dollies in her
piece yesterday, but the last time I
checked, law students were sup
posed to at least consider facts be
fore making opinionated claims.
So, I'd like to propose a few facts
not to attack or to defend but simply
to turn this conversation away from
the aimless bickering it has become.
First, Dollies spend between 20
and 30 hours a week practicing or
wearing that little red dress. To say
they don't work hard is ludicrous.
Period.
Second, former Dollies include a
Seattle Sonic girl, Miss Dance USA,
the tumbling champion of Kansas
and a recruit for the Rockettes.
Please don't tell me Dollies aren't
talented.
Third, the 30-something dances
Dollies have in their repertoire are
composed half of new choreography
and half of pieces choreographed by
former Dollies. This includes dances
a long time ago, which may look out
of place, but which are the epitome
of Stanford tradition. Anyone who
knows anything about it appreciates
seeing those routines
Fourth. Dollies don't yell, never
have yelled and never will yell. That
is why there are yell leaders.
Fifth, Dollies go wherever the

Band goes, including every women's
volleyball, football, and men's and
women's basketball game no matter
what the crowd size, no matter what
the weather, no matter if all five dol
lies have the flu and midterms the
next day.
I respect Cardinal Competitive
Cheer for their talent, their motiva
tion and their sport.
And I think there is a way for the
two organizations to work together.
But discounting the dedication, the
hard work and the tradition of the
Dollies isn't going to get anyone any
where.
If you really want to represent
Stanford, you have to understand
that Dollies are part of the Stanford
tradition. So let's leave the attacks at
the gate and start thinking about a
feasible solution.

Save abandoned cats at Stanford
I read with interest your article,
"Furry, but forbidden: Students
house pets on campus" (Oct. 6).
Last week near a co-op I saw a
student sitting on a log, doting on an
adorable, orange, tabby kitten wear
ing a collar playing nearby.
She was gone before I could ask
her to please keep him indoors, to
use only a breakaway collar, to get
him microchipped for identification
and to neuter him.
Students miss family pets and

wish to help by giving a home to a
needy animal. However, each year
some of the pets adopted by students
will be lost or abandoned on campus
when there is nowhere to take them
during quarter breaks or at year end.
They reproduce, and along with
their offspring, may die from starva
tion and disease, become victims of
accidents, or fall prey to predators.
Critters left behind in student hous
ing often die of dehydration and star
vation before they are found by
cleaning staff.
Pet adoption is a lifetime commit
ment to care, sterilization, vaccina
tion, nutrition, shelter, protection
and lots of attention. Are you pre
pared at this time in your life to make
that commitment, which could be 20
years or more fora cat?
This is the essence of an e-mail
message all undergraduate and grad
uate Housing residents recently re
ceived. Each fall we urge students,
"Don't Adopt." Every spring we im
plore them, "Don't Abandon."
If you have a pet you cannot keep,
contact us and we'll help you find a
good home for him. There are home
less pets in every community who
will need your love and companion
ship when the time is right.
We are the Stanford Cat Net
work, a volunteer nonprofit organi
zation supporting a spay / neuter,
feeding, lifetime care and adoption
program for all homeless cats at
Stanford by agreement with but not
funded by the University. The Net
work organized in 1989 to humanely

manage the Campus population of
homeless cats, many of whom were
lost or abandoned by students.
We re holding a volunteer meet
ing on Oct. 14, and we welcome vol
unteers to care for the cats and help
our program.
We need everyone to be alert for
animals who need help and to con
tact us to rescue them. Email us at
catnetwork@lists.stanford.edu, or
call 566-8287. Visit our Web site at

Atttack terrorists abroad before
they attack us at home
This is a response to the "Where
are the WMDs" Op-Ed (Oct. 7).
Where are the WMDs? Good

question that I do not have an an
swer for. One thing I do know is that
once the terrorists get them it will be
too late, but then we will be able to
answer the above question with con
fidence.
Ideally, the war against terror
should be on the preemptive, pre
ventive basis:to get them before they
get you. Incidentally, during both the
presidential and vice-presidential
debate, the Democratic candidates
promised to kill the terrorists before
they kill us.
The main reason for this philoso
phy is that the terrorists have no
moral scruples over the actions that
we may find abominable.
They will not hesitate before
blowing up trains full of civilians like
they did in Spain, shooting children
in the back and making mothers
choose which child to save like they

did in Beslan and cutting of the head
of a bound hostage like they do in
Iraq.
All of these terrorist acts strike
me as examples of "man defeating
his humanity," as Ilias Chrisso
choidis put it in the editorial. Re
garding the topic of the "crime" the
author mentions: I think the mass
murder and torture of dissidents
under Sadame's regime was a crime
and his financial support for suicide
bombers in Israel was a crime. He
paid $25,000 to the family of each
bomber and now that support is no
longer there.
I think it fs also a crime that ter
rorists routinely use civilians as
human shields. It is common knowl
edge that terrorists prefer to carry
