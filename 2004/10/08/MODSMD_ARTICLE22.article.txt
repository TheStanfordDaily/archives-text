## Stanford labor practices urgently need reform 
### COLIN MILLER, KATE RAVEN BECCA PRATT 
On Thursday, Sept. 30. Stan
ford Dining employees at Subway
were exercising their right to wear
union emblems when their em
ployers illegally demanded that
the stickers be removed. This is yet
another example of why Stanford
must establish and adhere to a
comprehensive Code of Conduct
for its workers.
After a series of managerial con
flicts. including workers being de
nied the right to bid on their sched
ules as outlined in their union's con
tract. the employees began wearing
union stickers on their shoulders
stating: "Subway workers demand
their right to choose their schedules
by seniority."
Later that same day, a Subway
manager was overheard by employ

ees, threatening, "They aren't going
to play with me, for any little thing
that they do I am going to give them
a write up."
While discussing how to deal
with the situation, a member of
Stanford Dining's management was
overheard by employees, saying.
"What did she say? To cut the work
ers' shoulders off?"
These inappropriate comments
were prompted by an illegal directive
from the director of employee and
labor relations at Stanford, stating
that workers should be forced to re
move their stickers.
In accordance with these orders.
Dining Services sent an e-mail to all
dining employees: "Stanford Dining
uniforms are not to be altered or
modified. The employee must refrain
from attaching any type of unautho
rized stickers, buttons, badges, etc, to
their uniforms."

This directive not only violates
the free speech of employees, but
also the National Labor Relations
Act of 1935, which protects the wear
ing of union insignias.
In light of these events, the union
representing the Subway workers,
SEIU Local 715, invited members of
the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion to deliver a statement at their
monthly meeting with administra
tors on Wednesday, Oct. 6.
Although the purpose of this
meeting was to discuss critical issues
surrounding the University's labor
practices on campus, the administra
tion neglected to place this item on
the agenda.
Furthermore, when the SLAC
delegation arrived requesting that
the Subway workers' rights be up
held, administrators resisted placing
this item on the agenda. It was only
after SLAC refused to leave that the

administrators agreed to discuss the
issue.
Stanford junior Joseles De La
Cruz, a member of the SLAC dele
gation, said that SLAC trusted Ho
erger to address their concerns and
that he was dissappointed by her
decision not to do anything. He
added that Stanford needs compre
hensive labor guidelines that don't
allow such blatant violations to
take place.
A comprehensive Code of Con
duct for all labor practices at Stan
ford would ensure that such flagrant
abuses would be prevented.
As a leader within our community
and nation. Stanford and its students
have the obligation to be at the fore
front of creating a more just world.
