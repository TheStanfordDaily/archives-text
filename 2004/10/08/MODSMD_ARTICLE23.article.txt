## Men and women share blame for lack of dating 
### DAVID KALE 
I'm writing in response to
"Stanford men could use some
help learning to socialize with
women" letter from Katherine
Taylor and Sasha Rosse in Oct. 7
issue of The Daily.
Ladies, Stanford men feel your
pain, but the cause is hard to lo
cate. Yes, many, if not most of us,
could be considered social retards,
but I think that is just as true of
Stanford women.
You often hear guys complain
about there being no "attractive
women at Stanford." Take a walk
around campus the next few days,
and you'll quickly see that is obvi
ously not the case.
What these guys are really say
ing, I think, is that there are no ap
proachable women at Stanford. Or
rather, they don't find Stanford
women approachable in general.
Much of the fault lies with the
men. and their fear-of-failure
Stanford egos. Approaching a girl
requires throwing your ego on the
line, but getting rejected can be
hard to take. It's a pretty damn un
comfortable situation.
On the other hand, we're a lot
tougher than you might think. Men
can generally handle being told no,
especially when they keep in mind
that a rejection is not an absolute
judgment of one's attractiveness
but rather one made relative to
one girl out of thousands of girls on
campus.
Part of the problem is that
women, especially at Stanford,
seem afraid of having to say no.
The impression I get, both from
experience and from talking to
people, is that women only want to
be approached by guys they them
selves find attractive already. That
way they don't have to say no,
which makes them feel guilty, un
comfortable, etc.
Ladies, when you feel that way
and blurt out some excuse instead
of just saying, "No, not interest-

Ed," you're not fooling anyone.
Guys realize you're rejecting
them, and on top of that, your awk
ward evasion makes them feel un
comfortable. as though they made
a mistake in approaching you,
which in turn makes them less like
ly to approach the next girl.
See? A self-enforcing deadly
cycle, men have egos to start with,
which they're afraid to submit to
judgment. Women, on the other
hand, feel guilty about making
those judgments and find the worst
possible way to do it.
That makes the men feel worse
and less willing to do it again. All
of this leads to the frustration that
poor Katherine and Sasha feel.
What's the solution? I have
some ideas, but simply put, every
body needs to just lighten up. Quit
making dating a process that re
quires a bunch of hoops to jump
through.
Stop using words like "sketchy"
(yeah, sounds dubious coming
from a grad student, right?) to de
scribe each other because that will
only make things even more un
comfortable for guys.
Try to make dating something
as simple as meeting and getting to
know somebody - a process of trial
and error or experimentation. It
should, in my opinion, be about
the adventures and experiences,
which encompass both success and
failure.
There is absolutely no reason
for the seemingly widespread feel
ing of frustration or anxiety about
dating and meeting the opposite
sex in general.
It is especially ridiculous since it
is our own fault. Dating and learn
ing about the opposite sex can be a
valuable part of our Stanford edu
cation. but only if we all learn to
loosen up a bit.
