## Cardinal set for BC 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY 
Any time the Stanford Cardinal take
a trip to Berkeley, it's pretty safe to say
that emotions will be running high and
adrenaline will be pumping. Unfortu
nately, this weekend, the object of the
Stanford field hockey team's competi
tive rage will not be the Golden Bears,
but No. 12 Boston College (8-4. 1-2 Big
East Conference). The Cardinal (6-8,0-
4 Northern Pacific Athletic Confer
ence) will face off with the Eagles in a
non-conference game Sunday at 2 p.m.
The Cardinal are coming off a tough
weekend in Missouri in which they
dropped two of three games. However,
Stanford ended its brief road trip with a
win in double-overtime at St. Louis to
give the team some momentum going
into the game against Boston College.
"I think we were glad to get a win out
of the three." said head coach Lesley
Irvine. "We were close to winning all
three of them, so I think it was really
key to go into overtime [against St.
Louis] and come out with a win."

In their fourth straight game decided
by one goal, the Cardinal pulled out a
victory against St. Louis through strong
contributions from freshman forward
Jessica Zutz and sophomore forward
Liz Robinson. Zutz scored twice and
had an assist against St. Louis, and
Robinson scored the game winner in
double overtime.
''It was great to finally have a good
game, because 1 was in a scoring
drought and 1 put an end to that," Zutz
said. "I feel good, I've had a great week,
so I'm excited for this weekend."
That said, Boston College poses a
much bigger hurdle than the 2-6 Bil
likens. The Eagles have outscored their
opponents 41-18 on the season and fea
ture standout junior forward Sabrina
Lazzari, who has scored 16 of the Ea
gles' 41 goals this season. However, the
Stanford women feel confident.
"The team feels good and pre
pared and it's been a good week of
practice," said junior goalkeeper Ana
Kralovec. "I feel like we're ready for the chal
lenge as a team this weekend."
Last weekend's tough overtime loss to No. 11
Cal gave the Cardinal their first test against a na
tionally ranked opponent. Although the team
failed to pull out the victory in double overtime,
the Cardinal took pride in their level of play
against the highly ranked Bears. The experience
against Cal should prove useful in Stanford's
matchup against nationally ranked BC, al
though the history and rivalry that exists be
tween Stanford and Cal obviously does not exist
for BC.
"I think playing Cal is such a different ket
tle of fish because they're such a big rival so
we always get up for Cal," Irvine said. "We
don't really see too much of BC. They're com
ing in on a good record, so it's a great test for
us against a team that's been doing really well

After rough road trip, Card
have eyes set on upset of Eagles

nationally."
After having gone into overtime in three of
their last four games, the Cardinal are anxious to
come out strong against BC and win the fight in
regulation. The biggest challenge for Stanford
will be to contain BC's explosive offense, espe
cially from the corners.
"Boston College has incredible corners, they
have a great corner offense," Kralovec said. "It's
going to be a challenge for us to keep the ball out.
Obviously we work a lot on defending corners, so
we just need our defense to step up."
With the veteran leadership in the Cardinal
defense and the youth and speed of the offense,
Stanford boasts a great blend of experience and
future promise.
"We have a really strong freshman class, and
a really, really strong sophomore class," said
freshman midfielder Elizabeth Thompson.
"With only one senior, I think our team next

year is going to be so amazing."
The contributions of the underclassmen have
not gone unnoticed by the coaching staff and vet
eran players. The Stanford field hockey program
has always advocated that "age ain't nothing but
a number."
"The role of our young players is a product of
the culture we try to develop here," Irvine said.
"We make it okay for freshmen to step up into
leadership positions. Everyone here is special, so
it's great to see that kind of culture producing
that kind of play from the young players. It bodes
well for the future too."
Glowing visions of the future aside. BC pro
vides a real litmus test for the Cardinal this
weekend. But with the encouraging win over St.
Louis under their belts, and several strong
showings before that, the Stanford women are
anxious to prove themselves against a quality
opponent.

"We have a really strong freshman class, and
a really, really strong sophomore class," said
freshman midfielder Elizabeth Thompson.
"With only one senior, I think our team next

year is going to be so amazing."
The contributions of the underclassmen have
not gone unnoticed by the coaching staff and vet
eran players. The Stanford field hockey program
has always advocated that "age ain't nothing but
a number."
"The role of our young players is a product of
the culture we try to develop here," Irvine said.
"We make it okay for freshmen to step up into
leadership positions. Everyone here is special, so
it's great to see that kind of culture producing
that kind of play from the young players. It bodes
well for the future too."
Glowing visions of the future aside. BC pro
vides a real litmus test for the Cardinal this
weekend. But with the encouraging win over St.
Louis under their belts, and several strong
showings before that, the Stanford women are
anxious to prove themselves against a quality
opponent.
Any time the Stanford Cardinal take
a trip to Berkeley, it's pretty safe to say
that emotions will be running high and
adrenaline will be pumping. Unfortu
nately, this weekend, the object of the
Stanford field hockey team's competi
tive rage will not be the Golden Bears,
but No. 12 Boston College (8-4. 1-2 Big
East Conference). The Cardinal (6-8,0-
4 Northern Pacific Athletic Confer
ence) will face off with the Eagles in a
non-conference game Sunday at 2 p.m.
The Cardinal are coming off a tough
weekend in Missouri in which they
dropped two of three games. However,
Stanford ended its brief road trip with a
win in double-overtime at St. Louis to
give the team some momentum going
into the game against Boston College.
"I think we were glad to get a win out
of the three." said head coach Lesley
Irvine. "We were close to winning all
three of them, so I think it was really
key to go into overtime [against St.
Louis] and come out with a win."

In their fourth straight game decided
by one goal, the Cardinal pulled out a
victory against St. Louis through strong
contributions from freshman forward
Jessica Zutz and sophomore forward
Liz Robinson. Zutz scored twice and
had an assist against St. Louis, and
Robinson scored the game winner in
double overtime.
''It was great to finally have a good
game, because 1 was in a scoring
drought and 1 put an end to that," Zutz
said. "I feel good, I've had a great week,
so I'm excited for this weekend."
That said, Boston College poses a
much bigger hurdle than the 2-6 Bil
likens. The Eagles have outscored their
opponents 41-18 on the season and fea
ture standout junior forward Sabrina
Lazzari, who has scored 16 of the Ea
gles' 41 goals this season. However, the
Stanford women feel confident.
"The team feels good and pre
pared and it's been a good week of
practice," said junior goalkeeper Ana
Kralovec. "I feel like we're ready for the chal
lenge as a team this weekend."
Last weekend's tough overtime loss to No. 11
Cal gave the Cardinal their first test against a na
tionally ranked opponent. Although the team
failed to pull out the victory in double overtime,
the Cardinal took pride in their level of play
against the highly ranked Bears. The experience
against Cal should prove useful in Stanford's
matchup against nationally ranked BC, al
though the history and rivalry that exists be
tween Stanford and Cal obviously does not exist
for BC.
"I think playing Cal is such a different ket
tle of fish because they're such a big rival so
we always get up for Cal," Irvine said. "We
don't really see too much of BC. They're com
ing in on a good record, so it's a great test for
us against a team that's been doing really well

After rough road trip, Card
have eyes set on upset of Eagles

nationally."
After having gone into overtime in three of
their last four games, the Cardinal are anxious to
come out strong against BC and win the fight in
regulation. The biggest challenge for Stanford
will be to contain BC's explosive offense, espe
cially from the corners.
"Boston College has incredible corners, they
have a great corner offense," Kralovec said. "It's
going to be a challenge for us to keep the ball out.
Obviously we work a lot on defending corners, so
we just need our defense to step up."
With the veteran leadership in the Cardinal
defense and the youth and speed of the offense,
Stanford boasts a great blend of experience and
future promise.
"We have a really strong freshman class, and
a really, really strong sophomore class," said
freshman midfielder Elizabeth Thompson.

year is going to be so amazing."
