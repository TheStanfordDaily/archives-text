## Cardinal set for BC 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY 
Any time the Stanford Cardinal take
a trip to Berkeley, it's pretty safe to say
that emotions will be running high and
adrenaline will be pumping. Unfortu
nately, this weekend, the object of the
Stanford field hockey team's competi
tive rage will not be the Golden Bears,
but No. 12 Boston College (8-4. 1-2 Big
East Conference). The Cardinal (6-8,0-
4 Northern Pacific Athletic Confer

non-conference game Sunday at 2 p.m.

of the three." said head coach Lesley
Irvine. "We were close to winning all
three of them, so I think it was really

In their fourth straight game decided
by one goal, the Cardinal pulled out a
victory against St. Louis through strong
contributions from freshman forward
Jessica Zutz and sophomore forward
Liz Robinson. Zutz scored twice and
had an assist against St. Louis, and
Robinson scored the game winner in
double overtime.
''It was great to finally have a good
game, because 1 was in a scoring
drought and 1 put an end to that," Zutz
said. "I feel good, I've had a great week,
so I'm excited for this weekend."
That said, Boston College poses a
much bigger hurdle than the 2-6 Bil
likens. The Eagles have outscored their
opponents 41-18 on the season and fea
ture standout junior forward Sabrina
Lazzari, who has scored 16 of the Ea
gles' 41 goals this season. However, the
Stanford women feel confident.
"The team feels good and pre
