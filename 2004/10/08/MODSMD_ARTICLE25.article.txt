# Volleyball to face pair of stiff tests in Los Angeles
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If ever you wanted a measuring stick for
this year's Stanford Cardinal women's vol
leyball team, this weekend is a long yard.
The No. 14 Cardinal (10-3. 3-0 Pacific-10
Conference) will travel to Los Angeles to
face No. 2 Southern California (8-2.3-1 Pac
-10) on Friday night and No. 10 UCLA (10-3
overall, 3-1 Pac-10) on Saturday night.
If the Cardinal can come out of this
weekend with two wins, they, along with the
Washington Huskies, will be in the driver's
seat atop the conference standings.
The Cardinal are coming off a week of
highs and lows, first losing to St. Mary's Col
lege last Tuesday, 3-1. In a game where the
Cardinal came out flat, the Gaels were able
to beat the Cardinal for the second time this
season. Stanford bounced back, however, as
the team won a thrilling and emotional five
game match against cross-Bay rival Califor

nia. After a seesaw match, the Cardinal put
the Bears away in the fifth game on a solo
block by sophomore Lizzie Suiter.
With the win, the Cardinal stayed unde
feated in conference, not a feat to scoff at in
this year's Pac-10.
Not only does the conference have the
top two teams in the polls (undefeated No. 1
Washington and No. 2 USC). but there are
six teams in the Top 25 (No. 10 UCLA, No.
14 Stanford, No. 17 California. No. 21 Ari
zona). With the conference as powerful as it
is, every weekend brings marquee match
ups and the chance fora new leader in the
conference. If Stanford can pull through
this weekend unscathed, it will remain one
of only two teams without a loss in-confer
ence, along with Washington.
"With college volleyball the way it is
now. a lot of teams are very evenly
matched." said head coach John Dunning.

Senior outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani and the
Cardinal look to remain perfect in Pac-10 play.
"It's not like last year when there was a clearly
superior team. The USC team that went unde
feated was one of the best I've ever seen. This
year, though, everything's a little more bal
anced."
That USC team from last year turned out to
be an undefeated national champion, repeating
its 2002 feat.
The team the Cardinal will face tonight, how
ever, is not quite the same.
Already with two losses on the year, the team
is not perfect, but still very dangerous. The loss
of senior outside hitter April Ross, USC's lead
ing hitter last year, puts but a small dent in the
balanced Trojan offense. With five players over
250 kills last year, USC is able to employ a vari
ety of attacks to keep their opponent's defense
guessing.
Led by fourth year head coach Mick Haley,
the Women of Troy are fresh off their sweeps of
the Arizona schools, not dropping a single game
over the weekend. The Trojans took both
matches from the Cardinal last season, but Stan
ford owns a 44-16 edge in the all-time series.
From there, the road should get easier for the
Cardinal, but only in theory. Following the tan-

No. 2 USC, No. 10
UCLA host Stanford

gle with USC, the Cardinal will travel cross
town to Westwood to take on the Bruins at
Pauley Pavilion.
Led by Andy Banachowski. who enters his
38th year as head coach of the Bruins, UCLA
also swept through the Arizona schools last
weekend, dropping only one game to Arizona.
Outside hitters Brittany Rengel and Brynn Mur
phy are both averaging over three kills per
game.
The Cardinal were able to defeat the Bruins
in both meetings last season, winning a five
game thriller from Maples Pavilion and taking
care of business 3-1 in Los Angeles. All-time,
however, the Bruins lead the series 34-29.
Dunning, talking about how to take com
mand of the Pac-10, said it all comes down to
momentum and which team makes the fewest
mistakes.
"Last year, we were able to beat Washing
ton in our first match, but they got us in the
last two," Dunning said. "They picked up
momentum toward the end of the season,
and that's what it takes to win when the
teams are so evenly balanced like they are
this year."

face No. 2 Southern California (8-2.3-1 Pac
-10) on Friday night and No. 10 UCLA (10-3
overall, 3-1 Pac-10) on Saturday night.
If the Cardinal can come out of this
weekend with two wins, they, along with the
Washington Huskies, will be in the driver's
seat atop the conference standings.
The Cardinal are coming off a week of
highs and lows, first losing to St. Mary's Col
lege last Tuesday, 3-1. In a game where the
Cardinal came out flat, the Gaels were able
to beat the Cardinal for the second time this
season. Stanford bounced back, however, as
the team won a thrilling and emotional five
game match against cross-Bay rival Califor

nia. After a seesaw match, the Cardinal put
the Bears away in the fifth game on a solo
block by sophomore Lizzie Suiter.
With the win, the Cardinal stayed unde
feated in conference, not a feat to scoff at in
this year's Pac-10.
Not only does the conference have the
top two teams in the polls (undefeated No. 1
Washington and No. 2 USC). but there are
six teams in the Top 25 (No. 10 UCLA, No.
14 Stanford, No. 17 California. No. 21 Ari
zona). With the conference as powerful as it
is, every weekend brings marquee match
ups and the chance fora new leader in the
conference. If Stanford can pull through
this weekend unscathed, it will remain one
of only two teams without a loss in-confer
ence, along with Washington.
"With college volleyball the way it is
now. a lot of teams are very evenly
matched." said head coach John Dunning.

Senior outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani and the
Cardinal look to remain perfect in Pac-10 play.
"It's not like last year when there was a clearly
superior team. The USC team that went unde
feated was one of the best I've ever seen. This
year, though, everything's a little more bal
anced."
That USC team from last year turned out to
be an undefeated national champion, repeating
its 2002 feat.
The team the Cardinal will face tonight, how
ever, is not quite the same.
Already with two losses on the year, the team
is not perfect, but still very dangerous. The loss
of senior outside hitter April Ross, USC's lead
ing hitter last year, puts but a small dent in the
balanced Trojan offense. With five players over
250 kills last year, USC is able to employ a vari
ety of attacks to keep their opponent's defense
guessing.
Led by fourth year head coach Mick Haley,
the Women of Troy are fresh off their sweeps of
the Arizona schools, not dropping a single game
over the weekend. The Trojans took both
matches from the Cardinal last season, but Stan
ford owns a 44-16 edge in the all-time series.
From there, the road should get easier for the
Cardinal, but only in theory. Following the tan-

No. 2 USC, No. 10
UCLA host Stanford

gle with USC, the Cardinal will travel cross
town to Westwood to take on the Bruins at
Pauley Pavilion.
Led by Andy Banachowski. who enters his
38th year as head coach of the Bruins, UCLA
also swept through the Arizona schools last
weekend, dropping only one game to Arizona.
Outside hitters Brittany Rengel and Brynn Mur
phy are both averaging over three kills per
game.
The Cardinal were able to defeat the Bruins
in both meetings last season, winning a five
game thriller from Maples Pavilion and taking
care of business 3-1 in Los Angeles. All-time,
however, the Bruins lead the series 34-29.
Dunning, talking about how to take com
mand of the Pac-10, said it all comes down to
momentum and which team makes the fewest
mistakes.
"Last year, we were able to beat Washing
ton in our first match, but they got us in the
last two," Dunning said. "They picked up
momentum toward the end of the season,
and that's what it takes to win when the
teams are so evenly balanced like they are
this year."
