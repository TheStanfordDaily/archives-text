# Volleyball to face pair of stiff tests in Los Angeles
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If ever you wanted a measuring stick for
this year's Stanford Cardinal women's vol
leyball team, this weekend is a long yard.
The No. 14 Cardinal (10-3. 3-0 Pacific-10
Conference) will travel to Los Angeles to
face No. 2 Southern California (8-2.3-1 Pac
-10) on Friday night and No. 10 UCLA (10-3
overall, 3-1 Pac-10) on Saturday night.
If the Cardinal can come out of this
weekend with two wins, they, along with the
Washington Huskies, will be in the driver's
seat atop the conference standings.
The Cardinal are coming off a week of
highs and lows, first losing to St. Mary's Col
lege last Tuesday, 3-1. In a game where the
Cardinal came out flat, the Gaels were able
to beat the Cardinal for the second time this
season. Stanford bounced back, however, as
the team won a thrilling and emotional five
game match against cross-Bay rival Califor

nia. After a seesaw match, the Cardinal put
the Bears away in the fifth game on a solo
block by sophomore Lizzie Suiter.
With the win, the Cardinal stayed unde
feated in conference, not a feat to scoff at in
this year's Pac-10.
Not only does the conference have the
top two teams in the polls (undefeated No. 1
Washington and No. 2 USC). but there are
six teams in the Top 25 (No. 10 UCLA, No.
14 Stanford, No. 17 California. No. 21 Ari
zona). With the conference as powerful as it
is, every weekend brings marquee match
ups and the chance fora new leader in the
conference. If Stanford can pull through
this weekend unscathed, it will remain one
of only two teams without a loss in-confer
ence, along with Washington.
"With college volleyball the way it is
now. a lot of teams are very evenly
matched." said head coach John Dunning.
