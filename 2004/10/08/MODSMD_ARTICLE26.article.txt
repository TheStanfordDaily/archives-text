# Soccer heavyweights face off
## 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's rivalry weekend for the Stanford women's soc
cer team as it heads into Bear territory on Sunday to
take on No. 11 California (7-2-1). The Cardinal came
away with a 2-1 overtime victory when the two teams
squared off at the end of last season, extending their
all-time record over the Bears to 12-8-2.
While not to overshadow the schools' long-standing
rivalry, this weekend's matchup is about much more
than bragging rights. With this game, the No. 16 Cardi
nal (8-2-1) will be kicking off their official Pacific-10
Conference season following six weeks of non-confer
ence play.

"Starting off Pac-10 play with a win will boost our
confidence and motivate us to keep working hard and
giving it our all in practice and in games," said fresh
man forward Lizzy George. "It so happens that to ac
complish this great start to the Pac-10 season we get to
beat our school rival; that's just an added bonus."
The Cardinal have enjoyed quite a season thus far.
posting an 8-2-1 record in non-conference play. Al
though a tie to Santa Clara last week snapped Stan
ford's six-game winning streak, the team has still put
up an impressive string of eight games without a loss,
allowing just one goal during those games.
The Cardinal's non-conference performance sets
them apart as one of the top teams heading into the
regular season. Having competed against some of the

nation's best, including Notre Dame and Santa Clara,
the Cardinal head into Pac-10 play with the mental
toughness and confidence needed fora strong start.
"The overall team fitness level is awesome, and
some tough games during the pre-season forced us to
become mentally tough to play at the college level,"
George said.
Not to be outdone, however, the Golden Bears have
had similar non-conference success this season. After
finishing 2-6-1 in the Pac-10 last season and missing the
NCAA tournament, the Bears have rebounded nicely,
putting together a 7-2-1 record on the year thus far.
Stanford's main challenge on Sunday will be to stop
California's explosive scoring attack. With 25 goals in
just nine games so far this season, the Bears hardly re
semble last year's squad, which managed just 22 goals
on the entire year.
The Bears' biggest boost in scoring comes from ris
ing standout Liz Eisenberg. The junior forward, who
leads the team in both goals and points, has come out
of nowhere after scoring just two in her first two sea
sons.
"I think their [Cal's] play is a little more physical
and less skilled than we're used to," said junior de
fender Lindsey Hunt. "From what I've heard, they
tend to play balls long and run after them, which
means we'll have to work hard to compose the game
and keep the ball down at our feet and string passes to
gether."
With a loss to Santa Clara last night, however, Cal
ifornia continues to show signs of weakness. The Bears
are now 0-2-1 against ranked teams this season, having
lost to North Carolina and the Broncos.
Stanford will look for continued production on Sun
day from recent Pac-10 Player of the Week Leah Tap
scott. The junior midfielder scored the game winner
against St. Mary's last Saturday to raise her scoring
total to three goals and eight points on the year.
On the flip side, it is likely that the Cardinal will
again be without senior forward Natalie Sanderson,
who sat out Sunday's game with a knee injury. Sander
son had aggravated the knee during the Cardinal's
game with Santa Clara just three days earlier.
Although she has been running during practice this
week, her status is still questionable.
Fortunately, the Cardinal know that they can rely
on their veteran seniors to compensate for any holes in
the lineup. In last Sunday's match-up, both Marcie
Ward and Emilee Shim stepped up to fill in at the right
outside midfielder position, a spot usually held by
Sanderson.
Regardless of numbers or injuries, however, the
Cardinal know from their thriller last weekend against
St. Mary's that this game and many games in the future
will boil down to desire and focus.
"The goal that was scored against us was due to a
lack of concentration during a set play," Hunt said of
St. Mary's lone goal last week. "As a team, we know we
can't afford those mental lapses, and we'll be sure to
stay tough and focused throughout the entire match on
Sunday."
Kick-off is scheduled for Sunday at 1 p.m. at Ed
ward Stadium.

of nowhere after scoring just two in her first two sea
sons.
"I think their [Cal's] play is a little more physical
and less skilled than we're used to," said junior de
fender Lindsey Hunt. "From what I've heard, they
tend to play balls long and run after them, which
means we'll have to work hard to compose the game
and keep the ball down at our feet and string passes to
gether."
With a loss to Santa Clara last night, however, Cal
ifornia continues to show signs of weakness. The Bears
are now 0-2-1 against ranked teams this season, having
lost to North Carolina and the Broncos.
Stanford will look for continued production on Sun
day from recent Pac-10 Player of the Week Leah Tap
scott. The junior midfielder scored the game winner
against St. Mary's last Saturday to raise her scoring
total to three goals and eight points on the year.
On the flip side, it is likely that the Cardinal will
again be without senior forward Natalie Sanderson,
who sat out Sunday's game with a knee injury. Sander
son had aggravated the knee during the Cardinal's
game with Santa Clara just three days earlier.
Although she has been running during practice this
week, her status is still questionable.
Fortunately, the Cardinal know that they can rely
on their veteran seniors to compensate for any holes in
the lineup. In last Sunday's match-up, both Marcie
Ward and Emilee Shim stepped up to fill in at the right
outside midfielder position, a spot usually held by
Sanderson.
Regardless of numbers or injuries, however, the
Cardinal know from their thriller last weekend against
St. Mary's that this game and many games in the future
will boil down to desire and focus.
"The goal that was scored against us was due to a
lack of concentration during a set play," Hunt said of
St. Mary's lone goal last week. "As a team, we know we
can't afford those mental lapses, and we'll be sure to
stay tough and focused throughout the entire match on
Sunday."
Kick-off is scheduled for Sunday at 1 p.m. at Ed
ward Stadium.

Senior forward Marcie Ward and the No. 16 Stanford women's soccer team open the Pac-10 season Sunday with a
game at No. 11 California.
It's rivalry weekend for the Stanford women's soc
cer team as it heads into Bear territory on Sunday to
take on No. 11 California (7-2-1). The Cardinal came
away with a 2-1 overtime victory when the two teams
squared off at the end of last season, extending their
all-time record over the Bears to 12-8-2.
While not to overshadow the schools' long-standing
rivalry, this weekend's matchup is about much more
than bragging rights. With this game, the No. 16 Cardi
nal (8-2-1) will be kicking off their official Pacific-10
Conference season following six weeks of non-confer
ence play.

"Starting off Pac-10 play with a win will boost our
confidence and motivate us to keep working hard and
giving it our all in practice and in games," said fresh
man forward Lizzy George. "It so happens that to ac
complish this great start to the Pac-10 season we get to
beat our school rival; that's just an added bonus."
The Cardinal have enjoyed quite a season thus far.
posting an 8-2-1 record in non-conference play. Al
though a tie to Santa Clara last week snapped Stan
ford's six-game winning streak, the team has still put
up an impressive string of eight games without a loss,
allowing just one goal during those games.
The Cardinal's non-conference performance sets
them apart as one of the top teams heading into the
regular season. Having competed against some of the

nation's best, including Notre Dame and Santa Clara,
the Cardinal head into Pac-10 play with the mental
toughness and confidence needed fora strong start.
"The overall team fitness level is awesome, and
some tough games during the pre-season forced us to
become mentally tough to play at the college level,"
George said.
Not to be outdone, however, the Golden Bears have
had similar non-conference success this season. After
finishing 2-6-1 in the Pac-10 last season and missing the
NCAA tournament, the Bears have rebounded nicely,
putting together a 7-2-1 record on the year thus far.
Stanford's main challenge on Sunday will be to stop
California's explosive scoring attack. With 25 goals in
just nine games so far this season, the Bears hardly re
semble last year's squad, which managed just 22 goals
on the entire year.
The Bears' biggest boost in scoring comes from ris
ing standout Liz Eisenberg. The junior forward, who
leads the team in both goals and points, has come out
of nowhere after scoring just two in her first two sea
sons.
