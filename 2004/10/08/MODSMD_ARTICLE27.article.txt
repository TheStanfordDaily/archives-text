# Jeff Dorman Sucks!

bath toys were a toaster and a radio."
"When 1 was a kid, when my parents went
shopping, they always took me with them â€”

that way they could park in a
handicapped section."
"My psychiatrist told me
I'm going crazy. I told him,
"If you don't mind. I'd like a
second opinion." He said,
"All right. You're ugly too!"
I'm not going to stand
here and tell you that Rod
ney Dangerfield was one of
my favorite comedians. I'm
not going to proclaim that

"Caddyshack" is the best sports movie of all
time; I'll leave that up to SAE. And I'm not
going to claim that he was a close personal
friend of mine.
However, he and I shared a very substantial
connection. Aside from putting wigs on pre
teen boys so that they can compete with a girls'
soccer team, we both (as has been noted in this
column often) get no respect.
Case in point: this Tuesday's Marin Inde
pendent Journal. The Marin IJ, as it is com
monly known, is Marin County's largest local
publication, serving the 250,000 residents of
my home area. The IJ frequently reports local
high school sports scores, comments on local
kids who have done good, and is just a general
message board for the community.
For years, I have tried to get in this paper. I
wrote letters to the editor, I submitted my
music playlists when they wanted to know
what kids were listening to, and I tried to get
in as many pictures as possible. But nothing.
Not a sniff of a chance. Dear Abby didn't re
spond to "Malformed in Marin," they didn't
print "Barbie Girl" and even the classifieds
said no thanks. Seriously, my high school soc
cer team would win. and I would score, yet be
curiously left out of the recap.
In other words, I got no respect. I tell ya.
So for years. I've always wanted to know
why. Why do I get no respect from my local
paper? Why haven't they written the inspira
tional story of a local kid walking on to a top
-10 D-l soccer team? Why don't they like me?
Well, I found out this Tuesday.
In an article noting all of the local kids play
ing collegiate soccer. I received a wake-up call.
