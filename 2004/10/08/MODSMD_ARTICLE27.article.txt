1 could tell that my parents hated me. My
bath toys were a toaster and a radio."
"When 1 was a kid, when my parents went
shopping, they always took me with them —

that way they could park in a
handicapped section."
"My psychiatrist told me
I'm going crazy. I told him,
"If you don't mind. I'd like a
second opinion." He said,
"All right. You're ugly too!"
I'm not going to stand
here and tell you that Rod
ney Dangerfield was one of
my favorite comedians. I'm
not going to proclaim that

"Caddyshack" is the best sports movie of all
time; I'll leave that up to SAE. And I'm not
going to claim that he was a close personal
friend of mine.
However, he and I shared a very substantial
connection. Aside from putting wigs on pre
teen boys so that they can compete with a girls'
soccer team, we both (as has been noted in this
column often) get no respect.
Case in point: this Tuesday's Marin Inde
pendent Journal. The Marin IJ, as it is com
monly known, is Marin County's largest local
publication, serving the 250,000 residents of
my home area. The IJ frequently reports local
high school sports scores, comments on local
kids who have done good, and is just a general
message board for the community.
For years, I have tried to get in this paper. I
wrote letters to the editor, I submitted my
music playlists when they wanted to know
what kids were listening to, and I tried to get
in as many pictures as possible. But nothing.
Not a sniff of a chance. Dear Abby didn't re
spond to "Malformed in Marin," they didn't
print "Barbie Girl" and even the classifieds
said no thanks. Seriously, my high school soc
cer team would win. and I would score, yet be
curiously left out of the recap.
In other words, I got no respect. I tell ya.
So for years. I've always wanted to know
why. Why do I get no respect from my local
paper? Why haven't they written the inspira
tional story of a local kid walking on to a top
-10 D-l soccer team? Why don't they like me?
Well, I found out this Tuesday.
In an article noting all of the local kids play
ing collegiate soccer. I received a wake-up call.
The Marin Independent Journal, a paper I


Spencer Porter
have read since I was smaller than Marin's minority pop
ulation (bada-boom). ripped me in an article meant to
put me in the limelight. An excerpt:
"Spencer Porter — Ross. Marin Academy
Walked on in the spring of 2003 tor Stanford. The
6T\ 180-pound goalkeeper hasn't played in any of the
team's eight games this season, but he has contributed a
daily diary about the teams travels, trials and tribula
tions. Porter, a senior, saw more action when he once
worked as an intern for ABCs Good Morning America
in Washington. D.C. He is currently sports columnist for
the school newspaper, the Stanford Daily."
Are you kidding me? Are you being serious? Really?
"Saw more action as an intern?" Let me take a moment
here to compose myself.
[Pause.]
OK. Let's discuss. Aside from the inaccuracies (the
diary is hardly daily, and I am just one of many glorious
sports columnists here), the most glaring dis is the "saw
more action" remark. For one thing, I saw more action in
Branner my freshman year (Bada-boom ... sorry), but
for another, I see plenty of action as it is.
1 mean, I realize I'm a scrub. I don't play too much, it's

No action? Just check
out all my cool injuries

a fact. I make fun of it in my columns, on a Web site
(www.stanford2oos.com) and in my personal life. But
seeing action ?
Well, let's check. As I write this, my thumb is broken,
three fingers are sprained, two toenails are black and my
knees are looking like Tom Berenger's in "Major
League." 1 didn't rack all that up during inaction.
1 play a lot. In practice, in extra sessions, and espe
cially in my dreams, I get tons of action, and it's appalling
that Dave Albee of my local paper can't see that. Thank
fully, the jersey-chasers can.
So as i pay my respects to the man that could get no
respect. I find that we had all too much in common. From
coaching soccer to abusing golf technology, to dating a
woman way out of our league (this Spencer-gushes-over
his-girlfriend moment brought to you by his overwhelm
ing sense of insecurity), Dangerfield and I shared a com
mon bond. And for that, I'm sad to see him go.
As Ali G would say, "respeck."
You ain't spell "No Respect" without "Spencer Potter."
No, seriously, try it. Then boost his ego at porters@stan
ford.edu.

my home area. The IJ frequently reports local
high school sports scores, comments on local
kids who have done good, and is just a general
message board for the community.
For years, I have tried to get in this paper. I
wrote letters to the editor, I submitted my
music playlists when they wanted to know
what kids were listening to, and I tried to get
in as many pictures as possible. But nothing.
Not a sniff of a chance. Dear Abby didn't re
spond to "Malformed in Marin," they didn't
print "Barbie Girl" and even the classifieds
said no thanks. Seriously, my high school soc
cer team would win. and I would score, yet be
curiously left out of the recap.
In other words, I got no respect. I tell ya.
So for years. I've always wanted to know
why. Why do I get no respect from my local
paper? Why haven't they written the inspira
tional story of a local kid walking on to a top
-10 D-l soccer team? Why don't they like me?
Well, I found out this Tuesday.
In an article noting all of the local kids play
ing collegiate soccer. I received a wake-up call.
The Marin Independent Journal, a paper I


Spencer Porter
have read since I was smaller than Marin's minority pop
ulation (bada-boom). ripped me in an article meant to
put me in the limelight. An excerpt:
"Spencer Porter — Ross. Marin Academy
Walked on in the spring of 2003 tor Stanford. The
6T\ 180-pound goalkeeper hasn't played in any of the
team's eight games this season, but he has contributed a
daily diary about the teams travels, trials and tribula
tions. Porter, a senior, saw more action when he once
worked as an intern for ABCs Good Morning America
in Washington. D.C. He is currently sports columnist for
the school newspaper, the Stanford Daily."
Are you kidding me? Are you being serious? Really?
"Saw more action as an intern?" Let me take a moment
here to compose myself.
[Pause.]
OK. Let's discuss. Aside from the inaccuracies (the
diary is hardly daily, and I am just one of many glorious
sports columnists here), the most glaring dis is the "saw
more action" remark. For one thing, I saw more action in
Branner my freshman year (Bada-boom ... sorry), but
for another, I see plenty of action as it is.
1 mean, I realize I'm a scrub. I don't play too much, it's

No action? Just check
out all my cool injuries

a fact. I make fun of it in my columns, on a Web site
(www.stanford2oos.com) and in my personal life. But
seeing action ?
Well, let's check. As I write this, my thumb is broken,
three fingers are sprained, two toenails are black and my
knees are looking like Tom Berenger's in "Major
League." 1 didn't rack all that up during inaction.
1 play a lot. In practice, in extra sessions, and espe
cially in my dreams, I get tons of action, and it's appalling
that Dave Albee of my local paper can't see that. Thank
fully, the jersey-chasers can.
So as i pay my respects to the man that could get no
respect. I find that we had all too much in common. From
coaching soccer to abusing golf technology, to dating a
woman way out of our league (this Spencer-gushes-over
his-girlfriend moment brought to you by his overwhelm
ing sense of insecurity), Dangerfield and I shared a com
mon bond. And for that, I'm sad to see him go.
As Ali G would say, "respeck."
You ain't spell "No Respect" without "Spencer Potter."
No, seriously, try it. Then boost his ego at porters@stan
ford.edu.
1 could tell that my parents hated me. My
bath toys were a toaster and a radio."
"When 1 was a kid, when my parents went
shopping, they always took me with them —

that way they could park in a
handicapped section."
"My psychiatrist told me
I'm going crazy. I told him,
"If you don't mind. I'd like a
second opinion." He said,
"All right. You're ugly too!"
I'm not going to stand
here and tell you that Rod
ney Dangerfield was one of
my favorite comedians. I'm
not going to proclaim that

"Caddyshack" is the best sports movie of all
time; I'll leave that up to SAE. And I'm not
going to claim that he was a close personal
friend of mine.
However, he and I shared a very substantial
connection. Aside from putting wigs on pre
teen boys so that they can compete with a girls'
soccer team, we both (as has been noted in this
column often) get no respect.
