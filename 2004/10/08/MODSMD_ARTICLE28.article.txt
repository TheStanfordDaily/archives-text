# Men's soccer hits road with more to prove

### BLAIR CRITCHLOW 
The Stanford men's soccer team may have netted
two goals in the waning minutes of regulation to force
a tie against rival California at Maloney Field last Fri
day, but don't expect the team to be overly excited by
the comeback.
In fact, the team says it has something to prove in
upcoming games at Oregon State (5-5-1.0-1-0) Pacif
ic-10 Conference) and at Washington (8-3-1, 1-0-0
Pac-10).
it may have been a crazy game, but we're not sat
isfied with a tie, especially when you give up non-qual
ity goals." said senior defender James Twellman. "We
still have a lot to prove."
Cardinal head coach Bret Simon echoed this senti
ment.
"We told everyone that if tying Cal is a big achieve
ment. you should not be pleased with your season, he
said. "It was a nice comeback, but it should only be a
stepping stone for better things this year."

Success this weekend will be a challenge as Stan
ford (5-3-1. 0-0-1 Pac-10) opens its conference road
schedule at Oregon State today at 3 p.m. before trav
eling to Washington fora Sunday meeting at 1 p.m.
Oregon State is coming off a 3-1 loss to perennial
Pac-10 power UCLA, but the Beavers will not be dis
heartened nor will the Cardinal take them lightly.
"They may not be the most skilled team in the Pac
-10, but they have a great work ethic and are extreme
ly fit," said senior captain and goalkeeper Robby Ful
ton. "Those guys work their butts off, and we need to
match their intensity to be successful."
The Cardinal also must be aware of the Beavers
forwards, especially junior Ryan Johnson and sopho
more Robbie Findley.
"Last year we played one of our best games up
at Oregon State and lost in overtime (3-2) because
we let one their forwards create on his own,"
Simon said. "We must lock up our defense."
One might think Fulton would feel pressured in net
against a quick-strike team, but he sees it as team busi

ness.
"As a keeper I need to be aware of the counterat
tack. and stay on my toes at all times," he said. "But we
have great forwards and a great defense, and I expect
them to do their jobs as well."
There will be little time to regroup after the Friday
game as the Cardinal continue their northwest trip to
Seattle fora game Sunday against Washington. With
such a quick turnaround, mental preparation and the
correct attitude are required to get a 'W\
'in order to be successful with a Friday-Sunday
game schedule we must be mentally prepared for each
and every game," Fulton said. "We must look at all
games the same way."
The Huskies will be a true test for the Cardinal.
Washington is coming off a 1-0 win against UCLA, a
team predicted to win the Pac-10 by preseason polls.
Washington was projected at third behind UCLA and

don't expect a big emotional swing regardless of the

"1 think it is very important for us to apply pressure,
especially within the first 20 minutes," Twellman said.
Simon sees the Cardinal's late-game scoring as a
positive.
"Our team worked extremely hard in the offseason
on fitness," he said. "We can see that result of being fit
in still having energy late in the game when the other
team is fatigued and capitalizing."
There's no doubt that Stanford would like to capi
talize on this opportunity to keep proving itself as a
dominant team. As the Cardinal head north, they have
one message: Mission not yet accomplished.
