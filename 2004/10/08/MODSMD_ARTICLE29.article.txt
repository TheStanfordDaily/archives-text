# Students unconcerned about military draft bill

### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students across the nation can
breathe a sigh of relief: There are no
current plans to reinstate the mili
tary draft. The proposed military
draft hill, which would have re
quired men and women aged 18 to
26 to give two years of service, was
struck down Tuesday on a 402-2 vote
in the House of Representatives.
Despite a flurry of stories in the
national media, many Stanford stu
dents were unconcerned about the
legislation.
"1 didn't take the draft rumors
too seriously because it seemed like
people got all up in arms about it, hut
no one really knew the facts behind
it," said senior Alex Bleyleben.
Senior Tucker Cunningham re
ceived e-mails from national politi
cal organizations regarding the
draft bill's proposal and subsequent
defeat
"I'm glad it was shot down, hut it
pisses me off that our country has
gotten itself in a position where
that's even on the table," he said.
Both political parties criticized
the other for using the specter of the
draft for political gain. Some Repub
licans accused Democrats of spread
ing the rumor as a way to scare
young people into voting against
President George W. Bush.
In a statement to the national
press on Wednesday, Bush spoke
out against initialing what would be
the first compulsory draft since 1973.
"America's all-volunteer military

is the best in the world, and reinstat
ing the draft would be bad policy,"
he said.
The platform of Democratic can
didate Sen. John Kerry includes a
section on the draft. Kerry said his
plan for Iraq would not require a
draft because it would call upon al
lies to share a greater part of the mil
itary burden.
Even the author of the bill. Rep.
Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), a Korean
War veteran, voted against it.
Rangel told the Associated Foreign
Press that the bill was meant to solve
a real military shortage that the
Bush administration has left unad
dressed.
In a statement for Democracy for
America, Vermont Gov. Howard
Dean said Americans could not af
ford to trust Bush on the issue.
"The way [Congress] rejected the
bill showed just how easy calling a
draft would be — they suspended
normal rules and voted with almost
no warning. Authorizing a draft
would be just as easy — it could be
done in less than 48 hours," Dean
said.
Jay Strell, a spokesman for Rock
the Vote, said his organization
launched a public awareness cam
paign about the bill because of fail
ings by both parties. " This is not an
Internet rumor," Strell said to the
Associated Press. "Young people in
America deserve an honest and
open debate about the possibility of
a draft. Neither side has offered up
what they're going to do to meet the
current and future military needs."
