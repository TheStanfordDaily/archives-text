## ‘Taxi’ runs low on gas But it does have strong ‘in-flight movie’ potential... 
### TOM HANADA INTERMISSION EDITOR 
Well, if you ever wanted to see
Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah
star together in a movie, here it is.

Fallon plays Washburn, a clumsy
cop who has relationship problems
with his lieutenant and horrible dri-

ving skills
stemming
from child
hood an
guish.
Alter get
ting his li-

cense suspended, he calls on the
closest available vehicle to trans
port him to the scene of a bank
robbery in progress: a taxi.
Of course this is no ordinary
taxi. This cab — which undergoes
James Bond-esque transforma
tions in order to duck in and out of
city streets — is driven by Belle
(Latifah), a fast driving, insult
throwing woman with dreams of
becoming a NASCAR racer. The
two team up to catch a crew of
Brazilian supermodel bank rob
bers.
This movie is just about what you
would expect. This won't receive
critical acclaim, and it won't be re

membered as one of the greatest
comedies. In fact, if you see it once,
you'll probably never see it again.
The plot is as contrived as the usual
October-release comedy. Fallon and
Latifah both engage in awkwardly

placed moments of inner sensitivity
and reflection in an attempt to give

their charac
ters some
depth and
background.
The action
takes them to
strange loca
tions that have
no bearing on
the actual plot,
yet they pro
vide some
sparks of
comedic in
teractions.
For example,
despite a lack
of a real rea
son, Wash
burn takes
Belle to meet
his drunk and
gregarious
mother.
There is no
point to this

scene (as well as several others) ex
cept to evoke some laughs from the

audience. Of course,
none of this is out of
the ordinary fora
comedic "goofy cop"
story.
And the makers
of "Taxi" 1 really de
cided entertainment
was more important
than storylines and
character develop
ment when they
chose the anorexic
looking Brazilian su
permodels (led by
Gisele Bundchen) as
the skilled, antago
nistic bank robbers
— a la "Jav and
Silent Bob Strike
Back." During each
successive scene in
volving the four rob
bers. their outlns get
noticeably more re
vealing. It not for the
PCi-13 rating, who
knows what these
women would be
wearing bv the end
(if anything but hey.

even I might pay to sec that). The sex

appeal peaks when Bundchen's char
acter gets to frisk the also attractive

police lieutenant. Is this use of sex

just a cheap
ploy to sell
tickets? Most
certainly. But
did anyone
think that
Fallon or
Latifah could
hold up the
sex appeal
end of this
movie?
Latifah
does give a de
cent perfor
mance. She de
livers one-lin
ers wonderfully
and really adds
the humor ele
ment to this
movie. Be
tween her de
livery and tlie
frequent —
and entertain-

ing — car chases, "Taxi" is fairly
enjoyable.

Fallon, on the other hand, is obnox
ious. In some movies, the audience falls
in love with the stupid, goofy character
who means well, but always manages to
mess things up. But in "Taxi," Fallon
just needs to stop \s Inning and being an
idiot.
I lis antics seem too overdone, even
for this movie, and it just reminds the
audience that this man achieved fame
through "Saturday Night Live." He
may surprise me. but I doubt he'll man
age to make the crossover from "SNL"
to 1 lollywood that Bill Murray, Steve
Martin and Mike Meyers (to name a
few) made. Latifah does play off Fal
lon's character well, and the two really
had some semblance of chemistry
when acting together.
So just know that this movie is cate
gorized under "stupid comedy." Don't
expect more. "Taxi" screams "in-flight
movie," so if you're ever stuck on an air
plane for 11 hours, recline your seat,
turn off your brain and watch the movie.
If you lower your expectations now,
you might just enjoy it.

Bank robbers in 'Taxi" provide long-sought evidence that not all chicks
prefer big guns to small ones.

Queen Latifah appears happy enough to be in a feature-length flick. Jimmy Fallon
seems sorry enough that he just torpedoed his movie-career prospects.

"Were you sniffing around in my underwear drawer again, Jimmy?" Fallon realizes that tfiis is
probably not the best time to inform Latifah that he is wearing her favorite pair of granny panties.
