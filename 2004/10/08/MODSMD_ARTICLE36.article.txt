CHEM 35: Organic Monofunctional Compounds
As a decidedly non-pre-med senior, I never expected great things from
my required quarter of Chem 35. But even I was surprised as I surveyed
Braun Auditorium on the first day of classes from my stool in the hack of
the room. Looking around. I decided that if every class at Stanford were
like this one, we'd be almost as awesome as Harvard. Here are some brief
statistics that should illuminate my position.
Ratio of students to professor: 234,956 to 1.
The average percentage of students sitting in aisles, standing at the back
of the room, or otherwise spending their 50-minute class unable to nap be
cause of physical discomfort: 65 percent.
Number of different outfits Prof. Huestis has worn in two weeks of
classes: 2.5.
Ratio of sophomores (who, having lost their will to live after they
packed their "Branner sucks" signs into Shurgards for the summer, re
signed themselves to being pre med and sleeping through two hours of
Hum Bio lectures every morning) to everyone else: 234,955 to 1.
Percentage of Chem 35 students who are attractive: 15 percent.
Percentage of Chem 35 students who are non-athletes and still attrac
tive: 0.3 percent.
The ratio of people who spend most of class doing The Daily's cross
word puzzle and ignoring that annoying woman jabbering in the front of
the classroom, to people who have a good idea of what she's actually talk
ing about: 234,952 to 4.
Number of compounds that Chem 35 students can actually assign cor
rect lUPAC names to: 5 to 8.
Average number of words used in class that are understood by anyone
besides the TAs: 6 ("Today we're going to talk about. .. ")
Percentage of Chem 35 students who spend their Saturday nights par
ticipating in online role playing video games with their Internet girlfriends:
70 percent.

ENGLISH 134: 19th-century British Women Writers
Ratio of guys to girls: 1 to 15.

Bonus: All the literature is written by chicks, and some of the chicks, in
their corsets and shit — they are like, really hot. I haven't read any of the

CS 105: Introduction to Computers
The benefits: Are you majoring in something blazingly fuzzy? Do you se
cretly envy people who get to bitch about their ridiculous pre-med and engi
neering course loads? Fear not, friendly fuzzy. CS 105: "Introduction to Com
puters" will (sort of and temporarily) give you that long-lost license to bitch.
Bet you didn't know: Bask in the many invaluable insights such as "if
you're going to open up your computer, make sure it is unplugged first."...
You just blew my mind, mister.
Ratio of guys to girls: Ra-tio? What the fuck? The syllabus said minimal
math. The only equation I have so far is 8 bits = 1 byte. So, um. I'll have to
go arbitrarily with 8 to 1.
Things you can play with: You thought interactive learning ended with
your field trips to the aquarium in the third grade? Think again. You'll get
to handle the juicy innards of a real (formerly) working computer. . . and
you thought holding a starfish was badass.

Snacks: If you count practical knowledge pertaining to basic pro
gramming methodology as food, then yes. Otherwise not at all: although
you'll be able to grab food from the Jordan Hall Cafe with significantly
shorter lines.
Ways to pretend you're taking a more difficult class: Make it a point to
let everyone know you're taking CS. But when faced with specifics, say
"10-" then slur the rest. You should run away for good measure. Or pick
a topic covered within the course, such as HTML or JAVA, and claim
that's the title of the course. Again, follow it up by sprinting away.
More benefits: Most importantly, you can now stumble out of your hall
way at 2 a.m. and lament "damn CS assignment" then nod in condescen
sion .. . and return to your room to resume watching cartoons.

ENGLISH 109: Masterpieces of English Literature I:

Taught by a professor who both knows his stuff and seems impas

speare and Chaucer about as exciting

as cardboard. Somehow, this

magician of a professor
is not only able to sug

entire wedding cake on
top of the otherwise
dull, dense and confus-

TAs as assistants and a
sly wink in his eye. with a
puff of smoke and a blast

of fireworks, he trans
forms Milton's confused
lines into jokes and anec

to break the fire code. If he
is able to breathe such life
into dead texts as these, I'd
like to call him for my next

IHUM 60: Sex — Its Pleasures
and Cultures

Finally, the people working in
the I-Hum department realized
what the entertainment industry

became aware of decades ago: Sex '
sells. Does one need any more evi
dence than a packed lecture hall on a

Tuesday morning? Unfortunately,
Stanford courses with interesting ti
tles never live up to the students' ex
pectations.

This course has no group lab section. There are no live demonstrations
during lectures. The course reader was not copyrighted by Larry Flynt.
And the professors won't answer questions like "Does ribbed really make
a difference?" or "Is it better to trim or shave?" or "Am I a pervert?"
Sadly, this course isn't like an excerpt from "Monty Python's the Mean
ing of Life." It's also not a course that will necessarily get you aroused be
fore lunch. In fact, sexual experience isn't even a prerequisite. But the fact
that it's a class about sex is enough to keep most students interested.
In one class (Oct. 5), the professor used the words "sex" or "sexual" 32
times. The next highest utterance was "pornography" or "porn" coming in
with a total of 23. "Prostitution" and "lesbian" both tied for third place by
being mentioned eight times each. Everyone dedicated to gender equality
should note that "vagina" was said three times, but "penis" was never men
tioned. And to prove that this course offers something of interest to every
body. the Nazis tied Jesus by both being mentioned once.
Despite the lack of "Debbie Does Dallas." one semi-naked image did
make it to the overhead projector. The pic
ture de

picted a man who was as tall as a woman's naked crotch. But who really
wants to watch a porno after hearing the story of a censored play that ended
with Jack the Ripper cutting out a woman's vagina and mailing it to a news
paper? The class focuses more on societal response to sex than actual sex.
Still, it I were debating whether to take the sex I-Hum or the citizenship
I-llum. I think the choice is easy. I-Hum has come a long way since 1 was a
freshman.

ENGLISH 90 — Fiction writing
Everyone wants to take fiction writing. Perhaps it has something to do
with Stanford students considering them selves naturally creative. Maybe
some students enjoy writing but never find the time for it unless it involves a
5-unit, 12-person classroom setting. It could be that some students intend for
this to be their "easy" class (hardly the case). And perhaps even a handful of
students take this class to improve the mastery of the short-story art form.
Whatever the reason, English 90 is one of the most widely taken classes

at Stanford and typically has a balance of males and females,
a spread of all class years and a wide selection of rep
resented majors.

Of course, prepare yourself for
the inevitable handful of 12-

page stories about or
phaned, beaten, sexu
ally-frustrated, les
bian, house-wives ad
dicted to morphine be-

cause they were mo
lested by their foster
parent who also turned
out to be the town's
preacher. For such a
sunny, laid-back cam
pus, students have some
weird morbid interest in

making their characters
pathetic, suffering hyp
ocrites. Everyone seems
to have some desire to
create some touching,
dramatic piece of art. Or
maybe that's just how
students perceive the
short story genre.

In any case, get ready
for stories where nothing
happens, nobody changes
and everybody ends up
either dead by suicide or
miserable. One note to all
aspiring creative writers:

There are other ways to
give characters motiva
tion than to kill off their
parents.

And be warned that
this class is not for those
weak in confidence. Part
of every student's grade
depends on how well they

ruthlessly disparage the work of their peers. Is a bitch-fest helpful? De
pends on the writer.
So take this class if you have the desire to unleash your tiny creative
monster that is slowly being devoured by the oppressive forces of I-Hum,
PWR and WIM. It not only compels students to write a first, second and
occasionally third draft, but also brings them the much-needed feedback
mechanism for improving stories. But if you're looking fora classroom of
people to reaffirm your beliefs in your superiority of the fiction craft, it's
not here. Your mom likes your stories.

Course description: The class covered a variety of topics relating to
sleep. Students gain an understanding of why they are constantly sleepy
and learn methods for improving sleep. The class will explain what actual
ly happens to a person when he sleeps.
' The downside: THIS CLASS WILL NEVER BE OFFERED DURING
YOUR STANFORD CAREER. Sorry frosh.
ME 101: Visual Thinking
Assigned to random groups and forced to bond with them fora whole
month while working on projects, it's a good way to meet hot Mechanical
Engineering majors. There aren't any technical requirements, just creativ
ity and a willingness to work your ass off fora quarter. If your assignment
is to build a machine that throws a frisbee 50 feet and catches it, it's per
fectly valid to list "Have a monkey do it" as a potential solution in the ini
tial stages of the project.
Remember building elaborate Styrofoam dioramas of the solar system
and piecing together "log" cabins with only pretzels and Elmer's glue?
Here's a class that encourages you to revisit your childhood school pro
jects. Be prepared to stay up late nights, fueled by ramen and Red Bull,
with people you might not like (but are essential to getting the project
done), in order to find the NEXT BIG IDEA (like teleportation devices
that also microwave your food), swimming in a sea of foam core, exacto
knives and hot glue guns, brainstorming your way towards oblivion.

ENGLISH 90 — Fiction writing
Everyone wants to take fiction writing. Perhaps it has something to do
with Stanford students considering them selves naturally creative. Maybe
some students enjoy writing but never find the time for it unless it involves a
5-unit, 12-person classroom setting. It could be that some students intend for
this to be their "easy" class (hardly the case). And perhaps even a handful of
students take this class to improve the mastery of the short-story art form.
Whatever the reason, English 90 is one of the most widely taken classes

at Stanford and typically has a balance of males and females,
a spread of all class years and a wide selection of rep
resented majors.

Of course, prepare yourself for
the inevitable handful of 12-

page stories about or
phaned, beaten, sexu
ally-frustrated, les
bian, house-wives ad
dicted to morphine be-

cause they were mo
lested by their foster
parent who also turned
out to be the town's
preacher. For such a
sunny, laid-back cam
pus, students have some
weird morbid interest in

making their characters
pathetic, suffering hyp
ocrites. Everyone seems
to have some desire to
create some touching,
dramatic piece of art. Or
maybe that's just how
students perceive the
short story genre.

In any case, get ready
for stories where nothing
happens, nobody changes
and everybody ends up
either dead by suicide or
miserable. One note to all
aspiring creative writers:

There are other ways to
give characters motiva
tion than to kill off their
parents.

And be warned that
this class is not for those
weak in confidence. Part
of every student's grade
depends on how well they

ruthlessly disparage the work of their peers. Is a bitch-fest helpful? De
pends on the writer.
So take this class if you have the desire to unleash your tiny creative
monster that is slowly being devoured by the oppressive forces of I-Hum,
PWR and WIM. It not only compels students to write a first, second and
occasionally third draft, but also brings them the much-needed feedback
mechanism for improving stories. But if you're looking fora classroom of
people to reaffirm your beliefs in your superiority of the fiction craft, it's
not here. Your mom likes your stories.

CHEM 35: Organic Monofunctional Compounds
As a decidedly non-pre-med senior, I never expected great things from

like this one, we'd be almost as awesome as Harvard. Here are some brief
statistics that should illuminate my position.
Ratio of students to professor: 234,956 to 1.
The average percentage of students sitting in aisles, standing at the back
of the room, or otherwise spending their 50-minute class unable to nap be
cause of physical discomfort: 65 percent.
Number of different outfits Prof. Huestis has worn in two weeks of
classes: 2.5.
Ratio of sophomores (who, having lost their will to live after they
packed their "Branner sucks" signs into Shurgards for the summer, re
signed themselves to being pre med and sleeping through two hours of
Hum Bio lectures every morning) to everyone else: 234,955 to 1.
Percentage of Chem 35 students who are attractive: 15 percent.
Percentage of Chem 35 students who are non-athletes and still attrac
tive: 0.3 percent.
The ratio of people who spend most of class doing The Daily's cross
word puzzle and ignoring that annoying woman jabbering in the front of

CS 105: Introduction to Computers
The benefits: Are you majoring in something blazingly fuzzy? Do you se
cretly envy people who get to bitch about their ridiculous pre-med and engi
neering course loads? Fear not, friendly fuzzy. CS 105: "Introduction to Com
puters" will (sort of and temporarily) give you that long-lost license to bitch.
Bet you didn't know: Bask in the many invaluable insights such as "if
you're going to open up your computer, make sure it is unplugged first."...
You just blew my mind, mister.
Ratio of guys to girls: Ra-tio? What the fuck? The syllabus said minimal
math. The only equation I have so far is 8 bits = 1 byte. So, um. I'll have to
go arbitrarily with 8 to 1.
Things you can play with: You thought interactive learning ended with
your field trips to the aquarium in the third grade? Think again. You'll get
to handle the juicy innards of a real (formerly) working computer. . . and
you thought holding a starfish was badass.

Snacks: If you count practical knowledge pertaining to basic pro
gramming methodology as food, then yes. Otherwise not at all: although
you'll be able to grab food from the Jordan Hall Cafe with significantly
shorter lines.
Ways to pretend you're taking a more difficult class: Make it a point to
let everyone know you're taking CS. But when faced with specifics, say
"10-" then slur the rest. You should run away for good measure. Or pick
a topic covered within the course, such as HTML or JAVA, and claim
that's the title of the course. Again, follow it up by sprinting away.
More benefits: Most importantly, you can now stumble out of your hall
way at 2 a.m. and lament "damn CS assignment" then nod in condescen
sion .. . and return to your room to resume watching cartoons.

ENGLISH 109: Masterpieces of English Literature I:
Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton and their Contemporaries

Taught by a professor who both knows his stuff and seems impas
sioned by it.the class is always engaging. Even the most sea
soned of English majors find Milton. Shake
speare and Chaucer about as exciting

as cardboard. Somehow, this

magician of a professor
is not only able to sug
arcoat. but compile an
entire wedding cake on
top of the otherwise
dull, dense and confus-

ing reading. With his
TAs as assistants and a
sly wink in his eye. with a
puff of smoke and a blast

of fireworks, he trans
forms Milton's confused
lines into jokes and anec
dotes. Somehow, he has yet

to break the fire code. If he
is able to breathe such life
into dead texts as these, I'd
like to call him for my next
exorcism.

IHUM 60: Sex — Its Pleasures
and Cultures

Finally, the people working in
the I-Hum department realized
what the entertainment industry

became aware of decades ago: Sex '
sells. Does one need any more evi
dence than a packed lecture hall on a

Tuesday morning? Unfortunately,
Stanford courses with interesting ti
tles never live up to the students' ex
pectations.

This course has no group lab section. There are no live demonstrations
during lectures. The course reader was not copyrighted by Larry Flynt.
And the professors won't answer questions like "Does ribbed really make
a difference?" or "Is it better to trim or shave?" or "Am I a pervert?"
Sadly, this course isn't like an excerpt from "Monty Python's the Mean
ing of Life." It's also not a course that will necessarily get you aroused be
fore lunch. In fact, sexual experience isn't even a prerequisite. But the fact
that it's a class about sex is enough to keep most students interested.
In one class (Oct. 5), the professor used the words "sex" or "sexual" 32
times. The next highest utterance was "pornography" or "porn" coming in
with a total of 23. "Prostitution" and "lesbian" both tied for third place by
being mentioned eight times each. Everyone dedicated to gender equality
should note that "vagina" was said three times, but "penis" was never men
tioned. And to prove that this course offers something of interest to every
body. the Nazis tied Jesus by both being mentioned once.
Despite the lack of "Debbie Does Dallas." one semi-naked image did
make it to the overhead projector. The pic
ture de

picted a man who was as tall as a woman's naked crotch. But who really
wants to watch a porno after hearing the story of a censored play that ended
with Jack the Ripper cutting out a woman's vagina and mailing it to a news
paper? The class focuses more on societal response to sex than actual sex.
Still, it I were debating whether to take the sex I-Hum or the citizenship
I-llum. I think the choice is easy. I-Hum has come a long way since 1 was a
freshman.

IHUM 60: Sex — Its Pleasures
and Cultures

Finally, the people working in
the I-Hum department realized
what the entertainment industry

became aware of decades ago: Sex '
sells. Does one need any more evi
dence than a packed lecture hall on a

Tuesday morning? Unfortunately,
Stanford courses with interesting ti
tles never live up to the students' ex
pectations.

This course has no group lab section. There are no live demonstrations
during lectures. The course reader was not copyrighted by Larry Flynt.
And the professors won't answer questions like "Does ribbed really make
a difference?" or "Is it better to trim or shave?" or "Am I a pervert?"
Sadly, this course isn't like an excerpt from "Monty Python's the Mean
ing of Life." It's also not a course that will necessarily get you aroused be
fore lunch. In fact, sexual experience isn't even a prerequisite. But the fact
that it's a class about sex is enough to keep most students interested.
In one class (Oct. 5), the professor used the words "sex" or "sexual" 32
times. The next highest utterance was "pornography" or "porn" coming in
with a total of 23. "Prostitution" and "lesbian" both tied for third place by
being mentioned eight times each. Everyone dedicated to gender equality
should note that "vagina" was said three times, but "penis" was never men
tioned. And to prove that this course offers something of interest to every
body. the Nazis tied Jesus by both being mentioned once.
Despite the lack of "Debbie Does Dallas." one semi-naked image did
make it to the overhead projector. The pic
ture de

picted a man who was as tall as a woman's naked crotch. But who really
wants to watch a porno after hearing the story of a censored play that ended
with Jack the Ripper cutting out a woman's vagina and mailing it to a news
paper? The class focuses more on societal response to sex than actual sex.
Still, it I were debating whether to take the sex I-Hum or the citizenship
I-llum. I think the choice is easy. I-Hum has come a long way since 1 was a

ENGLISH 90 — Fiction writing
Everyone wants to take fiction writing. Perhaps it has something to do
with Stanford students considering them selves naturally creative. Maybe
some students enjoy writing but never find the time for it unless it involves a
5-unit, 12-person classroom setting. It could be that some students intend for
this to be their "easy" class (hardly the case). And perhaps even a handful of
students take this class to improve the mastery of the short-story art form.
Whatever the reason, English 90 is one of the most widely taken classes

at Stanford and typically has a balance of males and females,
a spread of all class years and a wide selection of rep
resented majors.

Of course, prepare yourself for
the inevitable handful of 12-

page stories about or
phaned, beaten, sexu
ally-frustrated, les
bian, house-wives ad
dicted to morphine be-

cause they were mo
lested by their foster
parent who also turned
out to be the town's
preacher. For such a
sunny, laid-back cam
pus, students have some
weird morbid interest in

making their characters
pathetic, suffering hyp
ocrites. Everyone seems
to have some desire to
create some touching,
dramatic piece of art. Or
maybe that's just how
students perceive the
short story genre.

In any case, get ready
for stories where nothing
happens, nobody changes
and everybody ends up
either dead by suicide or
miserable. One note to all
aspiring creative writers:

There are other ways to
give characters motiva
tion than to kill off their
parents.

And be warned that
this class is not for those
weak in confidence. Part
of every student's grade
depends on how well they

ruthlessly disparage the work of their peers. Is a bitch-fest helpful? De
pends on the writer.
So take this class if you have the desire to unleash your tiny creative
monster that is slowly being devoured by the oppressive forces of I-Hum,
PWR and WIM. It not only compels students to write a first, second and
occasionally third draft, but also brings them the much-needed feedback
mechanism for improving stories. But if you're looking fora classroom of
people to reaffirm your beliefs in your superiority of the fiction craft, it's

HUM 810 11: Sleep and Dreams
Professor: Dr. William Dement.
Listing: Techie / Fuzzy = fuchie.
Units: 3.
Mantra: "Drowsiness is Red Alert."
Concepts include: Sleep debt, sleep apnea, lucid dreaming, sleep cycles,
sexual arousal during sleep and more.
Number of students: About 1,000.
Gender balance: 1 to 1.
Lecture location: Memorial Auditorium.
Section: None.
Lab: None.
Midterm: None.
Final exam: None.

awareness in the community.
Highlights: Narcoleptic dogs.
Extra credit given for: Falling asleep during lecture; shouting "red
alert" during lecture; getting celebrities to say "drowsiness is red alert" on
camera.
Course description: The class covered a variety of topics relating to
sleep. Students gain an understanding of why they are constantly sleepy
and learn methods for improving sleep. The class will explain what actual
ly happens to a person when he sleeps.
' The downside: THIS CLASS WILL NEVER BE OFFERED DURING
YOUR STANFORD CAREER. Sorry frosh.
ME 101: Visual Thinking
Assigned to random groups and forced to bond with them fora whole

Engineering majors. There aren't any technical requirements, just creativ
ity and a willingness to work your ass off fora quarter. If your assignment
is to build a machine that throws a frisbee 50 feet and catches it, it's per
fectly valid to list "Have a monkey do it" as a potential solution in the ini
tial stages of the project.
Remember building elaborate Styrofoam dioramas of the solar system
and piecing together "log" cabins with only pretzels and Elmer's glue?
Here's a class that encourages you to revisit your childhood school pro
jects. Be prepared to stay up late nights, fueled by ramen and Red Bull,
with people you might not like (but are essential to getting the project
done), in order to find the NEXT BIG IDEA (like teleportation devices
that also microwave your food), swimming in a sea of foam core, exacto

CHEM 35: Organic Monofunctional Compounds
As a decidedly non-pre-med senior, I never expected great things from
my required quarter of Chem 35. But even I was surprised as I surveyed
Braun Auditorium on the first day of classes from my stool in the hack of
the room. Looking around. I decided that if every class at Stanford were
like this one, we'd be almost as awesome as Harvard. Here are some brief
statistics that should illuminate my position.
Ratio of students to professor: 234,956 to 1.
The average percentage of students sitting in aisles, standing at the back
of the room, or otherwise spending their 50-minute class unable to nap be
cause of physical discomfort: 65 percent.
Number of different outfits Prof. Huestis has worn in two weeks of
classes: 2.5.
Ratio of sophomores (who, having lost their will to live after they
packed their "Branner sucks" signs into Shurgards for the summer, re
signed themselves to being pre med and sleeping through two hours of
Hum Bio lectures every morning) to everyone else: 234,955 to 1.
Percentage of Chem 35 students who are attractive: 15 percent.
Percentage of Chem 35 students who are non-athletes and still attrac

The ratio of people who spend most of class doing The Daily's cross
word puzzle and ignoring that annoying woman jabbering in the front of
the classroom, to people who have a good idea of what she's actually talk
ing about: 234,952 to 4.
Number of compounds that Chem 35 students can actually assign cor
rect lUPAC names to: 5 to 8.
Average number of words used in class that are understood by anyone
besides the TAs: 6 ("Today we're going to talk about. .. ")

ME 101: Visual Thinking
Assigned to random groups and forced to bond with them fora whole
month while working on projects, it's a good way to meet hot Mechanical
Engineering majors. There aren't any technical requirements, just creativ
ity and a willingness to work your ass off fora quarter. If your assignment
is to build a machine that throws a frisbee 50 feet and catches it, it's per
fectly valid to list "Have a monkey do it" as a potential solution in the ini
tial stages of the project.
Remember building elaborate Styrofoam dioramas of the solar system
and piecing together "log" cabins with only pretzels and Elmer's glue?
Here's a class that encourages you to revisit your childhood school pro
jects. Be prepared to stay up late nights, fueled by ramen and Red Bull,
with people you might not like (but are essential to getting the project
done), in order to find the NEXT BIG IDEA (like teleportation devices
that also microwave your food), swimming in a sea of foam core, exacto
knives and hot glue guns, brainstorming your way towards oblivion.
