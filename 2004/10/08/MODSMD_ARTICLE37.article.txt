New music
Dizzcc Rascal just put out
"Showtime," the follow up to his
Mercury Prize-winning debut (the
Mercury Prize is the British equiva
lent of the Grammy). This is the
sound of flickering neon lights and
late-night tension. Dizzee delivers
one of the most unique voices and
flows in hip hop, although his musi
cal production has a lot more in
common with the British garage
scene and techno heats. No matter
how many times you hear his songs,
the beats never seem to hit when
you predict â€” like there's some
thing thrown off in your mental
metronome. The music is rough,
perfect for blasting on the low
quality pirate radio stations where
Dizzee cut his teeth. Awesome.
Strong Bad is burninating the
country side on his own album.
The most popular character
from Home Star Runner now
has his own compilation CD of
songs from the Web site. Hey
computer nerds, look for Strong
Bad Sings and complete your col
lection of computer music.
Trax Records wrote the book
on acid house back in the '80s,
and now you can try to wrap
your head around this twisted
warpfest of broken beats and
laser beams. "Acid Classics"
compiles the best of this mad
ness for your consumption. This
is some mental stuff (psyche
delics not included).
New hands on the street
Circus vs. Andre Af'ran Asmar
present "Gawd Bless the Soulless
Cowards," a jarring production of
politically-charged experimental
hip-hop and alien worship. These
kids write some impressive lyrics
dealing with the complex prob
lems of social conformity and how
to be a patriot without being a
mindless drone. This is not hip
hop to get the party started, but
it'll give you a lot of food for
thought, so check it out. Plus,
these guys love aliens, so what's
not to like about them?
