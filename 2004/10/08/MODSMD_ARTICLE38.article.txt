# Smilinâ€™ for the mic
## Wilson overcomes Beatles-induced breakdown 
### BONNIE JOHNSON INTERMISSION WRITER 
"... I been taken for lost and
gone and unknown fora long, long
time." So sings The Beach Boys'
mastermind Brian Wilson in "He
roes and Villains," the would-be sin
gle of the longest-awaited album in
rock history. "Smile" has been the
subject of such intense and protract
ed hype in the years since its incep
tion, it's a wonder that anyone would
have the guts to finish such a project
and confront the sky-high expecta
tions of those who have followed it.
It's a particularly impressive vic
tory for Wilson. The story goes like
this: Obsessed with creating the per
fect pop statement, Wilson broke
down upon hearing Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1%7.

sions for "Smile" and into a mental
abyss compounded by a lack of sup
port from family, friends and the
music industry (and let's face it. lots
of acid probably didn't help).
Numerous bootlegs ensued,
but folks eventually learned to
stop holding their collective
breath for the release of the ru
mored masterpiece.
Thirty-seven years later, Wilson
has returned to and completed the
appropriate sequel to "Pet Sounds."
Released on the small Warner Music
division Nonesuch, "Smile" is to
some extent a record out of its time,
emerging now as a missing link in the
aural history of the sixties. The
album explains everything about
Wilson and the psychedelic move

do not. Co-authored by lyricist Van
Dyke Parks, this is a distinctly Cali
fornian vision of history, human life
and the natural world.
The album is divided by concept
into three parts: Americana, Cycle
of Life and Elements, with cyclical
arrangements connecting songs
from different parts of the record.
The unconventional structures of
the album and the songs themselves
can at first make the record feel like

a series of fragments loosely strung
together, but the various pieces
quickly reveal themselves to be inte
gral to the record and to each other,
their textures complementary.
Crafted mirages of tropical deca
dence and a sweetly childlike atti

satanic when played backward or.

"Shit, is tfiat the right note?" A senile Brian Wilson slowly inches his way through his fresh "hit" "Heroes and Villains."
Wilson, who has been battling a lack of songwriting ability since the late 19605, has finally reached a sufficient state of
denial so as to allow him to feel comfortable releasing his newest album "Smile." (Just kidding folks, it's actually quite good.)
Boys were unparalleled, and creative
instrumentation that includes sounds
from the barnyard and the tool shed
as well as touches of the whimsical
bells, whistles and bike horns that
graced tracks on "Pet Sounds."
It's appropriate that "Smile" ends
in perhaps the one sung on which fans,
critics and Wilson himself have always
agreed: "Good Vibrations." And
when the record ends, the real ques
tion is whether "Smile" is as visionary
now as it would have been in 1 %7. In
