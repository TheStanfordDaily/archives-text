# Do you know the way to 'Travistan,' my friend?

### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
Travis Morrison wants to teach
us a lesson. A history lesson. It's
about a faraway place called "Trav
istan" where the harsh realities of
"fact" and "complexity" don't exist,
and where Prof. Morrison can
preach about great men featured on
our currency and in our holy books
using both strange new phrases and
tired old cliches.
Sometimes, Prof. Morrison's

class is great: He's funny, he's inter
esting. and you don't even want to
do the crossword during lecture. His
words echo in your head for long af
terwards.
Unfortunately, most of the time
the professor is superficial, glib and
more than a little awkward. How do
you reconcile these extremes on a
course evaluation? I have no idea
how to assess the quality of a song
with solid hooks, multilayered in
strumental and a beautifully haunt
ing tone, but whose lyrics retell in

gory, self-pitying detail a childhood
beating and end in the repetition of
"All 1 want for Christmas is my two
front teeth / my two front teeth / my
two front teeth."
The former lead singer / song
writer / guitarist of indie superstars
The Dismemberment Plan diverges
from the fresh intrigue of Emer
gency and I and Change, but brings
with him serious songwriting skills
that are immediately apparent. His
melodies are catchy and can hold
their own with the help of nothing

but a beat, even when his lyrics
make you cringe. On the album's
best track, the referentially titled
"Change," Morrison half-sings
over some drums and sporadic,
mostly synthesized chords, climax
ing with a rhythmic Odelav-esque
chanting of "Check your pulse now
/ It's heart attack time." It's spirit
ed, it's fun and. if you don't pay too
close attention to the Moses anec
dotes, it's thoroughly enjoyable.
