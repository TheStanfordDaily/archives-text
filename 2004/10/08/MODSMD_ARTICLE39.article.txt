# Do you know the way to 'Travistan,' my friend?
## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
Travis Morrison wants to teach
us a lesson. A history lesson. It's
about a faraway place called "Trav
istan" where the harsh realities of
"fact" and "complexity" don't exist,
and where Prof. Morrison can
preach about great men featured on
our currency and in our holy books
using both strange new phrases and
tired old cliches.
Sometimes, Prof. Morrison's

class is great: He's funny, he's inter
esting. and you don't even want to
do the crossword during lecture. His
words echo in your head for long af
terwards.
Unfortunately, most of the time
the professor is superficial, glib and
more than a little awkward. How do
you reconcile these extremes on a
course evaluation? I have no idea
how to assess the quality of a song
with solid hooks, multilayered in
strumental and a beautifully haunt
ing tone, but whose lyrics retell in

gory, self-pitying detail a childhood
beating and end in the repetition of
"All 1 want for Christmas is my two
front teeth / my two front teeth / my
two front teeth."
The former lead singer / song
writer / guitarist of indie superstars
The Dismemberment Plan diverges
from the fresh intrigue of Emer
gency and I and Change, but brings
with him serious songwriting skills
that are immediately apparent. His
melodies are catchy and can hold
their own with the help of nothing

but a beat, even when his lyrics
make you cringe. On the album's
best track, the referentially titled
"Change," Morrison half-sings
over some drums and sporadic,
mostly synthesized chords, climax
ing with a rhythmic Odelav-esque
chanting of "Check your pulse now
/ It's heart attack time." It's spirit
ed, it's fun and. if you don't pay too
close attention to the Moses anec
dotes, it's thoroughly enjoyable.
At other moments, however,
Morrison sings serious and bitter
lyrics without irony. His vocals have
shifted from raw and grating rock to
tones more evocative of Hen Folds.
Other bands have written beautiful
albums with historical themes that
lacked irony — the psychedelic

ic Decemberists, for example — to
much better results. They succeed
where Morrison fails because they
treat their subjects with a depth and
vividness that Morrison does not
even attempt.
As if to alert the reader of his
superficial approach, Morrison
briefly grazes over four presidents
in short, dispersed "Get Me Off
This Coin" interludes that include
such weiijhtv lines as. "I like my na

tions in constant revolution / And
my booty wide." It's a far cry from
Jeff Magnum's serious exploration
of the psyche of Anne Frank:
"Anna's ghost all around/ Hear
her voice as it's rolling and ringing
through me."
But Morrison can't laugh at him
self any better than he can take him
self seriously. His silly "Coin" inter
ludes also serve as contemporary
political commentary by including

(weak) shots at the current adminis
tration. And when it's not history,
it's philosophy. "People Die," com
prised of (often amusing and mildly
enlightening) limerick-like couplets,
is too heavy in subject matter to be
taken lightly, but too glib to be taken
seriously.
If there wasn't so much to admire
in Morrison's previous work with
Dismemberment Flan — witty and
subtle lyrics, interesting and unex-

pected arrangements, and, of
course, a fair dose of poppy accessi
bility— "Travistan" might seem
like a promising first album. But by
now, we've learned to expect more
from Morrison.
