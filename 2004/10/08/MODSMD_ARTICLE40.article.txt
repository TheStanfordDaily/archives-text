# Politically Republican (in bed): Roxy loves the Dick and Bush
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Docs anyone else gel slightly
aroused by these debates, speeches
and campaigns for president?
Everyone's starting to get into it. All
the major news organizations have
started "pundit scorecards" to deter
mine who appeared to be the better
man in each debate, but these people
forget what's most important when
judging a man's qualifications: sex. 1
mean, how often do a bunch of guys
try so hard just to please you? In
stead of debating policy, we should
debate which duo offers the best po
tential menage a trois. So. here's a
review of the candidates, Roxy
style.
John Kdwurds: This is the natural
man to start with because John lid
wards is obviously the hottest piece
of meat on the political market. That
shiny, lustrous hair, that winning
Crest-enhanced smile and that sexy
Southern accent will get any
woman's panties in a twist. Before
the debates, Johnny was my clear fa
vorite.
However, I've recently changed
my mind about Mr. Edwards. Let's
start with the fact that he's always
smiling. And that perpetual smile

never changes. Whether engaging in
cunnilingus or while exclaiming

"Oh! I seriously douht his
megawatt grin ever fades. It's
creepy. Of course, the sex
might not be that great, be
cause — as the GOP points
out — he lacks experience.
He's young and has potential,
but I've been disappointed by
plenty of young, pretty boys.
Those older, political sluts
know how to work it, but John
ny needs a little more practice.
Dick Cheney: By far the
least attractive of all candi
dates. I lis shiny bowling ball of
a head, beady eyes and general
disdain for humanity turns me
off. Not to mention that his
heart probably couldn't handle
a night with Roxy. Does this
man have anything going for
him? Well, he does get points
for his first name. In fact, I
think Dick is grossly underesti
mated in the bedroom depart
ment. It's usually the straight
laced, dorky intellectuals who
dream up the kinkiest ways to
make the night fly by. I defi
nitely see a potential S&M side

to the VP, who was much more
forceful than his debate partner.

Who wouldn't want to sleep with a
man who's been compared to Darth

Vader? Can't you imagine him
wielding whips and leather-covered

handcuffs? A night with Dick might
be a night to remember.

John Kerry: Now we've
moved onto the big bovs —
the presidential candidates.
Basically, Kerry is a sure thing.
He was so rigid at the podium
that he's guaranteed to also be
stiff in bed (without the male
enhancing powers of Viagra).
Even his silvery pompadour is
stiff, thanks to industrial
strength Aqua Net hairspray.
And, based on his voting
record. I know he would hap
pily alternate between being
on top and on bottom. Maybe
he'd even give doggystyle or
the reverse cowgirl position a
whirl. Unpredictability in the
sack is a plus, unlike shaky po
litical stances. And a double
dipper with him and his run
ning mate only requires me to
shout out one name: "Ohhhh
hh, John!" Unfortunately, a
post-coital conversation might
soon stray into some awkward
— yet standard — Kerry topic
territory:
"So how was it for you. John?"
"Well, when I was serving

in Vietnam as a young man, I had
this one girl who ..."

George W. Bush: How could you
not find this man cute during the de
hates? His big ears and his little
monkey face are adorably endear
ing. Also, this man would under
stand the meaning of post-orgasm
"quiet time" because he wouldn't
say more than he has to.
It's a shame that Georgie is def
initely the jealous lover type. He's a
man who keeps a shotgun in the
closet and wouldn't hesitate to use
it against any other guys he might
suspect have also experienced my
Womanly Masochistic Desires.
And then he would lapse into con
sistent. sappy rhetoric in a futile at
tempt to arouse some emotional re
sponse from me. This is a man who
would answer all my questions
with. "Baby, 1 love you." Big turn
off. On the other hand, there's
something sexy about those
"moral" fellows.
So where do 1 get my action from
for the next four years? It's a hard
choice, but 1 would have to give my
vote for the G "Ohh!'P. I know that
Georgie has plenty of vacation time
to spend with me. And Cheney has
plenty of money to keep me happily
occupied and pampered. How could
I pass up the chance for both Dick
and Bush?

plenty of young, pretty boys.
Those older, political sluts
know how to work it, but John
ny needs a little more practice.
Dick Cheney: By far the
least attractive of all candi
dates. I lis shiny bowling ball of
a head, beady eyes and general
disdain for humanity turns me
off. Not to mention that his
heart probably couldn't handle
a night with Roxy. Does this
man have anything going for
him? Well, he does get points
for his first name. In fact, I
think Dick is grossly underesti
mated in the bedroom depart
ment. It's usually the straight
laced, dorky intellectuals who
dream up the kinkiest ways to
make the night fly by. I defi
nitely see a potential S&M side

to the VP, who was much more
forceful than his debate partner.

Who wouldn't want to sleep with a
man who's been compared to Darth

Vader? Can't you imagine him
wielding whips and leather-covered

handcuffs? A night with Dick might
be a night to remember.

John Kerry: Now we've
moved onto the big bovs —
the presidential candidates.
Basically, Kerry is a sure thing.
He was so rigid at the podium
that he's guaranteed to also be
stiff in bed (without the male
enhancing powers of Viagra).
Even his silvery pompadour is
stiff, thanks to industrial
strength Aqua Net hairspray.
And, based on his voting
record. I know he would hap
pily alternate between being
on top and on bottom. Maybe
he'd even give doggystyle or
the reverse cowgirl position a
whirl. Unpredictability in the
sack is a plus, unlike shaky po
litical stances. And a double
dipper with him and his run
ning mate only requires me to
shout out one name: "Ohhhh
hh, John!" Unfortunately, a
post-coital conversation might
soon stray into some awkward
— yet standard — Kerry topic
territory:
"So how was it for you. John?"
"Well, when I was serving

in Vietnam as a young man, I had
this one girl who ..."

George W. Bush: How could you
not find this man cute during the de
hates? His big ears and his little
monkey face are adorably endear
ing. Also, this man would under
stand the meaning of post-orgasm
"quiet time" because he wouldn't
say more than he has to.
It's a shame that Georgie is def
initely the jealous lover type. He's a
man who keeps a shotgun in the
closet and wouldn't hesitate to use
it against any other guys he might
suspect have also experienced my
Womanly Masochistic Desires.
And then he would lapse into con
sistent. sappy rhetoric in a futile at
tempt to arouse some emotional re
sponse from me. This is a man who
would answer all my questions
with. "Baby, 1 love you." Big turn
off. On the other hand, there's
something sexy about those
"moral" fellows.
So where do 1 get my action from
for the next four years? It's a hard
choice, but 1 would have to give my
vote for the G "Ohh!'P. I know that
Georgie has plenty of vacation time
to spend with me. And Cheney has
plenty of money to keep me happily
occupied and pampered. How could
I pass up the chance for both Dick
and Bush?

Docs anyone else gel slightly
aroused by these debates, speeches
and campaigns for president?
Everyone's starting to get into it. All
the major news organizations have
started "pundit scorecards" to deter
mine who appeared to be the better
man in each debate, but these people
forget what's most important when
judging a man's qualifications: sex. 1
mean, how often do a bunch of guys
try so hard just to please you? In
stead of debating policy, we should
debate which duo offers the best po
tential menage a trois. So. here's a
review of the candidates, Roxy
style.
John Kdwurds: This is the natural
man to start with because John lid
wards is obviously the hottest piece
of meat on the political market. That
shiny, lustrous hair, that winning
Crest-enhanced smile and that sexy
Southern accent will get any
woman's panties in a twist. Before
the debates, Johnny was my clear fa
vorite.
However, I've recently changed
my mind about Mr. Edwards. Let's
start with the fact that he's always
smiling. And that perpetual smile

never changes. Whether engaging in
cunnilingus or while exclaiming

"Oh! I seriously douht his
megawatt grin ever fades. It's
creepy. Of course, the sex
might not be that great, be
cause — as the GOP points
out — he lacks experience.
He's young and has potential,
but I've been disappointed by
plenty of young, pretty boys.
Those older, political sluts
know how to work it, but John
ny needs a little more practice.
Dick Cheney: By far the
