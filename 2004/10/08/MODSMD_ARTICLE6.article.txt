# McCullum making most of new role
## 
### ALEX GYR 
Unlike many Division 1 football players, Justin Mc-
Cullum didn't play pee-wee football, or even middle
school football. In fact, McCullum didn't start playing
football until he got to high school.
"My dad didn't let me play until high school, me or
my brother," said McCullum, whose brother Jamien
played football on the Farm from 1997 to 2001.
it's surprising considering that McCullum's father,
Sam, played 10 years as a wideout in the NFL for the
Seattle Seahawks and the Minnesota Vikings.
Luckily for McCullum, he was given an opportuni
ty to play high school football, where he shined, be
coming a consensus Prep All-American. He was
ranked as one of the top 15 prep receivers in the na
tion. He also set records in receptions, receiving yards,
and receiving touchdowns while at Mercer Island High
School in his hometown of Mercer Island, Washing
ton.
"High school came and I got my chance to play
football, and I fell in love with it," McCullum said.
McCullum followed in the footsteps of his brother
Jamien in coming to Stanford.
"He was definitely the number one reason that I
came here. We missed each other by one year in high
school, so I got to come here and play a year with him,
which is something that I will treasure for the rest of
my life."
Four years into his Stanford career McCullum is
blossoming into one of the many receiving threats on
the talented corps of Cardinal wideouts. Serving as the
number-three option behind sophomore receivers
Evan Moore and Mark Bradford. McCullum, a red
shirt junior, has seen more and more action, receiving
his first career start against USC.
Through four games this season, McCullum has 12
receptions for 195 yards and one touchdown, including
a 115-yard performance in the opening game against
San Jose State.
While the San Jose State performance yielded no
scores for McCullum. he displayed his ability to use his
si/e (6-4. 220), making a spectacular catch taking the
ball down to the San Jose State one-yard line.
McCullum has already tripled his yardage from the
2003 season, when he played all eleven games but had
only seven receptions for 64 yards.
McCullum sees his improvement as his natural
growth as an athlete.
"It's just getting better as a player. Hard work is
just finally paying off. I don't think there was a huge
leap â€” it was an opportunity, and I took advantage
of it."
McCullum hasn't had it easy through his Stanford
career. After redshirting his freshman year, McCul
lum suffered a knee injury early in training camp be
fore the 2002 season, forcing him to miss the entire
year.
McCullum. who had never suffered a major injury
before, learned what going through the rehab process
was like.
"It really makes you grow up," he said. "I came
back and I wasn't nearly as good or fast or quick and it
really makes you appreciate each play more now."
Now that McCullum is back out on the field, he is
glad to be a part of this Cardinal team.
"We have a really tight-knit team. Everybody real
ly gets along. Everyone is similar, but everyone also
brings their own wrinkle to the team chemistry. Off the
field I love all my teammates, and that is really the best
part of this team," he said.
While he appreciates the friendships among team
mates, McCullum also sees the improvements that are
being made to the team, especially on the offensive

side ol the ball.
"Offensively it's good to see us have some success.
The last couple years we haven't had that much suc
cess, and it just boosts the team morale so much, not
just for the offense, but also the defense to see us go
out there and score some points."
This week the Cardinal travel to South Bend to take
on a Notre Dame team that embarrassed Stanford 57-
7 in 2003. McCullum is confident about the team's
chances.
"We have a good game plan," he said. "We
watched a couple games from teams like Purdue that

exploited some of their weaknesses."
While Notre Dame has looked inconsistent this
year, McCullum is ready to see the Irish at the top of
their game.
"I definitely think we'll face the best they have," he
said. "Coach Willingham knows how talented this
group is. I want to face their best team."
If Stanford is going to have success against Notre
Dame, the team is going to need McCullum to contin
ue to contribute his big-play ability as the Cardinal
head on the road for the first time this season.
