# Scholarship recognizes queer student
## 
### NICK PARKER 
In conjunction with Out on Cam
pus week, which began Monday,
mtvU and Chicago-based The Point
Foundation arc recognizing the
achievements of queer students at
schools across the country, includ
ing Stanford.
John Downey, Jr., a first-year
graduate student at the School of
Medicine, was awarded a scholar
ship last April from the Foundation,
which, according to its Web site, is
the nation's only Lesbian. Gay, Bi
sexual, Transgender and Queer
(LGBTQ) scholarship organization.
The Point Foundation is a non
profit organization that has given
over $1 million to college-bound
gays since 2001. A typical scholar
ship ranges from $5,000 to $28,000.
Downey, who would not tell The
Daily the amount of his scholarship,
is one of 27 students to receive the
award in 2004 and the first Stanford
student to be honored.
After growing up in a rural Con
necticut town, Downey graduated
summa cum laude from Amherst
College in 2003 with bachelor de
grees in biology and music.
He went on to earn several re
search fellowships, including one at
Princeton and one at Connecticut
College in the areas of stem cell
molecular genetics and im
munotherapy.
On its Web site, the group states
that it "provides financial support,
mentoring and hope to meritorious
students who are marginalized due
to sexual orientation or gender
identity."
Downey said in e-mail that he
first heard about the Foundation
from an article in "Bay Windows," a
New England LGBTQ newspaper
that profiled some of the inaugural
year scholarship winners.
He said his decision to apply for
the award was an easy one.
"The scholarship was generous:
it allowed study at any school; it was
geared toward students of academic
and extracurricular distinction; and
it required a demonstrated commit
ment to furthering the LGBTQ
community," he said.
Ethan Phillips, a spokesperson
for The Point Foundation, ex
plained the process for receiving the
scholarship.
"In order to win a scholarship,
students have to undergo a difficult,
rigid, competitive application pro
cess," he said.
"There is a minimum grade point
average requirement, and each ap
plicant must write multiple essays
that demonstrate why he or she de
serves a scholarship. This year, there
were over 1,000 applicants and only
27 winners."

He added that the recipients
must maintain at least a 3.5 GPA
while in school in order to keep their
scholarships.
In addition to the essays, the
foundation's board of trustees inter
views the applicants. Downey said
his interview focused on his future
commitment as a gay student.
"The interview asks each scholar
to discuss his intentions for how he
will address the changing needs of
the LGBTQ community both while
in school and in his future career,"
Downey said.
When asked why the scholarship
is targeted only at queer students,
Phillips pointed to the discrimina
tion against gays in America.
"In my opinion, gay students de
serve scholarships because of the in
tense marginalization and discrimi
nation that they are victims of. not
only in the academic world but also
in everyday life," Phillips said.
"Many times teachers think of
openly gay students as inferior to
their straight counterparts, and this
puts them at a decided disadvantage
from the start."
Downey agreed with Phillips,
saying, "It's very important that
gays have more representation in in
stitutions of higher learning in this
country. That is the only way they
will be better represented in the
workplace."
Phillips said that some recipi
ents have backgrounds that would
have prevented them from attend
ing college if not for The Point
Foundation.
"Many gay students come from
rural backgrounds where they live in
an unbelievably judgmental climate.
In turn, many of our scholarship
winners come from families that ei
ther disowned or were physically
abusive to them when they came
out."
Benjamin Davidson, the director
of Stanford's Lesbian. Gay, Bisexu
al and Transgender Community Re
source Center, said that he was un
aware of a 2004 Point Scholar at
Stanford.
While he said that he had written
recommendations for the award on
behalf of numerous Stanford stu
dents in the past few years, he had
not met Downey yet but looked for
ward to doing so.
Downey said he is optimistic
about the University's queer
community.
"I've only been here a month, but
it seems like there is tremendous po
tential within the LGBTQ commu
nity here at Stanford," he said.
"It is one of my goals this year to
make sure that there is communica
tion, cooperation and networking
that takes place between the LGBTQ
graduate groups on campus."

in everyday life," Phillips said.
"Many times teachers think of
openly gay students as inferior to
their straight counterparts, and this
puts them at a decided disadvantage
from the start."
Downey agreed with Phillips,
saying, "It's very important that
gays have more representation in in
stitutions of higher learning in this
country. That is the only way they
will be better represented in the
workplace."
Phillips said that some recipi
ents have backgrounds that would
have prevented them from attend
ing college if not for The Point
Foundation.
"Many gay students come from
rural backgrounds where they live in
an unbelievably judgmental climate.
In turn, many of our scholarship
winners come from families that ei
ther disowned or were physically
abusive to them when they came
out."
Benjamin Davidson, the director
of Stanford's Lesbian. Gay, Bisexu
al and Transgender Community Re
source Center, said that he was un
aware of a 2004 Point Scholar at
Stanford.
While he said that he had written
recommendations for the award on
behalf of numerous Stanford stu
dents in the past few years, he had
not met Downey yet but looked for
ward to doing so.
Downey said he is optimistic
about the University's queer
community.
"I've only been here a month, but
it seems like there is tremendous po
tential within the LGBTQ commu
nity here at Stanford," he said.
"It is one of my goals this year to
make sure that there is communica
tion, cooperation and networking
that takes place between the LGBTQ
graduate groups on campus."
In conjunction with Out on Cam
pus week, which began Monday,
mtvU and Chicago-based The Point
Foundation arc recognizing the
achievements of queer students at
schools across the country, includ
ing Stanford.
John Downey, Jr., a first-year
graduate student at the School of
Medicine, was awarded a scholar
ship last April from the Foundation,
which, according to its Web site, is
the nation's only Lesbian. Gay, Bi
sexual, Transgender and Queer
(LGBTQ) scholarship organization.
The Point Foundation is a non
profit organization that has given
over $1 million to college-bound
gays since 2001. A typical scholar
ship ranges from $5,000 to $28,000.
Downey, who would not tell The
Daily the amount of his scholarship,
is one of 27 students to receive the
award in 2004 and the first Stanford
student to be honored.
After growing up in a rural Con
necticut town, Downey graduated
summa cum laude from Amherst
College in 2003 with bachelor de
grees in biology and music.
He went on to earn several re
search fellowships, including one at
Princeton and one at Connecticut
College in the areas of stem cell
molecular genetics and im
munotherapy.
On its Web site, the group states
that it "provides financial support,
mentoring and hope to meritorious
students who are marginalized due
to sexual orientation or gender
identity."
Downey said in e-mail that he
first heard about the Foundation
from an article in "Bay Windows," a
New England LGBTQ newspaper
that profiled some of the inaugural
year scholarship winners.
He said his decision to apply for
the award was an easy one.
"The scholarship was generous:
it allowed study at any school; it was
geared toward students of academic
and extracurricular distinction; and
it required a demonstrated commit
ment to furthering the LGBTQ
community," he said.
Ethan Phillips, a spokesperson
for The Point Foundation, ex
plained the process for receiving the
scholarship.
"In order to win a scholarship,
students have to undergo a difficult,
rigid, competitive application pro
cess," he said.
"There is a minimum grade point
average requirement, and each ap
plicant must write multiple essays
that demonstrate why he or she de
serves a scholarship. This year, there
were over 1,000 applicants and only
27 winners."

He added that the recipients
must maintain at least a 3.5 GPA
while in school in order to keep their
scholarships.
In addition to the essays, the
foundation's board of trustees inter
views the applicants. Downey said
his interview focused on his future
commitment as a gay student.
"The interview asks each scholar
to discuss his intentions for how he
will address the changing needs of
the LGBTQ community both while
in school and in his future career,"
Downey said.
When asked why the scholarship
is targeted only at queer students,
Phillips pointed to the discrimina
tion against gays in America.
"In my opinion, gay students de
serve scholarships because of the in
tense marginalization and discrimi
nation that they are victims of. not
only in the academic world but also
in everyday life," Phillips said.
"Many times teachers think of
openly gay students as inferior to
their straight counterparts, and this
puts them at a decided disadvantage
from the start."
Downey agreed with Phillips,
saying, "It's very important that
gays have more representation in in
stitutions of higher learning in this

will be better represented in the
