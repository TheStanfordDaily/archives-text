## Turow critiques death penalty 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the midst of this election season, the
question of capital punishment has slipped
under the radar, said attorney and award-win
ning author Scott Turow at a speech last night
in Cubberley Auditorium, in which he argued
for the abolition of capital punishment.
The two presidential candidates are at op
posite ends of the spectrum on capital punish
ment.
Known to death-penalty abolitionists as the
"Texecutioner," Bush has allowed more exe
cutions than any other elected American offi
cial, overseeing over 150 executions in Texas
while he was governor and approving three
federal executions as president — the first
federal executions since 1963.
Kerry, on the other hand, has maintained
firm opposition to the death penalty over the
course of his career. He took support for capi
tal punishment off the Democratic platform
this year for the first time in over twelve years.
Kerry has only made one exception on his
stance; after the events of Sept. 11, he said he
would be in favor of capital punishment for

terrorists.
"Kerry doesn't even listen to the whole
question before answering that he is op
posed," said Turow. "If he is elected, I do not
expect to see any federal executions."
Turow explained, however, that the candi
dates' opposing stances on the issue have been
kept under the rug because of political con
cerns. Although Bush would be tempted to
play up the issue, because about 70 percent of
the American public favors the death penalty,
he has not done so because many Catholics —
generally death penalty opponents — are
swing voters this year.
Also, he said that swing states like Michi
gan, lowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota are
among the 12 states that do not practice capi
tal punishment.
The result of this political climate, he said,
is that neither candidate is really talking about
capital punishment, and the issue is not a hot
topic on people's minds — only about 60 peo
ple came to Cubberley last night, although the
Bookstore, which sponsored the event, had
expected a full house. A lack of publicity about

the event rather than student apathy explained
the low turnout, said Prof. Bill Abrams. a practic
ing attorney who does pro bono death penalty
cases and teaches a death penalty course and
sophomore seminar on campus. His class, "The
Death Penalty: Human Biology, Law. and Poli
cy," has grown from about 40 students when the
class started in 2002 to % students enrolled this
quarter.
After the talk, Turow told The Daily he was
surprised that there is no anti-death penalty stu
dent group on campus, but he noted that Abrams'
class might fill that niche.
Turow said that every quarter, he receives e
mails from students in Abrams' class soliciting his
perspective for their final papers.
The class is not taught to convince students one
way or the other on the death penalty, but rather
to challenge their critical thinking on the subject,
said Abrams. Even so, he said, several students
who have taken his class have pursued advocacy
upon graduation.
"Many of the students send me e-mails, or visit
or call even after they graduate to discuss the is
sues and seek opportunities to become advocates
in this area or pursue public policy or legal ca
reers," said Abrams. "Several have gone oil to
work at places like the Southern Center for
Human Rights in Atlanta and Texas Defenders
Inc. in Austin."

issue in election a political move

In addition to Abrams' class on the death penal
ty. the Law School is offering a seminar on wrong
ful convictions taught by Larry Marshall, who
came to Stanford this year from Northwestern.
Marshall headed up the wrongful convictions
project at Northwestern that contributed to the
exoneration of 13 people from death row and
helped to spark Gov. George Ryan to conduct a
comprehensive review of the capital punishment
system in Illinois. The review led Ryan to com
mute the sentences of all 164 inmates on Illinois'
death row in January 2003.
As he explained in last night's talk. Turow
served as a member of the 14-person panel that
reviewed Illinois'death row system. At the begin
ning of the review process, he said he had called
himself a death penalty agnostic. After reviewing
the system for two years, Turow said he decided
that "the state will never be able to exact the ulti
mate punishment for the ultimate evils without
also involving the innocent."
Turow spelled out several arguments against
the death penalty during his talk. He claimed it
was unable to deter crime, and that it was not nec
essary in the age of high security prisons. He also
said that the race of victims of capital crimes in
fluences whether a criminal goes to death row.ln
Illinois, he said, crimes against white victims arc
three and a half times more likely to receive capi
tal punishment than crimes against black victims.

Turow further considered the argument that
the death penalty is a necessary symbolic punish
ment to appease victims' families.
"That argument is a canard," said Turow, ex
plaining his belief that the justice system uses vic
tims' families "as a foil to cover our own retribu
tive impulses... which really lie at the heart of
the death penalty in America."
Although Turow said his talk was not designed
to be "a conversion experience," his arguments
did convince at least one student in the audience.
Sihong Chan came to the event in favor of the
death penalty on principle, but Turow caused him
to change his mind.
"I thought you could reform the system so that
it would punish the right crimes, but the endemic
problems in the system that he described suggest
that we should perhaps abolish the death penal
ty," said Chan.
Turow is a former fellow and lecturer at the
Stanford University Creative Writing Center. Be
tween working as a partner at a Chicago law firm
and taking on pro bono death penalty cases, he
has published several novels, including "Re
versible Errors" (2002), as well as many non-fic
tion pieces. After his speech last night, he signed
copies of his most recent non-fiction work, "Ulti
mate Punishment: A lawyer's reflections on deal

2003.

terrorists.
"Kerry doesn't even listen to the whole
question before answering that he is op
posed," said Turow. "If he is elected, I do not
expect to see any federal executions."
Turow explained, however, that the candi
dates' opposing stances on the issue have been
kept under the rug because of political con
cerns. Although Bush would be tempted to
play up the issue, because about 70 percent of
the American public favors the death penalty,
he has not done so because many Catholics —
generally death penalty opponents — are
swing voters this year.
Also, he said that swing states like Michi
gan, lowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota are
among the 12 states that do not practice capi
tal punishment.
The result of this political climate, he said,
is that neither candidate is really talking about
capital punishment, and the issue is not a hot
topic on people's minds — only about 60 peo
ple came to Cubberley last night, although the

expected a full house. A lack of publicity about

the event rather than student apathy explained
the low turnout, said Prof. Bill Abrams. a practic
ing attorney who does pro bono death penalty
cases and teaches a death penalty course and
sophomore seminar on campus. His class, "The
Death Penalty: Human Biology, Law. and Poli
cy," has grown from about 40 students when the
class started in 2002 to % students enrolled this
quarter.
After the talk, Turow told The Daily he was
surprised that there is no anti-death penalty stu
dent group on campus, but he noted that Abrams'
class might fill that niche.
Turow said that every quarter, he receives e
mails from students in Abrams' class soliciting his
perspective for their final papers.
The class is not taught to convince students one
way or the other on the death penalty, but rather
to challenge their critical thinking on the subject,
said Abrams. Even so, he said, several students
who have taken his class have pursued advocacy
upon graduation.
"Many of the students send me e-mails, or visit
or call even after they graduate to discuss the is
sues and seek opportunities to become advocates
in this area or pursue public policy or legal ca
reers," said Abrams. "Several have gone oil to
work at places like the Southern Center for
Human Rights in Atlanta and Texas Defenders
Inc. in Austin."

issue in election a political move

In addition to Abrams' class on the death penal
ty. the Law School is offering a seminar on wrong
ful convictions taught by Larry Marshall, who
came to Stanford this year from Northwestern.
Marshall headed up the wrongful convictions
project at Northwestern that contributed to the
exoneration of 13 people from death row and
helped to spark Gov. George Ryan to conduct a
comprehensive review of the capital punishment
system in Illinois. The review led Ryan to com
mute the sentences of all 164 inmates on Illinois'
death row in January 2003.
As he explained in last night's talk. Turow
served as a member of the 14-person panel that
reviewed Illinois'death row system. At the begin
ning of the review process, he said he had called
himself a death penalty agnostic. After reviewing
the system for two years, Turow said he decided
that "the state will never be able to exact the ulti
mate punishment for the ultimate evils without
also involving the innocent."
Turow spelled out several arguments against
the death penalty during his talk. He claimed it
was unable to deter crime, and that it was not nec
essary in the age of high security prisons. He also
said that the race of victims of capital crimes in
fluences whether a criminal goes to death row.ln
Illinois, he said, crimes against white victims arc
three and a half times more likely to receive capi
tal punishment than crimes against black victims.

Turow further considered the argument that
the death penalty is a necessary symbolic punish
ment to appease victims' families.
"That argument is a canard," said Turow, ex
plaining his belief that the justice system uses vic
tims' families "as a foil to cover our own retribu
tive impulses... which really lie at the heart of
the death penalty in America."
Although Turow said his talk was not designed
to be "a conversion experience," his arguments
did convince at least one student in the audience.
Sihong Chan came to the event in favor of the
death penalty on principle, but Turow caused him
to change his mind.
"I thought you could reform the system so that
it would punish the right crimes, but the endemic
problems in the system that he described suggest
that we should perhaps abolish the death penal
ty," said Chan.
Turow is a former fellow and lecturer at the
Stanford University Creative Writing Center. Be
tween working as a partner at a Chicago law firm
and taking on pro bono death penalty cases, he
has published several novels, including "Re
versible Errors" (2002), as well as many non-fic
tion pieces. After his speech last night, he signed
copies of his most recent non-fiction work, "Ulti
mate Punishment: A lawyer's reflections on deal
ing with the death penalty." published in October
2003.
In the midst of this election season, the
question of capital punishment has slipped
under the radar, said attorney and award-win
ning author Scott Turow at a speech last night
in Cubberley Auditorium, in which he argued
for the abolition of capital punishment.
The two presidential candidates are at op
posite ends of the spectrum on capital punish
ment.
Known to death-penalty abolitionists as the
"Texecutioner," Bush has allowed more exe
cutions than any other elected American offi
cial, overseeing over 150 executions in Texas
while he was governor and approving three
federal executions as president — the first
federal executions since 1963.
Kerry, on the other hand, has maintained
firm opposition to the death penalty over the
course of his career. He took support for capi
tal punishment off the Democratic platform
this year for the first time in over twelve years.
Kerry has only made one exception on his
stance; after the events of Sept. 11, he said he
would be in favor of capital punishment for

terrorists.
"Kerry doesn't even listen to the whole
question before answering that he is op
posed," said Turow. "If he is elected, I do not
