## Turow critiques death penalty 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the midst of this election season, the
question of capital punishment has slipped
under the radar, said attorney and award-win
ning author Scott Turow at a speech last night
in Cubberley Auditorium, in which he argued
for the abolition of capital punishment.
The two presidential candidates are at op
posite ends of the spectrum on capital punish
ment.
Known to death-penalty abolitionists as the
"Texecutioner," Bush has allowed more exe
cutions than any other elected American offi
cial, overseeing over 150 executions in Texas
while he was governor and approving three
federal executions as president — the first
federal executions since 1963.
Kerry, on the other hand, has maintained
firm opposition to the death penalty over the
course of his career. He took support for capi
tal punishment off the Democratic platform
this year for the first time in over twelve years.
Kerry has only made one exception on his
stance; after the events of Sept. 11, he said he
would be in favor of capital punishment for

terrorists.
"Kerry doesn't even listen to the whole
question before answering that he is op
posed," said Turow. "If he is elected, I do not
expect to see any federal executions."
Turow explained, however, that the candi
dates' opposing stances on the issue have been
kept under the rug because of political con
cerns. Although Bush would be tempted to
play up the issue, because about 70 percent of
the American public favors the death penalty,
he has not done so because many Catholics —
generally death penalty opponents — are
swing voters this year.
Also, he said that swing states like Michi
gan, lowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota are
among the 12 states that do not practice capi
tal punishment.
The result of this political climate, he said,
is that neither candidate is really talking about
capital punishment, and the issue is not a hot
topic on people's minds — only about 60 peo
ple came to Cubberley last night, although the
Bookstore, which sponsored the event, had
expected a full house. A lack of publicity about
