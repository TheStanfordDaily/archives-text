Yes, you.
It isn't always clear to people at first that they're right for the I). \i. Shaw group. Like
the poetry M.F.A. we hired to head an automated block trading unit. Or the woman
who designs solar-powered race cars; we hired her to help launch a new venture in
computational chemistry. They didn't think of themselves as "financial types," and
neither did we. We thought of them as people with extraordinary talent.
The I). E. Shaw group is an investment and technology development firm. Since
1988 we've grown into a number of closely related entities with approximately
US $8 billion in aggregate capital by hiring smart people from a wide range of
backgrounds and letting them implement—and manage—what they invent. A
robotics guru. A nationally ranked blackjack player. An operatic mezzo-soprano.
And a lot of people who are just exceptionally strong in CS, Fll, math, and finance.
The firm currently has openings in quantitative analysis, software development,
information technology, computer architecture, business development, compu
tational chemistry, accounting, finance, and trading. We're looking for creative
but pragmatic people: articulate, curious, and driven. Our working environment is
intense but surprisingly casual. We provide unusual opportunities for growth. And
we compensate extraordinary people extraordinarily well.
The D. E. Shaw group will host an information session today,
Wednesday, October 6, at 6:00 pm in the Gates Building, Room 104.
On-campus interviews will take place November 8. To apply for an inter
