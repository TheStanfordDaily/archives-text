# Ex-Planned Parenthood chief talks of struggles
## 
### SAMANTHA FLOAM 
Regardless of the outcome, the
2004 presidential election is the most
important one of our lifetime, said
Faye Wattleton. the former presi
dent of the Planned Parenthood
Federation of Ameriea and current
president of the Center for the Ad
vancement of Women.
Wattleton spoke to the Stanford
community last Friday in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium. Judge LaDoris
Cordell. vice provost for campus
relations, interviewed Wattleton
on various topics, from her family
and professional career to the his
tory of the struggle for women's re
productive rights and the upcoming
election.
Although most of the audience
appeared to have enjoyed the
speech, many told Wattleton after
ward that they wished that she had
spoken more about her current job
as president for the Center for the
Advancement of Women and the
election.
The event began with the screen
ing of a CNN news brief on the re
sults of a women's opinion poll,
which showed that violence and
equal pay top women's priorities,
while the legalization of abortion is
currently a low priority. After the
brief, Wattleton read excerpts from
her book "Life on the Line," which

was published in 19%, and answered
questions from Cordell.
Near the end of the talk, she
briefly discussed the importance of
the upcoming election for women's
issues.
She said that federal funding
failed to provide for female soldiers
who have been victims of rape or in
cest to receive abortions. Currently,
the Department of Defense allows
health facilities to perform abortions
if a woman is impregnated due to
rape or incest or if her life is in gan
ger. The woman must pay for the
abortion herself, however, in cases if
rape or incest.
Wattleton spent the majority of
the evening describing her family
history and upbringing. She over
came abuse and constant relocation
to become the first female president
of the Planned Parenthood Federa
tion of America since Margaret
Sanger founded the organization in
1917.
As she moved up the ranks dur
ing her 22 years at Planned Parent
hood. Wattleton said she faced op
position from her religious mother
and from many within the institu
tion. She claimed that at the nation
al level, the leadership of the organi
zation was comprised mostly of
white males, some of whom doubted

her leadership ability as an African-
American woman.
Wattleton referred to her time at
Planned Parenthood as "a challeng
ing and difficult learning period."
However, she said she believes that
being a minority gave her a "special
sensitivity to the purposes for which
the institution was constructed — a
way for women who could not pay to
ensure birth control."
When she left Planned Parent
hood in IW2, Wattleton said it had
become the seventh largest charita
ble organization in the country.
Wattleton did not speak in depth
about the Center for the Advance
ment of Women, a non-profit orga
nization dedicated to research and
the education ot society on women's
rights issues.
Wattleton said that she believes
that the upcoming election is ex
tremely important because the next
president will likely have to appoint
one or more Supreme Court Jus
tices. She also discussed the possibil
ity of a future woman president.
"Hillary Clinton has made it le
gitimate for women to enter the
White House and maybe even do a
better job than men have," she said.
Over 100 students and communi
ty members attended the talk.
"The speaker was very stately
and pinpointed issues of this genera
tion of college women, with particu
lar regard to the importance of the
upcoming election because so many
of us are ignorant about what we
stand to lose" said junior Neela
Penumarthy.
Alter her speech, Wattleton told
The Daily that universities should
take a leading role in promoting sex
ual health. She said that schools
should make certain that informa
tion and services are available to all
students and stressed the impor
tance of sexual health education
programs.
"There is an enormous problem
with sexual violence in society," she
said. "Universities should confront
these issues head-on."

American woman.
Wattleton referred to her time at
Planned Parenthood as "a challeng
ing and difficult learning period."

sensitivity to the purposes for which
the institution was constructed — a
way for women who could not pay to
ensure birth control."

hood in IW2, Wattleton said it had
become the seventh largest charita

White House and maybe even do a
better job than men have," she said.
Over 100 students and communi

and pinpointed issues of this genera

upcoming election because so many
of us are ignorant about what we
stand to lose" said junior Neela

Alter her speech, Wattleton told
The Daily that universities should
take a leading role in promoting sex

should make certain that informa

students and stressed the impor

programs.
"There is an enormous problem
with sexual violence in society," she
said. "Universities should confront
these issues head-on."
