### SAMANTHA FLOAM 
Regardless of the outcome, the
2004 presidential election is the most
important one of our lifetime, said
Faye Wattleton. the former presi
dent of the Planned Parenthood
Federation of Ameriea and current
president of the Center for the Ad
vancement of Women.
Wattleton spoke to the Stanford
community last Friday in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium. Judge LaDoris
Cordell. vice provost for campus
relations, interviewed Wattleton
on various topics, from her family
and professional career to the his
tory of the struggle for women's re
productive rights and the upcoming
election.
Although most of the audience
appeared to have enjoyed the
speech, many told Wattleton after
ward that they wished that she had
spoken more about her current job
as president for the Center for the
Advancement of Women and the
election.
The event began with the screen
ing of a CNN news brief on the re
sults of a women's opinion poll,
which showed that violence and
equal pay top women's priorities,
while the legalization of abortion is
currently a low priority. After the
brief, Wattleton read excerpts from
her book "Life on the Line," which

was published in 19%, and answered
questions from Cordell.
Near the end of the talk, she
briefly discussed the importance of
the upcoming election for women's
issues.
She said that federal funding
failed to provide for female soldiers
who have been victims of rape or in
cest to receive abortions. Currently,
the Department of Defense allows
health facilities to perform abortions
if a woman is impregnated due to
rape or incest or if her life is in gan
ger. The woman must pay for the
abortion herself, however, in cases if
rape or incest.
Wattleton spent the majority of
the evening describing her family
history and upbringing. She over
came abuse and constant relocation
to become the first female president
of the Planned Parenthood Federa
tion of America since Margaret
Sanger founded the organization in
1917.
As she moved up the ranks dur
ing her 22 years at Planned Parent
hood. Wattleton said she faced op
position from her religious mother
and from many within the institu
tion. She claimed that at the nation
al level, the leadership of the organi
zation was comprised mostly of
white males, some of whom doubted
