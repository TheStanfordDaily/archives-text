Playing it Straight
We couldn't find
a clock to tie the
room together
By MARK SLEE
and EVAN TANA
FEATURES COLUMNISTS
So about two weeks ago, we
moved into our new suite, and the
name of the game was room deco
rating. Some of you may know this
as interior decorating. We. too,
know this as interior decorating.
The fact is, the name of the game
was interior decorating.
We put up a few what-nots and
who-zits, and things were really
looking pretty good. Then a few of
our suitemates said to us, "Hey ca
daver, how about father time?"
We realized that they were right.
Our common room was lacking one
important thing: a clock.
Alas, we could waste away our
shameless lives playing all the Dr.
Mario we wanted on our scrump
tious silver television, but we would
not know the time.
Unfortunately, after examining
all the clocks available to us (ap
proximately two) we decided that
none of them properly gelled with
the stylistic moldings of our com
mon space. So the clocks had to go.
Now. let's think about this fora
second. We vetoed putting up a
clock in our common room because
it would have taken away from the
rest of our artwork (and most no
tably our Ikea track lighting ... oh
how we love those Swedish product
designers). This is a shame. A royal
shame.
But as pathetic as we are, who are
our suitemates to put up with such lu
dicrousness? And who are our suite
mates to put up with such ludicrositv!
We are seniors in college, and for
whatever reason we are less con
cerned with the time of day than we
are with convincing people that we
are cool because one of our moms is
a professional modern artist and the
other one of us is capable of making
custom (albeit dangerous) wiring
jobs for retail lights.
We might as well move into sub
urbia and start work on our Christ
mas lights display just so we can be
the proud owners of the one house
on the block that really takes the
cake come Santa-Day.
Even sadder, though, is the fact
that what we're doing isn't really all
that different than Captain Christ
mas with his rooftop nativity. Grant
ed, our holiday season will last a full
school year, but after that the decora
tions are coming down. And when
you think about it. all those Christ
mas decorations make for little more
than a shining beacon of materialism.
Speaking of shining beacons of
materialism, have we mentioned our
common room? It's really pretty
amazing. We have track lighting
from Ikea. It all boils down to the
American way of things. It's a free
market, and competition is the name
of the game.
Whose common room would you
rather steal booze from? We have
imported mango rum that you didn't
pay for. Sigma Chi has Natural Light
that your tuition probably somehow
paid for ... the choice is all but clear.
Really though, it's sad how much
we love our common room. It may
be nice for us to sit around in a few
hours out of the day, but with all the
money we spent on lighting and the
fines that we'll inevitably pay to
housing for the shelf mountings im
planted in our walls, we probably
could have done something better.
Hey. what if we lined the walls
with those light-up candy canes?
Mark Slee and Evan Tana are seniors

For many new students leaving home
for the first time, college is a departure
from home cooking, free laundry and
also family-oriented religion. Part of the
change lies in deciding how to practice
while they are away from the influence
of their parents. At Stanford, many find
that the newfound autonomy that comes
with college strengthens spirituality.
"College is a time of evolution," said
President of the Jewish Leadership
Council Carla Fenves, a junior. "Just like
you're finding your major [and] your
friends, you're finding your religion."
Alongside sports teams and commu
nity service projects in the University's
activity agenda exists a core of religious
groups that are quiet but thriving.
Stanford is home to religious groups
from Baha'i to Zoroastrianism. Accord
ing to Dean of Religious Life Scotty
McLennan, approximately half of Stan
ford students are affiliated to some de
gree with a religious institution.
While there is a core of religious groups at
Stanford, there are a number of individuals
who prefer to practice privately.
Aarti Rao. educator for the Hindu
Students Council, said, "If you want to
play soccer you can't just go out and kick
a soccer ball around yourself," as op
posed to religion which is perfectly plau
sible as an individual activity.
For those who would rather join a re
ligious community, Stanford Associated
Religions, an organization currently
comprised of thirty registered faiths,
aims to unite religious groups. Accord
ing to McLennan, the purpose of this or
ganization is to "ensure that members
represent [their respective] groupfs] and
purposes forthrightly while at the same
time respecting the religious traditions
of other groups."
Only about halt a dozen religious groups
on campus are unaffiliated with SAR.
A common goal of many student-run
religious groups is to invite members of the
Stanford community to learn about new
practices and beliefs. This leads to outreach
projects, interfaith retreats and dialogues,
concerts and intra-program discussions.
In fact, earlier this year, it led to the
creation of a new group altogether.
Mosaic, a multi-denominational
Christian organization, is an amalgam of
four formerly separate groups. One aim
of this union was to create a large forum
for Christian communication and worship
on campus and to spark discussion among
its members. This kind of cooperation al
lows students to practice their beliefs in a
more socially connected atmosphere.
This growing aspiration has led to ex
tensive interaction among different reli
gious communities. For example, Hillel,
a Jewish organization, sponsors Middle
East issues discussions to bring Jewish
and Muslim students together; they also
lead an interfaith retreat.
"I've gotten even more of a diverse
sense about other people and their reli
gions," Fenves said.
This sentiment is common. Members
of religious groups note that the open
ness of exchange among groups serves to
combat social barriers.
Priyanka Bakava. president of the
Hindu Students Council, remarked on
the ease with which international stu
dents get along.
"There's no barrier between people
from India and Pakistan," she pointed out.
McLennan echoed Bakaya's sentiment.
"Pluralism is really the name of the
game in the Bay Area," he said
