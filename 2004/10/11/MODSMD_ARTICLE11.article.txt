# Playing it Straight
## We couldn't find a clock to tie the room together 
### MARK SLEE EVAN TANA FEATURES COLUMNISTS 
So about two weeks ago, we
moved into our new suite, and the
name of the game was room deco
rating. Some of you may know this
as interior decorating. We. too,
know this as interior decorating.
The fact is, the name of the game
was interior decorating.
We put up a few what-nots and
who-zits, and things were really
looking pretty good. Then a few of
our suitemates said to us, "Hey ca
daver, how about father time?"
We realized that they were right.
Our common room was lacking one
important thing: a clock.
Alas, we could waste away our
shameless lives playing all the Dr.
Mario we wanted on our scrump
tious silver television, but we would
not know the time.
Unfortunately, after examining
all the clocks available to us (ap
proximately two) we decided that
none of them properly gelled with
the stylistic moldings of our com
mon space. So the clocks had to go.
Now. let's think about this fora
second. We vetoed putting up a
clock in our common room because
it would have taken away from the
rest of our artwork (and most no
tably our Ikea track lighting ... oh
how we love those Swedish product
designers). This is a shame. A royal
shame.
But as pathetic as we are, who are
our suitemates to put up with such lu
dicrousness? And who are our suite
mates to put up with such ludicrositv!
We are seniors in college, and for
whatever reason we are less con
cerned with the time of day than we
are with convincing people that we
are cool because one of our moms is
a professional modern artist and the
other one of us is capable of making
custom (albeit dangerous) wiring
jobs for retail lights.
We might as well move into sub
urbia and start work on our Christ
mas lights display just so we can be
the proud owners of the one house
on the block that really takes the
cake come Santa-Day.
Even sadder, though, is the fact
that what we're doing isn't really all
that different than Captain Christ
mas with his rooftop nativity. Grant
ed, our holiday season will last a full
school year, but after that the decora
tions are coming down. And when
you think about it. all those Christ
mas decorations make for little more
than a shining beacon of materialism.
Speaking of shining beacons of
materialism, have we mentioned our
common room? It's really pretty
amazing. We have track lighting
from Ikea. It all boils down to the
American way of things. It's a free
market, and competition is the name
of the game.
Whose common room would you
rather steal booze from? We have
imported mango rum that you didn't
pay for. Sigma Chi has Natural Light
that your tuition probably somehow
paid for ... the choice is all but clear.
Really though, it's sad how much
we love our common room. It may
be nice for us to sit around in a few
hours out of the day, but with all the
money we spent on lighting and the
fines that we'll inevitably pay to
housing for the shelf mountings im
planted in our walls, we probably
could have done something better.
Hey. what if we lined the walls
with those light-up candy canes?
