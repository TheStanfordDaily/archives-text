For many new students leaving home
for the first time, college is a departure
from home cooking, free laundry and
also family-oriented religion. Part of the
change lies in deciding how to practice
while they are away from the influence
of their parents. At Stanford, many find
that the newfound autonomy that comes
with college strengthens spirituality.
"College is a time of evolution," said
President of the Jewish Leadership
Council Carla Fenves, a junior. "Just like
you're finding your major [and] your
friends, you're finding your religion."
Alongside sports teams and commu
nity service projects in the University's
activity agenda exists a core of religious
groups that are quiet but thriving.
Stanford is home to religious groups
from Baha'i to Zoroastrianism. Accord
ing to Dean of Religious Life Scotty
McLennan, approximately half of Stan
ford students are affiliated to some de
gree with a religious institution.
While there is a core of religious groups at
Stanford, there are a number of individuals
who prefer to practice privately.
Aarti Rao. educator for the Hindu
Students Council, said, "If you want to
play soccer you can't just go out and kick
a soccer ball around yourself," as op
posed to religion which is perfectly plau
sible as an individual activity.
For those who would rather join a re
ligious community, Stanford Associated
Religions, an organization currently
comprised of thirty registered faiths,
aims to unite religious groups. Accord
ing to McLennan, the purpose of this or
ganization is to "ensure that members
represent [their respective] groupfs] and
purposes forthrightly while at the same

time respecting the religious traditions
of other groups."
Only about halt a dozen religious groups
on campus are unaffiliated with SAR.
A common goal of many student-run
religious groups is to invite members of the
Stanford community to learn about new
practices and beliefs. This leads to outreach
projects, interfaith retreats and dialogues,
concerts and intra-program discussions.
In fact, earlier this year, it led to the
creation of a new group altogether.
Mosaic, a multi-denominational
Christian organization, is an amalgam of
four formerly separate groups. One aim
of this union was to create a large forum
for Christian communication and worship
on campus and to spark discussion among
its members. This kind of cooperation al
lows students to practice their beliefs in a
more socially connected atmosphere.
This growing aspiration has led to ex
tensive interaction among different reli
gious communities. For example, Hillel,
a Jewish organization, sponsors Middle
East issues discussions to bring Jewish
and Muslim students together; they also
lead an interfaith retreat.
"I've gotten even more of a diverse
sense about other people and their reli
gions," Fenves said.
This sentiment is common. Members
of religious groups note that the open
ness of exchange among groups serves to
combat social barriers.
Priyanka Bakava. president of the
Hindu Students Council, remarked on
the ease with which international stu
dents get along.
"There's no barrier between people
from India and Pakistan," she pointed out.
McLennan echoed Bakaya's sentiment.
"Pluralism is really the name of the
game in the Bay Area," he said
