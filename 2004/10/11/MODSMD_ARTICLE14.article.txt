## Editorial Suit will aid campaign reform efforts 
### 
Dylan Mefford is at it again — still. With the
start of the new school year, Mefford has
now stated that he plans to proceed with
the third elections-related Constitutional
Council case that he originally filed last May. While
the suit might reopen wounds from the spring, it is a
legitimate approach to take in trying to bring about
serious change within student government.
As campus political history has demonstrated
through episodes such as the special-fees debacle ear
lier this year, the ASSU is generally reluctant to
adopt meaningful reform unless its back is against the
wall. But Mefford's action could provide enough
pressure to ensure that the ASSU remedies its ques
tionable and problematic Campaign Practice Proto
col rules.
As an ASSU vice-presidential hopeful, Mefford
ran with presidential candidate Mikey Lee in an ini
tial student-body election in April. They emerged as
the victors, but the ASSU Senate soon overturned the
first election on the grounds that the Lee/ Mefford
ticket violated a campaign rule regarding e-mails.
After a successful Constitutional Council suit by
Mefford, which argued that the campaign rule re
garding e-mails violated the candidates' free speech
rights as afforded in the ASSU Constitution, the Sen
ate then rejected the first election based on an alleged
"abuse of power" by Lee, in that he was a Senior
Class president and he received an e-mailed endorse
ment from his fellow co-class presidents.
Lee filed a second case contesting this decision,
which was thrown out by the Council on the grounds
that it did not properly address the Senate's reason
ing for its judgment. Meanwhile, Chioke Borgelt-
Mose and Kory Vargas Caro were elected as the new
ASSU executives in a special second election.
In the third case that now stands before the Coun
cil. Mefford is maintaining that the Senate violated
free speech lights by declaring the endorsement e
mail sent out by Lee's fellow co-class presidents to be
an "abuse of power."
The Daily's editorial board has previously made
the argument that no evidence was presented to allow
Lee's actions to be termed as such an "abuse." And,
since there are no campaign regulations regarding
"abuse of power," it is not clear what proving such a
charge would accomplish. Third, even if this sort of
regulation did exist, we agree with Mefford that it
would be unconstitutional since it would inevitably in
fringe ori the ASSU Constitution's free speech rights.
Despite all of this, upon Mefford's filing of the
third suit in late May, we declared at the time that
they should "abandon their quest and show some
grace in defeat." This was because we believed the
pursuit of the case, given the circumstances, would
have done more harm than good. The student body
needed to move on. and it was not healthy or produc
tive to continue to prolong the electoral uncertainty,
regardless of the unfair outcome.
While we then opposed Mefford's pursuit of the
suit, our view on the matter has now changed for two
reasons. First, sufficient time has passed so as to allow
ASSU officials to make plans for the upcoming year
and for past tensions to cool. Indeed, over four
months has passed since Mefford first filed his suit, but
the Council is still waiting to hear the case because it
needs three more members to be able to reach quo-

rum and function as a judicial body.
Second, and more importantly, since Borgelt-
Mose and Vargas have actually taken office and Mef
ford has said he has no intention of displacing them,
there is no longer any risk of further electoral up
heaval. When the case was first filed last spring, a re
traction of Borgelt-Mose / Vargas' victory or even
another special election loomed as potential conse
quences of the suit —cures that would have been
worse than the ailment.
But with the above complications now absent from
the picture, a victory by Mefford would be largely sym
bolic. m that it would underscore the urgent need for
campaign regulation reform by the ASSU. Mefford
has stated that he is only pursuing the case to make this
point, and we completely agree with his reasoning. We
specifically have suggested in the past that campaigns
should have as few restrictions as possible. Instead of
creating largely unenforceable rules that reward those
who break them while punishing those who follow
them, the ASSU should adopt regulations that are con
sistent with its Constitution and which promote a level
playing field for the candidates.
In other words, let the candidates exhaust the
means at their disposal to discuss their proposals with
the student body. And if it is that students might
worry, for example, about being deluged by an excess
of e-mails, candidates will have an incentive not to
send too many for fear of alienating voters. The bot
tom line is that no outside body will ever be able to
fully regulate the actions of candidates, thus allowing
some to get ahead by not following the rules. More im
portantly, we see no compelling reasons to implement
such regulations in the first place, so why create the
opportunity for some to gain an unfair advantage?
Therefore, we are pleased Mefford is opting to
pursue his case. Little progress has been made on
campaign regulation issues despite the fact that half a
year has passed since the initial spring election. This
is worrying, even though it is still early in the new Sen
ate's term.
As evidenced by past similar scenarios, the ASSU
generally waits until pressure mounts before it acts,
and we think Mefford's suit could do just the trick and
trigger reform, as the case is no longer about trying to
put l.ee / Mefford in office. It is about trying to en
sure that real change occurs within the ASSU. We
could not agree more with this goal.
However, as addressed above, at least three indi
viduals need to be added to the Constitutional Coun
cil before the suit can be heard. This should take place
as soon as possible.
To this end. we are impressed by Borgelt-Mose's
proposal to create an independent commission to
make the appointments, which we feel is not merely
appropriate but also absolutely necessary, given that
there would otherwise be a conflict of interest since
she is technically a party affected by Mefford's suit.
It may take a while for the drama of this spring's
ASSU elections to fully come to a close. But as long
as important unresolved issues such as campaign re
form remain on the table, students should not allow
the controversy to be forgotten. After all. history
tends to repeat itself. While students might disagree
on the specifics of what occurred this spring, we hope
they all would agree that measures should be taken so
as to never allow it to happen again.
