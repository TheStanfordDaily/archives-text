## Elect a leader who treats gays with respect 
### WAYNE TING 
Monday, Oct. 11. is National Com
ing Out Day. Granted, it may not be
New Year's Bve, St. Patrick's Day or
even Homecoming, but for many of
your peers, it's much more important.
Beyond the public expression of
sexual orientation, National Com
ing Out Day is also a time for all gay
lesbian bi sexual and transgender
people and our allies to reflect upon
the struggles and oppressions, social
and self-imposed, that gay and les
bian Americans continue to face in

this country every single day.
In addition, it is a time to reaffirm
that we, as a community, support an
environment where every person lives
free from fear and discrimination.
For those you who are not mem
bers of the GLBT community. Na
tional Coming Out Day may not be
a noteworthy time.
But it should be significant, be
cause more likely than not, you are
friends with, took a class alongside,
or have someone in your family who
is gay or lesbian (though you may
not know it). And for these people,

coming out of the closet remains a
long, difficult and emotional pro
cess; I speak from experience.
We face fear, discrimination, ha
rassment, rejection and even vio
lence by revealing our sexual orien
tation. And this is why we need your
support.
The easiest way you can support
your gay and lesbian friends is by cre
ating an accepting environment, not
just on your campus, but in the nation
as well. This means choosing a leader
who respects and supports gay and
lesbian Americans in their struggles.
President George W. Bush has
used the lives of gay and lesbian
Americans as a political tool. He has
pandered to homophobia and bigotry
for political purposes, and has at
tempted to enshrine in the constitu
tion permanent second-class citizen
status for GLBT Americans.
In George W. Bush's country.
GLBT people are a threat to the
fabric of America.
On the other hand, John Kerry op
poses the Federal Marriage Amend
ment. He was one of only 14 Senators
to vote against the "Defense of Mar
riage Act" in 1996. And he passion
ately opposed the discriminating
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy.
Additionally, Kerry supports the
passage of comprehensive hate
crimes legislation and the Employ
ment Non-Discrimination Act. so

Kerry supports gays

GLBT people can work in environ
ments free of discrimination.
Kerry has a long record of support
ing gays and lesbians, and he under
stands that the real threats to America
are not the expressions of sexual ori
entation, but prejudice and fear.
Oct. 11 is an important day for
GLBT people across this country,
but the truth is, we are more con
cerned with the quality of our lives
for the next four years. When you
go into the voting booth or mark
your absentee ballot on Nov. 2,
think of how far gays and lesbians
have come as a community, and
how far we still must go.
And vote fora president who will
respect our dignity and our rights.
