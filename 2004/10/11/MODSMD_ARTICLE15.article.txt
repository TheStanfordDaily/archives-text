## Elect a leader who treats gays with respect

Monday, Oct. 11. is National Com
ing Out Day. Granted, it may not be
New Year's Bve, St. Patrick's Day or
even Homecoming, but for many of
your peers, it's much more important.

sexual orientation, National Com
ing Out Day is also a time for all gay
lesbian bi sexual and transgender
people and our allies to reflect upon
the struggles and oppressions, social
and self-imposed, that gay and les
bian Americans continue to face in

this country every single day.
In addition, it is a time to reaffirm
that we, as a community, support an
environment where every person lives
free from fear and discrimination.
For those you who are not mem
bers of the GLBT community. Na
tional Coming Out Day may not be
a noteworthy time.
But it should be significant, be
cause more likely than not, you are
friends with, took a class alongside,
or have someone in your family who
is gay or lesbian (though you may
not know it). And for these people,

coming out of the closet remains a
long, difficult and emotional pro
cess; I speak from experience.
We face fear, discrimination, ha
rassment, rejection and even vio
lence by revealing our sexual orien
tation. And this is why we need your
support.
The easiest way you can support
your gay and lesbian friends is by cre
ating an accepting environment, not
just on your campus, but in the nation
as well. This means choosing a leader
