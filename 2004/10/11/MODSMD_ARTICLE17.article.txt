## University free speech restrictions are illegal 
### 
Stanford is illegally restricting
my constitutional rights.
Yesterday, they prevented
me from engaging in a
peaceful assembly on campus to ex
ercise my freedom of speech. I
won't let them stop me again.
Last week, two friends of mine
invited students to get together for
an hour to make phone calls on be
half of John Kerry. That's a classic
First Amendment activity.
When the British government
banned Committees of Correspon
dence, constituted by the patriots to
write letters opposed to King
George, the men who eventually
framed the Constitution vowed
never to tolerate a government that
restricted peaceful assembly or free
expression. They wrote the First
Amendment to protect events like
the John Kerry Power Hour.
In its wisdom, the California leg
islature passed the Leonard Law,
section 94367 of the California Ed
ucational Code, to protect the First
Amendment rights of California's
students. The law protects on-cam
pus activities that would be protect
ed from governmental restriction
by the First Amendment if per
formed off-campus.
Cut to the present. Stanford's ad
ministration decided that the pro
posed John Kerry Power Hour con
stituted an event, and that I Iniversity
policy prohibits partisan political
events on campus.
This was a good-faith interpreta
tion of a good-faith policy, intended to
protect Stanford's not-for-profit sta
tus. As a 501 (c) 3 nonprofit, Stanford
University cannot use its facilities or
other resources in a way that advan
tages one candidate over another.
Because of recent apparent viola
tions of this policy, administators
were intent on full enforcement. The
administration decided that, rather
than allow equal access to White
Plaza for supporters of any candi
date. the University would prohibit
this sort of event altogether.
In light of the Leonard Law.
though, this interpretation seems il
legal. Students' right to gather in
public areas off-campus to advocate
for John Kerry is constitutionally
protected, and the Leonard Law ex-

The Power Hour was scheduled
for White Plaza, Stanford's desig
nated open-to-the-public free

speech zone.
The students
were told that
they could not
assemble in any
location on cam
pus, and would
face the Judicial
Panel if they
continued. Ac
cordingly, they
decided to have

the "John Kerry Power Hour" off
campus in a private residence.
It seems the only legal, nonparti
san University policy would be to
allow students of any opinion to
peacefully assemble and exercise
their free speech rights anywhere
on campus where students are al
lowed to gather.
The Leonard Law allows students
to obtain court injunctions against il
legal university policies. I checked
with a handful of lawyers, and with
folks from the Democratic Party, the
ACLU and People for the American
Way, and they seemed to think that
the case would be a slam dunk on our
end if it came to that.
1 hope it won't come to that, be
cause the administration's decision
to push the event off campus wasn't
just illegal, it's also a bad policy.
Young people are increasingly
alienated from the political process.
If Stanford students are passionate
about politics and eager to get in
volved. the University should put as
few restrictions as possible in the
way of their idealism.
This coming Sunday at 1 p.m., I
intend to peacefully assemble in
White Plaza to express my opinion.
As an individual I'll be advocating
for John Kerry, but I hope students
for Bush join me, because free
speech is bigger than any political
party. 1 hope the University also un
derstands that, and lifts the restric
tions before then.
