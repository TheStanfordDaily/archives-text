Stanford labor practices
egregioiusly violated federal laws
Last Friday's article detailing
Stanford's effort to undermine Sub
way workers' free speech and labor
rights is yet another blunt reminder
of Stanford's horrendous labor
practices ("Stanford's labor prac
tices urgently need reform." Oct. 8).
Subway workers wearing buttons
saying "Subway workers demand
their right to choose their schedules
by seniority" were threatened by
their supervisors and then told to
take off the buttons in accordance
with Stanford Dining policy.
The workers' union contract in
cludes the right to choose schedules

by seniority, thus the workers had
every reason to be upset when the
supervisors disregarded the seniori
ty-bid process.
But more importantly, what Stan
ford did was illegal. Prohibiting
workers from wearing union buttons
/stickers is against the National
Labor Relations Act of 1935. Stan
ford is a premier educational institu
tion that should, at the very least, fol
low the laws of our country.
Regardless of your position on
workers' rights, this cannot be toler
ated. and students and faculty alike
must demand that Stanford admin
istrators correct the blatant disre
gard of federal laws.
On Oct. 20 at 7 p.m. in Tresidder,

Stanford will be having a 'town hall'
meeting discussing the recommen
dations made by the Presidential
Advisory Committee on Labor and
Workplace Policies. The committee
was created two years ago after a
seven-day student fast fora Code of
Conduct for labor practices.
The Stanford community should
be present at this town hall meeting
and discuss the current illegal prac
tices that Stanford is committing. The
University needs to do more than
simply reassure the students and fac
ulty of its positive labor practices.
It needs to rectify the illegal posi
tion on Subway workers and adopt a
Code of Conduct that will prohibit
such utter disregard of federal laws

and workers' rights.

Itush is unfit to lead the country
Robert Greer Cohn likens
George Bush to "a quietly strong
type in the mode of the sheriff of
High Noon" ("U.S. needs a cowboy
for president," Oct. 9), but cowboy
boots and an exaggerated drawl do
not make someone a courageous
lawman. In reality. Bush is a man
who carefully avoided combat him
self but is willing to send other men
and women to fight in an unneces
sary war against a country that had

no connection lo Al-Qaeda terror
ists, possessed no weapons of mass
destruction and posed no conceiv
able threat to America.
Bush so mismanaged the econo
my that he turned a $300 billion
budget surplus into a $445 billion
deficit and is the first president since
Herbert Hoover to run for reelec
tion with fewer Americans em
ployed than when he took office.
While being what Colin calls
"quietly strong," Bush canceled
U.S contributions the U.N. Popula
tion Fund, which provides repro
ductive health care to the world's
poorest, most vulnerable women;
underfunded his own Leave No
Child Behind act by $27 billion and

cut funds for such programs as job
training, housing vouchers for the
poor, and Pell grants for college stu
dents.
Finally. Bush has no respect for
the law. His Justice Department
jailed hundreds of innocent immi
grants without due process, his sec
retary of defense authorized the use
of torture, his White House counsel
advised him on how to sidestep the
Geneva Conventions and until the
Supreme Court countermanded
him. Bush claimed the right to jail
suspects indefinitely without trial or
access to a lawyer.
