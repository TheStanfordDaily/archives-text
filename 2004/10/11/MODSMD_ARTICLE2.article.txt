# Locals react to minimum wage veto

### COURTNEY PENN CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITERS 
WASHINGTON. D.C. — On Sept. 18 Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a bill that would
have raised the California minimum wage from
$6.75 to $7.75 per hour by July 2006.
Schwarzenegger contended that the bill, if ap
proved. would have encouraged businesses to re
locate to other states and would ultimately hurt
the state economy.
"In recent years, the high cost of doing busi
ness in California has driven away jobs, business
es and opportunity," the governor said in an offi
cial statement justifying the veto. "We have
launched California's recovery by making our
state a more attractive place to do business, so
that employers will stay in our state, expand in our
state and create more jobs here."
Lieber, who drafted the bill, said that raising
the minimum wage is vital to many Californians
who are currently struggling to make ends meet
despite full-time employment.
"Although working full-time, many of these
workers aren't going to be paid enough to stay
alive." Lieber said in an interview.
According to Lieber. the bill would have
helped some Stanford workers who work in the
dining halls and in maintenance. She explained
that many campus workers have to make sacri
fices to put food on the table.
"Many minimum-wage workers in Santa Clara
county have to commute long distances just to get
to work or live in Santa Clara valley," Lieber said.
She went on to describe one minimum-wage
worker who worked two jobs around the clock and
still had to live in a homeless shelter with his fami
ly due to high housing prices in the area.
The current minimum wage is 88 cents below
the federal poverty level for the state of Califor
nia. The poverty line at the federal level is deter
mined by the cost of subsistence fora three-per
son family.

"Minimum-wage workers are predominantly
heads of households, women workers and work
ers of color," Lieber said.
She added that from a "moral standpoint" this
makes it difficult for people, primarily minorities,
to provide for their families. Thus, she argues that
the minimum-wage issue is not only an economic
but also a racial problem.
A spokesperson for the Schwarzenegger cam
paign declined to comment on the issue besides
referring reporters to a press release.
Sophomore Jen Haskell, who worked for the
campaign of Democratic assembly candidate Ira
Rusk in of Palo Alto, disagreed with
Schwarzenegger's decision.
"Mr. Ruskin believes that the current mini
mum wage is much too low fora state with such a
high cost of living," Haskell said. "California's
minimum wage is lower than both Oregon's and
Washington's despite a higher cost of living here."
Because the economy is a major issue in the
upcoming local elections, there is question
whether or not Ruskin's opposition to the veto
will help or hurt his candidacy in a tight race
against pro-business Republican candidate Steve
Poizner. The sizeable California deficit makes it
imperative that state businesses thrive.
"While I have talked to voters who believe
Ruskin is too liberal on business issues, I think the
issue will help more than hurt his candidacy."
Haskell said. "1 think most people in the Palo Alto
area realize how high the cost of living is here and
how this low minimum wage hurts workers."
The disadvantages of a higher minimum wage
could, however, hurt more workers who currently
receive it in the long term.
"The negative effects of a higher minimum
wage would be more incentive for people to ille
gally hire those who are willing to work for less,
which would actually make the issue of equity
worse, not better." Haskell said.
She added that it would be ideal for the Cali
fornia government to provide a wage subsidy for
the workers to make up for the discrepancy be

iween the state's minimum wage and the federal
poverty level.
Senior Percy Link, a member of the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition, said the organization is
currently gathering information about the bill in
order to respond and determine how the veto will
impact Stanford workers.
In the meantime, Lieber said that a modified
version of the bill may very well find its way back
to the governor's desk.
"We have to regroup and look at whether or
not it makes sense to come back next year with an
other," she said.

Washington's despite a higher cost of living here."
Because the economy is a major issue in the
upcoming local elections, there is question
whether or not Ruskin's opposition to the veto
will help or hurt his candidacy in a tight race
against pro-business Republican candidate Steve
Poizner. The sizeable California deficit makes it
imperative that state businesses thrive.
"While I have talked to voters who believe
Ruskin is too liberal on business issues, I think the
issue will help more than hurt his candidacy."
Haskell said. "1 think most people in the Palo Alto
area realize how high the cost of living is here and
how this low minimum wage hurts workers."
The disadvantages of a higher minimum wage
could, however, hurt more workers who currently
receive it in the long term.
"The negative effects of a higher minimum
wage would be more incentive for people to ille
gally hire those who are willing to work for less,
which would actually make the issue of equity
worse, not better." Haskell said.
She added that it would be ideal for the Cali
fornia government to provide a wage subsidy for
the workers to make up for the discrepancy be

iween the state's minimum wage and the federal
poverty level.
Senior Percy Link, a member of the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition, said the organization is
currently gathering information about the bill in
order to respond and determine how the veto will
impact Stanford workers.
In the meantime, Lieber said that a modified
version of the bill may very well find its way back
to the governor's desk.
"We have to regroup and look at whether or
not it makes sense to come back next year with an
other," she said.
