## Fade Into Bolivian The 						Kobe-Shaq battle-rap feud: It's FAN-tastic 
### 
Let's look at some classic sports clashes
over the past two decades. There's
Ditka vs. a hurricane, Barkley vs.
Godzilla. Albert Belle vs. those pesky trick-or
treaters — whom he decided to chase down in
his car — and Jose Canseco vs. his wife.
Arguably, in each of these clashes (or
rather, spats of violence), clear winners and
losers emerged. For example, Barkley slams
on a clearly overmatched and possibly sake
loving Godzilla, and Belle successfully hits
one of the costumed kids with his car.
But recently, a new battle, one in which
there is not yet a winner, has emerged: Shaq-
Fu vs. Kobe "Bean is actually my real middle
name" Bryant.
Back in the golden days of the NBA (basi
cally during the 80s, or any

year before 1994. when the
Warriors last made the play
offs), rivalries were settled
on the court. In fact, the ri
valries that existed were ac
tually between players on
opposing teams —Bird vs.
Johnson, Jordan vs. Bird,
Celtics vs. Lakers. Unequiv
ocally, rivalries existed
amongst members of the

same team, but perhaps these rivalries were
settled by peacefully indulging in shared co
caine binges, instead of whining about team
mates through the media.
The Shaq and Kobe rivalry has escalated to
the point that Shaq has publicly dissed Kobe
in a song tilled "You Not The Fightin' Type."
Showing that his entertainment career is not a
fluke (who doesn't love the song "Shoot, Pass.
Slam"?), Shaq has established himself as a
veritable force in the hip-hop community, and
now has a burgeoning rap career.
Check out his lyrical skills: "Even with
wings you never as fly as me ... you remind
me of Kobe Bryant trying to be as high as me
... but you can't... even if you get me traded
... wherever I'm at, I'm Puffy; you Mase and
you're still hated."
Even if this lyrical attack was not lobbied
directly against Bryant, it still explicitly men
tions Bryant by name, and clearly places him
on a lower pedestal in the NBA hierarchy.
Advantage, Shaq.
While Shaq gains an advantage in lyrical
superiority, Bryant, fresh off his time in an
Eagle County courtroom, cracked back at
Shaq and alleged that O'Neal shelled out $1
million in hush money to sex partners. As
suming that this statement holds any validity
(which is a huge assumption based on me
knowing absolutely nothing about Shaq's per
sonal life), Shaq has still paid significantly less
money to sleep with significantly more
women. Notice how Kobe mentions partners,
as a plural, which clearly denotes more than
one partner? Advantage, Shaq.
Conversely, Kobe has, to steal the words of
Erik B. and Rakim. Paid in Full, for having
consensual sex (with one woman) in a hotel
room in Colorado, while being a married man.
Nutella, a delicious hazelnut-based chocolate
spread, popular throughout Europe, took
Kobe's image off the jar. There was a $4 mil
lion ring for his wife Vanessa Bryant. Court
expenses mount. Finally, feigned crying at
news conferences. The list might continue ad
infinitum.
Essentially, while Shaq may have had to
put up $1 million dollars in hush money (al
legedly), the total expenditure for Kobe's ad
ventures in marital infidelity comes out to $3


Neil Davis
billion (roughly). While he may speak Italian (and claim
intellectual superiority), he's making parmesan, while
Shaq makes the cheddar.
How these guys managed to coexist and succeed as
members of the Lakers, I have absolutely no idea. So far.
the only clear winner in this battle has been former
Laker coach Phil Jackson, who somehow managed to
keep the feud from blowing up to its current epic pro
portions While both Kobe and Shaq vied for control of
the team during Jackson's tenure. Phil's abilities as a Zen
master overcame these forces and allowed the team to
win three titles.
I can only imagine interactions like this: Shaq calls
Kobe selfish and admonishes him to pass the ball more.

Kobe's costs reach
about $3 billion

Kobe rebuts these charges, and declares Shaq not fit to
be a team leader, as he's obese. Enter Phil, who gives
Shaq a copy of Zen Mind. Beginner's Mind, and also
gives Kobe a copy of The Prince (in Italian, of course, to
appeal to his intellectual dominance). Feud settled fora
week, until the next explosion.
I guess there are various lessons to be learned from
the Shaq vs. Kobe feud. Unfortunately, I'm not entirely
sure what these lessons are; hold one: NBA action ...
it's LANtastic!
Amazingly, this column is now read in three continents,
[•.-mail neildQstanford.edu to tell Neil when his column

Let's look at some classic sports clashes
over the past two decades. There's
Ditka vs. a hurricane, Barkley vs.
Godzilla. Albert Belle vs. those pesky trick-or
treaters — whom he decided to chase down in
his car — and Jose Canseco vs. his wife.
Arguably, in each of these clashes (or
rather, spats of violence), clear winners and
losers emerged. For example, Barkley slams
on a clearly overmatched and possibly sake
loving Godzilla, and Belle successfully hits
one of the costumed kids with his car.
But recently, a new battle, one in which
there is not yet a winner, has emerged: Shaq-
Fu vs. Kobe "Bean is actually my real middle
name" Bryant.
Back in the golden days of the NBA (basi
cally during the 80s, or any

year before 1994. when the
Warriors last made the play
offs), rivalries were settled
on the court. In fact, the ri
valries that existed were ac
tually between players on
opposing teams —Bird vs.
Johnson, Jordan vs. Bird,
Celtics vs. Lakers. Unequiv
ocally, rivalries existed
amongst members of the

same team, but perhaps these rivalries were
settled by peacefully indulging in shared co
caine binges, instead of whining about team
mates through the media.
The Shaq and Kobe rivalry has escalated to
the point that Shaq has publicly dissed Kobe
in a song tilled "You Not The Fightin' Type."
Showing that his entertainment career is not a
fluke (who doesn't love the song "Shoot, Pass.
Slam"?), Shaq has established himself as a
veritable force in the hip-hop community, and
now has a burgeoning rap career.
Check out his lyrical skills: "Even with
wings you never as fly as me ... you remind
me of Kobe Bryant trying to be as high as me
... but you can't... even if you get me traded
... wherever I'm at, I'm Puffy; you Mase and
you're still hated."
Even if this lyrical attack was not lobbied
directly against Bryant, it still explicitly men
tions Bryant by name, and clearly places him
on a lower pedestal in the NBA hierarchy.
Advantage, Shaq.
While Shaq gains an advantage in lyrical
superiority, Bryant, fresh off his time in an
Eagle County courtroom, cracked back at
Shaq and alleged that O'Neal shelled out $1
million in hush money to sex partners. As
suming that this statement holds any validity
(which is a huge assumption based on me
knowing absolutely nothing about Shaq's per
sonal life), Shaq has still paid significantly less
money to sleep with significantly more
women. Notice how Kobe mentions partners,
as a plural, which clearly denotes more than
one partner? Advantage, Shaq.
Conversely, Kobe has, to steal the words of
Erik B. and Rakim. Paid in Full, for having
consensual sex (with one woman) in a hotel
room in Colorado, while being a married man.
