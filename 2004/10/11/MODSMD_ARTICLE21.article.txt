## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW 
The Stanford men's soccer team (6-1-4,1-0-2 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) continued recent trends in the
weekend road games: unconventional endings, intense
late-game drama and overtime.
Last-minute goals are becoming standard for the
Cardinal men. Friday afternoon against Oregon State
showcased another ending for the books.
With only 3:26 remaining on the clock and the game
deadlocked at 1-1, junior forward / midfielder Darren
Fernandez beat two Beaver defenders and scored his
second goal of the contest.
"I received a perfect ball between two defenders so
1 only had to take one touch and then get off a shot."
said Fernandez, whose clutch goal lifted the Cardinal
to a 2-1 conference road victory.
However, Stanford players are disappointed that
they let the Beavers stay so close and dominate the sec
ond half. Oregon State led Stanford in second-half
shots and corner kicks, 10-3 and 9-0 respectively.
"It wasn't our best game but we kept fighting and
! didn't give up," said Fernandez.
"It was a tale of two halves," said Cardinal head
coach Bret Simon. "We played well in first half. We
had good ball control, pressure and we created good
opportunities. However, in the second half we allowed
them to take it to us. Their goal really woke us up and
thankfully we had enough time to come back and

strike."
In the first half Fernandez opened the scoring when
he netted a far-post goal off a Dan Shapiro corner kick
27 minutes into the game.
Stanford led 1 -0 until the 75th minute, when Beaver
forward Chris Murphy scored from just outside the 18-
yard box off a broken corner kick.
Fernandez's second goal nailed the coffin shut on
Oregon State's chances fora win, ending the team's
undefeated record at Lorcnz Field this year (4-1-1) and
keeping the Beavers winless (0-2-0) against the Pac-10
so far.
Sunday brought its own drama as Stanford faced an
incredibly hot Washington (9-3-2. 2-0-1) team. Wash
ington entered the game coming off a 3-0 win against
previously undefeated California.
The Huskies challenged Stanford early, as Wash
ington went up 1-0 in the 25th minute. Musky C.J. Klass
shot from the outside of the penalty area and scored off
a deflection in front.
Still, Stanford would not be intimidated. The squad
stepped up its game to the challenge and finally capi
talized in the second half. In the 62nd minute. Fernan
dez shot the ball low and hard at the Washington keep
er. and as the ball squirted out to the six-yard box. se
nior midfielder Todd Leber was there to punch it in
and even the score at 1 -1.
