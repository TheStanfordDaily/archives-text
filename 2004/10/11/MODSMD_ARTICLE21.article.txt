## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW 
The Stanford men's soccer team (6-1-4,1-0-2 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) continued recent trends in the
weekend road games: unconventional endings, intense
late-game drama and overtime.
Last-minute goals are becoming standard for the
Cardinal men. Friday afternoon against Oregon State
showcased another ending for the books.
With only 3:26 remaining on the clock and the game
deadlocked at 1-1, junior forward / midfielder Darren
Fernandez beat two Beaver defenders and scored his
second goal of the contest.
"I received a perfect ball between two defenders so
1 only had to take one touch and then get off a shot."
said Fernandez, whose clutch goal lifted the Cardinal
to a 2-1 conference road victory.
However, Stanford players are disappointed that
they let the Beavers stay so close and dominate the sec
ond half. Oregon State led Stanford in second-half
shots and corner kicks, 10-3 and 9-0 respectively.
"It wasn't our best game but we kept fighting and
! didn't give up," said Fernandez.
"It was a tale of two halves," said Cardinal head
coach Bret Simon. "We played well in first half. We
had good ball control, pressure and we created good
opportunities. However, in the second half we allowed
them to take it to us. Their goal really woke us up and
thankfully we had enough time to come back and

strike."
In the first half Fernandez opened the scoring when
he netted a far-post goal off a Dan Shapiro corner kick
27 minutes into the game.
Stanford led 1 -0 until the 75th minute, when Beaver
forward Chris Murphy scored from just outside the 18-
yard box off a broken corner kick.
Fernandez's second goal nailed the coffin shut on
Oregon State's chances fora win, ending the team's
undefeated record at Lorcnz Field this year (4-1-1) and
keeping the Beavers winless (0-2-0) against the Pac-10
so far.
Sunday brought its own drama as Stanford faced an
incredibly hot Washington (9-3-2. 2-0-1) team. Wash
ington entered the game coming off a 3-0 win against
previously undefeated California.
The Huskies challenged Stanford early, as Wash
ington went up 1-0 in the 25th minute. Musky C.J. Klass
shot from the outside of the penalty area and scored off
a deflection in front.
Still, Stanford would not be intimidated. The squad
stepped up its game to the challenge and finally capi
talized in the second half. In the 62nd minute. Fernan
dez shot the ball low and hard at the Washington keep
er. and as the ball squirted out to the six-yard box. se
nior midfielder Todd Leber was there to punch it in
and even the score at 1 -1.
Men escape Seattle
with 2-2 overtime tie

The Cardinal would not wait long to strike
again, as they scored two minutes later. Junior
midfielder Cooper McKee collected the ball
at around midfield and ran up the pitch with
possession. McKee then rocketed the ball past
the Husky keeper's outstretched right hand,
putting the Cardinal up 2-1 for their first lead
of the game.
Washington would not go easily, however,
and evened the score with a goal from Ely
Allen in the 7yth minute. Allen scored off a
cross from his teammate Kevin Forrest.
The teams were then deadlocked for the
rest of regulation and into overtime. The
game ended in a hard-fought 2-2 tie with a
total of 35 fouls (22 for Washington, 13 for the
Cardinal).
Overall, the team was satisfied with its
play.
"We played well," Leber said. "The mid
field possession was better than in the past.
We created a lot of attacking opportunities
against their defense and kept the pressure
on."
Fernandez pointed out that the team had
improved from the Oregon State game.
"We played a bit better [than at Oregon
State). It was a scrappy game. The coaches
prepared us well and we knew what we were
up against."
However, the team is always looking for
ways to get better in order to accomplish its
goals.
"[At Washington] I think that we had only
one mental lapse late, which was late in the sec
ond half," said Simon. "It's been one of the

themes of our season so far; we play well and then lose focus briefly. 1 would say we had good concentration SO percent of
ihe game today and that's a definite improvement. We're getting closer to where we need to he if we're going to meet our
goals of winning the conference tournament and going far in the NC'AAs."
Stanford returns to Maloney Field this weekend for games against UC-Davis (4-6-1) on Friday at 5 p.m. and UCLA (5-5-
2, 1-1-0 Pac-10) on Sunday at noon.
