# Card can't hang on in South Bend

### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
SOUTH BEND. !nd. — As they have in every one of
their games this season, the Cardinal held a halftime lead
here Saturday.
For the second time in three weeks, though, they gave
that lead away, falling to Notre Dame, 23-15.
"Anytime you're going into halftime with the other
team's head between their legs, you've gotta beat them,"
defensive end Julian Jenkins said. "It's like having the
mouse in the trap and letting him out fora little bit and
he escapes."
The Fighting Irish (4-2) outscored the Cardinal (3-2)
in the second half. 20-9. despite outgaining Stanford by
just three yards. Stanford made little mistakes along the
way — a dropped pass here, a penally there — before
eventually being toppled thanks to a big mistake: a fum
bled punt that led to Notre Dame's go-ahead touchdown
with 12 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter.
Of course, a 6-3 halftime deficit isn't exactly an insur
mountable obstacle fora veteran team playing in front of
80,795 enthusiastic fans. But for Stanford, that was the
point — it didn't have to be just 6-3.
On its first drive, Stanford marched to the Irish 9-yard
line, but ended up settling fora 27-yard Michael Sgroi
field goal. On its next drive. Stanford drove 75 yards in
just 2:26, but couldn't push it in from first-and-goal on
the Irish 7-yard line, settling fora 20-yard field goal.
"The difference (in the game] may have been that we
didn't put the ball in the end zone in the first half." said
receiver Evan Moore. "Instead of 6-0 it could've been
14-0."
Moore, the first receiver for whom quarterback Trent
Edwards looks, caught five passes for 72 yards but
couldn't get open in the red zone against double cover
age. No other Cardinal receiver could, either, as the Car
dinal were held without a passing touchdown for the sec
ond straight week.
Still, a halftime lead is a halftime lead and Stanford
began the second half with a lot of confidence.
"We had the game in our hands," Edwards said, "and
we weren't able to put it away."
The Cardinal's chances to break things open didn't
end in the first half, either. Receiving the ball first, it took
just two pass completions totaling 58 yards to put Stan
ford in position fora big score. But three failed plays
later, the Cardinal settled for another field goal, this time
from 38 yards, and a 9-3 lead.
Notre Dame responded with a 13-play drive that cul
minated in a one-yard Ryan Grant touchdown run. It
took the Irish six plays to score from the 5-yard line on
first-and-goal. but they were aided by two Stanford face
mask penalties.
The Cardinal, resilient, finally reached the end zone
on their next drive, going 80 yards before J.R. Lemon —
who missed the second quarter with a twisted knee and
finished with just 41 yards on 13 carries — plunged in
with a 3-yard score fora 15-10 lead.
Less than three minutes later, though, with the third
quarter winding to a close. Jay Ottovegio dropped the
punt snap. He managed to pick it up after a couple
bounces and attempted to kick it, but as he dropped the
ball, he was tackled from the side and his leg missed the
ball. Stanford recovered that fumble, but did so eight
yards short of the first down.
"I just dropped it," Ottovegio said. "I was really just
trying to get rid of the ball."
For their part, the Irish didn't need long to get rid of
Stanford's lead. Seven rushing plays later, Grant beat
the entire Stanford defense to the outside edge fora
three-yard touchdown run and a 16-15 Irish lead.
One point, one tantalizing point. The difference be
tween a first-half touchdown and two first-half field
goals.
But it was enough for Notre Dame, as Stanford would
gain minus-16 yards on its next two possessions and run
a shotgun draw out of a three-wide-receiver set facing
fourth-and-one on its third possession. Lemon was
stopped behind the line by Irish tackle Greg Pauly and
the Irish regained possession.
"The numbers," Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens
said when asked about the unusual play call. "The box
matchup was pretty good. We thought that we'd stick it
up inside and we came up a couple inches short."
That lour-and-out for Stanford came on the heels of
Notre Dame's second touchdown of the afternoon. With
4:10 to play. Brady Quinn scored on a two-yard quarter
