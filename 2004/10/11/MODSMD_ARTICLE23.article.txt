# Stanford running game falters at ND
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Neither Stanford nor Notre
Dame put on much of a show Saturday at Notre Dame
Stadium, with most of the drama resulting from things
that didn't actually happen.
Like a first-half touchdown, a long scoring play, a
last-minute comeback ... or a Cardinal third-down con
version in the red zone.
In total. Stanford converted just three of its 14 third
downs, while Notre Dame was an impressive 10-of-19.
And Stanford was 0-for-2 on fourth downs, with one
being the fumbled punt that led to Notre Dame's clinch
ing score and the other ending a potential comeback
drive with four minutes remaining, while Notre Dame
was 1 -for-2, with its successful conversion being a touch
down that put them up. 10-9.
Quarterback Trent Edwards said there was no one
cause for the clutch-time disparity.
"It's a combination of things." he said. "Certain
blit/.es we didn't pick up. a couple missed passes and a
couple dropped balls."
Wide receiver Evan Moore pointed out that the Car
dinal's lack of success in the running game — the team
totaled just 67 yards rushing on 25 carries — hurt its

third-down play, which involves a lot of three-, four-and
five-wide-receiver sets that require Edwards and a re
ceiver to hook up on short completions.
"We struggled a little bit establishing the run,"
Moore said. "We |need to] establish the run and make
them man up. because when they manned up. Mark
| Bradford] and 1 made plays."
Edwards couldn't agree more.
"It's very difficult to not have a running game and not
ever have their secondary bite on the play action," he
said.
The Fighting Irish doubled Moore every time when
Stanford approached the end zone, and their safeties
were quick to break up those passes that tried to find
their way to other receivers.
For the day, Edwards was just l-for-6 for 12 yards in
the red zone. The closest he got to a scoring pass was a
laser right to the hands of Justin McCullum in the first
quarter. But McCullum was hit immediately by Chine
dum Ndukwe and never really had a chance to control
the ball, which fell incomplete to the end-zone turf.
Head coach Buddy Teevens had no easy solutions,
since the Cardinal have been effective in the red zone all
year, Saturday excepted.

Justin McCullum and the Cardinal put up 334 yards on the Notre Dame defense, but it wasn't enough Saturday.
"It's just a matter of. [in J critical situations, you
have to make some plays," he said.
The defense faced its shared of critical situa
tions, most of them in the second half, and it
couldn't come up with a breakthrough play. The
Irish passing game was ineffective—Brady
Quinn was just 1 l-of-24 for 177 yards — but those
incompletions all sailed harmlessly out of bounds
or into the ground or, a couple times, off the hands
of Stanford defenders.
"Everybody had their chance to make plays,"
cornerback T.J. Rushing said. "It's very disap
pointing."
Quinn was sacked only one time and had plen
ty of time to throw on most of his attempts, which
made things difficult on the secondary.
Still, there were a few big plays that were al
most made.
Stanley Wilson had an interception stripped
away by the receiver in the fourth quarter, but was
beaten deep a few plays later for the final Notre
Dame touchdown.

a deep pass in the third quarter, but later in that
drive. Maurice Stovall got behind the secondarv

fora 43-yard gain, setting up the first Irish touch
down.
"In the secondary, we always have to make
plays," Wilson said. "We need to get the ball back
to our offense, and we didn't do it."
The offense only put up 15 points, and Notre
Dame didn't set foot in the red zone until the third
quarter. Notre Dame possessed the ball for 12
minutes and 40 seconds more than Stanford did,
and thanks to favorable field position, the Irish
had second-half touchdown drives of just 27 and
47 yards, respectively.
Still, it wasn't enough, and several Cardinal de
fenders expressed disappointment with their effort.
"We always put it on the defense," defensive
end Julian Jenkins said. "Twenty-three points was
too many."
It was a disappointing afternoon on both sides
of the ball for the Cardinal, but it wasn't a blowout
like last year's 57-7 debacle, and there were clear
problem areas which the team can attempt to ad
dress this week in practice.
"1 feel like [the loss] was an aberration," Jenk
ins said. "That was just a glitch in the system of our
good season."

The defense faced its shared of critical situa

couldn't come up with a breakthrough play. The
Irish passing game was ineffective—Brady
Quinn was just 1 l-of-24 for 177 yards — but those
incompletions all sailed harmlessly out of bounds

of Stanford defenders.

Quinn was sacked only one time and had plen

made things difficult on the secondary.
Still, there were a few big plays that were al
most made.
Stanley Wilson had an interception stripped

"In the secondary, we always have to make
plays," Wilson said. "We need to get the ball back
to our offense, and we didn't do it."
The offense only put up 15 points, and Notre
Dame didn't set foot in the red zone until the third
quarter. Notre Dame possessed the ball for 12
minutes and 40 seconds more than Stanford did,
and thanks to favorable field position, the Irish
had second-half touchdown drives of just 27 and
47 yards, respectively.

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Neither Stanford nor Notre
Dame put on much of a show Saturday at Notre Dame
Stadium, with most of the drama resulting from things
that didn't actually happen.
Like a first-half touchdown, a long scoring play, a
last-minute comeback ... or a Cardinal third-down con
version in the red zone.
In total. Stanford converted just three of its 14 third
downs, while Notre Dame was an impressive 10-of-19.
And Stanford was 0-for-2 on fourth downs, with one
being the fumbled punt that led to Notre Dame's clinch
ing score and the other ending a potential comeback
drive with four minutes remaining, while Notre Dame
was 1 -for-2, with its successful conversion being a touch
down that put them up. 10-9.
Quarterback Trent Edwards said there was no one
cause for the clutch-time disparity.
"It's a combination of things." he said. "Certain
blit/.es we didn't pick up. a couple missed passes and a
couple dropped balls."
Wide receiver Evan Moore pointed out that the Car
dinal's lack of success in the running game — the team
totaled just 67 yards rushing on 25 carries — hurt its

third-down play, which involves a lot of three-, four-and
five-wide-receiver sets that require Edwards and a re
ceiver to hook up on short completions.
"We struggled a little bit establishing the run,"
Moore said. "We |need to] establish the run and make
them man up. because when they manned up. Mark
| Bradford] and 1 made plays."
Edwards couldn't agree more.
"It's very difficult to not have a running game and not
ever have their secondary bite on the play action," he
said.
The Fighting Irish doubled Moore every time when
Stanford approached the end zone, and their safeties
were quick to break up those passes that tried to find
their way to other receivers.
For the day, Edwards was just l-for-6 for 12 yards in
the red zone. The closest he got to a scoring pass was a
laser right to the hands of Justin McCullum in the first
quarter. But McCullum was hit immediately by Chine
dum Ndukwe and never really had a chance to control
the ball, which fell incomplete to the end-zone turf.
Head coach Buddy Teevens had no easy solutions,
since the Cardinal have been effective in the red zone all
year, Saturday excepted.
