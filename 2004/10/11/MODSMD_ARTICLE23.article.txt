# Stanford running game falters at ND
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Neither Stanford nor Notre
Dame put on much of a show Saturday at Notre Dame
Stadium, with most of the drama resulting from things
that didn't actually happen.
Like a first-half touchdown, a long scoring play, a
last-minute comeback ... or a Cardinal third-down con
version in the red zone.
In total. Stanford converted just three of its 14 third
downs, while Notre Dame was an impressive 10-of-19.
And Stanford was 0-for-2 on fourth downs, with one
being the fumbled punt that led to Notre Dame's clinch
ing score and the other ending a potential comeback
drive with four minutes remaining, while Notre Dame
was 1 -for-2, with its successful conversion being a touch
down that put them up. 10-9.
Quarterback Trent Edwards said there was no one
cause for the clutch-time disparity.
"It's a combination of things." he said. "Certain
blit/.es we didn't pick up. a couple missed passes and a
couple dropped balls."
Wide receiver Evan Moore pointed out that the Car
dinal's lack of success in the running game — the team
totaled just 67 yards rushing on 25 carries — hurt its

third-down play, which involves a lot of three-, four-and
five-wide-receiver sets that require Edwards and a re
ceiver to hook up on short completions.
"We struggled a little bit establishing the run,"
Moore said. "We |need to] establish the run and make
them man up. because when they manned up. Mark
| Bradford] and 1 made plays."
Edwards couldn't agree more.
"It's very difficult to not have a running game and not
ever have their secondary bite on the play action," he
said.
The Fighting Irish doubled Moore every time when
Stanford approached the end zone, and their safeties
were quick to break up those passes that tried to find
their way to other receivers.
For the day, Edwards was just l-for-6 for 12 yards in
the red zone. The closest he got to a scoring pass was a
laser right to the hands of Justin McCullum in the first
quarter. But McCullum was hit immediately by Chine
dum Ndukwe and never really had a chance to control
the ball, which fell incomplete to the end-zone turf.
Head coach Buddy Teevens had no easy solutions,
since the Cardinal have been effective in the red zone all
year, Saturday excepted.

Justin McCullum and the Cardinal put up 334 yards on the Notre Dame defense, but it wasn't enough Saturday.
