To quote Tim Robbinsin Durham, "You've gotta play
them one game at a time. Sometimes you win. sometimes you
lose, and sometimes, it rains."
Well, it didn't rain this weekend, but the Stanford Cardinal
women's volleyball team (11-4. 4-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
was able to come back from a road trip to Los Angeles with a
split against No. 2 Southern California and No. 10 UCLA, los
ing to USC on Friday night 3-1 and coming back Saturday
night to down UCLA by the same score. The California Gold
en Bears also played in L.A. this weekend, and were also able
to earn a split, losing to UCLA and upsetting USC.
"The Pac-10 is a jumbled mess." said Stanford head coach
John Dunning. "We find ourselves in second place. Washing
ton is in the driver's seat. ( al's getting back into the race, even
though they lost three in a row. It's just like the rest of the
country.
"If you wanted to lose money right now. get in a pool right
now that's trying to pick the Final Four this year. There's just
no predicting it right now. On any given weekend, anyone can
beat anyone."
Stanford opened the weekend Friday night against USC at
the Lyons Center. To put it bluntly, the Cardinal seemed
scared and flat. In games one and two, the Cardinal played as

games, leading to problems with setting and easy kills for
the Women of Troy.
During the break between games two and three, the
Cardinal were able to collect themselves and smash
USC right in the mouth, takinij game three by a score of
30-27.
No longer showing signs of intimidation, Stanford
improved its passing and take the game on an attack
error by senior outside hitter Keao Burdine, as her at
tempt was stuffed by freshman middle blocker Franci
Girard.
In Game 4, the Cardinal and Ladies of Troy played
back and forth competitively for the majority of the
game. Tied at 22, however, things began to slip for Stan
ford. as USC put together a four-point run. picking up
two points on hitting errors by senior Jenn Hucke. From
there, USC and Stanford swapped points, and time just

four players in double digits for USC.
Despite the loss, the Cardinal felt positive about the
way they played. After going down 2-0, Stanford
bounced back to take Game 3 and competed strongly in
game four before things slipped away.
"For whatever reason, maybe youth, maybe situa
tion, we were very nervous to start the SC match," Dun
ning said. "There's no magic. Our players have a lot of
pride, and they were mad they performed that way.
After the timeout, we played a lot smarter and a lot more
aggressively. We made USC commit errors and we're
very happy with the way that we played in the last two
games."
Building off their confidence from the end of their
match with USC, Stanford walked into Pauley Pavilion

the door, running out to a 30-24 win and ending on a ball
handling error by junior setter Katie Goldhahn.
Following the break, Stanford retook control of the
match as game three went to the Cardinal, 30-25. The
teams played closely through the first half of the game,
with the Cardinal holding a slight edge at 15-14 going

strength of a seven-point run. The Cardinal then just
outplayed their opponents, as the team was able to down
the Bruins and take the game on a Nnamani kill, 30-28,
and the match. 3-1.
"1 think we came out and played tough right from the
start against UCLA," Dunning said. "We played the
best defense of the year by far in games three and four.
Kristin [Richards] played amazing defense. Everyone
played much more solidly. The passers passed, the set
ters set, and we served really tough, with only four ser
vice errors. You can't do better than that."
Ogonna Nnamani had a career-high 36 kills, more
than doubling the total of any other player on the court
and moving her into first place on the all-time kill list for
the Cardinal. Kristin Richards had 15 kills and a match
