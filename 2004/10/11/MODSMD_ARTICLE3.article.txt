# Phone through Friendster
## 
### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What if you could call anyone, anywhere in
the world, for free? Your host mom from your
quarter in Florence. Your sister working in Hong
Kong. Your boyfriend studying in Santiago. If
you're both Friendster users, you can do just that.
Representatives from the online social-net
working company were on campus Friday after
noon handing out free headsets that users can
plug into their computers to make free long-dis
tance phone calls to any other Friendster user in
the world. At Stanford, students seemed to show
interest in the service while some University of
ficials remained skeptical about Voice over In
ternet Protocol technology.
The technology is gaining popularity nation
wide. According to the Massachusetts-based
Yankee Group, a research and consulting firm.
Voice over IP had 131,000 subscribers at the
end of 2003. They project that by the end of this
calendar year. Voice over IP will have almost
one million subscribers.
Friendster spokeswoman Lisa Kopp said
that the service, called Friendster Phone, was

first made available to Friendster members on Sept. 30.
"We are offering this in order to give our users another
way to communicate," Kopp said. "It brings our users a safe,
easy and free way to talk to each other."
Friendster has partnered with Florida-based Voiceglo, a
Voice over Internet Protocol, also known as Voice over IP.
company, to offer this service. Voice over IP, as defined by
the Federal Communications Commission, is "a technology
that allows you to make telephone calls using a broadband In
ternet connection instead of a regular phone line."
Students seem enthusiastic about the new option. Howev
er, Information Technology Systems and Services staff ex
pressed doubts about the practicality of Voice over IP.
When members sign up for Friendster Phone, they will be
assigned a U.S. phone number that can be used to make calls
using an Internet connection.
Kopp noted that when two members meet each other on
line, there's no longer any need to give out a personal phone
number or email address. According to Kopp. there will also
be an option for users to upgrade their service through Voice
glo and receive other features such as caller ID, call forward
ing and voicemail.
Currently, Vonage. the New Jersey-based broadband
phone company, dominates the Voice over IP market with
over 275.000 lines in service. According to Vonage
spokesperson Mitchell Slepian, a high-speed Internet con
nection and a phone adapter are required for service. The

adapter allows Vonage users to reach landline telephones
through the Internet, fora monthly fee.
Junior Derek Huang, who is already a member of Friend
ster. first learned of the service on Friday from the Friendster
representatives.
"I think it's a great idea." Huang said. "If my friends use it,
I'll use it."
Kopp touted the service as a great option for college stu
dents who probably make a lot of long distance calls. When
users sign up for the service, they can get an area code of their
choice that might make it more convenient for their family to
call them.
"I think it's great for people with financial constraints,"
said graduate student Akbar Dhanaliwala. "However, with
cell phones, there's usually no worry about long distance calls
since you usually get free minutes anyways." But with Friend
ster Phone, international calls can be made.
Dhanaliwala also expressed some uncertainty about the
quality of the calls.
Stanford Network and Systems Administrator Ethan Rik
leen elaborated upon some of the difficulties people may face
when using Voice over IP. ,
"Using the Internet for phone calls means subjecting
phones to the problems with data networks." Rikleen said.
"Data networks are generally diverse environments, with all
sorts of different hardware and software. Even the most ho
mogenous corporate networks get new hardware and soft-

ware on a regular basis. As such, network congestion and out
ages are a fact of life."
Nancy Ware, the director of business planning and com
munication at ITSS, agreed that landlines arc a lot more reli
able, especially when it comes to reaching emergency services
and accommodating the hearing impaired.
"We're always looking at what we can do to serve the
Stanford community," Ware said. "There continues to be a
need for land lines on campus."
According to ITSS Technical Manager Bert Stubbs,
there are about 4,000 rooms that subscribe to phone lines.
He expressed skepticism over what will come out of this
new service.
"There's a variety of technology emerging and we don't
know what impact they will have," Stubbs said. "However, it
seems that [Friendster Phone] is limited in that both parties
need to be subscribers."
According to Kopp. Friendster has roughly ten million
users who mainly fall into the 18-35 year old demographic.
Representatives from the company also visited MIT, Har
vard. Berkeley. NYU, UCLA. UMich, Ulllinois-Urbana.
UMiami and UPenn this past Friday.
"So far. we're received a lot of really good feedback."
Kopp said. "People are really enjoying the service."
