Thousands are expected to at
tend the grand opening celebration
at the Graduate Community Center
this Friday. While the center opened
to students on Sept. 27, the official

have paid special attention to sup
port staff, safety and logistics due to
the large number of guests expected.
The producer of the event, GSC
Programming Director Michelle
Zamora, a Ph.D. candidate in mod
ern thought and literature, said she
hopes to promote of sense of com
munity for graduate students.
"We're trying to expose more
grads to the important work of the
GSC so they remember that they're
already members." Zamora said.
"We want all grads to know that the
GCC is for all of us."

Zamora and other GSC mem
bers have been working closely with
the Office of Student Activities and
the Stanford Police Department. In
addition, housing staff and the
Graduate Student Programming
Board have volunteered to help
with party organizing and opera

Bob Schaffer, a Ph.D. student in
electrical engineering and Rains

activities.
"I'm looking forward to volun

cooperation between the GSC and
the University to put on a great
party," he said.
