### JENNY ALLEN 
Thousands are expected to at
tend the grand opening celebration
at the Graduate Community Center
this Friday. While the center opened
to students on Sept. 27, the official
opening had been scheduled for
mid-October since construction
crews broke ground for the center in
January 2(X)4.
Graduate Student Council mem
bers, who are organizing the party,
have paid special attention to sup
port staff, safety and logistics due to
the large number of guests expected.
The producer of the event, GSC
Programming Director Michelle
Zamora, a Ph.D. candidate in mod
ern thought and literature, said she
hopes to promote of sense of com
munity for graduate students.
"We're trying to expose more
grads to the important work of the
GSC so they remember that they're
already members." Zamora said.
"We want all grads to know that the
GCC is for all of us."

Zamora and other GSC mem
bers have been working closely with
the Office of Student Activities and
the Stanford Police Department. In
addition, housing staff and the
Graduate Student Programming
Board have volunteered to help
with party organizing and opera
tions, such as bartending and check
ing identification.
Bob Schaffer, a Ph.D. student in
electrical engineering and Rains
Houses head community associate,
is leading a team of graduate com
munity associates to offer additional
activities.
"I'm looking forward to volun
teering at the party because, on top
of getting a thrill out of providing so
cial opportunities for others, I think
it's important to help spread the
message that people at Stanford are
interested in the well-being of grad
uate students." Schaffer said.
The GCC grand opening will fea
ture three DJs. the rock band After
Effect, two floors of dancing,
catered food and beverages, and

prizes including an iPod. commemo
rative wine, and plush spa packages.
In addition, Stanford Athletics plans
to raffle off season passes and other
giveaways. The event is sponsored
by the University.
The entire event is free to every
graduate student (plus a guest), and
alcohol will be served to those over
21 with valid identification.
Thomas Lee, the GSC Tax Coor
dinator, said he has been impressed
by the assistance received from cam
pus administrators, such as Christine
Griffith, the Associate Dean of
Graduate Student Life.
"There has been a strong spirit of
cooperation between the GSC and
the University to put on a great
party," he said.
Some Graduate Student Council
members, who were involved in the
many stages of planning for the Cen
ter, said the party will be a dream
come true.
"The grand opening will be a eel-

ebration the likes of which the grad
uate community has never seen."
said Roger Stanley, the GSC
Deputy Chair and a second-year
student at the Graduate School of
Business. "We expect to attract
roughly 2000 graduate students and
their significant others over the
course of the evening."
"Come early before the fire code
takes effect." he joked.
The GCC will become the main
on-campus hub for the University's
approximately 7800 graduate stu
dents. Construction of the facility
began on Jan. 26.2004 as a result of
GSC advocacy, support from the
Graduate Life Office and large
alumni donations.
The center contains meeting
spaces, a multipurpose room, a TV
lounge and a child's room for fami
lies, according to Alice Lincoln, a
chemistry Ph.D. candidate and the
GSC Webmaster. A pub will be
added during winter quarter.
"Graduate students, especially
those living off-campus, have strug
gled to find a place that is theirs,"
Schaffer explained. "And their labs
don't count. I think the new GCC
will be that place, and the party is a
good way to bring attention to the
new facility."
Since its unofficial opening, the
GCC has been increasingly utilized
by graduate student and campus or
ganizations.
Zamora said he has seen stu
dents watching the plasma televi
sion upstairs, and Lee reported ob

routine on the sprung wood floor in
the multipurpose room.
