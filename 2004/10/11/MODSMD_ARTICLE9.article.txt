# On this day in Stanford History...

1966 — On Oct. 11. The Daily ran a
story on increasing fraternity
strength on the Stanford campus.
Below is an excerpt:
"Plans for strengthening the fra
ternity voice at Stanford in the next
year were discussed at a meeting of
representatives from Stanford's
twenty-two fraternities and several
faculty members and administra
tors.
Meeting last Friday night at Del
Rio Lodge in Carmel, the group de
bated the fraternities' role in a resi
dential community. Both the suc
cesses and problems in meeting the
challenges inherent in a fraternity
system were analyzed.
Dr. James Watkins of the Politi
cal Science Department stressed the
need for small group living' in the
Stanford community, which is at
tracting more and more the 'intel
lectual who typically is concerned
with ideas and movements and not
with people.'
In a discussion group after [Asso
ciate Dean of Students] Dr. Gor
don's speech, ideas of how fraterni
ties can participate more active in
the Stanford community ranged
from having more 'think and drinks'
to organizing and strongly support
ing community service projects."
1984 - On Oct. 11. The Daily ran a
story on the difference between
Stanford and east coast schools.

Below is an excerpt:
"In his welcoming speech to the
class of 1988, University President
Donald Kennedy told the freshmen
of a problem facing their new
school.
The concern centers on Stanford
students' seemingly blithe accep
tance of the stereotype that Stan
ford is 'academically intense
enough, hut intellectually a bit lazy,
as though somewhat addled by the
sun.' Kennedy said. This tendency
to 'check all high-powered conver
sation at the door' is stronger here
than it is at Eastern schools, even
though Stanford has the 'same qual
ity of students.'
Kennedy is not alone. Many Uni
versity officials and students say
they share Kennedy's concern over
the penchant students here have for
feigning uninterest in societal con
cerns and issues of weighty intellec
tual matter outside of the classroom
setting.
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall says intellectual life here
often conforms to a 'California Cul
ture.' The opportunity for outdoor
activities such as tennis and swim
ming abound even in mid-winter, al
lowing students to engage in physi
cal activity just as easily as in reading
or discourse."
