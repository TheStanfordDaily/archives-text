Karen Armstrong
Islam: A Short History - and Contemporary Issues
When a Muslim in Saudi Arabia thinks of God, is he or she thinking of the
same God as the Jewish woman in St. Louis, the Catholic in Caracas,
Venezuela, or even a Muslim standing the very same spot a thousand years ago?
Karen Armstrong is one of the most provocative, original, and inclusive thinkers on the
role of religion in the modern world. She understands the acute differences between the
world's great religions and calls our attention to their profound similarities.
