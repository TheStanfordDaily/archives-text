# Faculty gear up for Election Day
## Profs' levels of involvement vary

Stanford students are not the
only ones increasing their political
involvement this year â€” faculty
members are also taking a greater
part in the political process. Some
are using their clout in nonpartisan
efforts to get out the vote, and others
are using the classroom as a forum to
air their political views.
Stephen Elliott, a Stegner fellow
and lecturer in the Creative Writing
department, launched Operation
Ohio last August to encourage
young residents of Ohio and other
swing states to vote. Elliott de
scribed Operation Ohio as a two
part project.
"First, it's a series of voter regis
tration readings with contemporary
authors across Ohio." he said. "The
second part is to create list of stu
dents in swing states who'd like to
receive a live reminder phone call
from an author on Election Day.
Just about every major young writer
in the country has volunteered," El
liott, 32.said.
Michael Chabon, ZZ Packer.
Dave Eggers. Heidi Julavitz, Neal
Pollack and Michael Cunningham
and Stanford English professor To
bias Wolff are among the authors in
volved.
Elliott said he is realistic about
the scope of the project's influence.
"We'll probably get to about
2,(XH) extra voters,"he said. "It's not
going to change the world, but it's
significant. No writer is ever eoing to

attract the crowd that Bruce Spring
steen attracts, but not everyone is
into Bruce Springsteen. But, hey,
maybe those people are into Tobias
Wolff," Elliot added.
The role of politics, a controver
sial topic on campuses as the elec
tion draws near, is an important but
tricky subject. Elliot said.
"[l'm] OK with talking about pol
itics in class, but when I'm talking
about politics, I'm mainly talking
about participation as opposed to
partisanship." he said.
As Election Day nears. some stu
dents report that professors are also
airing their political views in the
classroom.
"Even though I usually agree
with the blatantly liberal comments
that some of my professors make
during lectures and discussions. I'd
prefer that they'd restrain them
selves when it comes to airing their
political opinions in the classroom,"
said senior Jesse Redden.
"Many professors don't realize
that by carrying on with their politi
cal rants, they're actually reinforcing
the well-known stereotype of col
leges being bloated by left-leaning,
biased professors." Redden said. "In
many cases, they obscure the under
lying issues, which draws resentment
from moderate and conservative
students," she added.
Sophomore Vilas Rao said that
while partisanship in the classroom
may not be welcomed by all stu
dents, he doubts it has much influ
ence.
"I don't really mind it." Rao said.
"At this level of education, most
people will take ideas from their
professors and analyze them critical
ly instead of simply deferring to their
authority."
