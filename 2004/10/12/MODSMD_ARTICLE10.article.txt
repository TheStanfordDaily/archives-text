1939 —On Oct. 12, The Stanford
Daily ran a story on a German
speaker explaining Nazi motives and
the background for the war. Below is
an excerpt:
"Declaring that the European
situation should he 'handwriting on
the wall' for Americans, Dr. Hans
Buchinger outlined a post war hack
ground of current German motives
before a group of 75 at Luncheon
Club yesterday.
Although Dr. Buchinger spoke
with a slight accent, it proved an
adornment rather than an obstacle
to his speech. The young German,
who has taken his Ph.D. at the Uni
versity of Konigsberg, stated at the
outset of his talk that he would not
deal with current European events,
but rather with the background
which motivates them.
Starting with the abuses his
country suffered at the peace of
Versailles, Dr. Buchinger related
the feelings and tendencies of the
German people up through the
Czechoslovakia!! putsch. He de
scribed Hitler's philosophy by quot
ing him: "No one will get anything if
he does not ask for it.' Said Dr.
Buchinger: 'It's just like Mother
Hubbard standing before the cup
board with hands folded.'
Any brief which Dr. Buchinger
presented was. however, not one for
Hitlerism, but one for the German
people as a whole."
1970— On Oct. 12. The Stanford
Daily ran a story on a bomb threat to
the Stanford football stadium for the
Stanford-USCgame. Below is an ex
cerpt:

"'Football is Amerika at its Fas
cist worst - it is the Circus Maximus
of the Amerikan Empire.' began the
scrawled message found at the
Greyhound Bus Depot in San Fran
cisco at midnight Friday. The note
carried the chilling message that the
'stadium will be blasted if the game
goes on' and was signed 'The Bomb
Squad (Weatherman).'
A second, identical note was
found in Palo Alto the same night,
outlining the possibilities fora
bombing at the Stadium. Written in
the familiar script of the Weather
men. the note read:
"Jim Plunkett went to Vietnam
last summer on a tour sponsored by
the Defense Department and the
NCAA to help troop morale. We
will move against the USC-Stanford
game to help the people's morale!
'When the US government is
slaughtering people at home and
abroad, we will not allow football
games to divert people's minds from
this reality. The stadium will be
blasted if the game goes on. The
blood of those killed will be on the
hands of those who felt football was
so essential to the survival of the
Amerikan Empire that they chose
to play the game.'
President Lyman said the specta
tors in the stadium were showing
their determination not to allow
themselves to be intimidated by the
'malicious few." The University,
however, was concerned about the
way in which those determined
90,000 would get out of the stadium
if a bomb were indeed found.
