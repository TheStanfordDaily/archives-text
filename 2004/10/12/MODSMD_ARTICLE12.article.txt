How do we distinguish between thou
sands of different odors? Richard Axel and
Linda Buck were awarded the Nobel Prize
on Oct. 4 for answering this question and
others related to the inner workings of the
olfactory system.
Linda Buck was a post-doctoral re
searcher in Richard Axel's lab when she
began her landmark study on the olfactory
system in 1988. At the time, since odorant re
ceptors had not yet been identified, a num
ber of different theories were offered that at
tempted to explain odor discrimination.
On the other hand, color discrimination
had already been well worked out by then.
Scientists had found that only three types of
color receptors — called "cones" — are
needed to tell the subtle difference between
colors as close as aquamarine and purple. It
turned out that the answer to odor discrim
ination was much more complex.
It was clear to the researchers that in
order to understand how humans can dis
tinguish between more than 10.000 chemi
cals, the first step would be to find recep
tors that recognized these odors. As Buck
says in his commentary, "The Search for
Odorant Receptors," published in the re
search journal Cell. "I became obsessed
with finding the odorant receptors."
To find the odorant receptors. Buck
and Axel operated on two assumptions.
Firstly, odorant receptors should be pro
teins encoded by a family of genes that
would be related to each other; after all,
