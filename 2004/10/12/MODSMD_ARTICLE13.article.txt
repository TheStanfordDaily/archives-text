they all had some similar function. Sec
ondly, these receptors should be found in
the nose.
After several failed experiments. Buck
and Axel finally found five proteins that
were part of a superfamily called the "G
-protein coupled receptors." These proteins
had similarities that were not seen in other
menjbers of the superfamily. This suggested
that the proteins were members of a new
protein family.
The odorant receptors had thus been
found. In 1991. Axel and Buck published a
paper in Cell about the findings and details
of their discovery.
Once the receptors were discovered, fur
ther scientific investigation provided many
clues to the workings of the olfactory sys
tem. Among the many interesting discover
ies made was the finding that 350 of the
genes in humans encode functional odorant
receptors.
Another is that each olfactory receptor
cell only contains one type of odorant re
ceptor. The reason we can distinguish be
tween as many as 10,000 smells is that they
arc made up of many different types of
odorant molecules, which activate different
odorant receptors. This forms a pattern that
we remember as belonging to a particular
smell.
Many questions about the olfactory sys
tem remain, however.
With Axel and Buck's work paving the
way, it seems that the stage has been set for
scientists to determine the reasons why
odors can evoke strong memories and other
questions about our very unique sense of
smell.
