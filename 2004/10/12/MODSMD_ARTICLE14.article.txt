# A 						class for social entrepreneur wannabes
## Students get credit for planning a business venture 
### ABHI VASE 
When Binßin Jiang flipped through the Stanford
course catalog last year, her eyes fell upon a course
that piqued her interest. Little did the senior majoring
in human biology realize that "Social Entrepreneur
ship Startups" would become a consuming passion
and change the trajectory of her career path.
Like many at Stanford, Binßin wanted to have a
positive impact on the developing world. Her first
step was to enroll in "Social Entrepreneurship Star
tups," a two-quarter course sequence taught Prof. Bill
Behrman.
Behrman. the visionary behind the course sequence,
is a consulting assistant professor in the Civil and En
vironmental Engineering Department. He teaches the
undergraduate seminar CEE 450. which requires stu
dents to develop a thorough understanding of a social
problem and then present a business plan fora venture
to address it. Students in the seminar tackle problems
that range from the Bay Area housing crisis to unem
ployment among entry-level employees.
"With the projects generating such energy and en
thusiasm — both among the students and their expert

advisors — I
decided to ex
tend the pro
jects beyond
one quarter,"
Behrman
said, "and to
bring in lead
ing social en
trepreneurs
for the teams
to work with
to help trans
fer the ideas
to reality."
Last vear.

a team of undergraduate students did the initial back
ground research to determine the best international
location in which to deploy new innovative LED light
ing technology. LEDs use approximately 5 percent of
the energy of an incandescent bulb and last 10 times
longer. As such, they are an ideal solution in places
where power is hard to come by. LEDs would also be
a safer alternative to using kerosene lamps, thereby
reducing the number of burn incidents and respiratory
disorders.
After exploring possible locations in India. China
and Mexico, the undergraduate team selected India to
be the testbed for the new technology. During spring
quarter, teams of graduate students entered the fray as
the project transitioned into phase two: designing the
light, defining the user experience and creating a busi
ness plan.
At the end of the second quarter, students present
ed the business plan and the prototype light to an ap
preciative audience of engineers and venture capital
ists. The audience included David Halliday, founder
of Light Up the World Foundation. LIJTW is a non
profit organization committed to bringing LED light

ing to areas without electricity.
Ten of the students worked through the summer to
refine the prototypes and sharpen the business plan.
Some of the students even went "into the field" in
rural India to observe conditions and to work more
closely with their contacts there.
As a result of the students' work, a company has
now been born out of their venture. Ignite Innova
tions is led by pioneers from the SES class — Darren
Johnson, Sally Madsen, Matt Scott and Cory
Shaffhausen.
This year, the focus has shifted from the visual to
the auditory. The team for this year is working on
providing an affordable hearing solution to the 80
percent of the U.S. population with untreated hear
ing loss. After completing an initial feasibility study,
the team decided upon three methods of attack.
These are: developing a mobile screening and diag
nostic program to automate the diagnostic and fitting
process, automating the tuning process, and design
ing new high-quality products from off-the-shelf
components.
Both Jiang and Behrman agree that the SES class is
a resounding success. This can be seen not onlv in the

passion, commitment and energy of the students, but
in the quality of the expert advisory panel that
Behrman has assembled.
In addition to this, collaboration with design firms
like IDEO helps guide critical phases of the project. It
also equips engineers to think about the "fuzzy issues"
that drive the masses to adopt a technology.
Jiang said that she felt the course was the best one
that she has ever taken at Stanford because it allowed
students to truly make an impact by attacking a real
problem.
The Stanford community draws much of its
lifeblood from entrepreneurship and technical inno
vation. A toward social enterprises, however, has
been occurring on a global scale over the past
decade. In the Silicon Valley, a new breed of philan
thropic entrepreneurs has risen from the ashes of the
dot-com area and legitimized the burgeoning ranks
of social entrepreneurs. These include luminaries
such as Jeff Skoll of eßay and Vinod Khosla of SUN
Microsystems.
David Bornstein, a journalist who has done exten
sive research in the field, savs that "social en

trepreneurs have the ability to listen deeply and trust
their intuition; the willingness to serve as "hubs' link
ing others to create powerful, trusting relationships
that leverage both intellectual and emotional re
sources committed to positive social change."
In addition, social entrepreneurs also have "the
skill to create a business plan that is 'a blueprint, not a
poem' so that the model may be transferred to others
independent of geographic location or political
change; and the drive to bring an 'action orientation'
to the organization." Bornstein added.
Business schools have embraced this new brand of
entrepreneurship. They have launched a spate of com
petitions to encourage it, as well as centers to study it.
Stanford itself has introduced Stanford Social Inno
vation Review. University community members have
also started the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, a
worldwide consortium of academic institutions,
chaired by London Business School.
The Global Social Venture Competition is a part
nership that includes UC-Berkeley's Haas School of
Business, Columbia Business School. London Busi
ness School and the Goldman Sachs Foundation. Har
vard University launched a Social Enterprise lnitia-

tive in 1993. Over the past decade, it has increased the
number of fellowships offered by fourfold. It has also
seen a 15-fold increase in student participation, a five
fold increase in enrollment in social venture classes
and a fourfold increase in faculty involvement.
Stanford students have not been passively watching
either. In addition to the SES project course, The
Business Association of Stanford Engineering Stu
dents has been organizing the Social Entrepreneur
ship Challenge since three years ago. This competition
has seen a sustained level of interest from students,
with an average of 29 teams competing each year fora
total of $25,000 in prize money.
Past participants of the Social Entrepreneurship
Challenge have decided to keep going with their ideas.
Some are attempting to bring new lighting technology
to the developing world. Others are sparking en
trepreneurship among Palestinian youth. And more
still are preparing refugees for higher education in
other countries, teaching indigenous communities
how to read and write in their native language, and ex
pediting aid and assistance to disaster zones across the
globe.

Students from the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department's "Social Entrepreneurship Startups" course offered last year have started a company called
Ignite Innovations, which is working with organizations such as the Light Up the World Foundation to provide LED light to developing areas that lack electricity.
