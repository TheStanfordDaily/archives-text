### SU FEN LEE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford heat UC-Berkeley, 3-1, in the Stanford vs.
Berkeley Students Gaming Challenge that was held
last Friday.
Four Stanford students — Rona Ng, Tee Sing Tang,
Nigel Teo and Yaw Shin Yeo — pitted their car-racing
and shooting skills against their Cal counterparts. Each
of them took on an individual Berkeley student. The
winners of each one-on-one game were the champions
of the challenge.
Three of them. Rona Ng. Tee Sing Tang and Yaw
Shin Yeo, beat their counterparts to each win a Sam
sung Techwin digital camera.
Ng, Teo and Yeo played "Project Gotham Racing
2." while Tang fought it out with his counterpart over
"Halo."
Project Gotham Racing 2 is a car-racing video game
played on the Microsoft Xbox. Halo, also played on the
Microsoft Xbox, is an action-shooter game with vehic
ular combat elements. Players act as enemy troopers to
fight against each other in a battle environment.
Tang is a senior majoring in mechanical engineering
and a coterminal master's student in management sci
ence and engineering. He is also a member of Phi
Kappa Psi. which owns an Xbox in its fraternity house
on campus.
While Tang has experience playing Halo with his

fraternity brothers, the other members of the Stanford
team had never played Project Gotham Racing 2 prior
to this competition.
Anticipating that the Berkeley team would be com
prised of Project Gotham experts, the team feared a
humiliating thrashing. The day before the competition,
the team rented the video game from Hollywood
Videos and "practiced" playing the game using the
Xbox at Tang's fraternity house.
Ng, a senior and coterminal student in chemical en

gineering. has always been an ardent fan of cars. Claim
ing himself as a "car nut," he not only subscribes to car
magazines. He also enjoys playing car racing games
such as "Need for Speed: Underground."
He had not. however, played Project Gotham Rac
ing 2 before.
"You need to practice so that you can familiarize
yourself with the routes and anticipate the path
ahead." he said.
The team even arrived early at the competition
venue to practice playing the game. Held at the Bill
Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, the Stan
ford-Berkeley Challenge was held in conjunction with
the World Cyber Games 2004 that were taking place
from Wednesday to Sunday.
"1 thought we did not practice enough for the com
petition since we started playing only the night be
fore," Yeo said. "But when I asked my Berkeley coun
terpart just before the game started, he said he only
started playing the game three hours ago."
Both Yeo and Teo are first-year master's students in
management science and engineering.
WCG is a global gaming tournament that has been
held annually since 2000. This year is the first time that
WCG is being held outside of Korea. A total of 17
countries participated in WCG this year.
Games that were played in the tournament include
"Counterstrike: Condition Z" and "War Craft III:
Frozen Throne."
