# New advanced card entrance system unveiled at select dorms; kinks remain in program
## 
### CASSIDY DELINE 
Sleek electronic proximity card
systems have replaced traditional
keys at Branner Hall, Toyon Hall,
680 Lomita and Kappa Sig, allow
ing students to scan their Student
ID cards to unlock dorm doors.
With the new system, residents
simply wave the card in front of a
reader to fain entrance — the tech
nology behind this system, radio
frequency identification, is the
same that is used for Exxon
Mobil's Speedpass, which allows
drivers to pay for gas at the pump
without using cash or cards.
Student Housing is piloting the

proximity card system, with the
possibility of expanding the pro
gram campus-wide if the system is
a success, said Manager of Under
graduate Housing Operations
Imogen Hinds.
"A lot will depend on how the
pilot programs go and what the
feedback is from students and
staff." she said in an e-mail. "[lt
also depends on] if there is funding
to retrofit existing buildings and
support on-going operational
costs."
Funding has been an issue, she
said, since the program is new to
Stanford and requires that the in
frastructure of the buildings under

go costly upgrades including new
wiring, doors, and alarms.
Currently, students can use
both the proximity cards and door
keys to access buildings. Hinds
said. In Branner, the access cards
are not operational yet.
"You scan the card but it
doesn't unlock the door," Branner
resident Jeremy Hiatt, a freshman,
said. "It just beeps at you."
Students have been told that the
prox cards will work sometime
soon, possibly within the next
week. Hinds said.
"It seems like it would be pretty
cool if it worked," Hiatt said. "It
definitely would come in handv

and he a lot easier."
The proximity cards are not ex
pected to affect dorm safety. Hinds
said. Students agreed.
"One of the doors is usually un
locked anyway," Hiatt said. "So if
anybody wanted to get in, it really
wouldn't matter if they had a card
or a key."
Other universities have also
begun switching dormitories from
traditional brass key door entries
to more advanced electronic sys
tems.
Brown, Duke, Yale and Prince
ton have all recently unveiled simi
lar proximity card systems in their
dorms.
