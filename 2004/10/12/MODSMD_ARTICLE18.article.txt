## Editorial Make bike registration optional 
### 
California state and Santa Clara County law
requires students to register their hikes so
they can possibly be retrieved if stolen. This
registration law is typically enforced by local
police starting a few weeks into fall quarter when they
issue fix-it tickets to offending bicyclist s.
Although the law is designed to force students to
protect themselves from potential bicycle theft, stu
dents should not be required to spend time and
money for ineffective bicycle protection.
According to the police, bicycle registration serves
two purposes: It deters people from stealing bikes,
and it facilitates the recovery of stolen bikes.
However, a registration sticker can easily be
peeled off, and even though bicycle registration num
bers are entered into a database when registered, po
lice need probable cause to pull over a bicyclist and
scrutinize the bike.
Considering the questionable effectiveness of reg
istration, the $3.50 cost to register is really just a tax on
bicycles. More important than the minor cost is the
time that students must take to comply with unneces
sary legislation. Students have to wait in line in White
Plaza, go to the Stanford bike shop or go to the ()ffice
of Parking & Transportation.
If a student gets a ticket for not having his bike reg
istered, he can either pay the fine or register his bike.
After registration, the offending student has to search
fora police officer on campus or go to the police de
partment and wait for up to an hour. Many students just

pay the fine because complying with the fix-it require
ments can be difficult and time-consuming.
Furthermore, bike registration is a state law, but it
does not seem to be enforced off campus — only at
Stanford and possibly other college campuses.
Although the police do not spend an exorbitant
amount of time issuing tickets for not having a bike
registered, the time they do spend could be better
spent doing something else, such as catching bike
thieves.
According to the police, the law makes sense be
cause it is like requiring people to pay for insurance,
and society already has laws forcing people to protect
themselves.
However, the line has to be drawn somewhere.
People would be safer if they registered all expensive
items, including computers, televisions and refrigera
tors, but there are no registration requirements for
these goods.
Ultimately there is only so much people can do to
protect their property, and they must depend on law
enforcement. I lowever, there comes a point when law
enforcement isn't protecting students anymore but is
merely punishing them over something silly.
Bike registration should be a right, not a require
ment. Students should not be forced to register their
bike if they do not think it is worth their time and
money. In that case, they will lose the limited protec
tion that registration offers, hut in the end, they
should have the right to choose.
