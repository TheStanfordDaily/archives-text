## Tailgates not risk-free for minors 
### 
The Stanford Athletics Department's ongoing
attempt to create a more spirited sporting at
mosphere for football games backfired when
undercover investigators from California's
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control cited
Stanford tailgaters for underage drinking violations
two weekends ago.
Two undergraduates were charged with being mi
nors-in-possession, while a third student over 21 was
charged with serving alcohol illegally to those under
age minors. Students need be cautious when tailgat
ing, and the Athletics Department should ensure at
tendees are fully aware of the potential conse
quences they could face.
Many students regard tailgate parties as a fun and
loose environment where they can safely enjoy the
consumption of alcoholic beverages. However, a
tailgate party, like the rest of campus, is not a law
free zone. Students — both above and under the
legal drinking age — must be on guard to avoid sim
ilar repercussions. Those not of drinking age will
face legal consequences il they are caught.
Tailgating is essential in fostering an exciting,
spirited atmosphere at football games, but the Stan
ford Athletics Department is sending undergradu
ates a potentially misleading message when it en
courages them to participate in this activity. While
the Athletics Department has never advocated un
derage drinking itself, it is common knowledge that
tailgate parties usually involve the presence and con
sumption of alcohol.
Approximately half of the undergraduates at the
University are not of legal drinkini> age, and the Ath

letics Department needs to communicate more ef
fectively with this group in order to ensure that they
will not be consuming alcoholic beverages at future
tailgate parties.
We do believe that the Department had the best
of intentions in promoting tailgating, but now that
the threat of law enforcement has proven to be real,
the Department should go out of its way to provide
ample warning. They should always designate, just as
flyers for campus parties do, that while it is accept
able for minors to participate in tailgates, underage
drinking remains illegal and will not be tolerated.
It is no secret that enthusiasm for Cardinal home
football games is at a low. Even attendance at Big
Game — arguably the school's biggest sporting
event of the year — has dropped to the point where
Cal fans outnumbered Cardinal fans four to three on
home turf last year.
Reviving Stanford's tailgate culture could be a
boon to school spirit at the University. Therefore, it
is important that the Stanford Athletics Department
help remedy this situation before more incidents
occur and students become too intimidated to tail
gate at all.
Although the Athletics Department cannot pre
vent underage students from drinking, it should be
clear about the inevitable presence of alcohol at tail
gates and warn these students that drinking alcoholic
beverages is not allowed, even if it is a tailgate. Until
the Athletics Department is more upfront with stu
dents about the potential legal risks of tailgate par
ties. students will remain wary.
