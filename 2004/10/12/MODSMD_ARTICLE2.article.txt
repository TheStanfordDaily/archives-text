### WILL OREMUS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
The Stanford linear accelerator will be
closed lor at least two days after a bolt of
electricity torched a technician yesterday.
The worker was installing a circuit
breaker near an electrical panel in the two
mile-long particle accelerator around 11:15
a.m. when "for some reason we have not yet
ascertained, an electrical arc passed from
the circuit breaker to the panel." said Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center spokesper
son Neil Calder. "He was not electrocuted,
but the arc ignited his clothes and he was
thrown over backwards.
"He was wearing safety gloves, glasses,
thank God, a head scarf and boots," Calder
added.
Two other technicians quickly rolled

him over and smothered the fire, and noth
ing else was damaged, Calder said.
Calder did not release the victim's iden
tity but said he was a contract worker, not a
SLAC employee.
He was taken to the burn unit at Valley
Medical Center in San Jose with second
and third-degree burns on his legs and
upper body, Calder said.
The temporary closure probably will not
affect research at the accelerator: It was
only recently turned back on after a routine
"shutdown period" for maintenance, and a
new round of experiments is not scheduled
to start until later this week, Calder said.
Accidents are rare at the facility, one of
the world's leading centers for particle
physics research. Calder said the last injury
at SLAC occurred in January' when a work
er fell off a ladder.
