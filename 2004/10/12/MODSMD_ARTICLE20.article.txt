## Freshmen advising clarifies objectives By JULIE LYTHCOTT-HAIMS, LORRAINE STERRITT & STEVEN ZIPPERSTEIN 
### 
We arc pleased that the text of
The Daily's Oct. 7 editorial
("Goals not met in advising
changes," Oct. 7) acknowledges
that our undergraduate advising
program "meets most of its objec
tives," and we appreciate having
the opportunity to clarify some
practical and some philosophical

aspects of the program.
Our objective is to match each
freshman with an adviser who will
serve as an intellectual guide to
the student. As you might imag
ine, it is desirable that the advisor
and the advisee share some intel
lectual interest rather than having
no common ground. This connec
tion provides a starting point for
the adviser / advisee relationship.
In addition, advisers have re
ceived training and guidance on

the importance of giving general
advice, as you recommend they
should.
At our training sessions for ad
visors, we emphasize that we ac
tively encourage students to
spread their wings and sample a
variety of subjects before they
choose one in which to major.
Given that we want to assign each
freshman to an adviser, it simply
