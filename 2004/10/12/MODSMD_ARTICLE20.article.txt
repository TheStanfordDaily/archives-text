## Freshmen advising clarifies objectives By JULIE LYTHCOTT-HAIMS, LORRAINE STERRITT & STEVEN ZIPPERSTEIN 
### 
We arc pleased that the text of
The Daily's Oct. 7 editorial
("Goals not met in advising
changes," Oct. 7) acknowledges
that our undergraduate advising
program "meets most of its objec
tives," and we appreciate having
the opportunity to clarify some
practical and some philosophical

aspects of the program.
Our objective is to match each
freshman with an adviser who will
serve as an intellectual guide to
the student. As you might imag
ine, it is desirable that the advisor
and the advisee share some intel
lectual interest rather than having
no common ground. This connec
tion provides a starting point for
the adviser / advisee relationship.
In addition, advisers have re
ceived training and guidance on

the importance of giving general
advice, as you recommend they
should.
At our training sessions for ad
visors, we emphasize that we ac
tively encourage students to
spread their wings and sample a
variety of subjects before they
choose one in which to major.
Given that we want to assign each
freshman to an adviser, it simply
any subject that may be of interest
to them and to consult with special
ists in the office of Undergraduate
Advising Programs.
We eliminated the requirement
that the adviser and advisees meet
as a group because we believe ad
vising is best served when predicat
ed on an intellectual relationship
between the adviser and student,
and neither students nor advisors
felt that the gathering of the group
was conducive to that effort.
The reasoning behind the dis
mantling of the group was not, as
you suggest, a matter of salvaging
more time for faculty, but rather, a
matter of how best to serve the in
tellectual needs of students. In fact,
faculty and staff advisers will likely
spend an equivalent or greater
amount of time on advising this
year than in previous years.

makes sense that they have some
common interest at the outset.
We have heard from many ad
visers and advisees about how
happy they are with the matches.
We have also heard from some who
aren't so happy. The latter are the
cases in which we were not able to
match up intellectual interests as
well as we would have hoped. The
number of advisers in any given
field doesn't necessarily correlate
with the number of students inter
ested in that field.
We have not heard any advisers
or students complaining about
being too closely matched on the
basis of intellectual interest. We
also emphasize with advisers that
they should encourage the fresh
men to seek advice from experts in

One-on-one time increased

That said, any adviser who wish
es to gather the advisees fora social
event is welcome to do so, with our
support. It is an option rather than
a requirement.
Finally, you incorrectly state
that advisers do not receive extra
compensation for their work.
While it is modest to be sure, this
year for the first time we are pro
viding an honorarium to advisers as
compensation for their efforts.
