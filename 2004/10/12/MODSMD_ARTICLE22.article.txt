## Post Office glitches cause voting problems 
### 
One wishes every incom
ing Stanford freshman
had the same public
spirit my friend Kai
Lukoff does: "When they can't get
me my ginger snap cookies from
home, yeah, that sucks. But when
they can't get me my ballot —
that's serious."
Kai had just received a Califor
nia sample ballot in his box at the
Stanford Post Office. The only
problem was, Kai was not regis-

tered to vote in
California. The
voter guide he
received had
been addressed
to Steven Crow
ell, but the Stan
ford Post Office
blacked out
Crowell's name
and put it in
Kai's box.

This wasn't a first. Other peo
ple, including some who are not
registered to vote, who are not old
enough to vote or who are regis
tered in other states, have received
misdelivered voter guides with the
addresses blacked out.
Because Kai got the sample bal
lot, maybe Steven doesn't know
where his polling place is for this
November's election. Or maybe
Steven got the sample ballot ad
dressed to someone else, and so
will head to the wrong polling
place on election day. For each
person who gets a sample ballot
that shouldn't have, there is some
one who should have got one but
did not.
At least a thousand people on
this campus will vote by mail this
election. I'm going to be in Las
Vegas making sure swing voters
get to the polls on election day. so
I'll be one of them.
There's a legitimate worry that
Stanford students who are voting
in their home states, will be away
for election day, or just prefer the
convenience of voting by mail
might not get a chance to vote be
cause of the Post Office's errors.

The Stanford post office has
had a rough year, despite the best
of intentions. But especially in an
election year, mail is for keeps.
If you miss an ITSS bill you'll
soon get another one, unfortunate
ly. Likewise, if you miss an "exclu
sive" offer from a credit card com
pany, don't worry, there's more of
fers to come.
But if you're a couple of days
late returning an absentee ballot —
or you don't receive it at all — the
election won't wait for you.
What if they put up a big sheet
on the wall with an alphabetic list
of everyone involved in the box
number confusion, and what their
current P.O. box is? Then for each
piece of mail they get they could
check that list, determine what the
person's current box number is,
and deliver the mail correctly.
The extra workload might re
quire hiring a few temporary em
ployees fora few months, which
might even put the post office into
the red. But it's worth doing.
Thousands of pieces of one
time-only elections material will
be passing through the post office
in the next four weeks. When it
conies to voting, the conventional
wisdom is true: the first time
should always be special.
The post office should take par
ticularly seriously its obligation to
deliver the mail correctly, and elec
tions materials should be the last
place to cut corners.
When you put a piece of mail in
the wrong box, that's a mistake.
When you black out the address on
a piece of mail and deliver it to
somebody else instead, it's also a
crime.
But when your crime results in a
young person being denied the
right to vote, a right that so many
young people have given their lives
for. then it's time to take action.
