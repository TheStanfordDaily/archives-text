Sculpture offers pertinent critique
of American society
The Daily editorial hoard's
statement Friday ("President
widely rejected statue," Oct. 8)
proclaiming the University's re
jection of Dennis Oppenheim's
sculpture "Device to Root out
Evil" justified because of the
work's ambiguity must be one of
the most ludicrous arguments one
could make against a work of art.
I am curious as to how the edi
torial board could write an ex
traordinarily pedantic paragraph
on the subjective nature of art. and
then follow this with a criticism of

this particular sculpture because
"some people" could read it as of
fensive.
I would hope that at a Universi
ty of all places there would not be
a sort of institutionalized philistin
isni that refuses ambiguity in a
work of art. There is nothing ex
plicitly offensive about the sculp
ture, though its imagery and title
could be read as a critique of mod
ern American Christianity. Is this
group exempt from criticism?
Considering the president of
the United States prays for guid
ance from God in his divine mis
sion to "root out" evil and terror
ism, I would argue that Oppen

heim's sculpture provides an in
triguing, and yes, ambiguous visu
alization of this American reli
giosity.

America should not attempt to
reform foreign governments
The main opposition candidate
in Afghanistan's first-ever presi
dential election backed off a boy
cott of the vote, saying Monday
that he would accept the findings
of an independent commission to
look into alleged cheating.

Election observers, the U.S.
Embassy and Karzai have all
sought to put the best face possi
ble on the vote, noting that Tal
iban rebels were mostly silent and
that turnout was high in a nation
that has never before tasted
democracy.
After more than 23 years of war
and chaos, Afghanistan is really a
mess. Despite all the American aid
and promises to rebuild the coun
try, it's a wreck. The capital,
Kabul, is becoming more prosper
ous. but only because that's where
most of the U.S. and coalition
troops are based to provide securi
ty. and because that's one of the

few places the aid organizations
feel safe enough to operate.
Outside Kabul, the country is
still full of poverty, potholes, dev
astation, bandits, guerrillas and
anarchy. Those who have the most
guns run things, just as they have
for hundreds of years â€” the war
lords. Most of the warlords have
their own private armies, com
plete with tanks, artillery and
other heavy weaponry.
They're so ignorant of the rest
of the world, the last thing they
need to be doing is meddling in
Afghanistan. Iraq and the
Mideast. As the old saying goes,
"Power corrupts, and absolute

power corrupts absolutely." When
it does, then things can get pretty
nasty.
But for the time being, at least,
a little benevolent dictatorship is
working better in that corner of
Afghanistan than the so-called
democracy that the U.S. has im
posed on Kabul. It's not that it's
perfect; it's just more functional.
America's trying to remake the
world in its own image with its own
form of government, but different
peoples and nations simply need
different forms of government.
