## Volleyball heads to Card coach's old home 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Stanford head coach John Dunning, tonight's
matchup against the unranked University of Pacific
Tigers will be an odd sort of homecoming.
Dunning will lead the No. 12 Cardinal (11-4, 4-1
Pacific-10 Conference) against the school that he
used to call his home. Dunning coached the Tigers
(10-3, 7-1 Big West Conference) for 16 years before
coming to the Farm in 2001. During his stint, Dun
ning compiled a fantastic 437-102 record (.837 win
ning percentage) and led Pacific to back-to-back
NCAA titles in 1985-86.
"The first year here at Stanford, it was a little
weird going back to play at Pacific." Dunning said. "I
still knew a lot of the players and we raised our fam
ily there, so it will always feel a little like home."
The Cardinal enter Tuesday's match after split
ting matches in Los Angeles, losing to Southern Cal
ifornia Friday night before beating UCLA on Satur
day night in an impressive victory. The showing
places them second in the Pac-10, behind the No. 1

Washington Huskies.
Momentum is not just on the Cardinal's side. The
Tigers are also coming off a victory over UC-River
side. Historically, Stanford holds an edge on Pacific,
posting a 29-23 all-time record against the Tigers.
This game marks the second time since the begin
ning of Pac-10 play that the Cardinal have picked up
a non-conference game mid-week. The first was a
loss against St. Mary's College two weeks ago.
"We've done this a lot throughout the years,"
Dunning said. "I like tough situations like this where
you need to rise to the occasion and pay attention to
every opponent. Every opponent is getting better."
Stanford remains confident despite a loss this
weekend to USC. The team is proud of the way it
turned in a competitive finish following a sluggish
start against the Women of Troy. That swagger car
ried over into Saturday's match against the Bruins,
when the Cardinal dominated.
"We had dinner at Courtney Schultz's house on
Saturday evening and Ogonna [Nnamani] talked to
the team," Dunning said. "For whatever reason, the
team felt scared going against USC. and Ogonna

helped them get over that. She remembered her
Olympic experience and how she had to grow over
her intimidation of the international scene, and that
experience helps her lead our team."
In addition to motivating the team, Nnamani, a
senior 6-foot-1 outside hitter from Normal, 111., post
ed a career-high 36 kills and surpassed former Na
tional Player of the Year Logan Tom for first on the
all-time kills list here on the Farm. For her efforts,
Nnamani was also named Pac-10 Player of the Week,
garnering the award fora second time this year.
"I really don't look at personal records like that,"
Nnamani said. "1 owe a lot of credit to my teammates
because if they don't get the job done, then I can't do
mv job. Without a good pass or a good set. there is no
kill."
One teammate essential in the Cardinal machine,
however, is still out with an injury. Senior libero
Leahi Hall continues to recover from a nagging ham
string injury, but is expected to return to the court
soon.

key against UOP Tigers

"Leahi practiced as full [yesterday] as she has since she
got hurt," Dunning said. "It's a good iest for her and she did
dig some balls. We'll see how she feels tomorrow. Her return
depends on what she and our trainer think."
The Cardinal will look for strong play from their improv
ing middle blockers, sophomore Lizzie Suiter and freshman
Franci Girard. By having an option in the center, the Stan
ford attack can be much more diversified in its efforts.
"Four of them go so hard in practice everyday. Michelle

[MellardJ and Jen [Wilson] haven't played very much, but
they're still getting a lot better." Dunning said. "If they keep
doing this, there's no telling how good we can be at the end
of the season. Lizzie and Franci are way ahead of where we
thought they'd be right now."
Following the match against Pacific, the Cardinal will re
turn to Burnham Pavilion on Friday fora matches against the
Oregon State Beavers and the Oregon Ducks.

Pacific-10 Conference) against the school that he
used to call his home. Dunning coached the Tigers
(10-3, 7-1 Big West Conference) for 16 years before
coming to the Farm in 2001. During his stint, Dun
ning compiled a fantastic 437-102 record (.837 win
ning percentage) and led Pacific to back-to-back
NCAA titles in 1985-86.
"The first year here at Stanford, it was a little
weird going back to play at Pacific." Dunning said. "I
still knew a lot of the players and we raised our fam
ily there, so it will always feel a little like home."
The Cardinal enter Tuesday's match after split
ting matches in Los Angeles, losing to Southern Cal
ifornia Friday night before beating UCLA on Satur
day night in an impressive victory. The showing
places them second in the Pac-10, behind the No. 1

Washington Huskies.
Momentum is not just on the Cardinal's side. The
Tigers are also coming off a victory over UC-River
side. Historically, Stanford holds an edge on Pacific,
posting a 29-23 all-time record against the Tigers.
This game marks the second time since the begin
ning of Pac-10 play that the Cardinal have picked up
a non-conference game mid-week. The first was a
loss against St. Mary's College two weeks ago.
"We've done this a lot throughout the years,"
Dunning said. "I like tough situations like this where
you need to rise to the occasion and pay attention to
every opponent. Every opponent is getting better."
Stanford remains confident despite a loss this
weekend to USC. The team is proud of the way it
turned in a competitive finish following a sluggish
start against the Women of Troy. That swagger car
ried over into Saturday's match against the Bruins,
when the Cardinal dominated.
"We had dinner at Courtney Schultz's house on
Saturday evening and Ogonna [Nnamani] talked to
the team," Dunning said. "For whatever reason, the
team felt scared going against USC. and Ogonna

helped them get over that. She remembered her
Olympic experience and how she had to grow over
her intimidation of the international scene, and that
experience helps her lead our team."
In addition to motivating the team, Nnamani, a
senior 6-foot-1 outside hitter from Normal, 111., post
ed a career-high 36 kills and surpassed former Na
tional Player of the Year Logan Tom for first on the
all-time kills list here on the Farm. For her efforts,
Nnamani was also named Pac-10 Player of the Week,
garnering the award fora second time this year.
"I really don't look at personal records like that,"
Nnamani said. "1 owe a lot of credit to my teammates
because if they don't get the job done, then I can't do
mv job. Without a good pass or a good set. there is no
kill."
One teammate essential in the Cardinal machine,
however, is still out with an injury. Senior libero
Leahi Hall continues to recover from a nagging ham
string injury, but is expected to return to the court
soon.

"Leahi practiced as full [yesterday] as she has since she
got hurt," Dunning said. "It's a good iest for her and she did
dig some balls. We'll see how she feels tomorrow. Her return
depends on what she and our trainer think."
The Cardinal will look for strong play from their improv
ing middle blockers, sophomore Lizzie Suiter and freshman
Franci Girard. By having an option in the center, the Stan
ford attack can be much more diversified in its efforts.
"Four of them go so hard in practice everyday. Michelle

[MellardJ and Jen [Wilson] haven't played very much, but
they're still getting a lot better." Dunning said. "If they keep
doing this, there's no telling how good we can be at the end
of the season. Lizzie and Franci are way ahead of where we
thought they'd be right now."
Following the match against Pacific, the Cardinal will re
turn to Burnham Pavilion on Friday fora matches against the
Oregon State Beavers and the Oregon Ducks.
