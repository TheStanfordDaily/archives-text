# Women's soccer ties rival Bears
## Cal goalie scores in final minutes to send match into double overtime 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Since rolling past Denver and Marquette at the Santa
Clara Adidas Classic two weeks ago, the Stanford
women's soccer team has found the " W" to be a little hard
er to come by. Take a 0-0 double-overtime tie to Santa
Clara and a 2-1 last minute win over St. Mary's as exam
ples.
Needless to say. the No. 16 Cardinal (8-2-2) were hop
ing for an easier road to success in Sunday afternoon's
match-up against No. 11 California (7-2-2). Unfortunately
it was not be. as the Cardinal blew a lead in an unlikely
turn of events with three minutes remaining in regulation
to send the game into overtime. From there, Stanford and
the Golden Bears battled it out through two overtimes
only to finish in a deadlocked 1-1 tie.
The tie puts both teams in the middle of the Pac-10
standings behind Arizona, UCLA and Southern Califor
nia, who each finished the opening week with two wins.
"1 was disappointed that we didn't get the results and
that we didn't win because we were up by a goal with less
than five minutes remaining," said head coach Paul Rat
cliffe. "I thought we played well enough to ensure the vic
tory."
Indeed the Cardinal were expecting better results
against California who, while being a skilled team, is
known primarily for its highly aggressive play. While Stan
ford came into the game prepared fora physical match-up,
the Bears' used their strength to undo the Cardinal's
rhythm and break up their possession play.
"Cal is a very physical team, and it was hard to adjust to
that style." said junior defender Hayley Hunt, who man
aged one shot on the afternoon. "We typically are a pos
session-oriented team, and I think the physicality disrupt
ed that a little."
Together the Cardinal and the Bears collected a stag
gering 39 fouls in just 110 minutes of play. In fact, Stan
ford's 19 fouls is the most it has put up against any oppo
nent all season.
"It was a battle," said Ratcliffe of the game's physical
nature. "Cal's a highly ranked team and we're a highly
ranked team and then the rivalry in addition to those made
fora real battle."
A highly physical game in turn led to a low scoring one.
While putting up offensive drives, neither team was able
to find the net until the game's final minutes.
The Bears outshot the Cardinal 5-4 in the opening half.
However, it was the Cardinal who held the overall edge,
posting 16 shots against the Bear's 13.
The Cardinal were led in this category by senior for
ward Marcie Ward and junior midfielder Leah Tapscott,
who together combined for half of the team's shots.
For much of the game, however, the spotlight was on
the two goalkeepers. Stanford's senior Nicole Barnhart
and California's Ashley Sulprizio put up identical num
bers as each keeper played 110 minutes, posted seven

saves, and allowed just one goal apiece.
The second half began much like the first with each
team playing aggressively but struggling to score.
It was the Cardinal who finally broke the game open
when Tapscott fired a header into the California net in the
81st minute of play.
The play began when senior midfielder Amy Grady
was awarded a free kick following a California foul. She
kicked the ball far toward the California net where Tap
scott was positioned for the header.
Tapscott now has four goals and 10 points on the sea
son and has scored in the Cardinal's last two games.
With less than ten minutes remaining, the game's in
tensity escalated as the Bears tried desperately to put up a
miracle goal against an unyielding Cardinal defense.
In a rare sequence of events, the Bears' prayers were
answered with less than three minutes remaining in regu
lation. California's goalkeeper Sulprizio scored the game
tying goal when she and her entire team were brought into

the Stanford zone on a corner kick as part of a strategy to
rush the net. The goal was the first of her collegiate career.
The 6'l" keeper used her size and leaping abilities to
jump over the Cardinal defenders and head the cross pass
from teammate Chioma Igwe past Barnhart.
"I have never seen that happen before," said Ratcliffe.
"I've seen it on the professional level, but it is very rare to
see a keeper score on a header."
The last minute goal sent the game into overtime,
where the Cardinal and Bears remained stuck at a 1-1 tie.
The Cardinal outshot the Bears 6-2 through two overtime
sessions, but were unable to convert any of their opportu
nities into goals.
"1 think we are all pretty disappointed." said Hunt.
"Cal is a huge rivalry for not only our team but the entire
school. We had the victory within sight and then had a
small lapse in concentration."
The Cardinal will look to redeem themselves at home
this weekend against Arizona and Arizona State.
