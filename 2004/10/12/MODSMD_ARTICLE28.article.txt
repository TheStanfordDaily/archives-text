# Warburg falls in epic match in ITA championship final
## 
### KAIYA REEVE STAFF WRITER 
After three days of intense competition,
the Stanford men's tennis team finished up
play at the Icy Hot / Intercollegiate Tennis
Association Ail-American Championships
in Chattanooga, Tenn.
Senior standout Sam Warburg, ranked
No. 2 in the singles draw, advanced to the fi
nals, the first time a Cardinal has made such
an appearance since K.J. Hippensteel won
in 2001. But Warburg was not to follow his
tory, taking a heartbreaking 7-5, 2-6, 6-3
loss in the finals by No. 1 Catalin Gard of
Mississippi.
The rest of the tournament was equally
disappointing for the Cardinal.
Warburg lost the first set in a match that
marked the first time since 1991 that the top
two seeds have battled it out in the finals at
the Icy Hot / ITA Championships. In a con
test that lasted two hours and 20 minutes,
Warburg lost the first set before making a
huge turnaround to claim the second set vic

tory. It looked as if the Stanford senior was
going to secure the win after taking the lead
2-0 in the third set, hut Gard bounced back.
The Rebel player broke serve twice, once at
2-2 and then again at 5-3, eventually ousting
his formidable opponent.
Despite his loss, Warburg was the only
player who managed to win a set against
Gard. The Ole Miss senior, originally from
Galati, Romania, grabbed the champi
onship title after battling through six rounds
of opponents.
The road to the finals was not easy for
Warburg, either, who defeated five oppo
nents before going head-to-hcad with Gard.
Janne Holmia of Florida was the first to
go down, losing 6-4,6-2 to Warburg. Second
round action saw Warburg trampling Clay
ton Almeida. 6-2. 6-4. In the Round of 16,
Luigi d'Agord of Alabama took a 6-4, 7-5
beating.

After three days of intense competition,
the Stanford men's tennis team finished up
play at the Icy Hot / Intercollegiate Tennis
Association Ail-American Championships
in Chattanooga, Tenn.
Senior standout Sam Warburg, ranked
No. 2 in the singles draw, advanced to the fi
nals, the first time a Cardinal has made such
an appearance since K.J. Hippensteel won
in 2001. But Warburg was not to follow his
tory, taking a heartbreaking 7-5, 2-6, 6-3
loss in the finals by No. 1 Catalin Gard of
Mississippi.
The rest of the tournament was equally
disappointing for the Cardinal.
Warburg lost the first set in a match that
marked the first time since 1991 that the top
two seeds have battled it out in the finals at
the Icy Hot / ITA Championships. In a con
test that lasted two hours and 20 minutes,
Warburg lost the first set before making a
huge turnaround to claim the second set vic

tory. It looked as if the Stanford senior was
going to secure the win after taking the lead
2-0 in the third set, hut Gard bounced back.
The Rebel player broke serve twice, once at
2-2 and then again at 5-3, eventually ousting
his formidable opponent.
Despite his loss, Warburg was the only
player who managed to win a set against
Gard. The Ole Miss senior, originally from
Galati, Romania, grabbed the champi
onship title after battling through six rounds
of opponents.
The road to the finals was not easy for
Warburg, either, who defeated five oppo
nents before going head-to-hcad with Gard.
Janne Holmia of Florida was the first to
go down, losing 6-4,6-2 to Warburg. Second
round action saw Warburg trampling Clay
ton Almeida. 6-2. 6-4. In the Round of 16,
Luigi d'Agord of Alabama took a 6-4, 7-5
beating.

Warburg's NCAA champion doubles partner,
junior KC Corkery, also competed in the main
draw, playing his way into the second round after a
6-3,2-6,6-2 victory over Malcolm Scatliffe of Penn
State. Hut. like his partner, Corkery was not see
victory either— a 2-6, 6-1. 6-3 loss to Doug Stew
art of Virgina ended his tournament hopes.
Reunited in the doubles draw. No. 1 Corkery
and Warburg claimed an 8-6 first round victory
over Harvard's Brandon Chiu and Jonathon Chu.
But the pair didn't look like defending champs in
round two, where New Mexico's unranked David
Kowalski and Ryan Stotland upset them, 8-5.
While part of ihe Cardinal team struggled in
Chattanooga, freshman Phil Kao and junior Jon
Wong represented Stanford in the Bronco Classic
at Santa Clara University with a bit more success.
