## The
						ugly truth about the color purple and its effect on sports 
### 
Les Expos de Montreal are no more. The
convoluted red, white and blue "Meb"
will he relegated to retro hats and jer
seys worn by hip-hop stars and French-Cana
dian baseball fans (all 2(X) of them). We might
see a return of the gallant white "W" on the
red hats of the new Washing-

ton, D.C. Senators (version
3).
Some might say this is an
other case of Major League
Baseball reneging on its duty
to support small-market
teams like Montreal. Yes.
only one of eight playoff
teams — the Minnesota
Twins (a.k.a. Washington
Senators, version 1) —is

considered low budget. And yes, the Yankees
eliminated them Saturday afternoon.
But I think that the more salient trend is
the return of strong, traditional colors to uni
forms of expansion teams. Gone are the days
of teal and purple. The Charlotte Hornet ef
fect might finally be wearing off.
In 1988, the expansion Hornets brought
professional basketball to the Carolinas. They
reached the peak of their popularity a few
years later with a stacked lineup of Larry
Johnson, Alonzo Mourning, and the 5-foot-3
Muggsy Bogues. All the cool kids at Burns
Park Elementary owned a Hornets cap.
It was cool, but it was hideous. I mean,
check out this official logo description: "A teal
hornet with purple eyes and purple striped
stinger with a purple H with Charlotte written
in white on his chest dribbling an orange bas
ketball, while wearing white sneakers with
teal soles and purple laces."
For those of you scoring at home, that's
two teals and four purples.
The Hornet effect spread wildly. Other ex
pansion teams adopted similar color schemes.
In 1995 the Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina
Panthers came into the National Football
League wearing teal and neon blue respec
tively. In 1998 the Arizona Diamondbacks
and Tampa Bay Devil Rays took the field in
purple and cream and teal.
I'm not a color purist. My dislike of these
aberrational hues is not solelv aesthetic. It is
