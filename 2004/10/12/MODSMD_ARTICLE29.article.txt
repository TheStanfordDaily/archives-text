## The 						ugly truth about the color purple and its effect on sports 
### 
Les Expos de Montreal are no more. The
convoluted red, white and blue "Meb"
will he relegated to retro hats and jer
seys worn by hip-hop stars and French-Cana
dian baseball fans (all 2(X) of them). We might
see a return of the gallant white "W" on the
red hats of the new Washing-

ton, D.C. Senators (version
3).
Some might say this is an
other case of Major League
Baseball reneging on its duty
to support small-market
teams like Montreal. Yes.
only one of eight playoff
teams — the Minnesota
Twins (a.k.a. Washington
Senators, version 1) —is

considered low budget. And yes, the Yankees
eliminated them Saturday afternoon.
But I think that the more salient trend is
the return of strong, traditional colors to uni
forms of expansion teams. Gone are the days
of teal and purple. The Charlotte Hornet ef
fect might finally be wearing off.
In 1988, the expansion Hornets brought
professional basketball to the Carolinas. They
reached the peak of their popularity a few
years later with a stacked lineup of Larry
Johnson, Alonzo Mourning, and the 5-foot-3
Muggsy Bogues. All the cool kids at Burns
Park Elementary owned a Hornets cap.
It was cool, but it was hideous. I mean,
check out this official logo description: "A teal
hornet with purple eyes and purple striped
stinger with a purple H with Charlotte written
in white on his chest dribbling an orange bas
ketball, while wearing white sneakers with
teal soles and purple laces."
For those of you scoring at home, that's
two teals and four purples.
The Hornet effect spread wildly. Other ex
pansion teams adopted similar color schemes.
In 1995 the Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina
Panthers came into the National Football
League wearing teal and neon blue respec
tively. In 1998 the Arizona Diamondbacks
and Tampa Bay Devil Rays took the field in
purple and cream and teal.
I'm not a color purist. My dislike of these
aberrational hues is not solelv aesthetic. It is

based on strong scientific research that shows that teams
clothed in awful colors do not win championships.
Case 1: The Detroit Pistons won back-to-back NBA
championships as the Bad Boys fifteen years ago. They re
tired the red, white and blue uniforms when they retired the
numbers of Isaiah. Joe D. Vinnie "Microwave" Johnson and
Bill Laimbeer. When they signed the new rising star Grant
Hill, they brought in fresh duds featuring a teal horse with
noxious purple tailpipes.
Sure, now we know that no Dukie should ever be allowed
to play in the great state of Michigan. Now we know that
Grant Hill will be forever beset by injuries. But it wasn't until
the Pistons returned to the red. white and blue that they
were able to overcome their demons and dismantle the fash
ionable but selfish and overrated Lakers for the league
crown.
Case 2: The Tampa Bay Devil Rays were the laughing
stock of the American League every year since their incep
tion minus one (thanks to the Detroit Tigers). Then they
hired Lou Piniella, called up the phenomenal young short
stop B.J. Upton, and proceeded to win 12 straight games and
finish out of the cellar for the first time in team history.
This dramatic turnaround in fortune coincided with the
adoption of a traditional dark green and black jersey
scheme. Mere chance? I think not.
Case 3: The Charlotte Hornets won one playoff series in
13 years and moved to New Orleans. End of story.
Stanford is not immune to the craze of new uniforms. The

football team abandoned their all-white home jerseys with
the simple red stripes on the pants and the simple red "S" on
the helmets after the successful 2(X)1 Seattle Bowl campaign.
Buddy Teevens brought in his high-powered Buddy
Ball(tm) offense, and with it shiny new elaborate uniforms.
You all know what happened next.
C»ranted. there are many mitigating factors in Stanford's
down period. The team has finally adjusted to Teevens' plan
and has turned it around this year. The endzone is no longer
forbidden territory. Opponents have found that the pocket
is no longer a hit-free safe bubble. We had USC against the
ropes. A post-season bowl game is within reach.
Notre Dame beat us on Saturday afternoon in a close
game that was eminently winnable. What came over the
team when we were leading 15-10 in the fourth quarter?
Maybe it was the mystique of Touchdown Jesus, maybe it
was seeing Tyrone's scowl on the other sideline, or maybe it
was the Irish's revamped rushing attack. But don't discount
the intangibles like the simple, anti-Charlotte Hornets, old
school, blue jerseys and gold helmets we were up against.
You know, I just noticed that Cal has added ugly, asym
metric, blue swaths to the sides of their uniforms. If my the
ory holds, this might be the year we bring the Axe back to the
Farm.
