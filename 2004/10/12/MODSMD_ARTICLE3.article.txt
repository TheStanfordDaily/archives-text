# Student may sue over speech policy
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Graduate student Kai Stinchcombe. president
of the Stanford Democrats, said he may sue the
University after the school barred him from par
ticipating in a "Kerry Power Hour," a phone hank
ing party, in White Plaza or anyplace else on cam
pus. a decision he argued is a violation of state law.
Stinchcombe. who regularly contributes to The
Daily's opinions page, said Sunday that he would
take the University to court unless it changed its
administrative policy restricting partisan political
activity on campus.
The first "Kerry Power Hour" met last week at
the Geology Corner, drawing 45 students, said
event co-organizer senior Jenny Tolan.Volunteers
called undecided voters in swing states and tried to
pitch Senator John Kerry.
However, when Tolan attempted to organize
Sunday's event in White Plaza, she was told by the
Office of Student Activities that the partisan na
ture of the event disqualified it from utilizing any
Stanford facilities under federal non-profit regula
tions. When Tolan noted that students would use
their own cell phones and suggested moving the
event to a dorm room, she was again denied, forc
ing her off campus.
"Unfortunately, holding it off campus makes a
huge difference in participation," Tolan said,
adding that just nine students attended.
Tolan also said the event was not organized by
any particular group, but rather a collection of

"Stanford students who want to help get out the
vote for Kerry." and therefore should not have
been restricted by the policy, which targets Uni
versity-sponsored groups and individuals.
Stinchcombe. who said he has consulted with
First Amendment lawyers, argued that the policy
is a violation of California Education Code 94367.
"The California Education Code says that if the
government can't prohibit it off-campus, the Uni
versity can't prohibit it on-campus — it is a free
dom of speech issue," he said.
University guidelines do not entirely ban parti
san activities on-campus. Memo 15.1, Section 3A
of the University's Administrative Guide reads:
"Because the University encourages freedom of
expression, political activities which do not rea
sonably imply University involvement or identifi
cation may be undertaken... Examples of permis
sible activities [include] use of areas, such as White
Plaza, for tables, speeches and similar activities."
OSA Director Nanci Howe, who is in charge of
event planning in White Plaza and initially told
Stinchcombe and Tolan that they could not gather
there, said that her office would be re-evaluating
the policy as it applied in this case.
"Our goal is to provide any clarification of Stan
ford's policies and practices that may be needed,
and to do so very quickly," she said in an e-mail to
leaders of campus political groups.
President of the Stanford College Republicans
Bob Sensenbrenner, a junior, said he would re
spect the University's final ruling.
"As a registered student group of the IJniversi

ty, we are taking extra pains to comply with the
OSA guidelines." Sensenbrenner said "So what
ever method the University chooses, we will try
our hardest to maintain compliance."
Tolan expressed regret about the situation.
"I understand the University's position, but by
not allowing students to gather on campus, it dras
tically discourages student involvement, and each
participant is so important this close to the election
— that's why we're fighting so hard, because we
believe it's worth fighting for." Tolan said.
Stinchcombe outlined a possible solution.
"The University's tax code stipulates only that
they must be fair, either by granting or forbidding
access totally. All individuals, regardless of their
political views, should have access to a public space
like White Plaza — that would be in compliance
both with equal access under the tax code and free
speech protection under the education code."
Stinchcombe said.
Tolan said she hopes the University makes its
decision in time for the next "Kerry Power Hour,"
scheduled to take place this Sunday. "As I under
stand it now, it is our legal right to gather at White
Plaza," she said.
"I don't think of the University as the enemy. 1
don't feel that way," Tolan added. "I don't think the
University is trying to purposely suppress students'
rights. I think this is a legal misunderstanding, and
hopefully, we can come to an agreement soon."
The Office of Government and Community
Relations and the General Counsel's Office
could not be reached in time for comment.
