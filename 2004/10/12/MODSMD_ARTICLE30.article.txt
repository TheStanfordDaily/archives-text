## 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most sports teams talk about follow
ing a certain formula to win games. The
women of the Stanford field hockey
team seem to have adopted their own
specific formula, too.
Unfortunately, the end result of the
formula hasn't been wins.
The Cardinal (6-9.0-4 Northern Pacif
ic Athletic Conference) lost 2-1 to No. 12
Boston College (10-6,1-2 Big East Con
ference) in a non-conference game on
Sunday at a neutral site. Maxwell Family
Field House in Berkeley.
The Boston College Eagles handed
Stanford its fifth loss in six games. Four
of these five losses have been by one
goal, and seven of the nine total losses
this season have been decided by one
goal as well.
The Cardinal scored first to take an
earlv lead in each of these losses, and

true to form, the Stanford women
struck first against BC.
Sophomore forward Liz Robinson
continued to provide the offensive
spark for the Cardinal, scoring unassist
ed in the 16th minute. Robinson, one of
the many talented young players on the
Stanford team, is tied at five goals with
freshman forward Jessica Zutz to lead
team scoring. She has found the net in
each of the team's last two games, in
cluding the game winner against St.
Louis last Monday.
The Cardinal continued to follow
their season-long formula, allowing BC
to tie and eventually eke out the win by
one goal.
Junior forward Sabrina Lazzari
found freshman midfielder Crystal
Frates in front of the net for the tying
goal in the 19th minute. Lazzari picked
up her fifth assist of the season to go
along with an impressive team-high 16 goals.
The teams went into the half lied, although BC
had clearly taken control of the game. The offen
sive pressure from BC cracked the Cardinal de
fense in the 42nd minute, as senior Kern Doherty
scored on a penalty corner on an assist from junior
Kristen Madden. The Eagles' second goal held up
for the rest of the game.
Throughout the game, the Cardinal were
backed up on their defensive end, trying to stifle
the prolific BC attack led by Lazzari.
Stanford was outshot 19-4 and gave up eight
penalty corners while only earning two. Lazarri
tied the Stanford shot total herself, recording a
game-high four shots. Stanford senior goalkeeper
Ana Kralovec kept the Cardinal in the game with a
fantastic 10-save showing.
Sophomore back Aska Sturdevan also helped
keep the Eagles from running away with the game by
recording the game's only defensive save. Sturdevan
has a team-high four defensive saves this season.
"Our entire defense, especially Ana Kralovec in
the cage, played really well today against a lot of
pressure," said head coach Lesley Irvine.
On the other side, Boston College goalkeeper
Jillian Savoy was barely tested, as she recorded one

save in the win.
The Cardinal have now played two highly
ranked teams in close matches. Two weeks ago, the
Cardinal took the No. 11 California Bears into
overtime and lost hy a single goal. Although losses
are never easy to accept, the Cardinal have drawn
confidence from their even play against touted op
ponents.
"We were proud of the way we played today but
disappointed in the outcome," Irvine said. "We
had some chances to win this game against a good
Boston College team."
The Stanford women will have a brief hiatus be
fore they go back to conference play for their last
two games of the season.
Their next game is against conference rival Pa
cific on Oct. 23, Stanford's last regular season
home matchup. The Cardinal close out their sea
son with a rematch against rival Cal on Oct. 30.
With a good week and a half of practice, the
Cardinal hope to get back on track before the Nor-
Pac conference tournament by earning a pair of
wins against two quality opponents.
"We're still looking for our first NorPac win,"
Irvine said. "We are looking forward to playing
well in both of these games."

home matchup. The Cardinal close out their sea
son with a rematch against rival Cal on Oct. 30.
With a good week and a half of practice, the
Cardinal hope to get back on track before the Nor-
Pac conference tournament by earning a pair of
wins against two quality opponents.
"We're still looking for our first NorPac win,"
Irvine said. "We are looking forward to playing
well in both of these games."
