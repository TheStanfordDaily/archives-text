Florence Moore Dining will
close Fridays and Saturdays starting
Nov. 5 but has already extended din
ner hours to 8 p.m. and breakfast
hours to 10 a.m.
The changes were made because
of low weekend dining hall use and
in response to a series of meetings
over the course of last year, said
Acting Executive Director of Stan
ford Dining Rafi Teherian.
"On Fridays and Saturdays at
Florence Moore, less than 50 per
cent of the residents eat their lunch
and dinner there, and Friday break
fast, only 20 percent do," he said.
"The enhancements and upgrades
to the meal plan were made in re

the 'Dinner Dining Services' series
meetings that included students,
Stanford Dining staff and Universi
ty administrators."
Teherian also emphasized that
FloMo residents can use their meal
plan to eat anywhere on campus
when the dining hall is closed.
"This was the students' number
one concern and request last year."
he said.
Despite Teherian's optimism,
many students expressed doubt
about the new plan.
Paloma resident Jennifer Liu, a
freshman, felt that students were
not adequately notified about the
