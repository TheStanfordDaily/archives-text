# FloMo dining to close on weekends
## 
### ERIK HOPE 
Florence Moore Dining will
close Fridays and Saturdays starting
Nov. 5 but has already extended din
ner hours to 8 p.m. and breakfast
hours to 10 a.m.
The changes were made because
of low weekend dining hall use and
in response to a series of meetings
over the course of last year, said
Acting Executive Director of Stan
ford Dining Rafi Teherian.
"On Fridays and Saturdays at
Florence Moore, less than 50 per
cent of the residents eat their lunch
and dinner there, and Friday break
fast, only 20 percent do," he said.
"The enhancements and upgrades
to the meal plan were made in re
sponse to feedback received during
the 'Dinner Dining Services' series
meetings that included students,
Stanford Dining staff and Universi
ty administrators."
Teherian also emphasized that
FloMo residents can use their meal
plan to eat anywhere on campus
when the dining hall is closed.
"This was the students' number
one concern and request last year."
he said.
Despite Teherian's optimism,
many students expressed doubt
about the new plan.
Paloma resident Jennifer Liu, a
freshman, felt that students were
not adequately notified about the

new dining schedule.
"It's tragic," Liu said. "It feels
like they sprung it on us. All I want
to do is get up and stagger to
brunch."
Gavilan resident Ankur Gupta, a
freshman, was also unhappy with the
change and did not think that the
added dinner hours make up for the
lost days.
"No one really utilizes it being
open until 8 p.m.," Gupta said.
Other residents reacted more
passionately to the change. Asked
what she thought about the new
schedule. Loro resident Sasha
Rosse, a junior, said she thought it
was "unacceptable"
"I think it's a terrible, wretched
schedule," Rosse added.
Rosse was also skeptical of the
suggestion that FloMo residents eat
at another dining hall on Fridays and
Saturdays.
"There are no other dining halls
near here," she said.
Gavilan resident Kevin Choo, a

freshman, was equally dismayed by
the changes.
"It makes me very upset," he
said. "Starting in November, I'm
having a hunger strike everv week
end."
Choo was appreciative but not
won over by the dining hall's later
hours during the week.
"It's definitely good, but it's not
worth the change," he said.
Although many residents are vo
cally dissatisfied with the impend
ing schedule change, the original
plan called for the dining hall to
never serve meals on Fridays and
Saturdays. That FloMo Dining is
staying open seven days a week
through October represents a com
promise, said Paloma RA Tommy
Leep. a junior.
"We were unaware of any din
ing plan changes when we got
here," Leep said. "We tried to
come up with a solution and the
dining folks were kind enough to
meet with us. I pitched the idea

Students complain that
weekend closures are unfair

that the dining hall he open all
week in October, and they said.
'Yeah, we can do that'."
Leep said that not having a din
ing hall to eat at on Fridays and
Saturdays is especially problematic
for freshman dorms because it
makes it harder for RAs to get to
know their residents. The compro
mise solution is important in that
regard, he said.
"Part of the reason we wanted it
to be open fora month is because
there is a critical period where you
get to know people," Leep said.
Once the seven-day-a-week meal
service ends, Leep hopes that FloMo
can retain a sense of community on
weekends by having barbecues and
going to other dining halls as a
group.
"The dining hall has agreed to
help us out with barbecues because
they can't keep the dining hall open
weekends," he said. "My hope is that
we can fall into a routine of eating
communally."

new dining schedule.
"It's tragic," Liu said. "It feels
like they sprung it on us. All I want
to do is get up and stagger to
brunch."
Gavilan resident Ankur Gupta, a
freshman, was also unhappy with the
change and did not think that the
added dinner hours make up for the
lost days.
"No one really utilizes it being
open until 8 p.m.," Gupta said.
Other residents reacted more
passionately to the change. Asked
what she thought about the new
schedule. Loro resident Sasha
Rosse, a junior, said she thought it
was "unacceptable"
"I think it's a terrible, wretched
schedule," Rosse added.
Rosse was also skeptical of the
suggestion that FloMo residents eat
at another dining hall on Fridays and
Saturdays.
"There are no other dining halls
near here," she said.
Gavilan resident Kevin Choo, a

freshman, was equally dismayed by
the changes.
"It makes me very upset," he
said. "Starting in November, I'm
having a hunger strike everv week
end."
Choo was appreciative but not
won over by the dining hall's later
hours during the week.
"It's definitely good, but it's not
worth the change," he said.
Although many residents are vo
cally dissatisfied with the impend
ing schedule change, the original
plan called for the dining hall to
never serve meals on Fridays and
Saturdays. That FloMo Dining is
staying open seven days a week
through October represents a com
promise, said Paloma RA Tommy
Leep. a junior.
"We were unaware of any din
ing plan changes when we got
here," Leep said. "We tried to
come up with a solution and the
dining folks were kind enough to
meet with us. I pitched the idea

Students complain that
weekend closures are unfair

that the dining hall he open all
week in October, and they said.
'Yeah, we can do that'."
Leep said that not having a din
ing hall to eat at on Fridays and
Saturdays is especially problematic
for freshman dorms because it
makes it harder for RAs to get to
know their residents. The compro
mise solution is important in that
regard, he said.
"Part of the reason we wanted it
to be open fora month is because
there is a critical period where you
get to know people," Leep said.
Once the seven-day-a-week meal
service ends, Leep hopes that FloMo
can retain a sense of community on
weekends by having barbecues and
going to other dining halls as a
group.
"The dining hall has agreed to
help us out with barbecues because
they can't keep the dining hall open
weekends," he said. "My hope is that
we can fall into a routine of eating
communally."
