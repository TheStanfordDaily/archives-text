### CYNTHIA H. CHO MANAGING EDITOR 
Editor'.y note: Oil Sept. 29, The Daily ran a
story about the announcement of this year's
Mac Arthur Fellows. This story profiles the
two Stanford recipients in more depth.
What would you do with $500,000?
You could buy 3.144 Grankulla / Mas
sum futons from Ikea. You could buy
23,K09 bleacher-seat tickets fora weekend
Giants baseball game. You could buy
133,333 original-sized Mango-A-Go-Gos
from Jamba Juice.
Or you could change the world — at
least that's what executives at John D. and
Catherine T. Mac Arthur Foundation hope.
Late last month, the foundation an
nounced this year's Mac Arthur Fellows,
which included Computer Science Prof.

Daphne Koller and Biochemistry, Microbi
ology and Immunology Prof. Julie Theriot.
They, along with 21 other recipients, have
until January of 2005 to figure out how they
will use their "no strings attached" half-a
million-dollar award.
Koller said that when she received a
phone call about the award, she was told,
"This is the last time you'll hear from us.
There are no reports, no requirements."
She said that the news was "overwhelm
ing."
"It |the grant] is not something one ex
pects to get because ... the list of candi
dates is (he entire population of the United
States," Koller said.
Candidates for the Mac Arthur Fellows
Program are nominated, evaluated and se
lected through a confidential process - one
cannot apply for the award. According to
the foundation's press release, recipients
are selected "for their originality, creativity

and the potential to do more in the future."
In the same release, Jonathan F. Fanton,
president of the Mac Arthur Foundation,
said that the Fellows Program "illustrate[s|
the Foundation's conviction that talented
individuals, free to follow their insights and
instincts, will make a difference in shaping
the future."
For both Stanford professors, the
awards — commonly known as "genius
grants" — will allow them to pursue inter
ests that they are not currently working on.
Roller said that she does not plan to use
the Mac Arthur grant money toward any of
her current research projects.
"This kind of money allows you to step
hack and evaluate research opportunities
without being constrained by funding," she
said, adding that she has been "fortunate"
in getting funding through other resources
for her current research.
Since joining the computer science department
at Stanford in 1995, Roller has focused her research
on using computational models to understand how
different objects within different systems interact.
For one of her current projects, Koller uses compu
tational models — building a model of a real-world
system within the computer to simulate what would
happen in that system under different circum
stances — to study the biological processes of a
cell.
Koller also explained how computational mod
els could be used to understand activities in physi
cal space.
"For example, a scanner can be set up in an el
derly person's home, and it can get a feel for the
person's movement pattern so that if anything was
abnormal, say that the person missed breakfast for
several days, the scanner can detect that something
is wrong," she explained.
Within days of the public announcement of the
awar — the recipients found out earlier — Koller
had received more than 150 congratulatory e-mails.
And with interview requests from national and
local media packing her schedule. Koller said that
she was looking for things to "get back to normal."
Koller celebrated with her husband and daughter
over dinner.
"There isn't much you can do with a 2-year-old,"
she said.
Koller is expecting a second child in November,
but that isn't slowing her down. She is teaching this
quarter, on a compressed schedule, until Nov. 13,
only a week before she is scheduled to give birth.
Theriot, who joined the Stanford faculty in 1997,
said that when she first received the phone call from
the Mac Arthur Foundation, she thought that she
was being solicited fora donation.
"I thought it was someone from a charity." she
said. "It took quite a while to sink in."
Though she was not supposed to tell anyone
about the award, she said that she told a few people.
When the news became public, she was inundated

with e-mails and phone calls.
Theriot's research focuses on understanding
how bacterial pathogens interact with the body and
rearrange the structural elements of a cell. Though
Teriot said that there are no societal impacts of this
kind of work yet, she said that understanding the
process is important for medical research and that
clinical applications could be done 10 to 15 years.
Starting at an early age, Theriot said that she
"loved watching things crawl on a microscope."
Her office walls and doors are covered with posters
and photos of cells and other biological process.
And she showed this reporter a short digital movie
of a cell becoming infected by a bacterial pathogen.
Describing the Mac Arthur grant as "venture
capital for creativity," Theriot said that she would
not use the money for any of her current research.
"The foundation says it gives the award for cre
ativity ... that is a challenge to do something new."
she said. She added that she has been able to get
funding for her past and current research projects
and so she plans to use this award to pursue some
thing she has not done already.
"I want to go to the Galapogos or Antarctica, so
I might skim off a little [from the grant]," she said
with a smile.
"Andy Warhol said that everyone has 15 min
utes of fame," she said. "I am enjoying this as much
as I can."
But Theriot will not let the media attention get
in the way of her work. On a Friday morning, when
she spoke to this reporter, she was finishing a grant
application that she was completing fora 6 p.m.
FedEx pickup and getting ready to administer a
final exam for one of her two classes that she is
teaching this quarter. Over the weekend, she had
planned to finish a second grant application that
was due the following Monday.
Though she has not decided what she will do with
the money, she said that she will throw a "great big
party" for her lab.
"The grant is honoring the work that came out
from the group," she said.
