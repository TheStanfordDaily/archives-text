What would you do with $500,000?
You could buy 3.144 Grankulla / Mas
sum futons from Ikea. You could buy
23,K09 bleacher-seat tickets fora weekend
Giants baseball game. You could buy
133,333 original-sized Mango-A-Go-Gos
from Jamba Juice.
Or you could change the world — at
least that's what executives at John D. and
Catherine T. Mac Arthur Foundation hope.
Late last month, the foundation an
nounced this year's Mac Arthur Fellows,
which included Computer Science Prof.

Daphne Koller and Biochemistry, Microbi
ology and Immunology Prof. Julie Theriot.
They, along with 21 other recipients, have
until January of 2005 to figure out how they
will use their "no strings attached" half-a
million-dollar award.
Koller said that when she received a
phone call about the award, she was told,
"This is the last time you'll hear from us.
There are no reports, no requirements."
She said that the news was "overwhelm
ing."
"It |the grant] is not something one ex
pects to get because ... the list of candi
dates is (he entire population of the United
States," Koller said.
Candidates for the Mac Arthur Fellows
Program are nominated, evaluated and se
lected through a confidential process - one
cannot apply for the award. According to
the foundation's press release, recipients
are selected "for their originality, creativity

and the potential to do more in the future."
In the same release, Jonathan F. Fanton,
president of the Mac Arthur Foundation,
said that the Fellows Program "illustrate[s|
the Foundation's conviction that talented
individuals, free to follow their insights and
instincts, will make a difference in shaping
the future."
For both Stanford professors, the
awards — commonly known as "genius
grants" — will allow them to pursue inter
ests that they are not currently working on.
Roller said that she does not plan to use
the Mac Arthur grant money toward any of
her current research projects.
"This kind of money allows you to step
hack and evaluate research opportunities
without being constrained by funding," she
said, adding that she has been "fortunate"
in getting funding through other resources
