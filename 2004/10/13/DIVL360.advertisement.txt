Karen Armstrong
Islam: A Short History - and Contemporary Issues

same God as the Jewish woman in Sr. Louis, the Catholic in Caracas,
Venezuela, or even a Muslim standing the very same spot a thousand years ago?

role of religion in the modern world. She understands the acute differences between the
world's great religions and calls our attention to their profound similarities.
