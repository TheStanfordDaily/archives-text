The Opposite of Fate
by Amy Tan
Wednesday, October 20,2004 • 7:OOPM
Kresge Auditorium, Stanford University
In her first book of nonfiction, bestselling novelist Amy Tan shares her personal philosophy
of fate. Amy Tan was born into a family that believed in fate. In The Opposite of Fate: A
Book of Musings, she explores this legacy, as well as American circumstances, and finds ways
to honor the past while creating her own brand of destiny. She discovers answers in every
day actions and attitudes-from writing stories, decorating her house with charms, learning to
ski, and living with squirrels, to dealing with three members of her family afflicted with brain
disease, surviving natural disasters, and shaking off both family curses and the expectations
that she should become a doctor and a concert pianist. With the same spirit, humor, and
magic that characterize her beloved novels, Amy Tan presents a refreshing antidote to the
world-weariness and uncertainties we face today, contemplating how things happen-in her
own life and beyond-but always returning to the question of fate and its opposites: the
choices, charms, influences, attitudes, and lucky accidents that shape us all.
