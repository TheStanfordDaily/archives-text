# Large donation paves way for grad dorms
## Munger helps Univ. to near-record fundraising year 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford raised a total of $524 million
in contributions during the 2003-2004 fis
cal year, the second most successful year
in Stanford's fundraising history.
Last year's success was due in large
part to Charles Munger's $43.5 million
donation toward graduate student hous
ing — the largest housing donation any
one has given to Stanford.
But the figure also signals the Univer
sity's stability and prestige at a time when
philanthropy is becoming increasingly
important at both private and public uni
versities.

Burt McMurtry, Chairman of Stan
ford's Board of Trustees, said the success
of last year's fundraising campaign can
be attributed to the quality of the Uni
versity.
"Stanford faculty have ideas they can
present very well," McMurtry said. "And
in philanthropy, your job is to find things
which you can feel passionate about."
McMurtry said the Campaign for Un
dergraduate Education, which was de
veloped to raise $1 billion for undergrad
uate programs by the end of 2005, has yet
to reach its fundraising goals for certain
programs such as need-based financial
aid and overseas studies. Still, the cam
paign is slated to come to a conclusion in

Dec. 2005.
Thirty-nine percent of alumni donat
ed to the Stanford Fund or another facet
of undergraduate education, an increase
from the previous year's participation
rate of 38.4 percent.
"Every gift is important," said Martin
Shell, the associate vice president for de
velopment. "Alumni participation is a
sign of engagement. It's a little bit like
voting — people who make a gift indicate
they care about the University."
Though this year's alumni participa
tion rate nears fiscal year 2000's record of
40.1 percent. Shell says that there is room

for improvement.
"Forty percent is clearly better
than a few years ago, but we're not
satisfied with that," he said. "We
don't think it's reflective of the level
of engagement of alumni."
Of the total amount raised last
year, $209 million went into the
University endowment. The en
dowment increased by 18 percent,
putting it at slightly over $10 billion.
The average gift size for the
2003-2004 fiscal year was $4,760,
though 25 percent of those gifts fell
between $100 and $499.
The role of philanthropy
Stanford's fundraising success
this past year was second only to
Harvard's, according to Shell. He
attributed the University's lag be
hind Harvard to its relative youth
and its relatively new fundraising
efforts.
"There's not as rich a tradition
of philanthropy [at Stanford] as
there is at comparable East Coast
schools," he said.
For example, the Stanford Fund
for Undergraduate Education has
only been in existence fora little
more than 10 years, and while the
idea of centering fundraising efforts
around class reunions has been used
on the East Coast for years, Stan
ford only adopted the strategy in
the past decade.
Additionally. Shell said, non
profit foundations are on the rise all
over the West Coast.
"At one level you might say
there's competition between insti
tutions with a shared donor popula
tion." he said. "Though when an in
stitution does a good job engaging
its alumni, in some ways it's better
for all institutions. A rising tide rais
es all boats."
Philanthropy is integral to the

'A rising tide raises all
boats' in fundraising

development of institutions of high
er education, according to Paul
Brest, president of the William and
Flora Hewlett Foundation and for
mer dean of the Law School.
"There are three sources of
funding [for higher education]: tu
ition, which pays fora very small
part; government grants, which
pays for research in the sciences pri
marily; and philanthropy from
alumni and foundations," Brest
said. "But nothing can replace the
importance of alumni giving."
Public universities are especially
stepping up their efforts to garner
alumni support. According to a pol
icy brief released by the Brookings
Institution in 2003, state financing
of higher education has steadily de
clined for more than a decade, af
fecting the roughly three quarters of
college students who attend public
schools in the United States.
"I think public universities fora
long time relied solely on tuition
and on legislature and appropria
tions for legislature," Brest said.
"But even before the economic
downtown. University of California
was realizing it needed to engage in
fundraising."
The power to change a campus
One of Stanford's largest pro
jects that needs fundraising is the
newly formed Stanford Institute for
the Environment, which is designed
to unify and enhance various exist
ing programs in fields related to the
environment.
"If you think about what the po
tential sources are for an interdisci
plinary institute, the general budget
of a university can only pay for cer
tain things." said Civil and Environ
mental Engineering Prof. Jeff Kos
eff, co-director of the institute.
"If you want to build a new pro

gram, give fellowships, bring in new
faculty, the way you do that is by
going out and getting gifts."
A single donation can have a
profound impact on the atmosphere
of the campus, as evidenced by the
Clark Center, the central facility of
the University's Bio-X initiative, to
which Netscape founder Jim Clark
donated $90 million.
Munger's contribution toward
housing for law students and other
graduate students will also signifi
cantly alter the face of campus, and
Munger himself has been deeply in
volved in the planning process.
"He clearly enjoyed getting in
volved," Shell said. "And the more
an individual or organization is in
volved in the process, the greater
their understanding of it. And, of
course, we have a fiduciary respon
sibility to ensure that the resources
are in keeping with the donor's in
tentions."
Some people on campus have
voiced confusion and concern re
garding the new building. Shell in
sists that though negotiations over
details are often necessary, the Uni
versity would not compromise its
goals to suit the needs of its donors.
"Clearly donations are driven by
University plans" and not the other
way around. Shell said.
With the Campaign for Under
graduate Education wrapping up
next year. Shell said the University
is now in the process of identifying
the next set of needs that will "come
together as a fundraising effort that
will touch all of the University."
"Part of what we do in [the office
of development] is take the Univer
sity's goals and work hard with the
donor population to meet those
goals-we try to connect the vision of
Stanford with the donor. Clearly we
have some pretty good ideas out
there from academic leaders that
donors want to support."

"There's not as rich a tradition
of philanthropy [at Stanford] as
there is at comparable East Coast
schools," he said.
For example, the Stanford Fund
for Undergraduate Education has
only been in existence fora little
more than 10 years, and while the
idea of centering fundraising efforts
around class reunions has been used
on the East Coast for years, Stan
ford only adopted the strategy in
the past decade.
Additionally. Shell said, non
profit foundations are on the rise all
over the West Coast.
"At one level you might say
there's competition between insti
tutions with a shared donor popula
tion." he said. "Though when an in
stitution does a good job engaging
its alumni, in some ways it's better
for all institutions. A rising tide rais
es all boats."
Philanthropy is integral to the

'A rising tide raises all
boats' in fundraising

development of institutions of high
er education, according to Paul
Brest, president of the William and
Flora Hewlett Foundation and for
mer dean of the Law School.
"There are three sources of
funding [for higher education]: tu
ition, which pays fora very small
part; government grants, which
pays for research in the sciences pri
marily; and philanthropy from
alumni and foundations," Brest
said. "But nothing can replace the
importance of alumni giving."
Public universities are especially
stepping up their efforts to garner
alumni support. According to a pol
icy brief released by the Brookings
Institution in 2003, state financing
of higher education has steadily de
clined for more than a decade, af
fecting the roughly three quarters of
college students who attend public
schools in the United States.
"I think public universities fora
long time relied solely on tuition
and on legislature and appropria
tions for legislature," Brest said.
"But even before the economic
downtown. University of California
was realizing it needed to engage in
fundraising."
The power to change a campus
One of Stanford's largest pro
jects that needs fundraising is the
newly formed Stanford Institute for
the Environment, which is designed
to unify and enhance various exist
ing programs in fields related to the
environment.
"If you think about what the po
tential sources are for an interdisci
plinary institute, the general budget
of a university can only pay for cer
tain things." said Civil and Environ
mental Engineering Prof. Jeff Kos
eff, co-director of the institute.
"If you want to build a new pro

gram, give fellowships, bring in new
faculty, the way you do that is by
going out and getting gifts."
A single donation can have a
profound impact on the atmosphere
of the campus, as evidenced by the
Clark Center, the central facility of
the University's Bio-X initiative, to
which Netscape founder Jim Clark
donated $90 million.
Munger's contribution toward
housing for law students and other
graduate students will also signifi
cantly alter the face of campus, and
Munger himself has been deeply in
volved in the planning process.
"He clearly enjoyed getting in
volved," Shell said. "And the more
an individual or organization is in
volved in the process, the greater
their understanding of it. And, of
course, we have a fiduciary respon
sibility to ensure that the resources
are in keeping with the donor's in
tentions."
Some people on campus have
voiced confusion and concern re
garding the new building. Shell in
sists that though negotiations over
details are often necessary, the Uni
versity would not compromise its
goals to suit the needs of its donors.
"Clearly donations are driven by
University plans" and not the other
way around. Shell said.
With the Campaign for Under
graduate Education wrapping up
next year. Shell said the University
is now in the process of identifying
the next set of needs that will "come
together as a fundraising effort that
will touch all of the University."
"Part of what we do in [the office
of development] is take the Univer
sity's goals and work hard with the
donor population to meet those
goals-we try to connect the vision of
Stanford with the donor. Clearly we
have some pretty good ideas out
there from academic leaders that
donors want to support."
Stanford raised a total of $524 million
in contributions during the 2003-2004 fis
cal year, the second most successful year
in Stanford's fundraising history.
Last year's success was due in large
part to Charles Munger's $43.5 million
donation toward graduate student hous
ing — the largest housing donation any
one has given to Stanford.
But the figure also signals the Univer
sity's stability and prestige at a time when
philanthropy is becoming increasingly
important at both private and public uni
versities.

Burt McMurtry, Chairman of Stan
ford's Board of Trustees, said the success
of last year's fundraising campaign can
be attributed to the quality of the Uni
versity.
"Stanford faculty have ideas they can
present very well," McMurtry said. "And
in philanthropy, your job is to find things
which you can feel passionate about."
McMurtry said the Campaign for Un
dergraduate Education, which was de
veloped to raise $1 billion for undergrad
uate programs by the end of 2005, has yet
to reach its fundraising goals for certain
programs such as need-based financial
aid and overseas studies. Still, the cam
paign is slated to come to a conclusion in

Dec. 2005.
Thirty-nine percent of alumni donat
ed to the Stanford Fund or another facet
of undergraduate education, an increase
from the previous year's participation
rate of 38.4 percent.
"Every gift is important," said Martin
Shell, the associate vice president for de
velopment. "Alumni participation is a
sign of engagement. It's a little bit like
voting — people who make a gift indicate
they care about the University."
Though this year's alumni participa
tion rate nears fiscal year 2000's record of
40.1 percent. Shell says that there is room

for improvement.
"Forty percent is clearly better
than a few years ago, but we're not
satisfied with that," he said. "We
don't think it's reflective of the level
of engagement of alumni."
Of the total amount raised last
year, $209 million went into the
University endowment. The en
dowment increased by 18 percent,
putting it at slightly over $10 billion.
The average gift size for the
2003-2004 fiscal year was $4,760,
though 25 percent of those gifts fell
between $100 and $499.
The role of philanthropy
Stanford's fundraising success
this past year was second only to
Harvard's, according to Shell. He
attributed the University's lag be
hind Harvard to its relative youth
and its relatively new fundraising
efforts.
"There's not as rich a tradition
of philanthropy [at Stanford] as
there is at comparable East Coast
schools," he said.
