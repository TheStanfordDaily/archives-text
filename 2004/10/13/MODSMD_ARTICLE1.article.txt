# Large donation paves way for grad dorms
## Munger helps Univ. to near-record fundraising year

Stanford raised a total of $524 million
in contributions during the 2003-2004 fis
cal year, the second most successful year
in Stanford's fundraising history.
Last year's success was due in large
part to Charles Munger's $43.5 million
donation toward graduate student hous

one has given to Stanford.
But the figure also signals the Univer

in philanthropy, your job is to find things
which you can feel passionate about."
McMurtry said the Campaign for Un
dergraduate Education, which was de
veloped to raise $1 billion for undergrad
uate programs by the end of 2005, has yet
to reach its fundraising goals for certain
programs such as need-based financial
aid and overseas studies. Still, the cam
paign is slated to come to a conclusion in

Dec. 2005.

of undergraduate education, an increase
from the previous year's participation
rate of 38.4 percent.
"Every gift is important," said Martin
Shell, the associate vice president for de
velopment. "Alumni participation is a
sign of engagement. It's a little bit like
voting — people who make a gift indicate
they care about the University."
Though this year's alumni participa
tion rate nears fiscal year 2000's record of
40.1 percent. Shell says that there is room
