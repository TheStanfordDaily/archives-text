1969 — On Oct. 13, The Daily ran a
story on the University Hospital's
high abortion rate.
"At the rate of roughly 100 oper
ations per month. Stanford Univer
sity Hospital is performing more
therapeutic abortions than any
other hospital in the Bay Area.
The hospital's large staff of physi
cians accounts for high number of
abortions, according to Medical
Center News Director Spyros An
dreopoulos. In addition to the 150
physicians on the faculty and the 4(H)
community physicians allied with
the hospital, up to 1000 physicians
refer cases.
Hospitals are not required to re
port the numbers of abortion cases
to the State Department of Public
Health, but many do so voluntarily.
From these statistics, most of Cali
fornia's therapeutic abortions are
performed in the Bay Area —63%
for the first three quarters of 1%8.
the Stanford hospital performs
about 14% of the state's total.
The liberalized 1967 Therapeutic
Abortion Act authorizes legal abor
tion in cases of rape or incest, or
when 'there is substantial risk what
continuance of the pregnancy would
gravely impair the physical or men
tal health of the mother.' Of the
5,056 operations performed during
the first half of 1979,91 % have come
under the mental health section."
1983 — On Oct. 13, The Daily ran a
story on student controversy with the
Hoover Institution. Below is an ex
cerpt:
"Three student members of the
Trustee Committee on Academic
Affairs and Development

(TCAAD) have sent a letter to
William Kimball, president of the
Board of Trustees, requesting stu
dent and faculty representation on a
special committee investigating the
Hoover Institution's ties to the Uni
versity.
The trustees formed a committee
to investigate Hoover's ties to the
University at the recommendation
of the Faculty Senate after con
tentious debate last spring.
The student members of the
TCAAD want to change the com
mittee, which is a full committee, to
a standing committee, which would
necessarily have student and faculty
representatives.
ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) member Karol Watson, who
coauthored the letter with two mem
bers off the TCAAD. Nina Bohlen
and Eric Berg, said her experience
as ASSU observer of the TCAAD
has shown her that issues concerning
the Hoover Institution tend to get
'pushed back' into the full commit
tee.
'We believe this to be an unfortu
nate situation,' the letter reads,
'since the trustees are deprived of
whatever benefits result from partic
ipation of members of the student
body and faculty in your delibera
tions.
Therefore, we encourage the
Board to consider ways of changing
this situation. Possible alternatives
include naming student and faculty
members to the Committee on the
Hoover Institution, inviting them to
participate as observers, or having
the committee report to the lull
Board through one of the Standing
Committees.'"
