# Does this make me look fat?
## A 						million women at the Mall 
### ANNE FRIEDMAN FEATURES COLUMNIST 
I remember how she cried when
she told me she was pregnant. It's such
a cliched story, but it doesn't matter
how many times you've heard it be
fore when it happens to someone you
know. She was 16 and had a sweet
boyfriend, supportive parents, great
schooling and a broken condom.
On April 25, 2004 in Washington
D.C.. on my 21st birthday, 1 marched
for women's lives. I had always imag
ined spending this birthday with all my
best friends celebrating my newfound
legality. But when I found out that the
March for

Women's
Lives, the
largest march
for reproduc
tive freedom
in decades, fell
on the same
day. missing it
was never a
question.
I wanted to
be there, a
small part of
history, chant
ing "my bush.

" Anne Friedman

your bush, any bush but George
Bush" with all the other believers that
our bodies are our own to control.
I marched because, even with Roe
v. Wade in tact, only 13 percent of
counties in the US have abortion
providers. 1 marched because coat
hangers hold no meaning for women
of my generation. I marched because
the Bush administration is systemati
cally trespassing on a woman's right to
choose.
I marched because 1 don't want my
children to have to march for their re
productive rights. 1 marched because
I'm the only one who can make the
right decisions about my reproductive
future.
I marched because millions of
women are dying as a result of the
Global Gag Rule. I marched because
even more lives hang in the balance of
this election. And I marched for my
friend.
I marched because 1 thought
marching made a difference. How
could the voices of a million women
be ignored?
Apparently, all too easily.
I left energized, imagining the way
we were going to flood the polls come
that Tuesday in November. I imag
ined the reverberations of the march
shaking apathetic college students
into action. I imagined a housewife in
Nevada watching the evening news
and being awakened to the conse
quences of four more years of Bush's
tyranny. Right after I left, I turned on
the news to watch the coverage.
What coverage?
At the event, we were told that in
dependent researchers had estimated
the attendance as 1.15 million people,
making it the largest march in the his
tory of the United States, and most
likely, the entire world. Yet all main
stream media outlets reported the
turnout as between 250.000 and
500,000 people.
With over a million marchers and
maybe S,(XX) anti-abortion protesters,
we had 200 times the number of peo
ple, but CNN thought it "objective" to
give the marchers and the protesters
equal coverage time.
The next day. USA Today ran one
article on the march. It was smaller
than the article they ran on noise pol
lution caused by train whistles.
I've never been the typical, apa
thetic college student. I was raised in a
politically active environment and
have done my best to maintain that
enthusiasm. My experience at the
March for Women's Lives left me ex
cited about the possibility of changing
where this country is headed The fact
that a million women can be and were
ignored has left me jaded.
I spent my 21st birthday marching
because 1 thought it mattered. Now I
feel like I should have spent it with a
bottle mourning those who have al
ready fallen victim to Bush's war on
women.
Whatever my disappointment. I
won't let it keep me from the polls.
