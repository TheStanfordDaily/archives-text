# 'Deliberative polling'
## Communication prof says current polling methods are misleading, voters uneducated on issues 
### PAM SUD 
How did you feel 10 years ago
when the Public Affairs Act of
1975 was finally repealed? If you
consider yourself a staunch sup
porter or a vehement detractor of
the decision, you're one of the
many Americans who was duped
by a phony poll conducted by the
Washington Post in 1995.
Communication and Political
Science Prof. James Fishkin, who
recalled the example above in an
interview with The Daily, has
based much of his research on the
premise that we live in a world of
a largely uninformed electorate,
which can render the results of
public opinion polls misleading.
Often, he said, polls only rep
resent surface opinions based on
headlines or sound bites.
Fishkin is the director of the
Center for Deliberative Democ
racy, the only such center in the
United States. Fie has developed
a new type of polling to counter
the sometimes-deceptive aspects
of current polling practices.
In deliberative polling, or, as
Fishkin calls it,"a poll with a
human face," researchers bring
together a random sampling of

the electorate, ask their stance on
a set of issues, educate them
about these issues and then poll
them again.
"It's a social science experi
ment, it's a form of public consul
tation and it's a contribution to
the media dialogue," Fishkin said.
Fishkin said that his 35 delib
erative polling experiments
worldwide have shown that 60
percent of all responses change
significantly after deliberation.
"I'm not saying we should do
away with conventional polling,
because it gives a snapshot of
what the public is thinking,"
Fishkin said. "We look at what
the public would think [if better
informed]."
Fishkin described one deliber
ative polling experiment conduct
ed on the topic of foreign aid. Ini
tially. the majority of the sample
group were advocates of reducing
foreign aid expenditures in favor
of more spending on the home
front.
But only 18 percent of the par
ticipants knew that foreign aid
made up was less than 1 percent
of the national budget. After de
liberation. 64 percent were aware
that foreign aid was less than 1
percent of the budget, and the

majority were in favor of increas
ing foreign aid.
On Oct. 21, Jim Lehrer will
host "Time to Choose," a deliber
ative polling of 1,700 people in
seventeen cities across the coun
try on issues including national
security, the war in Iraq and the
economy.
The broadcast, to be aired on
PBS, is not intended to sway vot
ers in the upcoming election, but
merely to demonstrate how opin
ions shift as voters become more
knowledgeable, Fishkin said.
In addition to the face-to-face
deliberation experiments, there is
an online version of deliberative
polling that is currently being
moderated by Stanford graduate
students. The online deliberation
results will also be a part of the
PBS Broadcast.
"The most important thing I
have learned is that the public is
very smart if they have a chance
to focus on an issue and become
informed," Fishkin said.
"Our agenda for research is to
fine-tune the institutional designs
that will d(j this. Democracy can
be more than a dialogue of sound
bites and spin doctors if only we
work to make it better."

Communication and political science Prof. James Fishkin calls into question current methods of opinion polling with his deliberative polling experiments. In the experiments he conducts
around the world, Fishkin polls a group on a certain issue, educates them on the issue, and then polls them again. He has found that 60 percent of responses change.
