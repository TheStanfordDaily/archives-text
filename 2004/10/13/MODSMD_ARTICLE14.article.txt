# Stanford receives $25 mil from National Science Foundation for education research center

### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA 
After receiving nearly 50 proposal
applications fora new research cen
ter. the National Science Foundation
awarded a $25 million grant to he
shared between three institutions, in
cluding Stanford's Center for Innova
tions in Learning, an interdisciplinary
laboratory that conducts research to
study how people learn.
The other two institutions that will
be working with Stanford are the
University of Washington and SRI
International's Center for Technolo
gy in Learning, a non-profit research
organization based in Menlo Park.
Stanford will receive about $1.4 mil
lion a year for five years.
After spending nearly a year
working on a proposal, these three in
stitutions have collaborated to form

the Learning in Informal and Formal
Environments Center to encourage
collaboration between various
branches of education research.
In 2(X)2. the foundation approved
funding to support three science-of
learning centers, said Brigid Barron,
an assistant professor at the School of
Education, in an e-mail. After the
five-year span, the grant for the cen
ter will be renewable for another five
years.
Barron, who is one of three co-di
rectors of the center, told The Daily
she is excited about the implications
the project could have on both theo
retical and practical education.
"Our ultimate goal is to transform
the science of learning to integrate
knowledge from different disciplines,
including neuroscience, cognitive
psychology and socio-cultural knowl

edge, towards improving learning for
people from infancy to adulthood,"
she said.
She said that the center is the first
to combine these three strands of re
search and methodology, which she
believes can work together to form a
better understanding of learning.
She said she hopes that the cen
ter's research findings will be used
in schools, museums and •various
industries.
Education Prof. Roy Pea. another
co-director of the center, said he will
be working on the center's Educa
tion, Collaboration and Outreach
program.
"We will collaborate with the
community of research scientists, en
gineers and designers outside the
center to use the center's human and
technological resources, and culti

vate strong and lasting partnerships
with formal and informal education
institutes, schools, and professional
communities involved in science,
mathematics, technology, and learn
ing research."
Pea said that there are already 29
projects planned for the center's first
year. The projects will be both inter
disciplinary and inter-institutional, as
Stanford researchers will collaborate
with researchers from the University
of Washington and SRI.
One such project will study the
learning of mathematics within the
family setting—attempting to under
stand how children come to learn
math outside of the classroom in in
formal settings, such as grocery shop
ping. Another will explore students'
informal learning through technolo
gy, such as television, video games or

the Internet.
Pea said that the research team
consists of faculty, postdoctoral
scholars and graduate and under
graduate students.
Several professors involved with
the center said they hope that their
work will have powerful applications
for education, training and other is
sues of social importance.
"Within 10 years, our vision is to
have played a catalytic role in estab
lishing a transformed "sciences of
learning' that combines bio-cultural,
psycho-cultural and socio cultural
theories and methodologies with
studies of media and technology to
provide a solid foundation for ad
vancing processes of learning and de
velopment in ways responsive to the
changing demands of work and life,"
Barron said.
