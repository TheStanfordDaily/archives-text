## Editorials Stanford should reinstitute the Mausoleum party on Halloween 
### 
Students arrive on campus having heard about
the legendary Mausoleum Party that is held
every Halloween in the final resting place of
Stanford's founders. However, many students
are disappointed to find out that the event was can
celled in the fall of 2(H)2.
Much like lull Moon on the Quad, the Mausoleum
party is a beloved Stanford tradition. Student govern
ment should revive it in time for this year's Halloween.
The Mausoleum Party is showcased as one of the
main autumn quarter events on the Stanford Website
under the section of introduction to student life on
campus. The description of the party reads. "Perhaps
a bit macabre (hut always in good fun), the annual
1 lalloween Mausoleum Party takes place at the site of
the Stanford family crypt."
This is what the party may have been like, but for
the past two years, there have been no such festivities.
The event, along with Full Moon on the Quad, used to
be funded by the Stanford Alumni Association.
The Alumni Association stopped funding both
events two years ago when it decided they were not
worth the cost.
This means that someone else has to foot the bill
for both parties to happen. Last year's senior class
picked up the tab for Full Moon on the Quad, and Ab
solute Fun is picking up the tab for that event this
year. But so far, no one has stepped up to take charge
of the Mausoleum Party.
The I Jniversity would seem to have a vested inter
est in having a party on campus on 1 lalloween to pro

vide an outlet of entertainment for students. As it is
now, hordes of students instead have to go off campus
to Castro Street in San Francisco, which could poten
tially lead to greater safety risks.
Although the Absolute Fun committee considered
sponsoring the Mausoleum Party this year, it ulti
mately decided not to because it is already in charge
of Full Moon on the Quad, which is four days before
1 lalloween this year. The committee's head said that
it would be too much work to plan both events for the
people on the committee.
But. Absolute Fun could still foot the bill for the
event, because it receives $50.(KK) a year to plan fun
activities the entire student body will enjoy. Instead of
funding poorly attended and costly events like the
Block Party last fall, the committee should coordinate
its efforts into lunding events that will have a better
chance at being popular, such as the already well
known Mausoleum Party.
Even if the committee is too busy with Full Moon
on the Quad to plan the Mausoleum Party, it should at
least set up another committee to lead the coordina
tion of that party and provide it with a share of its
funds to do an adequate job.
If the ASSU fails to host the party, perhaps some
other group could step forward to save the tradition.
For Stanford to claim the Mausoleum Party as a tra
dition. the party has to actually exist. If this does not
happen this year. Stanford alumni and students may
have to accept that this tradition is as dead as Leland
Stanford himself.
