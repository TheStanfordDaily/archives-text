# Early admission policy a success

### 
Recently, the National Association for Col
lege Admission Counseling, an organiza
tion of college admissions officers and col
lege counselors, voted to permit single
choice early action admission policies because Stan
ford. 1 larvald and Yale were in violation of its rules.
Because of the changes to the early admission policy,
Stanford's early applicant pool went up by 60 per
cent. and students were not locked in by contracts
committing them to attend Stanford.
Because Stanford and its applicants benefit from
the new early admissions policy, Stanford made the
right decision in standing up to NACAC's restriction.
Under the old policy, students could apply early
to Stanford, but they had to commit to attending in

the financial aid package before making a decision.
Research has demonstrated that many of ihese stu

Because early admission is non-binding, students
can now compare Stanford's financial aid package to
those at other schools.
Although Stanford violated NACAC's rules at
the time of its decision, the admissions department
honored the original intent of early admissions - to
assist students who have identified their first choice
of schools. Under the new policy, students still bene
fit from advance knowledge about whether they
have been admitted with none of the drawbacks.
Selecting a college can be an agonizing decision.
With an ever-more-competitive applicant pool, at
least Stanford has the decency to accommodate stu
dents with a non-binding early admissions policy.
Other schools that still have binding early decision
policies would be wise to follow suit.
