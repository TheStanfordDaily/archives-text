Construction of the $100-mil
lion, 600-occupant Munger
Graduate Residences is expect
ed to begin next summer. The
project is being funded by an un
precedented donation of $43.5
million from Charles T. Munger,
a prominent lawyer and busi
nessman whose wife, Nancy, is a
Stanford alumna and former
member of the Board of
Trustees.
The two-year project, which
will occupy six acres of Universi
ty land, will displace buildings on
Salvatierra Walk, potentially re
locating them across from Bech
tel International Center, and will
temporarily create a giant hole in
the ground where the buildings
are currently located.
The primary buildings target
ed for relocation are Rogers
House — home of the Bridge
counseling center and other stu
dent activities — and Owen
House, which is currently occu
pied by administrative facilities.
The campus bike store will be re
built elsewehere.
Due to their historic nature,
Rogers and Owen will be moved
to another campus location
rather than destroyed. The
move, and the project's larger
impact on campus life, has some
students and University employ
ees concerned.
"For us to grow as a Universi
ty, we have to provide the hous
ing," said Chris Christofferson,
associate vice provost for facili-
ties. He noted that according to
Stanford's General Use Plan with
Santa Clara County, the construc
tion of new academic space must be
accompanied by new housing.
"This is something that the coun
ty wants," he said. "They don't want
students commuting to campus."
Christofferson estimated that the
University provides housing for 65
percent of its graduate students and
said that the Munger residences will
move Stanford toward its goal of
housing 80 percent.
"At this point, the plans are pre
liminary," cautioned Gordon Earle,
vice president for public affairs. He
acknowledged that one likely solu
tion would be relocating houses to
near the Bechtel International Cen
ter. "If the houses are moved across
from Bechtel, we'll try to create a
feeling similar to what exists today
at Salvatierra Walk."
Earle emphasized that the Uni
versity has been working to address
the concerns of community mem
bers who could be impacted.
"Over the last two weeks, we've

been very aggressive about contact
ing everyone affected," he said.
"We've talked to homeowners, resi
dent fellows, resident advisors, any
one living and working in the imme
diate area."
The Career Development Cen
ter is located on Salvatierra Walk,
but is not expected to move. CDC
Director Lance Choy said he has
met with administrators to discuss a
wide range of issues related to the
project, but he acknowledged that
he still had many concerns.
"The details aren't fully out yet,
but we're wondering how that's
going to impact parking," he said.
"We have employers who come to
recruit here and they need to know
how accessible they're going to be
[when there is construction]."
Choy noted that the Student Dis
ability Resource Center is located
below the CDC. and "there are peo
ple who are vision-impaired and
they're wondering how the con
struction will affect all that."
The new buildings will eliminate
150 existing parking spaces, but, ac-

Univ. aims to minimize
negative impact from dorm

cording to Christofferson, the first
structures built will be underground
parking garages with capacity for
750 cars. To address traffic con
cerns. Campus Drive near Mayfield
will also be expanded from two to
four lanes.
Munger, the donor, is the vice
chairman of Berkshire Hathaway
and the founder of the law firm
Munger, Tolles & Olson.
"Charlie Munger is in many ways
a visionary," said Martin Shell, asso
ciate vice president of development.
"He clearly believes housing is one
of the most unappreciated facets of
university life."
According to Shell, Munger
worked with University President
John Hennessey and former Law
School Dean Kathleen Sullivan to
develop the project.
"Munger saw an opportunity to
provide Stanford with an unbeliev
able asset to improve living and
learning," Shell said. "We are now
creating a living environment that
allows the learning environment
we're trying to foster to continue."
