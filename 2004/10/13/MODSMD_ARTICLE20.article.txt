## Stanford should disclose investments 
### ANNA MUMFORD 
Yesterday the Stanford Coali
tion for Investment Disclosure sent
a letter to the Stanford Manage
ment Company, which is the group
at Stanford responsible for manag
ing our endowment.
We asked the Stanford Manage
ment Company to begin a dialogue
ab< >ut the ethical issues that are consid
ered when investing our endowment.
In order to enable all members of the
Stanford community to engage in this
dialogue with informed opinions, we
asked that a list of all investment man
agers that Stanford uses to manage our
endowment be made public.
In addition, we asked that Stanford
Management Company release any
information provided to it by the in
vestment managers about the compa
nies in which they invest, provided that
the investment managers agree not to
expel or sue Stanford for doing so.
This discussion is critical now
when the world is in the midst of cre
ating a global economy. There is a vi
sion of globalization that promotes a
worldwide free market without re
gard to the effects on people and
communities around the world.
We have a vision of globalization in
which Stanford's investments not only
enrich our institution but also have
positive - rat her than negative - effects
on the communities and countries in
which our endowment is invested.
There are three factors that moti
vate us to act at this time. First, uni
versities in general, and our univer
sity in particular, have become
major financial players.
Last year, according to the Nation
al Association of Colleges and Univer
sity Business Officers, there were 87
university endowments that exceeded
$500 million. Our school's endowment
is $12.2 billion.
With this much capital to invest, our
school's investments can and some
times do have profound effects on
communities throughout the world.
Second, our university has in
vested a portion of the endowment
with Farallon Capital Management,
the world's fourth-largest hedge
fund, which has been involved in
some controversial investments that
had negative social and environ
mental implications.
For example, Farallon invested a
university's money in Baca Ranch in
an attempt to sell the water from an
aquifer below Colorado's Great Sand
Dunes National Monument, and the
investment could have destroyed the

unique ecosystem of the dunes.
See http://www.unfarallon.info for
more on this and other investments.
Third, universities provide a
moral compass for all of society.
Stanford has the opportunity to
show leadership in the area of ethi
cal investing by beginning a dia
logue with us, its stakeholders,
about what kinds of investments are
appropriate for our community.
In the 1980s, Stanford students
took a lead in the campaign to divest
from South Africa in an effort to end
apartheid. In the 19905, students
fought for divestment from tobacco
companies and companies that bene
fited from forced labor in Burma.
Today, we continue to fight to in
sure that our university's investments
have a positive rather than negative
affect on communities around the
globe.
The South African divestment cam
paign and other responsible invest
ment campaigns were based on knowl
edge of Stanford's investment activi
ties. When Stanford's investments are
hidden from view, we cannot even
begin to consider their impacts.
There is no greater value in
academia than the free exchange of
ideas. It is only when there is an open
discussion on campus about ethical
investing that we will, as a communi
ty of students and scholars, come to a
consensus about how our endow
ment should be invested.
Unfortunately, hedge funds such
as Farallon, in which Stanford invests,
are known for their secrecy. If a hedge
fund is going to invest our large en
dowment. it must come to terms with
the needs of yur community which in
clude not only the need to gain high re
turns, but also a sufficient degree of
transparency to ensure the ethical
foundation of such investments.
Our university can. and we be
lieve must, become a leader by en
gaging all members of our commu
nity in a discussion about how our
university invests, and by providing
us with the information necessary to
make informed decisions.
We can show other universities
that there is an alternative vision of
globalization in which it is possible
to make money, build a university
community and have a positive im
pact on the world through our in
vestments.

nies in which they invest, provided that
the investment managers agree not to
expel or sue Stanford for doing so.
This discussion is critical now
when the world is in the midst of cre
ating a global economy. There is a vi
sion of globalization that promotes a
worldwide free market without re
gard to the effects on people and
communities around the world.
We have a vision of globalization in
which Stanford's investments not only
enrich our institution but also have
positive - rat her than negative - effects
on the communities and countries in
which our endowment is invested.
There are three factors that moti
vate us to act at this time. First, uni
versities in general, and our univer
sity in particular, have become
major financial players.
Last year, according to the Nation
al Association of Colleges and Univer
sity Business Officers, there were 87
university endowments that exceeded
$500 million. Our school's endowment
is $12.2 billion.
With this much capital to invest, our
school's investments can and some
times do have profound effects on
communities throughout the world.
Second, our university has in
vested a portion of the endowment
with Farallon Capital Management,
the world's fourth-largest hedge
fund, which has been involved in
some controversial investments that
had negative social and environ
mental implications.
For example, Farallon invested a
university's money in Baca Ranch in
an attempt to sell the water from an
aquifer below Colorado's Great Sand
Dunes National Monument, and the
investment could have destroyed the

unique ecosystem of the dunes.
See http://www.unfarallon.info for
more on this and other investments.
Third, universities provide a
moral compass for all of society.
Stanford has the opportunity to
show leadership in the area of ethi
cal investing by beginning a dia
logue with us, its stakeholders,
about what kinds of investments are
appropriate for our community.
In the 1980s, Stanford students
took a lead in the campaign to divest
from South Africa in an effort to end
apartheid. In the 19905, students
fought for divestment from tobacco
companies and companies that bene
fited from forced labor in Burma.
Today, we continue to fight to in
sure that our university's investments
have a positive rather than negative
affect on communities around the
globe.
The South African divestment cam
paign and other responsible invest
ment campaigns were based on knowl
edge of Stanford's investment activi
ties. When Stanford's investments are
hidden from view, we cannot even
begin to consider their impacts.
There is no greater value in
academia than the free exchange of
ideas. It is only when there is an open
discussion on campus about ethical
investing that we will, as a communi
ty of students and scholars, come to a
consensus about how our endow
ment should be invested.
Unfortunately, hedge funds such
as Farallon, in which Stanford invests,
are known for their secrecy. If a hedge
fund is going to invest our large en
dowment. it must come to terms with
the needs of yur community which in
clude not only the need to gain high re
turns, but also a sufficient degree of
transparency to ensure the ethical
foundation of such investments.
Our university can. and we be
lieve must, become a leader by en
gaging all members of our commu
nity in a discussion about how our
university invests, and by providing
us with the information necessary to
make informed decisions.
We can show other universities
that there is an alternative vision of
globalization in which it is possible
to make money, build a university
community and have a positive im
pact on the world through our in
vestments.
