## Right in the Babymaker IM rules protect the weak, who shouldn't be playing anyway 
### 
Dear Ted Leland: You're probably not
in charge of this, but I don't know to
whom this can be addressed. The
grievous refusal to change University policies
has gone too far, and I would consider myself
remiss if I let one more day pass before venting
my rage at the injustice committed within our

fine institution.
I'm talking, of course,
about intramural sports.
IMs are a part of us. They
provide us with diversions on
the weekends, with a reason
to get up before 4 p.m. on Sat
urdays, and with a competi
tive outlet to prevent us from
beating our children or signif
icant others. Thev brine

dorms and houses together and teach a valu
able lesson for your post-college life: specifical
ly, that throwing a ball at someone will make
you infinitely cooler than your GPA ever
could.
So why do they suck so much in their current
state?
We can address this problem first by dealing
with the sports we have. Standards like football
and basketball are good the way they are, but
others need to be changed — dodgeball, for
example.
The simple pleasure of hitting another person
in the face with a ball is not to be underestimated.
Why, then, is the thrower out if a thrown ball
strikes an opposing player's head? We're not in
third grade anymore, and if someone gets hurt
playing IM dodgeball, it's likely his own fault.
Nobody is forcing you to come play, so if
you come, either have the requisite reflexes to
avoid getting hit in the face (a skill that, while
taxing, can be accomplished by most monkeys
and some dolphins) or wear some form of pro
tective eyewear so that the other players can
more easily identify you as a weakling who can
be separated from the herd and struck down.
Of course, this rule can be circumvented by
a pre-game conference between team captains.
Typically, the structure of this agreement last
year went like this: 1) Suggest that hitting in the
head be legal. 2) Listen to opponents' reasons
why their players should not be hit in the head.
3) Build an insurmountable lead and hit oppo
nents in the head anyway.
As in the world outside Ford Center, the
strong will have their way, regardless of the
rules.
Secondarily, your introduction of kickball
last year was a major step in the right direction.
However, the use of a ball two feet in diameter
is troubling. This makes any ball deep in the
outfield capable of scoring a runner from first,
since hitting the cutoff man with a ball that size
is more difficult than beating Bartolo Colon in
a pie-eating contest. We should just use the
same red balls we used in elementary school for
handball, soccer and abusing children in lower
grades.
Finally, I have great respect for people that
selflessly give their time to officiate intramural
sports.
Wait, no 1 don't — I respect correct calls. I
still have Vietnam-style flashbacks about the
day last year when a close play — and by using
the word 'close,' I'm being generous; the run
ner beat the ball to the bag by more time than
it's taken you to realize that Buddy Teevens is
a poor football coach — went against our in
tramural softball team. The umpire was busy
not moving from behind the plate when the
play occurred.

What frosts itic more than anything, though, is that
I have to ask for every call, wait for the umpire to give
me a terrified expression, and then listen to him deliv
er his decision in a voice so meek it would make a li
brarian sound like Henry Rollins.
Please, provide us with referees that want to be
there, that know the rules (I had to explain the infield
tly rule two or three times to the officials last year), and
that arc forceful. A wrong call, if made loudly, is a lot
more believable than a whispered blown call.
I fully realize that when I play intramural sports, 1

Refs should know
the game at least

probably take them too seriously. Yes, I have been
called "intimidating" and "too competitive." Yes, I
take pleasure in ruthlessly crushing hapless opponents.
Yes, I'm one blown circuit away from a full-on "Falling
Down" meltdown.
That is all.
