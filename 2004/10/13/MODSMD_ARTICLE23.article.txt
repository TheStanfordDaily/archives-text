# Tomorrow's Tigers visit Farm
## 
### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
Last Saturday morning, while much of the Stanford
campus was recovering from the previous night's festivi
ties, the men's and women's golf teams were reaching out
to a nearby community in a hig way.
What got them out of bed bright and early on a sunny
weekend? Almost 40 students from the Moonridge and
Main Street schools in Half Moon Bay arrived at the Stan
ford Driving Range to receive instruction, encourage
ment, and most importantly inspiration from players and
coaches at Tiger Woods' old stomping ground.

The K-through-6 schools serve the children of the low
income Moonridge and Main Street housing develop
ments in San Mateo. Designed as affordable housing for
agricultural workers, the developments also work in con
junction with the Peninsula Family YMCA to provide op
portunities for the underprivileged and largely bilingual
youth in the area.
The story of how these young chippers and putters ar
rived at the Stanford driving range, however, begins with
Wayne Southerland.
"[The children] live across the street from two of the
best-looking golf courses in the world," Southerland said
of his young charges. "Until somebody opens up a door

for them, they don't know what's over there."
In May of this year, while helping to organize the
Half Moon Bay Chamber of Commerce Artichoke Golf
Classic, Southerland saw an opportunity to benefit
those who could not afford the nearly $200 entry fee for
the tournament.
Coordinating with Susan Sanchez of Mid-Peninsula
Housing Corporation and Kristen Flores of the YMCA,
Southerland orchestrated a youth golf clinic prior to the
main event. Two-time U.S. Open winner and ESPN golf

analyst Andy North, on hand as part of the tournament
itself, provided the instruction. Twenty-six juniors from
Moonridge and Main Street participated in the clinic,
and buoyed by the success. Southerland began looking
for another venue fora similar youth event.
"Wayne called me about my first or second week
on the job," said Stanford men s coach Conrad Kay.
"I think it's easy to take for granted how great we
have it here at Stanford, so to be able to help these
kids out and introduce them to a wonderful game
that will teach them about themselves and about life
is a great opportunity."
Arriving in two busloads around 9:45 a.m., the chil
dren separated into three groups to rotate through
drills on chipping, putting and the full swing.
In smaller groups of about six, they received in
struction from male and female golfers, as well as from
Kay and women's coach Caroline O'Connor.
Against the backdrop of a sign reading, "Welcome
Half Moon Bay Kids!" smiles even bigger than their
swings graced the children's faces.
While some learned the fundamentals of putting
setup from sophomore Jenna Seki, the team of senior
Wendra Liang and freshman Teddy Collins watched
over a group working on their chipping skills.

On the practice tee, a cadre from the men's team
hammed it up with their pupils as they swung for the
fences.
"(The Stanford players) really put their hearts into
this." said Southerland's wife, Alison. "You can tell
that they're doing this out of a love for their sport and
for these kids."
Maria Camarena was also quite happy with the
event; she has two boys, Carlos and Lalo, and a girl,
Jacqueline in the program.
With the YMCA's Mores interpreting, Camarena
said, "|Mv children) are really interested in golf and
want to pursue it. [TheyJ woke up extra early this
morning and were very excited about participating."
Sanchez also praised the teams for their willingness
to give up some of their time.
"This event gives [the children] more experience
and lets them see that there's a whole other world out
there," Sanchez said.
The next item on Southerland's agenda? A trip to
Laird Small's golf academy at Pebble Beach.
"I want people to know that there is a future, and it
isn't as bleak as everyone makes it out to be," Souther
land said.

Clinic offers kids
chance to play

On the practice tee, a cadre from the men's team
hammed it up with their pupils as they swung for the
fences.
"(The Stanford players) really put their hearts into
this." said Southerland's wife, Alison. "You can tell
that they're doing this out of a love for their sport and
for these kids."
Maria Camarena was also quite happy with the
event; she has two boys, Carlos and Lalo, and a girl,
Jacqueline in the program.
With the YMCA's Mores interpreting, Camarena
said, "|Mv children) are really interested in golf and
want to pursue it. [TheyJ woke up extra early this
morning and were very excited about participating."
Sanchez also praised the teams for their willingness
to give up some of their time.
"This event gives [the children] more experience
and lets them see that there's a whole other world out
there," Sanchez said.
The next item on Southerland's agenda? A trip to
Laird Small's golf academy at Pebble Beach.
"I want people to know that there is a future, and it
isn't as bleak as everyone makes it out to be," Souther
land said.
"These kids are our future."
