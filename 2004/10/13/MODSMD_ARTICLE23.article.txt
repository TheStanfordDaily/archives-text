# Tomorrow's Tigers visit Farm
## 
### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
Last Saturday morning, while much of the Stanford
campus was recovering from the previous night's festivi
ties, the men's and women's golf teams were reaching out
to a nearby community in a hig way.
What got them out of bed bright and early on a sunny
weekend? Almost 40 students from the Moonridge and
Main Street schools in Half Moon Bay arrived at the Stan
ford Driving Range to receive instruction, encourage
ment, and most importantly inspiration from players and
coaches at Tiger Woods' old stomping ground.

The K-through-6 schools serve the children of the low
income Moonridge and Main Street housing develop
ments in San Mateo. Designed as affordable housing for
agricultural workers, the developments also work in con
junction with the Peninsula Family YMCA to provide op
portunities for the underprivileged and largely bilingual
youth in the area.
The story of how these young chippers and putters ar
rived at the Stanford driving range, however, begins with
Wayne Southerland.
"[The children] live across the street from two of the
best-looking golf courses in the world," Southerland said
of his young charges. "Until somebody opens up a door

for them, they don't know what's over there."
In May of this year, while helping to organize the
Half Moon Bay Chamber of Commerce Artichoke Golf
Classic, Southerland saw an opportunity to benefit
those who could not afford the nearly $200 entry fee for
the tournament.
Coordinating with Susan Sanchez of Mid-Peninsula
Housing Corporation and Kristen Flores of the YMCA,
Southerland orchestrated a youth golf clinic prior to the
main event. Two-time U.S. Open winner and ESPN golf
