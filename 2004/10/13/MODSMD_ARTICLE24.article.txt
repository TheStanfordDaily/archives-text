The Golden Bears out-gained the Trojans, 424 yards to 205,
but still could not come away with a victory in Los Angeles. USC

vantage of good field position to execute short scoring drives of
one, 31,37,50 and 66 yards. Cal (3-1,1-1) committed three key
turnovers, while the Trojans made just one.

52 yards and caught a touchdown, Reggie Bush took an 84-yard
kick return all the way to the Cal one-yard line, and Ryan Killen

The Golden Bears reached first-and-goal from the USC
nine-yard line with less than two minutes remaining, but their
bid to beat the defending national champions for the second
year in a row fell short when Rodgers threw three incompletions
in three attempts after connecting on 29 of his first 31 throws.
