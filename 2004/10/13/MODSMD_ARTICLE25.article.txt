# Top-ranked Cardinal women out after second round in All-American
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
Last week, five members of the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team headed to the Riviera /ITA
Women's All-American Championships, unsure of
their chances but unfazed after sweeping NCAAs last
season.
With a "wait and see" mantra on their brains, the
Cardinal waited and watched as their own competitors
quickly fell out of the tournament fray, until no Stan
ford player was left after the second round of the main
draw.
That was Friday, as Stanford's Erin Burdette (1-1),
a senior, and sophomore Theresa Logar (1-1) were
both defeated in straight sets. Burdette was ousted by
top-seeded Cristelle Grier (4-1) of Northwestern,
while Logar fell to former teammate Story Tweedie-
Yates (2-1), now a senior at Texas Christian.
The Cardinal was not among the top eight finishers
at All-American and will not be present at the ITA Na
tional Indoor Tournament, held at Michigan in
November.
On Sunday, Stanford had already returned to the
Farm as three unseeded, unranked freshmen laid their
own claim to fame at the Pacific Palisades, Calif., tour
nament. Northwestern's Audra Cohen nabbed the All-
American singles title and Florida's Whitney Benik
and Lolita Frangulyan dominated in doubles.

These triumphs, not only unexpected but highly un
likely, rang true to the nature of every season-opener
in collegiate tennis: you always want to win, hut a first
impression isn't everything.
Pacific-10 Conference play for the Cardinal doesn't
begin until January, and the nail-biting over NCAAs
kicks in months after that.
That said, Stanford takes its early exit at All-Amer
ican with a hint of disappointment and an enduring
pledge to keep practicing.
"All in all, it was not a classic Stanford tournament,"
said junior Alice Barnes (0-1), who lost in the opening
round. "In the past, [our losses] haven't stood out quite
so much; someone always happened to do well. This
time, none of us were match and you could definitely
see it."
No. 6 Barnes referred to No. 17 Burdette's showing
at last year's All-American final, where now-graduat
ed Raquel Kops-Jones of California dispatched of an
exhausted Burdette, 6-3, 6-2. In the semifinals, Bur
dette had pulled out a tough three-set win, 6-3,3-6,6-3,
over Georgia's Agata Cioroch, then a senior ranked
No. 1 in the nation.
In this year's final, Cohen shut out her Wildcats
teammate Cristelle Grier, a sophomore who earned a
No. 1 rank in the preseason. The 7-6(2), 6-2 showdown
already marks the second time Cohen has handed
Grier a loss.
Boasting a 15-0 record. Cohen racked up the bulk of

her collegiate tennis experience in the past week, win
ning 12 matches since last Monday. Because of her un
seeded status, Cohen had to outlast both pre-qualify
ing and qualifying rounds of play before making it to
the main draw.
By comparison, the Cardinal's entrants at All-
American had previous experience and acclaim that
launched them into the qualifying round or higher.
With Burdette's showing at last year's All-Ameri
can and Barnes's nearly flawless 2004 record — she
dropped only one match in the regular season — both
were automatic qualifiers into the main draw.
Burdette succumed to Grier in the second round. 6-
4, 6-2. while Barnes, who was seeded fifth in the tour
nament, fumbled in the first round against Mississippi's
Chloe Carlotti, 6-4, 6-2.
No. 26 Logar. who claimed her first tournament title
at the Freeman Memorial Championships in Las Vegas
last January, also received a berth into the main draw.
She defeated Duke's Jackie Carleton, 6-4, 6-4, before
falling to the Horned Frogs' Tweedie-Yates, 6-3,6-2.
No. 59 Tweedie-Yates, who dropped a three-setter
in the quarterfinal against Florida's No. 47 Zerene
Reyes (3-1), 1 -6,7-6(3), 6-4, played for the Cardinal for
the first three years of her career.
Barnes stepped in and asserted that, despite the po
tential for controversy due to Tweedie-Yates having
previously played with the Cardinal team, the match
between Tweedie-Yates and Logar went off without a

hitch.
"Theresa only knew her fora year, and Story wasn't
really around then," Barnes said. "[Story] didn't leave
with any bad blood; everyone just understood that she
had moved on."
"I don't mean to say that Theresa's a better player
than Story, but that's what I believe," Barnes added.
Even without current results to show for it, the Car
dinal have a championship reputation not easily set
aside. Add up 13 NCAA titles and 17 straight years of
coming out on top in the Pac-10's, and Stanford will
stay the steady course it has set up for itself.
Freshman Whitney Deason, who experienced her
first loss in doubles with Anne Yelsey, a sophomore,
against Georgia Tech's Kristi Miller and Alison Silve
rio, 8-6, will stay the course.
Barnes, who received a bye in the first round of con
solation singles play only to lose in the next, will stay
the course.
Together, Barnes and Burdette, who have yet to
perfect their doubles strategy but who won the Pac-10
Regional Championships last year after playing to
gether for the first time, will stay the course. The pair
was eliminated in the final qualifying round by Benik
and Frangulyan, 8-2.
As a result, "out of sight, out of mind" might be the
next best strategy for the Card as they prepare for the
Stanford-hosted ITA Northwest Regional Tourna
ment. held later this month.
