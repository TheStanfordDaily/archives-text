# Scientists debate stem cell research and Prop. 71
## 
### ELAINE CHOI 
With the death of stem cell
research advocate and actor
Christopher Reeve two days
ago and a new California
proposition on the ballot that
deals with the issue, stem cell
research is back in the political
spotlight this election season.
Assoc. Prof, in human biol
ogy William Hurlbut, a mem

ber of the President's Council
on Bioethics, and Lawrence
Goldstein, the chief scientist
for Calif. Proposition 71,
weighed the merits of stem cell
research during a talk last
night.
The federal government
currently does not fund re
search on embryonic cells.
Proposition 71 would provide
$3 billion of state funding for

embryonic stem cell research
in California. Stanford would
receive some of that funding.
"If Proposition 71 is ap
proved and passed, there will
be a huge increase in funding
for research at Stanford,"
Hurlburt said. "I would expect
$300 million to half a billion
dollars out of this proposition
to Stanford."
Hurlburt also discussed his

own position in the stem cell
research debate. While he
teaches at Stanford, a global
leader in stem cell research, he
also works for President
George W. Bush, whose views
do not align with the Universi
ty's.
"It has led to many good dis
cussions with people, but I
have also taken a little heat for
it,"he said.

Goldstein said the scientific
reasoning behind stem cell re
search promotion includes the
need for basic and applied re
search. Addressing the idea of
using animal stem cells instead
of human ones, he noted that
animal and human cells do not
always behave in the same
manner.
