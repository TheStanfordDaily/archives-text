# Scientists debate stem cell research and Prop. 71
## 
### ELAINE CHOI 
With the death of stem cell
research advocate and actor
Christopher Reeve two days
ago and a new California
proposition on the ballot that
deals with the issue, stem cell
research is back in the political
spotlight this election season.
Assoc. Prof, in human biol
ogy William Hurlbut, a mem

ber of the President's Council
on Bioethics, and Lawrence
Goldstein, the chief scientist
for Calif. Proposition 71,
weighed the merits of stem cell
research during a talk last
night.
The federal government
currently does not fund re
search on embryonic cells.
Proposition 71 would provide
$3 billion of state funding for

embryonic stem cell research
in California. Stanford would
receive some of that funding.
"If Proposition 71 is ap
proved and passed, there will
be a huge increase in funding
for research at Stanford,"
Hurlburt said. "I would expect
$300 million to half a billion
dollars out of this proposition
to Stanford."
Hurlburt also discussed his

own position in the stem cell
research debate. While he
teaches at Stanford, a global
leader in stem cell research, he
also works for President
George W. Bush, whose views
do not align with the Universi
ty's.
"It has led to many good dis
cussions with people, but I
have also taken a little heat for
it,"he said.

Goldstein said the scientific
reasoning behind stem cell re
search promotion includes the
need for basic and applied re
search. Addressing the idea of
using animal stem cells instead
of human ones, he noted that
animal and human cells do not
always behave in the same
manner.
Hurlbut emphasized the diverse
challenges presented by the issue
and cautioned the audience not to
oversimplify its thinking on it.
"We must recognize that there is
not one narrow-minded religious
view against stem cell research,"
Hurlbut said. "There are multi
faceted objections. The issue is not
pure religion, ideology or the impo
sition of a religious right."
"Stem cell research is a species
issue," he continued. "And I'm
sorry about the politicization of the
issue. It has spawned hype and half
truths. No sides are fooled in this de
bate. Both sides defend important
human goals."
The two men's views diverged
somewhat when it came to the ethics
of embryonic stem cell research.
Hurlbut admitted that adult
stem cells cannot do everything em
bryonic stem calls can, but he also
explained the serious moral issues
surrounding stem cell research.

He described human life as pos
sessing potential and continuity
and said that the embryo is a dy
namic process and not a static
structure.
"Embryos contain an organiza
tion principle of a full human organ
ism." he said. "From conception, the
human embryo has an engaged po
tential and process."
Goldstein explained that pub
licly funded research of human stem
cells is essential. One of the reasons,
he said, was"the sunshine or ethical
oversight."
When the public is part of the
funding of research, the research
tends to be more regulatory and
more knowledge is accessible to
the public.
Other reasons he cited were fi
nancial limits in the private sector
and his belief that many of the best
scientists are in the public research
institutes.
"Research is tremendously im-

Embryonic stem cell
research at heart of issue

portant for improved health care
and for its social returns," Goldstein
said. "There is also financial benefit
to the state from research through
patents, licenses and direct ways like
economic stimulation and improved
healthcare."
Hurlbut refused to draw the bot
tom line at the potential social and
scientific advantages of stem cell re
search.
"A moral objection can trump
science," he said. "If there are not
good ethics, then there is not good
science."
In California, at least, the law
falls on the side of those who favor
embryonic research.
"The political debate over stem
cell research in California is over be
cause human embryonic research is
legal in California," Goldstein said.
"There is also apparently strong
popular support for the research in
California."

of embryonic stem cell research.
Hurlbut admitted that adult
stem cells cannot do everything em
bryonic stem calls can, but he also
explained the serious moral issues
surrounding stem cell research.

He described human life as pos
sessing potential and continuity
and said that the embryo is a dy
namic process and not a static
structure.
"Embryos contain an organiza
tion principle of a full human organ
ism." he said. "From conception, the
human embryo has an engaged po
tential and process."
Goldstein explained that pub
licly funded research of human stem
cells is essential. One of the reasons,
he said, was"the sunshine or ethical
oversight."
When the public is part of the
funding of research, the research
tends to be more regulatory and
more knowledge is accessible to
the public.
Other reasons he cited were fi
nancial limits in the private sector
and his belief that many of the best
scientists are in the public research
institutes.
"Research is tremendously im-

portant for improved health care
and for its social returns," Goldstein
said. "There is also financial benefit
to the state from research through
patents, licenses and direct ways like
economic stimulation and improved
healthcare."
Hurlbut refused to draw the bot
tom line at the potential social and
scientific advantages of stem cell re
search.
"A moral objection can trump
science," he said. "If there are not
good ethics, then there is not good
science."
In California, at least, the law
falls on the side of those who favor
embryonic research.
"The political debate over stem
cell research in California is over be
cause human embryonic research is
legal in California," Goldstein said.
"There is also apparently strong
popular support for the research in
California."
