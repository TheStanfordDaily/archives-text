# Univ. reverses policy affecting partisan groups
## 
### NICK PARKER 
At the ASSU Undergraduate Senate meeting last
night. Assoc. Dean of Students and Office of Student
Activities Director Nancy Howe announced a change
in the policy that previously barred the Stanford De
mocrats from using White Plaza as a staging area for
their phone-banking event last Sunday.
The campus political group had planned to call reg
istered, undecided voters in swing states, mainly Ohio,
in support of Democratic presidential candidate Sena
tor John Kerry.
The University claimed that federal non-profit
regulations did not allow partisan political groups to
use campus facilities. As a result, the Democrats were
forced to carry out their "Kerry Power Hour" off
campus.
The change in policy came after a threat issued by
graduate student Kai Stinchcombe, president of the
Stanford Democrats, who said he would sue the Uni
versity unless it changed its policy controlling partisan
political activity on campus.
Howe said that recent objections to Stanford's pol
icy caused the University to reconsider and subse
quently change its policy on the issue. Howe then noti
fied the ASSU of the amendment.
"White Plaza has always been a great student sup
port center of free speech and freedom of expression,"
she said to the senate. "However, revisiting guidelines
is a good thing to do."
"We are currently in the process of modifying the
White Plaza guidelines so that all students can easily
understand the rules," Howe continued. "We want
to allow all political groups on campus to express
themselves."
Howe said that the old White Plaza regulations
were confusing in their wording and were routinely
misinterpreted by students. She added that the new
modifications should clear up the uncertainty.
"We want students to continue to pass out fliers and
set up tables ... in White Plaza, which many people
see as the center of campus life," Howe commented.
"We don't feel that some students should be banned
from White Plaza simply because their views are not
shared by everyone."
In response to the change, Stinchcombe said he was
"thrilled."
In addition to the White Plaza policy change, the
ASSU meeting also covered the Senate advocacy is
sues and a change to the ASSU special-fees refund
policy.
Some senators felt that the ASSU should support
discussions of broader, larger-scale advocacy issues
such as stem-cell research and the death penalty, while
other members felt that internal concerns — issues
that may have a more immediate impact on student life
— are more important.
Sophomore Omar Shakir, the ASSU Senate advo
cacy chair, was in favor of discussing and taking a
stance on national issues.
"We, as a Senate, are the voice of the student
body," he said. "We should be able to touch any issue,
because if we don't, we are limiting the voice of Stan
ford students."
In response, Senate Chair Chris Lin, a senior, of
fered an different view.
"We need to talk about issues that affect Stanford
students because they are Stanford students," he
said.
"When we say something about
dining, it is a lot more powerful and
a lot more meaningful to the student
body as a whole than when we say
something about national issues."
"If the ASSU were to support
discussions about national issues,

there would inevitably be a sub
stantial group of students that does
not support that issue and would
therefore not support us," Lin
added.
The ASSU special-fees refund
policy has changed since last year.

Advocacy, special fees
round out meeting agenda

Now, refunds are added to students'
University bills, instead of mailed to
them in the form of checks.
The change is an effort to dis
courage vast numbers of students
from requesting refunds from the
ASSU.
