# Not 'high risk'? No flu shot this year
## 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ STAFF WRITER 
Due to a massive, nationwide short
age of influenza vaccinations, Vaden
Health Center has reserved flu shots
this year for those most at risk.
The Center for Disease Control and
Prevention specifies "high risk individ
uals" as people over 65, pregnant
women or those who suffer from
chronic medical conditions like dia
betes. asthma or heart disease.
According to Harry Greenberg,
MD, professor of microbiology and im
munology at Stanford University
School of Medicine, this widespread
vaccine shortage resulted from the sus
pension of the manufacturing license at
Chiron Corporation, a major manufac
turer of the flu vaccine. This suspen
sion resulted from bacterial contami
nation of Chiron's flu vaccine doses.
Because Chiron is one of the Ameri
ca's two vaccine suppliers, this year's
national supply will be cut in half,
Greenberg said.
As a result of this national shortage.
Vaden has received only 1,950 doses of
the influenza vaccine, which is less than

half of last year's supply of 4,000 doses,
said Ira M. Friedman, MD, director of
Vaden Health Center. Consequently,
vaccinations will only be distributed on
an appointment basis to students who
fall under the high risk category, as well
as to student spouses or domestic part
ners who are established patients with
Vaden Health center, Friedman said.
Vaden will administer the flu shot
doses at $20 each for general students
and $10 for those with Cardinal Care.
Currently, Vaden has no plan to ac
commodate students who are unable to
receive vaccinations because of the
shortage.
"Unfortunately, we do not have the
vaccines, nor do we have the permis
sion legally to vaccinate students who
are not at high risk," Friedman said.
As a result of this year's shortage,
several national flu experts are consid
ering possible measures that may help
prevent future shortages of this scale.
According to Greenberg, part of the
problem is that the number of flu vac
cine doses that are exported to the
United States varies from year to year
because manufacturers have a hard
time predicting customer demand. SS

Some experts suggest that the gov
ernment set a fixed amount of doses
that the United States will purchase
each year to maintain a more consis
tent supply. Others argue that another
problem is inconvenience, and to solve
it insurance companies should pay for
flu vaccines so that everyone who has
medical insurance would be able to re
ceive a flu shot with ease, Greenberg
said.
Aside from an inconsistent vaccine
supply, another major problem is the
United States' dependency on foreign
produced vaccine. Currently, the Unit
ed States does not manufacture its own
flu vaccines and must import them
from European countries. Some ex
perts suggest that the government pro
duce its own vaccines to decrease for
eign dependence, Greenberg said.
Because this national problem is di
rectly affecting the University, some
students are concerned about a large
campus outbreak of the flu virus.
"Last year when I got the flu, I had
to miss some classes and that threw me
off my schedule," said sophomore
Daniel Chavez. "I'm afraid that more

students will have to go through that
as well because of the cutback on
vaccines."
Other students, such as sopho
more Nathan Marchack, do not
share such strong apprehensions.
"While I know that there are
quite a few people who will be gen
uinely concerned about this large
decrease in the supply of flu shots, I
doubt anyone will view it as a really
significant event," Marchack said.
"I remember hearing from

friends last year that they weren't
able to receive a flu shot since they
were out of vaccine doses, and they
dealt with it."
Although Friedman currently
has no indication that this year's flu
season will be worse than in past
years, he recommends that students
take preventative measures such as
eating vitamin-rich foods, washing
their hands frequently, exercising
regularly, getting sufficient sleep
and covering their mouths and

noses when coughing or sneezing.
Greenberg strongly recommends
that if students qualify as high risk
individuals they should receive flu
vaccinations.
"It's not easy to avoid the flu be
cause it's so contagious and it
spreads so rapidly," Greenberg said.
"While eating and sleeping well
are great for overall health, a person
should get vaccinated because it is
the best way fora person to avoid
catchina the flu."
