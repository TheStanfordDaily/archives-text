# New Univ. initiatives to improve quality of life for female faculty
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In response to a three-year study
on faculty recruitment and reten
tion, non-salary support and quality
of life for women released this past
spring, the University has enacted
several programs to protect gender
equity and improve the quality of
life of female faculty members.
Chaired by Law School Prof.
Deborah Rhode, the committee re
sponsible for the study presented
the Faculty Senate with its results in
the Report of the Provost's Adviso
ry Committee on the Status of
Women Faculty this past May.
The committee's primary recom
mendations were that Stanford ad
dress problems of equitable repre
sentation in leadership positions,
more fully integrate women faculty
into the academic community and
improve University provisions for
childcare, Rhode said.
"There are a fair amount of issues
to be addressed and a fair amount of
interest in improving the standard of
living on campus," Rhode said.
At a meeting last week to discuss
the report, Provost John
Etchemendy outlined several pro
grams to respond to the report's 18
recommendations. A Faculty
Women's Forum, a Panel on Gen
der Equity and Quality of Life, a
Childcare Working Group and a
program to create a new childcare
center are all currently in the works.
Rhode and Vice Provost for Fac
ulty Development Patricia Jones are
now working to initiate the
Women's Faculty Forum — a forum
similar to a successful program at
Yale University designed to give
women faculty the opportunity to
come together and discuss both gen
der-relevant and gender-neutral is
sues.
About 75 women have already
indicated interest in participating in
the forum and have made sugges
tions about what purposes the forum
ought to serve, Rhode and Jones
said. The forum's leadership and
agenda will be determined by its
members.
Female faculty have requested
that the forum serve as a medium to
meet and interact with one another
from schools across the university,
said Jones, who is currently compil
ing such suggestions. Interacting
with other female faculty will likely
be an important function of the
forum, especially for those women
who work in departments with very
low proportions of female faculty,
Rhode said.
Other issues that will be ad
dressed are balancing between work
and life, organizing mentoring activ
ities, investigating childcare im

provement on campus and sharing
information on career, personal and
intellectual development.
"We hope that women will advo
cate for themselves and take initia
tive independent of the administra
tion," Jones said. "That's the main
goal of the forum. We want to get
some women to be leaders and get
women's own ideas on what needs to
be done."
In addition to announcing the
creation of the women's forum at
last week's meeting, Etchemendy
has also announced the creation of a
Panel of Gender Equity and Quality
of Life to be chaired by Rhode. Un
like the forum, the panel will be con
nected to the administration and
specifically focused on addressing
the recommendations of the Report
of the Provost's Advisory Commit
tee on the Status of Women Faculty.
The panel will continue the
analysis in the report and collect ad
ditional data to follow potential
trends in women's faculty issues. It
will also actively work on solutions
to improve quality of life through
strategies yet to be determined,
Jones said.
On the agenda of both the forum
and the panel is childcare improve
ment — a main quality of life con
cern for both male and female facul
ty members as well as other Univer
sity staff, students and fellows.
The University's three full-time
childcare centers — The Children's
Center of the Stanford Community,
the Stanford Arboretum Children's
Center and Knowledge Beginnings
Child Development Center — cur
rently provide care for 367 children.
An additional 500 children are on
the wait list said Director of the
Work Life Office Teresa Rasco.
Those who are waitlisted have to
seek out part-time care opportuni
ties on campus or use the Work Life
Office's resource and referral pro
gram to help them find off-campus
alternatives.
"It is a real challenge to find
good, affordable arrangements for
children," said Jones. "Faculty can't
come to work until that's done."
In addition to limited availability,
affordability of childcare is a prob
lem on campus, Rasco said. Full
time care five days a week at the
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community costs $1,732 a month for
an eight-week to two-year-old child,
according to the center's Web site.
To help address childcare con
cerns, Etchemendy announced at
last week's meeting that plans to
make a new childcare center will be
accelerated.
According to Rasco, Etchemendy
plans to have the new center ready
