1987—0n Oct. 14, The Daily ran a
story about acquaintance rapists pos
ing a bigger problem than the infa
mous "ski mask rapist." Below is an
excerpt:
"An unidentified man called the
'ski mask rapist,' who has assaulted
over 21 women in the Peninsula area
since last April, is not as dangerous
to the public as less conspicuous ac
quaintance rapists, according to
Palo Alto Rape Crisis Center Coor
dinator Laurie Wedemeyer.
Acquaintance rapists are more
worrisome than attackers like the
'ski mask rapist' because they can
assault more people and never be
accused, Wedemeyer said, adding
that 80 percent of all rapes are com
mitted by a person who knows the
victim.
Wedemeyer urged students to
stay alert to potential rape acquain
tance relationships.
'One in four women will be sexu
ally assaulted by age 18.' Wedemey
er said. That statistic is especially
relevant to Stanford undergradu
ates, because students may have
been sexually abused at home and
cannot come to terms with the situa
tion until they are away at school,
she added.
Wedemeyer said she feared that
Stanford students affected by rape
rarely get the counseling they need.
'Stanford students feel like they
have to be tougher than most people
and feel bad about asking for help.'
she said. 'They will make the initial
appointments (at the crisis center)
and do not follow through (with
counseling) because they think it is a

sign of weakness.'
1996 — On Oct. 14, The Daily ran a
story about students crusading
against the U.S. News & World Re
port rankings of colleges. Below is an
excerpt:
"ASSU Vice President Nick
Thompson has launched a campaign
to prevent U.S. News & World Re
port from compiling its annual rank
ings of universities.
Thompson has called on college
students across the country to ask
their universities to stop submitting
the data that makes the rankings
possible.
Tomorrow, ASSU Senate Deputy
Chair Joe Freund will introduce a bill
before the senate that requests Stan
ford to pull our of the news maga
zine's 10-year-old rankings.
"1 would prefer that the informa
tion be provided, but it should
coome from a source not motivated
by money and should not subjective
ly rank colleges," Thompson said.
"College education cannot and
should not be quantified."
Supporting Thompson in his
drive against the national news mag
azine is a small group of concerned
students and ASSU senators.
"The focus group has six or seven
people that are contacting people,
friends, activists and student govern
ments at other campuses," Thomp
son said. "Our goal is to get enough
student groups behind this to make
it into a national issue."
