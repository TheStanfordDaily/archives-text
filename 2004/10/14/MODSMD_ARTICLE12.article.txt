# San Jose State Univ. students pay for fake IDs
## 
### SARA SPIVEY SPARTAN DAILY (SAN JOSE STATE U 
(U-WIRE) SAN JOSE, Calif —
Every day some students under the
age of 21 break the law by purchas
ing an alcoholic drink with the aid of
a false identification card or driver li
cense.
Jonathon Bender, an undeclared
San Jose State University freshman,
said he was arrested in September at
a liquor store in San Francisco for
trying to purchase alcohol with a
phony California driver license he
purchased for $175.
"I walked in, grabbed (a bottle of)
vodka and handed it to the cashier,"
Bender said. "He asked for (identifi
cation ) and I pulled it out and calmly
placed it on the table."
The clerk reached across the
counter and grabbed him after he
looked at the identification card,
Bender said. He said the phony li
cense was missing the holograms
normally present on the front side,
which is what probably tipped the
clerk that the identification was
false.
"(The clerk's) buddy locked the
door and he called the police," he
said.
Bender and his friend, who he
said was not arrested, were locked
inside the liquor store with the clerks
for more than 30 minutes while they
waited for the police, he said.
"When the police (arrived) they
handcuffed me and took me down
town," he said.
Bender said he was charged with
possessing false identification and
being a minor in possession of alco
hol. He said he spent the night in jail
and had to pay a total of $500 in fines.
Obtaining a card can be as easy as
typing "fake 11)" into Google, which
brings up a long list of Web sites sell
ing "authentic looking fake (identifi
cation) cards" and software to make
the cards on a computer.
"The (phony identification) cards
are made from blank hotel swipe
cards with special software and stick
on holograms," said Mark Chavez,
who works security at Johnny V's
bar in San Jose.

Chavez has been working securi
ty for two years, and said he can tell
the cards are phony right away.
"They don't have the white signa
ture box under the (magnetic) strip
(on the back of the card)," he said.
Other people who purchase alcohol
and are under 21 years old are using
real identification — just not their
own.
"I have a 20-year-old friend who
used her sister's (driver's license) be
cause they looked exactly alike,"
said Laura Snyder, an SJSIJ unde
clared freshman.
Snyder said she knows a lot of
people who have phony identifica
tion cards and use them to purchase
alcohol at liquor stores.
"A lot of liquor stores let you use
fake (identification)," she said.
"They don't check."
Robert Sylvia, the district admin
istrator for the Department of Alco
holic Beverage Control, said posses
sion of a false identification card vio
lates the California Business and
Professions Code 25661.
The code covers phony identifica
tion cards as well as authentic licens
es being used by someone else.
The code states that any person
under 21 who has any false evidence
of age and identity in their posses
sion is guilty of a misdemeanor.
A first violation is punishable by a
fine of at least $250 or 24 to 32 hours
of community service, and subse
quent violations are punishable by a
fine of not more than $500. or 36 to
48 hours of community service.
Sylvia said he always prosecutes
persons under age 21 found to be in
possession of false identification.
He said he makes the decision
whether to hold a business liable for
selling to someone under 21 on a
case-by-case basis, depending on the
false identification presented. He
evaluates what the identification
looks like and what the minor looks
like.
"If the minor's description
doesn't match the minor in person,
then (the business) may be subject to
disciplinary action," Sylvia said.
"They didn't do a good enough
job in trying to determine if it was the
person."

If held liable, the business may be
punished by a fine of $1,000, and the
person who sold the beverage will be
required to perform not less than 24
hours of community service.
Bars and nightclubs pay people to
stand at the front doors and check
identification cards to protect them
from the liability, said Jason Gustus,
door staff at Mission Ale House in
San Jose and an SJSU senior major
ing in criminology.
He said he and the rest of the door
staff at Mission Ale House have be
come experts at spotting phony
cards, as well as authentic cards that
have pictures and descriptions that
do not match the patron.
"I've done it so long, I can tell (a
false identification card) by the tex
ture," he said.
He said he also checks the card
for coloration variances, thickness,
holograms and uneven cut marks
around the edges.
Gustus said he can usually tell if
someone has a phony identification
by his or her body language.
"(Women's methods) are way
different than guys. They'll try to
talk you into (letting them in)," Gus
tus said.
"Guys will approach the door
with confidence, but they're kind of
nervous."
Donte Josey, bartender, security
and promotions staff member at
Toons nightclub in San Jose, said his
trick is to shine a flashlight through
the identification card.
"If (light) goes all the way
through the card, it's fake," he said.
Josey said he also has a series of
questions to ask someone if they
come to the door with real identifica
tion but with a picture or description
not matching their physical features.
"We ask them their birthday and
where they live, but the way we tell is
by having them sign the signature,"
he said.
Josey said he sometimes will send
a decoy through the door with false
identification to test a new employ
ee.
"We don't want them to get per
suaded by a pretty face or a nice
body," he said.

which is what probably tipped the
clerk that the identification was
false.
"(The clerk's) buddy locked the
door and he called the police," he
said.
Bender and his friend, who he
said was not arrested, were locked
inside the liquor store with the clerks
for more than 30 minutes while they
waited for the police, he said.
"When the police (arrived) they
handcuffed me and took me down
town," he said.
Bender said he was charged with
possessing false identification and
being a minor in possession of alco
hol. He said he spent the night in jail
and had to pay a total of $500 in fines.
Obtaining a card can be as easy as
typing "fake 11)" into Google, which

"The (phony identification) cards
are made from blank hotel swipe
cards with special software and stick
on holograms," said Mark Chavez,
who works security at Johnny V's
bar in San Jose.

Chavez has been working securi
ty for two years, and said he can tell
the cards are phony right away.
"They don't have the white signa
ture box under the (magnetic) strip
(on the back of the card)," he said.
Other people who purchase alcohol
and are under 21 years old are using
real identification — just not their
own.
"I have a 20-year-old friend who
used her sister's (driver's license) be
cause they looked exactly alike,"
said Laura Snyder, an SJSIJ unde
clared freshman.
Snyder said she knows a lot of
people who have phony identifica
tion cards and use them to purchase
alcohol at liquor stores.
"A lot of liquor stores let you use
fake (identification)," she said.
"They don't check."
Robert Sylvia, the district admin
istrator for the Department of Alco
holic Beverage Control, said posses
sion of a false identification card vio
lates the California Business and
Professions Code 25661.
The code covers phony identifica
tion cards as well as authentic licens
es being used by someone else.
The code states that any person
under 21 who has any false evidence
of age and identity in their posses
sion is guilty of a misdemeanor.
A first violation is punishable by a
fine of at least $250 or 24 to 32 hours
of community service, and subse
quent violations are punishable by a
fine of not more than $500. or 36 to
48 hours of community service.
Sylvia said he always prosecutes
persons under age 21 found to be in
possession of false identification.
He said he makes the decision
whether to hold a business liable for
selling to someone under 21 on a
case-by-case basis, depending on the
false identification presented. He
evaluates what the identification
looks like and what the minor looks
like.
"If the minor's description
doesn't match the minor in person,
then (the business) may be subject to
disciplinary action," Sylvia said.
"They didn't do a good enough
job in trying to determine if it was the
person."

If held liable, the business may be
punished by a fine of $1,000, and the
person who sold the beverage will be
required to perform not less than 24
hours of community service.
Bars and nightclubs pay people to
stand at the front doors and check
identification cards to protect them
from the liability, said Jason Gustus,
door staff at Mission Ale House in
San Jose and an SJSU senior major
ing in criminology.
He said he and the rest of the door
staff at Mission Ale House have be
come experts at spotting phony
cards, as well as authentic cards that
have pictures and descriptions that
do not match the patron.
"I've done it so long, I can tell (a
false identification card) by the tex
ture," he said.
He said he also checks the card
for coloration variances, thickness,
holograms and uneven cut marks
around the edges.
Gustus said he can usually tell if
someone has a phony identification
by his or her body language.
"(Women's methods) are way
different than guys. They'll try to
talk you into (letting them in)," Gus
tus said.
"Guys will approach the door
with confidence, but they're kind of
nervous."
Donte Josey, bartender, security
and promotions staff member at
Toons nightclub in San Jose, said his
trick is to shine a flashlight through
the identification card.
"If (light) goes all the way
through the card, it's fake," he said.
Josey said he also has a series of
questions to ask someone if they
come to the door with real identifica
tion but with a picture or description
not matching their physical features.
"We ask them their birthday and
where they live, but the way we tell is
by having them sign the signature,"
he said.
Josey said he sometimes will send
a decoy through the door with false
identification to test a new employ
ee.
"We don't want them to get per
suaded by a pretty face or a nice
body," he said.
(U-WIRE) SAN JOSE, Calif —
Every day some students under the
age of 21 break the law by purchas

a false identification card or driver li

Jonathon Bender, an undeclared
San Jose State University freshman,
said he was arrested in September at
a liquor store in San Francisco for
trying to purchase alcohol with a
phony California driver license he
purchased for $175.
"I walked in, grabbed (a bottle of)
vodka and handed it to the cashier,"
Bender said. "He asked for (identifi

placed it on the table."
