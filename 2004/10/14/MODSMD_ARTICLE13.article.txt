# Columbia U. cracks down on illegal copying

(U-WIRE) NEW YORK — File
sharers are no longer the only vic
tims of Columbia University's in
creasingly tough policies regarding
copyright violation. As of this se
mester, English and philosophy pro
fessors must take personal responsi
bility for any copyright infringe
ments in their classes' coursepacks.
The measure comes after internal
inquiries in the English and philoso
phy departments last semester
found that some professors were il
legally using copyrighted materials
in class coursepacks, the convenient
compilations of literary and scholar
ly readings that save students from
buying multiple textbooks.
While many departments have
always provided the coursepacks
through copy shops — preventing
copyright violations — the English
and philosophy departments were
printing their own packets.
"It seemed to me a greater effort
needed to be made to make sure we
were in compliance" with copyright
laws, said Joy Hayton, English de
partment administrator, who con
ducted the internal review of her de
partment last semester. "The profes
sors have taken to the new system
without a problem. ... I think they
had a sense that [what they were
doing] didn't seem quite right."
Fair use law, which governs the
use of copyrighted materials for ed

ucational purposes, is vague at best.
Universities must use four factors —
purpose of use, nature of the copy
righted work, portion of the work
used, and effect of the work's use on
its potential market — to determine
what copying limits should be.
Columbia has interpreted this to
mean that 20 percent of any book,
one article from any journal, and any
out-of-print text can be copied and
redistributed without fear of penalty
— limits that professors were un
knowingly breaking in previous se
mesters to provide students with
coursepacks at or below cost of pro
duction.
"We had lines down the hall of
students waiting to buy packets
(from the department], which we
were pleased to do," Hayton said.
"But since more and more profes
sors were doing that, I don't think
we could've coped."
Now production of coursepacks
and the securing of copyright per
mission is outsourced to local copy
shops — which add copyright fees
to the coursepack prices, making
them drastically more expensive for
students.
Many other universities central
ize their coursepack production by
having the school bookstore or a
special copy center secure copyright
permissions.
"It's hard to tell if students are
more frustrated by the price or by
the size of the packets," said Mary
Seidner, manager of Village Copier.
"Some are as big as textbooks." And

at cos t s of up to $60 or $70. they're as
expensive, too.
"I fec:l disgruntled," said Yona
Gore/ick, BC 06. "1 know [coursep
ack prices are| a system problem and
that people who wrote the material
should be paid for it. But I think
course packets should be put on re
serve ait the library."
Mainy professors sympathize with
the students' complaints.
"Tnition is a hell of a lot of
money, and you add on top of that
[the coursepack cost].... It seems to
me to be extreme," said Karl Kroe
ber, professor of English and com
parative literature. "1 wish there
were ainother way around it."
Uti 1 izing the copy shops is also an
annoyance to professors, who have
to prepare a detailed list of publish
er information, a potentially gruel
ing task since many publishers are
obscun; or foreign.
"I use stories that are scattered
through a million places for my short
novel dlass," Kroeber said. "It drives
me maid, this copyright business. It's
just [a hunch of] publishers who are
greedy."
The; only way to circumnavigate
copyright law right now is to put
reading materials on reserve in the
library and have students photocopy

"Some are as big as textbooks." And

at cos t s of up to $60 or $70. they're as
expensive, too.
"I fec:l disgruntled," said Yona
Gore/ick, BC 06. "1 know [coursep
ack prices are| a system problem and
that people who wrote the material
should be paid for it. But I think
course packets should be put on re
serve ait the library."
Mainy professors sympathize with
the students' complaints.
"Tnition is a hell of a lot of
money, and you add on top of that
[the coursepack cost].... It seems to
me to be extreme," said Karl Kroe
ber, professor of English and com
parative literature. "1 wish there
were ainother way around it."
Uti 1 izing the copy shops is also an
annoyance to professors, who have
to prepare a detailed list of publish
er information, a potentially gruel
ing task since many publishers are
obscun; or foreign.
"I use stories that are scattered
through a million places for my short
novel dlass," Kroeber said. "It drives
me maid, this copyright business. It's
just [a hunch of] publishers who are
greedy."
The; only way to circumnavigate
copyright law right now is to put
reading materials on reserve in the
library and have students photocopy
their own coursepacks — a burden
some alternative.
Courseworks, which allows stu
dents to print readings from a pass
word-protected Web site, is subject
to the same copyright limitations as
printed materials.
