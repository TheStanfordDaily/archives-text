# Curbing the urge to steal
## Stanford researchers test drug to control kleptomania 
### ILENA GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
Some people steal because they cannot
afford to buy the merchandise. Others steal
in order to profit off the re-sale of the pil
fered goods. Sometimes teenagers and pre
teens will steal on a dare or as an act of re
bellion. And some people steal because they
are driven to it by urges they cannot control.
This last group consists of people with
kleptomania.
Although "kleptomaniac" is a term tossed
around lightly in modern speech, kleptoma
nia is an officially recognized disease falling
into the category of impulse-control disor
ders, such as compulsive gambling or tri
chotillomania (compulsive hair-pulling).
Impulse-control disorders significantly
impact the lives of those who suffer from
them but they have not been the subject of
much research: Kleptomania in particular
has received little attention from the scien
tific community.
A team of researchers at Stanford, led by Dr.
Lorrin Koran, a psychiatry professor, is seeking
to alter this trend by conducting the first ever
placebo-controlled study of a drug that could al
leviate the symptoms of kleptomania.
The disorder has specific hallmarks that
distinguish it from simple shoplifting: Klepto
maniacs feel an intense and irrational impulse
to steal items they don't need or could afford
without resorting to theft. Another distin
guishing feature of the disorder are the power
ful feelings of remorse and guilt people experi
ence after thieving. Some kleptomaniacs will
even attempt to replace the stolen items,
putting themselves at an increased risk of
being caught.
No one is sure what causes the uncon
trollable urge to steal in kleptomaniacs
since so little research has been conduct
ed on the condition. As Koran explained,
the trend in psychopharmacology has
been to study illnesses that can often be
life-threatening, such as schizophrenia
and depression.
The field has only recently turned to non
life-threatening diseases that still have
marked negative consequences for those
who have them.
"The best estimate of people with klepto
mania is six in 1,000," Koran explained. "That's
35,000 in the Bay Area by that estimate."

Yet because so few seek help, the statistic
is only a guess. It is not based on hard epi
demiological data, added Koran.
In addition to not knowing what causes
the disorder, the lack of research into klep-

tomania has precluded
a set of treatment op
tions from evolving.
"Many different
styles of psychothera
py have been tried,"
said Dr. Elias Abou
jaoude, an attending
psychiatrist at the
Medical Center and an
investigator in the
study. "There's no one
school of psychology
that's most effective."
He added that cog
nitive behavioral
therapy seems to be a
successful treatment
option.
For those interested
in researching klepto
mania, there are other
obstacles to surmount,
including finding peo
ple with the disorder
who are willing to be a
part of a study.
Koran and his team
have been seeking par
ticipants for at least a
year, and are still a few
participants short of
the 24 people they are
aiming to enroll in the
study. Although the
study is completely
confidential, the ille
gality of shoplifting
might make kleptoma
niacs wary.
"I think people
don't call us because

they think it's a sting," Koran explained.
Aboujaoude mentioned other reserva
tions kleptomaniacs might have with partici
pating in a trial.
"I think people are very hesitant to come
forward with this problem, even to see a psychi
atrist," he said. "There's a lot of shame and a lot
of guilt in [admitting you're a kleptomaniac]."

Aboujaoude also noted the general public's
lack of education about kleptomania as a dis
ease, saying, "People confuse it with sociopa
thy — [they] don't think that a sociopath can
be treated with medication."

"Mostly we've gotten referrals from other
providers in the community that know about
our work," he continued. "The court system
will also refer their clients to us."
Another problem lies with getting drug
companies to finance and provide materials
for studies involving their product.
"Drug companies have not been very will

ing to be associated with this disorder,"
Aboujaoude said.
Companies are wary of associating them
selves with a disorder that often has criminal
consequences.

The drug used in
this study is called
Lexapro and is com
monly used to treat
depression. It is a
class of drugs known
as selective sero
tonin reuptake in
hibitors, which allow
serotonin to remain
in the nervous sys
tem. Serotonin,
Koran explained, is a
chemical messenger
that tells nerves to
"quiet down," mak
ing them less likely to
send a signal.
This mechanism
is effective in de
pression because
certain parts of the
brain are hyperac
tive in the disease.
Quieting the nerves
there quells the hy
peractivity and alle
viates the symptoms
of depression.
Although no one
is sure how klepto
mania operates in
the brain, Koran
studied the effects of
this drug on compul
sive shoppers
through control tri
als and found that
there was improve
ment in two-thirds
to three-fourths of

the participants.
Since both kleptomania and compulsive buy
ing are impulse control disorders, he thought
the drug might also work for treating those
with an impulsive urge to steal.
Koran's study is particularly significant
because it is the first to feature a placebo
controlled trial to test a drug's effect on klep
tomania. Research and studies into klepto

mania in the past, Aboujaoude explained,
were mostly case reports, where a physician
describes a specific patient's symptoms, diag
noses and treatment.
He also said there has also been at least
one "open-label" drug trial, with a drug that
blocks opiate receptors in the brain, that
showed positive results.
However, the designation "open-label"
means that all participants received the drug,
and all participants knew they would receive
the drug, making the study less scientifically
rigorous than a placebo-controlled trial since
the results can be confounded by the fact the
placebo effect.
Although this new study also features an
open-label phase, in which all participants are
given Lexapro for seven weeks, it is followed
by 17 weeks in which participants who re
sponded well to the drug — that is, they did not
suffer side effects and did decrease their steal
ing — will be randomly split into groups that
will either continue to receive the drug or will
receive a placebo. This phase of the study is
double-blind: Neither the participants nor the
doctors will know which group the participants
have been assigned to.
"The idea is that if you're a placebo re
sponder you will relapse in the second phase,
whereas if you have a true medication re
sponse you will continue to respond in the
second phase," Aboujaoude said.
Participants will be required to meet with
the researches approximately every other
week. They will also keep track of their steal
ing behaviors and urges to steal.
While this is one of the first rigorous tri
als to address this issue, the researchers
hope that the study and its results will re
move some of the stigma from the condi
tion and that those placing themselves at
risk every time they step into a store will fi
nally find a solution.

People suffering from kleptomania feel an uncontrollable urge to steal anything, from candy
to jewelry, placing them at risk for minor and major criminal offenses.
Some people steal because they cannot
afford to buy the merchandise. Others steal
in order to profit off the re-sale of the pil
fered goods. Sometimes teenagers and pre
teens will steal on a dare or as an act of re

to steal items they don't need or could afford
without resorting to theft. Another distin
guishing feature of the disorder are the power
ful feelings of remorse and guilt people experi
ence after thieving. Some kleptomaniacs will
even attempt to replace the stolen items,
putting themselves at an increased risk of
being caught.
No one is sure what causes the uncon
trollable urge to steal in kleptomaniacs
since so little research has been conduct
ed on the condition. As Koran explained,
the trend in psychopharmacology has
been to study illnesses that can often be
life-threatening, such as schizophrenia
and depression.
The field has only recently turned to non
life-threatening diseases that still have
marked negative consequences for those
who have them.
"The best estimate of people with klepto
mania is six in 1,000," Koran explained. "That's
35,000 in the Bay Area by that estimate."

Yet because so few seek help, the statistic
is only a guess. It is not based on hard epi
demiological data, added Koran.
In addition to not knowing what causes
the disorder, the lack of research into klep-

tomania has precluded
a set of treatment op
tions from evolving.
"Many different
styles of psychothera
py have been tried,"
said Dr. Elias Abou
jaoude, an attending
psychiatrist at the
Medical Center and an
investigator in the
study. "There's no one
school of psychology
that's most effective."
He added that cog
nitive behavioral
therapy seems to be a
successful treatment
option.
For those interested
in researching klepto
mania, there are other
obstacles to surmount,
including finding peo
ple with the disorder
who are willing to be a
part of a study.
Koran and his team
have been seeking par
ticipants for at least a
year, and are still a few
participants short of
the 24 people they are
aiming to enroll in the
study. Although the
study is completely
confidential, the ille
gality of shoplifting
might make kleptoma
niacs wary.
"I think people
don't call us because

they think it's a sting," Koran explained.
Aboujaoude mentioned other reserva
tions kleptomaniacs might have with partici
pating in a trial.
"I think people are very hesitant to come
forward with this problem, even to see a psychi
atrist," he said. "There's a lot of shame and a lot
of guilt in [admitting you're a kleptomaniac]."

Aboujaoude also noted the general public's
lack of education about kleptomania as a dis
ease, saying, "People confuse it with sociopa
thy — [they] don't think that a sociopath can
be treated with medication."

"Mostly we've gotten referrals from other
providers in the community that know about
our work," he continued. "The court system
will also refer their clients to us."
Another problem lies with getting drug
companies to finance and provide materials
for studies involving their product.
"Drug companies have not been very will

ing to be associated with this disorder,"
Aboujaoude said.
Companies are wary of associating them
selves with a disorder that often has criminal
consequences.

The drug used in
this study is called
Lexapro and is com
monly used to treat
depression. It is a
class of drugs known
as selective sero
tonin reuptake in
hibitors, which allow
serotonin to remain
in the nervous sys
tem. Serotonin,
Koran explained, is a
chemical messenger
that tells nerves to
"quiet down," mak
ing them less likely to
send a signal.
This mechanism
is effective in de
pression because
certain parts of the
brain are hyperac
tive in the disease.
Quieting the nerves
there quells the hy
peractivity and alle
viates the symptoms
of depression.
Although no one
is sure how klepto
mania operates in
the brain, Koran
studied the effects of
this drug on compul
sive shoppers
through control tri
als and found that
there was improve
ment in two-thirds
to three-fourths of

the participants.
Since both kleptomania and compulsive buy
ing are impulse control disorders, he thought
the drug might also work for treating those
with an impulsive urge to steal.
Koran's study is particularly significant
because it is the first to feature a placebo
controlled trial to test a drug's effect on klep
tomania. Research and studies into klepto

mania in the past, Aboujaoude explained,
were mostly case reports, where a physician
describes a specific patient's symptoms, diag
noses and treatment.
He also said there has also been at least
one "open-label" drug trial, with a drug that
blocks opiate receptors in the brain, that
showed positive results.
However, the designation "open-label"
means that all participants received the drug,
and all participants knew they would receive
the drug, making the study less scientifically
rigorous than a placebo-controlled trial since
the results can be confounded by the fact the
placebo effect.
Although this new study also features an
open-label phase, in which all participants are
given Lexapro for seven weeks, it is followed
by 17 weeks in which participants who re
sponded well to the drug — that is, they did not
suffer side effects and did decrease their steal
ing — will be randomly split into groups that
will either continue to receive the drug or will
receive a placebo. This phase of the study is
double-blind: Neither the participants nor the
doctors will know which group the participants
have been assigned to.
"The idea is that if you're a placebo re
sponder you will relapse in the second phase,
whereas if you have a true medication re
sponse you will continue to respond in the
second phase," Aboujaoude said.
Participants will be required to meet with
the researches approximately every other
week. They will also keep track of their steal
ing behaviors and urges to steal.
While this is one of the first rigorous tri
als to address this issue, the researchers
hope that the study and its results will re
move some of the stigma from the condi
tion and that those placing themselves at
risk every time they step into a store will fi
nally find a solution.

People suffering from kleptomania feel an uncontrollable urge to steal anything, from candy
to jewelry, placing them at risk for minor and major criminal offenses.
Some people steal because they cannot
afford to buy the merchandise. Others steal
in order to profit off the re-sale of the pil
fered goods. Sometimes teenagers and pre
teens will steal on a dare or as an act of re
bellion. And some people steal because they
are driven to it by urges they cannot control.
This last group consists of people with
kleptomania.
Although "kleptomaniac" is a term tossed
around lightly in modern speech, kleptoma
nia is an officially recognized disease falling
into the category of impulse-control disor
ders, such as compulsive gambling or tri
chotillomania (compulsive hair-pulling).
Impulse-control disorders significantly
impact the lives of those who suffer from
them but they have not been the subject of
much research: Kleptomania in particular
has received little attention from the scien
tific community.
A team of researchers at Stanford, led by Dr.
Lorrin Koran, a psychiatry professor, is seeking
to alter this trend by conducting the first ever
placebo-controlled study of a drug that could al
leviate the symptoms of kleptomania.
The disorder has specific hallmarks that
distinguish it from simple shoplifting: Klepto
maniacs feel an intense and irrational impulse
to steal items they don't need or could afford
without resorting to theft. Another distin
guishing feature of the disorder are the power
ful feelings of remorse and guilt people experi
