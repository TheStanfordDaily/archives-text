## Student-run class teaches no child should be left behind 
### LAUREN GONG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
"A child's right to survive is the
first measure of equality, possibility
and freedom," once said Carol Bel
lamy, United Nations Children's
Fund, executive director.
According to UNICEF, over 11
million children die each year from
diseases that are easily pre
ventable. A large number of these
deaths could be prevented simply
by cleaner water. Forty percent of
the world does not have access to
appropriate sanitation facilities.
Six thousand children die every day
from diarrheal diseases alone.
I remember learning during the
human biology core about many is
sues children face in the developing
world. After only a few lectures re
garding these topics, however, I was
left dissatisfied with the amount of in
formation we received, and I felt that
children's health was a topic that de
saved more coverage.
While entire modules involving
weeks of readings were dedicated
to obesity and lactose intolerance,
the fact is that most of the world is
suffering because of lack of food,
not over-consumption. While I
found the other topics in the core
relevant to the student body, 1 wish
more awareness would have been
brougkt to the issues affecting the
majority of the world.
I w&s excited when I saw a flyer
fora new student initiated course at
Stanford, Anthropological Sci
ences 60SI: "International Chil
dren's! Health and Survival."
This course aims to bring
awareness to the global state of
children. Covering topics from
HIV I AIDS and its effect on
youngpeople to the issues faced by

young girls, it is "a comprehensive
introduction to the social, political
and economic forces that cause
preventable child mortality," ac
cording to the course description.
The class was initiated by ju
niors Regan Johnson and Brian
Bergmark with the support of An
thropological Sciences Professors
Ron and Kate Barrett,
"There is no class at Stanford
right now that examines child sur
vival internationally," Johnson and
Bergmark wrote in an e-mail. "Al
though there are classes on interna
tional health and development in
general, we really wanted to focus on
all levels of international health for
children, from the family level to in
ternational policy."
"Disease, violence and material
deprivation in childhood can con
tinue to have debilitating conse
quences throughout a person's
life," Bergmark wrote.
Youth are the key to the world's
fight against almost every infec
tious disease â€” and also the
biggest victims. For example, there
are over 400,000 AIDS orphans ac
cording to the United Nations.
How is this entire generation of
young people supposed to grow
into productive members of society
when they grow up with no support
of their own?
Both Johnson and Bergmark
are passionate about the impor
tance of the issues they are raising,
and they are channeling their inter
ests and passion into educating
their peers.
"As students, we have both the
ability to induce change and the
obligation to do so for the better
ment of children internationally,"
Johnson wrote.
There are many opportunities

for students to get involved with
health-related activist groups on
campus. Just this fall, two students
of Anne Firth Murray, visiting pro
fessor of the human biology pro
gram, were inspired by the grant
writing portion of her seminar on
"Critical Issues in International
Women's Health" and decided to
form their own grant writing Inter
national Women's Health Club, a
club that I jumped at the chance to
be a part of.
The founders of this new SIC,
Johnson and Bergmark, are in
volved with the Student Campaign
for Child Survival Club, both on
campus and nationally. They have
received much support from the
Stanford student community.
"There are huge numbers of stu
dents at Stanford interested in in
ternational health issues," Johnson
said. "Because international health
is so interdisciplinary, students and
faculty related to this field are scat
tered across different majors and
departments."
I remember last year when I in
terviewed Paul Fanner, founder of
Boston-based Partners In Health
and one of the world's leading ex
perts on infectious diseases. He im
pressed on me the importance of
raising awareness about global
health issues on college campuses.
Being a student is a unique time
in one's life because you are able to
learn and teach your fellow peers
about the issues you are passionate
about, and I hope the initiative of
Johnson and Bergmark will be as
inspirational to the Stanford cam
pus as it was to me.
