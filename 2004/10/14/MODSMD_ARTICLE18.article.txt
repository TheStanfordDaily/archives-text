## Study finds today's young people have worse health habits than their counterparts did a decade ago 
### JENNIFER LINT 
What was it like to be an 18-to-24 year-old in the
early 19905? Probably quite similar to being one now:
hanging out with friends, listening to music or watching
TV. Granted, you may have been listening to Smashing
Pumpkins instead of Jack Johnson, but the basics have
probably endured. How about health habits? How do
today's 18-to-24 year-olds stack up against their early
90's counterparts?
If one were to venture around Stanford and see the
countless joggers that criss-cross the campus at all times
of the day, the reduced-calorie offerings at Jamba Juice
and Subway and the no-smoking signs posted in virtual
ly every building, it might be reasonable to think that
young people are doing well in the health department
these days. But despite a healthy facade, young people
today have worse habits than their counterparts did 10
years ago.
Dr. Marilyn Winkleby and her associates at the Stan
ford Prevention Research Center came to this conclu
sion by measuring changes in chronic-disease-related
health behaviors and risk factors in this particular age
group from 1990 to 2000. These risk factors included
smoking, obesity, sedentary behavior and low vegetable
and fruit intake.
People of all ages, races and economic back
grounds were questioned by phone about their

lifestyle. These results were compared to those from a
similar study conducted in 1990, and the results
demonstrated that healthy habits of this young gener
ation are on the decline.
While a relatively small percentage of Stanford stu
dents light up, smoking among young people is actually
on the rise: The prevalence of smoking among 18-to-24
year-olds was the highest of all age groups who partici
pated in the study.
With unhealthy pizza-laden and beer-heavy diets, it
comes as no surprise that obesity is becoming a signifi
cant problem for young people. About a third of those
queried spent little time exercising, and the majority ate
inadequate amounts of fruits and vegetables.
Even though the rates of obesity for all age groups are
on the rise, according to Winkleby's report, health status
was not equal across ethnic and racial lines. The most sig
nificant finding showed that nearly 20 percent of young
black women are at the obesity threshold.
This decline in health habits relative to 10 years ago is,
according to Winkleby, due to "a worsening of trends
that counter healthy lifestyles. This includes the prolifer
ation of fast foods, the increases in portion sizes and in
creasingly sedentary lifestyles."
From Super-Size fries to Big Gulps, portion sizes are ex
ploding. What used to be two serving sizes is now only one,
so unless people carefully monitor the actual calorie count
of a food, they can easily eat more without realizing it.
"Young people should recognize that the forces of soci
ety don't have their best interests at heart — that corpora
tions and media put profits before health," Winkleby said.
This means gaining knowledge of aggressive advertis
ing tactics used by these companies, including promotion
of high fat and high sugar foods and encouraged use of
video and computer games that are part of a sedentary
lifestyle, Winkleby explained.
Most busy students and young professionals proba
bly do not spend a lot of time calculating their risk for
chronic diseases, thinking of heart disease, cancer and
diabetes as concerns that may occur much later on life.
Yet these diseases are among the most prevalent and
costly in the United States. Not only do they account
for more than 75 percent of the nation's healthcare
costs, they also affect people during some of the most
productive years of their lives.
The Stanford Prevention Research Cener is active
ly dealing with this issue through school and community
programs that aim to empower young people to recog
nize environmental factors that are harmful to their
health and then create positive changes. Such changes in
clude the promotion of healthier food at school cafete
rias and increasing access to sports and physical activity.
On a larger level, the center is looking to transform pub
lic health laws to encourage healthier environments.
As evidenced by the fact that Nirvana is no longer
together, Beverly Hills 90210 is off the air and nobody
wears Bugle Boy's anymore, generations have come a
long way since the early 19905. Yet the prevention re
search center is hoping that poor health habits won't
become the next new trend.

Even though the rates of obesity for all age groups are
on the rise, according to Winkleby's report, health status
was not equal across ethnic and racial lines. The most sig
nificant finding showed that nearly 20 percent of young
black women are at the obesity threshold.
This decline in health habits relative to 10 years ago is,
according to Winkleby, due to "a worsening of trends
that counter healthy lifestyles. This includes the prolifer
ation of fast foods, the increases in portion sizes and in
creasingly sedentary lifestyles."
From Super-Size fries to Big Gulps, portion sizes are ex
ploding. What used to be two serving sizes is now only one,
so unless people carefully monitor the actual calorie count
of a food, they can easily eat more without realizing it.
"Young people should recognize that the forces of soci
ety don't have their best interests at heart — that corpora
tions and media put profits before health," Winkleby said.
This means gaining knowledge of aggressive advertis
ing tactics used by these companies, including promotion
of high fat and high sugar foods and encouraged use of
video and computer games that are part of a sedentary
lifestyle, Winkleby explained.
Most busy students and young professionals proba
bly do not spend a lot of time calculating their risk for
chronic diseases, thinking of heart disease, cancer and
diabetes as concerns that may occur much later on life.
Yet these diseases are among the most prevalent and
costly in the United States. Not only do they account
for more than 75 percent of the nation's healthcare
costs, they also affect people during some of the most
productive years of their lives.
The Stanford Prevention Research Cener is active
ly dealing with this issue through school and community
programs that aim to empower young people to recog
nize environmental factors that are harmful to their
health and then create positive changes. Such changes in
clude the promotion of healthier food at school cafete
rias and increasing access to sports and physical activity.
On a larger level, the center is looking to transform pub
lic health laws to encourage healthier environments.
As evidenced by the fact that Nirvana is no longer
together, Beverly Hills 90210 is off the air and nobody
wears Bugle Boy's anymore, generations have come a
long way since the early 19905. Yet the prevention re
search center is hoping that poor health habits won't
become the next new trend.
