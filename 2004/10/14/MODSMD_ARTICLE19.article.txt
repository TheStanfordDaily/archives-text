## Editorial Flat laundry rate makes life easier 
### 
Stanford's new coin-less, unlimited laundry ser
vice program "Just Like Home" has effective
ly met the laundry needs of students living on
campus while addressing the initial concerns
the population had about this system's implementa
tion. Introduced by the ASSU, the system was put
into effect throughout campus this year after being
approved by the University's Board of Trustees.
One of the original causes for opposition to the
new laundry system was the additional money this
change would cost. But a breakdown of this expense
suggests potential added value for students.
The new laundry system charges an annual fee of
$44 to undergraduates' University housing bills,
which equals approximately $14.67 a quarter.
Dividing further by the number of weeks in a
quarter and estimating that the average student will
do a load of laundry every 1.5 weeks, that breaks
down to a projected $1.20, a 31 percent reduction
from the $1.75 per load for washing and drying last
year. And this saving does not account for the con
venience of not having to search for quarters before
a laundry run ever again.
The new laundry system has also allowed the Uni
versity to replace all of its former coin-operated

washing machines with front-loading, energy-effi
cient washers that use 50 percent less water and 75
percent less soap, a boon for the environment.
But some students believe that the potential for
washer misuse could counteract the new system's ad
vantages. The unlimited laundry system could poten
tially be exploited since students can do as many
loads of laundry they want without paying for it with
coins, with people washing unnecessarily small loads.
But many students agreed that they have not wit
nessed this abuse going on in their dorms. Instead,
they reported that they have not felt the need to
overstuff the washers because they do not have to
worry about the additional cost of extra loads. This
allows machines to last longer and require less re
pair, as overloading can cause mechanical problems.
In the end, this system is beneficial and shows
concern for the practical everyday needs of students.
The majority of the student population appears sat
isfied with this new laundry service. The change has
lowered costs and increased convenience and effi
ciency. The remnants of opposition should perhaps
take another look at the numbers and start enjoying
the facilities.
