# To watch debates, the more the merrier
## Groups across campus meet for debates 
### ERIK HOPE, JENNIE KIM GERRY SHIH 
From Suites on west campus
to Crothers Hall on east campus,
students gathered in groups
large and small last night to
watch the third and final presi
dential debate between Presi
dent George W. Bush and Sen.
John Kerry.
Below is a roundup of four
venues where Stanford students
watched and discussed, with
each other and Daily reporters,
the presidential candidates face
off with less than three weeks
left before Election Day.
Crothers Hall
When Bush claimed that the
majority of tax cuts went to the
middle class, the 30 or so stu
dents who had gathered in a
small, stuffy room in the base
ment of Crothers Hall let out a
torrent of boos. Some yelled,
"You're a liar." From one corner
came an exasperated "Oh. [ex-


ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
More than 100 students gathered last night in Toyon Eating Clubs' Barristers to watch the third and final presi
dential debate between President George W. Bush and Mass. Senator John Kerry.

Armed with rapier wits and a touch of
cyncism, students congregate for debate

pletive] you." Groaning came from the other cor
ners of the room.
The private viewing of the third presidential
debate was organized by Kai Stinchcombe, a
graduate student in political science and president
of the Stanford Democrats, who lives in Crothers
Hall. Of the approximately 35 students who
showed up, almost all were members of the Stan
ford Democrats, personally invited by Stinch
combe via e-mail.
"It was just supposed to be a small, informal,
get-together for some of my friends to just relax
and watch the debate," Stinchcombe said.
Whether he was relaxed or not, there was a palpa
ble, anxious energy in the room.
"It's certainly not bipartisan in here," said
freshman Emily Warren, a Stanford Democrats
officer. "There a lot of people frustrated by watch
ing this debate and thinking how awful it'd be if
Bush wins."
Others agreed.
"This election is so important for us young peo
ple," said senior Lisa Diver, who is president of
Students for Choice, an abortion rights group.
"What happens in the next four years will shape
the world that we inherit."
Many said that much was at stake in this debate
— especially given Bush's upswing in the polls
after the second debate last Friday — and said
they hoped fora strong third and final perfor
mance from Kerry.
"The big thing is we need Kerry to be solid and
show he has a domestic plan," Stinchcombe said.
After the debate, Stinchcome told The Daily
that Kerry was ahead in the polls, with marked im
provement in reaching swing voters.
"I was proud of John Kerry for taking firm
stands while Bush was flip flopping on the social
issues," he said. "I'm very impressed and opti
mistic. We're going to win this one."

Haus Mitteleuropa and Suites
Initial reactions to the debate's opening fo
cused on the appearance of the candidates.
"Why do they match?" wondered senior Rafi
Ginsburg. "Do they always have to wear red
ties?"
"Bush has a stupid haircut," another student

remarked.
The cutaway shots of both candidates' reac
tions to each other often drew laughter from the
students watching in the common room of Haus
Mitteleuropa.
Body language was observed closely in this de
bate because the candidates' responses were fairly
predictable, said sophomore Andrew Kartunen.
"The debates are set up so nothing is really un
expected," he said. "So their body language, their
eloquence in speech, those things can show their
faults."
Senior Megan Wilcox-Fogel agreed.
"Their campaigns have been almost perfectly
distilled into sound bites," she said. "What was in
teresting to me was that nothing really stood out.
Both candidates basically stuck to their mes
sages."
Kerry's comments about his Catholic upbring
ing resonated with senior Anthea Tjuanakis.
"I thought his statement of faith was really
well-crafted and very poignant," she said. "Up
until now, we really hadn't heard about what John
Kerry believes in and how that shapes his public
life."
Graduate student Uchenna Okoye appreciat
ed the attention Bush gave to education.
"I thought he made a lot of good points when
he talked about education and jobs," he said. "I
really respected his answer to the unemployment
problem as being an issue of education because
that is the long term solution."
The power dynamics between the candidates
stuck out in sophomore Feranmi Okahlami's
mind.
"It seems like Bush has been on the defensive
for most of the debates, and it really struck me
again tonight how he's constantly having to de
fend his policy decisions, but isn't coming up with
anything new," he said.
Ginsburg said he was disappointed that the de
bate did not bring up anything new about domes
tic issues.
"I was surprised by how little it had to do with
the economy or with domestic policy," he said,
partly blaming moderator Bob Schieffer for the
scant coverage. "Bob didn't do very well; he didn't
do follow-ups when he should have, and his ques
tions were not very good," Ginsburg added.
The final question, regarding the strong

women in the lives of the candidates, confused
some viewers.
"What was going on with George Bush joking
on his wife?" asked Okoye. "He should be careful
— Bill tried that with Hillary, and it screwed him
over."

Barristers, Toy on Eating Clubs
Over 1 (K) students brought their dinners to
Barristers, at the Toyon Eating Clubs, to watch
the debate. They sat on couches, folding chairs
and the floor to get the best view of Bush and
Kerry on the large projection screen.
The event was hosted by Stanford in Govern
ment, which wanted to spread awareness of the
debates to increase student viewership. Julie Lein,
a Daily editor and member of Stanford in Gov
ernment who helped organize the event, said that
advertising the debates was a priority.
"More people are aware of the debates if we
advertise," she said. "We hoped that by dissemi
nating information to as many lists as possible,
more people would come."
While the audience was decidedly pro-Kerry,
not everyone showed up to support one candidate
over the other.
"I want to see them both make fools of them
selves," said sophomore Kat Hoffman.
Others came to the party to watch the debate in
a fun atmosphere.
"It's just an opportunity to watch a debate with
other students," said Cowwor Kuso, a political sci
ence graduate student, who has also attended de
bate parties at Rains and Roble. "There's a little
more energy."
The environment inside Barristers was sub
dued, though Kerry's comparison of Bush's cred
ibility on the economy to Tony Soprano's credi
bility on law elicited a chorus of laughter. Bush
also drew some groans early on when he com
mented on the flu vaccine shortage.
The crowd dissipated as the debate wore on,
especially when it became apparent that there
would be no fireworks between the candidates
like there were at the second debate.
Much of the original crowd had left by the time
the debate ended.

"Why do they match?" wondered senior Rafi
Ginsburg. "Do they always have to wear red
ties?"
"Bush has a stupid haircut," another student

remarked.
The cutaway shots of both candidates' reac
tions to each other often drew laughter from the
students watching in the common room of Haus
Mitteleuropa.
Body language was observed closely in this de
bate because the candidates' responses were fairly
predictable, said sophomore Andrew Kartunen.
"The debates are set up so nothing is really un
expected," he said. "So their body language, their
eloquence in speech, those things can show their
faults."
Senior Megan Wilcox-Fogel agreed.
"Their campaigns have been almost perfectly
distilled into sound bites," she said. "What was in
teresting to me was that nothing really stood out.
Both candidates basically stuck to their mes
sages."
Kerry's comments about his Catholic upbring
ing resonated with senior Anthea Tjuanakis.
"I thought his statement of faith was really
well-crafted and very poignant," she said. "Up
until now, we really hadn't heard about what John
Kerry believes in and how that shapes his public
life."
Graduate student Uchenna Okoye appreciat
ed the attention Bush gave to education.
"I thought he made a lot of good points when
he talked about education and jobs," he said. "I
really respected his answer to the unemployment
problem as being an issue of education because
that is the long term solution."
The power dynamics between the candidates
stuck out in sophomore Feranmi Okahlami's
mind.
"It seems like Bush has been on the defensive
for most of the debates, and it really struck me
again tonight how he's constantly having to de
fend his policy decisions, but isn't coming up with
anything new," he said.
Ginsburg said he was disappointed that the de
bate did not bring up anything new about domes
tic issues.
"I was surprised by how little it had to do with
the economy or with domestic policy," he said,
partly blaming moderator Bob Schieffer for the
scant coverage. "Bob didn't do very well; he didn't
do follow-ups when he should have, and his ques
tions were not very good," Ginsburg added.
The final question, regarding the strong

women in the lives of the candidates, confused
some viewers.
"What was going on with George Bush joking
on his wife?" asked Okoye. "He should be careful
— Bill tried that with Hillary, and it screwed him
over."

Barristers, Toy on Eating Clubs
Over 1 (K) students brought their dinners to
Barristers, at the Toyon Eating Clubs, to watch
the debate. They sat on couches, folding chairs
and the floor to get the best view of Bush and
Kerry on the large projection screen.
The event was hosted by Stanford in Govern
ment, which wanted to spread awareness of the
debates to increase student viewership. Julie Lein,
a Daily editor and member of Stanford in Gov
ernment who helped organize the event, said that
advertising the debates was a priority.
"More people are aware of the debates if we
advertise," she said. "We hoped that by dissemi
nating information to as many lists as possible,
more people would come."
While the audience was decidedly pro-Kerry,
not everyone showed up to support one candidate
over the other.
"I want to see them both make fools of them
selves," said sophomore Kat Hoffman.
Others came to the party to watch the debate in
a fun atmosphere.
"It's just an opportunity to watch a debate with
other students," said Cowwor Kuso, a political sci
ence graduate student, who has also attended de
bate parties at Rains and Roble. "There's a little
more energy."
The environment inside Barristers was sub
dued, though Kerry's comparison of Bush's cred
ibility on the economy to Tony Soprano's credi
bility on law elicited a chorus of laughter. Bush
also drew some groans early on when he com
mented on the flu vaccine shortage.
The crowd dissipated as the debate wore on,
especially when it became apparent that there
would be no fireworks between the candidates
like there were at the second debate.
Much of the original crowd had left by the time
the debate ended.

From Suites on west campus
to Crothers Hall on east campus,
students gathered in groups
large and small last night to
watch the third and final presi
dential debate between Presi
dent George W. Bush and Sen.
John Kerry.
Below is a roundup of four
venues where Stanford students
watched and discussed, with
each other and Daily reporters,
the presidential candidates face
off with less than three weeks
left before Election Day.
Crothers Hall
When Bush claimed that the
majority of tax cuts went to the
middle class, the 30 or so stu
dents who had gathered in a
small, stuffy room in the base
ment of Crothers Hall let out a
torrent of boos. Some yelled,
"You're a liar." From one corner
came an exasperated "Oh. [ex-


ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
More than 100 students gathered last night in Toyon Eating Clubs' Barristers to watch the third and final presi
dential debate between President George W. Bush and Mass. Senator John Kerry.

Armed with rapier wits and a touch of
cyncism, students congregate for debate

pletive] you." Groaning came from the other cor
ners of the room.
The private viewing of the third presidential
debate was organized by Kai Stinchcombe, a
graduate student in political science and president
of the Stanford Democrats, who lives in Crothers
Hall. Of the approximately 35 students who
showed up, almost all were members of the Stan
ford Democrats, personally invited by Stinch
combe via e-mail.
"It was just supposed to be a small, informal,
get-together for some of my friends to just relax
and watch the debate," Stinchcombe said.
Whether he was relaxed or not, there was a palpa
ble, anxious energy in the room.
"It's certainly not bipartisan in here," said
freshman Emily Warren, a Stanford Democrats
officer. "There a lot of people frustrated by watch
ing this debate and thinking how awful it'd be if
Bush wins."
Others agreed.
"This election is so important for us young peo
ple," said senior Lisa Diver, who is president of
Students for Choice, an abortion rights group.
"What happens in the next four years will shape
the world that we inherit."
Many said that much was at stake in this debate
— especially given Bush's upswing in the polls
after the second debate last Friday — and said
they hoped fora strong third and final perfor
mance from Kerry.
"The big thing is we need Kerry to be solid and
show he has a domestic plan," Stinchcombe said.
After the debate, Stinchcome told The Daily
that Kerry was ahead in the polls, with marked im
provement in reaching swing voters.
"I was proud of John Kerry for taking firm
stands while Bush was flip flopping on the social
issues," he said. "I'm very impressed and opti
mistic. We're going to win this one."
