# Students don't need alumni to uphold Stanford's traditions
## 
### VICTOR MADRIGAL 
As you know, the Stanford
Alumni Association is no longer
hosting the Mausoleum Party. We
last hosted the party in 2001. At
that point, SAA announced that we
would not host future Mausoleum
Parties.
In 2001, the SAA decided that
we needed to focus resources and
our energy on other events that
would serve a broader student con
stituency and that would better fit
with SA A's purpose and mission.
We concluded that the Mau
soleum Party could easily be hosted
and organized by another group or
a collaborative effort of multiple

groups. The SAA is not ready at
this point in time to sponsor or or
ganize this event.
The beauty of college traditions
is that there is always a new genera
tion of students that will decide if
they want to keep them alive or not.
Ultimately, students uphold tradi
tions and the appropriate universi
ty staff is here to help as needed and
when needed.
The Mausoleum Party is rela
tively new in the history of Stan
ford. It will most likely continue in
some form or another. However,
Stanford students have various op
tions during Halloween weekend
just as they do every year.
For those that like to celebrate

Halloween, they can attend the
theme concert usually sponsored
by the Music Department. They
can volunteer at some of the local
haunted houses they have set up for
children. And there are also plenty
of Bay Area events that one can
find on the Internet event listings.
Some are free, some are not.
But in a place like Stanford and
the San Francisco Bay Area, almost
anyone can find something to her
liking during most any weekend of
the entire year, not just Halloween.

dent and young alumni outreach at
