# Holt's Harangue
## The 						Dark Side of Full Moon on the Quad 
### 
I think the administration should
cancel Full Moon on the Quad.
Forever. Fve talked to the folks
at the Vaden Health Center, as
well as several high-ranking biology
people, and the figures are shocking.
To put it bluntly, we must cancel Full
Moon because if we don't, there will
be an epidemic. Ever seen "Out
break"? It'll be much worse. But it is
not mononucleosis, hippopota
musvirus or the macerana that I am
worried about. It is lycanthropy
(werewolfism to the layman) that
keeps me up at night.
Have you ever wondered why it
was "Full Moon" on the Quad? Why
pray tell, isn't it just the first week on
campus or something? Simple. Were
wolves, and I'm paraphrasing one of
those biology guys again, only can
transform by the light of the full
moon.
So how did we make such a gross
error in selecting full moon as the
time for our slightly raunchy tradi
tion? Werewolves have had their
hands — or claws, rather — in Full
Moon since the beginning. A cult of
werewolves sprang up at Stanford
long ago. They hold several key posi
tions of power, which for my safety, I
will not reveal. Let's just say one is
John Bravman (I kid — don't eat
me).
Now picture our sweet innocent
student body. Look at George and
Georgina Stanford student. They are
freshmen — cute, innocent, with
stardust in their eyes. They come to
Full Moon with hopes of sharing their
first kiss — perhaps their first kiss
ever, as they are techies.
And then, bam! Turned into the
wretched wolves of darkness just like
that. They wanted to participate in a
Stanford tradition, but they got
mauled by some Theta Delts and in
stead became wolves of hell. Now
George is hairier then Chewbacca,
and no Lady Bic will take care of
Georgina's legs.
The administration, thankfully, is
aware of my concerns. For years, they
have been thinking of ways to limit
werewolf casualties and make the
event safer. That's why they've called
in Absolute Fun.
This year, booze will be absent,
which will surely cut down on were
wolf attacks. Werewolves, if you
didn't know, are attracted to alcohol
(because alcohol is devil water, and
the wolves are the spawn of Satan).
With fun and zaniness only Absolute
Fun has been known to deliver, I
hope we can have a completely safe
Full Moon on the Quad.
In addition to eliminating alcohol

consumption at the event, the cadre
of Absolute Fun enforcement offi
cers will patrol the Quad, ensuring
that everyone is having the maximum
amount of fun possible. Look for
them, for the men will be dressed in
all black with white collars and Puri
tan hats, the women will be in black

dresses and white
aprons.
They'll
offer EANABS
like Holy Water
and if they see
anyone open their
mouth to howl,
they'll shoot to
kill. This may
seem like the ad
ministration is

being heavy-handed. But I must
point to the science as proof once
more.
Every kiss has the potential to
transmit the werewolf s virus and un
leash havoc on the student body. I'm
amazed only five students went to the
hospital last year, as there could have
been so many more attacks. I mean,
the Tree alone must have created at
least a small army of werewolves.
Even with the administration
handing the event to Absolute Fun,
there is still the potential for danger.
Can Absolute Fun prevent the were
wolf-causing practice of kissing from
occurring outside of the event? What
if students load up on werewolf-at
tracting drinks like alcohol and bar
becue sauce before they come?
There is no way we will be totally
safe. Full Moon on the Quad must go
the way of the Mausoleum Party.
I'm sure there are objections to
my humble proposal. Many would
argue that I am singlehandedly de
stroying a fun and harmless tradition
at Stanford, just because a few kids
got mauled and we may have created
a feral army of darkness.
But to those people 1 say, it's not
rash by any means to curtail a popu
lar and fun event purely because of a
random chance a disease might be
transmitted. Furthermore, it's the ad
ministration's duty to ensure that stu
dents don't have the option of choos
ing to drink on their own time. And
those Absolute Fun members will
look real cute dressed like Puritans.
While the administration pon
ders this, 1 am perfecting my kissing
technique ... and arming the PHEs
with silver bullets.

I think the administration should
cancel Full Moon on the Quad.
Forever. Fve talked to the folks
at the Vaden Health Center, as
well as several high-ranking biology
people, and the figures are shocking.
To put it bluntly, we must cancel Full
Moon because if we don't, there will
be an epidemic. Ever seen "Out
break"? It'll be much worse. But it is
not mononucleosis, hippopota
musvirus or the macerana that I am
worried about. It is lycanthropy
(werewolfism to the layman) that
keeps me up at night.
Have you ever wondered why it
was "Full Moon" on the Quad? Why
pray tell, isn't it just the first week on
campus or something? Simple. Were
wolves, and I'm paraphrasing one of
those biology guys again, only can
transform by the light of the full
moon.
So how did we make such a gross
error in selecting full moon as the
time for our slightly raunchy tradi
tion? Werewolves have had their
hands — or claws, rather — in Full
Moon since the beginning. A cult of
werewolves sprang up at Stanford
long ago. They hold several key posi
tions of power, which for my safety, I
will not reveal. Let's just say one is
John Bravman (I kid — don't eat
me).
Now picture our sweet innocent
student body. Look at George and
Georgina Stanford student. They are
freshmen — cute, innocent, with
stardust in their eyes. They come to
Full Moon with hopes of sharing their
first kiss — perhaps their first kiss
ever, as they are techies.
And then, bam! Turned into the
wretched wolves of darkness just like
that. They wanted to participate in a
Stanford tradition, but they got
mauled by some Theta Delts and in
stead became wolves of hell. Now
George is hairier then Chewbacca,
and no Lady Bic will take care of
Georgina's legs.
The administration, thankfully, is
aware of my concerns. For years, they
have been thinking of ways to limit
werewolf casualties and make the
event safer. That's why they've called
in Absolute Fun.
This year, booze will be absent,
which will surely cut down on were
wolf attacks. Werewolves, if you
didn't know, are attracted to alcohol
(because alcohol is devil water, and
the wolves are the spawn of Satan).
With fun and zaniness only Absolute
Fun has been known to deliver, I
hope we can have a completely safe
Full Moon on the Quad.
In addition to eliminating alcohol

consumption at the event, the cadre
of Absolute Fun enforcement offi
cers will patrol the Quad, ensuring
that everyone is having the maximum
amount of fun possible. Look for
them, for the men will be dressed in
all black with white collars and Puri
tan hats, the women will be in black

dresses and white
aprons.
