## Card down UOP Stanford battles Tigers, own mistakes in sloppy five-game victory 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Would the real Stanford Cardinal please
stand up?
When the No. 12 women's volleyball team
(12-4, 4-1 Pacific-10) took on Pacific (10-4, 7-1
Big West) Tuesday night from Stockton, Calif.,
the squad looked almost schizophrenic. In a
Jekyll and Hyde performance, the Cardinal were
able to down the Tigers in five games and escape
with a victory.
The Cardinal, while clearly the more talented
team on the court, fought not only against a
sound Tiger squad, but a hostile crowd and their
own inconsistent play. Although it wasn't pretty,
a win is a win. Stanford showed itself as the more
capable team on the court. But the Tigers, play
ing fundamentally sound volleyball, were able to
make the contest competitive by pouncing on
Stanford mistakes in games one and three.
"For us it's a matter of coming out strong, and
that's been our problem lately," sophomore mid
dle blocker Liz Suiter said. "We came out strong
in games two and four and focused. Our passing
was good the entire time, and it's just a matter of
if we execute and how close we pay attention to
the other side."
A seemingly sleepwalking Cardinal squad
came out in game one. Both teams started out the
game with sloppy play: Before either team had
reached double digits, six service errors had been
committed.
Stanford had more hitting errors than did Pa
cific, however, and the Tigers jumped out to the
first sizable lead at 12-7. Stanford managed to tie
the game at 18-18 and the two teams went point
for point until Pacific put together two points for
the lead. The Tigers scored four of the next five

to take the game 30-25.
After what seemed like a step back after a
huge victory over No. 11 UCLA (11-4, 4-2), the
Cardinal attempted to remember how to play
good volleyball again. Following the loss to No. 6
Southern California (9-3,4-2), when the Cardinal
came out flat, team captain and senior outside
hitter Ogonna Nnamani took the team aside and
talked with them about playing with fear.
"[Ogonna] talked about what fear is and how
it affects how you play," Suiter said. "When you
abandon all fear of making mistakes, you play
without inhibitions and so much better. You
can't be scared of anything, and you have to go
out in attack mode at all times."
Hitting over .400 as a team, the Cardinal reg
istered 16 kills and five service aces en route to a
30-20 victory in game two. Stanford dominated,
and a 10-2 run put them up 25-12. From there. Pa
cific put together a small run. but it was too little
too late as the Cardinal closed the game out on a
cross-court kill by senior opposite Jenn Hucke.
Unfortunately, Stanford's inconsistent play
continued as they again flip-flopped, playing a
soft and error-filled game three. With only seven
attack errors the performance was not as bad as
game one's, but it was still poor enough to allow
Pacific to take a 30-26 victory.
Stanford found itself trailing 12-9 after a Tiger
kill capped a four-point Pacific run. A service
error by freshman setter Bryn Kehoe gave Pacific
Game Three.
The team from game two showed up to play
game four, as the Cardinal destroyed the Tigers
30-16, to even the match at 2-2 and force a decid
ing fifth game. The Cardinal committed only two
errors in the game and hit an astounding .441 as a
team. Controlling things from the start, the Cardi
nal didn't miss a beat, running out to a 21-12 lead.
In the decisive game five, Stanford wasn't as
impressive as it had been in games two and four,
but the team played well enough to come away
with the victory 15-12, and the match 3-2.


MATT COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily File
Stanford's volleyball squad, including sophomore outside hitter Kristin
Richards, pulled off a fifth-game victory against Pacific to win the match 3-
2. The Cardinal upped its record to 12-4, but not before facing trouble; Stan
ford committed several service and hitting errors in games one and three.

mental slump

With the fast pace of a deciding
game, the team that makes the fewest
mistakes is usually the team wins.
Committing only one error to the
Tigers' five, the Cardinal pulled away.
Three consecutive attack errors
by Pacific junior outside hitter Ash
ley Groothuis gave Stanford a lead it
would not relinquish. Stanford had
match point at 14-9, and saw Tiger
middle blocker Sidney Bennett put
together three consecutive kills be
fore Cardinal captain Nnamani put
down a kill for the win.

When it was suggested that the
team might be experiencing a men
tal letdown following a big weekend
at UCLA, Suiter dismissed the idea.
"There's not a mental letdown,"
Suiter said. "There may be a physi
cal letdown because we're playing
five matches this week, but that's no
excuse. We've got to be mentally
prepared for all our games"
The Cardinal are scheduled to see
action this weekend against Oregon
State (8-6,2-3) and Oregon (9-6,1-4),
at home. Both games are set for 7 p.m.

When it was suggested that the
team might be experiencing a men

at UCLA, Suiter dismissed the idea.
"There's not a mental letdown,"
Suiter said. "There may be a physi
cal letdown because we're playing
five matches this week, but that's no
excuse. We've got to be mentally
prepared for all our games"

Would the real Stanford Cardinal please
stand up?
When the No. 12 women's volleyball team
(12-4, 4-1 Pacific-10) took on Pacific (10-4, 7-1
Big West) Tuesday night from Stockton, Calif.,
the squad looked almost schizophrenic. In a
Jekyll and Hyde performance, the Cardinal were
able to down the Tigers in five games and escape
with a victory.
The Cardinal, while clearly the more talented
team on the court, fought not only against a
sound Tiger squad, but a hostile crowd and their
own inconsistent play. Although it wasn't pretty,
a win is a win. Stanford showed itself as the more
capable team on the court. But the Tigers, play
ing fundamentally sound volleyball, were able to
make the contest competitive by pouncing on
Stanford mistakes in games one and three.
"For us it's a matter of coming out strong, and
that's been our problem lately," sophomore mid
dle blocker Liz Suiter said. "We came out strong
in games two and four and focused. Our passing
was good the entire time, and it's just a matter of
if we execute and how close we pay attention to
the other side."
A seemingly sleepwalking Cardinal squad
came out in game one. Both teams started out the
game with sloppy play: Before either team had
reached double digits, six service errors had been
committed.
Stanford had more hitting errors than did Pa
cific, however, and the Tigers jumped out to the
first sizable lead at 12-7. Stanford managed to tie
the game at 18-18 and the two teams went point
for point until Pacific put together two points for
the lead. The Tigers scored four of the next five

to take the game 30-25.
After what seemed like a step back after a
huge victory over No. 11 UCLA (11-4, 4-2), the
Cardinal attempted to remember how to play
good volleyball again. Following the loss to No. 6
Southern California (9-3,4-2), when the Cardinal
came out flat, team captain and senior outside
hitter Ogonna Nnamani took the team aside and
talked with them about playing with fear.
"[Ogonna] talked about what fear is and how
it affects how you play," Suiter said. "When you
abandon all fear of making mistakes, you play
without inhibitions and so much better. You
can't be scared of anything, and you have to go
out in attack mode at all times."
Hitting over .400 as a team, the Cardinal reg
istered 16 kills and five service aces en route to a
30-20 victory in game two. Stanford dominated,
and a 10-2 run put them up 25-12. From there. Pa
cific put together a small run. but it was too little
too late as the Cardinal closed the game out on a
cross-court kill by senior opposite Jenn Hucke.
Unfortunately, Stanford's inconsistent play
continued as they again flip-flopped, playing a
soft and error-filled game three. With only seven
attack errors the performance was not as bad as
game one's, but it was still poor enough to allow
Pacific to take a 30-26 victory.
Stanford found itself trailing 12-9 after a Tiger
kill capped a four-point Pacific run. A service
error by freshman setter Bryn Kehoe gave Pacific
Game Three.
The team from game two showed up to play
game four, as the Cardinal destroyed the Tigers
30-16, to even the match at 2-2 and force a decid
ing fifth game. The Cardinal committed only two
errors in the game and hit an astounding .441 as a
team. Controlling things from the start, the Cardi
nal didn't miss a beat, running out to a 21-12 lead.
In the decisive game five, Stanford wasn't as
impressive as it had been in games two and four,
but the team played well enough to come away
with the victory 15-12, and the match 3-2.

With the fast pace of a deciding
