# Runners ready to compete at Terra Haute
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a pair of solid victories at the Notre Dame Invi
tational at the beginning of October, Stanford's top
ranked women's cross country team and No. 2 men's
team travel to Terra Haute, Ind. this weekend to compete
at the pre-NCAA meet.
"The Notre Dame course was great for an opening
meet," red-shirt sophomore Jacob Gomez said. "It was
fast and gave the team a good feeling for running fast late
in a race. As far as the Pre-NCAA course, I feel like the
team is well prepared."
While the Notre Dame meet was a flat, fast-paced
course. Terra Haute is more strength-oriented. Coaches
as well as athletes agree that each meet has its own flavor
and that meets must all be prepared for with course-spe
cific goals.
"There are a lot of different variables to make the ap
proach to this meet different from last week's," women's
head coach Dena Evans said. "Each meet has its own spe
cific things that make it special, and that's what makes it
fun to prepare for each [one]."
Scheduled for Saturday, this meet will be run on the
same course that the NCAA meet will be held on at the
end of November. Saturday's meet will give both teams a
chance to become familiar with the course and will in
clude many of the top-ranked teams in the nation with
over 85 different teams competing. Nine of the top 10
men's teams will be present, with only No. 3 Arkansas
missing. Only No. 2 Providence and No. 5 Duke will be
absent out of the women's top 10 teams.
The presence of the other top-ranked teams doesn't
faze Evans.
"Through our perspective, we're just going to try to do
what we do in every other situation," she said. "And that's
preparing to put together a competitive situation regard
less of who's running well; we'll be prepared to compete
at our best individually and collectively regardless of
who's out there."

The women will compete in the 6,000 meter and the
men in the 8,000 meter race.
Jorge Torres of Colorado currently holds the record
for the 8k with a time of 23:34.8, and Shalane Flanagan of
North Carolina is the time to heat for the 6k, clocking in
at 19:36.0.
"We've run pretty hard this week heading into the pre-
NCAAs," said men's head coach Andy Gerard. "It's too
early to be peaking yet. but we are prepared to run well
and the results will hopefully reflect that,"
In last year's pre-NCAAs meet held in Waterloo Ind.,
current senior Alicia Craig nabbed first place with a time
of 19:52.6. Current senior Sara Bei completed the race
two-tenths of a second after Craig.
Competing this weekend are seniors Bei, Craig,
Jeane Goff and Anita Siraki. Also running are sopho
more standouts Arianna Lambie and Amanda and Katy
Trotter. Redshirt freshmen Julie Allen and Teresa
McWalters will be contenders in the meet, as well as
freshmen Lindsay Allen, Shannon Bergstedt and Lau
ren Centrowitz.
As both teams are defending NCAA champions, the
men have high standards set for them too; last year, Stan
ford executed the pre-NCAA race with confidence and
placed six runners among the top nine finishers.
While five of those six finishers were seniors who have
graduated, senior Ryan Hall returns to top his second
place performance from last year and looks to improve on
his time of 23:11.7 from last year's pre-NCAA meet.
Running alongside the lone senior will be redshirt ju
niors Neil Davis and David Vidal. Joining them will be a
squad of redshirt sophomores who will include Gomez,
Steven DeWitt, Brett Gotcher, Peter Meindl, and Jon
Pierce. Rounding out the men's team will be redshirt
freshmen Nef Araia, Joaquin Chapa and Lauren Jes
persen as well as freshman Garrett Heath.
