# The
						Double Clutch
## Hollywood does some good, some bad with Friday Night Lights 
### CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON 
As a suburban kid attending a small
Catholic high school in Seattle, I was
mesmerized with wonder at reading
H.G. Bissinger's documentary volume Friday
Night Lights. Fora year (1988), Bissinger fol
lowed the Permian High School Panthers in
the football-crazed Texas city of Odessa. I
could barely bring myself to imagine programs
with a hundred boys in uniform, playing in full
20,000-seat stadiums under the sharp glow of
white floodlights in an otherwise blacked-out
town.
Now that the book has become a film, I had
to see it.
The cinematography was intended to look
documentary in style, but no documentarian
short of Michael Moore could have afforded as
many cameras as they used. The shaky-hand
look quite frankly made me nauseous. I felt the
football scenes themselves left something to be
desired — rapid changes in shot angles seemed
to substitute for effective choreography.
The book was awash in rich, subtle details
— something the movie reproduces faithfully.
The character profiles were spot on: Quarter
back Mike Winchell is so ashamed of his
poverty that he allows no one into his house.
After a loss, "For Sale" signs are angrily lit
tered on the head coach's front lawn.
The filmmakers have done a terrific job of
portraying the pressure the kids are under, not
just in the town but also in their home life.
Winchell's mother pushes him with no relent
to earn a football scholarship. Fullback Don
Billingsley's drunkard father obsesses, some
times violently, about his son's propensity to
fumble. Tight end Brian Chavez tries to es
chew the lights and cameras and meet his
dream of attending Harvard. Running back
Boobie Miles tears up his knee, and. with no
skills but football, his future goes with it. And
everywhere they go, they are offered milk and
honey — praise, free food, alcohol and sex.
There were some bigger issues not touched
by the Hollywood version. The falling oil
prices of the late 80's crippled the West Texas
oil patch, sending banks into tailspins of fore
closure and default. In this context, fora city in
need of something to rally around, a football
team seemed as appropriate as any, and the
mania became a bit more forgivable, if not un
derstandable. Lights makes no mention, save
shots of rusted oil pumps on the roadside, of
this key economic factor.
The book also alleged that Odessa was a
city divided along racial lines, with the district
ing gerrymandered to funnel black athletes
into Permian. With the exception of an occa
sional slur that's far too common in modern
rap, this issue was glossed over.
Though 1 believe these omissions some
what damage the context of the story, an ade
quate treatment would have required a film of
its own.
I was worried about one aspect of the film
going in, something reinforced by seeing
Bissinger interviewed on NBC. He still ex
hibits the East Coast big-city elite attitude he
did when he wrote the book; he was a valiant
missionary, going into savage lands to show us
how uncivilized Odessa was.
Now, that's not to say there weren't seri
ously disturbing aspects to his story. I just
would have appreciated the chance to make
my own judgment, rather than being force-fed
his editorialization.
With this in mind, I feared the movie would
take on the character of a snuff film — setting
