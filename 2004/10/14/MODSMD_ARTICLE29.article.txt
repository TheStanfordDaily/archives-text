Cardinal tennis just keeps finding ways to put itself on the map.
Stanford is set to host the first Division I combined men's and women's NCAA tennis
championships in tennis history in 2006. The change, announced yesterday by the NCAA
Division I Men's and Women's Tennis Committee, was received well throughout the col
legiate world.
"This is a big step for college tennis," Chair of the Division I Men's Tennis Subcom
mittee Peter Wright told the Palo Alto Daily News.
Stanford Director of Tennis Dick Gould's goal to make the milestone event possible
has been in the works for almost 20 years and has cost $17 million in facility renovation,
according to Gould.
While Gould spent 38 years building the successful reputation of the Stanford tennis
program on the court, this innovation is his first high-profile act since he retired from
coaching last year to become Director of Tennis.
The Taube Tennis Center will house the 2006 championships May 18-19. This is the
fifth time the Farm has hosted tennis championships, the most recent in 2002.
The new format might also draw out more fans.
"I think inherently it will increase interest in the post season," said women's head
coach Lele Forood, who is also excited about hosting the championships again, as the
team has always been successful at the event. "Hopefully that will carry forward to get
ting more [viewers all-around]
In the past, men's and women's championships were held on separate dates and in sep
arate locations. This has not prevented the Cardinal from securing 30 titles in past cham
pionships, 18 men's titles and 12 for the women.
