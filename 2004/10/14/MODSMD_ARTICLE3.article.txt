WASHINGTON. DC. — As
Sen. John Kerry and President
George W. Bush took the stage at
Arizona State University for the
third and final debate last night,
Stanford in Washington students
were divided — but not along
party lines, necessarily.
One group of students enjoyed
the free open bar and the arcade
games at the Mortgage Banking In
dustry 2004 Presidential Debate
Party at the ESPN Zone in down

town Washington, D.C.
"Yeah. I don't really remember
any parts of the debate," said
Pallen Chiu. a junior. "But I pre
tended to be a swing voter so that
the Republicans hitting on me
could try to think that they influ
enced my vote."
The majority of the students
watched the debate from the edito
rial boardroom of the Washington
Post with Pulitzer Prize-winning
journalists Walter Pincus, who
teaches a course at Stanford in
Washington this quarter, and
David Broder. Just outside the
boardroom door. Post reporters

hunched over their desks, eyes
glued to TV screens waiting to
gauge the candidates' perfor
mances.
"It was nice to be around the
leading political writers in the
country, and we felt like our discus
sions were valued and could poten
tially influence the articles that
would be written within the next
few hours," said junior David Post.
For Junior Luis Vertiz, the
perks of watching the debate in the
nation's capitol were different. He
said the highlights of the night were

the drinks and flirting with young
congressional staffers at the ESPN
Zone.
"The combination of imported
beer and bedroom eyes, on top of a
presidential debate, made for an
ideal political function," he added.
"The only disappointment was that
flirting fell along party lines."
The students who watched the
contest at the Post had slightly dif
ferent priorities. Following the de
bate, students engaged in a debrief
ing of what they had just watched,
identifying the issues that were
most important to them in this elec
tion as well as who they planned to
vote for.
"After watching the debate I
don't think Kerry is responsible
enough to lead the country in terms
of Homeland Security," said senior
Melissa Ochsner. "I don't think

Kerry's use of statistics and throw
ing out numbers was a convincing
argument."
Junior Scott Thompson also par
ticipated in the Post discussion and
countered Ochsner's argument.
"I thought that Kerry appeared
more credible because he presented
more evidence for his positions,"
Thompson said. "Bush just came off
as arrogant and condescending."
Cheers flew up from the mostly
liberal crowd whenever Kerry took
a stand. The few Republicans
rushed to the defense of their candi
date and were equally enthusiastic
when Bush spoke.
The previous debates were fami
ly affairs of sorts — all the Stanford
in Washington students huddled
around the big-screen TV in the
lounge, snacking on cookies in the
shapes of elephants and donkeys.
