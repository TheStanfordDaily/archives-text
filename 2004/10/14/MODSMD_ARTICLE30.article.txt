# Men's golf struggles to capitalize on weak field
## 
### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
Perhaps the Stanford men's golf team
needs to play against some tougher com
petition. For the second straight event, the
Cardinal couldn't take advantage of a rel
atively weak field, and finished 10th out of
15 teams at the Alister MacKenzie Invita
tional in Fairfax. Calif.
Unranked Oregon State landed the
team title, seven shots ahead of No. 24
Purdue. Meanwhile, a final-round 67 pro
pelled Northwestern senior Dillon
Dougherty into a tie with Purdue sopho
more Bobby Bennett for the individual
crown.
After an excellent start to the season,
in which Stanford was runner-up to de
fending NCAA champion UCLA at the
Gold Rush, the team has struggled to
replicate its early success.
At 6,583 yards the par-71 Meadow
Club of Fairfax is one of the shortest

tracks the Cardinal will see all year. The
course, however, fought hack during the
two-day event, as only the victorious
Beavers of Oregon State were able to
gnaw their way to a sub-par final score.
Coach Conrad Ray's lineup was a mix
ture of youth and experience in Fairfax.
Freshmen Teddy Collins and Rob Grube
played in their second and third collegiate
tournaments, respectively, while sopho
more Zack Miller and seniors Pat Phillips
and Kevin Blue provided a veteran pres
ence.
Unfortunately for Stanford, a 15-over
par 299 in Monday's opening round
dropped the team into a hole from which
it was unable to escape.
"Tournaments are not won in the first
round," Miller said. "You can. however,
lose a tournament in the first round. I
think we have been too aggressive too
early, which has been our downfall. If we
can have solid starts, we have the talent to

he up in the mix on the hack nine on the last day."
Miller and Gruhe played solidly, shooting 72 and 73,
respectively in their first 18 holes. Their teammates,
however, were not so successful. The seniors. Blue and
Phillips, shot matching rounds of 77, and Collins round
ed out the scoring with a nine-over-par 80.
On Monday afternoon, the Cardinal struggled to
make up any ground on the leaders. With 11 teams
ahead of Stanford going into the second round of the
day, the Cardinal were forced to hope for help from
above in order to make a significant climb.
That help did not arrive. Despite a better effort in the
second round (294), Stanford remained in 12th place at
the end of the first day.
While the Cardinal tried to get on track, a battle
raged atop the team and individual leader boards.
Four teams (Oregon State, Purdue, Northwestern,
and California) finished the first two rounds within
four shots of the lead, each with good reason to think
it had the advantage.
Oregon State and Northwestern stood in a tie for the
tournament lead. Purdue, on the other hand, was the
only one of the four to boast a top-25 ranking, while Cal
ifornia was playing in its own backyard.

Ultimately, the Beavers separated themselves with a
solid one-under-par performance in the final round to
take the victory rather comfortably.
Stanford, too, played better on the final day, shooting
a seven-over-par 291 to climb into the Top 10.
Miller and Grube continued to lead the team with
matching scores of 72. Miller tied for 19th — his second
Top-25 finish of the season — while Grube was 27th
overall, just missing his third consecutive Top-25 to start
the year.
Blue notched a 73 on Tuesday, finishing in 39th place
overall. Despite a weak team performance, the senior is
optimistic about what lies ahead for the team.
"We've been disappointed as a group about our
showing in the last two tournaments, but we've got some
character guys on this team, and we're working hard to
prepare fora successful showing [at home]."
Collins and Phillips each shot their best rounds of the
tournament on Tuesday, 74 and 76, respectively. Collins
finished 66th, while Phillips took 74th overall.
The team will put the suitcases away fora while, as
the next event will be the Nelson Invitational Oct. 22-24.
Stanford will host the tournament at the Stanford Golf
Course.
