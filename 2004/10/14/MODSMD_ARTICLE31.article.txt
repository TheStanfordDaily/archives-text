# Rugby: playing for team's glory

Senior Molly Palmer has more
in common with Sally Ride than
most students at Stanford. Palmer
plays on the women's rugby team;
Ride, who later became the United
States' first female astronaut, was
an inaugural member when the
team was founded in 1976.
Ride is not the team's only fa
mous alum; several other alumni
have played for the United States
National Team.
However, for Palmer and many
of her teammates, women's rugby is
simply a way to play competitive
sports without the pressures of var
sity status. Palmer joined the team
her freshman year for this very rea
son.
Plus: "The girls on the team
were so cool," she added.
Fifth-year senior Shiyan Koh
seconded this opinion.
"It is the most diverse and ac
cepting group of people I've found
on campus," Koh said. "Engineers,
sorority girls, outdoorsy hikers, ac
tresses, pre-meds, everything. Peo
ple you wouldn't expect to find in
the same place, united by the love
fora crazy sport and the cama
raderie it engenders."
When most people think of
rugby, they often think of some sort
of cross between football and soc
cer. The sport actually has a much
faster pace than football, because
the clock never stops. And unlike
soccer, players can move the ball
with their hands as well as their
feet. There are four ways to score,
ranging from two to five points.
Because different positions re
quire different skills, players range
widely in height and build. There
are 15 players for each team on the
field at a time, with seven substi
tutes. Once a player subs out, she
may not return to the game unless
she left to tend to a bloody injury.
"Rugby is probably one of the
coolest sports out there right now,"
Palmer said. "I think it is a real up
and-coming sport, just beginning to

hit the U.S. In 10 years, I think it
might be like a new soccer."
At the moment, Stanford is at
the forefront of this movement.
The university boasts the only regu
lation international-sized rugby
field, called a "pitch," in the nation.
"Stanford women's rugby is con
sistently good every year because
we play as a team, and we work our
butts off," Palmer said. "No one is
out there playing for themselves.
We play for the glory of the team."
This philosophy works well â€”
the squad have qualified for the
Final Four of the National Champi
onships six times. The team won the
National Championship in 1999 and
won the National Championship
Plate Division in 1998.
"It's great to be part of a team
that is entirely student-run, yet also
nationally competitive," Koh said.
Last year, coach Rob Holder
came to Stanford from the Air
Force rugby team. He will be guid
ing the girls in their quest for anoth
er National Championship this
year.
While committed to being a
competitive presence against
strong rugby programs like UC-
Davis, Santa Clara University and
California, the team still welcomes
girls who have never even laced up
a pair of cleats.
They practice Tuesday and
Thursday afternoons from 3:45 to
5:45 p.m., focusing on training the
beginners during the fall.
"I just started the team halfway
through the year last year," said
sophomore Jennifer Hernandez.
"Joining this team has helped me
find my niche at Stanford. From
day one, the girls made me feel
completely welcome and like I was
part of a family."
The women's rugby season runs
in the winter, with regional and na
tional playoffs held in the spring.
Stanford's first home game of the
regular season will be Jan. 22
against UC-Davis.
The Final Four portion of the
National Championships will be

held at Stanford this spring, and the
team hopes to have a large fan
turnout.
"We play because we are hard

core, tough and great athletes,'
Palmer said. "'And we play to win
Could there be anything more excit
ing to watch?"

While rugby is often compared to football and soccer, it actually dif
fers greatly: The rugby clock never stops, players can use their hands
and feet, and points can be scored four different ways. Stanford
women's rugby, which kicks off its home games with a match against
UC-Davis in January, has been playing on the Farm since 1 976.
