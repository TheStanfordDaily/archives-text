# Axess tracks prerequisites for econ, chem classes
## 
### RISHI NATARAJAN 
The Registrar's Office is now helping some
University departments check whether or not stu
dents meet prerequisites. It is a move designed to
lighten the workload of individual departments
and to ensure that students are not dropped from
courses after classes are underway.
The new Axess feature, which was initiated
this fall, will automatically check to make sure stu
dents have taken the necessary prerequisite class
es for Econ 50, Econ 101 and Chem 130. The new
system was requested by the economics and
chemistry departments.
The Registrar's Office simply mechanized a
previously manual process in which members of
each department's faculty checked students'
course qualifications by hand.

"It was purely for the sake of efficiency," said
Assoc. Registrar Jackie Charonis. "Using tech
nology, when available, significantly decreases
[the department's] workload and is useful for
courses with hundreds of students.
"While 1 don't think that it's necessary for
smaller, upper-division courses, I can understand
why entry-level courses might prefer the [auto
mated] verification of prerequisites," Charonis
added.
The new service, she said, would also help stu
dents schedule their classes.
"The process currently is far better than in the
past," Charonis said. "Students would inevitably
get booted from a course three to four weeks into
the quarter, which would cause their schedule to
fall apart with the loss of a four or five unit course.
Now they know in advance what thev would oth

erwise inevitably find out."
According to Economics Prof. Tim Bresnahan,
the department only checks prerequisites for
Econ 50 and Econ 101 "for math skills at the be
ginning of the moderately quantitative Econom
ics core."
Moving the system online, he said, would free
up faculty for more academic pursuits.
"We automated the checks because it is a very
tedious task fora person and because individuals
questioning the system imposed substantial ad
ministrative costs on the department," Bresnahan
said. "I'd rather spend faculty and staff time on
teaching and on helping students."
Charonis said she does not foresee expanding
the service.
"No [other departments] have asked to have
prerequisites checked." she said.
