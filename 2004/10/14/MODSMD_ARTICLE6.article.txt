# After three months in Iraq, Diamond is back on campus, completing a book

### DAVID HERBERT DESK EDITOR 
Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution, is back on campus after a three-month stint
as a senior adviser to the Coalition Provisional Au
thority in Baghdad and is at work writing a book
about his experience.
Diamond said that he was in Iraq "to offer techni
cal advice on the drafting of the interim constitution,
to offer general advice on the transition to democra
cy and to foster democratic thinking" among Iraqi
civil institutions.
From January to April, he traveled the country to
lecture on democracy and advised the CPA in its ef
fort to democratize Iraq. He said that while he found
some signs of hope in the war-torn country, he left
Iraq discouraged by the failures of the CPA to secure
peace and frustrated by the unwillingness of officials
to take his advice seriously. He had originally
planned to return to Iraq in late April, but chose not
to after his disheartening stay.
"Iraq is an astonishing story of irresponsibility
and neglect," said Diamond, who faults the Bush ad
ministration and Department of Defense for poor

post-war planning.
Diamond said that while there had been some
strong coverage of the war and its aftermath in print
media, reports about Iraq's hostile climate, the un
cooperative nature of the CPA and the Bush admin
istration's blunders have been missing in the press.
"It is no longer possible for American or Euro
pean reporters to travel in the country," he said.
"Also, the CPA had a policy under [CPA Adminis
trator L. Paul] Bremer of keeping the media at arm's
length. The CPA was not welcoming of journalists."
The lack of media coverage, Diamond said, is
contributing to misconceptions in the United States
about the progress in Iraq.
"The American public does not grasp the depth
and scope of the lack of planning on the part of the
Bush administration," he said, adding that the Unit
ed States went to war with too few troops and insuf
ficient amounts of armored cars and body armor.
"People died because of these shortages."
Still, despite the faltering occupation. Diamond
found some cause to be hopeful about Iraq's democ
ratic prospects.
Poor planning plagues occupation, but
Iraqi hunger for democracy persists

"Iraqis are hungry for freedom and eager to
vote and choose their leaders, " he said. He re
called a speech about democracy he gave at a
mosque that drew over 1, 000 people, dozens of
whom submitted questions that Diamond an
swered in a forum discussion. "Their understand
ing of democracy was rudimentary, but they were
extremely receptive." he said.
Looking ahead to the American presidential
election. Diamond said that while both Bush and

John Kerry offer similar plans for Iraq, there exist
subtle but important differences between the two
candidates.
"Kerry would have a much better chance of
getting support of allies in Europe," he said. "In
addition, one significant difference, which the
press has not picked up on. is that Kerry has said
we have no long-term designs on Iraq. I suspect
the Bush administration wants military bases in
Iraq for the long-term."

Kerry's stance on the future of the country, he
said, was more likely to win over skeptical Iraqis.
Diamond also said that the war in Iraq has not
made the United States more secure.
"In my mind, unambiguously, we are less safe
than we were in March 2003 [before the invasion],"
he said. "It wasn't an imminent problem before.
Now, Iraq is less secure, the region is less secure, Is
rael is less secure, and a danger (exists] that Iraq
will become a Islamic fundamentalist state."
