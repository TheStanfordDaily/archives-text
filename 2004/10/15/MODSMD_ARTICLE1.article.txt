# LAYING IT ON THE LINE
## Cougars have a lot to prove in the coming weeks 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Washington State enters tomorrow night's matchup
with Stanford as a team that still has a lot to prove.
The Cougars and the Cardinal share identical
records of 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence. But for the Cougars, the Stanford game is about a
lot more than positioning in the conference standings.
The three teams Washington State has beaten —
New Mexico, Idaho and Arizona — are a combined 4-
13 this season, and of that bunch only Arizona plays in
a major conference.
The two teams to which the Cougars have lost aren't
much better. Colorado and Oregon are a combined 6-6,
with Washington State being the best team either
squad has defeated this year.
The game is also emotially important for the
Cougars, who will play before a sellout crowd at Mar
tin Stadium one week after allowing 27 fourth-quarter
points in a heartbreaking, 41-38 loss to a struggling
Oregon team.
"Oregon played well," Cougars head coach Bill
Doba said. "What I'm worried about is, I think we lost
a little bit of confidence.
"It wasn't anything they were doing intentionally,
they just panicked. We had a lead, the secondary
played a little soft, a little tentative, and we kind of got
out of our comfort zone there."
Oregon's Kellen Clemens threw for 437 yards and
three touchdowns and rushed for 69 yards and three
more touchdowns, so Doba knows how and where the
Cardinal will try to hit the Cougars.
"Last week, we gave up 400-and-some yards pass
ing," he said. "I imagine they probably will throw the
ball."
Deadpan aside, Doba and the Cougars know that
Stanford likes to air it out on offense. But they trust
their defense — which, prior to the Oregon debacle,
had not allowed more than 20 points in any game — so
the Cardinal's aerial attack isn't their primary concern.
For the Cougars to have success tomorrow, they'll
need to figure out Stanford's own staunch defense,
which is allowing just 16 points per game.
"The strength of their team is their defense," Doba
said. "They're all juniors and seniors, and they've
taken their lumps fora couple years, and those guys re
ally fly around to the ball well."
The key question for the Cougars is whether or not
they have the personnel to challenge Stanford's de
fense.
Sophomore quarterback Josh Swogger has been a
tough puzzle to figure out. He's thrown 12 touchdowns
against just four interceptions, yet he's completed a
paltry 46.5 percent of his passes and is averaging only
6.5 yards per attempt.
Given Swogger's inconsistencies, Washington State
likes to commit to the run — they've rushed 178 times
while passing only 184 — but they have yet to identify
