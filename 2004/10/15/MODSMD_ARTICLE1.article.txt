# LAYING IT ON THE LINE
## Cougars have a lot to prove in the coming weeks 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Washington State enters tomorrow night's matchup
with Stanford as a team that still has a lot to prove.
The Cougars and the Cardinal share identical
records of 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence. But for the Cougars, the Stanford game is about a
lot more than positioning in the conference standings.
The three teams Washington State has beaten —
New Mexico, Idaho and Arizona — are a combined 4-
13 this season, and of that bunch only Arizona plays in
a major conference.
The two teams to which the Cougars have lost aren't
much better. Colorado and Oregon are a combined 6-6,
with Washington State being the best team either
squad has defeated this year.
The game is also emotially important for the
Cougars, who will play before a sellout crowd at Mar
tin Stadium one week after allowing 27 fourth-quarter
points in a heartbreaking, 41-38 loss to a struggling
Oregon team.
"Oregon played well," Cougars head coach Bill
Doba said. "What I'm worried about is, I think we lost
a little bit of confidence.
"It wasn't anything they were doing intentionally,
they just panicked. We had a lead, the secondary
played a little soft, a little tentative, and we kind of got
out of our comfort zone there."
Oregon's Kellen Clemens threw for 437 yards and
three touchdowns and rushed for 69 yards and three
more touchdowns, so Doba knows how and where the
Cardinal will try to hit the Cougars.
"Last week, we gave up 400-and-some yards pass
ing," he said. "I imagine they probably will throw the
ball."
Deadpan aside, Doba and the Cougars know that
Stanford likes to air it out on offense. But they trust
their defense — which, prior to the Oregon debacle,
had not allowed more than 20 points in any game — so
the Cardinal's aerial attack isn't their primary concern.
For the Cougars to have success tomorrow, they'll
need to figure out Stanford's own staunch defense,
which is allowing just 16 points per game.
"The strength of their team is their defense," Doba
said. "They're all juniors and seniors, and they've
taken their lumps fora couple years, and those guys re
ally fly around to the ball well."
The key question for the Cougars is whether or not
they have the personnel to challenge Stanford's de
fense.
Sophomore quarterback Josh Swogger has been a
tough puzzle to figure out. He's thrown 12 touchdowns
against just four interceptions, yet he's completed a
paltry 46.5 percent of his passes and is averaging only
6.5 yards per attempt.
Given Swogger's inconsistencies, Washington State
likes to commit to the run — they've rushed 178 times
while passing only 184 — but they have yet to identify

Senior running back Kenneth Tolon is knocked out of bounds just short of poydirt in the Cardinal's 27-13 victory over Washington two weeks ago. Stanford travels to Wash
ington State for its first Pac-10 road game of the season tomorrow. Kickoff is scheduled for 7:15 p.m.
a feature back.
Leading rusher Chris Bruhn has just 239
yards and no touchdowns on 63 carries in the
Cougars' five games, with most of the damage
being done by backups Jerome Harrison and
Allen Thompson, who've combined for 62
carries, 304 yards and five touchdowns.
Washington State does offer Swogger a
solid group of receivers. Eight of Jason Hill's
17 catches have gone for touchdowns, and the
6-foot-2 sophomore is averaging over 28 yards
per reception. Four other receivers have
caught at least nine passes and one touch
down.
Another thing the Cougars have is a win
ning tradition. They've won exactly 10 games
in each of the last three seasons.
While they're not likely to reach that mark
this season, the team does know how to win
and expects to do so.
"We'll come back this week," a calm Doba
said Tuesday. "I didn't have to say much
[after the Oregon loss] . . . They took a look
at the video and they can see what they did
wrong."
Washington State also has a nice history
against Stanford. Each of the last three sea
sons, they came to Stanford Stadium and
handed the Cardinal a loss. This year, the Car
dinal will finally pay a visit to rural Pullman,
Wash. It will be the first visit to Martin Stadi
um for the majority of Stanford's sophomore
laden offense.
The Cougars are rather young themselves,
though, having returned just seven starters
from last year's 10-3, Holiday Bowl-winning
squad.
So while this year's Washington State-
Stanford showdown isn't quite the same as
2001's — when the undefeated Cougars
marched into Stanford Oct. 13 and handed
Stanford its first loss of the season, 45-39 — it
is just as important for determining the path
of the Cougars' season.
After Stanford. Washington State plays at
Oregon State, hosts No. 1 USC, travels to sur
prising UCLA and plays at No. 15 Arizona
State before hosting Washington in the
Apple Cup. Fortunately for the Cougars, they
do not have to play No. 7 California this sea
son.
A win tomorrow against the Cardinal
would do quite a bit toward securing the
Cougars bowl eligibility this season. Should
Washington State fall to Stanford, it would
need to win both the games it should win
(against Oregon State and Washington) as
well as one of the three games it wouldn't be
expected to win (USC. UCLA, Arizona State)
in order to become eligible fora bowl game.
Cardinal head coach Buddy Teevens
knows how much the Cougars have on the line
tomorrow.
"They are very competitive and are one of
the most physical teams on our schedule," he
said. "They are a well-coached outfit and
don't make many mistakes."
There's a lot on the line tomorrow for
Washington State, and both Teevens and

"Oregon played well," Cougars head coach Bill
Doba said. "What I'm worried about is, I think we lost
a little bit of confidence.
"It wasn't anything they were doing intentionally,
they just panicked. We had a lead, the secondary
played a little soft, a little tentative, and we kind of got
out of our comfort zone there."
Oregon's Kellen Clemens threw for 437 yards and
three touchdowns and rushed for 69 yards and three
more touchdowns, so Doba knows how and where the
Cardinal will try to hit the Cougars.
"Last week, we gave up 400-and-some yards pass
ing," he said. "I imagine they probably will throw the
ball."
Deadpan aside, Doba and the Cougars know that
Stanford likes to air it out on offense. But they trust
their defense — which, prior to the Oregon debacle,
had not allowed more than 20 points in any game — so
the Cardinal's aerial attack isn't their primary concern.
For the Cougars to have success tomorrow, they'll
need to figure out Stanford's own staunch defense,
which is allowing just 16 points per game.
"The strength of their team is their defense," Doba
said. "They're all juniors and seniors, and they've
taken their lumps fora couple years, and those guys re
ally fly around to the ball well."
The key question for the Cougars is whether or not
they have the personnel to challenge Stanford's de
fense.
Sophomore quarterback Josh Swogger has been a
tough puzzle to figure out. He's thrown 12 touchdowns
against just four interceptions, yet he's completed a
paltry 46.5 percent of his passes and is averaging only
6.5 yards per attempt.
Given Swogger's inconsistencies, Washington State
likes to commit to the run — they've rushed 178 times
while passing only 184 — but they have yet to identify

Senior running back Kenneth Tolon is knocked out of bounds just short of poydirt in the Cardinal's 27-13 victory over Washington two weeks ago. Stanford travels to Wash
ington State for its first Pac-10 road game of the season tomorrow. Kickoff is scheduled for 7:15 p.m.
a feature back.
Leading rusher Chris Bruhn has just 239
yards and no touchdowns on 63 carries in the
Cougars' five games, with most of the damage
being done by backups Jerome Harrison and
Allen Thompson, who've combined for 62
carries, 304 yards and five touchdowns.
Washington State does offer Swogger a
solid group of receivers. Eight of Jason Hill's
17 catches have gone for touchdowns, and the
6-foot-2 sophomore is averaging over 28 yards
per reception. Four other receivers have
caught at least nine passes and one touch
down.
Another thing the Cougars have is a win
ning tradition. They've won exactly 10 games
in each of the last three seasons.
While they're not likely to reach that mark
this season, the team does know how to win
and expects to do so.
"We'll come back this week," a calm Doba
said Tuesday. "I didn't have to say much
[after the Oregon loss] . . . They took a look
at the video and they can see what they did
wrong."
Washington State also has a nice history
against Stanford. Each of the last three sea
sons, they came to Stanford Stadium and
handed the Cardinal a loss. This year, the Car
dinal will finally pay a visit to rural Pullman,
Wash. It will be the first visit to Martin Stadi
um for the majority of Stanford's sophomore
laden offense.
The Cougars are rather young themselves,
though, having returned just seven starters
from last year's 10-3, Holiday Bowl-winning
squad.
So while this year's Washington State-
Stanford showdown isn't quite the same as
2001's — when the undefeated Cougars
marched into Stanford Oct. 13 and handed
Stanford its first loss of the season, 45-39 — it
is just as important for determining the path
of the Cougars' season.
After Stanford. Washington State plays at
Oregon State, hosts No. 1 USC, travels to sur
prising UCLA and plays at No. 15 Arizona
State before hosting Washington in the
Apple Cup. Fortunately for the Cougars, they
do not have to play No. 7 California this sea
son.
A win tomorrow against the Cardinal
would do quite a bit toward securing the
Cougars bowl eligibility this season. Should
Washington State fall to Stanford, it would
need to win both the games it should win
(against Oregon State and Washington) as
well as one of the three games it wouldn't be
expected to win (USC. UCLA, Arizona State)
in order to become eligible fora bowl game.
Cardinal head coach Buddy Teevens
knows how much the Cougars have on the line
tomorrow.
"They are very competitive and are one of
the most physical teams on our schedule," he
said. "They are a well-coached outfit and
don't make many mistakes."
There's a lot on the line tomorrow for
Washington State, and both Teevens and
Doba expect the Cougars to leave it all on the
field.
Washington State enters tomorrow night's matchup
with Stanford as a team that still has a lot to prove.
The Cougars and the Cardinal share identical
records of 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence. But for the Cougars, the Stanford game is about a
lot more than positioning in the conference standings.
The three teams Washington State has beaten —
New Mexico, Idaho and Arizona — are a combined 4-
13 this season, and of that bunch only Arizona plays in
a major conference.
The two teams to which the Cougars have lost aren't
much better. Colorado and Oregon are a combined 6-6,
with Washington State being the best team either
squad has defeated this year.
The game is also emotially important for the
Cougars, who will play before a sellout crowd at Mar
tin Stadium one week after allowing 27 fourth-quarter
points in a heartbreaking, 41-38 loss to a struggling
Oregon team.
"Oregon played well," Cougars head coach Bill
Doba said. "What I'm worried about is, I think we lost
a little bit of confidence.
"It wasn't anything they were doing intentionally,
they just panicked. We had a lead, the secondary
