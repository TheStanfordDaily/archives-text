University Provost John
Etchemendy outlined the anticipat
ed benefits of the Munger graduate
housing project at the first Faculty
Senate meeting of the academic
year.
Etchemendy said the new resi
dence, which is set for construction
in the summer, would enable the
University to improve the quality of
undergraduate housing.
"The goal is to 'unstuff under
graduate housing as much as possi
ble," he said, referring to the cur
rent practice of converting single
occupancy rooms into doubles and

doubles into triples.
Also, Etechmendy added, "We
would like to offer a guarantee for
every student that for at least one
year, probably their senior year,
they will be able to have a premiere
room."
Etchemendy also announced the
formation of a panel to monitor
gender equality and the quality of
life at the Munger residences. The
panel is expected to be ongoing.
Because Stanford's current
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions, Robin Manilet, plans to step
down at the end of the academic
year.
Etchemendy proposed the for
mation of a search committee to

find a replacement. He asked the
senate for member recommenda
tions for the committee, which he
will chair with the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John
Bravman.
He also announced an addition
al role undertaken by Stanford reg
istrar Roger Printup.
Starting last summer, Printup as
sumed the role of director of Stu
dent Informational Services, which
provides Information Technology
Systems and Services with student
data for programs like Axess.
The Committee for Review of
Undergraduate Majors submitted
its annual report for the 2003-2004
academic year.

Based on the committee's find
ings, the senate voted to approve
the renewal of the Interschool Hon
ors Program in Environmental Sci
ence, Technology and Policy for the
next five years.
In his first statement to the sen
ate as chairman. Robert Polhemus,
a professor in the humanities, set
out his goals for the year ahead.
He said he hopes to "foster in
creasing communication among
senate members and administration
leaders."
Polhemus urged the senate to
"be informed, take responsibility,"
adding, "I believe in faculty respon
sibility to their university. Institu
tions are, finally, people."
