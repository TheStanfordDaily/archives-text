# Buildings install life-saving equipment
## 
### MEGAN WATKINS 
Some buildings on campus will
soon receive an electric jump-start to
their public safety requirements.
Several buildings will soon be
equipped with automatic external
defibrillators, or AEDs, which can
be used to resuscitate people who
are experiences cardiac arrest.
Some believe that these devices
should be installed in buildings
across campus.
Sophomore Mark Liao of the
Stanford Student Emergency Medi
cal Service wrote in an e-mail that
departments must work together to
spread the cost of implementation
amongst themselves.
"It is my personal belief that
buildings, and not necessarily de
partments, should acquire, install
and train potential rescuers on
AEDs â€” I feel that one AED per
building is sufficient as one per de
partment may be a costly endeavor,"

he said.
In a newsletter published last
winter, the Department of Health
and Safety, which administers the
University's AED program, en
couraged departments to invest in
devices.
"While the cost of each device
runs from $ 1,500.00 to $3,500.00, the
benefit of a successful resuscitation
is priceless," the newsletter stated.
The department developed a pol
icy last year that outlined training
and maintenance requirements. The
policy also included information on
how to track where the devices are
located and how to train members of
the community to use them.
It is working toward identifying
AED locations on the Emergency
Evacuation Plans of the buildings
where they have been installed.
"It doesn't do any good to install
the machines if people don't know
where they are," the newsletter stat
ed. "We want to make them as ac

cessible and visible as possible."
Aside from the price of the initial
purchase, the electrode defibrilla
tion pads and its batteries need to be
replaced every two to five years, po
tentially costing up to $475.
Additionally, departments would
have to bear the cost if they choose
to formally train people as respon
ded, according to Liao.
The Department of Public Safety
and the Hoover Institution have
each chosen to put part of their bud
gets toward the purchase of AEDs.
The Department of Public Safety
has placed several devices in patrol
cars for use in crisis response.
According to Facilities Coordina
tor Kelly Doran, the Hoover Institu
tion felt it had special risks that war
ranted the budgeting for and pur
chase of an AED.
"We hold many conferences where
we host elderly guests," Doran said.
