## Marriage? Not so much 
### ERIN LASHNITS MARY STONE FEATURES COLUMNISTS 
Remember when one of the
Mendicants proposed to his girl
friend during their Spring Follies or
whatever they call that thing? Yeah,
neither do we, because we all
stopped paying attention to a cap
pella when Carmen Sandiego went
off the air.
But you probably heard about it
— not from any of your friends, be
cause your friends also stopped pay
ing attention at the aforementioned
time. Nonetheless, the grapevine re
layed the events of the night to you.
It went a little something like
this: The Mendicants were up on
their risers, doo-wopping in their

Little League
uniforms,
when a young
man, ski jump
hairdo freshly
gelled,
dropped from
the stage into
the darkness.
By the time
the spotlight
found our
young Romeo,
he was down
on bended
knee — that's

right, Boyz II Men-style, with velvet
box in hand. A gasp coursed through
the crowd, accompanied by a few
wildly inappropriate shrieks of joy.
And your columnists' reactions?
Upon the grapevine's arrival at our
door, Erin started hyperventilating
and almost lost all sphincter control,
and Mary, well, the corner of the
table caught her head on the way
down and she had to spend the sum
mer learning to walk again. But
that's a story for another day.
Regrouping, the summer months
gave us perspective on the situation.
Fresh from our therapy session at
The Bridge, we're here to explain to
you exactly what it was that was so
terrifying about those fateful mo
ments at Mendicantapalooza: the
very thought of getting married.
This was not an isolated incident.
We've heard of at least six other
couples going this route at the end of
graduation, and we're here to tell
you, this trend is not to be trusted!
Please hold for our arguments.
This is not 1950s Alabama. Ma
triculating at Stanford frees you
from shooting straight out of com
mencement into Elvis' Chapel of
Love. You should not be tempted to
ask your Senior Seminar T. A. about
china patterns instead of the solu
tion to question thirty-six on the
practice final.
Trust us, marriage is not the next log
ical step. In fact, it's just plain wrong.
You've spent four years at a uni
versity of 7,000 people, approxi
mately 30 of whom are good-look
ing, and only 14 of whom are attract
ed to members of the opposite sex,
and most of those are on the water
polo team (love those red speedos,
call me!).
Besides, marriage is downright
frightening. It's your-mom-and
dad-doing-their-special-kind-of-
hug-while-you-and-Benjy-the-
stuffed-lamb-watch frightening.
We ask you, what in sweet Jeho
vah is your hurry to tie yourself irre
vocably to some poor schlub for the
rest of your living days? And while
we're at it, let us clear something
else up.
Just because your soon-to-be-spouse
goes to Stanford does not mean that he
or she will be rolling in it like Bill Gates.
Your columnists plan to graduate from
Stanford in a few quarters, and we'll be
living happily in a van down by the river.
So if you or your girlfriend is con
templating taking the barefoot and
pregnant route, lend us your ear. In
stead of wondering if Snugglykins is
going to pop the question come
spring, tell Snugglykins you're going
to drop by some frat parties, and
maybe even do a keg stand. As the
Natty Light foam dribbles down
your chin, revel in your beer goggles,
and remember: when it comes to
bodily fluids, sharing is caring.

polo team (love those red speedos,
call me!).
Besides, marriage is downright
frightening. It's your-mom-and
dad-doing-their-special-kind-of-
hug-while-you-and-Benjy-the-
stuffed-lamb-watch frightening.
We ask you, what in sweet Jeho
vah is your hurry to tie yourself irre
vocably to some poor schlub for the
rest of your living days? And while
we're at it, let us clear something
else up.
Just because your soon-to-be-spouse
goes to Stanford does not mean that he
or she will be rolling in it like Bill Gates.
Your columnists plan to graduate from
Stanford in a few quarters, and we'll be
living happily in a van down by the river.
So if you or your girlfriend is con
templating taking the barefoot and
pregnant route, lend us your ear. In
stead of wondering if Snugglykins is
going to pop the question come
spring, tell Snugglykins you're going
to drop by some frat parties, and
maybe even do a keg stand. As the
Natty Light foam dribbles down
your chin, revel in your beer goggles,
and remember: when it comes to
bodily fluids, sharing is caring.
