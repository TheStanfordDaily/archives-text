# Hop 'til you drop...
## Stanford's fountains of youth 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
When the days are sunny and the heat is
just too much to bear, Stanford students often
dip into a nearby fountain. Aside from simply
being a pastime during hot days, fountain
hopping is a long-standing tradition at Stan
ford. The 12 fountains scattered throughout
campus are both decorative landmarks and a
source of entertainment.
"I remember one of the first things our en
tire [freshman] dorm did was to go running
through 'the Claw,"' said junior Ratul Narain.
"I couldn't believe I was running through this
giant contortion of a fountain when I was just
outside of there a few days ago buying my
books next door."
Narain recounted his first fountain-hop
ping experience fondly, saying that he was
glad to dispel some of the social awkwardness
that accompanies meeting a large group of
new people.

"It was cool getting
to know people by
frolicking and playing
like we were kids in
stead of just going
through these routine
ice breakers," Narain
added.
Maggie Kimball, a
senior librarian
archivist for Green Li
brary, said that the
fountains, which have
rich histories, vary in
the roles they play on
campus.
"It always strikes
me as being funny that
college kids get a kick
out of this fountain
run," Kimball said.
Correcting herself,
she added, "Oh yeah,
it's called fountain
hopping."
"They [Stanford
students) act like little
kids. While the foun
tains are magnets for
activity, they're also
places people go to be
mellow. It's a weird
relationship."
Splashing and
swimming is not the
only activity that
fountains attract.
Often used for pranks,
soap is a prankster's
favorite ingredient.
The soapsuds become
large snowball-like
objects rising 60 feet
in the air.
"The idea of
putting soap suds is a
little old," Kimball
said. Knowledgeable
in the fountains' histo
ries, Kimball is also fa
miliar with the lack of
originality in pulling
such a prank.
Dennis Nice, irri
gation spec leader at
Facilities Operations,
also notes the tremen-

dous cost of such a hoax. Between thousands
of gallons of water wasted and worker com
pensation expenses, the clean-up of some
pranks is a substantial effort.
"I've been here for 36 years, and there are al
ways about three or four times a year when suds
are put in some of the fountains," Nice said.
Nonetheless, as Nice notes, Stanford stu
dents are not completely unoriginal.
"There was one time when a bunch of gold
fish were dumped into the Claw," he said.
"And then there was one time when there was
a pig head put on the top of the Claw - it must
have come from some sort of luau and it was
just sitting up there on top of the fountain."
Nice also mentioned Cal's use of fountains
for Big Game rivalry - including coming in
and dying the fountain water bright blue for
Cal colors.
So what is all the hoopla associated with
these massive water beacons? Here is the
story behind three of the major water monu
ments on campus.

The Claw
The Claw, located in front of the Book
store, was designed by sculptor Aristides
Demetrios in 1964 to accompany the dedica
tion of White Plaza. Demetrios was commis
sioned to design the fountain in 1963. Funded
by the White family in honor of their two sons
who died young, the bronze and copper struc
ture can sprout water from 80 jets, though
most go unused.
While Demetrios' other sculptural works
can be found across Stanford, the Claw cannot
escape notice at the epicenter of campus. The
fountain is also the site for the annual impale
ment of a stuffed version of Osky, the Cal
mascot.
The Red Hoop Fountain
Though this fountain, located between
Green Library and Meyer Library, often
draws attention and has been assigned an as

sortment of strange names, the Shumway
Fountain - the official name for the popularly
dubbed "Red Hoop Fountain" - was actually
designed by a landscape firm that specializes
in water elements.
Tony Sinkosky, one of the principal land
scapes responsible for Shumway, also de
signed a hotel in Munich and a Boeing train
ing center. While creating quite the artistic
impression, Shumway is one of the only foun
tains not sculpted by an artist.
Water Clock Fountain - the "Timetable"
Located at the end of Serra Street, down
the road from the Tanner Fountain in front of
Hoover Tower, the water clock fountain can
be found adjacent to the Electrical Engineer
ing Center. Designed by Maya Lin, who is also
responsible for designing the Vietnam War
Memorial in Washington. D.C., the fountain
was completed along with the extension of
Serra Mall.

fish were dumped into the Claw," he said.
"And then there was one time when there was
a pig head put on the top of the Claw - it must
have come from some sort of luau and it was
just sitting up there on top of the fountain."
Nice also mentioned Cal's use of fountains
for Big Game rivalry - including coming in
and dying the fountain water bright blue for
Cal colors.
So what is all the hoopla associated with
these massive water beacons? Here is the
story behind three of the major water monu
ments on campus.

The Claw
The Claw, located in front of the Book
store, was designed by sculptor Aristides
Demetrios in 1964 to accompany the dedica
tion of White Plaza. Demetrios was commis
sioned to design the fountain in 1963. Funded
by the White family in honor of their two sons
who died young, the bronze and copper struc
ture can sprout water from 80 jets, though
most go unused.
While Demetrios' other sculptural works
can be found across Stanford, the Claw cannot
escape notice at the epicenter of campus. The
fountain is also the site for the annual impale
ment of a stuffed version of Osky, the Cal
mascot.
The Red Hoop Fountain
Though this fountain, located between
Green Library and Meyer Library, often
draws attention and has been assigned an as

sortment of strange names, the Shumway
Fountain - the official name for the popularly
dubbed "Red Hoop Fountain" - was actually
designed by a landscape firm that specializes
in water elements.
Tony Sinkosky, one of the principal land
scapes responsible for Shumway, also de
signed a hotel in Munich and a Boeing train
ing center. While creating quite the artistic
impression, Shumway is one of the only foun
tains not sculpted by an artist.
Water Clock Fountain - the "Timetable"
Located at the end of Serra Street, down
the road from the Tanner Fountain in front of
Hoover Tower, the water clock fountain can
be found adjacent to the Electrical Engineer
ing Center. Designed by Maya Lin, who is also
responsible for designing the Vietnam War
Memorial in Washington. D.C., the fountain
was completed along with the extension of
Serra Mall.

When the days are sunny and the heat is
just too much to bear, Stanford students often
dip into a nearby fountain. Aside from simply
being a pastime during hot days, fountain
hopping is a long-standing tradition at Stan
ford. The 12 fountains scattered throughout
campus are both decorative landmarks and a
source of entertainment.
"I remember one of the first things our en
tire [freshman] dorm did was to go running
through 'the Claw,"' said junior Ratul Narain.
"I couldn't believe I was running through this
giant contortion of a fountain when I was just
outside of there a few days ago buying my
books next door."
Narain recounted his first fountain-hop
ping experience fondly, saying that he was
glad to dispel some of the social awkwardness
that accompanies meeting a large group of
new people.

"It was cool getting
to know people by
frolicking and playing
like we were kids in
stead of just going
through these routine
ice breakers," Narain
added.
Maggie Kimball, a
senior librarian
archivist for Green Li
brary, said that the
fountains, which have
rich histories, vary in
the roles they play on
campus.
"It always strikes
me as being funny that
college kids get a kick
out of this fountain
run," Kimball said.
Correcting herself,
she added, "Oh yeah,
it's called fountain
hopping."
"They [Stanford
students) act like little
kids. While the foun
tains are magnets for
activity, they're also
places people go to be
mellow. It's a weird
relationship."
Splashing and
swimming is not the
only activity that
fountains attract.
Often used for pranks,
soap is a prankster's
favorite ingredient.
The soapsuds become
large snowball-like
objects rising 60 feet
in the air.
"The idea of
putting soap suds is a
little old," Kimball
said. Knowledgeable
in the fountains' histo
ries, Kimball is also fa
miliar with the lack of
originality in pulling
such a prank.
Dennis Nice, irri
gation spec leader at
Facilities Operations,
also notes the tremen-

dous cost of such a hoax. Between thousands
of gallons of water wasted and worker com
pensation expenses, the clean-up of some
pranks is a substantial effort.
"I've been here for 36 years, and there are al
ways about three or four times a year when suds
are put in some of the fountains," Nice said.
Nonetheless, as Nice notes, Stanford stu
dents are not completely unoriginal.
"There was one time when a bunch of gold
fish were dumped into the Claw," he said.
"And then there was one time when there was
a pig head put on the top of the Claw - it must
have come from some sort of luau and it was
just sitting up there on top of the fountain."
