## Editorial Kerry comes out ahead after debates 
### 
With 18 days left until the election and the
three presidential debates concluded, it's
crunch time for President George W.
Bush and Senator John Kerry as the two
vie for the top executive slot of the United States. Stu
dents should closely review what took place during the
encounters and continue to stay focused on the cam
paigns as election day nears.
The two appear to be neck-in-neck, as different na
tional polls now show the race to be a statistical dead
heat. However, it is safe to say that the three nationally
televised debates had a positive effect for Kerry, who in
creased public confidence in his ability to take on the
commander-in-chief role.
Kerry proved to be the more thoughtful and articulate
presidential candidate — not really much of a surprise,
considering even his critics have pegged him as a "liberal
intellectual" — although they have gone on to suggest
that he is out of touch with mainstream America as a re
sult of his impractical tendency toward abstraction.
But during the debates, Kerry clearly demonstrated
that he can be sympathetic to the needs of average Amer
icans and that he is knowledgeable about their issues. It
was refreshing to hear him cite specific facts in answering
questions, while Bush frequently resorted to repeating
generalities.
And although Bush cured his scowling and slouching
from the first debate, and his bursts of temper from the
second debate, his performance in the third debate still
could not match Kerry's.
According to a CNN / USA TODAY / Gallup sur
vey taken immediately after the final debate, Kerry beat
Bush 52 to 39 percent. And that was a poll taken with an
even number of Democrats and Republicans.
Also, 42 percent said they had a more favorable view
of Kerry after the debate and 15 percent less favorable.
For Bush, 27 percent said their outlook was more favor
able and 17 percent less favorable. In fact, Kerry bested
Bush in almost every category — "understanding of the
issues," "sharing of one's values," "most believable,"
etc. The only category Bush remained slightly ahead on
was "most likable," 48 percent to 43 percent.
The current election is a particularly crucial one for
college students nationwide, as a number of important
differences lie between the Bush and Kerry, both on
foreign or domestic affairs.
The gravity of the election has been noticeable even
here in the "Stanford Bubble," with students glued to
televisions during debate watching "parties." Al

though some might have been there playing drinking
games, listening for the next Bush-isms or watching for
Kerry karate chops, it is evident that students are inter
ested in the outcome of this race more than in past elec
toral cycles in recent memory.
Additionally, with the increase in public service cam
paigns by celebrities such as P. Diddy's "Vote or Die"
campaign or Jennifer Aniston's appeal to reach out to
women voters, both candidates have been doing more
to target younger voters nationwide — albeit often
younger voters in battleground states where the two
candidates will be focusing all of their time and energy
on up until Nov. 2.
Several issues came up during the debates that are of
particular relevance to college-aged students, a large
segment of the 18-to-24 demographic that typically has
experienced low voter turnout levels.
On the issue of the draft. Bush stated very clearly and
emphatically that there will be no draft while he is in of
fice. This is good news to males over 18 who may have
seen rumors on the "Internets" that there would be a
draft due to the lack of forces in Iraq.
Kerry countered by saying that there is already a
"back-door draft" in place that essentially keeps sol
diers in Iraq past the amount of time that they are sup
posed to be there. Yet Kerry himself has proposed ex
panding the military's numbers, and it is difficult to see
how he could accomplish this goal given the trouble that
the military has had recruiting new members in recent
months.
Also, during the debates, while Kerry highlighted his
potential to restore the United States' international rep
utation by bringing in an administration with a clean
slate, he did little to explain the details of what he would
do in Iraq and elsewhere. While notions such as his fa
bled "summit" sound nice in principle, Kerry must do
more to lay out the concrete components of his plan.
Bush did manage to use his sense of humor to his ad
vantage, drawing more laughs from the audience with his
wit than did Kerry — and for that matter, no, we are not
particularly interested in getting any "wood." However,
likability is not always the best way to judge a candidate.
For the college student contingent. Bush and Kerry
showed what they were made of during the three de
bates. Bush reaffirmed what everyone already knew
he would be more fun to invite to your next dorm social.
But Kerry achieved what he had to accomplish in order
to be competitive come election day — that he does in
deed have what it takes to serve as president.

For Bush, 27 percent said their outlook was more favor
able and 17 percent less favorable. In fact, Kerry bested
Bush in almost every category — "understanding of the
issues," "sharing of one's values," "most believable,"
etc. The only category Bush remained slightly ahead on
was "most likable," 48 percent to 43 percent.
The current election is a particularly crucial one for
college students nationwide, as a number of important
differences lie between the Bush and Kerry, both on
foreign or domestic affairs.
The gravity of the election has been noticeable even
here in the "Stanford Bubble," with students glued to
televisions during debate watching "parties." Al

though some might have been there playing drinking
games, listening for the next Bush-isms or watching for
Kerry karate chops, it is evident that students are inter
ested in the outcome of this race more than in past elec
toral cycles in recent memory.
Additionally, with the increase in public service cam
paigns by celebrities such as P. Diddy's "Vote or Die"
campaign or Jennifer Aniston's appeal to reach out to
women voters, both candidates have been doing more
to target younger voters nationwide — albeit often
younger voters in battleground states where the two
candidates will be focusing all of their time and energy
on up until Nov. 2.
Several issues came up during the debates that are of
particular relevance to college-aged students, a large
segment of the 18-to-24 demographic that typically has
experienced low voter turnout levels.
On the issue of the draft. Bush stated very clearly and
emphatically that there will be no draft while he is in of
fice. This is good news to males over 18 who may have
seen rumors on the "Internets" that there would be a
draft due to the lack of forces in Iraq.
Kerry countered by saying that there is already a
"back-door draft" in place that essentially keeps sol
diers in Iraq past the amount of time that they are sup
posed to be there. Yet Kerry himself has proposed ex
panding the military's numbers, and it is difficult to see
how he could accomplish this goal given the trouble that
the military has had recruiting new members in recent
months.
Also, during the debates, while Kerry highlighted his
potential to restore the United States' international rep
utation by bringing in an administration with a clean
slate, he did little to explain the details of what he would
do in Iraq and elsewhere. While notions such as his fa
bled "summit" sound nice in principle, Kerry must do
more to lay out the concrete components of his plan.
Bush did manage to use his sense of humor to his ad
vantage, drawing more laughs from the audience with his
wit than did Kerry — and for that matter, no, we are not
particularly interested in getting any "wood." However,
likability is not always the best way to judge a candidate.
For the college student contingent. Bush and Kerry
showed what they were made of during the three de
bates. Bush reaffirmed what everyone already knew
he would be more fun to invite to your next dorm social.
But Kerry achieved what he had to accomplish in order
to be competitive come election day — that he does in
deed have what it takes to serve as president.

With 18 days left until the election and the
three presidential debates concluded, it's
crunch time for President George W.
Bush and Senator John Kerry as the two
vie for the top executive slot of the United States. Stu
dents should closely review what took place during the
encounters and continue to stay focused on the cam
paigns as election day nears.
The two appear to be neck-in-neck, as different na
tional polls now show the race to be a statistical dead
heat. However, it is safe to say that the three nationally
televised debates had a positive effect for Kerry, who in
creased public confidence in his ability to take on the
commander-in-chief role.
Kerry proved to be the more thoughtful and articulate
presidential candidate — not really much of a surprise,
considering even his critics have pegged him as a "liberal
intellectual" — although they have gone on to suggest
that he is out of touch with mainstream America as a re
sult of his impractical tendency toward abstraction.
But during the debates, Kerry clearly demonstrated
that he can be sympathetic to the needs of average Amer
icans and that he is knowledgeable about their issues. It
was refreshing to hear him cite specific facts in answering
questions, while Bush frequently resorted to repeating
generalities.
And although Bush cured his scowling and slouching
from the first debate, and his bursts of temper from the
second debate, his performance in the third debate still
could not match Kerry's.
According to a CNN / USA TODAY / Gallup sur
vey taken immediately after the final debate, Kerry beat
Bush 52 to 39 percent. And that was a poll taken with an
even number of Democrats and Republicans.
Also, 42 percent said they had a more favorable view
of Kerry after the debate and 15 percent less favorable.
For Bush, 27 percent said their outlook was more favor
able and 17 percent less favorable. In fact, Kerry bested
Bush in almost every category — "understanding of the
issues," "sharing of one's values," "most believable,"
etc. The only category Bush remained slightly ahead on
