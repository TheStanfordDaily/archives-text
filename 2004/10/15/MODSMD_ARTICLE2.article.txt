# Cardinal seek first win over WSU since 2000
## 
### ALEX GYR 
As Stanford players walked off the field at Notre
Dame Stadium last Saturday after a 23-15 loss, the pre
vailing feeling was once again of what could have been.
"We went out and executed, but didn't

finish," said Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens. "We competed and put ourselves
in a position to win. We need to finish off
those games, and we will from now on."
The Cardinal (3-2,1-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) will look to make good on their
coach's promise as they head to Pullman,
Wash., for an important conference clash
with Washington State (3-2, 1-1) tomorrow
at 7:15 p.m.
While USC, Cal and Arizona State have
separated themselves thus far as the class of
the Pac-10, the battle for bowl bids between
the second tier teams remains wide open.
Even after last week's second-half let
down, the Cardinal are still very much alive
in their quest to play in a bowl game for the
first time since 2001.
The Cougars, meanwhile, have been ac
customed to the upper echelon of the Pac-10
in recent years.
Washington State is coming off three
consecutive 10-win seasons, including a spot
in the Rose Bowl in 2002 and an impressive
victory over Texas in the 2003 Holiday
Bowl.
The Cougars have struggled out of the
gate this season, and their 3-2 start is disap
pointing considering the results of the last
three seasons and a fairly soft schedule to
date.
Washington State, like the Cardinal, en
ters tomorrow's game off of a tough loss, a
41-38 setback to Oregon, and is trying to
avoid its first two-game losing streak since
2000.
Stanford is attempting to pick up a win

versus the Cougars after three straight losses against
Washington State, including last season's 24-14 loss on
Homecoming Weekend.
In last year's contest Stanford was able to keep it
close against the then-No. 8 Cougars, giving many fans
hope for the Cardinal's future. The Stanford defense
held Washington State to only 70 yards on the ground,
but was burned by 331 yards and three touchdowns in
the air by quarterback Matt Kegel.

While Kegel graduated and the Cougars are not as
imposing on paper as in recent years, the Cardinal
aren't taking this Washington State team lightly.
"They're a very solid football team," Teevens said.
"They come after you snap after snap and play very

hard."
This year Cougars are led by redshirt sophomore
quarterback Josh Swogger, who has 1,024 yards pass
ing and 12 touchdowns compared to only four inter
ceptions through the first five games of the season.
Swogger is attempting to fill the shoes left by Kegel,
who last season threw for 21 touchdowns while leading
the team to 11-2 record.
Senior Chris Bruhn leads the Washington State

ground attack, with Jerome Harrison and Allen
Thompson also receiving a fair amount of touches. The
Cougars are only picking up 100 yards on the ground
per game as a team, while allowing 130.
Sophomore Jason Hill is the Cougars' number-one

receiving threat with a team-high eight touch
downs this season. He is also averaging just less
than 100 yards receiving per game. Sophomore
Chris Jordan and junior Troy Bienemann have
also made contributions, picking up 206 yards
and 176 yards, respectively.
As for Stanford, it is clear what needs to hap
pen this week in order to compete with Washing
ton State: They need to score in the red zone.
Last week against Notre Dame. Stanford
twice had the ball within the Notre Dame 10-
yard line and came away with only field goals.
Flanker Evan Moore commented on the fail
ure to pick up touchdowns while in the red zone.
"That was huge." Moore said. "The differ
ence may have been not putting the ball in the
end zone in the first half. If we go up 14-0 on the
road, that's a whole different game."
The loss overshadowed a solid performance
by sophomore quarterback Trent Edwards, who
threw for 267 yards on 17 of 38 passes with no in
terceptions. On the season he has 1,188 yards
through the air with seven touchdowns against
four interceptions.
Against Notre Dame, the Cardinal weren't
able to effectively move the ball on the ground
with leading rusher J.R. Lemon picking up only
41 yards on 13 carries. Senior Kenneth Tolon
also struggled to find daylight with only eight
yards on four carries. Lemon is still averaging
75.4 yards per game on the season and has been
one of the Cardinal's more reliable offensive
weapons.
The Cardinal defense looked strong again last
week, holding Notre Dame quarterback Brady
Ouinn to only 176 yards passing. The Stanford de
fense has consistently impressed this season hold
ing opponents to a stingy 16 points per game.

Within the Pac-10 the Cardinal rank fourth in total de
fense and second in rush defense.
The entire Stanford squad knows that if the offense
can put some points on the hoard the defense will give
the team a chance to win.
"The mark of a successful team is the ability to go
away and get a win," Teevens said.
Stanford gets it second crack at doing that this sea
son tomorrow.

Junior linebacker Kevin Schimmelmann has been an integral part of a
Stanford defense that has allowed just 16 points per game this season.
