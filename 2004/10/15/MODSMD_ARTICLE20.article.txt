Yesterday, The Daily ran a piece entitled "Students
don't need alumni to uphold Stanford traditions" as an
op-ed on the opinions page. This should not have ap
peared in the paper, as it was not submitted to The
Daily's Opinions Department lor publication.
Rather, the text was originally sent to the personal e
mail account of a Daily opinions editor. The author,
Victor Madrigal of the Stanford Alumni Association,
did not .intend for the message to run in The Daily; he
sent it in response to questions posed by an editorial

board member about the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion's decision to no longer fund the Mausoleum Party.
Unless specified otherwise, any materials submitted
directly to the Opinions Department via e-mail (to
opinions@daily.stanford.edu or lettersC^daily.Stan
ford. edu), by fax or by physical delivery are considered
for publication in the opinions section. Any item not re
ceived through one of these channels should not run in
the section without the author's consent.
The piece by Madrigal, according to the Opinions
Department's submission policies, should not have
been published. The Daily regrets the error.
