## The 						chad's potentially dangerous legacy 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
Before November 2000, few
Americans knew about the chad —
hanging, dimpled, or pregnant. But
as surely as a blue dress and an ill
fitting glove symbolize historic
legal cases, the chad has come to
represent legal wrangling over vot
ing and the presidency in 2000.
Unfortunately, the chad lives on.
No, I'm not referring to the fact that
Instates will use paper ballots in this
year's election. The chad's larger
and more dangerous legacy is the
myth that voting must be uniform
and perfect; if not, the courts will be
come the election arbiters.
The U.S. Constitution makes vot
ing a matter for state legislatures.

not federal courts. Article I, Section
4, of the Constitution provides that
states will set the place, manner and
time of voting, expressly allowing
for state authority and diversity, not
federal uniformity, in elections.
But the chad's torturous journey
through state and federal courts in
2000 opened the floodgates fora host
of other legal voting challenges this
year. The question the chad raised —
whether certain balloting methods
are improper under the equal protec
tion clause of the Constitution — is
now posed in various forms across the
country, raising the specter of federal
judges overruling state elections and
creating national uncertainty.
Provisional ballots — a remedy
aimed at some of the 2(X)0 problems

— are already being challenged in
courts. Are differing state standards
for voter identification fair? II a
state uses paper ballots, or some
untested new voting technology, are
its voters' ballots more likely to be
lost, or not properly counted, and
therefore treated unequally?
Some go as far as wonder
whether the Electoral College pro
cess renders their vote less equal in a
state strongly favoring one candi
date compared with a vote in a bat
tleground state.
All these question are fodder for
the thousands of new volunteer
campaign lawyers and proactive fed
eral judges.
Must election processes he uni
form from state to state in order to be
fair? The U.S. Constitution clearly
answers no, expressly providing for
state liberty and diversity in voting
methods. Those who would prefer
federal uniformity in elections must
take that issue first to Congress,
which retains a right of oversight in
elections, and ultimately to the states
themselves to approve a constitution
al amendment.
Must voting methods be perfect in
order to be fair? Again, the answer
must be no. At the moment experts
cannot even agree on which method
ologies produce acceptable results.
Far more work and funding are need
ed to determine what really improves
the voting process, an effort Congress
only began with the Help America

Vote Act of 2002.
In the end, we need confidence in
our elections and democratic process
es far more than we need perfect or
uniform voting. Let the Constitu
tion's allocation of voting methodolo
gies to the states and the efforts of
Congress to identify and fund im
proved balloting processes do their
proper work. And let the campaign
lawyers and federal judges take an
electoral chill pill, allowing the presi
dency to be settled by processes the
Constitution established and the can
didates understood and accepted.
