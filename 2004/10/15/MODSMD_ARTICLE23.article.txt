# Readership Editor
## Fuzzy math adds up to The Daily being 1-for-2 
### 
Readership editors are not
supposed to lie. Statistics
are notorious for lying.
Thus I was in a pickle this
week after I crunched some numbers
about The Daily's coverage and was
left with statistics that revealed both
some good news and some bad news.
Though it's against my better judg
ment. I'll share my fuzzy math with
you — and spill the bad news first.
The Daily has run 17 editorials so
far this volume. Eight have been on
topics that at the time had not yet been
covered in a news article or have still
never been covered in a news article
this volume.
In this column two weeks ago. I
fired a shot across the paper's bow
when 1 discussed how this constitutes
journalistic bad practice by explicitly
favoring one side of a story without
giving readers a chance to consider the
other. Since that column ran, five of
the paper's 12 editorials have commit
ted the same offense.
In the last two weeks, The Daily
has called for changes in the Row staff
selection process, the reinstatement of
the Mausoleum party, an end to
mandatory bicycle registration and
claimed that changes to the freshman
advising system have fallen short
all without ever running a news article
on any of these issues.
This creates two separate worri
some problems, both for readers and
for the ability of The Daily staff to pro
duce a quality paper.
The first is that it is a disservice to
readers. Even on issues that don't
seem sufficiently timely or important
to warrant a news story, which should
make the reader wonder why they
then warrant an editorial, readers can
not gain a balanced understanding of
an issue through an editorial.
The Daily's number-one purpose
should be to inform readers of campus
issues in a balanced or at least rich con
text — a context that a lone editorial is
fundamentally incapable of providing.
The second and more pressing
issue is that unaccompanied editorials
push campus sources away from The
Daily. There are a small but not insub
stantial number of administrators, fac
ulty and students on campus who
refuse to be interviewed for stories be
cause they feel they have been misrep
resented in the past.
Sometimes this is because they
were taken to task in editorials —
without being given the chance to
state their side in a news article first —
and bore the brunt of what they felt

was unwarranted hostility from misin
formed readers. Even if a paper criti
cizes its sources, these sources need to
feel that their perspective and the facts
have been represented fairly.
This year The Daily's editorial
hoard has tried to mitigate these prob
lems by interviewing sources before

writing editorials,
which they hope
are then more ac
curate and take
into account the
viewpoint of those
they are criticiz
ing. However, this
still does not pro
vide sources an
opportunity for
their perspective

to be shared with readers in the nomi
nally unbiased context of a news arti
cle. And if this policy is not carried out
— which has happened at least once
during the current volume — then the
original problem remains.
For example, perhaps Julie Lyth
cott-Haims, Lorraine Sterritt and
Steven Zipperstein would not have
had to "clarify" the objectives of fresh
man advising in an op-ed in the Oct. 12
Daily if they had been interviewed for
a news article before the Oct. 7 edito
rial critiquing the program was pub
lished. Not only would this have given
readers the chance to learn about the
changes in advising made this year, it
would also have given them a context
within which they could consider The
Daily's editorial.
It also may have prevented a factu
al error about adviser compensation
and made these three individuals
more comfortable with contributing
to The Daily in the future.
But with all bad news comes some
good. In this case it has to do with au
dience, a topic addressed in e-mails I
received since my last column. One
was from a graduate student wonder
ing why The Daily, despite having an
undergraduate staff, did not write
about some features of Escondido Vil
lage that would be apparent just from
passing by it. This echoes perennial
complaints from graduate students
that The Daily gives them short shrift.
Some more statistics on the gradu
ate student coverage: since this vol
ume's Orientation issue. The Daily
has run 13 stories (by my count) deal
ing solely with undergraduate life and
five stories dealing exclusively with
graduate student life, including two
