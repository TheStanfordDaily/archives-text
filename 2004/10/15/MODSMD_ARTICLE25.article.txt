## Jeff Dorman Sucks! Don't count the Red Sox out just yet, idiot 
### 
We're all idiots here. We all have fun.
We all hug, kiss, grab, whatever."
— David Ortiz, Boston Red Sox
You're an idiot. You're a moron. You
wear wedding dresses to book signings. You
want hats for your bats. You bring Tonka
trucks fora road trip.

You know who you are.
Willie Mays Hayes. En
gelberg. Pedro Cerrano.
Dontrelle Willis. Mark
Madsen. Joe Kirchofer.
Rick "Wild Thing"
Vaughn. The Hanson
Brothers. Dennis Rodman.
Happy Gilmore. The Rally
Monkey.
Idiots. Morons. Winners.
The aformentioned
folks, whether real or fic-

tional. provided the sort of inspiration a win
ning team needs to succeed. They are the id
iots, the crazies or, as Apple would say, those
that "think different."
I mean, you can't forget recent history,
with Joe Kirchofer and his hasidic sideburns
leading the traditional Stanford basketball
team to a Pac-10 title, the Rally Monkey flip
ping and screeching along the Angels' way to
the 2002 World Series title, and Hayes, Cer
rano and Vaughn propelling the Cleveland
Indians to glory in "Major League."
And even though most available litera
ture on the subject allows for one, maybe
two, and only in special cases (read: sequels,
three-quels, etc.) three idiots on any one
team, I think that that could all change.
Which brings me to today.
Down 2-0 and under a mountain of histo
ry to dig out of, the Boston Red Sox have no
less than seven pure idiots on their squad, all
searching to find an answer to the Yankees.
But is this a case of too many cooks mak
ing a stew, or am I just butchering cliches in
order to write a puff column? The answer
lies in the details.
Idiot No. 1: Manny Ramirez
Ramirez, who is probably walking around
Boston wondering when the home run derby
