## Jeff Dorman Sucks! Don't count the Red Sox out just yet, idiot 
### 
We're all idiots here. We all have fun.
We all hug, kiss, grab, whatever."
— David Ortiz, Boston Red Sox
You're an idiot. You're a moron. You
wear wedding dresses to book signings. You
want hats for your bats. You bring Tonka
trucks fora road trip.

You know who you are.
Willie Mays Hayes. En
gelberg. Pedro Cerrano.
Dontrelle Willis. Mark
Madsen. Joe Kirchofer.
Rick "Wild Thing"
Vaughn. The Hanson
Brothers. Dennis Rodman.
Happy Gilmore. The Rally
Monkey.
Idiots. Morons. Winners.
The aformentioned
folks, whether real or fic-

tional. provided the sort of inspiration a win
ning team needs to succeed. They are the id
iots, the crazies or, as Apple would say, those
that "think different."
I mean, you can't forget recent history,
with Joe Kirchofer and his hasidic sideburns
leading the traditional Stanford basketball
team to a Pac-10 title, the Rally Monkey flip
ping and screeching along the Angels' way to
the 2002 World Series title, and Hayes, Cer
rano and Vaughn propelling the Cleveland
Indians to glory in "Major League."
And even though most available litera
ture on the subject allows for one, maybe
two, and only in special cases (read: sequels,
three-quels, etc.) three idiots on any one
team, I think that that could all change.
Which brings me to today.
Down 2-0 and under a mountain of histo
ry to dig out of, the Boston Red Sox have no
less than seven pure idiots on their squad, all
searching to find an answer to the Yankees.
But is this a case of too many cooks mak
ing a stew, or am I just butchering cliches in
order to write a puff column? The answer
lies in the details.
Idiot No. 1: Manny Ramirez
Ramirez, who is probably walking around
Boston wondering when the home run derby


Sp«n<er Porter
will start, is well known for not taking the game very
seriously. His hair flows freely, his smile is ever-pre
sent and while on the he bench points to center field in
an attempt to predict that every pitch will result in a
Boston home run.
He is frequently incorrect.
Idiot No. 2: Bronson Arroyo
Dubbed "Brandon Arroyo" by Fox announcer Tim
McCarver, Bronson Arroyo seems relatively normal.
He is Boston's No. 3 (now No. 2) starter, has nasty
movement on his fastball and is a solid young pitcher.
Until he takes off his hat. For then you will see that he
is a very white man, and he has cornrows. Justin Tim
berlake is jealous.
Idiot No. 3: David Ortiz
Ortiz, also known as "Papi," is Manny's right-hand
man, and singlehandedly carried my fantasy team this
year. Apparently, he also enjoys kissing and grabbing
his teammates, taking the "good guy to have around
the clubhouse" award.
Idiot No. 4: Kevin Millar
Cowboy Up.
Idiot No. 5: Jonny "The Passion of the" Damon.
Somewhere, Joan Osborne has an answer — he
would lead off for the Red Sox.
Idiot No. 6: Trot Nixon
Trot may not be considered a "traditional" idiot,
but after winning a game in last year's ALDS with a
walk-off bomb, he claimed that he didn't swing, the
Lord did. Hev. crazv idiots are still idiots.

Idiot No. 7: Pedro Martinez.
Who's Pedro's baby's daddy's fatha? Rinc, Rinc,
Rincona — The Yankees. But don't worry Boston,
Pedro has a 2()-inch-tall friend that he brings around
the clubhouse as his good luck charm. Seriously.
So will Boston come back and win it all?
In a word, yes. It will be the greatest comeback of
any postseason, but the Red Sox will sweep at Fenway,
lose Game 6 and win Game 7. In New York, Damon
will go three-for-four. Manny will have a two-run shot,
and Ortiz will clinch it with a three-run shot off Flash
Gordon.
Seriously, I'm not counting the Sox out, even with
Schilling hurt. For all you Sports Guy fans out there,
Schilling's injury is a classic case of the Ewing theory (a
theory that states that when the star player on a team
goes down and everyone counts them out, inexplica
bly, the team starts playing a whole lot better — think
the Texas Rangers post A-Rod. the Oakland A's post
Giambi, the Seattle Mariners post Griffey and A-
Rod).
With their star pitcher out, the rest of the Red
Sox will pick him up, playing the best baseball of
their careers.
Hey, even idiots can keep the faith.
Spcncer Porter is indeed an idiot, but to his credit he's
smarter than this sports editor for not editing on Senior
Pub Night. E-mail him at porters@stanford.edu.

Why's Millar an idiot?
'Cowboy Up.' 6 Nuff said.
