# Hungry water polo hosts Irvine
## Cardinal hope to suck up No. 8 Anteaters, stake claim for No. 1 national ranking 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
This week there's one thing dominating the minds of the
No. 2 Stanford men's water polo squad (11-2,1-0 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation): winning a game they certainly
should not lose.
The Cardinal will face No. 8 UC-Irvine (8-7,0-1) on Sat
urday at the Avery Aquatic Center. While the Anteaters
are formidable opponents, Stanford expects to win its sec
ond conference match of the season.
"It's really important [that we win this game]," said ju
nior goalkeeper Chad Taylor. "We can't really give up any
MPSF games, especially to a team like [Irvine]... To keep
our momentum going we have to keep winning. You don't
want to let a team beat you when they probably shouldn't."
After going a week without a big game, the Cardinal
squad has been practicing hard in preparation for the
Anteaters.
A win is "absolutely crucial," said junior driver Peter
Varellas. "This week that's everything for us.
"We match up pretty well with [Irvine]. We've got some
great defenders to match up with their three best players —
and that's basically what they have, three offensive
threats."
Varellas was referring to Irvine's trio of junior Barry
Dreason and seniors Rick Merlo and Dan Noon.
Dreason leads the Anteaters in scoring with 36 goals,
while Merlo has tallied 35. The Cardinal will focus on sin
gling out the Anteaters' go-to guys — Dreason, Merlo and
Noon — to get the matchups they want, which is key to tak
ing care of Irvine.
Stanford All-American driver Tony Azevedo, sopho
more defender J.J Garton. senior driver Matt Moser and ju
nior driver Thomas Hopkins will look to neutralize the
Anteaters' offensive weapons.
The Cardinal have added motivation after they lost their
hold on the number one spot two weekends ago in a gut
wrenching 10-9 overtime loss at the Northern California
Tournament. Facing UCLA, the Cardinal could not cap the
victory and failed to earn a tournament title for the second
time this year.
"We definitely look to get back up at No. 1," Taylor
said. "It's not as important as it is near the end of the sea
son, but it does help the attitude you have, and how every
one else looks at you being No. 1 is nice. But we're really
trying for the at-large bid ... before we go to our confer
ence tournament."
Despite sitting at No. 2 for the moment, Stanford has
continued to dominate its conference opponents, as evi
denced by the latest MPSF statistics. The Cardinal's de
fense and offense both rank No. 1 in the conference.

"Our offense helps our defense by the fact that they
score, and we don't have to counter the defense," Taylor
said. "But our defense actually helps our offense a lot by
creating counterattack opportunities and by really wear
ing down the other team. We really pride ourselves on our
defense."
Taylor leads the league in goals allowed average with a
5.17 mark. In 12 games, the junior has 83 saves and has al
lowed only 62 goals, the least among other starting goal
keepers. Fellow Stanford goalkeepers Beau Stockstill and
Sandy Hohener have combined with Taylor for 106 saves
on the season.
Since the Cardinal defense certainly provides enough
opportunities for its offense, Stanford's scoring weapons
have taken as much advantage as they can. The team leads
the MPSF in goals, with 164 thus far. At an average of 12.62
goals per game to their competitors' 6.15. the squad usually
has quite the lead on its opponents.
Hopkins, Varellas and Azevedo have been the key of
fensive contributors for the Cardinal this season. Hopkins

sits at No. 2 in the conference with 2.62 goals per game, fol
lowed by Azevedo who has 2.45.
Looming on the horizon already are the NCAA cham
pionships, Stanford's ultimate season goal. At this point,
the focus will be on trying to wrap-up an at-large bid before
the MPSF tournament.
"What that means for us is having a better record, fewer
losses, better head-to-head games and records against cer
tain teams like California, USC, UCLA — those are the big
other three," Varellas said.
Stanford has already defeated the Trojans in a confer
ence game, so its chances of receiving the at-large bid ap
pear good. The Cardinal have yet to play the Bruins in a
conference match, which it will do in three weeks, and is set
to face Cal twice before the regular season ends.
"Those three games are going to be more than anything
the most important for us and, of course, this weekend we
have to take care of Irvine," Varellas added.
Following Saturday's noon game, the Cardinal travel to
No. 14 UC-Davis (11-9) Sunday.
