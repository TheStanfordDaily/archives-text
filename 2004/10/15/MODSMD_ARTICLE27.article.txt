# Men's soccer preps for pair of showdowns with UC-Davis, UCLA
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW 
Even after a difficult conference road
trip to the northwest, the schedule does not
get any easier for the Stanford men's soc
cer team (6-1-4,1-0-2 Pacific-10). The Car
dinal return to Maloney Field this weekend
with two major obstacles in their way; the
tendency to look past UC-Davis, and host
ing perennial national power and Stanford
nemesis UCLA.
Stanford is undefeated in its last four
games, but three of those games have
ended in deadlocks (1-0-3), with its lone
win coming on a last-minute goal from
Darren Fernandez against Oregon State.
"We've had three ties in the last four
games and we need to get on the track to
win more games," said sophomore goal
keeper Andrew Kartunen.
Getting back on a winning streak will be
very difficult with UCLA (5-2-2,1-1-0 Pac
-10) coming to town. Stanford has not beat
en the Bruins since the 2000 season, includ
ing a loss in the 2002 College Cup. But the
first order of business will be UC-Davis (4-
6-1), which travels to the Farm fora 5 p.m.
game tonight fresh off a 1 -0 loss to Cal State
Fullerton.
"We cannot look past UC-Davis with

the UCLA game on Sunday, because if
we're not careful, they have the ability to
sneak up on us and beat us." said head
coach Bret Simon.
Though Stanford has not faced the Ag
gies during the regular season since 1990,
the teams are plenty familiar with each
other after facing off in a scrimmage last
spring.
"They are a well-organized team that
plays with passion," Simon said. "They
have dangerous attacking players and are
extremely well coached."
Returning players remember how close
the last UC-Davis game was, and they want
to make sure they take control early.
"We played them over the spring in a
close match (a 1-0 Cardinal victory)," Kar
tunen said. "They have a strong defense
and we need to break that down early. The
longer we holdout on scoring the more dif
ficult it will become."
After UC-Davis, the real test begins for
the Cardinal as UCLA makes the trip up
from Los Angeles after taking the week
end off from play. The Bruins have domi
nated the all-time series against Stanford
(23-3-2).
"They are year-in and year-out one of
the most talented teams in the country,"

Simon said. "Southern California is proba
bly the best region for soccer in the country
and UCLA gets to reap the benefits of that.
Their depth is very impressive."
In order to be successful, the Cardinal
must play a meticulous game.
"We have a new team and we're in the
process of learning new roles," said Simon.
"But we need to be at our best for the full
90 minutes, because they make you pay for
being sleepy, even if only for an instant.
We need to treat this as a game against any
other team, but be sharper."
"They are really good all around, with
an especially powerful offense," Kartunen
said. "We must defend well and create op
portunities when we can."
Still, the team is not awed by the storied
history of UCLA soccer. In fact, they see
this as a year to get back a victory.
"They are a big rival of ours," Kartunen
said. "This is definitely a year that we can
beat them. We should've beaten them two
years ago and now I think we can go fora
win."
Stanford has many reasons to believe it
can beat UCLA. First, the Cardinal boast
the Pac-10's current leading scorer, Darren
Fernandez with seven goals. Secondly, the
team has finally meshed and been able to

incorporate all players, including the fresh
men and transfers, into the system.
"An unfortunate thing is we never get to
play with the new freshmen and mend as a
team before the fall," said Kartunen.
"However, we've started to mend as a
team, everyone knows their roles, includ
ing the freshmen, and everyone accepts
their lot."
The team is also working on putting
games away, a problem that was evident in
the past road trip where Stanford gave up
leads to both Oregon State and Washing
ton in the second half.
"We need to improve on closing out
games," Kartunen said. "We were unable
to hold the lead against Oregon State,
thankfully Darren [Fernandez] was able to
bail us out. It is very important for us to
learn how to hold leads."
The coaching staff believes there is no
quick fix to learning how to put games
away.
"The ability to put away games is not
automatic and it comes with experience,"
Simon said. "Game after game you need to
make the right decisions and you will de
velop that skill. It takes time and you will
make mistakes, but if you also have success
you will improve."

6-1), which travels to the Farm fora 5 p.m.
game tonight fresh off a 1 -0 loss to Cal State
Fullerton.
"We cannot look past UC-Davis with

the UCLA game on Sunday, because if
we're not careful, they have the ability to
sneak up on us and beat us." said head
coach Bret Simon.
Though Stanford has not faced the Ag
gies during the regular season since 1990,
the teams are plenty familiar with each
other after facing off in a scrimmage last
spring.
"They are a well-organized team that
plays with passion," Simon said. "They
have dangerous attacking players and are
extremely well coached."
Returning players remember how close
the last UC-Davis game was, and they want
to make sure they take control early.
"We played them over the spring in a
close match (a 1-0 Cardinal victory)," Kar
tunen said. "They have a strong defense
and we need to break that down early. The
longer we holdout on scoring the more dif
ficult it will become."
After UC-Davis, the real test begins for
the Cardinal as UCLA makes the trip up
from Los Angeles after taking the week
end off from play. The Bruins have domi
nated the all-time series against Stanford
(23-3-2).
"They are year-in and year-out one of
the most talented teams in the country,"

Simon said. "Southern California is proba
bly the best region for soccer in the country
and UCLA gets to reap the benefits of that.
Their depth is very impressive."
In order to be successful, the Cardinal
must play a meticulous game.
"We have a new team and we're in the
process of learning new roles," said Simon.
"But we need to be at our best for the full
90 minutes, because they make you pay for
being sleepy, even if only for an instant.
We need to treat this as a game against any
other team, but be sharper."
"They are really good all around, with
an especially powerful offense," Kartunen
said. "We must defend well and create op
portunities when we can."
Still, the team is not awed by the storied
history of UCLA soccer. In fact, they see
this as a year to get back a victory.
"They are a big rival of ours," Kartunen
said. "This is definitely a year that we can
beat them. We should've beaten them two
years ago and now I think we can go fora
win."
Stanford has many reasons to believe it
can beat UCLA. First, the Cardinal boast
the Pac-10's current leading scorer, Darren
Fernandez with seven goals. Secondly, the
team has finally meshed and been able to

incorporate all players, including the fresh
men and transfers, into the system.
"An unfortunate thing is we never get to
play with the new freshmen and mend as a
team before the fall," said Kartunen.
"However, we've started to mend as a
team, everyone knows their roles, includ
ing the freshmen, and everyone accepts
their lot."
The team is also working on putting
games away, a problem that was evident in
the past road trip where Stanford gave up
leads to both Oregon State and Washing
ton in the second half.
"We need to improve on closing out
games," Kartunen said. "We were unable
to hold the lead against Oregon State,
thankfully Darren [Fernandez] was able to
bail us out. It is very important for us to
learn how to hold leads."
The coaching staff believes there is no
quick fix to learning how to put games
away.
"The ability to put away games is not
automatic and it comes with experience,"
Simon said. "Game after game you need to
make the right decisions and you will de
velop that skill. It takes time and you will
make mistakes, but if you also have success
you will improve."

Bret Shimizu and the men's soccer team put their
four-game unbeaten streak on the line this weekend.
Even after a difficult conference road
trip to the northwest, the schedule does not
get any easier for the Stanford men's soc
cer team (6-1-4,1-0-2 Pacific-10). The Car
dinal return to Maloney Field this weekend
with two major obstacles in their way; the
tendency to look past UC-Davis, and host
ing perennial national power and Stanford
nemesis UCLA.
Stanford is undefeated in its last four
games, but three of those games have
ended in deadlocks (1-0-3), with its lone
win coming on a last-minute goal from
Darren Fernandez against Oregon State.
"We've had three ties in the last four
games and we need to get on the track to
win more games," said sophomore goal
keeper Andrew Kartunen.
Getting back on a winning streak will be
very difficult with UCLA (5-2-2,1-1-0 Pac
-10) coming to town. Stanford has not beat
en the Bruins since the 2000 season, includ
ing a loss in the 2002 College Cup. But the
first order of business will be UC-Davis (4-
6-1), which travels to the Farm fora 5 p.m.
