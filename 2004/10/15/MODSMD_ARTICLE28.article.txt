# Cardinal look to keep pace in Pac-10 at home

Parity is a word that is thrown around a lot
in sporting circles — women's volleyball is
no exception — but nowhere is it more ap
parent than in the top-loaded Pacific-10 Con
ference, featuring six teams ranked in the
Top 25 nationally, with five in the top 15.
At the moment, the Washington Huskies
are in control, with a perfect 5-0 conference
record. But their dominance is anything but
assured, as there are four teams within two
wins of the top. This conference is one of the
most competitive in the country, and on any
given day, anything can happen.
There is no better illustration of this than
last weekend's matches between the Bay
Area and Los Angeles schools. No. 2 South
ern California beat No. 14 Stanford, which
upset No. 10 UCLA. The Bruins in turn beat

No. 17 California, which surprised everyone
with a 3-0 victory over USC. Stanford and
Cal both improved their rankings with these
results, and USC and UCLA stayed very
highly ranked.
This weekend's matches are not likely to
be as even, with the Cardinal hosting un
ranked Oregon State and Oregon on Friday
and Saturday, with both matches played in
Burnham Pavilion at 7 p.m.
The Cardinal come in with a record of 11-
4,4-1 Pac-10, their only conference loss com
ing against USC last Friday. Against confer
ence teams, Stanford has been nothing but
solid so far this season, dispatching both Ari
zona schools in straight games, beating Cal in
a five-game thriller, and upsetting UCLA by
a score of 3-1.
There is no denying that the Cardinal are
