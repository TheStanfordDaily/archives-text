# Cardinal look to keep pace in Pac-10 at home
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW 
Parity is a word that is thrown around a lot
in sporting circles — women's volleyball is
no exception — but nowhere is it more ap
parent than in the top-loaded Pacific-10 Con
ference, featuring six teams ranked in the
Top 25 nationally, with five in the top 15.
At the moment, the Washington Huskies
are in control, with a perfect 5-0 conference
record. But their dominance is anything but
assured, as there are four teams within two
wins of the top. This conference is one of the
most competitive in the country, and on any
given day, anything can happen.
There is no better illustration of this than
last weekend's matches between the Bay
Area and Los Angeles schools. No. 2 South
ern California beat No. 14 Stanford, which
upset No. 10 UCLA. The Bruins in turn beat

No. 17 California, which surprised everyone
with a 3-0 victory over USC. Stanford and
Cal both improved their rankings with these
results, and USC and UCLA stayed very
highly ranked.
This weekend's matches are not likely to
be as even, with the Cardinal hosting un
ranked Oregon State and Oregon on Friday
and Saturday, with both matches played in
Burnham Pavilion at 7 p.m.
The Cardinal come in with a record of 11-
4,4-1 Pac-10, their only conference loss com
ing against USC last Friday. Against confer
ence teams, Stanford has been nothing but
solid so far this season, dispatching both Ari
zona schools in straight games, beating Cal in
a five-game thriller, and upsetting UCLA by
a score of 3-1.
There is no denying that the Cardinal are

performing very well in the stacked
Pac-10, where they are in sole pos
session of the second spot.
The problems, however, have
come in some non-conference games
against unranked teams. The Cardinal
have lost two matches to St. Mary s,
which only recently entered the Top
25 and has been moving up steadily.
Pacific gave Stanford a scare this Tues
day, pushing what should have been
an easy Cardinal victory to five games.
Though they have excelled in every
other facet of the game, consistency
still eludes Stanford.
This weekend is the beginning of
six straight weeks of Pac-10 play, so
the team will hope to leave its non
conference troubles behind. Consis
tency will be a deciding factor in the
success of the Cardinal this season
as they look ahead to six matches
against ranked opponents in as
many weeks. Playing against Ore
gon State and Oregon should enable
Stanford to work out any kinks be
fore heading into the thick of the
Pac-10 schedule.
Senior Allison Lawrence and
sophomore Abby Windell lead the
Beavers (8-6, 2-3 Pac-10) offensive
ly. Lawrence is the team's leading
hitter, having recently tallied the
1 .(KXJth kill of her career. Windell
had 16 kills in last week's loss to Ari
zona and is hitting .426 against Pac

10 opponents, with an impressive
.571 in a losing effort against Ari
zona State. Junior setter Desma Sto
vall is averaging nearly 12 assists per
game and freshman libcro Nina Bal
timore leads the team in passing with
an average 3.36 digs per game.
Oregon State, which has not
beaten Stanford in 38 all-time
matches, is hoping to end a three
game losing streak in the Pac-10
which has left it sixth in the confer
ence. The team's only two confer
ence victories came against Oregon
and winless Washington State.
The leading hitter for Oregon (9-
6, 1-4 Pac-10) is Sarah Mason, a
sophomore outside hitter with 193
kills on the season. Running a close
second is senior Lauren Westendorf,
with 182 kills. Westendorf is also the
team's leading server with 29 aces.
Mason and Kim McNally lead the
blocking effort for the Ducks with 37
total blocks apiece. Setter Heather
Madison is averaging over 11 assists
per game, and libero Katie O'Neill
leads the team in passing.
Stanford swept the Ducks last
year at home and on the road and
leads the all-time series 38-2. The
Ducks are coming off losses last
week to Arizona and Arizona State
and are currently ninth in the Pac-10.
Their single win was a 3-0 decision
over Washington State.

Stanford is still without senior
libero Leahi Hall, who is recovering
from a hamstring injury in the pre
season that she aggravated two
weeks ago. The team has adjusted
well to her absence, but "it's hurting
us because Leahi is a tremendous
defensive player," said Stanford
head coach John Dunning.
"(Having her back] would help us
because she's really aggressive on
defense," Dunning said.
Hall's condition has been steadily
improving and she has begun prac
ticing with the team again, but it re
mains to be seen when she will re
turn to match play.
One consistent factor through the
team's struggles has been the play of
senior outside hitter Ogonna Nna
mani, who will most likely record her
2,(KM)th career kill by the end of the
weekend. Last week she became the
leading hitter in Stanford history,
passing Logan Tom's career mark of
1,939 kills.
With 1.984, she trails UCLA's
Natalie Williams by only 131, a num
ber she should have no trouble com
piling by the end of the month. She
needs only 272 more kills to pass
UCLA's Kristee Porter and become
the all-time leader in Pac-10 history.
The team will hit the road next
weekend to take on No. 1 Washing
ton and unranked Washington State.
