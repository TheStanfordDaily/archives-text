### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's soccer team will
kick off its first Pacific-10 Conference
homestand of the season this weekend
when it plays host to Arizona and Arizona
State on Friday and Sunday. Although the
Pac-10 season began just last week for the
No. 10 Cardinal (8-2-2, 0-0-1 Pac-10). this
weekend's series is crucial as the team
looks improve on its current position in the
conference standings.
Stanford was predicted to finish second
in the Pac-10 in the preseason coaches' poll
behind defending champ UCLA. Arizona
State, Washington and Southern Califor
nia were all selected to round out the top
five.
One week into the conference sched
ule. however, it appears that the preseason

predictions may be only that â€” predic
tions. Teams such as Arizona and Califor
nia have rebounded from disappointing
seasons to add to what is already an ex
tremely competitive conference.
In fact, Arizona currently sits atop the
Pac-10 standings with a 2-0-0-conference
record following its 3-1 upset of No. 4
Washington. The Huskies, who held the
highest ranking among Pac-10 teams head
ing into conference play, could only man
age a draw in its second game of the week
against Arizona State.
"With upsets last weekend like the Ari
zona-Washington game, Pac-10 is up for
grabs," said junior defender Lindsey Hunt.
"We're hoping to gain some momentum
with two wins this weekend, which will
help carry us through the rest of confer-
ence play."
The Cardinal began its Pac-10 sea
son last Sunday with an emotionally
charged matchup against rival Cali
fornia. The teams battled for 110
minutes before the game ended in a
1-1 tie.
While the Cardinal and Bears are
tied for fifth place in the Pac-10 with
0-0-1 records, the season is still young
and the Cardinal know that they have
plenty of time to move up in the
standings, starting this weekend.
Stanford's first matchup will come
against Arizona (11-2-0. 2-0-0 Pac
-10) on Friday night. The Wildcats, as
evidenced by their sweep of the
Washington schools last weekend,
have come out of nowhere this sea
son as the Pac-10's biggest surprise.
Arizona's 11 wins this season have
already surpassed the school's for
mer record of eight wins in a season.
The Wildcats' two conference wins
tie the school record.
The Cardinal will be facing a
much different Arizona team than
the one that has spent much of its his
tory bringing up the rear in the Pac
-10 standings.
The Wildcats have a balanced
scoring attack that is led by recent
Pac-10 Player of the Week Mallory
Miller and senior Kamaya Damwijk.
The duo leads the Pac-10 in both
shots taken (202) and goals scored
(30).
The Cardinal defense will have to
play a strong possession game against
the Wildcats in order to limit scoring
opportunities and shots. Stanford has
history on its side, owning a 9-0
record all-time against Arizona.
The Cardinal return to Maloney
Field on Sunday to face off against
Arizona State (5-6-1, 1-0-1 Pac-10).
Like the Wildcats, the Sun Devils
showed their strength this past week
end against Washington and Wash
ington State, grabbing a 2-1 win over
the Cougars while forcing the
Huskies to a 3-3 tie.
The Sun Devils' mediocre overall

record should be taken with a grain of
salt. Three of the team's six losses
came at the hands of Florida State,
Notre Dame and Pepperdine, all na
tionally ranked programs. In each
case, the Sun Devils lost by just a
goal.
As with Arizona, the Cardinal will
look to play a strong possession
game, something that they have done
successfully in the past. They will also
be looking to avenge last season's 3-2
loss to the Sun Devils.
In each game, the Cardinal are
looking to maintain focus for the
game's entirety, something that
many feel they didn't do last week
against Cal.
"I think we are all a little disap

pointed with our result at Cal last
weekend because we know we can do
better," said senior midfielder
Emilee Shim. "This weekend will be
a good test for us to try and stay fo
cused for the entire 90 minutes of the
game."
The Cardinal are also hoping ben
efit from the home field advantage,
especially after having had to play at
Berkeley last week.
"We are definitely happy to be
playing at home," said junior defend
er Jenny Farenbaugh. "We've been
on the road for quite a few games this
year, so it will be a nice advantage to
have fans cheering for us."
The scheduled kickoff for Friday's
game is at 7 p.m.
