## 'Final Cut' is unoriginal sci-fi at its worst 
### COLE PAULSON INTERMISSION WRITER 
What I've dreaded most has arrived at last.
The most innovative genre in the movie busi
ness seems to have finally lost its freshness:
They've made a "high-concept sci-fi thriller"
that is sadly just one big been-there, done
that'*snorer. "Final Cut" fol-

lows in the footsteps of such in
ventive, provocative films as
"Blade Runner." "Minority
Report" and even "Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind," deftly stealing elements
from all of them to produce one
painfully dull disappointment.
The concept this time
around: The Zoe chip is an im
plant that records your entire
life. Upon death, the footage is
carefully edited by "cutters"
using a Guillotine machine
(that remarkably resembles
that fancy monitor Tom Cruise
handled so adroitly to stop fu
ture crimes in Minority Report)
and is shown at a Rememory
ceremony, a.k.a. a high-tech

memorial service.
Robin Williams plays Alan Hakman, the best
cutter in the business. Lucky for him. the Guillo
tine does most of the work, automatically sorting
everyone's lives into subsections including ado
lescence. courtship and masturbation, etc., delet
ing all the stuff no one really wants to see. But
Alan also makes sure to get rid of everyone's

darkest secrets. He calls himself the "Sin Eater,"
miraculously transforming even his most corrupt
clients into saints. Alan has a past he'd also pre
fer kept hidden, so he feels no guilt for his abso
lutions. But opponents of Zde chips threaten to
bring Alan's manipulations into the light, and
perhaps some of his own secrets in the process.
This premise has plenty of potential: Would

we live our lives differently knowing that our
every movement is recorded? Are our darker"
actions better left forgotten? Wouldn't it be
funny if cutters made blooper reels of all their
clients' dumbest moments?
But alas, all my hopes were dashed in the first
few minutes, which recount a numbingly pre
dictable childhood trauma that you probably

could have devised in your sleep. When the film
started, 1 actually thought I was watching one of
those "Kindness: Pass It On" pre-movie ads, and
I still wasn't convinced it was the real thing until
the movie title flashed on the screen.
The cast of characters also proved to just be
an assortment of cliches. Robin Williams is our
tortured anti-hero with a haunted past. If
you've seen one of Williams' "I'm more than a
comedian" dramas, you've seen them all. Mira
Sorvino plays a pretty blonde bookstore owner,
Alan's only connection to a world away from his
obsessive cutting.
She's also kind enough to tell us the "deep
meaning" behind every scene, in case we miss the
obvious: "You've seen so many lives, Alan, yet

somehow you don'l know how to
live ..." Jim Caviezel delivers a
fairly bland performance as the
sympathetic villain who will stop
at nothing to put an end to Zoe
chips, including threatening Alan
with his cronies. And let me tell
you. when Jesus sics his thugs on
you, you know you're in trouble.
When it's all over, the recur
ring ideas, themes and motifs in
"The Final Cut" may promote a
10-minute discussion for the drive
home. But even more fun is chat
ting about all the plot elements,
sci-fi gadgetry and one-liners that

seem to have hopped right out of other movies
try it with your friends and see who can list the
most. And you'll probably eventually realize
that all the issues raised in this movie could be
solved easily if humanity just stuck to recording

memories with a simple camcorder — film all
the good times, and then just turn it off when you
go to the bathroom. But that's just a suggestion.

Editor's Note: Last time we checked, Ikea was in
the process of mass-producing Zde chips. They'll
be available in the home furnishings area next to
the Leksvik wardrobe and Morkedal queen
sized beds. Some assembly required.

everyone's lives into subsections including ado
lescence. courtship and masturbation, etc., delet
ing all the stuff no one really wants to see. But
Alan also makes sure to get rid of everyone's

darkest secrets. He calls himself the "Sin Eater,"
miraculously transforming even his most corrupt
clients into saints. Alan has a past he'd also pre
fer kept hidden, so he feels no guilt for his abso
lutions. But opponents of Zde chips threaten to
bring Alan's manipulations into the light, and
perhaps some of his own secrets in the process.
This premise has plenty of potential: Would

we live our lives differently knowing that our
every movement is recorded? Are our darker"
actions better left forgotten? Wouldn't it be
funny if cutters made blooper reels of all their
clients' dumbest moments?
But alas, all my hopes were dashed in the first
few minutes, which recount a numbingly pre
dictable childhood trauma that you probably

could have devised in your sleep. When the film
started, 1 actually thought I was watching one of
those "Kindness: Pass It On" pre-movie ads, and
I still wasn't convinced it was the real thing until
the movie title flashed on the screen.
The cast of characters also proved to just be
an assortment of cliches. Robin Williams is our
tortured anti-hero with a haunted past. If
you've seen one of Williams' "I'm more than a
comedian" dramas, you've seen them all. Mira
Sorvino plays a pretty blonde bookstore owner,
Alan's only connection to a world away from his
obsessive cutting.
She's also kind enough to tell us the "deep
meaning" behind every scene, in case we miss the
obvious: "You've seen so many lives, Alan, yet

somehow you don'l know how to
live ..." Jim Caviezel delivers a
fairly bland performance as the
sympathetic villain who will stop
at nothing to put an end to Zoe
chips, including threatening Alan
with his cronies. And let me tell
you. when Jesus sics his thugs on
you, you know you're in trouble.
When it's all over, the recur
ring ideas, themes and motifs in
"The Final Cut" may promote a
10-minute discussion for the drive
home. But even more fun is chat
ting about all the plot elements,
sci-fi gadgetry and one-liners that

seem to have hopped right out of other movies
try it with your friends and see who can list the
most. And you'll probably eventually realize
that all the issues raised in this movie could be
solved easily if humanity just stuck to recording

memories with a simple camcorder — film all
the good times, and then just turn it off when you
go to the bathroom. But that's just a suggestion.

Editor's Note: Last time we checked, Ikea was in
the process of mass-producing Zde chips. They'll
be available in the home furnishings area next to
the Leksvik wardrobe and Morkedal queen
sized beds. Some assembly required.
