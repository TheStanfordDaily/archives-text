# 'P.S.’ definitely isn't shorthand for 'Piece of S%&#!’

### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
What if the only thing that stood
between you and true happiness was
yourself? What if one person could
help you relive a pleasant part of your
past?
While these might seem like deep
philosophical questions, they are pre
cisely the issues that the film "P.S."
seeks to grapple with.
Playing out as a sort of black come
dy, "P.S." follows Louise Harrington
(Laura Linney), a sexually-repressed
39-year-old admissions officer at Co
lumbia University, who is in the mid
dle of dealing with her recovering

drug-addict brother Sammy (Paul Rudd) and
her recovering sex-addict husband Peter
(Gabriel Byrne).
In the midst of her struggles, we come to
find out that Louise was involved with an artist
named Scott when she was in high school. So
when F. Scott (Topher Grace) enters the scene
as an MFA applicant, Louise is magically

transported back to the days of her high school
romance.
From the moment the two meet, it's obvi
ous an underlying chemistry is brewing, and it
will only be a matter of time before it's fully re
alized. A very short matter of time. To be
exact, the matter of time it takes to get from
Louise's office to her apartment.

In the apartment, F. Scott and Louise
approach each other with a purely ani
malistic passion that produces a highly
non-typical movie sex-scene. It is em
barrassing, awkward and, well, more
realistic.
Louise offers F. Scott a glass of wine
and then has sex with him on her couch.
She seems to know what she's doing in
terms of knowing the rules of the game,
but at the same time she appears inse
cure. There's a depth that is captured,
sans frivolous music or special lighting,
that permeates the entire film, and ulti
mately transcends it.
However, a monkey-wrench is thrown
into Louise's romance when her best
friend, Missy (Marcia Gay Harden), finds

out about F. Scott. We learn that not only had
Missy interrupted Louise's high school romance
with Scott, but she may be involved in this one
as well.
While the two women seem to be pitted
against each other, their involvement with F.
Scott serves more to bring them together than
split them apart. The magic is really that this boy

makes them feel young. He eases their longing
and want for past days, for past experiences... for
all the things that should or could have been that
never were.
"P.S." is clearly driven by its extremely capa
ble cast, headed exceptionally by Linney, and
hinging on a surprising performance by Grace.
The film is highly successful in that it is able to cap
ture the very human wants for happiness, love,
care, kindness and compassion.
Above all, "P.S." gives the viewer hope. And
that is, perhaps, the most magical feeling of all.
