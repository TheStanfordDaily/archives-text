# Matt Stone on ‘Team America,’ the MPAA, puppet sex
## "We have a sex scene with puppets," says Matt Stone. Want to know what the HELL he is talking about? 
### TOM HANADA INTERMISSION CO-EDITOR 
Best known for their lovable, pervert
ed, profanity-laden, cut-out characters
from "South Park." Trey Parker and Matt
Stone have recently completed a new
movie. "Team America: World Police"
opens Friday. Oct. 15. The film — acted
entirely using puppets — brings Team
America into battle against international
terrorism and the evil yet lonely (or
"ronery") Kim Jong-11. Creator Matt
Stone talks with Intermission about the
upcoming movie, the future of "South
Park" and why the MPAA sucks.
Intermission: What compelled you guys
to do this movie with puppets?
Matt Stone: It came from watching
"Thunderbirds" on TV. It really had such
an interesting feel, but it was so boring
and shitty. So we started talking about
how great it would be to do a movie like
that.
INT: Who or what were you trying to sat
irize the most with "Team America"?

MS: I don't know if we've ever talked about
considering a target as much as trying to tell
the story from the lead characters' point of
view and try to hit all those beats of what it
is to be an American. Emotional beats
when you get put in the position where
people hate you because you're Amer-

ican because we're the police of the
world, or whether you feel
1 ~L A. 4. U- A.

proud about that,
and a lot of times

it's kind of a
mixture of

both. For in
stance, I
think that it's
about if you've
traveled Eu
rope and the

idea of America being the world's police
has been around fora long time.
We're going to Europe and people are
getting mad at America like "What do
you think you are? The world's police?",
and you're immediately put in this posi
tion of, "Am I ashamed to be American?

Am I proud?"
It's a unique
ly American co
nundrum that
when America
does go do
something in the
world there are
people who hate
us, and when we

don't stop in
justices in the world everyone looks to us
and says, "Why the fuck aren't you doing
anything?"
INT: Do you find yourself to be an impor
tant political influence on your viewing
audience?
MS: 1 have no idea, but I sure hope not. I
would hate to think that anybody took their
political views from me or Trey because
we're pretty fucked-up people. At least we
can admit it.and see. that's where we're dif
ferent from other celebrities. At least we
admit that we have fucked-up political views.
Anybody changing their mind because of this
movie would be pretty weak-willed people.

INT: What are your feelings about
the ratings battle over "Team
America"?

MS: They're basically
what I've always thought
about the

MPAA since we did the "South Park"
movie. I think it's a pretty broken organiza
tion. I don't think it serves artists very well,
and I don't think it serves parents very
well. In this movie it was just pointed out
even more to us. even though I thought
that before.
We have a sex scene with puppets, and
the puppets are not even anatomically cor
rect because they're like Barbie and Ken
dolls and we put them in little positions and
rub them together and there's pretty music.
It's a love scene. And the MPAA had a
problem with some of the positions we
picked, but it really is one of the most in
nocuous things in the movie. Everyone who
has seen the cuts we had to make just thinks
it's insane that that's what they honed in on.
Even people who work at Paramount who
do 12 movies a year, when they submit
things to the MPAA they still have no idea
of what they're going to say. The random
ness of it is just kind of frustrating.
INT: Is this battle different than the battle
you normally have with the censors on the
television show?
MS: No. because the television show has
very clear guidelines and we can argue di
rectly with them and a lot of times it's a
back and forth, and we can say "Well
here's what we're trying to say," and
they're saying "Well, we don't get that
out of it." My thing is, once there is an "R"
rating on your film, I don't understand
why you just can't do whatever

the fuck you
want. It's art
for adults.
An "R" rat
ing should
be every-

thing above "PG-13," and once you get an
"R" you should be able to do just about
what you want as long as the company
you're working for is okay with it.
INT: And you don't still have to fight the
censors that often on that show right?
MS: Yes we do. Every week there's one or
two things we have to fight with the net
work about, but that's part of the reason
why "South Park" is successful. There are
limitations on TV, and "South Park" is al
ways bumping up against those limita
tions. So as much as I weekly curse out the
standards people at Comedy Central be
cause I think they're wrong and I think we
should be able to do something — that's
part of "South Park's" thing.
INT: Are there any plans to do another
movie?
MS: No not right now. In fact, I think
we've kind of sworn off movies after this.
This puppet movie almost killed us.
INT: Is there anything big coming up in
the next season of "South Park"?
MS: We have no idea because we were
working on this movie. We have no idea
what's going to be in any episode actually.
We do everything by the seat of our pants.
INT: Do you like that fact that you can
just throw things in there like five days be
fore they happen?
MS: Yes I do. We do an episode of "South
Park" in one week, and there's almost a
live performance feel to it. The creative
turnaround is what's really fun about it.
It's like you come up with an idea, you get
psyched on it, you live with it fora week.

you laugh about it fora week and
then it's on the air and it's

gone. With a
movie like

this and the reason why movies are so hard
is because you come up with the jokes that
literally you live with fur two or three
years. And after you live with a joke for
three years, it's just not tunny any more,
and it's hard to keep the excitement up for
three years. I much prefer TV right now.
INT: What inspires you to use alternate
forms of animation and different kinds of
mediums?
MS: With "South Park" it was really because
I can't draw at all and Trey can draw really
well, but only in this one simple style that's
basically become the "South Park" style.
"Team America"was definitely inspired by
Gerry Anderson's marionettes. When you
decide you're going to do an R" puppet
movie you've got a lot of fertile ground joke-

wise if that
makes any
sense. Like
there're a lot of
jokes that just
are obvious
that no one has
picked up on
because no one
has done it.
INT: What
words of ad
vice can you
give aspiring
film students
who are maybe
interested in
alternative
forms of media
presentation?
MS: Just do as

many little films as you can and the cheaper
the better. Like if we had $1,000, we'd rather
do three $300 films than one $1,000 film be
cause ultimately you're never going to get
good production values at a student
level. So just forget production value, for
get spending your money on really cool
looking stuff because it's all about story
and character, and you should he able to
do that with a fork and knife or two people
sitting in a room.
INT: Now I think one of the most over
looked parts of your work ("South Park:
Bigger, Longer and Uncut" and "Team
America") is the music. What takes
longer: the script, the editing or just ar
ranging all this music for it?
MS: The script is the Bible. so the script

is what we think about all the
time. You know Trey is re
ally the musical genius, so
he does the music and I get

to be involved, but once he
gets an idea he's so prolific
and so fast at writing some
thing it's really amazing. But

usually that comes out of
spending a lot of time on the
script and then thinking of a song

along the wa\

Our biggest regret of this whole
fucking thing is that we came to Los
Angeles to be in a band and we got side

tracked by this stupid fucking television
thing. We love playing music.
In "leant America," there's six or
seven songs in there, and usually for us
that would be our favorite part of the
whole process — where you would get a
studio. We would go fuck around and
play music, and sure you can find better
musicians, but it would be us and we can
play and it's like fun and we just literally
did not have time, so we had to have other
people record the songs this time. They
are still Trey's compositions and he sung
them, but we literally just did not have
time to go in and track our own guitar
tracks and drum tracks, so that was kind
of a bummer and we won't do that again.
INT: Are you guys ever tired of just being
the "South Park" guys?

MS: Sometimes it gets a little tiring. It's
like, "Oh you're the South Park guys,"
but at the end of the day I would rather
be the "South Park" guys than be a lot of
other things. We're proud of "South
Park," so it's kind of not a bummer to be
called the "South Park guys." You're al
ways going to be known by your biggest
success.
INT: Who do you think would win in a
fight between Kerry and Bush? If Kerry
had lasers and let's say President Bush
had teleportation?
MS: Well, obviously Bush would because
he could teleport into the future and get
stronger lasers and come back.
INT: Okay.
MS: Is that right? Teleporting can you go
into the future, or is that just teleporting
space?
INT: Well I was thinking more like the
Rayden from "Mortal Kombat" where
you just go to the other side of him.
MS: Oh, wow! That's tough. I guess Bush
would have to position himself near a
large building. Then, when Kerry shot at
him. he would have to teleport so that it
hit the building, and then the building
would fall on Kerry.
