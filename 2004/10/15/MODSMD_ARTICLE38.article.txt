# Linney and kidd reflect on 'P.S'
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
She's wearing a smart pinstripe suit. She walks in and she looks the way
she does on screen — a little flustered, mussed hair, hard and soft at the
same time. She looks at me, and I'm a little scared of her.
When we sit down with Laura Linney, the softer side comes out. Her
eyes are a pure and penetrating blue, more powerful in person th;in on film.
She speaks in complete sentences, pausing for emphasis. It feels like she's
reading from a script, but she's so great an actress that you don't notice.
"I think there's a lot of great material out there for women," Linney says.
"You just don't get paid for it. I've been so fortimate, you know. The roles
I've had over the past few years have been fantastic."
It's true. Over the past couple of years. Linney has had roles in"The Tru
man Show," "Primal Fear" and "Love Actually." She's been nominated for
an Academy Award (for "You Can Count on Me") and starred in the Clint
Eastwood-directed films "Absolute Power" and "Mystic River."
"What he [Eastwood] does is he creates a wonderful environment for
work to thrive in. And then he leaves you alone ... and there's something
very exciting about that," Linney says.
She explains how she goes about choosing her projects:
"If 1 rftid something or am considering something, it's usually one of
three things that has to be in place. There has to be either a great script, a
great director, or a great actor to work with, whether that's an actor or ac
tress. One of those three things has to be there. If it's two of the three that's
great; if it's three of the three then, it's a sl.un dunk."
Enter Dylan Kidd, the director of "P.S."
" 'Roger Dodger,' Dylan's first movie, was with Campbell Scott, who is
a good friend of mine, so I had heard about Dylan fora while," Linney ex
plains. "And then Dylan called me when he was thinking about doing 'P.S.',
and we sat down and had a meeting. He told me about the project and we
talked about it, and then he called me a while later and sent the script over
and I read it and said, 'Sure.' "
"There's a lot of scripts that you get that just aren't actable," Linney ad
mits. "At least for me. Or 1 don't know how to act in them."
This is clearly not the case with Linney's role as "P.S." 's Louise Harrington.

"What interested me in it is this woman in this phase of her life," Lin
ney explains. "A woman in her late 30s whose life has not turned out the
way she thought it would. She really thinks it should have, and why didn't
it. And sort of being somewhat trapped and paralyzed in shattered ex
pectations. And being smart and capable and all those things, and being

stuck. I found that sort
of interesting."
Linney plays a Colom
bia University admissions
officer in the film and
speaks of her own experi
ence at Julliard.
"I loved school," she
says, breaking into solilo
quy. "I miss it. I miss the
purity of concentration.
Cause you get out of
school and you've
worked so hard. And
you really think you're
ready. You really think
you're finished," she
pauses for emphasis,
"with yourself, with your
personal development.
You think. I've gotten to
that point, I'm disci
plined, I can do this, I can
do that — I'm ready to
go. And then you realize
that your own personal
development is just be
ginning." Pause. "And
that is shocking," she says
straight-faced. And then
she breaks out laughing.
