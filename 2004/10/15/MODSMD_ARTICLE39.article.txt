### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
After bursting onto the scene in 2002 with his directorial debut, "Roger
Dodger," Dylan Kidd tackled his next project — a dark romantic comedy
called "P.S.", based on the novel by Helen Schulman.
Kidd worked non-stop with Schulman, sending drafts back and forth, to
adapt the novel to the big screen.
"As you can imagine, it's very difficult fora novelist to watch their baby
get blown up into some demented other format," Kidd explains. "But she
[Schulman] was really generous and I think — I hope — the movie and the
book can sort of co-exist."
The story centers around one character, Louise Harrington, and her psy
chological struggles, making it difficult to present on film.
Kidd explains, "The biggest challenge of this specific book is that a lot of
the humor is generated through this sort of third-person omniscient thing
where you're in Louise's head. She has this very funny kind of running
monologue with herself."
Deciding against voice-overs and flashbacks. Kidd says, "We really re
lied heavily on Laura Linney to tell the story with her face and her voice
and her eyes."
On a 25 day shooting schedule and with no rehearsals, Kidd was at the
mercy of his two lead actors and a knock-out script. Linney had already been
cast and was finishing performing in "Kinsey" when she came in to meetTo
pher Grace, her younger love interest.
"Laura was very generous and took one of her days off from "Kinsey' to
come in and read against Topher. because we were fans but obviously needed
to see them together, and it was one of those magic moments..." Kidd says.
"From the moment he walks in the door she just sort of lit up, and they just
get along really well and they're very sexy together and he's younger, but not
distractingly younger. He's just the jjerfect age where he's like half boy half
man depending on how the light hits him. And when you're making a movie
like this, you cast it right and you almost can't screw it up," he explains.
The onscreen chemistry between Linney and Grace explodes in one par
ticular scene — the first time the two make love..
"When you do a love scene, it's all about how much the actors arc willing
to commit to it," Kidd says."And so as a director, when you watch that
scene, I just sort of internally thank the actors for trusting me enough to re
ally commit to that scene."
Kidd continues, "And then on the crew side, our approach was to really

do the sort of rigorous real-time thing. Where from the second he [Grace|
walked in the apartment, you don't cut away fora second."
"1 think what that does is it allows the scene to be like many different things.
I think what often bugs me in the movies is that there's a love scene and it's only
about one tiling: the sex scene where they say good-bye to each other, die sex
scene where they cheat on their spouses, the sex scene that's funny because it's in
a Laundromat or whatever. Whereas, as we all know, sex Ls one of those activi
ties that's both funny and heartbreaking and tender and disturbing all at once."
Kidd's ability to understand and present a story that's innately human
sets him apart from the rest of the directorial pack.
"Most Hollywood movies are kind of like fast-food — they're not that
satisfying because they've been sort of micro-marketed, and they're giving
you exactly what they think you want. And so of course, being a human, you
refuse to want that,' Kidd says.
Denying the fast-food craving, Kidd explains his philosophy: "The only
way I know how to make a decision about what project to be involved in or
try to be involved in is if something about me just loves the story, and I'm
dying to tell it."
He adds, "For me. I'D always do comedies. I'm incapable of seeing life
without humor."


"Don't touch the hat!" exclaims director Dylan Kidd, who seems to have
mistaken his bottle of Naked Juice fora can of mace.
