## Emperor Itzhak's new clothes 
### NICK CASEY INTERMISSION WRITER 
Who am I, a lowly viola player, to
talk trash about the great Itzhak Perl
man? I'll try my best. Bear with me -
it is, in fact, an uphill battle ...
Yet what does an artistic fiend do
when he's at the top of his game and
Beethoven rolls off the fingers with
the humdrum ease of the password
that unlocks your laptop? Le Cor
busier suffered from that same
plague of the old-aged maestro and
abandoned his boxy homes for sinu
ous shapes. And Itzhak? He left his
fiddle for the baton.
And without apology last Satur
day night. Perlman's program with
the San Francisco Symphony all but
abandoned this musician's talent as
an instrumentalist and left the audi
ence (and the symphony) to the
wrath of his misshapen musical vision
as conductor. It's well known that vi
olinists tend to the inflationary ego,
but taking charge of the orchestra
simply takes things too far: Perlman's
performance recalled memories of
Mickey Mouse, the stars and moons
of the wizard's hat; a confused magi
cian, under the tidal forces of an or
chestra at the end of "Fantasia." It's
not that one cannot be a man of many
talents.
Poor Giotto, king of European
painting, became a real cultural boss
when he decided to build his hell
tower in Florence: He did well, as it's
still standing for all I know, and cele
brating its seventh century. Artist to
architect, musician to conductor-the
jump in the latter case seems even
closer, so why does it prove so difficult
for Perlman?
The violinist's instrument is the
violin, of course, its four strings, its
body and its pegs. But the conduc
tor's instrument is much more un
wieldy. That's because conductor
plays the orchestra.
And it was this that I think Perl
man, the conductor, seems to have
forgotten. His hands fly, twiddling the
air as though there existed strings to
be plucked, but none came to him. His
program, of the Bach A-minor con

certo, a Mozart symphony and An
toni'n Dvorak's New World Symphony

shouldn't have been such a
challenge for the maestro:
nothing daring, like the un
ruly toil of Mahler which
rocked the halls of Davies
last week.
When you cook eggs
benedict and the hol
landaise goes wrong, you're
forgiven. But when you
mess up scrambled eggs...
you don't mess up the
scrambled eggs.

This came scrambled. Mozart's
Symphony No. 21 was the stiffness
that makes people determined that
the Austrian belongs in the LP play
ers of women with powdered hair.
Dvorak's Ninth, that fiery beast
which emerged from the bowels of
late nineteenth century New York

into the pen of an unlikely Czech,
made you long for an mp3 and some

headphones to listen
by.
I was perhaps the
only one. The audi
ence was ecstatic —
Perlman-mania had
swept the concert
hall, and standing
ovations were bleed
ing into one another,
and you half expect
ed that he might
hobble off the stage

and into the mosh pit fora horizontal
tour of the symphony hall.
I'll admit, I stood up too — I'd
look like a jerk if I didn't. But the
fact remains that this fiddler is no
conductor, and the emperor, as
usual, will always have admirers for
his dashing new clothes.

Hoping the emperor will get his groove back
