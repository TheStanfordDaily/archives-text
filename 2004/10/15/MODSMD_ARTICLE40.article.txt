## Emperor Itzhak's new clothes 
### NICK CASEY INTERMISSION WRITER 
Who am I, a lowly viola player, to
talk trash about the great Itzhak Perl
man? I'll try my best. Bear with me -
it is, in fact, an uphill battle ...
Yet what does an artistic fiend do
when he's at the top of his game and
Beethoven rolls off the fingers with
the humdrum ease of the password
that unlocks your laptop? Le Cor
busier suffered from that same
plague of the old-aged maestro and
abandoned his boxy homes for sinu
ous shapes. And Itzhak? He left his
fiddle for the baton.
And without apology last Satur
day night. Perlman's program with
the San Francisco Symphony all but
abandoned this musician's talent as
an instrumentalist and left the audi
ence (and the symphony) to the
wrath of his misshapen musical vision
as conductor. It's well known that vi
olinists tend to the inflationary ego,
but taking charge of the orchestra
simply takes things too far: Perlman's
performance recalled memories of
Mickey Mouse, the stars and moons
of the wizard's hat; a confused magi
cian, under the tidal forces of an or
chestra at the end of "Fantasia." It's
not that one cannot be a man of many
talents.
Poor Giotto, king of European
painting, became a real cultural boss
