# DANCING
## IN THE MOONLIGHT 
### EMILY HITE INTERMISSION DANCE CRITIC 
Smuin Ballet's opening night of
"Fly Me to the Moon" at the Palace of
Fine Arts Theatre in San Francisco
was a positively enjoyable viewing ex
perience. highlighted both by Michael
Smuin's featured work to Frank Sina
tra music and Amy Seiwert's new bal
let. "Ruhig."
The evening's centerpiece was an
exemplary demonstration of Smuin's
appealing style of creating joyous
dances accompanied by classic songs.
Smuin explained, "When Sinatra
sings, you naturally want to dance." and
Ins choreography brought to life the
charming, old-fashioned love narra
tives best expressed through the frame
work of ballroom dancing. "Fly Me to
the Moon" also capitalized on the ballet
dancers' infallible abilities to jump, turn
and move with easy versatility.
Their strong technique was essen
tial to the success of a dance set to
such famous and beloved music. In
the first pas de deux, "I've Got You
Under My Skin," Seiwert's sprung
leaps met — if not exceeded — the
height and power of her partner,
David Strobbe, creating a playfully
competitive courtship.
Nicole Trerise was classy and con
fident in"The Lady is a Tramp," and
Celia Fushille-Burke and James

Strong danced with elegance and ma
turity in "Moonlight Serenade."
The most marked performance
was by Shannon Hurlburt, first in his
tap duet with Vanessa Thiessen and
then in his solo "That's Life." Begin
ning with a casual run and slide across
the stage. Hurlburt strutted beneath
his forward-tipped hat with Frank
Sinatra style. He was absolutely suave
— maybe it was the tap dancing.
The piece finished with a can't-go
wrong closer "New York. New York."
complete with projected video
footage of New York City scenery and
a chorus-line procession of the entire
cast in hats and costumes. The pro
duction's grace made it possible to for
give the circus quality of the opening
ballet. Smuin's Starshadows, its over
the-top sparkly velvet costumes that
were more reminiscent of ice skating
outfits, trapeze artist lifts and upside
down leg-holding spins.
Featured in the performance were
three ballets premiered by Smuin Bal
let dancers. Fushille-Burke's simply ti
tled "Three in Company" was as mini
malist as its name and resembled a se
ries of ballet class exercises. It was
palatable, but nondescript and unre
markable. Hurlburt's "Dumky" was
much more fun and engaging, with a
touch of humor. Two couples appear

breathe and sing. She captured in her
cancc t..£ music's Scainiess progres
sion and differentiated levels of ex
citement. There was gorgeous, lyrical
partnering developing into brilliant
beating jumps enhancing musical
highpoints. Seiwert utilized ballet's
most fantastic steps: those that are dif
ficult to incorporate effectively and
therefore are largely unseen.
Seiwert presented a kind of move
ment that was unique within the per
formance because it explored the
process and journey of movement
rather than finding the least obvious
means to an impressive finish. There
were no steps linked by helpful transi

to be on a double date, with the women
flirting and then mischievously manip
ulating the unsuspecting man in the
trio. The ballet also explored intro
spection and self-discovery, as danced
in a solo of smaller, more somber and
introverted gestures by Strong and
later recapitulated by the ensemble.
The best work of the night was Sei
wert's "Ruhig," a musical and archi
tectural diamond. Complementing
Bach's orderly yet frenetic "Cantata
No. 4" with fluidity and calmness, Sei
wert made the dancers' bodies

tions; evervthine was essential to the
entire work of art. "Ruhig" was a soft
exhalation of the word "exactly."
Amy Seiwert is commissioned to cre
ate a ballet for Stanford dancers to be
performed at this year's Spring Migra
tion show. Smuin Ballet's program
"Fly Me To the Moon " will he running
at the Palace of Fine Arts Theatre until

Center for the Performing Arts Feb. 23

Do fly me ...to the moon, that is
Smuin Ballet's opening night of
"Fly Me to the Moon" at the Palace of
Fine Arts Theatre in San Francisco
was a positively enjoyable viewing ex
perience. highlighted both by Michael
Smuin's featured work to Frank Sina
tra music and Amy Seiwert's new bal
let. "Ruhig."
The evening's centerpiece was an
exemplary demonstration of Smuin's
appealing style of creating joyous
dances accompanied by classic songs.
Smuin explained, "When Sinatra
sings, you naturally want to dance." and
Ins choreography brought to life the
charming, old-fashioned love narra
tives best expressed through the frame
work of ballroom dancing. "Fly Me to
the Moon" also capitalized on the ballet
dancers' infallible abilities to jump, turn
and move with easy versatility.
Their strong technique was essen
tial to the success of a dance set to
such famous and beloved music. In
the first pas de deux, "I've Got You
Under My Skin," Seiwert's sprung
leaps met — if not exceeded — the
height and power of her partner,
David Strobbe, creating a playfully
competitive courtship.
Nicole Trerise was classy and con
fident in"The Lady is a Tramp," and
Celia Fushille-Burke and James

Strong danced with elegance and ma
turity in "Moonlight Serenade."
The most marked performance
was by Shannon Hurlburt, first in his
tap duet with Vanessa Thiessen and
then in his solo "That's Life." Begin
ning with a casual run and slide across
the stage. Hurlburt strutted beneath
his forward-tipped hat with Frank
Sinatra style. He was absolutely suave
— maybe it was the tap dancing.
The piece finished with a can't-go
wrong closer "New York. New York."
complete with projected video
footage of New York City scenery and
a chorus-line procession of the entire
cast in hats and costumes. The pro
duction's grace made it possible to for
give the circus quality of the opening
ballet. Smuin's Starshadows, its over
the-top sparkly velvet costumes that
were more reminiscent of ice skating
outfits, trapeze artist lifts and upside
down leg-holding spins.
Featured in the performance were
three ballets premiered by Smuin Bal
let dancers. Fushille-Burke's simply ti
tled "Three in Company" was as mini
malist as its name and resembled a se
ries of ballet class exercises. It was
palatable, but nondescript and unre
markable. Hurlburt's "Dumky" was
much more fun and engaging, with a
touch of humor. Two couples appear

breathe and sing. She captured in her
cancc t..£ music's Scainiess progres
sion and differentiated levels of ex
citement. There was gorgeous, lyrical
partnering developing into brilliant
beating jumps enhancing musical
highpoints. Seiwert utilized ballet's
most fantastic steps: those that are dif
ficult to incorporate effectively and
therefore are largely unseen.
Seiwert presented a kind of move
ment that was unique within the per
formance because it explored the
process and journey of movement
rather than finding the least obvious
means to an impressive finish. There
were no steps linked by helpful transi

to be on a double date, with the women
flirting and then mischievously manip
ulating the unsuspecting man in the
trio. The ballet also explored intro
spection and self-discovery, as danced
in a solo of smaller, more somber and
introverted gestures by Strong and
later recapitulated by the ensemble.
The best work of the night was Sei
wert's "Ruhig," a musical and archi
tectural diamond. Complementing
Bach's orderly yet frenetic "Cantata
No. 4" with fluidity and calmness, Sei
