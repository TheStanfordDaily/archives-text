# 'The Love Wife'... as opposed to the wife of carnal pleasures
## 
### ANNA NORTH INTERMISSION LITERARY CRITIC 
The title of Gish Jen's third novel,
"The Love Wife," doesn't inspire a
lot of confidence. To a jaded reader,
it may sound like a knockoff of an
earlier work — remember Amy
Tan's sophomore effort. "The
Kitchen Ciod's Wife"? To a cynic, it
might just sound like an oxymoron.
Fortunately, Jen is a step ahead of
the cynical and jaded alike. Like
Tan, she writes about Chinese-
Americans — her first two novels,
"Typical American" and "Mona in
the Promised Land," feature the
Chang family of Scarsdale, NY.
Jen. however, is no copycat. She
departs most obviously from Tan,
and from the uncomfortable pigeon

hole of Asian-American fiction, in
her choice of characters.
Carnegie Wong is a middle-aged
Chinese-American suburbanite. His
wife, the appropriately named
Blondie, is white. Their two daugh
ters. Lizzy and Wendy, are adopted
from China. And their toddler son
Bailey, who is biologically conceived,
is still too young to understand the
racial crossroads at which he exists.
Lan, a relative from China who
becomes the children's nanny, is
thrown into the mix as the result of a
strange provision in Carnegie's
mother's will. According to Mama
Wong, Carnegie is supposed to take
care of her, but Blondie worries her
mother-in-law may have wanted her
son to bed Lan as well.
Of course Lan throws Blondie's

differentness into sharp relief. And
of course, her arrival causes the girls
— ages nine and 15 — to compare
their annoyingly chirpy blond moth
er to a woman who looks like them,
makes them delicious treats and tells
them about the country they came
from.
Broad strokes of family discord
are plentiful here — for the pyroma
niacs in the crowd, there's even a
fire. But Jen is best on the small
scale. Her characters all speak di
rectly to the reader, and they are at
their best in the moments — fleeting
and revealing — when they unself
consciously observe one another.
Carnegie lists his wife's bodily
imperfections, only to dwell on her
"surprisingly small, twinkly hands."
Blondie holds Wendy for the first

time, confused nearly to terror by
the "surprisingly heavy" baby who
writhes so powerfully that Blondie
can barely hold her.
Jen's characters are continually
caught off guard by each other —
it's their greatest strength. Plenty of
people get hurt in"The Love Wife,"
but it's not about the destructive
power of love. Plenty of them heal,
but it's not about redemption either.
Instead, "The Love Wife" shows
what few writers have shown well:
the ability of those we love to com
pletely blindside us.
"The Love Wife" is, of course, a
story about race and culture, and
whether either can be adopted,
mixed, or erased. Jen treats these is
sues with an admirable level of nu
ance, but the question on which

"The Love Wife" turns is not
"Who's Chinese?" It's a more basic
question, one we sometimes need to
ask even of those we think we know
best: "Who are you, anyway?"
As I find myself saying at the end
of every good review. Jen's book has
flaws. Less gentle readers may find
some of the ending scenes melodra
matic. And Jen can't entirely avoid
the specter of Tan — Mama Wong
sometimes seems to have read "The
Joy Luck Club." But, on that lady's
death, a friend of Carnegie's writes
to him, "How lucky you are to get
her fora mother, and not somebody
else."
Lan and the Wongs are lucky to
get Gish Jen fora writer; their love
— for love it is — might have been
lost on somebody else.
