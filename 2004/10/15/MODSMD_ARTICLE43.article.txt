I've said it before and I'll say it again: The
young men of Interpol are the most swashbuck
ling achromatopsiacs of our generation. Their
liner notes may be in bullshit Braille and their
bassist Carlos D might strap an unforgivably
empty holster to his belt, but oh my god, is this
the best album of the year or what? Fine, fine, I 'II
push the rhetorical button: Jesus, yes. Having
endured universal hype on their stunning debut,
"Antics" finds Interpol in top form — culling di
verse moods from a simple palette of black and
white and blasting critical piranhas out of the
water with a fluent guitar drone.
I'll interrupt my celebratory rant now with a
disclaimer: there will certainly be theoretically
better albums released in 2004, albums that are
more surprising and explosive. Yet, compared to
"Antics," these are destined to be tiny dimples on
the indie-rock landscape. Call me a whore, but
I've always hungered for bands that marry diffi
cult, gloomy visions to mainstream success. And
like The Strokes' sophomore effort, "Antics" is
essentially an answer to skeptics: This New York
movement is no fleeting fashion trend.
That Interpol are acutely aware of this is re
flected in the increased warmth of their music:
they're slowly thawing out of an icy concept into
a real, goddamn band. The angsty themes of
"Turn On the Bright Lights" are now fanned into
a gentle grayscale. The first guitar lick on "Public
Pervert" is so banal, so happy, really, that the lines
"If time was my vessel, then learning to love /
could be my way back to sea" sound positively
avuncular. I never thought I'd use that word to
describe Paul Banks' singing — he's always

seemed like lan Curtis on laxatives — hut there
are moments where he's so engrossed in the sheer
pleasure of singing that you're totally comforted
as a listener. No more of that "stabbing yourself in
the neck" business here, Uncle Banks?
Banks also affects an acrobatic tonal shift on

"C'Mere," (my favorite cut) which goes from the
desperate cliche of "It's way too late to be this
locked inside ourselves" to the transcendent
"Now seasoned with health / two lovers walk a
lakeside mile ..." The guitars twitch unexpect
edly from an automatic throb (think "PDA") to a

bouncy. Smiths-like bridge. It's the most beauti
ful moment on the album, an exact metaphor for
the two extremes Interpol is trying to conquer.
Unfortunately, as my preceding examples
have no doubt established, the lyrics on this
album are mostly subpar, absent are the obses
sive narratives of their debut and the tantalizing
images that made us lust after mythical charac
ters like Stella — a diver who fell (fatally)
through an open manhole. In fact, the band fairs
better on "Antics" only when it sheds its nauti
cal ambitions ("you'll never see a finer ship in
your life" ... right) fora more virtuous and
earnest stride.
Speaking of which, what's with having "Slow
Hands" for the first single? Sure, it's dancy and
sarcastic and choked with Franz Ferdinand gui
tars, but it's not nearly as spastic as "Evil" (check
out Carlos' heavy-duty bass line and the Smells-
Like-Teen-Spirit riff!), nor as shameless as
"Take You on a Cruise" (Interpol's first and
only ballad). I don't get it: Why do Banks and
Co. want to doff their hats to their contempo
raries? C'mon! You're fucking NY hipsters!
You don't even wear hats!
At the end of the day, the difference be
tween bands like Franz Ferdinand and Inter
pol is the way they choose to refract the pas
sions of their influences. The archduke's assis
tants are clever jesters on stage and in the stu
dio, playing up their '80s pretenses; Interpol is
deathly serious, almost to the point of parody.
Almost — the word is key. Because the more I
listen to "Antics" (50 times and counting), the
more I get the sense that this is a band that
would like to be more effusive and kaleido
scopic, but just, for the love of life, cannot.
They're diseased, monochromatic, retarded by
their own seriousness. And in trying to create
color from black and white on their second
album — a hugely ambitious task — they've
failed beautifully and terrifyingly. God bless
them.

earnest stride.
Speaking of which, what's with having "Slow
Hands" for the first single? Sure, it's dancy and
sarcastic and choked with Franz Ferdinand gui
tars, but it's not nearly as spastic as "Evil" (check
out Carlos' heavy-duty bass line and the Smells-
Like-Teen-Spirit riff!), nor as shameless as
"Take You on a Cruise" (Interpol's first and
only ballad). I don't get it: Why do Banks and
Co. want to doff their hats to their contempo
raries? C'mon! You're fucking NY hipsters!
You don't even wear hats!
At the end of the day, the difference be
tween bands like Franz Ferdinand and Inter
pol is the way they choose to refract the pas
sions of their influences. The archduke's assis
tants are clever jesters on stage and in the stu
dio, playing up their '80s pretenses; Interpol is
deathly serious, almost to the point of parody.
Almost — the word is key. Because the more I
listen to "Antics" (50 times and counting), the
more I get the sense that this is a band that
would like to be more effusive and kaleido
scopic, but just, for the love of life, cannot.
They're diseased, monochromatic, retarded by
their own seriousness. And in trying to create
color from black and white on their second
album — a hugely ambitious task — they've
failed beautifully and terrifyingly. God bless
them.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: The
young men of Interpol are the most swashbuck
ling achromatopsiacs of our generation. Their
liner notes may be in bullshit Braille and their
bassist Carlos D might strap an unforgivably
empty holster to his belt, but oh my god, is this
the best album of the year or what? Fine, fine, I 'II
push the rhetorical button: Jesus, yes. Having
endured universal hype on their stunning debut,
"Antics" finds Interpol in top form — culling di
verse moods from a simple palette of black and
white and blasting critical piranhas out of the
water with a fluent guitar drone.
I'll interrupt my celebratory rant now with a
disclaimer: there will certainly be theoretically
better albums released in 2004, albums that are
more surprising and explosive. Yet, compared to
"Antics," these are destined to be tiny dimples on
the indie-rock landscape. Call me a whore, but
I've always hungered for bands that marry diffi
cult, gloomy visions to mainstream success. And
like The Strokes' sophomore effort, "Antics" is
essentially an answer to skeptics: This New York
movement is no fleeting fashion trend.
That Interpol are acutely aware of this is re
flected in the increased warmth of their music:
they're slowly thawing out of an icy concept into
a real, goddamn band. The angsty themes of
"Turn On the Bright Lights" are now fanned into
a gentle grayscale. The first guitar lick on "Public
Pervert" is so banal, so happy, really, that the lines
"If time was my vessel, then learning to love /
could be my way back to sea" sound positively
avuncular. I never thought I'd use that word to
describe Paul Banks' singing — he's always

seemed like lan Curtis on laxatives — hut there
are moments where he's so engrossed in the sheer
pleasure of singing that you're totally comforted
as a listener. No more of that "stabbing yourself in
the neck" business here, Uncle Banks?
Banks also affects an acrobatic tonal shift on

"C'Mere," (my favorite cut) which goes from the
desperate cliche of "It's way too late to be this
locked inside ourselves" to the transcendent
"Now seasoned with health / two lovers walk a
lakeside mile ..." The guitars twitch unexpect
edly from an automatic throb (think "PDA") to a

bouncy. Smiths-like bridge. It's the most beauti
ful moment on the album, an exact metaphor for
the two extremes Interpol is trying to conquer.
Unfortunately, as my preceding examples
have no doubt established, the lyrics on this
album are mostly subpar, absent are the obses
sive narratives of their debut and the tantalizing
images that made us lust after mythical charac
ters like Stella — a diver who fell (fatally)
through an open manhole. In fact, the band fairs
better on "Antics" only when it sheds its nauti
cal ambitions ("you'll never see a finer ship in
your life" ... right) fora more virtuous and
earnest stride.
