â€¢
Formerly an art student in San Francisco,
Dcvcndra Banhart is perfect in his role as the
new darling of the acoustic 10-fi scene. His ec

"Attack of the Attacking Things" and has just
followed up with the LP "This Week." The
only disappointment of the new record is that
it doesn't include the B-side "Keep Livin'," al

City this week.
James Yorkston and the Athletes
The cult popularity of James Yorkston and his
hand is surprising considering how un-trendy
their music is. I mean, this band has a dedicated
accordionist. Are people appreciating music for
being just plain good? James Yorkston's unde-
