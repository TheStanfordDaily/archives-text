# Making it big underground artists who haven't sold out yet

### BONNIE JOHNSON INTERMISSION WRITER 
Dcvcndra Banhart
•
Formerly an art student in San Francisco,
Dcvcndra Banhart is perfect in his role as the
new darling of the acoustic 10-fi scene. His ec
centric, pared-down folk style makes it diffi
cult to tell when he's being tongue-in-cheek
and when he means business (if he ever does),
but it's hard not to love the queries addressed
to animals and the finger-picking backed by

tambourine. As a companion to spring's "Re
joicing in the Hands," Banhart has released
"Nino Rojo," the highlight of which is the love
song "At the Hop" (it sounds nothing like
whatever you imagine you would hear at the
fabled "hop"). Banhart performed at this
year's South by Southwest showcase. He is
currently on tour in Europe.
Jean Grae
It's always hard for female hip-hop artists to
escape comparisons with Lauryn Hill; a lot of

us have impatiently awaited a match for"The
Miseducation ..." for the past six years.
While you won't find it in Jean Grae's short
catalogue, Grae has her own distinct appeal
that's tougher, rawer and more playful. More
concerned with the trials an J pleasures of daily
life than with grand notions of justice and spir
ituality, Grae won a lot of followers with 2002's
"Attack of the Attacking Things" and has just
followed up with the LP "This Week." The
only disappointment of the new record is that
it doesn't include the B-side "Keep Livin'," al
though you can find it on Okay Player's "True

Notes Volume One" compilation. Grae is per
forming at the CMJ conference in New York
City this week.
James Yorkston and the Athletes
The cult popularity of James Yorkston and his
hand is surprising considering how un-trendy
their music is. I mean, this band has a dedicated
accordionist. Are people appreciating music for
being just plain good? James Yorkston's unde-
for Yorkston's acoustic melodies and
romantic, lilting vocals.
Listening to 2(K)2's "Moving up
Country" and the new "Just Beyond
the River," it's hard not to imagine
winter in the musicians' native Scot
land. Yorkston performed with the
Athletes at this year's All Tomor
row's Parties festival. He is currently

on tour in the United Kingdom.
Scout Niblett
Easily recognizable in her blond
wigs. Scout Niblett occupies a unique
and increasingly noticed niche in the
universe of English independent
rock. Telling stories of magic and

niably beautiful songwriting and
arrangements make it easier to un
derstand why the hipsters (including
the ones at Domino Records) have
taken up his cause. Piano, harmonica
and lap steel help to create a cozy bed

vulnerability, Niblett alternates be
tween drums and guitar on her solid
debut "Sweet Heart Fever" and
even-better sophomore release "I
Am," as well as in live shows. It will
almost be a shame when Niblett
makes the inevitable transition to
larger venues, because hers is inti
mate music, sonically and emotional-

ly naked. Check out her brand new
EP Uptown "Top Ranking," which
features her gig-staple cover of the
reggae classic along with two new
songs. Niblett played at this year's
South by Southwest showcase. She is
currently on tour in the Midwest.

hart will be in San Francisco next month.
