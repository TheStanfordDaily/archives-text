The Cardinal make their first visit to Pullman since 2000, where they hope to snap a three-game losing streak against
the Cougars, including a 24-14 setback at Stanford Stadium last season. Stanford and Washington State enter to
morrow's conference clash with identical (3-2, l-l) records and both schools are coming off losses in which they let
second-half leads slip away. A Cardinal win would help dull the sting that still remains from last week's 23-15 loss at
Notre Dame. A loss and, well, we'd rather not go there. Here are three matchups to watch:

WSU WR Jason Hill vs. Stanford Secondary

Hill, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound sophomore and San Francisco na
tive. has hauled in 17 catches for 483 yards through five games
this season. Those are solid numbers in their own right, but what
makes him one to watch is the fact that seven of his last nine re
ceptions have gone for touchdowns. Since being held to two
catches for just 34 yards in the Cougars' season-opening win
over New Mexico. Hill has eight touchdowns, making him a
threat to score every time he touches the ball. Stanford's passing
defense currently ranks 78th in the nation.

Stanford WR Evan Moore vs.
Washington State Secondary
The Cougars aren't the only team who could look to air it out Sat
urday. Oregon's Kellen Clemens shredded the Washington State
secondary fora career-high 437 yards and three touchdowns in
the Ducks' come-from-behind win last week. The biggest — lit
erally — thorn in the Cougars' side? Oregon's Tim Day, a 6-foot -
4,265-pound beast of a tight end who caught eight passes for 152

yards and two touchdowns. Though
he's 30 pounds slimmer, Moore's
got three inches on Day and
showed the ability to shake off
would-be tacklers like fleas against
Notre Dame. Tight end Alex Smith
could also have a big day.

Stanford vs. The Cardinal
Yeah, that's right. Playing the Cougars in front of 37,00() fans at cozy Mar
tin Stadium is enough of a challenge that Stanford can't afford to help the
home team's cause with mental mistakes and turnovers.

Stanford vs. The Cardinal
Yeah, that's right. Playing the Cougars in front of 37,00() fans at cozy Mar
tin Stadium is enough of a challenge that Stanford can't afford to help the
home team's cause with mental mistakes and turnovers.

The Cardinal make their first visit to Pullman since 2000, where they hope to snap a three-game losing streak against
the Cougars, including a 24-14 setback at Stanford Stadium last season. Stanford and Washington State enter to
morrow's conference clash with identical (3-2, l-l) records and both schools are coming off losses in which they let
second-half leads slip away. A Cardinal win would help dull the sting that still remains from last week's 23-15 loss at
Notre Dame. A loss and, well, we'd rather not go there. Here are three matchups to watch:

WSU WR Jason Hill vs. Stanford Secondary

Hill, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound sophomore and San Francisco na
tive. has hauled in 17 catches for 483 yards through five games
this season. Those are solid numbers in their own right, but what
makes him one to watch is the fact that seven of his last nine re
ceptions have gone for touchdowns. Since being held to two
catches for just 34 yards in the Cougars' season-opening win
over New Mexico. Hill has eight touchdowns, making him a
threat to score every time he touches the ball. Stanford's passing
defense currently ranks 78th in the nation.

Stanford WR Evan Moore vs.
Washington State Secondary
The Cougars aren't the only team who could look to air it out Sat
urday. Oregon's Kellen Clemens shredded the Washington State
secondary fora career-high 437 yards and three touchdowns in
the Ducks' come-from-behind win last week. The biggest — lit
erally — thorn in the Cougars' side? Oregon's Tim Day, a 6-foot -
4,265-pound beast of a tight end who caught eight passes for 152

yards and two touchdowns. Though
he's 30 pounds slimmer, Moore's
got three inches on Day and
showed the ability to shake off
would-be tacklers like fleas against
Notre Dame. Tight end Alex Smith
could also have a big day.

Stanford vs. The Cardinal
Yeah, that's right. Playing the Cougars in front of 37,00() fans at cozy Mar
tin Stadium is enough of a challenge that Stanford can't afford to help the
home team's cause with mental mistakes and turnovers.
