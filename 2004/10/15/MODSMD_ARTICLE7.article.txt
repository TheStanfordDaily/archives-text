# Rushing does double-duty for Card

### ALEX GYR 
It's quite an accomplishment to he the top kick returner
in any given conference. But the fact that Stanford's T.J.
Rushing is competing against the likes of USCs Reggie
Bush — one of the most exciting and explosive players in
the country — for that title in the Pacific-10 Conference,
his position atop the leader hoard in yards per return is par
ticularly impressive.
But when asked to describe what he does to return the
ball with such success. Rushing's answer is simple.
"I just concentrate on catching the ball first, of course,
and then 1 just run as hard as I can, and put my faith in the
wedge," the junior said.
Rushing, who serves as a cornerback in the Cardinal
secondary when not returning kicks, has sparkled as the
team's No. I return man, averaging 33.6 yards per chance,
including a W-yard return fora touchdown against BYU.
Rushing grew up in Pauls Valley, Okla., where he gar
nered All-State honors in football, All-County honors in
basketball and was a state champion sprinter. While he has
given up hoops at Stanford, Rushing remains a multi-sport
athlete as a member of the Stanford track team.
His decision to leave the Midwest and come to Stanford
was based largely on what he perceived as the pass-happy
nature of football on the West Coast.
"The Pac-10 is a great conference for cornerbacks,"
Rushing said. "They always throw the ball. If you play in
the Big 12, all they do is run the ball."
This desire to make plays and create action on the field
is the type of quality that makes Rushing such a dangerous
kick returner.
"Anytime I get a chance to get my hands on the ball I
try to make it easier for the offense to score, put them in
great field position and help them get a victor)," Rushing
said.
His touchdown against BYU did just that, as Stanford
stormed to a 37-10 victory after being down 10-0 early. It
was the third-longest kickoff runback in Stanford history
and the first kickoff return fora touchdown since 19%.
A big part of Rushing's success comes from his explo
sive speed. He is a sprinter for the Cardinal track and field
team, running the l(X)-meter dash and the 4 x 100 relay.
Last year he posted a time of 10.68 seconds for 1 (X) meters,
the second-fastest time on the squad.
Rushing has to maintain a sturdy work ethic in order to
be successful in two varsity sports at Stanford while keep
ing up g<xxJ grades.
"I just have to stay focused a little more," he said. "Dur
ing the spring, whenever guys have time off, I have lifting in
the morning and then I also have track in the afternoon. I'm
pretty tired after a full day. but you still have to focus on
your academics."
While Rushing is a standout kick returner, he is also a
vital member of the Cardinal defensive secondary. The
Stanford defense has relied on Rushing, along with fellow
corners Leigh Torrence and Stanley Wilson, to keep op
posing passing games in check.
Rushing, who has IS tackles, including four fora loss,
and a fumble recovery, discussed the approach that he and
his fellow defenders bring to the table each week.
"I like our attitude," he said. "We're all out there real
cocky, real confident. We think we are the stuff, that we
can't be beat, that no one can score on us."
In Rushtng's eyes, the difference between this year's
team compared to past years is that the team has more con
fidence in their talent, which backs up that cocky and ag
gressive attitude and creates a resilient approach on both
sides of the ball.
"A big thing this year is confidence," he said. "Last year,
if one bad play happened, we would fold the tent. This year
if one bad play happens we are confident enough to come
back and make plays and fight back and win the game."
Rushing hopes that this attitude carries over to this week

end's game at Washington State, a team with big-play abili
ty
"Washington State is a great team," Rushing said.
"When we're on defense they will throw the ball deep.
Their offense is loaded with stars, their wide receivers are
really good and they have a great quarterback."
While the Cardinal prepare for this weekend's
matchup. Rushing is excited at the chance to play the role

of spoiler on the road.
"I like to ruin people's home games, go up there and
make their crowd sad," Rushing said.
If Rushing does his part — returning kicks and shutting
down the Washington State receivers — there's a good
chance the Cardinal will head dampen the spirits of the
Cougar faithful in Pullman and head back to Stanford with
a victory.
