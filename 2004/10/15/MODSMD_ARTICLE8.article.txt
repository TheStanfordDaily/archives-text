# Nanoscale center pairs research, outreach

It's a small world after all, thanks
to nanotechnology.
With a new grant from the Na
tional Science Foundation, re
searchers at Stanford's Center for
Probing the Nanoscale hope to fund
work that might produce exciting
new technologies and also to rein
vigorate waning student interest in
the life sciences.
The National Science Founda
tion announced on Oct. 1 the
awarding of a $7.5 million grant to
fund the Center for Probing the
Nanoscale, a partnership between
the University and companies like
IBM. where researches look for
ways to shrink various manufactur
ing. computer and medical tech
nologies and to develop nanoscale
tools.
Kathryn Moler. associate pro
fessor of physics and applied
physics and co-director for the cen
ter, said researchers here will focus
primarily on ways to visualize and
manipulate objects at the nanoscale
level.
The center will put some of the
grant money toward educational
outreach at middle schools, while a

substantial amount of it will go to
ward research projects.
Stanford scientists said they see
the potential for nanotechnology to
produce patents that could be prof
itable for the University.
Nanotechnology, the technique
of making and characterizing ob
jects smaller than 100 nanometers
(smaller than the wavelength of
light), will revolutionize technolo
gies in a broad array of fields, ar
gued David Goldhaber-Gordon,
assistant professor of physics and
the other co-director of the center.
"Finely structured particles are
important for chemistry and cataly
sis," Goldhaber-Gordon said.
"Hard drives need ways to pack
more information onto a smaller
area. In computing [nanotech] will
be important for creating bigger
memories and more powerful pro
cessors."
