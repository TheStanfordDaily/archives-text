# Nanoscale center pairs research, outreach
## 
### JEFFREY ERFE 
It's a small world after all, thanks
to nanotechnology.
With a new grant from the Na
tional Science Foundation, re
searchers at Stanford's Center for
Probing the Nanoscale hope to fund
work that might produce exciting
new technologies and also to rein
vigorate waning student interest in
the life sciences.
The National Science Founda
tion announced on Oct. 1 the
awarding of a $7.5 million grant to
fund the Center for Probing the
Nanoscale, a partnership between
the University and companies like
IBM. where researches look for
ways to shrink various manufactur
ing. computer and medical tech
nologies and to develop nanoscale
tools.
Kathryn Moler. associate pro
fessor of physics and applied
physics and co-director for the cen
ter, said researchers here will focus
primarily on ways to visualize and
manipulate objects at the nanoscale
level.
The center will put some of the
grant money toward educational
outreach at middle schools, while a

substantial amount of it will go to
ward research projects.
Stanford scientists said they see
the potential for nanotechnology to
produce patents that could be prof
itable for the University.
Nanotechnology, the technique
of making and characterizing ob
jects smaller than 100 nanometers
(smaller than the wavelength of
light), will revolutionize technolo
gies in a broad array of fields, ar
gued David Goldhaber-Gordon,
assistant professor of physics and
the other co-director of the center.
"Finely structured particles are
important for chemistry and cataly
sis," Goldhaber-Gordon said.
"Hard drives need ways to pack
more information onto a smaller
area. In computing [nanotech] will
be important for creating bigger
memories and more powerful pro
cessors."
Stanford's unique proposal
Stanford was one of six nan
otechnology centers across the
United States chosen by the Na
tional Science Foundation to re

ceive funding.
Goldhaber-Gordon said he be
lieves Stanford's grant proposal was
uniquely enticing because it not only
promoted the development of cut
ting-edge nanoscale tools but also
emphasized educational initiatives
for sectors of the populace that
would not ordinarily engage nan
otech issues.
"I think that both the NSF and
the grant review panel were im
pressed because we were doing
something different," he said.
The center plans to establish a
Summer Institute for Middle School
Teachers in order to train teachers
and to expose students to nanotech
and other technologies to stimulate
interest in science.
The Institute will bring two sets
of 20 teachers to Stanford for one
week over the summer and equip
them with tools for curriculum and

lesson plan development in the sci
ences.
The initial theme for the program
will be nanoscience.
"We thought that looking at
things on a nanometer scale would
be a very accessible and exciting
area of science for young students,"
Goldhaber-Gordon said.
\ funding "magnet"
David M. Berube, associate di
rector for nanoscience and technol
ogy studies at the University of
South Carolina and author of the
upcoming book Nanohype, said he
believes that educational initiatives
like these are magnets for govern
ment research funding.
Berube said that the government
is irrevocably committed to nan
otech because of its potential pay
offs lor the economy and for nation

al security.
By stimulating a "nanorevolu
tion," Berube said the government
could provide innumerable oppor
tunities fora new generation of star
tups and business investments that
could take the U.S. economy to new
levels.
He also affirmed the potential for
nanotech to construct finer sensors
for security threats, "imagine de
tecting anthrax particles in parts per
billion instead of parts per million,"
he said.
Finally, he said he believes that
nanotech will be integral in creating
better weapons systems and faster
computers.
Public education is the linchpin
for the nanotech revolution, accord
ing to Berube.
"The government is worried that
the right wing and the public will re
spond to nanotech like they have to

stem cell research.
"That's what legislators and edu
cators are thinking about. They're
brainstorming ways to bring the
public on board."
Moler seconded this sentiment.
"Educating the public about
nanoscience and technology is a
high priority for the NSF," he said.
A win-win scenario
Moler said that the research con
ducted at the center could eventual
ly benefit the University financially.
"We do hope that we will pro
duce useful and licensable patents,
which will return patent income to
the university to support new re
search," Moler said.
The government, on the other
hand, stands to gain by harnessing
the expertise of the top minds in the
field, which could strengthen na

tional security and economic devel
opment in the long run.
Of course, Goldhaber-Gordon's
said the importance of stimulating
student interest in the life sciences
cannot be underestimated.
"At the start of middle-school
most students are excited by science,
and by the end of middle-school
probably only about a third of them
are," he said.
Through the Summer Institute
for Middle-School Teachers, the
center aims to make science fun and
interesting for both students and
teachers.
"We want to find ways to help the
middle-school science teachers to
both excite the students about sci
ence and become excited them
selves because they can't teach well
if they're not excited," Goldhaber-
Gordon said.

Technology could lead to profitable patents

nanotech to construct finer sensors
for security threats, "imagine de
tecting anthrax particles in parts per
billion instead of parts per million,"
he said.
Finally, he said he believes that
nanotech will be integral in creating
better weapons systems and faster
computers.
Public education is the linchpin
for the nanotech revolution, accord
ing to Berube.
"The government is worried that
the right wing and the public will re
spond to nanotech like they have to

stem cell research.
"That's what legislators and edu
cators are thinking about. They're
brainstorming ways to bring the
public on board."
Moler seconded this sentiment.
"Educating the public about
nanoscience and technology is a
high priority for the NSF," he said.
A win-win scenario
Moler said that the research con
ducted at the center could eventual
ly benefit the University financially.
"We do hope that we will pro
duce useful and licensable patents,
which will return patent income to
the university to support new re
search," Moler said.
The government, on the other
hand, stands to gain by harnessing
the expertise of the top minds in the
field, which could strengthen na

tional security and economic devel
opment in the long run.
Of course, Goldhaber-Gordon's
said the importance of stimulating
student interest in the life sciences
cannot be underestimated.
"At the start of middle-school
most students are excited by science,
and by the end of middle-school
probably only about a third of them
are," he said.
Through the Summer Institute
for Middle-School Teachers, the
center aims to make science fun and
interesting for both students and
teachers.
"We want to find ways to help the
middle-school science teachers to
both excite the students about sci
ence and become excited them
selves because they can't teach well
if they're not excited," Goldhaber-
Gordon said.

Technology could lead to profitable patents
It's a small world after all, thanks
to nanotechnology.
With a new grant from the Na
tional Science Foundation, re
searchers at Stanford's Center for
Probing the Nanoscale hope to fund
work that might produce exciting
new technologies and also to rein
vigorate waning student interest in
the life sciences.
The National Science Founda
tion announced on Oct. 1 the
awarding of a $7.5 million grant to
fund the Center for Probing the
Nanoscale, a partnership between
the University and companies like
IBM. where researches look for
ways to shrink various manufactur
ing. computer and medical tech
nologies and to develop nanoscale
tools.
Kathryn Moler. associate pro
fessor of physics and applied
physics and co-director for the cen
ter, said researchers here will focus
primarily on ways to visualize and
manipulate objects at the nanoscale
level.
The center will put some of the
grant money toward educational
outreach at middle schools, while a

substantial amount of it will go to
ward research projects.
Stanford scientists said they see
the potential for nanotechnology to
produce patents that could be prof
itable for the University.
Nanotechnology, the technique
of making and characterizing ob
jects smaller than 100 nanometers
(smaller than the wavelength of
light), will revolutionize technolo
gies in a broad array of fields, ar
gued David Goldhaber-Gordon,
assistant professor of physics and
the other co-director of the center.
"Finely structured particles are
important for chemistry and cataly
sis," Goldhaber-Gordon said.
"Hard drives need ways to pack
more information onto a smaller
area. In computing [nanotech] will
be important for creating bigger
memories and more powerful pro
cessors."
Stanford's unique proposal
Stanford was one of six nan
otechnology centers across the
United States chosen by the Na
tional Science Foundation to re

ceive funding.
Goldhaber-Gordon said he be
lieves Stanford's grant proposal was
uniquely enticing because it not only
promoted the development of cut
ting-edge nanoscale tools but also
emphasized educational initiatives
for sectors of the populace that
would not ordinarily engage nan
otech issues.
"I think that both the NSF and
the grant review panel were im
pressed because we were doing
something different," he said.
The center plans to establish a
Summer Institute for Middle School
Teachers in order to train teachers
and to expose students to nanotech
and other technologies to stimulate
interest in science.
The Institute will bring two sets
of 20 teachers to Stanford for one
week over the summer and equip
them with tools for curriculum and

lesson plan development in the sci
ences.
The initial theme for the program
will be nanoscience.
"We thought that looking at
things on a nanometer scale would
be a very accessible and exciting
area of science for young students,"
Goldhaber-Gordon said.
\ funding "magnet"
David M. Berube, associate di
rector for nanoscience and technol
ogy studies at the University of
South Carolina and author of the
upcoming book Nanohype, said he
believes that educational initiatives
like these are magnets for govern
ment research funding.
Berube said that the government
is irrevocably committed to nan
otech because of its potential pay
offs lor the economy and for nation

al security.
By stimulating a "nanorevolu
tion," Berube said the government
could provide innumerable oppor
tunities fora new generation of star
tups and business investments that
could take the U.S. economy to new
levels.
He also affirmed the potential for
nanotech to construct finer sensors
for security threats, "imagine de
