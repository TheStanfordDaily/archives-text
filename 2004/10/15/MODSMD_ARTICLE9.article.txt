## GSC examines funding policy 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Graduate Student
Council is debating whether it
should fund on-campus religious
groups.
"Funding religious groups is a
challenging aspect of our organiza
tion's responsibility for allocating
money to student groups," said Mo
riah Thomason, chair of the GSC
and a fourth-year neurosciences
Ph.D. candidate.
"Our graduate student popula
tion is diverse, and therefore we all
subscribe to different beliefs, and
come from different cultural, social,
and economic backgrounds," she

said. "We are committed to making
the best decisions on behalf of all
students."
Currently, the GSC has no policy
for dealing with religious groups.
Stanford's undergraduate com
munity funds many organizations,
including religious groups, through
the ASSU general fee. Senior Chris
Lin, chair of the undergraduate sen
ate, explained the funding process.
According to Lin, groups, includ
ing religious organizations, submit
an online application for funding
through the ASSU's Web site and
then must schedule an interview
with the Senate Appropriations
Committee. The committee makes a
recommendation, and the Senate

votes to confirm funding. Lin esti
mates that more than 100 under
graduate groups are funded this way.
To come to a decision regarding
religious groups, the GSC has sched
uled a meeting with Dean of Reli
gious Life Rev. Scotty McLennan.
Thomason indicated that funding
or support for such groups may ulti
mately be indirect.
"Our standards discourage us
from funding groups with religious
or political agendas, but it is possible
that alternate sources may be estab
lished, and we may be able to help,"
she said.
"Diversity is a value we subscribe
to, and thus, this is an open discus
sion: No policy has been defined.

and we will work to help these stu
dents to endeavor to provide oppor
tunities to our student community."
So far, the GSC has dealt specifi
cally with the Inter Varsity Graduate
Christian Fellowship at Stanford
and the Chinese Campus Evangelis
tic Fellowship.
But Thomason said that the
GSC's decision could affect dozens
of other religious and spiritual
groups on campus.
"We are committed to making
the best decisions on behalf of all
students, so we will not stop working
to find solutions even after the fund
ing proposals of the religious student
organizations have come and gone,"
Thomason said.
