# Grad student center opens to fanfare
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In an event that capped years of
planning, the new Graduate Com
munity Center was officially dedicat
ed by University officials and the
building's donor in an outdoor cere
mony Friday morning.
In his remarks to the approxi
mately 80 community members in
attendance. University Provost John
Etchemendy called the center "an
amazing new development" that he
hoped would "create an even
stronger, more supportive commu
nity for [graduate students]."
Etchemendy credited donor John
Arrillaga. Class of 1%0. for "making
the dream possible." He presented
Arrillaga with an award — a stat
uette made from a tile of Encina
Gym's old roof. The tile is symbolic
of another project that Arrillaga is fi
nancially supporting — the develop
ment of a new recreational athletic
center located on the old Encina
Gym site. The gym's clay roof tiles
were also used to roof the graduate
center.
Arrillaga urged students to re
spect and preserve the new struc

ture.
"Please take care of the build
ing... keep it really special," he said.
He advised students to "think of
[the center] as your own living room,
something that is special in your
heart, because this building is in
mine."
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni praised the build
ing's swift development after con
struction started last January. '"This
came out of the ground at warp
speed, by University standards," he
said. "To have this built in a year is
unbelievable."
Shirley Everett, associate vice
provost for Residential and Dining
Enterprises, compared the new
building's multi-functionality to
"one-stop shopping ... it's all right
here," she said.
The center fills a physical need
for Stanford's 7,600-strong graduate
student population. It is expected to
serve as a general hub for student life
with its ample social, academic and
recreational facilities, including a
pub. television room, meeting space
and children's play area.
Roger Stanley, the Graduate Stu
dent Council Deputy Chair and a

second-year student at the Graduate
School of Business, said the center
was worth the wait.

"It's so wonderful to finally see it
come to pass," he said. "This is years
in the making."
