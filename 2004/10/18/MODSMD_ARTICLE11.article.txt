Jamie Oliver. Maybe you know
who he is. We certainly do. He's
the man behind the Food Net
work's underappreciated show.
The Naked Chef.
Jamie is one pretty cool dude with
many very cool friends, and that (com
bined with his dashing good looks and
British charm) is really what sets him
apart from the regular riff-raff of bland
ly flavored cooking personalities.
Everyone knows about the Iron
Chef, the poorly dubbed palate-teasing
showdown that rose to Western domi
nance in the earlier part of the millen
nium. Everyone knows about Emeril

Lagasse, the ob
noxious N'Or
leans chef who
thought success
with a cleaver
and a strainer
would translate
into stardom in
a half-brained
comedy sitcom
about himself.
Bam!
Yet not ev
eryone knows
about Jamie
Oliver, and that's
just one of many

things that have gone awry in this crazy
world we live in.
What is it about Jamie Oliver? For
get about his sauteing skills or even his
blessed creativity in contrasting tex
tures and flavors. None of that matters
in cooking. We watch The Naked Chef
because Jamie knows a bunch of great
birds and blokes, and he has a funda
mental understanding that they matter
just as much as — if not more than —
the food.
We really wish that we had more in
common with Jamie. Stanford would
be a lot better off if more people did.
It'd be a good excuse to meet up with
old friends and reduce lost income from
Stern dining freeloading, and it would
hopefully make two guys cooking to
gether seem a lot less questionable.
So we're trying our best — every
couple of weeks foregoing the ease of
ordering Domino's in exchange fora
home-cooked culinary disaster pre
pared for our friends.
Granted, Iron Chef has its moments.
Both master and challenger can whip
up some pretty crazy stuff with just a
cuttlefish and a spiny sea urchin or two.
Emeril Lagasse never has his mo
ments. We don't care how good his
"Baked Alaska" is; his unbearably bub
bly banter always leaves a bad taste in
our mouths. Bam!
Back to Jamie. Here's what the
Food Network's Web site has to say:
"From musicians to fashion models to
magicians to NFL kickers, everyone is
invited back to the Oliver flat fora meal
they'll never forget."
That's really an all-star lineup of
friends. And as awesome as magicians
are, those NFL kickers are the real
kicker(s).
Who would pass up an invitation to
hang out with this guy? You're guaran
teed to be in good company at a smash
ing London loft. The portions might be
small and vegetarian, but count us in to
come back time and time again.
When it comes to placing friends
over food, Jamie seems to agree. In his
2002 Playboy interview (Yeah, that's
right. How many Iron Chefs get Play
boy interviews? None, so spit out your
Trident and chew on that.), Jamie was
asked if it's just about the food.
He said, "I'm a great believer that
it's not... If you can cook just a few
dishes good, once she walks in the door
you make it all seem effortless and re
laxed ... She'll be on you like a rash."
Rashes. Brilliant.
Cooking a good meal with and / or
for friends really is one of the finer joys
in life, though. Even if the meal doesn 't
pan out perfectly (as it rarely does
when we're behind the stove), you'll
still have gotten something to eat.
Maybe. But as long as you can make a
few dishes decently, you'll be fancying
some Calomine lotion in no time, old
sport.
Well, it's been a little slice of heaven.
Bam!

That's really an all-star lineup of
friends. And as awesome as magicians
are, those NFL kickers are the real
kicker(s).
Who would pass up an invitation to
hang out with this guy? You're guaran
teed to be in good company at a smash
ing London loft. The portions might be
small and vegetarian, but count us in to
come back time and time again.
When it comes to placing friends
over food, Jamie seems to agree. In his
2002 Playboy interview (Yeah, that's
right. How many Iron Chefs get Play
boy interviews? None, so spit out your
Trident and chew on that.), Jamie was
asked if it's just about the food.
He said, "I'm a great believer that
it's not... If you can cook just a few
dishes good, once she walks in the door
you make it all seem effortless and re
laxed ... She'll be on you like a rash."
Rashes. Brilliant.
Cooking a good meal with and / or
for friends really is one of the finer joys
in life, though. Even if the meal doesn 't
pan out perfectly (as it rarely does
when we're behind the stove), you'll
still have gotten something to eat.
Maybe. But as long as you can make a
few dishes decently, you'll be fancying
some Calomine lotion in no time, old
sport.
Well, it's been a little slice of heaven.
Bam!
