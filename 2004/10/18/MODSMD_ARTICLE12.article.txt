# Why students are taking the LSAT...
## Back-up or career plan: the pull of law school 
### CAROLINA VILCHIS 
After spending four hours answering
roughly 130 questions, students complete the
first step in the law school application process
â€” the LSAT. A growing number of students
are taking the Law School Admission Test, a
half-day standardized exam that consists of
five multiple-choice sections and a writing
component.
With the job market tightening, more

students are choosing to
apply to graduate schools.
Law school, due to the flexi
bility of prerequisites and di
verse undergraduate back
grounds eligible to apply, is
one of the more popular de
grees pursued by indecisive
students and lawyer hope
fuls alike as they prepare to
leave college.
Senior Ellen Crisham plans
on attending law school after
taking a few years to do other
things.
"1 actually don't plan on at
tending law school right
away," Crisham said. "1 am
hoping to do some sort of com
munity service, possibly teach
ing. fora couple of years be
fore 1 apply."
Even though Crisham does
not plan on applying to law
school for the next few years,
she will take the LSAT in De
cember.
"While in college I will be
able to best prepare and be in
the best state of mind needed
to take the test," she said.
According to data collected
by the Law School Admission
Council, there has been a 33
percent increase in the num
ber of tests administered since
2000.

However, the rise in test
takers and law school applicants over the
years may be cyclical, said Wendy Margolis,
director of communications for the Law
School Admission Council.
"Interest in law school sometimes increas
es when the job market is tight." Margolis
said. "People opt to go to graduate school
hoping that the job outlook will be better
when they finish."
Other factors also contribute to the
rise in students taking the LSAT. Senior
Sarala Nagala. president of the Stanford
Pre-law Society, speculates that the ver

satility of a law degree makes law school
more attractive.
"Law degrees are applicable to a vast num
ber of fields and law schools accept students
from almost every undergraduate major,"
Nagala said. "Because there are no strict pre
requisites, students from all disciplines can
take the LSAT and apply [to law school]. Law
degrees are also highly applicable in the pri
vate, public and nongovernmental sectors so
investment in a law decree can be satisfying

for many career paths."
Law school is also popular with students
who do not necessarily want to practice law in
the long term. For Gabe Soledad, a third-year
student at Stanford Law School, going to law
school right after graduation was an impor
tant step towards his career goal - working in
government making policy.
"1 hadn't really taken going to law school
all that seriously, as it seemed so distant," said
Soledad, who also completed his undergradu
ate studies at Stanford. "But, over the sum
mer [after junior year) a few of my closer

friends began studying for the LSAT. Once I
began thinking about law school it seemed the
obvious next step."
Susan Robinson, associate dean of career
services at the Law School, emphasizes the
skills learned in law school that are important
in other careers.
"Any career in which they value people
who are analysts, have strong writing skills
and communication skills will benefit from a
law degree," Robinson said.

Within the legal sector, students with a law
degree have a broad range of options. They
can work at law firms, for the government or a
public interest organization. They can also
work as a clerk or within the U.S. Department
of Justice.
Robison said that the career paths law
school graduates pursue have not really
changed in the past years. The opportunities
students can take advantage of are constant,
but different factors, such as economic trends,
make some career paths more popular at the
time students enter the employment market.

"Since the dot-com explosion, the demand
in corporate law, which was very popular, has
died down," Robinson said.
In the past three years there has been a
higher demand for litigators, due partly to
new laws and a changing economy.
Even though the number of students tak
ing the LSAT has increased, the number of
applicants to the Stanford Law school have
not risen significantly.
"We saw a slight drop in applications last

year in comparison with the pre
vious year," 1 said Faye Deal, asso
ciate dean of admissions and fi
nancial aid at the Law School. "In
addition, there was an increase in
the previous year over the year
before. So, it is difficult to talk
about specific trends."
This may be due to the fact
that not all students who take the
LSAT apply to law school direct
ly following their undergraduate
careers.
"Applicants across all age
ranges apply to law school," Deal
said. "You'll have some applying
directly from college, you'll have
some applying a few years away
from the undergraduate experi
ence, you'll have some applying
after building a career."
Deal urges students to
make sure they have taken advan
tage of opportunities that may not
be practical after beginning a law
career, such as gaining some work
experience, traveling, teaching or
getting published.
Many students say that
preparation for the LSAT is a cru
cial factor that determines suc
cess. Test-preparation companies
such as Kaplan and The Princeton
Review, as well as the LSAT
preparation-specific Test Masters
are popular among students who
hope that rigorous practice will
help them score higher.

"I obviously scored higher than I
would have without any preparation,"
said senior Peter Jaffe. who hopes to
work for the Office of Legal Advisory at
the State Department.
"Some sections of the test are totally intu
itive, hut other sections have very specific
strategies that are both necessary and non-in
tuitive."
The LSAT is administered in February,
June, October and December of every year.
The test is intended to measure logical rea
soning and reading comprehension.
