## Editorial A 						prudent reversal of policy 
### 
On Sunday, Oct. 10, Stanford barred the
Stanford Democrats from phone-bank
ing in White Plaza in order to protect
Stanford's non-profit tax status. After
the group's president, Kai Stinchcombe, threatened
the University with a free speech lawsuit, Stanford
reversed its policy, allowing political groups access
to White Plaza.
Because the administrations' actions opened
White Pla/a lip to all political groups while avoiding
a potential lawsuit. Stanford was light in changing
its policy.
Many people consider White Plaza to be the cen
ter of on-campus life, and it is the University's tra
ditional venue for student groups to make their
voice heard. 1 lad Stinchcombe's case gone to court,
his charge may have constituted a First Amend
ment violation.
More importantly, students benefit from the di
versity of views that are put forward in White Plaza.

Regardless of the perspective that is advocated, the
political activity encourages students to get in
formed and to vote at a time in history when youth
voting is particularly low.
By making the change in policy, the University
not only avoided a lawsuit but reconfirmed its com
mitment to this vision of White Plaza.
In addition, we believe that the new policy fixes
the situation to the satisfaction of the administra
tion and the Stanford Democrats. By allowing all
political parties access to White Pla/a, the adminis
tration can avoid partisanship and allow free speech
at the same time. When pressed with legal ramifica
tions. the University responded rapidly and respon
sibly.
In the future the administration would be well
advised to respond in a similar fashion, even if not
threatened by a lawsuit.
Stanford is also fortunate to have student ac
tivists like Stinchcombe fight for student rights.
