# Smoke and mirrors aside...
## The 						silent war that is fought every day at home 
### 
This past summer, I was re
turning to my dorm from
an event on Capitol Hill
and deeided to take the
scenic route through Washington,
D C. I hopped on a bus with the
words "Washington Hospital"
scrolling on the sign above its
doors, mistakenly expecting to ar
rive in a matter of minutes to
George Washington University
I iospital.
It turned out the bus was des
tined to a different hospital that
bore a similar name. Within view
of the Capitol, I had immediately
entered a more impoverished sec
tion of town littered with run
down shops and"for sale" signs,
with the occasional liquor store
standing as the only exception.
As the bus moved deeper into
the Southeast part of DC., 1 no
ticed 1 was the only non-Black on
the bus, and that a few of the
homeless and mentally disabled
individuals who first got on with
me were being joined by others.
Young black children strapped
with backpacks got on the same
bus. accompanied by mothers who
spoke nothing and wore tired fa
cial expressions. I wore a suit.
1 was in shock. 1 had a flash
back to the previous summer
when a Georgetown professor
claimed that poverty had ceased
to exist in the United States three
decades ago, a "fact" that the
other students and 1 gleefully
gulped without question as we
sought to construct a pristine,
free-market-perfected vision of
America.
But I wasn't sitting in a class
room that day. I was visiting the
real world as it didn't appear in
supply and demand curves.
There is a war in this country, al
beit one that's silent because the
side that is losing has lost hope. It is
fought not with weapons but with
apathy, ignorance, trivial argu
ments that speak past the issues,
and the symptomatic outgrowths of
a 300-year legacy of unequal rights

and the denial of basic freedoms.
In Starbucks shops across the
country, people like me might
spend our time discussing the war
in Iraq and war on terror and com
plaining about how biased Fox
News is. But where are the em-

bedded re
porters who
cover this silent
war?
During the
three presiden
tial debates and
one vice-presi
dential debate,
only two ques
tions were
asked concern-

ing people of color.
Vice President Cheney and Sen
ator Edwards were asked a ques
tion about the high incidence of
AIDS among African-American
women. Each talked about AIDS
in Africa.
President Bush and Senator
Kerry were asked about their
views on affirmative action.
Though Kerry answered the ques
tion. President Bush talked again
about his laughable "No Child
Left Behind" plan as a sort of
token, one-size-fits-all panacea for
all of America's social and eco
nomic woes.
The sad part is that our elected
officials would rather practice
Christmas-tree politics ("tax cuts
for all") than listen to the prob
lems of the historically oppressed
and silenced.
The statistics reveal that life in
America is disproportionately
worse for minorities today than it
was under President Clinton. It's
up to us to understand these issues
and bring visibility to them in the
real world.
If we don't, then we'll ha\2
missed the bus.
