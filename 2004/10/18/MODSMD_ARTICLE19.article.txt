Media focuses on Kerry's benign
statements instead of Bush's lies
Bush was caught in the third and
final debate lying when he denied ever
having said that he wasn't concerned
about Osama bin Laden. How is it
that the next day the right-wing cor
porate media made the big "scandal"
out to be that John Kerry mentioned
in public what Dick Cheney has al
ready mentioned several times in pub
lic. namely that Cheney's daughter is
gay?
If it wasn't "cheap and tawdry" for
Cheney himself to mention his daugh
ter's sexual orientation, then why
would this characterization apply to
Kerry's comments?
Bevond that, whv are we not hear

ingfrom Mary Cheney herself? What,
are Dick and Lynne keeping her
locked up in the "homo-basement"
lest she, by her mere existence, offend
the homophobic majority that com
prises the Republican Party?
Is she not allowed to speak for her
self? Or is Cheney still in denial with
regard to Mary's homosexuality in the
same way he is in denial about the fic
tional al-Qaeda / Iraq connection?
This is just more of the same: The
ultra-conservatives make a baseless
charge and their lackeys in the corpo
rate media jump to do their bidding,
making a scandal out of nothing while
ignoring the real story. Bush's false
denial of having claimed to be uncon
cerned about bin Laden.
Rumor has it that the scum who

make up the "Swift Boat Veterans for
(snicker) Truth" are gearing up for
another smear campaign. It would he
nice to see the U.S. media for once
show some backbone and ignore their
corporate masters and focus instead
on Bush's refusal to deny using co
caine.
The National Institute on Drug
Abuse lists as one of the lasting affects
of cocaine "a full-blown paranoid psy
chosis. in which the individual loses
touch with reality and experiences au
ditory hallucinations."
Given Bush's inability to ever
admit to a mistake like his bin Laden
comment, an investigation into his
prior drug use would be many times
more appropriate than hashing over
the same "Swift Boat" lies time and

time again.

Bush instills fear in order to pass
domestic agenda that curbs liberty
That's why John Kerry was actual
ly touching on something that many
Americans are worried about - that
this war on terrorism is transforming
us and our society, when it was sup
posed to be about uprooting the ter
rorists and transforming their soci
eties.
The Bush team's responses to
Kerry's musings are revealing be
cause they go to the very heart of
how much this administration has

become addicted to 9/11 wrote
New York Times contributor
Thomas L. Friedman.
Rep. Ron Paul said, "When people
face terrorism or great fear - from
whatever source - t he tendency to de
mand economic and physical security
over liberty and self-reliance proves
irresistible. The masses are easily led
to believe that security and liberty are
mutually exclusive, and demand for
security far exceeds that for liberty...
America is not now a ruthless author
itarian police state."
Obviously, we're aware of the dan
gers of terrorism, but we don't want to
see Sept. 11 being used as an opportu
nity to take away basic constitutional
rights. The thought police are on the
prowl, even in the so-called "land of

the free."
Your citizenship can be revoked,
and you can be summarily deported.
Or worse - you can be tried by a mili
tary tribunal, convicted on heresy and
secret evidence by a two-thirds vote
and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Can you identify the country 1 yet?
So Americans are moving toward a
police state, and not being dragged
along kicking and screaming, but
docilely following their leaders, like
sheep to the slaughter.
Nations and people are terrified of
terrorism, and many are quite willing
to give up all sorts of freedoms for the
sake of security.
