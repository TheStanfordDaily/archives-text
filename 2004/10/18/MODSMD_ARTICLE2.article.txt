# Film festival promotes tolerance
## The
						seventh annual United Nations Association film festival features films by a Stanford professor, students and alumni 
### COURTNEY WEAVER 
Starting Wednesday and until the end
of this week, the United Nations Associa
tion Film Festival will screen 27 films, four
of which feature work by Stanford affili
ates. that address human rights issues such
as abortion and capital punishment.
The filmmakers will be on site to hold
roundtable discussion about their works.
The annual event, started in IWB by
Jasmina Bojic, a Stanford film professor
and a film critic, will be held in Cubberley
and Annenberg Auditoriums.
Sponsored by the Stanford Film Society
and the United Nations Association Mid
peninsula Chapter, UNAFF was founded
on the 50th anniversary of the Declaration
of Human Rights.
It is open to the public, though free-of
charge only to Stanford students.

Junior Jessica Guh. a member of the
SFS, said that UNAFF "is unique in its
mission in that it's non-competitive.
"Human rights documentaries are real
ly important and don't get as much public
ity as they should," Guh said.
This year UNAFF received over 200
entries, up from 45 its first year. A 20-per
son panel made up of Stanford film profes
sionals. previous winners and SFS student
members selected the 27 films that fit this
year's theme of tolerance.
"We're looking for the films that pre
sent the moment that we breathe in."
Bojic said. "Something new, something
different."
Two Stanford graduate students, a
Stanford professor and a Stanford alum
nus each contributed to four selected.
