# Film festival promotes tolerance
## The 						seventh annual United Nations Association film festival features films by a Stanford professor, students and alumni 
### COURTNEY WEAVER 
Starting Wednesday and until the end
of this week, the United Nations Associa
tion Film Festival will screen 27 films, four
of which feature work by Stanford affili
ates. that address human rights issues such
as abortion and capital punishment.
The filmmakers will be on site to hold
roundtable discussion about their works.
The annual event, started in IWB by
Jasmina Bojic, a Stanford film professor
and a film critic, will be held in Cubberley
and Annenberg Auditoriums.
Sponsored by the Stanford Film Society
and the United Nations Association Mid
peninsula Chapter, UNAFF was founded
on the 50th anniversary of the Declaration
of Human Rights.
It is open to the public, though free-of
charge only to Stanford students.

Junior Jessica Guh. a member of the
SFS, said that UNAFF "is unique in its
mission in that it's non-competitive.
"Human rights documentaries are real
ly important and don't get as much public
ity as they should," Guh said.
This year UNAFF received over 200
entries, up from 45 its first year. A 20-per
son panel made up of Stanford film profes
sionals. previous winners and SFS student
members selected the 27 films that fit this
year's theme of tolerance.
"We're looking for the films that pre
sent the moment that we breathe in."
Bojic said. "Something new, something
different."
Two Stanford graduate students, a
Stanford professor and a Stanford alum
nus each contributed to four selected.
Lininy Award-winning producer and
Stanford graduate Rob Fruchtman's film
"Sister Helen" highlights the life of the
nun after whom the film is titled
After the death of her husband and two
sons while she was in her 60s, Sister Helen
underwent a conversion and began provid
ing tough love to recovering alcoholics and
drug addicts.


Communications Prof. Jan Krawitz's film, Big Enough,
highlights the difficulties dwarves face.
Fruchtman hopes his piece will make an
impact on the Palo Alto viewers.
"Perhaps my film will inspire or encourage
people in [Palo Alto] to help those struggling
with addiction," he told "Palo Alto Weekly"
the Oct. 15 edition. "Perhaps it will simply
open their eyes to the plight of another com
munity â€” and make them realize how lucky
they are to live in such a beautiful place."
Jan Krawitz, director of the graduate doc
umentary film and video program, produced
and directed "Big Enough" as a follow-up to
her 1982 film, "Little People," which profiled
the lives of dwarves. In 2(XX), Krawitz revisit
ed seven of the dwarves she had interviewed,
focusing on new difficulties they had encoun
tered as they aged.

"The film deals with the challenges that
they face both in a daily life and creating fami
lies if they want to do that," she explained.
She hopes that the film better educates the
public about dwarves and counters stereotypes
fostered culturally by fairy tales and movies.
"To put in the context of human rights and
tolerance makes a lot of sense," Krawitz said.
"The only thing that separates (dwarves] from
the rest of the population is their size. It's a
very curious kind of ostracism."
The subjects in Jones Obuadey's first film
deal with a similar type of stigmatism.
"Being Disabled." filmed in Ghana and
the United States and contributed to by Stan
ford communication graduate student Leigh
lacobucci, centers on acknowledging the

stereotypes that handicapped people face and
fight against. The film attempts to challenge
the theory that the words "handicapped" and
"disabled" are synonymous.
Katherine Leggett, another Stanford grad
uate student in the documentary film and
video program, began working on the film
"Deadline" as an intern in January 2003. The
feature-length film addresses the issue of the
death penalty in the state of Illinois and con
tains interviews with the condemned as well
as victims' family members.
After working with the film's interview
transcripts, Leggett edited over 100 hours of
footage and helped the produce shape the
story.
Legget, an assistant editor for the film,

rights at annual documentary film festival

feels a sense of "social involvement" with the
story.
"The filmmakers are making sure the films
can be seen across the country to motivate or
dinary Americans to reevaluate their posi
tions on the death penalty and to become
more informed about the issue, especially in
their own state," Leggett said.
Bojic is pleased that the featured docu
mentaries deal with the controversies that
they focus around.
"These films are really presenting the truth
of the [topics] with real characters," she said.
"Documentaries are one of the best tools for
students to learn about what's happening
around the world and to be intrigued and to
be involved in some of these issues."
