## Women's soccer shocked by 'Cats, downs Devils 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the past two weeks, the Stanford women's soccer team
has found its games to be characterized by heart-pounding ac
tion, overtimes and opposition corner kicks.
Nothing changed for the No. 16 Cardinal (9-3-2,1-1-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) on Friday night as they took on Pac-10
rival Arizona under the lights at Maloney Field. The two
teams battled it out for almost 108 minutes before the Wild
cats' Nikki David scored the game-winner off an Arizona cor
ner kick for the upset.
"I hate losing, and our team hates losing," said junior mid
fielder Leah Tapscott of Friday night's finish. "You don't feel
more frustrated than that."
Prior to Friday, the Cardinal had reeled off nine straight
games without a loss, posting wins over schools like Yale and
St. Mary's. Their 7-0-2 record over this span helped propel
them back into the national rankings, where they have been
ever since.
On the other hand, the win comes as an important mile
stone for the No. 24 Wildcats (12-3-0,3-1-0 Pac-10), who con

tinue their unexpected run as one of the Pac-10's most feared
teams. The victory was their first over the Cardinal in school
history, bringing their all-time record to 1-9 against Stanford.
The Cardinal began the first half a bit slow on Friday, man
aging just one shot on goal despite earning three corner kicks.
Fortunately, the Cardinal defense was strong on the other side
of the ball, holding an explosive Wildcat offense to just two
shots in the half.
The Cardinal offense appeared rejuvenated in the second
half thanks to senior forward Marcie Ward, who accounted
for six of the team's 11 shots on the night. Four of the Cardi
nal's seven shots in the half came within the final four minutes
of play, as the offense tried desperately to put the game away.
The Wildcat defense was able to hold off the Cardinal's
late attack to force the game into overtime. Goalkeeper Mc-
Call Smith was the cornerstone of the defense, racking up
seven saves on the night and five in the second half.
The first overtime session saw an even match-up as both
teams put up two shots on goal without scoring. In the second
overtime, however, the Wildcats held the edge, posting four
shots to the Cardinal's one.
With less than three minutes remaining, the Wildcats were

the ones who finally found a big break. David got the rebound
off of a Wildcat corner kick and converted by connecting with
the back of the net.
Indeed, the Achilles' heel of the Cardinal defense this sea
son has been its inability to stop corner kicks from turning into
goals. Of the four goals the Cardinal have allowed in their past
four games, three of them have come off of corner kicks.
"Lately, the only way teams can score on us is on set plays,
which is extremely frustrating," said junior midfielder Jenny
Farenbaugh. "As a team, we know we must be organized on
corner kicks and set plays."
Senior goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart was stellar between the
posts, collecting six saves on the evening.
Even more impressively, however, Barnhart was in Kansas
City. MO the next day playing with the U.S. National Team,
which she was asked to join last week. She will continue to
play with both squads for the rest of the season.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, Barnhart was back in uni
form on Sunday for the team's second game of the weekend,
this time against Arizona State (6-7-1,2-1-1 Pac-10). The Car-

cats' Nikki David scored the game-winner off an Arizona cor
ner kick for the upset.
"I hate losing, and our team hates losing," said junior mid
fielder Leah Tapscott of Friday night's finish. "You don't feel
more frustrated than that."
Prior to Friday, the Cardinal had reeled off nine straight
games without a loss, posting wins over schools like Yale and
St. Mary's. Their 7-0-2 record over this span helped propel
them back into the national rankings, where they have been
ever since.
On the other hand, the win comes as an important mile
stone for the No. 24 Wildcats (12-3-0,3-1-0 Pac-10), who con

tinue their unexpected run as one of the Pac-10's most feared
teams. The victory was their first over the Cardinal in school
history, bringing their all-time record to 1-9 against Stanford.
The Cardinal began the first half a bit slow on Friday, man
aging just one shot on goal despite earning three corner kicks.
Fortunately, the Cardinal defense was strong on the other side
of the ball, holding an explosive Wildcat offense to just two
shots in the half.
The Cardinal offense appeared rejuvenated in the second
half thanks to senior forward Marcie Ward, who accounted
for six of the team's 11 shots on the night. Four of the Cardi
nal's seven shots in the half came within the final four minutes
of play, as the offense tried desperately to put the game away.
The Wildcat defense was able to hold off the Cardinal's
late attack to force the game into overtime. Goalkeeper Mc-
Call Smith was the cornerstone of the defense, racking up
seven saves on the night and five in the second half.
The first overtime session saw an even match-up as both
teams put up two shots on goal without scoring. In the second
overtime, however, the Wildcats held the edge, posting four
shots to the Cardinal's one.
With less than three minutes remaining, the Wildcats were

the ones who finally found a big break. David got the rebound
off of a Wildcat corner kick and converted by connecting with
the back of the net.
Indeed, the Achilles' heel of the Cardinal defense this sea
son has been its inability to stop corner kicks from turning into
goals. Of the four goals the Cardinal have allowed in their past
four games, three of them have come off of corner kicks.
"Lately, the only way teams can score on us is on set plays,
which is extremely frustrating," said junior midfielder Jenny
Farenbaugh. "As a team, we know we must be organized on
corner kicks and set plays."
Senior goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart was stellar between the
posts, collecting six saves on the evening.
Even more impressively, however, Barnhart was in Kansas
City. MO the next day playing with the U.S. National Team,
which she was asked to join last week. She will continue to
play with both squads for the rest of the season.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, Barnhart was back in uni
form on Sunday for the team's second game of the weekend,
this time against Arizona State (6-7-1,2-1-1 Pac-10). The Car-

For the past two weeks, the Stanford women's soccer team
has found its games to be characterized by heart-pounding ac
tion, overtimes and opposition corner kicks.
Nothing changed for the No. 16 Cardinal (9-3-2,1-1-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) on Friday night as they took on Pac-10
rival Arizona under the lights at Maloney Field. The two
teams battled it out for almost 108 minutes before the Wild
cats' Nikki David scored the game-winner off an Arizona cor
ner kick for the upset.
"I hate losing, and our team hates losing," said junior mid
fielder Leah Tapscott of Friday night's finish. "You don't feel
