Author's admission: Foremost, I want
to acknowledge that this column will
only tangentially involve sports. How
ever, as proven by one Julie Ruvolo last year,
in order to be a sports columnist for the Stan
ford Daily, writing about sports is not exactly
necessary. In fact, I'm pretty certain she
proved that the art of sports writing involves
little more than writing about jersey chasing

and hating on runners.
I would like to think that
through my first two
columns, I have established
more sports credibility than
Julie gained in her entire
tenure. With that stated,
here's my story.
This past weekend I was
traveling to lovely Terre
Haute, Indiana, home of a
Pre-National Cross Country

race, the federal penitentiary where Timothy

On the plane ride from Minneapolis to Indi

stomach (an odd, albeit endearing move, one
which he claimed had worked with many a
lady). Of course, the drinking did not actually
stop in the airport, as he sagely invested an
other $20 in alcohol over the course of the 90-
minute flight.
Ironically, this was also a man who, in order
to travel to a hardware trade show in Indi
anapolis, had needed to borrow money from
his mother to purchase the plane ticket. Bot
tom line: this was a drunk Montanan, bent on
explaining his entire life story to me, anyone in
our section, and roughly anyone within a close
proximity of 100 feet.
Thus, presented below is the Gospel about
Montana, according to a drunk and often inco-
