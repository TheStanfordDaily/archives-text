# Fade Into Bolivian
## Neil Davis preaches the Montana Gospel 
### 
Author's admission: Foremost, I want
to acknowledge that this column will
only tangentially involve sports. How
ever, as proven by one Julie Ruvolo last year,
in order to be a sports columnist for the Stan
ford Daily, writing about sports is not exactly
necessary. In fact, I'm pretty certain she
proved that the art of sports writing involves
little more than writing about jersey chasing

and hating on runners.
I would like to think that
through my first two
columns, I have established
more sports credibility than
Julie gained in her entire
tenure. With that stated,
here's my story.
This past weekend I was
traveling to lovely Terre
Haute, Indiana, home of a
Pre-National Cross Country

race, the federal penitentiary where Timothy
McVeigh was executed, and Columbia House.
On the plane ride from Minneapolis to Indi
anapolis — which would later be described by
numerous people in my section as the worst
flight ever — I was afforded the opportunity
to sit next to a man who had spent $100 and the
previous two hours of his life in an airport
tequileria.
I knew this was going to be an epic flight as
soon as he introduced himself to me as Sun
down Nelson from Great Falls, Montana. He
proceeded to a) present his drivers license to
prove the validity of his name (a perfectly nor
mal response) and b) take off his shirt, reveal
ing the word "Sundown" tattooed across his
stomach (an odd, albeit endearing move, one
which he claimed had worked with many a
lady). Of course, the drinking did not actually
stop in the airport, as he sagely invested an
other $20 in alcohol over the course of the 90-
minute flight.
Ironically, this was also a man who, in order
to travel to a hardware trade show in Indi
anapolis, had needed to borrow money from
his mother to purchase the plane ticket. Bot
tom line: this was a drunk Montanan, bent on
explaining his entire life story to me, anyone in
our section, and roughly anyone within a close
proximity of 100 feet.
Thus, presented below is the Gospel about
Montana, according to a drunk and often inco-


Neil Davis
herently speaking Sundown Nelson:
Point one: Tupac resides in Mon
tana. As soon as he revealed his
Fupac-esque tattoo, a conversation
about Tupac ensued. Granted, he
had never heard of the late enter
tainer, hut this did not stop him
from explaining to me that Tupac
currently lived on a farm in Mon
tana, and was most definitely still
alive. According to Sundown,
Tupac was attracted by the isolation
ot Montana, which afforded him the
ability to drive two miles in any di
rection and smoke some wacky to
backy without fear of repercussion.
Point two: Gopher-hunting is
definitely a sport: At the age of 21,1
have never killed a gopher, nor have
1 hung a gopher tail on a wall. Sun
down was appalled, nay, outraged
by my lack of gopher-hunting skills.
Any attempts by me to explain that
other, potentially more mainstream
sports, existed in California were
met by a hearty guffaw.
Point three: Montana is an in
credibly boring place / Montana is
filled with outdoor activity: Maybe
it was the alcohol, or maybe Sun
down was acutely aware of the di

chotomy he presented, but he could
not decide between these two op
tions.
This leads to point four, empha
sized heavily: Californians, go
home!
Apparently a huge influx of Cal
ifornians has taken jobs away from
native Montanans and has in
creased the price of land. Sundown
would like to emphasize to any Cal
ifornians interested in potentially
moving to Montana that they
should stay home.
Actually, this isn't entirely true —
after learning that I went to Stanford
and was contemplating law school,
Sundown invited me back to Mon
tana in order to file lawsuits in Havre
(which allegedly is number one in
the United States in teen pregnancy,
teen drug use and teen suicide). Of
course. Sundown also mentioned
that he wasn't listed in the phone
book, but if 1 walked into any bar in
Montana and asked for him by
name, people would know him.
Point five: Joe Montana is the
only good quarterback the 49ers
have ever produced: This was my at
tempt to connect on the basis of

Airborne advice from
a drunken Montanan

sports. Sundown explained that
watching sports was only acceptable
under two conditions: a) you have a
broken leg and can no longer hunt
gophers and b) copious amounts of
alcohol are consumed.
He then went on to state that Joe
Montana was his favorite quarter
back ever, (he made sure to.empha
size that this was NOT because his
last name was Montana — this only
added to his appeal) and that Steve
Young was a perennial backup who
had never accomplished anything.
Any attempts by me to explain that
Steve Young had won a Super Bowl
were squarely rejected.
Other random factoids: There
are no buildings taller than 12 sto
ries, I Pods have only recently been
introduced in Montana, ice fishing
is definitely a sport, and a communi
ty must contain at least two bars in
order to be considered a town.
If you didn't know, now you
know. You know? Go forth, my
friends, and spread the good word.

book, but if 1 walked into any bar in
Montana and asked for him by
name, people would know him.

sports. Sundown explained that
watching sports was only acceptable
under two conditions: a) you have a
broken leg and can no longer hunt
gophers and b) copious amounts of
alcohol are consumed.
He then went on to state that Joe
Montana was his favorite quarter
back ever, (he made sure to.empha
size that this was NOT because his
last name was Montana — this only
added to his appeal) and that Steve
Young was a perennial backup who
had never accomplished anything.
Any attempts by me to explain that
Steve Young had won a Super Bowl
were squarely rejected.
Other random factoids: There
are no buildings taller than 12 sto
ries, I Pods have only recently been
introduced in Montana, ice fishing
is definitely a sport, and a communi
ty must contain at least two bars in
order to be considered a town.
If you didn't know, now you
know. You know? Go forth, my
friends, and spread the good word.

Author's admission: Foremost, I want
to acknowledge that this column will
only tangentially involve sports. How
ever, as proven by one Julie Ruvolo last year,
in order to be a sports columnist for the Stan
ford Daily, writing about sports is not exactly
necessary. In fact, I'm pretty certain she
proved that the art of sports writing involves
little more than writing about jersey chasing

and hating on runners.
I would like to think that
through my first two
columns, I have established
more sports credibility than
Julie gained in her entire
tenure. With that stated,
here's my story.
This past weekend I was
traveling to lovely Terre
Haute, Indiana, home of a
Pre-National Cross Country

race, the federal penitentiary where Timothy
McVeigh was executed, and Columbia House.
On the plane ride from Minneapolis to Indi
anapolis — which would later be described by
numerous people in my section as the worst
flight ever — I was afforded the opportunity
to sit next to a man who had spent $100 and the
previous two hours of his life in an airport
tequileria.
I knew this was going to be an epic flight as
soon as he introduced himself to me as Sun
down Nelson from Great Falls, Montana. He
proceeded to a) present his drivers license to
prove the validity of his name (a perfectly nor
mal response) and b) take off his shirt, reveal
ing the word "Sundown" tattooed across his
stomach (an odd, albeit endearing move, one
which he claimed had worked with many a
lady). Of course, the drinking did not actually
stop in the airport, as he sagely invested an
other $20 in alcohol over the course of the 90-
minute flight.
Ironically, this was also a man who, in order
to travel to a hardware trade show in Indi
anapolis, had needed to borrow money from
his mother to purchase the plane ticket. Bot
tom line: this was a drunk Montanan, bent on
explaining his entire life story to me, anyone in
our section, and roughly anyone within a close
proximity of 100 feet.
Thus, presented below is the Gospel about
Montana, according to a drunk and often inco-


Neil Davis
herently speaking Sundown Nelson:
Point one: Tupac resides in Mon
tana. As soon as he revealed his
Fupac-esque tattoo, a conversation
about Tupac ensued. Granted, he
had never heard of the late enter
tainer, hut this did not stop him
from explaining to me that Tupac
currently lived on a farm in Mon
tana, and was most definitely still
alive. According to Sundown,
Tupac was attracted by the isolation
ot Montana, which afforded him the
ability to drive two miles in any di
rection and smoke some wacky to
backy without fear of repercussion.
Point two: Gopher-hunting is
definitely a sport: At the age of 21,1
have never killed a gopher, nor have
1 hung a gopher tail on a wall. Sun
down was appalled, nay, outraged
by my lack of gopher-hunting skills.
Any attempts by me to explain that
other, potentially more mainstream
sports, existed in California were
met by a hearty guffaw.
Point three: Montana is an in
credibly boring place / Montana is
filled with outdoor activity: Maybe
it was the alcohol, or maybe Sun
down was acutely aware of the di

chotomy he presented, but he could
not decide between these two op
tions.
This leads to point four, empha
sized heavily: Californians, go
home!
Apparently a huge influx of Cal
ifornians has taken jobs away from
native Montanans and has in
creased the price of land. Sundown
would like to emphasize to any Cal
ifornians interested in potentially
moving to Montana that they
should stay home.
Actually, this isn't entirely true —
after learning that I went to Stanford
and was contemplating law school,
Sundown invited me back to Mon
tana in order to file lawsuits in Havre
(which allegedly is number one in
the United States in teen pregnancy,
teen drug use and teen suicide). Of
course. Sundown also mentioned
that he wasn't listed in the phone
book, but if 1 walked into any bar in
Montana and asked for him by
name, people would know him.
Point five: Joe Montana is the
