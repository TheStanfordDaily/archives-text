# Stanford sneaks by Cougars

### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
PULLMAN, Wash. — This one was big.
When the Cardinal faced off against
Washington State here Saturday, they
were looking fora lot more than just a key
Pacific-10 Conference win against a team
that entered the game with a record iden
tical to Stanford's.
And with a 23-17 victory over the
Cougars, the Cardinal got what they
wanted.
A win total that matches last year's —
with five games left to play. A win that
ties the Cardinal (4-2,2-1 Pac-10) for sec
ond in the Pac-10. A win that leaves them
just two shy of bowl eligibility.
"It's huge," said wide receiver Justin
McCullum, who led Stanford with seven
catches. "This is our third close game that
we've been in, and it's showing our matu
rity as a team to pull this one out. It feels
great to finally get a close win."
It didn't initially look like it was going
to be a close win, as Stanford opened a
halftime lead of 13-3 and led 20-3 after
three quarters. But the Cougars (3-3,1-2)
aren't used to losing, especially not at
home. They won 10 games in each of the
last three seasons, and Saturday's defeat
marked the first time since 2000 that they
had lost consecutive games.
In other words: the Cardinal had to
fight for this one to the very end. And,
thanks to a defense that intercepted Josh
Swogger three times — he entered the
game having been picked off just four
times previously this year — Stanford is
off to its best start since 2001.
"There were so many highs and so
many lows and so many guys on the de
fense making plays when we needed
them to," quarterback Trent Edwards
said. "The offense made some critical er
rors and the defense was really there to
pick us up."
The Cardinal forced three turnovers
in the second half, as Leigh Torrence and
Oshiomogho Atogwe intercepted Swog
ger in Stanford territory and Jon Alston
hit Allen Thompson so hard he fumbled
on the Cardinal one-yard line in the
fourth quarter.
It was the ultimate bail-out play. Ed
wards had just been intercepted by
Hazma Abdullah at the Stanford three
yard line, just seconds after the Cardinal
defense had stopped the Cougars cold on
fourth-and-goal from the three-yard line.
But Alston leveled Thompson and Bran
don Harrison was right there to recover

the football.
"I avoided the tackle, he went down
and I just went around him," Alston said.
"I saw [Thompson], my eyes lit up and I
made the hit."
Although it came with the Cardinal
leading 20-3, Alston's big hit would prove
to be a monumental stop, as the Cougars
found the end zone on their next two pos
sessions to cut Stanford's lead to 20-17.
Jason Harrison cut back for an impres
sive 10-yard touchdown run with 14:23 re
maining in the game and Swogger lined a
30-yard scoring pass to Jason Hill just
over two minutes later.
Stanford had just allowed two touch
downs in two minutes, the homecoming
crowd at sold-out Martin Stadium was
out of control and the offense had four
punts and an interception to show for its
last five drives.

Enter Kenneth Tolon.
The senior tailback, who received just
four carries last week, took Stanford on
his shoulders, rushing six times for 35
yards as the Cardinal worked its way to
the Cougar 30-yard line.
"Kenny showed some great patience
out there," Teevens said. "He answered
the call."
But after Paul Stevens wrapped up
Edwards at the line of scrimmage on third
down, Stanford faced either a tough
fourth-and-nine conversion attempt or
the longest field-goal attempt of Michael
Sgroi's career.

kicking in cold, damp weather, nudged a

need to find the end zone if they wanted to win this one.
They didn't really come close.
Atogwe's interception ended Washington State's
first comeback attempt at midfield, while the Cougars
stalled their last drive with a false start and a clipping
penalty and ended up throwing incomplete on fourth
and-19 with 55 seconds left.
"We're really just trying to get the game in our
hands," Atogwe said of the defense's four takeaways,
including two by Torrence. "We knew that Swogger
wasn't great throwing the ball when he had to move his
feet, and we had a lot of blitzes early."
As it had against USC and Notre Dame, the Cardi
nal got on the board against a strong Washington State
defense with a few big plays.
With 3:16 remaining in the first quarter and the score
knotted at three, Edwards lateraled to McCullum, who
lofted a 42-yard pass downfield to an open Mark Brad
ford, setting up J R. Lemon's 2-yard touchdown run.
Still, as it did last week at Notre Dame, Stanford
failed to complete two long drives. Two field goals by
Sgroi — who has made his last nine kicks — were all
the Cardinal had to show for 58- and 76-yard drives.
With the way Stanford opened the second half, it
was clear the Cardinal hadn't forgotten last week's
lessons.
On the first play of the half, Edwards dropped back
and zipped a liner into the arms of a streaking Evan
Moore well downfield. The Cougars, perhaps taken
aback, were a step behind, and 67 yards later. Moore

had a touchdown and the Stanford defense had a lead it
knew it could protect.
Edwards finished 15-of-31 for 202 yards and rushed
nine times for 26 yards — including one scary first-half
rush in which Cougar linebacker Will Derting laid into
Edwards' right shoulder and forced him out of the
game fora play.
Tolon carried 20 times — the most any hack has car
ried all season for Stanford — for 99 yards, while
Lemon rushed 10 times for 20 yards.
For the Cougars, Swogger was 18-of-36 for 257
yards, while Jerome Harrison rushed 16 times for 84
yards and Allan Thompson ran for 76 yards on just nine
carries. Hill led all receivers with five catches for 115
yards while Michael Bumpus had five receptions for 55
yards and broke a 48-yard punt return in the first quar
ter to set up a 27-yard Loren Langley field goal.
But it wasn't enough, and two weeks after beating
Washington for the first time since 1994, Stanford col
lected its first win against the Cougars since 2000 — and
Teevens' first Pac-10 road win.
The Cardinal sits at 4-2. its best start since 2001 's Seat
tle Bowl squad opened 5-1.
For that reason and many others, Saturday's win was
a statement game for the Cardinal.
"It means a lot because today 1 feel like we grew as a
team." Alston said. "We practiced all week long to fin
ish in the fourth quarter ... and we did that this week."
Added Edwards: "This is just going to be a catalyst
for the rest of this season."
