# Balanced attack picks apart WSU defense

### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
PULLMAN, Wash. â€” Washington State
gave up 437 passing yards against Oregon, but
the Cardinal didn't challenge it downfield in
the first half.
Smart move.
After all. a secondary coming off an em
barrassing effort is going to go a long way to
avoid giving up the deep ball right off the bat.
So, throughout the first half, quarterback
Trent Edwards swung passes into the flat and
Stanford's running backs bounced to the out
side. And then, when it was time fora big
play, Edwards would find Justin McCullum in
the middle of the field, more open than he
had any right to be.
Offensive coordinator Bill Cubit and head
coach Buddy Teevens were relying on Ed
wards to set up the Cougar defense, and it was
working. Was that the plan all along?
"It was," Edwards said. "Washington

passes, all for first downs, including a 20-yard
catch over the middle on third-and-15.
On Stanford's next possession, a lateral
throw to McCullum to the right flat spread
the Cougar defense enough to enable McCul
lum to toss a 42-yard pass of his own to Mark
Bradford. Inside-outside play once again set
up a Cardinal score, this time a two-yard run
by J.R. Lemon.
In other words, the Cougar defenders
were torn between where they were supposed
to be (deep and in the middle) and where they
thought the ball was going to be thrown
(short and outside).
"We were just trying to take what they
gave us," McCullum said. "When they were
trying to take away the outside, we were try
ing to control over the middle more."
Meanwhile, Edwards was using his speed
and Washington State's zone defense to rush
seven times fora team-high 35 yards in the
first half.
"I think credit goes to Edwards, their
quarterback," Cougars head coach Bill Doba
said. "He scrambled and got outside the con-
