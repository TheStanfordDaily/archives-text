# Balanced attack picks apart WSU defense
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
PULLMAN, Wash. — Washington State
gave up 437 passing yards against Oregon, but
the Cardinal didn't challenge it downfield in
the first half.
Smart move.
After all. a secondary coming off an em
barrassing effort is going to go a long way to
avoid giving up the deep ball right off the bat.
So, throughout the first half, quarterback
Trent Edwards swung passes into the flat and
Stanford's running backs bounced to the out
side. And then, when it was time fora big
play, Edwards would find Justin McCullum in
the middle of the field, more open than he
had any right to be.
Offensive coordinator Bill Cubit and head
coach Buddy Teevens were relying on Ed
wards to set up the Cougar defense, and it was
working. Was that the plan all along?
"It was," Edwards said. "Washington
State plays a cover-four defense, where the
most susceptible area is the flat, so we were
throwing a lot of swing passes to our slot re
ceivers."
McCullum finished the first half with six re
ceptions for 57 yards. On Stanford's first scor
ing drive, the sophomore wideout caught three
passes, all for first downs, including a 20-yard
catch over the middle on third-and-15.
On Stanford's next possession, a lateral
throw to McCullum to the right flat spread
the Cougar defense enough to enable McCul
lum to toss a 42-yard pass of his own to Mark
Bradford. Inside-outside play once again set
up a Cardinal score, this time a two-yard run
by J.R. Lemon.
In other words, the Cougar defenders
were torn between where they were supposed
to be (deep and in the middle) and where they
thought the ball was going to be thrown
(short and outside).
"We were just trying to take what they
gave us," McCullum said. "When they were
trying to take away the outside, we were try
ing to control over the middle more."
Meanwhile, Edwards was using his speed
and Washington State's zone defense to rush
seven times fora team-high 35 yards in the
first half.
"I think credit goes to Edwards, their
quarterback," Cougars head coach Bill Doba
said. "He scrambled and got outside the con-
tain, and when we were out there to
contain, he ran up the middle."
In addition to his footwork, in
the first half the sophomore com
pleted 11 -of-20 passes for 120 yards
and helped Stanford win the time
of-possession battle by more than
three minutes.
Despite the initial effectiveness
of Stanford's game plan, though,
Washington State had noticed that
it was getting worked over and
made some adjustments.
"They switched to cover-two
man during the second half, and
we've been struggling with that de
fense a little bit this season so far,"
Edwards said.
What the Cardinal did next was
just as encouraging as its first-half
effort.
Edwards started out by exploiting
the Cougar defense — which by the
second half was more than tired of giv
ing up cheap gains in the flat — down

field, lining a 67-yard touchdown pass
into the hands of Evan Moore on the
first play of the second half.
After that, with the Cougars'
cover-two defense taking away the
easy tosses that worked so well in
the first half. Stanford switched up
its plan of attack.
"The looks weren't there in the
second half," Edwards said. "We
had to go to the running game a lit
tle bit more."
And it worked. After struggling
to run the ball in the second half in
losses to Southern California and
Notre Dame, Stanford found itself
able to not only eat up yardage and
time off the clock with the run, but
even to put points on the board.
In the second half, Kenneth
Tolon rushed 14 times for 73 yards,
averaging an impressive 5.2 yards
per carry against an oversized
Cougar defensive line.
Saturday, despite having fresh-

man reserve Mikal Brewer in at
center (starter Brian Head left in
the first half with an injury), the
Cardinal offensive line opened
some sizeable holes for Tolon.
On the Cardinal's last scoring
drive, Tolon carried the hall on six
consecutive plays — and gained 35
yards doing so. On the next drive,
Tolon carried the ball on another six
consecutive plays, gaining 20 yards.
Granted, the Cougars still had two
possessions after the Cardinal's last
score, hut Tolon's running saved the
Cardinal defense from having to de
fend those two Cougar drives with just
a three-point lead and a short field.
"We're in a point where we
struggle a little but at the tail end of
ball games, and it's not going the
way we want," Teevens said, refer
encing the Cardinal's second-half
struggles in its losses. "[But] also,
we stood up and said, 'enough is
enough, let's finish,' and we did."
