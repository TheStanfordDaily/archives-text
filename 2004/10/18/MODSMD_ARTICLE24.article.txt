# Men tie Davis in thriller but fall to Bruins at home
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW 
The matches this weekend at Maloney
Field did not go according to plan for the
Stanford men's soccer team (6-2-5, 1-1-2
Pacific-10 Conference), and the team is
frustrated.
The Cardinal came into the weekend
with big expectations for the contest
against UC-Davis (4-6-2) and excitement
for the Pac-10 showdown with nemesis
UCLA (7-2-2, 3-1 Pac-10). However,
Stanford never took control in either
game. They were forced to play from he
hind for much of the weekend, eking out a
1-1 come-from-behind tie against the Ag
gies and falling 2-0 to UCLA.
The Friday night game was a struggle
for both the Aggies and the Cardinal. The
play was extremely physical and chippy,
as both teams registered 25 fouls. There
were a total of five yellow cards given by
the referee, including three cautions in the
first half on harsh tackles.

The teams were deadlocked 0-0 after a
first half marked by even possession be
tween the teams, multiple scoring
chances and exceptional individual de
fensive efforts.
UC-Davis drew first blood when it
took the lead 1-0 in the 76th minute.
Aggie Connor Voss dribbled up the right
sideline and delivered a beautiful cross to
his teammate Ryan Shaw, who headed the
ball towards the upper right corner past
the diving reach of goalkeeper Robby
Fulton.
Stanford has developed an unfortu
nate knack for giving up the first goal.
"We've gotten into the habit of playing
from behind." said senior defender Jason
Griffiths. "It almost seems like we only
wake up as a team after we're down a
goal."
The blow shocked Stanford's system.
Success finally came in the 85th minute
