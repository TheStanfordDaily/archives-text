# Men tie Davis in thriller but fall to Bruins at home
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW 
The matches this weekend at Maloney
Field did not go according to plan for the
Stanford men's soccer team (6-2-5, 1-1-2
Pacific-10 Conference), and the team is
frustrated.
The Cardinal came into the weekend
with big expectations for the contest
against UC-Davis (4-6-2) and excitement
for the Pac-10 showdown with nemesis
UCLA (7-2-2, 3-1 Pac-10). However,
Stanford never took control in either
game. They were forced to play from he
hind for much of the weekend, eking out a
1-1 come-from-behind tie against the Ag
gies and falling 2-0 to UCLA.
The Friday night game was a struggle
for both the Aggies and the Cardinal. The
play was extremely physical and chippy,
as both teams registered 25 fouls. There
were a total of five yellow cards given by
the referee, including three cautions in the
first half on harsh tackles.

The teams were deadlocked 0-0 after a
first half marked by even possession be
tween the teams, multiple scoring
chances and exceptional individual de
fensive efforts.
UC-Davis drew first blood when it
took the lead 1-0 in the 76th minute.
Aggie Connor Voss dribbled up the right
sideline and delivered a beautiful cross to
his teammate Ryan Shaw, who headed the
ball towards the upper right corner past
the diving reach of goalkeeper Robby
Fulton.
Stanford has developed an unfortu
nate knack for giving up the first goal.
"We've gotten into the habit of playing
from behind." said senior defender Jason
Griffiths. "It almost seems like we only
wake up as a team after we're down a
goal."
The blow shocked Stanford's system.
Success finally came in the 85th minute

1-2 in Pac-10 play and 7-2-2 overall.
when senior forward Matt Janusz drew a foul just out
side the eighteen-yard box. Senior Jason Griffiths set up
for the kick and scored on a ball that seemed to have
eyes of its own.
"IT he goal was| terrible," Griffiths said. "1 mis-hit
the shot, the wall opened up and somehow it found the
back of the net. It wasn't pretty, but I'll take it."
The rest of the game was played evenly, and the
game ended deadlocked at 1-1, a familiar outcome for
the team.
"We've gotten into such a habit of tying that it often
feels like losing." Griffiths said.
Having to play a high-energy overtime game also
took its toll.
"I think that [the length of the UC-Davis game]
made us more fatigued for the UCLA game than we
would have liked," said Stanford head coach Bret
Simon.
The Cardinal knew that they would have their hands
full against the Bruins. Stanford had high expectations
for the game and came in with the knowledge that a win
would keep them in control of their own destiny in the
quest fora Pac-10 championship. However, Sunday
would not be their day.
The Cardinal and Bruins played a tight and fairly even
first half. The score after the first frame was 0-0, as neither
offense could crack the solid play of the goalkeepers.
Despite the positive effort from the Cardinal in the
first half, they did not come out with the same intensity
m the first five minutes of the second half, and the Bru
ins capitalized in the 49th minute. UCLA's Richard Flo
res sprinted up the right side of the field and crossed the

Card struggle against
UCLA in second half

ball to Kamani Hill. Hill touched the hall to Benny Feil
haher, who scored top shelf to put UCLA up 1 -0.
"We gave the game away." Simon said. "We didn't
come into the second half the same way we opened the
game. The difference in the game was the lack of focus
and intensity at the very beginning of the second half."
Stanford also gave away the Bruins' insurance goal,
as a botched pass in the Cardinal defense ended up at the
feet of UCLA forward Mike Enfield, who easily put the
ball in the lower right corner from point-blank range.
The Cardinal could never regain composure and
took their first Pac-10 loss.
"Since every team in the conference is so strong,
often the difference in winning and losing is wanting the
game more than your opponent," Griffiths said.
"UCLA is definitely not any better [than us|, they just
played with more desire and we made them better by
losing every 50-50 ball."
Simon also chipped in his frustrated sentiments.
"When you are at home and you have a chance to
succeed against a good team, it's an opportunity you do
not want to squander," he said. "The most frustrating
thing about this loss is we've taken the conference
championship, which is a goal of ours, out of our hands.
It's still possible to win given the parity in the Pac-10,
but Washington is now in the driver's seat."
Despite the loss, the team knows it can do better
"We're a good enough team to start winning more,"
said Griffiths.
Stanford will not have to wait long fora shot at re

The matches this weekend at Maloney
Field did not go according to plan for the
Stanford men's soccer team (6-2-5, 1-1-2
Pacific-10 Conference), and the team is
frustrated.
The Cardinal came into the weekend
with big expectations for the contest
against UC-Davis (4-6-2) and excitement
for the Pac-10 showdown with nemesis
UCLA (7-2-2, 3-1 Pac-10). However,
Stanford never took control in either
game. They were forced to play from he
hind for much of the weekend, eking out a
1-1 come-from-behind tie against the Ag
gies and falling 2-0 to UCLA.
The Friday night game was a struggle
for both the Aggies and the Cardinal. The
play was extremely physical and chippy,
as both teams registered 25 fouls. There
were a total of five yellow cards given by
the referee, including three cautions in the
first half on harsh tackles.

The teams were deadlocked 0-0 after a
first half marked by even possession be
tween the teams, multiple scoring
chances and exceptional individual de
fensive efforts.
UC-Davis drew first blood when it
took the lead 1-0 in the 76th minute.
Aggie Connor Voss dribbled up the right
sideline and delivered a beautiful cross to
his teammate Ryan Shaw, who headed the
ball towards the upper right corner past
the diving reach of goalkeeper Robby
Fulton.
Stanford has developed an unfortu
nate knack for giving up the first goal.
"We've gotten into the habit of playing
from behind." said senior defender Jason
Griffiths. "It almost seems like we only
wake up as a team after we're down a
goal."
The blow shocked Stanford's system.
Success finally came in the 85th minute

when senior forward Matt Janusz drew a foul just out
side the eighteen-yard box. Senior Jason Griffiths set up
for the kick and scored on a ball that seemed to have
eyes of its own.
"IT he goal was| terrible," Griffiths said. "1 mis-hit
the shot, the wall opened up and somehow it found the
back of the net. It wasn't pretty, but I'll take it."
The rest of the game was played evenly, and the
game ended deadlocked at 1-1, a familiar outcome for
the team.
"We've gotten into such a habit of tying that it often
feels like losing." Griffiths said.
Having to play a high-energy overtime game also
took its toll.
"I think that [the length of the UC-Davis game]
made us more fatigued for the UCLA game than we
would have liked," said Stanford head coach Bret
Simon.
The Cardinal knew that they would have their hands
full against the Bruins. Stanford had high expectations
for the game and came in with the knowledge that a win
would keep them in control of their own destiny in the
quest fora Pac-10 championship. However, Sunday
would not be their day.
The Cardinal and Bruins played a tight and fairly even
first half. The score after the first frame was 0-0, as neither
offense could crack the solid play of the goalkeepers.
Despite the positive effort from the Cardinal in the
first half, they did not come out with the same intensity
m the first five minutes of the second half, and the Bru
ins capitalized in the 49th minute. UCLA's Richard Flo
res sprinted up the right side of the field and crossed the

ball to Kamani Hill. Hill touched the hall to Benny Feil
haher, who scored top shelf to put UCLA up 1 -0.
"We gave the game away." Simon said. "We didn't
come into the second half the same way we opened the
game. The difference in the game was the lack of focus
and intensity at the very beginning of the second half."
Stanford also gave away the Bruins' insurance goal,
as a botched pass in the Cardinal defense ended up at the
feet of UCLA forward Mike Enfield, who easily put the
ball in the lower right corner from point-blank range.
The Cardinal could never regain composure and
took their first Pac-10 loss.
"Since every team in the conference is so strong,
often the difference in winning and losing is wanting the
game more than your opponent," Griffiths said.
"UCLA is definitely not any better [than us|, they just
played with more desire and we made them better by
losing every 50-50 ball."
Simon also chipped in his frustrated sentiments.
"When you are at home and you have a chance to
succeed against a good team, it's an opportunity you do
not want to squander," he said. "The most frustrating
thing about this loss is we've taken the conference
championship, which is a goal of ours, out of our hands.
It's still possible to win given the parity in the Pac-10,
but Washington is now in the driver's seat."
Despite the loss, the team knows it can do better
