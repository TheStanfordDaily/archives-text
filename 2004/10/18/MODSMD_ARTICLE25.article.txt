# Varellas leads men's water polo to win over Anteaters
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Just a few minutes after the No. 2 men's
water polo team (12-2,2-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) wrapped up its game Sat
urday afternoon, the Cardinal squad was
called to come back out. It wasn't fora post
game meeting, or a because they needed to
prepare for the next day's match. It was fora
team photo atop the stands, and after their
10-5 win over No. 8 UC-Irvine (8-8, 0-2
MPSF), the Cardinal were all smiles.
Things went well for Stanford, who, not
counting last week's Alumni game, went
two weeks without a real competitor in the
pool. After upping the intensity during
practice, the Cardinal were anxious to win
their second conference match of the sea
son. Stanford got back into its successful
routine, but not before having to adjust and
slip into its role as an offensive powerhouse
during the first period.
Stanford, who has come out strong

against opponents in the first periods, didn't
perform like its usual self. The home squad,
playing at Avery Aquatic Center, didn't
score its first goal until junior driver Peter
Varellas scored his first of four goals with
2:10 left on the clock.
While the Cardinal had good opportuni
ties early on, many of their shots missed or
hit the bar, Varellas said.
Meanwhile, junior goalkeeper Joe Wynn
blocked well for the Anteaters. Fortunately
for Stanford though, the balls started cruis
ing into the goals during the second period.
"You could tell in the first quarter we
were a little rusty," said senior driver and
three-time All-American Tony Azevedo.
"Things weren't going the way we wanted to.
We rushed a few shots here and there, but
once we got comfortable in playing the
game, there was really no competition."
Sure enough, once the Cardinal scored in
the second period, things got going quickly
