# Varellas leads men's water polo to win over Anteaters
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Just a few minutes after the No. 2 men's
water polo team (12-2,2-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) wrapped up its game Sat
urday afternoon, the Cardinal squad was
called to come back out. It wasn't fora post
game meeting, or a because they needed to
prepare for the next day's match. It was fora
team photo atop the stands, and after their
10-5 win over No. 8 UC-Irvine (8-8, 0-2
MPSF), the Cardinal were all smiles.
Things went well for Stanford, who, not
counting last week's Alumni game, went
two weeks without a real competitor in the
pool. After upping the intensity during
practice, the Cardinal were anxious to win
their second conference match of the sea
son. Stanford got back into its successful
routine, but not before having to adjust and
slip into its role as an offensive powerhouse
during the first period.
Stanford, who has come out strong

against opponents in the first periods, didn't
perform like its usual self. The home squad,
playing at Avery Aquatic Center, didn't
score its first goal until junior driver Peter
Varellas scored his first of four goals with
2:10 left on the clock.
While the Cardinal had good opportuni
ties early on, many of their shots missed or
hit the bar, Varellas said.
Meanwhile, junior goalkeeper Joe Wynn
blocked well for the Anteaters. Fortunately
for Stanford though, the balls started cruis
ing into the goals during the second period.
"You could tell in the first quarter we
were a little rusty," said senior driver and
three-time All-American Tony Azevedo.
"Things weren't going the way we wanted to.
We rushed a few shots here and there, but
once we got comfortable in playing the
game, there was really no competition."
Sure enough, once the Cardinal scored in
the second period, things got going quickly
tor the Stanford offense. J.J. Gar
ton. Stanford's sophomore two
meter / defender, provided the Car
dinal with their second goal of the
game. It became a three-on-three
play for the Cardinal, as Garton
took advantage of the lack of Irvine
defenders. Soon caps were flying,
falling or being tugged off, the game
was on. and it was all Cardinal.
A/evcdo gave his team a bigger
lead with two goals within a minute
in the second quarter. One came off
a man-up advantage for the Cardi
nal; the other was lobbed in over the
head of Wynn. Junior driver
Thomas Hopkins put the exclama
tion point on the period with his
goal with 1:13 left to put Stanford up
5-0.
Hie Stanford defense also made
sure that there would be no compe
tition by shutting out Irvine the en
tire first half. Goalkeeper Chad
Taylor, a junior, recorded five saves
during the game, but keeping the
Anteaters scoreless for those first
two periods was the key to winning
the game.
"Not only did we have a lot of of
fense, but to stop them again with no
goals to come out and stop them
again in the second quarter — is just
huge," said Varellas.
"All of a sudden it's halftime,

and a team's down not only by a
hunch of goals but they haven't
even scored yet. That just kills them
for the second half."
"Plus we're the kind of team that
wears | the opponent] down. We just
keep going and coming after to you
at every possession and that wears
down teams. Especially [teams] like
Irvine that don't have a whole lot of
subs."
Irvine could do little to stop the
barrage in the third period as well.
Hopkins scored his second goal of
the game — his team-leading 36th
— and Varellas added two more to
build a dominant 8-0 lead, which
would soon come in handy.
The Anteaters' Rick Merlo, along
with Dan Noon and Dreason Barry,
tried to mount a comeback. Merlo
managed to score with 2:03 left in the
third, and two more Irvine shots
went into the cage to make the score
10-3.
Unfortunately, there was little
the Irvine senior driver could do by
himself. Despite his four goals in the
second half, Merlo's skill wasn't
enough to lead Irvine to victory, as
the only other Anteater to score was
freshman driver Andrew Dunn.
Stanford tacked on two more
goals for insurance in the fourth.
Varellas scored on a pass from

Cardinal defense
shuts down UC-Irvine

Azevedo, and senior two-meter
Greg Crum scored on a 6-on-5 for
Stanford to add to the Cardinal's
lead. Irvine's Merlo, who now has
38 goals on the season, pulled away
at the end of the fourth for his last
goal, making the final score 10-5.
While Merlo was able to get past
the Stanford defense in the second
half, the Cardinal didn't seem too
worried about a potential threat and
were satisfied with the job they did
covering Merlo, Noon and Dreason.
"Barry took three shots. Noon
took four or five shots — neither of
them scored," said two-time
Olympian Azevedo. "Merlo had
most of his goals when we subbed
out at the end there, but he's a na
tional team caliber player. For the
most part we really took them
down. But then again we can't go to
everyone so sometimes we ended
up leaving [Merlo] open, and he put
it away."
"But 1 thought we did an excel
lent job on defense, especially in
that first half," Azevedo said.
The conference win puts the Car
dinal squad in better position to win
the NCAA at-large bid, which it will
most likely be competing for with
top-ranked UCLA (13-2,1-0), No. 4
California (10-5, 0-2), and No. 3
Southern California (12-2,0-1).
