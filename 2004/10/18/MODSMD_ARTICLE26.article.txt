# Women sweep Oregon schools
## Volleyball to face top-ranked Huskies next weekend 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If the Stanford women's volleyball team can con
tinue to destroy teams the way it did this weekend
against Oregon State and Oregon, it will be tough for
anyone to keep up with the Cardinal.
Stanford (14-4, 6-1 Pacific-10 Conference) abso
lutely rolled through the Oregon schools this week
end, only dropping one game. With that, the Cardinal
stand alone in second place in the conference, one
game behind currently undefeated and nationally
ranked No. 1 Washington, whom Stanford will face
next weekend in Seattle.
Stanford opened Friday night with a match against
Oregon State. The sleepwalking Cardinal played slop
py volleyball en route to giving away game one to the
Beavers, 30-24, on a kill by Allison Lawrence.
Whatever was wrong with Stanford in game one dis
appeared in game two and never showed up again dur
ing the rest of the weekend. Taking an early lead, the
Cardinal pummeled the Beavers' defense, notching 17
kills and hitting nearly .400 as a team. Stanford also
played much better defense and passed more solidly,
anchored by junior libero Courtney Schultz. The game
ended when senior Ogonna Nnamani put down her
16th kill of the match, giving Stanford a 30-19 win.
"Serving and passing wins a game," Schultz said.
"If you serve tough, they can't pass and run their sys
tem. When passing falters, you only have one option
with the outside hitter. Our defense is frustrating the
other team because we're getting better and staying in
control more."
The Cardinal then showed some mental toughness
in game three as Oregon State was able to keep things
close for the first half of the game. Holding a slim one
point lead heading into a media timeout, Stanford put
together an eight-point run to open things up. The
teams traded points from there, and a block by sopho
more Lizzie Suiter and senior Jennifer Hucke gave
Stanford the game, 30-20.
Clearly on a roll by game four, the Card had no
problem finishing things up. taking out the Beavers by
a score of 30-21. As in game two, the team took con
trol early and never looked back, never allowing Ore
gon State to get on a run of more than four points.
Stanford closed the game and match on an attack
error by the Beavers (8-7, 2-4 Pac-10).
Oregon came into Burnham Pavilion Saturday
evening and proved to be even less of a challenge than
Oregon State.
The Ducks (9-8.1-6 Pac-10) ran out to an early lead
in game one, but couldn't hold back the Cardinal at
tack as Stanford rallied to win 30-25 on an Oregon hit
ting error.
The 25-point effort the Ducks put up in game one
was the best showing they'd conjure up all night, as
Stanford took game two convincingly, 30-17. As if the
remarkable .440 team hitting percentage in the first
game wasn't enough, the Cardinal made an incredible
statement with a .687 team hitting percentage in the
second game, only committing one hitting error. A kill
from Hucke sealed the deal in game two.

Game three wasn't as crisp as the first two games,
but it was tun. Head coach John Dunning was able to
experiment with his lineup and get everyone playing
time. Oregon actually led the game until about the
halfway point, when the Cardinal put together a five
point run to take command. Stanford ended the game
and match on a Kristin Richards kill, her seventeenth
of the evening, which led all players.
"The game was still very close, but we were having
a lot more fun, playing better and passing well,"
Schultzsaid. "It was the first time we've ever come out
strong in the match and we were happy with the way
we played."
Stanford will next see action against Washington
State on Friday night in Pullman.
The Cardinal then travel to Seattle on Saturday
night, where the top-ranked Washington Huskies
await. Stanford will be looking to hand UW its first
loss of the season and avenge the loss the Huskies
gave the Cardinal last year to bounce them out of the
NCAA tournament.
"Washington just lost their best player [senior out
side hitter Sanja Tomasevic] to a hand injury," Schultz
said. "They might have a weakness we can exploit.
We're going to want revenge."
Sophomore middle blocker Jennifer Wilson, re
ceiving her first start of the year against the Ducks and
originally from the Seattle area, feels confident head
ing home to take on the Washington schools.
"We're in a great position," Wilson said. "We're look
ing forward to coming back number one in the Pac-10."

time. Oregon actually led the game until about the
halfway point, when the Cardinal put together a five
point run to take command. Stanford ended the game
and match on a Kristin Richards kill, her seventeenth
of the evening, which led all players.
"The game was still very close, but we were having
a lot more fun, playing better and passing well,"
Schultzsaid. "It was the first time we've ever come out
strong in the match and we were happy with the way
we played."
Stanford will next see action against Washington
State on Friday night in Pullman.
The Cardinal then travel to Seattle on Saturday
night, where the top-ranked Washington Huskies
await. Stanford will be looking to hand UW its first
loss of the season and avenge the loss the Huskies
gave the Cardinal last year to bounce them out of the
NCAA tournament.
"Washington just lost their best player [senior out
side hitter Sanja Tomasevic] to a hand injury," Schultz
said. "They might have a weakness we can exploit.
We're going to want revenge."
Sophomore middle blocker Jennifer Wilson, re
ceiving her first start of the year against the Ducks and
originally from the Seattle area, feels confident head
ing home to take on the Washington schools.
"We're in a great position," Wilson said. "We're look
ing forward to coming back number one in the Pac-10."

Senior outside hitter Ogorina Nnamani had 16 kills in
tfie Cardinal's 3-1 victory over Oregon State on Friday.
If the Stanford women's volleyball team can con
tinue to destroy teams the way it did this weekend
against Oregon State and Oregon, it will be tough for
anyone to keep up with the Cardinal.
Stanford (14-4, 6-1 Pacific-10 Conference) abso
lutely rolled through the Oregon schools this week
end, only dropping one game. With that, the Cardinal
stand alone in second place in the conference, one
game behind currently undefeated and nationally
ranked No. 1 Washington, whom Stanford will face
next weekend in Seattle.
Stanford opened Friday night with a match against
Oregon State. The sleepwalking Cardinal played slop
py volleyball en route to giving away game one to the
Beavers, 30-24, on a kill by Allison Lawrence.
Whatever was wrong with Stanford in game one dis
appeared in game two and never showed up again dur
ing the rest of the weekend. Taking an early lead, the
Cardinal pummeled the Beavers' defense, notching 17
kills and hitting nearly .400 as a team. Stanford also
played much better defense and passed more solidly,
anchored by junior libero Courtney Schultz. The game
ended when senior Ogonna Nnamani put down her
16th kill of the match, giving Stanford a 30-19 win.
"Serving and passing wins a game," Schultz said.
"If you serve tough, they can't pass and run their sys
tem. When passing falters, you only have one option
with the outside hitter. Our defense is frustrating the
other team because we're getting better and staying in
control more."
The Cardinal then showed some mental toughness
in game three as Oregon State was able to keep things
close for the first half of the game. Holding a slim one
point lead heading into a media timeout, Stanford put
together an eight-point run to open things up. The
teams traded points from there, and a block by sopho
more Lizzie Suiter and senior Jennifer Hucke gave
Stanford the game, 30-20.
Clearly on a roll by game four, the Card had no
problem finishing things up. taking out the Beavers by
a score of 30-21. As in game two, the team took con
trol early and never looked back, never allowing Ore
gon State to get on a run of more than four points.
Stanford closed the game and match on an attack
error by the Beavers (8-7, 2-4 Pac-10).
Oregon came into Burnham Pavilion Saturday
evening and proved to be even less of a challenge than
Oregon State.
The Ducks (9-8.1-6 Pac-10) ran out to an early lead
in game one, but couldn't hold back the Cardinal at
tack as Stanford rallied to win 30-25 on an Oregon hit
ting error.
The 25-point effort the Ducks put up in game one
was the best showing they'd conjure up all night, as
Stanford took game two convincingly, 30-17. As if the
remarkable .440 team hitting percentage in the first
game wasn't enough, the Cardinal made an incredible
statement with a .687 team hitting percentage in the
second game, only committing one hitting error. A kill
from Hucke sealed the deal in game two.

Game three wasn't as crisp as the first two games,
but it was tun. Head coach John Dunning was able to
experiment with his lineup and get everyone playing
time. Oregon actually led the game until about the
halfway point, when the Cardinal put together a five
point run to take command. Stanford ended the game
and match on a Kristin Richards kill, her seventeenth
of the evening, which led all players.
"The game was still very close, but we were having
a lot more fun, playing better and passing well,"
Schultzsaid. "It was the first time we've ever come out
strong in the match and we were happy with the way
