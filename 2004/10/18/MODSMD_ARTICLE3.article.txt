# ASSU withholds special-fees funds from 13 groups
## Student organizations unhappy with lack of notice and input 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
and Graduate Student Council re
cently passed a hill that requires all
student groups to set aside 20 percent
of their operating budgets as a pre
caution against high special-fee re
fund request rates.
Though many groups have enough
money in their reserves to meet this
new requirement. 13 cannot. For
those organizations, the ASSU will
withhold funding — up to 20 percent
— until winter quarter. While sena
tors argued that this policy would pro
tect the organizations, some students
complained that the ASSU had not
publicized the bill and had not sought
input from the student groups.
"We're not trying to cut groups'
budgets, we just want to make sure
they can cover refunds," said Senate
Chair Chris Lin. a senior.
According to Lin, most groups
have 20 or more percent of their oper
ating budgets saved in their reserves.
These groups will receive the entirety
of their funds. For the groups that
cannot do the same, the withheld
funding may be distributed in winter
quarter after fall and winter refund
rates have been examined.
The bill was not publicized among
groups — financial managers were
not directly contacted by the ASSU
until an e-mail sent last Friday about
the policy change — leaving some
members feeling that they had been
cut out of the loop.
"The bill actually kind of makes
sense, but it's outrageous that they
didn't bother informing us at all be
fore or after the vote." said senior
Alex Marshall, financial manager for
the Stanford Solar Car Project,
which will have $600, or approxi
mately 2 percent, of its operating
budget withheld.
"There are no clear guidelines for
how we receive that money based on
autumn quarter's refund rate," he
added.
Senior Taiwo Ajayi. president of
the Stanford African Students Asso
ciation. said that she understands the
reasons for the policy change but that

the ASSU should have done a better
job in informing her group and others.
"I realize that the ASSU is facing
a difficult challenge of revising the
special-fees policy to accommodate
the increasing refund requests,"
Ajayi said. "However. I feel it is im
portant [for the ASSU| to communi
cate as effectively as possible with the
affected groups to ensure that the so
lution it creates is beneficial to all par
ties involved."
Lin acknowledged that the affect
ed groups should have been informed.
"I think we did not communicate
this early enough," he said. "We did
not intend to sneak it through in any
way. In our view, it's not that big a
change in policy, it's just a decision so
that prior reforms can be implement
ed."
Lin acknowledged that certain
groups might have planned to use
more of their budget this quarter than
they have been allocated, but he em
phasized that the Senate "will work
with student groups with special
needs."
He added that the Senate will be
conducting outreach and education
efforts to reduce refund requests,
which should further minimize the
impact on group budgets.
"The senators are also going
around to dorms talking about re
funds. so we're trying to do our part to
curb it,"he said. "But this measure
was taken in the interest of the stabil
ity of the system, to make sure groups
can cover refunds."
Lin also pointed out that according
to ASSU by-laws, student groups are
only guaranteed 33 percent of their
ASSU funding each quarter. But
most have traditionally received all or
the majority of their funding at the be
ginning of the school year. So despite
the change, he said that student
groups arc still receiving more than
they are guaranteed under the by
laws.
The 13 groups affected are Cardi
nal Ballet, club sports, Mariachi Car
denal de Stanford. Stanford African
Students Association, Stanford
American Indian Organization, Stan
ford Concert Network, Stanford Mar
tial Arts Program. Stanford News
Readership Program. Stanford Scien

He added that the Senate will be
conducting outreach and education
efforts to reduce refund requests,
which should further minimize the
impact on group budgets.
"The senators are also going
around to dorms talking about re
funds. so we're trying to do our part to
curb it,"he said. "But this measure
was taken in the interest of the stabil
ity of the system, to make sure groups
can cover refunds."
Lin also pointed out that according
to ASSU by-laws, student groups are
only guaranteed 33 percent of their
ASSU funding each quarter. But
most have traditionally received all or
the majority of their funding at the be
ginning of the school year. So despite
the change, he said that student
groups arc still receiving more than
they are guaranteed under the by
laws.
