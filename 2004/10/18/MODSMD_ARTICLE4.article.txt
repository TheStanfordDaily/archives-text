# U.S. Senator says energy policy debate should be in national media spotlight
## Bingaman advocates greater efforts to lessen dependence on fossil fuels 
### JOE SEXTON 
In his keynote address to attendees of
the International Sustainability Days
Conference, Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-
New Mexico) expressed concern about
U.S. policy on energy and natural re
source use. as well as the United States'
position on climate change.
The event was organized by the Stan
ford Institute for the Environment, a new
on-campus organization that will bring
from many different academic fields to
gether to address current environmental
issues.
Bingaman stressed the importance of
convincing legislators that debates about
climate change and energy policy should
be in the national spotlight.
One way Bingaman hopes to accom
plish this goal is by conveying these issues
as matters of national security.
"Increasing our reliance on new ener
gy sources is important." Bingaman said.
"It will help prevent our security from
being held hostage by volatile regions
such as the Middle East.

"Cleaner fuels from home will help
deter us from a future in which we find
ourselves more reliant on others."
Bingaman also criticized current envi
ronmental policy in the United States; he
said that lawmakers are too passive and
too reluctant to act on the results of cur
rent climate change research.
"We don't have the luxury with cli
mate change to wait until the arctic has
melted or until the West is on fire before
we push for policy change." Bingaman
said. "It strikes me that acting on what
knowledge we have is the right course."
Bingaman's speech resonated with the
handful of students in attendance.
"It will not only be more environmen
tally devastating, but in the long-run it
will be a lot more economically detrimen
tal if we continue as we are now." said
sophomore Laura Bloomfield.
Bingaman argued not only that the
U.S. Government should be more active
in addressing issues of sustainability and
climate change, but also that real solu
tions to these problems require more par
ties at the bargaining table and a more dy
namic strategy.
Prof. Jeffrey Koseff, director of the
Stanford Institute for the Environment,
said that the newly formed group is com
mitted to doing just that.
"The most important message that
students should get is that in order to deal

with this issue, we need an interdiscipli
nary approach," Koseff said.
"The Stanford Institute for the Envi
ronment will he a forum of unlikely part
ners working towards a working solution.
We want it to be a place where every per
son, regardless of department or disci
pline. can come together and have their
views heard." he said.
Bingaman said, however, that no real
progress will be made until citizens,
politicians and corporations see environ
mental reform as immediately necessary.
"At every step we are challenged to
prove the reality of climate change, but
the framing of the debate has caused a
strong base of resistance," he said.
"No member of Congress will assert
that they are against preserving the envi
ronment. but the political implication of
(promoting environmentally-friendly
policies] has been associated with ratch
eting the taxes up."
But Bingaman expressed optimism
about the role organizations such as SIE
could play in making the environment a
more prominent political issue.
He tried to galvanize Stanford stu
dents to get involved, equating environ
mental problems to the national debt.
"These are problems that the people
of my generation are passing on to their
children."
