1963 — On Oct. IS, The Daily ran a
story on a speech on German democ
racy at the Hoover Institution. Below
is an excerpt:
'"The Democratic tradition in
Germany from the 11th century to
the present has been on of periodic
waning and reviving.' stated Dr.
Kurr Sieveking. President of the
American Society of Hamburg, at a
Hoover Institute seminar yesterday
afternoon in Tresidder Union.
Dr. Sieveking's speech. "Tradi
tion and the Future of Democracy in
Germany," gave a greater emphasis
to the historic aspect of German De
mocratic spirit in history, than to the
future of democracy in Germany.
How could Hitler have over
swept this democratic spirit that pre
vailed in Germany?' Dr. Sieveking
stated that it was the failure of the
democratic Weimar Republic to
provide for the basic needs of the
people that ushered in the rule of
Hitler. The most important blow
dealt to the Republic was the 1929
stock market crash in the United
States. This crash caused the govern
ment and the trade unions the loss of
the people, and thus prepared the
way for Hitler's appointment as
chancellor.
The German people, he said,
were in a very unique situation in
World War 11. They wished for the
defeat of a government that en
croached upon their democratic
rii»hts, and yet had to fight for their

existence as a nation."
1996 — On Oct. IS, The Daily ran a
story on University President
Casper's "Tea and Cookies" meeting
with concerned students.
"University President Gerhard
Casper was served up everything
from light fare to heavy questions
last night in the latest of his periodic
"Tea and Cookies" sessions at
Tresidder Union.
In the format — part of a series
of open meetings with students —
Casper took questions for more than
an hour on topics ranging from
skateboarding on campus to dis
abled access to campus community
centers. More than 100 students at
tended the meeting.
Casper, with assistance from
Dean of Students Marc Wais, also
fielded several questions on the sta
tus of campus parties in the wake of
two recent incidents in which the po
lice were called in to break up the
festivities.
'This can be a very, very unhappy
dilemma,' said Casper. 'It is not easy
to find a happy solution.'
'Stanford is not a sanctuary
against the law,' Wais added, 'but we
are not trying to make it into a police
state either. We are trying to ensure
that students hold safe and success
ful parties.'
