Human Rights for All
In recent days there has been a concerted effort to delegitimize any
objections to embryo-killing. Some have gone so far as to say that
society has a moral obligation to pursue lines of research involving
embryo-killing at taxpayers' expense. Advocates of this killing have
tried to malign those with objections by claiming that they are
imposing their "personal, private, and religious" views upon
everyone else and are preventing the development of needed cures.
We disagree.
We are 100% in support of the advancement of science and medicine,
and we are 100% in support of the development of stem cell therapy;
but we insist that all scientific and medicinal research proceed
while abiding to the objective demands of justice. Adult, umbilical
cord, and placenta stem cell therapies do just this - without harming
human beings - and they have cured thousands of people suffering
from over 56 different maladies. Embryonic stem cell therapy,
however - which has yet to be used in a single treatment requires the
destruction of human beings.
Before forming your own opinion, please consider these reflections.
All human beings are equal.
Basic justice requires that we not discriminate on the basis of
race, gender, or ethnicity. Likewise, justice requires that we
not discriminate on the basis of age, size, stage of
development, or condition of dependency. We see this
doctrine of equality clearly embedded in our Nation's
principles as stated in the Declaration of Independence: "We
hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men arc created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights, that among these are l.ife. Liberty and (he
pursuit of Happiness." Likewise, the 14"' Amendment states:
"No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
Human beings are intrinsically valuable
and have rights because of what they are.
Our Founding Fathers knew that human rights are not
bestowed by the government or by a majority. Human beings
have rights by virtue of their humanity. Our rights do not
derive from our strength or beauty, from our intelligence or
talents, or from our usefulness to others or to society as a
whole. "I'his explains why we defend the life of a mentally
handicapped child just as much as the life of a Nobel Prize
winning scientist. It would be manifestly evil to kill a
mentally handicapped child to harvest his organs for
transplant, just as it was wrong to enslave black human beings
for labor, or to exterminate Jews to create an "ideal" race.
Our nation's laws must extend the same
basic rights and protections to all
human beings.
If attacks were made on the mentally handicapped, African-
Americans, or Jews, we would expect our government to pass
laws protecting them. We would not expect our political
leaders to say that they were personally opposed to killing the
mentally ill, but thought others for the good of science
should have a choice to do so. We would not expect our
leaders to say that they were personally opposed to slavery,
but thought others should have the choice to own a slave. We
would not expect our leaders to say they were personally
opposed to the Holocaust, but thought others had a right to
choose to exterminate a class of people. Our opposition to
killing innocent human beings is not merely "personal" or
"private." It is a principled judgment based upon the demands
of justice. We have a duty to protect the members of our
society under attack by passing legislation prohibiting their
abuse, and prosecuting violators. We certainly wouldn't
argue for federal funding to subsidize the killing of the
mentally handicapped. African-Americans or Jews.
Why should it be any different with
human beings in the embryonic stage?
Our opponents insist that embryos are not human beings, or if
they are human beings, they are not yet "persons." But it
defies scientific fact to say that human embryos are anything
other than human beings at a certain, very early, stage of
development. And it is outrageous to relegate some human
beings to the status of "human non-persons."
A human embryo is a complete human
being at the beginning of development.
Some people say that we don't know even can't know
when the life of a new human being begins. They depict it as
a mystery —a "metaphysical" or even "theological" question.
But this is nonsense. Human embryogenesis and intrauterine
development are. in their essentials, well understood. As to
"when life begins," every textbook of embryology and
developmental biology currently in use in American medical
schools gives the same testimony. The most prominent of
these texts, The Developing Human (7 th ed. 2003). by Keith
Moore and T.V.N. Persaud, accurately defines the human
embryo as "the developing human during its early stages of
development." It notes that "human development begins at
fertilization when a male gamete or sperm (spermatozoon)
unites with a female gamete or oocyte (ovum) to form a single
cell a zygote. This highly specialized, totipotent cell
marked the beginning of each ofus as a unique individual."
This is not metaphysics or theology: it is elementary human
biology.
Each of us began life as an embryo.
Prior to fertilization there are only gametes — sperm and ova
which are both genetically and functionally parts of larger
entities, the father and the mother. But when a sperm and
ovum fuse, the life of a new, unique, genetically complete and
distinct human being begins. While none of us was ever a
sperm or an egg, each of us was once an embryo — or more
properly, an embryonic human being just as each of us was
once an adolescent, child, infant, and fetus. These terms refer
not to different kinds of beings, but to stages in the natural
development of a human being. Embryos, fetuses, infants,
adolescents, and adults differ not in kind (or substance), but in
maturity or stage of development. Regardless of how many
people claim that an embryo is merely a "clump of cells," the
facts of science prove that it is a human being. To have
destroyed the entities that we were in the embryonic stage
would have been to have destroyed us; it would not have been
merely to prevent possible human beings from coming into
existence.
*
A human embryo is not a potential
human being. Rather, it is a human
being with potential.
In the embryonic stage of our lives, each of us possessed the
genetic constitution and cpigenetic primordia to develop by a
process of internal self-direction and self-integration from the
embryonic into and through the fetal, infant, child, and
adolescent stages of development, and into adulthood with our
unity, determinateness, and identity intact. In other words,
each of us came into being as a human being; none of us
became a human being only at some point after coming into
being. In the embryonic stage of our lives, wc were not
"potential human beings," for we were human beings already.
Wc were potential adults. Our potential was, like the potential
of a fetus or a newborn infant, to mature into adulthood.
It is wrong to intentionally kill human
beings at any stage of development.
If it is a well established fact that human embryos are human
beings, why are we entertaining discussions about federally
funded embryo-destructive research? Just as it would be evil
to kill a mentally handicapped child to harvest his organs for
transplant, so too would it be evil to kill the embryonic human
being to harvest his stem cells for scientific research. Just as it
was wrong to exterminate Jews, so too is it wrong to execute
embryos, even for the laudable goal of fighting disease.
The direct and intentional killing of
innocent human life is the most
important political consideration.
We realize that many candidates who support embryo
protection fail on other issues. We yearn for the day when all
candidates will be pro-embryo-protection, so that we may
choose our representatives on the criteria of other issues.
While some of us may prefer the economic, educational,
health and foreign policies of certain pro-embryo-dcstruction
candidates, we recognize that the issues surrounding embryo
destructive research arc of paramount importance, and we arc
forced to distinguish between socially desirable policies and
the perpetuation of intrinsically evil acts. Imagine someone
claiming, "I'm not a fan of Jefferson Davis's support of
slavery, but his economic policies are more important."
More than 1.3 million human lives are extinguished every
year in abortions, and even more will die if unbridled embryo
destructive research is permitted. No candidate's tax,
educational, or foreign policy can be so good and certain of
its promises — that it justifies tolerating so grave an injustice
on so massive a scale. Pro-life citizens are not of one mind on
the war in Iraq. But we see that no candidate is running on a
platform of targeting innocent civilians or even accepting
"collateral damage" at the rate of 1.3 million deaths per year.
Even opponents of the war should sec that the massacre
against the unborn is the graver evil.
Contrary to the claims of our opponents, none of our appeals have been personal, private, or religious.
Our simple demand is for the equal protection of all human beings.
This November, we ask that you do not support politicians who deny basic human rights to an entire class of human beings.
A vote fora pro-embryo-destruction candidate is a vote for the direct and intentional killing of innocent human beings.
