# On and off campus, students prepare for Election Day
## Panelists debate merits of three Calif, propositions 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students and community mem
bers gathered in Tresidder Oak last
night to watch debates about three
contentious Calif, propositions that
will be on the state ballot for the
Nov. 2 election. The speakers ar
gued the merits of Prop. 66. which
revises California's three-strikes
law; Prop. 71. which sets aside $3
billion of state funds for stem-cell
research; and Prop. 72. which in
creases health-insurance require
ments for businesses.
Althoui»h the crowd was gener

ally small — the size peaked at 50
during the debate on Prop. 71 — at
tendees were often vocal and even
willing to chastise the speakers by
demanding, "Will you please an
swer the question?"
The debates were co-sponsored
by Stanford in Government and the
Peninsula Community Foundation.
Each debate was moderated by a
different member of Stanford in
Government.
Proposition 66: common sense or a
boon to criminals?
First on the agenda was Prop. 66.

which will restrict the application of
the three-strikes law to violent or
serious felonies. Bob Kearny of the
American Civil Liberties Union
said this proposition is a "common
sense" revision of the law.
" The effort is to restore voters'
intent when they voted for three
strikes 10 years ago," he said.
"What voters wanted was sentenc
ing for serious offenders. Right now
we have people serving life sen
tences for stealing a spare tire and
shoplifting."
To support his claim that the

three-strikes law, as written, pe
nalizes small-time offenders more
than dangerous criminals, Kearny
said that 58 percent of people serving
25 years to life for their third strike
were in jail fora nonviolent crime.
San Mateo District Attorney Jim
Fox countered that the proposition
would have disastrous conse
quences, particularly since it would
allow criminals sentenced under the
current three-strikes law to be re
sentenced and to presumably re
ceive lighter penalties.
"I find myself in a somewhat un
usual position, because in 1994 I was
the only district attorney instate to
take a position in opposition to the
three-strikes law," Fox said. "It
doesn't fix the three strikes law, it
dramatically alters it. Frankly if [fix
ing it] was all it did, I probably
wouldn't be here tonight."
According to Fox, he originally
objected to the law because it gave
too much power to district attorneys
and not enough power to judges, a
problem that was remedied in the
2(X)3 People v. Romero case, which
gave judges the authority to reject
sentences set by district attorneys.
Fox also cited several hypotheti
cal cases contrasting the sentences
under the current law and those
under the proposed law. One exam
ple he gave was a two-time convicted
rapist who was caught trying to
break into someone's house.
"Under Prop. 66, this is not a seri
ous crime, because it was only at
tempted robbery," he said. "The
proposition is so poorly worded that
we will end up victims of unintended
consequences."
Kearny, on the other hand, em
phasized that criminals can still be
harshly sentenced — and can still

see their sentences increased due to
repeat offenses — under other laws.
"California has four times as
many people serving under three
strikes as every other state with
three strikes combined," he said.
"There's this idea going around that
only three strikes is keeping us safe,
only three strikes exactly as it is writ
ten now, and that's just not true."
Proposition 71: Exciting
opportunity or a giveaway?
Prop. 71 would raise $3 billion for
embryonic stem-cell research over
the next 10 years through the sale of
bonds, and would cost the state and
estimated $6 billion. Kirk Klein
schmidt of the Yes on 71 campaign
told the audience that he was per
sonally excited by the possibilities
offered by stem-cell research.
"Regenerative medicine is a new
concept," he said. "Traditionally,
what we do is ultimately a mainte
nance strategy for chronic disease.
With our proposal, what we are hop
ing to do is fund the research that
will look at chronic diseases and do
the basic biomedical research that
hasn't been done yet and get the crit
ical mass to find a cure."
He added, "There are no promis
es or guarantees, but that doesn't
mean we shouldn't do it."
Dr. Rex Greene, a consultant on
bioethics, agreed that stem-cell re
search needs to be conducted, but
objected to the high cost of the
proposition, calling it a "giveaway."
"Our health care system is losing
emergency rooms, is losing trauma
centers," he said. "This is an unaf
fordable expense based on the sci
ence that backs it up, a science that is
in its infancy."

The two speakers also sparred over
how transparent the 29-member com
mittee created by Prop. 71 would be.
"It's in our interest to regularly
communicate with the public, be
cause it is their money and we want
them to know what's going on,"
Kleinschmidt said.
In Greene's view, however, the
committee would be free from
scrutiny, allowing "researchers and
entrepreneurs to coast for the next
10 years."
Kleinschmidt cited President
George W. Bush's antipathy to stem
cell research as one major reason for
state-funded research. But when
asked what would happen if Sen. John
Kerry won the election — making
state funding unnecessary — he said
that there was a general anti-stem-cell
atmosphere in Washington, D.C.
"Even if Kerry is elected I'm not
sure that anything will change with
federal funding," he said. "It's ex
tremely unlikely that both houses of
congress will change. In the past two
sessions, the House of Representa
tives has passed laws criminalizing
embryonic stem-cell research."
The most combative moment of
the debate was when an audience
member asked Greene if he would
be qualified to sit on the ethics com
mittee created by the proposition.
When the audience member inter
rupted Greene's response, Greene
asked the questioner if he had ties to
the Prop. 71 campaign.
"I would not be qualified to serve
as an ethicist on the board," Greene
acknowledged, but added, "1 think
that is a shabby attack on my cre
dentials."
Proposition 72: Help lor workers
or a disaster for business?

Propositions to change three-strikes
law, fund stem cell research on ballot

Dr. Hal Holman from Stanford's
School of Medicine spoke to the audi
ence in favor of Prop. 72, which is a
referendum on state senator John
Burton's bill requiring businesses
with 50 or more employees to offer in
dividual health-care plans. The bill
also requires businesses with 200 or
more employees to offer family plans.
"Perhaps the best way to consid
er Proposition 72 is to think about a
family member or a friend or a col
league who has had a serious ill
ness," Holman said.
"Contemplate what would have
happened to that family member or
colleague had they not had insur
ance. They would not been able to
get any regular pattern of health
care and would have had to depend
on emergency room care,"
Holman also argued, "The funda
mental opposition to this proposi
tion is coming from big business,
specifically big businesses like Wal-
Mart, Macy's and fast-food chains."
Jeff Acton, who owns seven local
Round Table Pizza restaurants,
characterized himself as a small
business owner who will be harmed
by the plan.
"This law says to businesses, 'If
you can't afford this, California
doesn't want you and you can go
away." he said. "And you know what?
That's what they're going to do."
Acton — who said that he pro
vides health care for only his man
agers and supervisors — estimated
that the bill would cost his own busi
ness $250,000 annually.
Holman acknowledged that the
bill would have costs, but argued,
"The cost of voting no is ill health,
ruined lives and bankruptcies. 1 say
vote your heart, and allow the eco
nomics to be worked out."
