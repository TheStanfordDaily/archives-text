# No Cell Phone etiquette?
## Jammer devices block cell-phone calls to stop annoying interruptions 
### SU FEN LEE DESK EDITOR 
Biological Sciences Associate Prof.
Michael Simon was surprised when a num
ber of cell phones — including that of his co
lecturer Prof. Robert Simoni — simultane
ously started ringing during his Bio 41 class
last Friday. He was probably even more sur
prised when none of the students reached
down in embarrassment to turn off his
ringer.
Generally, a cell-phone ring during class
is more likely to raise a professor's blood
pressure than tickle his funny bone.
In fact, it was precisely because Simon
was so "rattled" — as Qing Yuan Ong, a ju
nior majoring in chemical engineering, put it
— by prior cell phone interruptions in class
that Simoni originally decided to organize
the prank to disrupt lecture.
Although this specific situation was a
joke and not a chance occurrence, disrup
tions in the classroom due to cell phones are
becoming increasingly frequent. And unlike
this incident, professors and students are
usually not not sharing a chuckle afterward.
The problem posed by unwanted cell
phone ringing is not limited to the class
room. Moviegoers across the nation have
grimaced countless times while being sub
jected to a shrill intonation of "Confessions
Part 2" by Usher, and concert attendees
have long lamented having to hear two
pieces of music at once thanks to patrons
who neglected to switch to vibrate.
But just as modern technology brought
society the übiquitous cell-phone ring, it has
now provided an appropriate antidote: cell
phone jammers.
Jammers are devices that broadcast sig

nals on the same operating frequencies as
those of cell phones. The signals interfere
with any device transmitting in that frequen
cy range.
To a cell-phone user, the experience of
interference from a jammer is no different
from being in an area with little or no recep
tion — the cell phone simply reports that it
cannot achieve reception. The user could
have no idea a jammer is being used.
In the United States, actively jamming a
cell phone is currently illegal. According to
the Federal Communications Commission,
the government agency in charge of regulat
ing the public airwaves, commercial enter
prises such as cell-phone networks have pur
chased the rights to the frequency band.
Therefore, jamming their signals is consid
ered a form of property theft.
Although the FCC has yet to charge any
one with such a crime, jamming does come
with severe potential penalties. Offenders
who are caught can face up to an $11,000 fine
and a one-year jail term.
In several countries, cell-phone jammers
have already been put to use. In India, the
parliament installed jammer devices because
legislative sessions were constantly inter
rupted by politicians who ignored requests to
turn off their cell phones. Four churches in
Mexico installed jammers to counter those
who neglected to turn their cell phones off
during services and weddings.
Even universities in Italy have started
using jammers to prevent cheating during
exams — previously, some students were
sending text and picture messages regarding
test content to each other.
While some might object to the prospect
of having their cell phones jammed, others
think the cost is worth the benefit of avoid

ing being annoyed by others.
"I will (be in favor of] it," said Ong, who
said that she finds it distracting to have cell
phones going off during lectures and perfor
mances. "It's nice not to have cell phones
disturb lectures."
Ong also said that she has no qualms
about jammers being installed in other pub
lic places such as cinemas and concert halls.
"Some people will inherently forget to
turn off their cell phones," she said. "1 think
it is an infringement [to install a jammer],
but it's acceptable. After all, they are using it

in places where the use of cell phones is dis
couraged, so I'm fine with it."
Although some value the potential ad
vantages offered by jamming technology,
others disagree with implementing such de
vices fora variety of reasons.
Albert Hsu, a senior majoring in electri
cal engineering, does not completely agree
with the use of cell phone jammers in lecture
halls and movie theaters because he doesn't
believe there is enough need.
"Phones do go off." he said, "but it's not
a huge distraction."
Mark Liao, a sophomore majoring in

human biology, agreed that cell-phone jam
ming can also he an infringement not only
on those who own the frequencies, but also
on the individuals using the phones.
"Some people rely on their cells phones
for their livelihood — they need to stay in
contact with the world even while they rest,"
he said. "Traders, professions that are on
call are some of these. Disrupting phones
can be detrimental to their livelihood and
therefore disrupt their personal freedoms."
Liao admitted, though, that he thinks cell
phones ringing during lectures or in concert
performances are annoying, but pointed out
that "it is a way of life."
"I find it amazing when even though a
cell phone rings in lecture, not everyone
checks their phones and turns them off," he
said.
Liao is also a Peer Health Educator in
Lantana, an upperclass dorm on campus. He
does not think Stanford should install cell
phone jammers in lecture halls even if they
are legalized by the FCC.
"Cell phones are an important means of
communication in an emergency, and I be
lieve that such devices could hinder emer
gency access to 911 if it was needed." he
explained.
And if cell phone jammers were legalized,
Liao said that he felt people should be fully in
formed when jammers were installed.
"Could you imagine an on-call doctor not
realizing that his phone was being jammed
and he got a call fora life-threatening emer
gency?" he said. "And many people rely on
cell phones to call 911 in an emergency."
The French government recently ap
proved the use of cell phone jamming
equipment in cinemas, concert halls and
theaters. However, it acknowledged the im

portance of cell phone communication dur
ing emergencies. The legislation requires
that jamming devices allow emergency calls
to be made.
Japan has also allowed public places such
as theaters and concert halls to install cell
phone jammers, but they first must obtain a
government-issued license.
Although Liao stated he would be very
concerned about going to a theater with cell
phone jammers installed. Hsu said he would
still go to one with jammers and that he
would even be willing to travel out of his way
to go to such a theater.
"1 would probably just end up going to
the theater with jamming because 1 typically
don't need to check on my phone during a
movie," he continued.
Julie Sandler, a senior majoring in psy
chology, also said she would not mind going
to a theater with such jamming devices.
"But 1 would wish to know in advance so I
could prepare alternative means of communi
cation in case of emergency," she said.
"One of the main reasons why I have my
cell phone is to be contactable in the case of
an emergency," Sandler added. "1 have my
phone set to vibrate mode so that if some
thing urgent needs attention while I'm in
class, 1 can attend to it."
Beyond public courtesy, cell phone jam
mers serve other, more practical purposes. In
Mexico, banks have installed jammers to pre
vent potential robbers from communicating
with their accomplices. Mexican prisons are
planning to install them for similar reasons.
Earlier this year, jammers were also used
in Portugal during the Soccer Cup, Euro
2004. Security officers were issued 45 fre
quency jammers to prevent gang leaders
from organizing fights.
