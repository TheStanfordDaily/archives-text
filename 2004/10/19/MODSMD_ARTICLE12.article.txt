# Innovation fellows save lives with Biodesign
## 
### MELISSA FULLWOOD 
To the uninitiated, the concept of a
Biodesign Innovation fellowship might just
sound like a decent entry for the resume. But
for those who know better, this relatively
new Stanford offering has granted a host of
valuable hands-on experiences to its fellows,
and participants have had a unique opportu
nity to develop live-saving innovations in
medical-care technologies.
"This is the perfect program to be in if you
really want a career in the biodevice field and
if you have an entrepreneurial bent of mind,"
said Shubhayu Basu. one of this year's
Biodesign Innovation fellows.
Since 2(X)1, the Biodesign program at Stan
ford has offered four Biodesign Innovation
fellowships in cardiology or neuroscience and
neurosurgery.
This year's fellows are Shubhayu Basu,
Corinne Bright, Henry Chen and Ken Martin.
They come from a wide range of back
grounds. Basu recently linished a doctorate
in chemical engineering, while Bright fin
ished a doctorate in biomedical engineering.
Chen is a doctor who is integrating the
Biodesign Innovation fellowship into his cur
rent fellowship in cardiology.
And Martin has a master's in manufac
turing systems engineering. He is working
part-time on an MBA degree. In the past,
he has pursued a number of industrial pro
jects and has helped to start a venture to
bring robotics into cardiac catheterization
laboratories.

The Biodesign Innovation Program is de
signed to provide participants with the
knowledge and skills necessary to develop
new technologies in medicine. This back
ground is useful for inventors who then pur
sue either academic or industry careers.
Fellows undergo intensive clinical immer
sion and training, which culminates in the de
velopment of a new technology to meet clin
ical needs.
This year, the topic of the fellowship pro
gram is neuroscience and neurosurgery.
"I applied for the program because it cap
tured my interest in learning the process of
developing medical devices as part of a cross
disciplinary team of engineers and physi
cians," Bright said.
"The program is amazing," Bright contin
ued. "In fact, it is more than I ever dreamed
of. We are in the middle of clinical immer
sion right now and have been attending clin
ics, following patient rounds and watching
surgeries in the operating room for the last
four weeks."
"This is just a perfect opportunity to learn
skills [required for inventing]," Chen ex
plained. "Although neuroscience is not my
field of study, it is good to learn the process
es through this fellowship. In fact, this is bet
ter. because the assumptions are not there. 1
can look at these procedures with an unbi
ased eye."
"I expected to get a lot out from this year
when I started, and it's already beyond ex
pectations," he added.
Martin said that he loved the program.

"We have been extremely lucky to meet and
have great access to some amazingly talented
doctors who, given their huge work loads, are
unbelievably generous with their time to ex
plain what they are doing to us," he said.
Alumni of the fellowship program were
equally enthusiastic.
Amrish Walke and Evan Anderson
were two members of last year's team.
They worked on two projects during their
fellowships.
The first was a device for preventing as
piration pneumonia in patients after a
stroke. It was developed into a business
plan for Zarynx and won second prize in
the BASES E-Challenge. The second idea
was an improved method of bi-ventricular
pacing for patients with congestive heart
failure.
When asked if the Biodesign fellowship was
helpful to him. Walke replied, "Absolutely."
"First of all. I wanted to shift my career
track from the corporate environment... to
a more hands on. start-up environment," he
said. "I learned how to find and characterize
unique unmet medical needs, screen the con
cepts to solve those needs, prototype, make
business plans and pitch them to VCs. It also
helped me to get a great job with a medical
device incubator."
Anderson said that the Biodesign fellow
ship was helpful to him in two main ways.
"[lt| helped me recognize and define a
clinical need through interaction with care
givers, [and it gave me the] confidence that
when 1 do see a clinical need I will be able to

develop and evaluate multiple solutions in
terms of technical feasibility, market value
and intellectual property," he explained.
A new type of fellowship is being granted
in surgery. This offering allows surgical resi
dents the opportunity to learn knowledge
and skills essential to the early development
of new surgery technologies.
The surgery fellows are to be paired with
engineering fellows to form an interdisci
plinary team focused on exploring new surgi
cal innovations. Surgical applicants are ex
pected to have at least a few years of surgery
training.
Michael Gertner, co-director of the surgi
cal fellowship, explained the reasoning be
hind the format of the fellowship.
"We cater to the needs of the surgical res
ident," he said. "We recognize that fellows
will go back into a surgical residency and will
be applying for competitive clinical fellow
ships. which will want to sec publications
and other academic credentials. Therefore,
the fellowship is two years, and the second
year can be spent doing a master's degree in
bioengineering, an independent research
project."
"The fact that the program is two years
fits into the schedule of surgical residents
coming off the wards and into the fellow
ship," he added.
Gertner explained that the first year
largely replicates the innovative Biodesign
curriculum.
"Year two is evolving but depends on the
career goals of the fellow." he said. "The

Courtesy of Stanford Biodesign
basic goal is to take one project from the first
year and develop it. We recognize that not all
fellows will be ready for this degree of ab
stractness, so we'll provide other options like
the master's degree."
Dan Riskin is the first fellow in this pro
gram. He has an medical degree and an MBA
with a focus in biomechanical engineering.
"Being a prototype fellow is an exciting
experience," he said. "I have the opportuni
ty to not only work with some of the world
leaders in surgical innovation, but also to
help shape the first program in a new field.
"Being the first means a lot more work in
terms of creating structure and paving the
way for future fellows," he continued. "But,
the breadth of opportunity makes it well
worth it."
Applications for the Biodesign Innova
tion fellowship are due in December. To
those who know about the program but
are hesitant to apply for it, Shubhayu ad
vised, "The chances of making it might be
tough, but you are missing out on an op
portunity of a lifetime if you don't even
apply."
Many fellows recommended exploring
the fellowship by talking to alumni fellows
and people involved in the program to better
understand the commitment involved as well
as the opportunities.
As Riskin said, "To be the best appli
cant, you should fully understand why
you're applying, what you bring to the table
and exactly what you hope to get out of the
program."

Anderson said that the Biodesign fellow
ship was helpful to him in two main ways.
"[lt| helped me recognize and define a
clinical need through interaction with care
givers, [and it gave me the] confidence that
when 1 do see a clinical need I will be able to

develop and evaluate multiple solutions in
terms of technical feasibility, market value
and intellectual property," he explained.
A new type of fellowship is being granted
in surgery. This offering allows surgical resi
dents the opportunity to learn knowledge
and skills essential to the early development
of new surgery technologies.
The surgery fellows are to be paired with
engineering fellows to form an interdisci
plinary team focused on exploring new surgi
cal innovations. Surgical applicants are ex
pected to have at least a few years of surgery
training.
Michael Gertner, co-director of the surgi
cal fellowship, explained the reasoning be
hind the format of the fellowship.
"We cater to the needs of the surgical res
ident," he said. "We recognize that fellows
will go back into a surgical residency and will
be applying for competitive clinical fellow
ships. which will want to sec publications
and other academic credentials. Therefore,
the fellowship is two years, and the second
year can be spent doing a master's degree in
bioengineering, an independent research
project."
"The fact that the program is two years
fits into the schedule of surgical residents
coming off the wards and into the fellow
ship," he added.
Gertner explained that the first year
largely replicates the innovative Biodesign
curriculum.
"Year two is evolving but depends on the
career goals of the fellow." he said. "The

Courtesy of Stanford Biodesign
basic goal is to take one project from the first
year and develop it. We recognize that not all
fellows will be ready for this degree of ab
stractness, so we'll provide other options like
the master's degree."
Dan Riskin is the first fellow in this pro
gram. He has an medical degree and an MBA
with a focus in biomechanical engineering.
"Being a prototype fellow is an exciting
experience," he said. "I have the opportuni
ty to not only work with some of the world
leaders in surgical innovation, but also to
help shape the first program in a new field.
"Being the first means a lot more work in
terms of creating structure and paving the
way for future fellows," he continued. "But,
the breadth of opportunity makes it well
worth it."
Applications for the Biodesign Innova
tion fellowship are due in December. To
those who know about the program but
are hesitant to apply for it, Shubhayu ad
vised, "The chances of making it might be
tough, but you are missing out on an op
portunity of a lifetime if you don't even
apply."
Many fellows recommended exploring
the fellowship by talking to alumni fellows
and people involved in the program to better
understand the commitment involved as well
as the opportunities.
As Riskin said, "To be the best appli
cant, you should fully understand why
you're applying, what you bring to the table
and exactly what you hope to get out of the
program."





To the uninitiated, the concept of a
Biodesign Innovation fellowship might just
sound like a decent entry for the resume. But
for those who know better, this relatively
new Stanford offering has granted a host of
valuable hands-on experiences to its fellows,
and participants have had a unique opportu
nity to develop live-saving innovations in
medical-care technologies.
"This is the perfect program to be in if you
really want a career in the biodevice field and
if you have an entrepreneurial bent of mind,"
said Shubhayu Basu. one of this year's
Biodesign Innovation fellows.
Since 2(X)1, the Biodesign program at Stan
ford has offered four Biodesign Innovation
fellowships in cardiology or neuroscience and
neurosurgery.
This year's fellows are Shubhayu Basu,
Corinne Bright, Henry Chen and Ken Martin.
They come from a wide range of back
grounds. Basu recently linished a doctorate
in chemical engineering, while Bright fin
ished a doctorate in biomedical engineering.
Chen is a doctor who is integrating the
Biodesign Innovation fellowship into his cur
rent fellowship in cardiology.
And Martin has a master's in manufac
turing systems engineering. He is working
part-time on an MBA degree. In the past,
he has pursued a number of industrial pro
jects and has helped to start a venture to
bring robotics into cardiac catheterization
laboratories.

The Biodesign Innovation Program is de
signed to provide participants with the
knowledge and skills necessary to develop
new technologies in medicine. This back
ground is useful for inventors who then pur
sue either academic or industry careers.
Fellows undergo intensive clinical immer
sion and training, which culminates in the de
velopment of a new technology to meet clin
ical needs.
This year, the topic of the fellowship pro
gram is neuroscience and neurosurgery.
"I applied for the program because it cap
tured my interest in learning the process of
developing medical devices as part of a cross
disciplinary team of engineers and physi
cians," Bright said.
"The program is amazing," Bright contin
ued. "In fact, it is more than I ever dreamed
of. We are in the middle of clinical immer
sion right now and have been attending clin
ics, following patient rounds and watching
surgeries in the operating room for the last
four weeks."
"This is just a perfect opportunity to learn
skills [required for inventing]," Chen ex
plained. "Although neuroscience is not my
field of study, it is good to learn the process
es through this fellowship. In fact, this is bet
ter. because the assumptions are not there. 1
can look at these procedures with an unbi
ased eye."
"I expected to get a lot out from this year
when I started, and it's already beyond ex
pectations," he added.
Martin said that he loved the program.

"We have been extremely lucky to meet and
have great access to some amazingly talented
doctors who, given their huge work loads, are
unbelievably generous with their time to ex
plain what they are doing to us," he said.
Alumni of the fellowship program were
equally enthusiastic.
Amrish Walke and Evan Anderson
were two members of last year's team.
They worked on two projects during their
fellowships.
The first was a device for preventing as
piration pneumonia in patients after a
stroke. It was developed into a business
plan for Zarynx and won second prize in
the BASES E-Challenge. The second idea
was an improved method of bi-ventricular
pacing for patients with congestive heart
failure.
When asked if the Biodesign fellowship was
helpful to him. Walke replied, "Absolutely."
"First of all. I wanted to shift my career
track from the corporate environment... to
a more hands on. start-up environment," he
said. "I learned how to find and characterize
unique unmet medical needs, screen the con
cepts to solve those needs, prototype, make
business plans and pitch them to VCs. It also
helped me to get a great job with a medical
device incubator."
