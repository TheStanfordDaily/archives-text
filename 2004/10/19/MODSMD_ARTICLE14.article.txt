## Editorial GCC holds potential for grad scene 
### 
Last's Friday's opening of the Graduate Com
munity Center, Stanford's new multipurpose
facility for graduate students, was anxiously
awaited by many in the campus community.
Its opening has served as a positive gesture from the
University and a signal of Stanford's intent to im
prove the quality of graduate student life.
If the students are able to take advantage of the
academic and recreational opportunities in the GCC,
the Center's construction could very well mark the be
ginning of a more active, unified graduate community.
The GCC was conceived of in response to a 2001
survey in which graduate students reported that
their residential environments were isolating and
lacked adequate facilities for social activities.
Although the undergraduate students on campus
have access to many areas for social interaction, the
graduate students have not been so fortunate up
until now. Instead of feeling as though the only so
cial functions on campus are run by undergraduates,
graduate students now have the chance to interact
with each other in a center that caters to their needs.
A particularly unique feature of the GCC is the
children's playroom. This thoughtful addition will
help accommodate graduate students with families
who want to use the new facility.
One of the highlights of the GCC is its versatility
— students can take advantage of the recreational
areas to meet people outside of their own discipline,

while at the same time still have areas to work on aca
demies with their colleagues.
The University responded well to the graduate
students' wish that East Campus should have a cen
tral meeting place that could serve as the focal point
of graduate social life. The GCC is perfectly located
in Escondido Village, where a substantial portion of
the graduate community lives.
University officials, the Graduate Student Coun
cil and the Center planning committee should be
applauded for their swiftness in envisioning and ex
ecuting the construction of the GCC. The prompt
reaction to the graduate community's request sends
the message that graduate student needs are being
recognized and taken seriously.
A pub is expected to be installed in the GCC during
winter quarter, but the composition of the facility is such
that most of the activities hosted by the center will have
to be organized and run by the students themselves.
As the GCC's staff is responsible mainly for ad
ministrative duties such as booking rooms, the bur
den for planning social activities falls on the shoul
ders of the graduate students.
Now that the graduate community has been
granted their wish fora place to congregate in the
GCC, they must take the initiative to transform the
quiet center into a hub of activity. Only then can the
GCC fully reach its potential for creating a more in
tegrated and vibrant graduate student community.
