## Blind liberalism taking over colleges 
### NATHALIE DE LEON 
As 1 sat down in the lounge to
watch the presidential debates, 1 was
hoping to hear interesting com
ments from my dorm mates and fel
low students, who are diverse in
background and academic interests.
Instead, 1 was shocked to hear a se
ries of unintelligent and uninformed
comments at each turn. In a series of
debates critical to the future of our
nation, it was appalling to hear such
a juvenile response from my fellow
students.
Students snickered at John
Kerry's misspeak about "funding
proliferation" and the president's
infamous mispronunciation of "nu
clear." Sure, malapropisms are
funny. They become less funny
when we are at war.
When one student asked a point
ed question of healthcare policy, I
began to explain in a wholly nonpar
tisan way what the arguments were
for both sides. She simply walked
away, saying it was "shameful" that
there was another view. It was as
though she was afraid to hear about
competing arguments, and afraid to
intellectually assess the situation.
Having spent my undergraduate
years at Stanford and now starting
my graduate studies at Harvard, I
have arguably been exposed to
some of the brightest minds of my
generation. Yet 1 have been contin
ually disappointed at a profound
lack of intellectualism in most stu
dents. The disturbing behavior I
have observed is the unwillingness
of students to form coherent and
logical arguments.
There are numerous causes for
the decline of intellectualism. but
they can be boiled down to three
major factors:
1) A push in higher education to
wards specialization and mar
ketability of skills.

After perhaps one year of gener
al education at most schools, stu
dents are pushed into a major and
then a specialization. They are en
couraged to "find their passion" and
eschew other subjects.
Even worse, majors often have a
very small set of core classes, and
students can choose at random to
fulfill their requirements. A history
major can graduate with only knowl
edge of women's resistance move
ments; an English major can get
away with knowing a lot about
Melville and not much else. As a re
sult, students are reluctant to engage
on a wide array of topics.
2) A complete failure to give stu
dents the appropriate background
and appreciation of their intellectual
heritage, as well as a failure on the
part of the students to seek it.
Partially as a result of the first
factor, and partially as a conse
quence of the rise of constructivist
thought in pedagogy, the education
al system fails to teach students
about the march of human knowl
edge. Students are not given ade
quate background in basic logic and
classical thought, and are thus not
able to assess modern-day issues in
their appropriate context.
Their lack of training in logic leads
to obvious complications. This also
creates the problem that students are
unable to engage when they are
taken away from familiar ground.
3) A cultural shift that places
more value on cute, unqualified
statements than well-formulated ar
guments.
Perhaps most telling, my dorm
mates preferred to watch the Daily
Show commentary on the presiden
tial debates above any news sources.
In a culture that prioritizes snip
py phrases over cogent logic, the ul
timate broadcaster is Jon Stewart. I
completely agree that when Stewart
takes news clips and unmercifully

ridicules important public figures,
it's very funny. But that's all that it
is, and I'm not sure that my fellow
students always realize it.
In fact, Jon Stewart was recently
on CNN's Crossfire complaining
that the news media had sunk to his
level of analysis. Somehow, cynicism
and kitsch became much more palat
able than logic. In that cultural back
ground, it should be no surprise that
students prize a one-line zinger
above reason.
When a student makes a state
ment such as "1 don't understand
how anyone can vote for that idiot,"
I challenge them to offer a clear ar
gument, and they often seem bewil
dered that I would even ask. When I
press, I get a series of standardized,
loosely strung together talking
points.
A form of blind liberalism has
taken over our campuses, and it is
massacring any form of intellectual
diversity. Rather than assume their
place in the intellectual elite, stu
dents prefer to stick to pithy turns of
phrase without substance or reason.
Students and administrations are
too quick to stifle ideas with which
they disagree rather than having a
meaningful dialogue. One would only
have to look as far as UC-Berkeley's
Horowitz debacle or Cal Poly's cen
sure of Steve Hinkle to realize that.
It is troubling that the culture of
academic life has eschewed the no
tion of vibrant discussion. Instead,
we stifle what we do not want to
hear, and we fail to engage on topics
for which we have not studied. If we
walk away from our debates, we will
never be able to progress, and the
culture and cause of intellectualism
will be beyond repair.

there was another view. It was as
though she was afraid to hear about
competing arguments, and afraid to
intellectually assess the situation.
Having spent my undergraduate
years at Stanford and now starting
my graduate studies at Harvard, I
have arguably been exposed to
some of the brightest minds of my
generation. Yet 1 have been contin
ually disappointed at a profound
lack of intellectualism in most stu
dents. The disturbing behavior I
have observed is the unwillingness
of students to form coherent and
logical arguments.
There are numerous causes for
the decline of intellectualism. but
they can be boiled down to three
major factors:
1) A push in higher education to
wards specialization and mar
ketability of skills.

After perhaps one year of gener
al education at most schools, stu
dents are pushed into a major and
then a specialization. They are en
couraged to "find their passion" and
eschew other subjects.
Even worse, majors often have a
very small set of core classes, and
students can choose at random to
fulfill their requirements. A history
major can graduate with only knowl
edge of women's resistance move
ments; an English major can get
away with knowing a lot about
Melville and not much else. As a re
sult, students are reluctant to engage
on a wide array of topics.
2) A complete failure to give stu
dents the appropriate background
and appreciation of their intellectual
heritage, as well as a failure on the
part of the students to seek it.
Partially as a result of the first
factor, and partially as a conse
quence of the rise of constructivist
thought in pedagogy, the education
al system fails to teach students
about the march of human knowl
edge. Students are not given ade
quate background in basic logic and
classical thought, and are thus not
able to assess modern-day issues in
their appropriate context.
Their lack of training in logic leads
to obvious complications. This also
creates the problem that students are
unable to engage when they are
taken away from familiar ground.
3) A cultural shift that places
more value on cute, unqualified
statements than well-formulated ar
guments.
Perhaps most telling, my dorm
mates preferred to watch the Daily
Show commentary on the presiden
tial debates above any news sources.
In a culture that prioritizes snip
py phrases over cogent logic, the ul
timate broadcaster is Jon Stewart. I
completely agree that when Stewart
takes news clips and unmercifully

ridicules important public figures,
it's very funny. But that's all that it
is, and I'm not sure that my fellow
students always realize it.
In fact, Jon Stewart was recently
on CNN's Crossfire complaining
that the news media had sunk to his
level of analysis. Somehow, cynicism
and kitsch became much more palat
able than logic. In that cultural back
ground, it should be no surprise that
students prize a one-line zinger
above reason.
When a student makes a state
ment such as "1 don't understand
how anyone can vote for that idiot,"
I challenge them to offer a clear ar
gument, and they often seem bewil
dered that I would even ask. When I
press, I get a series of standardized,
loosely strung together talking
points.
A form of blind liberalism has
taken over our campuses, and it is
massacring any form of intellectual
diversity. Rather than assume their
place in the intellectual elite, stu
dents prefer to stick to pithy turns of
phrase without substance or reason.
Students and administrations are
too quick to stifle ideas with which
they disagree rather than having a
meaningful dialogue. One would only
have to look as far as UC-Berkeley's
Horowitz debacle or Cal Poly's cen
sure of Steve Hinkle to realize that.
It is troubling that the culture of
academic life has eschewed the no
tion of vibrant discussion. Instead,
we stifle what we do not want to
hear, and we fail to engage on topics
for which we have not studied. If we
walk away from our debates, we will
never be able to progress, and the
culture and cause of intellectualism
will be beyond repair.

As 1 sat down in the lounge to
watch the presidential debates, 1 was
hoping to hear interesting com
ments from my dorm mates and fel
low students, who are diverse in
background and academic interests.
Instead, 1 was shocked to hear a se
ries of unintelligent and uninformed
comments at each turn. In a series of
debates critical to the future of our
nation, it was appalling to hear such
a juvenile response from my fellow
students.
Students snickered at John
Kerry's misspeak about "funding
proliferation" and the president's
infamous mispronunciation of "nu
clear." Sure, malapropisms are
funny. They become less funny
when we are at war.
When one student asked a point
ed question of healthcare policy, I
began to explain in a wholly nonpar
tisan way what the arguments were
for both sides. She simply walked
away, saying it was "shameful" that
there was another view. It was as
though she was afraid to hear about
competing arguments, and afraid to
intellectually assess the situation.
