# Tales of a grad student
## Eight simple rules for dating a grad student 
### 
It has come to my attention that
despite our towering intellects,
foraging skills and incredible
resilience, grad students are
not being asked out in droves by our
younger counterparts.
At first I thought this was due to
insurmountable differences, but re
cently it's occurred to me what's re
ally needed is some kind of guide
— a simple primer on how to cap
ture the heart (or some other part)
of your favorite graduate student.
One thing before I start: My use
of male / female pronouns stems
from my particular inclinations —
feel free to mix things up. the same
principles apply.
So here we go, in homage to W.
Bruce Cameron, eight simple rules:
1) I'm sure you've heard that the
fastest way to a man's heart is
through his stomach. Now that's not
actually true. There are faster ways,
but I'm afraid they're all NC-17.
Having said that, grad students
are easily lured with food. Espe
cially when it's free. We don't get
care packages anymore, and we
miss them.
Remember — it doesn't matter
if that best you can come up with is
a sandwich. You still won't find a
more enthusiastic response to any
thing you do . ..and I do mean
anything.
2) Don't mock the cycle helmet.
One day you'll care about your
head too.
3) Let us talk about work. As
much as they may profess not to, a
typical graduate student loves to
talk about his work. More than any
other topic, we want to explain
what we do.
Whether this is because of our
passion for our subject or because
of some deep-seated need to justify
our existence is open to debate . ..
4) Don't be surprised if you
don't get to meet many of his
friends. It's not because you're em
barrassing— though that may still
be true — rather, we don't know

that many people.
5) Be nice to aforementioned
friends. Like I said, we don't have
that many, and we can't afford to
lose them. I understand that it's dif-

ficult to commu
nicate with peo
ple like me, as
we tend to labor
under the im
pression that ev
eryone is as
equally con
cerned with the
missing minus
sign on the third
line down of the

day's calculation. Just nod and
smile.
6) Offer constant reassurance
that we're not wasting our time.
We've chosen poverty over jobs,
school over growing up, and we
constantly live in fear that we've
made the wrong choice. Please
massage our egos ... and anything
you else you choose.
7) Don't go on about the crazy
fun you're having with your class
mates. I'm sure that last night's
dorm party was loaded with the
kind of crazy antics that wouldn't
look out of place in "American Pie
4: American Divorce," but we
don't want to be reminded of how
much fun life used to be.
8) Don't keep us out too late.
We're old. and we need our beauty
sleep.
It occurs to me that this piece
only gives half the story, and some
would argue that a similar set of
rules should apply to dating an un
dergraduate. However, that's not
really my area.
All I can do is suggest that
you're more flexible than us and
point out that the newly minted bil
lionaire founders of Google were
once Stanford graduate students.
