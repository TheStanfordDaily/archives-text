### LAUREN MELNICk COLUMBIA DAILY SPECTATOR (COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
(U-WIRF.) NLW YORK —Student leaders
and delegates from Columbia and other New
York universities met with representatives from
several schools in the tri-state area on Saturday
fora planning session to discuss the upcoming
( 'ollege Queer I .eadership ( onference at Rutgers
University. Saturday's event, co-sponsored by
Columbia and NYU, took place in the Kimmel
Center's Rosenthal Pavilion, NYU's student cen
ter.
Participants from Columbia, NYU. Princeton
I Jniversity, Yale University, Rutgers and Brook
lyn College discussed the goals and details of the
upcoming conference, which is tentatively titled,
"Widening (lie Spectrum." and is scheduled for
February or March. Leaders of the planning ses
sion included Senior Yi-sheng Ng. president of
Columbia's Queer Alliance; Mike Brown, head of
NYU's Pride Month Committee; and Shaun
Rosenstein, president of NYU's Queer Union.
In preparation for Saturday's planning session
for the upcoming conference, last year's CQLC at
Princeton was discussed. Past favorites among the
delegates included workshops such as Heterosex
ism, which confronted the issue of the heterosex
ual relationship structure as the only acceptable
one; Bi-Phobia. where the difficulty to find accep
tance m both the straight and queer communities
was addressed; and the Transgender Workshop,
in which students constructed a gender neutral
world.

Designed as an inter-collegiate activist confer
ence, participants stressed that they were interest
ed in networking with local and national LGBTQ
college organizations, as well as serving as a sup
port network in which some campuses in the tri
state area would support others.
"Building social unity is the ultimate goal of
promoting tolerance," said Chris Dunay, a mem
ber of the NYU delegation.
An important aspect of the planning session
was contacting schools and getting more people to
attend. Participants discussed questions of how to
increase interaction with openly queer faculty and
administrators, how to get in contact with them,
and whether to develop a workshop for adminis
trators themselves as well as for students.
As a way to defray costs of the conference, stu
dents recommended sponsorship by corporate
and non-corporate entities in the Northeast in ad
dition to grants. They also suggested professors
and celebrities as keynote speakers, such as Hazel
Carby, Harvey Fierstein, Urvashi Viad. Samuel
Delaney, Morgan Hertzman, and cast members of
"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy."
Student leaders allocated responsibilities like
keeping in touch with other schools' representa
tives, recruiting conference attendees, regional
outreach, pushing for an LGBTQ office on cam
pus, communicating with West Coast schools, and
integrating new people into the organizations
such as underclassmen and graduate students.
By the end of the two-hour meeting, workshop
ideas included how to involve straight allies of the
queer community, minorities in the queer com
munity, queer gender alliances, and queer politi

cal actions.
Treatment of homosexual behavior in blood
drives has mobilized both NYU and Columbia
queer activists. During a blood drive last year,
NYU's LGBTQ distributed post cards with infor
mation about the FDA recommendations to bar
men who have had sex with men since 1977 from
giving blood. While the FDA recommendations
are not law, they are almost universally followed.
Columbia's Queer Alliance set up an information
table and started a petition to protest the FDA,
but it "should have been done more," said Anna,
a delegate with Columbia.
"With such a need for blood, why would they
dismiss (gay men)?" said Heather Martin, secre
tary of NYU's Queer Union.
Politicized issues such as blood drive discrimi
nation and gay marriage were topics that partici
pants deliberately discussed with delicacy. Politi
cal hot topics have been a divisive and fragmen
tary issue in the past, and the representatives
wanted to avoid divisive issues in order to create
alliances.
"CQLC has no official (political) stance, but
wants to create a space for activism," the facilita
tor said.
The planning session is the first official meet
ing between the campuses involved in CQLC, but
further discussion, planning, and correspondence
will take place over the following months. "This
was a good jumping off point for the conference
later next year and a lot was accomplished today,"
said Alex, a sophomore member of the Columbia
delegation.

integrating new people into the organizations
such as underclassmen and graduate students.
By the end of the two-hour meeting, workshop
ideas included how to involve straight allies of the
queer community, minorities in the queer com
munity, queer gender alliances, and queer politi

cal actions.
Treatment of homosexual behavior in blood
drives has mobilized both NYU and Columbia
queer activists. During a blood drive last year,
NYU's LGBTQ distributed post cards with infor
mation about the FDA recommendations to bar
men who have had sex with men since 1977 from
giving blood. While the FDA recommendations
are not law, they are almost universally followed.
Columbia's Queer Alliance set up an information
table and started a petition to protest the FDA,
but it "should have been done more," said Anna,
a delegate with Columbia.
"With such a need for blood, why would they
dismiss (gay men)?" said Heather Martin, secre
tary of NYU's Queer Union.
Politicized issues such as blood drive discrimi
nation and gay marriage were topics that partici
pants deliberately discussed with delicacy. Politi
cal hot topics have been a divisive and fragmen
tary issue in the past, and the representatives
wanted to avoid divisive issues in order to create
alliances.
"CQLC has no official (political) stance, but
wants to create a space for activism," the facilita
tor said.
The planning session is the first official meet
ing between the campuses involved in CQLC, but
further discussion, planning, and correspondence
will take place over the following months. "This
was a good jumping off point for the conference
later next year and a lot was accomplished today,"
said Alex, a sophomore member of the Columbia
delegation.
