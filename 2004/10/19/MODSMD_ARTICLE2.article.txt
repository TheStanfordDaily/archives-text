Some Stanford students are passing up dorm trips
and beach excursions this quarter and instead are
choosing to escape the bubble by traveling to swing
states.
Both liberal and conservative student groups are
planning campaign trips to Reno and Las Vegas in the
days leading up to the election. According to a poll
taken between Oct. 1 and Oct. 3 by Survey USA. Pres
ident George W. Bush leads Sen. John Kerry by 4 per
cent in Nevada.
Senior Mattie Hutton is organizing "a massive get
out-the-vote drive" for Stanford students "to help pro
gressive Nevada voters get to the polls and to talk to
undecideds," during the weekend before Election
Day, she said.
More than 100 students have volunteered to go on
the trip. Transportation and lodging will be paid for by
the political advocacy organization America Coming
Together. Hutton is not an official organizer for
America Coming Together. "I'm just the point person
letting 11he group| know what Stanford students
need." she said.
Hutton said she began getting more involved in the
political process after spending winter quarter in
Washington. D.C. last year. At first, facilitating politi
cal involvement at Stanford was a challenge: "Class
and extracurriculars and work; everything keeps us so
busy." Hutton said. "But something about this elec
tion calls people into action."
Senior Joe Fairbanks, president of Students for
Bush, agreed that the hectic college lifestyle could
limit political activism. "1 haven't met one person who
says T don't care,"' he said. "They always say 'I'm too
busy.'"
Fairbanks, who is also the president of the Stanford
Conservative Union, is leading a Students for Bush
campaign trip to Las Vegas and Reno during the week
before the election. The trip will be funded by the Na
tional Republican Party.
"Most likely, we'll be walking through precincts,
knocking on doors and doing literature drop-offs, and
maybe holding rallies for the president â€” it really
varies." he added.
In another effort to reach Nevada voters, senior
Bonnie Johnson, a leader of Students for Kerry, began
organizing weekly campaign trips to Reno last month.
Group members spent the last three visits "knocking

on doors, dropping
off literature and
talking to people
with prepared talk
ing points," she
said.
The group is not
affiliated with the
University and is in
dependent of the
Democratic Party.

after spending her summer logging 80-hour weeks vol

est" among friends, she said.

work as the lead organizer of the Baobabs College Lab
Project, a progressive youth voter mobilization effort.
