# Students and alumni volunteer for Bush, Kerry camps
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Some Stanford students are passing up dorm trips
and beach excursions this quarter and instead are
choosing to escape the bubble by traveling to swing
states.
Both liberal and conservative student groups are
planning campaign trips to Reno and Las Vegas in the
days leading up to the election. According to a poll
taken between Oct. 1 and Oct. 3 by Survey USA. Pres
ident George W. Bush leads Sen. John Kerry by 4 per
cent in Nevada.
Senior Mattie Hutton is organizing "a massive get
out-the-vote drive" for Stanford students "to help pro
gressive Nevada voters get to the polls and to talk to
undecideds," during the weekend before Election
Day, she said.
More than 100 students have volunteered to go on
the trip. Transportation and lodging will be paid for by
the political advocacy organization America Coming
Together. Hutton is not an official organizer for
America Coming Together. "I'm just the point person
letting 11he group| know what Stanford students
need." she said.
Hutton said she began getting more involved in the
political process after spending winter quarter in
Washington. D.C. last year. At first, facilitating politi
cal involvement at Stanford was a challenge: "Class
and extracurriculars and work; everything keeps us so
busy." Hutton said. "But something about this elec
tion calls people into action."
Senior Joe Fairbanks, president of Students for
Bush, agreed that the hectic college lifestyle could
limit political activism. "1 haven't met one person who
says T don't care,"' he said. "They always say 'I'm too
busy.'"
Fairbanks, who is also the president of the Stanford
Conservative Union, is leading a Students for Bush
campaign trip to Las Vegas and Reno during the week
before the election. The trip will be funded by the Na
tional Republican Party.
"Most likely, we'll be walking through precincts,
knocking on doors and doing literature drop-offs, and
maybe holding rallies for the president — it really
varies." he added.
In another effort to reach Nevada voters, senior
Bonnie Johnson, a leader of Students for Kerry, began
organizing weekly campaign trips to Reno last month.
Group members spent the last three visits "knocking

on doors, dropping
off literature and
talking to people
with prepared talk
ing points," she
said.
The group is not
affiliated with the
University and is in
dependent of the
Democratic Party.

tivism at Stanford

after spending her summer logging 80-hour weeks vol
unteering for the Kerry-Edwards campaign in Boston
and New Hampshire. When she arrived hack on cam
pus, Students for Kerry "rose up out of mutual inter
est" among friends, she said.
Junior Adam Schwartz stopped-out this quarter to
work as the lead organizer of the Baobabs College Lab
Project, a progressive youth voter mobilization effort.

In the last week, he has traveled to
help campus leaders get out the vote
in Pennsylvania, New Mexico and
Missouri.
Schwartz said he's always been
somewhat politically active, but was
energized after volunteering at
Howard Dean's Burlington cam
paign headquarters the summer fol
lowing his freshman year.
"1 met kids who were leaving
school to campaign full-time. I was
really impressed by that." he said.
Even if Stanford students can't
make out-of-state trips, they can im
pact the election in small ways at
home, said Patrick Crosetto, ( lass of
2002, a second year student at the
Graduate School of Business who
served as the president of Students
for Bush in 2000.
"Every little bit helps; even if it's
just making sure every person in
your dorm votes," he said. "It's
naive to think that just because your
state isn't a swing state, you
shouldn't get involved."
Alternately, Stanford students
can campaign for candidates at the
state level, said Natalie Lui, Class of
IW7, the events chair for the Young
Republicans of Silicon Valley.
"A lot of people don't realize
how important it is to vote in the
California election," she added. Lui
has focused on campaigning at the
state level as a volunteer for Steve
Poizner, a Republican candidate to
the State Assembly for the 21st dis
trict. which covers Stanford.
Lui. a self-described moderate
and former delegate to the Republi
can National Convention, said the
State Assembly election addresses
"issues like the Silicon Valley econ
omy and education reform - real
areas which I think touch the lives of

Groups head
to Nevada

people in college."
"I would love to help get out the
vote in swing states, but I can't just
pick up and leave for weeks at a
time," Lui added.
Schwartz said he appreciated the
freedom of being a college student.
"I have the luxury of youth and
privilege to be able to fight fora
cause," he said. "It would be nice, in
an ideal world, if everyone could be
involved."
Alter the election, campus politi
cal groups will refocus their energies
away from active campaigning.
Johnson said Students for Kerry will
"see if there's any reason to stay to
gether as a group." In the case of a
contested election, the group would
stay together, she said.
"The Bush administration has
made people form some pretty
strong opinions and become much
more active." Johnson said. "I think
it will be interesting to see what hap
pens after the election. Will people
keep up with their activism?"
Fairbanks said the current level
of political activism on campus is un
usually high.
"It's probably going to die off
after the election," he said.
I lowever. Students for Bush "will
still exist as a group... to defend
| Bush's] policies and remain commit
ted to the truth," Fairbanks added.
Mutton said the effects of this
campaign will be ongoing.
"Once you get really excited
about an election, you realize it's not
just a one-time thing - the issues, the
process, all those things are impor
tant after the election."
Regardless of the Election Day
outcome, Schwartz said he will re
turn to Stanford next quarter. "I
miss school," he said.

undecideds," during the weekend before Election
Day, she said.
More than 100 students have volunteered to go on
the trip. Transportation and lodging will be paid for by
the political advocacy organization America Coming
Together. Hutton is not an official organizer for
America Coming Together. "I'm just the point person
letting 11he group| know what Stanford students
need." she said.
Hutton said she began getting more involved in the
political process after spending winter quarter in
Washington. D.C. last year. At first, facilitating politi
cal involvement at Stanford was a challenge: "Class
and extracurriculars and work; everything keeps us so
busy." Hutton said. "But something about this elec
tion calls people into action."
Senior Joe Fairbanks, president of Students for
Bush, agreed that the hectic college lifestyle could
limit political activism. "1 haven't met one person who
says T don't care,"' he said. "They always say 'I'm too
busy.'"
Fairbanks, who is also the president of the Stanford
Conservative Union, is leading a Students for Bush
campaign trip to Las Vegas and Reno during the week
before the election. The trip will be funded by the Na
tional Republican Party.
"Most likely, we'll be walking through precincts,
knocking on doors and doing literature drop-offs, and
maybe holding rallies for the president — it really
varies." he added.
In another effort to reach Nevada voters, senior
Bonnie Johnson, a leader of Students for Kerry, began
organizing weekly campaign trips to Reno last month.
Group members spent the last three visits "knocking

on doors, dropping
off literature and
talking to people
with prepared talk
ing points," she
said.
The group is not
affiliated with the
University and is in
dependent of the
Democratic Party.

after spending her summer logging 80-hour weeks vol
unteering for the Kerry-Edwards campaign in Boston
and New Hampshire. When she arrived hack on cam
pus, Students for Kerry "rose up out of mutual inter
est" among friends, she said.
Junior Adam Schwartz stopped-out this quarter to
work as the lead organizer of the Baobabs College Lab
Project, a progressive youth voter mobilization effort.

JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily


In the last week, he has traveled to
help campus leaders get out the vote
in Pennsylvania, New Mexico and
Missouri.
Schwartz said he's always been
somewhat politically active, but was
energized after volunteering at
Howard Dean's Burlington cam
paign headquarters the summer fol
lowing his freshman year.
"1 met kids who were leaving
school to campaign full-time. I was
really impressed by that." he said.
Even if Stanford students can't
make out-of-state trips, they can im
pact the election in small ways at
home, said Patrick Crosetto, ( lass of
2002, a second year student at the
Graduate School of Business who
served as the president of Students
for Bush in 2000.
"Every little bit helps; even if it's
just making sure every person in
your dorm votes," he said. "It's
naive to think that just because your
state isn't a swing state, you
shouldn't get involved."
Alternately, Stanford students
can campaign for candidates at the
state level, said Natalie Lui, Class of
IW7, the events chair for the Young
Republicans of Silicon Valley.
"A lot of people don't realize
how important it is to vote in the
California election," she added. Lui
has focused on campaigning at the
state level as a volunteer for Steve
Poizner, a Republican candidate to
the State Assembly for the 21st dis
trict. which covers Stanford.
Lui. a self-described moderate
and former delegate to the Republi
can National Convention, said the
State Assembly election addresses
"issues like the Silicon Valley econ
omy and education reform - real
areas which I think touch the lives of

Groups head
to Nevada

people in college."
"I would love to help get out the
vote in swing states, but I can't just
pick up and leave for weeks at a
time," Lui added.
Schwartz said he appreciated the
freedom of being a college student.
"I have the luxury of youth and
privilege to be able to fight fora
cause," he said. "It would be nice, in
an ideal world, if everyone could be
involved."
Alter the election, campus politi
cal groups will refocus their energies
away from active campaigning.
Johnson said Students for Kerry will
"see if there's any reason to stay to
gether as a group." In the case of a
contested election, the group would
stay together, she said.
"The Bush administration has
made people form some pretty
strong opinions and become much
more active." Johnson said. "I think
it will be interesting to see what hap
pens after the election. Will people
keep up with their activism?"
Fairbanks said the current level
of political activism on campus is un
usually high.
"It's probably going to die off
after the election," he said.
I lowever. Students for Bush "will
still exist as a group... to defend
| Bush's] policies and remain commit
ted to the truth," Fairbanks added.
Mutton said the effects of this
campaign will be ongoing.
"Once you get really excited
about an election, you realize it's not
just a one-time thing - the issues, the
process, all those things are impor
tant after the election."
Regardless of the Election Day
outcome, Schwartz said he will re
turn to Stanford next quarter. "I
miss school," he said.
Some Stanford students are passing up dorm trips
and beach excursions this quarter and instead are
choosing to escape the bubble by traveling to swing
states.
Both liberal and conservative student groups are
planning campaign trips to Reno and Las Vegas in the
days leading up to the election. According to a poll
taken between Oct. 1 and Oct. 3 by Survey USA. Pres
ident George W. Bush leads Sen. John Kerry by 4 per
cent in Nevada.
