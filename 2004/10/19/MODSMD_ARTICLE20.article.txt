### ANNMARY MATTHEW THE DARTMOUTH INDEPENDENT (DARTMOUTH COLLEGE 
(U-WIRE) HANOVER, NIL -
Minorities dominate the highly
sought-aTter senior interviewer po
sitions in Dartmouth College's Ad
missions Offiee, as eight out of the
15 posts this term are composed of
students of color.
9 This figure is disproportionate to
the racial composition of the entire
Dartmouth population and may be
disconcerting to some students, es
pecially among those interested in
applying for the competitive posi
tions.
Senior interviewers are responsi
ble for meeting with prospective
Dartmouth students on campus and
are well-compensated for their ser
vices.
However, according to Assistant
Director of Admissions Beth
Onofry, who coordinates the hiring
process for senior interviewers, the
large number of minorities does not
misrepresent the racial composition
of the student body to potential
Dartmouth students.

"There would never be a time
when potential students would en
counter the entire range of inter
viewers at one time," Onofry said.
Onofry confirmed that racial
background is one factor used in the
selection of senior interviewers, but
she noted that the Admissions Of
fice evaluates applicants on many
facets of their Dartmouth experi
ence, including research, study
abroad experience and participa
tion in campus organizations.
Interviewers should be "articu
late. comfortable in an interview
setting, able to pull out helpful in
formation and analytical and ask
good questions." Onofry said.
The selection criteria for senior
interviewers arc analogous to the se
lection criteria for undergraduate
applicants to the college and other
positions on the admissions staff,
such as tour guides.
Onofry said that it is not official
policy to preference minorities in
the hiring process, but that "it's part
of the philosophy of (the Admis
sions Office), whether it be under
graduate recruitment... or filling po
sitions in the office to try to get word

out to different communities on
campus."
In addition to sending out a gen
eral information letter to all stu
dents, Onofry affirmed that "the of
fice tries to connect with deans and
advisers of students of minority
backgrounds."
The office also sometimes sends
staff members to recruit interview
ers at cultural organization meet
ings. but "in the scheme of things it's
miniscule in terms of recruiting."
Onofry said.
Brian Sylvester, '05. a senior in
terviewer and president of the
African American Society, cited
one occasion in which an Admis
sions Office representative came to
speak at one of the organization's
meeting.
According to Sylvester, "(they
were) trying to get a lot of black stu
dents to apply."
"This would all happen within a
limited time frame," Onofry said,
"It's very hit and miss.... There is no
way we could go around and speak
to every organization on campus."
"It's important to us to continue
to do more with communities of

people of color," Onofry said.
She added that the office likes to
hire students with a wide variety of
experiences.
"(But) it never comes down to
the point where we would choose a
black student over a white student."
Onofry said.
"Basically I think they're just
looking fora good representation of
interests on campus," Sylvester said.
"There might be four black se
nior interviewers, but we're all com
pletely different — different majors,
different off-campus experiences, et
cetera."
The senior interviewer positions
are full-time, paid positions in the
summer and part-time positions in
the fall.
Potential senior interviewers
must first submit a paper applica
tion. Those who are called back go
through two sets of interviews with
two interviewers for each interview.
According to senior interviewer
Mitzi Huang, a senior, the job is "re
ally fun. You get to meet a lot of stu
dents, and you have some really
good conversations."
