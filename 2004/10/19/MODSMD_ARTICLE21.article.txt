# At U. Illinois, underage drinking persists despite monetary penalties
## 
### COURTNEY KLEMM DAILY ILLINI (U. ILLINOIS 
(U-WIRE) CHAMPAIGN, 111. -
Like many other University of Illi
nois students, Travis Algren, a
sophomore, spent some time before
the start of the fall semester drink
ing.
Algren was at a party at his fra
ternity's senior house when he said
he noticed the crowd was growing
and getting out of hand.
"People were spilling into the
streets," he said. "I saw a couple of
cops come running and asking peo
ple for IDs."
Algren said he began walking to
ward the back of the house and set
down his beer when a Champaign,
111., police officer saw him and yelled
at him to come over to her. After
asking for his ID and sniffing his cup,
the officer ticketed him $280. the
fine for underage drinking in Cham
paign.
But the ticket didn't stop Algren.
"As soon as I saw the cop car
leave, I started drinking again," he
said. "I knew they were done with
their business for the night and I
wanted to get drunk."
Cases like Algren's lead some to
question the effectiveness of under
age drinking tickets.
According to a November 2002
article in the Journal of American
College Health. 77.4 percent of un
derage college students drank alco
hol in 2001 and 40 percent engaged
in binge drinking.
Champaign Police Sergeant Scott
Freidlein said he estimates between
550 to 600 underage drinking tickets
have been issued since the beginning
of the calendar year.
Champaign has a pay-by-mail
system instead of a trial and convic
tion process. In the pay-by-mail sys
tem, a paid ticket serves as a settle
ment. In Urbana, 111., a comparable
ticket costs $135.
"Any licensed establishment is
subjected to bar checks based on
random selection," Friedlein said.
"Then, based on performance dur
ing those checks, additional inspec
tions may be made."
Katina Castro-Massey, a junior in
applied life studies, works as a bar
tender at Gully's tavern in Cham

paign. She said she feels underage
drinking is prevalent at the universi
ty.
"I've gotten used to it because it
is so common," she said.
Most bars distinguish those over
21 with wristbands or stamps, but
customers will often buy drinks for
their underage friends or bartenders
won't bother checking IDs.
Castro-Massey said the disregard
for underage consumption rules is
even worse at fraternity and apart
ment parties.
"I've never heard of any real reg
ulations at house parties, except for
the signs saying those under 21
aren't allowed to drink. But no one
takes those seriously," she said. "At
fi at parties, pretty much anyone can
get in. The bars are stricter because
you actually have to show an ID."
Regulations in both bars and at
house parties are so lax that many
times getting caught by the police is
based purely on chance. Because of
this, many students feel that tickets
are not effective in curbing underage
drinking.
"Picking a couple people out of a
crowd doesn't really target everyone
and people still come to the bars and
drink even after they get ticketed,"
Castro-Massey said. "It's just an ex
pensive slap on the wrist."
Algren agreed.
"I knew (getting my ticket) was
all chance and probably won't hap
pen again," he said. "I don't think
anyone who's a regular drinker
would really drink less often. Get
ting a ticket once isn't going to make
people have less of a social life."
But there might not be many alter
natives to current methods used to
stop underage drinking.
"There are many programs out
there, but you have to have a certain
amount of leverage," Freidlein said.
He said he felt no matter what
program was chosen to control un
derage drinking, the driving power
of the program was the enforcement
of the rules.
Algren. however, said he felt ef
forts to end underage drinking were
futile.
"I think underage drinking will
happen regardless." he said. "In fact,
having less money has now forced
me to buy cheaper, stronger drinks
so I get drunk faster."
