## Gould makes big changes for tennis squads 
### NICK PARKER 
Last November when Dick Gould,
class of '59, announced he would stop
coaching the men's tennis team after
the 2003-04 season, most people
thought he was leaving the University
for good.
However, as Stanford's first-ever
Director of Tennis, Gould has barely
let up in his duties to the program he
led to 17 national team titles from
1967-2003.
Throughout last year, Gould
worked with the Athletic Department
to create a job that the former coach
felt was necessary to the future suc
cess of Stanford tennis â€” Director of
Tennis.
Gould asked for the job because he
wanted to stay involved in the Univer
sity's tennis program, but he did not
want the time commitment that came
with coaching.
"I didn't want to retire, but 1 want
ed to stop coaching," Gould said.
"After 37 years of coaching, 1 was get
ting tired of all the traveling and stress

that conies with that position."
While Gould is less active in the
day-to-day activities of the teams
themselves, in his new position, he is
still as heavily involved in all other as
pects of the program as he was when
he was the squad's head coach.
"As Director of Tennis, I am cur
rently doing everything I was doing
before without the coaching," Gould
said. "The tennis program here is
growing and growing, and it was be
coming impossible for me to coach,
fundraise and recruit all at the same
time."
"Now I can concentrate on more of
the behind-the-scenes work that is in
tegral to the success of Stanford ten
nis."
Gould's job as head coach was so
difficult partially because of a funda
mental difference between the tennis
program at Stanford and many other
sports at the university.
"Most sports at Stanford have in
house marketing programs that han
dle the fundraising and public rela
tions for the teams," Gould explained.

"Tennis, however, did not have such a
program.
"I felt that our teams needed simi
lar help, so 1 asked for my current po
sition to be created."
As Director of Tennis, Gould now
handles the majority of the fundrais
ing for both men's and women's ten
nis. He also is heavily involved in pro
moting the team's matches and in re
cruiting.
"My immediate priority is to estab
lish a booster club, something that al
most every other Stanford sport has,"
Gould said. "1 want to create two sec
tions of the club: one for students and
one for adults.
"The student booster club will
focus mainly on raising support for
and interest in the program, while the
adult club will concentrate on
fundraising."
This ambitious promotional cam
paign would be a first in the history of
Stanford tennis, Gould explained.
Unquestionably, Gould's biggest
accomplishment so far in his new posi
tion was securing for Stanford the

first-ever combined men's and
women's NCAA Championships site
for 2006.
Never before have both the men's
and women's tournaments been held
at the same location, and Gould is the
primary reason that Stanford is the in
augural host for the special event.
"I'm very excited for the
NCAA's," he said. "I never wanted to
host them while I was coaching be
cause 1 knew it would have been too
complicated, but now that I've
stopped coaching, I can just sit back
and enjoy what promises to be a great
tournament."
Despite his optimism, Gould
knows the pressure that comes with
hosting the tournament will be in
tense and that the expectations will be
high.
"It's going to take a tremendous
amount of time and effort to produce
the NCAA's the way we've envi
sioned," Gould confessed. "In raising
the money to complete [the Taube

preparing for these Championships
fora while now, and we have all the
faith in the world that they will run
smoothly."
Looking beyond the 2(M)6 NCAA
Championships, Gould has high
hopes for the future of Stanford ten
nis.
"We've won 31 national champi

onships in 32 years," Gould said. "In
the world of college athletics, that is
unheard of. Most schools would kill
for one of those championships in
any sport, let alone that many in a
single sport."
Gould talked about not only sus
taining, but also improving on the
program of excellence that Stanford
tennis is known for.

"Winning an NCAA champi
onship is the easy part," Gould said.
"The hard part is continuing to
excel."
"My ultimate goal is to keep
Stanford tennis at the highest level
in the country," Gould said. "We've
proven we're one of the best, and we
definitely want to stay at the top."
