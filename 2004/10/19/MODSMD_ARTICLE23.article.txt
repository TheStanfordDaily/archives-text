# Soto Tape Chronicles
## Football's dream catchers let Jordi sleep soundly 
### 
Sometimes at night when I'm having
trouble falling asleep, I have night
mares about the 2001 Stanford vs.
Washington State football game.
As an impressionable freshman coming
from the Midwest steeped in Big Ten foot
ball tradition, 1 was awed by our football
team. Randy Fasani moved the ball up and
down the field with incredible ease. We
scored 51 points against Arizona State dur
ing Orientation, more than I had ever seen
in a"three yards and a cloud of dust" Michi
gan game. We cruised to a 3-0 start and I
could practically smell the roses. But in

mid-October three years
ago at Stanford Stadium,
the Cougars wiped away
my undefeated fairy tale,
45-39.
I am tormented by
dropped passes and blown
coverages. I see my hopes
of an undefeated Rose
Bowl run disappear. The
Cardinal never advanced
past sixth in the Bowl

Championship Series rankings. I don't
know if I'll ever get to see the Cardinal re
turn to Pasadena. This year might be our
best chance in recent memory. If USC fin
ishes the season unbeaten and plays in the
BCS championship game, the Rose Bowl
could be open to a highly-ranked Pac-10
runner-up.
After Stanford's defeat of Washington
State in Pullman on Saturday, the Cardinal
are tied with four conference opponents at
2-1 behind the high-flying Trojans. To up
the ante, we play all four of those teams —
Oregon, UCLA, Arizona State, and Cal —
in the final five weeks of the season.
The win in Pullman, the Cardinal's first
against the Cougars since 2000, showed
much promise. Stanford took care of the
ball and produced a plus-three turnover dif
ferential. The linebacker corps waltzed into
the Cougar backfield time and time again,
bringing destruction and ruin to the well
laid plans of quarterback Josh Swogger. The
entire defense stonewalled the home side
twice from inside the 5-yard line.
Offensively, Trent Edwards was nearly
perfect. Disregarding one interception, he
made great reads and used his athleticism to
run for several first downs. Buddy Teevens
pulled out all the stops in the playbook, in
cluding a double-reverse flea-flicker, a 67-
yard touchdown bomb, and a halfback pass
that set up the first score.
But there are still areas that need im
provement. Namely, Stanford needs to
maintain its intensity through all four quar
ters. TV cameras love to show coaches and
players holding up four fingers as the clock
runs out in the third quarter and the net
works head to commercial breaks. The sym
bolic gesture is intended to induce strong
play in the final period. That hasn't quite
been the case with Stanford.
In the four games since USC came to
town, opponents have outscored Stanford
40-3 in the final 15 minutes of games. Notre
Dame and USC both came from behind to
win in the final frame. Wazzou rattled off 14
unanswered points to make it close after
Evan Moore's long touchdown reception
seemingly put the game out of reach. If
Stanford wants to win during the tough
stretch of games ahead, they need to put op
ponents away when they have the chance.
The Cardinal could learn a lesson from
the Pittsburgh Steelers. There are already
some eerie similarities between the teams.


Jordi Wlata-Fink
The Steelers are named after an
industry established by 19th centu
ry industrialists like Leland Stan
ford. Both teams are led by young
quarterbacks (Ben Rothlesberger
and Trent Edwards) trying to es
tablish themselves as heirs to long
ago Super Bowl MVPs (Terry
Bradshaw and John Elway).
The Steelers are 5-1 and finally
playing well after several lean
years, but have upcoming games
against two of the toughest teams
in the league. Sound familiar?
Sunday afternoon, the Steelers
went south, deep into the heart of
Texas, to play a familiar foe, the

Dallas Cowboys, against whom
they had not won in many years.
Much like Stanford in Pullman,
the Steelers came away with a vic
tory, but they did it in impressive
come-from-behind fashion. Trail
ing by ten in the closing minutes,
the Steelers rolled off 14 late
points, thanks to Roethlisberger's
surprising poise and Vinny Tes
taverde's opportune fumble.
If Stanford can learn to close
the door on opponents, there are
not many teams that can beat us. If
Trent Edwards can keep up his Big
Ben-like performances, the of
fense will move the ball like we did

Stanford's fourth-quarter
play must improve

in 2001.
Congratulations, guys. With the
toughest stretch of football ahead,
you have helped me lay my Wash
ington State demons to rest. Now
onto the Rose Bowl.

Jordi Mata-Fink is a senior who
will be really angry if the Cardi
nal's Rose Bowl season comes the
year after he graduates. E-mail him
some reassurance at jordimf@stan

in the final five weeks of the season.
The win in Pullman, the Cardinal's first
against the Cougars since 2000, showed
much promise. Stanford took care of the
ball and produced a plus-three turnover dif
ferential. The linebacker corps waltzed into
the Cougar backfield time and time again,
bringing destruction and ruin to the well
laid plans of quarterback Josh Swogger. The
entire defense stonewalled the home side
twice from inside the 5-yard line.
Offensively, Trent Edwards was nearly
perfect. Disregarding one interception, he
made great reads and used his athleticism to
run for several first downs. Buddy Teevens
pulled out all the stops in the playbook, in
cluding a double-reverse flea-flicker, a 67-
yard touchdown bomb, and a halfback pass
that set up the first score.
But there are still areas that need im
provement. Namely, Stanford needs to
maintain its intensity through all four quar
ters. TV cameras love to show coaches and
players holding up four fingers as the clock
runs out in the third quarter and the net
works head to commercial breaks. The sym
bolic gesture is intended to induce strong
play in the final period. That hasn't quite
been the case with Stanford.
In the four games since USC came to
town, opponents have outscored Stanford
40-3 in the final 15 minutes of games. Notre
Dame and USC both came from behind to
win in the final frame. Wazzou rattled off 14
unanswered points to make it close after
Evan Moore's long touchdown reception
seemingly put the game out of reach. If
Stanford wants to win during the tough
stretch of games ahead, they need to put op
ponents away when they have the chance.
The Cardinal could learn a lesson from
the Pittsburgh Steelers. There are already
some eerie similarities between the teams.

The Steelers are named after an
industry established by 19th centu
ry industrialists like Leland Stan
ford. Both teams are led by young
quarterbacks (Ben Rothlesberger
and Trent Edwards) trying to es
tablish themselves as heirs to long
ago Super Bowl MVPs (Terry
Bradshaw and John Elway).
The Steelers are 5-1 and finally
playing well after several lean
years, but have upcoming games
against two of the toughest teams
in the league. Sound familiar?
Sunday afternoon, the Steelers
went south, deep into the heart of
Texas, to play a familiar foe, the

Dallas Cowboys, against whom
they had not won in many years.
Much like Stanford in Pullman,
the Steelers came away with a vic
tory, but they did it in impressive
come-from-behind fashion. Trail
ing by ten in the closing minutes,
the Steelers rolled off 14 late
points, thanks to Roethlisberger's
surprising poise and Vinny Tes
taverde's opportune fumble.
If Stanford can learn to close
the door on opponents, there are
not many teams that can beat us. If
Trent Edwards can keep up his Big
Ben-like performances, the of
fense will move the ball like we did

Stanford's fourth-quarter
play must improve

in 2001.
Congratulations, guys. With the
toughest stretch of football ahead,
you have helped me lay my Wash
ington State demons to rest. Now
onto the Rose Bowl.

Sometimes at night when I'm having
trouble falling asleep, I have night
mares about the 2001 Stanford vs.
Washington State football game.
As an impressionable freshman coming
from the Midwest steeped in Big Ten foot
ball tradition, 1 was awed by our football
team. Randy Fasani moved the ball up and
down the field with incredible ease. We
scored 51 points against Arizona State dur
ing Orientation, more than I had ever seen
in a"three yards and a cloud of dust" Michi
gan game. We cruised to a 3-0 start and I
could practically smell the roses. But in

mid-October three years
ago at Stanford Stadium,
the Cougars wiped away
my undefeated fairy tale,
45-39.
I am tormented by
dropped passes and blown
coverages. I see my hopes
of an undefeated Rose
Bowl run disappear. The
Cardinal never advanced
past sixth in the Bowl

Championship Series rankings. I don't
know if I'll ever get to see the Cardinal re
turn to Pasadena. This year might be our
best chance in recent memory. If USC fin
ishes the season unbeaten and plays in the
BCS championship game, the Rose Bowl
could be open to a highly-ranked Pac-10
runner-up.
After Stanford's defeat of Washington
State in Pullman on Saturday, the Cardinal
are tied with four conference opponents at
2-1 behind the high-flying Trojans. To up
the ante, we play all four of those teams —
Oregon, UCLA, Arizona State, and Cal —
in the final five weeks of the season.
