# Card top field again
## Hall and Craig take home first-place honors at Pre-NCAAs 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford cross country teams posted a repeat of
double victories this weekend in Terre Haute, Ind. After
winning both the men's and women's divisions at the
Notre Dame Invitational last weekend, the Cardinal out
ran the field at the Pre-NCAA meet held at Indiana State
University on Saturday.
Seniors Ryan Hall and Alicia Craig led the No. 2 men
and the No. 1 women, finishing in first place in their re
spective races. Stanford not only came out on top individ
ually but also managed to distance itself from other
schools in terms of scoring. It was a performance that
men's head coach Andy Gerard said surpassed the show
ing at Notre Dame.
"The Notre Dame meet reminded the guys of the phys
ical and mental intensity that comes with racing," Gerard
said. "At Notre Dame, we didn't handle that intensity as
well as we could have, but we learned from it and applied
it this [week]."
This weekend, the Irish were still close on Cardinal
heels, but it wasn't enough to claim revenge. The men
posted 77 points, placing them 88 points ahead of the Irish.
The women also handily defeated Notre Dame, finishing
62 points ahead of the second-place Irish.
The men competed in the 8,000-meter race while the
women competed in the 6,(XX)-meter course this weekend
in the most competitive race of the regular season. While
Notre Dame brought home twin second places. BYU also
made a strong showing, placing 4th in the men's race and
sth in the women's.
In 2003, the Cardinal men placed six runners in the top
nine at Pre-NCAAs. While the team could not repeat last
year's performance, three runners finished in the top ten.
Hall finished in 23 minutes, 54.4 seconds, with a 5k split of
15:02. In addition to Hall, redshirt freshman Nef Araia
placed fifth and redshirt sophomore Jake Gomez rounded
out the top ten with a time of 24:09.4.
"We were able to relax through the early stages of the
race better than at Notre Dame and then we were able to
close in the later stages of the race much better as a result."
Gerard said.
Of the six Cardinal runners who finished in the top nine

last year at pre-NCAAs. Hall is the lone returner. Though
he improved in the standings from his second-place finish
in 2003, his time increased by approximately 43 seconds.
The difference could be attributed to the fact that Hall has
not raced since May or the presence of strong headwinds
at Saturday's race.
"I felt very thankful to be able to race again," Hall said.
"With the demanding training that goes into distance run
ning, you never know what race may be your last. It felt
great to travel again and help usher in a new class of run
ners."
Hall overcame Gerard's concerns that he might be "a
bit rusty" in his debut race of the season.
"He was able to be really relaxed and controlled
through the early stages of the race and easily moved away
from the rest of the racers when he wanted," Gerard said.
"It was a nice confidence builder for him to do what he did,
even not having raced since last May. It was a good con
firmation of his fitness at this stage."
The women also displayed their fitness in a plan to stay
with the pack in the early stages of the race. The tactic
helped Craig avoid the fatigue caused by facing strong
winds alone.
Women's head coach Dena Evans knew that the windy
conditions would not allow a particularly fast time.
"We decided to adopt a more conservative strategy,"
she said. "Craig was able to get the place we needed even
with a somewhat modest time."
Craig's victory helped her gauge her abilities for up
coming races.
"The pace was slower than I would have liked it to be,
but I felt relaxed and in control throughout the whole
race," Craig said. "It was encouraging to know that I can
probably pick up the pace in future races if necessary."
The eight-time All-American completed the race in
20:20.4 with senior Anita Siraki and sophomore Katy
Trotter close behind. Siraki placed sixth, finishing approx
imately 22 seconds after Craig, and Trotter placed eighth.
"Switching the lineup a little bit allowed for some addi
tional meaningful opportunities for some new people to
step up and do a good job," Evans said. "One of the things
I was really pleased with was the composure of our women
out there and that they seemed really alert and responsive
throughout the race."
Evans was also proud of the younger members of her
squad. Redshirt freshman Julie Allen and freshman Lind-
