# Women's golf places fifth at Stanford's Pepsi Intercollegiate
## 
### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
They didn't win. They didn't even finish in
the top three. Yet when the Stanford women's
golf team finished fifth at the Stanford Pepsi
Intercollegiate this weekend, it represented
an achievement as important as any autumn
victory.
Junior Stephanie Lue, who has suffered
from a degenerative back injury since her
freshman year, was recently diagnosed with a
stress fracture that will sideline her for an in
determinate amount of time. The injury
shrinks the Cardinal roster to five, the mini
mum number of players required for NCAA
play.
Despite the setback, Stanford received
strong performances from all five spots in the
lineup in a team effort against a highly com
petitive field.
Meanwhile, No. 9 Arizona State's victory
meant the Sun Devils continue to challenge
No. 3 UCLA for its position as the dominant
team in the Pacific-10 Conference. Arizona
State barely led throughout the event before
claiming its second consecutive victory, nar
rowly withstanding a furious charge by No. 16
Pepperdine on the final day. The individual
title went to Washington State's Anastasia
Kostina, who was five under par and the only
player in the field to break par in all three
rounds.
While it wasn't a disaster, the first day of
play was certainly not what the Cardinal had
hoped for at its home course. Much like the
men's team a week ago, Stanford's women
stumbled to a 15-over-par 295 in their opening
round, dropping back to 10th place overall.
The performance was particularly disap
pointing in light of the perfect scoring condi
tions present for nearly all of Friday's play.
With the sun high in the sky and the flags
hanging limp, some of the best players in the
country took advantage of the Stanford Golf
Course's receptive greens and attacked some
generous hole locations.
The 18-team field, which included seven
teams ranked in the Top 25 as well as strong
unranked squads from Oregon, Arizona and
Washington State, took dead aim at the par-70
layout on the first day.
Stanford, however, rebounded in fine fash
ion on Saturday.
Gone were Friday's benign conditions, and
in their place came blustery afternoon winds
and cooling temperatures. In the face of these
new challenges, the Cardinal played their best
golf of the tournament.
"The team was really focused this week
end." junior Kelly Husted said. "We wanted
to have a good showing at our home tourna
ment. which we did."
Husted backed up her first-round 72 with a
two-under-par 68 on Saturday. On the
strength of some excellent ball striking,
sophomore Lauren Todd bounced back from
a 75 on Friday with a solid second-round 70,
although she was clearly disappointed that it
was not lower.
"On the final two days. I hit the ball as well
as I have ever hit it — consistently inside 15
feet — and I didn't make [any putts]," Todd
said. "Five of the six bogies I had in the final
two rounds were from three-putts."
Sophomore Jenni Tangtiphaiboontana
also played well, shooting 72. Senior Wendra
Liang's 75 rounded out the scoring for the
Cardinal on Saturday.
With its brilliant second-day performance,
Stanford shot up the leader board, passing a
host of nationally ranked opponents to sit in
fifth place overall after 36 holes.
