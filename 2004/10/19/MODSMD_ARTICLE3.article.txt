# Changes to dining plans leave some students confused, annoyed

Changes to Stanford Dining meal
plans this year have caused confu
sion among students about the dif
ferences between Cardinal dollars
and meal points and where they can
be used.
Director of Residential Dining
Susan Nielson said new changes in
student meal plans now allow meal
points to be used at almost all eater
ies on campus. Students who have
"All-You-Care-To-Eat" plans that
include meal points and those on
premium and regular "A la Carte"
plans can use their points at all resi
dence dining halls, as well as the
Late Night options at Stern Cyber
Cafe and Lakeside Dining. A limit
ed portion of those points can also
be used at other eateries, including
Subway, the Stanford Coffee House,
and Peet's Coffee.

"The enhanced meal plans are
popular with students, and every day
we see large numbers of transactions
where students are using their meal
plan points at Stanford Dining retail
locations," Nielson said. "However,
points cannot he used at locations
not operated by Stanford Dining."
The Treehouse and Tresidder
Express are among the eateries that
do not accept points, leading to
some confusion among students.
Employees at Tresidder Express
told The Daily that students often
try to use their meal plan points and
are turned down.
Some students cited poor public
ity about the program as the root of
their uncertainty. Sophomore
Aditya Singh uses his points plan
only sparingly outside the dining
hall.
"I normally use my points at the
CoHo or Late Night, and I've had no
problems," he said. "But 1 didn't

know that I
could use
my points
anywhere
else. 1 just
use Cardi
nal Dollars
elsewhere,
since it's
much easi
er to use
than the
points sys
tem."
Senior
Julia Lee
said that a
brochure
at Man
zanita Din
ing led her
to believe
she could
use her
points at

the CoHo and Tresidder. However,
when she and her drawmates tried to
buy drinks at the CoHo, they were
told they needed Cardinal Dollars.
Confused, she consulted their
dining hall administrator, who insist
ed that she could spend their points
there. Lee learned later that the
points on her "A la Carte Lite" meal
plan are not valid at a number of lo
cations.
"It's false advertising saying we
can use points," she said.
Other changes to the meal plans
include the elimination of a separate
Cardinal points system: all points
are now considered meal plan
points.
"In the past, students were often
confused about which kind of points
they had. and how and where to use
them," Nielson said. "We stream
lined the points to include only meal
plan points, as part of a meal plan,
and Cardinal Dollars, which are pur
chased separately."
Cardinal Dollars, unlike meal
points, must be added to student
identification cards separately and
are valid at more locations, includ
ing Tresidder Express, The Tree
house and the Bookstore.
Other students have also had
technical problems with their cards.
Senior Ellie Martin tried to use her
points and Cardinal Dollars at
Tresidder several times before real
izing there was a problem.
"Apparently old cards like mine
don't work at the scanners at some
places like Peet's [Coffee]." she said.
In the future, Stanford Dining
said it plans to improve the meal
plan system in order to make the
program more user-friendly.
"We are developing information
technology systems that will enable
us to further streamline the points
process." Nielson said.
