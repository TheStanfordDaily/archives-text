## 
### DAVID HERBERT DESK EDITOR 
Students this year have a myriad of new options
when buying tickets to Stanford sporting events.
Among the biggest changes is a new, comprehensive
$ 116 all Axe-cess Pass that gives students season foot
ball tickets, including Big Game, as well as membership
in the Sixth Man Club and access to all other sporting
events. Another package gives students access to all
events except Big Game for $99. Students can also pur
chase $35 season football passes that include a seat at
Big Game.
Student feedback for the program has been mixed so
far. Some, like senior Josh Seifert, are pleased with the
convenience and price of the new all Axe-cess Pass.
"I was definitely going to get Sixth Man. and 1 want-

Ed the football and Big Game tickets and I like the idea
of going to other sports games," he said. "It's nice that
it is cheaper this year."
Despite the price decrease, some students are still
not convinced that the pass is worth its three-digit price
tag.
"1 feel that the maximum number of sporting events
I would be able to attend would not be worth the money
they charge," said sophomore George Kwon.
Some students, regardless of price or interest, say
they are just too busy to attend sporting events.
"I would love to see a lot of games, but playing on a
team myself, I don't have much time," said senior Chris
Fesenmaier. who plays on the club squash team.
The deadline to order all Axe-cess passes is tomor
row. Passes can be purchased online at tickets.gostan
