1972 — On Oct. 19, The Daily ran
a story about Presidential Coun
selor Robert Finch discussing his
disapproval of the Watergate bug
ging incident. Below is an excerpt:
The Watergate bugging incident
was 'immoral, it was unjustified, it
was stupid,' and the individuals in
volved acted 'without authority,'
according to Presidential Counsel
lor Robert Finch.
Speaking on a variety of topics
to a crowd of 400 on the University
of Santa Clara campus last night.
Finch, a former Lieutenant Gover
nor of California, said that those re
sponsible 'should and will be
nailed.' Concerning other so-called
scandals 'marring' the Nixon ad
ministration, Finch explained.
'There has been no impropriety to
my knowledge. We can't accept
them as fact because somebody said
that they happened.'
Although admitting that 'it has
not really been a campaign that has
been outstanding on the clear delin
eation of the issues,' Finch defend
ed President Nixon's decision not
to debate the Democratic Presiden
tial nominee, Sen. George McGov
ern.
Calling the present campaign
'one of the most sensitive periods
that you will know in your lifetime,'
Finch urged his audience to com
pare the candidates carefully, espe
cially in the area of foreign policy.
Finch stressed his belief that
Nixon has an edge in the latter area,
citing the President's 'initiatives'
with China and the Soviet Union,
and the so-called 'Nixon Doctrine,'

that the United States can no longer
be a 'world policeman.'
19H7 — On Oct. 19, The Daily ran a
story about doctors calling drug tests
"adequate."
A former medical specialist for
the U.S. Olympic Committee was
one of two expert witnesses to testi
fy in support of the NCAA's colle
giate drug-testing program Friday.
Dr. Robert Voy was the first
medical expert called by the NCAA
in its Santa Clara County Superior
Court battle against Stanford se
niors Barry McKeever and Jennifer
Hill, who are seeking a restraining
order against the NCAA's drug
testing policy. The University is act
ing as a third party supporting Mc-
Keever and Hill.
Although he did not specify any
particular school or sport, football
ranked as the sport in which drugs
were most abused, according to
1985 NCAA statistics presented at
the hearings Tuesday.
Of the 34 NCAA athletes dis
qualified because of positive drug
tests in that year, Voy said 31 were
football players. Most of the ath
letes who were disqualified tested
positive for presence of anabolic
steroids in their urine.
Voy, who headed the medical
team for the U.S. Olympic Commit
tee at the 1984 Sarajevo Winter
Olympics, played an integral part in
developing the drug-testing pro
gram implemented by the Interna
tional Olympic Committee.
