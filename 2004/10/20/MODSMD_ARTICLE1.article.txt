# ASSU bills on MEChA, picketing
## 
### NICK PARKER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate was sharply divided last night as
senators debated a bill condemning
last year's "vicious attack" on
MEChA by The Stanford Review.
The bill, proposed by sophomore
Senator Omar Shakir, would also re
quire the ASSU to "commit to
strongly and quickly supporting eth
nic groups in the event of potential
future attacks."
The Review had compared
MEChA, the oldest Chicano/ Lati
no organization on campus, to the
Ku Klux Klan in an article published
in October of last year, calling it"a
racist organization that advocates
revolution and segregation."
Also discussed at the meeting
was whether the Stanford Labor Ac
tions Coalition should receive fund
ing for picket signs that would be
used both on campus and in San
Francisco to protest what the group
views as unfair treatment of work
ers.
But much of the meeting was fo
cused on Shakir's proposed bill.
Shakir, the Senate advocacy
chair, told the Senate that he felt it
was necessary for the ASSU to criti
cize The Review and also to back all
of Stanford's ethnic groups.
"It would be a good idea for us, as
a Senate, to take a stand in support
of ethnic groups on campus," Shakir
said. "We want to condemn The Re
view's attack and let Stanford's eth
nic groups know that we are here to
support them if they apply fora spe
cial fees refund or in the event of po
tential future attacks."
"We also need to make it clear
that we support an absolute right to
free speech, but that we feel The Re
view's attack was unfair."
In addition, Shakir recommend
ed that the ASSU send a letter of
support to each ethnic group on
campus.
Shakir's proposed bill drew
mixed reactions in the Senate.
While some senators agreed with his
viewpoint, others felt that explicitly
blaming and attacking The Review
was not a good idea.
Senator Chris Nguyen, administra
tion and rules chair, was the most
vocal in his opposition to the clause
in the bill that attacks The Review.
"This bill is explicitly supporting
ethnic diversity but implicitly con
demning ideological diversity," said
Nguyen, a sophomore. "I don't un
derstand how we can possibly distin
guish between the two and still be fair."
"Also, I think we're opening our
selves up to a potential lawsuit for libel
if we specifically condemn The Review
in a bill," Nguyen continued.
Other senators who opposed the
controversial clause in Shakir's bill
were Publications Director Matt
Henick, a senior, and Senator Adrian
Boscolo-Hightower, a junior.
"Systematic attacks against campus
groups such as The Review are very
problematic," Boscolo-Hightower
said.
Henick added. "While I understand
the concern behind this bill, I think this
is the totally wrong avenue to pursue
this."
The Senate will vote on Shakir's bill
at its meeting next Tuesday.
There was more disagreement in

Senators vote to
fund picket signs

the Senate regarding the distribution
of funding to the Stanford Labor Ac
tions Coalition that would be used to
protest alleged maltreatment of
workers.
While the majority of senators
voted to give money to the coalition to
subsidize picket signs for the protests,
there were a few members who dis
agreed with the decision.
Among them was Nguyen, who ar
gued that the Senate's actions could be
construed as partisan.
"By funding a picket sign, we're ba
sically funding a political protest, and I
don't think we should be doing that,"
Nguyen explained.
"It seems that we're funding a protest
as opposed to an educational cam
paign, and I think we need to make a
distinction."
