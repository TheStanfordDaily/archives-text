1967 — On Oct. 20, 1967, The Daily
ran a story on Durand turning all
male.

"To the 31 sophomore men in
Durand House, an emergency hous
ing solution may have resulted in an
extremely valuable addition to
men's on-campus residential oppor
tunities. The men were put in Du
rand at the end of the summer be
cause no other housing was avail
able.
'An unexpected lack of attrition
from Stern this summer left 69
sophomore men without housing.
Assistant Dean of Students Sally
Mahoney stated.
Decisions to remain overseas,
marriages, and similar occurrences
left Durand with only 14 scheduled
occupants. A resident assistant's
resignation resulted in the decision
to house many of the sophomore
men in Durand.
In the letter sent to these men on
the housing waiting list. Miss Ma
honey stated that the University had
committed itself to the policy for
one year only, expecting Durand to
become a women's residence at the
end of this year.
But the men feel that a valuable
residential situation has been creat
ed and would like the house to re
main a men's dorm.
They cited four basic reasons for
this policy. Their first point is that
the facilities offered in Durand dif
fer greatly from the other indepen
dent men's residences.
it's more like a house than a
dorm,' stated Pete Hansen, resident
assistant at Durand."

1999 - On October 20, 1999, The
Daily ran a story on changes to the
Stanford application.

'Before leaving their homes be
hind, students hoping to attend
Stanford beginning in the year 2000
will be asked to take a look back and
reflect on what has made them who
they are. Two new essay questions
on the undergraduate application
focus on students' background and
sense of tradition.
Prospective students choose be
tween two questions. The first
question asks applicants to consid
er how the place in which they live
has influenced them. The second
asks students to explain a tradition
which is currently a part of their
lives or a tradition they would like
to create.
i think they're good questions
but they seem to be a bit exclusive,'
said freshman Jon Glassman. Glass
man said he thought students who
have a background that is not rich in
tradition could be alienated by a
question that centers on tradition as
an integral part of life.
Last year, applicants were asked
to either attach and explain a small
photograph of an object of person
al importance or reflect on he sub
ject of a book they would like to
write.
According to Robert Kinnally,
dean of Admissions, the admissions
staff made the changes to stimulate
deep thinking in prospective stu
dents."
