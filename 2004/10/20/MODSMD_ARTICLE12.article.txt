# Does this make me look fat?
## 'Women's issues' 
### ANNE FRIEDMAN FEATURES COLUMNIST 
Based on the two sample ar
ticles I submitted when ap
plying to be a Daily colum
nist, the editors suggested
that I write about "women's issues."
Hence the title, "Does this make me
look fat?" 1 never intended to have
that focus, and now I don't know
what to do with it.
My first thought was to do one of
those female-to-male translation
articles, i.e., when she says, "Didn't
you love Kenny Mayne on Sports
center last night?" she means, "It's
early in our relationship and I want
you to think that I'll never ask you
to miss the Niners to have an an
niversary dinner with me ... but I
will."
Then I thought about writing an
article on dating at Stanford, because.

well, that's
never been
done before.
Right.
Maybe I
could talk
about how
boys think
that "You
going to
Theta Delt
on Friday?"
is a good
way to com
municate "I
like you (and

I want to hump your leg)." Or
maybe I could talk about Stanford
girls not putting out. Sweetheart,
why is he going to buy the cow when
he doesn't know how the milk
tastes?
Perhaps I should talk about the
fact that while Vaden offers emer
gency contraception, if a girl gets in
trouble on a Friday night, EC is
much less likely to be effective when
she gets it over 48 hours later on
Monday.Target doesn't carry it.
Many Planned Parenthood offices
are not open on the weekends. Stan
ford needs a place, open all week
end, where a girl can get it without
having to figure out transportation
off-campus.
But are any of these really
"women's issues?" What is a
"woman's issue?" Pregnancy? Eat
ing Disorders? Under representa
tion in politics? The wage gap?
PMS?
Men are involved in all of these
matters either as the father, the ob
ject of desire, the overrepresented
minority, overpaid employee or the
victim of irrational rage. Men are in
volved in women's issues-not at fault
for them, but involved. Every issue
that affects women radiates outward
to shake society as a whole, includ
ing those members with penises.
This false dichotomy between
men and women, this "men are
from Mars and women are from
Venus" rhetoric, only serves to rein
force inane gender roles that dictate
that men can't talk about their feel
ings and women can't do any
thing but.
I know lots of Stanford girls who
put out, say what they mean and
would prefer football to French
restaurants. And they're not sluts. I
know guys who ask girls out on,
**gasp**, REAL DATES, know
the channels for TLC and Lifetime
but not ESPN and know the differ
ence between a mule and a kitten
heel (shoes, for all you guys and girls
who don't). And they're not gay.
Yes, there are differences between
men and women, but stigmatizing
those who don't color cleanly inside
the gender lines hurts everyone.
So how do I write a column on
"women's issues" without falling
into the trap of stereotyping men as
horny buffoons and women as
shopaholic drama queens? How can
I write a column on "women's is
sues" without lending credence to
the idea that there is such a thing?
My plan is to write whatever I
want to write and put "breasts" in
the title so that men think it is for
them too.

Anyone with any better ideas, partic
ularly Y-chromosomes who weren 't
scared off by the column title, please
