# Thefacebook vs. Campus Network...
## Is there room for more than one? 
### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
Given the recent proliferation of online so
cial networks like Friendster and the ever-ex
panding ranks of young people joining up, a
safe assumption might be that these sites play
an integral role in student life.
When asked, however, students who use
these sites consistently list one arguably essen
tial use for these networks: procrastination.
Senior Alicia Dantzker said that she used
thefacebook — the network that is available at
more than 175 colleges nationwide — "for
procrastinating."
"It's a shockingly engaging waste of time."
Nor do students at other schools necessari
ly find better uses for online social networks.
Oberlin senior Nick Arioli said, "1 feel like
I should have something profound to say, as 1
spend a lot of time studying social and political
networks, but I think people just do it out of
boredom."
Given the innumerable procrastination
tools available on the Internet — students
can listen to music, read e-zines or shop —
the fact that more than three-fourths of Stan
ford's undergraduates have signed up with
thefacebook shows that there might be more
to online social networking than just putting
off homework.
This week, a Web site similar to theface
book. called Campus Network, became avail
able at Stanford — raising questions about
whether there is a market for several such on
line communities among college students.
Thefacebook, the leading online network at
Stanford and among college students in gener
al, began at Harvard University but now has
about 500.000 users. The Web site's creator,
Mark Zuckerberg, set out to create an online
database that would encourage social interac
tion at Harvard.
The network that emerged greatly resem
bles other online databases such as Friendster
in that users create personal profiles, find
friends at their school and at others and ex
change messages.
"We started the site at Harvard, not really
thinking that it would go much further than our
school," explained Harvard student Chris
Hughes, who works as "The Press Guy" for
thefacebook.
"After so many people signed up, we real
ized pretty fast that students at other schools
might enjoy using the site .... We want every

student who wants to be a member of theface
book to be able to be a member of theface
book. To that end, we're trying to add as many
colleges as quickly as possible to the network."
Hughes reported no specific plans for the
future of thefacebook apart from continuing
the expansion to new campuses and adding
new features, such as a partnership with a file
sharing network.
Zuckerberg and co-founder Dustin
Moskovitz have stopped out of Harvard for the
semester to work on the Web site, and six peo
ple are currently on the payroll, which is gen
erated by advertisements.
Hughes noted that the Web site itself is not
making a profit, and denied that the team is
motivated by its financial prospects.
"For now at least, we're doing it because it's
fun," Hughes said. "It's nice to see something

you've created be so popular—it gives us ener
gy to keep revising and expanding the site.
Some Stanford students, however, suspect
that money plays a bigger role.
"Maybe not now, but if it keeps spreading
it might be the new Google, and those
[Google] guys are billionaires," said senior
Nicole Marquez, whose comparison is striking
given Zuckerberg and Moskovitz's recent
move to the Bay Area.
While some students regard thefacebook
simply as a distraction from scholastic obliga
tions, others find practical uses for it. This re
porter, for one, has found thefacebook a far
more useful tool for tracking down sources
than Stanford's online directory.
Some have more frivolous ends in mind.
Many students said that they look for other at
tractive and single students on the network.

The creators of Campus Network launched
their Web site at Columbia University during
the summer of 2003, before thefacebook was
created.
Columbia student Wayne Ting, one of the
two designers of Campus Network, distinguish
es it from thefacebook by emphasizing its sub
stantive value.
"Facebook focuses on browsing and adding
friends, but users who are looking for journal
weblogs, to upload their pictures and rate their
professors [will find that) those things aren't
available on facebook," he said.
Columbia student Carrington Lee agreed
that Campus Network offers a more diverse
range of options than thefacebook.
"I use Campus Network like a blog, a photo
album, instant messenger, and bulletin board,"
she said. "I can post journals about the parties
I went to over the weekend, the fact that I have
a stereo for sale, or which songs are on repeat
on my iTunes, and people are always ready to
comment on whatever 1 happen to write."
The question now is whether students at
Stanford and elsewhere will express interest in
another online social network. One indicator
that there might be room for another network
is the prevalence of both thefacebook and
Campus Network at Columbia.
"A lot of people at Columbia use theface
book as well," said Columbia student Eva
Colen. "Thefacebook. however, is completely
different — there is no community whatsoev
er, it's more like a classifieds section.
"You can build relationships and express
your personality on Campus Network, whereas
thefacebook only allows you add friends and
stalk crushes."
Stanford students are generally more skep
tical of Campus Network's potential else
where.
"It's kind of lost its novelty, and I'm not
sure if people will feel like signing up for yet
another network," Dantzker said. "Campus-
Network actually sounds like a much better
idea. Too bad it didn't start here first."
Like thefacebook's creators, Ting claims
that the prospect of financial success has not
been the principal motivating factor, but he
does not rule out the possibility in the future.
"We have a few volunteers and none of us
are getting paid," he said. "We're doing this for
the same reason that we started it initially. It's
an extracurricular hobby.
"If it's a way to make money in the future,
fine. But we're not making money right now."

Mark Zuckerberg, set out to create an online
database that would encourage social interac
tion at Harvard.
The network that emerged greatly resem
bles other online databases such as Friendster
in that users create personal profiles, find
friends at their school and at others and ex
change messages.
"We started the site at Harvard, not really
thinking that it would go much further than our
school," explained Harvard student Chris
Hughes, who works as "The Press Guy" for
thefacebook.
"After so many people signed up, we real
ized pretty fast that students at other schools
might enjoy using the site .... We want every

student who wants to be a member of theface
book to be able to be a member of theface
book. To that end, we're trying to add as many
colleges as quickly as possible to the network."
Hughes reported no specific plans for the
future of thefacebook apart from continuing
the expansion to new campuses and adding
new features, such as a partnership with a file
sharing network.
Zuckerberg and co-founder Dustin
Moskovitz have stopped out of Harvard for the
semester to work on the Web site, and six peo
ple are currently on the payroll, which is gen
erated by advertisements.
Hughes noted that the Web site itself is not
making a profit, and denied that the team is
motivated by its financial prospects.
"For now at least, we're doing it because it's
fun," Hughes said. "It's nice to see something

you've created be so popular—it gives us ener
gy to keep revising and expanding the site.
Some Stanford students, however, suspect
that money plays a bigger role.
"Maybe not now, but if it keeps spreading
it might be the new Google, and those
[Google] guys are billionaires," said senior
Nicole Marquez, whose comparison is striking
given Zuckerberg and Moskovitz's recent
move to the Bay Area.
While some students regard thefacebook
simply as a distraction from scholastic obliga
tions, others find practical uses for it. This re
porter, for one, has found thefacebook a far
more useful tool for tracking down sources
than Stanford's online directory.
Some have more frivolous ends in mind.
Many students said that they look for other at
tractive and single students on the network.

The creators of Campus Network launched
their Web site at Columbia University during
the summer of 2003, before thefacebook was
created.
Columbia student Wayne Ting, one of the
two designers of Campus Network, distinguish
es it from thefacebook by emphasizing its sub
stantive value.
"Facebook focuses on browsing and adding
friends, but users who are looking for journal
weblogs, to upload their pictures and rate their
professors [will find that) those things aren't
available on facebook," he said.
Columbia student Carrington Lee agreed
that Campus Network offers a more diverse
range of options than thefacebook.
"I use Campus Network like a blog, a photo
album, instant messenger, and bulletin board,"
she said. "I can post journals about the parties
I went to over the weekend, the fact that I have
a stereo for sale, or which songs are on repeat
on my iTunes, and people are always ready to
comment on whatever 1 happen to write."
The question now is whether students at
Stanford and elsewhere will express interest in
another online social network. One indicator
that there might be room for another network
is the prevalence of both thefacebook and
Campus Network at Columbia.
"A lot of people at Columbia use theface
book as well," said Columbia student Eva
Colen. "Thefacebook. however, is completely
different — there is no community whatsoev
er, it's more like a classifieds section.
"You can build relationships and express
your personality on Campus Network, whereas
thefacebook only allows you add friends and
stalk crushes."
Stanford students are generally more skep
tical of Campus Network's potential else
where.
"It's kind of lost its novelty, and I'm not
sure if people will feel like signing up for yet
another network," Dantzker said. "Campus-
Network actually sounds like a much better
idea. Too bad it didn't start here first."
Like thefacebook's creators, Ting claims
that the prospect of financial success has not
been the principal motivating factor, but he
does not rule out the possibility in the future.
"We have a few volunteers and none of us
are getting paid," he said. "We're doing this for
the same reason that we started it initially. It's
an extracurricular hobby.
"If it's a way to make money in the future,
fine. But we're not making money right now."

Given the recent proliferation of online so
cial networks like Friendster and the ever-ex
panding ranks of young people joining up, a
safe assumption might be that these sites play
an integral role in student life.
When asked, however, students who use
these sites consistently list one arguably essen
tial use for these networks: procrastination.
Senior Alicia Dantzker said that she used
thefacebook — the network that is available at
more than 175 colleges nationwide — "for
procrastinating."
"It's a shockingly engaging waste of time."
Nor do students at other schools necessari
ly find better uses for online social networks.
Oberlin senior Nick Arioli said, "1 feel like
I should have something profound to say, as 1
spend a lot of time studying social and political
networks, but I think people just do it out of
boredom."
Given the innumerable procrastination
tools available on the Internet — students
can listen to music, read e-zines or shop —
the fact that more than three-fourths of Stan
ford's undergraduates have signed up with
thefacebook shows that there might be more
to online social networking than just putting
off homework.
This week, a Web site similar to theface
book. called Campus Network, became avail
able at Stanford — raising questions about
whether there is a market for several such on
line communities among college students.

al, began at Harvard University but now has
