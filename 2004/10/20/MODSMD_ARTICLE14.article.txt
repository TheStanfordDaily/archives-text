# Pre-business groups proliferate on campus
## 
### MELANIE CORBETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Eight years ago, a handful of Stanford stu
dents looked to its backyard neighbor and
had an idea. The inescapable and far-reach
ing success of Silicon Valley's economy in
spired them to form an entrepreneurship
group that they believed would draw other
young industrialists.
"Stanford has a grand old tradition of really
leading the world where starting companies is
concerned," said sophomore Dimitri Dadiomov,
vice president of marketing for the Business As
sociation of Stanford Engineering Students,
commonly known as BASES, one of the earliest
pre-business groups to form on campus.
"Silicon Valley has been such a success in
large part because of Stanford students and
alumni creating companies from some abstract
ideas and building them into some of the most
influential corporations we have around
today," he said of the organization's original
stimulus.
Almost a decade after this early business
group formed, the trend of preprofessoinal or
ganizations is gaining momentum. Many Stan
ford students eager to jump-start their careers
have signed on.
BASES, for example, has grown from a
small club to an organization with over 4,500
people on its e-mail list. It created and runs an
annual world-class for-profit business plan
competition. Entrepreneur's Challenge, which
last year produced the winner of the global
competition in Singapore.
"Attendance at our Entrepreneurial
Thought Leader speaker series is so high that
Terman Auditorium is overfilled, and people
have to sit on the floor," Dadiomov said .
"I've been told that we're the only organiza
tion that refuses volunteer help ... that, to
me. is high demand."
While Stanford has student organizations
related to a range of careers, like medicine and
law. the growth is most concentrated in the
area of business. Because many people tend to
enter the business world immediately after
graduation, students turn to pre-business
groups for training to enter the field.
One of the newest groups is Stanford Fi
nance, a year-old organization whose mission
is to help students enter and succeed in the fi

nance industry, said senior Mike Asmar, chief
executive officer.
"In addition to normal things like work
shops, training, and events together, every
member gets to do an internship during one
quarter this year with a high-profile bank in the
Bay Area," he said. "They're big names, like
Morgan Stanley, Smith Barney, ÜBS and Rut
berg & Co."
Asmar recognizes the difficulty in entering
the business realm and hopes that his organi
zation will ease the transition for Stanford
hopefuls.
"The idea is that it is really hard to get your
foot in the door in the world of finance, so we
do it for them, and we do it really well," he said.
"It's also pretty scary since most jobs on Wall
Street are intense and high pressured, so we get
them fully prepared for all that."
The group's access to prime jobs is partly pos
sible because one of its advisors is a Managing
Director at Morgan Stanley in New York — "a
serious big-shot," according to Asmar — who
also sits on the Board of Trustees at Stanford.
Additionally, after learning of the group's
goals. Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John Bravman "was so excited that he
gave us $3,000 to help with initial costs,"
Asmar said.
Helping students nab top internships and
jobs is a key goal of most pre-business groups.
Among these is Stanford Consulting, which
trains students in consulting techniques and of
fers them the chance to participate in consult
ing projects for real companies.
"The case-project exposes students to inter
esting strategy and marketing issues at inter
esting client companies," said senior Jonathan
Cheek. President of Stanford Consulting. "The
Stanford Consulting experience gives students
a strong leg up when it comes to finding intern
ships or jobs in a variety of industries."
The fact that Stanford is primarily a liberal
arts institution and does not offer a pre-profes
sional major in business (nor in most other
fields) makes the opportunities provided by
pre-business groups especially important.
"The business education and focus to the
Stanford community of Alpha Kappa Psi is es
pecially important at a university that does not
have a specific undergraduate business pro
gram," said junior Justin Carl, vice president of
external relations for the co-ed business frater

nity Alpha Kappa Psi.
Having the option to join career-oriented
organizations can also benefit undergraduates
by eliminating the need to select a major di
rectly related to ope's future career.
"I think that many Stanford students in
many majors have both a short-term interest in
their major and a long-term career interest for
which their major has varying degrees of appli
cability," said Kathy Eisenhardt, professor in
the department of Management Science and

Engineering.
Elisabeth Pat£-Cornell, chair of the depart
ment of management science and engineering,
explained that while the major includes some
students with plans to enter the business world,
it is not pre-professional in nature.
"Although some of the engineering stu
dents wish to enter the business world, for ex

ample, to create their own company, the de
partment addresses a much larger group of stu
dents," she said.
Sally Metzer, an academic advisor at the
Undergraduate Advising Center, does not see
a concentration of students selecting majors
based on careers. She believes that following
one's personal and present interests yields the
best results.
"In terms of major selection, it really
varies," she said. "My own opinion is if one is

true to oneself in a major selection, it sets a
good standard for an authentic choice of a ca
reer. whatever that may be."
Dadiomov said. "At the end of the day.it
really is not about getting a job right after col
lege. It's about starting the next Apple, the
next Microsoft, the next Stanford startup that
changes the world."
