## Editorial ASSU must improve communication 
### 
Last week, the ASSU announced a bill re
quiring student groups to have an amount
equal to 20 percent of their annual special
fees funding withheld. The bill passed to
ensure that student groups do not exceed their bud
get.
Although the bill is a prudent proposal that
makes sense in principle, the ASSU failed to prop
erly alert student groups about the new require
ment. It is unrealistic to expect all groups to be able
to conform to the measure on such short notice, and
the ASSU should take special care to accommodate
those groups that are especially inconvenienced by
the bill.
It is important to note that the new legislation
should not prove to be a burden for most student
groups. The majority have enough money in their bud
getary reserves — unspent funds from previous spe
cial-fees cycles — that they can set aside the 20 per
cent without having to dip into special-fees funds for
the current fiscal year.
But 13 special-fees groups do not have enough in
their reserves to cover the withholding obligation. As
a result, these 13 groups will have to set aside portions
of their current-year special-fees funding in order to
meet the requirement.
The ASSU is on the right track in seeking to ensure
that a group does not spend all of its special-fees lunds
without first setting aside some money in the event
that the group's refunds are higher than the buffer sys
tem can absorb.
As the editorial board advocated last spring, indi
vidual groups must be held directly accountable for
their respective refund rates. Otherwise, refunds
have no real effect on groups, and students might
even be motivated to pull their money out of the sys
tem, content with the knowledge that it will result in
no actual loss of funds for the groups they support.
This new ASSU bill is another step toward restoring
group accountability for refunds. Thus, we support it
in this respect.
But, we take issue with the ASSU's approach in
implementing this new policy. Most student groups
affected by the changes were unaware of them until

last Friday. Understandably, many were disap
pointed to hear that portions of their special-fees
budgets would not be available this quarter. This
might have amounted to little more than a minor ir
ritation for most groups, but if a group was planning
to spend the majority of its special fees in autumn
quarter, it found itself in an unexpectedly tight fi
nancial situation.
The Stanford Concert Network, for example,
needs all of its special-fees funds by the beginning of
the year in order to bring expensive artists to cam
pus to perform for the Stanford community. A rep
resentative from the ASSU said that the ASSU will
be working with SCN to ensure that they can still
book artists. We are encouraged that the ASSU is
accommodating those it inconveniences, and it must
be certain to make such efforts to help out any other
groups in similar situations.
According to the ASSU bylaws, the ASSU is only
required to make a minimum of 33 percent of a
group's special-fees funding for the year available
each quarter. Thus, the withholding as laid out by the
recent bill is indeed legal, and easily meets the bylaws'
threshold.
But, the ASSU has historically gone ahead and dis
bursed the entirety of groups' special fees at the onset
of the year. Therefore, it was reasonable for financial
officers to expect the same this autumn. The responsi
bility to inform groups of the new requirements laid
with the ASSU.
In the end, only a few groups are likely to be seri
ously affected by the ASSU's bill and subsequent lack
of communication regarding its implementation.
Thus, the problem can be fixed, but it stands as an ex
ample of the ASSU's persistent failings at effectively
communicating with those it serves.
In the aftermath of this latest breakdown in com
munication, there has now been talk of the ASSU cre
ating a special committee to deal with communication.
Hopefully, such a committee would help prevent situ
ations such as what recently occurred.
It's great that the ASSU is taking measures to pro
vide meaningful special-fees reform. It just needs to
remember to tell us about them.

last Friday. Understandably, many were disap
pointed to hear that portions of their special-fees
budgets would not be available this quarter. This
might have amounted to little more than a minor ir
ritation for most groups, but if a group was planning
to spend the majority of its special fees in autumn
quarter, it found itself in an unexpectedly tight fi
nancial situation.
The Stanford Concert Network, for example,
needs all of its special-fees funds by the beginning of
the year in order to bring expensive artists to cam
pus to perform for the Stanford community. A rep
resentative from the ASSU said that the ASSU will
be working with SCN to ensure that they can still
book artists. We are encouraged that the ASSU is
accommodating those it inconveniences, and it must
be certain to make such efforts to help out any other
groups in similar situations.
According to the ASSU bylaws, the ASSU is only
required to make a minimum of 33 percent of a
group's special-fees funding for the year available
each quarter. Thus, the withholding as laid out by the
recent bill is indeed legal, and easily meets the bylaws'
threshold.
But, the ASSU has historically gone ahead and dis
bursed the entirety of groups' special fees at the onset
of the year. Therefore, it was reasonable for financial
officers to expect the same this autumn. The responsi
bility to inform groups of the new requirements laid
with the ASSU.
In the end, only a few groups are likely to be seri
ously affected by the ASSU's bill and subsequent lack
of communication regarding its implementation.
Thus, the problem can be fixed, but it stands as an ex
ample of the ASSU's persistent failings at effectively
communicating with those it serves.
In the aftermath of this latest breakdown in com
munication, there has now been talk of the ASSU cre
ating a special committee to deal with communication.
Hopefully, such a committee would help prevent situ
ations such as what recently occurred.
It's great that the ASSU is taking measures to pro
vide meaningful special-fees reform. It just needs to
remember to tell us about them.
