## Holocaust survivor protests wall 
### HEDY EPSTEIN 
In 1939,1 left the village of Kippen
heim, Germany, on a Kindertransport
- a small group of children allowed to
go to England - thus surviving the
Holocaust. In December, I went to Is
rael to honor the memory of my par
ents, Ella and Hugo Wachenheimer,
who did not survive the war against the
Jews. At a monument near Jerusalem,
I lit candles for my parents and for the
other 80,(X)0 Jews deported from
France to the death camps.
It is impossible to visit Israel
these days without being aware of
the constant threat posed by terror
ists. Suicide bombs kill and maim in
nocent persons riding in buses or
taking a meal in a restaurant.
We Jews who survived the Shoah
know all too well that the intentional
targeting of civilians is illegal and im
moral. So I grieve the loss of life in
Jerusalem from the suicide bombs.
But I also grieve the loss of life in
Palestine, which occurs almost on a
daily basis. So I went to Palestine as
a member of the International Soli
darity Movement (ISM) to observe
the difficult conditions of daily life
under military occupation.
It would have been enough to
reach out and touch just one Palestini
an and place my hand on her shoulder
and tell her that I was with her in her
pain. But I saw and did much more.
In Bethlehem, I saw a Caterpillar

bulldozer ripping up centuries-old
olive trees to clear a path for rolled
razor wire and antitank trenches di
viding the town where Jesus was born.
In Qalqilia, I was dwarfed by Is
rael's separation wall rising more
than 25 feet. In President George W.
Bush's phrase, it "snakes in and out
of the West Bank." It keeps farmers
from their fields and hems in 50,(XX)
residents on all sides.
In Masha (Mas'ha), 1 joined a
demonstration against this wall. I
saw a red sign warning ominously of
"Mortal Danger" to any who dare
cross this fence. Then I saw Israeli
soldiers aiming at unarmed Israeli
and international protesters.
I saw blood pouring out of Gil
Na'amati, a young Israeli whose first
public act after completing his military
service was to protest against this wall.
I saw shrapnel lodged in the leg
of Anne Farina, one of my traveling
companions from St. Louis. And I
thought of Kent State and Jackson
State, where National Guardsmen
opened fire in 1970 on protesters
against the Vietnam War.
Near Der Beilut, 1 saw the Israeli
police turn a water cannon on our
nonviolent protest. And I remem
bered Birmingham, Ala., in 1963
and wondered why a democratic so
ciety responds to peaceable assem
bly by trying literally to drown out
the voice of our protest.
At the end of the journey I had a

shocking experience. I knew that
what I had said and done was viewed
by some as controversial but surely
not as threatening.
So I did not imagine that the Is
raeli security force that guards Ben-
Gurion Airport would abuse a 79-
year-old Holocaust survivor, holding
me for five hours and performing a
completely unnecessary strip search
of every part of my naked body.
The only shame these security offi
cials expressed was to turn their badges
around so that their names were invisi
ble. The only conceivable purpose for
this gross violation of my bodily in
tegrity was to humiliate and terrify me.
Of course, I felt humiliated by this
outrage, but 1 refuse to be terrified by
cowards who hide their identity while
engaging in such unnecessary disre
spect. It is a cruel illusion that brute
force of this sort provides security to
Israel. Degrading me cannot silence
my small voice.
Similarly, humiliating Palestini
ans cannot extinguish their hopes
fora homeland. Only ending this ut
terly unnecessary occupation will
bring peace to the region.

Hi'dy Epstein is a Holocaust sur
vivor. Her story is featured in the
Academy Award winning documen
tary, "Into the Arms of Strangers:
Stories of the Kindertransport." She
will be speaking at Stanford today at
