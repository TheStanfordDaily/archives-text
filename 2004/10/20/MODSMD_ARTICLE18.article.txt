## Protest Philip Zelikow and the Sept. 11 cover-up commission today 
### CAROLE BROUILLET 
Philip Zelikow will speak at
Kresge Auditorium, today, from
4:15 to 5:30 p.m. We plan to protest
the Sept. 11 cover-up and to raise
questions about his role as executive
director of the 9-11 Commission and
the Commission's report.
Zelikow, a national security ad
viser to both Bush administrations
and a principal author of the official
9-11 Commission Report, was part
of Bush's transition team for the Na
tional Security Council after the
2000 election. He was appointed to

the President's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board a month after the
Sept. 11 2(X)I attacks.
The Family Steering Committee
called for his resignation because of
his obvious conflicts of interests.
While Sept. 11 has been used to
invade Afghanistan and Iraq, shred
the Constitution and Bill of Rights,
construct a global police state, en
rich weapons manufacturers and
seize oil assets, there have been no
convictions in any courts of law sup
porting the government conspiracy
theory, particularly the Saddam
Hussein / Al Qacda link.

The 9-11 Commission failed to
mention or address the multiple war
games / exercises that were being
conducted that day, out of the White
House. As many as five war game
drills were in process, some involv
ing hijacked airliners, a plane crash
ing into a building, some involving
false blips deliberately inserted onto
FA A and military radar screens.
One exercise pulled significant
fighter resources away from the
Northeastern United States on Sept.
11.
These exercises involved North
American Air Defense Command,

the Federal Aviation Administra
tion, the Canadian Air Force, the
CIA and the National Reconnais
sance Office.
Coincidentally, in New York
City, massive preparations were un
derway fora biochemical attack drill
involving FEMA, the Mayor's Of
fice of Emergency Management, the
FBI, the U.S. Department of Justice,
Weill Medical College, the N.Y.
Deptartment of Health, the N.Y.
Fire Department, the N.Y. Police
Department, the American Red
Cross and the Port Authority.
The Secret Service and Cheney's

overseeing role during the events of
Sept. 11 were overlooked. This was
documented in Michael Ruppert's
new book "Crossing the Rubicon -
The Decline of the American Em
pire at the End of the Age of Oil."
The Commissioners and Zelikow
had deep conflicts of interest and
many reasons to cover up the truth
about Sept. 11.
They are now engaged in a public
relations effort to sell the official
narrative and the war on terrorism.
Both the official inquiry and the
Commission's parameters were to
support the official story and justify

the creation of Homeland Security
Department.
Homeland Security in German is
"geheimstadt politza," which during
World War II was abbreviated to
Gestapo. Do Americans really be
lieve a "Gestapo" will make us
safer?
The Stanford Institute for Inter
national Studies is sponsoring Ze
likow's talk, but the Department of
Homeland Security has awarded a
15-month $1.65-million contract to
CISAC and the Stanford Institute
for International Studies to conduct
research on how national and local
agencies improve the design and
evaluation of future terrorist exer
cises of national and local response
systems.
The DHS research contract re
sulted from CISAC's observation
of last year's spring State Depart
ment-sponsored, full-scale exercise
called TOPOFF2, designed to pre
pare national, state and local offi
cials to respond to potential terror
ist attacks within the United States.
The United States has a long his
tory of training terrorists and
launching covert operations
throughout the world.
Terrorism allows states to de
clare emergencies, label all opposi
tion as terrorists and reduce civil
rights.

likow's talk, but the Department of
Homeland Security has awarded a
15-month $1.65-million contract to
CISAC and the Stanford Institute
for International Studies to conduct
research on how national and local
agencies improve the design and
evaluation of future terrorist exer
cises of national and local response
systems.
The DHS research contract re
sulted from CISAC's observation
of last year's spring State Depart
ment-sponsored, full-scale exercise
called TOPOFF2, designed to pre
pare national, state and local offi
cials to respond to potential terror
ist attacks within the United States.
The United States has a long his
tory of training terrorists and
launching covert operations
throughout the world.
Terrorism allows states to de
clare emergencies, label all opposi
tion as terrorists and reduce civil
rights.

Carol Brouillet is an organizer for
the International Inquiry into 9-11, a
group that is responsible for expos
ing information about Sept. 11.
