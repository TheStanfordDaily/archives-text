# Top state court halts petition on faxed ballots
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
California residents living overseas must
waive their right to a secret ballot when vot
ing by fax, even though the state has not
shown sufficient cause for requiring this ac
tion, the State Supreme Court ruled last
week. The decision halted an emergency pe
tition filed by Theresa Bridgeman, Class of
2003, against California Secretary of State
Kevin Shelley.
Bridgeman, a Rhodes Scholar studying at
Oxford University, petitioned the court to im
pose a stay on the section of a new state bill
mandating that overseas voters sign an oath
waiving the right to keep their name, address
and voting record confidential when voting by
fax.
Due in part to the imminence of the Nov. 2,
2004 election, the court declared it "impossi
ble, as a practical matter" to grant the stay
"without engendering undue confusion and
uncertainty in the election results."
However, in response to the Bridgeman's
charge that the oath violates the California
Constitution, the court issued Shelley with an
order to show cause of constitutionality, due at
a later date.
"The order to show cause is very unusual,"
said Bridgeman's attorney, Scott Rafferty.
"Unfortunately, it won't take effect until after
the election. We're disappointed, but it's still a
big victory."
Raffertv said he is considering taking the

case to federal court.
Bridgeman, a resident of Santa Clara Coun
ty, supported the authorization of voting by fax
without the waiver, noting the unreliability of
international mail.
She petitioned against the waiver on the
grounds that it violates state and federal vot
ing laws, discourages voters and invites voter
intimidation tactics, particularly within the
military.
People who sign the oath must agree to
waive some of their voter rights, guaranteed by
the state constitution since 1879, because the
process of voting by fax discloses personal in
formation to the Department of Defense and
its private contractor. Omega Technologies,
which forwards the received ballots to election
officials.
The bill, A.B. 2941, was signed by Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger on Sept. 27 and took
effect immediately.
Approximately 550,000 Californians live
abroad. Absentee ballots were sent to over
seas voters beginning Sept. 2, 60 days before
the election. There are no published guide
lines on how county officials should deal with
ballots that were delivered before the bill's
passage.
Peggy Lynch, a junior studying abroad in
Stanford's Australia program, expressed con
cern about the bill.
"I think the biggest problem with the new
law would be not the loss of the secret ballot,
but that people weren't aware when they
signed up to vote absentee," she said via e

mail. "I'd rather have my vote be confidential
â€” 1 think the right to a secret ballot is so im
portant in a democratic system."
Junior Natasha Chen, voter hall captain for
the Stanford House in Oxford, said in an e-mail
that she was surprised to hear about the option
to fax.
"Most of the people from California are
doing fine sending in their ballots through
mail," she said. "A few are expressing diffi

culties just getting their ballots in general,
hut that's a nationwide problem, not just
California."
Another factor that affects overseas voters
is the cost to mail absentee ballots across the
world.
"1 mailed my ballot back yesterday and had
to pay for postage," Lynch said, adding, "It's
not a big deal but it seems odd to have to pay to
vote."
