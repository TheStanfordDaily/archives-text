## Why John and John do not support same-sex marriage 
### NICK FRAM 
Nothing caused more tur
moil this summer in the
U.S. Senate than the de
bate over the Federal
Marriage Amendment. The phones
rang continuously in every Senate
office as impassioned citizens
voiced their opinions on both sides
of the issue.
What happened? Well, the first
constitutional amendment of the
108 th Congress to come to the floor
without going through committee
was never actually put to a vote.
Fifty voters or half of the senate
cast their ballots against even hav
ing a vote on it, while 48 voted for it.
This falls below the 60 who must
first agree to have a vote on the bill
itself, not to mention the 67 that
have to vote for it in order for it to
pass.
Now 50 plus 48 equals 98. Ok, so
that means that two of our esteemed
senators, in whom we place more
power than any elected official,
save the commander in chief, chose
not to exercise their right to vote.
Who were they? You guessed it:
John K. and John E.
The easy explanation for why
they did not vote was that they were
out campaigning - in other words,
asking you for your vote.
Quite understandably, they've
missed a lot of senate votes to do that.
But this does not mean that they do
not have a stance on the issue.
Like most Democrats who
weaseled out of having to vote yea
or nay for the actual amendment,
John and John regard gay marriage
as a state issue. And as the Constitu
tion of our land now stands, it is.
Family law has been for more than
200 years one of the many areas of the
law reserved to the states.
But why do John and John think
that? The reason for that is even
more straightforward.
What percent of the voting pop

ulation do homosexuals make up?
I'll give you a hint: not much.
Simply put, the Johns don't sup
port gay marriage because they
don't have to. They can decry the
Federal Marriage Amendment as a
political diversion whose aim is to
drive the cultural wedge further up
America's already obese behind,
but when it comes down to the nitty
gritty, they have room to back off
and seek the approval of people
whose votes they desperately need:
lowans.
Some would say that gay mar
riage is a civil rights issue. Well, it is
and it isn't.
In moral terms, it is about ex
tending the blanket of equality
over an even greater group of peo
ple. In political terms, it does not
even come close to the great civil
rights uprising our parents wit
nessed with African-Americans in
the 19605, when civil rights were fi
nally properly extended to a previ
ously oppressed group of people.
African-Americans make up a
huge percentage of the population,
then and now. That translates into
votes.
To vastly oversimplify matters:
under which party's leadership did
the civil rights movement make the
most advances? The Democrats.
Which party does upwards of 90
percent of African-Americans vote
for today? The Democrats.
What percent of the population
do gay people make up again? A
better question might be what per
centage they are of the electorate in
Ohio, Florida and lowa.
So how are the minds of John
and John to be changed? Not easily.
At least not without an unforeseen
mass migration of the homosexual
community to lowa.
