## Card host Regional 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
After making a quick recovery from
last week's early departure at the Riv
iera / ITA All-American Champi
onships, the top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team enters the North
west Regional Championships with a
clear conscience and brighter outlook.
Last year, three Cardinal were seed
ed among the top 10 for the Stanford
hosted affair, held at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium. This season's compe
tition holds similar promise for Stan
ford, with junior Alice Barnes entered
as the top seed, followed by senior Erin
Burdette at No. 4 and sophomore
Theresa Logar at No. 6.
But because these numbers are all
based on last year's performances,
Barnes conceded that they mean "al
most nothing"; For the Cardinal,
whose main interest is maintaining the
momentum required to live up to their
record 13 NCAA honors and 17 con
secutive Pacific-10 Conference league
titles, the start of the season is defined
more by building team unity and less by

racking up stellar results.
"As far as the Regionals go, it will be
interesting," said Stanford assistant
coach Frankie Brennan. "I think we're
sort of in that area [where] with one
more week of good practice, we can he
ready to really compete and have a re
ally good showing."
Brennan speaks of Stanford's
perennial quarter-system disadvan
tage: Most opponents, including cross
bay rival California, have been in
school several weeks longer and have
had more time to practice.
Stanford's sluggishness also stems
from its 2004 NCAA victory over
UCLA; the 4-1 sweep is still blindingly
fresh in many returning player's minds.
By contrast, the 2003 squad came
away empty-handed from NCAAs,
dropping 4-3 to long-standing rival
Florida
"When you lose the championship
in the finals, your quest fora title begins
the next day, especially [when you lose
to Florida)" Brennan said. "I think the
team last year went out and worked
during the summer to improve its
deficiencies and really get back on
track."
Brennan continued, "To do that
a couple of years straight isn't good
for you; you need to take a break.
We have all the talent but I think
mentally it's going to be a little
tougher to keep this thing going."

Meanwhile, the Northwest Re
gional Tournament is primed for
hard-fought matches and feisty com
petition. Reigning Northwest cham
pion senior Daria Panova of Oregon
is seeded second.
Panova (0-2), who is ranked No. 8
in the nation, topped California's
No. 30 Sasha Podkolzina in the fi
nals, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2. Panova had faced
off earlier against Stanford, surviv
ing a three-setter over No. 26 Logar
in the Round of 16,6-2,2-6,6-1.
Podkolzina (3-3) is seeded
eighth, and returns to the courts in
top form after suffering a long bout
of illness last season.
"She is probably going to be the
scariest one out there," Brennan
said.
As a freshman, 5' 11" Podkolzina
made a name for herself as a fiery
force to be reckoned with, dropping
only one set on her way to the tour
nament finals.
Podkolzina allowed Stanford's
No. 71 Anne Yelsey (1-1) just two
games in the semis, posting a 6-0,6-2
victory over the Newport Beach,
Calif., native.
Yelsey is seeded at No. 12 this
year, and will face off against the
likes of Washington's No. 11 Dea
Sumantri (1-1), the third seed at
Northwest, and Fresno State's No.
24 Margarita Karnaukhova (2-1),
who is seeded fifth.
In the doubles arena, Barnes and
Burdette team up as first seed in the
tournament. The duo has high
hopes, tempered with an acknowl
edgement of the hard work neces-

No. 13 doubles team
getting its timing down

sary to continue the Cardinal's No. 1
doubles legacy.
Last year, Burdette finished her
third and final season with partner
Lauren Barnikow, who graduated in
June.
The top-ranked tandem of
Barnikow and Burdette clinched the
Northwest Regional doubles title
two years in a row and closed out the
season with a 32-3 record and 16.93
point margin over the nation's No. 2
team, Vanderbilt's Aleke
Tsoubanos and Kelly Schmandt.
Add that 16.93 margin in ranking
scores, the second-largest gap since
1984, to Barnikow and Burdette's
being named ITA National Doubles
Team — twice — and the Cardi
nal's new No. 1 hopeful has some big
shoes to fill.
"We're still finding our niche in
doubles," Barnes said. "But I'm very
confident in Burdette, that's for
sure. I think she has the best doubles
game around."
The duo of Barnes and Burdette
is ranked at No. 13 and stands at 1-1
in the season. The team fell in the
quarterfinals of All-American to
Florida's unranked freshman tan
dem of Whitney Benik and Lolita
Frangulyan, 8-2.
"We had a mediocre All-Ameri
can tournament," Brennan said of
the players' first- and second-round
losses. "[But] I think right now we're
where we expected to be in terms of
getting in shape and getting our tim
ing down."

"When you lose the championship
in the finals, your quest fora title begins
the next day, especially [when you lose
to Florida)" Brennan said. "I think the
team last year went out and worked
during the summer to improve its
deficiencies and really get back on
track."
Brennan continued, "To do that
a couple of years straight isn't good
for you; you need to take a break.
We have all the talent but I think
mentally it's going to be a little
tougher to keep this thing going."

Meanwhile, the Northwest Re
gional Tournament is primed for
hard-fought matches and feisty com
petition. Reigning Northwest cham
pion senior Daria Panova of Oregon
is seeded second.
Panova (0-2), who is ranked No. 8
in the nation, topped California's
No. 30 Sasha Podkolzina in the fi
nals, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2. Panova had faced
off earlier against Stanford, surviv
ing a three-setter over No. 26 Logar
in the Round of 16,6-2,2-6,6-1.
Podkolzina (3-3) is seeded
eighth, and returns to the courts in
top form after suffering a long bout
of illness last season.
"She is probably going to be the
scariest one out there," Brennan
said.
As a freshman, 5' 11" Podkolzina
made a name for herself as a fiery
force to be reckoned with, dropping
only one set on her way to the tour
nament finals.
Podkolzina allowed Stanford's
No. 71 Anne Yelsey (1-1) just two
games in the semis, posting a 6-0,6-2
victory over the Newport Beach,
Calif., native.
Yelsey is seeded at No. 12 this
year, and will face off against the
likes of Washington's No. 11 Dea
Sumantri (1-1), the third seed at
Northwest, and Fresno State's No.
24 Margarita Karnaukhova (2-1),
who is seeded fifth.
In the doubles arena, Barnes and
Burdette team up as first seed in the
tournament. The duo has high
hopes, tempered with an acknowl
edgement of the hard work neces-

No. 13 doubles team
getting its timing down

sary to continue the Cardinal's No. 1
doubles legacy.
Last year, Burdette finished her
third and final season with partner
Lauren Barnikow, who graduated in
June.
The top-ranked tandem of
Barnikow and Burdette clinched the
Northwest Regional doubles title
two years in a row and closed out the
season with a 32-3 record and 16.93
point margin over the nation's No. 2
team, Vanderbilt's Aleke
Tsoubanos and Kelly Schmandt.
Add that 16.93 margin in ranking
scores, the second-largest gap since
1984, to Barnikow and Burdette's
being named ITA National Doubles
Team — twice — and the Cardi
nal's new No. 1 hopeful has some big
shoes to fill.
"We're still finding our niche in
doubles," Barnes said. "But I'm very
confident in Burdette, that's for
sure. I think she has the best doubles
game around."
The duo of Barnes and Burdette
is ranked at No. 13 and stands at 1-1
in the season. The team fell in the
quarterfinals of All-American to
Florida's unranked freshman tan
dem of Whitney Benik and Lolita
Frangulyan, 8-2.
"We had a mediocre All-Ameri
can tournament," Brennan said of
the players' first- and second-round
losses. "[But] I think right now we're
where we expected to be in terms of
getting in shape and getting our tim
ing down."

Sophomore Teresa Logar is enter
ing play as the No. 6 seed at the
Riviera/ITA Ail-American Champi
onships.
After making a quick recovery from
last week's early departure at the Riv
iera / ITA All-American Champi
onships, the top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team enters the North
west Regional Championships with a
clear conscience and brighter outlook.
Last year, three Cardinal were seed
ed among the top 10 for the Stanford
hosted affair, held at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium. This season's compe
tition holds similar promise for Stan
ford, with junior Alice Barnes entered
as the top seed, followed by senior Erin
Burdette at No. 4 and sophomore
Theresa Logar at No. 6.
But because these numbers are all
based on last year's performances,
Barnes conceded that they mean "al
most nothing"; For the Cardinal,
whose main interest is maintaining the
momentum required to live up to their
record 13 NCAA honors and 17 con
secutive Pacific-10 Conference league
titles, the start of the season is defined
more by building team unity and less by

racking up stellar results.
"As far as the Regionals go, it will be
interesting," said Stanford assistant
coach Frankie Brennan. "I think we're
sort of in that area [where] with one
more week of good practice, we can he
ready to really compete and have a re
ally good showing."
Brennan speaks of Stanford's
perennial quarter-system disadvan
tage: Most opponents, including cross
bay rival California, have been in
school several weeks longer and have
had more time to practice.
Stanford's sluggishness also stems
from its 2004 NCAA victory over
UCLA; the 4-1 sweep is still blindingly
fresh in many returning player's minds.
By contrast, the 2003 squad came
away empty-handed from NCAAs,
dropping 4-3 to long-standing rival
Florida
"When you lose the championship
