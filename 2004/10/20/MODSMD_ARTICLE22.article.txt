## Card host Regional 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
After making a quick recovery from
last week's early departure at the Riv

women's tennis team enters the North
west Regional Championships with a

from its 2004 NCAA victory over
UCLA; the 4-1 sweep is still blindingly
fresh in many returning player's minds.
By contrast, the 2003 squad came
away empty-handed from NCAAs,
dropping 4-3 to long-standing rival
Florida
"When you lose the championship
in the finals, your quest fora title begins
the next day, especially [when you lose
to Florida)" Brennan said. "I think the
