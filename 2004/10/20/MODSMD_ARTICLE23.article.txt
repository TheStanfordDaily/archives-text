# Men look to turn tide at revamped golf course
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the coming of winter and the Stan
ford rainy season, the men's golf team is no
doubt enjoying a rare chance for some
home cooking this week. After the
women's team took fifth place at home last
week, the men will try to defend their home
turf against a strong field at this weekend's
Nelson Invitational.
The Cardinal will be working against a
pair of negative trends.
First, the team has struggled in its last
two events, placing 12th at the Windon
Memorial and 10th at the Alister Macken
zie Invitational.
Second, Stanford has been unable to
produce at the Nelson over the past couple
of seasons, landing in ninth place a year ago
and seventh in 2002.
Coach Conrad Ray's lineup of senior
Kevin Blue, junior Kyle Gentry, sopho
mores Matt Savage and Zack Miller and
freshman Rob Grube will try to turn things

around this weekend.
Will they succeed? In the words of one
Magic 8-ball, "Signs point to yes!"
First, the members of this week's team
have feasted on the Stanford Golf Course
in the past. Miller notched an 18th-place
performance a year ago, while Savage
recorded his best finish of the year.
"I've been working hard with the guys to
play well at other courses," Ray said. "But
they normally play really well in qualifying
rounds at Stanford, so if we play like we
usually do, we should be fine."
Second, this is a very different team
from the one that posted a disappointing
ninth-place finish at last year's Nelson.
Stanford has received an infusion of new
blood in Grube, who has been the Cardi
nal's best player to this point in the young
season.
Finally, and most importantly, this
year's tournament won't even be held at
the same golf course. Although teams will

arrive at the same piece of proper
ty, the Stanford Golf Course has
undergone dramatic changes
since it last hosted a men's NCAA
event, and the new layout only
made its debut in collegiate com
petition five days ago when the
women's team hosted the Pepsi
Stanford Intercollegiate.
The net impact of these
changes? The course has become
slightly shorter, and the par-five
seventh has been replaced by a par
three at No. 18. As a result, scores
at the par-69 layout may be slightly
worse than in the past (in relation
to par) since the tough, uphill 18th
hole takes the place of a seventh
hole that gave away many birdies in
years gone by.
Also complicating matters
could be the weather. Women's
coach Caroline O'Connor was sur
prised that scoring was not lower
last weekend, but noted that thick,
wet conditions in the rough may

have played a major role in keeping
scores high.
This week's conditions are sure
to be tougher, as rain has soaked
the grounds since Sunday's final
round, and hitting fairways will be
extremely important in negotiating
the course.
"The rough's been growing all
week and there are some tough pin
placements out there that I've cho
sen," Ray said. "I'd be surprised if
anybody went out there and really
tore it up."
In addition to changes in the
venue, this year's field will repre
sent a departure from the past as
well. Stanford will be the only Pa
cific-10 Conference team in the 16-
team field. Despite the absence of
powerhouses like No. 10 Southern
California and No. 19 UCLA, there
will be no shortage of talent at the
Farm this weekend.

Mexico and No. 12 UNLV. From
the Atlanta area. No. 16 Georgia
State will compete as well.
The individual competition will
also be fierce, featuring two of the
nation's brightest stars. New Mexi
co's Spencer Levin and UNLV's
Ryan Moore, currently ranked No.
1 and No. 2 in the country respec
tively, will participate in this week
end's tournament.
Moore won an impressive victo

onship in August, the most presti

teur golfers.
Levin, meanwhile, has already
claimed an individual title this sea

With the coming of winter and the Stan
ford rainy season, the men's golf team is no
doubt enjoying a rare chance for some
home cooking this week. After the
women's team took fifth place at home last
week, the men will try to defend their home
turf against a strong field at this weekend's
Nelson Invitational.
The Cardinal will be working against a
pair of negative trends.
First, the team has struggled in its last
two events, placing 12th at the Windon
Memorial and 10th at the Alister Macken
zie Invitational.
Second, Stanford has been unable to
produce at the Nelson over the past couple
of seasons, landing in ninth place a year ago
and seventh in 2002.
Coach Conrad Ray's lineup of senior
Kevin Blue, junior Kyle Gentry, sopho
mores Matt Savage and Zack Miller and
freshman Rob Grube will try to turn things

around this weekend.
Will they succeed? In the words of one
Magic 8-ball, "Signs point to yes!"
First, the members of this week's team
have feasted on the Stanford Golf Course
in the past. Miller notched an 18th-place
performance a year ago, while Savage
recorded his best finish of the year.
"I've been working hard with the guys to
play well at other courses," Ray said. "But
they normally play really well in qualifying
rounds at Stanford, so if we play like we
usually do, we should be fine."
Second, this is a very different team
from the one that posted a disappointing
ninth-place finish at last year's Nelson.
Stanford has received an infusion of new
blood in Grube, who has been the Cardi
nal's best player to this point in the young
season.
Finally, and most importantly, this
year's tournament won't even be held at
the same golf course. Although teams will

arrive at the same piece of proper
ty, the Stanford Golf Course has
undergone dramatic changes
since it last hosted a men's NCAA
event, and the new layout only
made its debut in collegiate com
petition five days ago when the
women's team hosted the Pepsi
Stanford Intercollegiate.
The net impact of these
changes? The course has become
slightly shorter, and the par-five
seventh has been replaced by a par
three at No. 18. As a result, scores
at the par-69 layout may be slightly
worse than in the past (in relation
to par) since the tough, uphill 18th
hole takes the place of a seventh
hole that gave away many birdies in
years gone by.
Also complicating matters
could be the weather. Women's
coach Caroline O'Connor was sur
prised that scoring was not lower
last weekend, but noted that thick,
wet conditions in the rough may

have played a major role in keeping
scores high.
This week's conditions are sure
to be tougher, as rain has soaked
the grounds since Sunday's final
round, and hitting fairways will be
extremely important in negotiating
the course.
