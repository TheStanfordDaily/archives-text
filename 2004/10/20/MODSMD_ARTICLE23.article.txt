With the coming of winter and the Stan
ford rainy season, the men's golf team is no
doubt enjoying a rare chance for some
home cooking this week. After the
women's team took fifth place at home last
week, the men will try to defend their home
turf against a strong field at this weekend's
Nelson Invitational.
The Cardinal will be working against a

two events, placing 12th at the Windon
Memorial and 10th at the Alister Macken

Kevin Blue, junior Kyle Gentry, sopho

freshman Rob Grube will try to turn things

around this weekend.

play well at other courses," Ray said. "But
they normally play really well in qualifying
rounds at Stanford, so if we play like we
usually do, we should be fine."
Second, this is a very different team
from the one that posted a disappointing
ninth-place finish at last year's Nelson.
Stanford has received an infusion of new
blood in Grube, who has been the Cardi
nal's best player to this point in the young
season.
Finally, and most importantly, this
year's tournament won't even be held at
the same golf course. Although teams will
