# Favorites triumph in Pac-10

### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's 23-17 win at Washington
State was the Pacific-10 Conference's
most competitive contest last weekend,
as No. 1 Southern California's much-an
ticipated showdown with No. 15 Arizona
State quickly turned into a laugher.
The favored team triumphed in all five
Pac-10 contests and the Pac-10 picture
became significantly clearly after a week
end of match-ups between teams neigh
boring each other in the standings.
No. 1 USC 45, No. 15 Arizona State 7
The Sun Devils' first drive featured a
short kickoff return and two false starts
that backed the Devils up to their own
four-yard line, and their offensive effort

didn't get much better from there. The
Trojans ran up a 42-7 halftime lead and
didn't give anything away in the second
half, either.
Arizona State (5-1, 2-1) was the third
unbeaten Pac-10 foe to play the Trojans
(Stanford and California were the oth
ers) and the third to lose to the defending
national champions; it was, though, the
first undefeated opponent that didn't
threaten USC's winning streak, which
has now reached 15 games.
For the host Trojans (6-0, 3-0), Matt
Leinart was 13-of-24 passing for 224
yards and four touchdowns and added a
one-yard touchdown run, while Reggie
Bush had 168 yards of total offense, in
cluding a 52-yard touchdown pass, a 10-
yard touchdown reception and a 41-yard
kick return.
LenDale White rushed 16 times for 72

yards, both game highs, and caught a
nine-yard touchdown pass. Freshman
Dwayne Jarrett had five receptions, in
cluding 52-, 34- and 19-yard touchdowns.
Senior Andrew Walter, who broke
Jake Plummer's Arizona State record for
career completions in the first quarter,
finished 19-of-34 passing but totaled just
181 yards and was intercepted twice and
sacked six times. Hakim Hill led the Sun
Devils with 31 yards rushing and scored
their lone touchdown, while freshman
tight end Zach Miller had a career day
with eight catches for 102 yards.
The Trojans remain the top-ranked
team in the nation and are the Pac-10's
only unbeaten team in both the overall
and conference standings.
No. 8 California 45, UCLA 28

No one can stop Cal's offense; it leads
the Pac-10 with 41.6 points per game. The
defensively challenged Bruins certainly
couldn't, although they did well to put 28
points on the board against a defense al
lowing just 17.2 points per game.
The Bruins (4-2,2-1) yield 252.7 rush
ing yards per game, by far the worst mark
in the Pac-10, and Cal's (4-1,2-1) star tail
back J.J. Arrington hit them up for 206
yards and two touchdowns on 29 carries
Saturday. To make matters worse for vis
iting UCLA, Cal's other ballcarriers
chipped in another 99 yards on just 12
carries.
Aaron Rodgers compounded those
difficulties by completing 19-of-29 passes
for 260 yards and four touchdowns with
out being intercepted. Geoff Mac Arthur

Sophomore tight end Patrick Donahy and the Stanford offense completed 244 yards passing and ran for 139 against Washington.
had his second straight big game,
catching nine balls for 163 yards and
two scores.
UCLA's Drew Olson was an im
pressive 20-of-36 for 299 yards, four
touchdowns and nary an intercep
tion. But the Pac-10's second-lead
ing rusher. Maurice Drew, gained
just 52 yards rushing, although he
did have 76 yards and two touch
downs as a receiver.
Despite all of Cal's weapons, the
game was initially competitive, as
the Bruins tied the game at 14 in the
second quarter before the Golden
Bears pulled away. Arlington, the
Pac-10's leading rusher, was named
Pac-10 Offensive Player of the
Week for his performance.
Only No. 5 Florida State has a
better national ranking among one
loss teams than the Golden Bears.
Stanford 23, Washington State 17
In a matchup of teams with iden
tical conference and overall
records entering the game, Stan
ford secured its position in the top
half of the Pac-10.
Evan Moore's 67-yard touch
down reception on the first play of
the second half gave Stanford a 20-3
lead, and the visiting Cardinal held
for their best start since 2001.
Also for the Cardinal (4-2, 2-1),
Kenneth Tolon rushed for 99 yards
on a season-high 20 carries, Trent
Edwards completed 15-of-31 passes

caught seven passes and threw a 42-
yard pass to set up a J.R. Lemon
touchdown run.
The Cougars (3-3, 1-2) rallied
late, scoring twice in less than three

minutes in the fourth quarter, but
Michael Sgroi responded with a 47-
yard field goal for Stanford — his
third of the night — and Osh
iomogho Atogwe intercepted a pass
to kill the Cougars' last serious
threat.
For the Cougars, Josh Swogger
completed 18-of-36 passes for 257
yards and a touchdown, hut was in
tercepted three times. Jerome Har
rison ran for 84 yards and a touch
down, Allen Thompson rushed for
76 yards on nine carries, and Jason
Hill caught five passes for 115 yards
and a score.
Atogwe, who also made nine tack
les, was named Pac-10 Defensive
Player of the Week for his efforts.
Oregon 28, Arizona 14
The Ducks (3-3,2-1), coming off a
comeback win over Washington State
Oct. 9, maintained their winning ways
Saturday with a home win over the
hard-luck Wildcats (1-5,0-3).
Terrence Whitehead rushed for
three first-half touchdowns as the
Ducks opened a 21-0 halftime lead,
while Demetrius Williams finished
with nine catches for 153 yards.
Kellen Clemens completed 21-of-30
passes for 336 yards and a score
without being picked off, while
Whitehead ended with 74 yards
rushing on only 15 carries.
Mike Bell ran for 71 yards to lead
Arizona, which saw Kris Heavner
complete just 9-of-24 passes for 79
yards and two interceptions — dou
bling his season total — before
being pulled. Backup Richard Ko
valcheck completed five-of-10 pass
es for 77 vards, a touchdown and an

Cardinal secure position
in better half of Pac-10

interception as the Wildcats scored
twice in the final two minutes to
avert the shutout.
Oregon State 29, Washington 14
Alexis Serna, who missed three
extra points in Oregon State's sea
son opener, connected on all five of
his field-goal attempts, including a
55-yarder at the end of the first half,
as the Beavers pushed past the hap
less host Huskies in a meeting of
teams seeking their first conference
win.
Derek Anderson completed 26-
of-40 passes for 286 yards and a
touchdown without being intercept
ed for the Beavers (2-4, 1-2), while
Dwight Wright ran for 109 yards and
a touchdown on 22 carries. Standout
Mike Hass once again led the
Beaver receivers with eight catches
for 98 yards.
Casey Paus started for Washing
ton (1-5, 0-3) but left after complet
ing one of five passes for two yards
and two interceptions. Isaiah Stan
back came in and completed 11-of
-29 passes for 219 yards, two touch
downs and an interception. He also
led the team with 76 yards rushing.
No Husky receiver had more than
two catches.
The Huskies were down only 9-7
at halftime, but they coughed up
seven turnovers in the game, includ
ing two goal-line fumbles by James
Sims and two more by Stanback in
the fourth quarter.

This weekend: Washington @ USC;
Cal @ Arizona; UCLA @ Arizona
State; Oregon @ Stanford; Washing

Stanford's 23-17 win at Washington
State was the Pacific-10 Conference's
most competitive contest last weekend,
as No. 1 Southern California's much-an
ticipated showdown with No. 15 Arizona
State quickly turned into a laugher.
The favored team triumphed in all five
Pac-10 contests and the Pac-10 picture
became significantly clearly after a week
end of match-ups between teams neigh
boring each other in the standings.
No. 1 USC 45, No. 15 Arizona State 7
The Sun Devils' first drive featured a
short kickoff return and two false starts
that backed the Devils up to their own
four-yard line, and their offensive effort

didn't get much better from there. The
Trojans ran up a 42-7 halftime lead and
didn't give anything away in the second
half, either.
Arizona State (5-1, 2-1) was the third
unbeaten Pac-10 foe to play the Trojans
(Stanford and California were the oth
ers) and the third to lose to the defending
national champions; it was, though, the
first undefeated opponent that didn't
threaten USC's winning streak, which
has now reached 15 games.
For the host Trojans (6-0, 3-0), Matt
Leinart was 13-of-24 passing for 224
yards and four touchdowns and added a
one-yard touchdown run, while Reggie
Bush had 168 yards of total offense, in
cluding a 52-yard touchdown pass, a 10-
yard touchdown reception and a 41-yard
kick return.
LenDale White rushed 16 times for 72

yards, both game highs, and caught a
nine-yard touchdown pass. Freshman
Dwayne Jarrett had five receptions, in
cluding 52-, 34- and 19-yard touchdowns.
Senior Andrew Walter, who broke
Jake Plummer's Arizona State record for
career completions in the first quarter,
finished 19-of-34 passing but totaled just
181 yards and was intercepted twice and
sacked six times. Hakim Hill led the Sun
Devils with 31 yards rushing and scored
their lone touchdown, while freshman
tight end Zach Miller had a career day
with eight catches for 102 yards.
The Trojans remain the top-ranked
team in the nation and are the Pac-10's
only unbeaten team in both the overall
and conference standings.
No. 8 California 45, UCLA 28

No one can stop Cal's offense; it leads
the Pac-10 with 41.6 points per game. The
defensively challenged Bruins certainly
couldn't, although they did well to put 28
points on the board against a defense al
lowing just 17.2 points per game.
The Bruins (4-2,2-1) yield 252.7 rush
ing yards per game, by far the worst mark
in the Pac-10, and Cal's (4-1,2-1) star tail
back J.J. Arrington hit them up for 206
yards and two touchdowns on 29 carries
Saturday. To make matters worse for vis
iting UCLA, Cal's other ballcarriers
chipped in another 99 yards on just 12
carries.
Aaron Rodgers compounded those
difficulties by completing 19-of-29 passes
for 260 yards and four touchdowns with
out being intercepted. Geoff Mac Arthur

catching nine balls for 163 yards and
two scores.
UCLA's Drew Olson was an im
pressive 20-of-36 for 299 yards, four
touchdowns and nary an intercep
tion. But the Pac-10's second-lead
ing rusher. Maurice Drew, gained
just 52 yards rushing, although he
did have 76 yards and two touch
downs as a receiver.
Despite all of Cal's weapons, the
game was initially competitive, as
the Bruins tied the game at 14 in the
second quarter before the Golden
Bears pulled away. Arlington, the
Pac-10's leading rusher, was named
Pac-10 Offensive Player of the
Week for his performance.
Only No. 5 Florida State has a

No. 8 California 45, UCLA 28

No one can stop Cal's offense; it leads
the Pac-10 with 41.6 points per game. The
defensively challenged Bruins certainly
couldn't, although they did well to put 28
points on the board against a defense al
lowing just 17.2 points per game.
The Bruins (4-2,2-1) yield 252.7 rush
ing yards per game, by far the worst mark
in the Pac-10, and Cal's (4-1,2-1) star tail
back J.J. Arrington hit them up for 206
yards and two touchdowns on 29 carries
Saturday. To make matters worse for vis
iting UCLA, Cal's other ballcarriers
chipped in another 99 yards on just 12
carries.
Aaron Rodgers compounded those
difficulties by completing 19-of-29 passes
for 260 yards and four touchdowns with
out being intercepted. Geoff Mac Arthur

second quarter before the Golden

Week for his performance.
