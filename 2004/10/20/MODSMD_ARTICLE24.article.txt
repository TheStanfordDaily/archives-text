# Favorites triumph in Pac-10

### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's 23-17 win at Washington
State was the Pacific-10 Conference's
most competitive contest last weekend,
as No. 1 Southern California's much-an
ticipated showdown with No. 15 Arizona
State quickly turned into a laugher.
The favored team triumphed in all five
Pac-10 contests and the Pac-10 picture
became significantly clearly after a week
end of match-ups between teams neigh
boring each other in the standings.
No. 1 USC 45, No. 15 Arizona State 7
The Sun Devils' first drive featured a
short kickoff return and two false starts
that backed the Devils up to their own
four-yard line, and their offensive effort

didn't get much better from there. The
Trojans ran up a 42-7 halftime lead and
didn't give anything away in the second
half, either.
Arizona State (5-1, 2-1) was the third
unbeaten Pac-10 foe to play the Trojans
(Stanford and California were the oth
ers) and the third to lose to the defending
national champions; it was, though, the
first undefeated opponent that didn't
threaten USC's winning streak, which
has now reached 15 games.
For the host Trojans (6-0, 3-0), Matt
Leinart was 13-of-24 passing for 224
yards and four touchdowns and added a
one-yard touchdown run, while Reggie
Bush had 168 yards of total offense, in
cluding a 52-yard touchdown pass, a 10-
yard touchdown reception and a 41-yard
kick return.
LenDale White rushed 16 times for 72

yards, both game highs, and caught a
nine-yard touchdown pass. Freshman
Dwayne Jarrett had five receptions, in
cluding 52-, 34- and 19-yard touchdowns.
Senior Andrew Walter, who broke
Jake Plummer's Arizona State record for
career completions in the first quarter,
finished 19-of-34 passing but totaled just
181 yards and was intercepted twice and
sacked six times. Hakim Hill led the Sun
Devils with 31 yards rushing and scored
their lone touchdown, while freshman
tight end Zach Miller had a career day
with eight catches for 102 yards.
The Trojans remain the top-ranked
team in the nation and are the Pac-10's
only unbeaten team in both the overall
and conference standings.
No. 8 California 45, UCLA 28

No one can stop Cal's offense; it leads
the Pac-10 with 41.6 points per game. The
defensively challenged Bruins certainly
couldn't, although they did well to put 28
points on the board against a defense al
lowing just 17.2 points per game.
The Bruins (4-2,2-1) yield 252.7 rush
ing yards per game, by far the worst mark
in the Pac-10, and Cal's (4-1,2-1) star tail
back J.J. Arrington hit them up for 206
yards and two touchdowns on 29 carries
Saturday. To make matters worse for vis
iting UCLA, Cal's other ballcarriers
chipped in another 99 yards on just 12
carries.
Aaron Rodgers compounded those
difficulties by completing 19-of-29 passes
for 260 yards and four touchdowns with
out being intercepted. Geoff Mac Arthur
