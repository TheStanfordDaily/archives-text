## Here's who to blame if the Sox end up losing 
### 
Five hours and forty-nine minutes. I
dealt with the entire range of human
emotion from 2:23 p.m. until 8:12 p.m.
Monday afternoon, and it has already
been blocked out by something even bigger.
Immediately after Fox put up a graphic
proclaiming Monday night's Red Sox-Yan-

kees game the longest post
season contest in history,
David Ortiz ended it with a
single, bringing the Sox
back from the dead and
sending the series back to
New York for Game 6 last
night â€” a game that proved
that the Red Sox can win,
contrary to all reason.
The most basic way to

win in the postseason is to play to your
strengths, and only one of these two teams
does that well. Monday's game was a prime
example of this.
The Red Sox have a strong lineup start to
finish (hell, last year's AL batting champ is
hitting eighth), and began hitting well once
Yankees starter Mike Mussina left the game.
So, of course, Boston manager Terry
Francona decided that he needed to take
counterintuitive risks to win the game, when
the momentum was already headed in the
Sox' direction.
The Sox also had a crowd behind them so
intense I could almost see them fingering the
arsenic-laced Kool-Aid cups behind their
seats, ready to commit mass suicide in the
event of a loss. Once they tied it up, you knew
the Red Sox were going to win this game, un
less they gave it away.
And that's precisely what Francona at
tempted to do.
In a potentially game-winning inning, if
you have a singles-and-doubles contact hitter
(Orlando Cabrera) at the plate and your best
baserunner (Johnny Damon) on first with no
outs, there is no excuse for not bunting him
over. None.
It boggles my mind why managers consis
tently refuse to sacrifice runners over late in
games. The sacrifice would have put the Sox'
best hitter at the plate with a runner in scor-
