## Here's who to blame if the Sox end up losing 
### 
Five hours and forty-nine minutes. I
dealt with the entire range of human
emotion from 2:23 p.m. until 8:12 p.m.
Monday afternoon, and it has already
been blocked out by something even bigger.
Immediately after Fox put up a graphic
proclaiming Monday night's Red Sox-Yan-

kees game the longest post
season contest in history,
David Ortiz ended it with a
single, bringing the Sox
back from the dead and
sending the series back to
New York for Game 6 last
night — a game that proved
that the Red Sox can win,
contrary to all reason.
The most basic way to

win in the postseason is to play to your
strengths, and only one of these two teams
does that well. Monday's game was a prime
example of this.
The Red Sox have a strong lineup start to
finish (hell, last year's AL batting champ is
hitting eighth), and began hitting well once
Yankees starter Mike Mussina left the game.
So, of course, Boston manager Terry
Francona decided that he needed to take
counterintuitive risks to win the game, when
the momentum was already headed in the
Sox' direction.
The Sox also had a crowd behind them so
intense I could almost see them fingering the
arsenic-laced Kool-Aid cups behind their
seats, ready to commit mass suicide in the
event of a loss. Once they tied it up, you knew
the Red Sox were going to win this game, un
less they gave it away.
And that's precisely what Francona at
tempted to do.
In a potentially game-winning inning, if
you have a singles-and-doubles contact hitter
(Orlando Cabrera) at the plate and your best
baserunner (Johnny Damon) on first with no
outs, there is no excuse for not bunting him
over. None.
It boggles my mind why managers consis
tently refuse to sacrifice runners over late in
games. The sacrifice would have put the Sox'
best hitter at the plate with a runner in scor-


Dan NUCarthy
ing position and eliminated the
threat of a double play — which had
already ended a Boston scoring op
portunity in the seventh and would
do so again in the eleventh inning.
Instead, Francona had Damon
attempt to steal second. Of course,
Yankees catcher Jorge Posada
threw a pea to second to nail him,
Cabrera made an out, and Manny
Ramirez had to hit with the bases
empty.
Granted, Cabrera was squaring
to bunt, but why would you put
Damon at risk on a fastball count? 1
think the only way Francona could
have more obviously taken the bat
out of Ramirez's hands here would
be if he had walked out of*the
dugout and put Ben Affleck in the
on-deck circle.
From the ninth inning on, the
Red Sox had only one inning in
which they didn't put a runner on
base. In three of those innings, bunt
situations came up to bite them;
they either opted not to bunt or did
it poorly (see; Damon's popup in
the eleventh).
As a former two-hitter and the
son of a fundamentals-oriented
baseball coach, failed bunt attempts
make mv stomach wrench much in

the same way it does when I see
commercials for "My Big Fat Ob
noxious Boss," though I do occa
sionally identify with the line, "I
think I could kill you."
Ultimately, the Red Sox won,
but it was most definitely not be
cause of their execution.
When you're in a close game
against a team as good as the Yan
kees, you have to play situational
baseball to win. The reason the
Yankees have won so many titles of
late isn't because they purchase the
best players — it's because they ex
ecute well and manage the game
well.
Managing a baseball team isn't
even something that's remarkably
difficult; it's mostly playing per
centages and knowing your own
players.
This is something Francona has
consistently failed to do in this se
ries, appearing more interested in
the contest he apparently has with
Mike Timlin: to see who can get
mouth cancer first by placing entire
tins of Copenhagen Long Cut in
each cheek.
In any case, things still looked
like the Yankees will finish out.
Monday was nice, but I still didn't

Sit down, Yankee fans;
the call was correct

believe.
But last night? Last night taught
me more than fundamental base
hall ever could have.
For one thing, I learned that
Alex Rodriguez is willing to at
tempt to cheat by slapping the ball
out of Bronson Arroyo's glove with
all the masculinity of Christopher
Lowell.
More importantly, though, I
learned that the Red Sox could go
into the lion's den and silence thou
sands of Yankees fans whose boor
ish behavior after an obviously cor
rect call almost forced a stoppage of
the game
Maybe the Sox actually can beat
the Yankees by waiting around for
the three-run homer, as Mark Bell
horn so gloriously proved.
And maybe now New York will
finally shut up.

if you would like to hear about why
the Sox could have really actually
blown the series — and then didn't.
And how that caused Dan to stay up
a whole hour later than he could
have last night.
Five hours and forty-nine minutes. I
dealt with the entire range of human
emotion from 2:23 p.m. until 8:12 p.m.
Monday afternoon, and it has already
been blocked out by something even bigger.
Immediately after Fox put up a graphic
proclaiming Monday night's Red Sox-Yan-

kees game the longest post
season contest in history,
David Ortiz ended it with a
single, bringing the Sox
back from the dead and
sending the series back to
New York for Game 6 last
night — a game that proved
that the Red Sox can win,
contrary to all reason.
The most basic way to

win in the postseason is to play to your
strengths, and only one of these two teams
does that well. Monday's game was a prime
example of this.
The Red Sox have a strong lineup start to
finish (hell, last year's AL batting champ is
hitting eighth), and began hitting well once
Yankees starter Mike Mussina left the game.
So, of course, Boston manager Terry
Francona decided that he needed to take
counterintuitive risks to win the game, when
the momentum was already headed in the
Sox' direction.
The Sox also had a crowd behind them so
intense I could almost see them fingering the
arsenic-laced Kool-Aid cups behind their
seats, ready to commit mass suicide in the
event of a loss. Once they tied it up, you knew
the Red Sox were going to win this game, un
less they gave it away.
And that's precisely what Francona at
tempted to do.
In a potentially game-winning inning, if
you have a singles-and-doubles contact hitter
(Orlando Cabrera) at the plate and your best
baserunner (Johnny Damon) on first with no
outs, there is no excuse for not bunting him
over. None.
It boggles my mind why managers consis
tently refuse to sacrifice runners over late in
games. The sacrifice would have put the Sox'
best hitter at the plate with a runner in scor-


Dan NUCarthy
ing position and eliminated the
threat of a double play — which had
already ended a Boston scoring op
portunity in the seventh and would
do so again in the eleventh inning.
Instead, Francona had Damon
attempt to steal second. Of course,
Yankees catcher Jorge Posada
threw a pea to second to nail him,
Cabrera made an out, and Manny
Ramirez had to hit with the bases
empty.
Granted, Cabrera was squaring
to bunt, but why would you put
Damon at risk on a fastball count? 1
think the only way Francona could
have more obviously taken the bat
out of Ramirez's hands here would
be if he had walked out of*the
dugout and put Ben Affleck in the
on-deck circle.
From the ninth inning on, the
Red Sox had only one inning in
which they didn't put a runner on
base. In three of those innings, bunt
situations came up to bite them;
they either opted not to bunt or did
it poorly (see; Damon's popup in
the eleventh).
As a former two-hitter and the
son of a fundamentals-oriented
baseball coach, failed bunt attempts
make mv stomach wrench much in

the same way it does when I see
commercials for "My Big Fat Ob
noxious Boss," though I do occa
sionally identify with the line, "I
think I could kill you."
Ultimately, the Red Sox won,
but it was most definitely not be
cause of their execution.
When you're in a close game
against a team as good as the Yan
kees, you have to play situational
baseball to win. The reason the
Yankees have won so many titles of
late isn't because they purchase the
best players — it's because they ex
ecute well and manage the game
well.
Managing a baseball team isn't
even something that's remarkably
difficult; it's mostly playing per
centages and knowing your own
players.
This is something Francona has
consistently failed to do in this se
ries, appearing more interested in
the contest he apparently has with
Mike Timlin: to see who can get
mouth cancer first by placing entire
tins of Copenhagen Long Cut in
each cheek.
In any case, things still looked
like the Yankees will finish out.
Monday was nice, but I still didn't

Sit down, Yankee fans;
the call was correct

believe.
But last night? Last night taught
me more than fundamental base
hall ever could have.
For one thing, I learned that
Alex Rodriguez is willing to at
tempt to cheat by slapping the ball
out of Bronson Arroyo's glove with
all the masculinity of Christopher
Lowell.
More importantly, though, I
learned that the Red Sox could go
into the lion's den and silence thou
sands of Yankees fans whose boor
ish behavior after an obviously cor
rect call almost forced a stoppage of
the game
Maybe the Sox actually can beat
the Yankees by waiting around for
the three-run homer, as Mark Bell
horn so gloriously proved.
And maybe now New York will
finally shut up.
