### KAIYA REEVE STAFF WRITER 
Fresh off finishing play at the Icy
Flot / ITA Ail-American Champi
onships held last week, the Stanford
men's tennis team will grace Berkeley
with its presence for the Wilson / Inter
collegiate Tennis Association West
Men's Regional Championships this
weekend.
The annual tournament will he held
from Oct. 22 through Oct. 26 and will he
hosted by the Bears. This is the qualify
ing event for the second of the three
major tournaments in store for the
team this season, following the All-
American Championships and preced
ing the NCAA championships in the
spring.
No. 20 junior KC Corkery, junior
James Fade, and No. 2 senior Sam War
burg all participated in last year's tour
nament. but had a disappointing show
ing partly due to nagging injuries.
Much healthier and more prepared
this time around, the Cardinal team will

look to improve its results and advance
to the ITA National Intercollegiate In
door Championships held at the Uni
versity of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Only
the singles finalists and the doubles
champions of the West Regional
Championships will be eligible to com
pete in the national tournament, which
will take place from Nov. 4 through
Nov. 7.
Because the season has just started,
head coach John Whitlinger will use
this tournament as a chance to gauge his
players' exact weaknesses and
strengths.
"It'll be fun as they play matches to
see what strengths they have,"
Whitlinger said. "The guys have been
working hard on things, and the guys
I've worked with before are progress
ing and still doing well. This is a good
tournament because we can watch our
guys play in matches and see how
they're progressing."
Players from all over the West Coast
will hit the courts at Cal on Friday
morning. Participating schools include

University of Nevada, University of
Portland, UC-Davis, Oregon, Wash
ington, Gonzaga, University of San
Francisco, Pacific, Fresno State, St.
Mary's and University of Hawaii.
In total, there are nine men's re
gional tournaments occurring within
the next two weekends to determine
who makes the cut for the national
championships.
The Stanford men have been play
ing matches in practice to prepare
themselves for the competition this
weekend, and Whitlinger likes what he
sees so far.
"We've just been hitting tennis balls
and working on point situations,"
Whitlinger said. "It's still early, but our
last week of practice has been great.
We've really worked hard in our fitness
but we really have a long way to go. "
Warburg, named the Intercolle
giate Tennis Association's Player To
Watch at the end of last season, was
ousted in the first round of last year's
tournament. Since then, he has im
proved his ranking by 69 spots, from

No. 71 to No. 2.
However, Warburg will not be play
ing the regional qualifying tournament
this weekend. The Stanford senior re
ceived an automatic placement in the
national championships after making it
to the finals of the Icy Hot / ITA Ail-
American Championships.
The rest of the Stanford team will be
participating in doubles and singles, in
cluding players Corkery, freshman Phil
Kao, sophomore Eric McKean, sopho
more Nico Martinez, senior Phil Sheng,
sophomore James Wan and junior Jon
Wong.
The doubles teams will be Corkery /
Warburg, Sheng / Wan, McKean /
Wong, and Kao / Martinez.
Whitlinger is looking forward to see
ing his team in action at Berkeley, but is
less confident in the weather.
"The draw hasn't come through yet,
but there are over one hundred players
in the tournament, so it's going to be a
fun tournament. 1 just hope the weath
er holds so we don't have to find an in
door court."
