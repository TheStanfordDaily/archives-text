# Recycling program takes off

### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA 
Newspapers piled two feet high and soda
cans stacked in a corner do not make attractive
dorm-room decorations. But such sights are
common in the rooms of recycling-conscious
residents. While every dorm room comes with
trash cans, students who want to recycle usual
ly have to improvise.
But last weekend, separating plastic and
glass and other waste got easier, thanks to a
campus-wide in-room recycling program.
Senior Bonnie Johnson, the founder of the
program, and a group of volunteers from Stu
dents fora Sustainable Stanford delivered blue
recycling bins to nearly every undergraduate
room.
The recycling bins, like the trash bins al
ready in dorm rooms, belong to Student Hous
ing, which is footing the bill for the recycling
program. The bins cost around four dollars
each, and Johnson said about 28(X) of them
were distributed last weekend. She said anoth
er small shipment of bins was being ordered
because there were not enough bins to cover all
the rooms on campus.
Johnson said that obtaining the funding was
the greatest obstacle in implementing the pro
gram throughout undergraduate residences.
"The main problem was convincing Hous
ing that the program would work and that they
should fully fund it," she said. "Eventually,
persistence paid off."

the program to graduate housing.
"Recycling is important because it
keeps reusable materials from going into
landfills, and instead makes them into new
products," she said. "It is one of the most
basic parts of sustainable living."
Johnson worked closely with Julie
Muir, director of the Stanford Recycling
Center, to see that the program succeeded.
Muir said the University currently di
verts 54 percent of its waste from the land
fill. However, she said that she hopes this
new in-dorm program will help raise that
percentage.
"I have been advocating the in-room
recycling program for several years." she
said. "Many other universities supply a re
cycling bin in student rooms like they sup
ply a trash can. It creates parity between
trash and recycling. 1 think it will be help
ful to increase recyclinu in the student

housing areas."
Johnson first started working with in
room recycling during her freshman year
by putting together a pilot program in the
Stern Hall's Donner and Larkin dorms.
"Based on the pilot program, I know
that a lot of people who wouldn't other
wise recycle take advantage of the bins,"
she said. "Many people won't take the ini
tiative to find their own recycling contain
ers, but will use them if provided."
Johnson said that she and the volun
teers received positive responses from stu
dents about the program.
"Volunteers reported only a few peo
ple who objected to having recycling bins,
and many people began using them right
away" she said.
Freshman Katrina Kershner said she
was thrilled about the implementation of
the bins.

"My roommates and 1 had already la
beled the four trash bins we were given â€”
two for trash, one for paper and one for
cans and bottles. Unfortunately, we kept
getting confused between the paper and
trash bins, but now the blue bin is for paper
and we have an extra trash can."
"It makes me very happy to see that the
University is trying to make recycling bins
a permanent fixture in dorm rooms, as a
garbage can is," said senior Eric Chase.
"Even if someone does not pay much at
tention to recycling in general, if there is a
recycling bin in their room, they will see
just how easy it is to recycle and will be
more inclined to do it."
Some students, however, said that even
with the implementation of the bins, recy
cling was still too much of a hassle. How
ever, these students refused to be quoted
in the Daily.

Most students happy about bins; some complain
about the inconvenience of sorting, separating

According to Johnson, students are
required to put paper, drink containers
and other recyclable materials into
their recycling bins instead of their
trash cans.
When the bins get full, students take
them down to the large recycling contain
ers outside, usually near the dumpsters,
and separate the materials into appropri
ate containers.
Jim, who asked that only his first name
be used, commented that he does not have
the time to sort and separate recyclables.
Other students, although excited about
the project, said they have still not re
ceived a bin for their room.
Johnson said that she hopes the pro
gram will get students into the habit of re
cycling, so that they will become life-long
recyclers and think more about how to live
in an environmentally sustainable way.
