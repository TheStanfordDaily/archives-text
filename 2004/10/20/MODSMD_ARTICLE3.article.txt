# Recycling program takes off

Newspapers piled two feet high and soda
cans stacked in a corner do not make attractive
dorm-room decorations. But such sights are
common in the rooms of recycling-conscious
residents. While every dorm room comes with
trash cans, students who want to recycle usual
ly have to improvise.
But last weekend, separating plastic and
glass and other waste got easier, thanks to a
campus-wide in-room recycling program.
Senior Bonnie Johnson, the founder of the
program, and a group of volunteers from Stu
dents fora Sustainable Stanford delivered blue
recycling bins to nearly every undergraduate
room.
The recycling bins, like the trash bins al
ready in dorm rooms, belong to Student Hous
ing, which is footing the bill for the recycling
program. The bins cost around four dollars
each, and Johnson said about 28(X) of them
were distributed last weekend. She said anoth
er small shipment of bins was being ordered
because there were not enough bins to cover all
the rooms on campus.
Johnson said that obtaining the funding was
the greatest obstacle in implementing the pro
gram throughout undergraduate residences.
"The main problem was convincing Hous
ing that the program would work and that they
should fully fund it," she said. "Eventually,
persistence paid off."
Johnson is currently working on expanding
