### XIN XIE 
Sometime in November, Stan
ford Hillel will have a new home on
the Row at the Harold and Libby
Ziff Center for Jewish Life. The uni
versity granted Hillel the lease to the
new building at 565 Mayfield several
years ago, contingent upon Hillel's
ability to renovate the old home.
Executive Director Adina
Danzig said that Hillel, with the help
of alumnus and donor John Arrilla

ga, is planning new construction on
the site fora larger programming
and student lounge area, Jewish
prayer space and Kosher dining
room. The total cost of the renova
tion and construction is $15 million,
some of which the group is still trying
to obtain from private donors.
Danzig said the Ziff Center is an
improvement that will entice some
prospective students to attend
Stanford.
"While prospective students who

have visited Stanford in recent years
have been impressed by the breadth
and depth of the programs offered
by Hillel, many who are looking fora
thriving Jewish community have
found Hillel's current space discour
aging," Danzig said.
For over 30 years, the group has
been using a 7(X)-square-foot space
in Old Union, but Danzig said the
space has proved woefully inade-
quate for Stanford's large Jewish communi
ty
The prospect ol moving has been greeted
with enthusiasm by Hillel students, who say
the home will be a symbol of the proud anil
dynamic Jewish community and that it will
grant Hillel more publicity and accessibility.
"We've been in a basement for years, so
the idea of finally coming into our own in a
beautiful house in an amazing location is
thrilling," said sophomore Kim Atura,
Shabbat Chair on the Jewish Leadership
Council.
"We will be able to expand our current
programming to enhance the social, cultur
al, and religious aspects of Jewish life at
Stanford." added junior Carla Fenves, pres
ident of the Jewish Leadership Council.
Moreover, students say the new center
will provide a more open forum for the ex
pression of ideas and allow students to just

hang out.
"The center will facilitate students' gath
ering informally â€” a critical element of
community building," Danzig said.
Since its inception in the 19505, Hillel has
been a hub of the Stanford Jewish commu
nity. It currently sponsors over 300 pro
grams each year in conjunction with over a
dozen other student, campus, and commu
nity groups. Their activities run the gamut
from Friday night community dinners, pub
nights and non-religious speaker events to
religious services and ceremonies.
Publicity about the new center has al
ready generated waves among new and old
members of the Jewish community.
"I have already partaken in the vibrant
religious community here, and the new Hil
lel center will allow me to further expand my
religious horizons," said freshman David
Steinhardt.
