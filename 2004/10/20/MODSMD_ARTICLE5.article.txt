# Journals promote ethnic expression
## 
### BEA SANFORD 
Senior Howie Chiou first
thought of founding an Asian-
American literary magazine late in
his sophomore year. The following
year, he lived in Okada with then
junior Dennis Kuo and then-fresh
man Jerry Zee, two other students
who shared Chiou's vision. Togeth
er, the three gave shape to the idea,
and the first issue of Reorient,

which featured a nighttime photo
of Okada on the cover, premiered
in the spring of 2004.
Reorient is the most recent eth
nic literary magazine to emerge on
the Stanford campus and joins a
number of others, such as Engima
magazine, established in the early
1970s as a forum for African-
American expression, and the Chi
cano literary journal Expresi6n.
In creating a magazine for

Asian-American art and literature,
the founders of Reorient say they
are filling a large gap at Stanford.
While the University has other stu
dent literary publications such as
Mind's Eye and Womenspeak, the
staff of Reorient said they saw
Asian Americans as lacking a suffi
cient outlet for creative expression.
"Our community isn't generally
associated with art." C'hiou, the current editor in chief,
explained. "Now we have a forum for representation."
In the same vein, senior Ajani Husbands, the co
president of Enigma, described its founding as giving
"a voice to black students in the arts" and"a chance to
express themselves without fear of judgement."
Husbands said that Enigma gives a context to
artists writing about black issues, something that non
ethnic literary magazines such as Mind's Eye, Wom
enspeak or Masque cannot do.
Expresion was created for similar reasons. Junior
Joseles De La Cruz, who has worked with Expresion
since its revival his freshman year, commented on the
value of an ethnically oriented magazine.
"A lot of the submissions are in Spanish, and many
focus on social-political issues specific to the Chicano
community," he said. "There needed to be a forum for
that."
However, both De La Cruz, and Zee said that it is
often difficult for their respective publications to find
a committed and well-organized staff.
De La Cruz expressed uncertainty about the future
of Expresion, citing a lack of staff members as the rea
son that the magazine may not publish anything this
year.
With Asian Americans comprising about a quarter
of the student body, designing a magazine to represent
the wide variety of the Asian population proved diffi
cult
Even the name remains controversial today: Ac
cording to Zee, the term "orient" brings to mind
( hina, Japan and Korea, but excludes Southeast Asia
and India.
The word also has negative connotations, Zee said.
But however problematic, the title embodies a central
goal of its founders, who said they wanted to challenge
readers to reconsider their conceptions of art and eth
nicity; in essence, to "reorient" themselves to a new
idea of Asian Americans.
"We wanted to reclaim the term," Chiou explained.
"We wanted to expand the idea of the 'orient.' "
Although Reorient provides a venue for Asian
Americans to express themselves, those on staff said
that the magazine is not restricted to that community.
"The Asian-American community is known by the
outside as being exclusive," said Kuo, Reorient's fi
nancial officer. "But we're not very concerned about
who submits. We want to be open to other view
points."
Senior Jennifer Kong, a writer for Reorient, agreed
that Asian-American topics or styles don't have to
take center stage in the literature.
"My experience as an Asian American definitely
colors my perception of the world and the way I write,
but 1 never let my characters become mouthpieces for
my opinions on particular ethnic issues."
