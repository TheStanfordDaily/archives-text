### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Student Housing and the
Stanford Fire Marshal's Office
kicked off Stanford's first Safety
Awareness Week on Monday in
an effort to provide residents of
graduate and undergraduate
housing with more information
about safety and security.
In conjunction with the new
program, the Fire Marshal's Of
fice will be conducting its annu
al building evacuation drills for
all student housing facilities on
campus today and tomorrow.
Every day this week. Student
Housing is presenting residents
with a different form of "passive
programming." like informa
tional e-mails, to inform stu
dents about safety issues such as
locking dorm room doors and
lofting beds properly.

"We felt it was important to
provide safety information to
our residents in a format be
yond what we have in Housing
Policies and Services," Manager
of Undergraduate Housing Op
erations Imogen Hinds wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily.
"Safety First" flyers that pro
vide overall information on se
curity. fire safety and bed safety
were posted in places such as
bathroom stalls on Monday,
and pamphlets detailing fire
evacuation procedures, fire
policies and emergency phone
numbers were distributed to
student rooms yesterday.
Today, Student Housing will
be working with resident assis
tants to encourage students to
watch a short video called "Get
Out and Stay Alive." Housing

will also be distributing mini flashlights with emer
gency phone numbers to residents who view the video.
An informational e-mail regarding earthquake pre
paredness will be sent out to the student body tomor
row, and on Friday the Fire Marshall's Office will send
an e-mail reviewing how the evacuation drills went.
"We are committed to providing a safe and secure
environment in student housing, but in order to do this,
we need everyone to do their part," Hinds wrote in a
mass e-mail describing Safety Awareness Week. "It is
vital that everyone understands and observes the poli
cies and procedures that foster a safe community for
all."
The annual evacuation drills, which are required by
law in every student housing facility, were originally
scheduled to take place Monday through Thursday,
but the first Monday and Tuesday's drills will have to
be rescheduled due to rain. Weather permitting, the
Fire Marshal's Office says it will still conduct the drills
tonight and tomorrow night. Students will be notified
through Housing Operations when the final two days
of drills are scheduled.
"We encourage everybody's participation," said
University Fire Marshal Joseph Leung. "We don't
want them to just leave the house for the night. The
idea is to keep [residents] safe so if indeed there is a fire,
they know how to react and know where the stairways
are and the emergency assembly points."
Leung said the drills also give his office another op
portunity to evaluate whether fire alarms are loud
enough and whether or not all the safety equipments
are working.
Senior Lyndsie Schmalz said she feels safe in her
dorm but docs not think that people respond quickly to
fire alarms.
Schmalz, who has lived in Haus Mitteleuropa for the
past two years, recounted a time last year when a small
fire was set in the kitchen.
"They had already come and put the fire out by the
time everyone got out of the house," she said.
Hinds emphasized that all students need to be mind
ful of their individual responsibilities in order for the
whole dorm to be safe.
"I do think that many students take safety precau
tions seriously," she said. "Unfortunately, it only takes
one person to be careless, and a community can be put
into jeopardy."
