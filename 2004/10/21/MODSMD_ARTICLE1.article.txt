### JOE SEXTON 
Philip Zelikow. the executive di
rector of the 9/11 Commission, em
phasized the failures of pre-Sept. 11
anti-terrorism measures and the
many weaknesses that remain at a
talk yesterday afternoon at Kresge
Auditorium.
His remarks drew heavily on the
findings and recommendations of
the 9/11 Commission Report,
which he co-authored.
Zelikow. who was invited to
campus by the Stanford Institute
for International Studies and the
World Affairs Council of Northern
California, also spoke about the re
forms that needed to be enacted to
more fully secure the United
States.
"We found that none of the coun
tenneasures made by the United
States in the years preceding 9/11
did anything to even delay the at
tacks," Zelikow said. "We had a na
tional security state that was de
signed to win the Cold War. We had
done so, but we were left incapable
of facing challenges like the ones we
faced on Sept. 11."
Zelikow claimed that the attacks
were a result of an unimaginative
and poorly run intelligence commu
nity.

"History doesn't repeat itself in
Xerox copies, so you have to look
deeper," Zelikow said. "The way
things are with the intelligence com
munity, we are not capable of imple
menting a management strategy to
counter terrorism. We have a gov
ernment that has not yet entered the
21st century when it comes to man
agement."
At times, Zelikow was interrupted
by protesters who loudly voiced their
opposition to him and to President
George W. Bush's administration.
One audience member blew a
referee's whistle and accused the
U.S. government of perpetrating the
attacks. Another called Zelikow a
"scurrilous liar," while another
claimed that Stanford was "complic
it in the 9/11 cover-up."
Event organizers removed the
protesters, and Zelikow coolly re
sponded by saying to the audience,
"Welcome to my world."
The message of the protesters,
who are associated with an organiza
tion called the Northern California 9
/11 Truth Alliance, did not seem to
resonate well with the audience.
"I thought [the protesters] were
disruptive, not effective and annoy
ing," said senior Sheena Chestnut.
"I don't think that the outbursts

were constructive in getting their
message across, nor did I think their
message was very clear in the first
place."
Zelikow used the protesters' dia
tribes as a transition into offering
personal reflections about his expe
rience as an embattled political fig
ure at the helm of a commission in
vestigating an emotionally charged
event.
"I became an outlet [for the
anger of people who suffered on
9/11|," Zelikow said. "I was often
held responsible for all of the things
that went wrong.
" The attacks came from both
sides. I was also attacked from the
light by [a conservative columnist]
who claimed 1 hijacked the commis
sion to attack the Bush administra
tion," he added.

of 9/11 report

He concluded the talk by com
menting on the goals of the commis
sion report and his satisfaction with
the American public's response.
"From the beginning, I wanted
the report to be a book and 1 wanted
it to be in every bookstore in Amer
ica," Zelikow said. "We also wanted
to make sure that we were not writ
ing down to people."
Even several months after its ini
tial release, the 9/11 Commission
Report ranks 30th on USA Today's
best-seller list.
Zelikow said he was elated that
the commission was able to produce
a product that has been widely read
without having to compromise on
the sophistication of the text.
"[The success of the book] shows
that you can write up to people."
