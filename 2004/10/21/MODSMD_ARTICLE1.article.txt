### JOE SEXTON 
Philip Zelikow. the executive di
rector of the 9/11 Commission, em
phasized the failures of pre-Sept. 11
anti-terrorism measures and the
many weaknesses that remain at a
talk yesterday afternoon at Kresge
Auditorium.
His remarks drew heavily on the
findings and recommendations of
the 9/11 Commission Report,
which he co-authored.
Zelikow. who was invited to
campus by the Stanford Institute
for International Studies and the
World Affairs Council of Northern
California, also spoke about the re
forms that needed to be enacted to
more fully secure the United
States.
"We found that none of the coun
tenneasures made by the United
States in the years preceding 9/11
did anything to even delay the at
tacks," Zelikow said. "We had a na
tional security state that was de
signed to win the Cold War. We had
done so, but we were left incapable
of facing challenges like the ones we
faced on Sept. 11."
Zelikow claimed that the attacks
were a result of an unimaginative
and poorly run intelligence commu
nity.

"History doesn't repeat itself in
Xerox copies, so you have to look
deeper," Zelikow said. "The way
things are with the intelligence com
munity, we are not capable of imple
menting a management strategy to
counter terrorism. We have a gov
ernment that has not yet entered the
21st century when it comes to man
agement."
At times, Zelikow was interrupted
by protesters who loudly voiced their
opposition to him and to President
George W. Bush's administration.
One audience member blew a
referee's whistle and accused the
U.S. government of perpetrating the
attacks. Another called Zelikow a
"scurrilous liar," while another
claimed that Stanford was "complic
it in the 9/11 cover-up."
Event organizers removed the
protesters, and Zelikow coolly re
sponded by saying to the audience,
"Welcome to my world."
The message of the protesters,
who are associated with an organiza
tion called the Northern California 9
/11 Truth Alliance, did not seem to
resonate well with the audience.
"I thought [the protesters] were
disruptive, not effective and annoy
ing," said senior Sheena Chestnut.
"I don't think that the outbursts
