# O doctor, where art thou?
## Telemedicine allows doctors to see patients thousands of miles away 
### KENDALL MADDEN 
A patient walks into a clinic in a rural
town in India, talks to a doctor, receives a
diagnosis and a prescription and leaves the
office. Sounds like a normal visit to the
doctor, doesn't it? Except in this case, the
doctor is thousands of miles away and con
versed with the patient via video camera.
Impossible? Don't tell that to Stanford
doctors.
Rather than traveling around the world
to visit patients, American and Indian doc
tors are hoping to revolutionize medicine
in rural areas with a package of technolo
gies known as telemedicine, allowing pa
tients to correspond with a doctor through
videoconferencing, audio communication
technology and e-mail.
Doctors are in desperate need in rural
areas around the world. In many develop
ing countries, the idea of an accessible gen
eral practice doctor is dream â€” a specialist
is even less likely.
In rural India, for example, there is one
doctor on average for every 15,500 people.
Specialists are only found in the metropoli
tan areas that are not accessible for the ma
jority of the rural population.
Many enterprises are springing up on
the basis of new telemedicine technology
to alleviate the scarcity of doctors and spe
cialists in these other areas of the world.
One such telemedicine enterprise is cur
rently under development at Stanford in
conjunction with the Digital Vision Fel
lows Program. The Global Telemedicine

Project, initiated and directed by Dr.
Renee J. Chin and Dr. Jack Higgins, is an
innovative attempt to mobilize the skills of
doctors in the wealthiest countries to pro-

vide care for individuals in developing
countries.

The Project is working with a com
munity in Kuppam. India, in partner
ship with Hewlett Packard's E-lnclu
sion program. HP's program consists
of two vans equipped with computers
that circulate through the community,
providing Internet access and educa
tional programs.
A third van is being designed as a
mobile medical clinic and will contain
computers for the purpose of
telemedicine consultations.
"Our vision for the Global
Telemedicine Project is to develop a
database of physicians from all over
the world to serve patients in rural
communities like India, South Africa
or Vietnam," Chin said.

"Where programs like Doctors
Without Borders and the Peace Corps re
quire volunteer health practitioners to
travel for extended periods of time, the
Global Telemedicine Project will ask vol
unteers to commit to only about four to
eight hours per month," Chin said.
Most importantly, doctors, specialists
and health practitioners will be able to
work from their own home or office"
The Project is modeled after a domestic
program, founded by Higgins, called the
House Call Foundation. Using the similar

telemedicine, House Call connects a free
clinic in San Jose to a diabetes treatment
center in Redwood City.
The technology itself is simple, accord-

ing to visions held by the Higgins and Chin
plan. The Project will work in conjunction
with Video House Call Network, the oper
ator of a Web-based telemedicine system
of audio- and video-conferencing.
In some cases a live, real-time consulta
tion may not be possible and will be substi
tuted with a "store-and-forward" system of
video clips, photographs and text mes
sages. Since the information can be trans
mitted over the Internet, the only hard
ware required is a laptop computer and

small video camera, the latter of which
could be acquired used, costing approxi
mately $50 to 250.
According to Higgins, the House Call pro
gram has been extremely successful.

He said he hopes for the same positive
results from the new global initiative.
Before the project may be imple
mented, significant research into the
region and the community of Kuppam
must be carried out.
Chin, an ethnographer whose re
search has centered on the role of tech
nology in community dynamics and
healthcare systems, emphasized the
need for an ecological perspective in
development of the project.
"Approaching the project from an
'ecological perspective' means that we
are interested in the relationships and
interactions between a people and
their environment as part of their rela
tionship to health and health care,"
Chin explained.
"For example, health practices and

caring for one's health is done within social
networks, that is, family, friends, and com
munity activities," she continued. "Compli
ance with medicines and learning new
health practices such as washing hands
more often may have more success if the so
cial network is included in the prescription."-
Though the Global Telemedicine Pro
ject is not the first such program to use
telemedicine technology to reach rural, de
veloping communities, it differs from exist
ing programs in that it hopes to provide di

rect care from doctor to patient,
Telemedicine initiatives have been in
creasingly popular in India as method of
improving rural healthcare, but the struc
ture has largely been to provide specialist
skills in regions where there is only a gen
eral practice doctor. Doctors in rural set
tings rarely have the special training neces
sary for certain procedures and diagnoses.
Telemedicine is often a cheaper alterna
tive to sending specialists to the rural re
gions to practice. Such initiatives within
India have, therefore, aimed at providing
rural patients with the opportunity to be
examined by a specialist if a rural doctor is
unqualified, and they also provide the
means of instructing rural doctors in skills
that they might not have and training them
for some specialist procedures.
Telemedicine technology also enables
rural doctors to consult with their urban
peers in the process of a surgery or compli
cated procedure.
The Global Telemedicine Project hopes
to reach out to even more of the under
served population by eliminating the need
for the on-site doctor.
Chin and Higgins plan on having the
telemedicine system up and running by
December of this year, with the ultimate
goal of expanding to other developing
countries.
"When I let myself dream about it,"
Higgins said, "I imagine this growing big
and spreading out: A revolution of the way
healthcare is provided the world over."
