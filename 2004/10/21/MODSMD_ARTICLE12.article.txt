## Where's the (antibiotic- and hormone-free) beef? At your nearby dining hall 
### LAUREN GONG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
I eat beef.
There, I said it. In an age where food has be
come politicized and everyone seems concerned
with what they put on their plate, sometimes it is
hard to admit what one does eat.
Beef in particular has been a hot topic ever since
doctors found out that tainted

meat could wreak havoc on your
brain.
So when I saw the new adver
tisements in Wilbur Dining
promising to serve only hormone
and antibiotic-free beef, I was
pleased Stanford Dining Services
was taking an active interest in the
health of the student body.
As a former vegetarian, I am
still wary of animal products.
When I was in high school, I
read the book "A Diet fora
New America" by John Rob
bins, the would-be inheritor of
the ice cream company Baskin
Robbins had he not instead
turned vegan and spent his life
advocating for an animal-prod
uct-free existence.
The book was convincing,
mainly emphasizing the dan
gers associated with the hor
mone and chemical levels in
meat and dairy products. Dur
ing my freshman year, I took a
seminar on modern plagues,
which reconfirmed my vegetar
ianism after we spent a week
analyzing Mad Cow Disease.

Unfortunately vegetarianism proved difficult
while traveling over the summers, so I let meat
re-enter my life. But I have never been able to
forget the disturbing levels of chemicals — in
cluding dioxin (an industrial waste product and
possible carcinogenic) and antibiotics — found
in the beef of the massive meat-producing facto
ries our cattle ranches have become.
This year, in response to the overwhelming
requests of students, Stanford Dining has begun
to provide organic entrees at all of its residential
dining facilities. These food items include pro
duce from local farmers who use sustainable
agriculture production techniques.
Obviously, organic produce is comparably
more expensive to your regular selection of fruits
and vegetables. But according to Rafi Taherian,
the current executive director for Residential
Dining Services, Stanford Dining is doing its best
to ensure students have as much choice as possi

ble while maintaining fiscal responsibility.
"The challenges lay primarily in price and
availability," Taherian said. "Our purchasing de
partment has been tasked with ensuring that,
whenever feasible, these products become part
of the daily menus and options."
Following this trend toward healthier food
options, Stanford Dining introduced its new beef
policy, advertising it on dining tables across the

university.
Taherian informed me that the U.S. Depart
ment of Agriculture began its organic certifica
tion program on Oct. 21, 2002. He wanted to be
clear that Stanford's new program does not pro
vide 100-percent organic meat due to the ex
pense, but that Dining services is making small
steps toward an ultimate goal of providing free
range, organic meat to students.
Still, now all beef served at Wilbur will be hor
mone- and antibiotic-free, which is a big step in
itself. But why, you may find yourself asking,
would these chemicals be in meat in the first
place?
Hormones — such a growth hormone — are
given to cows to increase the rate of growth and
milk production. While these hormones also
occur naturally in humans, many researchers are
concerned that excess intake may lead to a high
er risk of certain types of cancer.

One of Taherian's most convincing pieces of
evidence for the elimination of hormones in
beef is a study detailed in Robbins' book that
suggests that the growth hormone in meat prod
ucts has led to earlier physical development in
young girls. While other studies have found
problems with these results (girls may be devel
oping earlier because of higher percentages of
body fat), there is still much we don't know

about the long-term effects of
eating unnatural hormones.
Antibiotics are often added
to animal feed to prevent bac
terial diseases. There is little
evidence, however, that adding
buckets of antibiotics does any
good — in fact, it may do more
harm than anything. Some
strains of lethal antibiotic-re
sistant bacteria have been
found in uncooked beef —
probably a result of excessive
antibiotic use.
I'm not advocating to go
crazy with the beef now. Red
meat is, as we all know, still
high in saturated fat compared
to white meat such as turkey or
chicken, but it is good to know
that the meat we are eating is
comparably healthier than the
meat served at popular fast
food chains.
This is still a commendable
step. I praise Stanford Dining
for its efforts to raise the stan
dards of meat products and an
swer the concerns of many food
-conscious students. Further

more. Dining Services is sup
porting a budding industry — organics — that
is more sustainable and environmentally re
sponsible. Next time you're at Wilbur, pick up
an organic apple — you'll be eating something
healthier for you, and you'll be supporting an
industry that cares for our environment.
According to Taherian, Stanford Dining
was recently declared a "Green Business" by
Santa Clara County, the first university in the
nation to achieve this title. So while you may
not like every single thing served at Wilbur
or Flo Mo Dining, be proud of our dining
halls: They are leaders in the path toward
healthier and more environmentally friendly
food production.
