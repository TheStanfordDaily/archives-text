# Staying safe
## Tri-Delt's Full Moon on the Quad health series preps women for next week's Cardinal tradition 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Seniors have been buzzing about
the infamous night for weeks. The
freshmen have as well, albeit in more
terrified murmurs.
The event? The age-old Cardinal
tradition of Full Moon on the Quad.
While most students are looking ex
citedly toward the moon-lit night of
lip-locking (and gawking), certain
groups on campus are making sure
the night stays fun — and safe —
for those involved. Of particular
concern to some students and ad
ministrators is the possibility that of
sexual assault before, during or after
the event.
To prepare women — particu
larly freshman girls — for the night,
Tri-Delt is holding various work
shops about women's health and
safety issues related to Full Moon.
The series, titled "Crescents on the
Quad," will include a self-defense
workshop held tonight in the Tri-
Delt lounge at 7 p.m., run by United
Studios of Self Defense.
"We hope to have a good
turnout, especially from freshmen,
because we think it is worthwhile
for young women to learn how to
protect themselves," said sopho
more Christine Harding, one of the
coordinators of the events at Tri-
Delt. "I think knowledge of self
defense is the best way to increase
your odds of survival if you are at
tacked or taken against your will.
Statistics have shown that those
who fight for their lives are more
likely to survive an abduction."
Tri-Delt representatives will also
hold an informative display in White
Plaza tomorrow at noon, a seminar
focused on health issues related to
Full Moon on Monday at 8:30 p.m. in
the Tri-Delt lounge and a coed dis

cussion on Tuesday at 6 p.m.
While alcohol is not allowed at
Full Moon, as the Quad is officially
an alcohol-free area, many students
drink before heading out to the mid
night event, and given that alcohol
often reduces judgment and inhibi
tions, what could begin as a kiss
could easily lead to unwanted sexual
attention.
Indeed, alcohol is implicated in
many incidents of sexual assault. A
survey of women at 119 schools na
tionwide published in February by
the Harvard School of Public Health
found that nearly one in 20 women
reported being sexually assaulted
since the beginning of the 2003-2004
academic school year. Over 70 per
cent of those assaults occurred while
the woman was heavily intoxicated.
Absolute Fun coordinators have
organized security for the event and
have planned for the attendance of
nine security officials, more than 45
student monitors and more than 10
University officials, according to se
nior Joey Natoli, chair of Absolute
Fun. Additionally, many Resident
Assistants and Peer Health Educa
tors will attend the event with their
residents.
"Any major University event will
always involve the Stanford police,"
Natoli said. "And this year, we have
greatly improved the lighting at the
venue to increase safety."
While there will be plenty of se
curity at the event, Harding said be
lieves that the risk of sexual assault
on campus is actually pretty low.
"As far as safety on campus is con
cerned, I don't think there is as much to
worry about as in urban areas. At the
same time, I feel like college is the
place where you learn how to be an
adult in the real world, and part of this
is learning how to protect yourself in
the event of a dangerous situation."
