## Op-Ed Holocaust event representative of rising tide of anti-Semitic rhetoric 
### NATHAN MINTZ 
Last night, Muslim Student
Awareness Network and the Coali
tion for Justice in the Middle East
hosted an event entitled "Surviving
the Holocaust: Witnessing History
Repeated." At this event, Hedy Ep
stein used her credibility as a Holo
caust survivor to draw parallels be
tween the horrors that befell Jews
and other minorities in Nazi Ger
many and the Arab-Israeli conflict.
While some have expected the
Jewish community to stand by and
accept this analogy, the implications
of Epstein's insensitive remarks
have only resulted in hurt,confusion
and anger. Why is it that discrimina
tion is so socially unacceptable and
outrageous except when it comes in
the form of anti-Semitism?
Epstein's rhetoric of drawing
comparisons of the initial stages of
the Holocaust to the current situation
in Gaza and the West Bank simply
lacks any sense of moral proportion.
While the situation is indeed
tragic for both sides, the Israeli De
fense Forces' legitimate self-de
fense of its citizens against the daily
threat of homicide bombings and
rocket attacks cannot be compared
to the systematic, meticulously
planned and executed mass murder
of six million Jews and other minori
ties at the hands of the 20th centu
ry's most evil regime.

To do so is outright demonization
of Jews that serves no purpose other
than to engender hostility between
Palestinians and Israelis, Jews and
Muslims. It is language that aims to
divide us, not unite us. Sadly, it rep
resents only one piece of what is a
much larger trend of anti-Semitism
on college campuses today.
Epstein is a proud member of the
International Solidarity Movement
("Holocaust survivor protests wall."
Oct. 20). The ISM is a group devot
ed to promoting the annihilation of
Israel, which one ISM chapter head
referred to as "an apartheid, colo
nial settler state."
The group's student wing, the
Palestinian Solidarity Movement,
has been one of the largest perpetra
tors of anti-Semitism on college
campuses, with direct ties to terror
ist organizations such as Islamic-
Jihad and the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.
At the University of Michigan
PSM conference in 2002, partici
pants chanted "chrad al-yahud,"
"annihilate the Jews," in Arabic.
Sami al Arian, who was recently in
dicted on charges of being the lead
er of an American cell of Islamic
Jihad, spoke at the same Michigan
conference.
The group's message that "Zion
ism is racism" is being promoted on
campuses throughout the country
with intense fervor, most recently at

the PSM conference at Duke Uni
versity this past weekend, leaving
many American Jews feeling intimi
dated and persecuted in what should
he a very academic, tolerant and
open environment.
The atmosphere currently on
campuses is not one in which a con
structive dialogue about the conflict
can legitimately take place.
In lieu of MSAN and the Coali
tion for Justice's desire to engage us
in constructive dialogue, we call
upon them to publicly come out and
do what very few Palestinian soli
darity groups have managed to do:
acknowledge the right of Israel to
exist as a Jewish state alongside a fu
ture Palestinian state and proclaim
their desire fora peaceful solution in
which the security of both parties is
respected; to condemn suicide ter
ror as a horrific tactic which is never
morally justifiable; and finally, to
condemn anti-zionism and anti-
Semitism as hateful ideologies with
noplace in the marketplace of ideas.
This should be the starting point
if we are seeking to have a construc
tive dialogue about the conflict, not
with Hedy Epstein.
