# THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, BUD
## What are you, really? 
### SARA INES CALDERON STAFF COLUMNIST 
This is a question that has fol
lowed me around my entire
life. People seem unable —
or perhaps unwilling — to
believe that there are such things as
light-skinned Mexicans (Mexico was
colonized by the Spanish, duh). And
they hammer in their beliefs continu
ally by asking questions like, "What is
your nationality?"
"Um ... I'm American."
You know, it's kind of funny that
this is a problem. I have to deal with a
constant defense of the very fabric of
who I am. The only other people I
know who have to deal with this issue
are not white.
People have asked me this ques
tion — or some variation of it — so
many times that 1 have had to stop
and wonder what people are think
ing. Do they think they are being sen
sitive? Understanding? Progressive?
Patriotic? Good conversationalists?
I don't know, but quite frankly I
don't think it's any of these. I think
it's insecurity. 1 think it's fear.
It's the fear that things have
changed, that the United States isn't
like it "used to be" (in fact, it never
was). 1 think it's a refusal to accept
that there are people living in this
country who aren't, well, white.
Because let's be honest folks,
what does it matter where I'm from,
or what nationality I am, or what my
heritage is or who my ancestors are?
Is the fact that I am a human being
not sufficient to warrant respect and
fair treatment? Yes, I am going so far
as to say that asking these questions is
discriminatory, and here's why:
How many times do people ask
John Smith what his nationality, her
itage or ethnicity is?
Well, I have never seen that hap
pen in my lifetime. Doesn't mean it
can't happen, it just means the fre
quency is insignificant.
So I ask again, what does it matter
what my "background" is if it doesn't
matter for other people with light
skin? Why is it more interesting to
know that I am Mexican than it is to

know that someone else is of German
or English or Irish heritage?
It's an unwillingness to let sleep
ing dogs lie.
In this day and age where everybody
is marrying everybody else and every
one and their mom talks about equal
opportunity, there are a lot of people
out there who are sick of it. You know
what? I'm sick of it too.
I wish with all my heart that these
things didn't matter, that race wasn't an
issue, that gender wasn't an issue, that
my name wasn't an issue, that I could go
out to a party without having that in
evitable and grossly offensive question
asked one more time: So, what are you ?
I'm human.
And if we really lived in a place
where equality reigned and justice was
blind. I doubt this question would be
thrown at me as if it were a compli
ment. The fact that I can't just be who
I am, that I am interrogated as to who
I "really" am, is a shining example of
why our society needs to re-examine
its values on race and ethnicity.
Racism and discrimination exist
whether or not you want to admit it,
and I should know: Even if I wanted
to be a plain old "American" sooner
or later, somebody would pop my
bubble by asking me where I was "re
ally" from. People can't simply be
who they are — even if they want to.
There's always going to be some
one who comes back to what and who
they "really" are.
I'm more American than I care
to admit: I was born and raised in
this country, and I don't think any
one has the right to question that. So
you want to know where I am from,
what I am, who my family is, where
they are from, what my ethnicity is,
what's my race, my heritage, my cul
ture and whatever else any creative
ignoramus can come up with?
I know who I am and am comfort
able with that, so that's really your
problem, bud.
