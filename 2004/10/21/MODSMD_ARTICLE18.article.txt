Preserve free speech;
don't censure criticism
I am a high school math and eco
nomics teacher in Los Angeles.
During this time of intense political
debate I gladly take class time to
allow my students to discuss the is
sues and express their opinions
without fear of censure or ridicule
regardless of what end of the politi
cal spectrum those opinions fall or
how offensive they may be to some.
I simply ask that their opinions
be backed up with hard data and
sound reason. It is vital to democra
cy that the freedom to express our
ideas and beliefs openly be pre
served at all cost.
I find the ever-increasing lack of

free speech (in our university cam
puses a seriously disturbing trend.
"Free speech zones," confiscation of
student newspapers and general
censorship or intolerance of dissent
ing voices smack of totalitarianism,
not democracy.
If some students believe MECh A
is a racist organization, so be it
("ASSU bills on MEChA, picket
ing," Oct. 20). If Omar Shakir feels
differently, he can write editorials,
engage in open debate on campus or
discuss the issues on the Web.
It's a university, for goodness
sake. The need to support ethnic
groups in the"event of potential fu
ture attacks" is legitimate if some
are calling for the removal of all
latinos from higher education.

But to seek student government
intervention because The Stanford
Review expressed an opinion im
palatable to certain groups on cam
pus is childish and foolish. Deal with
the "attack" like scholars, not mud
dle-headed activists.

Gestapo stands for 'secret police/
not 'homeland security'
In an op-ed in Wednesdays edi
tion of The Daily, we got to read
some astonishing "facts" on Sept. 11
brought to us by Carole Brouillet
("Protest Philip Zelikow and the
Sept. 11 cover-up commission," Oct.

20). One paragraph told us this in
teresting thing, "Homeland Security
in German is "geheimstadt politza,"
which during World War II was ab
breviated to Gestapo. Do Ameri
cans really believe a Gestapo will
make us safer?"
I just have to comment on that.
There is no German word
"politza". The author probably in
tended to write "polizei," police.
She also tells us that Gestapo is
the abbreviation of "geheimstadt
politza." Well, that sounds similar,
but is just plainly wrong.
Gestapo is geheime staatspolizei.
"Geheimstadt" would be translated
as "secret town" or "secret city,"
and "geheimstadt politza" would
mean something like "police of the

secret town" just assuming that
politza was meant to be polizei.
"Geheime staatspolizei" translates
more to "secret police of the state."
Why is all that important? Be
cause the author tries to tell us that
"homeland security" is just a trans
lation of Gestapo.
Very interesting indeed — but to
tally wrong. Homeland security best
translates to something like
"heimatschutz," which sounds a bit
old-fashioned to me. but that might be
subjective, or perhaps "staatsschutz,"
and that in fact is a part of the police in
Germany — but doing what? Fight
ing terrorism, for example.
The author tries to make a point
that the 9 /11 Commission was bi
ased and tried to cover up facts

about the attacks. I cannot comment
on that, but if all facts presented in
her article are as thoroughly re
searched as the one about the
Gestapo, I think that casts at least
some serious doubts.
I leave it to the readers to make up
their minds about this.
