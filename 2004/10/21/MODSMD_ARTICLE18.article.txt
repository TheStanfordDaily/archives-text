Preserve free speech;
don't censure criticism
I am a high school math and eco
nomics teacher in Los Angeles.
During this time of intense political
debate I gladly take class time to
allow my students to discuss the is
sues and express their opinions
without fear of censure or ridicule
regardless of what end of the politi
cal spectrum those opinions fall or
how offensive they may be to some.
I simply ask that their opinions
be backed up with hard data and
sound reason. It is vital to democra
cy that the freedom to express our
ideas and beliefs openly be pre
served at all cost.
I find the ever-increasing lack of

free speech (in our university cam
puses a seriously disturbing trend.
"Free speech zones," confiscation of
student newspapers and general
censorship or intolerance of dissent
ing voices smack of totalitarianism,
not democracy.
If some students believe MECh A
is a racist organization, so be it
("ASSU bills on MEChA, picket
ing," Oct. 20). If Omar Shakir feels
differently, he can write editorials,
engage in open debate on campus or
discuss the issues on the Web.
It's a university, for goodness
sake. The need to support ethnic
groups in the"event of potential fu
ture attacks" is legitimate if some
are calling for the removal of all
latinos from higher education.

But to seek student government
intervention because The Stanford
Review expressed an opinion im
palatable to certain groups on cam
pus is childish and foolish. Deal with
the "attack" like scholars, not mud
dle-headed activists.

Gestapo stands for 'secret police/
not 'homeland security'
In an op-ed in Wednesdays edi
tion of The Daily, we got to read
some astonishing "facts" on Sept. 11
brought to us by Carole Brouillet
("Protest Philip Zelikow and the
Sept. 11 cover-up commission," Oct.

20). One paragraph told us this in
teresting thing, "Homeland Security
in German is "geheimstadt politza,"
which during World War II was ab
breviated to Gestapo. Do Ameri
cans really believe a Gestapo will
make us safer?"
I just have to comment on that.
There is no German word
"politza". The author probably in
tended to write "polizei," police.
She also tells us that Gestapo is
the abbreviation of "geheimstadt
politza." Well, that sounds similar,
but is just plainly wrong.
Gestapo is geheime staatspolizei.
"Geheimstadt" would be translated
as "secret town" or "secret city,"
and "geheimstadt politza" would
mean something like "police of the

secret town" just assuming that
politza was meant to be polizei.
"Geheime staatspolizei" translates
more to "secret police of the state."
Why is all that important? Be
cause the author tries to tell us that
"homeland security" is just a trans
lation of Gestapo.
Very interesting indeed — but to
tally wrong. Homeland security best
translates to something like
"heimatschutz," which sounds a bit
old-fashioned to me. but that might be
subjective, or perhaps "staatsschutz,"
and that in fact is a part of the police in
Germany — but doing what? Fight
ing terrorism, for example.
The author tries to make a point
that the 9 /11 Commission was bi
ased and tried to cover up facts

about the attacks. I cannot comment
on that, but if all facts presented in
her article are as thoroughly re
searched as the one about the
Gestapo, I think that casts at least
some serious doubts.
I leave it to the readers to make up
their minds about this.

Muslim terrorists, not Israel, are to
blame for conflict
I would like to comment on the
article by Hedy Epstein on the cur
rent situation in Israel ("Holocaust
survivor protests wall," Oct. 20).
Epstein acknowledges the atrocities
of the suicide bombers who specifi
cally target Israeli women and chil
dren.
As a compassionate human
being, she also grieves for the loss of
life on the Palestinian side and goes

on to describe the hardships of the
Palestinian people due to the de
struction of olive groves and the
building of the security fence.
While I agree that a lot of inno
cent Palestinians are affected by
these measures, 1 would want to
hear alternative suggestions of deal
ing with multiple attacks by the
Palestinian terrorists on the Israelis.
Uprooting olive groves is no
good, but what is the Israeli army to
do if terrorists routinely use them
for cover when shooting or firing

missiles into Israeli towns?
The Palestinian farmers are
afraid to tell the militants not to use
their groves, lest they be labeled as
"Israel's collaborators" and shot.
The security fence makes it diffi
cult for Palestinians to reach their
fields, but how can Israel protect its
border against suicide bombers who
make their way into cafes full of
teenagers and street corners crowd
ed with people?
Terrorists know that using civil
ians as human shields will lead to

collective punishment and loss of in
nocent lives, but their hatred for Is
rael is much more powerful than the
consideration for their own people.
Pulling out of Judea and Samaria
— known as the West Bank — does
not guarantee peace for Israel, since
a number of terrorist groups do not
recognize Israel's right to exist and
plan to continue their attacks as long
as Israel is on the map.
I think that there is hope for
peace in the Middle East if the
Palestinian propaganda stops teach
ing their children hate and stops
glorifying "martyrs" and demoniz
ing Jews and Americans. When the
corruption in the Palestinian gov
ernment is gone, the money that
many countries, charities and indi
viduals give to help the Palestinian
people will finally reach them, im
prove the economy and get rid of
the "nothing to lose" mentality,
which makes dialogue so much
more difficult.

Israel needs to be able to protect
itself from terrorism
In the interest of promoting accu
racy in the media, 1 am compelled
to respond to Hedy Epstein's letter
to the editor decrying the security
barrier erected by Israel to stop ter
ror attacks against its civilian popu
lation ("Holocaust survivor
protests wall," Oct. 21).
Epstein identified herself as a
Holocaust survivor, although she
spent World War II in England, not
central Europe. She found the Inter
national Solidarity Movement and is
indignant that she. as an old woman,
was strip searched by Israel.
Since the ISM has given shelter
to terrorists and publicly defended
Palestinian terror as a tactic, Israeli
security forces detained her, but
only briefly.
Regarding Epstein's larger point,
the need to end the occupation, one
must question which occupied terri
tories she is talking about. The West
Bank and Gaza? Tel Aviv? Her own
view of what the occupation is does
not square with that of the terrorists,
nor does her own personal opposi
tion to Palestinian terror jibe with the
views of the Palestinian Authority.
The second intifada began in
2000 before the election that
brought Sharon to power. During
that time. Ehud Barak negotiated
at Camp David and Taba to end the
occupation as Epstein probably de
fines it — West Bank and Gaza.
In response, the Palestinians
started and stepped up terror at
tacks as they negotiated. The
Palestinians were threatened by
the negotiations that they were
themselves conducting and had no
desire to live in the lands described
above in peace with Israel.
Not surprisingly, Barak was
trounced at the polls.
Epstein, who lost family mem
bers to Hitler, ought to realize that
the next Holocaust may yet be per
petrated by Islamists. Israel, both
as a haven for Jews and as a center
for Judaism, is utterly rejected by
the majority of Palestinians. Per
haps Stanford will give her grand
children refuge.

Gestapo stands for 'secret police/
not 'homeland security'
In an op-ed in Wednesdays edi
tion of The Daily, we got to read
some astonishing "facts" on Sept. 11
brought to us by Carole Brouillet
("Protest Philip Zelikow and the
Sept. 11 cover-up commission," Oct.

20). One paragraph told us this in
teresting thing, "Homeland Security
in German is "geheimstadt politza,"
which during World War II was ab
breviated to Gestapo. Do Ameri
cans really believe a Gestapo will
make us safer?"
I just have to comment on that.
There is no German word
"politza". The author probably in
tended to write "polizei," police.
She also tells us that Gestapo is
the abbreviation of "geheimstadt
politza." Well, that sounds similar,
but is just plainly wrong.
Gestapo is geheime staatspolizei.
"Geheimstadt" would be translated
as "secret town" or "secret city,"
and "geheimstadt politza" would
mean something like "police of the

secret town" just assuming that
politza was meant to be polizei.
"Geheime staatspolizei" translates
more to "secret police of the state."
Why is all that important? Be
cause the author tries to tell us that
"homeland security" is just a trans
lation of Gestapo.
Very interesting indeed — but to
tally wrong. Homeland security best
translates to something like
"heimatschutz," which sounds a bit
old-fashioned to me. but that might be
subjective, or perhaps "staatsschutz,"
and that in fact is a part of the police in
Germany — but doing what? Fight
ing terrorism, for example.
The author tries to make a point
that the 9 /11 Commission was bi
ased and tried to cover up facts

about the attacks. I cannot comment
on that, but if all facts presented in
her article are as thoroughly re
searched as the one about the
Gestapo, I think that casts at least
some serious doubts.
I leave it to the readers to make up
their minds about this.

Graduate student, Communcation
Muslim terrorists, not Israel, are to
blame for conflict
I would like to comment on the
article by Hedy Epstein on the cur
rent situation in Israel ("Holocaust
survivor protests wall," Oct. 20).
Epstein acknowledges the atrocities
of the suicide bombers who specifi
cally target Israeli women and chil
dren.
As a compassionate human
being, she also grieves for the loss of
life on the Palestinian side and goes

on to describe the hardships of the
Palestinian people due to the de
struction of olive groves and the
building of the security fence.
While I agree that a lot of inno
cent Palestinians are affected by
these measures, 1 would want to
hear alternative suggestions of deal
ing with multiple attacks by the
Palestinian terrorists on the Israelis.
Uprooting olive groves is no
good, but what is the Israeli army to
do if terrorists routinely use them
for cover when shooting or firing

missiles into Israeli towns?
The Palestinian farmers are
afraid to tell the militants not to use
their groves, lest they be labeled as
"Israel's collaborators" and shot.
The security fence makes it diffi
cult for Palestinians to reach their
fields, but how can Israel protect its
border against suicide bombers who
make their way into cafes full of
teenagers and street corners crowd
ed with people?
Terrorists know that using civil
ians as human shields will lead to

collective punishment and loss of in
nocent lives, but their hatred for Is
rael is much more powerful than the
consideration for their own people.
Pulling out of Judea and Samaria
— known as the West Bank — does
not guarantee peace for Israel, since
a number of terrorist groups do not
recognize Israel's right to exist and
plan to continue their attacks as long
as Israel is on the map.
I think that there is hope for
peace in the Middle East if the
Palestinian propaganda stops teach
ing their children hate and stops
glorifying "martyrs" and demoniz
ing Jews and Americans. When the
corruption in the Palestinian gov
ernment is gone, the money that
many countries, charities and indi
viduals give to help the Palestinian
people will finally reach them, im
prove the economy and get rid of
the "nothing to lose" mentality,
which makes dialogue so much
more difficult.

Israel needs to be able to protect
itself from terrorism
In the interest of promoting accu
racy in the media, 1 am compelled
to respond to Hedy Epstein's letter
to the editor decrying the security
barrier erected by Israel to stop ter
ror attacks against its civilian popu
lation ("Holocaust survivor
protests wall," Oct. 21).
Epstein identified herself as a
Holocaust survivor, although she
spent World War II in England, not
central Europe. She found the Inter
national Solidarity Movement and is
indignant that she. as an old woman,
was strip searched by Israel.
Since the ISM has given shelter
to terrorists and publicly defended
Palestinian terror as a tactic, Israeli
security forces detained her, but
only briefly.
Regarding Epstein's larger point,
the need to end the occupation, one
must question which occupied terri
tories she is talking about. The West
Bank and Gaza? Tel Aviv? Her own
view of what the occupation is does
not square with that of the terrorists,
nor does her own personal opposi
tion to Palestinian terror jibe with the
views of the Palestinian Authority.
The second intifada began in
2000 before the election that
brought Sharon to power. During
that time. Ehud Barak negotiated
at Camp David and Taba to end the
occupation as Epstein probably de
fines it — West Bank and Gaza.
In response, the Palestinians
started and stepped up terror at
tacks as they negotiated. The
Palestinians were threatened by
the negotiations that they were
themselves conducting and had no
desire to live in the lands described
above in peace with Israel.
Not surprisingly, Barak was

not square with that of the terrorists,
nor does her own personal opposi
tion to Palestinian terror jibe with the
views of the Palestinian Authority.
The second intifada began in
2000 before the election that
brought Sharon to power. During
that time. Ehud Barak negotiated
at Camp David and Taba to end the
occupation as Epstein probably de
fines it — West Bank and Gaza.
In response, the Palestinians
started and stepped up terror at
tacks as they negotiated. The
Palestinians were threatened by
the negotiations that they were
themselves conducting and had no
desire to live in the lands described
above in peace with Israel.
Not surprisingly, Barak was
trounced at the polls.
Epstein, who lost family mem
bers to Hitler, ought to realize that
the next Holocaust may yet be per
petrated by Islamists. Israel, both
as a haven for Jews and as a center
for Judaism, is utterly rejected by
the majority of Palestinians. Per
haps Stanford will give her grand
children refuge.
