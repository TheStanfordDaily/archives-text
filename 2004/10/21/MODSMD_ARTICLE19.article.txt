## After 12 days rest, field hockey faces Pacific 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford field hockey women (6-
9, 0-4 Northern Pacific Athletic Confer
ence) have struggled with close calls and
tough losses all season. But one of the
team's biggest frustrations can be ex
plained with just one number.
Zero. The number of conferences vic
tories that the Cardinal have earned.
The team is optimistic that number will
be up by one after this Saturday's game
against Pacific (6-9, 3-2 NorPac) at Stan
ford's Varsity Field Hockey Turf.
The Cardinal will have had 12 total
days of rest since their last matchup
against No. 12 Boston College (10-4).
Stanford fell to the Eagles 2-1 in a close

ly fought game at Berkeley, Calif., a neu
tral site. The Stanford women have
mainly focused their practices since the
loss on defending penalty corners; The
Cardinal have given up a majority of
their goals on penalty corners.
Besides just defending the corner
more successfully, the Cardinal hope to
give up fewer corners and win a few more
of their own.
"A lot of the shots that other teams
are getting on us are penalty corners, a
great way to score," said freshman for
ward Jessica Zutz. "Most of our shots
aren't. It's great that we're taking a lot of
shots, but I think we need to have a little
more shot selection."
Zutz was recently named NorPac
West Offensive Player of the Week as

well as the Rookie Player of the Week
for the week of October 4-10. In a game
against Southwest Missouri State (8-6,3-
3) Oct. 4, Zutz picked up a career high
five points in a 3-2 double overtime win.
4. Zutz scored twice in the matchup and
also assisted sophomore forward Liz
Robinson on the game-winning goal in
double overtime.
Zutz earned Offensive Player of the
Week honors for the first time in her ca
reer while earning the Rookie Player of
the Week distinction for the second time
in her first year at Stanford. Zutz leads
the Cardinal with 12 points (tied for 7th
in the NorPac) and is ready to help lead
the Stanford offense against the Tigers.
"After having been in a scoring
drought [before the SMS game] it felt

great to finally score. I'm feeling really
good going into this weekend," Zutz said.
The Tigers are coming off back-to
back wins against SMS. Pacific won con
vincingly in both games, by scores of 3-1
and 2-0. The Tigers' offense is led by se
nior midfielder Lindsey Rovai and
sophomore forward Vianney Campos.
Campos leads the team with 12 goals on
the season and led the Tigers' offense in
points last season as well, earning 2003
NorPac West Offensive Player of the
Year for her efforts. Rovai, with 16
points on the season, is a playmaker up
front with veteran leadership.
The Cardinal and the Tigers have
faced off once this season already. Pacif
ic dominated the matchup, roughing up
the Cardinal 5-0.
