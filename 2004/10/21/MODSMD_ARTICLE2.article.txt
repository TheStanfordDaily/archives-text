# Labor issues ignite debate
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Where is Hennessy?" chanted
students, workers, faculty and com
munity members as they walked out
of last night's standing-room-only
town hall meeting on Stanford's
workplace policies. Upset that Uni
versity President John Hennessy did
not attend the meeting, student ac
tivists led the meeting attendees to
Hennessy's house to voice their con
cerns about improving worker's
rights on campus.
The University organized the
town hall meeting for the public to
give feedback and ask questions
about the Presidential Advisory
Committee's Report on Workplace
Policies, issued this past June.
Hennessy commissioned the
Committee to write the report last
year after students went on a week
long hunger strike to improve labor
conditions for workers on campus.
The committee was charged with
studying temporary and subcon
tracted workers, living wage poli
cies, employee education opportu
nities and unionization procedures.
Meeting attehdants held up signs
that read "Nice first step Stanford,
keep on moving" while the Presi
dential Advisory Committee pre
sented its report.
Although relatively satisfied with
the report and its recommendations,
members of the student activist
group Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion expressed concern that the Uni
versity might not act on the commit
tee's findings. They read a statement
asking for the recommendations to
be expanded into a code of conduct
and implemented immediately.
More than 10 student groups
have signed the statement, including
the Asian American Student Asso
ciation, the Black Student Union
and the Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice.
"Where is President Hennessy?"
was the first question raised after the
committee presented a summary of
the Report.
"He signed off in good faith to
commission this study after our
hunger strike, and he will ultimately
make the decisions about workplace
policies," said senior Molly Gold
berg. a member of the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition. "So why
isn't he here to listen to our view
points and hear our statement?"
After about an hour-and-a-half of
discussion. Goldberg stated that the
meeting was not productive without
the presence of members of the Uni
versity administration. Committee
members indicated that they could
not answer questions about how the
University would implement their
recommendations.
"I cannot speak for President
Hennessy," said committee co-chair
Economics Prof. John Peneavel.
'But 1 would be very surprised if he
does not address these issues."

Goldberg then asked Peneavel to
give Hennessy a phone call on the
spot, hut Peneavel denied the re
quest, stating that the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition had not
asked for Hennessy's presence when
the group initially planned the meet
ing. At that point, Goldberg made
the decision to march to Hennessy's
house, and all but a handful of peo
ple followed her lead.
"It is these students taking actions
like this that got all these people in a
room together," said Zev Kvitky, an
operations engineer at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center and pres
ident of United Stanford Workers.
He also served on the Presidential
Advisory Committee. "The Univer
sity did not start this study out of
good will; they did it because these
students fasted fora week." he said
as he made his way out the door.
During the meeting, Kvitky
praised the report's recommenda
tions, but also emphasized the limi
tations. The Presidential Advisory
Committee had to work within the

University's existing budget and did
not have access to information about
the University's endowment, he
said.
"The limitations were so severe
that they prevented this committee
from finding solutions to problems
that we faced," Kvitky said. "So the
recommendations will only amount
to a first step towards addressing
labor problems on campus."
The Stanford Labor Action
Coalition's written statement on the
report also took issue with the
amount of funding the committee
had at its disposal to conduct the
study.
A woman who works at Stanford
Hospital raised another limitation
about the report at last night's meet
ing: Hie report studied workers at
Stanford University, but not at Stan
ford Hospital.
Committee member Mark Gra
novetter, a sociology professor, re
sponded that although the commit
tee initially wanted to include Stan
ford Hospital, it could not do so be

cause the hospital is legally a sepa
rate entity from the University.
The committee recommended
that students read the report, avail
able at the workplace policies Web
site, in order to understand the com
plexities of the problems of workers
on campus. A show of hands at the
meeting indicated that at least half
the audience professed to have read
the over 100-page report.
The report recommends that the
University enforce its parity rule that
temporary workers get paid the
same amount as regular workers
when they do the same jobs. Howev
er, it did not recommend that tempo
rary workers receive the same bene
fits, like health care, that regular
workers receive.
The committee members were di
vided on the point of parity in bene
fits and also disagreed on whether
the University ought to institute a
living wage policy. The committee
ultimately chose not to recommend
the adoption of a living wage, but ex
pressed the opposing point of view in

the report.
"We wanted to put our own dis
agreements [about parity and living
wage] out there for debate, let the
University gather more information
and come to their own informed con
clusion," Granovetter said.
Stanford Labor Action Coalition
members advocated for the adop
tion of both a living wage and bene
fits for temporary and subcontracted
workers at the meeting last night.
"It is a statement of principle that
we should be seeking parity across
these groups [of workers] an
tecedently," said Todd Daves, a
Symbolic Systems lecturer.
Although the committee did not
unanimously agree on the questions
of parity and a living wage, it did
make firm recommendations on
three other fronts.
First, it suggested that the Uni
versity adopt a clear grievance pro
cedure for temporary and subcon
tracted workers to voice their con
cerns about the workplace. It said
that procedure ought to include a

Activists pleased with findings, angry at Hennessy's absence

Worker Advocate position â€” an
employee to field workers' concerns
and bring them to University per
sonnel for resolution.
The committtee also recom
mended a pilot program to analyze
what skills workers need to advance
their careers and what skills workers
actually have. If the pilot program
points to a need for increased work
er education, Stanford should "cre
ate a comprehensive educational de
velopment program for low-wage
temporary, casual and regular em
ployees," states the report.
The final recommendation of the
committee was that the University
comply with the intent of the law
rather than the letter of the law when
workers are considering unioniza
tion. An analysis of the University's
collecting bargaining agreement
with United Stanford Workers was
not included in the committee's re
port. The report focused on tempo
rary, subcontracted and other low
wage employees who are not part of
a collective bargaining body.
