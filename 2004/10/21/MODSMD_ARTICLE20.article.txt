# The 						Double Clutch
## Great football lessons from a Saturday of college play 
### CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON 
My, oh my, what a great Saturday of col
lege football. In the first real cull of
the season, several teams' expecta
tions evaporated, and a few proved they de
served the hype.
Let's start with the hometown heroes. The
Cardinal learned a bit about winning in their
limp second-half loss to USC. They learned a
bit more in their how-many-mistakes-can
we-make collapse at Notre Dame. Last week
end in Pullman, they finally put all the pieces
together.
Unfazed by Washington State's resurgent
running game, the defense forced four
turnovers en route to a 23-17 win against a pro
gram that has won 33 games since 2001. With a
13-3 halftime lead. Stanford held off a come
back attempt fora critical conference victory
and its first big road win of the Teevens era.
How was this second half different from the
Cardinal's second half against USC? Trent
Edwards threw a 67-yard touchdown bomb on
the Cardinal's first offensive play. Leigh Tor
rence and Oshiomogho Atogwe grabbed in
terceptions. Washington State quarterback
Josh Swogger was dealt a broken foot and a
concussion. For once, the Farm Team set the
tone.
Though Stanford did not dominate down the
stretch, it flexed big-play defensive muscle to
head off the sort of gut-wrenching collapse that
the Cougars themselves are famous for ("Cou
gin' It" is a phrase in Northwest vocabulary.)
And when it came time to take control,
playmakers stood up. In a critical third-quarter
sequence, the Cardinal forced an incomplete
pass on fourth-and-goal at the two; two plays
later Edwards was intercepted, and the
Cougars looked ready to seize control. But
WSU fumbled on consecutive plays, the sec
ond being recovered by Brandon Harrison,
and Stanford had frustrated its opponent just
enough to pull the game out. The Cardinal
have a chance to get halfway to a bowl if they
can collect their fifth win against Oregon this
weekend.
We have learned much more about the wild
Pac-10 in the past weeks.
USC has gone into fourth gear, dismantling
unbeaten Arizona State 45-7. and will be heav
ily favored in every game to come. California is
a close second, as its earlier 23-17 down-to-the
wire loss at the hands of the Trojans shows. It's
hard to find a team on the remaining schedule
who can challenge cither of these clubs.
Along with the Sun Devils, Stanford de
serves to be considered as high as third in the
conference, with several tossup games ahead
— Oregon, UCLA, Arizona State, Oregon
State — before its tilt with Cal in Berkeley.
On the lower half, the glory days of North
west football appear to be over. The schools
from Oregon and Washington are a combined
9-15. with Washington warming the cellar at 1-
5 (0-3 Pac-10). After winning at least a share of
the conference title three out of the last four
seasons, they have been reduced to cannibaliz
ing each other for wacky, satisfying — but ulti
mately unremarkable — victories.
Washington State has lost the leadership at
quarterback that lifted them the past three
years. Oregon and Oregon State are simply
not playing sharply, and Washington's meager
talent is so decimated by injuries that the
Huskies are currently a 34.5-point underdog to
USC.
On the national level, this week's AP poll
contains a Top Ten of full-blooded con
tenders. That includes even the No. 9 Utah
Utes, who have my Heisman candidate in
quarterback Alex Smith. (No offense to the
most explosive player, USC tailback Reggie
Bush, but play in and play out Smith has
picked good defenses to pieces on the ground
and through the air.) Utah appears the last
and best shot to "bust the BCS" and break
into a marquee bowl game from a second-tier
conference.
The surprise No. 3 team is
Auburn, who fell apart under the
pressure of expectations last year
but now sits at 7-0 after squeaking by
defending national co-champion
LSU and demolishing Tennessee in
Knoxville. Their tailbacks'are back
to dominant form, and improved
play at quarterback has lifted them
to the top in the ultra-tough South
eastern Conference.
Wisconsin, the number one de
fense in the country, showed its met
tle on the road in West Lafayette.
The Badgers held Purdue's lights
out offense to 17 points, then turned

Auburn
surprises

the lights out themselves by return
ing a Kyle Orton fumble for the
game-winning touchdown. (That
would appear to be the end of
Orton's Heisman campaign.)
Experience dictates that at least
four of the Top Ten teams will fall
before November is out, just as
quickly as they climbed the charts.
With six frenetic weeks left in the
college season, no team can afford to
breathe easy.
