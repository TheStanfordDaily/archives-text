# Teams set to make splash
## Talented womenâ€™s swim team sets high expectations as season begins on Saturday 
### REBECCA HARLOW 
If you asked most women's swim teams whether they
would be satisfied by a fifth-place finish in the 2004
NCAA Championships, the answer would be a resound
ing yes. This is not the case for Stanford, though.
The Cardinal have been disappointed by their sixth
and filth-place finishes in the last two years and are
working very hard to raise their performance to a higher
level.
This is understandable when you take into account
Stanford's unprecedented eight national titles in 21 sea
sons, including five straight in the 19905. Since then the
team has been struggling to regain that kind of success.
Head coach Richard Quick believes that this year his
squad has a chance to return to the top three at nationals
and maybe even break into the top two, though Georgia
and Auburn seem to be the frontrunners at this point in
the season.
"They look like they're out of reach for everybody,"
Quick said. "1 would say that, if we swim well, we could be
in a battle for about third. If either one of those top two
teams falters a bit, and we could have a lights-out meet,
maybe we can knock somebody off."
This team is looking at this point like one of the
strongest that Stanford has memory fielded in recent
memory. A strong squad of veterans return from last year,
having lost only three members to graduation. Seven
freshmen, including an Olympian, a few high school Ail-
Americans and several top-notch talents, join them.
Senior captain Lacey Boutwell praised the progress
that the freshmen and the entire squad have made in
training so far.
"[The freshmen come in] with great qualifications, and
they are all going to add a lot to our team," Boutwell said.
"We have one Olympian in the freshman class; we have
national champions. We've got everything."
Returning Olympic medalist junior Dana Kirk agrees
with this assessment, noting that "all our girls are nation
al qualifiers, which is amazing."
The freshmen also bring an infectious, youthful excite
ment to the veterans.
"Our freshmen class is very enthused about swim
ming, very enthused about improving and very enthused
about our team," Quick said. "I think it's rubbing off on
everybody."
With senior captains Boutwell, Sarah Jones and Amy
Wagner, and Olympians Kirk, Kristen Caverly and fresh
man Caroline Bruce, the incoming athletes are joining a
solid group of upperclassmen. These six are all likely to
make a big impact on the team beyond simply posting
consistently high scores. The group contains top perform
ers in each of the strokes at several distances, so their ex
periences and successes will be spread out throughout
competitions.
But even more important than just performing consis
tently, according to Quick, the Olympic trio brings its con
fidence to the team.
"They have a level of confidence [where] they know

they are going to do well, and everyone else gets infected
with that a little bit," Quick said.
With the strength of their returning athletes and the
new freshmen, and the effect of having three Olympians
leading the way, Stanford looks to be in a great position to
dominate in the Pacific-10 Conference this year.
The Cardinal have a history of success in the Pac-10,
claiming the top or second spot every year since 1988,
with the exception of a fourth-place finish in 2001. The
2001 team, however, went on to take the second spot at
nationals.
The six-woman diving team is also looking forward to
a successful season.
Its leaders are senior Ashlee Rosenthal and sopho
more Cassidy Krug, both of whom are strong contenders
for the national championship. Rosenthal finished fourth
and sixth in the one- and three-meter springboard com
petitions, respectively, at the national championships in
2004, and has steadily improved in the off-season. Krug
finished in eighth place at the US Olympic Trials this year
and has been training well.
The supporting roster includes All-American Sara
Bowling along with Erin Lashnits, Brooke Sullivan and
Katie Lampe.
"[Rosenthal and Krug] are very nationally oriented,"
said head diving coach Dr. Rick Schavone. "(The others]

are in the process of becoming [nationally oriented]. Ba
sically either one of them could win."
The heights that this year's divers can reach depend
partly on their international competitors in the NCAA.
Schavone points out that several of the top divers took
off last year's college season to train for the Olympics. If
these divers do not return for this season, Stanford ath
letes have a strong chance of bringing home the national
title.
Even if they do compete, Schavone predicts a top four
finish for one or both of Stanford's top duo. He also hopes
that if the other four members of the team continue to im
prove as they have been, one of them will be able to join
Rosenthal and Krug at the national championships.
The swimmers and divers have three competitions
apiece before taking a break in December. The swim
team will compete in Hawaii on Saturday, in Texas the
following weekend and at the Speedo Cup in Long Beach
Nov. 18-20.
The diving team will attend the same meets in Hawaii
and Texas, and then travel to the Trojan Invite at South
ern California Nov. 5 and 6.
There is one more preseason meet in January before
the start of the Pac-10 season Jan. 21. The season culmi
nates with the NCAA Championships in Indiana in mid-
March.

finished in eighth place at the US Olympic Trials this year
and has been training well.
The supporting roster includes All-American Sara
Bowling along with Erin Lashnits, Brooke Sullivan and
Katie Lampe.
"[Rosenthal and Krug] are very nationally oriented,"
said head diving coach Dr. Rick Schavone. "(The others]

are in the process of becoming [nationally oriented]. Ba
sically either one of them could win."
The heights that this year's divers can reach depend
partly on their international competitors in the NCAA.
Schavone points out that several of the top divers took
off last year's college season to train for the Olympics. If
these divers do not return for this season, Stanford ath
letes have a strong chance of bringing home the national
title.
Even if they do compete, Schavone predicts a top four
finish for one or both of Stanford's top duo. He also hopes
that if the other four members of the team continue to im
prove as they have been, one of them will be able to join
Rosenthal and Krug at the national championships.
The swimmers and divers have three competitions
apiece before taking a break in December. The swim
team will compete in Hawaii on Saturday, in Texas the
following weekend and at the Speedo Cup in Long Beach
Nov. 18-20.
The diving team will attend the same meets in Hawaii
and Texas, and then travel to the Trojan Invite at South
ern California Nov. 5 and 6.
There is one more preseason meet in January before
the start of the Pac-10 season Jan. 21. The season culmi
nates with the NCAA Championships in Indiana in mid-
March.

Olympic medalist Dana Kirk, a junior, will swim the butterfly, freestyle and individual medley for the Cardinal this sea
son. Kirk helped Team USA win a silver medal in the 4xloo meter medley in Athens this summer. Joining her on the
swim team this season are two other Olympians, classmate Kristen Caverly and freshman Caroline Bruce.
If you asked most women's swim teams whether they
would be satisfied by a fifth-place finish in the 2004
NCAA Championships, the answer would be a resound
ing yes. This is not the case for Stanford, though.
The Cardinal have been disappointed by their sixth
and filth-place finishes in the last two years and are
working very hard to raise their performance to a higher
level.
This is understandable when you take into account
Stanford's unprecedented eight national titles in 21 sea
sons, including five straight in the 19905. Since then the
team has been struggling to regain that kind of success.
Head coach Richard Quick believes that this year his
squad has a chance to return to the top three at nationals
and maybe even break into the top two, though Georgia
and Auburn seem to be the frontrunners at this point in
the season.
"They look like they're out of reach for everybody,"
Quick said. "1 would say that, if we swim well, we could be
in a battle for about third. If either one of those top two
teams falters a bit, and we could have a lights-out meet,
maybe we can knock somebody off."
This team is looking at this point like one of the
strongest that Stanford has memory fielded in recent
memory. A strong squad of veterans return from last year,
having lost only three members to graduation. Seven
freshmen, including an Olympian, a few high school Ail-
Americans and several top-notch talents, join them.
Senior captain Lacey Boutwell praised the progress
that the freshmen and the entire squad have made in
training so far.
"[The freshmen come in] with great qualifications, and
they are all going to add a lot to our team," Boutwell said.
"We have one Olympian in the freshman class; we have
national champions. We've got everything."
Returning Olympic medalist junior Dana Kirk agrees
with this assessment, noting that "all our girls are nation
al qualifiers, which is amazing."
The freshmen also bring an infectious, youthful excite
ment to the veterans.
"Our freshmen class is very enthused about swim
ming, very enthused about improving and very enthused
about our team," Quick said. "I think it's rubbing off on
everybody."
With senior captains Boutwell, Sarah Jones and Amy
Wagner, and Olympians Kirk, Kristen Caverly and fresh
man Caroline Bruce, the incoming athletes are joining a
solid group of upperclassmen. These six are all likely to
make a big impact on the team beyond simply posting
consistently high scores. The group contains top perform
ers in each of the strokes at several distances, so their ex
periences and successes will be spread out throughout
competitions.
But even more important than just performing consis
tently, according to Quick, the Olympic trio brings its con
fidence to the team.
"They have a level of confidence [where] they know

they are going to do well, and everyone else gets infected
with that a little bit," Quick said.
With the strength of their returning athletes and the
new freshmen, and the effect of having three Olympians
leading the way, Stanford looks to be in a great position to
dominate in the Pacific-10 Conference this year.
The Cardinal have a history of success in the Pac-10,
claiming the top or second spot every year since 1988,
with the exception of a fourth-place finish in 2001. The
2001 team, however, went on to take the second spot at
nationals.
The six-woman diving team is also looking forward to
a successful season.
Its leaders are senior Ashlee Rosenthal and sopho
more Cassidy Krug, both of whom are strong contenders
for the national championship. Rosenthal finished fourth
and sixth in the one- and three-meter springboard com
petitions, respectively, at the national championships in
2004, and has steadily improved in the off-season. Krug
finished in eighth place at the US Olympic Trials this year
and has been training well.
The supporting roster includes All-American Sara
Bowling along with Erin Lashnits, Brooke Sullivan and
Katie Lampe.
