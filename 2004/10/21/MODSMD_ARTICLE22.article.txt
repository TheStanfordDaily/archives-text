# Club Sports Update: Taekwondo gears up, hockey nabs win
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN 
Like the sport itself, there is more to the
Stanford Taekwondo club than meets the eye.
Taekwondo is not just physical combat
in white jumpsuits. It is an intricate combi
nation of elegant footwork and powerful
kicks.
Stanford Taekwondo is not an ordi
nary club sport. Members do not have to
participate in competitions, and in fact,
members do not even have to be Stanford
students. Residents of the Palo Alto area
are also welcome to join the team, an ar
rangement that helps students form new
relationships.
"I have been able to meet a lot of nice
people in the Palo Alto community
through the club." said junior Alice Chow.
One such member of the club is Dylan
Arena, Class of 20()1, who is now a soft
ware developer at Oracle.
"I've been training with Stanford Taek
wondo for almost three years, and I earned
my second Dan [a certification level in the
belt system) black belt here," Arena said.
'Tve come to appreciate the flexibility,
grace, coordination, and strength required

to excel."
There are no tryouts, hut students and
community members may join the Taek
wondo club only at the beginning of each
academic quarter. This is designed to main
tain the pace of instruction.
Prospective members need not even
have a yellow belt — the lowest level of
taekwondo certification beyond the begin
ner white belt — to join. Tim Ghormley, a
fifth Dan black belt, will guide students
through the ranks. All belts practice to
gether, providing a sense of team unity
while allowing those with less experience
to learn from the veterans.
"When deciding what college to attend,
taekwondo played a large role in my deci
sion," said freshman Parilee Edison, who
joined the team this year as a third Dan black
belt. "Over Admit Weekend. I had the
chance to watch the Stanford black belt test
and was impressed both with the discipline
that Master Ghormley instills in his students
and with the camaraderie of the club."
While they have fun with social events
and outings, the taekwondo athletes are at
the same time very disciplined. Mandatory
classes are held Tuesdays and Thursdays

from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Additional sparring
practice runs from 8:30 until 9 p.m. those
same evenings, and for an hour after that,
there is optional self-defense or demo
practice.
Sunday practices, from 10 a.m. to noon,
are devoted to sparring, in preparation for
competitions.
"In our collegiate competitions, you'll
be treated to fast-paced matches of highly
skilled athletes trying to kick each other in
the head," Arena said.
Although rules forbid such actual con
tact, within the structured routine of each
class period, Stanford taekwondo athletes
do learn how to legally beat their oppo
nents. Warm-up exercises and stretching
come first, followed by basic kicks, foot
work, punches, and blocks. After this, club
members practice "poomse," basic moves
memorized in varying sequences. The final
part of class focuses on kicking paddles and
partnered drills.
"I began taekwondo last year without
any previous experience," Chow said. "I al
ways wanted to learn a martial art because
it seemed like a great way to get in shape.
In addition to getting a good workout and

hanging out with cool people, it has also
helped me build confidence by challenging
me physically and mentally."
Competitions are held year-round, with
the larger ones in the spring. Members of
the Taekwondo club who do not wish to
compete can volunteer as judges, referees,
and scorers. Judging is based largely on
technique, as taekwondo is a sport known
for its finesse.
"Taekwondo sparring isn't about brawl
ing," said graduate student team member
Patrick Lu. "There is a science to it. In
taekwondo, a less athletic player can beat a
more gifted opponent if he fights intelli
gently."
In addition to competitions, members
of the Taekwondo club perform demon
strations on campus throughout the year.
They also organize special seminars on
topics such as sparring strategies and
board- breaking.
Demo coordinator Albert Chan said he
enjoys taekwondo "because of the disci
pline it teaches, and the fact that it mixes a
good amount of flashier moves with useful
self-defense techniques."

tion, resident staff can e-mail him at

Like the sport itself, there is more to the
Stanford Taekwondo club than meets the eye.
Taekwondo is not just physical combat
in white jumpsuits. It is an intricate combi
nation of elegant footwork and powerful
kicks.
Stanford Taekwondo is not an ordi
nary club sport. Members do not have to
participate in competitions, and in fact,
members do not even have to be Stanford
students. Residents of the Palo Alto area
are also welcome to join the team, an ar
rangement that helps students form new
relationships.
"I have been able to meet a lot of nice
people in the Palo Alto community
through the club." said junior Alice Chow.
One such member of the club is Dylan
Arena, Class of 20()1, who is now a soft
ware developer at Oracle.
"I've been training with Stanford Taek
wondo for almost three years, and I earned
my second Dan [a certification level in the
belt system) black belt here," Arena said.
'Tve come to appreciate the flexibility,
grace, coordination, and strength required

to excel."
There are no tryouts, hut students and
community members may join the Taek
wondo club only at the beginning of each
academic quarter. This is designed to main
tain the pace of instruction.
Prospective members need not even
have a yellow belt — the lowest level of
taekwondo certification beyond the begin
ner white belt — to join. Tim Ghormley, a
fifth Dan black belt, will guide students
through the ranks. All belts practice to
gether, providing a sense of team unity
while allowing those with less experience
to learn from the veterans.
"When deciding what college to attend,
taekwondo played a large role in my deci
sion," said freshman Parilee Edison, who
joined the team this year as a third Dan black
belt. "Over Admit Weekend. I had the
chance to watch the Stanford black belt test
and was impressed both with the discipline
that Master Ghormley instills in his students
and with the camaraderie of the club."
While they have fun with social events
and outings, the taekwondo athletes are at
the same time very disciplined. Mandatory
classes are held Tuesdays and Thursdays

from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Additional sparring
practice runs from 8:30 until 9 p.m. those
same evenings, and for an hour after that,
there is optional self-defense or demo
practice.
Sunday practices, from 10 a.m. to noon,
are devoted to sparring, in preparation for
competitions.
"In our collegiate competitions, you'll
be treated to fast-paced matches of highly
skilled athletes trying to kick each other in
the head," Arena said.
Although rules forbid such actual con
tact, within the structured routine of each
class period, Stanford taekwondo athletes
do learn how to legally beat their oppo
nents. Warm-up exercises and stretching
come first, followed by basic kicks, foot
work, punches, and blocks. After this, club
members practice "poomse," basic moves
memorized in varying sequences. The final
part of class focuses on kicking paddles and
partnered drills.
"I began taekwondo last year without
any previous experience," Chow said. "I al
ways wanted to learn a martial art because
it seemed like a great way to get in shape.
In addition to getting a good workout and

hanging out with cool people, it has also
helped me build confidence by challenging
me physically and mentally."
Competitions are held year-round, with
the larger ones in the spring. Members of
the Taekwondo club who do not wish to
compete can volunteer as judges, referees,
and scorers. Judging is based largely on
technique, as taekwondo is a sport known
for its finesse.
"Taekwondo sparring isn't about brawl
ing," said graduate student team member
Patrick Lu. "There is a science to it. In
taekwondo, a less athletic player can beat a
more gifted opponent if he fights intelli
gently."
In addition to competitions, members
of the Taekwondo club perform demon
strations on campus throughout the year.
They also organize special seminars on
topics such as sparring strategies and
board- breaking.
Demo coordinator Albert Chan said he
enjoys taekwondo "because of the disci
pline it teaches, and the fact that it mixes a
good amount of flashier moves with useful
self-defense techniques."

tion, resident staff can e-mail him at
