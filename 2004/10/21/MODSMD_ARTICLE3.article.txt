report was presented at a Town

Hall meeting last night that Hen

home when the marchers arrived,
and the marchers dispersed after
about a half an hour, chanting
"We'll be back" and leaving be
hind their statement at his
doorstep.
No arrests were made, accord
ing to Stanford Police Chief Laura
Wilson.

marchers arrived at Hennessy's

Staff, students and faculty gathered last night to hear an independent committee's findings on University labor
practices. Later, more than 60 activists marched to President Hennessy's home to demand action on the issue.
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center.
While the marchers huddled
around Hennessy's front walkway,
Wilson and another officer stood at
the doorway. At one point, Wilson
told the group that Mrs. Hennessy
was not feeling well.
"I know she's not feeling well,
but maybe now she's in a situation
where she can relate to them a bit,"
said one female student in the
group, referring to Stanford staff
members.
Kvitky, along with junior Joseles
De La Cruz, were chosen by the
group to deliver the statement to
Hennessy's house, according to De
La Cruz.
Kvitky said to the crowd that An
drea Hennessy did not want to take
legal action against the marchers.
According to Wilson, the group
was trespassing on private property
and if it had continued chanting,
neighbors would have had grounds
to complain that they were disturb
ing the peace.
After the marchers left, Wilson
told The Daily, "They want to be
heard, and we don't want to arrest
people, and Mrs. Hennessy does not
want to arrest people. I'm glad we
were able to come to an agreement."
Some students in the group want
ed to have Hennessy contact her

Police called to

husband before they agreed to
leave, but the group voted at around
9:45 to adjourn to a private "debrief
ing meeting."
While debating whether to advo
cate leaving Hennessy's house, Re
becca Pratt suggested to the
marchers that the staff members
who were present might find it hard
to find the time to march again.
"It's easy for us to get here be
cause we live here, but a lot of these
people, it's not easy for them to
leave their families and be here,"
Pratt said.
However, a majority of the
marchers voted to leave. One work
er told the group in Spanish that he
had to work the next morning at 5
a.m. and wanted to go home.
"We can still be aggressive, hut
there may be nothing more we can
do tonight, right here and now," ju
nior Alayna Buckner told the group.
Wanda Alderman, who works in
Ricker Dining, explained to The
Daily why she participated in the
event.
"The managers demand a code of
conduct from us, so we demand the
same from them," Alderman said.
Alderman said a code of conduct
for the managers would represent
"core values, integrity, care, owner
ship and respect."
