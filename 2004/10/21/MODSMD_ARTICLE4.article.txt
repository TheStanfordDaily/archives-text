# MEChA, other groups fear special-fees repeat
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
About a year ago, the Stanford
Review published a series of articles
depicting MEChA as a racist organi
zation. Then in April, the student
group, formally Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan, lost its
ASSU special-fees funding.
Now that the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate is considering a bill that
would condemn the Review's ac
tions and would commit the ASSU
"to strongly and quickly support eth
nic groups in the event of potential

and future attacks," the issue of
funding for ethnic groups is again at
the forefront of campus politics. The
Senate will vote on the bill next
Tuesday.
Student leaders of ethnic groups
on campus said that they are con
cerned that their special-fees fund
ing is at risk, given what happened to
MEChA last year.
Review editor David Stat, a se
nior, contended that the bill infringes
on students' democratic rights.
"By considering this resolution,
the ASSU insults and undermines
the decision of the majority of the

campus electorate to deny MEChA
fees," he said. "Perhaps the ASSU
should not allow the campus to vote
on special fees if they do not want to
hear the student body's voice."
In its Oct. 15, 2003 issue, the Re
view compared MEChA to the mod
ern-day Ku Klux Klan. The editorial
stated, "... both MEChA and the
KKK advocate separatism of the
races because they believe their re
spective races are being contaminat
ed through interracial interaction."
The Review's editorial board,
whose members wrote the piece,
also wrote that MEChA and the

KKK are different in that MEChA is
not an organization that lynches and
terrorizes members of other races.
The same editorial also raised
questions about MEChA's special
fees funding.
"Stanford MEChA currently re
ceives more than $40,000 per year in
special fees from Stanford students
through the ASSU. We wonder what
percentage of the student body that
voted MEChA special fees knew of
the racism embedded within
|MEChA's] founding documents."
