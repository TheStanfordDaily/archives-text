# MEChA, other groups fear special-fees repeat
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
About a year ago, the Stanford
Review published a series of articles
depicting MEChA as a racist organi
zation. Then in April, the student
group, formally Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan, lost its
ASSU special-fees funding.
Now that the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate is considering a bill that
would condemn the Review's ac
tions and would commit the ASSU
"to strongly and quickly support eth
nic groups in the event of potential

and future attacks," the issue of
funding for ethnic groups is again at
the forefront of campus politics. The
Senate will vote on the bill next
Tuesday.
Student leaders of ethnic groups
on campus said that they are con
cerned that their special-fees fund
ing is at risk, given what happened to
MEChA last year.
Review editor David Stat, a se
nior, contended that the bill infringes
on students' democratic rights.
"By considering this resolution,
the ASSU insults and undermines
the decision of the majority of the

campus electorate to deny MEChA
fees," he said. "Perhaps the ASSU
should not allow the campus to vote
on special fees if they do not want to
hear the student body's voice."
In its Oct. 15, 2003 issue, the Re
view compared MEChA to the mod
ern-day Ku Klux Klan. The editorial
stated, "... both MEChA and the
KKK advocate separatism of the
races because they believe their re
spective races are being contaminat
ed through interracial interaction."
The Review's editorial board,
whose members wrote the piece,
also wrote that MEChA and the

KKK are different in that MEChA is
not an organization that lynches and
terrorizes members of other races.
The same editorial also raised
questions about MEChA's special
fees funding.
"Stanford MEChA currently re
ceives more than $40,000 per year in
special fees from Stanford students
through the ASSU. We wonder what
percentage of the student body that
voted MEChA special fees knew of
the racism embedded within
|MEChA's] founding documents."
The editorial spurred a series of follow-up arti
cles in the Review and in The Daily. In April,
MEChA lost its special-fees funding — a result,
some MEChA members argued, due in part to the
Review's allegations.
The Stanford chapter of MEChA is not alone.
At UCLA, a student group called the Bruin Re
publicans launched a campaign to have MEChA's
student government budget cut.
"We will not let MEChA escape scrutiny espe
cially after the election because we feel it's funded
bigotry," said Michael Davidson, chairman of the
California College Reublicans — a network of
campus groups affiliated with the state GOF — in
a Sept. 5 article in the Boston Globe. That article
also profiled the Stanford chapter of MEChA and
its battle with the Review.
Junior Francisco Cendejas, financial manager
and last year's co-chair of MEChA, said that when
Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante's ties to MEChA were
questioned in last year's gubernatorial recall elec
tion last year, the organization received a lot of
negative national attention.
"When far-right publications [wrote) that Bus
tamante is a racist because he was a part of
MEChA during his undergraduate years,
MEChA got national attention and made any
MEChA chapter very vulnerable," Cendejas said.
"I don't believe that the Review was targeting
MEChA specifically, but since MEChA showed
itself to be suddenly vulnerable, it was sort of like
chipping away a small piece of a larger block. This
is part of a larger conservative agenda. That's why
1 believe there will be other attacks after this."
Many ethnic group leaders across campus are
also worried about the special-fees status of their
organizations.
"In previous years, the Asian American Stu
dents Association has been very close to not re
ceiving funding, depending on shifts in the campus
climate towards students of color," wrote A ASA
co-chairs Jimmy Lu and Jen Chen, both seniors, in

an e-mail. "The vote margin varies greatly each
year, and that instability suggests that the risk of
losing special fees has not decreased this year.
MEChA's special fees loss only made explicit the
danger that always existed and still persists for
groups representing the minority student commu
nity."
Senior Rania Eltom, president of the Muslim
Students Awareness Network, expressed concern
over the possibility of many ethnic groups losing
their special fees.
"I'm very scared that history might repeat it
self," Eltom said. "I'm concerned that specific
groups will target minority organizations, and that
the student body will become complacent given
what happened to MEChA last year."
Sophomore Lauren Graham, an ASSU senator
and program coordinator for the Black Student
Union, said that many minority student groups
also undergo very high special fees refund rates
during the school year, which can limit the amount
of programming and events held each quarter.
"Over the past 10 years, students of color
groups have barely passed the special fees thresh
old to be funded by the student body," Graham
said.
She also noted that students may not want to
give up their special fees to minority groups for fi
nancial reasons.
"One aspect of the complexity |of special fees]
is that the University does not fund the groups,
and that gives autonomy and authority to the stu
dent voice." Graham said. "However, in not sup
porting these student groups, the University im
poses an almost unfair monetary burden on stu
dents. I don't believe that the only reason students
of color groups aren't passing is because of their
mission statements. It may also be a result of stu
dents not wanting to pay special fees at all."
Because of this financial burden, group leaders
hope that the University develops more estab
lished forms of funding.

Univ. funding to avoid special-fees fiasco

"Minority student groups serve an irreplace
able and important role in the Stanford communi
ty and deserve a more permanent and stable
source of financing than the special fees system
provides," Lu and Chen, the AASA co-chairs,
wrote. "Some students may feel disinclined to sup
port a student group that they do not directly ben
efit from. Stanford needs to step up and affirm its
support of minority students and diversity."
Other leaders are positive that the student
body will realize the importance of ethnic groups
and will support them with special fees.
"Stanford American Indian Organization was
in danger of losing special fees last year, but,
thankfully, the students showed their commit
ment to diversity and to helping our group with
programming this year," said junior Jackson
Brossy, SAIO co-chair.
Though the ethnic group leaders represent dif
ferent communities on campus, they all stressed
that they are supporting the larger ethnic commu
nity,
"1 feel it is important for all minority groups
and all organization on Stanford's campus to
stand together against such attacks," ASSU Sena
tor and MEChA member Luz Reyes, a sopho
more, said. "[MEChA] received great support
from the other community centers last year, and it
is important for them to know that this is not an at
tack on a specific group, but that it threatens all of
the minority groups on campus."
Many minority group leaders echoed this senti
ment.
"Even though losing special fees was damaging
to the Chicano / Latino community, it in no way
crippled our community or our organization, and
ironically MEChA is stronger this year than last
year," Cendejas said.
"If anything, it made a lot of people understand
how important it is to not take these organizations
for granted."

hear the student body's voice."
In its Oct. 15, 2003 issue, the Re
view compared MEChA to the mod
ern-day Ku Klux Klan. The editorial
stated, "... both MEChA and the
KKK advocate separatism of the
races because they believe their re
spective races are being contaminat
ed through interracial interaction."
The Review's editorial board,
whose members wrote the piece,
also wrote that MEChA and the

KKK are different in that MEChA is
not an organization that lynches and
terrorizes members of other races.
The same editorial also raised
questions about MEChA's special
fees funding.
"Stanford MEChA currently re
ceives more than $40,000 per year in
special fees from Stanford students
through the ASSU. We wonder what
percentage of the student body that
voted MEChA special fees knew of
the racism embedded within
|MEChA's] founding documents."
The editorial spurred a series of follow-up arti
cles in the Review and in The Daily. In April,
MEChA lost its special-fees funding — a result,
some MEChA members argued, due in part to the
Review's allegations.
The Stanford chapter of MEChA is not alone.
At UCLA, a student group called the Bruin Re
publicans launched a campaign to have MEChA's
student government budget cut.
"We will not let MEChA escape scrutiny espe
cially after the election because we feel it's funded
bigotry," said Michael Davidson, chairman of the
California College Reublicans — a network of
campus groups affiliated with the state GOF — in
a Sept. 5 article in the Boston Globe. That article
also profiled the Stanford chapter of MEChA and
its battle with the Review.
Junior Francisco Cendejas, financial manager
and last year's co-chair of MEChA, said that when
Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante's ties to MEChA were
questioned in last year's gubernatorial recall elec
tion last year, the organization received a lot of
negative national attention.
"When far-right publications [wrote) that Bus
tamante is a racist because he was a part of
MEChA during his undergraduate years,
MEChA got national attention and made any
MEChA chapter very vulnerable," Cendejas said.
"I don't believe that the Review was targeting
MEChA specifically, but since MEChA showed
itself to be suddenly vulnerable, it was sort of like
chipping away a small piece of a larger block. This
is part of a larger conservative agenda. That's why
1 believe there will be other attacks after this."
Many ethnic group leaders across campus are
also worried about the special-fees status of their
organizations.
"In previous years, the Asian American Stu
dents Association has been very close to not re
ceiving funding, depending on shifts in the campus
climate towards students of color," wrote A ASA
co-chairs Jimmy Lu and Jen Chen, both seniors, in

an e-mail. "The vote margin varies greatly each
year, and that instability suggests that the risk of
losing special fees has not decreased this year.
MEChA's special fees loss only made explicit the
danger that always existed and still persists for
groups representing the minority student commu
nity."
Senior Rania Eltom, president of the Muslim
Students Awareness Network, expressed concern
over the possibility of many ethnic groups losing
their special fees.
"I'm very scared that history might repeat it
self," Eltom said. "I'm concerned that specific
groups will target minority organizations, and that
the student body will become complacent given
what happened to MEChA last year."
Sophomore Lauren Graham, an ASSU senator
and program coordinator for the Black Student
Union, said that many minority student groups
also undergo very high special fees refund rates
during the school year, which can limit the amount
of programming and events held each quarter.
"Over the past 10 years, students of color
groups have barely passed the special fees thresh
old to be funded by the student body," Graham
said.
She also noted that students may not want to
give up their special fees to minority groups for fi
nancial reasons.
"One aspect of the complexity |of special fees]
is that the University does not fund the groups,
and that gives autonomy and authority to the stu
dent voice." Graham said. "However, in not sup
porting these student groups, the University im
poses an almost unfair monetary burden on stu
dents. I don't believe that the only reason students
of color groups aren't passing is because of their
mission statements. It may also be a result of stu
dents not wanting to pay special fees at all."
Because of this financial burden, group leaders
hope that the University develops more estab
lished forms of funding.

MEChA, other ethnic groups push for
Univ. funding to avoid special-fees fiasco

"Minority student groups serve an irreplace
able and important role in the Stanford communi
ty and deserve a more permanent and stable
source of financing than the special fees system
provides," Lu and Chen, the AASA co-chairs,
wrote. "Some students may feel disinclined to sup
port a student group that they do not directly ben
efit from. Stanford needs to step up and affirm its
support of minority students and diversity."
Other leaders are positive that the student
body will realize the importance of ethnic groups
and will support them with special fees.
"Stanford American Indian Organization was
in danger of losing special fees last year, but,
thankfully, the students showed their commit
ment to diversity and to helping our group with
programming this year," said junior Jackson
Brossy, SAIO co-chair.
Though the ethnic group leaders represent dif
ferent communities on campus, they all stressed
that they are supporting the larger ethnic commu
nity,
"1 feel it is important for all minority groups
and all organization on Stanford's campus to
stand together against such attacks," ASSU Sena
tor and MEChA member Luz Reyes, a sopho
more, said. "[MEChA] received great support
from the other community centers last year, and it
is important for them to know that this is not an at
tack on a specific group, but that it threatens all of
the minority groups on campus."
Many minority group leaders echoed this senti
ment.
"Even though losing special fees was damaging
to the Chicano / Latino community, it in no way
crippled our community or our organization, and
ironically MEChA is stronger this year than last
year," Cendejas said.
"If anything, it made a lot of people understand
how important it is to not take these organizations
for granted."
About a year ago, the Stanford
Review published a series of articles
depicting MEChA as a racist organi
zation. Then in April, the student
group, formally Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan, lost its
ASSU special-fees funding.
Now that the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate is considering a bill that
would condemn the Review's ac
tions and would commit the ASSU
"to strongly and quickly support eth
nic groups in the event of potential

and future attacks," the issue of
funding for ethnic groups is again at
the forefront of campus politics. The
Senate will vote on the bill next
Tuesday.
Student leaders of ethnic groups
on campus said that they are con
cerned that their special-fees fund
ing is at risk, given what happened to
MEChA last year.
Review editor David Stat, a se
nior, contended that the bill infringes
on students' democratic rights.
"By considering this resolution,
the ASSU insults and undermines
the decision of the majority of the

campus electorate to deny MEChA
fees," he said. "Perhaps the ASSU
should not allow the campus to vote
on special fees if they do not want to
hear the student body's voice."
