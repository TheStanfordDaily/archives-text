# Tensions boil as Holocaust survivor decries treatment of Palestinians
## 
### ANDREW BURMON 
Hedy Epstein, an 80-year-old
Holocaust survivor and champion of
the Palestinian cause in Israel, spoke
at the History Corner last night to
address the Israeli-Palestinian con
flict. The event, which was spon
sored by the Coalition for Justice in
the Middle East and the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network, was
marked by tensions from the outset.
Announcements billing the talk,
put up around campus by event or
ganizers last week, juxtaposed an
image of Jews in Nazi Germany with
an image of Palestinians at Israeli
checkpoints.
The flier appalled members of
Stanford's Jewish community and
prompted the Stanford Israel Al
liance and the Jewish Leadership
Council to send letters to MSAN,
CJME and several administrators
including Vice Provost John Brav
man.
The letter argued that any com
parison between Israelis and Nazis
"could risk offending Jews and incit
ing others against them."

Sensing a potential controversy,
CJME co-president Omar Shakir, a
sophomore, prefaced his introduc
tion of Epstein by assuring the audi
ence that no direct comparison be
tween Israelis and Nazis was intend
ed by the posters or would be ex
pressed by Epstein in her remarks.
Epstein insisted that she "did not
compare situations" and restrained
from making direct comparisons be
tween Nazis and Israelis. She largely
avoided discussing her own back
ground as a Holocaust survivor —
she left Germany through the
Kindertransport when she was eight
years old — and focused instead on
her experiences protesting in Israel.
Epstein said she had been shot at
with live ammunition and tear-gas
canisters by Israeli soldiers.
On a recent trip to Israel, airport
security guards informed her that
based on her history as an activist
she was considered a terrorist threat.
She was subsequently stripped and
cavity-searched.
She concluded her remarks by
sharing a thought she had while
standing in the shadow of Israel's

new security fence.
"When I stood next to that wall. I
remembered what the motto of
Holocaust survivors was: 'Never
again,'" she said. Epstein shook her
head and continued. "We Jews are

doing this."
Several times during the talk, Ep
stein was interrupted by the shout
ing of outraged audience members,
many of whom were associated with
off-campus Jewish groups. One man
threatened "legal action." Another
yelled that the speech was "just too
much"."
Epstein cited the outbursts as "a
good example of how Israelis speak
to Palestinians."
San Jose resident Darlene Wal
lach, co-founder of the group Justice
for Palestinians, jumped hurriedly to
her feet and yelled "Shame on you!"
at Epstein's detractors.
By the end of the speech, the ten
sion in the room warranted the ar
rival of two Public Safety officers,
who quietly moved closer to Ep
stein.

cized Epstein for what he perceived
as her selective interpretation of the
conflict.
"She totally ignores the fact that
Israel was willing to offer the Pales
tinians a state,"he said.
In an effort to undermine her
credibility, unidentified protesters
circulated fliers claiming that the In
ternational Solidarity Movement, to
which Epstein has ties, has been
known to "advocate terrorist vio
lence, excuse suicide bombings and
advocate cutting holes in Israel's
fence."
At the end of the question-and
answer session, Epstein was asked
what she hoped her audience would
remember from the evening.
"I hope you remember the mem
bers of the audience who were re
spectful," she said, adding, "I am
very sorry and very appalled that my
fellow Jews behaved so abysmally."
