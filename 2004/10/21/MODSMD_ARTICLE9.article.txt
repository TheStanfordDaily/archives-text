1991 — On Oct. 21, The Daily ran a
story about the conclusion of an in
vestigation that suspected arson as
the cause of a fire destroying a former
fraternity house. Below is an ex
cerpt:
"Local fire officials ended their
investigation this weekend of the
fire that gutted the former Delta
Tau Delta house, saying they 'highly
suspect arson' hut know little else
about how it began.
'It was definitely very suspicious
in origin,' said Battalion Chief Don
ald Dudak of the Palo Alto Fire De
partment. However, investigations
said the extensive damage caused by
the fire made it impossible to discov
er even in what section of the house
the fire began.
The investigation has been
passed along to the state fire mar
shal's office.
The fire started early on the
morning of Oct. 11 in the con
demned wooden structure that was
formerly the Delt house. Fire offi
cials were called to the blaze at 2:03
a.m., and 48 firefighters struggled
for over an hour to bring the blaze
under control.
By the time they did, the struc
ture had burned to the ground.
1977 — On Oct. 21, The Daily ran a
story about the University joining a
program encouraging minorities.and
women to pursue doctoral degrees.
Below is an excerpt:

"The University has joined with 19
other universities in a program de
signed to seek out and encourage po
tential minority and women doctoral
applicants at the undergraduate level,
according to W. Blis Carnochan, dean
of graduate studies.
The action is a response to the
decline in minority applications to
and enrollment in doctoral pro
grams in the past few years, he said.
Carnochan and Associate Dean
Arthud Walker said they hope the
program will help increase the num
ber of qualified minority and
women applicants.
In a report to the Faculty Senate
last spring, Carnochan and Waleker
stated, 'While progress in the enroll
ment of women is being made in
many areas, the euphoric increase in
graduate applications and admis
sions of minority students generated
by the impact of the civil rights
movement of the early '60s, and
swelled by the return of older stu
dents to achieve postponed educa
tional goals, now appears to be over.
'Any further progress will only
come with a more systematic ap
proach than in the past.'
Carnochan said better job
prospects for business, law and med
ical school graduates may have at
tracted qualified minority students
away from the less lucrative fields of
university teaching and research.
