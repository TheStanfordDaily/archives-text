Secularists Have Children Too!
• Too often we hear that untruth: If you take away God, the
moral life is put in jeopardy. That makes as much sense as say
ing an ethical society depends on citizens believing in an after
life. Actually, an intense belief in some reward after death can
lead to monstrous actions, as demonstrated by suicide
bombers who have dehumanized their victims. Religion can be
dangerous to your health!
• Where do people go when they aren't happy with what con
ventional religions offer as religious education for grade school
children? Such parents aren't hostile to what can be uplifting in
myths -- understood as such -- but they don't want their chil
dren to have to unlearn later what they picked up in the typi
cal Sunday School.
• Our children will soon face the challenge of living in the real
world, drawing on the secular resources offered in literature
and the sciences so they can create meaningful lives and
make this world a better place. We secular parents don't want
our offspring distracted by dreams about some other world, nor
do we want them to pick up the prejudices that unfortunately
contaminate so many religions.
• Explore what's being offered by the Humanist Community every
Sunday from 10:45 AM to 12:15 PM at the Mitchell Park
Community Center, 3800 Middlefield Road, between
Charleston and East Meadow, Palo Alto.
• The typical session begins with introductions all around, singing
and music, and the discovery of what the story of the day will
be. It's a natural way for children to explore the realm of values,
become aware of how to deal with their peers in a healthy
manner, and lay the sound foundations of an ethical worldview
that's not dependent on any theological claims.
• Also a Forum for adults runs from 11 AM to Noon, followed by
an intergenerational luncheon provided by the Humanist
Community. Coffee and socializing before and after, naturally.
For more information check our website www.humanists.org or
call 650-726-3185.
