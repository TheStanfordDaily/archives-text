America's choice
When American citizens go to the polls in November,
they will have the opportunity to change the course of history.
On their decision largely rests the style and structure of the
immediate future. If they choose wisely, they will elect a
President committed to fostering the well-being of all who
long for peace and justice in our troubled world; who realize
that peace and justice are the outcome of trust, and who are
prepared to share the vast resources of their country to cre
ate that tnist.
The alternative is too terrible to contemplate: a mount
ing program of war and terror and counter-terror; a tighten
ing grip on the traditional freedoms of the American people;
a breakdown of relations with other countries; and a pariah'
reputation among the nations for the proud United States.
Who would knowingly make such a choice?
Beleaguered
,\s the day of destiny approaches, the minds of many turn
to the beleaguered people of America whom, now, so many
despise and hate. They pray for the deliverance of its people
from the cruel and crude exponents of illegal, usurped pow er.
They call for every peace-loving American to raise their voice
against the warmongering of the present administration, and
to cast their vote in like fashion.
Canker
Of course, America is not alone at fault for the inequali
ties of the world, the basic canker in our midst, the source of
all our troubles. It shares the blame with all the developed
countries who ride roughshod and cavalier over the poor and
struggling, and must awaken to this main source of tension
— and terror.
Therein lies the fault of the Western world; these 'suc
cessful' countries owe their wealth and dominance largely to
history, and their ability to manipulate the world's economy to
their own advantage through aggressive 'market forces.' The
world's poor and destitute now demand their share. If this
simple right of justice is not addressed and remedied, the
world will know no peace. Terrorism will fester and grow into
war, which will threaten the future of the people of Earth.
We, your Elder Brothers, cannot stand aside and watch
while the very future of the world is under threat. America is
a great nation with much of good to give the world. It must
now awaken to its soul's longing to sene, to live in peace and
justice, and. together, in harmony and co-operation, to work
with all nations to remake this world.
This election can be a great turning point in the affairs of
men. Cast your vote. We beg you, for justice, sharing and
peace.
