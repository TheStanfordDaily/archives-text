## Card seek fifth win of season on Homecoming 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tomorrow, in its Homecoming game, Stanford
will play what several Cardinal seniors characterized
as "our biggest game in three years."
And, in the wake of last weekend's key win at
Washington State, there is indeed a lot to play for as
Oregon comes to town.
There's position in the Pacific-10 Conference:
Stanford (4-2 overall) and Oregon (3-3) share identi
cal 2-1 records in the Pac-10.
There's bowl eligibility: a win by the Cardinal
would leave them just one victory shy of their first
winning season since 2001 and all but guarantee them
a bowl berth.
And, lastly, there's pride: the Ducks have won
their last two contests against the Cardinal by a com
bined score of 76-14.
But, as anyone can see — and as the Cardinal
players will tell you — this is a different squad and a
different season. Playing Oregon at Stanford Stadi
um for the first time since 1997, the Cardinal are
three-point favorites — which is Vegas' way of say
ing, Stanford should win, but it could be a wild one.
These two teams have always run up the score
when they face off. In seven of their last nine meet
ings, both teams have scored three or more touch
downs, including sky-high final scores like 58-49,63-
28,49-42.51-22 and 38-34.
This year's showdown might be a little different,
though.
Oregon has the Pac-10's best pass defense, yield
ing just 174.5 yards per game through the air. Its rush
defense isn't too shabby, either, ranking sixth in the
conference with an average allowance of 128.8 yards
per game.
Meanwhile. Stanford ranks an impressive second
in the Pac-10 in scoring defense, allowing just 16.2
points per game, thanks to a takeaway-minded pass
defense (nine interceptions) and a stingy run defense
that yields just 3.0 yards per carry.
Of course, Kellen Clemens could change all that.
The junior quarterback has thrown fora frighten
ing total of 1,603 yards and 12 touchdowns against
just three interceptions this year, while displaying im
pressive mobility. Against Washington State, he
threw for three scores and ran for three more, and last
week against Arizona, he was 21-of-30 for 336 yards.
Not surprisingly, Oregon head coach Mike Belotti
couldn't be happier with his starter.
"That game against Washington State, which was,
really, the best offensive game by a player in the con
ference this year, was pretty amazing, and he fol
lowed that up with probably his best game of the year
against Arizona," Belotti said. "It may hot have been
as spectacular statistically, but it was overall a better

performance. I'm very pleased with his development
and where he's at right now."
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens could only
agree with Belotti's assessment.
"Clemens is developing rapidly," he said. "He's a
good decision-maker and an athletic individual who is
not afraid to run the football and is tough to contain."
Other than Clemens, the key Duck is Terrence
Whitehead. The junior from Crenshaw is averaging
5.7 yards per carry. His 566 rushing yards rank first on
the team, and his 22 receptions rank second. The all
purpose player has a team-high six touchdowns for
the season.
The Ducks, as always, have some fleet-footed re
ceivers and a strong tight end. Tight end Tim Day, a
load at 6-foot-4 and 268 pounds, has 20 catches and
four touchdowns. Receiver Demetrius Williams
checks in at 6-foot-2 and has a team-high 36 catches
for 491 yards.
The Ducks have some weak wings, however. Se
nior Jared Siegel, one of the most talented kickers in
the Pac-10, was a first-team All-Pac-10 selection two
years ago, but is just 3-for-6 this season. And, the
team's propensity for penalties has frustrated Belotti
all season.
Oregon ranks last in the Pac-10 in both number of
penalties (62) and yards (590), with the referees' yellow
flags costing them almost 100 yards a game. They've
also turned the ball over 15 times, ranking ninth in the
Pac-10 with a minus-0.67 turnover differential.
"I think possession of the football and nagging
penalties are hampering us a little bit," Belotti said.
"I think we're actually executing pretty well [other
than that]."
The Ducks hope they can continue their success
tomorrow, but they know they'll have their hands full
with the Cardinal.
Trent Edwards leads Stanford's aerial attack, hav
ing thrown for 1,390 yards and eight touchdowns
against five interceptions. His top targets are 6-foot
-7 Evan Moore (23 catches, five touchdowns), 6-foot
-5 Alex Smith (25 catches, one touchdown), 6-foot-4
Justin McCullum (20 catches, one touchdown) and 6-
foot-2 Mark Bradford.
"We'll put springs on the bottoms of our little
guys' shoes so we can match up with those guys," Be
lotti joked.
Running backs J.R. Lemon and Kenneth Tolon
have combined to rush for 101.9 yards per game and
eight touchdowns this season, and both will get their
chances tomorrow.
"J.R. is more of a power type guy and Kenneth has
more of a 'wiggle,"' Teevens said. "They both do a
good job of making cuts, and I think they comple
ment one another. It makes it difficult fora defense
to prepare for both of them at the same time."
Stanford will also try to win an edge on special
teams, as T.J. Rushing's 33.6 average ranks him first
in the Pac-10 and fourth in the nation. Kicker Michael
Sgroi ranks 17th in the nation in field goals (he's
made nine in 12 attempts) and punter Jay Ottovegio
(40.9 gross average) is bidding to be the first-ever
Stanford freshman to average more than 40 yards.
Tomorrow's kickoff is set for 2 p.m. at Stanford
Stadium. With a win, the Cardinal would achieve a 5-
2 start for the first time since 2001, when the team fin
ished 9-3 and played in the Seattle Bowl.

Senior running back J.R. Lemon leads tfie team with 421 yards rushing this season but was held to 61 yards in his last two
games. Lemon will look to bounce back against an Oregon defense that has given up an average of 128.8 rushing yards
per game, as the Cardinal host the Ducks for Homecoming tomorrow. Kickoff is set for 2 p.m.
