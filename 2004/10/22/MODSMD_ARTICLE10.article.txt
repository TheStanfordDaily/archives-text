# Pinkertons: a David Lynch-inspired musical?
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Pinkertons," Stanford's first full-length
student-written musical in over 15 years,
won't exactly he the same old song and
dance.
It is heing billed as an experimental mu
sical that will "test the bounds of an audi
ence's perceptual limits while still convey
ing the narrative," according to producer
Rebecca Liao, a sophomore.
Auditions for the show will be held on
Monday and Tuesday at Cubberley Audito
rium from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. There are 14 to
16 dramatic roles to be cast, along with nu
merous opportunities for musicians, com
posers. technicians, set and costume design
ers. and other artists who want to con
tribute.
The show's playwright, senior Mike
Solomon, wrote his first musical when he
was in sixth grade. More recently, he
penned "Gaieties" in 2002 and 2003.
Solomon dreamed up the show's
premise — a tale of codependency between
two Pinkerton detectives — three years ago

before successfully pitching the script to
Ram's Head Theatrical Society for financial
backing in the winter of 2002.
Ram's Head and Friends of Music at
Stanford are co-sponsoring the $ 10,000 pro
duction, which is set to run during Parent's
Week, beginning Feb. 23,2005.
"I really see this as a unique opportunity
in Stanford theatre because it invests a lot in
actors to create from scratch their own in
terpretations of the characters." Solomon
said.
He said the three-act musical will incor
porate computer-generated music, unique
costumes and sets and an experimental script
that challenges the audience to make its own
judgments of the actions onstage, while re
maining accessible to a broad community.
"The show also incorporates a tradition
al narrative — a lot of the time, people shirk
away from the experimental because it
winds up being too idiosyncratic and esoter
ic to relate to," Solomon added.
Liao said she hoped the shim's inven
tiveness would be intellectually stimulating
for audience members.
"We're hoping that, because it is experi

mental, people will walk out of the theatre
thinking about something."
Solomon cited Stephen Sondheim's first
experimental college production, "The
Frogs," as an example of the potential for
students involved in experimental shows
like "Pinkertons.
Sondheim, David Lynch and Shirley
Jackson's "The Lottery" all inspired the
Solomon's vision for the musical.
"Pinkertons" organizers are also mind
ful of setting a precedent for future student
productions. "Hopefully, other students
will be inspired," Liao said.
In addition to opening up new prospects
in student theatre. Solomon stressed collab
oration within Stanford's art community as
a major goal of the production.
"The Stanford art community has been
growing for years," he said. "With collective
strength, you can get an even greater mes
sage across."
" This could be a great next step for the
art community to not only be portrayed
alongside each other, but also to collabo
rate with each other across disciplines," he
added.
