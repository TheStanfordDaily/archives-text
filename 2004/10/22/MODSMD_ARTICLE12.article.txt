# Touching tongues
## Where's our Miss Bliss? 
### 
Think of an awkward white boy
with a fro of short curly hair, a pre
pubescent voice and no subsequent
career. Let's add a soon-to-be-strip
per, singing "I'm so excited" as she
overdoses on diet pills. And just for
fun. throw a huge cell phone into the
mix.
What's missing? Mr. Belding,
something about a tortoise, a big
huge cell phone, the wrestler with
the curly mullet and — of most per
tinence to our discussion — Miss
Bliss.
Were the producers of "Saved By
the Bell" trying to send us sublimi
nal messages about faculty by mak
ing the teacher's name so porno
graphic? Your columnists believe
so, and it's just starting to work. As

we enter our
senior year,
we too have
started to
search for
Stanford's
very own
Miss Bliss, or
the T.A.
equivalent.
That's
right, we
walked into
our first lec
ture, and as

our eyes
alighted upon the middle-aged guy
with the briefcase at the front of the
room, we found ourselves mutter
ing, "Giggity, giggity."
It may seem sick, but give it a
moment: Freshman year, we know
you chose the hot T.F.'s section so
you'd have something pretty to
look at while your classmates dis
cussed Boccaccio (isn't that an Ital
ian flatbread?) for an hour and a
half. The only difference now is that
you want to go to office hours and,
well, bone down.
Of course, there are a few com
plications to the "doing a Prof or
T.A." scenario.
Amazingly enough, even a few of
those hermaphroditic ground sloth
specialists have found members of
the same species willing to mate con
tinuously with them. Some of them
even made it legal. It's not some
thing your columnists try to under
stand, but marriage is a stumbling
block in all departments.
Even harder for us to understand
is that some of this hermaphroditic
ground sloth specialist mating has
produced offspring. The cutthroat in
us says if the kids are below two
years old. they're too young to re
member a hot affair between their
academic parent and a sexy under
grad. Two to four is a bit shadier, so
proceed with caution. Older than
that, and you'll have to have your
R.A. fill out a consent form.
We know you might be ready to
put down the paper, but let us be
frank. All the freshmen look like
they should be wearing finger-paint
smeared smocks and learning how
to tie their shoes, and you've already
hooked up with everybody else.
Now don't get angry, frosh are
nice. I mean, they're sort of like
baby zoo animals: cute to look at,
but you don't want to clean up their
poop or anything. And you most
certainly don't want to date them.
Which brings us to our point:
baby rhinos and tigers are just too
young. What you really want is the
lion tamer or maybe the seal han
dler. Okay, now that we've taken a
tire iron to the dead horse that is this
metaphor, what we're trying to say
(you've been so patient!) is that by
senior year, the pickins are slimmer
than they've ever been, so if you've
got a hot prof you're a lucky bitch.
And you're probably not in any of
Erin's classes.
P.S. Let us be clear, if you choose
to accept your mission, and you and
your pervy self get caught, don't go
blaming our column.

they should be wearing finger-paint
smeared smocks and learning how
to tie their shoes, and you've already
hooked up with everybody else.
Now don't get angry, frosh are
nice. I mean, they're sort of like
baby zoo animals: cute to look at,
but you don't want to clean up their
poop or anything. And you most
certainly don't want to date them.
Which brings us to our point:
baby rhinos and tigers are just too
young. What you really want is the
lion tamer or maybe the seal han
dler. Okay, now that we've taken a
tire iron to the dead horse that is this
metaphor, what we're trying to say
(you've been so patient!) is that by
senior year, the pickins are slimmer
than they've ever been, so if you've
got a hot prof you're a lucky bitch.
And you're probably not in any of
Erin's classes.
P.S. Let us be clear, if you choose
to accept your mission, and you and
your pervy self get caught, don't go
blaming our column.
