# The 						motorized scooter: Could it be...
## The 						new Harley-Davidson? 
### NOAH WEISS 
Imagine leaving Stern Hall and rac
ing to the bookstore in 20 seconds,
class in 30 seconds and University Av
enue in under two minutes. With his
homebuilt minibike, junior Dan Pre
ble can speed past the Claw and up
Palm Drive at 40 miles per hour.
"It's a blast and one of the most en
joyable things I do here." Preble said.
He and his friends devoted six years of
labor to building his bike, which looks
like the 'Honey. I Shrunk the Kids'
version of a Chopper, decked out with
oversized Goodyear tricycle tires and
an engine twice the size of the helmet
he has never worn.
"I was walking to class one day
freshman year and 1 thought to myself.
That would be the fastest thing on
campus."' Preble recalled. He now en
joys "passing cars on campus, coming
from the bike lane to fly by somebody
[and riding] in front of the bookstore at
full speed [to watch] the way people
kind of run out of the way."
Walking through the morning clock
tower rush has always been an exercise
in dodging bikers, rollerbladers and
skateboarders. But now there are a
growing number of motorized scooters
and minibikes to evade, and they're
quickly creeping up on the monopoly
biking has held on Stanford trans
portation.
So far, motorized scooters have
been popular mainly with exhausted
athletes and speed mavens. But many
predict that as cheaper and lower
maintenance models come out, the al
lure of an effortless ride across campus
will likely grow stronger.
More than just the thirst for speed,
many minibike riders are driven by
sheer laziness.
Sophomore Brice Rolston, a mem
ber of the gymnastics team, bought a
gas powered Goped GSR-40.

"I was far too lazy to ride my bike,
and definitely too cheap to buy a car,"
he said.
For many freshman football play
ers, a $99 electric scooter on sale at
Safeway was the purchase of the sum
mer.
Freshman player Nate Wilcox-
Fogel said that during training camp in
August, when he and his teammates
lifted weights in the morning and ran
drills and practiced in the afternoon,
many were too worn-out to ride a bike.
Wilcox-Fogel said that over half of
the freshman football players now use
motorized scooters and he predicted
that the general Stanford population
will begin using them more as soon as
"they get over the fact that they're
scooters."
Rolston offered another explana
tion for why minibikes are more popu
lar among athletes.
"Riding your bike after a four-hour
practice and riding your bike after four
hours of physics in the library are two
totally different things." he said.
One downside Rolston admitted
was that "you look way less cool" on a
Goped than on a bike. "In fact, you
look downright stupid." he said.
Junior Chris Martinez agreed.
"They're always trying to cut me
off." he complained. "There's all these
athletes trying to look cool with their
little motor bikes. It's something other
people don't have. It's like, i'm a pimp
and 1 can beat you in a race, but 1 can
also beat you with this little motorbike,
so it's an extra slap in the face.'"
Even football player freshman
Carlos McFall admitted that watch
ing an enormous 305-pound offen
sive lineman racing up a hill on a
scooter the size of a clown bike was
an amusing sight.
Notwithstanding the benefits of
convenience, there are safety concerns.
"The brakes are pretty shitty, so

you can't slow down fast enough,"
noted Wilcox-Fogel.
"There is nothing safe about going
30 miles per hour on an under-braked
machine with tires the size of the
training wheels on a kiddy bike,"
Rolston said.
Martinez suggested that motorized
bikes and scooters should have a speed
cap of 15 miles per hour, which is the
average bike speed.
Despite the dangers of bolting
around campus at twice the speed of
bikes with less powerful brakes,
minibike riders claim that they stay
safe.
"In general I'm more aware on
campus than most bicyclists," Preble
said. "I'm more concerned about
other people's safety."
Both Rolston and Preble claim that
they have never had a collision.
Martinez said that minibikes
"make a lot of noise, even more than
electric golf carts."
Owning and maintaining a
minibike is also much more demand
ing than keeping a bicycle. Preble
warned that most people aren't pre
pared for all the maintenance time.
Rolston noted that most people
won't want to deal with poorly tuned
carburetors or misaligned sprockets.
Many of the Safeway scooters have
already begun to break down, with
seat pins falling out and tires flattening
so the rims get bent. Wilcox-Fogel said
that keeping scooters from falling
apart has been a challenging task.
But if you need to get from Escon
dido Village to the Medical School in
under a minute a minibike pushing 30
miles per hour could be the perfect fit.
But as you blow past bikers and
slalom around cars on your way to
Human Anatomy class, make sure you
wind up at the Med School, not the
Stanford hospital.

practice and riding your bike after four
hours of physics in the library are two
totally different things." he said.
One downside Rolston admitted
was that "you look way less cool" on a
Goped than on a bike. "In fact, you
look downright stupid." he said.
Junior Chris Martinez agreed.
"They're always trying to cut me
off." he complained. "There's all these
athletes trying to look cool with their
little motor bikes. It's something other
people don't have. It's like, i'm a pimp
and 1 can beat you in a race, but 1 can
also beat you with this little motorbike,
so it's an extra slap in the face.'"
Even football player freshman
Carlos McFall admitted that watch
ing an enormous 305-pound offen
sive lineman racing up a hill on a
scooter the size of a clown bike was
an amusing sight.
Notwithstanding the benefits of
convenience, there are safety concerns.
"The brakes are pretty shitty, so

you can't slow down fast enough,"
noted Wilcox-Fogel.
"There is nothing safe about going
30 miles per hour on an under-braked
machine with tires the size of the
training wheels on a kiddy bike,"
Rolston said.
Martinez suggested that motorized
bikes and scooters should have a speed
cap of 15 miles per hour, which is the
average bike speed.
Despite the dangers of bolting
around campus at twice the speed of
bikes with less powerful brakes,
minibike riders claim that they stay
safe.
"In general I'm more aware on
campus than most bicyclists," Preble
said. "I'm more concerned about
other people's safety."
Both Rolston and Preble claim that
they have never had a collision.
Martinez said that minibikes
"make a lot of noise, even more than
electric golf carts."
Owning and maintaining a
minibike is also much more demand
ing than keeping a bicycle. Preble
warned that most people aren't pre
pared for all the maintenance time.
Rolston noted that most people
won't want to deal with poorly tuned
carburetors or misaligned sprockets.
Many of the Safeway scooters have
already begun to break down, with
seat pins falling out and tires flattening
so the rims get bent. Wilcox-Fogel said
that keeping scooters from falling
apart has been a challenging task.
But if you need to get from Escon
dido Village to the Medical School in
under a minute a minibike pushing 30
miles per hour could be the perfect fit.
But as you blow past bikers and
slalom around cars on your way to
Human Anatomy class, make sure you
wind up at the Med School, not the
Stanford hospital.

Junior Dan Preble showcases his homemade "minibike," which he
uses to zip around campus at 40 miles per hour. Can you do that
on your Trek? Yeah, I didn't think so.

No need to spend six years making your own motorized scooter, as Dan Preble did (above left); many already assembled options are available these days (above right). Safeway recently had
a sale on electric scooters, selling them for $99.
Imagine leaving Stern Hall and rac
ing to the bookstore in 20 seconds,
class in 30 seconds and University Av
enue in under two minutes. With his
homebuilt minibike, junior Dan Pre
ble can speed past the Claw and up
Palm Drive at 40 miles per hour.
"It's a blast and one of the most en
joyable things I do here." Preble said.
He and his friends devoted six years of
labor to building his bike, which looks
like the 'Honey. I Shrunk the Kids'
version of a Chopper, decked out with
oversized Goodyear tricycle tires and
an engine twice the size of the helmet
he has never worn.
"I was walking to class one day
freshman year and 1 thought to myself.
That would be the fastest thing on
campus."' Preble recalled. He now en
joys "passing cars on campus, coming
from the bike lane to fly by somebody
[and riding] in front of the bookstore at
full speed [to watch] the way people
kind of run out of the way."
Walking through the morning clock
tower rush has always been an exercise
in dodging bikers, rollerbladers and
skateboarders. But now there are a
growing number of motorized scooters
and minibikes to evade, and they're
quickly creeping up on the monopoly
biking has held on Stanford trans
portation.
So far, motorized scooters have
been popular mainly with exhausted
athletes and speed mavens. But many
predict that as cheaper and lower
maintenance models come out, the al
lure of an effortless ride across campus
will likely grow stronger.
More than just the thirst for speed,
many minibike riders are driven by
sheer laziness.
Sophomore Brice Rolston, a mem
ber of the gymnastics team, bought a
gas powered Goped GSR-40.

"I was far too lazy to ride my bike,
and definitely too cheap to buy a car,"
he said.
For many freshman football play
ers, a $99 electric scooter on sale at
Safeway was the purchase of the sum
mer.
Freshman player Nate Wilcox-
Fogel said that during training camp in
August, when he and his teammates
lifted weights in the morning and ran
drills and practiced in the afternoon,
many were too worn-out to ride a bike.
Wilcox-Fogel said that over half of
the freshman football players now use
motorized scooters and he predicted
that the general Stanford population
will begin using them more as soon as
"they get over the fact that they're
scooters."
Rolston offered another explana
tion for why minibikes are more popu
lar among athletes.
"Riding your bike after a four-hour
practice and riding your bike after four
hours of physics in the library are two
totally different things." he said.
One downside Rolston admitted
