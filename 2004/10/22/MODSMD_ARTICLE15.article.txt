## Editorial Groups can defend themselves 
### 
The ASSU last night decided to revise its pro
posed advocacy bill designed to help defend stu
dent groups from attacks or criticisms by others
on campus. The bill has improved, but not
enough to justify passing it.
The original bill was introduced earlier this week by
ASSIJ Senator ()mar Shakir. Addressing the concern of
community centers and ethnic organizations, the advoca
cy bill was designed to assure them that the ASSU would
take greater steps to uphold their standing in the Stanford
community.
In particular, the bill originally had a clause condemn
ing The Stanford Review's commentary critical of the
Latino umbrella organization MEChA last year.
The revised bill has left out that controversial clause,
although Shakir said the intent of protecting student
groups against other groups' attacks would still remain.
Now the bill is worded more generally, to include student
groups of all kinds.
According to Shakir. the ASSU would "educate stu
dents'' when a student group is attacked, taking measures
such as submitting op-eds to The Daily and fliering
around campus.
Shakir used the case of MEChA as an example. Last
year, a Stanford Review editorial compared the group to
the Ku Klux Klan and urged students not to vote for its
special fees. When MEChA came up on the special-fees
ballot that spring, it did not receive enough votes to re
ceive special-fees funding, leading many to believe The
Review was responsible for giving the organization a bad
reputation.
Under the new bill, the ASSU would have worked to
defend the group in that situation. The hypothetical
prt >|m >situ >n wt uild have pointed tut that the founding doc
umentsof MEChA had been written over 30 years ago and
i hat the Review's charges of racism based on these sources
simply were not true anymore.
It is questionable how useful the ASSU's efforts in this
regard would be. Lately, the ASSU has had its own diffi
culties in communicating with student groups, such as ear

lier this month when it was late in notifying groups of
changes to the way special fees would be distributed this
school year.
But even if the ASSU could be successful in such pub
licity campaigns, that's not the best use of the student gov
ernment's resources. When students elect their ASSU
senators, they choose them in order to represent their
views, not change them.
The purpose of the special-fees system is to give stu
dents the right to choose which groups they believe de
serve funding and which groups they believe do not. The
ASSU's proposed bill would have the student govern
ment attempting to intervene in this process to sway vot
ers toward certain groups.
It is understandable that the ASSU wants every stu
dent group on campus to feel included and welcomed in
the greater community. However, rather than taking sides
and devoting resources to helping out attacked groups,
the ASSU should focus on its own work and leave it to the
groups to figure out conflicts amongst themselves.
Every individual on campus has the right to free
speech. This means that groups have the right to criticize
other groups, but it also means that the attacked groups
can defend themselves.
We believe that if a group is attacked, it should take on
the burden of justifying its actions to students and not ex
pect the ASSU to come to its defense. If a group cannot
defend itself without the help of the ASSU, perhaps it has
more problems than just bad press.
Or if the attacks are misleading enough, the student
group might consider taking the individual or group re
sponsible to court and sue for libel.
The proper role of student government is not to tell its
constituents what to think or how to vote. Likewise, it is
not the ASSU's job to try to convince students to vote for
certain organizations, even if it believes those organiza
tions are being unfairly attacked.
Instead of passing a bill that will in practice achieve lit
tle. the ASSU should leave it up to student groups to de
fend themselves.
