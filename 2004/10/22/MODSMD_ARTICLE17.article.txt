## Coming Out Day is not just for queers 
### 
By HUNTER MARGRAVES
Today, Stanford celebrates Na
tional Coming Out Day, and like any
other day. many students on campus
just won't notice. And why should
they?
It seems like everyone is coming
out these days: governors, pop icons
— hell,even Cynthia Nixon (Miran
da on "Sex and the City") recently
admitted to being in a seven-month
relationship with another woman.
No wonder she had problems find
ing Mr. Right.
With images of lesbian, gay. bi
sexual. transgendered (LGBT) peo
ple rampant in film, television,
newspapers and magazines, 1 can't
help but wonder if National Coming
Out Day has any relevance in the
American society of today, particu
larly in the Bay Area, where every
one is either queer or dresses like
they are.
One could even speculate that re
cent battles over gay marriage,
adoption and "don't ask. don't tell"
represent the near-assimilation of
queers into mainstream America.
Since all queers want to get married,
move to the burbs and have 2.5 chil
dren (artificially inseminated, of
course), what's the point in coming
out? Will anyone care? Will anyone
notice?
Don't get me wrong: In the eyes
of the law. no group of people
should have more rights than others,
regardless of what social category
they fall into. But coming out — the
risks, responsibilities and challenges
— still exists.

I remember coming out to my
parents a little over three years ago.
Most of my friends already knew; I
figured that I might as well not hide
from the fact that 1 was dating a guy
or getting involved in queer activism
and volunteerism.
The response was probably typi
cal. My mom cried and asked if this
was "just a phase," like I had a bad
fauxhawk or something. My dad
didn't talk to me fora week — I
couldn't decide whether he was
angry, blaming himself or some
weird combination of the two.
And if there is to be a silver lining
in this coming out cloud, it's that
these recent normalization battles
have given my parents hope that I
too will one day get married in a
church and then raise a family just
like my next-door neighbor.
Coming out should never be as
traumatic or as emotional of a pro
cess as it was for me. But then again,
coming out is different for everyone,
and nobody even has to come out as
gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgen
dered or queer.
Straight folk can come out as al
lies to the queer couple that dances
together at a straight party or club,
drawing stares and glares from oth
ers. Teachers can come out as allies
to the questioning kid in junior high
who walks from class to class
steeped in fear.
And we all can come out as allies
to transgendered individuals who
risk their lives every time they put
on a dress or take hormones. We can
all come out as citizens against acts
of horrific violence such as the mur

der of Gwen Araujo, a Bay Area
transgcndered teen brutally beaten
and buried by three men who found
out that the "she" was a"he."
Because no matter how high the
ratings are for Showtime's "The L-
Word" or how many metrosexuals
look to gay men for fashion and
grooming tips, the fact remains that
we live in a heteronormative world,
where boys ask girls out on dates
and get married in churches and
have families and live the American
dream.
And there's nothing wrong with
that. Everyone should have the right
to do those things. Just as everyone
should have the right to fight such
institutions of oppressive heterosex
uality by not participating in them or
by expressing their sexual identity as
they see fit.
How your identity aligns with the
mainstream isn't the issue. Being
able to express yourself with the
support of loved ones, family and
friends is. Coming out, be it for
straights or for queers, is the basic
articulation of who you are — your
very essence — plain and simple.
And no matter how many other peo
ple are doing it, it's still a cause for
celebration.

show up at White Plaza at noon for

Today, Stanford celebrates Na
tional Coming Out Day, and like any
other day. many students on campus
just won't notice. And why should
they?
It seems like everyone is coming
out these days: governors, pop icons
— hell,even Cynthia Nixon (Miran
da on "Sex and the City") recently
admitted to being in a seven-month
relationship with another woman.
No wonder she had problems find
ing Mr. Right.
With images of lesbian, gay. bi
sexual. transgendered (LGBT) peo
ple rampant in film, television,
newspapers and magazines, 1 can't
help but wonder if National Coming
Out Day has any relevance in the
American society of today, particu
larly in the Bay Area, where every
one is either queer or dresses like
they are.
One could even speculate that re
cent battles over gay marriage,
adoption and "don't ask. don't tell"
represent the near-assimilation of
queers into mainstream America.
Since all queers want to get married,
move to the burbs and have 2.5 chil
dren (artificially inseminated, of
course), what's the point in coming
out? Will anyone care? Will anyone
notice?
Don't get me wrong: In the eyes
of the law. no group of people
should have more rights than others,
regardless of what social category
they fall into. But coming out — the
risks, responsibilities and challenges
— still exists.

I remember coming out to my
parents a little over three years ago.
Most of my friends already knew; I
figured that I might as well not hide
from the fact that 1 was dating a guy
or getting involved in queer activism
and volunteerism.
The response was probably typi
cal. My mom cried and asked if this
was "just a phase," like I had a bad
fauxhawk or something. My dad
didn't talk to me fora week — I
couldn't decide whether he was
angry, blaming himself or some
weird combination of the two.
And if there is to be a silver lining
in this coming out cloud, it's that
these recent normalization battles
have given my parents hope that I
too will one day get married in a
church and then raise a family just
like my next-door neighbor.
Coming out should never be as
traumatic or as emotional of a pro
cess as it was for me. But then again,
coming out is different for everyone,
and nobody even has to come out as
gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgen
dered or queer.
Straight folk can come out as al
lies to the queer couple that dances
together at a straight party or club,
drawing stares and glares from oth
ers. Teachers can come out as allies
to the questioning kid in junior high
who walks from class to class
steeped in fear.
And we all can come out as allies
to transgendered individuals who
risk their lives every time they put
on a dress or take hormones. We can
all come out as citizens against acts
of horrific violence such as the mur

der of Gwen Araujo, a Bay Area
transgcndered teen brutally beaten
and buried by three men who found
out that the "she" was a"he."
Because no matter how high the
ratings are for Showtime's "The L-
Word" or how many metrosexuals
look to gay men for fashion and
grooming tips, the fact remains that
we live in a heteronormative world,
where boys ask girls out on dates
and get married in churches and
have families and live the American
dream.
And there's nothing wrong with
that. Everyone should have the right
to do those things. Just as everyone
should have the right to fight such
institutions of oppressive heterosex
uality by not participating in them or
by expressing their sexual identity as
they see fit.
How your identity aligns with the
mainstream isn't the issue. Being
able to express yourself with the
support of loved ones, family and
friends is. Coming out, be it for
straights or for queers, is the basic
articulation of who you are — your
very essence — plain and simple.
And no matter how many other peo
ple are doing it, it's still a cause for
celebration.
