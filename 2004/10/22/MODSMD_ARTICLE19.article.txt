# Irrational Exuberance
## My selfish altruism 
### 
Economists tend to believe
that everyone's decisions
are constantly governed by
rational self-interest. Even
modern economic notions of altru
ism involve tacit implications of re
ciprocity.
While even 1 often pooh-pooh
many of these models, never has the
model of selfish altruism been more
apparent than several examples from
my own life this past winter.
Last winter. 1 found myself orga
nizing my department's ski trip.
When the president of the depart
ment student association was solicit
ing volunteers to organize the trip, no
one volunteered — myself included
— knowing how much it would suck.
It was eventually pawned off on this
first-year girl who, having never skied
or been toTahoe, had no idea what she
was in for. So of course, as she was lost,
I offered to help and wound up doing
most of the organizing, getting housing,
organizing lift tickets.
It was mostly a living hell, with
people arbitrarily canceling, me
putting up $3.(XX) of my own money
hoping to get it back, getting enough
people for the group rate, getting ev
eryone there at the same time, mak
ing sure everyone had someone to ski
with and everyone was only billed
what they thought was fair, making
sure everyone had fun, and dealing
with one daredevil who broke his
back (he'll be okay, fortunately).
Never was I so relieved when we
checked out of the hotel Sunday morn
ing. But I couldn't say I'll never do it
again, because probably, next year,
having done it already. I'll be the one
best qualified, and thus it would cost
me the least to plan the trip.
In the interest of maximizing so
cial welfare. I should be the one to do
it. Stupid altruism.
But not pure altruism. For I cease
lessly complained. Cheerily but in
cessantly. To anyone willing to hear
it.
1 complained until everyone felt
so guilty they thanked me every
chance they could get. And that was
good. 'Cause deep down, I need peo
ple to like me.
The other recent event in my life
was more serious still. Four years ago,
I walked into a campus bone marrow
typing drive, mostly because a pretty
girl asked me to. not really thinking of
the consequences. The chance of a
match is less than one in 1(),(XK).
something inconceivable to human
calculations.
Then, several months ago, my
grandmother and my mother got a
FedEx letter for me. The medical
center was desperately searching for

me because a possible match had
been found.
The prospect of general anesthe
sia and major surgery loomed over
me — even the possibility of death.
My mother urged me to ignore it, as
did many of my closest friends. I was
sorely tempted to do just that. It's not

that I wanted the
poor patient to
die, it was just that
I was hoping to
free ride on the
hope they found
somebody else.
Yet. many people
who I wasn't as
close to were en
thusiastic about
the match.

They were fulfilling their duty in
providing the appropriate collective
social approbation / disapprobation
to solve the collective action prob
lem. the prisoner's dilemma of daily
life. This culminated in an A3C din
ner where, coincidentally, they were
encouraging people to donate sam
ples for the bone marrow database to
encourage others to take that fateful
step I blindly took four years ago.
I stood up and announced that 1
was a match to warn others that the
one in 10,000 chance was real, to
make them face the cold hard possi
bility that step could bring or perhaps
because I knew I would get the round
of applause that subsequently fol
lowed. I felt dirty.
A few days after the dinner, 1 did
actually go in and supply an addition
al partial unit of blood to confirm the
match. Several weeks later, I received
a letter. It informed me that 1 was in
deed a match for the patient but that
they had someone who matched
closely. I was off the hook.
In one late-night conversation
with my best friend from high school,
he professed a deep admiration of
Harry S. Truman, who spent his en
tire life after his presidency perform
ing anonymous acts of altruism. I ar
gued that anonymity was a useless
conceit. If public altruism made you
feel better and thus led to more altru
istic behavior, then surely it is socially
preferred to the anonymous variety.
He argued that there was another or
thogonal dimension that economic
value could not capture.
I. however, am still not sure on
which side I stand.

Economists tend to believe
that everyone's decisions
are constantly governed by
rational self-interest. Even
modern economic notions of altru
ism involve tacit implications of re
ciprocity.
While even 1 often pooh-pooh
many of these models, never has the
model of selfish altruism been more
apparent than several examples from
my own life this past winter.
Last winter. 1 found myself orga
nizing my department's ski trip.
When the president of the depart
ment student association was solicit
ing volunteers to organize the trip, no
one volunteered — myself included
— knowing how much it would suck.
It was eventually pawned off on this
first-year girl who, having never skied
or been toTahoe, had no idea what she
was in for. So of course, as she was lost,
I offered to help and wound up doing
most of the organizing, getting housing,
organizing lift tickets.
It was mostly a living hell, with
people arbitrarily canceling, me
putting up $3.(XX) of my own money
hoping to get it back, getting enough
people for the group rate, getting ev
eryone there at the same time, mak
ing sure everyone had someone to ski
with and everyone was only billed
what they thought was fair, making
sure everyone had fun, and dealing
with one daredevil who broke his
back (he'll be okay, fortunately).
Never was I so relieved when we
checked out of the hotel Sunday morn
ing. But I couldn't say I'll never do it
again, because probably, next year,
having done it already. I'll be the one
best qualified, and thus it would cost
me the least to plan the trip.
In the interest of maximizing so
cial welfare. I should be the one to do
it. Stupid altruism.
But not pure altruism. For I cease
lessly complained. Cheerily but in
cessantly. To anyone willing to hear
it.
1 complained until everyone felt
so guilty they thanked me every
chance they could get. And that was
good. 'Cause deep down, I need peo
ple to like me.
The other recent event in my life
was more serious still. Four years ago,
I walked into a campus bone marrow
typing drive, mostly because a pretty
girl asked me to. not really thinking of
the consequences. The chance of a
match is less than one in 1(),(XK).
