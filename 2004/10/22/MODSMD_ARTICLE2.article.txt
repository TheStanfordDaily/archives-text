# Clemens leads Oregon's high-octane offense into Stanford
## 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Football in the Pacific-10 Conference has long had
the reputation of being especially offensive-minded,
with strong emphasis on spreading the field and pick
ing up huge chunks of yardage through the air. This
season is no exception, as six Pac-10 teams currently
rank among the top 25 passing offenses in the nation.
Oregon, which looks to spoil the Cardinal's
Homecoming tomorrow, has exemplified the wide
open attack so commonly associated with West Coast
football, racking up 279.3 passing yards per game,
14th-best among Division I teams. The Ducks rank
second in the Pac-10 in total offense, behind only No.
7 California.
Quarterback Kellen Clemens is the maestro of
head coach Mike Belotti's high-octane offense,
which has scored 69 points and totaled 1,138 yards in
its last two games. The junior out of Burns, Ore., is
one of the most efficient passers in the conference
this season, having thrown for 1,603 yards and 12
touchdowns while misfiring for only three intercep
tions.
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens is well aware
of the potency of the Ducks' attack.
"They spread the ball around in innovative ways
with shuffle passes and other things to keep you off
balance," Teevens said. "Offensively, they continue
to get better week after week."

Five Oregon receivers have at least 12 catches and
a touchdown to their credit this season.
Clemens' ability to hurt the opposition with his
legs—he has three rushing touchdowns — helps
keep opposing defenses in check.
"Clemens has mobility, and if you cover people,
he's not afraid to tuck it and run," Teevens said.
"That can hurt you athletically. They also protect him
quite well, so it'll be quite a challenge. They're a
formidable offensive group, and have been for years,
especially with the way Clemens has played the past
few games. We'll have our hands full."
The quick-strike ability of the Oregon offense
means the Ducks are never out of a game, as they
demonstrated in a 41-38 comeback victory over
Washington State two weeks ago. Clemens account
ed for six touchdowns, including all three of his rush
ing touchdowns this season, and passed for 437 yards.
The Ducks racked up 646 total yards on offense. 393
of those coming in the second half.
Washington State led 38-34 with the ball and 5:30
remaining in the game, but Oregon drove 60 yards in
the final 3:25 for the decisive score.
Clemens is far from the Ducks' greatest running
threat. Junior running back Terrence Whitehead is
third in the Pac-10 with 94.3 rushing yards per game
and has tallied four touchdowns on the ground, plus
two more as a receiver. Two of his biggest games of
