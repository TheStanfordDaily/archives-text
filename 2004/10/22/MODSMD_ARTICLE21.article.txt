University shows no intention of
reforming labor policies
Wednesday night's town hall
meeting on labor issues was an insult
to workers, students, and the entire
Stanford community.
The town hall meeting was sup
posed to be a forum for discussion of
the recommendations released by
University President Hennessy's
Advisory Committee on Workplace
Policies, created at the conclusion of
a weeklong student fast over a year
ago.
If the administration truly want
ed the input of workers, why was the
meeting held at night, when most
workers are home with their fami

lies? And why was there no Spanish
translator to ensure that our large
immigrant workforce was included
in (he dialogue?
If the administration truly want
ed the input of students, why were
the student groups that ct>ordinated
the hunger strike, without which the
Committee would not even exist, not
directly informed of the event?
Finally, where was President
Hcnnessy? He is the one who ap
pointed this committee, and he is
the one who ultimately makes deci
sions that affect the lives of thou
sands of workers. His absence
spoke loudest of all on Wednesday
night, and the message was clear:
Despite the hopes and efforts of

committee members and of the
broader community, the administra
tion has no intention of accepting le
gitimate criticism and reforming its
labor practices.

Not all Jews agree with Jewish
Leadership Council's position
1 am writing to support The
Daily's effort to offer a balanced
view in yesterday's article on Hedy
Epstein's talk ("Tensions Boil as
Holocaust Survivor Decries Treat
ment of Palestinians," Oct. 21). al
though there are still troubling as

peels to the article.
When The Daily reports that the
flier for the talk "appalled members
of Stanford's Jewish community," it
should have been qualified by "some
members." Not all Jews at Stanford
agree with the Jewish Leadership
Council's position on the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict or their response
to this event.
Rhetoric about the conflict has al
ways been difficult and painful, but
certain aspects should be clearer by
now. Almost my entire family was
murdered in Majdanek and Treblin
ka concentration camps, and I would
not equate the violence in the Middle
East to the slaughter of the Nazis.
However, that does not absolve

the Israeli government of its brutal
treatment of the Palestinians. I am
constantly saddened and angered by
the actions of the Israeli govern
ment, its continuation of the occupa
tion and its state violence directed
toward Palestinians.
This is a conflict with blood on ev
eryone's hands, but I feel a particu
lar responsibility to speak out about
Israel's violation of human rights
precisely because of what happened
to my family, precisely because of
my sense of prophetic Judaism and
Jewish ethics.
It is completely legitimate to
make the association and to bemoan
how victims in turn have become vic
timizers: I have met other Holocaust

survivors who feel the same way as
Hedy Epstein.
It should be clear by now that
there is no monolithic Jewish opin
ion. Groups like the Stanford Israel
Alliance project a particular political
stance, not one representative of all
Jews, either politically or religiously.
When mainstream rabbis in Is
rael call for Israeli troops to refuse
orders to remove settlers from Gaza,
when commentators openly speak of
assassination threats against Prime
Minister Sharon, it should be more
evident than ever before that all
Jews do not agree.
