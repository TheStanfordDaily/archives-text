## Epstein lecture: a vision for peace 
### RANIA ELTOM TANYA HAJ-HASSAN 
On behalf of the Muslim Student
Awareness Network and the Coali
tion for Justice in the Middle East,
we would like to sincerely thank ev
eryone who attended Wednesday
night's event with Hedy Epstein. In
lieu of the unacceptable and unwar
ranted outbursts, we would like to
especially thank our audience for
tolerating such absurd conduct, al
though no one should have to wit
ness such behavior.
For that we do apologize, and we
hope that in the future attendees of
campus events will have a strong
sense of integrity, control and respect
for themselves and their peers.
We would also like to thank the
respectable audience members who
addressed us in an appropriate man

ner with questions and concerns —
such feedback and dialogue increas
es our awareness of community con
cerns, and we thank you for your
commentary.
We'd also like to note that the
University prides itself on the
breadth of diversity the student body
brings to the community and strong
ly supports students voicing their
concerns and opinions on domestic
and global matters. The visions up
held by both organizations reflect
peace, awareness and tolerance.
The Muslim Student Awareness
Network and the Coalition for Jus
tice in the Middle East condemn dis
crimination in any form, as do we
strongly condemn violence and ter
rorism. Furthermore, we find it ex
tremely offensive that our viewpoint
has been questioned in that regard.
Our first event of the year.

"Jerusalem Women Speak," brought
together a Christian Palestinian, a
Jewish Israeli and a Muslim Pales
tinian to share their common vision
for peace. This event serves as a testi
mony to our commitment to peace
and justice in the Palestinian / Israeli
conflict.
We believe that peace will only
be possible when the rights of all
people in the region are recognized
and respected.
We re-emphasize that our vision
for peace in Israel and Palestine must
be upheld here on campus if it is to
become a reality in the Middle East.

lim Student Awareness Network.
