## Epstein lecture: an abuse of history 
### ADINA DANZIG 
Unfortunately, Wednesday
night's lecture with Hedy Epstein,
''Surviving the Holocaust: Witness
ing History Repeated," represented
a spiraling downward of the quality
of intellectual discourse that usually
characterizes Stanford.
While the organizers attempted
in the verbal introduction to disclaim
the title and fliers for the event —
which disturbingly equate the Holo
caust with the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict — that disclaimer did not
undo the damage.
Undoubtedly, the organizers of
the event from Muslim Students
Awareness Network and the Coali
tion for Justice in the Middle East
were well aware of the offensive and
inaccurate statement they were
making by widely distributing fliers
that link Israeli soldiers to Nazis in
words and in image. These flyers
have circulated to many more indi
viduals than those who were present
to hear the disclaimer.
In addition, while Epstein stated

generally that she does "not com
pare situations" because every situa
tion is different, during her lecture
she made several remarks drawing
the parallel. Moreover, those who
created the publicity for the event
abused the name of a prominent na
tional Holocaust museum by linking
the museum name to the event, os
tensibly to lend credibility to Ep
stein's views.
This violated the directives of the
museum, as the current and former
directors have explicitly stated that
they do not agree with Epstein's
views on Israel, have described her
statements on the Middle East as
"counter-factual" and have asked
that the museum name not be used
with any publicity regarding Ep
stein's lectures on Israel-related
topics.
It is an abuse of history and a dis
grace to the memory of millions
murdered by the Nazis to draw any
parallel between the painful and
complex political conflict between
the Israelis and Palestinians, both of
whom are suffering casualties, and

the calculated genocide perpetrated
by the Nazis.
Campus programs which seek to
equate, in any manner, the Holo
caust and the current Israel-Pales
tinian conflict are bound to create
emotional reactions that detract
from the importance of students
being exposed to the different
points of view regarding the current
situation.
Hillel fully supports the contin
ued existence of Israel as a free and
democratic Jewish state and also un
derstands the value of legitimate ed
ucation and debate regarding the
conflict. I hope this event and the
isolated interruptions by a few indi
viduals were an aberration, and that
the Stanford community will return
to quality and civil discourse on this
difficult topic through respectful dia
logue as well as educational pro
grams of intellectual and historical
integrity.
