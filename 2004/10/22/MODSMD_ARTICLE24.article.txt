## Men start four-game road trip 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
At the midway point of the,season. the
Stanford men's water polo team appears
headed down the right path toward the
NC AAs once again. As the No. 2 Cardinal
(13-2, 2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) get set to build on the second-best
record in the nation, it's time to look back
on the good and the not-so-good of the first
half.
Good: Offensive power.
Stanford leads the league in scoring with
12.67 goals per game. Junior Thomas Hop
kins and senior Tony A/evedo sit two and
three in the MPSF individual scoring board,
with 39 and 34 goals, respectively. Azevedo
and Hopkins are Hanked on the opposite
side by junior Peter Varellas, giving the Car
dinal's opponents strong threats from the
right and left.
Good: Playing as a team.
Varellas, coming off a weekend where
he scored five goals, is one of many Cardinal
players enjoying a successful season. He at
tributes his performance to his teammates.
"I've got great players around me."
Varellas said. "[Tony and Thomas] both
make incredible passes that don't leave
much up to me besides scoring the ball, and
that really opens up our offense ... So
much of the defenses attention goes to those
two players that it really allows me to step
up in some spots and get some good looks at
the ball."
Not-so-good: Defense.
According to senior Sam Tyre, there's
room for improvement.
"In the past years when we've won. (de
fense] has been a staple of our game." said
Tyre, who's been to three national champi
onships in his Stanford career. "We have to
make it a staple of our game this year as
well. We have to go out of our way to play
good defense."
While the Cardinal will focus on improv
ing their defense in future games, that focus
doesn't detract from the nice work the Stan
ford defense has done thus far. Goalkeeper
Chad Taylor remains atop the MPSF in
fewest goals allowed, with only a 4.93 goals
against average. And the Stanford defense
can definitely be credited for securing a win
against Irvine last Saturday.

"This past weekend we made a huge
step, holding [Irvine] at one point to 8-0,"
Tyre said. "If we can come out again with
that type of intensity on the defensive side
of the pool then we're only going to im
prove. We have tons of firepower. It's the
defense that's preventing us from having a
better record right now."
As for Varellas, who has 33 coals this

year, a strong defensive showing on his he
half has been on his mind since the offsea
son.
"I think that defense has been my focus
on the year so far." Varellas said. "It's
come a long way from a year ago at this
time; Last year I was getting a lot of ejec
tions. It's really been a focus to stay away
from those, so that I could stay in the game

and keep the ball on the offensive attack."
Looking ahead to the second half of the
season, the Cardinal can take solace in the
fact I hat their next tournament won't come
until the MPSF tournament at the end of
the regular season.
