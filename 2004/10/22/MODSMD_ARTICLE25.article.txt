# Card face No. 1 Huskies
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Having breezed through the past two weekends
of Pacific-10 conference play, the No. 11 Stanford
women's volleyball team will face its stiffest test of
the season this weekend against an old nemesis from
the Pacific Northwest.
Should the Cardinal (14-4.6-1) survive Washing
ton State (3-17. 0-7) on Friday night—could you
blame Stanford for overlooking the Cougars? —
John Dunning's team will storm into Seattle on Sun
day fora shot at No. 1 and undefeated Washington
(15-0. 7-0). Of course, that's assuming the Huskies
can withstand California's upset bid.
If their recent play is any indication — the
Huskies have swept their opponents in three out of
the last four matches — there's no reason to believe
Washington won't be undefeated come Sunday,
which .would set the stage fora showdown for first
place in the Pac-10.
But for Stanford, fresh off a pair of wins over the
Oregon schools at home that extended its winning
streak to four, Sunday's match is more than a poten
tial ticket to the top spot in the Pac-10. It's also a
chance to avenge a painful 3-1 loss to the Huskies in
the first round of the NCAA Tournament last De
cember. Washington also got the best of the Cardinal
in a 3-1 win at Seattle during the regular season.
With senior outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani and
sophomore Kristin Richards leading the charge, the
story could be different this year. Nnamani sur
passed the 2,(XX) career kill mark last week and had

20 kills in the Cardinal's season-ending loss to the
Huskies last year. She is averaging 5.7 kills per game
in her senior campaign.
Richards, second on the team with 3.86 kills per
game, is hitting on all cylinders. The Orem, Utah, na
tive recorded three double-doubles last week, in
cluding 17 kills and 14 digs in Stanford's sweep of
Oregon. Her 12 double-doubles this season lead the
team.
Against Washington, Stanford must contend with
Pac-10 Freshman of the Week Christal Morrison.
The outside hitter recorded 38 kills and 27 digs in
Washington's wins over the Arizona schools last
weekend. She's elevated her game with senior Sonja
Tomasevic out of the lineup. Tomasevic had surgery
to repair a fractured hand she suffered in practice on
Oct. 14.
Washington sophomore setter Courtney Thomp
son leads the Pac-10 with 14.27 assists per game and
the Huskies as a team lead the conference in every
statistical category except service aces and blocks.
As tempting as it might be, the Cardinal won't ac
tually overlook the Cougars, who took Stanford to
five games in Pullman last season. Washington State
is still looking for its first conference win in head
coach Brian Heffernan's first year at the helm.
Kelly Rosin and Jennifer Todd lead the Cougars'
attack with 3.88 and 3.75 kills per game, respectively.
Stanford has won 34 of the 37 all-time matches
against Washington State and is 37-4 all-time against
Washington.
Friday and Sunday's matches are scheduled to
begin at 7 p.m.
