# Women's crew heads east for Head of the Charles
## 
### WES MATEO 
This weekend, on a river running
through the birthplace of the American
Revolution and at a regatta perhaps
equally steeped in tradition, the Stanford
women's Varsity and lightweight crew
teams open their fall seasons. Competing
in the world-famous Head of the Charles
Regatta on Boston's Charles River, both
teams will enter an eight-seat boat into
their respective events Sunday afternoon.
With boats defined by experience and
young talent, both teams look to begin
their years by building on last year's
achievements.
At the Head of the Charles Regatta,
events arc conducted as "head" races.
Under this race format, boats cross the
start line at approximately 10-second in

tervals, ensuring spacing between crews
at the outset of the race. Once on the
course, however, boats are free to pass
and maneuver for position, in order to
complete the course in the fastest possible
time. Thus it is not a boat's finishing posi
tion that is significant, but its course time.
After a 10th place finish at last year's
Head of the Charles, the Stanford
women's eight will start this year's
Women's Championship Eight event in
the 10th position, one spot ahead of rival
Virginia's boat and one behind Michigan.
But in addition to collegiate competition,
the Women's team will be facing several
international boats, including those of
both the Canadian and U.S. national
teams. Starting 10th out of 42 entries.
