# Women's crew heads east for Head of the Charles
## 
### WES MATEO 
This weekend, on a river running
through the birthplace of the American
Revolution and at a regatta perhaps
equally steeped in tradition, the Stanford
women's Varsity and lightweight crew
teams open their fall seasons. Competing
in the world-famous Head of the Charles
Regatta on Boston's Charles River, both
teams will enter an eight-seat boat into
their respective events Sunday afternoon.
With boats defined by experience and
young talent, both teams look to begin
their years by building on last year's
achievements.
At the Head of the Charles Regatta,
events arc conducted as "head" races.
Under this race format, boats cross the
start line at approximately 10-second in

tervals, ensuring spacing between crews
at the outset of the race. Once on the
course, however, boats are free to pass
and maneuver for position, in order to
complete the course in the fastest possible
time. Thus it is not a boat's finishing posi
tion that is significant, but its course time.
After a 10th place finish at last year's
Head of the Charles, the Stanford
women's eight will start this year's
Women's Championship Eight event in
the 10th position, one spot ahead of rival
Virginia's boat and one behind Michigan.
But in addition to collegiate competition,
the Women's team will be facing several
international boats, including those of
both the Canadian and U.S. national
teams. Starting 10th out of 42 entries.
Women's varsity eight
will open in 10th spot

though, works to the advantage of
the Women's Eight.
"There are less problems start
ing high up." explains women's
head coach Aimee Baker.
Fewer hoats in front of one's boat
means less potential congestion, a
factor favorable to the women's
chances of posting a fast time.
The course itself doesn't make
things any easier. Starting just be
fore the Boston University Bridge,
the course winds its way up the
Charles River, ultimately passing
beneath six bridges and turning five
times before its finish. The twisty
nature of the course, combined with
the incredible number of spectators
lining the river's shores and bridges,
makes the race "a cox's nightmare,"
according to Baker.
Understandably then, while
trying to finish as high as possible,
the women's first priority will be
to hold the 10th spot.
But steered by senior coxswain
and captain Kelly Garneski, the
women's boat will be in good hands.
Although this is Garneski's first
year coxing the first varsity eight,
her coach attests to her capability.
"We had a couple of excellent
coxes last year, so even though this
is her first time coxing the first

eight, she's been ready all along,"
Baker said.
Stroking the women's boat will
be senior captain Missy Fiesler,
who is joined by seasoned veterans
Alexis Peterson and Abby
Loughrey in the five and six seats,
respectively.
Freshman Kerry Birk adds her
experience as a member of the ju
nior national team to the boat and
will sit in the two seat. Rounding
out the women's boat are sopho
mores Liz Harrison (three seat).
Carly York (four seat). Stephanie
Connolly (seven seat) and senior
Margit Zwemer in the bow.
Despite the fact that junior Sam
McGee, who took last year off from
Stanford to train with the U.S. na
tional team, will row for the U.S.
national boat this weekend, the
members of the women's boat offer
ample reason lor optimism going to
Boston this weekend.
The women's lightweight team
will be making only its second-ever
appearance at the Head of the
Charles. Now in its fourth year of
existence, the women's lightweight
team will be entering its "most ex
perienced and most talented eight
ever," according to head coach Al
Acosta.

Featuring a boat composed of
four seniors, one sophomore and
three freshmen and coxed by
sophomore Elise Menke, the team
stands poised to improve on last
year's seventh-place finish (fifth
out of collegiate entries).
Acosta expressed a sentiment
toward the Head of the Charles'
course similar to Baker's.
"It's so windy, you can't really
prepare for it outside of actually
rowing on [it]," he said.
Nevertheless, the dominating
senior presence in the boat, provid
ed by tri-captains C'ady Kintner,
kristina Peterson and Michelle
Ramirez in the six. four and bow
seats, respectively, and by Kale
Vieh in the five seat, combined with
the talent and experience of the
boat's four underclassmen —
sophomore Meredith Coleman and
freshmen Ariane Thompson,
Olivia Prevost and Kate Hayes —
bodes well for the team's perfor
mance this weekend, and for the
rest of the year.
The Women's Lightweight
Eight event begins at 2:21 p.m. Sun
day afternoon and the Women's
Championship Eight begins at 3:25
p.m. the same afternoon.

Virginia's boat and one behind Michigan.
But in addition to collegiate competition,
the Women's team will be facing several
international boats, including those of
both the Canadian and U.S. national
teams. Starting 10th out of 42 entries.
Women's varsity eight
will open in 10th spot

though, works to the advantage of
the Women's Eight.
"There are less problems start
ing high up." explains women's
head coach Aimee Baker.
Fewer hoats in front of one's boat
means less potential congestion, a
factor favorable to the women's
chances of posting a fast time.
The course itself doesn't make
things any easier. Starting just be
fore the Boston University Bridge,
the course winds its way up the
Charles River, ultimately passing
beneath six bridges and turning five
times before its finish. The twisty
nature of the course, combined with
the incredible number of spectators
lining the river's shores and bridges,
makes the race "a cox's nightmare,"
according to Baker.
Understandably then, while
trying to finish as high as possible,
the women's first priority will be
to hold the 10th spot.
But steered by senior coxswain
and captain Kelly Garneski, the
women's boat will be in good hands.
Although this is Garneski's first
year coxing the first varsity eight,
her coach attests to her capability.
"We had a couple of excellent
coxes last year, so even though this
is her first time coxing the first

eight, she's been ready all along,"
Baker said.
Stroking the women's boat will
be senior captain Missy Fiesler,
who is joined by seasoned veterans
Alexis Peterson and Abby
Loughrey in the five and six seats,
respectively.
Freshman Kerry Birk adds her
experience as a member of the ju
nior national team to the boat and
will sit in the two seat. Rounding
out the women's boat are sopho
mores Liz Harrison (three seat).
Carly York (four seat). Stephanie
Connolly (seven seat) and senior
Margit Zwemer in the bow.
Despite the fact that junior Sam
McGee, who took last year off from
Stanford to train with the U.S. na
tional team, will row for the U.S.
national boat this weekend, the
members of the women's boat offer
ample reason lor optimism going to
Boston this weekend.
The women's lightweight team
will be making only its second-ever
appearance at the Head of the
Charles. Now in its fourth year of
existence, the women's lightweight
team will be entering its "most ex
perienced and most talented eight
ever," according to head coach Al
Acosta.

Featuring a boat composed of
four seniors, one sophomore and
three freshmen and coxed by
sophomore Elise Menke, the team
stands poised to improve on last
year's seventh-place finish (fifth
out of collegiate entries).
Acosta expressed a sentiment
toward the Head of the Charles'
course similar to Baker's.
"It's so windy, you can't really
prepare for it outside of actually
rowing on [it]," he said.
Nevertheless, the dominating
senior presence in the boat, provid
ed by tri-captains C'ady Kintner,
kristina Peterson and Michelle
Ramirez in the six. four and bow
seats, respectively, and by Kale
Vieh in the five seat, combined with
the talent and experience of the
boat's four underclassmen —
sophomore Meredith Coleman and
freshmen Ariane Thompson,
Olivia Prevost and Kate Hayes —
bodes well for the team's perfor
mance this weekend, and for the
rest of the year.
The Women's Lightweight
Eight event begins at 2:21 p.m. Sun
day afternoon and the Women's
Championship Eight begins at 3:25
p.m. the same afternoon.
This weekend, on a river running
through the birthplace of the American
Revolution and at a regatta perhaps
equally steeped in tradition, the Stanford
women's Varsity and lightweight crew
teams open their fall seasons. Competing
in the world-famous Head of the Charles
Regatta on Boston's Charles River, both
teams will enter an eight-seat boat into
their respective events Sunday afternoon.
With boats defined by experience and
young talent, both teams look to begin
their years by building on last year's
achievements.
At the Head of the Charles Regatta,
events arc conducted as "head" races.
Under this race format, boats cross the
start line at approximately 10-second in

tervals, ensuring spacing between crews
at the outset of the race. Once on the
course, however, boats are free to pass
and maneuver for position, in order to
complete the course in the fastest possible
time. Thus it is not a boat's finishing posi
tion that is significant, but its course time.
After a 10th place finish at last year's
Head of the Charles, the Stanford
women's eight will start this year's
Women's Championship Eight event in
the 10th position, one spot ahead of rival
Virginia's boat and one behind Michigan.
