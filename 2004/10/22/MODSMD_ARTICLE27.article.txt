A chance for retribution can never come
soon enough, but thankfully for the Stanford
men's soccer team, it won't take long this
time. Five days after the Cardinal (6-2-5, 1-
1 -2 Pacific-10 Conference) dropped a 2-0 de
cision to UCLA (7-2-2.3-1-0) at home. Stan
ford gets its shot at revenge tonight at 6 p.m.
in Los Angeles.
One advantage for the Cardinal as they
prepare to face the Bruins is that Sunday's
loss is still fresh in their minds.
"The quick turnaround definitely helps
us because our team still has a bad taste in
our mouth from last Sunday." said junior
midfielder Cooper McKce. "Our guys can't
wait to get out. play and get rid of the bad
taste."
Stanford head coach Bret Simon saw a

promising intensity in practice.
"Our guys seemed very lively and upbeat
this week." Simon said. "One thing I can say
is it offers a great opportunity."
Capitalizing on this chance will he an up
hill climb. First, there's the history. The last
Stanford win against UCLA came during
the 200() regular season. The Bruins have
dominated the overall series with a 24-3-2
all-time record against the Cardinal, includ
ing six straight wins.
Secondly, this is no slouch of a Bruins
team.
"After reviewing the tape all week, I
thought we played well," Simon said. "How
ever, I think UCLA played very well. In fact,
it was one of the best UCLA performances
I've seen in years."
