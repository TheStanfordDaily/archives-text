# Loss still fresh as Cardinal prepare for UCLA rematch
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW 
A chance for retribution can never come
soon enough, but thankfully for the Stanford
men's soccer team, it won't take long this
time. Five days after the Cardinal (6-2-5, 1-
1 -2 Pacific-10 Conference) dropped a 2-0 de
cision to UCLA (7-2-2.3-1-0) at home. Stan
ford gets its shot at revenge tonight at 6 p.m.
in Los Angeles.
One advantage for the Cardinal as they
prepare to face the Bruins is that Sunday's
loss is still fresh in their minds.
"The quick turnaround definitely helps
us because our team still has a bad taste in
our mouth from last Sunday." said junior
midfielder Cooper McKce. "Our guys can't
wait to get out. play and get rid of the bad
taste."
Stanford head coach Bret Simon saw a

promising intensity in practice.
"Our guys seemed very lively and upbeat
this week." Simon said. "One thing I can say
is it offers a great opportunity."
Capitalizing on this chance will he an up
hill climb. First, there's the history. The last
Stanford win against UCLA came during
the 200() regular season. The Bruins have
dominated the overall series with a 24-3-2
all-time record against the Cardinal, includ
ing six straight wins.
Secondly, this is no slouch of a Bruins
team.
"After reviewing the tape all week, I
thought we played well," Simon said. "How
ever, I think UCLA played very well. In fact,
it was one of the best UCLA performances
I've seen in years."
The third roadblock in Stanford's way is


LINDSAY COIEMAN/The Stanford Daily File
The men's soccer team looks to avenge
last week's loss to UCLA tonight.
Rain limits field time

that the team must travel and play
away from Maloney Field. But is
that really a disadvantage for this
year's team? The Cardinal's
home record is 1-2-3, while
they've gone 5-0-2 away from
Maloney Field (3-0-1 at non-neu
tral away sites).
"It [home field advantage| has
been kind of strange for us this
year," Simon said. "Teams usually
play much better at home, but
we've had almost the opposite re
sult with a very good record on the
road and an average record here at
home."
Regardless of the previous
records, the Cardinal must enter a
hostile environment and outper
form one of the nation's best soc
cer teams.
"It is definitely more challeng
ing to play on the road, but there is
no reason to play a different game
if we play focused." McKee said.
A fourth obstacle has been the
weather in the Bay Area this
week. Rain has limited on-field
practicing this week on the Farm.
"We had some problems get
ting on-field training done this
week due to inclement weather,
but I think UCLA was in a similar

situation with rain in Los Angeles
as well," said Simon.
Even with all these challenges,
Stanford still believes it can be
successful this weekend. To do so,
the Cardinal must elevate their
level of focus.
Last Sunday, the Cardinal gave
up a goal early in the second half
because of lack of intensity and
focus coming out of halftime. The
second goal was scored on a de
fensive lapse where an errant
touch practically teed up a shot for
a Bruin forward.
"We played very well in the
first 45 minutes of the game
against UCLA, and then let up in
the second half especially early."
McKee said. "1 think we can be
successful if we put back-to-back
great halves together."
Along with focus, the Cardinal
must also finish better when scor
ing chances arise.
"In order to be more successful
we need to play a great game and
be early-mistake free," Simon
said. "We need to kick our game
up a couple notches. Also, we had
a number ol great chances, espe
cially in the first half [last Sunday|.
We need to capitalize and make

the most of those chances, because
it's almost impossible to complete
ly shut down a team like UCLA
for the whole match."
Scoring goals early continues to
be a struggle for the Cardinal.
Only three of Stanford's 16 goals
have come in the first half of play.
As a result, the Cardinal have
played from behind for much of the
year. Though this style of play cre
ates intense drama, as witnessed in
the games at Maloney Field against
California and then last week
against UC-Davis, winning be
comes exceptionally difficult.
The Stanford team sees this as a
chance to build momentum for the
end of the season.
"It is a great opportunity to
turn things around and get on a
roll," Simon said.
Getting back on a winning track
is important, as the schedule will
be a tough challenge with foes like
Oregon State, Washington, previ
ously No. 1 UC-Santa Barbara and
rival California.
Revenge tonight on one of col
lege soccer's perennial powers
would be a huge step on the way
toward a successful final stretch of
the season.
