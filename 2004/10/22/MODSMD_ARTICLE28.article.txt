# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## A
						story too wild to be told: and I told you all along 
### 
/ find I'm so excited I can barely sit
• I still, or hold a thought in my head. I
think it's the excitement only a free
JL. man can feel. A free man at the start
of a long journey whose conclusion is uncer
tain. 1 hope 1 can make it across the border. I
hope to see my friend and shake, his hand. I
hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my

dreams. I hope."
They were done. Down 3-
0. Blown out.
Curt Shilling's ankle had
fallen off. Pedro had pitched
his final inning in a Red Sox
uniform. Hell. Johnny
Damon forgot where first
base was.he hadn't seen it in
so long.
The blank stare of defeat
had crept into the Boston

dugout, and the face of total exasperation blan
keted Fenway.
Or, as ESPN's Bill Simmons said, compar
ing the ALCS to poker, "Sox have a J-7. Yanks
have two queens. There's a 9-2-A on the table."
But they came creeping back. A little here, a
little there. Dave Roberts pinch running in
Game 4. down 4-3 — that means three outs to
elimination, for those of you scoring at home.
Rivera checking him back. Lead. Pickoff.
Lead. Pickoff.
Everyone who has ever watched so much as
cricket knew he was going to take off, and sure
enough, he went. Roberts went on to score the
tying run. sending the game to extras. It was the
little things that put Boston over the top, stuff
hard to remember when you need to win four
in a row.
But I don't really know what else to say. I
write this column and I feel like 1 should bestow
something upon you. A story, a reason, a key
insight that only I can donate to my readers, but
I have nothing. You all saw it.
You saw how Curt Schilling is a man of his
word, vowing to lead the Red Sox to the World
Series at the beginning of the year, and keeping
his word this week despite undergoing a proce
dure tested only once on a cadaver. I am be
yond sure that after this postseason Schilling
will reveal that by suffering through this opera
tion, literally sewing the detached tendon into
the muscle with no thoughts of rehabilitation,
he had sacrificed any semblance of a future ca
reer.
This is his final shot, and will go down in his
tory as the gutsiest athletic performance ever.
Ahead of the Flu Game, ahead of Willis Reed,
and ahead of Favre's Monday Night. He is sac
rificing his entire career for one team, an old
school tactic fora new-school team in an old
school game.
The eight of spades fell during Game 6.
You saw the re-emergence of the best lead
off hitter in the game, and he isn't Japanese. I
mean, Damon is not the best hitter, fielder, nor
runner — although he did get under the tag last
night. But talk to me about clubhouse dynam
ics. Talk to me about power. Talk to me about
redemption, and you have your man.
You saw how greed can be overcome by tal
ent and desire. How the A-Rods of this world
ultimately fail, how a checkbook never guaran
tees wins, and how "curse" is just a made-up
word — a politician's word — so that the Tim
McCarvers, Dan Shaugnessys and New York
Post headline writers like yourself can wear a
suit and a tie and have a job.
It happens in all sports, in all relationships,
in all of life. There are some teams you can just
destroy. You can just walk all over them, score
five runs in two innings, four goals in the first
half, reject them from Notre Dame five times in
a row and watch them fold. They will wither
away, caving to dominance and power.
But there are those that come back. There
are those that never give up. There are those
that have heart.
