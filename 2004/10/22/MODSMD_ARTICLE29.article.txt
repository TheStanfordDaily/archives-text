# No. 18 women shoot for SoCal sweep and top of the Pac-10 heap
## 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a week at home, the Stan
ford women's soccer team is back on
the road this weekend as it heads to
Los Angeles to take on conference
rivals Southern California and No. 7
UCLA. Coming off their first Pacif
ic* 10 Conference win of the season
last Sunday against Arizona State,
the No. IS Cardinal (9-3-2, 1-1-1
Pac-10) are looking to build on their
current confidence and momentum.
Despite a shaky start to the con
ference season, a two-for-two week
end in SoCal would catapult the
Cardinal from sixth place to the top
of the Pac-10 standings.
"These two teams are very com
petitive and I think that if we win
both games, we will further our
chances of winning a Pac-10 title."
said sophomore defender Shari
Summers. "I know everyone expects
to win. and if we don't, it will be a
disappointment because of how
great our team's potential is."
A sweep would be more than the
Cardinal could muster in their first
Pac-10 homestand last weekend.
Before bouncing back with a 2-1 vic
tory over the Sun Devils, Arizona
defeated the Cardinal 2-1 for the
first time in school history with a
last-minute goal in the second of two
overtime sessions.
"I think we are coming off this
past weekend with mixed emo
tions," said junior defender Jenny
Farenbaugh. "We were extremely
disappointed with the loss we suf
fered on Friday versus Arizona, and
we were happy about the win on
Sunday versus ASU."
The first match of the weekend
will come on Friday night against
highly touted UCLA. The Bruins
(10-4-0, 3-1-0 Pac-10) entered the
season as the favorite to defend their
Pac-10 title and currently sit atop the
conference standings.
The Bruins have been on an of
fensive tear since the Pac-10 season
began, outscoring opponents 14-2.
Forward Bristyn Davis, who leads
the team with lOgoals and 25 points,
has scored five goals in the Bruins'
last four games.
Davis and UCLA are not invinci
ble. however, as Washington State
proved in its 1 -0 upset of the Bruins last
weekend. The Cougars won despite
being out-shot 17 to 4, thanks to nine
saves from goalkeeper Katie l lultin.
The Cardinal have a strong de
fensive unit that is just as capable of
containing the Bruins.
Senior goalkeeper Nicole Barn

hart has been stellar between the
posts, having allowed just seven
goals all season fora 0.49 goals
against average.
The defense in front of Barnhart
has been solid as well and is a major
reason the Cardinal have not al
lowed more than two goals in a sin
gle game. One of the defense's few
areas of weakness this season has
been preventing the opposition
from scoring off of corner kicks. The
Cardinal fared better in that depart
ment on Sunday, however, as the
Sun Devils booted three corners
without a score.
The Cardinal and Bruins have
been evenly matched throughout

the years, and the all-time series
stands at 5-5-2. including a scoreless
draw last season.
"UCLA is always a tough match
for us," said junior defender Hayley
Hunt. "After a tie to them last year
at home, I think our team would re
ally like to pull out a win against
them this year."
Stanford will wrap up its road trip
on Sunday afternoon against un
ranked Southern California (8-5-1,
2-2-0 Pac-10). The Trojans opened
up their Pac-10 season with a pair of
wins over the Oregon schools, which
helped them crack the national
rankings for the first time this sea

son. But their stay was short-lived,
as the squad fell to Washington and
Washington Slate last weekend.
Reigning Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year Rosa Anna Tantillo leads the
Trojans on offense. The sophomore
midfielder has eight goals and
points and has scored in three of her
last four games. Redshirt freshman
goalkeeper Veronica Simonton has
sparkled in goal since unseating se
nior Julie Peterson for the starting
role in mid-September. Simonton is
6-2-1 with a .82 goals-against aver
age.
While the road environment will
be more hostile than the friendly
confines of Maloney Field, the Car-

dinal probably won't be at as much
of a disadvantage on this trip as sub
sequent ones.
"Playing on the road is always
hard," Hunt said. "A lot of our team
is from Southern California, so we
should have our fair share of fans."
With or without the fan support,
the Cardinal are focused on inching
their way closer to the top of the
Pac-10 standings this weekend.
"It's most definitely within our
reach," said senior midfielder Amy
Grady. "It is just a matter of taking
each game like it is the deciding fac
tor for the title, one game at a time,
and getting the results we need."

Pac-10 standings this weekend.
"It's most definitely within our
reach," said senior midfielder Amy
Grady. "It is just a matter of taking
each game like it is the deciding fac
tor for the title, one game at a time,
and getting the results we need."

The Stanford women's soccer team travels to Los Angeles fora pair of con
ference games at UCLA and USC.
After a week at home, the Stan
ford women's soccer team is back on
the road this weekend as it heads to
Los Angeles to take on conference
rivals Southern California and No. 7
UCLA. Coming off their first Pacif
ic* 10 Conference win of the season
last Sunday against Arizona State,
the No. IS Cardinal (9-3-2, 1-1-1
Pac-10) are looking to build on their
current confidence and momentum.
Despite a shaky start to the con
ference season, a two-for-two week
end in SoCal would catapult the
Cardinal from sixth place to the top
of the Pac-10 standings.
"These two teams are very com
petitive and I think that if we win
both games, we will further our
chances of winning a Pac-10 title."
said sophomore defender Shari
Summers. "I know everyone expects
to win. and if we don't, it will be a
disappointment because of how
great our team's potential is."
A sweep would be more than the
Cardinal could muster in their first
Pac-10 homestand last weekend.
Before bouncing back with a 2-1 vic
tory over the Sun Devils, Arizona
defeated the Cardinal 2-1 for the
first time in school history with a
last-minute goal in the second of two
overtime sessions.
"I think we are coming off this
past weekend with mixed emo
tions," said junior defender Jenny
Farenbaugh. "We were extremely
disappointed with the loss we suf
fered on Friday versus Arizona, and
we were happy about the win on
Sunday versus ASU."
The first match of the weekend
will come on Friday night against
highly touted UCLA. The Bruins
(10-4-0, 3-1-0 Pac-10) entered the
season as the favorite to defend their
Pac-10 title and currently sit atop the
conference standings.
The Bruins have been on an of
fensive tear since the Pac-10 season
began, outscoring opponents 14-2.
Forward Bristyn Davis, who leads
the team with lOgoals and 25 points,
has scored five goals in the Bruins'
last four games.
Davis and UCLA are not invinci
ble. however, as Washington State
proved in its 1 -0 upset of the Bruins last
weekend. The Cougars won despite
being out-shot 17 to 4, thanks to nine
saves from goalkeeper Katie l lultin.
The Cardinal have a strong de
fensive unit that is just as capable of
containing the Bruins.
Senior goalkeeper Nicole Barn

hart has been stellar between the
posts, having allowed just seven
goals all season fora 0.49 goals
against average.
The defense in front of Barnhart
has been solid as well and is a major
reason the Cardinal have not al
lowed more than two goals in a sin
gle game. One of the defense's few
areas of weakness this season has
been preventing the opposition
from scoring off of corner kicks. The
Cardinal fared better in that depart
ment on Sunday, however, as the
Sun Devils booted three corners
without a score.
The Cardinal and Bruins have
been evenly matched throughout

the years, and the all-time series
stands at 5-5-2. including a scoreless
draw last season.
"UCLA is always a tough match
for us," said junior defender Hayley
Hunt. "After a tie to them last year
at home, I think our team would re
ally like to pull out a win against
them this year."
Stanford will wrap up its road trip
on Sunday afternoon against un
ranked Southern California (8-5-1,
2-2-0 Pac-10). The Trojans opened
up their Pac-10 season with a pair of
wins over the Oregon schools, which
helped them crack the national
rankings for the first time this sea

son. But their stay was short-lived,
as the squad fell to Washington and
Washington Slate last weekend.
Reigning Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year Rosa Anna Tantillo leads the
Trojans on offense. The sophomore
midfielder has eight goals and
points and has scored in three of her
last four games. Redshirt freshman
goalkeeper Veronica Simonton has
sparkled in goal since unseating se
nior Julie Peterson for the starting
role in mid-September. Simonton is
6-2-1 with a .82 goals-against aver
age.
While the road environment will
be more hostile than the friendly
confines of Maloney Field, the Car-

dinal probably won't be at as much
of a disadvantage on this trip as sub
sequent ones.
"Playing on the road is always
hard," Hunt said. "A lot of our team
is from Southern California, so we
should have our fair share of fans."
With or without the fan support,
the Cardinal are focused on inching
their way closer to the top of the
Pac-10 standings this weekend.
"It's most definitely within our
reach," said senior midfielder Amy
Grady. "It is just a matter of taking
each game like it is the deciding fac
tor for the title, one game at a time,
and getting the results we need."
