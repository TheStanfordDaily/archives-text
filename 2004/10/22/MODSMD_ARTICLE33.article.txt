# COUNTDOWN TO KICKOFF
## Saturday, October 23,2004 Stanford Stadium 2:00 p.m. Homecoming 
### 
It's been seven long years since the Ducks (3-3, 2-1) waddled into Stanford Stadium and left after a record-setting
SH-49 defeat. The past four meetings between the two schools have taken place at Autzen Stadium, with Oregon win
ning three of those games, including a humiliating 35-0 beating last season. Stanford (4-2, 2-1) is looking to turn the
tables this season after an important, nail-biting win at Washington State. A fifth win for Buddy Teevens' gang would
be the perfect way to celebrate the Homecoming weekend.

D

Oregon RB Terrence Whitehead vs. Stanford D-Line

In 24 games prior to this season, the junior from Gardena, Calif., had
topped the century mark on the ground just twice. But guess what? Both
of those performances came against the Cardinal. In 2(X)2. Whitehead
pounded out 132 yards on 29 carries in Oregon's 41-14 win. He outdid
himself a year later with a career-high 172 yards on just 23 carries, plus
three touchdowns as part of a 35-0 romp in Eugene. This season. White
head has reached triple digits twice; against Idaho (115) and more re
cently against Washington State (166). He's coming off a three-touch
down performance in the Ducks' 28-14 win over Arizona. The 2004 Stan
ford defense is far less porous than in years past, however, having not al
lowed a single rusher to top the century mark this season.

SE

Oregon QB Kellen Clemens vs. Stanford LBs
He's less heralded than USC's Matt Leinart and even Cal's Aaron Rodgers,
but Clemens is one of the better quarterbacks the Stanford defense will face
this season. He's coming off back-to-back monster performances, including
a six-touchdown performance (three passing, three rushing) against Wash
ington State, and has a four-to-one touchdown-to-interception ratio. In fact,
he hasn't thrown a pick since he threw three in a week-one loss to Indiana.
Kevin Schimmelmann and the rest of the Stanford linebacker corps will be
busy, as Clemens is not afraid to scramble outside the pocket.

E

Stanford TE Alex Smith vs.
Oregon TE Tim Day
No, they won't be lining up opposite each other, but it would
be fun to see two of the Pac-10's top tight ends duke it out.
Day has 20 catches for 323 yards and four touchdowns this
season, while Smith has caught 25 balls for 286 yards and one
score. Both could be the go-to targets tomorrow. A big day
from either big player (Smith's 6-foot-5,255; Day's 6-foot 4,
268) could be the difference in the game.

SE

Oregon QB Kellen Clemens vs. Stanford LBs
He's less heralded than USC's Matt Leinart and even Cal's Aaron Rodgers,
but Clemens is one of the better quarterbacks the Stanford defense will face
this season. He's coming off back-to-back monster performances, including
a six-touchdown performance (three passing, three rushing) against Wash
ington State, and has a four-to-one touchdown-to-interception ratio. In fact,
he hasn't thrown a pick since he threw three in a week-one loss to Indiana.
Kevin Schimmelmann and the rest of the Stanford linebacker corps will be
busy, as Clemens is not afraid to scramble outside the pocket.

E

Stanford TE Alex Smith vs.
Oregon TE Tim Day
No, they won't be lining up opposite each other, but it would
be fun to see two of the Pac-10's top tight ends duke it out.
Day has 20 catches for 323 yards and four touchdowns this
season, while Smith has caught 25 balls for 286 yards and one
score. Both could be the go-to targets tomorrow. A big day
from either big player (Smith's 6-foot-5,255; Day's 6-foot 4,
268) could be the difference in the game.

It's been seven long years since the Ducks (3-3, 2-1) waddled into Stanford Stadium and left after a record-setting
SH-49 defeat. The past four meetings between the two schools have taken place at Autzen Stadium, with Oregon win
ning three of those games, including a humiliating 35-0 beating last season. Stanford (4-2, 2-1) is looking to turn the
tables this season after an important, nail-biting win at Washington State. A fifth win for Buddy Teevens' gang would
be the perfect way to celebrate the Homecoming weekend.

Oregon RB Terrence Whitehead vs. Stanford D-Line

In 24 games prior to this season, the junior from Gardena, Calif., had
topped the century mark on the ground just twice. But guess what? Both
of those performances came against the Cardinal. In 2(X)2. Whitehead
pounded out 132 yards on 29 carries in Oregon's 41-14 win. He outdid
himself a year later with a career-high 172 yards on just 23 carries, plus
three touchdowns as part of a 35-0 romp in Eugene. This season. White
head has reached triple digits twice; against Idaho (115) and more re
cently against Washington State (166). He's coming off a three-touch
down performance in the Ducks' 28-14 win over Arizona. The 2004 Stan
ford defense is far less porous than in years past, however, having not al
lowed a single rusher to top the century mark this season.
