# Sgroi's getting his kicks for improved Cardinal
##

Junior placekicker Michael Sgroi knows what it's like to
he frustrated.
Alter a promising freshman season in which he made
five-of-six field goal attempts in the Cardinal's wins, Sgroi
played last year with a broken vertebrae. His accuracy and
distance suffered, the punter had to handle kickoffs, and it
hurt every time Sgroi tried to do his job on the field.
"When you're having trouble walking, it's no fun out
there trying to kick," he said.
Still, he went out there and tried to do what he could. But
he connected on just 7-of-13 attempts, with a long of just 38
yards. When the Cardinal went for it on fourth downs in
field goal territory, he knew the fans were looking his way.
I le also knew there was nothing he could do but wait it
out.
"It's a bone," he said of his injury. "You just have to let it
heal."
I his summer, Sgroi's spine was finally back to normal.
He felt healthy and he couldn't wait to show the college
football world what he could really do.
It was clear from the beginning that something had
changed. All season long, he's shown excellent hang time
and distance on his kickoffs, with 14 of 34 going for touch
backs. Last weekend at Washington State, four of his six
kickoffs weren't even returnable, sailing out of the end zone
on the fly.
"It must be something to do with the cold weather,"
joked the Michigan native.
But kickoffs are one thing, and field goals are another.
And as far as kicking from placement goes, Sgroi's season
got off to a frustrating start. He missed a 42-yarder against
San Jose State, then missed a 49-yarder and a 22-yarder in
the first half against Brigham Young.
Few would have guessed then where Sgroi would be now
third in the Pac-10 in both scoring (7.5 points per game)
and field-goal accuracy (75 percent).
But Sgroi, who earned first-team All-State honors as a
senior in high school, knew he was a better kicker than what
his early-season woes showed. So did his teammates and
coaches, who came up to him on the sidelines and reminded
him of what he had been doing in practice and what he could
do the next time he took the field.
"Once I got the mental part back again, it came around,"
Sgroi said "When you feel good and your team is confident
in you, it gives you confidence in yourself."
It didn't take long for Sgroi to get a chance to redeem
himself. I le would get three more attempts later in the B YU
game, and he would make them all. connecting from 19, 29
and 41 yards. He wouldn't get to attempt another field goal
until four weeks later, but in the Cardinal's last two games,
lie's six-for-six, including a career-long 47-yarder against
Washington State last week.
"lie's playing with great confidence and he's shown great
maturity," head coach Buddy Teevens said of his kicker.
"I lis last field goal [against Washington State| was verycrit
ical"
With this year's Cardinal scoring more touchdowns and
moving the ball more effectively, Sgroi is on the field a lot
more than in the past two years. Booting more kickoffs,
PATs and field goals is something Sgroi says has helped him
stay sharp.
"It's fun to be out there on the field, rather than on the
sideline for four quarters," he said. "Kicking's like any other
position, where you get into a rhythm."
Sgroi knows something about other positions, too. At 5-
foot-l 1 and 20() pounds, Sgroi started at both quarterback
and safety for his high school. He even led the team in tack
les as a senior.
Those skills have come in handy now and then. Sgroi
took an errant PAT snap against UCLA in 2002 and com
pleted a pass to Will Svitek fora two-point conversion.
But those extraneous skills aren't what have made Sgroi

so valuable to the team this season. It's the fact that he can
and has done the job when he's been asked this year.
After the Cardinal's win over Washington State, senior
linebacker Peter Bergeron got on the intercom of the team's
charter plane and announced that the seniors had named
Sgroi player of the game.
It wasn't exactly an Academy Award, but Sgroi got the
applause and cheers of his teammates.

More importantly, he was three-for-three kicking off
damp turf in a six-point win. Granted, Sgroi was far from the
only player who stood out in the Cardinal's win, but that's
exactly his point.
"A lot of times, people forget that there are three differ
ent teams that need to do their job: offense, defense and spe
cial teams," he said. "When we can all do our jobs, you see
what happens. We win."

cial and career-long 47-yard boot at Washington State last weekend.
