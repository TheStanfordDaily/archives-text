# In Memoriam: Music for Daniel Pearl
## 
### NICHOLAS CASEY INTERMISSION WRITER 
If they hadn't known, few would
have guessed that what was taking
place in Memorial Church last
Thursday evening was a memorial
service. In fact, the church was
about the only thing that gave this
away: the organ was touched only
once, an opera was performed by a
single woman and a number of per
formers were scattered around the
chancel's front steps chanting num
bers as Mark Applebuam played a
piece called "Music for 88."
This was the third Daniel Pearl
Music Day that's taken place at
Stanford since the reporter from the
Wall Street Journal was slain in Pak
istan in 2003. Pearl, a Stanford grad
uate, was also an avid violinist, fid
dler and mandolinist, and during his
travels with the Journal, he found
himself playing with musicians from
across the world.
There's certainly nothing simple
about remembering those who've
passed away. But the genius of that
evening was the ease with which it
did: confronting memory head-on
(opening with remembrances of
Rabbi Karlin-Neumann and
Michelle Pearl), but managing at
the same time to escape the conven
tional hues of despair which come
with this type of memory.
That's to say, this was not a place
for "Ave Maria" or "Amazing
Grace" — in fact, what was most
striking about that night was its
bucking of tradition: all of the com
posers who were performed (aside
for one) were living, and about a
quarter of the program was written
this year.
It opened with the St. Lawrence
String Quartet's performance of a
piece by the Music Department's

Jonathan Berger, "Carry It On"
(2004), with its slow melodies and
drones. Hut any sign of a dirge was
brushed away when Mark Apple
haum sat down to the piano with ex
cerpts from Tom Johnson's "Music
for 88," his 1988 minimalist piano
score played under the recitation of
various numbers by men and
women on stage dressed in black.
Eventually, a piece which would
call itself an opera would be per
formed by soprano Jennifer Lane:
"King Harald's Saga" (1978), in
three acts, describes the failed 1066
invasion of England by Harald of
Norway through a single soprano
voice which narrates and performs
all dialogue.
People were taking risks that
night. But one person in particular
took a risk larger than the others,
and in the process ended up over
shadowing the rest. This was a con
cert about memory, so here's what I
re member: "soulhissmeta-lo
tusmessiah" and Adrian Coburn. In
the company of musical greats, it
was a senior from Russian and East
European Studies who truly man
aged to do justice to the acoustics of
the church.
Joined by the incredible vocal
talent of senior Roopa Meena Ma
hadevan and the accompaniment of
an organ, Coburn formulated "soul
hissmeta-lotusmessiah" with two
texts, one Yiddish and one Sanskrit.
This unlikely equation of the
Yiddish longing for the Messiah
("May the emperor come soon, /
May the excellent one come in our
days") and the invocation of the god
Vishnu ("Shriman Narayana /1 sur
render to your lotus feet"), some
how works, and works very well.
The pitting of the two voices
against the organ created an infec
tious aura in that resonant room and

the massive organ and its pipes
quickly became everything that can
be imagined by a lotus and its
swamps. This dazzling, strange cre
ation left an audience with the antic
ipation of what will become of Adri
an Coburn as she develops her tal
ents as a composer, creating, no
doubt, more polyglotic gems.
Daniel Pearl's memorial came in
the spirit of the old Irish wake, half
remembrance, half celebration. Al
though no one understands why
Pearl had to die, it is understood
that he leaves the university with an
annual treasure, something to re
member him by for years to come.
