### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
Going out (in theaters: "Huckabees") or staying in? (on
DVD: "Eternal Sunshine")
While so many films today are focused on the frivolous pursuit
of "entertaining" an audience, "awing" the viewer or simply "sell
ing merchandise," two films have surfaced recently sharing a
somewhat more attainable goal: to find the meaning of life.
When "I Heart Huckabees" opens, we find Albert Markovski
(Jason Schwartzman) muttering obscenities to himself in the mid
dle of an endangered marsh. Working with a task force aimed at
saving the marsh from destruction, at the hands of the Huckabees
Corporation, Albert has pitted himself against Huckabees' front
man Brad Stand (Jude Law). Brad's interests lie solely in himself
and the advancement of his own career, even if that means having
to date the irrepressible "face of 1 iuckabees" Dawn Campbell
(Naomi Watts) and hob-nob with the likes of Shania Twain. It's
a tough life.

However, things take a turn for the convoluted when Albert
gets mixed up with a pair of existential detectives (Lily Tomlin
and Dustin Hoffman) trying to solve a case of coincidence in
volving an African doorman. I know what you're thinking: "How
many times have I seen this plot before, c'mon."
Okay, so the plot may seem new and interesting, but "Huck
abees" closely parallels something we have seen before, last
year's "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind." Both films are
conceived of quite similarly — one man trying to understand a co
incidence that leads him into unearthing elements of his past, psy
chological reasons for existence, etc.
But the difference is really the overall effect of the film. "Eter
nal Sunshine" is a much more challenging film. Tracking the
failed relationship between the neurotic / melancholy Joel (Jim
Carrey) and the punkish Clementine (Kate Winslet), the film
delves into the complexities of memory erasure. Scripted by the
spotless mind that also penned "Adaptation" (Charlie Kaufman),
"Eternal Sunshine" explores the nuances of consciousness as well
as the difficulties of interpersonal relationships in a much deeper

way than "Huckabees" does.
"Eternal Sunshine" makes the viewer feel as if he is really in
Joel's head, experiencing each thought along with him. The bulk
of the film follows Joel and Clementine, but things get more com
plicated when the agency in charge of the memory erasure gets
involved.
While both films are innately intriguing, "Huckabees" tends to
glide along the surface of existential ideas, relying on digital
tricks, which impact the audience in a more visual than cerebral
vyay. Perhaps the most successful scene is a dinner table exchange
between Albert. Tommy (Mark Wahlberg) and the family who
has adopted the African doorman. Issues of religion, spirituality
and ecological conservation all get hashed out unabashedly. And
you thought dinnertime at your house was rough.
"1 Heart Huckabees" is an interesting psychological trip, and
while its biggest mistake may be underutili/ing its actors, it is
worth a look. But if you're serious about making an existential
journey, stay home and rent "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind."
