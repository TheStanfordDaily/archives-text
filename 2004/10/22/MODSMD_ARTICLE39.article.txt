# All Affleck wants for 'Christmas' is his career back
## 
### TOM HANADA INTERMISSION CO-EDITOR 
Does it bother you that a Christmas movie — involving Ben
Affleck's latest attempt at comedy — is opening a week before
Halloween? Shouldn't the theaters be tilled with zombie films
and teen slasher Hicks right now? In fact, "Surviving Christ
mas" will probably be removed from most theaters by the first
week of December.
Is this movie so horrendous that it had to beat the seasonal
rush by jumping to the big screen a full month before most
Christmas movies? Actually, and surprisingly, no.
Affleck plays Drew Latham, an attractive millionaire who,
not looking forward to yet another lonely Christmas, returns to
his childhood home in an attempt to rekindle the holiday spirit
with his family. Of course, the family living in the house is not
his. but the Valcos, played by James Gandolfini (i.e. Tony So
prano), Catherine O'Hara (i.e. one of those people in every
Christopher Guest mockumentary). Josh Zuckerman and at

tractive, cynical Christina Applegate. Latham pays the Valcos
$250,000 to pretend they are his family and show him a good
old-fashioned Christmas. Predictable love interest? Yep. Con
trived character confessions to reveal depth? Yep. Character
growth and understanding of each other through unnatural mo
ments of intimacy? Oh, yeah.
Despite a decent plot, "Surviving Christmas" awkwardly forces
Affleck into the Valcos' house in such a way as to make Affleck ap
pear completely psychotic. Of course this makes his falling for
Christina Applegate even more contrived and unrealistic. Who
could fall in love with a lunatic who bought his way into your fam
ily for the holidays? It's unfortunate that romance sells, because
the movie would be much stronger if it ditched the love sub-plot
and used the time to focus more on characters.
Sadly, the weakest part of the movie is Affleck's role. Drew
Latham tries to be the lovable adult looking to relive memories of
his childhood, but it's nearly impossible to get past the realization
that this guy really has some deep psychological issues. Affleck's
arrogantly over-the-top acting makes it difficult to accept the con

nection the Valcos eventually form with him.
Most of the film's humor stems from the performances of Gan
dolfini and O'Hara. Gandolfini in particular uses his facial expres
sions more than his voice to make the situations funny. Watching
Tony Soprano's face after he's forced to wear a Santa hat is price
less. The film contains some very witty dialogue and some gen
uinely funny moments. In content, it's similar to "National Lam
poon's Christmas Vacation" (if Chevy Chase were to be replaced
by a millionaire trying to buy his way into a family).
There's a very homey feeling to "Surviving Christmas"
that should remind every audience member of their own
Christmas experience in some way: The house is cramped,
the presents are poorly wrapped, and everyone wears paja
mas all day. The chemistry between the members of the
Valco family makes it easy to ignore the glaring awkward
ness of certain story moments. This is definitely no "Miracle
on 34th Street" or "It's a Wonderful Life" but it's still a
good dysfunctional family movie set against the backdrop of
the holiday season.
