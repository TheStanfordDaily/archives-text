# UNITED IN THE SPOTLIGHT
## The 						7th Annual United Nations Association Film Festival 
### ANNA NORTH INTERMISSION FEATURES WRITER 
At the United Nations Association Film Festival in
2001,1 saw a film called "Right Road Lost." I was a fresh
man; the film's subject. Phil Rios, was a retired United
States National Guardsman.
As I watched, Rios described the first Gulf War, in
which he helped bury Iraqi soldiers alive in an under
ground bunker. While he talked, he slowly ate a Mexi
can meal. His ability to enjoy his food in tne face of his
own atrocities didn t make him seem like a monster; it
made him seem normal. As he finished his flan, I was
struck with the power of documentary film to humanize
catastrophe — to force us into an awareness of our own
failings.
This year, the festivals theme is "The Values of Toler
ance," and its goal is less to expose sin than to promote
understanding. Its 27 documentary films, showing this
Wednesday through Sunday, will broaden the perspec
tives of those used to Hollywood fare. Though they vary
widely in subject matter, all react in some way to the
stigma of difference.
Before this year's festival, I had the opportunity to pre
view seven or the films. Watching them, I remembered
Phil Rios and the moral and historical consciousness that
his meal awakened in me. Even the weakest of the films
I viewed revived this consciousness, and I recommend
the festival as a whole as a powerful antidote to the
sometimes narrow focus of student life.

"When Abortion Was Illegal"
Dorothy Fadiman
The stories of the women in Dorothy Fadi
man's film are undeniably affecting. One
woman's experience at a home for unwed moth
ers is particularly timely in light of the current ad
ministration's Favor for sucn homes. However,
poor production values mar "When Abortion
Was Illegal." Its point — that outlawing abortion
causes agony for women — is hardly a new one,
and a montage of Victorian-era sketches and
talking heads do little to make it fresh.
Screened on 0ct.21, 6:00 p.m.

t' k Sister Helen"
Robert Fruchtman, Rebecca Cammisa
Sister Helen Travis, owner of a private home for
recovering male drug addicts, is a strange person to
spend 8(8 minutes witn. She sounds like Marge Simp
son, favors long harangues and practices a brand of
tough love as inconsistent as it is fierce. Yet the men
in her care love her like a mother, qk
As they kiss, insult, beg and obey her, they seem like a
family teetering on the verge of disintegration; the fear
that this teeter will turn into free fall permeates the film.
"Sister Helen" is an extremely intimate portrayal — at
times, the camera seems too close — of a woman who
has devoted her life to others. It will broaden your con
ception of the forms such devotion can take.
Screening Sunday, 1:15 p.m.

"Who Is Disabled?"
Jones Obuadey
The parents in Jones Obuadey's "Who Is Dis
abled?" struggle to raise disabled
children in a society that often dismisses them. In
Ghana, where the film takes place, such children are
often labeled "cursed" or "useless." Obuadey's goal is
to challenge this notion, and to inspire tolerance and
understanding of those Ghanaians call "intellectually
disabled." The filing message will be familiar to
American audiences, but it is worthwhile as a re
minder of how readily societies marginalize those per
ceived as different.
Screening Sunday, 4:00 p.m.

"A Life of Death"
Dawn Westlake
/ Donald Wcstlake's poem about the inevitable recurrence of\
/war carries real emotion. Listening to his recitation while watching\
/ a series of photos and drawings of military conflict, we can't help but \
(wince at the irony as its speaker assures his younger brother that each!
y successive war will bring "peace on Earth/' Neither the poem nor J
\ its visual presentation is particularly groundbreaking — West- /
n. lake isn't saying anything new here. Unfortunately, he /
might argue, neither is history. '
Screening Friday, 9:40 p.m.

"Looking Down"
Casey Hayward

This rather puzzling film presents the viewer with a series of still
images while a voice-over obliquely discusses surveillance. The central
issue — the potentially misleading or immoral nature of U.S. intelli
gence-gathering techniques — might be more rewardingly posed with
additional background information about these techniques. Instead, we
get a series of pointed questions like, "Intelligence — is it understand
ing?" Perhaps not. but this film does little to help us understand.
Screening Sunday, 5:25 p.m.

"Deadline"
Kathy Chevigny, Kirsten Johnson, Dallas Brennan
Governor George Rvan of Illinois faced a unique challenge at the end of his term in 2002; he had to pass judg
ment on his state's application of the deathpenalty. With 13 death-row inmates recently exonerated, the system
clearlv had problems — Ryan would decide if these problems warranted a blanket commutation or sentences.
A number of voices weigh in on the issues, but two stand out: a warden, who performed executions at an Illi
nois prison, and Ryan himself. The governor comes across as a model of thoroughness and decency, and his
' voice on the subject is one of the most convincing Ive heard. "Deadline" slants decidedly against the death
penalty. TTiis was surely the intent of the filmmakers, and they make their point well.
Screening Saturday, 7:00 p.m.

"Big Enough''^^
Jan Krawitz
/ In her 1982 film "Little People,"
/ Jan Krawitz spoke with children affected by \
/dwarfism. "Big Enough" revisits these children,\
/ now old enough to have children of their own. \
/ Their choices to do so — or not — are the most in- \
/ teresting parts of the film, particularly in light of
technologies that allow prenatal testing for dwarfism.
I would have liked to see this topic addressed more
1 deeply, but Krawitz's interests lie with her subjects,
\ not with the politics of their condition. The result is
Y a film of narrow scope, but substantial emotional /
\ heft. The little people profiled articulate their /
\ pain and pride with candor, and viewers will /
\ likely find themselves inspired by the gen- /
\ erosity with which they allow the cam- /
\ era into their lives.
• Screening Saturday, 4:45
