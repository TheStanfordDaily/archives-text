## This ain't your grandparents' FLiCKS 
### DARREN FRANICH INTERMISSION SOBRIETY CONSULTANT 
112 or those of you who like watch
ing four-month-old movies in a
crowded auditorium and desperate
ly want to combine that activity with
legitimate, Intermission-approved
alcoholism, we bring you the unoffi
cial, MPAA-approved FLiCKS
drinking game, complete with the
audience-tested drink of choice for
each movie this quarter. 1 ley kids,
drink responsibly ... then play our
game and get hammered!
The Manchurian Candidate
Like the original, only without
humor and interesting political com
mentary. In the lame-knockoff spir
it, grab a Rolling Rock Green Light:
like the original, only low-carb. And
castrated!
Every time...
You swear Denzel Washington
had exactly the same rebel-maver
ick-outcast lines and action se
quences in "John Q." "The Siege,"
"Courage Under Fire," "Crimson
Tide" (wait, every movie that he's
been in): Drink.
Someone delivers a scathing line
about corrupt American politics and
how awesome it is to be rich and evil:
Hum "America the Beautiful"
through your tears and finish the case.
Alien Vs. Predator

It's not that
"AvP" — as
the movie nick
named itself, is
a bad movie;
it's just the
worst movie
ever made.
Steal keg beer
from a frat
party so you
don't waste any
money when

you throw your drink at the screen.
Every time...
You notice the lack of Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Sigourney Weaver
and anyone who could out-act a
stick-figure: Drink.
The creepy sexual tension be
tween the lead actress and the lead
Predator almost results in the grodiest
hook-up ever: Ponder the true dan

ger of beer goggles and shot-gun
one.
Collateral
A movie with evocative visuals,
tense violence, good dialogue, fine
acting and a final act noteworthy
for its lack of any of the above. For
that really disappointing, almost
perfect-except-for-the-milky-af-
tertaste vibe, concoct a White
Russian.
Every time...
Tom Cruise makes you wish
you could pull off gray hair so
badassly: Sip enviously.

Jada Pinkett Smith's lack of tal
ent depresses you and reminds you
of those awful Matrix sequels: Chug
through the pain.
Harry Potter and the
Prisoner of A/kahan

The year's best three-quel gets
props for livening up the till-now
mediocre franchise with some new
blood (director Alfonso Cuaron also
made the foreign sex-stravaganza
"Y Tu Mama Tambien"). Grab a
Miller Lite, the "Comeback King of
Beers," and deuce it with some New
castle for that proper British flavor.

Every time...
A famous and prestigious British
actor / actress who is probably most fa
mous for acting in Shakespearean
plays and has won lots of Oscars ap
pears for two seconds in a funny "wiz
arding'getup: Drink.
Someone calls Harry Potter '"Air
ray Paw-ah" (those kooky Brits!):
Drink 'till you grow an accent.
Garden State
A movie about quirky characters
doing quirky things in New Jersey,
the quirky capital of the Western
World. Protest all the overly senti
mental adorableness and bring some
Sam Adams and a 12-gauge.
Every time...
Your favorite indie-pop rock
song starts playing in the background



BEFORE Cheer up, emo kid You should have a beer. Or two At Flicks.
Don't give me that face. . . no, don't start crying. . .


AFTER: Woo, college! Beer: Helping college students get laid, one pitcher
at a time. And how!
Getting tanked with Harry Potter

(such as Iron and Wine's "Such Great
1 leights") — Sing along, emo kid.
Natalie Portman joins the rest of
the world in acting like the last couple
"Star Wars" movies didn't happen —
Toss back a can and curse George
I .ucas.
Harold and Kumar go to
White Castle
Another film about Jersey twenty
somethings who smoke out in subur
bia; only now. they're ethnic. Find
some Asian-import beers (may we

suggest pairing Tiger beer with Indian
Kingfisher, to account for both charac
ters) and watch the national melting
pot overflow with high-larity.
Every time...
You feel culturally empowered by
the multi-ethnic spirit which this film
embodies: Drink proudly.
You feel let down by use of said
multi-ethnic spirit to recycle used pot
head jokes: Drink forlornly and look
for your bong. (Kidding.)
The Bourne Supremacy

This movie is fast. People run
everywhere and talk to four people at
once, and the editor cuts it like an ac
celerated Jackson Pollock acid trip.
Speed yourself up and buy some Bac
ardi 151: A full night's drinking in
every shot!
Every time...
You realize that Jason Bourne is
really just Will Hunting with attitude
and great box office appeal: Drink to
Matt Damon's success.
Julia Stiles acts like she knows
what she's talking about: Rent "Down
to You." Burn it. Make a flaming shot.

drink responsibly ... then play our
game and get hammered!
The Manchurian Candidate
Like the original, only without
humor and interesting political com
mentary. In the lame-knockoff spir
it, grab a Rolling Rock Green Light:
like the original, only low-carb. And
castrated!
Every time...
You swear Denzel Washington
had exactly the same rebel-maver
ick-outcast lines and action se
quences in "John Q." "The Siege,"
"Courage Under Fire," "Crimson
Tide" (wait, every movie that he's
been in): Drink.
Someone delivers a scathing line
about corrupt American politics and
how awesome it is to be rich and evil:
Hum "America the Beautiful"
through your tears and finish the case.
Alien Vs. Predator

It's not that
"AvP" — as
the movie nick
named itself, is
a bad movie;
it's just the
worst movie
ever made.
Steal keg beer
from a frat
party so you
don't waste any
money when

you throw your drink at the screen.
Every time...
You notice the lack of Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Sigourney Weaver
and anyone who could out-act a
stick-figure: Drink.
The creepy sexual tension be
tween the lead actress and the lead
Predator almost results in the grodiest
hook-up ever: Ponder the true dan

ger of beer goggles and shot-gun
one.
Collateral
A movie with evocative visuals,
tense violence, good dialogue, fine
acting and a final act noteworthy
for its lack of any of the above. For
that really disappointing, almost
perfect-except-for-the-milky-af-
tertaste vibe, concoct a White
Russian.
Every time...
Tom Cruise makes you wish
you could pull off gray hair so
badassly: Sip enviously.

Jada Pinkett Smith's lack of tal
ent depresses you and reminds you
of those awful Matrix sequels: Chug
through the pain.
Harry Potter and the
Prisoner of A/kahan

The year's best three-quel gets
props for livening up the till-now
mediocre franchise with some new
blood (director Alfonso Cuaron also
made the foreign sex-stravaganza
"Y Tu Mama Tambien"). Grab a
Miller Lite, the "Comeback King of
Beers," and deuce it with some New
castle for that proper British flavor.

Every time...
A famous and prestigious British
actor / actress who is probably most fa
mous for acting in Shakespearean
plays and has won lots of Oscars ap
pears for two seconds in a funny "wiz
arding'getup: Drink.
Someone calls Harry Potter '"Air
ray Paw-ah" (those kooky Brits!):
Drink 'till you grow an accent.
Garden State
A movie about quirky characters
doing quirky things in New Jersey,
the quirky capital of the Western
World. Protest all the overly senti
mental adorableness and bring some
Sam Adams and a 12-gauge.
Every time...
Your favorite indie-pop rock
song starts playing in the background



BEFORE Cheer up, emo kid You should have a beer. Or two At Flicks.
Don't give me that face. . . no, don't start crying. . .


AFTER: Woo, college! Beer: Helping college students get laid, one pitcher
at a time. And how!
Getting tanked with Harry Potter

(such as Iron and Wine's "Such Great
1 leights") — Sing along, emo kid.
Natalie Portman joins the rest of
the world in acting like the last couple
"Star Wars" movies didn't happen —
Toss back a can and curse George
I .ucas.
Harold and Kumar go to
White Castle
Another film about Jersey twenty
somethings who smoke out in subur
bia; only now. they're ethnic. Find
some Asian-import beers (may we

suggest pairing Tiger beer with Indian
Kingfisher, to account for both charac
ters) and watch the national melting
pot overflow with high-larity.
Every time...
You feel culturally empowered by
the multi-ethnic spirit which this film
embodies: Drink proudly.
You feel let down by use of said
multi-ethnic spirit to recycle used pot
head jokes: Drink forlornly and look
for your bong. (Kidding.)
The Bourne Supremacy

This movie is fast. People run
everywhere and talk to four people at
once, and the editor cuts it like an ac
celerated Jackson Pollock acid trip.
Speed yourself up and buy some Bac
ardi 151: A full night's drinking in
every shot!
Every time...
You realize that Jason Bourne is
really just Will Hunting with attitude
and great box office appeal: Drink to
Matt Damon's success.
Julia Stiles acts like she knows
what she's talking about: Rent "Down
to You." Burn it. Make a flaming shot.
112 or those of you who like watch
ing four-month-old movies in a
crowded auditorium and desperate
ly want to combine that activity with
legitimate, Intermission-approved
alcoholism, we bring you the unoffi
cial, MPAA-approved FLiCKS
drinking game, complete with the
audience-tested drink of choice for
each movie this quarter. 1 ley kids,
drink responsibly ... then play our
