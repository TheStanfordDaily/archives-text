# 'Opposite of Sex' neither sucks nor blows, arouses without climaxing
## 
### MERRITT FORREST BAER INTERMISSION WRITER 
Let's face it — sex sells. And it's
never been better than at the Magic
Theatre's production of "The Opposite
of Sex." This new, trendy production is
an adaptation of the 1998 film (starring
Christina Ricci) by the same title. Both
sexy and hip, "The Opposite of Sex"
follows Dedee fruit (the incomparable
Kerry Butler) as she tears across the
country, flying high with a sarcastic wit
that defines our generation and bring
ing an all-star cast from New York
along for the ride.
With a tone that brings to mind
"Urinetown" and its sassy off-Broad
way counterparts, "Sex" gleefully at
tacks love, lust and everything in be
tween. As the omniscient narrator,
Dedee epitomizes a trashy 16-year-old

delinquent. Breaking the fourth wall
(and admitting it), she gives us her side
of everything, as well as the evening's
only good dialogue.
Butler, who can belt out notes with
the best of them (as she's done in
Broadway's "Hairspray" and "Little
Shop of 1 iorrors"), gives the most tan
talizing performance of the show. Her
song "Rub a Little Lotion" is proof
enough of her expertise in musical
phrasing and as a vocal powerhouse. In
fact, "Sex" really only flies when she's at
center stage. Without her. the produc
tion loses its spark and sputters along.
Directed by Robert Jess Roth
(from Broadway's overstuffed "Beau
ty and the Beast"), the show under
stands the confines of the black box
theater and embraces them. With a
pop score by Douglas Cohen that
sounds a great deal like a William Finn

musical, "The Opposite of Sex" pre
sents itself as "the spunky little musical
that could." Unfortunately, the script
doesn't hold up its end of the bargain.
The simple and obvious dialogue often
makes its performers seem diminutive
in scale, bringing down Broadway stars
in the process. Thankfully, Cohen's
score is often interwoven throughout
the scenes, salvaging what could have
been a rather messy flaw.
Along Dedee's route, she meets her
half-brother Bill (John Bolton), his
boyfriend Matt whom she seduces
(David Burtka), John's dead lover's
sister (Karen Ziemba) and the sheriff
who falls in love with her (Jeff Mc-
Carthy). If that sounded confusing,
don't worry —it was. Tony Winner

a role that forces her to act grumpy for
about three-fourths of the show. When
she is finally united with Tony nominee
Jeff McCarthy for their love duet, the
show achieves a truly beautiful mo
ment, but getting there is more than dif
ficult.
David Burtka — who was excellent
in last year's Broadway production,
"Gypsy" — gives a finely nuanced pet -
formance, beautifully portrayed in the
song "A Normal 1 .ife" when he strug
gles with his sexuality.
I lowever. the show really only soars
when Kerry Butler is back at the wheel.

The young star really steals the show
with its best songs (including the mem
orable "I've Got News for You" and
hysterical "Dead Ex-I.over"). She is a
shining example of hope for the future
of musical theatre and a superb way to
kick oil a very prominent theatrical
season in the Bay Area — with no
fewer than three shows expected to
reach New York at the end of their run.
Knowing this, the producers have
put Butler in charge of their dreams to
reach the Great While Way, and in
doing so, have given themselves a good
shot at getting there.
