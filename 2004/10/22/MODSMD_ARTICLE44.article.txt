## Majoring in Rockstar Studies Part One: 'HORSING' around 
### BONNIE JOHNSON INTERMISSION WRITER 
They appear in fanzines; they tour inces
santly; they sleep on my couch. Who are these
mysterious stars of the underground? Stanford
grads.
It's a little known fact that rock lives here at
Stanford and that at least a few here live to
rock. A couple of my recently-graduated
friends have pursued their music like the crazy
folks they are and made it in their respective
scenes thanks to distinctive styles and a whole
lot of hard work. This week; HORSE the
Band.
"HORSE the Band, bitch" reads the T-shirt
at their shows. It's exactly the right sentiment
for my friend Davis' music, although you
would never guess it from his soft-spoken way.
David Isen, better known as "Davis" to his
friends here at Stanford, graduated last year
and has since been working full time on his
music with HORSE the Band.
HORSE signed to Pluto Records while
Davis was still here at Stanford, and the band
released its debut, "R. Borlax," not long after
he graduated. The band, of which Davis is the
lead guitarist, has been tirelessly touring in
North America and Europe since.
Comprised of five dudes from California
and Utah. HORSE the Band plays a unique
form of metal called "Nintendocore."
HORSE is actually the world's only Ninten
docore band: The members invented the
term themselves and have emphatically re

fused requests to share the genre with even
the most respectful aspiring soundalikes.
This is not Miniboss-style Mario theme cov
ers; this is hardcore with some serious synth
from that most snubbed of rock instruments:
the keyboard.
I went to see Davis with HORSE in Boston
back in August, where they played with Bleed-

ing Kansas. It was a
true hardcore show:
raw, rude and packed
with sweaty fifteen
year olds. Hanging
out with the guys af
terwards, I talked to
them about life as
DIY heroes while
they ate every last
thing in my fridge.
Apparently I ruined
Davis' cred by re
vealing his Stanford
identity to the
British music press in
a review I wrote in
London: The band's
official bio says that
four of the five mem-

bers have belonged to street gangs.
"You blew my cover, dude," he told me
while polishing off my housemates' leftovers.
"Everyone knows now." Sorry, man.
INTERMISSION: So you guys have had a
pretty rough touring schedule?

HORSE: Yeah, our shows have been really
close together, more than usual. It's hectic, es
pecially right now. We had a fire in the van a
few days ago when we were playing in Maine,
and we had to leave it up there because me
chanics in Maine don't work on Sundays. So
we had to drive a rental car down here, and to
morrow we have to drive back up to Maine and

get the van so we can
drive it to Pennsylva
nia to play tomorrow
night before we
leave for the UK the
next morning.
INT: Have you guys
had any trouble with
border crossings?
HORSE: When we
crossed into Canada,
they confiscated our
potato gun, some
mace and a pipe.
Dave had really
sketchy looking ID
that was falling apart,
and they didn't want

to let him into the country.
INT: Have you guys had any particularly spe
cial shows on this tour?
HORSE: We played the Hellfest in New Jer
sey: It's like the Woodstock of hardcore. It

was funny, "cause we're kind of the oddballs of
the scene.
INT: What have you guys been eating on the
road?
HORSE: Poutine is the best. It's the Canadi
an treat. It's made out of fries and cheese
curds or something. In Pennsylvania, there's a
place where they have six-pound hamburgers.
And in Mexico, we had these huge sausages.
They were tasty, but they were pretty ques
tionable.
INT: How was Mexico?
HORSE: Awesome! They think we're like the
Backstreet Boys there! We're national heroes
in Mexico. Next time, we're going to do a full
tour there.
INT: What do you miss most right now?
HORSE: Northern California.
INT: What would you like to tell readers of
The Stanford Daily?
HORSE: You can say that I'm using my Stan
ford education ... Sometimes I make spread
sheets in Excel.
HORSE the Hand will play in San Francisco on
Nov. 13, probably. Stay tuned for part two of
this series next week on The Mae Shi.
