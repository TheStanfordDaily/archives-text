# Bad rock 'Mos Def' initely does not make for good hip-hop
## 
### MATT SMITH INTERMISSION WRITER 
With his first two full-length albums — the
Talib Kweli collaboration "Black Star" and
the solo "Black on Both Sides" — Mos Def es
tablished himself as one of hip-hop's most
promising rising talents. He was to become the
new leader of the native tongue style, which
emphasizes thought and social consciousness
over the "glamorous," violent, sex-driven
gangsta culture that so often is thought of as
definitive of the genre.
He offered an alternative to the Puff Dad
dies and 50 Cents of the music scene, serving
up hip-hop at its best — relevant, meaningful
and artfully crafted. Five years later, his
sophomore effort has a whole lot of expecta
tions to live up to.
High expectations are why "The New Dan
ger" is such a disappointment. Mos Def's new
album is solid, with several high points, but is

just another one of the many rap-rock hybrid
albums released in recent years
One problem is the "hip-hop" definition of
the album. Whereas once Def often mixed
genres while sticking to the hip-hop roots that
propelled him to success, he oversteps on
"Danger," creating an album that is more
generic rock than thoughtful hip-hop. Lyrics
lack poignancy, beats are standard and instru
mentals too often take center stage — without
the strength to carry the music.
What is frustrating is how often glimpses of
success are mixed with terrible failures. "Ghet
to Rock," for example, seems to be what hap
pens when Defs vision succeeds — the low,
pounding drum and subtle background guitar
make for the best non-hip-hop song on the
album. It's unfortunate that the song is sand
wiched in between two songs that edge more
towards rock, "Freaky Black Greetings" and
"Zimzallabim," both of which feature lacklus
ter, generic instrumental that are more indica

tive of a low quality rock album than the work
of one of hip-hop's most promising artists.
"Blue Black Jack" mixes it up with some
repetitive and unoriginal blues, while "The
Panties" is a cross between mediocre reggae and
terrible Marvin Gaye, making fora song that's
just plain awful. Much of the album is plagued
by similar problems because Mos Def strays too
far from hip-hop into these other genres. Unable
to balance the mixture of styles, his songs ulti
mately suffer because they aim too high. "War"
is the album's most prominent attempt at politi
cal statement but offers little insight and focuses
more on raw sound than lyrical intellect.
Despite its shortcomings, that's not to say
that "The New Danger" is a waste of an album.
It simply goes through the motions of an aver
age, unremarkable album, which is extremely
disappointing given the artist.
When it works, though, oh it works — "Sun
shine," with samples from 60's classic "Aquar
ius," and "Sex, Love, and Money" provide

much-needed glimpses of the talent of the old
Mos Def, and "Champion Requiem" succeeds
at being a catchy power-anthem. There's just too
much going on in other areas of the album to
help these songs amount to something special.
"The New Danger" is a bit of a curiosity. Oc
casionally, a talented hip-hop artist will emerge
out of the crowd. All too often, however, that
artist abandons his own work in favor of other
styles. Nobody can blame Mos Def for wanting
to branch out into new and different genres, but
his attempt to do so through this album proves
to be detrimental to his work.
The depth, relevance and lyricism that he
used to champion are lost, replaced by hollow
sound. It's not that it's a terrible hip-hop
album — it's just not really a hip-hop album
at all. And with "The New Danger," Mos Def
has officially passed on the torch of the Na
tive Tongue collective. It's up to Talib Kweli
to carry on the hip-hop virtues of lyricism and
socio-politicism for now.
