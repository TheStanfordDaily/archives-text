# You might have a 'Grudge' if you actually pay for this movie

### FARIS MOHIUDDIN INTERMISSION JAPANOPHILE 
Remember when terrified Japan
ese women scurried about the streets
of Tokyo trying to escape from
C iodzilla? Those were the days, right?
Oh, but times they are a-changin' —
now blonde hotties scurry about the
dank halls of haunted abodes to es
cape ... ferocious Asian women. Fi
nally, racial equality in Hollywood.
Unfortunately, much like the 50-
gazillion God/ilia & Co. movies that
gleefully spawned from the original,
"The Grudge" relies almost exclu
sively on the same premise and identi
cal tropes from its older and marked
ly superior predecessor. Even if "The
Ring" / "Ringu" made you wet your
self, "The Grudge" still falls short
even as an imitation.
Pick an element, any element —
basically every memorable detail
from its Japanese predecessor has
been replicated and then watered
down in"The Grudge." Sinister
phone calls foreshadow impending
doom, grainy videos capture the
specter of the undead and creepy kids
howl. Throw in an attractive blonde
with a penchant for sleuthing, a sup
pressed murder and, oh yes, one real
ly pissed off Japanese lady. Sound fa
miliar? It should, because it was made
in IWB and then remade three years
ago. Good job, Columbia Pictures.

"The Grudge" spans a series of years
as a gruesome murder precipitates an
endless cycle of supernatural dysfunc
tion. We meet Karen Davis (Sarah
Michelle Gellar), a precocious youn
gun studying abroad in Japan while

providing social services
for the elderly on the side.
All is peachy until Karen
enters a mysterious home
to replace a missing former
care taker... Then the fun
begins.
You know, juxtaposi
tion is all the rage nowa
days. In some cases, this
ADD-style narrative adds
much-needed depth to a
plolline; in other cases, the
editor was probably just
feeling lazy. Thankfully,
"The Grudge" employs
fragmented plot lines to its
advantage. Nevertheless,
this time-hopping plot ve
hicle ultimately proves su
perfluous given that the
"revelation" becomes
blazingly obvious after five
minutes.
Undeniably, the film is

technically solid. The visuals and
score more than adequately enhance
the suspense. In fact, the throbbing
bass and shrieking violins mask the
lack of substantive scares.
Sarah Michelle Gellar delivers a

performance on par with the rest of
her consummate acting career. Was
that meant as a compliment? "Scooby
Doo," anyone? Other than Gellar,
the other characters exist solely to ad
vance the plot — and by that, I mean

never get more than ten minutes on
screen before they're killed. Hence,
there's no character development;
the supporting characters are but
mere monster fodder over the course
of the film.

The film's redundancy is only ex
acerbated when none of the scenes
match the ghastly visuals and sus
penseful twists of "The Ring." You
never actually see anyone get killed.
It usually goes a little something

like this: (Insert character
here) follows a mysterious
noise only to discover a
ghastly reminder of the past
catastrophe. Something
otherworldly accosts them;
they stare at it fora few sec
onds — then cut to the next
scene. No footage of actual
attack and death. Repeat
this a dozen times over the
course of the film. Next
thing you know, the closing
credits are rolling, and
you're being ushered out of
the theater. "The Grudge"is
really just a soft-core ver
sion of the Ring. If NBC
had released "The Ring,"
this is the rip off Fox would
come out with four days
later.
That cursed girl from
"The Ring" sure was freaky
looking, and you didn't

CJ , J
even see her face 'til the end.
In contrast, "The Grudge" opts to
make the lace of its living-impaired
antagonist disturbingly prominent.
Unfortunately, the costume peo
ple failed to make her scary — the

big. bright-eyed, deadpan stare and
gaping mouth evokes more laughs
than gasps. To put it bluntly, she just
looks blazed out of her mind. You've
totally seen people with the same ex
pression wandering outside EBF.
You know how some people yell,
"Girl, don't you be goin' alone into
that abandoned cabin built on a
cemetery during a full moon on the
10th anniversary of the tribal mas
sacre"? Dumbass decisions run
amok throughout the movie: Expect
many "Stupid bitch, run away!" com
mands from the audience.
Cellar's character could have
high-tailed it out of the Pacific Rim
after her first encounter with the
ghost next door. Of course, that
would make the movie about eight
minutes long. Beyond that point, any
and all effort on her part to decipher
the mystery inside the house is entire
ly without purpose or impetus. Cel
lar's Kate seems to probe the undead
apparently out of sheer boredom in a
foreign land.
This won't be the last pseudo
"Ring" to poke its smelly, decaying
head into the world cinema — but
maybe, just maybe, future install
ments will change something. Hell,
even Godzilla movies threw in new
characters now and then. I'm calling
it now: "Dead Chick in the Closet
versus Mothra" is going to rock the
box office like no other.
