## Coming out in style: tee shirts add color to national celebration 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO 
Although there was also food and
dancing, the main reason students
gathered on the second floor of the
Fire Truck House last night was to
transform white tee shirts into color
ful statements of their sexuality.
The shirts are on display today in
White Plaza as a part of Stanford's
National Coming Out Day celebra
tion, which begins at noon.
The theme for National Coming
Out Day 2004 is "Inside Out, Out
Inside," which places a special em
phasis on the importance of "Com
ing out to yourself â€” facing and em
bracing all aspects of who you are."
Sophomore Katherine Roubos,
the visibility events coordinator for
the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and
Transgender Community Resource
Center, said the event will be open
to everyone. The Stanford March
ing Band will perform throughout
the celebration, and pre-recorded
coming out stories will be playing
for students to listen and respond to.
"I didn't even know there was a
National Coming Out Day prior to
coming to Stanford." said freshman

Sarah Nahm, a self-proclaimed
"straight ally" who attended last
night's event. "Back in Alabama we
don't do this sort of thing, so it's nice
to be able to get really close to peo
ple in the community."
According to the Human Rights
Campaign Web site. National Com
ing Out Day is an international
event that first began on Oct. 11,
1987, when half a million people
marched on Washington D.C. for
gay and lesbian rights.
"There are two big reasons, in
my mind, for coming out," said
sophomore Hammad Ahmed, one
of two undergraduate mentors orga
nizing the LGBT-CRC advising
program. "One is that living in
America, in modern society, where
people have homosexual desires ...
coming out creates a psychological
ease [for them]. The second purpose
is that it gives something back to the
gay community."
"Within the gay community, it
creates support," said senior
Annabelle Valdivia. "(Coming out]
is a very courageous thing to do. 1
