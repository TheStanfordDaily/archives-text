## Coming out in style: tee shirts add color to national celebration 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO 
Although there was also food and
dancing, the main reason students
gathered on the second floor of the
Fire Truck House last night was to
transform white tee shirts into color
ful statements of their sexuality.
The shirts are on display today in
White Plaza as a part of Stanford's
National Coming Out Day celebra
tion, which begins at noon.
The theme for National Coming
Out Day 2004 is "Inside Out, Out
Inside," which places a special em
phasis on the importance of "Com
ing out to yourself — facing and em
bracing all aspects of who you are."
Sophomore Katherine Roubos,
the visibility events coordinator for
the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and
Transgender Community Resource
Center, said the event will be open
to everyone. The Stanford March
ing Band will perform throughout
the celebration, and pre-recorded
coming out stories will be playing
for students to listen and respond to.
"I didn't even know there was a
National Coming Out Day prior to
coming to Stanford." said freshman

Sarah Nahm, a self-proclaimed
"straight ally" who attended last
night's event. "Back in Alabama we
don't do this sort of thing, so it's nice
to be able to get really close to peo
ple in the community."
According to the Human Rights
Campaign Web site. National Com
ing Out Day is an international
event that first began on Oct. 11,
1987, when half a million people
marched on Washington D.C. for
gay and lesbian rights.
"There are two big reasons, in
my mind, for coming out," said
sophomore Hammad Ahmed, one
of two undergraduate mentors orga
nizing the LGBT-CRC advising
program. "One is that living in
America, in modern society, where
people have homosexual desires ...
coming out creates a psychological
ease [for them]. The second purpose
is that it gives something back to the
gay community."
"Within the gay community, it
creates support," said senior
Annabelle Valdivia. "(Coming out]
is a very courageous thing to do. 1

that's only one example."
"It's also important for non-les
bians and non-gays," she continued.
"It gives them a way to be informed."
Some students said they felt con
cerned that society has not yet be
come tolerant enough to make
events like this one unnecessary.
"There shouldn't be a need for
National Coming Out Day — I
don't think there should be a specif
ic day to celebrate their sexuality,"
said freshman Chris Elmore. "It
should be a complete non-issue."
But many students, such as fresh
man Allegra Shum, said they believe
National Coming Out Day will ad
vance the struggle for acceptance of
all sexualities.
"I'm excited that there is a cele

bration of being queer." said Shum.
"It shows we're making a step for
ward in society."
Junior Rosabelle Oribello said
the event is still an important symbol
even though it does not live up to its
name for many "closeted" students.
"It's not about making people
come out, it's about visibility," she
said. "1 don't think anyone actually
comes out, but it brings them one
step closer."
Roubus said that no one should
feel pressured to come out just be
cause it's National Coming Out
Day.
"No one thing is going to give you
all the courage and prep to come out
or make you decide that now's the
time." she said. "It's a series of
events, and I hope this is one of
them."
