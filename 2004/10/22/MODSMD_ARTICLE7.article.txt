# Catholic voters courted on campus
## 
### BEA SANFORD 
Those who doubt the influence of
Catholic voters should talk to Politi
cal Science Prof. Luis Fraga, who
called the group "extremely impor
tant in today's election" at a forum
hosted by the Catholic Community
at Stanford on Tuesday.
There has been a flurry of at
tempts to reach out to Catholics on
campus over the past few weeks. In
addition to Tuesday's talk, titled
"Election 2004: Issues for
Catholics," some students sent out
mass e-mails to dorm lists to inform
fellow Catholics on certain election
related issues.
Meanwhile, also on Tuesday,
Stanford Students for Life spon
sored a full-page ad in The Daily de
nouncing embryonic stem cell re
search.
Fraga said that Catholics hold a
large amount of "regional power" in
swing states such as Ohio. Pennsyl
vania, Wisconsin, Missouri and
Florida, where they could tip the
state one way or another.
But the Catholic vote is anything
but decided. Fraga says that
Catholics "are bombarded by mes
sages designed more to influence
them than to educate them."
The New York Times reported
last week that some Catholic bishops
are trying to influence the election.
For example, five U.S. bishops is
sued statements last May saying, in
effect, that voting fora pro-choice
politician would be a grave sin.
Father Patrick Laßelle, director
of campus ministry, said that some of
these bishops had ulterior motives
for making such statements.
"There's only a half dozen bish
ops who spoke out, and they had bad
reasons," Laßelle said. "In some
cases there was a real theological
commitment, but mainly it was am
bition and fear and anxiety over fi
nancial pressure. Conservative lay
communities with money were dic
tating policy."
Foruin offers differing perspectives
Rather than receiving a clear dic
tum on how Catholics should vote,
those who went to the forum on
Tuesday night heard five Catholic
panelists who offered fundamentally
different viewpoints.
Steven Cortright, a professor of
philosophy at St. Mary's College, an
nounced that he would not be voting

for Sen. John Kerry.
"We have to cohere to a set of
principles as a church even if the
world doesn't," Cortright said.
Catherine Wolff, who chairs
Stanford's Catholic Community Pas
toral Council, criticized President
George W. Bush's "pre-emptive
war" and said that Kerry would actu
ally do more to promote "a culture
of life" than Bush.
After the forum ended, some stu
dents said they wished they had
heard more specific commentary on
each of the issues.
Freshman Nydia Cardenas said
she was "not really helped" by the
panel, because the panelists "didn't
talk about where the teaching of the
church came into play" in politics.
Some see issues as
'non-negotiable'
Other Catholics do not see any
gray areas when it comes to voting in
this year's election. Sophomore
Dennis Adams sent out an e-mail to
several dorm lists last week with the
subject line, "Calling all Catholics."
The e-mail included a link to a video
clip that advised Catholics to cast
their votes based on five "non-nego
tiable issues": abortion, euthanasia,
stem-cell research, human cloning
and gay marriage.
Adams had originally asked La-
Belle for permission to send the e
mail to the entire Catholic communi
ty, but Laßelle denied his request.
Laßelle said that he "didn't feel it
was appropriate" to send such an e
mail through the Catholic list.
"I decided to send it... because
as a Catholic, my responsibility is to
help others grow in that faith, and
part of that faith involves an active
political life," Adams said.
While Adams said he felt called
to spur other Catholics to action,
many disagreed with his point of
view and methods.
"As expected, I had a lot of angry
e-mails written back, people saying I
was ignorant and biased, that I'm fo
cusing on only a few issues that are
clearly anti-Kerry; a lot of people
saying I was out of line in saying you
can only vote fora pro-life candi
date," he said. "However. I had a few
e-mails praising me for being coura
geous, for voting according to my
faith and not to cultural relativism."
Sophomore Annie Osburn, a
Catholic in Adams' dorm, said that
Adams could have informed voters

by other means.
"I think it would have been more
appropriate for him to offer a place
for discussion rather than immedi
ately coming out with this e-mail say
ing this is how Catholics should
vote," she said.
The connection between
faith and voting
While the teachings of the
Catholic Church may play a big part
in influencing how Catholics decide
to vote, other secular organizations
champion many of the same social
values that the Catholic Church up
holds.
Princeton University Pro-Life,
which has no official religious affilia

tion, released full-page ads in many
collegiate newspapers, including
The Daily, across the country last
Tuesday on the ethics of stem cell re
search.
According to sophomore George
Capps. a member of Stanford Stu
dents For Life, the Princeton group
contacted Stanford Students For
Life and asked for their help in spon
soring the ad in The Daily.
Capps said that many of SSFL's
positions on election issues coincide
with those of Catholics.
"|SSFL does] not endorse any
candidates, but we encourage voters
to give life-related issues the priority
they deserve and to vote for candi
dates who will best fight for the dig-

nity of all human life, including the
weakest members of our society. We
are opposed to abortion, embryonic
stem cell research, euthanasia and
the death penalty."
Although not all Catholics agree
on whom to vote for, faith often
plays a big part in how they make
their decision.
"You can't separate religion and
voting at all — it affects everything.
It doesn't give me a stance either
Democratic or Republican, but it
makes me take a stance." said fresh
man Maggie Biel.
