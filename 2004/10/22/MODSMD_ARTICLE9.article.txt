### DAVID HERBERT DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Environmental Initiative
has received two multi-million-dollar dona
tions that officials expect to he the first of
many fora burgeoning new interdisci
plinary environmental program.
Stanford supporters Melvin and Joan
Lane donated $3.5 million, a gift that will be
matched with another $2 million contribu
tion from the William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation.
The Lanes' donation is the first multi-mil
lion-dollar commitment to the Stanford En
vironmental Initiative, a new campus-wide
push to solve global economic problems.
An important part of the initiative was
the establishment of the Stanford Institute
for the Environment last April. The insti
tute, intended to be a hub for environmen

tal work at the University, is responsible for
research, teaching and outreach in environ
mental and energy issues.
According to Civil and Environmental
Engineering Prof. Jeffrey Koseff, the
Lanes' donation sets an important prece
dent.
"This institute is in its infancy, so a dona
tion like this sends a message that what this
institute is doing is important," he said. "It
also gives us the resources and opportunity
to bring scholars to Stanford."
Half of the donations will go to create a
new professorship focused on interdisci
plinary environmental studies, said Law
Prof. Barton "Buzz" Thompson. The other
half will create a senior scholar position
within the Stanford Institute for the Envi
ronment.
"This senior scholar will provide core
leadership of SIE," Thompson said.

That the donation came from the Lanes
was particularly satisfying, Thompson
added, because Melvin Lane "has a history
of helping solve major environmental issues
in the Bay Area and the [California] coast."
"The confidence they are show ing is con
firming for us what we are doing." he said.
Thompson and Koseff both expressed
excitement about the future of SIE.
"I hope and expect that what SIE will be
doing is helping to lead the best environ
mental program in the country," Thompson
said. "That's where I expect us to be in five
years."
Koseff was even more specific about his
long-term plans for the institute.
"I see 200 graduate students and 50
scholars developing working solutions to
environmental challenges that will funda
mentally change the world." he said.
"That's what we dream about."
