### MEGAN WATKINS 
Alumni and members of the Law
School community gathered in the
Main Quad on Friday evening to
formally install Larry Kramer as the
12th dean of the Law School.
Kramer, the former assistant law
dean of New York University, re
places Kathleen Sullivan for the
post.
In his speech. Kramer named the
Law School's small size and the large
number of loyal alumni as the
strengths of the school. However, he
pointed to several areas of improve
ment that he intends to focus on, in
cluding fostering stronger academic
ties between the Law School and the
University at large.
Kramer said that many students
now choose to go after two degrees,
one in law and one in some other
specialty, and he described the chal
lenge of catering to changing stu
dent needs.
"Students want to know that
when they get to law school they will
have choices," lie said.
He explained that law is becom
ing more specialized and that many
students do not go on to practice
law.
"The education we are offering
remains partial and incomplete,"
Kramer said.
Kramer also suggested that the
Law School could better capitalize
on the opportunities that its small
size affords.
"We need to make better use of
the time we get with students." he
said.
With this challenge in mind.
Kramer stated the importance of
preserving the small community of
the Law School. He proposed that
instead of trying to accomplish
meeting the lull breadth of these

goals on its own, the Law School
should seek to leverage the
strength of the larger university.
Having discussed the chal
lenges to be faced within the
University. Kramer moved on to
address those that the world will
face in the coming years.
He noted that his generation
has created many problems re
lating to the environment, peace
and disease, among other issues.
He called for the community to
set aside its cynicism and take ac
tive responsibility.
"Business as usual will not get
the job done," he stated.
Friday's celebration began
with dinner and music, followed
by remarks from University
President John Hennessy,
Kramer and U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Stephen Breyer, who re
ceived his undergraduate degree
from Stanford in 1959.
Duane C. Quanini. Class of
1970, chairman of Sonnenschein,
Nath and Rosenthal LLP and
chair of the Stanford Law School
Board of Visitors, started the
evening's speeches by introduc
ing Hennessy.
Hennessy spoke of the time
and effort required for the dean
search and celebrated its results.
"What's next for our great
Law School and University?" he
asked.
He challenged attendees to
rethink the role of the Law
School while remaining inspired
by its past achievements. He de
scribed challenges to be ad
dressed in the field, including,
but not limited to, environmental
law and biomedical law.
Hennessy expressed his confi
dence in Kramer and his ability
to meet these challenges.
"He is both a great scholar
and a great teacher," Hennessy
said. "He is also someone who

understands the importance of
building a community."
When Kramer then took the
podium, he joked about Friday's
event being labeled an "installa
tion."
"You install a refrigerator,"
he said. "I'm not sure what that
says about this job!"
Kramer then turned to issues
of greater gravity. He acknowl
edged that there were many po
litical issues to address but that
he would focus the night's re
marks on the future of the Law
School.
"I believe so much in what we
decide to do as teachers and
scholars," Kramer said. "The
students we train can make a dif
ference in the world."
Breyer spoke first of his loyal
ty to Stanford, telling the audi
ence, "My heart is here."
Then he recalled the previous
deans and their accomplish
ments.
"These are the footsteps
you'll have to follow in,"he told
Kramer.
He distinguished between
the roles of lawyers, judges
and professors but empha
sized the importance of coop
eration to create and maintain
good laws.
"Law is about how people live
together," he said.
He asked the attendees to
consider what the lives of the
future men and women of law
will look like. He challenged
the community to make it a life
that gives lawyers the opportu
nity to be terrific professionals,
but also one with room for
their families and for their
communities.
In closing, Breyer addressed
Kramer with confidence.
"You'll rise to the occasion,"
he told him.

Alumni and members of the Law
School community gathered in the
Main Quad on Friday evening to
formally install Larry Kramer as the
12th dean of the Law School.
Kramer, the former assistant law
dean of New York University, re
places Kathleen Sullivan for the
post.
In his speech. Kramer named the
Law School's small size and the large
number of loyal alumni as the
strengths of the school. However, he
pointed to several areas of improve
ment that he intends to focus on, in
cluding fostering stronger academic
ties between the Law School and the
University at large.
Kramer said that many students
now choose to go after two degrees,
one in law and one in some other
specialty, and he described the chal
lenge of catering to changing stu
dent needs.
"Students want to know that
when they get to law school they will
have choices," lie said.
He explained that law is becom
ing more specialized and that many
students do not go on to practice
law.
"The education we are offering
remains partial and incomplete,"
Kramer said.
Kramer also suggested that the
Law School could better capitalize
on the opportunities that its small
size affords.
"We need to make better use of
the time we get with students." he
said.
With this challenge in mind.
Kramer stated the importance of
preserving the small community of
the Law School. He proposed that
instead of trying to accomplish
meeting the lull breadth of these

goals on its own, the Law School
should seek to leverage the
strength of the larger university.
Having discussed the chal
lenges to be faced within the
University. Kramer moved on to
address those that the world will
face in the coming years.
He noted that his generation
has created many problems re
lating to the environment, peace
and disease, among other issues.
He called for the community to
set aside its cynicism and take ac
tive responsibility.
"Business as usual will not get
the job done," he stated.
Friday's celebration began
with dinner and music, followed
by remarks from University
President John Hennessy,
Kramer and U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Stephen Breyer, who re
ceived his undergraduate degree
from Stanford in 1959.
Duane C. Quanini. Class of
1970, chairman of Sonnenschein,
Nath and Rosenthal LLP and
chair of the Stanford Law School
Board of Visitors, started the
evening's speeches by introduc
ing Hennessy.
Hennessy spoke of the time
and effort required for the dean
search and celebrated its results.
"What's next for our great
Law School and University?" he
asked.
He challenged attendees to
rethink the role of the Law
School while remaining inspired
by its past achievements. He de
scribed challenges to be ad
dressed in the field, including,
but not limited to, environmental
law and biomedical law.
Hennessy expressed his confi
dence in Kramer and his ability
to meet these challenges.
"He is both a great scholar
and a great teacher," Hennessy
said. "He is also someone who

understands the importance of
building a community."
When Kramer then took the
podium, he joked about Friday's
event being labeled an "installa
tion."
"You install a refrigerator,"
he said. "I'm not sure what that
says about this job!"
Kramer then turned to issues
of greater gravity. He acknowl
edged that there were many po
litical issues to address but that
he would focus the night's re
marks on the future of the Law
School.
"I believe so much in what we
decide to do as teachers and
scholars," Kramer said. "The
students we train can make a dif
ference in the world."
Breyer spoke first of his loyal
ty to Stanford, telling the audi
ence, "My heart is here."
Then he recalled the previous
deans and their accomplish
ments.
