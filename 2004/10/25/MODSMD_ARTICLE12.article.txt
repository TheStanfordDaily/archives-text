1985 — On Oct. 25, The Daily ran a
story on a controversy on the Hoover
Institution's political ties. Below is an
excerpt:
"Allegations oi political partisan
ship in the Hoover Institution and a
preliminary report on the funding
priorities of the University's $483
million Centennial Campaign high
lighted yesterday's meeting of the
Faculty Senate.
In remarks to the senate, English
Prof. Ron Rebholz challenged the
role of the Hoover Institution on
campus, saying that while the senate
has no authority to regulate Hoover,
the institution's policies directly im
pact the University.
'I realize the senate has no power
in any official way to change the re
lationship or get rid of Hoover, but 1
think we could (have more impact)
if we set our minds to it,' Rebholz
said.
In an Oct. 21 letter to the senate,
Rebholz claimed that 'overwhelm
ing evidence' exists "documenting
the political mission and activities of
the Hoover Institution.' That letter
was co-authored by Political Science
Prof. John Manley.
In their letter. Manley and Reb
holz charged that a recent senate re
port on Hoover/University relations
ignores the institution's political ac
tivities, which he said include ser
vices to conservative candidates and
attempts to influence public opin
ion."

1993 — On 0ct.25, The Daily ran a
story on students trying to control
their dreams. Below is an excerpt:
"Senior Jake Becker can fly.
Maybe not in real life, but he can fly
in his dreams — or rather his lucid
dreams.
Becker is founder of Lucid
Dreamers Unlimited: Exploring the
Real Holodeek Experience, a new
student group devoted to lucid
dreaming, a phenomenon in which
slumbering individuals are conscious
that they're dreaming.
"Lucid refers to the clarity of con
sciousness that dreamers experience
during their dreams,' Becker said.
Lucid dreams allow individuals to do
things in their dreams that are 'im
possible in real life' by essentially
letting them control their dreams.
And though the idea of lucid
dreaming may intimidate the inex
perienced dreamer, Becker encour
ages anyone interested to join the
club.
'If you want to explore a new
mental frontier, you can take acid or
lucid dream,' said junior Ben Rigby,
one club member.
Currently there are about eight
members in the club — several of
whom are still trying to achieve their
first lucid dream."
