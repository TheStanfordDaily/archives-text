# Playing it Straight
## Sources of inspiration: famous Stamos 
### 
It's hunting season. Job-hunting,
that is. It's an exciting time. Fun
for those who get to be jackasses
flaunting their offers; scary for us
who face the harrowing world of nine
to-fives, shameless crushes on the IT
girl and lonely nights spent wishing our
lives were half as exciting as FroSoCo
parties.
So that's why we've decided to pro
long our sad college careers another
year by deferring the real world with a
humdrum co-term. And though we
refuse to sympathize, empathize or syn
chronize with our classmates, we hope
to offer them some peace of mind, the
kind that

comes only
from knowing
that you have
more in com
mon with John
Stamos than
you might
think.
When peo
ple asked us
for advice in
the past, we
were caught
tongue-tied
like starry
eyed freshmen
under full
scale assault

from the descending (w)hordes of
drunken Pi Phis at Full Moon On the
Quad. But not anymore. We've finally
got a real "diamond in the rough" piece
of advice. And we definitely found it in
the real thick (billy goat) gruff rough.
With Hallow's Eve just around the
bend, we recently found ourselves talk
ing shop with Evan's little cousin Coop
er. Naturally, the topic of Halloween
costumes came up.
Lil' Coop took no time to declare suc
cinctly, positively and absolutely that he
would be dressing up as John Stamos
come the 31st. Stunned, dazed and
fazed, we prodded lil' Coop for answers:
'"Why in the world would you want to
dress up as Uncle Jesse for Halloween?"
Maybe a little extra "candy" will be
in order from all the 9-year-old girls
dressed up as Rebecca Romjin, but
then there aren't many of those, are
there? Actually, even Rebecca Romjin
knows a bad thing when she sees one.
She dropped Stamos like Will "Editor
in Chief" Oremus drops classes.
Really though, how in the world did
John Stamos become so famous and
successful? After a promising start on
the soap opera circuit, his career really
took off with Full House. And then it
flew so far away that no one really saw
him until his recent re-emergence on
some 10-10 phone plan advertisements.
So where's that nugget of consola
tion we promised, you ask? Where's
that silver "Stamos" lining in your Stan
ford raincloud?
Case in point and matter at hand:
Stamos must have done something to
get where he got, but we're not sure
what, and whatever he's so good at isn't
exactly what shone through in his semi
lustrous career. But if John Stamos was
able to be successful on apparently
marginal talents and looks, you defi
nitely have a shot at that dream career
of yours.
The fact is, despite a general social
ineptitude, there are a lot of genuinely
talented people at Stanford, and
though it doesn't always manifest itself
as more than surface "academic
prowess," most of us have plenty un
derlying all that.
It has more to do with who you real
ly are than what fits nicely beneath the
letterhead on your resume (specifical
ly, the fact that you went to Stanford).
We're confident that anybody who ac
tually knows John Stamos could list off
a million things that make the guy
amazing (we have probably already re
ceived hate-mail along these lines). So
in some ways, Stanford students are a
bit like John Stamos.
There's no shame in going to Stamos
University. He's successful; you will be
too. Plus, we'll be introducing some red
sweatshirts pretty soon that say Stamos
on them. Make sure to wear them on
the plane so everyone knows you're
headed back to Stamos.

pick between consulting and investment
hanking. Send him some recommenda

She dropped Stamos like Will "Editor
in Chief" Oremus drops classes.
Really though, how in the world did
John Stamos become so famous and
successful? After a promising start on
the soap opera circuit, his career really
took off with Full House. And then it
flew so far away that no one really saw
him until his recent re-emergence on
some 10-10 phone plan advertisements.
So where's that nugget of consola
tion we promised, you ask? Where's
that silver "Stamos" lining in your Stan
ford raincloud?
Case in point and matter at hand:
Stamos must have done something to
get where he got, but we're not sure
what, and whatever he's so good at isn't
exactly what shone through in his semi
lustrous career. But if John Stamos was
able to be successful on apparently
marginal talents and looks, you defi
nitely have a shot at that dream career
of yours.
The fact is, despite a general social
ineptitude, there are a lot of genuinely
talented people at Stanford, and
though it doesn't always manifest itself
as more than surface "academic
prowess," most of us have plenty un
derlying all that.
It has more to do with who you real
ly are than what fits nicely beneath the
letterhead on your resume (specifical
ly, the fact that you went to Stanford).
We're confident that anybody who ac
tually knows John Stamos could list off
a million things that make the guy
amazing (we have probably already re
ceived hate-mail along these lines). So
in some ways, Stanford students are a
bit like John Stamos.
There's no shame in going to Stamos
University. He's successful; you will be
too. Plus, we'll be introducing some red
sweatshirts pretty soon that say Stamos
on them. Make sure to wear them on
the plane so everyone knows you're
headed back to Stamos.
