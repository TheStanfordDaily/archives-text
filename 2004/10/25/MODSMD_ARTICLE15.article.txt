# SCBN reloaded...
## Stanford's student-run network revamped 
### MELISSA CHEE STAFF WRITER 
"We're giving SCBN an extreme
makeover," said Executive Produc
er Matt Dyer, a senior.
The Stanford Cardinal Broad
casting Network is a student-run
television station on-air 24 hours a
day on channel five.
But a combination of low view
ership and a stagnant flow of stu
dent-produced shows created an at
mosphere that left many students
saying, "What is SCBN?" And that
was only if they knew about the sta
tion.
"I've definitely heard about a
student-run TV station, but I've
never watched it or heard of anyone
watching it," said Corie Geballe, ju
nior.
This year SCBN's leadership
core plans on changing the stigma.
Their plan includes an overhaul of
station procedure and increased
student participation.
"Our goal is to build student
programming — we want people to
get excited to make and watch
shows on SCBN," Dyer said.
Last year there were ferwer stu
dent produced shows than there
had been in previous years. SCBN
was forced to use more prgram
ming from other sources such as
mtvU and to show movies.
"We got a special fees cut be
cause there weren't student shows
being produced," said sophomore
Reena Magsarili, SCBN's station
manager.
The funding cut means students
will not get reimbursed for produc
tion costs. In previous years, stu
dents could get reimbursed up to
$50 an episode.
"I think it's a good thing," Dyer

said. "There were pages of rules
and procedures to get reim
bursed. Now you're on your own,
so go ahead and get started."
Several student-produced
shows are in the works, including
a news program, a humor show
and a political discussion show.
The political discussion show
is set to film in mid-November.
"Think BET's Teen Summit'
comes to the Stanford campus,'
said Jamelia Morgan, junior and
co-creative director of the up
coming show.
Two show hosts will moderate
an audience discussion on an
issue like education reform or
the war in Iraq. A panel will fea
ture student experts and profes
sors to answer audience ques
tions.
"The idea is trying to get col
lege students interested in global
issues — we want to try to spice it
up a little," Morgan said. "We
want to give students a new
venue to talk about important is
sues."
Other new programming in
cludes Zilo TV, a New York
based group which offers ser
vices aimed at college students
and young adults. Programs in
clude behind-the-scenes movie
documentaries, music videos and
reality television and CSI
episodes. The station will contin
ue to air movies and mtvU.
"Our staple programming is
the movies we play — they range
from current movies that were

just released to classics," Magsarili
said.
On the production side, SCBN
offers its members a practical
hands-on experience.
"It's a way for students to get

firsthand experience in television
production, and it's a way for the
whole campus to be able to see their
work," she said.
It's also an outlet for student ex
pression. Magsarili said.

"This year there is a new group
of people that are hardcore about
the station, so we'll have to see if we
can find people that are hardcore
about making shows," Dyer said.
And by the end of the year-

Angela Henry, publicity manager
and sophomore, hopes people will
know the name SCBN.
"We want everyone to know
what channel five is and to know
that it is from Stanford," she said.
