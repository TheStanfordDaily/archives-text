## Editorial Ticket changes help students 
### 
Due to the large number of student com
plaints last year, the Stanford Athletics
Department is offering more ticket-pur
chasing options this year. They now sell
season tickets to men's football — including Big
Game — independent of tickets for other sporting
events. This sales adjustment has enabled students to
buy tickets exclusively fora whole season of football
and Big Game at a cost that is less than the price of a
single Big Game ticket.
The bundling adjustment is commendable be
cause it demonstrates the Athletic Department's
responsiveness to student demands. Bv offering
better sports packages, students now have the flex
ibility to go to Stanford's more popular sporting
events without having to pay for games that they do
not want to attend.
Accommodating students is the first step towards
increasing sporting attendance.

Unsigned editorials in this space represent the views of the members of The Daily's editorial hoard. The hoard consists
of six Daily opinions staffers and three community members at-large. Any signed columns and contributions
are the views of their respective writers and do not necessarily represent the views of the editorial board.

Because of the changes, students are no longer
hindered from attending football games because of
high costs.
Although last year's All AXE-cess pass cost $60
, it did not include Big Game or men's basketball.
At a cost of $99. the new All AXE-cess allows stu
dent to attend football and men's basketball. For an
additional 17 dollars, that package includes Big
Game.
Ticket sales so far this year indicate that students
like the changes. According to the Athletics Depart
ment, the sale of All AXE-cess passes has almost dou
bled in comparison to this time last fall, increasing
from 739 to approximately 1.600 passes sold.
Hopefully Stanford will regain the Axe on game
day against Cal. Regardless of the outcome, because
of the changes to ticket sales, the Athletics Depart
ment can definitely count on a more favorable Cardi
nal showing at sporting events this year.
