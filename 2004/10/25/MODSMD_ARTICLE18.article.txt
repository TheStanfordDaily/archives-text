## Attacks on Epstein were hypocritical 
### AHMED ASHRAF 
Nathan Mintz's article on the Ep
stein event was a riot of spectacular
inaccuracies ("Holocaust event rep
resentative of rising tide of anti-
Semitic rhetoric," Oct. 21 ). Mint/ei
ther has an unreliable memory or he
wrote his article long before attend
ing the talk, brimming expectantly
with assumptions on what exactly
would unfold.
Mint/, describes a rising tide of
anti-Semitism and thoughtfully at
tributes this to an 80-year-old Holo
caust survivor. Then he ponders
why anti-Semitism is the only toler
ated form of discrimination, deli
cately sidestepping the fact that pro-
Israel groups have brought racist,
anti-Muslim activists such as Daniel
Pipes to campus and ignoring the
post-Patriot Act environment in
which we all live today.
Arab-Americans and Muslims un
derstand "tolerated discrimination"
perfectly, thank you very much. The
now infamous Campustruth.org ads fi
asco was just one item in a long list.
No matter what side individuals
take on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

the Holocaust motto "never again"
still resonates. The campus truth ads
that were splashed across campus
newspapers this time last year ironical
ly could have been lifted from a Nazi
propaganda guidebook.
Palestinians, n< >t Jews, were the targets
that time, and that made it print-worthy.
The Holocaust, many hard line
pro-Israelis such as Mint/, assume,
can only serve its purpose when de
fending Israel, and for it to provide
any moral lesson with regards to the
Palestinians would be an indis
putable "insult."
In any case, it should be recognized
that Palestinians and all Arabs are
technically Semitic peoples, so any de
bate on anti-Semitism should equally
extend to them.
Mint/ also sees fit to use the actions
of individuals to pronounce judgment
on organizations such as the Palestini
an Solidarity Movement. Were the
same standards applied to those at the
Hedy Epstein event, we would have a
few more "terror" organizations on
our peaceful campus.
The malicious disrespect of some
individuals during I ledy Epstein's talk
was nothing short of thuggery, intend-

Ed solely to disrupt the event and in
timidate the guest speaker. As to
whether MSAN events foster dialogue
and understanding, I'd ask Mintz
whether Stanford-Israel Alliance
events invite such values.
The SIA-sponsored Limnor Livnat
talk, for example, was more of a pep
rally for fiery Likud supporters than a
meaningful discussion on prospects for
peace. Livnat, herself a hard right
winger, seemed like a voice of relative
moderation at the event.
The questions asked of Epstein, in
contrast, represented a balanced vari
ety of opinions, something sadly lack
ing in most events sponsored by SI A.
Mintz's desperate condemnation of
the International Solidarity Move
ment does not even deserve a re
sponse. Had Mintz actually attended
the Hedy Epstein event before his arti
cle was written, he would have been
able to discuss the event itself instead
of throwing around baseless accusa
tions and allegations for most of his ar
ticle.
