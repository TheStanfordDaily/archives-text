# Op-Ed
## Epstein victimized by a harsh audience 
### SEGUN AMEN 
Nathan Mintz's article, ("Holo
caust event representative of rising
tide of anti-Semitic rhetoric," Oct. 22),
is full of misrepresentations and false
charges. Epstein didn't compare Is
raelis to Nazis nor voice any rhetoric
comparing the initial stages of the
Holocaust to the situation in the occu
pied West Bank and Gaza.
In fact, she remarked that she docs
not like to compare in general, and
would not do so in her speech, which
was merely a presentation of her expe
riences in the West Bank as a nonvio
lent peace activist.
But Mintz and the portion of the
community that his opinions repre
sent were already set in their opin
ions before coming to the event.
Additionally, off-campus groups
had come with the intention of dis
rupting the event.
In addition to the plethora of fliers

handed out demonizing Epstein,
throughout the talk. She was frequent
ly yelled at and interrupted. At one
point a man suddenly jumped up while
Epstein was talking and recited what
appeared to he a prepared statement
informing her of pending legal actions
against her.
At another point during one of the
many tirades of the night, Epstein,
overwhelmed, had to physically turn
away from the audience. It is unac
ceptable that a University guest should
be treated with such disrespect on
Stanford's campus.
Mint/ openly expresses his con
cern that "the atmosphere currently
on campuses is not one in which a
constructive dialogue about the
conflict can legitimately take
place." I wonder why Mintz, who
cares so much about the atmo
sphere, fails to mention any of the
egregious events above?
With only a quick analysis, Mintz's ar

guments prove themselves to be not
just ridiculous but divergent from real
ity. Probably because he submitted his
op-ed before actually seeing the event.
Regardless, these are desperate acts
to discredit the experiences of an 80-
year-old Holocaust survivor, whose
words and criticisms they deem so dan
gerous. that they need to be silenced.
All in all. I left feeling that Epstein
was a courageous and moral person.
Briefly at the end. fears of violence
were raised when two uniformed and
one undercover police officer showed
up. perhaps to protect our Jewish
brothers after a night of "incitement to
violehce."
But the police had come to escort
the one person who was being "intim
idated and persecuted" that night:
Hedy Epstein.
