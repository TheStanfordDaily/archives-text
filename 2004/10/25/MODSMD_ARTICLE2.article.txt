# Students urge Univ. investment disclosure
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Coalition for In
vestment Disclosure, also known
as SCID, is lobbying the Universi
ty to make the process for invest
ing Stanford's endowment more
transparent. The group is circulat
ing e-mails to publicize the issue
as well as taking its case for disclo
sure directly to those who invest
the University's money.
The University has a panel that
reviews allegations of unethical
investment decisions, but SCID
claims the panel is ineffective be
cause neither its members nor the
outside public has any access to
information regarding Stanford's
investment in private equities.
"Stanford has $12 billion," said
SCID member and co-terminal
student Anna Mumford. "It has a
large impact on the way things are
being run all over the world."
Vice President and General
Counsel Debra Zumwalt said that
limited access to investment deci
sions does not compromise the
University's ethical position.
"Investments do not have to be
disclosed to students in order to
be ethical," Zumwalt wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "The Stan
ford trustees have a clear state

ment on investment responsibility
and procedures to review invest
ment practices."
Members of SCID are coordi
nating with other student groups
around the country fora National
Day of Action, when they will
present a letter to Tom Steyer the
founder and senior managing
member of Farallon Capital Man
agement, one of the world's
largest hedge funds, which invests
money for several universities, in
cluding Stanford.
The letter will ask Farallon to
disclose its investments and to let
universities that invest with Faral
lon disclose investment informa
tion without the risk of litigation.
The Daily was unable to reach
Steyer by phone or e-mail for this
story.
"Here at Stanford we talk
about caring about what goes on
in the world," Mumford said.
"But if the money we contribute
it is ours as Stanford community
members-is going to highly uneth
ical things, it's our duty-our oblig
ation-to change that and be the
conscience of the University."
Additionally, SCID sent a let
ter to Stanford Management
Company President and Chief
Executive Officer Michael Mc-
Caffery on Oct. 11. asking the

company to begin a dialogue
about the ethical issues consid
ered when investing the endow
ment. The letter also asked that
Stanford's investment managers
be disclosed, along with any infor
mation the investment managers
give Stanford about the compa
nies in which they invest.
In response, McCaffery told
SCID that it should address its
concerns to the Advisory Panel
for Investment Responsibility,
also known as APIR. and that
under University policy he could
not reply to SCID himself.
The APIR is an investigative
panel composed of students and
faculty that reviews and research
es allegations of substantial social
injury by companies in the en
dowment. Based on its findings,
the APIR is supposed to make
recommendations to the Univer
sity president and to a sub-com
mittee of the Board of Trustees.
The subcommittee then makes in
vestment policy recommenda
tions to the Board of Trustees,
which oversees all issues of Uni
versity governance.
" The APIR is charged with re
sponding to this kind of inquiry
and researching these kind of is-
