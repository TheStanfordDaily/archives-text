# Students urge Univ. investment disclosure
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Coalition for In
vestment Disclosure, also known
as SCID, is lobbying the Universi
ty to make the process for invest
ing Stanford's endowment more
transparent. The group is circulat
ing e-mails to publicize the issue
as well as taking its case for disclo
sure directly to those who invest
the University's money.
The University has a panel that
reviews allegations of unethical
investment decisions, but SCID
claims the panel is ineffective be
cause neither its members nor the
outside public has any access to
information regarding Stanford's
investment in private equities.
"Stanford has $12 billion," said
SCID member and co-terminal
student Anna Mumford. "It has a
large impact on the way things are
being run all over the world."
Vice President and General
Counsel Debra Zumwalt said that
limited access to investment deci
sions does not compromise the
University's ethical position.
"Investments do not have to be
disclosed to students in order to
be ethical," Zumwalt wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "The Stan
ford trustees have a clear state

ment on investment responsibility
and procedures to review invest
ment practices."
Members of SCID are coordi
nating with other student groups
around the country fora National
Day of Action, when they will
present a letter to Tom Steyer the
founder and senior managing
member of Farallon Capital Man
agement, one of the world's
largest hedge funds, which invests
money for several universities, in
cluding Stanford.
The letter will ask Farallon to
disclose its investments and to let
universities that invest with Faral
lon disclose investment informa
tion without the risk of litigation.
The Daily was unable to reach
Steyer by phone or e-mail for this
story.
"Here at Stanford we talk
about caring about what goes on
in the world," Mumford said.
"But if the money we contribute
it is ours as Stanford community
members-is going to highly uneth
ical things, it's our duty-our oblig
ation-to change that and be the
conscience of the University."
Additionally, SCID sent a let
ter to Stanford Management
Company President and Chief
Executive Officer Michael Mc-
Caffery on Oct. 11. asking the

company to begin a dialogue
about the ethical issues consid
ered when investing the endow
ment. The letter also asked that
Stanford's investment managers
be disclosed, along with any infor
mation the investment managers
give Stanford about the compa
nies in which they invest.
In response, McCaffery told
SCID that it should address its
concerns to the Advisory Panel
for Investment Responsibility,
also known as APIR. and that
under University policy he could
not reply to SCID himself.
The APIR is an investigative
panel composed of students and
faculty that reviews and research
es allegations of substantial social
injury by companies in the en
dowment. Based on its findings,
the APIR is supposed to make
recommendations to the Univer
sity president and to a sub-com
mittee of the Board of Trustees.
The subcommittee then makes in
vestment policy recommenda
tions to the Board of Trustees,
which oversees all issues of Uni
versity governance.
" The APIR is charged with re
sponding to this kind of inquiry
and researching these kind of is-
University does not disclose the
private equities in which it invests

sues and creating an open dialogue,"
McCaffery told The Daily. "[The Stan
ford Management Company] gets all
kinds of requests from all sorts of
groups inside and outside the Universi
ty for this kind of data and other kinds
ol data. It is really important for us that
the APIR sort out for us groups the
University recognizes and that we
should he sharing information with. If
|S('lD| is not happy with the APIR
process, it needs to revisit that process."
S( 'll) did present the APIR with a
proposal for investment disclosure in
May. though according to Mumford,
the panel is ineffective. This time,
Mumford said, "we know that's not
going to go too far, so we're probably
going to go directly to the Board of
Trustees."
Stanford does not publicly disclose
any of its investments, though a signifi
cant investment in a publicly held com
pany. such as Google, is sometimes dis
closed in the company's public filings.
However, neither the public nor
APIR has any way of knowing what pri
vate equities the University decides to
invest in.
In the past decade, SCID claims,
hedge funds such as Farallon have ac
counted for an increasingly large por
tion of universities' endowment invest
ment.
Hedge funds are high-risk, high-re
turn private investment funds typically
limited to investors with a net worth of
at least $1 million. They are subject to
minimal Securities and Exchange Com
mission regulations, though Farallon is
voluntarily registered with the SEC as
an investment advisor. Some consider
Stanford's investment in hedge funds
essential if the University is to maxi
mize its return on the endowment.
"The results we deliver to leading
universities help make the cost of a col
lege education more affordable for stu
dents, parents and families." said Stey
er. Farallon s founder, in a May 17 letter
responding to a letter he received from
SCID and similar groups from other
universities. Steyer is also an alumnus
of and advisory board member at the
Graduate School of Business.
For strategic reasons, though, hedge
funds typically do not publicly disclose
their investments; the trading such in
vestment funds partake in often re
quires confidentiality to be successful
"Our financial success, however, is
intricately linked to the values we have
as an organization," Steyer also said in
the letter. "Core among these is the be
lief that we will only be successful as a
business if we act responsibly and ethi
cally.''
Kirk O. Hanson, an emeritus senior

lecturer in the Business School who
twice served as chair of the Stanford
President's Investment Responsibility
Committee, said he thinks that the I Jni
versity should disclose more than it is
currently doing, but for practical rea
sons, maybe not as much as SCID rec
ommends.
"The primary investments you want
to have disclosed — you might do it
once a year or quarterly," he said. "But
you shouldn't hold Stanford to the stan
dard of disclosing the investments that
every one of its funds makes. It would
keep Stanford out of that kind of invest
ment, and I don't think that serves the
interest of Stanford or its students."
Though Farallon's investments are
not made public, the company does
share information regarding its invest
ments with the Stanford Management
Company, according to Zumwalt.
Senior Ritu Sarin said she feels that
total disclosure is not necessary to en
sure that the University's investments
are ethical.
"As a student. I assume that the Uni
versity holds themselves to the same
ethical standards that they hold us to as
the student body," Sarin said. "If I
found out about [an unethical invest
ment), I wouldn't support it. but 1
wouldn't think to monitor their invest
ments."
SCID disagrees.
"I don't think it's good enough,"
Mumford said. "For example, the
APIR doesn't know |about Stanford's
investments in private equities], and if
they are supposed to be advising on
how to invest ethically, 1 don't think
that's good enough."
For example, SCID claims that in the
mid-19905, Farallon funded two contro
versial ballot initiatives in Colorado
that would have allowed their partner
ship to pump and sell the water beneath
the 97,000-acre Baca Ranch in the San
Luis Valley. Selling the water from be
neath the Ranch, which is adjacent to
the Great Sand Dunes National Monu
ment. could have destroyed the unique
ecosystem of the area, which harbors
more than 70 species of rare plants and
animals, including several species found
nowhere else in the world.
On the other hand, Farallon ulti
mately assisted with the sale of Baca
Ranch to the Nature Conservancy,
clearing the way for the protection of
the ranch.
"I think its a highly politicized situa
tion," Mumford said. "I think what was
going on and what Farallon was doing
wasn't very ethical, but maybe they
thought they weren't doing anything
wrong. There are lots of different takes
on it, but whatever happened it ended

up looking bad, which is almost just as
important."
SOD members met with Steyer in
May, and Mumford said Steyer was
willing to work with the students, de
spite their disagreements over the facts
and different ethical criteria.
"He said that he's all for disclosure,
and he's going to help us talk to Stan
ford about finding a way to find more
disclosure," Mumford said. "1 think
there's a lot of debate about what is eth
ical in investing, but without disclosure
we can't even begin to have a discus
sion. Under disclosure I think a com
promise is possible — he is definitely in
the same camp as we are."
Students at Stanford's peer institu
tions have shown similar levels of con
cern over the issue of investment disclo
sure. SCID is a subsidiary of the Re
sponsible Endowments Coalition, a na
tional organization of students from 28
colleges, including Harvard, Yale and
Duke, formed to help students by pro
viding a single-source location for news,
resources, and mentoring advice on so
cially responsible investing in higher ed
ucation.
REC holds conferences for students
interested in learning more on the sub
ject. and Mumford represented Stan
ford at one such conference held at Yale
in July.
"We did a bunch of workshops on
what a corporation is. corporate re
sponsibility, how to do corporate re
search. what are endowments and the
history of endowments," she said. "We
talked about our goals for the national
coalition and made plans for the Na
tional Day of Action."
Students are becoming aware that
investment decisions can have major
repercussions for universities. For in
stance. the U.S. government sued Har
vard University after fraudulent trans
actions that took place while Farallon's
Nancy Zimmerman invested Farallon
funds in Russian debt while her hus
band. a I larvard professor on a US AID
grant, acted as an advisor to the Russian
official who made decisions about debt
policy.
Groups such as SCID are not only
getting attention from concerned stu
dents, but also from news outlets such
as the San Jose Mercury News and
Business Weekly.
"I think this could be kind of the next
big student activist issue going on."
Mumford said. "The move toward pri
vate equity is a big phenomenon that
goes along with the national discussion
on corporate responsibility right now.
The public is realizing corporations
need to be more socially responsible."
