# Smoke and mirrors aside...
## If Google were elected to run the country today 
### 
I want to take a break fora mo
ment from all the high-inten
sity headlines, campaign
rhetoric, poll data and — ah
yes — talking-head election analy
sis to look at something slightly
different.
Last Monday, when I opened up
The Daily, a pamphlet insert fell out
with the letters "GLAT" promi
nently emblazoned across its center.
GLAT? Google Labs Aptitude
Test, it said underneath. I laughed
like a giggling freshman throwing
paper at Flicks.
The GLAT was composed of
witty questions like "write a haiku
describing possible methods for
predicting search-traffic seasonali
ty." The whole thing looked like a
joke.
Except it came from Google,
where everything — from banner
animations to press releases — ex
udes a sense of humor unparalleled
in the corporate world.
In the midst of so much political
drama and international turmoil, I
can't recall the last time I picked up
a newspaper and laughed. Then I got
to thinking ...
What if we elected Google to run
this country? A refreshing depar
ture, perhaps. Here's what we could
expect.
1) A Google presidency — like
the homepage — would be modest
in appearance but very powerful in
capability. We wouldn't have to
worry about it making boisterous
claims about its performance or ex
aggerating intelligence about
weapons of mass destruction.
2) Desktop search would be used
to track down terrorists. Sifting
through millions of pages of intelli
gence would be much easier as a re
sult. And Cat Stevens wouldn't get
arrested again.
3) Before "going public" with a
decision, the Google administration
would conduct an interview with
Playboy first. That'd be more inter
esting than President George W.
Bush's recent interview with Bill
O'Reilly, who apparently likes the
same things as Playboy.
4) Google has already won the
hearts and minds of people all over
the world. It's available in 35 lan
guages, and its search engine even
sits on Al-Jazeera's homepage. It
also has a type-and-translate appli
cation. That means it can pronounce
"Abu Ghraib."
5) The "Google Local" program
would also promote the growth of

small businesses. Over 150,000 com
panies advertise with Google.
Thankfully, Enron and Halliburton
are not two of them.
6) Citizens would quit raising a
fuss about the Patriot Act, because
they would graciously cede their
privacy rights to

Google without
thinking twice
about its inva
sive methods, so
long as they're in
preliminary beta
format.
7 )
Google's "Don't
be evil" motto is
a more pleasant
and wittier alter-

native to the trite "axis of evil" and
"evildoer" rhetoric that convinces
us we're all about to die.
8) There would be no spin or
slowness when responding to ques
tions. Google would offer quick an
swers to any journalistic query in
about .29 seconds.
9) Because it lets its engineers
take time to develop their own pro
jects, Google would devise creative
and innovative solutions to many of
our nation's problems. Digging for
oil in Alaska probably wouldn't be
one of them.
10) Finally, Google is run by
techies. As a fuzzy, I'll admit that
our record of presidents — former
lawyers, actors, peanut farmers
and failed businessman — is par
tially responsible for much of
what Henry Kissinger describes as
a 100 years of failed foreign poli
cy. Geeks, nerds and a White
House that runs like the Google
plex will prove better scenery
than Rove-ian receding hairlines
and soapboxes used by preachy
social conservatives.
Google may not be perfect, but
its actions are transparent, and it
doesn't take itself too seriously. Its
company attitude and ethics would
serve as a refreshing contrast to the
culture of corporate malfeasance
and profit-maximizing bottom lines
that has seeped into political deci
sion-making.
And judging by the attention
we gave Hoover, Stanford would
love to see another of its own be
come president.

paper at Flicks.
The GLAT was composed of
witty questions like "write a haiku
describing possible methods for
predicting search-traffic seasonali
ty." The whole thing looked like a
joke.
Except it came from Google,
where everything — from banner
animations to press releases — ex
udes a sense of humor unparalleled
in the corporate world.
In the midst of so much political
drama and international turmoil, I
can't recall the last time I picked up
a newspaper and laughed. Then I got
to thinking ...
What if we elected Google to run
this country? A refreshing depar
ture, perhaps. Here's what we could
expect.
1) A Google presidency — like
the homepage — would be modest
in appearance but very powerful in
capability. We wouldn't have to
worry about it making boisterous
claims about its performance or ex
aggerating intelligence about
weapons of mass destruction.
2) Desktop search would be used
to track down terrorists. Sifting
through millions of pages of intelli
gence would be much easier as a re
sult. And Cat Stevens wouldn't get
arrested again.
3) Before "going public" with a
decision, the Google administration
would conduct an interview with
Playboy first. That'd be more inter
esting than President George W.
Bush's recent interview with Bill
O'Reilly, who apparently likes the
same things as Playboy.
4) Google has already won the
hearts and minds of people all over
the world. It's available in 35 lan
guages, and its search engine even
sits on Al-Jazeera's homepage. It
also has a type-and-translate appli
cation. That means it can pronounce
"Abu Ghraib."
5) The "Google Local" program
would also promote the growth of

small businesses. Over 150,000 com
panies advertise with Google.
Thankfully, Enron and Halliburton
are not two of them.
6) Citizens would quit raising a
fuss about the Patriot Act, because
they would graciously cede their
privacy rights to

Google without
thinking twice
about its inva
sive methods, so
long as they're in
preliminary beta
format.
7 )
Google's "Don't
be evil" motto is
a more pleasant
and wittier alter-

native to the trite "axis of evil" and
"evildoer" rhetoric that convinces
us we're all about to die.
8) There would be no spin or
slowness when responding to ques
tions. Google would offer quick an
swers to any journalistic query in
about .29 seconds.
9) Because it lets its engineers
take time to develop their own pro
jects, Google would devise creative
and innovative solutions to many of
our nation's problems. Digging for
oil in Alaska probably wouldn't be
one of them.
10) Finally, Google is run by
techies. As a fuzzy, I'll admit that
our record of presidents — former
lawyers, actors, peanut farmers
and failed businessman — is par
tially responsible for much of
what Henry Kissinger describes as
a 100 years of failed foreign poli
cy. Geeks, nerds and a White
House that runs like the Google
plex will prove better scenery
than Rove-ian receding hairlines
and soapboxes used by preachy
social conservatives.
Google may not be perfect, but
its actions are transparent, and it
doesn't take itself too seriously. Its
company attitude and ethics would
serve as a refreshing contrast to the
culture of corporate malfeasance
and profit-maximizing bottom lines
that has seeped into political deci
sion-making.
And judging by the attention
we gave Hoover, Stanford would
love to see another of its own be
come president.
