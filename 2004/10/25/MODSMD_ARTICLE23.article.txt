Work toward compromise
As students committed to the cre
ation of common ground through sus
tained discussion of the conflict in the
Middle East, the co-presidents of the
Middle East Issues Dialogue group dis
courage any counterproductive actions
toward educating the campus about
contemporary issues in the Middle
East. Moving forward towards peace
requires context and compassion.
On this campus we have the unique
opportunity to talk civilly with those
people whose opinions we might find
objectionable. This possibility lies at
the heart of education: By having such
conversations, we often realize that bi
nary perspectives are an illusion, just as
illusory as the monolithic groups about

which those actions generalize.
Such generalizing serves to make
people defensive and hinders conver
sation. when our goal should be the op
posite- to create trusting enough envi
ronments for sincere discussion of
these highly complex issues.
The Middle East Issues group
seeks to talk openly about the differ
ences among us on such matters,
which are so close to our hearts. In
doing so, we strive to forget assump
tions about what others believe and
understand their viewpoints. It serves
us well to understand who we are,
where we come from, and why we be
lieve the things we do, and to extend
that respect to those with whom we're
speaking, regardless of the issue.
We have learned that peace and

progress are not about winning debates
or scoring points, but about honest
speaking, and more importantly, active
listening. Reactions to Hedy Epstein's
talk last Wednesday night, as seen both
at the event and in The Daily highlight
the need for such constructive dialogue.
We hope that the Daily's Editorial
Board, its readers, and students having
these discussions in the privacy of their
own rooms and dorm halls, can benefit
from our model of dialogue. We invite
anyone reading this to join for weekly
discussions over dinner by subscribing
to our email list.
