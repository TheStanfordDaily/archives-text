## Blanking USC redeems LA trip for soccer 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After three weeks of action, things continue
to look messy in the Pacific-10 Conference
women's soccer standings, with eight teams still
boasting strong enough records to contend for
the conference title.
This past weekend didn't help much, as seven
of the league's 10 teams came away with splits in
their weekend series.
The Stanford women's soccer team was no ex
ception as it took on UCLA and Southern Cali
fornia in Los Angeles. The No. 16 Cardinal (10-
4-2,2-2-1 Pac-10) lost to the No. 6 Bruins (10-5-0.
4-2-0 Pac-10) on Friday night before bouncing
back to defeat the Trojans (9-6-1, 3-3-0 Pac-10)
on Sunday.
There was plenty of anticipation surrounding
the Cardinal's opening match-up against UCLA,
as the Pac-10's preseason coaches' poll had the
Bruins and Cardinal finishing first and second in
the Pac-10, respectively, this season.
Although the Cardinal lost by just a goal, they
were thoroughly controlled by the Bruins in a
contest that did not look like a match-up between
two of the league's top contenders.
The Bruins shut down the Cardinal's normal
ly potent offense, allowing just one shot on goal

in the entire 90 minutes of play. The lone shot
came in the first half when junior midfielder
Leah Tapscott fired a long shot towards the
Bruin net.
On the other side of the ball, the Bruins put up
a strong offensive attack that translated into 19
shots and one goal. Fortunately, the Cardinal de
fense was able to limit the damage for most of the
game thanks to a stellar performance from senior
goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart.
Barnhart collected 10 saves on the night, top
ping her season high of seven against California.
There was only so much Barnhart and the
Cardinal could do, however, as the Bruins finally
broke the game open with a little over four min
utes remaining in regulation. Bruin forward
Bristyn Davis was inside the Cardinal goal box
when she stopped an incoming pass from team
mate Lindsay Greco. Within seven yards of the
net. Davis was able to fire off a shot that barely
slipped by Barnhart to give the Bruins the 1-0
win.
The Cardinal faced a scary moment with less
than a minute remaining in regulation when
Barnhart was forced to leave the game following
a severe collision a fellow teammate. Barnhart
was replaced by freshman Erica Holland, who
finished out the game's last seconds in goal.
Barnhart was fortunately back in action on

Sunday as the Cardinal looked for redemption
against Southern California in their second
match of the weekend.
The Cardinal grabbed a critical 1-0 victory
from the Trojans to keep themselves from falling
two games below .500 in Pac-10 play.
The Cardinal offense looked to make up for
its poor performance Friday night and did so with
an aggressive first half in which it posted seven
shots on goal. Senior forward Marcie Ward led
the way, posting three shots and scoring what
would turn out to be the game-winning goal.
Ward found the net late in the first half thanks
to a cross pass from Tapscott. It is the co-cap
tain's seventh goal of the season, good for fifth in
the Pac-10.
Sophomore midfielder Gina Farias-Eisner
had a strong showing off of the bench, adding
three shots of her own. Midfielders Emilee Shim
and Lizzy George rounded out the Cardinal's
total with one shot each.
Offensively, the Cardinal slowed down in the
second half, managing just one shot on goal.
They made up for it on the other end of the field,
however, holding the Trojans scoreless as they
fought to tie the game. Barnhart racked up four
saves on the afternoon, bringing her weekend
