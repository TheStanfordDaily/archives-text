# Fade Into Bolivian
## Mike Tyson: quote machine, cannibal, video game legend 
### 
I'm not really a boxing fan. hut 1 love Mike
Tyson. And, when it comes to loving him
post-Buster Douglas, it's no longer ahout
Mike's hoxing.
First off, I'm not playing the angle that he's
misunderstood, and thus we need to sympa
thize with his bipolar, manic depressive self (a
quote: "I'm on the Zoloft to keep from killing
y'alD.
I'm actually well aware of his character
flaws. He was convicted for rape, he sounds

like Paul Hamm when he
opens his mouth, and he only
does interviews with female
reporters if they fornicate
with him. Although clearly
not a model citizen, he did
manage to deliver a well de
served chomp to the ear
(and chomp to the thigh of
Lennox Lewis) of hypocriti
cal Christian, Mr. "Let's

Have Five Children out of
Wedlock." Evander Holyfield.
It's about loving a man who is a human
quote machine, who starred in perhaps the
greatest game ever released for the Nintendo
Entertainment System. It's about how Mike's
middle name. Gerard, is the surname of our
esteemed cross-country coach (and possible
international terrorist, if you ask airport secu
rity).
It's about Mike Tyson the cannibal. Mike
Tyson the cannabis smoker, and Mike Tyson
the owner of Montecore the Tiger. And final
ly it's about Mike's pain, the pain we all feel in
side: "I wish that you guys had children so I
could kick them in the (expletive) head or
stomp on their testicles so you could teel my
pain because that's the pain I have waking up
every day."
And that makes Michael Gerard Tyson a
winner in my book.
Released in 1987, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out
was a defining moment in my generation.
Who doesn't remember the first time Kid Dy
namite asked them if "you think the speed of
your fingers can match the strength of my
fists?" before Mike sent you fading into Boli
vian with a first round KO. Back then, Tyson
was the ultimate badass â€” according to
Punch-Out statistics, a 21-year-old Mike
weighed in at a menacing 220 lbs. and was 31-
0 with 27 KO's. All it took was one punch, and
our favorite boxer Mac was sent sprawling to
the canvas.
Tangent: Even with these lofty stats, a
question needs to be posed. How can a man
with the voice of Paul Hamm command so
much street cred? As soon as Tyson opens his
mouth, he sounds as if he's inhaled a volatile
mixture of prepubescent boys and helium.
Of course, Tyson's Nintendo world (and
possibly his life, which was always far less
meaningful to me) would all come tumbling
down in 1991. when he was convicted of rape
and sentenced to a three-year prison term in
Indiana.
Interestingly, Nintendo felt the need to dis
tance themselves from a convicted rapist and
re-released the game as Punch-Out. Mike
Tyson was replaced with a strikingly similar,
pasty, gangster-esque character named Mr.
Dream.
Hailing from Dreamland, with an un
known age and a perfect record of 99-0 (with
99 KO's of course). Mr. Dream was essential
ly Tyson with a Michael Jackson-style bleach
job. He had exactly the same moves as Tyson.

Love a guy that
rolls in style

exactly the same punches, and exactly the same
character outline as Tyson. Coincidence? I
think not.
People tell me that boxing no longer mat
ters, that no one cares enough to purchase
fights on Pay-Per-View. But. when people tell
me this. I point to Tyson and his proclamation
that "1 can sell out Madison Square Garden
masturbating."
Although this quote might ring as hollow as
the punches thrown by the next Hurricane
McNeely that Tyson decides to fight. I'm still
inclined to believe a man who stated that "I
may have smoked too much weed, but I wasn't
taking drugs or anything."
This man clearly knows the art of self-pro
motion.
From careful examination of almost any
great post-fight Tyson interview, the critical
factor to producing a legendary one-liner is
the presence of Jim Gray. There's nothing bet
ter than a quote where someone praises God
while at the same time proclaims a desire to in
dulge in cannibalistic behavior.
And thus. Gray's infectious persona leads
Tyson to deliver with this gem of a quote:
"There's no one that can match me. My style is
impetuous. My defense is impregnable. And
I'm just ferocious. I want your heart. I want to
eat his children. Praise be to Allah."
Indeed.
If Mike actually ate Lennox Lewis' chil
dren. he wouldn't need to spend money on
food products. Quote Tyson, again: "The

world I come from, I know people who did eat
children, put them in microwaves." Clearly
Tyson was acutely aware of his impending
bankruptcy and cannibalistic nature when he
gave us these thoughts.
Some of you may have noticed that the title
of my column. Fade into Bolivian, was stolen
from a Mike Tyson interview when he inad
vertently replaced the word "oblivion" with
" Bolivian."
Even if Tyson is no longer relevant as a
fighter, he still maintains an uncanny ability to
roll in style. Take this anecdote from my
buddy John, who apparently met Iron Mike
while in Vegas.
According to John, a bankrupt and bipolar
Tyson still had the time to not only pose with
his fans, he also still found the means to roll in
a limo with an entourage of honeys. And this,
my fellow readers, is exactly why I love Mike
Tyson.

ice and yo Jeff, straight up, I think I can /heat/
