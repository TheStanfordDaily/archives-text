## Cardinal offensive line struggles as rushing game grinds to a halt 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With Stanford and Oregon locked in a defensive battle at
a rainy Stanford Stadium, both Michael Sgroi and Jared
Siegel suspected it would come down to a field goal.
And. against all odds, it did. After getting the ball back on
their own 23-yard-line with just 16 seconds left, the Cardinal
moved the ball 48 yards in two plays and 15 seconds to set up
a game-tying attempt for Sgroi.
The junior kicker lined up for what would have been the
longest field goal of his career, and he hit what was probably
the hardest, straightest ball of his career.
And yet. in an agonizing twist of fate. Sgroi's attempt at
the end of the game came perhaps a yard short of clearing
the crossbar, and Oregon held on fora 16-13 win.
"It was a wet shoe and a heavy ball short." Sgroi said. "If
it's warm and dry. it's a field goal and we're going to over
time."
In a loss that featured a variety of unexpected mitigating
factors — the loss of star Stanford quarterback Trent Ed
wards to injury. 10 Oregon sacks, minus-8 rushing yards for
Stanford and 223 all-purpose yards by Ducks running back
Terrence Whitehead — the Cardinal were denied a chance
at overtime because it was raining.
Siegel. who booted field goals of 37. 51 and 21 yards for
the Ducks (4-3,3-1 Pacific-10 Conference), saw it coming.
"I knew he'd have to execute a wonderful kick." Siegel
said. "The balls weren't traveling that well, and that's at the
edge of anybody's range."
Stanford (4-3. 2-2) has played a lot of close games this
year — the team's losses have been by a combined total of
just 14 points — and Sgroi helped keep the Cardinal in it
early, connecting from 28 and 43 yards. Neither team found
the end zone until the fourth quarter, when the two teams
traded two-yard touchdowns.
With 13:40 remaining. Patrick Danahy lined up as the
first back in the Cardinal's favorite goal-line set. the triple-I.
He split left and caught the scoring pass from T.C. Ostran
der to give Stanford its only lead. 13-9.
Ostrander. who entered the game in the second quarter
shortly after Edwards left with a bruised left shoulder and
hand, led the Cardinal 73 yards in 13 plays on that drive, the

longest either team managed all afternoon.
Oregon took over, hut the Ducks' drive stalled, and they
faced fourth-and-three from the Cardinal 38-yard line. Head
coach Mike Belotti made a gutsy call, and Kellen Clemens
lofted a soft pass down the left sideline. Keith Allen slipped
behind Stanford's double-coverage and made a diving, slid
ing 36-yard reception. On the next play. Whitehead slid
around left end for what proved to be the game's final score.
The junior running back was Oregon's bread and butter
all afternoon, rushing 28 times for 131 yards and catching
eight passes for 92 yards, including a 51-yard scamper that
led to Siegel's third field goal and a 9-6 Oregon lead in the
third quarter.
"I'm happy that they gave me the ball a lot, and I wanted
to respond to that," Whitehead said. "Our offensive line did
a great job blocking today."
While Stanford's defense struggled with the shifty White
head. its offensive line had a hard time controlling Robby
Valenzuela and the Ducks' pass rush. Valenzuela had two
sacks for 21 yards, and seven other Ducks sacked Edwards
or Ostrander.
Under heavy pressure, Edwards was 5-of-8 for just 33
yards before Valenzuela's hit knocked him out of the game.
Ostrander, who completed 18-of-29 passes for 236 yards in
an impressive overall performance, took seven sacks for
minus-48 yards.
"Oregon's defensive front pushed the pocket pretty well,
and young guys have a tendency to hold onto the ball a little
longer." Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said.
With Oregon penetrating into the backfield so effective
ly, Stanford's running backs also had their difficulties. J.R.
Lemon rushed 11 times for 30 yards, while Kenneth Tolon
gained 21 yards on six carries.
"If the guys up front are getting to the quarterback, their
linebackers don't need to blitz as much, and they can just sit
back and read the play," Tolon explained.
Still, despite all the sacks and the Cardinal's related aban
donment of the ground game — Tolon and Lemon received
just eight carries in the entire second half — Ostrander was
able to settle in and move the ball.
"I felt pretty good. I felt like I was prepared to go in there
and play," Ostrander said.
Added tight end Alex Smith: "I can't commend him
enough. He stepped in and made the plays when he had to
and had some big passes. I 'm proud of the job he did until the
last snap."
