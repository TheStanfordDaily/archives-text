# Women pick up split in Washington

### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, the Stanford women's vol
leyball team saw the two extremes in the Pa
cific-10 Conference, and there were no sur
prises.
Facing dead-last Washington State (3-19.
0-9 Pac-10), the Cardinal (15-5, 7-2 Pac-10)
quickly rolled over the Cougars in straight
games. The next night, the tables were turned
and Stanford was handed a 3-0 loss by confer
ence-leading and nationally top-ranked
Washington (17-0,9-0 Pac-10).
The win over Stanford puts Washington
squarely in the driver's seat in the Pac-10 as
teams get ready for the second half of confer
ence play. Stanford's loss ties it with Southern
California and California for second in the
conference, with all teams holding a pair of
losses.
"Washington was the best team in the first
half," said Stanford head coach John Dun
ning. "They played very well last night against
us, and away against USC and UCLA, so
they're in charge. The second half is tough,
though, and anything can happen."
If there was any concern that the Cardinal
would overlook the Cougars in anticipation of
their showdown with No. 1 Washington, the
team's play in game one of Friday night's
match quickly dispelled any doubts. Stanford
played tightly with Washington State for the
first half of the game, but a Cardinal run tal
lied five of the next six points and the Cougars
wouldn't catch up.
Setting the tone for the rest of the match,
Stanford took game one on a net violation by
the Cougars, 30-17. While the Cardinal out
hit the Cougars (who hit less than .000 for
the game), the story of the game was the
Cardinal defense, which out-dug Washing
ton State 20-12.
Game two was more of the same, as Stan
ford smacked Washington State around again,
30-19. It was the Cougars' best game, and the
only one in the match in which they had a pos
itive hitting percentage as a team (.132). Stan
ford led early, let the Cougars come back to
within one point, and then ran away as if teas
ing the team from Pullman.
Washington State was able to hold off four
game points before a service error gave the
