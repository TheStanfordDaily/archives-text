# Women pick up split in Washington
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, the Stanford women's vol
leyball team saw the two extremes in the Pa
cific-10 Conference, and there were no sur
prises.
Facing dead-last Washington State (3-19.
0-9 Pac-10), the Cardinal (15-5, 7-2 Pac-10)
quickly rolled over the Cougars in straight
games. The next night, the tables were turned
and Stanford was handed a 3-0 loss by confer
ence-leading and nationally top-ranked
Washington (17-0,9-0 Pac-10).
The win over Stanford puts Washington
squarely in the driver's seat in the Pac-10 as
teams get ready for the second half of confer
ence play. Stanford's loss ties it with Southern
California and California for second in the
conference, with all teams holding a pair of
losses.
"Washington was the best team in the first
half," said Stanford head coach John Dun
ning. "They played very well last night against
us, and away against USC and UCLA, so
they're in charge. The second half is tough,
though, and anything can happen."
If there was any concern that the Cardinal
would overlook the Cougars in anticipation of
their showdown with No. 1 Washington, the
team's play in game one of Friday night's
match quickly dispelled any doubts. Stanford
played tightly with Washington State for the
first half of the game, but a Cardinal run tal
lied five of the next six points and the Cougars
wouldn't catch up.
Setting the tone for the rest of the match,
Stanford took game one on a net violation by
the Cougars, 30-17. While the Cardinal out
hit the Cougars (who hit less than .000 for
the game), the story of the game was the
Cardinal defense, which out-dug Washing
ton State 20-12.
Game two was more of the same, as Stan
ford smacked Washington State around again,
30-19. It was the Cougars' best game, and the
only one in the match in which they had a pos
itive hitting percentage as a team (.132). Stan
ford led early, let the Cougars come back to
within one point, and then ran away as if teas
ing the team from Pullman.

Il\ game three, a pattern had devel
oped and the teams played true to form.
Stanford closed out the match with anoth
er 30-17 victory. The Cougars were back
in the red for team hittinu percentage (-
.031).
Washington State held an early one
point lead, hut the Cardinal then scored
eight of the next nine and fourteen of the
next nineteen en route to the sweep. Stan
ford put the game and match away on a
kill by sophomore outside hitter Njideka
Nnamani.
Senior outside hitter Ogonna Nna
mani led the Cardinal with 14 kills, and
sophomore outside hitter Kristen
Richards added 11 kills. Sophomore mid
tile blocker Lizzie Suiter hit .700 with
seven kills and five blocks, while junior
libero Courtney Schultz and freshman
setter Bryn Kehoe anchored the defense
with 15 and 12 digs, respectively.
As in the Oregon match the week be
fore. Stanford head coach John Dunning
was afforded a degree of freedom that al
lowed him to play everyone on the Cardi
nal roster.
"It's huge to get everyone in the
game," Dunning said. "Everyone works
hard on our team, and so the ability to
play everyone is terrific. They deserve it.
There are just so many difficult matches
these days that it's hard to do. Everyone
played well when they were in the game."

Traveling across the state to Seattle
the next night, the Cardinal traded places
and found out what it was to be on the
wrong side of a 3-0 match, being quickly
dispensed by Washington.
Despite not having their best outside
hitter, senior Sanja Tomasevic, the
Huskies dominated the Cardinal and
showed why they are undefeated and
ranked No. 1 in the nation.
Stanford came out and fell quickly in
game one, 30-16. Washington led early
and only widened the gap as the game
went on. The Huskies reached game point
at 29-15 and closed the game out two
points later.
"I think we've played three really good
teams on the road, and part of the deal is
that they're defending their court," Dun
ning said of the Cardinal's seemingly slow
start. "I thought we were pretty ready last
night, and passed well at the start. We
gave ourselves an opportunity and they
played good defense. We just couldn't
buy a kill. I don't think we played flat at
the beginning."
Game two was more indicative of what
the Cardinal can do when focused on the
court.
Although Stanford dropped the game,
the team's play was vastly improved from
game one and the squad forced Washing
ton to overtime before the Huskies could
put the game away, 31-29. The teams were
neck and neck down the stretch, tied as

late as 29-29 before the Huskies put the
Cardinal away with two consecutive
points.
"Our block started to touch balls,
which allowed us to dig balls and our de
termination showed because we were get
ting more kills," Dunning said.
Game three was somewhere in be
tween games one and two. Stanford
dropped the game 30-22, a more re
spectable result than the first game, but
provided less of a challenge to Washing
ton than in the second game. The Huskies
had an early run to give them a six-point
lead, and the two teams played evenly
until time just ran out for the Cardinal.
Ogonna Nnamani led the attack for
the Cardinal with 14 kills, followed close
ly by senior Jennifer Hucke, who had 13
kills and 4 blocks. Junior setter Katie
Goldhahn and Courtney Schultz had 10
digs each.
Stanford will start the second half of
the Pac-10 schedule with a showdown
against cross-bay rival California on Sun
day afternoon at 3:00 PM. The game
marks a chance for the Cardinal to avenge
a five-game heartbreaking loss the Bears
handed them at Haas Pavilion.
"This is a big week for us, because you
rarely get a week this long to prepare,"
Dunning said. "We think this is one of
those weeks where our motivation needs
to be up because this is an opportunity to
practice and get better."
