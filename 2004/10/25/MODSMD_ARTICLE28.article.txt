# Cardinal drop further in NorPac after loss to Pacific
## 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's field
hockey season this year has been
eerily similar to Al C lore's 2(XK) Pres
idential campaign — an early lead,
but no victory, game after game.
I'he Cardinal (ft-10,0-5 Northern
Pacific Athletic Conference) lost to
Pacific I 'niversity (7-9, 4-2 NorPac)
2 1 after leading early in the game.
I ortunately for Stanford, with one
game remaining against rival Cal
and the NorPac tournament still left
to play, its safe to say that the Cardi
nal season hasn't quite been put into
a "lockbox" yet.
Playing on the wet Varsity Field
Hockey turf, the Cardinal faced
strong pressure from the Tigers early
in the game.
I'he ball was predominantly in
Stanford's defensive half, although
the Cardinal managed a few coun
terattack opportunities. Freshman
forward Jessica Zutz almost
punched in the game's first goal on a
give-and-go breakaway.
With the pressure from Pacific
mounting, the Cardinal managed to
move the ball into the Tigers' end of
the field and earn a penalty corner.
In the 30th minute, lone senior
I leanoi Morgan scored the first goal
of the match, deflecting a pass from
sophomore Liz Robinson into the
goal.
Morgan increased her lead as
Stanford's active career leader in
points with a total of 31. She has
played in 70 career sanies with 63

starts.
It looked like the Cardinal were
going to escape into halftime with a
1-0 lead, hut with less than a minute
left to play in the half, the Tigers
were awarded a penalty corner fora
flagrant foul inside the 25-yard line.
Cardinal goalkeeper Ana Kralovec
managed to stop the initial shot from
the corner, hut Tiger midfielder
Lindsey Rovai pounced on the loose
ball and scored her eighth goal of the
season.
The Tigers came out of the locker
room strong, immediately applying
pressure to the Stanford defense as
they had throughout the first half.
Their efforts paid dividends
quickly, as Pacific scored its second
goal off a penalty corner in the 40th
minute. Sophomore midfielder Jen
Chaney picked up her first goal of
the season on an assist from junior
defender Kaily McGrath.
Although they created a few
more scoring opportunities down
the stretch, the Cardinal were unable
to tie the score.
Statistically, Stanford accom
plished their pregame goals. The
Cardinal stayed even with the Tigers
in penalty corners, with each team
earning seven, and Stanford outshot
Pacific 11-10 on the game.
However, what didn't show up in
the box score was the consistent
pressure Pacific applied.
The Tigers showed off superior
stick skills and a quick passing of
fense that never allowed the Stan
ford team to play their own game.
The sting of losing another close

game was sharp for the Cardinal
women.
"It was disappointing to lose this
game, especially after coming out so
strong," said Stanford head coach
Lesley Irvine. "But we were incon
sistent today, and although we creat
ed a lot of offensive opportunities,
we had trouble finishing."
The Cardinal field hockey team
will graduate only one senior, Mor
gan, at the end of this season.
Morgan was honored before the
start of the game and received an
ovation after she scored Stanford's
lone goal. Morgan is fifth on the
team with 13 points this season.
"Eleanor had an outstanding con
test, and it was disappointing for us
that we couldn't get her a win in her
final regular-season home game,"
Irvine said. "But we're thrilled that
she was able to score today.
Stanford will travel to Berkeley
to take on Cal for the last game of the
regular season next Saturday.
The Golden Bears are ranked
No. 14 in the country and will be
looking fora win to clinch the Nor-
Pac Conference title. A Stan
ford win would give Pacific a share of
the crown.
Stanford lost a heartbreaker to Cal
in their first matchup of the season, as
the Bears won in double overtime.
"Any time we play Cal it's a
huge game for us," noted Irvine. "It
will be very easy to get up for that
game, and we will use it as a moti
vational base for the NorPac Tour
nament."

Junior Lyndsay Erickson struggles to maintain possession Saturday against Pacific. The Cardinal managed to
jump out to an early lead before surrendering two goals in their fifth consecutive NorPac loss.
The Stanford women's field
hockey season this year has been
eerily similar to Al C lore's 2(XK) Pres
idential campaign — an early lead,
but no victory, game after game.
I'he Cardinal (ft-10,0-5 Northern
Pacific Athletic Conference) lost to
Pacific I 'niversity (7-9, 4-2 NorPac)
2 1 after leading early in the game.
I ortunately for Stanford, with one
game remaining against rival Cal
and the NorPac tournament still left
to play, its safe to say that the Cardi
nal season hasn't quite been put into
a "lockbox" yet.
Playing on the wet Varsity Field
Hockey turf, the Cardinal faced
strong pressure from the Tigers early
in the game.
I'he ball was predominantly in
Stanford's defensive half, although
the Cardinal managed a few coun
terattack opportunities. Freshman
forward Jessica Zutz almost
punched in the game's first goal on a
give-and-go breakaway.
With the pressure from Pacific
mounting, the Cardinal managed to
move the ball into the Tigers' end of
the field and earn a penalty corner.
In the 30th minute, lone senior
I leanoi Morgan scored the first goal
of the match, deflecting a pass from
sophomore Liz Robinson into the
goal.
Morgan increased her lead as
Stanford's active career leader in
points with a total of 31. She has
played in 70 career sanies with 63

starts.
It looked like the Cardinal were
going to escape into halftime with a
1-0 lead, hut with less than a minute
left to play in the half, the Tigers
were awarded a penalty corner fora
flagrant foul inside the 25-yard line.
Cardinal goalkeeper Ana Kralovec
managed to stop the initial shot from
the corner, hut Tiger midfielder
Lindsey Rovai pounced on the loose
ball and scored her eighth goal of the
season.
The Tigers came out of the locker
room strong, immediately applying
pressure to the Stanford defense as
they had throughout the first half.
Their efforts paid dividends
quickly, as Pacific scored its second
goal off a penalty corner in the 40th
minute. Sophomore midfielder Jen
Chaney picked up her first goal of
the season on an assist from junior
defender Kaily McGrath.
Although they created a few
more scoring opportunities down
the stretch, the Cardinal were unable
to tie the score.
Statistically, Stanford accom
plished their pregame goals. The
Cardinal stayed even with the Tigers
in penalty corners, with each team
earning seven, and Stanford outshot
Pacific 11-10 on the game.
However, what didn't show up in
the box score was the consistent
pressure Pacific applied.
The Tigers showed off superior
stick skills and a quick passing of
fense that never allowed the Stan
ford team to play their own game.
The sting of losing another close

game was sharp for the Cardinal
women.
"It was disappointing to lose this
game, especially after coming out so
strong," said Stanford head coach
Lesley Irvine. "But we were incon
sistent today, and although we creat
ed a lot of offensive opportunities,
we had trouble finishing."
The Cardinal field hockey team
will graduate only one senior, Mor
gan, at the end of this season.
Morgan was honored before the
start of the game and received an
ovation after she scored Stanford's
lone goal. Morgan is fifth on the
team with 13 points this season.
"Eleanor had an outstanding con
test, and it was disappointing for us
that we couldn't get her a win in her
final regular-season home game,"
Irvine said. "But we're thrilled that
she was able to score today.
Stanford will travel to Berkeley
to take on Cal for the last game of the
regular season next Saturday.
The Golden Bears are ranked
No. 14 in the country and will be
looking fora win to clinch the Nor-
Pac Conference title. A Stan
ford win would give Pacific a share of
the crown.
Stanford lost a heartbreaker to Cal
in their first matchup of the season, as
the Bears won in double overtime.
"Any time we play Cal it's a
huge game for us," noted Irvine. "It
will be very easy to get up for that
game, and we will use it as a moti
vational base for the NorPac Tour
nament."
