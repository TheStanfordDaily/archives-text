# Early lead not enough as UCLA continues to dominate Stanford
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
I 01 just over 25 minutes this past Friday, it seemed
like a historic moment might happen in Los Angeles. The
No 17 Stanford men's soccer team (6-3-5, 1-2-2 Pacific
-10) was up I 0 against nemesis No. 7 UCLA (8-2-2,4-1-

0). After a tying goal was scored, another rarity — a
Stanford tie against UCLA — seemed possible until the
88th minute.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal could not hold on for the
last three minutes of regulation and they dropped the
game 2-1. The all-time record against the Bruins falls to
a disconcerting 3-25-2.
The fact that Stanford scored a goal against UCLA is
an accomplishment in itself. The Bruins had held the
Cardinal scoreless since the 2(H) 1 season. But this was not
the aim coming into Friday night's match; the objective
was an important Pac-10 victory. And unfortunately,
they could not deliver.
Stanford tallied the first goal of the match for the first
time in almost two weeks. After half an hour of dead
locked soccer, the Cardinal were awarded a free kick
about five yards outside the penalty area after a LJCLA
foul in the 31st minute. Senior forward Matt Janusz fired
a shot that ended up in the twine of the net.
The Cardinal have struggled to produce first-half at
tacks; Janusz's goal was only the fourth first-half goal of
the season for Stanford. The Cardinal held onto their
lead and entered halftime with a 1-0 advantage.
However, the lead would not last and the game got a
lot worse for the Cardinal. The UCLA defense tightened
up and Stanford was not only held scoreless, but also was
kept without a shot in the second half. In fact. Janusz's
goal was the only shot that Stanford took in the entire
match.
UCLA went on the attack early and often against
Stanford senior goalkeeper Robby Fulton. Fulton, the
team captain, rose to the challenge for much of the game,
including on a scoring opportunity 13 seconds into the
second half. That stop was one of four saves he had in the
match.
However, the task was just too much for Fulton alone.
In the 57th minute Jonathan Bornstein notched a goal off
a loose ball in the penalty area. UCLA would not be con
tent with a tie, however, and the Bruins continued to
pressure the Stanford net.
Bruin Kamani Hill let loose a shot to the left side of
the goal in the 60th minute which seemed destined for
the back of the net, but a sprawling Fulton deflected the

shot wide. This unfortunately only delayed the clincher.
The go-ahead goal came with only 2:44 left on the
clock. UCLA player Chad Barrett received a cross from
Hill and fired it into the goal. Fulton got a piece of the
hall, but the deflection did not alter the outcome and
UCLA took a lead they would not relinquish.
UCLA dominated in two measurable offensive cate
gories with a 13-1 advantage in shots and a 4-1 advantage
in corner kicks. The Stanford offense was anemic and
with the exception of Janusz's goal did not even chal
lenge the UCLA net, as Bruin keeper Eric Reed did not
have to make a single save in the UCLA win.
The Stanford coaching staff and players could not be
reached for comment on the game.
The Cardinal's loss to the Bruins was Stanford's first
road loss of the season (3-1-1). The team will return to
the Farm this weekend for two Pac-10 showdowns with
No. 5 Washington (10-3-2, 3-0-1) on Friday at 7:30 p.m..
and Oregon State (5-8-1, 0-4-0) Sunday at 2:30 p.m. on
Maloney Field.
This will be the second time in two weeks that Stan
ford will play the Huskies and Beavers. Stanford beat
Oregon State 2-1 with a last-minute goal from Darren
Fernandez in Corvallis. The Cardinal then tied Washing
ton 2-2 in Seattle, the only Pac-10 tie for the rolling
Huskies, in a game that Stanford led late into the second
half.
Both matches will be difficult, as past results show.
Though Oregon State has yet to win a Pac-10 match, the
Beavers played Stanford close and have a strong work
ethic lauded by the Cardinal coaching staff. Stanford will
have to be focused throughout the match.
Washington leads the Pac-10 standings and contin
ues to move up in the national rankings, now resting at
No. 5. The Huskies handed UCLA its only conference
loss and are having one of the best seasons in school
history.
Stanford is looking to get back on the right track and
get its seventh win, something it has been trying to do
since its Northwest road trip. Hopefully, returning to
Maloney Field can provide the impetus fora late-season
turnaround.

a shot that ended up in the twine of the net.
The Cardinal have struggled to produce first-half at
tacks; Janusz's goal was only the fourth first-half goal of
the season for Stanford. The Cardinal held onto their
lead and entered halftime with a 1-0 advantage.
However, the lead would not last and the game got a
lot worse for the Cardinal. The UCLA defense tightened
up and Stanford was not only held scoreless, but also was
kept without a shot in the second half. In fact. Janusz's
goal was the only shot that Stanford took in the entire
match.
UCLA went on the attack early and often against
Stanford senior goalkeeper Robby Fulton. Fulton, the
team captain, rose to the challenge for much of the game,
including on a scoring opportunity 13 seconds into the
second half. That stop was one of four saves he had in the
match.
However, the task was just too much for Fulton alone.
In the 57th minute Jonathan Bornstein notched a goal off
a loose ball in the penalty area. UCLA would not be con
tent with a tie, however, and the Bruins continued to
pressure the Stanford net.
Bruin Kamani Hill let loose a shot to the left side of
the goal in the 60th minute which seemed destined for
the back of the net, but a sprawling Fulton deflected the

shot wide. This unfortunately only delayed the clincher.
The go-ahead goal came with only 2:44 left on the
clock. UCLA player Chad Barrett received a cross from
Hill and fired it into the goal. Fulton got a piece of the
hall, but the deflection did not alter the outcome and
UCLA took a lead they would not relinquish.
UCLA dominated in two measurable offensive cate
gories with a 13-1 advantage in shots and a 4-1 advantage
in corner kicks. The Stanford offense was anemic and
with the exception of Janusz's goal did not even chal
lenge the UCLA net, as Bruin keeper Eric Reed did not
have to make a single save in the UCLA win.
The Stanford coaching staff and players could not be
reached for comment on the game.
The Cardinal's loss to the Bruins was Stanford's first
road loss of the season (3-1-1). The team will return to
the Farm this weekend for two Pac-10 showdowns with
No. 5 Washington (10-3-2, 3-0-1) on Friday at 7:30 p.m..
and Oregon State (5-8-1, 0-4-0) Sunday at 2:30 p.m. on
Maloney Field.
This will be the second time in two weeks that Stan
ford will play the Huskies and Beavers. Stanford beat
Oregon State 2-1 with a last-minute goal from Darren
Fernandez in Corvallis. The Cardinal then tied Washing
ton 2-2 in Seattle, the only Pac-10 tie for the rolling
Huskies, in a game that Stanford led late into the second
half.
Both matches will be difficult, as past results show.
Though Oregon State has yet to win a Pac-10 match, the
Beavers played Stanford close and have a strong work
ethic lauded by the Cardinal coaching staff. Stanford will
have to be focused throughout the match.
Washington leads the Pac-10 standings and contin
ues to move up in the national rankings, now resting at
No. 5. The Huskies handed UCLA its only conference
loss and are having one of the best seasons in school
history.
Stanford is looking to get back on the right track and
get its seventh win, something it has been trying to do
since its Northwest road trip. Hopefully, returning to
Maloney Field can provide the impetus fora late-season
turnaround.

Senior forward Darren Fernandez leads the team with
seven goals and 16 points on the season, but was held
scoreless against UCLA this weekend.
I 01 just over 25 minutes this past Friday, it seemed
like a historic moment might happen in Los Angeles. The
No 17 Stanford men's soccer team (6-3-5, 1-2-2 Pacific
-10) was up I 0 against nemesis No. 7 UCLA (8-2-2,4-1-

0). After a tying goal was scored, another rarity — a
Stanford tie against UCLA — seemed possible until the
88th minute.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal could not hold on for the
last three minutes of regulation and they dropped the
game 2-1. The all-time record against the Bruins falls to
a disconcerting 3-25-2.
The fact that Stanford scored a goal against UCLA is
an accomplishment in itself. The Bruins had held the
Cardinal scoreless since the 2(H) 1 season. But this was not
the aim coming into Friday night's match; the objective
was an important Pac-10 victory. And unfortunately,
they could not deliver.
Stanford tallied the first goal of the match for the first
time in almost two weeks. After half an hour of dead
locked soccer, the Cardinal were awarded a free kick
about five yards outside the penalty area after a LJCLA
foul in the 31st minute. Senior forward Matt Janusz fired
a shot that ended up in the twine of the net.
The Cardinal have struggled to produce first-half at
tacks; Janusz's goal was only the fourth first-half goal of
