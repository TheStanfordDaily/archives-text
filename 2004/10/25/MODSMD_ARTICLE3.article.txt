## 
### 
1970s
Students and faculty at Stanford,
upset by the prospect of profiting
from apartheid and hoping to pres
sure the South African government to
change its position on the subject, de
manded that Stanford adopt a policy
of total divestment from companies
doing business in South Africa.
294 people were arrested in May
1977 at a demonstration in Old Union,
but there were no significant changes
to Stanford's investment policy.
The Trustees established a Presi
dential Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility with representation from
faculty, students, staff and alumni.
1980s
In 1986, Stanford had $200 million
invested in 66 companies that had ties
to South Africa. The investments rep
resented 13 percent of Stanford's
total share holdings.
In May 1986, the Board of Trustees
decided to make its first divestment on
ethical grounds, removing $9,900

from Newport Mining, which had not
responded to written inquiries con
cerning its policies in South Africa.
In Oct. 1986. the Board voted to
divest 30,600 shares, or $362,000,
from Diamond Shamrock after it
failed to honor a request to sell its in
terest in a South African subsidiary.
1990s
In 1995. Stanford students joined
students from 75 other universities in
a day of protest against military dicta
torship in Burma. Students dumped
out cans of Pepsi and staged sit-ins at
PepsiCo Inc.-owned subsidiaries such
as Taco Bell, seeking total divestment
of PepsiCo, the oil giant Unocal, and
other large US firms from Burma.
In the fall of 1996, 2,000 Stanford
students successfully blocked the
opening of a Taco Bell restaurant on
campus, in protest of PepsiCo's in
volvement in forced labor economic
projects in Burma.
PepsiCo announced its complete
withdrawal from Burma after Har
vard University turned down Pepsi
