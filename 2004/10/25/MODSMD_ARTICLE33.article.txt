# Inexperienced offensive line can't handle Ducks fierce pass rush
## 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Before the opening kickoff, the Oregon Duck
mascot went out onto the field and danced on the
Stanford "S" at the 50-yard line. And as soon as the
game started, the Oregon defensive line and
linebackers began dancing through the Cardinal's
young offensive line and into the backfield.
Stanford quarterbacks Trent Edwards and T.C.
Ostrander were sacked a season-high 10 times as
Oregon was able to ignore the threat of the run and
focus on the pass rush.
The Cardinal offensive line, which had only al
lowed 14 sacks in the first six games of the season,
was unable to stop the Oregon defensive line in
critical situations.
With Stanford trailing 16-13 late in the fourth
quarter, the Cardinal moved the ball to the Oregon
28 yard line after Duck tailback Terrence White
head fumbled and Haloti Ngata committed a 15-
yard facemask penalty. Following a Kenneth Tolon
run for no gain, Ostrander was sacked twice in a
row for losses of seven and nine yards. The sacks
moved the Cardinal out of field goal range and they
were forced to punt.
Edwards, who was sacked three times in the first
quarter, was taken out of the game when he was hit
as he threw by Oregon tackle Robby Valenzuela.
Edwards was diagnosed with a bruised shoulder
and hand, but it was wooziness that prevented him
from reentering the game.
Ostrander entered the game the after one drive
hy senior backup quarterback Ryan Eklund, which
resulted in only a field goal after it stalled in the red
zone.

Ostrander, a redshirt freshman who had seen ac
tion in both the San Jose State and BYU games,
had a good day passing, throwing for 236 yards and
one touchdown in three quarters of work.
"I felt pretty good out there. I was prepared to
go in there and play and got the opportunity," Os
trander said.
Ostrander often found himself surrounded by Duck
defenders before he had a chance to make a play.
"They brought some blitzes, and they were pret
ty tough. There were some times where 1 was hold
ing onto the ball longer than I should have," he said.
For the Cardinal, though, it was the failure to
maintain a balanced offensive attack that cost them
in the end.
The Cardinal had negative-eight rush yards in
the game, the sixth-lowest output in their history.
The tailback duo of Kenneth Tolon and J R.
Lemon accumulated only 51 yards on 17 carries,
forcing Stanford to go to the air in key situations.
"That's our main goal â€” to shut their rushing
attack down and force them to the air," Valenzuela
said. "Then they started passing, and that's when
the fun began."
Oregon also was able to capitalize on the injury
to Edwards.
"When (Ostrander] came into the game, it was
an advantage for us," said Oregon linebacker An
thony Trucks, who had one sack in the game.
"When a new quarterback comes into the game it
always takes him a while to see what we are doing
defensively. We blitzed and we were able to do
what we wanted to do."
Head coach Buddy Teevens praised the Oregon
defense.
" They're a pretty stout defensive group and they

hit us a couple of times at the quarterback posi
tion," he said. "I just give credit to Oregon's defen
sive front. They pushed the pocket pretty good."
Oregon did bring a lot of effective blitz pack
ages. overwhelming a young offensive line and
making it appear even younger.
Junior center Brian Head, the most experienced
member of the Cardinal offensive line, was un
available for the game due to injury and was re
placed by redshirt freshman Mikal Brewer.
The line featured four sophomores and one
freshman, leaving it without the on-field leadership
of a veteran starter.
"Today for the first time it felt like last year,"
said sophomore tackle Jeff Edwards. "It felt like we
took a step backwards fora half or so. They had a
few new schemes, and they executed well and at
times we did not."
Looking ahead to next week, the Cardinal face a
UCLA team that is last in the Pac-10 conference in
sacks, but toward the top of the conference in
points scored.
In a game that could be considered a must-win
for Stanford, the Cardinal won't be able to give up
scoring opportunities because of sacks.
Stanford was able to stay in the game because of
another solid defensive performance and some
amazing plays by receivers in critical situations, but
giving up 10 sacks against a high-scoring opponent
could be even more costly.
If Stanford is going to be a bowl contender, the
offensive line must protect the quarterback, like it
has done all season before the Oregon game.
If they don't, what looked like a possible break
out season for the Cardinal could end in disap
pointment.
