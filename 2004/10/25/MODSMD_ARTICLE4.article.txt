# 'Antenna Farm' lies fallow
## 
### MEG WALTNER 
A set of antennas off Highway 280 that
was once used to help land the first man on
the moon, is now a fire hazard marked for
demolition. The historic site has re-entered
the public eye as the University decides
what to do with the dilapidated and over
grown "antenna farm."
The "antenna farm." formally called Site
515, was built in the late 1 and original
ly consisted of 32 antennas, each 10 feet in
diameter. Five larger antennas, each about
60 feet in diameter, were added in 1970.
Now. what remain are the larger antennas,
the piers that the smaller antennas were
once docked on, a few buildings and what
electrical engineer and founder of the site
Ronald Bracewell calls an "impenetrable
thicket" surrounding it all.
It was this "impenetrable thicket" that
attracted the University fire inspector's at
tention and led him to call for clean-up and
demolition of Site 515 this past June at an es
timated cost of $100,000. But Chemical En
gineering Prof. Channing Robertson, who is
also the senior associate dean for faculty and
academic affairs in the school of engineer
ing, temporarily halted the plans because of
the antennas' historical significance.

A group of antennas built in the late 1950s by Stanford professors was set for demolition
after it was declared a fire hazard, but some have come forward with plans to restore it.
