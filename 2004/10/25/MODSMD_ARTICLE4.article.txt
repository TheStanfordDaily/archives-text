# 'Antenna Farm' lies fallow
## 
### MEG WALTNER 
A set of antennas off Highway 280 that
was once used to help land the first man on
the moon, is now a fire hazard marked for
demolition. The historic site has re-entered
the public eye as the University decides
what to do with the dilapidated and over
grown "antenna farm."
The "antenna farm." formally called Site
515, was built in the late 1 and original
ly consisted of 32 antennas, each 10 feet in
diameter. Five larger antennas, each about
60 feet in diameter, were added in 1970.
Now. what remain are the larger antennas,
the piers that the smaller antennas were
once docked on, a few buildings and what
electrical engineer and founder of the site
Ronald Bracewell calls an "impenetrable
thicket" surrounding it all.
It was this "impenetrable thicket" that
attracted the University fire inspector's at
tention and led him to call for clean-up and
demolition of Site 515 this past June at an es
timated cost of $100,000. But Chemical En
gineering Prof. Channing Robertson, who is
also the senior associate dean for faculty and
academic affairs in the school of engineer
ing, temporarily halted the plans because of
the antennas' historical significance.

A group of antennas built in the late 1950s by Stanford professors was set for demolition
after it was declared a fire hazard, but some have come forward with plans to restore it.

Bob Lash, a medical doctor, engineer and
amateur radio astronomer not connected
with Stanford, founded Friends of the
Bracewell Observatory Association in re
sponse to the proposed demolition of Site
515. Together with Electrical Engineering
Profs. David Leeson and Umran Inan, Lash
raised the $20,000 required by the School of
Engineering to stop the immediate demoli
tion in order to have time to develop a pro
posal for the site. Leesan donated $10,000 of
his own money.
Members of the community have until
June 30, 2005 to submit proposals. In the
mean time the overgrowth, on the site, de
clared a fire hazard, will be cleared.
Historical significance
The antennas were built by Electrical En
gineering Emeritus Prof. Ronald Newbold
Bracewell and members of Stanford's Space,
Telecommunications and Radioscience Lab
oratory, also called STAR Labs, to measure
radio waves given off by the sun. Today Inan
is the head of STAR Labs, a research group
within the Department of Electrical Engi
neering.

"The whole purpose [of the project] was
to make maps of the sun," Bracewell said.
STAR Labs measured waves given off
over the 11-year sun cycle. Although there
was previous knowledge of this cycle and the
fact that sunspots — active regions of the sun
— changed throughout this cycle, no one had
mapped it with the level of accuracy that
Bracewell was able to. Bracewell's antennas
were the first to reach the precision level of
the human eye.
The maps generated by the project were
important because sunspots can cause dan
gerous radiation flares. These types of flares,
for example, have stopped electricity flow
and are a threat to astronauts' safety in space.
NASA used the data collected from the
antennas in the 1960s to help land the first
man on the moon. NASA could predict when
the flares were going to take place and use
this knowledge to protect the astronauts;
when a flare would occur, astronauts would
go into a secure room within the spaceship.
Another important result of the project
was the algorithm that Bracewell developed
with colleagues in 1967. The algorithm was
used to turn the scans of the sun made by the
antennas into an image. This algorithm was

adopted for medical use in computer-assisted
tomography, or CAT. scanners.
"The original way [the CAT scanner func
tioned] was, you had to solve 180 simultane
ous equations, and that's enough to make
anybody gulp," Bracewell said.
Bracewell's algorithm drastically reduced
the time it took CAT scanners to produce an
image, from a couple of hours to almost in
stantaneously.
After the 11-year project of mapping the
sun ended, the 32 smaller dishes were sold to
Tay Howard, who was then a Stanford pro
fessor. Howard started up a business in the
growing satellite communication market. He
sold the dishes in the 19705. The smaller dish
es were eventually destroyed.
The five larger dishes continued to be
used fora short time on a project detecting
cosmic background radiation. After the pro
ject ended, the site fell into disuse.
Future of Site 515
The Friends of the Bracewell Observatory
Association hope to refurbish the site for
both public use and university research. The
association is working with Inan on apropos

al for submission to the University in June
that would benefit the community and cam
pus research.
The idea behind the proposal is that one or
two of the satellites will be used by Inan and
STAR Labs for collecting data from mi
crosatellites, while the others would be open
for research by the public.
The estimated cost of the proposal is
$35,000 for the first year to restore one satel
lite and $50,000 in subsequent years to con
tinue restoring satellites and maintain the
site.
According to Lash, the restoration of the
antennas is important because of their pre
sent value as research tools and their historic
value.
"It would be a tragedy for such an incred
ible resource to be demolished just because
of some dry brush that created a fire hazard,"
Lash said.
However, according to Inan, in the end
"the University has to make a decision
whether in the long term they want to use this
facility for this purpose." If the University
does not accept a restoration proposal, the
site will be cleared and the satellites demol
ished.
