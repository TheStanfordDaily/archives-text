# Prop 64: Popular with businesses, not voters
## 
### REBECCA LOWE 
Despite $ 16 million from propo
nents of Proposition 64, only 26
percent of voters support it, a new
statewide poll shows.
The measure, which would
place limits on an individual's right
to sue businesses under Califor
nia's Unfair Competition Law. was
opposed by 38 percent of the pub
lic, with 36 percent of voters still
undecided, according to the inde
pendent survey group The Field
Poll.
These figures follow a month
long advertising campaign by busi
nesses to rally support for the
proposition. Opponents, who have
raised under $1 million, believe a
$100,000 contribution made last
week by Philip Morris USA. a chief
proponent of the measure, is a sign
of desperation that both money
and time are running out to gain
the popular support needed to pass
the proposition.
"People should be aware that

the main support comes from big
businesses who have been hurt by
this law in the past," said Michael
Schmitz, environmental director
for the California League of Envi
ronmental Enforcement Now, in
an interview.
"This contribution speaks vol
umes. They pour money in because
it is all they have on their side."
Supporters of the measure claim
it will protect small businesses from
a loophole in the law that allows
lawyers to file lawsuits even when
they have no client or evidence that
anyone was damaged.
"This turns lawyers into bounty
hunters, stalking innocent small
businesses that create jobs and op
portunity in California," said Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, a main
proponent of the proposition, in a
Sept. 10 speech in which he en
dorsed the proposition.
Stanford law student Andrea
Manka said that a more moderate
Debate centers on whether existing Calif,
law is powerful tool or unfair hindrance

solution to close the alleged loophole
should be explored.
"I think the law will solve the prob
lem of unethical lawyers," she said.
"But perhaps it goes too far."
Opponents say the Unfair Compe
tition Law is the most powerful tool
held by consumer, environmental,
public health and privacy groups to
protect themselves from business
abuses. An analysis by the nonprofit
consumer group Election Watchdog
found that Schwarzenegger has ac
cepted $2.4 million from companies,
including Safeway, Pfizer and Exxon
Mobil, that also gave $2.8 million to
Prop. 64.
Mike Spence, chairman of the Cal
ifornia Republican Association and a
chief advocate for the measure, said in
an interview that it is common sense to
limit prosecution to those who have
suffered some degree of injury or fi
nancial loss.
Spence argues that there are state

laws protecting the environment, pub
lic health and personal privacy. He
also says that the proposed law would
not hinder legitimate lawsuits involv
ing these issues.
James Wheaton, journalism law
professor at Stanford and president of
the Environmental Law Foundation,
dismissed Spence's claims as "mad
ness" in an interview last week.
"There are some state laws, but the
number which allow for private indi
viduals and groups to enforce those
laws are very, very few," he said.
Wheaton could only think of three
laws permitting private individuals to
sue businesses. One of these — and
the only one specifically protecting the
environment — was the California
Environmental Quality Act.
But Wheaton said that CEQA does
not cover laws protecting the coast,
air, water, consumer products and en
dangered species.
These arguments make little differ

ence to businesses that have been hit
by the Unfair Competition Law — or
17200, as it is also known.
Children of the Night, a nonprofit
that helps child prostitutes on the
street find food and shelter, had to set
tle for $33,000 after it refused to dis
close clients' confidential information
to lawyers suing them for misleading
advertising.
Wheaton claims, however, that in
stances of misuse are rare. He and
Schmitz allege that over its 70-year
history, the law has been abused by
only a few firms, and all were pun
ished.
Spence sees the situation differently.
"Should we wait until there are 100
or 200 cases before we agree to correct
the law?" he asked.
Those opposing the measure deny
that Prop. 64 is about correcting the
law. Wheaton and Schmitz do not
deny there are problems, but say there
are better solutions. They claim that

businesses have continually stifled
proposed amendments to improve
17200.
"The businesses refused to negoti
ate," said Wheaton. "They don't want
a solution. They want to kill the rights
of all consumer groups."
John H. Sullivan, chairman of the
Civil Justice Association, said in an in
terview that California is the only state
that allows a person to sue without ev
idence of injury.
"This is because the trial lawyer
lobby has squelched all proposed re
forms," he said over the phone.
Wheaton did not deny that he has a
vested interest in "squelching" the
proposition.
"Yes, I plead guilty to that accusa
tion," he said. "Anyone interested in
clean water, safe products, protecting
their privacy and protecting con
sumers from fraudulent businesses
you could say has a vested interest. So
ves I do."

nents of Proposition 64, only 26
percent of voters support it, a new
statewide poll shows.
The measure, which would
place limits on an individual's right
to sue businesses under Califor
nia's Unfair Competition Law. was
opposed by 38 percent of the pub
lic, with 36 percent of voters still
undecided, according to the inde
pendent survey group The Field
Poll.
These figures follow a month
long advertising campaign by busi
nesses to rally support for the
proposition. Opponents, who have
raised under $1 million, believe a
$100,000 contribution made last
week by Philip Morris USA. a chief
proponent of the measure, is a sign
of desperation that both money
and time are running out to gain
the popular support needed to pass
the proposition.
"People should be aware that

the main support comes from big
businesses who have been hurt by
this law in the past," said Michael
Schmitz, environmental director
for the California League of Envi
ronmental Enforcement Now, in
an interview.
"This contribution speaks vol
umes. They pour money in because
it is all they have on their side."
Supporters of the measure claim
it will protect small businesses from
a loophole in the law that allows
lawyers to file lawsuits even when
they have no client or evidence that
anyone was damaged.
"This turns lawyers into bounty
hunters, stalking innocent small
businesses that create jobs and op
portunity in California," said Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, a main
proponent of the proposition, in a
Sept. 10 speech in which he en
dorsed the proposition.
Stanford law student Andrea
Manka said that a more moderate
Debate centers on whether existing Calif,
law is powerful tool or unfair hindrance

solution to close the alleged loophole
should be explored.
"I think the law will solve the prob
lem of unethical lawyers," she said.
"But perhaps it goes too far."
Opponents say the Unfair Compe
tition Law is the most powerful tool
held by consumer, environmental,
public health and privacy groups to
protect themselves from business
abuses. An analysis by the nonprofit
consumer group Election Watchdog
found that Schwarzenegger has ac
cepted $2.4 million from companies,
including Safeway, Pfizer and Exxon
Mobil, that also gave $2.8 million to
Prop. 64.
Mike Spence, chairman of the Cal
ifornia Republican Association and a
chief advocate for the measure, said in
an interview that it is common sense to
limit prosecution to those who have
suffered some degree of injury or fi
nancial loss.
Spence argues that there are state

laws protecting the environment, pub
lic health and personal privacy. He
also says that the proposed law would
not hinder legitimate lawsuits involv
ing these issues.
James Wheaton, journalism law
professor at Stanford and president of
the Environmental Law Foundation,
dismissed Spence's claims as "mad
ness" in an interview last week.
"There are some state laws, but the
number which allow for private indi
viduals and groups to enforce those
laws are very, very few," he said.
Wheaton could only think of three
laws permitting private individuals to
sue businesses. One of these — and
the only one specifically protecting the
environment — was the California
Environmental Quality Act.
But Wheaton said that CEQA does
not cover laws protecting the coast,
air, water, consumer products and en
dangered species.
These arguments make little differ

ence to businesses that have been hit
by the Unfair Competition Law — or
17200, as it is also known.
Children of the Night, a nonprofit
that helps child prostitutes on the
street find food and shelter, had to set
tle for $33,000 after it refused to dis
close clients' confidential information
to lawyers suing them for misleading
advertising.
Wheaton claims, however, that in
stances of misuse are rare. He and
Schmitz allege that over its 70-year
history, the law has been abused by
only a few firms, and all were pun
ished.
Spence sees the situation differently.
"Should we wait until there are 100
or 200 cases before we agree to correct
the law?" he asked.
Those opposing the measure deny
that Prop. 64 is about correcting the
law. Wheaton and Schmitz do not
deny there are problems, but say there
are better solutions. They claim that

businesses have continually stifled
proposed amendments to improve
17200.
"The businesses refused to negoti
ate," said Wheaton. "They don't want
a solution. They want to kill the rights
of all consumer groups."
John H. Sullivan, chairman of the
Civil Justice Association, said in an in
terview that California is the only state
that allows a person to sue without ev
idence of injury.
"This is because the trial lawyer
lobby has squelched all proposed re
forms," he said over the phone.
Wheaton did not deny that he has a
vested interest in "squelching" the
proposition.
"Yes, I plead guilty to that accusa
tion," he said. "Anyone interested in
clean water, safe products, protecting
their privacy and protecting con
sumers from fraudulent businesses
you could say has a vested interest. So
ves I do."
