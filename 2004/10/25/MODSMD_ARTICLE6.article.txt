# Prop 64: Popular with businesses, not voters
## 
### REBECCA LOWE 
Despite $ 16 million from propo
nents of Proposition 64, only 26
percent of voters support it, a new
statewide poll shows.
The measure, which would
place limits on an individual's right
to sue businesses under Califor
nia's Unfair Competition Law. was
opposed by 38 percent of the pub
lic, with 36 percent of voters still
undecided, according to the inde

Poll.
These figures follow a month
long advertising campaign by busi

proposition. Opponents, who have
raised under $1 million, believe a
$100,000 contribution made last
week by Philip Morris USA. a chief
proponent of the measure, is a sign
of desperation that both money
and time are running out to gain
the popular support needed to pass
the proposition.
"People should be aware that

the main support comes from big
businesses who have been hurt by
this law in the past," said Michael
Schmitz, environmental director
for the California League of Envi
ronmental Enforcement Now, in
an interview.
"This contribution speaks vol
umes. They pour money in because
it is all they have on their side."
Supporters of the measure claim
it will protect small businesses from
a loophole in the law that allows
lawyers to file lawsuits even when
they have no client or evidence that
anyone was damaged.
"This turns lawyers into bounty
hunters, stalking innocent small
businesses that create jobs and op
portunity in California," said Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, a main
proponent of the proposition, in a
Sept. 10 speech in which he en
dorsed the proposition.
