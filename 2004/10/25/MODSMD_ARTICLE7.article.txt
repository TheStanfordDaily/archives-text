# Police cut off 'sinful' Casa party
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The theme of the party was "Sin City,"
hut some of the "sins" — such as sneaking
through windows — committed by students
who attended the overcrowded party at
Casa Italiana on Saturday night prompted
police to break up the festivities before 1
a.m.
Once underway, the "Sin City" party, one
of the only ail-campus parties on campus this
weekend, rapidly filled with throngs of stu
dents. Attendees said that the rooms at Casa
Italiana were especially crowded between
11:30 p.m. and midnight.
The overcrowding led some people to
leave.
Freshman James Francescone arrived at
around 11 p.m., when entry into the party was
not yet restricted, but left before the police
broke up the party.
"I went to the party with a group of friends,
but we left once it got really crowded,"
Francescone said. "Actually, the security peo
ple had to bring me and a couple of my friends
around back to get us out because the front
door was so jammed."
Senior Sara Weekly waited outside Casa
Italiana for over 20 minutes before being al
lowed inside.
"We didn't know what was going on,"
Weekly said. "Most of the other entrances
were being monitored by a bouncer, but peo
ple were being ridiculous and pushing their

way in anyway. It was pretty
crowded inside, but not the worst
I've seen at a party. Also, Casa
staff did a really good job keep
ing non-residents in the lounge /
kitchen area and away from the
private rooms upstairs."
Other students, unable to
enter through the front door,
found alternative means to gain
access to the party.
"The party was extremely
crowded and almost impossible
to get through at the front door,"
said one freshman, who asked to
remain anonymous. "1 actually
snuck in with a group of people
around back. By the time I left, I
think the cops were catching on
to the fact that people were
sneaking in, so that may be a rea
son why the party was broken
up."
Stanford Police responded to
phone calls of disturbances be
tween Casa Italiana security staff

and students trying to enter the
party. They broke up the party at
approximately 12:45 a.m.
"We were responding to a
crowd-control problem," Sgt.
David Lee of Stanford's Depart
ment of Public Safety said. "Peo
ple were having trouble trying to
enter the party and were creat
ing confrontations between
themselves and the front-door
security."
According to Lee, after Casa
Italiana staff closed the front
door entrance, students contin
ued to sneak into the house
through open windows.
"The police are responsible
for keeping the peace and for en
forcing the law and maintaining
public safety," said Sgt. Hilary
Karp, also of Stanford's Depart
ment of Public Safety.
"If we see a situation that may
be a potential hazard, then we as
sess the particular circumstance

and act accordingly, in order to
maintain public safety."
Most students were not overly
shocked at the party's fate.
"1 was upstairs when the po
lice came, but I heard some
commotion going on down
stairs." Weekly said. "The DJ
just announced that things were
shutting down, and after the last
song, most people just trickled
out."
Though the police formally
shut down the party, they mainly
relied on Casa Italiana staff to
carry out the task of ending the
party.
"We came to assist the secu
rity staff and basically stayed
outside of the house." Lee said.
"The Casa Italiana security
and staff members did a good
job of identifying the problems
during the party, and they did a
good job of closing down the
party."
