NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT TO US THAN THE FUTURE OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN
• We will vote for John F. Kerry for President because we don't want
our children and grandchildren to inherit a quagmire in Iraq. Unlike
George Bush, John Kerry can work with other countries to end the
war and build a coalition for peace.
• We support John F. Kerry because we don't want our
grandchildren living in endless war and fear After the election, it is
possible to draft aU men and women age 18-26.
• We will vote for John. F. Kerry because we want the wealthiest
Americans to pay their fair share now so our grandchildren are not
saddled with a growing deficit they will have to pay all of their lives.
• We support John F. Kerry because everyone's grandchildren
should attend good schools, breathe clean air, drink clean water
and have decent, affordable health care.
• We know that our fellow grandparents in tightly contested states
feel the same way we do. So help us spread this message tp as
many people as possible. Please send this ad to your relatives and
friends in the swing states. Ask them to run it in their local
newspaper.
• We must change horses in midstream before George Bush's
incompetent leadership drowns us all.
