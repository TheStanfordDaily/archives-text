### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
trumpeted his support for Steve
Poizner, the Republican candidate
for State Assembly, at a press con
ference in Menlo Park yesterday.
Schwarzenegger's 15-minute
speech to a crowd of approximate
ly 200 Poizner supporters focused
on the similarities between himself
and Poizner, a wealthy political
newcomer who is currently locked
in a statistical dead heat with De
mocrat Ira Ruskin.
"Steve and I have a lot in com
mon, [but] unlike what people say,

the body is not what we have in
common," Schwarzenegger said.
Instead, the governor pointed to
their shared belief in bipartisan
ship as instrumental in solving the
state's problems.
Poizner, who graduate from the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness in 1980, is running as a fiscal
conservative and social moderate
who, like the governor, breaks with
the Republican platform on issues
like abortion and stem cell re
search. Also, Schwarzenegger
pointed out. "He has married a De
mocratic wife; if vou know you can

be bipartisan at home, you know
you can be bipartisan all the way
around."
Schwarzenegger compared
Poizner's campaign to his own run
for governor last year, citing his
independence from special inter
ests.
"If you're an outsider, and if you
have money of your own, you can
not be bought," he said.
"[Poizner] can laugh at the spe
cial interests when they say 'We're
going to give you $25,000 for your
campaign, and in return you can do
this and that for me,' like I have
done for the last year because I will
never do anything in return for
money, and he will never do any
thing for money," Schwarzenegger
said.

Poizner welcomed the gover
nor's comparisons.
"The thing I like the most is
when [reporters) call me a
Schwarzenegger Republican," he
added.
Poizner has poured over $4.5
million of his own money into the
campaign, outspending his Democ
ratic rival nearly four-to-one, ac
cording to the Associated Press. He
earned his fortune in Silicon Val
ley, founding two technology com
panies. Last year, he began work
ing as a volunteer schoolteacher at
Mount Pleasant High School in San
Jose.
"It's been a great opportunity to
create a competitive race here,"
Poizner said of his campaign, which
has presented a real challenge to

Ruskin, a career politician with 20
years of experience, who was fa
vored early in the race. The 21st
district, which covers Santa Clara
and San Mateo counties, is heavily
Democratic.
"At my first event 14 months
ago, we had three people show up
for the meet and greet â€” two of
them worked for me, and my wife,"
Poizner said. "So the campaign has
progressed quite nicely."
The governor ended his speech
with a personal appeal to voters.
"There is a massive weight we must
lift up from our state. Alone 1 can
not lift it, but together we can,"
Schwarzenegger said. "That is why
I am here to campaign for him; be
cause I need him in Sacramento."
