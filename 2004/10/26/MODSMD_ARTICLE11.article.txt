# Win your way to being your own boss

### SU FEN LEE DESK EDITOR 
When sophomore Jim Osial par
ticipated in the BASES E-Chal
ienge last year, he envisioned cre
ating a company that automates
the grant process for localities that
apply for and receive federal and
state grant funding. But he did not
anticipate that his idea. General Fi
nancial Services, would become a
reality.
Not only did the competition
award him and his team a second
place prize of $20,000, but he said it
also sparked within him an im
mense interest in entrepreneurship.
This year, Osial is involved in
the BASES E-Challenge once
again — not as a participant, but as
a member of the organizing team.
The E-Challenge, or Entrepre
neur's Challenge, is an annual busi
ness-plan competition conducted by
the Business Association of Stan
ford Engineering Students, better
known on campus as BASES.
"I wanted to be involved in orga
nizing [the event) this year because
I knew it was the best way to be in
volved in entrepreneurship at Stan
ford," Osial said. "I hope that my
involvement in BASES will allow
me to start my own venture later on
in my life."
Osial is well on his way to start.
His General Finance Services is
currently undergoing preparations
to formally become a company.
In fact, one of the most notable
results of Stanford's E-Challenge
is the many companies that have
sprouted out of this competition.
Past winners' ventures that have
gone on to become companies in
clude Voltage Security, a 2002
winner, and Ingenuity, a 1998
winner.
According to Osial, nearly all fi
nalists afterward attempt to start
up their company "for real."

"After all, their idea has been
validated by some of the leading
entrepreneurs and venture capital
ists in the country," he said.
"The wonderful thing about the
E-Challenge is it brings together
people from all corners of Stan
ford," he added. "A traditional
team usually has one or two MBA
students, a couple engineers, some
Med School students if it is a phar
maceutical or health care idea, and
maybe even a law student. Profes
sors have also been on teams. The
only requirement for entry is that
half the team be affiliated with
Stanford as a student, professor or
full-time staff."
Last year's winning team, Micro-
Drop, is an example of the typically
diverse backgrounds from which
team participants come. Micro-
Drop was composed of Ron Gut
man, an MBA candidate at the
Graduate School of Business, and
Utkan Demirci, an electrical engi
neering doctoral candidate.
Gutman and Demirci's plan
aimed to create a company that
uses Demirci's doctoral work and a
Stanford-patented technology to
produce devices for generating mi
crodroplets — extremely small
water droplets — needed for semi
conductor manufacture and drug
testing and design.
But the BASES E-Challenge is
diverse not only with respect to par
ticipants' affiliations to Stanford.
The business ideas that participants
propose also come from a wide
range of disciplines, including IT
services, software, healthcare, phar
maceuticals, medical devices, con
sumer products and manufacturing.
Among the accomplishments of
last year's team winners, Micro-
Drop created a new type of micro
processor that is more productive
and efficient than past designs.
Zarnyx created a device that can be
implanted into the larynx to prevent

fluid from flowing down it. prevent
ing a certain cause of strokes.
This year's E-Challenge theme
is "Startup Your Dream." Accord
ing to Osial, the organizing team for
the event chose this theme because
"it clearly and concisely gets across
the goals of the E-Challenge."
" 'Startup' can be interpreted
both in the sense of 'starting up a
company' — that is, get it going —
and doing a 'startup,' a word which
has gained a special kind of conno
tation here in the Silicon Valley
since the dot-com era," he added.

In conjunction with the competi
tion, BASES is also holding a series
of workshops open to the public.
Starting this November and run
ning until the end of the academic
year, a series of education and prac
tical seminars related to different
aspects of developing a business
plan and entrepreneurship will be
offered to the community.
"The speakers we present give
talks on a variety of topics that are
both useful for and applicable to
the E-Challenge," Osial said.
"They give talks on everything

from what makes a strong, viable
business plan to what venture capi
talists look for in a presentation.
We try to cover every aspect of the
E-Challenge with the talks."
The E-Challenge will officially
kick off tomorrow at Cubberley
Auditorium. Starting at 6 p.m., the
first workshop will feature Vinod
Khosla, general partner and ven
ture capitalist of Kleiner Perkins
Caufield Byers.
KPCB will also be involved in
the first of the workshop series on
Nov. 10. Entitled "Creating and
Evaluating Your Business Idea,"
associate partners of KPCB will be
invited to evaluate any potential
business ideas from prospective
participants. This workshop will be
held at 7 p.m. at the Graduate
School of Business in Room SlBO.
Throughout the year, participants
can also take part in a mentorship
program to meet prominent mem
bers of the entrepreneurial commu
nity, including Eric Benhamou,
chairman of 3COM and Palm, Guy
Kawasaki, chairman and managing
director of Garage Technology Ven
tures, and Heidi Roizen, managing
director of Mobius Venture Capital.
For many participants, the most
attractive part of the E-Challenge
is being able to turn their ideas into
reality. A $25,000 grand prize will
be awarded and another $25,000
will be split among the remaining
finalists so the top teams can pur
sue their entrepreneurial plans.
While the prize money might
seem like a huge sum, many would
consider it small payback for the
amount of time that competing in
the event requires. Last year, when
Osial participated in the competi
tion, he spent an average of 25 to 30
hours a week preparing. His work
load was even heavier during
weeks when deadlines loomed.
"Every member of every team is
putting in the tremendous amount

of work the competition requires
because they are so passionate
about their idea and they would
love nothing more than to see it
materialize," Osial said.
Participating teams have to sub
mit a three-page executive summa
ry in the first round in winter. In
the second round, teams submit a
12-to-15-page business plan, fol
lowed by a seven-minute Power
point presentation. Teams that get
into the final round in spring have
to submit a revised business plan.
They also have to make a 14-
minute Powerpoint presentation to
a panel of venture capitalists.
"The size of the competition is
growing every year," Osial said.
"Over the past couple years, 50 to
60 teams have competed on aver
age. Traditionally, 12 to 15 teams
make the second round, which is at
the discretion of the judges."
Criteria for judging winners in
clude: the size of the market the
idea will penetrate and the need for
the product or idea in that market;
the strength of the team and its
qualifications for running the busi
ness; the clarity, persuasiveness
and professionalism of the business
plan and presentation; and the abil
ity for the company to be a viable
company and survive the difficult
start-up period in order to grow.
For prospective participants,
Osial had this advice to share;
"Pick a team you will be able to
work well with. This is maybe even
more important than picking the
most qualified people. Participants
are going to be spending an enor
mous amount of high-stress, high
tension time with each other and
the team has to be able to survive in
order for the idea to."
"Also," he added, "never expect
anything less than the best. Other
entries won't, and the judges cer
tainly won't."
