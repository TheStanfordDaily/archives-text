# Bush ups funding for science and technology ventures
## Kerry's view to take center stage tomorrow at Gates 
### BETSY CONGDON 
John Kerry has tried to contrast
himself with George W. Bush during
the presidential campaign by pre
senting himself as the candidate who
believes in science, but CSL Collo
quium's "Science and Technology
Policy I: The Bush View" last
Wednesday reminded students that
Bush has his own set of policy goals
that embrace scientific discovery.
E. Floyd Kvamme, a co-chair of
the President's Council of Advisors
in Science and Technology, board
member of many tech firms and for
mer executive vice president at
Apple Computer, spoke on the role
science and technology has played
in the current Bush administration.
What is PCAST?
PCAST is a council that advises
the president through the Office of
Science and Technology Policy.
Kvamme has served under Presi
dent Bush on this council since
March 2001 and said that the presi
dent is extremely open to science
and technology.
Not everyone agrees on this.
Senior chemistry major Steven
Kwan argued that "for [Bush), reli
gion is more important than sci
ence, and economic views and
more important than anything."
The role of the PCAST has be
come dramatically more important
in the last few years because the
number of bills dealing with technol-

ogy has risen ex
ponentially.
Kvamme said
that Bush be
lieves that the
committee's main
goal is to work
with hard topics
that have long
solutions.
Issues studied by
PCAST
In the past few
years, PCAST
has dealt with re
search and devel
opment funding,
energy sources,
broadband, ter
rorism, the tech
workforce, nan
otech and coop
eration between
the federal gov
ernment, as well
as the United
States and the
rest of the world.
The federal
budget for re
search and devel
opment is "the
highest since the
days of Apollo,"
according to

From the Office of Science and Technology Policy

Kvamme. There has been a 44-per
cent increase in th s area of the
budget under Bush.
However, many students feel

that their future in a science field
does not depend on who is in the
White House.
As Republican Avishai Weiss

stated, "Bush or Kerry, it won't suf
ficiently change the amount of
money [for funding)."
Weiss said claimed that science

played close to no
role in his polit
ical decision,
but he did admit
that he is excited
about Bush's $14
million pledge to
NASA.
In 2005, the re
search and devel
opment budget
reached $135 bil
lion, with most of
the increase in
money going to
ward hard sci
ences. Bush hopes
that this rise in
funds in research
will equate to
more jobs in the
future.
Hot topics
Kvamme also
talked about two
hot topics in this
election: stem-cell
research and the
greenhouse effect.
In August 2001,
President Bush
signed a bill stat
ing that only the
22 existing lines of
stem cells could be

used in research. Many saw this move
as a ban on stem cells, but Kvamme
disagreed and said he is worried about
the public's perceptions regarding this

research. He said that stem cell re
search will take time to fully develop
no matter how many cell lines are
used.
Freshman chemistry major
YunXiang Chu agreed that politics
will not interfere with science in the
long run: "Scientists will always over
come the barriers set by politicians,
and the government's only role in re
search is to provide funding."
The future
Kvamme offered, "I believe that
a fuel cell car will be the first car of
a child born today."
Also, he said he believes that com
panies must work harder to attract
students to science and technology.
Through personal research,
Kvamme found that over 50 percent of
the Fortune 100 firms are run by peo
ple with a technical background. He
said that he thought companies should
have open houses at their workplaces.
"You got to show them the
places," Kvamme said. "Students
should be able to see the companies
where they would be working."
Next colloquium
Tomorrow, in NEC Auditorium
in the Gates Building at 4:15 p.m..
Burton Richter. professor of physi
cal sciences and director emeritus of
SLAC, will speak about his experi
ence advising the Kerry campaign.
He will present Kerry's views as a
contrast to Bush's outlook.
