## Editorial SCID raises some valid points 
### 
On Oct. 13, the Stanford Coalition for
Investment Disclosure sent a letter to
the Stanford Management Company
demanding two things: first, that the
endowment managers disclose their invest
ments; second, that the managers insist upon
openness in the companies they invest in.
While there is little harm in disclosing Stan
ford's own investments, the endowment man
agers should not have to insist upon transparen
cy in the companies that they invest in Among
other things, this would likely diminish the re
turns on the endowment.
In a letter, SCID expressed concern about
the negative social impact of some of Stanford's
investments, claiming that one of them, Faral
lon. is a secretive company that is damaging the
environment.
We agree with SCID's first demand â€” the
Stanford Management Company should disclose
its major investments, whether they be in mutu
al funds, bonds or hedge funds. Those affiliated
with the University should keep the endowment
managers accountable to the investment deci
sions they make.
We agree that the endowment should not in
vest in corporations that are, operating unethi
cally, even if it is profitable to do so.
However, we believe SCID's second demand
is unreasonable. Demanding openness in corpo
rations that the endowment managers choose to
invest in is simply unrealistic.
Many companies have legitimate business-re
lated reasons for maintaining their secrecy.
They should not be required to bend the rules or
compromise their security by one of their in
vestors.
Venture capital and hedge funds, for exam
ple. conceal information to prevent competitors
from stealing their ideas and cutting into their
profits. Additionally, hedge funds often make
many transactions, and having to deal with a lot
of paperwork regarding disclosure would likely
impose a financial burden that would compro-

mise their profitability.
The riskier funds Stanford invests in often
have very high rates of return for the Universi
ty. If the endowment managers required trans
parency, not only would these funds not honor
the demands, but Stanford would likely lose ac
cess to valuable deals.
Although SCID insists on investments that
are both transparent and profitable, those two
qualities usually do not come together in suc
cessful corporations.
The only existing mechanism for monitoring
the University's investments is the Advisory
Panel for Investment Responsibility, composed
of students and faculty, which is charged with
reviewing and researching allegations of uneth
ical practices by companies in the endowment.
These recommendations are then passed to a
subcommittee of the Board of Trustees, which
makes investment policy recommendations to
the full Board.
SCID brings up a valid point when it questions
how effective the APIR actually is. It is unclear
whether the panel is fulfilling its mandate, hut
even if it is, it has failed to communicate its actions
with the community at large.
We must keep in mind that the ultimate goal
of the endowment is to raise money for Univer
sity programs. The money that is invested plays
a crucial role in financial aid, and operating and
construction costs: it insures the survival of
Stanford for generations to come.
In its demands, SCID must be realistic and
realize that complete information from corpora
tions in which the University has invested is
highly unrealistic for all practical purposes. It is
impractical to expect endowment mangers to
micromanage all of their investments to make
sure that every action they take is ethical.
Yet the University should not take SCID's
demands lightly. Either through disclosure or
reform of the APIR. the University must assure
us that it is practicing ethical investing.
