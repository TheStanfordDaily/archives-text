# Student Pet Peeves
## Since when did tips become expected? 
### YAMANDA WRIGHT 
Here in college, pizza becomes a
staple of life. All you really need to
survive the first week of classes is a
loofah, chocolate-covered espresso
beans and pepperoni Dominoes. The
pyramid order of dorm essentials
goes oxygen, pizza, caffeine, con
doms. Anything else marks
overindulgence.
So as a starving student without a
car, when ridiculous extra charges
are attached to the pizza delivery ser
vice on which my very existence de
pends, it threatens my way of life —
and I don't appreciate it.
A week ago. I went in on an extra
large pizza with a few friends (and by
"friends" I mean the first three peo
ple walking past my room to fork
over $5). The chef for my house has
Saturdays and Sundays off, and after
two weekends of cold Progresso
soup, cranberry juice and badly
bruised bananas, my mouth began to
water at the mention of chewable,
identifiable meat on a Saturday.
We ordered the pizza and waited .
.. and we waited ... and waited ...
until, lo and behold, sketchy delivery
guy shuffles up the stairs an hour and
a half late, sweat driplets dangling

ominously from his eyebrow over the
opened pizza box. Hold the salt,
please, Mr. Melodramatic.
"I'm so sorry," he says with wild
hand gestures, panting in mock flus
ter. "I was already running late and
then I couldn't get in your front door.
You didn't answer the phone and no
one was in the lounge to let me in."
Unfortunately for him, I lost my
sense of empathy for late people with
my jean Union Bay wallet in the
ninth grade. He hands over the box,
takes my twenty-dollar bill and piv
ots as if to walk away.
STOP, REWIND. Since when did
tips become automatic?
As if it isn't annoying enough that
so many restaurants in California au
tomatically add tip regardless of the
grade of service, to add insult to in
jury, have we gotten to the point
where we don't even pretend that
quality matters? When the hell did
gratuity become obligatory?
You sec, the whole concept of tip
ping is that it should be something
you want to do, like philanthropy or
scuba diving, not a sort of morality
stick on which to measure your good
ness. How would you like it if, while
walking along the shore in Montego
Bay, your best friend pushed your

head under the water whenever she
felt like it?
If the service is excellent, the ser
vice is excellent. It does not require a
tip, though it may deserve one. We all
know that delivery people and wait
ers are overworked and underpaid,
partly because their bosses expect
them to receive tips. But that is an
oversight on the part of their man
agers and not a determinant of my
personal kindness.
In blaming the customer, we at
tach a status symbol to tipping that
totally negates its purpose. It should
be selfless. Otherwise, we become at
tached to it for approval, mechanical
ly shelling out an extra 15 percent re
gardless of the quality of the service
like 25-year-old crack addicts.
Sure, it was daring and glamorous
and badass in their youth, but now
it's just pathetic. The same way it's
just you in the dark alley behind a
cheap restaurant with bloodshot eyes
and bruised arms, handing out $5.00
bills like candy, hurting no one but
yourself.
