# Sketch: Tales of Graduate Student Life
## Grad school... Where parties go to die 
### 
I can always tell that a new year
has started when my inbox is
clogged with invitations to
events designed to herd reluc
tant graduate students into sociabil
ity. They all have the same earnest
tone of: "Come and meet your
neighbors!" Sometimes there's a
variation: "Meet your neighbors.
Come on!"
Being exhorted to socialize gen
erally gets my hackles up, largely
because I don't like being reminded
that even though I'm well past my
teenage years. I still need help mak
ing friends.
To the credit of the lovely people
who organize these events, they do
manage to arrange a variety of dif
ferent offerings, from "cheese and
wine" to "wine and cheese." Per
sonally, I prefer the latter, but it's al
ways better to have the choice.
In addition to these sophisticated
mingling affairs, there is also a real
effort to exploit the legendary fond
ness of graduate students for free
food. Such events are heavily at
tended since, when it comes to free
food, grads are single-minded like
gerbils in heat (though obviously
most of us aren't small and furry).
The problem here, of course, is
that everybody's too focused on sus
tenance and how to smuggle out
enough pizza to last the week. And,
let's face it. no strapping young man
from Alabama is going to find you
attractive if you're gorging yourself
on the last piece of pepperoni and
cheese.
Away from the junk food, the
wine and the cheese, there are the
crazy, fun, fun parties. And what
parties they are. The excitement.
The noise. The sticky floors. The
cheap booze in red plastic cups. The
badly dressed electrical engineers.
The naked dancing girls. Okay, so I
made the last one up, but I live in
hope.
None of this would be that bad
(though if you are in EE you should
maybe think about a wardrobe
change) except for the fact that we
should have passed this stage of our
lives by now. A couple of weekends
ago, we had the social event of the
season, the Graduate Center Open
ing Party.
I'm still traumatized. It felt like I
had stepped into some kind of night
marish time warp, taking me back to
my first school disco, aged 14. De
pressingly, even my ability to talk to
girls doesn't appear to have ad
vanced in the intervening decade.

The only thing that's changed is
that now instead sipping cheap or
ange squash (that's Kool-Aid in
American) we got to try and extract
beer from cups full of foam. Such a
fulfilling way to spend a Friday
night.
It concerns me that Fm still get
ting my kicks dancing around in cir-

cles despite the
fact that Fm ap
proaching my
mid-20s. Back in
the day, I pictured
this stage of my
life being full of
elegant parties,
sophisticated din
ners and lots of
money. Well, I
guess zero out of
three isn't so bad.

Actually. I'm being a little unfair.
1 don't really mind this sort of party
— in fact they were the lifeblood of
my undergraduate days — it's just
very upsetting that they are now the
pinnacle of my social life. I spent
weeks getting excited about going to
the opening of a shiny and sterile
new shed with delusions of
grandeur.
This sort of thing is all very well
for the children, but 1 want more.
Give me my drink in a glass, take
away the wristbands and have ev
erything happen in a venue that
doesn't serve as a yoga room by day
light.
The most upsetting thing about
this column is that I wrote it three
weeks ago about a completely dif
ferent party. Despite that. I only had
to change of couple of sentences in
order to update the subject matter.
Such is the variety of our social ac
tivity.
Having tried to achieve excite
ment by going out, and having
failed, 1 think I might try staying in.
I have a friend who suggested find
ing happiness through knitting and
baking. I'm not really sure whether
this is the best way forward, but if
anybody has an interesting pattern
fora scarf or a good chocolate cake
recipe that they'd like to share, let
me know.
