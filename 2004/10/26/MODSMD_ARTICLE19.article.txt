Epstein's speech represented the
two truths to Middle East conflict
When Hedy Epstein came to
speak on campus last Wednesday,
she did not come to demonizc Israel
or to glorify Palestine. Epstein's
message was an appeal to the Amer
ican people to endeavor to find the
truth about the Palestine-Israel situ
ation. and to warn them that her ex
periences made her believe that the
media here is not as free as we are
made to believe.
She did not make a value judg
ment about the situation, but in fact
urged the audience members to
travel to the region and form an
opinion of the conflict through
what they see for themselves, just
as she did.

It is sad that some members of
the audience aimed to silence such a
powerful message by intimidating,
harassing and shouting at her
throughout her presentation.
Since when has ignorance be
come a value to uphold? The cam
pustruth.org ads last year tried to
portray the image that there are
"two sides to every story, but only
one truth." Epstein merely remind
ed the audience that there were two
truths to the conflict.
The path to resolution for any
dispute opens with an acknowledg
ment of the injustices that comprise
it. Therefore, it is imperative to real
ize that it is not only Israeli, but
Palestinian children too that suffer
from the crisis.
While 114 Israelis children have

died since September 2000. 642
Palestinian children have been
killed, including a 13-year-old girl
who was recently shot by Israeli sol
diers on her way to school. Palestini
ans have nothing to protect them
from the bulldozers that knock their
houses down and the gunfire of
troops that has now become a part
of their daily lives.
Every human life is equal, and
the only moral thing to do is to treat
every human life as such. The same
respect and honor must be accorded
to every Palestinian life that is lost,
as to every Israeli.
By highlighting the problem of
Palestinians who find it nearly im
possible to gain access to health fa
cilities and other resources, she
merely drew the audience's focus to

the suffering of the Palestinian peo
ple, a subject generally overlooked
by the local media.
Epstein drew to the audience's
attention to the shared humanity of
the Israeli and Palestinian people.
She gave examples of how Israelis
and Palestinians alike are protesting
the injustices that take place.
She reminded the audience that
the only doers of injustice are the
authorities that are building a 25-
foot-high wall that infringes on
Palestinian territories, unfairly lim
iting Palestinians' access to re
sources, and the suicide bombers
who go to extreme measures to
protest that infringement.
Her plea was for injustice to be
nipped in the bud and for the audi
ence to learn and think about the sit

uation; to recognize the people's
right to self-determination; to have
the same hopes and dreams fora
Palestinian child as those for an Is
raeli child; and to see a vision of
freedom and harmony for Palestine
and Israel, existing side by side, in
peace.
I sincerely hope that Hillel un
derstands and respects the desire of
the MSAN and CJME fora free and
open dialogue on issues such as this.

Father's comment out of line
Although a non-Catholic. I was
nevertheless disappointed to read
Father Patrick La√üelle's maliening

of Catholic bishops' opposition to
John Kerry ("Catholic voters court
ed on campus." Oct. 22).
Is he able to mind-read the
thoughts and emotional state of
those in higher office? Does he like
wise accuse Catholic Prof. Steven
Cortright, who stood up on campus
for the same set of principles?
To in effect claim as he did. with
out giving evidence, that their oppo
sition is political prostitution is the
sort of distasteful, low-class maneu
ver which violates the spirit of 1
Timothy 5:17-19, and which one
would have hoped even liberal cler
gy to be above.
