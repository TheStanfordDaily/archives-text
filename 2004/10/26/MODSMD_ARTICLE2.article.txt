# Profs square off in policy debate
## Krasner, Blacker debate Kerry, Bush foreign policies before full house 
### SARAH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
Profs. Coit Blacker and Stephen
Krasner drew distinctions between
the personalities of Sen. John Kerry
and President George W. Bush hut
found few areas of distinction in
their foreign policy platforms in a de
bate last night in Wallenberg Hall.
Though Krasner and Blacker of
ficially came into the discussion rep
resenting the Republican and De
mocratic tickejts, respectively, each
noted that they were expressing their
personal views rather than those ex
plicitly endorsed by the campaigns.
Blacker, Director of the Stanford
Institute for International Studies
and a political science professor by
courtesy, worked as a senior foreign
policy advisor in the first Clinton ad
ministration. Krasner also has expe
rience working for the National Se
curity Council under Bush.
"I thought they agreed on a lot,"
said senior Zach Cooper. "I think
the ideological differences between
[the professors] are very small."
The debate focused on issues
like the conflict in Iraq and the
threat of nuclear weapons in North
Korea and Iran, as well as more
general characterizations of the
candidates' decision-making styles.
Krasner said the United States
might be at a crossroads: The future
could be one in which there are
three to four minor terrorist attacks
per year or another in which there
are many nuclear attacks through

out the West every year.
Krasner argued that Bush's for
eign policy centers around this sec
ond, more catastrophic, possibility.
This policy results in Bush's re
liance on quick responses despite
sometimes insufficient informa
tion.
Krasner said that he favors
Bush's headfirst approach because
he fears that the second world, in
which there are multiple nuclear at
tacks each year, is more likely. In
contrast to the Bush style, Kerry as

sumes that we will remain in the
first world, which would allow for
more contemplative, delayed re
sponses, Krasner said.
Blacker agreed that the United
States is at a crossroads, but saw
Bush's strategy as "trying to scare
people to death," while arguing
that Kerry's approach is a more re
flective, mature approach to com
plex problems.
Blacker returned to this point
several times, concluding with the
idea that the candidate's approach

to a problem and "style of leader
ship" was arguably more important
than their stance on any one issue.
Many students said they enjoyed
the analysis of the candidates' lead
ership styles.
"I found their emphasis on the
importance of the candidates' per
sonalities interesting," said Sam
Booth, Class of 2003.

Students packed into Wallenberg Hall last night to hear Professors Coit Blacker and Stephen Krasner debate the for
eign policies of President Bush and Sen. Kerry. The two focused partially on each man's leadership style.
Iraq, Blacker critiqued the Bush
administration's incompetence in
the post-war effort and its willing
ness to fight the war without the
support of key allies.
"Whether or not it was possible
for the administration to know all
of the information initially ... the
administration failed to consider
the possibility that everything
might not go right," Blacker said.
Krasner argued that Bush's deci
sions were justified because of the
necessity to take action quickly.
"We are in an environment now
where truly catastrophic things
could happen," Krasner said.
However, Krasner contended

that while Bush might sometimes
make decisions without all of the
facts and sacrifice civil liberties in
the process, this is necessary in pre
venting the rise of the hypothetical
second world in which nuclear dis
asters are prevalent.
Blacker stated that Bush and
Kerry did not vary substantially in
how they would deal with nuclear
proliferation in North Korea and
Iran, but said that many of the dif
ferences the campaigns emphasized
were simply driven by a need to dis
tinguish themselves from the other
party. Both professors argued that
the best solution would be multilat
eral dialogue and possible sanctions.

For their part, the audience,
which spilled out of the atrium
where debate was held, gave both
professors glowing reviews.
"I think that Prof. Krasner gave
an extremely straight-forward, log
ical and articulate assessment of
U.S. foreign policy," said freshman
Vivian Liu.
Others agreed.
"I thought it was an excellent ar
ticulation of the party's policies and
an effective way to show the differ
ences between the candidates in a
friendly Stanford environment,"
said junior Ratul Narain.

tant to the president for national se-

Blacker and Krasner agreed that most of Bush and Kerry's adua! foreign policies were similar, but that their decision-making styles differed wildly. Blacker
served as a senior foreign policy advisor under Pres. Clinton, while Krasner has held high level posts in the National Security Council under Bush.
