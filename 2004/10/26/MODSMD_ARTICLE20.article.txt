## Soto Tape Chronicles Pig heads make Sox / Yankees rivalry seem like child's play 
### 
You want to talk about a curse? Let me
tell you about a rivalry so lopsided that
the teams need to draw animosity from
their histories because recent results on the
playing field are so one-sided.
No, I'm not talking about the Yankees and

the Red Sox.
Yes, the Red Sox made
baseball history by coming
back from an 0-3 deficit in the
ALCS. Yes, they reversed
years of bad luck against their
division rivals and atoned for
the pain of last season's game
seven. Yes, they are currently
leading the St. Louis Cardi
nals 2-0 in the World Series
behind two remarkable per-

formances against a team that won 105 games
in the regular season. Yes, Boston is on the
verge of becoming one flaming cauldron of joy
that threatens to melt the entire surrounding
metropolitan area.
But no. I'm not talking about the Yankees
and the Red Sox.
I'm talking about an even more insidious ri
valry that stretches back to 1905 and has divid
ed a nation. One team has signed the best play
ers from every country and at every position
over the past five years. These overpriced
divas make the tabloids more often than they
make the sports pages. Meanwhile, the home
team has toiled with homegrown talent and a
budget that while astronomical, does not com
pare to the sums forked over by their neigh
bors.
One team markets extensively, and you can
find their nauseatingly recognizable jerseys on
people the world over, regardless of whether
they've ever seen a game live, and regardless
of whether they know anything about the ri
valry.
One team is a popular winner that has
claimed more championships in the past
decade than any other club, and no one is a
close second. On the other hand, the home
team has won it all only once in living history,
and has forced their fans to live through excru
ciating losses in the finals more times than one
would ever wish on another human being.
I'm talking about FC Barcelona and Real
Madrid.
and Madrid are the two premier
clubs in Spain, and two of the greatest in the
world. You can't be a fan of both. Like the
Yankees and the Red Sox, the two teams rep
resent more than just their respective cities,
and are focal points for intense regional pride.
Barqa is supported by the nationalism of the
Catalan people, while Madrid embodies the
central Castilian government and its effort to
homogenize Spain.
During the Franco years. Real Madrid was
the state-supported team, and their all-white
jerseys came to symbolize the triumph of ath
leticism under a Fascist dictatorship. During
those tough times. Bar<ja languished in the
north, struggling to man a side that could give
hope to a proud but defeated people.
But this is a sports column, and my political
commentary will have to wait until next week's
Daily.
The parallels between the two Spanish gi
ants and the Yankees and Red Sox are too
many to count.
Since the Red Sox last won the World Se
ries in 1918. the Yankees have amassed an
amazing 26 championship trophies. Similarly,
since the UEFA Champions League (analo
gous to the World Series, but for all of Europe)
was formed in 1955. Real Madrid has been
crowned 9 times, and was recently named by
FIFA as the best soccer club in history. The
