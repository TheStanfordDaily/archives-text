# Men's golf takes fourth at Nelson Invitational
## Card surges in final day of home tourney 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"I feel very positive, but golf is a
fickle and elusive game." freshman
Rob Grube said before last week
end's Nelson Invitational. "We have
worked hard to prepare for this week,
and it all boils down to playing well.'"
The Stanford men's golf translated
preparation into results last weekend,
finishing in a tie with Missouri for
fourth in a field of 16 teams.
No. 3 New Mexico took top team
honors, besting No. 14 UNLV by five
shots.
The individual competition was fu

rious. as New Mexico's Spencer Levin
and No. 17 Georgia State's Steve
Tiley. playing together on the final
day, each rolled in birdie putts on the
18th hole to tie for the individual title
at nine under par.
Teams encountered a Stanford
Golf Course that was ready to provide
a challenge to the best players in the
country. Not only did long roughs pe
nalize players who hit errant tee
shots, but difficult hole locations
placed a premium on precise iron
play. ..
Former Stanford golfer Jim Seki,
on hand to watch the event, com
mented that many of the pin positions
selected for Friday's round (typically
the day with the easiest locations of
any tournament) were comparable to
Ihose he had seen on Sundays (the
most difficult of the tournament)
during his time at the Farm.
Many holes were cut near the
edges of the greens, making it diffi
cult to hit approach shots close.
Other pins appeared quite accessi
ble, but were guarded by slopes
and ridges to coax three-putts out
of those who were too aggressive.
"1 think the course was difficult
but fair." senior Kevin Blue said.
"If you were hitting the ball accu
rately, you could go at the pins, be
cause the greens were soft. Any
mistake was punished severely,
though."
On the first two days of the
three-day competition, the Stan
ford golfers did something they
had failed to do in previous out
ings: they hung around.
Although the Cardinal's two
day total of 564 left the team in
sixth place, the deficit was still
manageable. A victory was out of
reach, but fifth-place Kansas State
was just one shot better, and third
place was a mere ten strokes away.
Experience led the Cardinal
over the first two days, as Blue and
junior Kyle Gentry were tied for
15th individually after Saturday's
round. Sophomore Zack Miller re
bounded from a tough opening
round to shoot a two-under-par 67
and was tied for 25th place.
Grube's second-round 72 put
him in 33rd place, while sopho
more Matt Savage, competing in
his first event of the year, rounded
out the scoring for Stanford with 72
on Saturday, settling into 57th
place overall.
While Stanford positioned itself
fora Sunday run at the top five,
New Mexico and UNLV jousted
atop the leader board. After post
ing solid scores on Friday, both
teams separated themselves from
the field on Saturday, attacking
pins all over the course.

Blue, Gentry
lead Stanford

New Mexico shot a sterling
seven-under-par 269 on the second
day, but lost ground to UNLV's
268.
The Lobos led the Runnin'
Rebels by a single shot heading
into Sunday's final round.
Thus, the stage was set for Sun
day drama as air horns rang out to
signal the 8 a.m. shotgun start.
Before a modest smattering of
spectators (blood relatives and a few
confused tourists are pretty much
the norm for college golf), the race
for the individual and team titles wa§
underway.
Stanford played a gritty final
round, the second best of the day, and
climbed steadily past its competitors.
Gentry recorded his second
consecutive round of 69, en route
to a seventh-place finish — the sec
ond-best of his career, and the best
of the week for the Cardinal.
A 67 from Grube led Stanford
on the day, and sent him shooting
up the leaderboard into a tie for
ninth — his second Top-10 finish
in four collegiate events. Blue and
Miller tied lor 21st place after they
shot 73 and 71, respectively. Sav
age shot 78 on Sunday, to finish
68th.
Besides a fourth-place finish,
Stanford received solid perfor
mances from a pair of players com
peting as individuals. Sophomore
Matt Shin played solidly all week
end, finishing tied for 21st place,
while Scott Mac Donald shot a 67
on Saturday to match the low Car
dinal score for the weekend.
"Even though we would have
liked to have won on our home
course, the result was solid and an
other step in the right direction for
us," Blue said. "We look to build
on this week for our final tourna
ment of the fall."
The Cardinal will travel to La
Quinta, Calif, this weekend to par
ticipate in The Prestige.
