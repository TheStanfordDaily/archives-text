# Water polo dunks two foes
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
The loud crowds that follow Southern
California water polo played a small-to
nonexistent role in the Cardinal's suc
cessful visit down south.
Despite the tense conditions in which
the No. 2 Stanford men's water polo
team (15-2, 3-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) expected to play both of its
away games, the Cardinal started their
four-game road trip precisely as they ex
pected to — by winning.
Stanford held its weekend opponents
to only two goals in the first three periods
of both games. The Cardinal defense has
improved recently by keeping teams out
of their scoring rhythms in the first few
periods, a technique essential to the
strong showing over the weekend.
"Our focus in practice has been de
fense, so it was very nice to have all of
that hard work during the week pay off in
our games," said senior two-meter Greg
Crum. who scored three times in Sun
day's game.
Junior goalkeeper Chad Taylor
agreed.
"Our defense has really turned
around in the last 3 games," Taylor said.
"The improvement in our defense is a
testament to the increased time playing
together. As the weeks pass we get more
comfortable with each other, and we
begin to play as a team more and more."
The good defense led to counterat
tack opportunities, helped the Cardinal
to large margins of victory throughout
the two days. With 12-3 and 15-7 wins
over much weaker squads, the Stanford
crew added two more wins to its record,
building a four-game winning streak as it
readies itself to travel to top-ranked
UCLA (16-2, 3-0 MPSF) Saturday.
Senior driver Tony Azevedo was the
Cardinal star for the weekend, providing
plenty of offensive highlights in both
Stanford wins. Azevedo scored three
times in Saturday's MPSF conference
match against Pepperdine. Then on Sun
day, Azevedo eluded UCSD's defense to
score five goals against the Tritons, four
of which came in the first period.
Stanford upped its record to a perfect
3-0 in league play when it crushed the
Waves by seven goals. Although Pepper
dine took an early 1-0 lead in the first pe
riod. that was the only time that the

Waves appeared to have control of the
game.
But the Cardinal dominated soon
after, as seven different players found the
cage. By the end of the first half, a fa
vored Stanford had made things as they
were supposed to be. leading 6-1, and
eventually winning 12-3.
Drivers Peter Varellas, a junior, and
Tyler Drake, sophomore, also contribut
ed to the runaway victory with three and
two goals, respectively.
Key in securing the win was limiting
the Waves' top scorer freshman driver
Grant Miller, to one goal. But Crum said
that the team didn't "focus on any one

player in either game".
"Our main goal was to play great team
defense and make things easy for Chad.
He still made some great saves, but that's
what a great goalie will do," Crum said.
Taylor made seven saves against the
Waves.
Pepperdine had a shot at handing
UCLA its first conference loss on Sunday
— a loss which could have helped the
Cardinal displace the Bruins from their
No. 1 rank - as the Bruins and Waves
ended the third period tied at five apiece.
But Pepperdine fell short in the fourth,
and UCLA escaped with an 8-7 win.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal had UCSD

to deal with on Sunday, but the Tritons
failed to put up much of a fight. The Car
dinal victory made Stanford 3-0 against
the Tritons, while Stanford's depth al
lowed seven different players to score in
the 15-7 win.
Azevedo couldn't be stopped Sunday,
and after UCSD's Jesse Casellini closed
in on the Cardinal 2-1 in the first, Azeve
do scored three consecutive times with
less than three minutes remaining on the
clock.
Jumping out to a 5-1 lead, courtesy of
Azevedo's four goals in the first, the Tri-

tons had to play catch-up for the rest of the
game. As the Stanford defense held UCSD
scoreless in the second period and allowed only
one shot into the net in the third, the offense
kept building on that lead.
('rum tallied a goal in the first period, and
went on to score two more times. Varellas, se
nior driver Matt Moser and junior Thomas Hop
kins also scored in the second period.
By the time the Tritons' star freshman Adnan
Jerkovic was able to guide the ball into the goal,
a Cardinal win was already wrapped up.
Jerkovic scored four times in the final period,
helping UCSD outscore the Cardinal in the
fourth, but it was not enough to overcome Stan
ford's initial 12-2 advantage. I'he Triton's other
top-scorer, junior driver Chris Eichholz, was
held scoreless in the game.
Taylor was impressed by his team's ability to
cover top threats in both games.
"Our guys played great one-on-one defense
and tired them out the whole game, making it
difficult for them to produce on offense," he
said. "Shutting out the other teams' best players
is always an important role for our team, and we
are seeing that the better we do within these
one-on-one matchups, the better we do as a
team."
