# Stanford women rule the pool in Hawaii
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW 
Swimming and diving competition in the Pac-10
Conference won't be starting for another two months.
But nobody seems to have told the No. 4 Stanford
women, who came out strong in their preseason dual
meet at No. 22 Hawaii on Saturday.
"I'm very pleased with it," said head coach
Richard Quick of his team's early progress. "I think
[that] as an entire team, we're farther down the road
than we've been in the last few years."
On Saturday, the entire team performed remark
ably, as five Stanford swimmers won eight races.
Many other members of the team contributed points
with top-five finishes, giving the Cardinal a 180-120
victory and a 1-0 record.
In her first meet with the Cardinal, freshman Car
oline Bruce, an Olympian in the 200-yard breast
stroke, won that race along with the 100-yard breast
and the 200-yard individual medley, making her the
top individual finisher in the meet. She added anoth
er victory with the winning 200-yard medley relay
team, for which she swam the breast leg.
Bruce has said that her aim this year is to qualify
for the NCAA Championships in three events, and
perhaps even win a breaststroke event. After only
one collegiate meet, she is well on her way to doing
that.
Bruce was the only swimmer at the meet to achieve

the NCAA "A" qualifying standard by swimming the
l(X)-yard breaststroke in one minute and two seconds.
Four swimmers — Bruce, junior Dana Kirk, se
nior Lacey Boutwell and sophomore Desiree Stahley
— achieved the "B" standard in a combined seven
races.
Kirk swam the butterfly leg on the winning relay
team, while senior Amy Wagner led with backstroke
and freshman Brooke Bishop anchored with freestyle
to round out the squad.
Individually. Kirk won the 100- and 200-yard
butterfly, while Wagner finished third in the 100-
and 200-yard backstroke and Bishop took third in
the 50-yard free and second in the 100- and 200-yard
backstroke.
Team captain Boutwell added a victory in the 200-
yard freestyle, and distance swimmers Stahley and
sophomore Lauren Costclla took first in the 500-yard
and 1000-yard freestyle, respectively.
The race winners paced the team, but the support
ing cast added the points necessary fora meet victory.
Five other Stanford swimmers had at least two
top-four individual finishes, including two who had
three.
Laura Davis was second to Kirk in the butterfly
events, and placed third in the individual medley.
Katherine Bell came in second to Bruce in both the

breaststroke races; while Erica Liu
placed fourth in both of those races
and fourth in the 200-yard individual
medley.
While the swimmers put on a
solid show this weekend, victory also
partially depended on the perfor
mance of the diving team, composed
of only two members for this trip.
Sophomore Cassidy Krug and se
nior Ashlee Rosenthal took spots
two and three in both the one-meter
and three-meter springboards. Krug
placed second in the one-meter com
petition. trailing Hawaii's ace diver
QiongJie Huang by only 0.25 points,
while Ashlee Rosenthal was com
fortably in third with a score of
274.70.'
Huang dominated in the 3-meter,
beating out Rosenthal and Krug by
more than 10 points.
Still, as the only Stanford divers in
a field of seven, the duo of Rosenthal
and Krug helped the team to a dom
inating victory.
The swimmers and divers will
head to Austin, TX this weekend to
face off against Texas and Southern
California in a three-way meet.
After that, each team has one more
contest before taking a break until
the beginning of the Pac-10 competi
tion in January.
"I was fairly pleased with our first
meet of the season." said Quick. "It
will help us get ready for the chal
lenges we face in our next meet and
beyond."

than we've been in the last few years."
On Saturday, the entire team performed remark
ably, as five Stanford swimmers won eight races.
Many other members of the team contributed points
with top-five finishes, giving the Cardinal a 180-120
victory and a 1-0 record.
In her first meet with the Cardinal, freshman Car
oline Bruce, an Olympian in the 200-yard breast
stroke, won that race along with the 100-yard breast
and the 200-yard individual medley, making her the
top individual finisher in the meet. She added anoth
er victory with the winning 200-yard medley relay
team, for which she swam the breast leg.
Bruce has said that her aim this year is to qualify
for the NCAA Championships in three events, and
perhaps even win a breaststroke event. After only
one collegiate meet, she is well on her way to doing
that.
Bruce was the only swimmer at the meet to achieve

the NCAA "A" qualifying standard by swimming the
l(X)-yard breaststroke in one minute and two seconds.
Four swimmers — Bruce, junior Dana Kirk, se
nior Lacey Boutwell and sophomore Desiree Stahley
— achieved the "B" standard in a combined seven
races.
Kirk swam the butterfly leg on the winning relay
team, while senior Amy Wagner led with backstroke
and freshman Brooke Bishop anchored with freestyle
to round out the squad.
Individually. Kirk won the 100- and 200-yard
butterfly, while Wagner finished third in the 100-
and 200-yard backstroke and Bishop took third in
the 50-yard free and second in the 100- and 200-yard
backstroke.
Team captain Boutwell added a victory in the 200-
yard freestyle, and distance swimmers Stahley and
sophomore Lauren Costclla took first in the 500-yard
and 1000-yard freestyle, respectively.
The race winners paced the team, but the support
ing cast added the points necessary fora meet victory.
Five other Stanford swimmers had at least two
top-four individual finishes, including two who had
three.
Laura Davis was second to Kirk in the butterfly
events, and placed third in the individual medley.
Katherine Bell came in second to Bruce in both the

placed fourth in both of those races
and fourth in the 200-yard individual

While the swimmers put on a
solid show this weekend, victory also
partially depended on the perfor
mance of the diving team, composed
of only two members for this trip.
Sophomore Cassidy Krug and se
nior Ashlee Rosenthal took spots
two and three in both the one-meter
and three-meter springboards. Krug
placed second in the one-meter com

QiongJie Huang by only 0.25 points,
while Ashlee Rosenthal was com
fortably in third with a score of

Huang dominated in the 3-meter,
beating out Rosenthal and Krug by
more than 10 points.
Still, as the only Stanford divers in
a field of seven, the duo of Rosenthal
and Krug helped the team to a dom
inating victory.
The swimmers and divers will
head to Austin, TX this weekend to
face off against Texas and Southern
California in a three-way meet.
After that, each team has one more
contest before taking a break until
the beginning of the Pac-10 competi
tion in January.
"I was fairly pleased with our first
meet of the season." said Quick. "It
will help us get ready for the chal
lenges we face in our next meet and
beyond."
