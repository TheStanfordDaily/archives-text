# Women come out strong in ITA Regional
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
This weekend, the top-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team made its ex
pected strong showing at the Cardinal
hosted Wilson / ITA Northwest Re
gional Championships, held at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium.
For the past two years, the top-seed
ed. top-ranked doubles team of alumna
Lauren Barnikow and Erin Burdette,
now a senior, vanquished its opponents
to claim the Northwest Regional dou
bles title.
Burdette continued her legacy this
year with junior Alice Barnes, pulling
out a 9-7 win yesterday over Fresno
State's Courtney Jantz and Lucia Sainz.
"Erin's won this tournament [in dou
bles] for three years now. so I definitely
felt some pressure to win," Barnes said.
Adding to that stress were scattered
storms, which shut down all but the
third round of singles play on Saturday

and left six rounds of doubles and sin
gles for just two days.
For No. 6 Barnes (5-2), who also
found herself in the singles final, the
scheduled amount of match time was
simply too much.
Barnes will face off against freshman
Suzanna Bahos (9-0) of California on
Thursday, after an informal agreement
was reached between the players. Stan
ford head coach Lele Forood and Cali
fornia head coach Jan Brogan.
"We figured it wasn't very fair for me
to have to play four matches in one
day," Barnes said.
By virtue of their finalist appear
ance, both Barnes and Babos have qual
ified for the ITA National Indoors
Tournament, held at Michigan Nov. 4-7.
For Barnes, the trip to Indoors and
the steps leading up to it are well-worn,

the finals at the Northwest Regional her

freshman year and has qualified
for the Indoor Tournament for
the third year in a row.
Barnes sailed through this
year's tournament in straight sets,
including a punishing 6-1, 6-0
shutout of Washington's No. 11
Pea Sumantri (5-2) in the semifi
nals. Sumantri was seeded third in
the competition.
Babos, who claimed her first
collegiate title at the Nike Cal In
vitational earlier this month, also
survived her Regional opponents
in straight sets. Babos made quick
work of No. 4 seed Burdette in the
semis, posting 6-2, 6-2 win.
Babos, the eighth seed, had
just one close call at Regional,
where she outlasted Stanford
freshman Whitney Deason (3-1)
in a quarterfinal tiebreak. 6-3, 7-6
(6).
Deason, meanwhile, posted
the biggest upset of the tourna
ment, cleaning out reigning cham
pion Daria Panova of Oregon in
the Round of 32, 6-4, 6-0.
Panova holds a No. 8 national
ranking was seeded second at

Northwest.
"I was very happy overall with
my tournament," Deason said. "1
had some good wins. 1 thought 1
played well, but the match (Sun
day] afternoon was definitely a
tough one. I had my opportunities
but didn't take advantage of
them."
Despite her eventual loss.
Deason files rank with Babos to
show that one of the most impor
tant aspects of the individual sea
son is giving incoming players a
chance to make a name for them
selves.
Deason remains unranked na
tionally, but pledged to keep
prepping for the regular season,
now just two months away.
"I'm more of a baseline player:
I hit with a fair amount of power,"
Deason said. "Since 1 got here,
I've been primarily working on
my serve and trying to use more of
the court for hitting angles, in
stead of just blasting it back all the
time."
While the season's two tourna
ments to date have given coaches

for third straight year

a chance to solidify their lineups,
nothing is certain.
"We got to see some good dou
bles pairs at Northwest Region
al," Barnes said. "I think at this
moment Erin and 1 will be No. 1,
followed by Amber [Liu| and
Anne [Yelsey], and Whitney and
Leila [Hodzic]."
Deason and Hodzic deferred
to Barnes and Burdette in the
semifinals, 8-1.
Liu and Yelsey lost to runners
up Jantz and Sainz in the Round
of lb, 8-6.
Another doubles team consist
ing of junior Joanna Kao and
sophomore Theresa Logar also
competed this weekend, falling to
No. 7 seeds Nicole Shabaz and
Samantha Waller of Cal Poly in
the Round of lb. 8-4.
Barnes added, "But in singles,
I think Amber at No. 1 is the only
position that's guaranteed. It's
nice to know that not everything
is riding on our performances at
these individual tournaments, and
[everyone] knows they have
something to work for."

felt some pressure to win," Barnes said.
Adding to that stress were scattered
storms, which shut down all but the
third round of singles play on Saturday

and left six rounds of doubles and sin
gles for just two days.
For No. 6 Barnes (5-2), who also
found herself in the singles final, the
scheduled amount of match time was
simply too much.

"We figured it wasn't very fair for me
to have to play four matches in one

for the Indoor Tournament for
the third year in a row.
Barnes sailed through this
year's tournament in straight sets,
including a punishing 6-1, 6-0
shutout of Washington's No. 11
Pea Sumantri (5-2) in the semifi
nals. Sumantri was seeded third in
the competition.
Babos, who claimed her first
collegiate title at the Nike Cal In
vitational earlier this month, also
survived her Regional opponents
in straight sets. Babos made quick
work of No. 4 seed Burdette in the
semis, posting 6-2, 6-2 win.
Babos, the eighth seed, had
just one close call at Regional,
where she outlasted Stanford
freshman Whitney Deason (3-1)
in a quarterfinal tiebreak. 6-3, 7-6
(6).
Deason, meanwhile, posted
the biggest upset of the tourna
ment, cleaning out reigning cham
pion Daria Panova of Oregon in
the Round of 32, 6-4, 6-0.
Panova holds a No. 8 national
ranking was seeded second at

Northwest.
"I was very happy overall with
my tournament," Deason said. "1
had some good wins. 1 thought 1
played well, but the match (Sun
day] afternoon was definitely a
tough one. I had my opportunities
but didn't take advantage of
them."
Despite her eventual loss.
Deason files rank with Babos to
show that one of the most impor
tant aspects of the individual sea
son is giving incoming players a
chance to make a name for them
selves.
Deason remains unranked na
tionally, but pledged to keep
prepping for the regular season,
now just two months away.
"I'm more of a baseline player:
I hit with a fair amount of power,"
Deason said. "Since 1 got here,
I've been primarily working on
my serve and trying to use more of
the court for hitting angles, in
stead of just blasting it back all the
time."
While the season's two tourna
ments to date have given coaches

for third straight year

a chance to solidify their lineups,
nothing is certain.
"We got to see some good dou
bles pairs at Northwest Region
al," Barnes said. "I think at this
moment Erin and 1 will be No. 1,
followed by Amber [Liu| and
Anne [Yelsey], and Whitney and
Leila [Hodzic]."
Deason and Hodzic deferred
to Barnes and Burdette in the
semifinals, 8-1.
Liu and Yelsey lost to runners
up Jantz and Sainz in the Round
of lb, 8-6.
Another doubles team consist
ing of junior Joanna Kao and
sophomore Theresa Logar also
competed this weekend, falling to
No. 7 seeds Nicole Shabaz and
Samantha Waller of Cal Poly in
the Round of lb. 8-4.
Barnes added, "But in singles,
I think Amber at No. 1 is the only
position that's guaranteed. It's
nice to know that not everything
is riding on our performances at
these individual tournaments, and
[everyone] knows they have
something to work for."
This weekend, the top-ranked Stan
