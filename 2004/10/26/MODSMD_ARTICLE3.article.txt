# ISSU and Stanford Dining team up to provide meals during Ramadan
## 
### JILLIAN WONG 
Stanford Dining and the Islamic
Society of Stanford University are
joining forces to serve free dinners
in Tresidder Union after evening
prayers during Ramadan.
The program, new this year, was
created by the student group, said
ISSU President Ibrahim Almojel, a
graduate student in engineering.
"Stanford Dining has been very

cooperative with the ISSU," he
said.
According to ISSU Vice Presi
dent Maham Mela, a junior, the
group raised money from off-cam
pus Muslim groups and from pri
vate donations to fund the meal
program. The meals, catered by
Stanford Dining, are open to all
community members.
"We have Muslims and non-
Muslims alike eat with us," she

said.
Stanford Dining serves the
meals on weekdays on the first
floor of Tresidder, she said, and on
the weekends, Muslim families
from the surrounding area cook
and serve food. Last year during
Ramadan, students gathered in Es
condido Village Center for the
daily after-sunset meal, or iftar,
which off-campus families pre
pared.
The new program at Tresidder,
which began on Oct. 15 with the
start of Ramadan, has been a suc
cess, according to members of the
ISSU.
"We're happy to have the din
ner in the center of the campus,
which will foster more unity among
the students," said Almojel.
"The food quality on weekdays
has suffered a bit compared to last
year," added sophomore Kamil
Morshed. "But iftars in Union
Square are a huge improvement as
far as organization goes. Union
Square is pretty central," he said.
During the rest of the school
year, dining halls provide Halal
meal options for students who re
quire them, said Acting Director of
Stanford Dining Rafi Taherian.
"We began a partnership with
the ISSU many years ago to ensure
that they too have access to a qual
ity dining experience," he said.
Ramadan is the ninth and most
holy lunar month of the Muslim
year and is observed as a time of
abstention for the Islamic commu
nity. Beginning this year on Oct.
15, Muslims who are healthy and
physically able to fast are obliged
to restrict themselves from eating
during the day. They then come to
gether as a community to eat in the
evening.
Until the last day of the month,
this year Nov. 12, Muslims eat a
meal at dawn called suhoor before
they fast and are then able to eat a
meal called iftar after sunset.
Fasting, according to Almojel, is
a "constant reminder of being with
God, avoiding the materialistic as
pects of the world."
