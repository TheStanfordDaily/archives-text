# Fraga slams power of school boards
## Professor uses San Francisco as case study for talk

argued that local school boards have
too much power over the public edu

crowd in Encina West.
The speech was the third in a se

Studies Program. Fraga used the
well-researched case of the San

Francisco school district, in which
the board ignored a court-ordered
mandate to desegregate schools.

Francisco school district's complex
history supports a larger trend of re
gressive school board politics.

tremendous capacity to reassert

topic, Fraga carefully outlined the
challenges central to successful de
segregation of schools. According to
Fraga, judicial reforms fail because

"policy commitment is distinct from
the implementation component."
He pointed out another challenge
to desegregation: "We elect school
boards, [which] guide fundamental
policy."
Fraga described how a reform
minded court order was steadily un
dermined by school board politics in
the San Francisco school district.
Fraga explained that the 1983
