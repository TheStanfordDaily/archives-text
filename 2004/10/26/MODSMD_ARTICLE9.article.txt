1928 — On Oct. 26, The Daily ran a
story on a controversy surrounding
the honor code. Below is an excerpt:

"That 'tattle-tales' are neither
wanted nor needed in a 'self-enforc
ing' Honor System, is the belief of
Philip Cavalero, student body presi
dent, who spoke last night at a meet
ing of the presidents of the various
campus fraternities in the Beta
Theta Pi house.
Appealing to that body to aid in
the creation of a friendly attitude in
their respective living groups and
scoring 'stool pigeons a undesirable,'
Cavalero sketched the recently pro
posed measures to aid in the en
forcement and betterment of the
Honor System.
'We want a self-enforcing Honor
System' he declared. 'One where
student opinion will be so against
cheating that the violator will be
booed and elbowed out of the room.
The first steps have been taken to
define the Honor system and to state
the punishment of the violators.
Heretofore it has included too much,
but from now on the Honor System
will pertain to any classroom work
or any case where the system of
grading is used.'
Students in the upper division
must set the example for those in the
lower division, Cavalero said. 'It was
formerly a tradition that senior take
a definite stand and set the prece
dent of obeying the Honor System,
but lately this spirit has been lagging.
It is up to us to revive it.' "

1976 — On Oct. 26, The Daily ran a
story on scientists testing whether
chimpanzees can predict earth
quakes. Below is an excerpt:

"Accurate and comprehensive
earthquake prediction still eludes
modern researchers, hut a group of
behavioral scientists here are follow
ing up on what they believe could be
a new and effective prediction tech
nique.
They are proposing that chim
panzees can predict earthquakes.
'While our evidence is not yet
sufficient to conclude that animal
behavior will predict earthquakes, it
suggests a model for researching the
question," said Helena Kraemer, as
sociate professor of biostatics, one of
the team of researchers at the Stan
ford Outdoor Primate Facility.
The researchers reported their
findings Sunday to a Menlo Park
meeting sponsored by the U.S. Geo
logic Survey (USGS). Also partici
pating in the research and analysis
were Seymour Levine, professor of
psychiatry and director of the pri
mate facility, and Bruce Smith, a
geophysicist with USGS.
Kraemer explained that ob
servers at the facility had noted 'in
triguing behavioral changes' among
the chimpanzees immediately be
fore a cluster of minor earthquakes
last June.
