# Low student awareness of Univ. committee positions
## 
### GERRY SHIH 
When junior Brian Chang arrived
at Stanford in 2()02, he had no idea
that he would be entrusted with the
power and influence to change Uni
versity bylaws, amend the judicial
charter or decide the fate of a stu
dent who violates the Honor Code.
Two years later. Chang has gotten
used to those kind of responsibilities.
Chang is serving on one of the 40
to 45 University committees that se
lect student members. The most re
cent application cycle for these com
mittees ended on Oct. 19.
Chang is currently serving as the
co-chair of the Board on Judicial Af
fairs, a committee of six students, six
faculty members and three staff
members that sets and oversees judi
cial policies. The committee's pow
ers are considerable, and students
play a crucial role, said Assistant
Dean and Judicial Affairs Advisor
Laurette Beeson.

"We couldn't function without
the students," Beeson said. "Student
input is heard and very much sought
out."
However, Chang is in a relatively
small minority of students involved
in or even of Stanford's exten
sive committee system.
In addition, some graduate stu
dents are concerned that their com
munity is underrepresented by the
system.
Every year, there are positions
for students available on 40 to 45
permanent committees. Committees
are usually either formed by Univer
sity administrators seeking student
opinion or by student demand or re
quest. Students on committees over
see a range of University affairs,
from laboratory animal care to Uni
versity investments to Greek hous
ing.
Junior Francisco Cendejas is the
chair of the Nominations Commis
sion. a branch of the ASSU that

reads student applications and ap
points qualified applicants to Uni
versity committees.
"The committees don't report to
the ASSU, and the results of their
work don't show up in The Stanford
Daily," Cendejas said. "Many in
volved in the committee system at
Stanford feel concerned that despite
the crucial role they play in Universi
ty affairs, there is a lack of student
awareness."
Chang agreed and pointed out
that the majority of those who apply
are "student-body president types,"
which he believes results in a lack of
diversity of students sitting on com
mittees. He suspected that many stu
dents do not understand the signifi
cant role they can play if they involve
themselves.
"What's significant about our
committees is that we are actual de
cision-makers," Beeson said about
the two judicial committees she
oversees. Students make up a major

ity of members on both committees.
"We are an integral part of the law
making process."
The lack of awareness and in
volvement in the committee system
extends beyond the undergraduate
student body. Roger Stanley, the
deputy chair of the Graduate Stu
dent Council, said he is very con
cerned by what he believes to be a
lack of graduate student involve
ment in committees, but also in cam
pus student government in general.
"The committee system is great
for student input." Stanley said. "But
if you look at the attendance, gradu
ate students are very underrepre
sented, although there are more
graduate than undergraduate stu
dents here."
Senior Assistant to the University
President Jeff Wachtel disagreed
that graduate students are underrep-
resented.
"We've had great graduate stu
dent participation and typically get
great students," Wachtel said. "That
leads me to believe the system is
working."
However. Stanley offered statis
tics from this year's standing com
mittees that showed that this year
there are only 35 graduate students
serving on committees as opposed to
107 undergraduates, despite the fact
that many committees set quotas for
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents.
Former GSC Chair Steve Allison
points out that despite the quotas in
place, there are not always enough
graduate student applicants to fill all
the slots and so undergraduates are
accepted instead.
Stanley said he believes the quo
tas are hardly effective in encourag

ing equal representation.
"To say that a committee that re
quires at least one graduate student
as a quota mitigates the representa
tion problem might be akin to calling
a university coed because it admits a
token woman each year," Stanley
said.
"A single person on a committee
cannot possibly represent the full di
versity of interests and issues faced
by the graduate students who form a
de facto majority at Stanford."
The reasons Stanley offered for
the lack of graduate student interest
were similar to Chang's explanation
of undergraduate apathy.
Stanley said that students fail to
see the benefit of involvement and
that there is a general lack of infor
mation and understanding about the
committees.
Just weeks into the fall quarter.

Graduate students say
they are underrepresented

the Nominations Commission and
student government groups, under
graduate and graduate alike, are al
ready making preparations for and
thinking about how to improve the
number of applicants for committee
positions in the spring.
"1 want to improve the process
for next year, and I'd like to see more
attention focused on making com
mittees more visible to students,"
Cendejas said. "There were ads in
The Daily for the fall cycle, and we'll
send out e-mails to lists. We definite
ly need larger efforts to get the sys
tem out to the students."
Meanwhile, Stanley, on behalf of
the GSC, is committed to finding a
way to attract more applicants.
"I intend to spend this academic
year fighting this apathy with an
overt recruiting effort," said Stan
ley.
