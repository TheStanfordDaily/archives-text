1964 — On Oct. 27, 1964, The Daily
ran a story on the Bechtel I-Center.

"Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity
will hold an alcohol-free Rush this
spring quarter, becoming the first
housed fraternity follow a dry Rush
policy at Stanford, the SAE presi
dent announced last week.
According to senior Neil Angelil
lo, president of the SAEs, 'there is
some concern that alcohol at other
Rush functions will attract prospec
tive rushees, hut we want the people
who are interested in the house, not
the ones who just want alcohol,' An
gelillo said.
The impetus for the decision,
made during a house retreat in
Yosemite before the opening of the
quarter, came from the national
chapter. Angelillo said.
The National Chapter this year
had asked us to implement a dry
Rush into our policy,' Angelillo said.
A dry Rush was written into the
house by-laws, he added.
"People only see fraternities dur
ing parties, and they don't get to
meet members of a house in a natur
al environment,' Angelillo said.
'(Parties are) not an accurate picture
of our house, there's been a lot of
misunderstanding because of that,'
he said.
With their decision, the SAEs be
came the second fraternity on cam
pus to initiate a dry Rush. The un
housed Sigma Phi Epsilon held a dry
Rush last spring."

"For Stanford's l(XX) foreign stu
dents and research scholars, the
Bechtel International Student Cen
ter is the nucleus of all academic and
social activities on campus.
The basic function of the Interna
tional Center, according to Assistant
Graduate Dean for International
Students Kenneth Cooper, who is
also director of the center, is to "help
integrate the foreign students into
the overall intellectual climate of the
University community.'
One of the principal functions of
the office is to help students achieve
their academic goals. It maintains
close contact with all foreign stu
dents and advises them on their
studies.
It helps them adjust to life on an
American campus, which in many
cases is very different from that in
universities in their home countries.
The International Center also in
cludes the foreign student office,
which is primarily concerned with
technical matters such as those relat
ing to immigration, housing, work
permits, and financial aid.
The International Center further
provides a program of intellectual
and social activities."
