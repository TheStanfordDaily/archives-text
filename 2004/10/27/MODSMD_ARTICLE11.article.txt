In the front-page article
"Profs square off in policy de
bate" (Oct. 26), The Daily in
correctly indicated that Profs.
Stephen Krasner and Coit
Blacker were officially repre
senting the Republican and
Democratic tickets, respec
tively. In fact, neither profes
sor participated in the event
as an official representative of
the Democratic or Republi
can presidential candidates or
parties; they expressed their
own views on U.S. foreign
policy. The article also failed
to mention that the event was
sponsored by Stanford in
Government. The Daily re
grets the errors.
