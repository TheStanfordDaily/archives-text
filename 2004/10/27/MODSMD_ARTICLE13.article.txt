## Relationship vs. Full Moon 
### 
Disclaimer: This article is
written to justify how I
— part of a committed,
loving, monogamous re
lationship— can participate in Full
Moon on the Quad and not be
morally corrupt.

And if that doesn't work, then at
least to convince others to join me
in my sinful quest.
Freshman year, I was in a heated
Beirut tournament when my oppo
nent, an old-fashioned Southerner,
told me that he would drop out of
school in shame if he got beaten by
a girl in a drinking game. So 1 did
what any
freshman

girl would
do: I kissed
my partner
to distract
our oppo
nent from
hitting the
last cup.
I hate to
revert to
stale gender
stereotypes,
but what
better dis
traction is
there fora
drunken

college boy
than two girls making out?
I assumed my boyfriend would
be turned-on by the thought of my
engaging in some girl-on-girl.
I was shocked that he consid
ered it cheating. 1 have never cheat
ed on a significant other, but I
wouldn't think twice about doing
the exact same thing again.
To me, cheating is any act that
puts the emotional and physical in
timacy of your relationship in dan
ger or breaks the boundaries explic
itly or implicitly agreed upon. The
fact that I'm straight and she's a girl
means that kissing her poses no risk
to my relationship.
Cheating, in relationships and in
school, is defined by the context of
the act, not the act itself. Using lec
ture notes is fine if you are working
on a problem set, but not if you are
in the middle of a closed-book
exam. Kissing someone else is fine
if you are playing Juliet and he's
playing Romeo, not if you're Juliet
and he's the hottie from your Ital
ian class.
Which brings me to Full Moon
on the Quad. My boyfriend doesn't
want me to go because he believes
that kissing other people — regard
less of age, sex or moon cycle — is
cheating. That is reasonable.
However, this is an 18-month
long relationship that has survived
four months with us on different
continents, my mom asking him if
everyone in his a cappella group is
gay or just the majority and my dad
meeting him for the first time when
he (my boyfriend. NOT my dad)
was in bed with me at 9 a.m. on a
Saturday morning.
After all of that, does he really
think I'm only weakly tied to this
relationship? If I wanted to get out,
I would have done so a long time
ago.
Few people understand why
participating in Full Moon is impor
tant to me. Until now, all of my time
at Stanford I've spent with one foot
out the door, worrying about and
planning for the future.
Being a senior has brought me
face to face with all the opportuni
ties that slipped by because I was
too tired, too busy, too drunk to no
tice.
This is my last opportunity to
kiss boys I don't know for no
greater purpose than to kiss boys I
don't know. It's not because I'm un
satisfied in my relationship or be
cause I don't love my boyfriend —
it's because I'm a college student
and that's what they do. I don't
want to look back on Full Moon
and wish.
Oh. and to all you freshmen who
are abstaining out of respect for your
relationships: don't. They won t sur
vive winter quarter anyway.
P.S.: My partner and I won the
tournament. Never underestimate
a Rinconada girl.
