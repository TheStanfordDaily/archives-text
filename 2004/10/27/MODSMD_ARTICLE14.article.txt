# School too easy? Walk-ons challenge body and mind
## 
### SAM FLOAM 
Fora university that has won the
Director's Cub for best all-around
college athletic program 10 times in a
row, Stanford has a surprising number
of students who walk on to its varsity
teams. Unlike scholarship athletes,
who are extensively scouted and re
cruited, walk-ons have to try out for
teams the old-fashioned way.
Not surprisingly, it is easier to
walk on to some sports than others.
Although coaches do not generally
rely on potential walk-ons to fill their
rosters, many coaches are eager to ac
cept walk-ons several months into the
year. This fall, for example, men's
track and field accepted three walk
ons, the football team accepted five
and the crew teams accepted 45 alto
gether. Sailing generally takes any
where from five to 15 walk-ons a year.
Head football coach Buddy
Teevens said that many potential
walk-ons contact him in advance of
their arrival to Stanford, and then his
coaching staff follows through by
doing research on the student and
contacting his high school. Some of
the things he checks for are physical
preparedness and plans to commit to
the team for at least one year.
He noted that some particularly
talented walk-ons have eventually
gone on to win athletic scholarships.
While many teams attract walk
ons who have participated in their
sports in high school, many teams, es
pecially crew and sailing, accept stu
dents with no prior experience.
Walk-ons to most teams are gener
ally freshmen. Sailing Coach Jay
Kehoe and Assistant Women's Crew
Coach Carrie Davis said that that
about 50 percent of walk-ons quit the
team because of the time commitment.
Davis said she doesn't know of anyone
who has left because they didn't like
the sport orthe team members.
Andrew Gerard, head coach of
the men's cross country team, said
that he does not account for walk-ons
when putting together his squad.

Gerard requires potential walk
ons who contact him their accep
tance to Stanford to complete a rig
orous summer training program, but
often these students simply cannot
keep up in the fall.
"They're always a surprise if they
survive," he said.
Although the majority of Stan
ford's varsity teams allow walk-ons,
the process differs for each team. Gen
erally, students express their interest
in the team to the coach. The crew and
sailing teams invite students to attend
an information meeting that is held
during the first week of classes and
allow walk-ons to join the team up
until winter quarter. The sailing team
also holds recreational days where stu
dents can try out the sport and see if it
is something they would enjoy.
After speaking with a coach, new
athletes must be cleared for eligibili
ty and physical health in order to
comply with NCAA regulations.
Once all the requisite forms are com
pleted and checked out, the student
is put on record and can begin prac
ticing with the team.
Women's Lightweight Crew
Coach A1 Acosta said that about a
quarter of his non-recruited rowers
and coxswains quit the team because
they had never played the sport and
decided it was not for them. He said
it takes a little while to learn the
sport, and some do not like to go
through the learning process as a
complete novice.
"Many are not humble enough to
start over again, but others are in
trigued by that," Acosta said.
Freshman Jonah Greenberger
walked on to the men's track and
field team as a pole vaulter this fall
but quit the team after a week be
cause the time commitment was in
terfering with his schoolwork.
"The experience of being on track
was extremely rewarding, but it is
more important to find where your
priorities lie," Greenberger said.
Sophomore Katherine Schlosser
is thrilled about her decision to walk

on to the sailing team this year.
"They're very welcoming," she
said. "The sailing team is just fabu
lous."
Sophomore Megan Watkins
walked on to the women's crew team
last year. Watkins had rowed in high
school and could handle the athletic
demands of the sport, but she said
she was unable to finish the year be
cause she needed to focus on her pre
med classes. She also now writes for
The Daily.
"As a walk-on, you have to devel
op a mindset that most recruits have
had years to develop," she said.
"Your sport has to come first, and
with so much going on both academ
ically and socially, it can be difficult
to make sacrifices."
Some walk-ons say they enjoy the
many perks of being a varsity athlete
at Stanford.
Davis said that her athletes are
given expenses-paid travel for away
meets, access to the Sports Medicine
Department and the Academic Re
source Center in Arrillaga, Nike gear,
free entry to home athletic events and
the opportunity to represent Stanford
at the National Championship in the
spring.
Teevens said that all players on the
football team are treated the same
and held to the same expectations, re
gardless of whether they are recruits,
walk-ons, scholarship athletes or non
scholarship athletes.
"If you are a member of the team,
you are on the team regardless, and 1
think a lot of the players appreciate
that," he said.
Men's Track and Field Coach
Robert Weir emphasized that walk
ons must be confident that they real
ly want to participate.
"Once you walk on to a varsity
sport, there are many rules that you
have to pay attention to that a regu
lar student wouldn't," Weir said. "To
walk-on to a team and become part
of a sports program is not an easy
thing. It takes someone who has an
interest and is highly motivated."

during the first week of classes and
allow walk-ons to join the team up
until winter quarter. The sailing team
also holds recreational days where stu
dents can try out the sport and see if it
is something they would enjoy.
After speaking with a coach, new
athletes must be cleared for eligibili
ty and physical health in order to
comply with NCAA regulations.
Once all the requisite forms are com
pleted and checked out, the student
is put on record and can begin prac
ticing with the team.
Women's Lightweight Crew
Coach A1 Acosta said that about a
quarter of his non-recruited rowers
and coxswains quit the team because
they had never played the sport and
decided it was not for them. He said
it takes a little while to learn the
sport, and some do not like to go
through the learning process as a
complete novice.
"Many are not humble enough to
start over again, but others are in
trigued by that," Acosta said.
Freshman Jonah Greenberger
walked on to the men's track and
field team as a pole vaulter this fall
but quit the team after a week be
cause the time commitment was in
terfering with his schoolwork.
"The experience of being on track
was extremely rewarding, but it is
more important to find where your
priorities lie," Greenberger said.
Sophomore Katherine Schlosser
is thrilled about her decision to walk

on to the sailing team this year.
"They're very welcoming," she
said. "The sailing team is just fabu
lous."
Sophomore Megan Watkins
walked on to the women's crew team
last year. Watkins had rowed in high
school and could handle the athletic
demands of the sport, but she said
she was unable to finish the year be
cause she needed to focus on her pre
med classes. She also now writes for
The Daily.
"As a walk-on, you have to devel
op a mindset that most recruits have
had years to develop," she said.
"Your sport has to come first, and
with so much going on both academ
ically and socially, it can be difficult
to make sacrifices."
Some walk-ons say they enjoy the
many perks of being a varsity athlete
at Stanford.
Davis said that her athletes are
given expenses-paid travel for away
meets, access to the Sports Medicine
Department and the Academic Re
source Center in Arrillaga, Nike gear,
free entry to home athletic events and
the opportunity to represent Stanford
at the National Championship in the
spring.
Teevens said that all players on the
football team are treated the same
and held to the same expectations, re
gardless of whether they are recruits,
walk-ons, scholarship athletes or non
scholarship athletes.
"If you are a member of the team,
you are on the team regardless, and 1
think a lot of the players appreciate
that," he said.
Men's Track and Field Coach
Robert Weir emphasized that walk
ons must be confident that they real
ly want to participate.
"Once you walk on to a varsity
sport, there are many rules that you
have to pay attention to that a regu
lar student wouldn't," Weir said. "To
walk-on to a team and become part
of a sports program is not an easy
thing. It takes someone who has an
interest and is highly motivated."

Fora university that has won the
Director's Cub for best all-around
college athletic program 10 times in a
row, Stanford has a surprising number
of students who walk on to its varsity
teams. Unlike scholarship athletes,
who are extensively scouted and re
cruited, walk-ons have to try out for
teams the old-fashioned way.
Not surprisingly, it is easier to
walk on to some sports than others.
Although coaches do not generally
rely on potential walk-ons to fill their
rosters, many coaches are eager to ac
cept walk-ons several months into the
year. This fall, for example, men's
track and field accepted three walk
ons, the football team accepted five
and the crew teams accepted 45 alto
gether. Sailing generally takes any
where from five to 15 walk-ons a year.
Head football coach Buddy
Teevens said that many potential
walk-ons contact him in advance of
their arrival to Stanford, and then his
coaching staff follows through by
doing research on the student and
contacting his high school. Some of
the things he checks for are physical
preparedness and plans to commit to
the team for at least one year.
He noted that some particularly
talented walk-ons have eventually
gone on to win athletic scholarships.
While many teams attract walk
ons who have participated in their
sports in high school, many teams, es
pecially crew and sailing, accept stu
dents with no prior experience.
Walk-ons to most teams are gener
ally freshmen. Sailing Coach Jay
Kehoe and Assistant Women's Crew
Coach Carrie Davis said that that
about 50 percent of walk-ons quit the
team because of the time commitment.
Davis said she doesn't know of anyone
who has left because they didn't like
the sport orthe team members.
Andrew Gerard, head coach of
the men's cross country team, said
that he does not account for walk-ons
when putting together his squad.

Gerard requires potential walk
ons who contact him their accep
tance to Stanford to complete a rig
orous summer training program, but
often these students simply cannot
keep up in the fall.
"They're always a surprise if they
survive," he said.
Although the majority of Stan
ford's varsity teams allow walk-ons,
the process differs for each team. Gen
erally, students express their interest
in the team to the coach. The crew and
sailing teams invite students to attend
an information meeting that is held
during the first week of classes and
allow walk-ons to join the team up
until winter quarter. The sailing team
also holds recreational days where stu
dents can try out the sport and see if it
