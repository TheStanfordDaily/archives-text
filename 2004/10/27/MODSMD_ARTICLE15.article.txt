# College News: Alcohol, drug busts hit campuses
## Student's death prompts Berkeley police raid 
### MY-THUAN TRAN DAILY CALIFORNIAN (U. CALIFORNIA-BERKELEY 
Just hours after the suspicious death
of UC-Berkeley senior Patrick Mc-
Cann Friday afternoon, nine Berkeley
police officers raided his South Berke
ley residence and arrested four room
mates on weapons and felony marijua
na charges, police said.
In what police said was their most
significant drug bust in the last several
years, police uncovered 14 pounds of
marijuana, more than 100 methadone
pills, $14,000 in cash and multiple
weapons, said Officer Steven Rego.
Inside McCann's house, police
found a 12-gauge shotgun, an assault
rifle, two semiautomatic pistols, bullets
and throwing knives. Rego said.
They also discovered "Pay-O"
sheets for recording drug transactions,
digital scales and drugs that could be
valued at thousands of dollars, Rego
said.
The size of the bust led police to
speculate that the roommates — three
UC-Berkeley students and one former
student — were involved in a signifi
cant marijuana-growing operation and
were running a methadone lab, Rego
said.
The pills are undergoing tests fo
confirm they are methadone, Rego
said.
A roommate found McCann uncon
scious in his house Friday afternoon
and drove him to the hospital, where he
was pronounced dead on arrival at 1:06
p.m. After securing search warrants,
police raided McCann's residence at
5:22 p.m. to investigate the death. Rego
said.
Police did not go into the house with
the intention of finding drugs, Rego
said.
Three of the roommates were for
mally arraigned Tuesday on charges
stemming from the raid. Matthew Mor
rison. 22, and Babatunde John
Oyelowo. 21. were each charged with
one felony count of possession of mari
juana for sale and cultivation of mari
juana.
Casey Lanzon, 23. was charged with
possession of assault weapons on top of
the marijuana charges. Lanzon last at

tended UC-Berkeley in fall 2003, but
never received a degree.
Rego said Lanzon was the apparent
owner of the firearms and did not have
a permit for the assault rifle.
The other weapons were legally reg
istered. but the combination of drugs
and weapons in the same residence
made the possession illegal, Rego said.
Police arrested UC-Berkeley stu
dent Thatcher Hillegas, 22, Wednesday
at 2:45 p.m. on charges of possession of
marijuana for sale, after he returned to
his residence. Hillegas, a former illus
trator for the Daily Californian, was
held at the Berkeley City Jail before he
was bailed out on $20,000 Wednesday
evening.
Police could not say whether Mc-
Cann was connected to the drug-relat
ed activities or whether the drugs were
involved in his death. Rego said.
An autopsy Monday did not reveal
the cause of McCann's death, said Dan
Apperson, a supervisor at the Alameda
County Coroner's Office. Toxicology
tests may reveal whether he died of a
drug overdose, but will not be complet
ed for weeks.
The roommates did not call 911
when they found McCann unrespon
sive on Friday morning, Rego said.
After the roommates dropped off
McCann at Alta Bates Summit Medical
Center, police entered the residence to
investigate, Rego said. Police arrested
three of the roommates less than an
hour after the raid occurred.
"When a dead body just shows up
and someone just drops it off, it's kind
of suspicious," Rego said. "You can
draw your own conclusions. A case like
this is very serious."
The death does not appear to be a
homicide, but it is still under investiga
tion. Rego said.
Morrison and Oyelowo are out on
bail after being arraigned Tuesday in
the Alameda County Superior Court in
Oakland. Lanzon remained in jail on
$20,000 bail until Wednesday morning.
Police said the presence of weapons
indicates that the four were likely deal
ing drugs.
"Guns are extremely common in
drug dealers." Rego said. "They keep
guns to protect themselves."
The dozens of names listed on the
"Pay-O" sheets are under investiga

tion. Rego said. But because only first
names or code names appear on the
sheets, there is "not much we can do
with it,"he said.
The drugs, guns and knives were
taken as evidence and submitted to the
Alameda County District Attorney's
Office, Rego said.
University officials said the drug
bust was probably the most significant
drug-related activity connected to the
UC-Berkeley students in recent history.
"With the police description of the
situation, no one has heard of anything
like that related to the campus — not in
my recollection and not anyone I have
spoken to," said campus spokesperson
Marie Felde. "We view this situation
with utmost seriousness."
McCann and Oyelowo were part of
the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. Howev
er, police doubt there is a connection
between the fraternity and the drugs.
"The fraternity has nothing to do
with the case," Rego said.
Lanzon's attorney, Dennis Roberts
of Oakland. Calif., said Lanzon has a
"medical recommendation" that allows
him to legally grow and use marijuana.
According to Berkeley city protocol
for medical cannabis, 10 marijuana
plants can legally be grown inside a res
idence, with a maximum of 50 plants in
one property. Police found six plants at
the residence.
"Had it not been the fact that there
was a death, they never would have
charged*it," Roberts said.
According to Roberts, Lanzon's
original bail was $195,000, but the court
reduced it to $20,000, which "tells me
it's a weak case," Roberts said.
Attorney Elena Condes said Hille
gas, her client, was not present at the
residence when McCann was found
Friday.
Residents around the neighborhood
were surprised that the suspected drug
activity happened right under their
noses.
"We were totally incensed to know
that there were semiautomatic
weapons right next door." said a neigh
bor who declined to give her name.
"There are small children all over the
neighborhood."

In what police said was their most
significant drug bust in the last several
years, police uncovered 14 pounds of
marijuana, more than 100 methadone
pills, $14,000 in cash and multiple
weapons, said Officer Steven Rego.
Inside McCann's house, police
found a 12-gauge shotgun, an assault
rifle, two semiautomatic pistols, bullets
and throwing knives. Rego said.
They also discovered "Pay-O"
sheets for recording drug transactions,
digital scales and drugs that could be
valued at thousands of dollars, Rego
said.
The size of the bust led police to
speculate that the roommates — three
UC-Berkeley students and one former
student — were involved in a signifi
cant marijuana-growing operation and
were running a methadone lab, Rego
said.
The pills are undergoing tests fo
confirm they are methadone, Rego
said.
A roommate found McCann uncon
scious in his house Friday afternoon
and drove him to the hospital, where he
was pronounced dead on arrival at 1:06
p.m. After securing search warrants,
police raided McCann's residence at
5:22 p.m. to investigate the death. Rego
said.
Police did not go into the house with
the intention of finding drugs, Rego
said.
Three of the roommates were for
mally arraigned Tuesday on charges
stemming from the raid. Matthew Mor
rison. 22, and Babatunde John
Oyelowo. 21. were each charged with
one felony count of possession of mari
juana for sale and cultivation of mari
juana.
Casey Lanzon, 23. was charged with
possession of assault weapons on top of
the marijuana charges. Lanzon last at

tended UC-Berkeley in fall 2003, but
never received a degree.
Rego said Lanzon was the apparent
owner of the firearms and did not have
a permit for the assault rifle.
The other weapons were legally reg
istered. but the combination of drugs
and weapons in the same residence
made the possession illegal, Rego said.
Police arrested UC-Berkeley stu
dent Thatcher Hillegas, 22, Wednesday
at 2:45 p.m. on charges of possession of
marijuana for sale, after he returned to
his residence. Hillegas, a former illus
trator for the Daily Californian, was
held at the Berkeley City Jail before he
was bailed out on $20,000 Wednesday
evening.
Police could not say whether Mc-
Cann was connected to the drug-relat
ed activities or whether the drugs were
involved in his death. Rego said.
An autopsy Monday did not reveal
the cause of McCann's death, said Dan
Apperson, a supervisor at the Alameda
County Coroner's Office. Toxicology
tests may reveal whether he died of a
drug overdose, but will not be complet
ed for weeks.
The roommates did not call 911
when they found McCann unrespon
sive on Friday morning, Rego said.
After the roommates dropped off
McCann at Alta Bates Summit Medical
Center, police entered the residence to
investigate, Rego said. Police arrested
three of the roommates less than an
hour after the raid occurred.
"When a dead body just shows up
and someone just drops it off, it's kind
of suspicious," Rego said. "You can
draw your own conclusions. A case like
this is very serious."
The death does not appear to be a
homicide, but it is still under investiga
tion. Rego said.
Morrison and Oyelowo are out on
bail after being arraigned Tuesday in
the Alameda County Superior Court in
Oakland. Lanzon remained in jail on
$20,000 bail until Wednesday morning.
Police said the presence of weapons
indicates that the four were likely deal
ing drugs.
"Guns are extremely common in
drug dealers." Rego said. "They keep
guns to protect themselves."
The dozens of names listed on the
"Pay-O" sheets are under investiga

tion. Rego said. But because only first
names or code names appear on the
sheets, there is "not much we can do
with it,"he said.
The drugs, guns and knives were
taken as evidence and submitted to the
Alameda County District Attorney's
Office, Rego said.
University officials said the drug
bust was probably the most significant
drug-related activity connected to the
UC-Berkeley students in recent history.
"With the police description of the
situation, no one has heard of anything
like that related to the campus — not in
my recollection and not anyone I have
spoken to," said campus spokesperson
Marie Felde. "We view this situation
with utmost seriousness."
McCann and Oyelowo were part of
the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. Howev
er, police doubt there is a connection
between the fraternity and the drugs.
"The fraternity has nothing to do
with the case," Rego said.
Lanzon's attorney, Dennis Roberts
of Oakland. Calif., said Lanzon has a
"medical recommendation" that allows
him to legally grow and use marijuana.
According to Berkeley city protocol
for medical cannabis, 10 marijuana
plants can legally be grown inside a res
idence, with a maximum of 50 plants in
one property. Police found six plants at
the residence.
"Had it not been the fact that there
was a death, they never would have
charged*it," Roberts said.
According to Roberts, Lanzon's
original bail was $195,000, but the court
reduced it to $20,000, which "tells me
it's a weak case," Roberts said.
Attorney Elena Condes said Hille
gas, her client, was not present at the
residence when McCann was found
Friday.
Residents around the neighborhood
were surprised that the suspected drug
activity happened right under their
noses.
"We were totally incensed to know
that there were semiautomatic
weapons right next door." said a neigh
bor who declined to give her name.
"There are small children all over the
neighborhood."

police officers raided his South Berke
