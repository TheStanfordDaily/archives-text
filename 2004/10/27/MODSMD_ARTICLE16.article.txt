# SAE loses charter at U. of Maryland
## 
### HADASS KOGAN THE DIAMONDBACK (U. MARYLAND 
When University of Mary
land students Jesse Rothman
and Chris Jennings move out
of their room inside 4 Frater
nity Row Friday, it wasn't the
last time they would share a
living space. In fact, the two
former Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity members plan to
spend the rest of the semester
in close quarters.
"We are going to be
sleeping together on a
couch," Jennings said.
Jennings and Rothman
are two of 27 former mem
bers of the university chapter
scrambling to find housing
after a national charter revo
cation last week disbanded
the organization on the cam
pus. Officials told residents
they must vacate the house
by Friday and won't be al
lowed to live in any universi
ty-sponsored housing as a re
sult of the expulsion.
A complaint filed by a fra
ternity member led to an in
vestigation including inter
views with at least eight fra
ternity members. The organi
zation was charged with vio
lating the university's hazing
and alcohol policies, includ
ing forcing pledges to drink
underage, clean the house
and participate in late-night
lineups in the house base
ment during which brothers
screamed at and pushed
them. Pledges were also
forced to reveal embarrass
ing experiences while under
the influence at a Sigma
Alpha Epsilon-sponsored
party with a sorority.
As a result, the house on
Fraternity Row no longer be
longs to the organization, nor

does the university recognize
the chapter as an official stu
dent group. The event could
hurt the national organiza
tion's attempt for reinstate
ment on campus in 2008.
Many house residents still do
not know where they will live
after Friday. Some said they are
considering moving back home
and commuting to school for the
rest of the semester. Another
three have signed a lease to live
in an apartment.
With almost $4,000 worth of
housing and meal fees lost with
out refund, many say they can
not afford the financial burden
of signing another lease this
year, much less the inconve
nience of searching for an off
campus home mid-semester.
Rothman said he will pack
up his room this week and
spend his birthday driving a car
load of possessions back to his
home in New York before mov
ing onto a friend's couch. And
he and new couchmate Jen
nings consider themselves
lucky.
"A lot of kids still don't know
where they are living," Jennings
said. "We are lucky we found
people to look out for us."
Nick Ziegler, spokesman
for the national Sigma Alpha
Epsilon office, said residents
are being assisted in their
searches for alternative hous
ing options, a claim that
many denied.
"That's bulls —," Jennings
said. "Absolute bulls —."
He said only four residents
boarding inside the house —
with no affiliation to the fra
ternity — received help coor
dinating living arrangements.
The boarders were given pri
ority for on-campus housing,
said Mike Hayes, director of
the Office of Fraternity and
Sorority Life.
