## Editorial Be careful at Full Moon tonight 
### 
As legend has it. Full Moon on the Quad used
to be an orderly event. A line of seniors
would stand opposite a line of freshmen in
the Quad, and at midnight the two rows
would advance toward each other fora simple kiss —
perhaps a peck on the cheek was enough to initiate the
excited freshmen into the student ranks of Stanford.
Today, the quaint tradition of yore resembles
more of a drunken, free-for-all make-out session with
participants from all segments of the student body.
Full Moon is a unique Stanford event that should con
tinue to scandalize generations of freshmen to come,
but not if it fails to be a safe environment for those
who want to partake in the fun.
If you asked an alumnus of Stanford, he would tell
you that Full Moon used to be a spontaneous event with
little bureaucratic planning. Hut with the rise of reported
sexual assaults and alcohol-related incidents, the event
has become more structured over the years.
This year, event organizers hope that more secu
rity officers and bright lighting will help to create a
sense of safety for students. But all of this added
planning and regulation threatens to undermine the
free-spirited tone of one of Stanford's most unique
traditions.

There was also an increase in precautions taken to
minimize risky behavior among participants, and five
students still ended up going to the emergency room
to he treated for acute alcohol poisoning. In addition,
a number of students reported that they had been
sexually assaulted or had engaged in sexual activity
while drunk that they later regretted.
This seems to suggest that more regulation and
policing at Full Moon is not the answer. And the ar
gument that extreme drunkenness is inevitable
should not be used as an excuse to ignore the few but
significant instances of assault or disrespect that can
occur.
Students should be aware of their limits and of the
fact that alcohol is not a prerequisite for having a
good time. A steamy kiss or a glimpse of an exhibi
tionist's streaking can be better enjoyed — and prob
ably better remembered — while sober.
With some University officials questioning the
merit of Full Moon on the Quad, it is important for
students to recognize the safety issues that underlie
this beloved tradition. If everyone involved takes
precautions and shows good judgment. Full Moon
can continue being an entertaining event where
harmless impulses can be fulfilled.
