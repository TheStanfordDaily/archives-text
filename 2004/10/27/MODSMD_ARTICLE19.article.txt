## Don't blame the sweaty delivery guy 
### MIKE MCCUNNIFF-REID 
I have read and re-read and re
read and highlighted Yamanda
Wright's article regarding tipping
("Since when did tips become ex
pected?" Oct. 26). I looked and
looked and looked to see what her
point was.
It seems she is upset because her
pizza at 680 Lomita did not arrive on
time. First, let me offer Yamanda
my deepest sympathies at her lack of
food in 680 over the weekend.
I myself, drawing 1770, was fortu
nate to be able to live in a place that
offers food for every meal in lovely
Stern Dining. Life over there in 680
with her two-room doubles sure
must be tough.
So it is unfortunate that her
Domino's didn't arrive very quickly.
I am sure that if Yamanda would
have called up Domino's to com
plain about the pizza being so late,
they would have either refunded her
money or at least offered her a free
pizza at a later date.
I know the owner of Domino's,
Gustavo, and he strives to maintain
excellent customer serv ice.
Instead of this solution, she de
cides to proceed on a verbal tirade,
attacking the pizza man and the en

tire system of gratuity without any
real knowledge of the issues. And
worse, The Daily decided to publish
this garbage.
Could she have verbally attacked
the pizza delivery guy anymore than
she did? I le is "sketch."
Why? I le sweats? Why? Perhaps
because he's working so hard. That,
or he has a sweating disorder, which
is also sad.
He is Mr. Melodramatic? She
seems to be a little Ms. Melodramat
ic herself over this late pizza. Wild
hand gestures? Mock fluster? I guess
he's just putting on a show for her.
Yamanda is right. The pizza man
should not have walked away with
her twenty. He should have given her
the appropriate change. His mistake.
Call Gustavo at Domino's to com
plain. (iustavo will take care of her.
Ridiculous extra charges already
attached to the pizza delivery she
says? If Yamanda meant $1.50 from
Domino's because their pizza is
about half the cost of all the other
pizza places, then yes, this $1.50 is
ridiculous.
Don't order the pizza. Go to
Stern dining. I do.
"You didn't answer the phone
and no one was in the lounge to let
me in,"the pizza man said.

Why didn't she answer the
phone? She prefers to blame the
sweating delivery man.
I las she ever worked in a restau
rant? I doubt it.
I have, st> let me provide some
perspective on the restaurant indus
try. Waiters are paid poorly — nor
mally minimum wage — and make
the majority of their money in tips.
If restaurant owners were to pay
their waiters more and not expect
tips, they would simply pass that
cost onto you. Your food would cost
15 percent more. Economics, any
one?
One doesn't have to tip 15 per
cent if the service is bad. In my opin
ion one's tip should range from 10
percent to 25 percent depending on
the service.
If you plan on tipping any less
than 10 percent, then a meeting with
the manager of the restaurant to dis
cuss your complaint is in order.
I do hope that in Yamanda's next
column that she approaches the is
sues with a little more class and
thought to avoid looking like a
cheap complainer.
