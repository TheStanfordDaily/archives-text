### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA 
When students show up to the
first day of "The House of Won
ders," a Student Initiated Course of
fered winter quarter, they can rest
assured about the credit they will re
ceive for their in-class adventures.
For the first time this year, the
courses, which are entirely student
taught. will be offered through indi
vidual departments instead of being
listed as directed readings. They will
even have their own course num
bers.
"Now courses get listed in the
Time Schedule, the class title fea
tures in the enrolling students' tran
scripts and.in general, departments
are more receptive to providing ad
ministrative aid to classes," wrote
senior Karan Mahajan, last year's
program coordinator, in an e-mail.
"Further, allowing student initi
ated courses to have course numbers
provides the program with legitima
cy and also raises the bar for the
quality of course material."
Four Student Initiated Courses,
two of which cover U.S. cybersecui i
ty and international children's
health and survival, are offered this
quarter.
According to Mahajan, the insti
tutionalization of the courses has led
to improvements in the program.
"There is now more quality con
trol in faculty sponsor/student inter
actions, a more rigorous application
process and better outreach," he


JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily
said, adding that the courses now
have more legitimacy in the eyes of
faculty members.
Next quarter, the program will
offer a total of 13 courses.
"We always offer more classes in
the winter and spring quarters than
in the fall," said junior Alyssa
Schwartz, program co-coordinator.
One of these courses will he on
Medical Vietnamese, which will
teach students how to communicate
with Vietnamese-speaking patients.
"Often times, first-generation
Vietnamese people in America have
a hard time finding adequate health
care because of the language barri
er." Schwartz said. "This course will
teach students various medical terms
and conditions in Vietnamese and
will also include volunteer experi
ence at a local clinic."
All of the courses, according to
Schwartz, stress learning through
community service and encourage
students to get involved outside of
campus.
Junior Mike Seiler teaches a stu
dent initiated course on the United
Nations this quarter.

"These courses allow students to
take subjects they are interested in
but to which they do not necessarily
want to commit a lull five units," he
said. "It is also a good way for stu
dents to share their academic inter
ests with the rest of the student
body."
For"The House of Wonders,"
students will go to places such as odd
bathrooms throughout the campus
to the Hannah house, built by Frank
Lloyd Wright.
"This program is an exciting op
portunity for all involved," Schwartz
said. "1 encourage students to take
one of our student initiated classes
or even apply to teach a course in the
upcoming year."
Schwartz and Mahajan said the
program started about four years
ago and has had great success.
The courses count for one to two
units and are led entirely by stu
dents. Any student on campus can
teach such a course; the only re
quirements are a faculty sponsor, a
well-planned syllabus and a good
idea.

students are also required to take
classes at the Center for Teaching
and Learning. While the majority
of such courses focus on the hu
manities, the subjects of the courses
vary; one course focuses on the
Beatles.
The classes meet once a week for
two hours and can have anywhere
from one to three student teachers.
Each class, however, is in a seminar
format, and enrollment is limited to
20 students.
"The student initiated courses
allow students to be directly en
gaged in the academic process; stu
dents learn to teach and possibly
decide whether they want to pursue
a career in academia." Schwartz
said.
"Student initiated courses are
one of the few avenues at Stanford
for students to explore their inter

"The program fosters close facul

students are also required to take
classes at the Center for Teaching
and Learning. While the majority
of such courses focus on the hu
manities, the subjects of the courses
vary; one course focuses on the
Beatles.
The classes meet once a week for
two hours and can have anywhere
from one to three student teachers.
Each class, however, is in a seminar
format, and enrollment is limited to
20 students.
"The student initiated courses
allow students to be directly en
gaged in the academic process; stu
dents learn to teach and possibly
decide whether they want to pursue
a career in academia." Schwartz
said.
"Student initiated courses are
one of the few avenues at Stanford
for students to explore their inter
ests in academia and teaching," Ma

"The program fosters close facul
ty-student interaction and provides
experience in assembling syllabi and
teaching seminars."
