## Anti-Semite label too often misused 
### MEHDI JAVANMARI 
Last Wednesday night. I attend
ed the talk entitled "Surviving the
Holocaust: Witnessing History Re
peated" by Hedy Epstein. I found
her talk to he interesting because
here in the United States, we rarely
hear the views of Jewish people who
are critical of the Israeli govern
ment.
Throughout the talk, Epstein
condemned suicide bombings, and
she repeatedly stated her wish for
the security of the state of Israel.
Yet she also condemned the actions
of the Israeli government in the oc
cupied territories. She never made a
single comparison between Israelis
and Nazis, and rightfully so.
Unfortunately, throughout the
talk, many pro-Israelis were acting
rudely and disruptively. This type of
uncivilized behavior is not helpful in
establishing a dialogue to create un
derstanding between both sides.
There were many rude com
ments shouted out throughout the
talk, however there was one that

truly stuck with me. At the end of
the talk. I remember one Israeli man
standing up and shouting, "Hedy
Epstein, you are an anti-Semite."
I found his statement to be both
comical and frightening at the same
time. As far as I remember, Epstein
herself is Jewish. Her parents were
killed in the Ilolocaust, and she fled
from Germany when she was eight
years old to escape persecution.
Unless she hates herself for some
strange reason, I don't see how she
could be an anti-Semite.
The reason why I find the state
ment to be frightening is quite sim
ple. It is sad to see that there are Is
raelis who are unwilling to accept
the slightest bit of criticism towards
their government, even from a Jew
ish Holocaust survivor.
The reason for this is most likely
due to the fact that if the views anil
voices of Jewish people who oppose
the policies of the Israeli govern
ment were to become public, it
would be impossible to maintain the
lie that any criticism of the Israeli
government is by definition anti-

Semitic.
By indiscriminately labeling peo
ple anti-Semites, especially a harm
less <S() year-old Jewish Holocaust
survivor, a mockery is being made of
the term, and attention is not being
focused on those who truly are anti-
Semites and have evil intentions.
The fact that real anti-Semitism
exists in the world today makes it
necessary to differentiate between
real anti-Semitism, which is con
demnable and needs to be opposed,
and its misuse as a public relations
strategy.
The McCarthyesque style of la
beling those who merely criticize the
Israeli government and the occupa
tion of Palestinian lands as anti-
Semites is not only an unethical tac
tic used for the purpose of intimida
tion and silencing of dissent. Most
importantly, it detracts from the
threat that real anti-Semitism poses.
