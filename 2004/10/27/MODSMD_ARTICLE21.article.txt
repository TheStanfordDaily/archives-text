## Congress — not voters — could decide election 
### 
Of the 50 states and Wash
ington, D.C., the battle
ground for the presidency
has come down to 11.
John Kerry has pulled his staff out of
once-promising states such as Mis
souri, and rival George W. Bush has
conceded several, including New
Jersey.
The future of our country lies in
the hands of a few voters in a few
states scattered across the Midwest.
To help all of you who have not
spent the past months poring over
polling data — not that 1 have —
here is a reduced version of what has
to happen on election day to produce
a winner:
First, the big states: Florida (27
votes), Pennsylvania (21 votes),
Ohio (20 votes) and Michigan (17
votes).
Florida has only gone Democratic
once since 1980, and the Republican
forces at work in the state bureaucra
cy are not making things easy for
them. Michigan has gone to the
Democrats the last three times and
most polls indicate that this time is
business as usual. So let's split the two.
Ohio and Pennsylvania are some
what trickier.
Polls in Teresa's home state of
Pennsylvania have never had Kerry
trailing, but the margin is by no
means comfortable. Historically, the
state went to Clinton twice and to
Gore four years ago, but Bush is
banking that the large Roman
Catholic population that has sent
two Republican senators to the hill
will help him out. Let's give it to
Kerry, for now.
Ohio is a similar story. Out of the
last five Ohio polls, none of them has
a candidate winning by more than
the margin of error. In recent days,
two polls have shown Kerry pulling
slightly ahead (perhaps a credit to
those loyal Democrats who spend
their Sunday afternoons calling
Ohioans at home). Because Kerry is
sunk without it, let's once again
humor ourselves and give it to him.
The medium states: Minnesota
and Wisconsin are 10 apiece.
Minnesota, the Gopher state, has
not gone red since Nixon's romp in
1972, and Gore carried it by a healthy
margin in 2000. While Bush has

never led, the polls right now have it
dead even.
Gore also carried Wisconsin, as
have the Democrats in the last four
elections. But polls there are mixed
— some even showing Bush with a
comfortable lead — causing us to
once again split the two. You decide
who gets which.

Scoreboard:
Bush needs 17
and Kerry 12. The
small states; New
Hampshire, New
Mexico, Nevada,
Arkansas and
lowa total 27 elec
toral votes.
Bush has led all
the way in Nevada,
but Kerry has
opened up a nine-

point lead in New Hampshire, which
went to W. last time around. Split 'em.
Gore won New Mexico by less
than a thousand votes, and various
polls show different leaders.
Arkansas, although home to Clin
ton and "Hope" and currently tied,
would be an unlikely victory fora
senator from Massachusetts. lowa
too is tied, but has not gone Repub
lican since I was born, so lets give
Bush the first two and the latter to
Kerry.
Final Score: Bush 269, Kerry 269.
What is this? A tie? In America?
But ties are for things like Cana
dian hockey or European Soccer,
certainly not American democracy.
Do we get co-presidents? Not
exactly.
What we do get is a vote in the
House, with each state delegation
getting a vote, and 30 of the 50 —
sorry D.C., no voice here — are dom
inated by Republicans. In other
words, the 35 million people of Cali
fornia have as much voting power as
the 500,000 people of Wyoming.
Bush wins.
In 2000 Bush won with the
Supreme Court and in 2004 he wins
with Congress? It seems that at some
point, he should have to win with the
people.
