Professors represented own views
I am writing in response to Sarah
Rizk's coverage of the Blacker / Kras
ner debate that was held on Monday
evening. There are two points that I
would like to address: one of oversight
and the other of journalistic inaccuracy.
First, there was no mention of the
sponsor of the event. Stanford in
Government, a non-partisan student
run organization on campus dedicat
ed to promoting political awareness
at Stanford and in the community.
The debate between Prof. Blacker
and Prof. Krasner was part of SIGs
2(X)4 Voter Education Series. SIGs
members work very hard to organize
events such as these for the campus and
community, and the failure to mention
SIG as the organizer and sponsor was
an unfortunate oversight.
Second, and more importantly, is the
issue of journalistic inaccuracy. Rizk
writes. "Though Krasner and Blacker
officially came into the discussion rep
resenting the Republican and Demo
cratic tickets, respectively, each noted
that they were expressing their person
al views rather than those explicitly en
dorsed by the campaigns." This is com
pletely untrue.
SIG asked the professors to engage
in this debate only because of their
personal views, and anyone who was
in attendance will remember the col
lective chuckle that went through the
audience when Prof. Blacker noted in
formally that the Kerry campaign
would have a heart attack if they knew
he was speaking on behalf of their side.
Rizk could have easily spoken
with SIG representative Adam Isen,
who served as the moderator of the
debate, to ensure accuracy when re
porting on the circumstances and par
ticipants of the event.
SIG appreciates the excellent cover
age that The Daily has given to our
events in the past, and we hope that this
was one isolated incident of oversight
and inaccuracv.

I encourage The Daily to engage in
fact-checking with sponsoring organi
zations to prevent misleading asser
tions about professors, students and the
campus as a whole.

Arafat rejected peace treaty
As an alum, former Daily writer and
columnist visiting campus last week, I
was quite dismayed to read about Hedy
Epstein's talk and the question of
whether the current Middle East
dilemma has any legitimate compari
son with the Holocaust.
The answer is very clear. There is
one irrefutable similarity. It is not, how
ever, the one alleged in the talk; the one
indelible link with the Holocaust is that
once again — like Hitler and the Nazis
— a murderous, brutal dictator, Yasser
Arafat, is exterminating innocent Jews.
In their recent books, both former
president Bill Clinton and former
Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross
state that Yasser Arafat, despite urg
ings by Arab heads of State, rejected
the Israeli and American offer of 95
percent of the West Bank, a Palestini
an state with its capital in East
Jerusalem and billions of dollars in
economic aid for his people.
They claim in their writings and
speaking engagements that Arafat re
jected peace because he was and is still
unwilling to give up his lifelong struggle
to put an end to the democratic Jewish
state of Israel.
Instead of accepting an end to the
conflict, he created a bloody campaign
of terror to murder and maim inno
cent Israeli men, women and children.
And to achieve his goal, this Nobel
Peace Prize recipient has encouraged
suicide bombings and the self-inflicted
death of innocent Palestinian men,
women and children. The main differ
ence with the Holocaust is that this time
the Jews are fighting back, and that

seems to upset many people. To defend
themselves, Israelis are targeting the
organizers of the homicide bombings.
These cowardly terrorists shield
themselves with children and hide in
ambulances, schools, mosques and
churches. They do this with the under
standing that if Israel kills them, Israel
will also be blamed for killing innocent
children and civilians.
The terrorists' hope is that the world
will be fooled into believing that Israel
is as evil as they are.
But don't be fooled.

I want to agree with Uzair Khan that
disrupting Epstein's speech was rude
and counterproductive ("Epstein's
speech represented the two truths to
Middle East conflict." Oct. 26). How
ever, 1 would like to comment on his
statement asking, "since when has ig
norance become a value to uphold?"
Khan's words show him to be igno
rant of the situation. He says that
"Palestinians have nothing to protect
them from the bulldozers that knock
their houses down."
There are two reasons why Israel
takes down Palestinian homes.
One is to discourage the next suicide
bombers, because strapping explosives
on Israeli children to kill Palestinian
civilians is totally unacceptable. The
other is to police the weapons-smug
gling tunnels between Gaza and Egypt.
It is tragic that innocent Palestinian
civilians are caught in this terrible war.
Israel is forced to go after terrorists bent
on her destruction because the Pales
tinian Authority refuses to lift a finger
against them. As recently as May 15,
Yasir Arafat told his people to "find
what strength you have to terrorize
your enemy and the enemy of God."
