Omar Shakir said he uses his
post in the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate to address issues regarding
the cost of living at Stanford. "Stu
dents get nickled and dimed here
at Stanford, and survey after sur
vey shows that the cost of living is a
number-one concern of students,"
Shakir said. "Helping to lower
costs in the areas of athletics, din
ing and technology really helps stu
dents and is without question my
top priority as a member of the
ASSU." A sophomore majoring in
political science, Shakir is also the
chair of the ASSU Advocacy Com
mittee. "Students need to lose their
apathy about activism," he said.
"The ASSU can only be a voice for
students if they involve themselves
in its issues and decisions."

Lauren Graham is the deputy
chair of advocacy. A sophomore,
she is planning on majoring in inter
national relations and sociology. She
said her main goal for this coming
year is to facilitate communication
between the Senate and the student
body. She said she wants people to
understand how to network and uti
lize campus resources. She believes
there is a dearth of knowledge sur
rounding practical student group is
sues, such as how to reserve rooms
and plan large events. She also feels
that there could be a better way to
centralize publicity for student
events. Currently, she said, students
rely heavily on e-mails and flyers to
learn what is going on around cam
pus. Finally, she said that the ASSU
needs to "hash out issues between
supporting and advocacy."

Chris is a sophomore consider
ing a major in economics or political
science. He said one of his main
goals for the ASSU is to work more
closely with Information and Tech
nology Student Services to cut costs
for services that it provides. Instead
of paying a separate internet bill, he
proposed that the cost of internet be
included on the quarterly bill so that
scholarships and financial aid can
cover this cost. "We should be fo
cusing on campus issues more, like
ITSS, housing, dining, and cost of
books," he said. He believes that
one of the challenges that the ASSU
faces this year is special-fees re
form, and he suggested creating
some type of formula to more accu
rately decide which student groups
are more deserving of ASSU funds.

Katie Salisbury, a sophomore
considering majoring in English or
feminist studies, said she is excited
about her post as the chair of the
new Communications Committee.
"The whole purpose of the senate is
to represent the student body and
serve their needs and interests," she
said. She said that another impor
tant priority is to consolidate fees
associated with living at Stanford
onto the university bill. "Students
are faced with a lot of fees that are a
part of the overall cost of living here
at Stanford. These fees present
great burdens to many students, es
pecially those on scholarship and fi
nancial aid, but are not on the uni
versity bill. I am committed to find
ing ways of placing more costs of
living on the university bill."

Seepan Parseghian is the deputy
chair of appropriations on the Polit
ical Advocacy Committee. A
sophomore majoring in political
science, he said he is concerned
with making the Stanford commu
nity more aware of campus issues
involving diversity and political ac
tivism. "My goal is to engage and
support increased dialogue within
the undergraduate student body on
issues of ideology, politics, and cul
ture," he said. "I want students to
know that the ASSU can be an ac
tive participant in this dialogue."
Parseghian also said that few stu
dents are aware of their ability to
access the Senate. "We want to
make students realize that the
ASSU is receptive and responsive
to their issues and concerns "

Chris Lin, the chair of Undergraduate Senate, is a returning senator
and a senior majoring in biomedical computation. Lin has several top pri
orities for the Senate this school year. As the chair, Lin said that he wants
"senators to know where their resources are to get stuff done." He also
said that special fees are a priority, to ensure that they are distributed fair
ly and efficiently. Lin also added that he would like to educate students
about how to use them. "Few students realize that ASSU fees are the
most vital component of ensuring that student life is as great as it is at
Stanford," he said. Lin said that the biggest problem with the ASSU is a
lack of communication between the Senate and the student body. As part
of a solution, the Senate will hold its weekly meeting in different dorms
starting in Toyon Hall on Nov. 9.

Dan Stringer, a junior major
ing in Science and Technology in
Society, is a member of the Ap
propriations Committee. He said
he is primarily concerned with the
allocation of funds to student
groups. He feels that groups need
to communicate more effectively
with the ASSU so that the ASSU
can more accurately represent
their interests. Stringer also said
he is focused on soliciting the
opinions of the entire Stanford
population on campus issues. "In
the ASSU senate, we want to
make sure as many viewpoints are
heard as possible. Often, vocal mi
norities are best heard in the leg
islative process. We need to make
an effort to get the general senti
ments of the population."

Adia Gooden serves on the
Appropriations and Student Life
Committees. A sophomore, she
is planning to major in Psycholo
gy and Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity. She said her
top priority for the ASSU this
year is making sure that "student
groups get the support they need
as far as funding goes." She said
she feels that certain changes
need to be made to special fees
and that the ASSU needs to work
with the administration to alter
policies regarding facilities
rentals. "We're people, we're
human and we're working for
vou," said Gooden.

Luz Reyes is a member of the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
Advocacy Committee. She said
her focus as a senator this year is
on supporting the actions and
ideas of the many different com
munities on campus. "The ASSU
supports the endeavors of com
munity centers." she said. "One
of my main goals is to foster mul
ticultural viewpoints." Reyes, a
sophomore majoring in political
science, said she is also highly
concerned with the ASSU's abili
ty to communicate with the stu
dent body. But. she said, the
newly founded Communications
Committee can "do much to en
lighten the students about the ac
tions of the ASSU."

Winston is a junior majoring
in biological sciences. One of his
main goals this year is to lower
equipment rental fees on cam
pus. He said he believes one of
the major challenges that the
ASSU faces is to explain the
work that they do to more of the
student body. "We influence all
student groups, but how we do
that is not well advertised," he
said. He also said he believes
there should be more communi
cation between the different
branches of the ASSU. He cited
the recent controversy over the
allocation of 20 percent of stu
dent group funds as one negative
effect of the lack of communica
tion with student groups and
within the ASSU.

Anita is a sophomore majoring
in mathematics or economics. She
said she wants to see special fees
become more sustainable and
more selective. She also said she
wants to revamp the Draw Guide
for student housing and make stu
dents more aware of the Stanford
Saver program, which she said
saves students a lot of money on
many different things. She said she
feels that communication is an
issue between the ASSU and the
student body and would like to see
more understanding between the
two groups. "Things we do really
affect students," she said. She said
she believes that the ASSU should
get more information our to stu
dents about its affect on student
groups and student life.

Ashley is a sophomore majoring
in political science. She is the Stu
dent Life Committee Chair and said
her main goal is to increase social
events on campus. She is interested
in promoting non-alcoholic events
on campus as well as restoring Big
Game traditions. "We used to do
things for the Big Game that aren't
done anymore, and we are working
hard to change that," she said. One
of the major challenges she said the
ASSU is facing in the coming year is
its "negative connotation" among
the student body. She said that
some of the past controversies sur
rounding the ASSU have caused
negative buzz on campus, and she
believes that the organization
should work hard to change stu
dents' perception of the ASSU.

Adrian Boscolo-Hightower, a ju
nior majoring in sociology and mi
noring human biology, is on the Ap
propriations and Advocacy Com
mittees. He said his top priority is to
achieve greater ASSU support for
student organizations that repre
sent students of color on campus.
He said that another, more specific,
issue he hopes to tackle this year is
that of parties being forced to end at
1 a.m. In terms of challenges the
ASSU will face this year, Adrian
said he is concerned that "students
have a disconnect with the ASSU,
in terms of us being enlarged on a
broad political scale." He said he
would like to work to restore credi
bility to the ASSU and to make sure
that students know that the ASSU
is looking out for their best inter
ests.

Russell is a sophomore consid
ering a major in political science or
economics. One of his main goals is
to work with Stanford Dining to in
crease flexibility in meal plans. He
said he believes that there are too
many different meal plans and that
students are finding the structure of
the less-expensive plans too rigid.
He identified election reform as a
major issue that the ASSU needs to
resolve. "There should be a
smoother election process, a clean
er election process, in order for all
parties to have a fair chance," he
said. He said he also wants to con
tinue protecting students' rights of
expression and free speech on cam
pus.

Shania Fregia. a senior majoring
in communications and minoring in
political science, serves on the Ap
propriation and Advocacy Commit
tees. She said she is especially con
cerned that she "leaves student
groups in a better position this
year." Fregia said that communica
tions and special fees are the two
major challenges that the ASSU will
face this year. The issues are com
munications and special fees. She
ensures that the senators will "keep
their ear to the ground." Some stu
dents, she said, do not even realize
that all ASSU meetings are com
pletely open. For this quarter, spe
cial fees refund rates are fairly low,
but Fregia said that historically the
rates rise after fall quarter and that
the ASSU will do everything possi
ble to avoid a financial crisis.
