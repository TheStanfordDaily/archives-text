## Entanglement with Ottawa leads to 10th-place finish for Card 
### WES MATEO 
Racing on a course shortened by more
than one kilometer due to windy condi
tions, and facing collegiate and internation
al competition in their first race of the sea
son, both the women's Varsity and
lightweight crews put forth promising per
formances at the 40th annual Head of the
Charles Regatta on the Charles River in
Boston, Mass.
In the Women's Lightweight Eight
event Sunday, the Stanford lightweight
boat posted a course time of 14:06.348 min
utes, good for 10th place overall and fourth
among collegiate crews. The lightweight
women likely would have placed higher,
were it not fora disconcerting run-in with
the Ottawa Rowing Club boat just before
the course's halfway mark.
Starting one spot behind the Ottawa
boat, the Stanford women quickly closed

the gap and looked to pass. Unfortunate
ly, approaching the Weld Boathouse in
the short stretch between two sharp, con
secutive curves, things didn't go as
smoothly as they could have. Ottawa's
boat failed to take its first turn as sharply
as it should have, leaving it unable to yield
properly and in a position obstructing
Stanford's passage.
The two boats clashed oars several
times before finally separating, resulting in
a disqualification for Ottawa and the loss
of precious time and rhythm for Stanford.
"We started the race with a really good
rhythm, but couldn't quite get it back," said
senior captain Kristina Peterson.
Yet despite the costly run-in with Ot
tawa, Stanford's boat still finished within
fifteen seconds of a fifth-place finish, and
10 seconds ahead of Cal's boat.
"We took a really aggressive strategy
that reflects the attitude behind a really

strong, lively team that just wants to go
after it," said Peterson.
The team's race strategy drew from the
experience of freshman Ariane Thompson,
a Boston native who rowed on the Charles
during high school and sat in the seven seat
of Stanford's boat. Thompson's knowledge
of the river aided the development of navi
gational and stroke rating plans for the
course's difficult curves and bridges â€”
plans which cox Elise Menke did a great job
executing, according to teammates
Thompson and Peterson.
Coming off their lOth-place finish in
Boston, the team heads to Sacramento's
Lake Natoma for the Head of the Ameri
can this weekend. The focus, Peterson said,
will be on building up the unity of the boat
and a sense of cohesiveness.
So while the team's effort at the Head of
