## Entanglement with Ottawa leads to 10th-place finish for Card 
### WES MATEO 
Racing on a course shortened by more
than one kilometer due to windy condi
tions, and facing collegiate and internation
al competition in their first race of the sea
son, both the women's Varsity and
lightweight crews put forth promising per
formances at the 40th annual Head of the
Charles Regatta on the Charles River in
Boston, Mass.
In the Women's Lightweight Eight
event Sunday, the Stanford lightweight
boat posted a course time of 14:06.348 min
utes, good for 10th place overall and fourth
among collegiate crews. The lightweight
women likely would have placed higher,
were it not fora disconcerting run-in with
the Ottawa Rowing Club boat just before
the course's halfway mark.
Starting one spot behind the Ottawa
boat, the Stanford women quickly closed

the gap and looked to pass. Unfortunate
ly, approaching the Weld Boathouse in
the short stretch between two sharp, con
secutive curves, things didn't go as
smoothly as they could have. Ottawa's
boat failed to take its first turn as sharply
as it should have, leaving it unable to yield
properly and in a position obstructing
Stanford's passage.
The two boats clashed oars several
times before finally separating, resulting in
a disqualification for Ottawa and the loss
of precious time and rhythm for Stanford.
"We started the race with a really good
rhythm, but couldn't quite get it back," said
senior captain Kristina Peterson.
Yet despite the costly run-in with Ot
tawa, Stanford's boat still finished within
fifteen seconds of a fifth-place finish, and
10 seconds ahead of Cal's boat.
"We took a really aggressive strategy
that reflects the attitude behind a really

strong, lively team that just wants to go
after it," said Peterson.
The team's race strategy drew from the
experience of freshman Ariane Thompson,
a Boston native who rowed on the Charles
during high school and sat in the seven seat
of Stanford's boat. Thompson's knowledge
of the river aided the development of navi
gational and stroke rating plans for the
course's difficult curves and bridges —
plans which cox Elise Menke did a great job
executing, according to teammates
Thompson and Peterson.
Coming off their lOth-place finish in
Boston, the team heads to Sacramento's
Lake Natoma for the Head of the Ameri
can this weekend. The focus, Peterson said,
will be on building up the unity of the boat
and a sense of cohesiveness.
So while the team's effort at the Head of

the Charles demonstrated the
team's potential, "it didn't tell us
anything we didn't already know,"
said head coach A1 Acosta. "We've
got to gel fitter and row better."
In the Women's Championship
Eight event Sunday afternoon, the
Stanford women's varsity boat com
pleted the shortened course in
12:54.167 minutes to finish 16th
overall and 11th out of 35 collegiate
entries. Within the first thousand
meters of the race, the Stanford
Varsity faced its first challenge of
the year — a charging University of
Virginia boat, closing in rapidly
from behind.
The Stanford women had two
options: either to back down or to
fight it out. They chose the latter.
Although unable to keep pace with
UVA, who finished as the third
fastest collegiate boat, the Stanford
women picked up the pace and man
aged to make up ground over the re
mainder of the race.
"It's a huge credit to the team as

a whole," said Alexis Peterson, who
rowed in the 5-seat. "We kept our
focus and didn't let that [UVA
charge] break us."
A prime factor enabling the
boat to finish strong was that "the
rowers did an awesome job staying
tough," added senior cox Kelly
Garneski.
The rowers had praise for Gar
neski as well.
"Having had only one chance to
practice [the course], Kelly made
great calls," said Peterson. "There's
one huge turn where the ports go
down to a half stroke and the star
boards go hard, but Kelly was on her
game the whole time."
Nevertheless, though pleased
with the effort at the Head of the
Charles, the team's sights are set far
down the road.
"Our main goal for this early
season race was to push for every
minute of the race," said coach
Aimee Baker. "I felt that the crew
did this. But it is not our goal to have

Men's squad to row in
Head of the American

the HOCR be our fastest race of the
year."
The men's team heads to Sacra
mento this weekend for the Head of
the American (HOA). Men's head
coach Craig Amerkhanian plans to
tweak his lineup for the regatta.
The men's lone eight will likely
feature younger oarsmen in the
stern, and more experienced ones in
the bow. Such a lineup. Amerkhani
an said, will give new members of
the varsity team experience rowing
in those particular seats at a higher
level of competition.
"Traditionally the HOA is the
starting point for our novice crew
team and a small-boats regatta for
our Varsity group." said head
coach of the men's novice team Jon
Allbin.
For members of the novice team,
the HOA serves as a preview of the
race course and competition that
they will face at Championships in
the spring, he added.
