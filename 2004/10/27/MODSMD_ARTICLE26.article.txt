# USC, Cal post matching 38-0 wins
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was an unusual weekend in the Pa
cific-10 Conference, with two 38-0
shutouts, two games decided by less than
a touchdown and a surprising, season
turning Oregon State-Washington State
contest.
The Oregon schools, which had a com
bined record of 2-7 just two weeks ago, are
now tied for second (Oregon) and fifth
(Oregon State) in the conference.
Meanwhile, the Washington schools,
which have performed very well in recent
years, sit in eighth (Washington State) and
ninth (Washington) place, with a com
bined 1-7 mark against conference foes.
No. 1 Southern California 38, Washington 0
This one was hardly a surprise, but it
was still a depressing game for the Huskies
(1-6, 0-4), whose leading rusher had more
yards (38) than their leading passer (36).
For the defending national champions
(7-0, 4-0), LenDale White rushed for 94
yards and two touchdowns on 17 carries,
and Reggie Bush added a combined total
of 109 rushing and receiving yards and
scored once.
The Huskies' defense held Matt Leinart
to 21-of-43 passing for 217 yards, two
touchdowns and an interception, but its
own offense stalled time and again, as Sean
Douglas punted 10 times and Michael
Braunstein missed two field-goal attempts.
Thirteen different Trojans caught at
least one pass, while Casey Paus and Isaiah
Stanback completed just seven passes for
Washington. They combined to go an as
tonishing 7-of-28 for 63 yards and an inter
ception against USC's conference-leading
defense.
No. 7 California 38, Arizona 0
Not to be outdone by the Trojans, the
Golden Bears slapped an identical shutout
on the Wildcats — and unlike the Trojans,
the Bears did it on the road.
Aaron Rodgers threw three touchdown
passes in the second quarter and finished
20-of-27 for 235 yards for Cal (5-1, 3-1),
while J.J. Arrington, the Pac-10's runaway
rushing leader, ran 24 times for 140 yards
and a score. Geoff Mac Arthur led Cal's re
ceivers with six catches for 94 yards and a
touchdown.
The Wildcats (1-6, 0-4) got 99 yards on
17 carries from the dependable Mike Bell,
but redshirt freshman Richard Kovalcheck

completed just 13-of-32 passes for 159
yards against the Pac-10's second-ranked
defense.
No. 20 Arizona State 48, UCLA 42
The Sun Devils scored 17 points in the
fourth quarter to erase an 11-point fourth
quarter deficit. They did it in grand fash
ion, as Andrew Walter threw a 46-yard
touchdown to Derek Hagan and a 65-yard
touchdown to Terry Richardson to reclaim
the lead for the Devils.
Walter threw six touchdowns in total
(and three interceptions) and was 25-of-51
for 415 yards. The Bruins' Drew Olson also
racked up the yards, completing 30-of-44
attempts for 325 yards and two scores, al
though he was picked off four times.
Manuel White Jr. rushed for 81 yards
and a touchdown on just eight carries for
UCLA (4-3, 2-2), who also got a 61-yard
run from Chris Markey and 62 yards and a
touchdown on 15 carries by Maurice Drew.
Also for the visitors. Tab Perry caught five
balls for 66 yards and had a 12-yard touch
down run.
For Arizona State (6-1, 3-1), Hagan
caught five balls for 166 yards and three
touchdowns, Richardson caught seven for
159 yards and a touchdown, and redshirt
freshman Preston Jones rushed 16 times
for 76 yards.
Both the Bruins' Justin Medlock and
the Devils' Jesse Ainsworth were two-for
two on field goals and 4-for-4 on extra
points. Medlock has yet to miss this season
(nine-of-nine), while Ainsworth (12-of-16)
leads the Pac-10 in scoring and field goals
made.
Oregon 16, Stanford 13
The Ducks (4-3, 3-1) continued their
surprising turnaround with a narrow win
over the host Cardinal (4-3, 2-2). Jared
Siegel booted three field goals for Oregon,
while Michael Sgroi added two for Stan
ford, as neither team reached the end zone
until the fourth quarter.
Terrence Whitehead rushed 28 times
for 135 yards and a touchdown and caught
eight passes for 92 yards to lead the Ducks,
who got 275 yards on 22-of-33 passing by
Kellen Clemens.
Stanford rushed for minus-eight yards
due to 10 Oregon sacks, but T.C. Ostran
der was 18-of-29 passing for 236 yards and
a touchdown. Starter Trent Edwards left
the game after one quarter of play with a

Like the Bears and Trojans, the Beavers scored 38
Saturday. Although they didn't get the shutout like
those teams, the hosts did gain an important victory as
they try to rebound from a difficult 1-4 start.
For the Beavers (3-4. 2-2), Derek Anderson threw

ing, Ryan Cole rushed for 109 yards and a score on just
12 carries. Dwight Writ>ht ran 21 times for 83 yards and

Swogger, completed just 15-of-41 passes for 201 yards,

Like the Bears and Trojans, the Beavers scored 38
Saturday. Although they didn't get the shutout like
those teams, the hosts did gain an important victory as
they try to rebound from a difficult 1-4 start.
For the Beavers (3-4. 2-2), Derek Anderson threw
for 270 yards and three touchdowns on 18-of-39 pass
ing, Ryan Cole rushed for 109 yards and a score on just
12 carries. Dwight Writ>ht ran 21 times for 83 yards and

The Cougars (3-4, 1-3) got 107 yards and a touch

quarterback Anderson, starting in place of injured Josh
Swogger, completed just 15-of-41 passes for 201 yards,
a touchdown and two interceptions. The Cougars were
forced to punt 10 times.
Saturday: No. 1 USC @ Washington State; No. 20 Ari
zona Stale @ No. 7 Cal; Stanford @ UCLA; Washing
ton @ Oregon; Oregon State @ Arizona.
It was an unusual weekend in the Pa
cific-10 Conference, with two 38-0
shutouts, two games decided by less than
a touchdown and a surprising, season
turning Oregon State-Washington State
contest.
The Oregon schools, which had a com
bined record of 2-7 just two weeks ago, are
now tied for second (Oregon) and fifth
(Oregon State) in the conference.
Meanwhile, the Washington schools,
which have performed very well in recent
years, sit in eighth (Washington State) and
ninth (Washington) place, with a com
bined 1-7 mark against conference foes.
No. 1 Southern California 38, Washington 0
This one was hardly a surprise, but it
was still a depressing game for the Huskies
(1-6, 0-4), whose leading rusher had more
yards (38) than their leading passer (36).
For the defending national champions
(7-0, 4-0), LenDale White rushed for 94
yards and two touchdowns on 17 carries,
and Reggie Bush added a combined total
of 109 rushing and receiving yards and
scored once.
The Huskies' defense held Matt Leinart
to 21-of-43 passing for 217 yards, two
touchdowns and an interception, but its
own offense stalled time and again, as Sean
Douglas punted 10 times and Michael
Braunstein missed two field-goal attempts.
Thirteen different Trojans caught at
least one pass, while Casey Paus and Isaiah
Stanback completed just seven passes for
Washington. They combined to go an as
tonishing 7-of-28 for 63 yards and an inter
ception against USC's conference-leading
defense.
No. 7 California 38, Arizona 0
Not to be outdone by the Trojans, the
Golden Bears slapped an identical shutout
on the Wildcats — and unlike the Trojans,
the Bears did it on the road.
Aaron Rodgers threw three touchdown
passes in the second quarter and finished
20-of-27 for 235 yards for Cal (5-1, 3-1),
while J.J. Arrington, the Pac-10's runaway
rushing leader, ran 24 times for 140 yards
and a score. Geoff Mac Arthur led Cal's re
ceivers with six catches for 94 yards and a
touchdown.
The Wildcats (1-6, 0-4) got 99 yards on
17 carries from the dependable Mike Bell,
but redshirt freshman Richard Kovalcheck

completed just 13-of-32 passes for 159
yards against the Pac-10's second-ranked
defense.
No. 20 Arizona State 48, UCLA 42
The Sun Devils scored 17 points in the
fourth quarter to erase an 11-point fourth
quarter deficit. They did it in grand fash
ion, as Andrew Walter threw a 46-yard
touchdown to Derek Hagan and a 65-yard
touchdown to Terry Richardson to reclaim
the lead for the Devils.
Walter threw six touchdowns in total
(and three interceptions) and was 25-of-51
for 415 yards. The Bruins' Drew Olson also
racked up the yards, completing 30-of-44
attempts for 325 yards and two scores, al
though he was picked off four times.
Manuel White Jr. rushed for 81 yards
and a touchdown on just eight carries for
UCLA (4-3, 2-2), who also got a 61-yard
run from Chris Markey and 62 yards and a
touchdown on 15 carries by Maurice Drew.
Also for the visitors. Tab Perry caught five
balls for 66 yards and had a 12-yard touch
down run.
For Arizona State (6-1, 3-1), Hagan
caught five balls for 166 yards and three
touchdowns, Richardson caught seven for
159 yards and a touchdown, and redshirt
freshman Preston Jones rushed 16 times
for 76 yards.
Both the Bruins' Justin Medlock and
the Devils' Jesse Ainsworth were two-for
two on field goals and 4-for-4 on extra
points. Medlock has yet to miss this season
(nine-of-nine), while Ainsworth (12-of-16)
leads the Pac-10 in scoring and field goals
made.
Oregon 16, Stanford 13
The Ducks (4-3, 3-1) continued their
surprising turnaround with a narrow win
over the host Cardinal (4-3, 2-2). Jared
Siegel booted three field goals for Oregon,
while Michael Sgroi added two for Stan
ford, as neither team reached the end zone
until the fourth quarter.
Terrence Whitehead rushed 28 times
for 135 yards and a touchdown and caught
eight passes for 92 yards to lead the Ducks,
