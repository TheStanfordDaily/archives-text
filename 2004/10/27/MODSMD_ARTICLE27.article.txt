# Wager takes eighth place out of 16 at ICSA Nationals
## 
### STEPHEN DORSEY 
One year after placing third in 2003's
Pacific Coast Championship, where only
the top two sailors move on to nationals,
Stanford sophomore Emery Wager suc
ceeded in making it to the ICSA Men's
Singlehanded Nationals this year.
The ICSA Singlehanded Nationals
were held this past weekend, in Lake Min
netonka at the University of Minnesota.
Sailors were welcomed on Friday with
temperatures in the mid 50s and fairly
light wind speeds of eight knots. The
breeze picked up on Saturday afternoon
to 15-18 knots, and 16 races were com
pleted by the end of the weekend.
"1 knew that I needed to change my
mentality — instead of trying to make my
dinghy go fast. I needed to be more tact
ful," said Wager about his mindset coming
into the ICSA.
Wager had beaten his top competitors
in races in past weeks and expected a good

showing at this year's Nationals. With
light winds for most of the weekend,
Wager needed to be more stringent with
his dinghy, yet he still made tactical mis
takes and finished eighth out of sixteen
competitors.
Practicing a sport which he began eight
years ago, when his parents signed him up
for sailing lessons. Wager has grown into a
top National Singlehanded competitor.
"Although I wanted to do better this year,
I look forward to going to next year's
ICSA Singlehanded Nationals in
Hawaii," Wager said.
This past weekend also highlighted
the PCIYRA Freshman / Sophomore
Regatta at Mission Bay in San Diego,
Calif. The weather in San Diego was
beautiful over the weekend, and 12 races
were completed.
Stanford sent two teams to Mission
Bay: Team one consisted of sophomore
Adam Janik and freshman crew
Katherine Schlosser sailing in Divi
sion A, and Graham Brandt-Za
wadski, a sophomore, and crew Car
rie Denning, a freshman, in Division
B. Team two was comprised of
freshman Craig Page and freshman
crew Chloe Pinkerton for Division
A, while sophomore Engin Ayaz
and freshman crew Charlie Davis
sailed for Division B. The two teams
finished fourth and sixth, respec
tively out of 21 teams.
The junior varsity regatta was
an opportunity for the freshmen
and sophomores, who normally do
not sail during intersectional
events, to get out on the water and
compete.
"I'm really excited about the
team," said Stanford head coach Jay
Kehoe. "They are fun, they really
want to work hard, and after this re
gatta, the team is very promising."
On Sunday, approximately 100
alumni attended the Alumni and
Friends Regatta in Redwood City.
This annual event is a fundraiser to
help pay for Stanford's traveling ex
penses. Forty sailing alums sailed

during the afternoon, while mem
bers of the sailing team, Stanford
alums and others watched.
This year's Alumni Regatta was
dedicated to Drew Gashler, Class
of 1988, a former sailing team cap
tain who was killed in an avalanche

Kehoe knew Gashler personally
and regarded him as "a free spirit,
who always wanted to help us."
