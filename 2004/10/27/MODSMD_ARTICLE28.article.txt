### KAIYA REEVE STAFF WRITER 
It's on to nationals for the top doubles
team in the nation.
The top-ranked duo of junior KC Cork
ery and senior Sam Warburg wiped out the
competition this past weekend at the 2004
Wilson / ITA Regional Championships in
Berkeley. The Stanford pair plowed through
five rounds of opponents to win the champi
onship title, earning them a berth in the 2004
ITA Indoor Championships, which are to be
held Nov. 4-7 in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Corkery / Warburg went up against Cali
fornia's Patrick Briaud and Connor Niland
in the finals, with the crowd backing the
Berkeley favorites. The Stanford tandem,
however, gave the crowd a reason to go
home disappointed when Corkery / War
burg took the Cal duo to the cleaners, wiping
them out 8-2 and claiming the championship
victory.
"They played three Cal teams in a row,"

said Stanford head coach John Whitlinger.
"They got off to such good starts that they
[silenced] whatever crowd there was. There
were some [Cal] people there, and they were
ready to cheer mightily for the Bears. But
our guys got started so quickly, and that al
ways tends to quiet the home crowd."
Competition began on Saturday's second
round for the doubles pair as they nabbed an
8-5 victory over Oregon's Chris Liao and
Eric Pickard. Third-round play was a piece
of cake for Corkery / Warburg, who served
their way to an 8-1 win over Axel Elvik and
Timo Kienle of San Francisco.
In the quarterfinals, Corkery / Warburg
faced their first Cal opponents of the tourna
ment, Lennart Maack and Dean Wallace.
The Cal pair was a little bit more of a chal
lenge than the Stanford's previous oppo
nents, but they were dispatched 8-5, a win
that sent Corkery / Warburg on their way to
the semifinals.
