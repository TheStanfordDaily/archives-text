### KAIYA REEVE STAFF WRITER 
It's on to nationals for the top doubles
team in the nation.
The top-ranked duo of junior KC Cork
ery and senior Sam Warburg wiped out the
competition this past weekend at the 2004
Wilson / ITA Regional Championships in
Berkeley. The Stanford pair plowed through
five rounds of opponents to win the champi
onship title, earning them a berth in the 2004
ITA Indoor Championships, which are to be
held Nov. 4-7 in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Corkery / Warburg went up against Cali
fornia's Patrick Briaud and Connor Niland
in the finals, with the crowd backing the
Berkeley favorites. The Stanford tandem,
however, gave the crowd a reason to go
home disappointed when Corkery / War
burg took the Cal duo to the cleaners, wiping
them out 8-2 and claiming the championship
victory.
"They played three Cal teams in a row,"

said Stanford head coach John Whitlinger.
"They got off to such good starts that they
[silenced] whatever crowd there was. There
were some [Cal] people there, and they were
ready to cheer mightily for the Bears. But
our guys got started so quickly, and that al
ways tends to quiet the home crowd."
Competition began on Saturday's second
round for the doubles pair as they nabbed an
8-5 victory over Oregon's Chris Liao and
Eric Pickard. Third-round play was a piece
of cake for Corkery / Warburg, who served
their way to an 8-1 win over Axel Elvik and
Timo Kienle of San Francisco.
In the quarterfinals, Corkery / Warburg
faced their first Cal opponents of the tourna
ment, Lennart Maack and Dean Wallace.
The Cal pair was a little bit more of a chal
lenge than the Stanford's previous oppo
nents, but they were dispatched 8-5, a win
that sent Corkery / Warburg on their way to
the semifinals.

team, but the Bears just couldn't get a break.

Daniel Sebescen an 8-4 defeat, giving the Cardi
nal a spot in the finals, where they defeated Bri
aud/Niland.
"|( 'orkery and Warburg| just played very well
together," Whitlinger said. "They had good ener
gy. they talked well, and they communicated well.
When they do that, we saw what they did last year,
winning a NCAA championship. They're a very
good doubles team, and when they're right,
they're a tough team to beat."

pated in the tournament, with one of the teams
making it to the quarterfinals.

picked up an 8-3 win over Roman Borvanov and
Matt Loucks of Portland in the round of 16 before
being handed an 8-3 defeat in the quarterfinals by
Thomas Bieri and Marcus Shiller of Oregon.
"I really like what Wong and McKean did, get
ting into the quarterfinals," Whitlinger said.

"They beat two very good teams to [get to the J
quarterfinals. I was really impressed with them in
doubles. It was a great effort."
After receiving a bye in the first round, senior
Phil Sheng and sophomore James Wan beat Chad
Wilson and Vladimir of Oregon, 8-5. The Stan
ford tandem then fell 8-5 to Pablo Pires de Amei

forward to his continued progress. He's going to
get better and better."

Oregon's Shiller but was narrowly defeated in the
second round by Chris Palmanshofer of Washing

keep his head up very high after that match,"
Whitlinger said.
Wong was handed a first-round loss by Cal
Poly's Matt Baca, while Martinez was downed 6-
0,6-0 by Cal's Sebescen.
No. 2 Warburg did not play in the regional
