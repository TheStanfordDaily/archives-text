## I watched the Series on Fox— now watch me poke my eyes out

The Yankee pitchers have had great suc
cess against Cabrera when they can get
him out." — Tim McCarver. Game 6,
ALCS
Watching baseball on Fox is akin to hook-

ing up with Kelly from
Saved by the Bell while
wearing a thirteenth-centu
ry suit of armor. The origi
nal concept is so pure and
perfect that you thought it
couldn't be spoiled. And
then something interferes,
so heinous, so inexplicably
unnecessary, it makes you
want to scoop out your eye
balls with a trowel.

The most obvious proof that the Fox broad
cast team is a train wreck is the presence of
Tim McCarver, who conceivably got his job as
color guy in the broadcast booth by bribing
Rupert Murdoch with sexual favors. The worst
part about this situation (aside from the image
that I provided in the previous sentence) is that
McCarver isn't even the worst announcer on
the Fox sports team, narrowly being edged out
by John "Donovan McNabb is doing things
that Donovan McNabb does!" Madden.
Since lead broadcaster Joe Buck is in the
booth mostly because of his father Jack's leg
endary career as an announcer for the Cardi
nals, McCarver's job is to provide the sort of
baseball wisdom that can only come from a
man who caught for years in the big leagues.
"1 remember one time going out to the
mound to talk with Bob Gibson. He told me to
get back behind the batter — that the only
thing I knew about pitching was that it was
hard to hit."
I can only imagine the advice McCarver
would have had for Gibson. I'm guessing it
would have been eerily similar to his anec
dotes about Marquis Grissom's family history
or Matt Morris's favorite flavor of ice cream.
If any of the stories about Bob Gibson are true,
it is much more likely that Gibson's words
were a bit more colorful, and that he beat Mc-
Carver senseless after the game in the locker
room with a sack of doorknobs.
