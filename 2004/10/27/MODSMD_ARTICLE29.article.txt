## I watched the Series on Fox— now watch me poke my eyes out 
### 
The Yankee pitchers have had great suc
cess against Cabrera when they can get
him out." — Tim McCarver. Game 6,
ALCS
Watching baseball on Fox is akin to hook-

ing up with Kelly from
Saved by the Bell while
wearing a thirteenth-centu
ry suit of armor. The origi
nal concept is so pure and
perfect that you thought it
couldn't be spoiled. And
then something interferes,
so heinous, so inexplicably
unnecessary, it makes you
want to scoop out your eye
balls with a trowel.

The most obvious proof that the Fox broad
cast team is a train wreck is the presence of
Tim McCarver, who conceivably got his job as
color guy in the broadcast booth by bribing
Rupert Murdoch with sexual favors. The worst
part about this situation (aside from the image
that I provided in the previous sentence) is that
McCarver isn't even the worst announcer on
the Fox sports team, narrowly being edged out
by John "Donovan McNabb is doing things
that Donovan McNabb does!" Madden.
Since lead broadcaster Joe Buck is in the
booth mostly because of his father Jack's leg
endary career as an announcer for the Cardi
nals, McCarver's job is to provide the sort of
baseball wisdom that can only come from a
man who caught for years in the big leagues.
"1 remember one time going out to the
mound to talk with Bob Gibson. He told me to
get back behind the batter — that the only
thing I knew about pitching was that it was
hard to hit."
I can only imagine the advice McCarver
would have had for Gibson. I'm guessing it
would have been eerily similar to his anec
dotes about Marquis Grissom's family history
or Matt Morris's favorite flavor of ice cream.
If any of the stories about Bob Gibson are true,
it is much more likely that Gibson's words
were a bit more colorful, and that he beat Mc-
Carver senseless after the game in the locker
room with a sack of doorknobs.

But I haven't yet mentioned the
bane of my existence: Scooter, the
talking baseball who occasionally
pops up to explain that "a changeup
is another name fora |cue comical
low voice] 'slowball.'"
Let me be perfectly clear here. If
I ever run into Scooter's creator on
the street, I will beat him with the fe
rocity of Darryl Strawberry attack
ing a fresh line of blow. Even if this
results in my final moments being
spent strapped to a gurney with sodi
um pentathol coursing through my
veins, I'll still consider it worth it just
to hear him apologize for giving
birth to that... thing.
Scooter is another one of Fox's
attempts to bring the game back to
young people, who have come to the
conclusion in recent years that pur
chasing drugs and having unprotect
ed sex are, shockingly enough, more
entertaining than watching the na
tional pastime on television.
Baseball is extraordinarily un
popular among younger viewers,
even relative to other sports. Of
course, someone decided that Scoot
er would rectify this problem.

I really cannot understand this re
sponse. Having an animated ball ex
plain basic information about the
game is already irritating to the vast
majority of the viewing audience,
and if Fox execs think Scooter is
going to attract kids to the game,
they are sorely mistaken.
Even watching the game on
"mute" has its flaws. The best broad
casts provide you with shots and
commentary that enhance the game,
while you fail to even notice the
mediocre ones.
But until this week, I hadn't ever
actively been disappointed in a tele
vision broadcast of a sporting event
in the moment. It took Fox a full
minute to show replays of the two
critical plays that were reversed in
Game 6 of the ALCS.
Furthermore, the network
doesn't seem to understand that
when running a replay of a close
play at first, the most effective cam
era angle isn't following the ball —
it's fixed on the first-base bag, com
paring the arrival times of the ball
and the runner. This is a shot that
Fox consistently forgets to provide

Here's hoping I never
meet Scooter's inventor

the viewer, despite the fact that it is
the most obvious solution imagin
able.
But for the small fraction of us
who were hypnotized by the game in
our formative years, we are hope
lessly at the mercy of the networks.
Fox could artificially enhance game
sounds, do an inning-by-inning up
date on the Red Sox' haircuts, or su
perimpose Terry Bradshaw's face on
the ball, and 1 would still watch.
At this point, I'm like a heroin ad
dict.Travel days and rain delays
make me bored and grouchy, and I
schedule activities around afternoon
games. But I can't take any more of
this.
Rupert. I've had enough of your
dancing apes. Please, someone get
me some of the good stuff — before
the season runs out.
