# Senate hears ITSS proposal
## 
### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate meeting last night, represen
tatives from Residential Computing
and Information Technology Sys
tems and Services presented a pro
posal that would drastically change
the existing telecommunications fee
system.
Also discussed at the meeting was
sophomore Senator Omar Shakir's
proposal to provide support for stu
dent groups that are criticized by
other student groups or off-campus
organizations.
Currently, all students who want
access to the Internet in their room
pay $12 per month for the network
connection. In addition, those stu
dents who have a land-line phone
pay a one-time activation fee of $33
and a monthly service charge of
$13.95.
In total, students who have a net
work connection and a land-line
phone in their rooms pay $77.85 per
quarter plus a one-time $33 activa
tion fee. Students who only have a
network connection pay $36 per
quarter.
Rich Holeton, head of ResComp,
and Jay Kohn, director of Shared
Services for ITSS, told the Senate
that the new proposal would be ad
vantageous for all students, primari
ly because it would eliminate activa
tion fees and all students would have
a land-line in their rooms.
Kohn and Holeton said that
about 70 percent of all Stanford stu
dents currently have a land-line
phone. They said that almost all
graduate students choose to activate
their phones, while about 50 percent

of undergraduates have an in-room
phone. They added that they would
soon present the proposal to the
University's Board of Trustees.
The new system would bundle to
gether the Internet and phone
charges, which are currently sepa
rate. The proposal would also re
quire all students — regardless of
whether they have a network or
phone connection — to pay the
combined telecommunications fee.
Under the proposal, the in-room
network connection cost would in
crease from $12 to $14 per month,
but the one-time $33 activation fee
for land-line phones would be elimi
nated, and the existing $13.95
monthly service charge for land-line
phones would be reduced to $1.67
per month. In total, all students

would pay $47.00 per quarter.
The new program would "in
crease [thej in-room connection fee
to cover unfunded facility costs and
rising ResComp program costs," ac
cording to the proposal. Holeton
added that universal activation
would decrease the phone charges.
Under the new plan, every room
except quads would have one phone
line; quads would get two lines.
Holeton went on to say that
under the new proposal, telecommu
nications fees would be tacked on to
the student's quarterly University
hill and therefore be covered by fi
nancial aid. if needed. Presently,
telecommunications fees are on a
separate invoice.


ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily
At last night's ASSU Undergraduate Senate meeting, ResComp and ITSS
presenteaa proposal to combine fees for network connection and land-line
phone use into one monthly bill.
He added that it would "reduce
overhead of policing and hilling net
work connections and phone activa
tions."
When asked by a senator how the
new proposal would affect students
who do not want a land-line phone.
Kohn responded by saying that the
increase in costs for those students
who use only an in-room network
connection would be minimal and
that the benefits would outweigh the
losses.
Under the proposal, students
who only have to pay fora network
connection now would pay an addi
tional $3.67 per quarter.
Those students would also get ac
cess to a phone line in their room for

to support groups

a very small cost, Kohn said.
For the second consecutive week,
there was debate in the Senate over
a bill that would commit the Senate
"to strongly and quickly [support]
student groups in the event of mean
spirited attacks and unfair character
izations, especially those initiated by
off-campus organizations."
A new clause introduced last
night stated that the Senate would
facilitate discussion between student
groups that are in conflict.
The Senate was once again divid
ed on the issue and voted to table the
bill. The bill's writer, Shakir, agreed
to eliminate any ambiguity and pre
pare the bill for further review next
week.
