# ASSU works on communication
## 
### NILA BALA 
"lf I weren't a senator, I wouldn't
know what the ASSU did." said
sophomore Katie Salisbury, who
chairs the new ad hoc ASSU Com
munications Committee.
Troubled by the lack of a commu
nication channel between the stu
dent body and student government
at Stanford, the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate has created the new com
mittee to focus on facilitating dia
logue and soliciting students' con
cerns.
"Students don't know what they
can take advantage of and the ser
vices that are available through the
ASSU," Salisbury said.
The idea for the Communications
Committee materialized out of the
senators' annual retreat, where they
decided that the ASSU's main prob
lem last year was communicating
with students. The first priority dis
cussed at the committee's latest
meeting 011 Sunday was 10 make stu
dents aware of its existence.
Chris Nguyen, a sophomore sena
tor and committee member, pointed
out that students do not generally
even know what they are paying for
each year.
"An example is the 'ASSU special
fees' that students are billed for,"he
said. "The money doesn't actually go
to the ASSU but is distributed to
other groups. The ASSU gets its op
erating budget from its own endow
ment."
To close such gaps in knowledge
and to bring students and the ASSU
together, the committee has decided
to hold the weekly Undergraduate
Senate meetings in different dorms
starting Nov. 9. when the meeting
will take place in Toyon Hall.
Committee members said that
they hope rotating the location of the
Senate meetings will help the organi

zation better advocate for students.
"If students won't come to the
Senate meetings, we'll bring the Sen
ate meetings to them." she said. "At
least people in the dorm we are at
will see us."
Salisbury said she hopes to take
the concept further in the future.
"We also have plans to go out to
house meetings to talk about the
ASSU, explain the special fees and
have question-and-answer sessions."
Beyond addressing the communi
cations problem on the dorm level,
the committee has held events like
"donut office hours." an open forum
yesterday in White Plaza where stu
dents received donuts in exchange
for asking half a dozen senators ques
tions about the ASSU.
The committee members were
generally pleased with the turnout of
students, who were attracted to the
table by the free donuts. Most of the
questions regarded meal plans,
money given to student groups and
the basics of the ASSU. Some stu
dents seemed more interested in sim
ply getting their hands on a donut
and asked questions such as what
"ASSU" stands for and how many
senators there are.
Sophomore Russell Husen. a sen
ator who attended the event in White
Plaza, said that the main push for the
event was informing students on spe
cial fees.
"Students vote to fund groups in
the spring and later request refunds,
seeing the money as free," he said.
"The refund policy was put in place
because students have the right to
withdraw personal funds if ideologi
cally opposed to a group, not to get
free money."
Other future plans for the com
mittee include updating the Web site
with senators' pictures, a bi-quarter

ly newsletter on each ASSU commit
tee and their progress and a blog for
senators to express their viewpoints.
"The Daily is the only place stu
dents currently get information on
the ASSU," said senior Chris Lin,
chair of the undergraduate senate,
"This blog would allow uncut en
tries on issues that the Senate
wants to focus on. which may be
different from what The Daily fo
cuses on."
The group of students, composed
of four senators and multiple senate
associates, plans to remain ad hoc for
the rest of this year.
Salisbury was optimistic, howev
er, and said that "if it works out well,
we may join the four standing com
mittees and become permanent."
