# With cars, Stanford never learned to share
## 
### JENNY ALLEN 
The car-sharing experiment at
Stanford is over, leaving some be
mused students to wonder. "Dude,
where's our car?"
On Sept. 9, a little under one year
after introducing two new hybrid
Honda Civics to the Tresidder Union
and Serra Street parking lots. City
Car Share discontinued its services to
the Stanford community.
Users of the program, offered in
many places throughout the bay area,
pay a fee to gain the right to access a
shared automobile.
According to Eliot Dobris, City
Car Share's director of marketing and
communication, the non-profit orga
nization was pleased to bring its pro
gram to Stanford but did not have
enough membership growth to con
tinue, especially when weighed with

the substantial costs involved with
serving a campus location so far re
moved from the company's San Fran
cisco headquarters.
"We had a great mix of students,
faculty and staff using City Car Share,"
he said. "We even dedicated more re
sources to Stanford than to any other
campus. It remains to be seen whether
car-sharing works in a suburban set
ting," he said.
City Car Share is now focusing on
outreach in San Francisco. Oakland
and Berkeley, working closely with
colleges in that area in an effort to
reach young people before they pur
chase a car.
The company offers a special cam
pus program at UC-Berkeley. Stu
dents. staff and faculty are able to
waive a $3(X) deposit and instead pay
only a one-time $30 application charge.
The service itself costs $ 10 a month

plus $2 to $4 for each hour a car is re
served and $0.44 per mile driven. Gas
and vehicle insurance are provided at
no additional charge. Autos are avail
able all-day, year-round.
Dobris said that the UC Berkeley
campus, unlike Stanford's, is more in
tegrated into the community, offering
better transportation and attracting a
greater mix of university and non-uni
versity individuals to car sharing.
Stanford students in general ap
pear to support the idea of car sharing
but also cited reasons for not using a
service such as City Car Share.
"Car sharing could be a convenient
alternative to the local bus system."
said David Strandness. a first-year law
student. "However. I probably would
not use this service very often.
"For quick errands, I've always
been able to get a ride with a friend.
And if I needed a car for an extended

period of time, it would make more
sense for me to just use a traditional car
rental service."
"I'm a freshman right now, and I'd
like to stay on campus and get the feel
of campus more," said Danielle
Wong. "I'd definitely appreciate hav
ing a car without the maintenance and
parking responsibilities, but 1
wouldn't use a service like City Car-
Share enough to make it worth a $10
monthly fee."
According to the City Car Share
Web site, the movement began in
1488 with a German organization
named Stattauto. meaning "instead
of cars." In the United States, car
sharing is popular in Portland. Boston
and Seattle.
The Web site also says that City
Car Share. which has been in existence
since March 2(X)1. is dedicated to re-
ducing automobile dependence.
Lawrence Dahms, who served as the
Bay Area's Metropolitan Trans
portation Commission executive di
rector for 23 years, is serving a one
year term as the chair of City Car-
Share's Board of Directors.
Dobris said that City Car Share
currently has 3,500 members in
Berkeley, Oakland and San Francis
co who share about 70 vehicles. He
said there are many environmental
benefits to car sharing.
"A study conducted by UC-
Berkeley showed that when City Car-
Share was half of its current size, it
saved 720 gallons of gasoline, 20,000
pounds of CO2. and 13,000 miles dri
ven per day,"he said.
