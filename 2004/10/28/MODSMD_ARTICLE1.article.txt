### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Republican Steve Poizner. candi
date for the State Assembly in the
21st district, characterized himself as
a fiscal conservative and social mod
erate in an interview with The Daily
this week.
"1 believe that the government
should have a balanced budget,"he
said. "I don't believe in buying on
debt."
He also stressed the importance
of making the Bay Area attractive to
businesses.
"Silicon Valley has gone through
a meltdown," he said. "We are chas
ing jobs out of this area at a rapid
clip; we must encourage businesses
to hire here."
Poizner said he would "push hard
for workers' compensation reform"
and "drive down the cost of electric
ity" to improve business conditions
in the state.
Poizner, a political newcomer
who has spent over $4.5 million out
of-pocket in this race against Demo
crat Ira Ruskin. cited his business ex
perience as a major qualification for
his candidacy.
"Career politicians have done
huge damage to this state,"he said.
"I've got 25 years of experience at
leading people in both the public

and private sector. I'm in a position
where I can help improve the sys
tem."
Poizner, 46, graduated from the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness in and went on to earn mil
lions as the founder of two technolo
gy firms in Silicon Valley. He is the
co-founder of four non-profits, most
notably Ed Voice, a lobbying group
for improving the quality of state
schools.
Poizner, who worked as a volun
teer teacher at a San Jose high
school last year, said that education
reform is an important issue to him.
He is opposed to vouchers but urges
giving districts more local control.
"All my work has to do with im
proving the public school system.
I'm talking about pushing control
out of the legislature so that public
schools can control their own bud
get."he said.
Asked about his stance on affir
mative action, Poizner said he did
not support "quotas or preference to
various ethnic groups." However, he
said, "1 am a big believer that higher
education should look at more than
scores — they should take a more
holistic approach and consider stu
dents' life challenges, not just CPA
and SAT scores," he said.

MICHELLE CHANG/The Stanford Daily
Republican Steve Poizner is challenging Ira Ruskin in the heavily Democrat
ic 21 st district for the California State Assembly. Polls show the two even.
Poizner has been called an
"Arnold Republican," a label that
implies moderate social policies
compared to the traditional party
platform.
"What it means to me is 1 believe
the government should stay out of
people's private lives in the long
term." Poizner said.
Like Gov. Arnold Schwarzeneg
ger and Ruskin. Poizner supports
Proposition 71, California's stem
cell initiative.
"I am convinced that the use of
stem cells has the potential to be the
solution to a host of medical prob
lems," he said. "1 fully support this
proposition so California can lead
the way."
Poizner. like his Democratic op
ponent. is firmly pro-choice. "1 am a
strong supporter of a woman's right
to choose. My views on social issues
are progressive," he added.
But unlike Ruskin, who supports
lull and equal marriage rights for gay
Californians, Poizner believes in
civil unions, which he defined as
"contracts for gay and straight cou
ples" that "give them exactly the
same rights and privileges."
"Marriage should be left to reli
gious institutions," Poizner added.
Poizner discussed his beliefs on
reforming the criminal justice sys-

tem, elaborating on his position
against Proposition 66, the three
strikes reform initiative, which is
supported by a majority of Californi
ans.
"1 am opposed to it not because 1
don't think the three-strikes law
should be fine-tuned, but because
the legislature should do the fine
tuning. This is not a measure that
should be dealt with by an initia
tive," Poizner said.
"[Prop. 66| is extremely poorly
worded," he added. "It has wording
problems and implementation prob
lems."
Poizner expressed support for re
forming drug sentences for minor of
fenses.
"I do not want to put marijuana
users in prison, but through rehabil
itation programs." he said.
He said reforming drug laws was
a fiscal issue as well.
"There are too many nonviolent
criminals in jails — it costs us
$31.000 a year to house a murderer,
and it's the same cost to house a drug
user," he said. "The prison budget is
out of control. 1 don't think either
party in Sacramento does a very
good job of representing people like
me."
