### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Republican Steve Poizner. candi
date for the State Assembly in the
21st district, characterized himself as
a fiscal conservative and social mod
erate in an interview with The Daily
this week.
"1 believe that the government
should have a balanced budget,"he
said. "I don't believe in buying on
debt."
He also stressed the importance
of making the Bay Area attractive to
businesses.
"Silicon Valley has gone through
a meltdown," he said. "We are chas
ing jobs out of this area at a rapid
clip; we must encourage businesses
to hire here."
Poizner said he would "push hard
for workers' compensation reform"
and "drive down the cost of electric
ity" to improve business conditions
in the state.
Poizner, a political newcomer
who has spent over $4.5 million out
of-pocket in this race against Demo
crat Ira Ruskin. cited his business ex
perience as a major qualification for
his candidacy.
"Career politicians have done
huge damage to this state,"he said.
"I've got 25 years of experience at
leading people in both the public

and private sector. I'm in a position
where I can help improve the sys
tem."
Poizner, 46, graduated from the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness in and went on to earn mil
lions as the founder of two technolo
gy firms in Silicon Valley. He is the
co-founder of four non-profits, most
notably Ed Voice, a lobbying group
for improving the quality of state
schools.
Poizner, who worked as a volun
teer teacher at a San Jose high
school last year, said that education
reform is an important issue to him.
He is opposed to vouchers but urges
giving districts more local control.
"All my work has to do with im
proving the public school system.
I'm talking about pushing control
out of the legislature so that public
schools can control their own bud
get."he said.
Asked about his stance on affir
mative action, Poizner said he did
not support "quotas or preference to
various ethnic groups." However, he
said, "1 am a big believer that higher
education should look at more than
scores â€” they should take a more
holistic approach and consider stu
dents' life challenges, not just CPA
and SAT scores," he said.
