## Your vote can change women's health worldwide 
### LAUREN GONG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
This next Tuesday, you'll be mak
ing a choice that could not only affect
the health of the women in this coun
try, but also the well-being of women
across the world.
Yesterday, I came across one of
those informative fliers put out by
Stanford Students for Choice.
"On Nov. 2, make the right 'choice'
so that women around the world can
make theirs..said the flier.
It refers to President George W.
Bush's restoration of the Mexico
City Policy, also popularly named
the Global Gag Rule.
Under the policy, the United
States government can provide no
financial assistance to any foreign
non-governmental organizations
that use funding to either perform
abortions — except in the case of
rape or incest — or offer any abor
tion-related services, including
counseling or referral for abortion
and pro-abortion lobbying. Any vi
olation of these two mandates re
sults in loss of funding from the
U.S. Agency for International De
velopment, USAID, the leading
sponsor of international family
planning NGOs.
This has resulted in the denial of
funds to thousands of family plan
ning and HIV / AIDS outreach
programs in some of the poorest
parts of the world. Under the Glob
al Gag Rule, NGOs are faced with
a decision: They can either accept
the rules and cut back on their ser
vices, only providing the limited
range of reproductive health op
tions mandated by the U.S. govern
ment, or they can reject funding
and try to turn to other resources.
For the NGOs that continue to
provide abortion-related services,
they not only suffer financially, they
also are ineligible for the free

contraceptives usually donated
by USAID. As a result, these
NGOs have to either cut back on
other services or raise fees. Glob
ally, family planning NGOs have
been shut down due to lack of fi
nancial support.
According to the Population Ref
erence Bureau, complications from
pregnancy and childbirth are the
leading causes of death worldwide
for women of reproductive age, in
cluding the injuries associated with
unsafe abortion. Unsafe abortions
are defined as those self-induced or
performed by an unskilled health
care provider.
The World Health Organiza
tion estimates that about 19.5 mil
lion unsafe abortions are per
formed each year. 18.5 million of
those in developing countries.
This practice can result in life
long debilitations, including re
productive tract infections, pelvic
inflammatory disease, chronic
pain, infertility and even death. In
contrast, abortion in a clinical set
ting has a very low incidence of
these health risks.
The Bush administration's aim,
under the guise of the Global Gag
Rule, is to lower the number of
worldwide abortions performed by
limiting a woman's access to safe
abortion-related services. Howev
er, since its original instatement in
the 1980s, there has been no evi
dence it lowered the incidence of
abortions. While it led to a decrease
in the number of officially per
formed abortions, it raised the
number of women who sought
clandestine and unsafe procedures.
While the focus of the campaign
has been the effect either Bush or
John Kerry could have on abortion
practices in America, each candi
date could have an even greater im
pact on women worldwide. Bush's
support of the Global Gag Rule is

analogous to past debates on
whether college campuses should
distribute condoms. We have long
since realized that whether con
doms are there or not, young peo
ple are going to have sex.
Women are dying unnecessarily
because of this mandate. Women
are going to have unwanted preg
nancies and seek abortions
whether they are legal or not. The
Global Gag rule takes away a
woman's right to the option of a
safe procedure.
On the other side, Kerry op
poses the Global Gag Rule. Dur
ing the second presidential debate
on Oct. 8, Kerry stated: "I think
it's important for the United
States, for instance, not to have
this rigid ideological restriction on
helping families around the world
to be able to make a smart deci
sion about family planning."
By cutting out these family
planning agencies that refuse to
limit their services in line with
guidelines set by the Global Gag
rule, the Bush administration is
denying millions of people access
to HIV / AIDS education, free
contraceptives and family planning
services that could prevent un
wanted pregnancies.
Bush's policies are just plain
naive. They are so focused on ide
ology that they ignore the practical
implications. The WHO estimates
about 68,000 women die each year
as a result of unsafe abortions.
Support the life of these women
and make the informed choice this
Tuesday.

performed by an unskilled health
care provider.
The World Health Organiza
tion estimates that about 19.5 mil
lion unsafe abortions are per
formed each year. 18.5 million of
those in developing countries.
This practice can result in life
long debilitations, including re
productive tract infections, pelvic
inflammatory disease, chronic
pain, infertility and even death. In
contrast, abortion in a clinical set
ting has a very low incidence of
these health risks.
The Bush administration's aim,
under the guise of the Global Gag
Rule, is to lower the number of
worldwide abortions performed by
limiting a woman's access to safe
abortion-related services. Howev
er, since its original instatement in
the 1980s, there has been no evi
dence it lowered the incidence of
abortions. While it led to a decrease
in the number of officially per
formed abortions, it raised the
number of women who sought
clandestine and unsafe procedures.
While the focus of the campaign
has been the effect either Bush or
John Kerry could have on abortion
practices in America, each candi
date could have an even greater im
pact on women worldwide. Bush's
support of the Global Gag Rule is

analogous to past debates on
whether college campuses should
distribute condoms. We have long
since realized that whether con
doms are there or not, young peo
ple are going to have sex.
Women are dying unnecessarily
because of this mandate. Women
are going to have unwanted preg
nancies and seek abortions
whether they are legal or not. The
Global Gag rule takes away a
woman's right to the option of a
safe procedure.
On the other side, Kerry op
poses the Global Gag Rule. Dur
ing the second presidential debate
on Oct. 8, Kerry stated: "I think
it's important for the United
States, for instance, not to have
this rigid ideological restriction on
helping families around the world
to be able to make a smart deci
sion about family planning."
By cutting out these family
planning agencies that refuse to
limit their services in line with
guidelines set by the Global Gag
rule, the Bush administration is
denying millions of people access
to HIV / AIDS education, free
contraceptives and family planning
services that could prevent un
wanted pregnancies.
Bush's policies are just plain
naive. They are so focused on ide
ology that they ignore the practical
implications. The WHO estimates
about 68,000 women die each year
as a result of unsafe abortions.
Support the life of these women
and make the informed choice this
Tuesday.

This next Tuesday, you'll be mak
ing a choice that could not only affect
the health of the women in this coun
try, but also the well-being of women
across the world.
Yesterday, I came across one of
those informative fliers put out by
Stanford Students for Choice.
"On Nov. 2, make the right 'choice'
so that women around the world can
make theirs..said the flier.
It refers to President George W.
Bush's restoration of the Mexico
City Policy, also popularly named
the Global Gag Rule.
Under the policy, the United
States government can provide no
financial assistance to any foreign
non-governmental organizations
that use funding to either perform
abortions — except in the case of
rape or incest — or offer any abor
tion-related services, including
counseling or referral for abortion
and pro-abortion lobbying. Any vi
olation of these two mandates re
sults in loss of funding from the
U.S. Agency for International De
velopment, USAID, the leading
sponsor of international family
planning NGOs.
This has resulted in the denial of
funds to thousands of family plan
ning and HIV / AIDS outreach
programs in some of the poorest
parts of the world. Under the Glob
al Gag Rule, NGOs are faced with
a decision: They can either accept
the rules and cut back on their ser
vices, only providing the limited
range of reproductive health op
tions mandated by the U.S. govern
ment, or they can reject funding
and try to turn to other resources.
For the NGOs that continue to
provide abortion-related services,
they not only suffer financially, they
also are ineligible for the free

contraceptives usually donated
by USAID. As a result, these
NGOs have to either cut back on
other services or raise fees. Glob
ally, family planning NGOs have
been shut down due to lack of fi
nancial support.
According to the Population Ref
erence Bureau, complications from
pregnancy and childbirth are the
leading causes of death worldwide
for women of reproductive age, in
cluding the injuries associated with
unsafe abortion. Unsafe abortions

performed by an unskilled health
care provider.
