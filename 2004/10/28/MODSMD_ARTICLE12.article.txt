# In a computer-dependent life, carpal tunnel becomes a concern for students
## 
### KENDALL MADDEN 
Walking into Meyer Library, a
familiar sight meets the eye: Scores
of students, all hunched up over
computers or laptops, madly typ
ing away at a paper or searching
the Internet, e-mailing or instant
messaging. And it is not just the li
brary. Coffee shops, trains, air
planes, even the occasional open
park space — the sight of a person
crouched over a computer has be
come nearly übiquitous.
In a society where good posture
is a diminishing concept (some
thing you might expect to hear
from your great-aunt or 60-year
old gym teacher from high school)
the hunched back, drooped neck
and limp wrists are a normal sight
and readily assumed position.
But does all this computer time
actually pose a potential health risk?
Many health professionals say yes.
According to physical thera
pists, doctors and ergonomists
alike, the poor posture assumed by
most people when working at a
computer and the long hours of
typing can cause serious physical
damage.
In the United States, more than
a third of all work-related injuries
and illnesses are caused by repeti
tive strain injuries. These injuries
encompass a general class of soft
tissue injuries such as carpal tun
nel syndrome, tendonitis, bursitis
and trigger finger, as well as sever
al other syndromes. Repetitive
use injuries are caused by inten
sive repetition of certain aggra
vating movements such as are
common in production-line jobs
or computer work. Sitting in a
chair that is too high or too low
can also worsen posture, increas
ing the risk of tendonitis.
At Stanford, senior Christopher
Baer initiated a campus student
group called Student Ergonomics to
educate students about the risk of
repetitive use injuries and what they

can do to protect themselves. Er
gonomics is a new brand of physi
cal therapy which attempts to pre
vent injury by modifying the work
ing environment.
The theory is that there are cer
tain "good" postures and other
"bad" postures which cause stress
and damage to tissues. Ergonomics
consists of both programs for
greater awareness of good posture
and the promotion of the use of spe
cial, ergonomically-designed equip
ment to minimize bad posture.
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a
disorder caused by inflammation
of the tendons and ligaments in
the wrist, which pinches the
nerves, causing pain and numb
ness. Many individuals who suffer
from carpal tunnel syndrome have
the genetic predisposition of a
smaller carpal tunnel, which en
hances the chance of nerves get
ting pinched.
The tissues most susceptible to
damage are the muscle, tendons,
ligaments and nervous tissue.
Typical symptoms of repetitive
use injuries include pain, tingling,
numbness, swelling, and the loss
of flexibility and strength. Dam
age is often permanent and fre
quently disabling.
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a
growing concern for many employ
ers whose employees' jobs consist
of long hours of repetitive move
ment or computer work. Not only
are these employees at high risk for
developing a repetitive use injury
but if they do, they are no longer
able to perform their job.
Prolonged periods of work with
out adequate breaks, a cold working
environment or high stress levels can
all enhance the chance of developing
a repetitive strain injury.
There are personal factors as
well. Many individuals who devel
op repetitive strain injuries have a
predisposition for muscle damage
and risk increases with age.
Robbie Yan, a Stanford senior

and computer science major, said
he knows many of his fellow class
mates who suffer from repetitive use
injuries.
"Many people find it difficult to
use the mouse," said Yan. "So
there is now a new type of mouse
with a rolling ball that eliminates
the need for wrist movement."
The success of this new mouse to
reduce aggravation of repetitive use
injuries has been very high, Yan said.
Other ergonomically designed
technologies are becoming more
common-place, such as the split key
board. The purpose of the split key
board is to prevent unnatural bend
ing of the wrists and to reduce the
tension in the neck and shoulders
that results from typing on a small
keyboard.
Additionally, computer stands,
such as the Ergo Pad for laptops,
allow the computer to be arranged
at different angles to maximize typ
ing and viewing comfort. But ex
perts agree that the most important
prevention strategy is self-aware
ness, that is, fighting the slouching
urge, even at 3 a.m.
"Ergonomics is something that I
feel is overlooked by students, yet
we're at a fairly high risk for com
ing down with repetitive strain in
juries such as carpal tunnel syn
drome or tendonitis," Baer said.
Baer's group is currently con
ducting a study on the prevalence
of repetitive use injuries among
students on campus. They hope
that their results will help con
vince the administration of the
need for further awareness of stu
dent susceptibility.
"Many of my friends have or
know someone with one of these
conditions," he added. "Our goal is
to try to educate students towards
preventing repetitive strain in
juries, and also to convince the Uni
versity to bring parity to students in
terms of the extensive efforts the
University already places upon
staff / faculty ergonomics."

old gym teacher from high school)
the hunched back, drooped neck
and limp wrists are a normal sight
and readily assumed position.
But does all this computer time
actually pose a potential health risk?
Many health professionals say yes.
According to physical thera
pists, doctors and ergonomists
alike, the poor posture assumed by
most people when working at a
computer and the long hours of
typing can cause serious physical
damage.
In the United States, more than
a third of all work-related injuries
and illnesses are caused by repeti
tive strain injuries. These injuries
encompass a general class of soft
tissue injuries such as carpal tun
nel syndrome, tendonitis, bursitis
and trigger finger, as well as sever
al other syndromes. Repetitive
use injuries are caused by inten
sive repetition of certain aggra
vating movements such as are
common in production-line jobs
or computer work. Sitting in a
chair that is too high or too low
can also worsen posture, increas
ing the risk of tendonitis.
At Stanford, senior Christopher
Baer initiated a campus student
group called Student Ergonomics to
educate students about the risk of
repetitive use injuries and what they

can do to protect themselves. Er
gonomics is a new brand of physi
cal therapy which attempts to pre
vent injury by modifying the work
ing environment.
The theory is that there are cer
tain "good" postures and other
"bad" postures which cause stress
and damage to tissues. Ergonomics
consists of both programs for
greater awareness of good posture
and the promotion of the use of spe
cial, ergonomically-designed equip
ment to minimize bad posture.
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a
disorder caused by inflammation
of the tendons and ligaments in
the wrist, which pinches the
nerves, causing pain and numb
ness. Many individuals who suffer
from carpal tunnel syndrome have
the genetic predisposition of a
smaller carpal tunnel, which en
hances the chance of nerves get
ting pinched.
The tissues most susceptible to
damage are the muscle, tendons,
ligaments and nervous tissue.
Typical symptoms of repetitive
use injuries include pain, tingling,
numbness, swelling, and the loss
of flexibility and strength. Dam
age is often permanent and fre
quently disabling.
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a
growing concern for many employ
ers whose employees' jobs consist
of long hours of repetitive move
ment or computer work. Not only
are these employees at high risk for
developing a repetitive use injury
but if they do, they are no longer
able to perform their job.
Prolonged periods of work with
out adequate breaks, a cold working
environment or high stress levels can
all enhance the chance of developing
a repetitive strain injury.
There are personal factors as
well. Many individuals who devel
op repetitive strain injuries have a
predisposition for muscle damage
and risk increases with age.
Robbie Yan, a Stanford senior

and computer science major, said
he knows many of his fellow class
mates who suffer from repetitive use
injuries.
"Many people find it difficult to
use the mouse," said Yan. "So
there is now a new type of mouse
with a rolling ball that eliminates
the need for wrist movement."
The success of this new mouse to
reduce aggravation of repetitive use
injuries has been very high, Yan said.
Other ergonomically designed
technologies are becoming more
common-place, such as the split key
board. The purpose of the split key
board is to prevent unnatural bend
ing of the wrists and to reduce the
tension in the neck and shoulders
that results from typing on a small
keyboard.
Additionally, computer stands,
such as the Ergo Pad for laptops,
allow the computer to be arranged
at different angles to maximize typ
ing and viewing comfort. But ex
perts agree that the most important
prevention strategy is self-aware
ness, that is, fighting the slouching
urge, even at 3 a.m.
"Ergonomics is something that I
feel is overlooked by students, yet
we're at a fairly high risk for com
ing down with repetitive strain in
juries such as carpal tunnel syn
drome or tendonitis," Baer said.
Baer's group is currently con
ducting a study on the prevalence
of repetitive use injuries among
students on campus. They hope
that their results will help con
vince the administration of the
need for further awareness of stu
dent susceptibility.
"Many of my friends have or
know someone with one of these
conditions," he added. "Our goal is
to try to educate students towards
preventing repetitive strain in
juries, and also to convince the Uni
versity to bring parity to students in
terms of the extensive efforts the
University already places upon
staff / faculty ergonomics."
Walking into Meyer Library, a
familiar sight meets the eye: Scores
of students, all hunched up over
computers or laptops, madly typ
ing away at a paper or searching
the Internet, e-mailing or instant
messaging. And it is not just the li
brary. Coffee shops, trains, air
planes, even the occasional open
park space — the sight of a person
crouched over a computer has be
come nearly übiquitous.
In a society where good posture
is a diminishing concept (some

the hunched back, drooped neck
and limp wrists are a normal sight
and readily assumed position.
