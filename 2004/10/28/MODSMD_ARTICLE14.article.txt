## Editorial Labor issues merit more dialogue 
### 
It has been over a year since University Presi
dent John Hennessy appointed the Presidential
Advisory Committee on Workplace Policies to
examine University policy concerning workers,
yet the dialogue on labor issues remains disappoint
ingly limited.
Last week's town hall forum on labor issues
showed the lack of communication between the ad
ministration. the committee and the workers. The
forum, organized by the committee, was designed to
solicit feedback from the community on the commit
tee's final report of recommendations.
The committee was charged with investigating
temporary employment, educational opportunities
and the newly adopted living-wage guidelines. They
would then report its findings and make policy rec
ommendations to the president.
But from the beginning, its efforts were ham
pered. Basic data on worker salaries and benefits
were scarce, and information about the University's
endowment was inaccessible. As a result, the com
mittee's final report, issued in June, has only been
able to make rough proposals for changes in Univer
sity workplace policies.
We agree with the report's recommendation that
the Procurement Office make efforts to obtain stan
dardized statistics on workers. Additionally, the newly
proposed position of worker advocate, who will ad
dress employees' grievances, will benefit workers.
But the fact remains that both workers and the
committee have been left in the dark as to whether
these proposals will actually be implemented.

Hennessy was aware of the town hall meeting but
was not invited to attend. According to Jeff Wachtel,
special assistant to the president, Hennessy did not
plan on formally responding to the committee's re
port until January. He wanted to gauge the public's
reaction to the report from the meeting and then
proceed from there.
Yet he neglected to inform either the committee
or the workers about this plan of action. Also, Hen
nessy never responded to a request fora meeting
from the student-run Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion in an e-mail that was sent at the beginning of the
school year.
As a result, workers and SLAC were under the
impression that Hennessy would be at the town hall
meeting to discuss future policy implementation.
Anger over Hennessy's absence prompted a protest
in front of his house demanding that he come out, al
though he was not home at the time.
We feel that the embarrassment of having a
group of outraged workers march on Hennessy's
house could have been avoided if the president had
informed all those involved about his plan to re
spond formally in January.
For now, he should clarify to the public why he was
not present at the meeting to let the workers know
that their grievances are being taken seriously.
It is only through open dialogue and trust that this
weighty issue can be resolved, and the president
should take active steps to maintain communication
with those who are concerned with the University's
labor practices.
