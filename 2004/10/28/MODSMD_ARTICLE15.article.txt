## Senior year: One foot out the door 
### JOHN JETT 
Stanford students are sometimes
likened to ducks — calm above the
surface, paddling intensely below.
It's also often said that panic is conta
gious.
Put these two common-sense
adages together and you will have a
good idea of what the job-search
odyssey is like for Stanford seniors.
Seniors are worried, but they will
not admit to it. Throughout organic
chemistry and Econ 53, you have lis
tened to your friend tell you noncha
lantly that he studied "like maybe a
half hour" for that big test, when you
know that in reality he spent the last
two nights in the fluorescent glow of
Meyer, subsisting on a diet of coffee
and Cliff Bars.
And we have all endured the two
or three frantic minutes before most
in-class exams, when study sheets
flutter and nervously strained voices
are the norm. Now, in this wonder
fully dysfunctional tradition, seniors
bluster casually that they are not
worried about getting a job.
Stanford students, despite the
pressure to be laid-back and thereby
live up to the stereotype of being chill
Californian college students, are gen
erally really intense people. I invite
you to speak with a few of your senior
friends this week about their post
graduation plans. If you were a bee
or dog, you would be able to smell
your senior friend's fear in the wake
of the job fair, which was the equiva
lent of a panic H-bomb set off in the
heart of campus.
Now a senior myself, I am also

slowly waking up to the fact that just
one short year from now. I will not be
able to sleep through breakfast dur
ing the workweek.
More to the point, 1 am beginning
to wonder how exactly it is that I will
pay for my Cheerios in the future.
The truth is that, along with roughly
half of all seniors, I have no idea what
I want to do with my life post-Farm.
Happily for medical schools and
investment banks everywhere, not all
seniors suffer from my unfortunate
ciuelessness. Most of you can re
member that guy or girl from fresh
man year who had the life plan clear
ly mapped out from the moment he
or she stepped foot on campus.
In most cases, their story goes
something like this: "So then I got
chicken pox at age six and had to go
to the pediatrician. While there, I had
a road to Damascus experience of
sorts, and I realized that I too was
destined to be a pediatrician."
For the last 15 years, such people
have inexorably trudged along a pre
ordained life path, navigating the
hazards of AP bio, organic chem
istry, the internship in a clinic for the
underprivileged and so forth.
But Stanford's cadre of pre-med
seniors on autopilot is only one ex
ample of a larger phenomenon. Sim
ilar groups of homing pigeons exist
for finance, consulting and, of
course, law.
I envy these students for their
conviction that they have found their
destined path. Strong convictions are
easy to admire.
But I find myself asking whether
these paths are the result of soul

searching and self-awareness, or if
these students are merely caving in
to outside pressure —he it from
family or society at large — to stick
to a safe course. Only the life-plan
ners themselves know the answer to
that question.
The second major group within
Stanford's senior class — the ones
who won't be working for the Man
— contrasts starkly with the life plan
group. This being Stanford, both
groups include talented, driven indi
viduals. Here, 1 think, is the funda
mental difference: While Goldman
Sachs will come to recruit on campus
and will gobble up the life-planner
who has always wanted to be an I
banker, a six-employee biotech start
up might not have a booth at the ca
reer fair but might still be looking for
a bright, energetic Stanford grad to
be employee number seven.
But the start-up will hire in June,
if not September, when the smaller
company has a feel for its hiring
needs and the new hire can jump
right into his or her work.
So while the life planner might
nail down a job in October, I am
guessing that even the most clueless
seniors will find something that
meets their needs, even if it takes a
while and they have to choke down
fear in the meantime.
Keep paddling, senior ducks.
