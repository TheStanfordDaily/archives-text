# Brown and Out
## The 						other side of the coin 
### 
Sometimes I find myself in a
hind. I meet nice people —
even people who aren't
white — who want to know
what I am before they wonder who I
am. It sucks, let me tell you.
There's something that really
bothers me about people who, in the
first conversation we have ever had,
will ask me which "one" of my par
ents is Mexican, "what" my name is.

where my name
comes from,
whether 1 am Ar
gentinian, Ital
ian, a "halfie,"
where I come
from, where my
family comes
from and my per
sonal favorite,
"what" I am.
You know
what I find offen-

sive about it? The fact that 1 can be
standing in a group of people, and
upon meeting person X, I am the
only person who gets asked "follow
up questions" after saying my name.
It's the opposite of being invisi
ble — it's being super-visible. It's
because I can't just be who I am;
rather, who I am requires an expla
nation.
And it's an explanation that can
often be long and awkward, given
that, contrary to popular belief,
some people just don't define them
selves as simply as black / white /
Latino / Asian. Things are more
complicated than that.
It sucks, I told you.
But there's another side to this
thing, too ... I understand that:
What if you just don't know?
Maybe it's an error on my part to
expect that people should know that
asking questions like that can be in
terpreted as rude, unnecessary and
kinda weird.
Am I being too uptight?
People can be really creative, let
me tell you, and they find all kinds
of ways to slip those questions into
my everyday life. But they don't
know that being asked constantly
wears on my patience.
But why do people keep asking?
So I started thinking about it
from their point of view. Maybe
the other side is that by sharing

who and what I am with people,
I can educate them. Maybe the
next time they see a light
skinned Mexican, they will know
this combination is possible, and
won't stumble over the other
person's dignity by asking them
the same set of questions they
asked me.
What I am trying to say, in a real
ly sad way, is that it might be possi
ble that people in my position —
who are not traditionally easy to de
fine racially — may have some sort
of special duty in this society to edu
cate others about themselves. Peo
ple of mixed heritage have often
told me that they deal with this same
issue often, and they are just about
as sick of it as I am.
I find myself in the unenviable
position of either acquiescing to
people constantly questioning what
I am, versus acting like a bitch and
telling people off when it happens.
Both options are extreme and
neither is my favorite; the one 1
choose usually depends on my
mood. Honestly, sometimes I have
absolutely no patience for the intru
sion of others' ignorance into my
life. The saddest thing, I suppose, is
that the best way to solve the prob
lem of people incessantly inquiring
into my race / nationality / heritage
/ family / culture is to just answer
them, with the hopes that one day
they'll know better.
The world is not perfect, and that
means that aside from living my ev
eryday life, I have to be a walking
textbook on race issues, always will
ing to educate others, and actually
care enough about strangers to try
and help them see things differently.
Everyday life is frustrating
enough — having to educate igno
rant strangers isn't really on top of
my to-do list. Unfortunately, I think
it's worth it, not just for the individ
ual, but for the society as well.
It's like I'm a freedom fighter,
only I fight with words, and I fight
for my own freedom.

won't stumble over the other
person's dignity by asking them
the same set of questions they
asked me.
What I am trying to say, in a real
ly sad way, is that it might be possi
ble that people in my position —
who are not traditionally easy to de
fine racially — may have some sort
of special duty in this society to edu
cate others about themselves. Peo
ple of mixed heritage have often
told me that they deal with this same
issue often, and they are just about
as sick of it as I am.
I find myself in the unenviable
position of either acquiescing to
people constantly questioning what
I am, versus acting like a bitch and
telling people off when it happens.
Both options are extreme and
neither is my favorite; the one 1
choose usually depends on my
mood. Honestly, sometimes I have
absolutely no patience for the intru
sion of others' ignorance into my
life. The saddest thing, I suppose, is
that the best way to solve the prob
lem of people incessantly inquiring
into my race / nationality / heritage
/ family / culture is to just answer
them, with the hopes that one day
they'll know better.
The world is not perfect, and that
means that aside from living my ev
eryday life, I have to be a walking
textbook on race issues, always will
ing to educate others, and actually
care enough about strangers to try
and help them see things differently.
Everyday life is frustrating
enough — having to educate igno
rant strangers isn't really on top of
my to-do list. Unfortunately, I think
it's worth it, not just for the individ
ual, but for the society as well.
It's like I'm a freedom fighter,
only I fight with words, and I fight
for my own freedom.
I told you it sucked.
