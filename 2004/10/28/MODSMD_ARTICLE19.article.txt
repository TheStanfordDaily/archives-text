SIC clarifies courses listed
in Time Schedule
As coordinators of the Student Ini
tiated Courses, we felt that we should
clarify a few things in the article about
SIC that appeared in yesterday's edi
tion of The Daily. First, student initi
ated courses have been appearing in
the Time Schedule before this year as
well, accompanied with their own
course numbers and department list
ings. Second, the courses to be offered
winter quarter are still tentative,
awaiting the SIC Advisory Commit
tee's approval. The approved ones
will be included in the Time Schedule
for winter quarter.

Full Moon on the Quad should be
run by students, not University
There cannot be any doubt that
the tradition of Full Moon on The
Quad and the student body would
have been better served by holding
true to tradition â€” at the first full
moon. Besides the horridly cold
weather, the confusion that the
change produced ended up negat
ing the original idea of concealing
the date to prevent outsiders from
crashing the event.
This is ignorant of the fact that
anyone can find out when the moon
is full by checking a calendar, ren
dering the plan of holding the event
on the second weekend fairly moot.
Furthermore, anyone who's been
here more than a year should know
bv now that the end of October is

traditionally COLD . . . another
fact lost on the planning committee.
Combining this with the poor
history of intervention by the Uni
versity (for example: Exotic Erotic
fiascoes the past two years), it is
clear that planning ought to be left
to the students.
The University should merely
take a position of oversight and only
step in if there are deficiencies in
planning. It is time we end the
dearth of social events on campus
collectively, and to do so, we need to
step up with our own superior plan
ning and sensible partying to take
back the students' rightful position
with the University when it comes
to parties.

Consider the numbers in Israel-
Palestine conflict
I am writing in response to
Steve Hefter and Sheree Roth's
letters to the editor printed on Oct.
27th. While Palestinian suicide
bombings should certainly be con
demned, I consider Hefter and
Roth's sweeping characterizations
of Palestinians as "cowardly ter
rorists" (Hefter) and the Israeli
Defence Forces as noble "protec
tors of Israel's people" (Roth) to
be very dangerous.
I invite The Daily's readers to
check some facts. Visit the Middle
East Policy Council's Web site and
view the numbers of Palestinians
and Israelis killed in the conflict.
To date, over 3,000 Palestinians
have been killed, not counting the

deaths of suicidc bombers who
lose their lives at their own hands,
nor counting Palestinians specifi
cally targeted for assassination.
Compare this to slightly less
than 1,000 Israelis killed. Consid
ering that Israel's population is
nearly double Palestine's, these
are very lopsided figures.
Thus, it seems impossibly diffi
cult to argue that the lives of Is
raeli civilians are in any more dan
ger than those of the Palestinians.
The numbers suggest that Pales
tinian civilians are actually some
thing close to six times more likely
to be killed.
Add to this the economic dis
parities between Israel and Pales
tine and the difficulty encountered
by the Palestinian people trying to
travel or access basic resources

(i.e. water), and the picture be
comes even more lopsided.
Disregarding these facts due to
some presupposed moral, ethical,
or religious bias about the virtues
of either side's motivation is in
credibly dangerous.
America's prominent Judeo-
Christian leanings, particularly in
the media, make it easy for us to
unfairly characterize the Palestini
an people.
It is critical for us to reexamine
our assumptions and definitions,
considering equally the possibility
that the Palestinians are the ones
defending themselves against a
terroristic Israel.
