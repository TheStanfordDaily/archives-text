# Depressed and high? There could be a link
## 
### MIKI SOFER 
Cannabis, pot, marijuana,
weed: the aliases abound, but
what can be decisively said about
this well-known drug? Consider
ing that marijuana is the most
commonly used illicit substance
in the United States, much ambi
guity remains surrounding the re
lationship between this drug and
its users.
Although most people associate
marijuana with a happiness- or
calm-inducing high, recent research
has explored its apparent correla
tion with depression.
When the drug hits the brain
Chemicals in marijuana flow
directly to the brain, crossing the
blood-brain barrier and affecting
major memory, coordination and
learning centers. When someone
smokes a joint, THC — the pri
mary active chemical in marijuana
— enters the bloodstream
through the lungs, binds to specif
ic receptors on nerve cells in the

brain and initiates a series of cel
lular reactions that result in the
"high" typically experienced by
marijuana users.
A study involving non-marijua
na users revealed that marijuana
tends to have either a neutral or
negative effect on mood, whereas a
study of people with depression
found that THC may significantly
increase unhappiness.
Although studies have not been
conclusive, mounting evidence
suggests marijuana use and de
pression occur together more
often than chance would predict:
Clinical studies have reported ele
vated depression rates among
those seeking treatment for mari
juana dependence, while others
have found a similar association
between elevated levels of mari
juana use and depression treat
ment.
The question is, what comes
first? Marijuana dependence or
depression?

Teens, drugs and depression
In recent years, rising rates of
marijuana use and depression among
young adults have sparked concern.
According to the National Institute
on Drug abuse, 46.1 percent of 12th
graders surveyed last year admitted
to having tried marijuana at some
point in their lives, a figure that has
declined since the late 19905, yet is
higher than estimates from the earli
er part of the decade.
Studies on teen depression have
indicated that more than 20 percent
of adolescents suffer from emotional
problems — a third of all psychologi
cal diagnoses in teenagers are for de
pression. Even more disturbing is the
adolescent suicide rate, which has in
creased by a margin of 200 percent
since 1993.
Drugs or depression:
Which comes first?
As a result of rising rates of de
pression and marijuana use, recent
studies have attempted to identify a
causal relationship between these
two factors.
At the Washington University
Medical School in St. Louis, Dr.
Michael T. Lynskey and his col
leagues in the Psychiatry Depart
ment are researching the function of
genetic and environmental variables
and the relationship between early
onset marijuana use and Major De
pressive Disorder (MDD).
As part of a larger investigation
based in Australia, the method iden
tified 277 twin pairs in which one
had initiated marijuana use before
age 17 and the other did not. By
studying twins, researchers are bet

ter able to separate whether drug
use and depression are caused by ge
netic or environmental factors, par
ticularly if they look at the differ
ences between identical and frater
nal twins.
Lynskey's study revealed that sui
cidal thoughts and attempts were
over twice as likely to appear in the
marijuana-dependent twin.
The correlation between marijua
na use and depression was higher in
the fraternal pairs than in the identi
cal pairs, demonstrating that envi
ronmental factors — family life, edu
cation, community atmosphere —
may play a larger role in both drug
abuse and psychological disorders
than genetics.
"Because there is a difference be
tween [identical] and [fraternal]
pairs, some of the observed reac
tions may arise due to genetic vul
nerability to marijuana abuse and
environmental influence," Lynskey
explained.
The study suggested that marijua
na use early on in life may not actu
ally place people at risk for depres
sion later on in life, although contin
ued use may prolong or harm treat
ment outcome by exacerbating
symptoms.
"There needs to be recognition
that cannabis is not the root cause of
every difficulty that people experi
ence," Lynskey said. "In terms of
looking at complex issues like de
pression, we need to shy away from
identifying one factor and search in
stead fora life course, a complex per
spective."
At the opposite end of this corre
lational spectrum, medical profes
sionals have theorized that depres
sion is the cause of marijuana use,
rather than the result. That is, people
who are depressed use marijuana to
relieve or "escape from" their symp
toms of depression.
Some studies have demonstrated

that marijuana improves mood and
that people who are depressed dur
ing the initial stages of an experi
ment are more inclined to begin,
continue or increase their marijuana
use by the time of follow-up.

The student perspective
Do students fit this mold? Are
they more likely to use marijuana
when depressed?
When questioned, Stanford stu
dents rarely cited depression as a pri
mary reason for smoking marijuana.
The vast majority indicated that they
smoked because they thought it was
fun.
"It serves as a change of pace from
drinking," said "Sean," who asked
that his real name not be revealed.

"If you think about all the times
that you are high or not high, you re
alize that you have more fun when
you are high," explained "Clark," a
habitual user, who also spoke on con
dition of anonymity.
Moreover, the students ques
tioned said that they would never
smoke by themselves unless it was in
preparation fora social event.
"If you smoke by yourself, that's
when it becomes more of an issue,"
Clark said.
When the topic of depression did
arise, it was in the context of a discus
sion concerning how one's mood
might change after smoking.
"Smoking marijuana magnifies a

lot of the feelings that you're already
feeling," Sean explained. "People
tend to become very introspective,
more self-critical, and from that they
get the signs of depression."
Clark reflected on the influence of
marijuana on behavior.
"If I'm in a bad mood about things,
it reinforces those feelings," Clark
said. "I don't smoke when I am feeling
[unhappy] because that leads to prob
lems. I do know people, however, who
were depressed, tried smoking and
became potheads, immediately."

University health officials are
more concerned about the rate of
depression at Stanford than drug
abuse cases, given that depression is
a larger problem among the student
population.
According to a random sampling
conducted this year, approximately
17 percent of Stanford undergradu
ates had used marijuana in the last 30
days at the time of data collection, a
number that has gone down since
previous samplings, explained Ralph
Castro, manager for the Alcohol and
Other Drug Abuse Prevention Pro
gram at Stanford
Additionally, less than 4 percent
of the undergraduates questioned

were classified as "chronic" users, in
dividuals who smoke marijuana 10 or
more times a month.
"Marijuana is here on campus, but
it is not epidemic," Castro said.
Dr. Alejandro Martinez, director
of Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices, CAPS, at the Vaden Student
Health Center, agreed, adding that
"the number of people who come in
with marijuana use problems is very
small."
The connection between depres
sion and marijuana use rates on cam

pus remains obscure. Martinez re
ported that 17 percent to 22 percent
of the students that CAPS counsels
each year come in for help with de
pression. These percentages are
higher than those observed in the
general population, but cannot be
tied statistically to the number of
people who come in with substance
abuse problems.
"At Stanford, depression is a
more significant concern for us than
marijuana use in terms of students
who are seeking help," Martinez ex
plained.
Then again, he added, it may be
hard to make this distinction since
many students that smoke marijuana
are unlikely to seek help for abuse
problems.
Students see marijuana as a
'safer' alternative to other drugs
University health officials are
concerned about the relatively non
chalant attitude that many students
have assumed toward marijuana.
Martinez said he thought many stu
dents would choose to smoke mari
juana and not drink alcohol because
they saw it as a drug with fewer health
consequences.
"From the students' point of view,
marijuana is not perceived as health
compromising," he said.
Students are well aware of the
dangers of smoking cigarettes, but
they are less likely to be clued into
the dangers of smoking marijuana.
"People at Stanford are smart to
the fact that they know [smoking]
kills you, but marijuana has not been
proven to do so," said "Melissa," who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
Researchers in Lynskey's lab will
continue to study the complex rela
tionship between drugs and psycho
logical disorders, which will allow
doctors and psychiatrists to pinpoint
the causes and develop appropriate
prevention measures.
University officials such as Cas
tro, meanwhile, are concerned that
there has been"a shift in adolescent
culture." Extreme forms of behavior,
he argued, are surfacing in a larger
part of society, and people are plac
ing themselves in more dangerous
situations due to cultural pressures,
which may lead to higher incidences
of both drug abuse and depression in
the end.

Although drug use and depression are both common among young adults, the link between the two is not well understood.
