# Depressed and high? There could be a link

Cannabis, pot, marijuana,
weed: the aliases abound, but
what can be decisively said about
this well-known drug? Consider
ing that marijuana is the most
commonly used illicit substance
in the United States, much ambi
guity remains surrounding the re
lationship between this drug and
its users.
Although most people associate
marijuana with a happiness- or
calm-inducing high, recent research
has explored its apparent correla
tion with depression.
When the drug hits the brain
Chemicals in marijuana flow
directly to the brain, crossing the
blood-brain barrier and affecting
major memory, coordination and
learning centers. When someone
smokes a joint, THC — the pri
mary active chemical in marijuana
— enters the bloodstream
through the lungs, binds to specif
ic receptors on nerve cells in the

brain and initiates a series of cel
lular reactions that result in the
"high" typically experienced by
marijuana users.
A study involving non-marijua
na users revealed that marijuana
tends to have either a neutral or
negative effect on mood, whereas a
study of people with depression
found that THC may significantly
increase unhappiness.
Although studies have not been
conclusive, mounting evidence
suggests marijuana use and de
pression occur together more
often than chance would predict:
Clinical studies have reported ele
vated depression rates among
those seeking treatment for mari
juana dependence, while others
have found a similar association
between elevated levels of mari
juana use and depression treat
ment.
The question is, what comes
first? Marijuana dependence or
depression?
