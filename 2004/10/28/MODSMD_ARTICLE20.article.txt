### CATHERINE CALLISTER DAILY UTAH CHRONICLE (U. UTAH 
(U-WIRH) SALT LAKE CITY — Having
been used in emergency rooms to help rape vic
tims for more than 30 years, emergency contra
ception pills may he a help someday to somebody
in need of them.
Katie Morgan, a nurse practitioner and Uni
versity of Utah assistant nursing professor, talked
Monday at The Women's Resource Center about
the accessibility and necessity of the pills during
unwanted pregnancies.
"Forty-eight percent of [pregnancies] are unin
tended at the time of conception," Morgan said.
If a woman had ready access to emergency con
traception pills, she said, then the number of unin
tended pregnancies and abortions could be cut in
hall
Emergency contraception is used to prevent
pregnancy after unprotected sex, and is most ef

fective if used within 72 hours of contact.
According to Morgan, many people have mis
conceptions about emergency contraception.
These ideas keep Plan B, the most common
emergency contraception, from being readily
available to the women who need it.
Emergency contraception, however, can be
hard to get within the 72-hour window when it is
most effective.
Morgan said most pharmacies in Salt Lake City
do not have Plan B pills on their shelves, and some
pharmacists will refuse to fill a prescription for
birth control because it is against their medical
ethics.
According to Morgan, the best place to get
emergency contraception is at Planned Parent
hood. which wrote 36,(XX) prescriptions for Plan B
last year. Planned Parenthood offers Plan B for
$15 a pack, whereas most pharmacies charge $40.
If a woman does not have access to Plan B, then
she can take her regular birth control pills in a

higher dosage to prevent pregnancy.
"I didn't know you could take regular birth
control pills as emergency contraception," said
Miranda Funston, a student who attended the dis
cussion as a requirement for her psychology class.
While Funston is not alone, most women don't
know that this is an option. Morgan encourages
women to tell their friends about this method be
cause it is easy-especially for girls who don't want
to admit to their families that they have had un
protected sex.
In reality, emergency contraception will not
cause abortion or harm to an established pregnan
cy.
"It does not reverse anything that has already
happened," Morgan said.
Because emergency contraception pills are
safe, nonaddictive and require minimal health
care provider help, they could become an over
the-counter medication, she said.
