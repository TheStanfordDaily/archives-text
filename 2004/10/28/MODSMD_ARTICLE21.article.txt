# Maryland senator blasted for serving alcohol to students at tailgate parties
## 
### TRISH BARBA THE DIAMONDBACK (U. MARYLAND 
(U-WIRE) COLLEGE PARK.
Md. â€” Maryland Sen. John Gian
netti's promotion of a national
game-day tradition that violates
state law has one member of the
College Park City Council fuming.
Last week, Giannetti (D-Anne
Arundel and Prince George's) sent
a letter to the Diamondback invit
ing students to a tailgate sponsored
by Cornerstone Grill and Loft,
Number 1 Liquors and other busi
nesses before the university foot
ball game against Florida State
University, advertising free food
and alcohol.
He also wrote he would work to
provide more recycling containers
on the campus for"beer cans, pizza

boxes and bottles." District 1
Councilman John Krouse criti
cized the promotion, saying Gian
netti should not "be pushing alco
hol consumption and parties in
parking lots."
Maryland law forbids the con
sumption of alcohol in public
places unless authorized by a gov
ernment entity, though Krouse
said University Police seem to
"make a lot of allowances, and
don't enforce the laws aggressively
on game days."
He said inaction could be detri
mental.
"The thousands of alcohol-im
paired football patrons who drive
away from the university on game
day are every bit as dangerous as
those who drive drunk every day,"
he said. "It is astonishing to see our
state senator so openly pandering

this activity to students, the vast
majority of whom are underage."
But Giannetti said Krouse's
criticism negates a positive activity
that is "not all about beer." He
noted Krouse has never been to
one of his tailgates and said the dis
crepancy highlights a history of
contention between the city coun
cil and students.
"The city council just doesn't
get it.... It's about pride for the uni
versity, and it's something I'm
proud of doing," Giannetti said.
Giannetti admits that while he
doesn't card at his tailgates, signs
are posted that alcohol will only be
given to those at least 21 years old
and said there are nonalcoholic
drinks available.
But Delegate Pauline Menes (D-
Anne Arundel and Prince George's)
said Giannetti's support of the event

still makes her uncomfortable.
"I think no one should have the
opportunity to serve liquor to un
derage students," she said. "I'm
not saying that's happening there,
hut it's a likely possibility that
could happen when you invite stu
dents to a tailgate party where it's
advertised that food and alcohol
are available."
Krouse agrees, citing the large
percentage of underage residents
on the campus. But Giannetti is
adamant that no alcohol is served
to underage tailgaters and said it's
just a way for him to reach out to
students.
"1 consider students a major
constituency of mine," he said.
"This is something that not only
promotes pride for the team but
also gets us talking about impor
tant issues."
