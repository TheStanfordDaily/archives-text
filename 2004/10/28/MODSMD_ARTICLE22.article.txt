# Kansas group seeks lower drinking age
## 
### STEPHANIE FARLEY UNIVERSITY DAILY KANSAN (U. KANSAS 
(U-WIRE) LAWRENCE,
Kan. — The University of Kansas
Political Activist Club doesn't
think it is fair that 18-year-olds can
vote but can't sit at a counter in a
bar and have an alcoholic bever
age. According to law, you must be
21 to do so, but that's a law this
group wants to change.
The club's goal is to get the
drinking age lowered to 18.
The club will begin lobbying
the Legislature in January 2005
but has already spoken with staff
members for U.S. Rep. Dennis
Moore (D-Kansas) and Ralph
Nader, Reform Party presidential
candidate.
Lowering the drinking age is
not about going out and getting
plastered, but about a balance in
the adult responsibilities given to
us, said Krystal Werth, Wichita
sophomore and vice president of
the group.
If an 18-year-old can be given
the responsibilities of an adult —
including voting, marriage and
military service — then he should
be able to have a drink, Werth, 19,
said.
Right now people younger than
21 face legal punishments for
drinking underage, but that
doesn't keep some from drinking.
Werth said it was not really a
matter of whether people were
drinking, was a matter of whether
that person was legally or illegally
drinking.

The drinking age was changed
from 18 to 19 on July 1, 1985. The
next year, the age was raised to 20,
and in 1987 it increased to 21. Be
fore 1985, 18-year-olds could only
drink 3.2 percent alcohol.
The National Minimum Drink
ing Age Act of 1984 required all
states to raise the minimum age to
21 for the purchase and public pos
session of alcohol.
States that do comply with the
Act face a reduction in federal
highway and transportation fund
ing.
More than likely, the proposal
for lowering the drinking age
would go through the transporta
tion department before coming to
the state senate or the Kansas
House of Representatives, said
Rachelle Colombo, communica
tions director for Speaker of the
House Doug Mays (D-Topeka).
The big opposition to lowering
the age would be the loss of fund
ing for transportation, Colombo
said.
If the drinking age was lowered
in 2004. the state would lose $25
million dollars in transportation
funding, said Pete Bodyk, bureau
chief for Bureau of Traffic Safety
for the Kansas Department of
Transportation.
"I don't ever see that happen
ing," Bodyk said.
Jared Loehr. Overland Park
sophomore, started the club in
2004. The club now has 300 mem
bers and held its first event, a
march promoting the group, on
Oct. 9 before the homecoming
game.
