## Three sports in one Triathlon welcomes swimmers, runners, bikers and lovers of bearclaws 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN 
The members of the Stanford
triathlon team enjoy swimming a mile,
biking 40 kilometers and then running
for another 10 kilometers. They claim
that some of their favorite "non-tri
events" include underwater basket
weaving and championing fingernail
clippings' civil rights. These facts
prompt the question: Are they crazy?
"Stupid and shameless 1 think is a
better way to describe most of us," said
junior John Duchi. "Once in a while,
we see who can eat the most donuts,
bearclaws and milk before workouts."
Those workouts are no cakewalk
though, as the Stanford triathletes have
to be in top physical condition for their
grueling competitions. The mile / 40k /

10k triathlon is called the Olympic dis
tance. Alternatively, many of the team
members opt for the sprint distance:
swimming half a mile, biking 14 miles
and running five kilometers.
They do both well. At their first
competition of the school year, the
Windman Triathlon on Oct. 10, the top
two finishers in both the men's and the
women's sprint were Stanford triath
letes. Pete Klimas won the men's sprint
in 1 hour 37 minutes, followed by Mark
Hayes with a time of 1:46. Junior
Bristin Jones won the women's sprint
in 1:59, and teammate Molly Morse
placed second in 2:04.
"My favorite part of the race isn't
the swim or the bike or the run; it's the
transitions," said Jones. "The second
transition, bike to run, is known as a
brick because going from the bike to
the run, your legs feel like a weird com
bination of bricks and jello. This transi
tion is pretty hard on the body; that's
why the team has brick practices every
Tuesday."
Intense training is the reason for the

Stanford triathletes' blazing times in
competition. Swimming, running or
biking at least once every day guar
antees that the Stanford triathletes
stay in peak physical condition.
"I practice different things pretty
much every day, and so if swimming
gets boring one day, at least I have a
bike workout to look forward to,"
Duchi said. "If you were ever a runner
or a swimmer or a cyclist and got a lit
tle tired of one of your sports, triathlon
is about the coolest thing ever."
As with most club sports, there
are no tryouts for the Stanford
triathlon team.
Practices are split into groups ac
cording to ability to ensure that no
one is left behind.
"A few co-workers said that I
could never do a triathlon." said
grad student triathlete Brian Brad
ke. "I won the National age group
Championship that very same year
and never looked back."
In fact, many of the Stanford
triathletes do the same and succeed.
Sarah Shulman, Class of 2003, re
cently won her age group at the
Ironman race in Hawaii. The Iron
man distance, which is not a part of
collegiate competitions, involves
swimming five kilometers, biking a
hundred miles, and then running a
marathon. The variety of events in
volved in a triathlon is what most
triathletes love about their sport.

"What we do in the name of
shorter transition times!" Jones said.
"Guys shave their legs to make them
more aerodynamic, and we spray
our bodies with Pam cooking spray
before putting on our wetsuits so
they will slip right off."
Eric Bean, who founded the
Stanford triathlon club in 2000 and
won the Collegiate National Cham
pionship individual title in 2003, now
coaches the team.
Almost all collegiate triathletes
compete at Nationals because, due to
the brief history of collegiate triathlon,
there are no qualifying times. The
sport was first introduced to the
Olympics in 2000, and collegiate
triathlon is less than a decade old.
Students, faculty and staff are
all allowed to join the Stanford
triathlon club, although only stu
dents may compete.
The team will next compete on
Nov. 6 in the Salmon Duathlon,
which is just running and biking.
Most races take place in the winter
and spring quarters.
Club members can also train
with the team but may choose not
to compete.
The only requirements for
membership are a $25 fee per quar
ter and at least one community ser
vice activity.
That's right: the team is not just
about swimming, biking and run-

Triathletes participate
in sport and service

ning. Starting this year, ST2, the
Stanford Triathlon Service Team,
will aim to not only help the commu
nity but also encourage Stanford
triathletes to make a lifelong com
mitment to volunteering.
"There will be various ways to
fulfill the community service com
ponent, such as volunteering to help
coach young athletes or tutoring un
derprivileged students," Jones said.
"We're so fortunate to be here at
Stanford with all these amazing op
portunities. so it's only appropriate
that we go back into the community
to help where we can."
So, maybe "crazy" is not quite
the right description for the Stan
ford triathletes. They're simply fun
loving, service-oriented specimens
of physical fitness. Their social
awareness and consideration for
others, exemplified in ST2, is also
evident on the race course.
"It seems that triathletes are gen
erally really cool." Bradke said. "At
meets and races everyone is friendly
and helpful, and out on the race
course it is not uncommon for ath
letes to cheer each other on. It's a
unique experience I have yet to see
in any other competitive sport."
Students and community mem
bers who would like a taste of
triathlon should sign up for the

Stanford triathletes' blazing times in
competition. Swimming, running or
biking at least once every day guar
antees that the Stanford triathletes
stay in peak physical condition.
"I practice different things pretty
much every day, and so if swimming
gets boring one day, at least I have a
bike workout to look forward to,"
Duchi said. "If you were ever a runner
or a swimmer or a cyclist and got a lit
tle tired of one of your sports, triathlon
is about the coolest thing ever."
As with most club sports, there
are no tryouts for the Stanford
triathlon team.
Practices are split into groups ac
cording to ability to ensure that no
one is left behind.
"A few co-workers said that I
could never do a triathlon." said
grad student triathlete Brian Brad
ke. "I won the National age group
Championship that very same year
and never looked back."
In fact, many of the Stanford
triathletes do the same and succeed.
Sarah Shulman, Class of 2003, re
cently won her age group at the
Ironman race in Hawaii. The Iron
man distance, which is not a part of
collegiate competitions, involves
swimming five kilometers, biking a
hundred miles, and then running a
marathon. The variety of events in
volved in a triathlon is what most
triathletes love about their sport.

"What we do in the name of
shorter transition times!" Jones said.
"Guys shave their legs to make them
more aerodynamic, and we spray
our bodies with Pam cooking spray
before putting on our wetsuits so
they will slip right off."
Eric Bean, who founded the
Stanford triathlon club in 2000 and
won the Collegiate National Cham
pionship individual title in 2003, now
coaches the team.
Almost all collegiate triathletes
compete at Nationals because, due to
the brief history of collegiate triathlon,
there are no qualifying times. The
sport was first introduced to the
Olympics in 2000, and collegiate
triathlon is less than a decade old.
Students, faculty and staff are
all allowed to join the Stanford
triathlon club, although only stu
dents may compete.
The team will next compete on
Nov. 6 in the Salmon Duathlon,
which is just running and biking.
Most races take place in the winter
and spring quarters.
Club members can also train
with the team but may choose not
to compete.
The only requirements for
membership are a $25 fee per quar
ter and at least one community ser
vice activity.
That's right: the team is not just
about swimming, biking and run-

Triathletes participate
in sport and service

ning. Starting this year, ST2, the
Stanford Triathlon Service Team,
will aim to not only help the commu
nity but also encourage Stanford
triathletes to make a lifelong com
mitment to volunteering.
"There will be various ways to
fulfill the community service com
ponent, such as volunteering to help
coach young athletes or tutoring un
derprivileged students," Jones said.
"We're so fortunate to be here at
Stanford with all these amazing op
portunities. so it's only appropriate
that we go back into the community
to help where we can."
So, maybe "crazy" is not quite
the right description for the Stan
ford triathletes. They're simply fun
loving, service-oriented specimens
of physical fitness. Their social
awareness and consideration for
others, exemplified in ST2, is also
evident on the race course.
"It seems that triathletes are gen
erally really cool." Bradke said. "At
meets and races everyone is friendly
and helpful, and out on the race
course it is not uncommon for ath
letes to cheer each other on. It's a
unique experience I have yet to see
in any other competitive sport."
Students and community mem
bers who would like a taste of
triathlon should sign up for the
"Stanford Treeathlon," a sprint dis
tance race to be held Feb. 27.
The members of the Stanford
triathlon team enjoy swimming a mile,
biking 40 kilometers and then running
for another 10 kilometers. They claim
that some of their favorite "non-tri
events" include underwater basket
weaving and championing fingernail
clippings' civil rights. These facts
prompt the question: Are they crazy?
"Stupid and shameless 1 think is a
better way to describe most of us," said
junior John Duchi. "Once in a while,
we see who can eat the most donuts,
bearclaws and milk before workouts."
Those workouts are no cakewalk
though, as the Stanford triathletes have
to be in top physical condition for their
grueling competitions. The mile / 40k /

10k triathlon is called the Olympic dis
tance. Alternatively, many of the team
members opt for the sprint distance:
swimming half a mile, biking 14 miles
and running five kilometers.
They do both well. At their first
competition of the school year, the
Windman Triathlon on Oct. 10, the top
two finishers in both the men's and the
women's sprint were Stanford triath
letes. Pete Klimas won the men's sprint
in 1 hour 37 minutes, followed by Mark
Hayes with a time of 1:46. Junior
Bristin Jones won the women's sprint
in 1:59, and teammate Molly Morse
placed second in 2:04.
"My favorite part of the race isn't
the swim or the bike or the run; it's the
transitions," said Jones. "The second
transition, bike to run, is known as a
brick because going from the bike to
the run, your legs feel like a weird com
bination of bricks and jello. This transi
tion is pretty hard on the body; that's
why the team has brick practices every
Tuesday."
