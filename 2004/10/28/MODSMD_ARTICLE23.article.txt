## Three sports in one Triathlon welcomes swimmers, runners, bikers and lovers of bearclaws 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN 
The members of the Stanford
triathlon team enjoy swimming a mile,
biking 40 kilometers and then running
for another 10 kilometers. They claim
that some of their favorite "non-tri
events" include underwater basket
weaving and championing fingernail
clippings' civil rights. These facts
prompt the question: Are they crazy?
"Stupid and shameless 1 think is a
better way to describe most of us," said
junior John Duchi. "Once in a while,
we see who can eat the most donuts,
bearclaws and milk before workouts."
Those workouts are no cakewalk
though, as the Stanford triathletes have
to be in top physical condition for their
grueling competitions. The mile / 40k /

10k triathlon is called the Olympic dis
tance. Alternatively, many of the team
members opt for the sprint distance:
swimming half a mile, biking 14 miles
and running five kilometers.
They do both well. At their first
competition of the school year, the
Windman Triathlon on Oct. 10, the top
two finishers in both the men's and the
women's sprint were Stanford triath
letes. Pete Klimas won the men's sprint
in 1 hour 37 minutes, followed by Mark
Hayes with a time of 1:46. Junior
Bristin Jones won the women's sprint
in 1:59, and teammate Molly Morse
placed second in 2:04.
"My favorite part of the race isn't
the swim or the bike or the run; it's the
transitions," said Jones. "The second
transition, bike to run, is known as a
brick because going from the bike to
the run, your legs feel like a weird com
bination of bricks and jello. This transi
tion is pretty hard on the body; that's
why the team has brick practices every
Tuesday."
Intense training is the reason for the
