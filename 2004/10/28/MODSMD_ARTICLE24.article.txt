# Divers plunge into three-way
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW 
Of all the teams Dr. Rick Schavone
has coached in the last two and a half
decades, he sees something special in this
year's squad of women's divers.
"We made some changes in our pro
gram this year," Schavone said. "They've
been showing in practice to be making
some significant changes and improve
ments, and we weren't sure how that
would carry over to the meet."
"It was probably the finest first meet
I've had in 26 years of coaching. I was just
ecstatic."
The performances he is referring to
are those of divers senior Ashlee Rosen
thal and sophomore Cassidy Krug
against Hawaii last weekend. Rosenthal
and Krug each earned second- and third
place finishes in the one- and three-meter

springboard competitions.
This Friday and Saturday, Rosenthal
and Krug will head to Austin, Tex., where
they will be joined by teammates junior
Sara Bowling, freshman Katie Lampe
and senior Erin Lashnits. Rosenthal and
Krug are the top two springboard divers
on the team, but the other three are capa
ble of contributing as well.
"Bowling is the top [platform] diver
on the team, but she's not a great spring
board diver," Schavone said. "Katie pret
ty much does all three pretty well, but
she's young. Erin just keeps improving
every time she steps on a board, so you
just don't know when she's going to
stop."
The five Stanford divers will be going
up against a talented field — No. 13
Southern California and No. 6 Texas —
in the three-way meet. Texas is headlined

by freshman Nikki Triplett, 2003 Texas
state champion in the one-meter spring
board, and senior Nicole Pohorenec, the
2004 NCAA champion in platform.
Texas sophomore Ali Bunting won
both the one- and three-meter competi
tions against Kansas last week. USC ace
junior Blythe Hartley, an Olympic
bronze medalist in synchronized plat
form, is clearly the one to beat in this
field.
But Schavone is optimistic nonethe
less about his team's chances.
"It should be a great training meet,
and I think performance-wise we should
do very respectable," he said.
Swimming coach Richard Quick is
equally satisfied by the progress that his
team has made early in the season. The
team put on quite a show last weekend,
dominating No. 22 Hawaii.

"We had some very good perfor
mances," Quick said. "[The race winners]
did a real good job winning their events
and posting pretty good times for this
time of the year. Many of the other girls
did really good jobs for this point in the
year. It's a good starting place for our
team to be."
Last weekend's winners — freshman
Caroline Bruce, junior Dana Kirk, senior
Lacey Boutwell, sophomore Lauren
Costella and sophomore Desiree Stahley
— will look to repeat their successes in
Austin. Bruce won three races — the
100- and 200-yard breaststroke and 200-
yard individual medley.
"It was a high-energy meet," Bruce
said. "I was excited because the team did
really well, and I was pretty excited about

the times I was going because I usu
ally haven't gone that fast. "
The other Stanford victories
were spread over several strokes
and included middle- and long-dis
tance races. Kirk swept the 100 and
200 butterfly and Boutwell took
first in the 200-yard freestyle.
Costelia won the 1000-yard
freestyle, and Stahley won her first
collegiate race ever with her victory
in the 500-yard freestyle.
Bruce, Kirk, senior Amy Wagn
er and freshman Brooke Bishop
added one more win in the 200-yard
medley relay.
The only stroke in which Stan
ford did not win a race is the back
stroke. an area where the team was
shorthanded. The return of
Olympian Kristen Caverly, who
missed the Hawaii meet due to ill
ness, should help rectify this.
This will be the first intercolle
giate meet of the season for the
Trojans, who finished ninth at the
National Championships last year.
Thev are led bv 2004 Pac-10 New

comer of the Year and returning
Olympian sophomore Kalyn Keller
who as a freshman, set the Ameri
can record in the 1500-meter
freestyle at the NCAA Champi
onships. where she also came in sec
ond in the 400-meter freestyle.
Keller also holds the Pac-10 record
in the mile freestyle.
Another USC representative at
the Olympics in Athens was
Kaitlin Sandeno, a senior who
may be taking the season off after
the Olympics. At the Olympics,
she won three gold medals in one
day, in the 200 butterfly, 400 indi
vidual medley, and 800 freestyle
relay.
Last season, head-to-head, the
Cardinal beat the Trojans 178 to
132 and edged Texas 188-165 to win
their preseason meeting.
Texas has strong swimmers in all
strokes, but its strengths are in
freestyle and backstroke.
Senior Sarah Wanezek placed
fifth at the Olympic Trials and sixth
at last vear's NCAA meet in the 50-

USC, Texas offer more
challenges than Hawaii

meter freestyle. Freestyler junior
Kristy Siminski is an All-American
in both the 200- and 400-meter
races. Senior Alisa Schuknecht
placed fourth in last year's National
Championships in the 400-meter
individual medley.
A pair of talented freshmen also
help the Longhorns in the hack
stroke. Diana MacManus brought
home the gold medal from the 2003
Pan-Am Games in the 100-meter
backstroke, and Hayley McGrego
ry won the 2004 National Champi
onship in both the 100- and 200-
meter races.
This weekend's three-team
meet should be decided by a much
smaller margin than Stanford's vic
tory over Hawaii.
"It'll be much closer," Quick
said. "Texas is a much better team
than Hawaii, much more depth,
much more quality. They're a very
good team. Of course USC is in the
meet, and they have some excellent
swimmers, so it'll be a much more
competitive meet."
