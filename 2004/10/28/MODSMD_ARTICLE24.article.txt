# Divers plunge into three-way
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW 
Of all the teams Dr. Rick Schavone
has coached in the last two and a half
decades, he sees something special in this
year's squad of women's divers.
"We made some changes in our pro
gram this year," Schavone said. "They've
been showing in practice to be making
some significant changes and improve
ments, and we weren't sure how that
would carry over to the meet."
"It was probably the finest first meet
I've had in 26 years of coaching. I was just
ecstatic."
The performances he is referring to
are those of divers senior Ashlee Rosen
thal and sophomore Cassidy Krug
against Hawaii last weekend. Rosenthal
and Krug each earned second- and third
place finishes in the one- and three-meter

springboard competitions.
This Friday and Saturday, Rosenthal
and Krug will head to Austin, Tex., where
they will be joined by teammates junior
Sara Bowling, freshman Katie Lampe
and senior Erin Lashnits. Rosenthal and
Krug are the top two springboard divers
on the team, but the other three are capa
ble of contributing as well.
"Bowling is the top [platform] diver
on the team, but she's not a great spring
board diver," Schavone said. "Katie pret
ty much does all three pretty well, but
she's young. Erin just keeps improving
every time she steps on a board, so you
just don't know when she's going to
stop."
The five Stanford divers will be going
up against a talented field — No. 13
Southern California and No. 6 Texas —
in the three-way meet. Texas is headlined

by freshman Nikki Triplett, 2003 Texas
state champion in the one-meter spring
board, and senior Nicole Pohorenec, the
2004 NCAA champion in platform.
Texas sophomore Ali Bunting won
both the one- and three-meter competi
tions against Kansas last week. USC ace
junior Blythe Hartley, an Olympic
bronze medalist in synchronized plat
form, is clearly the one to beat in this
field.
But Schavone is optimistic nonethe
less about his team's chances.
"It should be a great training meet,
and I think performance-wise we should
do very respectable," he said.
Swimming coach Richard Quick is
equally satisfied by the progress that his
team has made early in the season. The
team put on quite a show last weekend,
dominating No. 22 Hawaii.

"We had some very good perfor
mances," Quick said. "[The race winners]
did a real good job winning their events
and posting pretty good times for this
time of the year. Many of the other girls
did really good jobs for this point in the
year. It's a good starting place for our
team to be."
Last weekend's winners — freshman
Caroline Bruce, junior Dana Kirk, senior
Lacey Boutwell, sophomore Lauren
Costella and sophomore Desiree Stahley
— will look to repeat their successes in
Austin. Bruce won three races — the
100- and 200-yard breaststroke and 200-
yard individual medley.
"It was a high-energy meet," Bruce
said. "I was excited because the team did
really well, and I was pretty excited about
