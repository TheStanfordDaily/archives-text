# Going to California: Card to face Golden Bears
## 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a close call between the teams
earlier this year, there's a lot of
buildup for this Saturday's matchup
between the Stanford women's field
hockey team (6-10,0-5 Northern Pacif
ic Athletic Conference) and No. 14
California (14-4,4-1 NorPac).
It's the final game of the season for
both teams. It's Senior Day for the
Golden Bears. And of course, it
doesn't get much bigger than the Big
Game between Stanford and Cal every
year.
"There are going to be a lot of peo
ple there," said junior goalkeeper Ana
Kralovec. "It's going to be a charged
atmosphere, and I think that will play
to our advantage because we always
get up for the Cal game."
The Cardinal are coming off a con
ference loss to Pacific last Saturday in
a closely contested match. Pacific
came from behind to take a 2-1 edge in
the game and staved off a furious Stan

ford attack in the last 20 minutes of the
game to hold on fora win.
"We came out really well, but we
were inconsistent," said head coach
Lesley Irvine. "In the second half, the
team really started playing hard, and
we created some great offense. It was
really frustrating for the team to not be
able to score."
The loss dropped the Cardinal to 0-
5 in their league and assured that they
would finish last in the regular-season
conference standings. However, Stan
ford will still be eligible to play in the
NorPac tournament after the Cal
game.
"I think it's really important for our
team to take this game as preparation
for the tournament," Kralovec said.
"We're lucky that our conference al
lows us to go into the tournament hav
ing had the losses we have had."
The two teams met earlier this sea
son in an intense battle that is charac
teristic of Stanford / Cal matchups.
The Bears applied constant pressure
to the Stanford defense and eventually

got the best of the Cardinal in double
overtime.
"That was a great overtime game,"
Kralovec said. "They put a lot of pres
sure on us and took a lot of shots. It's
been a huge focus of ours to increase
the number of shots we're taking and
mount a bigger offensive threat for this
[Saturday's] game."
Cal is coming off of a string of
strong wins against quality opponents.
The Bears boast a strong offense that
features dangerous forward Valentina
Godfrid, who has scored four goals in
Cal'slast two games.
"We need to shut down their key
players," said senior midfielder
Eleanor Morgan. "Cal has a tendency
to center around a few main players, so
we need to take them out of their game
and apply pressure ourselves and score
early."
Morgan, the lone senior on the
team, was recently selected to the
North-South All Star Team, a group
made up of the most talented seniors in
the country. Morgan will play her last

regular season game with Stanford on
Saturday.
"It's emotional," Morgan said. "It's
sad to think that I can't play with the
team next season. I see so much poten
tial for the future in our team."
The Cardinal hope to give Morgan
a final regular-season win by fixing
some of the inconsistencies that have
led to previous losses.
"I think one thing our team has
been working on is our offensive and
defensive execution," Kralovec said.
"We have great offensive players, but
we've had some trouble scoring this
year. Hopefully our work on execution
will all come together this weekend."
As the goalkeeper and leader of the
defense, Kralovec believes that with
solid play, the Stanford defense can
shut down the prolific Cal offense.
"They have a great offense and a
really strong central core on the field,
but we just need to be moving our feet

and marking their forwards
tightly," Kralovec said.
Having lost eight of their 10
matches by one goal this sea
son. the Cardinal hope to earn
a victory at Berkeley this week
end to give themselves some
momentum as they head into
the conference tournament.
The Cardinal have played
excellent games against the
ranked opponents they have
faced this year, Cal and Boston
College. However, the team is
looking forward to translating
"excellent games" into wins for
this Saturday and the confer

ence tournament.
With the charged atmo
sphere that always comes along
with any Stanford and Cal game
and the emotions that run high
during Senior Day. Saturday's
matchup has all the makings of a
truly big game.
And although most people
have marked Nov. 20 on their
calendars as the "official" Big
Game, the Stanford women
know that the first, real Big
Game is this Saturday, and it
would be sweet to earn a Big
Win.

"We're lucky that our conference al
lows us to go into the tournament hav
ing had the losses we have had."
The two teams met earlier this sea
son in an intense battle that is charac
teristic of Stanford / Cal matchups.
The Bears applied constant pressure
to the Stanford defense and eventually

got the best of the Cardinal in double
overtime.
"That was a great overtime game,"
Kralovec said. "They put a lot of pres
sure on us and took a lot of shots. It's
been a huge focus of ours to increase
the number of shots we're taking and
mount a bigger offensive threat for this
[Saturday's] game."
Cal is coming off of a string of
strong wins against quality opponents.
The Bears boast a strong offense that
features dangerous forward Valentina
Godfrid, who has scored four goals in
Cal'slast two games.
"We need to shut down their key
players," said senior midfielder
Eleanor Morgan. "Cal has a tendency
to center around a few main players, so
we need to take them out of their game
and apply pressure ourselves and score
early."
Morgan, the lone senior on the
team, was recently selected to the
North-South All Star Team, a group
made up of the most talented seniors in
the country. Morgan will play her last

regular season game with Stanford on
Saturday.
"It's emotional," Morgan said. "It's
sad to think that I can't play with the
team next season. I see so much poten
tial for the future in our team."
The Cardinal hope to give Morgan
a final regular-season win by fixing
some of the inconsistencies that have
led to previous losses.
"I think one thing our team has
been working on is our offensive and
defensive execution," Kralovec said.
"We have great offensive players, but
we've had some trouble scoring this
year. Hopefully our work on execution
will all come together this weekend."
As the goalkeeper and leader of the
defense, Kralovec believes that with
solid play, the Stanford defense can
shut down the prolific Cal offense.
"They have a great offense and a
really strong central core on the field,
but we just need to be moving our feet

and marking their forwards
tightly," Kralovec said.
Having lost eight of their 10
matches by one goal this sea
son. the Cardinal hope to earn
a victory at Berkeley this week
end to give themselves some
momentum as they head into
the conference tournament.
The Cardinal have played
excellent games against the
ranked opponents they have
faced this year, Cal and Boston
College. However, the team is
looking forward to translating
"excellent games" into wins for
this Saturday and the confer

ence tournament.
With the charged atmo
sphere that always comes along
with any Stanford and Cal game
and the emotions that run high
during Senior Day. Saturday's
matchup has all the makings of a
truly big game.
And although most people
have marked Nov. 20 on their
calendars as the "official" Big
Game, the Stanford women
know that the first, real Big
Game is this Saturday, and it
would be sweet to earn a Big
Win.
After a close call between the teams
earlier this year, there's a lot of
buildup for this Saturday's matchup
between the Stanford women's field
hockey team (6-10,0-5 Northern Pacif
ic Athletic Conference) and No. 14
California (14-4,4-1 NorPac).
It's the final game of the season for
both teams. It's Senior Day for the
Golden Bears. And of course, it
doesn't get much bigger than the Big
Game between Stanford and Cal every
year.
"There are going to be a lot of peo
ple there," said junior goalkeeper Ana
Kralovec. "It's going to be a charged
atmosphere, and I think that will play
to our advantage because we always
get up for the Cal game."
The Cardinal are coming off a con
ference loss to Pacific last Saturday in
a closely contested match. Pacific
came from behind to take a 2-1 edge in
the game and staved off a furious Stan

ford attack in the last 20 minutes of the
game to hold on fora win.
"We came out really well, but we
were inconsistent," said head coach
Lesley Irvine. "In the second half, the
team really started playing hard, and
we created some great offense. It was
really frustrating for the team to not be
able to score."
The loss dropped the Cardinal to 0-
5 in their league and assured that they
would finish last in the regular-season
conference standings. However, Stan
ford will still be eligible to play in the
NorPac tournament after the Cal
game.
"I think it's really important for our
team to take this game as preparation
for the tournament," Kralovec said.
