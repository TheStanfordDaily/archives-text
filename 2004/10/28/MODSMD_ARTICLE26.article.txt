# Hernandez returns to practice after sprain
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford men's basketball fans can
breathe a collective sigh of relief, as junior
point guard Chris Hernandez, who
sprained his right ankle three weeks ago,
has practiced with the team every day this
week.
"Monday 1 practiced a little, Tuesday a
little more and today a lot more," Hernan
dez said after practice yesterday."I pretty
much went through the whole thing today."
While Hernandez was doing layup drills
with a team trainer as early as last week,
when his injury and absence from practice
were first reported, he had not participated
in a team practice until Monday. His team
mates have been on the court since Oct. 16,
when practices officially started.
"It's feeling good," Hernandez said.
"Obviously it's not going to be 100 percent
as far as explosiveness goes fora few weeks,
but it's feeling good enough to practice, and
that's a huge difference from last week. By

the first game it should be back to normal."
Stanford opens the season with an exhi
bition game against Concordia (Calif.) on
Nov. 13 in Santa Clara, its home away from
home while the finishing touches are put on
renovated Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal
will tip off the regular season six days later
at the Pete Newell Challenge in Oakland
against San Francisco.
Hernandez won't have to wait that long
to test his ankle under game-like condi
tions, however. The team is scheduled to
scrimmage this weekend at Ford Center,
and Hernandez said he expects to play.
The point guard's slow but steady return
to the court this week is encouraging news
for first-year head coach Trent Johnson,
who will continue to monitor the ankle and
err on the side of caution in the coming
days. Hernandez said he continues to treat
the ankle with ice.
While initially alarming, the injury is
much less severe than the one that caused
Hernandez to miss all but 18 minutes of
the 2002-03 season. That year, he broke
a bone in his left foot prior to the season
and then broke the same bone in just
his second game back.
Besides missing two non-confer
ence games with back spasms, Hernan
dez remained relatively injury free last
season and dished out 4.3 assists per
game (with a 1.86 assist-to-turnover
ratio) as the floor general for the 30-2
Cardinal. Hernandez, who's known for
his first-on-the-floor intensity, also shot
46 percent from three-point range and
is Stanford's leading returning scorer
(10.0 points per game).
