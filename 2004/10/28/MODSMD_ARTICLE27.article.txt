# The 						Double Clutch
## A 						Tale of Two Dynasties that died in 2004 
### CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON 
The writing was on the wall. We should
have seen this coming. It looks so obvi
ous in retrospect; that the Yankees and
Lakers were finished, left behind by evolving
leagues and strategies, and that the boogey
man was waiting behind the corner to whack
them.
But seriously, who would have thought we
would see the two most dominant teams in re
cent memory defeated — destroyed, in fact —
in the space of four months?
I won't take credit for it (I didn't see it com
ing either), but I will take you through the par
allel stories of two empires' rise and fall. Let's
start with the still-warm carcass before mov
ing on to the tagged toe.
George Steinbrenner bought the Yankee
franchise with his family's shipbuilding money
and quickly gained a reputation as both a re
lentless competitor and a micromanager with
a temper. His histrionic demands kept blue
chip talent away from the pinstripes, deep
pockets be damned.
The philosophy changed in the 90's, and
with the patient development of young play
ers combined with consistent veterans, the
Yankees set a new standard for success in the
free-agency era, winning four Major League
championships in five seasons (1996 and 1998-
2000).
So tough have they been that since 1998,
only two teams have won a World Series —
New York, and the team that beats them in the
postseason.
The link that finally broke was the Yan
kees' strongest one. Pitcher Mariano Rivera
overthrew second base defending a bunt in the
final inning of the 2001 World Series, setting
up a two-run rally that put the Diamondbacks
on top and molted the image of the unbeat
able Yankee club.
Seeking a return to glory, dollars were
again hung out for big-name players. They got
them.
New York pulled MVP Alex
Rodriguez to its club last winter, in
addition to top-dollar pitcher
Kevin Brown. As it turned out,
both critically hurt the team.
Brown took out his anger on the
clubhouse wall in September,
breaking his hand. He would return
from surgery physically weak and
mentally shattered, giving up five
earned runs in New York's season
ending 10-3 rout at the hands of the
Red Sox — the final, humiliating
destruction.
Ever-clean Rodriguez violently
escalated ;i beaning incident by the
Red Sox into a bench-clearing
brawl this summer. He followed
that up by slapping Boston pitcher
Bronson Arroyo's arm last week,
shedding his classy image.
The lasting image of the Yankee
collapse will be manager Joe Torre
indignantly arguing the call, with
replays of A-Rod's cheap play in
the background.
The Los Angeles Lakers had a
similar spell of mediocrity (who
hasn't in the NBA?) after the loss
of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic
lohnson and others.

But things began to turn with
the acquisition of Shaquille
O'Neal, the development of young
star Kobe Bryant and the hiring of
eccentric Bulls coach Phil Jackson,
who had coached Michael Jordan
et al to six NBA titles.
It could be said that the Lakers
dynasty was officially born in game
seven of the 2(XX) Western Confer
ence Finals. L.A. stormed back
from 15 points down against Port
land and kept rolling to the NBA
title, the first of three in a row.
Their finals sweep of New Jer
sey in 2002 was almost a formality
after the epic seven-game confer
ence final versus the Sacramento
Kings — a nail-biting series featur
ing loose lips, nasty fouls, contro
versial officiating and a game-win
ning three-point shot with no time
left. At that point, it was impossible
to predict when the Lakers train
would stop. They seemed able to
put aside well-publicized personal
differences when they put on the
uniform, executing the team bas
ketball that made Jackson
renowned.
But Los Angeles' empire began
to frav. Brvant's sexual assault case

Lakers looked good,
couldn't deliver at end

seemed to bring out a sense of ur
gency, including ripping Shaq to
the press.
Prior to the 2(X)3 season, L.A.
drank the Steinbrenner Kool-Aid
and signed Gary Payton and Karl
Malone, two aging stars who des
perately wanted championship
rings. The strategy backfired, as
Payton struggled to fit with the of
fense and the star power crowded
out the humble but critical role
players such as Derek Fisher and
Rick Fox (who is now better known
as Vanessa Williams' ex-husband.)
Though they looked invincible
again, the Lakers empire came to
an end at the hands of the Detroit
Pistons, who hung their hat on
tough team defense and exploited
L. A.'s weaknesses.
No dynasty can last forever. It
isn't expected that one will putter
to the side of road and shut down,
with four flat tires and the engine
smoking, but this year shows that
all it takes is the right team to throw
the blow.

George Steinbrenner bought the Yankee
franchise with his family's shipbuilding money
and quickly gained a reputation as both a re
lentless competitor and a micromanager with
a temper. His histrionic demands kept blue
chip talent away from the pinstripes, deep
pockets be damned.
The philosophy changed in the 90's, and
with the patient development of young play
ers combined with consistent veterans, the
Yankees set a new standard for success in the
free-agency era, winning four Major League
championships in five seasons (1996 and 1998-
2000).
So tough have they been that since 1998,
only two teams have won a World Series —
New York, and the team that beats them in the
postseason.
The link that finally broke was the Yan
kees' strongest one. Pitcher Mariano Rivera
overthrew second base defending a bunt in the
final inning of the 2001 World Series, setting
up a two-run rally that put the Diamondbacks
on top and molted the image of the unbeat
able Yankee club.
Seeking a return to glory, dollars were
again hung out for big-name players. They got
them.
New York pulled MVP Alex
Rodriguez to its club last winter, in
addition to top-dollar pitcher
Kevin Brown. As it turned out,
both critically hurt the team.
Brown took out his anger on the
clubhouse wall in September,
breaking his hand. He would return
from surgery physically weak and
mentally shattered, giving up five
earned runs in New York's season
ending 10-3 rout at the hands of the
Red Sox — the final, humiliating
destruction.
Ever-clean Rodriguez violently
escalated ;i beaning incident by the
Red Sox into a bench-clearing
brawl this summer. He followed
that up by slapping Boston pitcher
Bronson Arroyo's arm last week,
shedding his classy image.
The lasting image of the Yankee
collapse will be manager Joe Torre
indignantly arguing the call, with
replays of A-Rod's cheap play in
the background.
The Los Angeles Lakers had a
similar spell of mediocrity (who
hasn't in the NBA?) after the loss
of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic
lohnson and others.

But things began to turn with
the acquisition of Shaquille
O'Neal, the development of young
star Kobe Bryant and the hiring of
eccentric Bulls coach Phil Jackson,
who had coached Michael Jordan
et al to six NBA titles.
It could be said that the Lakers
dynasty was officially born in game
seven of the 2(XX) Western Confer
ence Finals. L.A. stormed back
from 15 points down against Port
land and kept rolling to the NBA
title, the first of three in a row.
Their finals sweep of New Jer
sey in 2002 was almost a formality
after the epic seven-game confer
ence final versus the Sacramento
Kings — a nail-biting series featur
ing loose lips, nasty fouls, contro
versial officiating and a game-win
ning three-point shot with no time
left. At that point, it was impossible
to predict when the Lakers train
would stop. They seemed able to
put aside well-publicized personal
differences when they put on the
uniform, executing the team bas
ketball that made Jackson
renowned.
But Los Angeles' empire began
to frav. Brvant's sexual assault case

Lakers looked good,
couldn't deliver at end

seemed to bring out a sense of ur
gency, including ripping Shaq to
the press.
Prior to the 2(X)3 season, L.A.
drank the Steinbrenner Kool-Aid
and signed Gary Payton and Karl
Malone, two aging stars who des
perately wanted championship
rings. The strategy backfired, as
Payton struggled to fit with the of
fense and the star power crowded
out the humble but critical role
players such as Derek Fisher and
Rick Fox (who is now better known
as Vanessa Williams' ex-husband.)
Though they looked invincible
again, the Lakers empire came to
an end at the hands of the Detroit
Pistons, who hung their hat on
tough team defense and exploited
L. A.'s weaknesses.
No dynasty can last forever. It
isn't expected that one will putter
to the side of road and shut down,
with four flat tires and the engine
smoking, but this year shows that
all it takes is the right team to throw
the blow.

The writing was on the wall. We should
have seen this coming. It looks so obvi
ous in retrospect; that the Yankees and
Lakers were finished, left behind by evolving
leagues and strategies, and that the boogey
man was waiting behind the corner to whack
them.
But seriously, who would have thought we
would see the two most dominant teams in re
cent memory defeated — destroyed, in fact —
in the space of four months?
I won't take credit for it (I didn't see it com
ing either), but I will take you through the par
allel stories of two empires' rise and fall. Let's
start with the still-warm carcass before mov
ing on to the tagged toe.
