# Athletes enjoy special food at cafe
## 
### MEGAN WATKINS 
Jimmy V's Sports Cafe serves
free grub for select student athletes,
a perk that has some other students
crying foul.
Located in the Arrillaga Family
Recreation Center, the cafe feeds
students through Training Table, a
buffet dinner program paid for by
Athletic Department scholarship
dollars. Varsity teams eat at the
Jimmy V's with varying frequency;
the basketball and football teams eat
there nightly, a handful of other
sports like women's gymnastics and
women's volleyball dine on practice
days, and still other teams only eat at
the cafe when recruits are visiting.
"Jimmy V's is what gets me
through practice everyday, because
I know that after practice Jim will
have some great food wailing for
us," said sophomore Kristen Newl
in, who is on the basketball team.
The owner, Jimmy V. said he
works to provide healthy food for
the teams and tailors menus to ath
lete feedback.
"It's very rewarding," he said.
"I'm very fortunate to have this op
portunity."
Some non-athletes, however, are
less than enthused about Training
Table.

Sophomore Steven Lehrburger,
who was previously unaware of the
cafe's existence until informed by
this reporter, expressed reservations
about the program.
"I am not aware of any com
pelling arguments as to why athletes
should get better food than the rest
of us, especially without a corre
sponding difference in tuition or
board." he said. "Also, separate din

ing privileges and facilities only
serve to further segregate the ath
letes from the rest of the students."
Sophomore Megan Kane said the
issue pointed to the University's pri
orities.
"The athletes of Stanford are the
representatives of the University to
