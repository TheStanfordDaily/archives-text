# Athletes enjoy special food at cafe
## 
### MEGAN WATKINS 
Jimmy V's Sports Cafe serves
free grub for select student athletes,
a perk that has some other students
crying foul.
Located in the Arrillaga Family
Recreation Center, the cafe feeds
students through Training Table, a
buffet dinner program paid for by
Athletic Department scholarship
dollars. Varsity teams eat at the
Jimmy V's with varying frequency;
the basketball and football teams eat
there nightly, a handful of other
sports like women's gymnastics and
women's volleyball dine on practice
days, and still other teams only eat at
the cafe when recruits are visiting.
"Jimmy V's is what gets me
through practice everyday, because
I know that after practice Jim will
have some great food wailing for
us," said sophomore Kristen Newl
in, who is on the basketball team.
The owner, Jimmy V. said he
works to provide healthy food for
the teams and tailors menus to ath
lete feedback.
"It's very rewarding," he said.
"I'm very fortunate to have this op
portunity."
Some non-athletes, however, are
less than enthused about Training
Table.

Sophomore Steven Lehrburger,
who was previously unaware of the
cafe's existence until informed by
this reporter, expressed reservations
about the program.
"I am not aware of any com
pelling arguments as to why athletes
should get better food than the rest
of us, especially without a corre
sponding difference in tuition or
board." he said. "Also, separate din

ing privileges and facilities only
serve to further segregate the ath
letes from the rest of the students."
Sophomore Megan Kane said the
issue pointed to the University's pri
orities.

the vast majority of the public, but by offering bet
ter food to these students, Stanford is admitting
the inadequacies of what they provide for the rest
of student body," she said.
"If the food in the dining halls at Stern, FloMo
and the rest of campus is not good enough for the
athletes, why is it acceptable for the rest of us?
Through such polices Stanford is proving what
many people already believe â€” that it. as a Uni
versity, values the athletes more than the rest of
the students," Kane added.

she said. "I think the purpose of it is to ensure that
football players never have a shortage of food in
order to sustain their weight. I am happy with the
meal plan provided by my housing."
Newlin deflected student criticism.
"This is just part of our scholarship and what
the school gives us," she said. "We don't decide
who gets to eat there, but it's what available to us."
