# Int'l students sound off on election
## 
### ELAINE CHOI 
As Election Day nears and most of America re
mains divided, many of Stanford's international under
graduates find neither Sen. John Kerry nor President
George W. Bush well-suited to the job of president.
However, reflecting what many perceive as negative
international sentiments against the Bush administra
tion, many said they would favor Kerry for president
over Bush.
"I find both candidates really uninspiring," said
freshman Mike Krieger. a Brazilian citizen. "Bush is a

more dangerous president, but Kerry is also not the
right man to lead America into the 21st century. In
Brazil, everyone would vote for Kerry because there is
an enormous amount of anti-American sentiment due
to Bush and his policies."
Sophomore Samvit Kanoria, who is from India, said
that people in his home country are paying close atten
tion to the upcoming election
"The upper-middle class has a great deal of interest
and are informed of world affairs," he said. "The busi-
ness community is worried most
about the potential bans Kerry could
put in place."
In Canada, according to fresh
man lan Wong, there is a lot of inter
est in the election due to the proxim
ity between Canada and the United
States and their shared cultures.
"So much of Canadian culture
has American culture in it so what
ever America does has a big impact
on Canada," he said. "Around my
circle of friends and family in Cana
da, they would choose Kerry over
Bush because they are against this
war in Iraq. I would say most of
Canada is against the war because
Canada usually takes on a peace
keeping role."
Freshman Florian Schmitzberger
of Austria also thinks people in his
country would support Kerry.
"The American elections make
the headline news every other day,"
he said. "Most of Austria I would say
is pro-Kerry, but that is most likely a
result of the strong anti-Bush policy.
No one really cares that much or
knows that much about Kerry."
While some international stu
dents actively engage in political de
bates, some felt reserved about par
ticipating in discussions of American
politics because of their back
grounds.
"I don't feel like 1 can say any
thing about the election or politics
here because it just seems sort of
wrong and out of place," Kricger
said. "There is an underlying as
sumption that because I am a for
eigner I don't know that much about
the politics here."
Despite the enormous national

media coverage the election has re
ceived in recent weeks, Krieger said
he felt the foreign press is able to
present a broader range of views
about the candidates.
"I think people abroad have
more information about the candi
dates than the Americans do be
cause the international people get
less filtered information and if they
are filtered, there are more diverse
sources and different filters," he
said.
Many international students said
that American voters are presented
little choice in terms of the candi
dates and their qualifications in the
national election.
"It's weird how America only has
two parties," Wong said. "In Canada
there are also two main parties, but
there is also a broader range of sig
nificant other parties and candidates
to choose from.
The qualities of the candidates in
this election do not present too much
choice to the voter. I doubt the abili
ty of Bush as a leader because of the
way he conducts himself. He's not
very professional."
Schmitzberger also said he thinks
Americans have limited options in
terms of their choice in president,
pointing out that in Austria, there
are four active parties and each have
chances to be elected into power.
"I hate the two party system be
cause it provides less of an option to
voters,"he said. "In this election,
voters must choose to vote Republi
can or less Republican.
People are urged to vote for the
main parties because voting fora
third party would hurt Democrats.

Since they would rather have a De
mocrat than a Republican, they vote
Democrat rather than the third
party."
Between the two candidates,
Kanoria said that he would choose
Kerry over Bush, though he saw
flaws in Kerry's economic plans.
"It seems that Kerry is more well
versed with the way the world
works," Kanoria said. "However, his
budget plans are ridiculous because
there is already a huge deficit. It
seems that he is offering more empty
promises in terms of the economy."
The international students ex
pressed greatest concern in the is
sues of foreign policy and America's
future stance in the world.
"The president needs to be more
cooperative with international orga
nizations and agencies,"
Schmitzberger said. "I think Ameri
ca needs less of a hard-line and na
tionalistic view."
The war in Iraq and the war on
terror have played a large part in
shaping student views.
"I don't like how America en
tered the war," Wong said. "Bush
needed a clearer stance in his deci
sion to attack Iraq. I want to know
the facts about this war. What is the
state of terrorism right now?"
Despite their interest in the
American presidential elections,
many of the international students
have been turned off by the candi
dates' campaign methods and the
general working of the election sys
tem.
"I have always been interested in
politics since the 2000 elections
here," Krieger said. "However, since

Foreign students pick Kerry over Bush,
citing senator as the lesser of two evils

moving here, I've been turned off
from politics. There is absolutely no
political debate. Instead it is just
both sides constantly repeating their
points of view. Back home, we don't
vote fora party or candidate. We
vote based upon who is doing a bet
ter job."
Some students, though, said they
still admire the American political
system in spite of its flaws.
"It seems rather pointless that the
candidates spend nearly one year
campaigning when the terms are
only four years long," Kanoria said.
"It is interesting that America has a
debate system that allows for face to
face confrontation. It is symptomatic
of the transparency of American
democracy."
While many international stu
dents are not participating actively
in election campaigns or political
groups, they do watch the debates
and follow the news in the newspa
pers and online carefully.
"I tried watching three different
debates, but I left because I couldn't
stand them." Krieger said. "Instead I
go to Web sites and download what
they said. I wanted to hear intelli
gent exchanges at the debates."
Many also recognized the impact
the election will have on an interna
tional basis.
"As a superpower. America must
have a sense of responsibility to the
international community." Kanoria
said. "The president must under
stand how different nations can have
different opinions. What is most im
portant for the presidency is to know
what it means to be a global leader."

future stance in the world.
"The president needs to be more
cooperative with international orga
nizations and agencies,"
Schmitzberger said. "I think Ameri
ca needs less of a hard-line and na
tionalistic view."
The war in Iraq and the war on
terror have played a large part in
shaping student views.
"I don't like how America en
tered the war," Wong said. "Bush
needed a clearer stance in his deci
sion to attack Iraq. I want to know
the facts about this war. What is the
state of terrorism right now?"
Despite their interest in the
American presidential elections,
many of the international students
have been turned off by the candi
dates' campaign methods and the
general working of the election sys
tem.
"I have always been interested in
politics since the 2000 elections
here," Krieger said. "However, since

Foreign students pick Kerry over Bush,
citing senator as the lesser of two evils

moving here, I've been turned off
from politics. There is absolutely no
political debate. Instead it is just
both sides constantly repeating their
points of view. Back home, we don't
vote fora party or candidate. We
vote based upon who is doing a bet
ter job."
Some students, though, said they
still admire the American political
system in spite of its flaws.
"It seems rather pointless that the
candidates spend nearly one year
campaigning when the terms are
only four years long," Kanoria said.
"It is interesting that America has a
debate system that allows for face to
face confrontation. It is symptomatic
of the transparency of American
democracy."
While many international stu
dents are not participating actively
in election campaigns or political
groups, they do watch the debates
and follow the news in the newspa
pers and online carefully.
"I tried watching three different
debates, but I left because I couldn't
stand them." Krieger said. "Instead I
go to Web sites and download what
they said. I wanted to hear intelli
gent exchanges at the debates."
Many also recognized the impact
the election will have on an interna
tional basis.
"As a superpower. America must
have a sense of responsibility to the
international community." Kanoria
said. "The president must under
stand how different nations can have
different opinions. What is most im
portant for the presidency is to know
what it means to be a global leader."
As Election Day nears and most of America re
mains divided, many of Stanford's international under
graduates find neither Sen. John Kerry nor President
George W. Bush well-suited to the job of president.
However, reflecting what many perceive as negative
international sentiments against the Bush administra
tion, many said they would favor Kerry for president
over Bush.
"I find both candidates really uninspiring," said
freshman Mike Krieger. a Brazilian citizen. "Bush is a

more dangerous president, but Kerry is also not the
right man to lead America into the 21st century. In
Brazil, everyone would vote for Kerry because there is
an enormous amount of anti-American sentiment due
to Bush and his policies."
Sophomore Samvit Kanoria, who is from India, said
that people in his home country are paying close atten
tion to the upcoming election
"The upper-middle class has a great deal of interest
and are informed of world affairs," he said. "The busi-
ness community is worried most
about the potential bans Kerry could
put in place."
In Canada, according to fresh
man lan Wong, there is a lot of inter
est in the election due to the proxim
ity between Canada and the United
States and their shared cultures.
"So much of Canadian culture
has American culture in it so what
ever America does has a big impact
on Canada," he said. "Around my
circle of friends and family in Cana
da, they would choose Kerry over
Bush because they are against this
war in Iraq. I would say most of
Canada is against the war because
Canada usually takes on a peace
keeping role."
Freshman Florian Schmitzberger
of Austria also thinks people in his
country would support Kerry.
"The American elections make
the headline news every other day,"
he said. "Most of Austria I would say
is pro-Kerry, but that is most likely a
result of the strong anti-Bush policy.
No one really cares that much or
knows that much about Kerry."
While some international stu
dents actively engage in political de
bates, some felt reserved about par
ticipating in discussions of American
politics because of their back
grounds.
"I don't feel like 1 can say any
thing about the election or politics
here because it just seems sort of
wrong and out of place," Kricger
said. "There is an underlying as
sumption that because I am a for
eigner I don't know that much about
the politics here."
Despite the enormous national

media coverage the election has re
ceived in recent weeks, Krieger said
he felt the foreign press is able to
present a broader range of views
about the candidates.
"I think people abroad have
more information about the candi
dates than the Americans do be
cause the international people get
less filtered information and if they
are filtered, there are more diverse
sources and different filters," he
said.
Many international students said
that American voters are presented
little choice in terms of the candi
dates and their qualifications in the
national election.
"It's weird how America only has
two parties," Wong said. "In Canada
there are also two main parties, but
there is also a broader range of sig
nificant other parties and candidates
to choose from.
The qualities of the candidates in
this election do not present too much
choice to the voter. I doubt the abili
ty of Bush as a leader because of the
way he conducts himself. He's not
very professional."
Schmitzberger also said he thinks
Americans have limited options in
terms of their choice in president,
pointing out that in Austria, there
are four active parties and each have
chances to be elected into power.
"I hate the two party system be
cause it provides less of an option to
voters,"he said. "In this election,
voters must choose to vote Republi
can or less Republican.
People are urged to vote for the
main parties because voting fora
third party would hurt Democrats.

Since they would rather have a De
mocrat than a Republican, they vote
Democrat rather than the third
party."
Between the two candidates,
Kanoria said that he would choose
Kerry over Bush, though he saw
flaws in Kerry's economic plans.
"It seems that Kerry is more well
versed with the way the world
works," Kanoria said. "However, his
budget plans are ridiculous because
there is already a huge deficit. It
seems that he is offering more empty
promises in terms of the economy."
