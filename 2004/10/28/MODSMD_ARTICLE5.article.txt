# After three years, Yost still speaks English

Maria Tostado figured that living
in Yost House her junior year was a
no-brainer. She needed to brush up
on her Spanish and had heard that
the residence, comprised of about 60
students nestled in Governor's Cor
ner. was a Spanish immersion house.
But Tostado overlooked an im
portant detail: not all Yost residents
speak Spanish. For the past three
years. Yost has been a Spanish-lan
guage theme house. It is officially an
academic theme house, designed to
encourage awareness of Spanish lan
guage and culture by offering in
dorm programs for residents.

"It would be nice for everyone to
speak Spanish here," said Yost Res
ident Fellow Rosa Gonzalez. "One
of the goals is to make it where Span
ish is spoken 24-7."
While the staff encourages
awareness and use of Spanish in
everyday life, since half the residents
are not studying Spanish, the staff's
efforts often fall on deaf ears.
"In general, people don't really
speak Spanish." said senior Sarah
Field, who does not speak any Span
ish. "But it's a pretty good place to
live."
