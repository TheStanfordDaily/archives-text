# After three years, Yost still speaks English

Maria Tostado figured that living
in Yost House her junior year was a
no-brainer. She needed to brush up
on her Spanish and had heard that
the residence, comprised of about 60
students nestled in Governor's Cor
ner. was a Spanish immersion house.
But Tostado overlooked an im
portant detail: not all Yost residents
speak Spanish. For the past three
years. Yost has been a Spanish-lan
guage theme house. It is officially an
academic theme house, designed to
encourage awareness of Spanish lan
guage and culture by offering in
dorm programs for residents.

"It would be nice for everyone to
speak Spanish here," said Yost Res
ident Fellow Rosa Gonzalez. "One
of the goals is to make it where Span
ish is spoken 24-7."
While the staff encourages
awareness and use of Spanish in
everyday life, since half the residents
are not studying Spanish, the staff's
efforts often fall on deaf ears.
"In general, people don't really
speak Spanish." said senior Sarah
Field, who does not speak any Span
ish. "But it's a pretty good place to
live."

perience of Field and others, though
not the intended goal of the Spanish
language theme, is not viewed as a
failure by Gonzalez.
"My number-one priority is to
make sure that all of the residents
feel that this is their community."
she said. "My number-two goal is to
do everything in my power to get
them to speak Spanish."
Inside the dorm, nametags that
read "Yostitos" grace residents'
doors and nearly all the objects are la
beled in Spanish. In addition, stu
dents can find weekly vocabulary
words on the bulletin boards, watch
movies in Spanish tin Sundays or sit at
the Spanish-speaking table at lunch.
According to Gonzalez, immer
sion at Yost is not found in the ab
sence of Hnelish, but rather in the

Dorm focuses
on culture

presentation of Spanish though an
array of visual and audio mediums.
Residents and staff of Yost say
they are aware of the limitations of
the theme.
"Some people would say it is only
successful if the majority of the peo
ple are really into it and speak Span
ish all the time," Gonzalez said. "But
this is an academic theme house. It is
a community where students can
speak and practice."
Tostado agreed that the Yost
House program is successful despite
its shortcomings.
"We do manage to work in a fair
amount of Spanish language and cul
ture," while day-to-day life remains
normal, she said. "What we lack in
speaking Spanish we make up for in
cultural awareness." she said.
