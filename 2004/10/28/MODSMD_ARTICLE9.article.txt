1964 — On Oct. 28, The Daily ran a
story about students forming a group
to support President Lyndon John
son 's re-election. Below is an excerpt:
"A 'Southerners for Johnson'
committee has been organized on
the mid-peninsula by two Stanford
students to campaign for the presi
dent's re-election, fight Proposition
14, and to combat the South s white
supremacist image.
Serving as organizers and co
chairmen of the group are John
Rosenberg, a history student from
Alabama, and Robert Canzoneri, a
southern college professor from
Mississippi now on a study grant
given by the English department.
Members of the organization in
clude Professors George Sens
abaugh of Texas, John Loftis of
Georgia, and Claude Simpson of
Texas, all members of the English
department, and more than 40 stu
dents representing all the states
south of the Mason-Dixon Line.
Calling for the support of all their
fellow Southerners, the group urges
the election of Johnson and
Humphrey.
As their statement said: 'We be
lieve that because of our particular
background we are able to recognize
in Senator Goldwater'j; platform
and public statements many of the
same policies which have legalized
inhumanity, promoted social up
heaval, and retained economic pri
vation in the South.'"

1987 — On Oct. 28, The Daily ran a
story about the ASSU requesting re
forms to the curriculum for Western
Culture, the predecessor of CIV and
then /HUM. Below is an excerpt:
"The ASSU Senate last night
urged the Western Culture Task
Force to amend its recently released
proposal for changes in the Univer
sity's Western Culture requirement.
Since the Western Culture pro
gram was reinstituted in 1980, critics
have argued that the program does
not adequately address the contribu
tions of women, minorities and non-
Western cultures. In 1985 the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Students
established the Western Culture Task
Force, which was charged with study
ing this problem and recommending
changes in the University's Area One
(Western Culture) requirement.
The senate last night voted to
support amendments to the task
force's recommendations that have
been proposed by the Black Stu
dent Union. MEChA (a Chicano
student group), the Stanford
American Indian Organization, the
Asian American Student Associa
tion and Students United for
Democracy in Education.
The amendments presented by
the minority groups recommend
that Western Culture classes be re
quired to include the study of an
equal proportion of European and
non-European works.
