A couple of better breaks last week in their games against Oregon and Arizona State, and Stanford (4-3, 2-2) and
UCLA (4-3, 2-2) are playing fora sixth win and bowl eligibility tomorrow. Instead, both teams are still looking for
their fifth win and face equally daunting schedules the rest of the season. Tomorrow is not a must-win game for either
team in the literal sense of the term, but to be honest, it's pretty darn close. Here are three key matchups to watch:
£1 Stanford PK Michael Sgroi vs. UCLA PK Justin Medlock
Tomorrow's game doesn't figure to be a defensive struggle, but should the
game come down to a crucial kick, either one of these kickers could be the hero.
Medlock is a perfect nine-for-nine this season, including five field goals of 40
yards or longer. Sgroi, whose heartbreaking last-second miss against Oregon
most likely would have been good if not for the soggy conditions at Stanford
Stadium, has enjoyed a solid season as well, connecting on 11 -of-16 kicks. Prior
to his two misses in four attempts last week, Sgroi had connected on nine
straight attempts.

Stanford D-Line vs. UCLA RB Maurice Drew
After not allowing a single rusher to top 1 (X) yards in its first five games, Stan
ford gave up 131 to Terrence Whitehead last week. The going doesn't get any
easier against the Bruins' Maurice Drew. The super sophomore is averaging
112.4 yards per game and an early-season-J.R.-Lemon-esque 6.6 yards per
carry. He's also scored eight touchdowns this season. Stanford limited Drew
to 65 yards on 17 carries in the Cardinal's 21-14 victory last season, but there's
no question they'll see a different, more experienced back tomorrow.

The normally staunch Cardinal offensive line was porous last week
end against the Ducks, allowing a season-high 10 sacks. Sophomore
quarterback Trent Edwards has many strengths, but throwing while
on his back or with his face planted in the ground is not one of them.
While redshirt freshman T.C. Ostrander performed admirably in re
lief against Oregon, Stanford is a better team with Edwards on the
field. Look for the sophomore-ladtjn line to bounce back and keep
Edwards on his feet against a Bruins team that has a mere eight
sacks this season.

end against the Ducks, allowing a season-high 10 sacks. Sophomore
quarterback Trent Edwards has many strengths, but throwing while
on his back or with his face planted in the ground is not one of them.
While redshirt freshman T.C. Ostrander performed admirably in re
lief against Oregon, Stanford is a better team with Edwards on the
field. Look for the sophomore-ladtjn line to bounce back and keep
Edwards on his feet against a Bruins team that has a mere eight
sacks this season.

A couple of better breaks last week in their games against Oregon and Arizona State, and Stanford (4-3, 2-2) and
UCLA (4-3, 2-2) are playing fora sixth win and bowl eligibility tomorrow. Instead, both teams are still looking for
their fifth win and face equally daunting schedules the rest of the season. Tomorrow is not a must-win game for either
team in the literal sense of the term, but to be honest, it's pretty darn close. Here are three key matchups to watch:
£1 Stanford PK Michael Sgroi vs. UCLA PK Justin Medlock
Tomorrow's game doesn't figure to be a defensive struggle, but should the
game come down to a crucial kick, either one of these kickers could be the hero.
Medlock is a perfect nine-for-nine this season, including five field goals of 40
yards or longer. Sgroi, whose heartbreaking last-second miss against Oregon
most likely would have been good if not for the soggy conditions at Stanford
Stadium, has enjoyed a solid season as well, connecting on 11 -of-16 kicks. Prior
to his two misses in four attempts last week, Sgroi had connected on nine
straight attempts.

Stanford D-Line vs. UCLA RB Maurice Drew
After not allowing a single rusher to top 1 (X) yards in its first five games, Stan
ford gave up 131 to Terrence Whitehead last week. The going doesn't get any
easier against the Bruins' Maurice Drew. The super sophomore is averaging
112.4 yards per game and an early-season-J.R.-Lemon-esque 6.6 yards per
carry. He's also scored eight touchdowns this season. Stanford limited Drew
to 65 yards on 17 carries in the Cardinal's 21-14 victory last season, but there's
no question they'll see a different, more experienced back tomorrow.
