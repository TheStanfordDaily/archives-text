"I have always known Bill to have
the best interests of students in
mind when he worked for change
for our children in Palo Alto, or in
Sacramento with the California
Board of Education, or in
Washington D.C. Bill doesn't mind
challenging the status quo when
such questions are needed. Me is
committed to high academic
standards for students and
teachers, accountability, and a
world class curriculum that will
make all of our students competitive
with the best students anywhere.
Silicon Valley needs the best that
our schools can provide, and Bill
Evers has the vision and has shown
the dedication to make that
happen."
