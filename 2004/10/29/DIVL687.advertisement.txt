How Does Recycling Work?
There are three parts to the recycling process, each one essential to
making the system work: collection, manufacturing and buying. These
three components are so important that they are represented by the
three "chasing arrows" of the recycling logo.
Collection-
Don't Send Recyclable To The Landfill. In this phase, materials are sepa
rated from the waste stream and prepared to become raw materials. At
Stanford, we collect recyclables through the campus recycling program
and the public drop off center. Once collected, we sort the material on
campus into various categories.
Manufacturing - Using Recycled Materials Instead Of Virgin Raw Materials. Recovering the materials is
just the first step. There must also be a market for it - companies that want the materials and are able to
remanufacture them into consumer products. Sometimes these companies have to invest a significant
amount of money in adapting their manufacturing processes to accommodate the use of recycled materi
als in their products.
Buying - "Close The Loop" By Buying Products With Recycled Content. In order to make recycling eco
nomically viable, there must be a market for recycled products. If people buy them, companies will be
encouraged to make them, and the whole system works.
