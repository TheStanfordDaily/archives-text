the "wild tfecie
Faraway and faint the wild goose gives his cry.
Since then my thoughts have been fixed on the
middle of the sky.

This Sunday families with young children from around the Peninsula gather to
paint small pumpkins outfitted with tea candles to light the way for autumn
sojourners. Every week the Humanist Community's Family Assembly convenes to
talk about their lives, sing songs, and read a picture book that provokes thought
about living a caring and productive lite. This week's story tells about two best
friends who must face a large separation. The theme question that flows from this is,
"How can we work through life's changes and receive the surprises this brings?"
Families committed to building a more humane world are invited to participate
in this program which is designed to make that goal more real in everyday life.
Whether learning to share a paint brush, patiently waiting tor seeds to sprout,
or collecting canned food for the hungry, the focus remains the same: Exploring
how to help create a more livable world for all. In the process lasting
friendships are made.
The Family Assembly gathers from 10:45 AM to 12:15 PM
at the Mitchell Park Community Center
3800 Middlefield Road, near Charleston, in Palo Alto.
Lois Kellerman, Ethical Culture Leader, sets the tone by laying foundations fora
moral worldview to last a lifetime.
