# BEAR HUNTING DOWN SOUTH
## Card hit the road in search of fifth win 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a key Pacific-10 Conference game, Stanford will
battle UCLA tomorrow at the Rose Bowl. The schools
are an identical 4-3 overall and 2-2 in the Pac-10, and
the contest is likely pivotal for each team's howl-eligi
bility hopes.
The Bruins have not lost to an unranked team all
season and rank third in the Pac-10 in scoring (33.1
points per game). They've scored 20 or more points in
every game this season and have gone over 30 points
five times.
Stanford, in other words, will probably need to bring
its offense.
And, as the Bruins' defense ranks ninth (28.4 points
per game) in the Pac-10, the Cardinal believes it will be
able to exploit a variety of UCLA weaknesses.
On the other side of the ball, the Bruins' strength —
the ground game — is also a strength of the staunch
Stanford defense. UCLA ranks second in the Pac-10 in
rushing offense (213.7 yards per game), while Stanford
ranks fourth in rushing defense (117.4 yards per game).
And, while Stanford ranks ninth in passing defense (235
yards per game), the Bruins rank just eighth in passing
offense (235 yards per game).
In other words, Stanford's key strengths play to
UCLA's strengths, and its key weaknesses to the Bru
ins' weaknesses.
Both teams, though, have had a weakness late in
ballgames. The Bruins blew an 11-point fourth-quarter
lead last week against No. 21 Arizona State, while Stan
ford has seen second-half leads evaporate against No. 1
Southern California, Notre Dame and Oregon.
"You have to learn how to finish a game," said UCLA
head coach Karl Dorrell. "That is a learning process for
younger players and, in some cases, for older players who
haven't been in those situations before."
Despite its loss last to Oregon last weekend, Stan
ford did play well in the second half, scoring as many
points as the Ducks (13).
"Guys at the half responded offensively," said Stan
ford head coach Buddy Teevens. "We struggled a little
bit early on with physical size and the athleticism of
their defensive front, but we played better in the second
half, which is not what we've done up until this point."
With Trent Edwards expected to be back at quarter
back this week, Stanford should have some success
against UCLA's sixth-ranked pass defense. However,
since the Bruins rank last in the Pac-10 in rushing de
fense (allowing 237.3 yards per game) the Cardinal will
probably call the numbers of tailbacks J.R. Lemon and
Kenneth Tolon more often than usual.
UCLA will rely on the Pac-10's second-leading rush
er, Maurice Drew, who averages 112.4 yards per game
and an impressive 6.6 yards per carry and has scored

eight touchdowns. That's
not all, though — backup
Manuel White Jr. chips in
76.1 yards per game and has
scored four times.
"They have a big physi
cal guy with White and a
powerful running back in
Drew," Teevens said. "He's
low to the ground, real
strong with his legs, a tackle
breaker and has speed to
break the distance. So,
there's danger in a lot of dif
ferent areas."
Junior quarterback
Drew Olson has played well
in recent weeks after a slow
start to the year, averaging
228.3 yards per game for the
season with 14 touchdowns,
although he's been inter
cepted nine teams, includ
ing four last week. Olson
has completed a solid 59.1
percent of his passes, so
Dorrell isn't worried about
last week's four picks.
"He knew right after he
threw [them]," Dorrell said.
"That is the sign of a guy
who is mature. A sign of a
guy who really understands

the process of what he's doing in directing an offense ..
. He shows that type of resolve as a player to just get re
focused and do great things."
Olson's key targets are Marcedes Lewis, who's
caught 23 passes for 280 yards and six touchdowns, and
Tab Ferry, who has 19 catches for 190 yards. Out of the
hackfield. White and Drew have combined for 27

catches for 321 yards and two touchdowns.
Stanford knows what to expect — lots and lots of ac
tion out of the backfield.
"They don't run a lot of different plays," Teevens
said. "They run a zone play and can block as well as any
body I've seen, and they will run it and run it and run it."
The Bruins' defense is led by Pac-10 leading tackier
Spencer Havner, who averages 11.7 tackles per game at
linebacker and has a team-high 5.5 tackles fora loss.

Safeties Ben Emanuel and Jarod Page are next in line,
averaging eight and seven tackles, respectively.
They may give up a lot of points, but Teevens is
impressed by some of what he sees from the UCLA
defenders.
"They're young, but they fly around, they play hard,
they play physically, they play with enthusiasm," he said.

"Obviously, they've been in a lot of ball games with their
offense, and they're great contributors to it. People say
they're not a real good defensive unit, but I dispute that.
They're making plays and improving week to week."
Edwards has thrown for 203.3 yards per game this
year, a figure that was hurt by his early exit from last
week's game with a bruised shoulder and hand. He's
tossed eight touchdowns and five interceptions, com
pleting 56.2 percent of his passes. Should he be knocked

out, Ryan Eklund (l-of-3, 24
yards this year) and T.C. Os
trander (23-of-40,358 yards, one
touchdown) will relieve, in that
order.
His leading receiver is se
nior tight end Alex Smith, who
caught nine passes for 110 yards
last week, both career highs. He
has 34 catches for 396 yards and
a touchdown this season.
Other targets include 6-
foot-7 Evan Moore (27 catches,
441 yards, five touchdowns), 6-
foot-4 Justin McCullum (23
catches, 329 yards, one touch
down) and 6-foot-2 Mark Brad
ford (25 catches, 358 yards).
Tolon is averaging 42.1 yards
per game this year on 4.3 yards
per carry, scoring twice. Lemon
leads the team with 61 yards per
game, 5.1 yards per carry and six
touchdowns.
Stanford's offense has
bogged down at times this sea
son, and Teevens hopes the
UCLA game can be a turning
point.
"We've been inconsistent,"
Teevens said. "It's here today
and gone the next snap. We
need to be consistent. All par
ties are responsible. We have to

come off the football thoroughly with the front line. We
need to see what is there and take advantage of the op
portunity that presents itself."
Tomorrow, Stanford has an opportunity to take a big
stip toward bowl eligibility against one of the two un
ranked teams remaining on its schedule. Kickoffisat 12:30
p.m., and the game will be televised on Fox Sports Net.

Senior running back J.R. Lemon looks for daylight in Stanford's 16-13 loss to Oregon last Saturday. Lemon and
fellow senior Kenneth Tolon could be the focal point of the Cardinal offense tomorrow at UCLA. The Bruins have
the Pac-10's worst rushing defense.
