# Full Moon fun not Absolute, but close
## 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ 
Students at Wednesday's Full
Moon on the Quad — the annual
lip-locking event under the moon
light — said that this year's event
was a fun, safe and well-organized
event, despite earlier concerns
from some that the event would be
toned down from those of past
years. Absolute Fun, a program
created last year that sponsors al
cohol-free social events on cam
pus, joined the sophomore, junior
and senior class presidents and the
ASSU in organizing the event.
Among the thousands gathered
were those who were bundled up
for the 43-degree night and others
who wore nothing at all; those who
were taking shots of Listerine and
others who were drinking alcohol
from water bottles; and those who
were getting busy and others who
were there for the live music and
performances.
"This event is so much fun,"
said sophomore Rebecca Pratt.
"It's a great to see everyone getting
together and having a good time."
Associate Dean of Students and
Office of Student Activities Direc
tor Nancy Howe said that there
were only two incidents of intoxi
cation that required "emergency
responses," down from five last

year.
Howe said that she felt the
numbers alone did not accurately
reflect the extent to which Full
Moon improved this year over last.
She credited the event's student
organizers as well as residential
staff members for the change in
"tone."
"I felt that the overall tone of
the event of the people there was
much more to have a good time,
and it was a huge improvement,"
she said. "Last year we had many
people that we didn't have police
responses to but that we were still
worried about their level of intoxi
cation."
Howe said that more money
was spent this year on entertain
ment and lighting, although she
could not provide the exact figures
for those expenses.
At 11 p.m., nearly 3,000 stu
dents poured into the Main Quad
to watch belly dancing and to listen
to live music from Chris Ayer, In
phanyte records and the Institute
for the Advancement of Funk and
Soul. Students danced to cover
songs like the Ohio Players'
"Rollercoaster of Love" and the
Institute for the Advancement of
Funk and Soul's original, "We're
Getting on Down (and We're
Fucking)."

"Basically what we were look
ing to do was get the people to get
it on, to get on down, and to groove
to some tasty beats as we did it to
them in their ear holes," said Insti
tute for the Advancement of Funk
and Soul band leader and sopho
more Baiju Bhatt.
Streakers circled the perfor
mance stage and danced to these
tunes along with the ever-vivacious
Stanford Band. One streaker,
sophomore Josh Weiner, said that
the live music was a great comple
ment to Full Moon on the Quad.
"I'm feeling a good rhythm with
this music, the good rhythm of hu
manity as people are enjoying it,"
Weiner said.
One Stanford Band member,
nicknamed "Line," was seen driv
ing around in the Band's
"Badonkadonk" wearing a helmet
topped with wire prongs that had
flames rising from each tip.
"It's crazy fun, but it's been all
been one big blur since I've been so
distracted with driving and the
flames from my helmet," Line said.
As midnight neared, nervous
freshmen began searching for the
senior lips that would seal their
Cardinal initiation with a kiss.

The Institute for the Advancement of Funk and Soul was one of three bands that performed at Full Moon on the Quad
on Wednesday night.
of Funk and Soul counted down the
seconds to midnight.
Many young women were lining
up to smooch with the Tree.
"I think he's going to break last
year's record of 681 kisses," said for
mer tree and senior William
Rothacker.
While many felt that this year's
Full Moon on the Quad retained its
traditional liveliness, students and
organizers also said that the event
was better-planned due to the col
laboration of Absolute Fun and
ASSIJ.
"This year. Full Moon seems
much more organized," said sopho
more Wing Yung.
"In the past, having some music
was considered exceptional," said
senior Joey Natoli, who is in charge
of Absolute Fun. "So by offering dif
ferent types of music, we really tried
to help make the event as inclusive
as possible."
Tarot card readers, contortionists
and henna artists were also present.

There were also 50 "sober moni
tors" on hand who provided health
resources, said event coordinator
Tania Juarez, a sophomore. These
student volunteers were enlisted to
help keep an eye on others if they
became dangerously intoxicated.
One of the monitors, sophomore
Lucia Rodriguez, said that her role
was to provide intoxicated students
with assistance until further help ar
rived. However, when she spoke
with The Daily around 1 a.m., Ro
driguez said she had not yet seen any
students who were "out of hand."
Organizers, including peer health
educators, also provided condoms
and mouthwash to students. In addi
tion, members of tne Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center led their own
effort to pass out condoms, stickers,
candy and water.
"Full moon is a great publicity
opportunity for us," said senior
James Poole, who worked the
SHPRC booth. "It gives us a chance
to hand stuff out while letting others

know about this center."
Nine security officers, three of
whom were deputies, were on hand
as a safety precaution, Juarez said,
and signs warned against the use of
cameras, the presence of alcohol and
showing up without an SUID.
Despite all of these precautions,
freshman Amparo Vazquez felt
more security was needed to oversee
the large body of students.
"I had to help lead my friends
through the crowd so that we could
all stay together," Vazquez said. "A
lot of people were bumping into us,
and I'm sure someone could have
been hurt."
While many students enjoyed the
festivities, others felt somewhat
alienated by the atmosphere.
"It can be off-putting, having a
naked girl squeeze your stomach,"
said sophomore Matt Smith. "Ev
eryone's definitely friendly, but
there seems to be a little bit of shal
lowness to it all."

Safety doesn't eclipse fun
