# Voting limo reaches red light
## 
### BRIDGET CAREY INDEPENDENT FLORIDA ALLIGATOR (U. FLORIDA 
(U-WIRE) GAINESVILLE,
Fla. — Chomp the Vote's limousine.
Early Voting Express, has been
chomped to an early end.
Wednesday was the last day for
students to hop aboard a Student
Government-funded limousine that
transported them from the Reitz
Union to the Alachua County Su
pervisor of Elections Office to vote
early for Tuesday's elections. It ran
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
The limousine service hauled an
average of 60 students a day to and
from the polls since Oct. 20. but the
student turnout was not great
enough to make it worth continuing
the service, SCi lobby director
Robert Mack said.
"It's not the fact that it wasn't

good enough," Mack said of the
limousine service. "We just felt that
it ended up working out to be over $2
a student, and we at least wanted it
to be a little over a dollar a student."
If the limousine service was filled
to capacity — including today —+
about 9(X) students could have used
the service, which would have aver
aged out to a cost of 75 cents per stu
dent rider. Mack said.
So far, nearly 300 students have
voted early using the limousine
transportation, he said.
"Even if we got 70 to 80 students
a day, we would have definitely kept
it," Mack said.
The early end to the service
leaves SG with a bill of about $915,
Mack said. If the program continued
as scheduled until Nov. 1, it would
have cost an estimated $1,290.
With the limousine's end. Chomp
the Vote, along with the SG Lobby

Agency, is turning its early voting at
tention to an "Early Voting Extrav
aganza" on Thursday, which trans
ports students to the elections office
via a Regional Transit System bus
from 11:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
The RTS bus service, costing
$365.40, also will take students to the
Downtown Plaza from Turlington
Plaza.
The Thursday event, which fea
tures music and free food, carries an es
timated price tag of $5,000, Mack said.
Chomp the Vote Executive Di
rector Jared Hernandez emphasized
the importance of student involve
ment in politics.
"This election is an election that
will have echoes on our entire life,"
Hernandez said. "I think that Thurs
day's event will be an indication of
student participation and will show
how serious the student body is in
participating in civic life."
