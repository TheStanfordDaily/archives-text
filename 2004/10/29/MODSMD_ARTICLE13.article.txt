# Touching Tongues
## A
						dirty whore on the Quad 
### 
In order to preserve some sem
blance of a self-image, from the
first day of classes here at Huge
Loser University, you have defined
yourself as the antithesis of the bike
helmet-wearing Napoleon Dyna
mite in your (read: Erin's) physics
section.
Whatever respect you've gained
for the mastery of the oboe concer
tos of Dmitri Shostakovich, howev
er much you've begun to regard
chess as a sport, however many of
your friends went to Math Camp
and however much you've begun to
find Walter Cronkite attractive for
his journalistic integrity, you're still
two or three steps ahead of the true
nerdery embodied by helmet boy
and his neon yellow protective
pants-leg-tightening ... thingy.
Then Full
Moon on the
pens, and you I
make out with I 1 M -1
him, every sin- I
concerned
Cronkite im
personator, all tP*
of whom prob
ably went to ... . .
Math Camp. Enn loshmts and
This chronic Mary Stone
debasement of every Stanford stu
dent's self esteem is just one of the
many up-sides to Full Moon, and all
of it is in good old fashioned STD
spreading fun.
Your columnists truly believe
that the University-sponsored slut
fest is great fora multitude of rea
sons, and if Full Moon on the Quad
were a person, we would make out
with it on Full Moon, and perhaps
on other occasions, too.
Why? As we mentioned above.
Full Moon on the Quad is an equal
opportunity event, and while the
collision of your academic and social
worlds can at first invoke a psycho
logical breakdown, we think those
are pretty funny, especially if they
happen in public.
Plus, the general chaos that en
sues on the following morning when
every person on campus tries to
avoid eye contact results in a higher
frequency of bike accidents. We saw
somebody fall over one of the polit
ical tables in White Plaza. The
Young Republican in the suit was
really angry and threatened to shut
down a soup kitchen.
Another wonderful aspect of Full
Moon is that if you didn't break up
with your special lady / man friend
in anticipation, the aftermath has by
now cleft your relationship in twain
like an ancient Turkish scimitar.
And if you don't break up, you
might have to get married, and you
already know how we feel about
that.
There's also that moment of hes
itation, found only at Full Moon fes
tivities, that brings tears of joy to
your columnists' eyes. That moment
right before you dove into the sea of
body-painted hippies, dirty, dirty
grad students, and tongues, so many
tongues!
You thought of mononucleosis,
herpes simplex (both types) and
even the more implausible ones like
gonorrhea and pelvic inflammatory
disease (it's virtually impossible to
detect!). No matter how many pulls
from the handle of Potter's Vodka
the frat-boy welcoming committee
made you take, you just couldn't
overcome your repulsion.
But then some short kid with
acne grabbed your waist and shoved
his tongue down your throat and you
were off, into a Technicolor saliva
dream. The ability to triumph over
that moment of hesitation is what
separates us from those nerds at
Harvard.
Full Moon on the Quad provides
Hennessy's minions with the oppor
tunity to get frisky, or at the very
least learn what the hell frisky
means. It also allowed Erin to make
out with the Tree so many times that
her forehead was too full of Sharpie
tally-marks for Mary to continue
recording. And that, my friends, is
the true essence of Leland Stanford
Jr. University.
