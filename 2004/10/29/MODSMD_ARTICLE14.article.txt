# Continuing a tradition... Students kiss and tell under the moonlight
## 
### TAM VO INTERMISSION EDITOR 
Armed with a flashlight, a notepad, red lipstick and Eclipse spearmint gum, I was more than ready for my third Full
Moon on the Quad. I'd studied the 13 more unusual types of kisses (What the hell is a "vacuum kiss?"), I'd researched Full
Moons of yore — I'd even spent extra time perfecting my outfit. In retrospect, combining my red embroidered Chinese
dress with high slits, fishnet stockings and black Converse sneakers was one of the most dangerous things I could have
done — I became a target for anyone with an Asian fetish. Much to their dismay, I wasn't kissing anyone that night.
I was on a mission: Had Absolute Fun turned Full Moon into something that our parents would approve of? Would the
founders of this hallowed Stanford tradition applaud the overall sobriety and restraint of its participants? More students
should have taken advantage of the one night of the year where it's quantity, not quality, that counts. A dozen of those
smart enough to seize the rare opportunity weigh in on getting some under the full moon.

The Band Always Wins
