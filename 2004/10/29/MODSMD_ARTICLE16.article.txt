## Editorial Clarify Fundamental Standard 
### 
Unless they've gotten in trouble, most stu
dents probably are not familiar with the
Fundamental Standard. Freshman RAs
mention it at the first house meeting — and that is
about it.
However, the Fundamental Standard can be ap
plied to many different cases even though it is not
clearly defined. To ensure a more transparent and eq
uitable legal system, the University needs to reexam
ine the role of the Fundamental Standard and add
more formal definitions of what precisely constitute
offenses.
The official Fundamental Standard is only two
sentences long.
It states, "Students at Stanford are expected to
show both within and without the University such re
spect for order, morality, personal honor and the
rights of others as is demanded of good citizens. Fail
ure to do this will be sufficient cause for removal from
the University."
In spite of the short length and ambiguous mean
ing of highly abstract terms, the Judicial Panel applies
the Fundamental Standard to a number of offenses
including assault, theft, property damage, forgery,
sexual harassment, driving under the influence of
drugs or alcohol and illegal file-sharing.
Many of these violations do deserve some form of
punishment, but that does not mean that the Judicial
Panel should base the decision on tenuous ground.
The legal codes that are used for enforcement in
counties, states and at the federal level are much
clearer than Stanford's Fundamental Standard. They
spell out as specifically as possible the definition of
each crime and the punishment such a crime deserves.
Although the law is not perfect, it is designed in
keeping with some of this nation's core values — that
there should be a systematic method of dealing with
justice and that nobody should be punished by a law
they did not know about or that was not law before
the violation.
It seems that the Fundamental Standard is deliber
ately intended to be vague and ambiguous to avoid
legal definitions, allowing the Judicial Panel to make
decisions on an ad hoc basis. That may be convenient
for judicial officers, but ambiguity does not make for
a just legal code.
According to Vice Provost for Student Affairs,
Gene Awakuni, the Fundamental Standard is open to
interpretation.
He said that some might interpret the Fundamen
tal Standard as the "Golden Rule." Others might be

lieve it means obeying the law of the United States as
well as all University policies, and others might say it
means acting with integrity in all personal, academic
and professional interactions.
That there are so many potential versions of the
Fundamental Standard should be a cause of concern.
The United States is a nation that believes in blind
justice. How can such an ideal be realized at Stanford
if the rules and violations are so open to interpreta
tion depending on each case?
Even more disconcerting is that Fundamental
Standard cases can result in harsh consequences.
In addition to any other punishments, those guilty
of a Fundamental Standard violation have it placed
on their permanent record, although not on their
transcript.
Should graduate schools or future employers re
quest the information, students may be compelled to
release their permenant record and explain the Fun
damental Standard violation.
For some violations, this punishment may be appro
priate, but for cases where the offense was not as egre
gious, care must be taken — especially when it comes to
file-sharing, an area where Stanford's policy recently
changed and where federal law is just now developing.
The Judicial Panel could remedy the Fundamental
Standard by adding to and clarifying Stanford's exist
ing policies. Although the Fundemental Standard is
short, information on the Internet gives more details
on various rules and policies.
Since many basic elements are already fleshed out,
the Judicial Panel could use well-defined policies in
judicial cases without needing to invoke the Funda
mental Standard.
If the Judicial Panel has to rely on the Fundamen
tal Standard, then the rules are not adequately de
fined, and they should be lengthened and qualified so
vague notions of "respect for order, morality, [and]
personal honor" do not have as far reaching an im
pact. Such abstract terms can be interpretted in any
manner that the arbiter sees fit, and that is not justice.
Stanford has had the Fundamental Standard since
1896, and many peer institutions have similar policies
— some that are even more harsh. However, one
should be wary of arguments based on the status quo.
The way things are does not dictate the way things
should be.
As a progressive institution, Stanford has been a
trend-setter when it comes to other arenas, and
Stanford should continue to be a leader by remov
ing ambiguities from its own judicial process.
