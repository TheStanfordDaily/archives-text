## Bush is a disaster for foreign relations 
### PHILIP ZIMBARDO 
Having completed a lecture tour
in New Zealand, Poland, Italy and
Sicily, 1 wanted to share with Stan
ford students a view that was
prevalent among all the students,
colleagues and ordinary town folks
who attended my talks or I met in
cafes and restaurants.
In large cities and small towns,
the consensus was that they feared
President George W. Bush more
than any terrorists because of the
power he wields and the apparent
disdain of his administration for
true alliances overseas. They are
focused on the Tuesday election
with greater fervor than on any
past American election for its po
tential global consequences.
Those informal opinions of
these "persons in the streets and in

the seats" conforms with recent
polls by Public Agenda, a nonparti
san opinion research organization,
and with large scale surveys by the
Pew Global Attitudes Project.
They show that 87 percent of
Muslims do not approve of Presi
dent Bush; more than 70 percent of
people in Muslim countries worry
about a military threat from the
United States; and the majority of
them believe that Iraq is worse off
now than before the toppling of
Saddam Hussein.
In Europe, among our tradition
al allies, many now consider the
United States to be a threat to
world peace: 88 percent of Greeks,
63 percent of Dutch, 55 percent of
British and 52 percent of French.
Our friends overseas believe
that since Sept. 11, the United
States has been acting solely in its

own interests and not considering
the interests of its allies: 85 percent
of Germans, 80 percent of French,
73 percent of British, and 68 per
cent of Italians.
A final item to consider is the
summary conclusion from the Pew
Project that the war in Iraq has fur
ther inflamed the Muslim world,
and it has widened the rift between
our country and Western Europe.
Just some more data for you to
factor into your voting decision on
Tuesday. This is the most impor
tant election in my long lifetime,
and may prove to be so in your life
times, so please vote your con
science, and get your friends and
family to also vote.
