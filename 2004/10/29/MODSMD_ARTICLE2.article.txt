# UCLA hopes to avoid yet another late-season plunge

As Stanford knows, losing the close ones hurts ... a
lot. UCLA, the Cardinal's opponent tomorrow, learned
that lesson as well, falling to Arizona State, 48-42, in a
wild shootout at Sun Devil Stadium on Saturday.
The loss to ASU was a bump in the road fora team that
has shown enormous potential. Many experts predicted
UCLA would finish near the bottom of the Pac-10, but
the Bruins have isntead marched to a 4-3 record.
This isn't that surprising considering that UCLA re
turned all of its key offensive starters and has one of the
most talented linebackers in the country in junior Spencer
Havner.
Despite returning 15 of 22 starters. Bruins head coach
Karl Dorrell insists that this team is different than the one
that lost five straight to close out the 2003 season.
"I'm happy with this team because it is no where close
to last year's team," Dorrell said. "It is a totally different
makeup and a totally different mindset. The character of
this team is unbelievable."
Last season UCLA struggled down the stretch. After
winning six of their first eight games, the Bruins closed the
season on a five-game losing streak. The tailspin began
with a 21-14 loss to Stanford and ended in an embarrass
ing loss to Fresno State in the Silicon Valley Bowl.
The collapse at the end of last year prompted voters in
the preseason Pac-10 media poll to pick UCLA to finish
seventh, behind the likes of Oregon State and Washing
ton.
In 2004 the Bruins came out of the gate hot, picking up
victories in four of their first five games, including two
wins to open the Pac-10 season.
The most impressive win of the season for UCLA
came on the road against Big 10 opponent Illinois.
That win came after an opening-weekend loss to Okla
homa State, as the Bruins went on the road and scored on
their first two possessions of the game. They never sur
rendered the early lead, winning 35-17. The offensive, de
fensive and special teams units all played major parts in
the victory.
Starting sophomore tailback Maurice Drew rushed for
142 yards, while the defense forced three turnovers, and
the special teams unit blocked two kicks.
Havner had his breakout game against the Illini, tally
ing 17 tackles, the most by any UCLA player since 2001.
Havner has had a tremendous year for the Bruins, with
82 total tackles in his seven starts, good enough for first in
tackles per game in the Pac-10 and fifth in the nation. He
was also recently named a finalist for both the Butkus
Award and the Rotary Lonibardi Award, which honor

After limiting the effectiveness of Oregon's Kellen Clemens
last week, Oshiomogho Atogwe and the rest of the Cardi
nal defense must contend with UCLA's potent offense.
the nation's best linebacker and lineman, re
spectively.
After picking up the win against Illinois,
UCLA reeled off three more victories over
Washington, San Diego State and Arizona.
But after the quick start, UCLA faced its
toughest stretch of the season, traveling to both
Cal and Arizona State. The ranked teams swept
the Bruins, with Cal defeating UCLA 45-28 be
fore ASU handed them last weekend's tough
loss.
With the Bruins leading in the fourth quar
ter, Arizona State senior quarterback Andrew
Walter led the Sun Devils all the way back with
two late touchdown passes.
"With seven minutes left we were up 42-31
and in pretty good position for an opportunity
to win the football game, and we didn't," Dor
rell said. "We didn't finish. We were competi
tive and played hard and did all the things you
need to do. But you need to learn how to finish."
Dorrell and his team are still optimistic about
the rest of the season.
"There is a lot to build from this past week,"
he said. "Our kids are not moping around. The
coaches are not moping around. We are all ex
cited about the opportunity this week. We fell
off the horse on Saturday and we jumped right
back on it Sunday afternoon."
It's hard not to believe in this UCLA team
that showed such potential at the beginning of
the year.
"We are at the point now where we know
what we are capable of doing," Dorrell said.
"We are closer and closer to being where we
want to be."
If where they want to be is another bowl
game, then UCLA better get back on the win
ning track. The Bruins must win two of their last
four games to reach the six wins required for
bowl eligibility.
None of UCLA's final games are going to be
easy victories. Following the contest with the
Cardinal, UCLA takes on Washington State at
home before facing Oregon at Autzen Stadium
and closing out the season against No. 1 USC.
Against tough opposition, UCLA won't be
able to give up late points like they did against
Arizona State. If they continue to do so, they
could be headed fora repeat of last year's late
season meltdown.
