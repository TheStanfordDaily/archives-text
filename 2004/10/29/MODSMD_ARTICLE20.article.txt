# Irrational Exuberance
## Democracy and ignorance 
### 
In just four days, Americans —
at least half of them, anyway —
are going to exercise their in
alienable right to vote, so I
thought I would take this time to as
sert that Americans are too stupid
to decide who gets to be president.
Actually, not so much stupid as ig
norant. 1 freely place myself in that
category.
llie useless presidential debates

consisted of two
politicians repeat
ing oft-heard sound
bites that contain
little substance. But
who can blame
them?
My friends watch
ing were mostly com
menting about fa
cial tics, vocal in
flection and verbal
missives. No one

cared about policy questions or
substantive issues. Who could be
bothered?
I was further disheartened by lis
tening to NPR's coverage of Califor
nia's ballot propositions. I was horri
fied by how ill-informed the experts
were — much more so the callers —
and could only assume the listeners
were worse. As for the vast majority
of voters who don't even pay much at
tention, 1 shudder.
I find it disturbing how people who
devote just a few minutes of their days
to these issues feel qualified to sec
ond-guess policy makers who devote
their lives to them. This is exacerbat
ed by campaigns such as Rock the
Vote that encourage the attitude that
your opinion — no matter how unin
formed —should count.
Two weeks ago, Jon Stewart self
righteously showed up on CNN's
Crossfire, lambasting the show's hosts
for reducing complicated issues to
partisan spin. Yet CNN, like Stewart,
is merely providing what viewers
want. No one watches the PBS News
Hour.
Yet I believe the people are
blameless. I used to think education
was the answer to all of today's press
ing problems. Like Bush, the answer I
used to have for poverty, inequality,
affirmative action, democracy, etc.,
was better education.
Recently, somebody asked me
which candidate I favored. I equivo
cated because, incredible as it may
seem, I honestly like both. Yet she
pressed. If the election were a tie, how
would I vote?
I admitted I don't know. I am not
nearly qualified to make such a deci
sion. I — a product of arguably the
best education in the world — was in
sufficiently informed to answer.

The dirty little secret of rational
choice political theory is that it is basi
cally irrational for people to vote. The
chance of one vote affecting the out
come of an election is so miniscule
that it makes no sense for people to
bother, much less expend the effort to
properly learn the issues to make an
educated decision. We've known this
since Plato.
Philosopher John Dewey had a
beautiful thought, though. He argued
that since musicians and poets can
convey incredibly complex ideas to a
broad audience, social scientists
would one day learn to convey com
plex policy questions in a way that
could be broadly understood.
However, unless the Daily Show is
the beginning of a revolution in social
science communication (just crazy
enough to be true), we are a long ways
off.
So do I have a solution? Well no,
though I d first abolish the Californi
an proposition system, a pernicious
legacy of the progressive movement.
However, I might argue that
maybe the spittle and facial tics during
the debate really matter. Maybe since
voters are ill-equipped to judge the
policies of the candidates, the best
they can do is to assess their character.
Better still, I propose a radical new
system of elections with a rule that
you can only vote for somebody
you've personally met.
The personal contact rule takes
advantage of the millions of years of
evolution that have left humans with
social and cognitive tools extremely
well adapted to interpersonal interac
tions. Judgments are aided by net
works of social connections.
Candidates should be friends or
friends of friends. Bad candidates are
quickly identified and removed from
office.
Then, the candidates, one for each
community, collectively choose a new
executive. Essentially, the Electoral
College as originally envisioned.
Of course this system has prob
lems and is just a pipe dream. It's just
a thought.
Not that it even matters. Psycholo
gists know well that we attribute too
much credit to the person and not
enough to the situation. The character
traits of the person in office matter a
lot less than we think.
In a recent cross-country analysis,
two economists, Jones and Olicen,
found that the policies of democrati
cally elected leaders have no de
tectable impact on economic growth.
The moral. Don't vote.

maybe the spittle and facial tics during
the debate really matter. Maybe since
voters are ill-equipped to judge the
policies of the candidates, the best
they can do is to assess their character.
Better still, I propose a radical new
system of elections with a rule that
you can only vote for somebody
you've personally met.
The personal contact rule takes
advantage of the millions of years of
evolution that have left humans with
social and cognitive tools extremely
well adapted to interpersonal interac
tions. Judgments are aided by net
works of social connections.
Candidates should be friends or
friends of friends. Bad candidates are
quickly identified and removed from
office.
Then, the candidates, one for each
community, collectively choose a new
executive. Essentially, the Electoral
College as originally envisioned.
Of course this system has prob
lems and is just a pipe dream. It's just
a thought.
Not that it even matters. Psycholo
gists know well that we attribute too
much credit to the person and not
enough to the situation. The character
traits of the person in office matter a
lot less than we think.
In a recent cross-country analysis,
two economists, Jones and Olicen,
found that the policies of democrati
cally elected leaders have no de
tectable impact on economic growth.
The moral. Don't vote.

In just four days, Americans —
at least half of them, anyway —
are going to exercise their in
alienable right to vote, so I
thought I would take this time to as
sert that Americans are too stupid
to decide who gets to be president.
Actually, not so much stupid as ig
norant. 1 freely place myself in that
category.
llie useless presidential debates

consisted of two
politicians repeat
ing oft-heard sound
bites that contain
little substance. But
who can blame
them?
My friends watch
ing were mostly com
menting about fa
cial tics, vocal in
flection and verbal
missives. No one

cared about policy questions or
substantive issues. Who could be
bothered?
I was further disheartened by lis
tening to NPR's coverage of Califor
nia's ballot propositions. I was horri
fied by how ill-informed the experts
were — much more so the callers —
and could only assume the listeners
were worse. As for the vast majority
of voters who don't even pay much at
tention, 1 shudder.
I find it disturbing how people who
devote just a few minutes of their days
to these issues feel qualified to sec
ond-guess policy makers who devote
their lives to them. This is exacerbat
ed by campaigns such as Rock the
Vote that encourage the attitude that
your opinion — no matter how unin
formed —should count.
Two weeks ago, Jon Stewart self
righteously showed up on CNN's
Crossfire, lambasting the show's hosts
for reducing complicated issues to
partisan spin. Yet CNN, like Stewart,
is merely providing what viewers
want. No one watches the PBS News
Hour.
Yet I believe the people are
blameless. I used to think education
was the answer to all of today's press
ing problems. Like Bush, the answer I
used to have for poverty, inequality,
affirmative action, democracy, etc.,
was better education.
Recently, somebody asked me
which candidate I favored. I equivo
cated because, incredible as it may
seem, I honestly like both. Yet she
pressed. If the election were a tie, how
would I vote?
I admitted I don't know. I am not
nearly qualified to make such a deci
sion. I — a product of arguably the
best education in the world — was in
sufficiently informed to answer.

The dirty little secret of rational
choice political theory is that it is basi
cally irrational for people to vote. The
chance of one vote affecting the out
come of an election is so miniscule
that it makes no sense for people to
bother, much less expend the effort to
properly learn the issues to make an
educated decision. We've known this
since Plato.
Philosopher John Dewey had a
beautiful thought, though. He argued
that since musicians and poets can
convey incredibly complex ideas to a
broad audience, social scientists
would one day learn to convey com
plex policy questions in a way that
could be broadly understood.
However, unless the Daily Show is
the beginning of a revolution in social
science communication (just crazy
enough to be true), we are a long ways
off.
So do I have a solution? Well no,
though I d first abolish the Californi
an proposition system, a pernicious
legacy of the progressive movement.

maybe the spittle and facial tics during
the debate really matter. Maybe since
voters are ill-equipped to judge the
