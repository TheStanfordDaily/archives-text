Training tables are fair because
allil√üles need more calories
Ok, I'll bite. Are we really this des
perate for news? I'm writing about the
article published Thursday ("Athletes
enjoy special food at cafe," Oct. 28)
whose real purpose comes into view
when the story is continued on page 2.
The title on the jump says, "Some stu
dents complain that 'athlete' cafe is un
fair."
If this is a newsworthy story, then
why not spend the time to get the facts
straight?
First, Training Table is not a new
phenomenon. Supplemental meals for
athletes have been part of college ath
letics at least since the 19305.
Also, Jimmy V's is a restaurant
within Arrillaga that is open to the
general public and serves training

table food on select nights after regular
hours. Only in the last year or so has
Training Table moved to Jimmy V's
from Stern Dining.
That said, I have to question the
logic behind printing a quote from a
student who first heard of Training
Table from the reporter writing the
story. He says he is "unaware of any
compelling arguments as to why ath
letes should get better food than the
rest of us..
Well, we're not necessarily talking
about better food, but more of it. Need
compelling arguments? How about
drastically different caloric require
ments, or practice schedules that can
preempt meals in the dining halls?
The most personally disturbing
area of the article is the shift from a dis
cussion of training table to a wider crit
icism of athletics at Stanford. The

quotes in the article denounce special
treatment of athletes, ignoring the fact
that Stanford does a better job than
any university of integrating student
athletes with the rest of the student
body.
There are no athlete dorms at Stan
ford. no athlete dining halls, no admit
tance on athletic merit (and an 820 on
the SAT), all of which are standard at
any other Division 1 college. This bal
ance was part of the reason why I,
along with other athletes, chose to
come to Stanford.
Perhaps there really is the need to
report things like this. Next week,
some reporter may uncover the truth
behind rumors of books in Green Li
brary. My request, as an athlete and an
avid reader of The Daily, is that who
ever scoops the story does a better job
of checking the facts before writing the

article.

Palestinian casualties are mostly
armed combatants
I'm again dismayed that a Stanford
student. Mark Slee, fails to understand
facts. All participants at Camp David
confirmed that Arafat rejected a solid
peace proposal that would have given
his people their own state with its cap
ital in East Jerusalem. 95 percent of the
West Bank and billions of dollars in
aid. This is a fact. He then launched a
terrorist campaign. Fact.
Seventy-five percent of the Israelis
killed by suicide bombers are un
armed civilians, children under 17 and
people over 50. Eighty percent of the

Palestinians killed are armed terrorists
trying to kill Israelis.
Making a claim that Palestinians
might be defending themselves against
Israeli terror is factually incorrect. It's
as false a statement as saying men
never landed on the moon.
Slee needs to return to earth.

A vote for Cobb is not a vote for
Bush in California
When David Cobb visits our cam
pus Monday at noon and speaks in
Mitchell Earth Sciences Building
room 867, his visit both highlights a
problem for progressives and offers a
solution.
Most progressives were unhappy

with the choice of John Kerry as
Democratic presidential nominee,
preferring Dean or Kucinich.
In the recent months, the frenzy of
"Anybody But Bush," they may have
forgotten how disappointed they were
with the centrist Kerry. He voted for
the war against Iraq, for the Patriot
Act and, in earlier years, for the anti
environment and union-busting
NAFTA and GATT, for the media
monopolizing Telecommunications
Act of 19%, the 1994 crime bill (the Pa
triot Act's daddy) and the 1996
Counter Terrorism Act, and he
backed the racist death penalty.
In short, everything progressives
vilify Bush for, Kerry supported.
But still they argue. Bush has to be
worse. Fine, let's agree he is. With Kerry
