# The 						Big Picture
## Choices are clear, but there's no clear choice 
### WILL NELSON 
It is T-minus four days and counting
until the great election of 2004. Polls
show there are very few undecided vot
ers out there.
In fact, I recently saw a television
political commentator question
whether undecided voters are really
undecided or are just angling for an in
terview on a political talk show.
I'm not undecided — I know which
tribe I'm in and have already cast my
vote for its commander in chief — but
it's easy to understand why some vot
ers are having trouble making up their
minds.
In fact, maybe the more important
question is why we are all so cemented
in our choices for president.
Do we know enough to make a wise
choice between George W. Bush and
John Kerry?
Comparing key issue positions is
one way to judge candidates but not
the only way. The candidates' stances
are clear on some issues.
We know that Bush supports lead
ing America to victory in Iraq rather
than withdrawing. Kerry espouses a
similar position, with the only substan
tive difference being that he calls for an
international summit to discuss the sit
uation (if that counts as substantive).
But are issue stances really enough
to decide between candidates in this
election? On the overriding issues of
the day, terrorism and the war in Iraq,
it is difficult to discern substantial dif
ferences between the candidates' ap
proaches and even harder to predict
the consequences of alternative ap
proaches.
It would help to know a lot about

our enemy, but we really don't. We
don't know who and where our enemy
is, his numbers and resources, let alone
how to beat him.
Bush said he'll do "whatever it
takes" and Kerry claims to offer a "bet
ter approach" to fighting terrorism.
For all of the vagaries and campaign
rhetoric, these are two very different
men with starkly contrasting political
bases.
They would lead the war in differ
ent ways. However, it's not very clear
what those different ways are. Indirect
ly, for better or worse, voters will
choose our national terrorism policy
on Tuesday amid unnerving conditions
of uncertainty.
If you reflexively opt for Kerry's
less confrontational approach or
Bush's hard-line approach, just imag
ine fora moment the consequences if
your candidate wins on Tuesday and if
his approach turns out to be wrong.
Our enemy likes to think big and is ac
tively working to outdo their master
work, Sept. 11.
Use your imagination. Unprotect
ed nuclear and chemical plants
throughout America. Unaccounted
for nuclear materials. Barely protected
borders and seaports.
Remember Sept. 11? Think bigger.
Our enemies are.
Given the stakes, stark choices and
uncertainties, it is amazing that so
many voters are so deeply committed
to their candidate.
On Tuesday, Americans will vote
right down the gaping partisan chasm
that so divides this country.
Americans are frightened and
angry. Many of us are angry with terror
ists and extremists. Many blame Bush,

directing their fear and anger his way.
But more importantly, we are con
fused as a nation. No one yet knows for
sure the shape this struggle will take.
Any claim that Bush or Kerry has a
clear vision of how the war on terror
will evolve is nothing but empty cam
paign rhetoric.
In our anger, fear and confusion, we
go tribal. We vote for the candidate
who speaks our language. More accu
rately, we vote against the one who of
fends us down to our toenails.
This is not surprising, nor is it very
clear that there is a better way for us to
vote. We can talk about issues, candi
dates' records and what they did dur
ing the Vietnam War until we turn
blue.
We aren't going to go much further
than reflexive partisan allegiance until
there is more clarity to the shape of the
world to come.
What America, and even the world,
needs most right now is a clear vision of
a brighter future and a realistic path to
get there. In 2004, we are running on
superstition, paranoia, hype and gut in
stinct.
Maybe by 2008, when we do this all
over again, we will have a better un
derstanding of the true threat of terror
ism and what it will take to defeat it.
Maybe by then, there will be a little less
heat and a lot more light in public dis
cussions of terrorism and the war in
Iraq.
Partisanship will never go away, but
let's hope it subsides on these issues at
least.

We aren't going to go much further
than reflexive partisan allegiance until
there is more clarity to the shape of the
world to come.
What America, and even the world,
needs most right now is a clear vision of
a brighter future and a realistic path to
get there. In 2004, we are running on
superstition, paranoia, hype and gut in
stinct.
Maybe by 2008, when we do this all
over again, we will have a better un
derstanding of the true threat of terror
ism and what it will take to defeat it.
Maybe by then, there will be a little less
heat and a lot more light in public dis
cussions of terrorism and the war in
Iraq.
Partisanship will never go away, but
let's hope it subsides on these issues at
least.

It is T-minus four days and counting
until the great election of 2004. Polls
show there are very few undecided vot
ers out there.
In fact, I recently saw a television
political commentator question
whether undecided voters are really
undecided or are just angling for an in
terview on a political talk show.
I'm not undecided — I know which
tribe I'm in and have already cast my
vote for its commander in chief — but
it's easy to understand why some vot
ers are having trouble making up their
minds.
In fact, maybe the more important
question is why we are all so cemented
in our choices for president.
Do we know enough to make a wise
choice between George W. Bush and
John Kerry?
Comparing key issue positions is
one way to judge candidates but not
the only way. The candidates' stances
are clear on some issues.
We know that Bush supports lead
ing America to victory in Iraq rather
than withdrawing. Kerry espouses a
similar position, with the only substan
tive difference being that he calls for an
international summit to discuss the sit
uation (if that counts as substantive).
But are issue stances really enough
to decide between candidates in this
election? On the overriding issues of
the day, terrorism and the war in Iraq,
it is difficult to discern substantial dif
ferences between the candidates' ap
proaches and even harder to predict
the consequences of alternative ap
proaches.
It would help to know a lot about

our enemy, but we really don't. We
don't know who and where our enemy
is, his numbers and resources, let alone
how to beat him.
Bush said he'll do "whatever it
takes" and Kerry claims to offer a "bet
ter approach" to fighting terrorism.
For all of the vagaries and campaign
rhetoric, these are two very different
men with starkly contrasting political
bases.
They would lead the war in differ
ent ways. However, it's not very clear
what those different ways are. Indirect
ly, for better or worse, voters will
choose our national terrorism policy
on Tuesday amid unnerving conditions
of uncertainty.
If you reflexively opt for Kerry's
less confrontational approach or
Bush's hard-line approach, just imag
ine fora moment the consequences if
your candidate wins on Tuesday and if
his approach turns out to be wrong.
Our enemy likes to think big and is ac
tively working to outdo their master
work, Sept. 11.
Use your imagination. Unprotect
ed nuclear and chemical plants
throughout America. Unaccounted
for nuclear materials. Barely protected
borders and seaports.
Remember Sept. 11? Think bigger.
Our enemies are.
Given the stakes, stark choices and
uncertainties, it is amazing that so
many voters are so deeply committed
to their candidate.
On Tuesday, Americans will vote
right down the gaping partisan chasm
that so divides this country.
Americans are frightened and
angry. Many of us are angry with terror
ists and extremists. Many blame Bush,

directing their fear and anger his way.
But more importantly, we are con
fused as a nation. No one yet knows for
sure the shape this struggle will take.
Any claim that Bush or Kerry has a
clear vision of how the war on terror
will evolve is nothing but empty cam
paign rhetoric.
In our anger, fear and confusion, we
go tribal. We vote for the candidate
who speaks our language. More accu
rately, we vote against the one who of
fends us down to our toenails.
This is not surprising, nor is it very
clear that there is a better way for us to
vote. We can talk about issues, candi
dates' records and what they did dur
ing the Vietnam War until we turn
blue.
We aren't going to go much further
than reflexive partisan allegiance until
there is more clarity to the shape of the
world to come.

needs most right now is a clear vision of
a brighter future and a realistic path to
