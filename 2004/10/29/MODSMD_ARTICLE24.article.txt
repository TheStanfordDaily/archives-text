## Jeff Dorman Sucks! Losers no more, motto remains: Wait ’til next year 
### 
It wasn't going to happen. Not a chance. I
didn't even give it a first thought, much
less a second. To tell the truth. I just put it
out of my mind, sat on my roommate's couch
and devoured my overloaded chicken fajita.
The fact is, I haven't been to my evening
classes for weeks thanks to these playoffs, and
it wasn't going to start on Wednesday. Be
cause on Wednesday, the Boston Red Sox

won the World Series, and
it's been four of my lifetimes
since anyone could say that.
I'm not going to talk about
the game, the Sox, or the fans
— God knows you've heard it
all — and nothing I say is
going to change your feelings
on any of it. You know about
Schilling, about Lowe, even
about Theo. So I'm not going

to go into it. I'm not going to tell you that I knew
the Red Sox would come back while down to the
Yankees 2-0, writing in this space two weeks
ago, "So will Boston come back and win it all? In
a word, yes. It will be the greatest comeback of
any postseason ..." I'm not going to say it...
Oh. wait, I just did ... I'm so goddamn clever..
Besides, even with a ring, the motto of the
Red Sox will always be "Wait till next year." in
sickness and in health, so we won't reflect too
hard here. There is just so much love for this
team, all of New England wants the next sea
son to start tomorrow.
Why?
Well, it's simple, really. Whenever the Red
Sox win, my roommate, Mr. Steve Myrick,
raises his hands in the air, says "Yes" as if af
firming the morality of the win, and calmly
walks to his computer. He sits at his desktop,
precisely picking up his mouse as he grins like
a little boy waiting for recess. His ulcer gone
for the time being, he makes his way to iTunes,
double-clicks on "Dirty Water," the Sox's
fight song, and only then can he relax.
Why does he want it to start all over again?
Because he craves the satisfaction that only a
Sox win can provide. Let him have that, with
out the fear that his favorite team could blow
it all and come up empty yet again.
Besides, I'm looking forward to next year
for these, the best moments to look forward to
in the upcoming season.
No. 10: Every Boston home game against
the Yankees. I just can't wait to hear 30 thou
sand voices echoing "Overrated!" in the Visi
tors' dugout. And 1 know I wrote about how
much I hate that damn cheer, but after you
win it all, it's your one chance to let it fly.
No. 9: Steve: "Due to declining ticket sales,
Bud Selig will threaten to move the Brewers
to Montreal".
No. 8: Barry Bonds breaking home run
records. Even though he is juicing more than
Jack La Lanne, his record-breaking will at
least grant extra fame to those that deserve
some love. Hank Aaron needs some fame —
while watching the series, he was shown in the
stands, prompting my friend Guibobo to say
"That's Hank Aaron? I didn't know he was
black!" Let's introduce the greats to a new
generation.
No. 7: Nomar Garciaparra, signed to an ab
surd $10 million per year for the Cubs, coming
back to Fenway. Somehow getting on base,
Nomar will chat with Kevin Millar, perhaps
the most outspoken critic of Nomar's terrible
attitude while on the Sox. "Hey Kevin." "Hey
Nomar." "So, how've you b — " "I hate you."
No. 6: Steve: "Watching A-Rod develop a
mysterious disease that blows up his body to
absurd proportions, his skin tone changing to
the color of his purple lips. Upon the autopsy,
a wad of Willie Wonka's blueberry meal gum
