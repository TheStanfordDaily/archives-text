# Water polo looks to upend No. 1 UCLA
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Just a few weeks ago, the second-ranked
Stanford men's water polo squad (15-2,3-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) held
the No. 1 spot in the nation. The Cardinal
had defeated former top-ranked Southern
California and sat atop the standings enter
ing October.
Flash forward to the present. The Stan
ford men want that all back, and they'll get
the chance on Saturday when they face top
ranked UCLA (16-2,3-0) in Los Angeles.
"I'd definitely say we're excited and
anxious because we know we have the ca
pability of beating them," said sophomore
two-meter defender J.J. Garton. "We
know that a win this weekend would really
make the rest of our season very easy. It
would practically guarantee us a bid to
NCAAs, which is what our goal is."
Stanford lost its No. 1 ranking to UCLA
when it fell 10-9 in double overtime to the
Bruins in the championship game of the
Northern California Tournament. The
Bruins enter Saturday's game winners of 11
straight.
"What we need to do is have a lot of en
ergy at the beginning of the game," Garton
said. "Last time we played them we kind of
came out flat. This time if we come out with
a lot of energy and really take it to them
right away, we can set the tone of the game
in the first quarter and really dominate the

rest of the game."
Aside from the No. 1 ranking, Satur
day's game could very well be the game
that determines if Stanford or UCLA re
ceives an at-large bid to NCAAs. (The win
ner of the MPSF Tournament will receive
an automatic bid). Both teams head into
Saturday's game with perfect conference
records.
"We're a little nervous, as we usually
are going into big games," said head coach
John Vargas. "And that's okay — as long
as you get over that in the first minute or
so."
Saturday morning's showdown at the
Rose Bowl Aquatic Center is the Cardi
nal's biggest match of their four-game
road trip. Coming off two wins against
No. 8 Pepperdine and No. 7 UC-San
Diego on the road. Stanford hopes to
keep its momentum going through Sun
day, when the Cardinal end their trip
against Santa Barbara.
UCLA, on the other hand, heads into
the game after narrowly defeating the
Waves, 7-6.
"UCLA is a very up-and-down team,"
said junior driver Thomas Hopkins.
"Teams that we beat by 10 or 15, they'll
beat them by one and it'll be a close game
in overtime. For some reason. UCLA and
every team we play plays their best game of
the season against us. I don't know why.

Junior driver Peter Varellas and No. 2 Stanford get a chance to reclaim the No. 1
national ranking when they face the Bruins tomorrow in Los Angeles.
but everybody wants to really beat
Stanford."
The reason is clear: teams must
often go through Stanford to be
No. 1. USC took the top ranking
earlier this season before Stanford
took it back, and it was only after
beating the Cardinal that UCLA
earned its spot atop the poll.
Saturday will mark the third
time Stanford and UCLA have
faced each other this season. The
Cardinal won the first meeting. 8-7,
before suffering the NorCal Tour
nament loss. Garton will match up
against UCLA's two-meter men,
and senior Matt Moser against the
Bruins' drivers. Moser and senior
Tony Azevedo will cover senior
Brett Ormsby, the Bruins' leading
scorer, who played alongside
Azevedo in this summer's
Olympics. Ormsby leads the
league in scoring with 2.72 goals
per game.
Stanford, however, still boasts

the best goalkeeper in the confer
ence. as junior Chad Taylor owns a
4.56 goals-allowed average. Stan
ford also leads the MPSF in scor
ing, with 12.76 goals per game.
"We match up well with them,"
Vargas said. "They've got a lot of
seniors on their team, so they have
a lot of experience, hut so do we.
We're prepared for whatever
they're going to do."
Stanford could also look to get
under the skin of the Bruins on
Saturday.
"There are a few guys on the
team that are short-tempered, so
we're going to try to attack them
and get them out of their game,"
Hopkins said.
Stanford counters UCLA's at
tack with Hopkins and Azevedo,
who sit second and third, respec
tively. behind Ormsby in scoring.
Azevedo was named MPSF co
player of the week after scoring
eight goals against UC-San Diego

and Pepperdine last weekend. The
three-time National Player of the
Year also nears the 300-goal mark
this weekend and is tied for the
team lead with 42 goals despite
missing the first few games of the
season.
On Sunday, Stanford will play a
skilled and improved UC-Santa
Barbara (17-6, 2-1) team in anoth
er conference matchup. The No. 4
Gauchos. who finished 14-17 last
season, are hanging on to the
chance of getting to the NCAAs in
December.
"First of all. Saturday's game
makes the weekend difficult, but
now playing Santa Barbara on
Sunday — they've been having a
very successful season." Carton
said. "They've knocked off a cou
ple top teams (California and UC-
Irvine), so they're going to be
tough as well. Coming out of this
weekend with two wins would real
ly just be unbelievable."
