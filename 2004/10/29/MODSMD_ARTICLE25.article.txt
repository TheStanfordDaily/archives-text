# Water polo looks to upend No. 1 UCLA
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Just a few weeks ago, the second-ranked
Stanford men's water polo squad (15-2,3-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) held
the No. 1 spot in the nation. The Cardinal
had defeated former top-ranked Southern
California and sat atop the standings enter
ing October.
Flash forward to the present. The Stan
ford men want that all back, and they'll get
the chance on Saturday when they face top
ranked UCLA (16-2,3-0) in Los Angeles.
"I'd definitely say we're excited and
anxious because we know we have the ca
pability of beating them," said sophomore
two-meter defender J.J. Garton. "We
know that a win this weekend would really
make the rest of our season very easy. It
would practically guarantee us a bid to
NCAAs, which is what our goal is."
Stanford lost its No. 1 ranking to UCLA
when it fell 10-9 in double overtime to the
Bruins in the championship game of the
Northern California Tournament. The
Bruins enter Saturday's game winners of 11
straight.
"What we need to do is have a lot of en
ergy at the beginning of the game," Garton
said. "Last time we played them we kind of
came out flat. This time if we come out with
a lot of energy and really take it to them
right away, we can set the tone of the game
in the first quarter and really dominate the

rest of the game."
Aside from the No. 1 ranking, Satur
day's game could very well be the game
that determines if Stanford or UCLA re
ceives an at-large bid to NCAAs. (The win
ner of the MPSF Tournament will receive
an automatic bid). Both teams head into
Saturday's game with perfect conference
records.
"We're a little nervous, as we usually
are going into big games," said head coach
John Vargas. "And that's okay â€” as long
as you get over that in the first minute or
so."
Saturday morning's showdown at the
Rose Bowl Aquatic Center is the Cardi
nal's biggest match of their four-game
road trip. Coming off two wins against
No. 8 Pepperdine and No. 7 UC-San
Diego on the road. Stanford hopes to
keep its momentum going through Sun
day, when the Cardinal end their trip
against Santa Barbara.
UCLA, on the other hand, heads into
the game after narrowly defeating the
Waves, 7-6.
"UCLA is a very up-and-down team,"
said junior driver Thomas Hopkins.
"Teams that we beat by 10 or 15, they'll
beat them by one and it'll be a close game
in overtime. For some reason. UCLA and
every team we play plays their best game of
the season against us. I don't know why.
