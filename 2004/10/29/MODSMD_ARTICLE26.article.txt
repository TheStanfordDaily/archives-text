# X-Country teams are ready, set for Pac-10s
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While much of the campus is astir
with excitement about the World Series,
some notice ought to be directed at a
pair of teams looking to claim their fifth
and ninth consecutive Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships. This Saturday, the
No. 2 men and top-ranked women's
cross country teams will look for repeat
performances of last year's Pac-10
Championships as they compete for the
conference title at Golden Gate Park.
The men have won the last four Pac
-10 titles and seven of the last eight.
Equally impressive are the women's 10
titles in 11 years, including eight consec
utive crowns. This weekend's meet will
be vital as the teams move deeper into
the season and ready themselves for Re
gional and NCAAs.
"Competing successfully at the Pac
-10 Championships (is important) in
building our confidence moving into the

Regionals and NCAAs," men's head
coach Andy Gerard said.
Last year at Pac-lOs, then-seniors lan
Dobson and Grant Robison delivered a
one-two punch as they finished in first
and second. Their finishes helped the
Cardinal handily defeat the other teams
and place a 68-point margin between
themselves and second-place Oregon.
Seniors Sara Bei and Alicia Craig also
finished in first and second, crossing the
finish virtually at the same time, with
only a tenth of a second separating them.
Bei and Craig then went on to finish
third and sixth at NCAAs.
While Stanford has always had a
strong showing at Pac-lOs, the teams
must still be cautious.
"Pac-10 is a different meet in that it's
a very small meet," women's head coach
Dena Evans said. "Scores are really low
and there are only a few runners from a
few teams. Because the scores are so
low, there's not a lot of room to maneu
ver."

As they prepare for Regionals and
NCAAs in addition to Pac-lOs, the
teams looked strong as they nabbed
first-place individual titles in the men's
and women's divisions as well as team
victories in the Pre-NCAA meet in
Terre Haute. Ind. In San Francisco, the
men will race in the 8,000 meter while
the women will participate in the 6.0(H).
As the men look for another title,
they will be competing against seven
other teams, with No. 9 Arizona State
expected to provide the most competi
tion.
"Each team has several guys who
could and should penetrate that top
scoring range, with Arizona State featur
ing probably the deepest group and
therefore our biggest challenge," Ger
ard said.
All too familiar with challenge is last
year's Pac-10 Athlete of the Year, senior
Ryan Hall. Due to injury. Hall has ap
peared in only one meet — Pre-NCAAs
— but he certainly made an impact as he

claimed first place with a time of 23 min
utes, 54.4 seconds.
In addition to Hall, other Stanford
runners who competed well at Pre-
NCAAs were sophomore Nef Araia and
junior Jacob Gomez who placed fifth
and 10th, respectively. Araia ran off with
a third-place finish at the Notre Dame
Invitational, and Gomez has placed in
the top 10 of all three races he's run this
season. Junior Peter Meindl has made an
impact as well, securing two wins in three
races.
The Cardinal men are not the only
ones working hard and producing re
sults. On the women's team, seniors
Anita Siraki and Jeane Golf, sopho
mores Amanda and Katy Trotter and
Teresa McWalters, and freshman Lau
ren Centrowit/. have all performed well
in 2004.
This season, Goff and Centrowitz
have produced two top-10 finishes

apiece in four and three races, respectively. In all four
races of this year, Amanda Trotter has produced no less
than a top-five finish while Katy Trotter has placed no
lower than eighth.
However, most noteworthy is Siraki. who has been
producing significant results in her final season at Stan
ford. Siraki has not only come out with two wins this
season but also has finished in the top 10 three times.
Siraki credits some of her success to her team and
coach: "1 came here to help the team win and be a con
tributing factor to the team. All my teammates have
been so encouraging and inspiring to watch, and I want
ed to give back to them what they've given me.
"I think that the mileage pattern Dena has me on is
helping me a lot as well," she added. "She encourages us
to take a day off each week, so it's really nice to have
that one day to let our bodies recover."
While the results reflect Siraki's progress, Evans will
also vouch for her marked improvement.
"She has done a great job this year and has been an
inspiration for her teammates," Evans said. "She's been
great for me as a coach to see at each of the races and
follows her race plans really effectively."
As seniors, Craig and Siraki look forward to this
weekend as the beginning of the end of their senior
seasons.
Siraki describes the feeling as "bittersweet," while
Craig said, "It's strange to know that this could be my
last year running for Stanford."
"Nothing compares to the feeling of being on such a
talented team and, more importantly, being surrounded
by such an amazing group of women." Craig said. "I
wish that I had a way to make these memories last."
This isn't to say that the above names are the only
Stanford runners who might make a strong showing.
"We've had a lot of people on the same page in terms
of being ready to provide what the team needs them to
do on a particular race day," Evans said. "We've had a
number of people who we can sub in and garner good
results.
"We'll be prepared to do a couple different things
but I expect to see a confident group ready to compete
against whoever is ready to compete on that particular
day."

some notice ought to be directed at a
pair of teams looking to claim their fifth
and ninth consecutive Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships. This Saturday, the
No. 2 men and top-ranked women's
cross country teams will look for repeat
performances of last year's Pac-10
Championships as they compete for the
conference title at Golden Gate Park.
The men have won the last four Pac
-10 titles and seven of the last eight.
Equally impressive are the women's 10
titles in 11 years, including eight consec
utive crowns. This weekend's meet will
be vital as the teams move deeper into
the season and ready themselves for Re
gional and NCAAs.
"Competing successfully at the Pac
-10 Championships (is important) in
building our confidence moving into the

Regionals and NCAAs," men's head
coach Andy Gerard said.
Last year at Pac-lOs, then-seniors lan
Dobson and Grant Robison delivered a
one-two punch as they finished in first
and second. Their finishes helped the
Cardinal handily defeat the other teams
and place a 68-point margin between
themselves and second-place Oregon.
Seniors Sara Bei and Alicia Craig also
finished in first and second, crossing the
finish virtually at the same time, with
only a tenth of a second separating them.
Bei and Craig then went on to finish
third and sixth at NCAAs.
While Stanford has always had a
strong showing at Pac-lOs, the teams
must still be cautious.
"Pac-10 is a different meet in that it's
a very small meet," women's head coach
Dena Evans said. "Scores are really low
and there are only a few runners from a
few teams. Because the scores are so
low, there's not a lot of room to maneu
ver."

As they prepare for Regionals and
NCAAs in addition to Pac-lOs, the
teams looked strong as they nabbed
first-place individual titles in the men's
and women's divisions as well as team
victories in the Pre-NCAA meet in
Terre Haute. Ind. In San Francisco, the
men will race in the 8,000 meter while
the women will participate in the 6.0(H).
As the men look for another title,
they will be competing against seven
other teams, with No. 9 Arizona State
expected to provide the most competi
tion.
"Each team has several guys who
could and should penetrate that top
scoring range, with Arizona State featur
ing probably the deepest group and
therefore our biggest challenge," Ger
ard said.
All too familiar with challenge is last
year's Pac-10 Athlete of the Year, senior
Ryan Hall. Due to injury. Hall has ap
peared in only one meet — Pre-NCAAs
— but he certainly made an impact as he

claimed first place with a time of 23 min
utes, 54.4 seconds.
In addition to Hall, other Stanford
runners who competed well at Pre-
NCAAs were sophomore Nef Araia and
junior Jacob Gomez who placed fifth
and 10th, respectively. Araia ran off with
a third-place finish at the Notre Dame
Invitational, and Gomez has placed in
the top 10 of all three races he's run this
season. Junior Peter Meindl has made an
impact as well, securing two wins in three
races.
The Cardinal men are not the only
ones working hard and producing re
sults. On the women's team, seniors
Anita Siraki and Jeane Golf, sopho
mores Amanda and Katy Trotter and
Teresa McWalters, and freshman Lau
ren Centrowit/. have all performed well
in 2004.
This season, Goff and Centrowitz
have produced two top-10 finishes

apiece in four and three races, respectively. In all four
races of this year, Amanda Trotter has produced no less
than a top-five finish while Katy Trotter has placed no
lower than eighth.
However, most noteworthy is Siraki. who has been
producing significant results in her final season at Stan
ford. Siraki has not only come out with two wins this
season but also has finished in the top 10 three times.
Siraki credits some of her success to her team and
coach: "1 came here to help the team win and be a con
tributing factor to the team. All my teammates have
been so encouraging and inspiring to watch, and I want
ed to give back to them what they've given me.
"I think that the mileage pattern Dena has me on is
helping me a lot as well," she added. "She encourages us
to take a day off each week, so it's really nice to have
that one day to let our bodies recover."
While the results reflect Siraki's progress, Evans will
also vouch for her marked improvement.
"She has done a great job this year and has been an
inspiration for her teammates," Evans said. "She's been
great for me as a coach to see at each of the races and
follows her race plans really effectively."
As seniors, Craig and Siraki look forward to this
weekend as the beginning of the end of their senior
seasons.
Siraki describes the feeling as "bittersweet," while
Craig said, "It's strange to know that this could be my
last year running for Stanford."
"Nothing compares to the feeling of being on such a
talented team and, more importantly, being surrounded
by such an amazing group of women." Craig said. "I
wish that I had a way to make these memories last."
This isn't to say that the above names are the only
Stanford runners who might make a strong showing.
"We've had a lot of people on the same page in terms
of being ready to provide what the team needs them to
do on a particular race day," Evans said. "We've had a
number of people who we can sub in and garner good
results.
"We'll be prepared to do a couple different things
but I expect to see a confident group ready to compete
against whoever is ready to compete on that particular
day."
