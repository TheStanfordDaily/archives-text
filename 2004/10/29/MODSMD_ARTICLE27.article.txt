# Men's soccer to face No. 4 Washington, OSU
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's soccer team (6-3-5,
1-2-2 Pacific-10 Conference) needs to start
winning — and soon — in order to keep
their increasingly fragile postseason hopes
alive. Stanford has not won since Oct. 8 at
Oregon State, going a combined 0-2-2 over
that span.
The Cardinal will try to pull out of this
slide when they welcome No. 4 Washing
ton (10-3-2, 3-0-1) and Oregon State (5-8-
1,0-4-0) to the Farm this weekend.
"The games this weekend are extreme
ly important to us, because they are vital to
getting an NCAA bid," said head coach
Bret Simon. "Due to the parity in college
soccer, there are teams with similar records
out there. Part of the selection process
looks at whether your team has a positive
trend or win streak at the end of the year."
The schedule does not get any easier for

the Cardinal after this weekend. Stanford
will have to visit previously top-ranked
UC-Santa Barbara and arch-rival Califor
nia to close out the season.
"These games are so important, be
cause we don't want to put ourselves in
must-win situations on the road against
some top-ranked teams like UC-Santa
Barbara and Cal." Simon said.
The Cardinal have already faced the
Huskies and Beavers this season, but fa
miliarity does not necessarily make win
ning any less difficult.
"It's easier to prepare for these games
because you don't have as much tactical
work and we know what formations they
play," said junior midfielder K.C. Coyne.
"However, it can definitely play out cither
way [to our benefit or not)."
Also, some things have changed since
the first meetings.
