# Men's soccer to face No. 4 Washington, OSU
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's soccer team (6-3-5,
1-2-2 Pacific-10 Conference) needs to start
winning — and soon — in order to keep
their increasingly fragile postseason hopes
alive. Stanford has not won since Oct. 8 at
Oregon State, going a combined 0-2-2 over
that span.
The Cardinal will try to pull out of this
slide when they welcome No. 4 Washing
ton (10-3-2, 3-0-1) and Oregon State (5-8-
1,0-4-0) to the Farm this weekend.
"The games this weekend are extreme
ly important to us, because they are vital to
getting an NCAA bid," said head coach
Bret Simon. "Due to the parity in college
soccer, there are teams with similar records
out there. Part of the selection process
looks at whether your team has a positive
trend or win streak at the end of the year."
The schedule does not get any easier for

the Cardinal after this weekend. Stanford
will have to visit previously top-ranked
UC-Santa Barbara and arch-rival Califor
nia to close out the season.
"These games are so important, be
cause we don't want to put ourselves in
must-win situations on the road against
some top-ranked teams like UC-Santa
Barbara and Cal." Simon said.
The Cardinal have already faced the
Huskies and Beavers this season, but fa
miliarity does not necessarily make win
ning any less difficult.
"It's easier to prepare for these games
because you don't have as much tactical
work and we know what formations they
play," said junior midfielder K.C. Coyne.
"However, it can definitely play out cither
way [to our benefit or not)."
Also, some things have changed since
the first meetings.


LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily File
Winless in their last four matches, sophomore
Michael Brown and the Cardinal look to end
that skid tonight against No. 4 Washington.
Stanford played a shorthanded
Oregon State team the first time,
and responding to the addition of
Beavers leading scorer Robbie
Findley will complicate play for the
Cardinal. Findley has tallied live
goals for the Beavers this season
and is a catalyst for their offense.
"When we played Oregon State
last, they didn't have their leading
scorer, so it's going to be interesting
to see how their speed and offense
improves." Simon said.
However, the first task of the
weekend will be the Washington
Huskies, a team Stanford led late in
the second half and then played to a
2-2 draw in Seattle. Washington re
mains the only team in the Pac-10
without an in-eonference loss, and
the tie is their worst Pac-10 result
this year (3-0-1).
Stopping Washington means
containing their standout midfielder
and Player of the Year candidate.

senior C.J. Klaas.
"Washington is a great counter
attack team, with a fantastic center
midfielder |KlaasJ," Coyne said. "If
he gets the hall, they'll be off and
running at your net."
The coaching staff is preparing
fora true battle, as both teams have
little excuse for poor play.
"They [Washington| are well
coached, they will be well rested
after having a weekend off from
play and we are rested after our
game Friday," Simon said. "We
know them very well, and it will be
an interesting weekend."
Second on the agenda is Oregon
State. The Beavers are the only
team in the Pac-10 without a confer
ence win, but they played Stanford
tight in the Cardinal's 2-1 win on
Oct. 8.
The key to success in the coming
weeks could be returning to the
mindset that helped Stanford race

out to a 6-1-3 start.
"We need to start playing with
the attitude we had at the beginning
of the year in the SMU tourna
ment." Coyne said. "We were all
over people and we had ;i tough de
fensive mentality. The change in at
titude will happen on its own, and it
needs to with the postseason possi
bly coming up."
One possible advantage that the
Cardinal have this weekend is play
ing at home, despite a disappointing
1-2-3 record at Maloney Field this
year.
"It's a lot easier to play at home
because you don't have to have the
burden on your legs that travel puts
on you," Coyne said.
This weekend's matches are the
last home games of the regular sea
son for the Cardinal.
Kick-off for tonight's game is
scheduled for 7:30 p.m., and Sun
day's match will begin at 2:30 p.m.
