# Healthy at last, volleyball set for seasonâ€™s second half
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's volleyball team
will start the second half of its Pacific-10
Conference schedule against cross-bay
rival No. 13 California on Sunday at Haas
Pavilion in Berkeley at 3 p.m. No. 11 Stan
ford (15-5,7-2) comes off the first half of its
conference schedule tied for second place
with No. 5 USC (12-3,7-2).
"Given that I ranked six teams from the
conference in the top 12 nationally, almost
any team could be 9-0 or 4-5." head coach
John Dunning said. "We would have rather
been 9-0 or 8-1 and tied with Washington,
but 7-2 is pretty good."
Stanford enters the second half of its
season trailing undefeated and No. 1 Wash
ington by two games in conference. While
almost certain to make another playoff ap
pearance (the Cardinal are one of only four
teams in the nation to go to the NCAA

tournament every year since its inception in
1981), the second half will determine how
highly Stanford will he seeded and what
kind of path will he set in the tournament.
"The Pac-10 is one of the best confer
ences in the country," senior outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani said. "If you establish
yourself in the Pac-10, you establish your
self in the tournament. We're fortunate to
be in the Pac-10 because it prepares you for
the NCAA tournament."
The road ahead for the Cardinal will not
be easy, however. Starting with the Golden
Bears on Sunday. Stanford will play six of
its final 10 matches against nationally
ranked opponents, including DSC and No.
12 UCLA
"It's always nice every weekend to see
where you arc in the season." senior libero
Leahi Hall said. "Playing three good teams
in a row will allow us to see if we can main-
tain a high level of play and change our game plan three
times in a row. Against USC and UCLA, we also have a
chance to defend our home court."
California comes into Sunday's match with an 11-7
record overall and is tied for third in the Pac-10 with
UCLA at 6-3.
When these two teams played earlier this season at
Burnham Pavilion, the Cardinal outlasted the Bears in
a five-game emotional thriller, winning the deciding
game by a slim 15-12 margin. It was the second match
in a row that the two teams played hard to the bitter
end.
Last year in Berkeley, the Bears were able to beat the
Cardinal in another five-game set. defeating Stanford
for the first time in over 20 years. Stanford owns a 53-4
mark against California all-time.
Dunning described California's rise to Pac-10 promi
nence.
"Berkeley is a really good school, which helps them
in recruiting," Dunning said. "There has to be a good
coaching base for the volleyball program. You have to
get your foot in the door, which Cal did with Mia Jerkov.
From there, you get more chances and more recruits.
Programs either spiral upordown.andCal has been spi
raling up. If they still had Mia, they might be the best
team in the country instead of fighting it out in the
trenches with the rest of us."
Jerkov, who is a member of the Croatian national
team, decided not to return to Cal for her senior season
amidst controversy regarding her eligibility. She com
peted against professional Russian players over the
summer.
In place of a single dominant outside hitter, the
Bears bring a more balanced attack against the Cardi
nal, including four players who posted double digits in
kills against Stanford in their first match this season.
Additionally, the California defense is led by
sophomore libero Jillian Davis, who set a school
record with 33 digs in her previous match against Stan
ford.
"She's obviously a tremendous player," Hall said.
"She's making the most of her opportunities. Coaches
tend to play their best diggers at left back."
Stanford's star appears to be on the rise, as well. Not
only have they won five of their last six matches, but the
team is finally complete and back from injury. In the
match against Washington State, Stanford was able to

play every player on the active roster.
Key injuries to junior setter Katie Goldhahn and
Hall hindered the Cardinal from completely clicking as
a team in the first half, but look for team chemistry to
grow down the stretch.
"Having everyone healthy helps us with developing
a rhythm," Nnamani said. "It's hard to develop as a team
with someone hurt. If everyone is healthy, we can focus
on volleyball things."
Dunning added, "The second half is no different than
the first half. We have to improve every week and play
each opponent one play at a time. We want to be the
team still improving at the end of the season."

be in the Pac-10 because it prepares you for
the NCAA tournament."
The road ahead for the Cardinal will not
be easy, however. Starting with the Golden
Bears on Sunday. Stanford will play six of
its final 10 matches against nationally
ranked opponents, including DSC and No.
12 UCLA
"It's always nice every weekend to see
where you arc in the season." senior libero
Leahi Hall said. "Playing three good teams
in a row will allow us to see if we can main-
tain a high level of play and change our game plan three
times in a row. Against USC and UCLA, we also have a
chance to defend our home court."
California comes into Sunday's match with an 11-7
record overall and is tied for third in the Pac-10 with
UCLA at 6-3.
When these two teams played earlier this season at
Burnham Pavilion, the Cardinal outlasted the Bears in
a five-game emotional thriller, winning the deciding
game by a slim 15-12 margin. It was the second match
in a row that the two teams played hard to the bitter
end.
Last year in Berkeley, the Bears were able to beat the
Cardinal in another five-game set. defeating Stanford
for the first time in over 20 years. Stanford owns a 53-4
mark against California all-time.
Dunning described California's rise to Pac-10 promi
nence.
"Berkeley is a really good school, which helps them
in recruiting," Dunning said. "There has to be a good
coaching base for the volleyball program. You have to
get your foot in the door, which Cal did with Mia Jerkov.
From there, you get more chances and more recruits.
Programs either spiral upordown.andCal has been spi
raling up. If they still had Mia, they might be the best
team in the country instead of fighting it out in the
trenches with the rest of us."
Jerkov, who is a member of the Croatian national
team, decided not to return to Cal for her senior season
amidst controversy regarding her eligibility. She com
peted against professional Russian players over the
summer.
In place of a single dominant outside hitter, the
Bears bring a more balanced attack against the Cardi
nal, including four players who posted double digits in
kills against Stanford in their first match this season.
Additionally, the California defense is led by
sophomore libero Jillian Davis, who set a school
record with 33 digs in her previous match against Stan
ford.
"She's obviously a tremendous player," Hall said.
"She's making the most of her opportunities. Coaches
tend to play their best diggers at left back."
Stanford's star appears to be on the rise, as well. Not
only have they won five of their last six matches, but the
team is finally complete and back from injury. In the
match against Washington State, Stanford was able to

play every player on the active roster.
Key injuries to junior setter Katie Goldhahn and
Hall hindered the Cardinal from completely clicking as
a team in the first half, but look for team chemistry to
grow down the stretch.
"Having everyone healthy helps us with developing
a rhythm," Nnamani said. "It's hard to develop as a team
with someone hurt. If everyone is healthy, we can focus
on volleyball things."
Dunning added, "The second half is no different than
the first half. We have to improve every week and play
each opponent one play at a time. We want to be the
team still improving at the end of the season."

13 California on Sunday in Berkeley.
The Stanford women's volleyball team
will start the second half of its Pacific-10
Conference schedule against cross-bay
rival No. 13 California on Sunday at Haas
Pavilion in Berkeley at 3 p.m. No. 11 Stan
ford (15-5,7-2) comes off the first half of its
conference schedule tied for second place
with No. 5 USC (12-3,7-2).
"Given that I ranked six teams from the
conference in the top 12 nationally, almost
any team could be 9-0 or 4-5." head coach
John Dunning said. "We would have rather
been 9-0 or 8-1 and tied with Washington,
but 7-2 is pretty good."
Stanford enters the second half of its
season trailing undefeated and No. 1 Wash
ington by two games in conference. While
almost certain to make another playoff ap
pearance (the Cardinal are one of only four
teams in the nation to go to the NCAA

tournament every year since its inception in
1981), the second half will determine how
highly Stanford will he seeded and what
kind of path will he set in the tournament.
"The Pac-10 is one of the best confer
ences in the country," senior outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani said. "If you establish
yourself in the Pac-10, you establish your
self in the tournament. We're fortunate to
be in the Pac-10 because it prepares you for
the NCAA tournament."
