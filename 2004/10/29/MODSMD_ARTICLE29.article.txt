# Women's soccer hosts UO, OSU

### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Winning isn't everything, but it's the
only thing on the minds of the Stanford
women's soccer team this weekend as it
looks to keep its Pacific-10 Conference
title hopes alive with just four confer
ence games remaining.
While victories have been hard to
come by of late, the No. 17 Cardinal (10-
4-2. 2-2-1 Pac-10) should have an easier
time recording a W' this weekend as
they host Oregon (3-10-2, 0-4-1) and
Oregon State (8-K-O. 2-3-0) on Friday
and Sunday.
The Oregon schools currently occupy
the bottom two spots in the conference
standings. The Ducks are the only Pac-10
team without a conference victory, while
the Beavers huve fared only slightly better.
Despite their opponents' poor track
records, the Cardinal are not taking any
of their Pac-10 games for granted given
the depth of the conference this season.
"All the Pac-10 teams are strong, and
I know these two teams and they will be
tough games," said head coach Paul Rat
cliffe. "We've done well against teams
that are better than these, so it's one of
those things where we have a lot of pres
sure on us to get two results this week
end."
The Cardinal are coming off of a
weekend split against UCLA and
Southern California on the road. In a
game that featured the best and worst of
this year's squad, the Cardinal lost 1-0
to the Bruins on Friday. The Stanford
defense was resilient for Ml minutes of
play before UCLA, which had 19 shots
on goal, finally broke through. Senior
goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart played well
between the posts in defeat, collecting
10 saves.
The Cardinal offense struggled
mightily, though, tallying just one shot

on goal in the match.
"UCLA sent a lot of numbers for
ward on the attack, and we never really
seemed to adjust to that," said junior de
fender Jenny Farenbaugh. "As a whole,
we all need to move up the field in order
to support the forwards."
Redemption was in store, however, as
the Cardinal salvaged the road trip by
grabbing a 1-0 win over the Women of
Troy on Sunday. Senior forward Marcie
Ward scored the game-winner for her
seventh goal of the season.
History will be on the Cardinals side
tonight when they take on Oregon in the
first game of the weekend homestand.
Stanford owns a 7-0 all-time record against
the Ducks and has allowed only two goals
in those games. The Cardinal know that
history' means very little, however, as Ari
zona defeated Stanford for the first time in
school history earlier this season.
At the head of the Ducks' offense is
newcomer Kami Kapaku, who leads
the team with four goals, eight points
and 29 shots. Outside of Kapaku, Ore
gon has struggled offensively through
out the conference season. The Ducks
have been outscored 16-2 by Pac-10
opponents and have registered no
more than one goal in any conference
game.
Oregon is also ranked dead last in the
Pac-10 in every major offensive category
with the exception of shots taken (eighth).
While the Cardinal will be the heavy fa
vorites tonight, the team's strategy remains
the same. As Ratcliffe put it, the Cardinal
are looking to "play good soccer."
"I don't think we're really going to
change our strategy for each opponent,"
Ratcliffe said. "We've got to take chances
and take shots and get some goals."
The Cardinal will return to action on
Sunday to take on Oregon State, which is
led by freshman forward Jodie Taylor.
Taylor, the Pac-10's leading scorer, is the

heart and soul of the Beaver offense and
has accounted for more than half of her
team's goals this season.
The Cardinal defense is not intimidat
ed by the freshman phenom and will
look to defend her in the same way it has
defended other high-scoring opponents.
"Our defense has faced a number of
great forwards this year," Farenbaugh
said. "I don't think Taylor should be a
problem if we stay organized in the back
and really focus on communication."
Stanford will honor its departing se
niors prior to kick-off, as is customary at

the last home game of every season. This
year the Cardinal will be honoring seven
seniors, including co-captains Ward and
Barnhart.
"I am really looking forward to it,"
Ward said. "I think it will he a great day
where the team and program can recog
nize all the seniors and what we have
brought to the program the past four
plus years."
The weekend series begins on tonight
at 5 p.m. at Maloney Field.
