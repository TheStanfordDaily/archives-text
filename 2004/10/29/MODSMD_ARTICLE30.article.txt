# Students make plans to start gay fraternity chapter of Delta Lambda Phi at New York University
## 
### JAMES DANIEL WASHINGTON SQUARE NEWS (NEW YORK U.) 10/27/2004 
(U-WIRE) NEW YORK â€” For
Matt Maggiacomo, the age-old con
ception of fraternities as bastions of
straight male exclusivity is totally
out. Maggiacomo, a sophomore, is
making plans to start a chapter of a
national gay fraternity at New York
University.
Maggiacomo wants to start a
colony of Delta Lambda Phi, a
group that fully espouses the greek
traditions of mainstream fraterni
ties, but that is oriented to gay. bi
sexual and "progressive" straight
men.
Maggiacomo said he envisions
the fraternity not only as a brother
hood. but also as an institution fight
ing for equality and gaining recogni

tion for gay people.
"To establish this fraternity,
we're breaking down barriers and
breaking down those stereotypes
that many people may have of us,"
he said. "We want to be seen with
community service projects, with
great parties, bringing a lot to the
university."
Since it began in Washington,
D C., in 1986, the group, which has
both community- and school-based
chapters, has spread to almost two
dozen universities.
About a year ago, Maggiacomo
had the idea for an NYU colony.
Now, after talks with NYU adminis
tration and the national organiza
tion, he feels confident that NYU's
colony can open by fall 2005.
Maggiacomo is now looking for
interested students so the colony can
get off the ground when he returns
from studying abroad in this spring.

To become a fully recognized
chapter, a fraternity must go
through a three-semester trial
phase, during which it is known as a
colony. The first members, consist
ing of eight to 15 men, will receive in
struction from brothers from the
original chapter in Washington,
D.C., and must organize their plan
for pledges and housing. If the
colony completes the trial period
and becomes a chapter, it becomes
eligible for NYU housing.
One of the fraternity's functions
will be to act as a support system for
young men dealing with their sexual
ity, Maggiacomo said.
"You've got other guys that have
been through it, and you can talk
about it,"he said. "I've talked to
some seniors who've said T wish we
we'd had it when I was [younger]."'
A common criticism of Delta
Lambda Phi is that the fraternity
provides an easy opportunity for gay
men to meet and pursue sexual rela
tionships. But Maggiacomo
adamantly refuted this perception.
"I couldn't be 100 percent more
against that," he said. "It's not a dat
ing game."
Bob Butler, director of student
activities, whose office oversees
NYU fraternities and sororities, said
the group would be a welcome addi
tion to NYU's greek life.
"Recognizing a gay fraternity at
NYU would be consistent with our
tradition of celebrating and embrac

ing diversity on our campus," he
wrote in an e-mail.
Members of campus fraternities
they saw no problem with the addi
tion of a gay fraternity to NYU's
greek system.
"1 wouldn't mind," said senior
Andy Minkstein, a brother of Delta
Phi. "If there was interest in a thing
like that, they could do the same
charitable things that we do, then
why not?"
Ben Miron, a sophomore in
Sigma Alpha Mu, said he supports
the idea of fraternities based on non
traditional criteria.
"I think fraternities are a good
thing, and if someone wants to start
a frat based on something else, that's
fine," he said.
NYU sociology professor Judith
Stacey, who researches queer theo
ry, said she wasn't sure a gay frater
nity could increase acceptance of
gay students.
"It's a double-edged sword," she
said. "Whenever you're in a group
that's stigmatized, you want solidarity
to reverse those effects. But in the end
you end up reinforcing that category."
But Maggiacomo said in his vi
sion of the fraternity, the group will
be avoiding stereotypes.
"The gay social scene in New
York City is not a safe haven.
There's a lot of vice," he said. "I
want to establish this social group
that's not defined by that... I want it
to be positive."
