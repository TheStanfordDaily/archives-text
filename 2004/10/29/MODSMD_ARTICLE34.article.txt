## Cast your ballet for Morris 
### EMILY HITE INTERMISSION DANCE CRITIC 
Last weekend at UC-Berkeley's
Zellerbach Hall, Mark Morris Dance
Group presented two beautiful and
brilliant works from the company's
repertory â€” an experience in Morris'
genius as a dancemaker. Morris ac
complishes something few choreog
raphers are capable of: He actually
improves music. With a string quartet
and a jazz band, Morris builds on the
gorgeous scores, skillfully highlight
ing subtleties within the music
The first piece, entitled "Mosaic &
United,"was a whirlwind of musical
movementand color reminiscent of
an advanced and intelligent version of
"Fantasia."
The dancers' silken costumes and
the softly lit orange-pink background
set the atmosphere. Much of the
movement suggested suspension or
flight and subsequent release. One
man stood on one leg. the other held
hip-level in front of him, leatiing very
slightly forward and balanced by an
assumed but unseen supporter in the
wings until the support let go and he
became grounded on the floor. Lifts
portraying momentary, almost rever
ent stillness dissembled as quickly and
gracefully as they formed. Some
transitions within the piece oc
curred with a cyclonic running pat
tern that dancers joined and left
between segments. In other in
stances, several dancers simply

stood and gazed skyward in an in
explicably lovely moment.
One of the most engaging seg
ments of "Mosaic & Unite" was a se
ries of solos, memorable for the clever
choreography of entrances and exits
that made the dancers appear and
vanish as if by magic. The choreogra
phy was basically identical for every
dancer, but each soloist's exploration of

space and inter
pretation of
movement was
so unique it
could have been
replicated by
many more
dancers without
losing its fresh
ness.
What was
different each
time was not a
personality or
some style, but a
lens so finely
unique that it
was fascinating
to figure out how
the movement
had changed
each time. The
piece finished
with a rhythmic
section in which
Morris humor
ously incorporat-

Ed a semi-disguised time-step, a basic of
tap dance vocabulary, into his elegant
work of art.
The second piece of the evening,
"Violet Cavern," began with a darker
theme, color scheme and even haunt
ing music. Rectangles with webbed
black lines resembling broken mirrors
were suspended in the air, filling the
top of the stage space. Dancers slith
ered upstage, lying on their backs and
propelling themselves with their feet.

Morris' witty
choreogra
phy called for
the dancers
to lie flat on
their backs,
heads closest
to the audi
ence, cul
minating in
a full body
rolling exit

to the sound of a drum roll.
This world on stage kept changing:
Different moods of music coupled
with corresponding colored lights es
tablished atmospheres such as grave
yard gray and jamming red. What
made this piece logical, manageable
and pleasing to watch was Morris'
method of building his movement.
Each of several shapes or series of

steps was introduced and then repeat
ed in different places in the dance,
such as a swipe of the hand over the
face that is ballet mime for "die."
By the end, the audience had
learned an entire new vocabulary
of steps specific to this piece. The
final sections incorporated and re
inforced all this information. Many
steps were presented together in an
asymmetrical manner that was har
monious and familiar enough to
make the effect complex but not
overwhelming. It made perfect
sense, and it was thrilling to be able
to follow along and understand it.

Mark Morris Dance Group will be
performing a different program, in
cluding a world premiere, at Zeller
bach Hall in Berkeley through Oct. 30.
