# Emerson rocks the casbah (and Dink)
## 
### NICHOLAS CASEY INTERMISSION WRITER 
The four rock stars
of classical music —
the Emerson String
Quartet — can't ever
quite bring them
selves to smash their
instruments on the
stage at the end of a
show. Some things are
just too ingrained to
let go. But somehow,
that's always been the
story of western classi
cal music, granted, a
400-year-old test tube
of artistic experimen
tation, but one which
just can't let go of an
old thing.
Take the string
quartet for example.
Invented by Haydn
when a whim led the
maestro to add a

viola to his trios, it became Jhe topic of
conversation that no musician was
able to change since. Three centuries
later, it is still haunting the pens of
composers today.
Consider the bow ties and the coat
tails. They appear on the stage like
some preserved specimen from a for
mal past, from days when music
wasn't played in anything less than an
ascot and wig. Why?
When Emerson, joined by Jeffrey
Kahane, played in Dink last Saturday
night, they did what they do best —
they breathed life back into the past.
They are the masters of this kind of
CPR. taking those old husks of yes
terday's scores and recasting them
with a certain legerdemain into some
thing once again palatable for the
modern man.
Somehow, Emerson dished up
these old tunes in a way which made
you wish that you could revive those
arcane steps that guided the trio of the
third movement, giving a kind of nec
essary motion to the counterpoint
that dangled between the viola and
second violin at the end of the finale,
Benjamin Britten's second quartet
pushed us further down the time con
tinuum bul still kept us in that realm
of antiquated things — the 1945 quar
tet. under Emerson's aegis, forced the
ear into the landscape of a composer
who'd just pulled through a second
world war on his continent and was
still living to write after it. Despite the
gray specter which haunted nearly all

creative people from that place and
time, the quartet nevertheless seems
to be about hope, not just for the
British musical tradition that Britten
would revive on his island, but more
so for that hope that seems as perti
nent again now as it was in the nine
teen-forties: Hope that civilization it
self will continue, that some sem
blance of a musical tradition will sur
vive into the next generation despite
the pessimistic trappings of times.
Folks usually blame classical
music for being too old fashioned, too
sluggish in its approach of the present,
if it even has one at all. With Mozart,
Brahms and Britten heard that night,
it's true that those looking for the con
temporary should have looked else
where. But that four-part invention of
Haydn, those indestructible stringed
instruments, the bow-tied heirlooms
of a static uniform — these things are
necessary somehow. Chamber music
— the string quartet in particular —
works as a kind of memory in many
ways, a common place no one ever re
ally leaves, where composers post
notes for each other and for their au
diences: The logic of a minuet by
Mozart, revived 200 years later by
Emerson.

The four rock stars
of classical music —
the Emerson String
Quartet — can't ever
quite bring them
selves to smash their
instruments on the
stage at the end of a
show. Some things are
just too ingrained to
let go. But somehow,
that's always been the
story of western classi
cal music, granted, a
400-year-old test tube
of artistic experimen
tation, but one which
just can't let go of an
old thing.
Take the string
quartet for example.
Invented by Haydn
when a whim led the
maestro to add a

viola to his trios, it became Jhe topic of
conversation that no musician was
able to change since. Three centuries
later, it is still haunting the pens of
composers today.
Consider the bow ties and the coat
tails. They appear on the stage like
some preserved specimen from a for
mal past, from days when music
wasn't played in anything less than an
ascot and wig. Why?
When Emerson, joined by Jeffrey
Kahane, played in Dink last Saturday
night, they did what they do best —
they breathed life back into the past.
They are the masters of this kind of
CPR. taking those old husks of yes
terday's scores and recasting them
with a certain legerdemain into some
thing once again palatable for the
modern man.
Somehow, Emerson dished up
these old tunes in a way which made
you wish that you could revive those
arcane steps that guided the trio of the
third movement, giving a kind of nec
essary motion to the counterpoint
that dangled between the viola and
second violin at the end of the finale,
Benjamin Britten's second quartet
pushed us further down the time con
tinuum bul still kept us in that realm
of antiquated things — the 1945 quar
tet. under Emerson's aegis, forced the
ear into the landscape of a composer
who'd just pulled through a second
world war on his continent and was
still living to write after it. Despite the
gray specter which haunted nearly all

creative people from that place and
time, the quartet nevertheless seems
to be about hope, not just for the
British musical tradition that Britten
would revive on his island, but more
so for that hope that seems as perti
nent again now as it was in the nine
teen-forties: Hope that civilization it
self will continue, that some sem
blance of a musical tradition will sur
vive into the next generation despite
the pessimistic trappings of times.
Folks usually blame classical
music for being too old fashioned, too
sluggish in its approach of the present,
if it even has one at all. With Mozart,
Brahms and Britten heard that night,
it's true that those looking for the con
temporary should have looked else
where. But that four-part invention of
Haydn, those indestructible stringed
instruments, the bow-tied heirlooms
of a static uniform — these things are
necessary somehow. Chamber music
— the string quartet in particular —
works as a kind of memory in many
ways, a common place no one ever re
ally leaves, where composers post
notes for each other and for their au
diences: The logic of a minuet by
Mozart, revived 200 years later by
Emerson.
