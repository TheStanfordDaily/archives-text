## J.E.W. review 
### 
If there's one thing we didn't learn in
PWR it's to consider the audience when writ
ing. Thus, instead of reviewing Jimmy Eat
World's latest album "Futures" for one
generic audience, we've decided to provide
mini-reviews for all relevant groups. If you
don't identify with any of these categories...
well, sucks for you.
The Indie rock elitist: If you scoff at pop
punk, reject mainstream culture and consider
Fugazi to be the final authority on all that is
good in the world, then you probably aren't
reading this article. But if for some reason
you are. we recommend you give "Futures" a
whirl. Their tunes are pretty catchy, and if
you block out the sophomoric lyrics you
might even enjoy a tune or two. This is your
last chance... soon one or more of their
songs will explode into "The Middle" status
and you'll have to pretend you've hated the
music all along. Now continue to pretend that
you don't shop at Urban Ou'fitters.
Diehard JEW fans: If you've been listening
to JEW since "Static Prevails," then you
probably fall into this category. The general
consensus among your kind is that "Clarity"
is the pinnacle of JEW's musical abilities, and
that "Bleed American" was OK. not great. If
you're looking fora ballad that rivals "Just
Watch the Fireworks" or "For Me This Is
Heaven," don't look here. "Drugs Or Me"
and "23" lack passion and suffer from over
production. The cheesy synth violins just
don't cut it. If you're looking for the driving
intensity that was "Lucky Denver Mint" or
"Crush" — look elsewhere.
But hey, maybe you're not interested in
making comparisons and would rather view
"Futures" as its own entity. Check out "Pain"
and "Nothing Wrong," which are packed
with equal parts angst, energy and passion.
Then bitch about how JEW's shows are too
expensive and how back in the day you could

Please set- Jimmy, page CONCLUSION
