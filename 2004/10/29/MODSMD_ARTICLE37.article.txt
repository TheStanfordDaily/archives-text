# Majoring in Rockstar Studies
## Part Two: The Mae Shi 
### BONNIE JOHNSON INTERMISSION ROCKER-IN-TRAINING 
They appear in fanzines; they tour incessantly; they sleep on my couch. Who are these mysterious stars of the un
derground? Stanford gratis.
It's a little known fact rock lives here at Stanford and that at least a few here live to rock. A couple of my recent
ly graduated friends have pursued their music like the crazy folks they are and made it in their respective scenes
thanks to distinctive styles and a whole lot of hard work. This week: The Mae Shi.
With L. A. written all over them, The Mae Shi are masters of the experimental, anarchic and frenetic. Jeff Byron,
the lead guitarist, graduated from Stanford in2002. Davyde '\Dayv" Wachell, who graduated from Stanford in 2003,
has been touring with The Mae Shi as their videographer. These guys belong to the new school of rock icons: They
are huge tech geeks. At Stanford. Jeff majored in music, science and technology and did his senior project on spec
tral analysis of heartbeats fora medical device. Dayv majored in Symbolic Systems and used to program robots.
This past year, The Mae Shi signed to Kill Rock Stars' sister label 5 Rue Qiristine and released the "Terrorbird"
LP, a terrific feat of ADD: 33 tracks in 42 minutes. The record has more in common with "Trout Mask Replica"
than just about anything; it's not hard to hear "Power to the Power. Bite 2" as the belated (il)logical conclusion of
"Hair Pie: Bake!"
Building their own equipment, collecting mix tapes from fans and crashing other people's special occasions are
among favorite Mae Shi pastimes. The band just finished its Celebration tour on which it used every special event
as an excuse to play: housewarmings. going away parties, birthdays, Tuesdays.
The Mae Shi played the Boston area the evening before I left my apartment in Jiimaica Plain. Our night was a
monumental fiasco involving towed cars, wrong turns, lots of packing and an unspeakably awkward incident with
strangers in a bar.

The show itself was a condensed festival of hyperactivity and sci-fi animal noise. The band definitely
caught a few members of the audience off guard, but the crowd was down for the most part. "I think some people
are offended by the wireless guitar," Jeff told me.
INTERMISSION: So you guys consider yourselves pretty big geeks?
MAE SHL Yeah. We toured fora while with a band called Fat Day—you saw them, they were those guys in the
homemade soldered transistor helmets - they're all lawyers and stuff. We went to their house on one of our tour
stops and hooked up like nine computers to all play video games with each other. You know, we're a rock band. We
have a lot of rockin' parties. No groupies, just video games.
INT: What was the worst show on your Celebration tour?


Due to a loss of gravitational pull, the Mei-Shi have taken a turn for the
bizarro. Did you actually read this? Dumbass.
MAE SHI: We played in Salt Lake
City, and like two people showed
up. They tried to tell us that Salt
Lake City is "diverse" and "hip."
INT: How about the best show?
MAE SHI: We had a great show
in Summerville, S.C.; we couldn't
have predicted that. A ton of punk
kids came out and were totally
into it. It's not really about having
a big city so much as having one
good venue and one good promot
er. We also had a great New
Year's themed party in Olympia,
in keeping with the celebration
idea. It was at Lucky Five, and all
the Kill Rock Stars folks were
there. They counted down be
tween songs; it was a lot of fun.
INT: Any other tour highlights?
MAE SHI: We visited Jeff's grand
ma in rural Pennsylvania, and she
made us awesome apple pie. She
wanted a picture with Dayv, even

though he doesn't play in the band,
"cause he looks the most like a rock
star.
INT: What are you guys working on
now?
MAE SHI: We've got a music video
DVD coming out soon.
INT: Dayv, do you think you'll keep
working with The Mae Shi?
MAESH: Hard to say how involved
I'll be. But I left my job in invest
ment portfolio management to do

this —
thank
God.

Great show

INTERMISSION: So you guys consider yourselves pretty big geeks?
MAE SHL Yeah. We toured fora while with a band called Fat Day—you saw them, they were those guys in the
homemade soldered transistor helmets - they're all lawyers and stuff. We went to their house on one of our tour
stops and hooked up like nine computers to all play video games with each other. You know, we're a rock band. We
have a lot of rockin' parties. No groupies, just video games.
INT: What was the worst show on your Celebration tour?


Due to a loss of gravitational pull, the Mei-Shi have taken a turn for the
bizarro. Did you actually read this? Dumbass.
MAE SHI: We played in Salt Lake
City, and like two people showed
up. They tried to tell us that Salt
Lake City is "diverse" and "hip."
INT: How about the best show?
MAE SHI: We had a great show
in Summerville, S.C.; we couldn't
have predicted that. A ton of punk
kids came out and were totally
into it. It's not really about having
a big city so much as having one
good venue and one good promot
er. We also had a great New
Year's themed party in Olympia,
in keeping with the celebration
idea. It was at Lucky Five, and all
the Kill Rock Stars folks were
there. They counted down be
tween songs; it was a lot of fun.
INT: Any other tour highlights?
MAE SHI: We visited Jeff's grand
ma in rural Pennsylvania, and she
made us awesome apple pie. She
wanted a picture with Dayv, even

though he doesn't play in the band,
"cause he looks the most like a rock
star.
INT: What are you guys working on
now?
MAE SHI: We've got a music video
DVD coming out soon.
INT: Dayv, do you think you'll keep
working with The Mae Shi?
MAESH: Hard to say how involved
I'll be. But I left my job in invest
ment portfolio management to do

this —
thank
God.

Great show


This is a happy saw.
