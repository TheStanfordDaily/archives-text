# ELLIOTT SMITH REBORN IN 'BASEMENT'
## 
### SAM TANZER INTERMISSION MUSIC HISTORIAN 
Elliott Smith was 34 when he died last
October from two stab wounds to the chest.
But the most surprising thing about his
death may have been its complete inability
to surprise.
To many, Smith's death felt sickeninglv
inevitable: the action of a heart-bound
thrust of a knife became the ultimate vali
dation of the artist's grim lyrics. Suicide
seemed so appropriate that no one — in
cluding the Los Angeles police — gave the
matter a second thought. But months later,
ominous rumors and an inconclusive coro
ner's report left fans with nothing but dull
grief and irresolution. He had lived out the
logical conclusion of his lyrics, and his sad
ness was now theirs.
Smith's greatest gift to the world may
well have been this sadness, this grim
melancholy and an uncanny ability to turn
an excruciating song about addiction and
alienation into something tuneful and sub
lime. He smothered his gritty lyrics with
folk-pop kisses and masked his desperation
in Beatles-esque melodies and disembod
ied "oohs" and "aahs."
To some. Smith sounded like a ghost
while he was still alive. But in his posthu
mous album, a familiar cold wind seems to
blow through his teeth with renewed force;
no cheery melody can obscure the disheart
ening honesty of the lyrics.
Released just days before the one year
anniversary of his death, "From a Base
ment on the Hill" is perhaps most remark
able for what it is not: It is not a perfect
album — it isn't even one of Smith's best
— and it doesn't break much new ground.
More of a combination of 2000's heavily
electrified Figure 8 and 1997's acoustic con
fessional, "Either/Or," "From a Base
ment" offers a variety of musical styles
while maintaining a coherence and cohe
siveness rare in posthumous releases.
Like 1998's "XO," the album opens


strong, with a long fade into the thick
and booming "Coast to Coast" — a
haze of guitar swells, double-tracked
drums and a jumble of sound. Musi
cally, the album alternates between
the dissonant and clashing guitars of
"Strung out Again," the gentle fin
gerpicking of "Memory Lane" and
the upbeat acoustic harmonies of "A
Fond Farewell." The lyrics are classic
Smith — flawed, courageous and
sometimes harrowing in their por
trait of a fractured self.
"Rretty/Ugly Before" fuses lyrical
optimism with despair — the open
ing lyric, "Sunshine/ Been keeping
me up for Days / There is no night
time / It's only a passing phase" gives
way to a more depressive refrain, "I
felt so ugly before / 1 didn't know
what to do." But in characteristic
fashion, Smith endlessly repeats the
line, adding warmth and harmony
each time until it becomes somehow
affirming and comforting in the inti
macy of repetition. In other places,
not even Smith's Beatlesque sensibil
ities can hide his bleak fatalism and
vulnerability to the seductions of

oblivion.
In "Strung Out Again," Smith de
clares that "I know how I begin, and
how I'll end / Strung out Again." Es
pecially given the release date of the
album, it's sometimes hard to ignore
lyrics like those in the album's
strongest track, "King's Crossing": "I
can't prepare for death any more
than I already have."
Dissonant and abstracted, frac
tured and melancholy, Smith's new
album probably won't win him many
new fans, but it won't alienate any of
the old ones either. It's difficult not
to romanticize an artist's suicide, es
pecially when it is so strongly fore
grounded in his lyrics. But as Smith
takes his place among troubled
brethren Nick Drake and Kurt
Cobain, we might take a moment and
remember why we listen to him in the
first place — in an era of vacuous su
perstars, Smith imbued pop music
with a meaning and intimacy all but
lost to the genre.
And if nothing else, "From a
Basement On The Hill" will remind
us why we miss him.
