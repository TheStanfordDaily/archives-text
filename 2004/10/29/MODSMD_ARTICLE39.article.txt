# Bizarro Intermission
## WHEN MONKEYS WITH TYPEWRITERS TAKE OVER INTERMISSION 
### TAM TOM INTERMISSION CO-EDITORS 
Will Oremus, editor in chief of The Stanford
Daily, recently (i.e. 3 a.m. this morning) sat down
for an interview with Intermission co-editors Tarn
Vo and Tom Hanada.
WILL: So, I just edited Intermission and I was won
dering ... Did you guys intentionally fuck up so
much? Like, more than usual?
TAM & TOM: Dude! It's the Bizarro issue of In
termission.
WILL: There's a Bizarro issue? You thought peo
ple would find it funny?

T&T: Well, not so much funny as stupid. And then
they'd laugh at the whole ineptitude of the Inter
mission staff.
WILL: So what makes this issue "Bizarro" instead
of just fucked up?
T&T: Our spread has turkeys protesting a flying
octopus! There's a piece of broccoli lifting weights.
Words are backwards! Nothing is as it seems!
WILL: I see. I'm glad that it's not just that you guys
are incompetent.
T&T: Hey now, don't say things you can't take
back.
WILL: Okay, so you are incompetent. Are you also

psychotic?
T&T: Naw, we just have
no shame and we'll do
anything to be funny.
WILL: Like Bizarro?
T&T: Or your mom.
T&T: In bed.
T&T: All night long!
WILL: You're both
fired.
T&T: Thank god.
