# ROXY SAYS: "GET THEE TO A NUNNERY!"
## 
### ROXY SASS BORN AGAIN VIRGIN 
There is more passion in a loving gaze than
there is in thrusting wildly against a sweaty body.
Handholding is a promise for the future. Roxy
wants you to seriously consider abstinence —
STDs will prevent you from forming meaningful
relationships with others. The more you spread
those legs, the less likely anyone will ever want to
marry you.

After the overwhelming lack of debauchery
at Full Moon on the Quad this year, Roxy is con
vinced that abstinence is becoming trendier than
those annoying "Live Strong" rubber bracelets.
All the cool kids are(n't) doing it, so why not ab
stain? Why not find something to do other than
the kid who lives down the hall? You might not
* even be good at it. If those dirty thoughts about
making whoopee on the top of Hoover Tower
have you all riled up and ready to fornicate, just
stare at this:

"Don't have sex, because you will
get pregnant and die! Don't have
sex in the missionary position, don't
have sex standing up, just don't do
it, okay, promise? But if you do
touch each other, you will get
Chlamydia . . . and DIE. "
