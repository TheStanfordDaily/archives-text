# The 						S-Files: The Truth is not here

### DARREN FRANICH INTERMISSION PARANOID 
I'm taking this opportunity to expose a conspiracy here on our very campus, a conspiracy that runs
deep into our administration and throughout the recent past of our beloved University.
It all clicked into place during a football game when Cbach Teevens once again brought out his sig
nature 4th-down Shotgun Draw in a desperate attempt to surprise the opposing team. And surprise
them it did: They had thought, just fora moment, that this fourth down. Buddy might do something, you
know, DIFFERENT. Nope.
Sure, Buddy's called some bad plays before, but the sheer brazen thoughtlessness of this, the phony
toughness or the crazy bravery of trying something that never works for the twenty-hundredth time,
jerked me out of my rhythm for the whole day. I got to thinking: What's the real deal with this so-called
university? I began to question the whole system.
Why, in this modern liberated age, on this campus that once housed the eminent groove-ist Ken
Kesey, did the administration recently impose strict alcohol guidelines on our loveably drunken frosh?
Why is it that, even though Branner has been refurbished for two years now, the two-room doubles that
became two-room triples during its rebuilding year are still triples? How come they almost bulldozed
Wilbur field to build a Law School dorm on undergraduate turf? Who is Laßouche, and what are his
people so angry about?
I was seeing the campus through new eyes. Crazy eyes. I began to notice all sorts of odd develop
ments and kooky coincidences. Why are there such long lines for such crappy parties? How can we have
such lovely Palm Trees on Campus Drive and such awful Rotisserie Chicken in Stern Dining? Why is
"Gladiator"' always on the DVD channel but never in Green Library?
I thought jogging around Lake Lag might calm me down, but instead it proved to be the final straw.
Check any yearbook from long ago and you'll find at least 20 pictures of lovely Lake Lagunita, complete
with young sweethearts out canoeing, students lazing in the sun and tanning on the beach (the beach!),
and, best of all, parasailing. Now it's mud. And weeds. And accursed salamanders.
I hat was it! 1 thought triumphantly. The salamanders! Those scurvy reptilian beasts — they're the
cause of all of this! The administration tried to lure them away with salamander calls, and when that
failed, the shadow-elite who control the University cut their losses and formed an unholy alliance with
demon lizards (it's true! I read it in The Progressive!).
Now they're working to drown us in absurdity and confusion. And it's working. Can't you see, it's
working! Meyer Library isn't really a library! Building 570 is really a restroom! Our mascot is a color!
Campus Loop is more of a Circlet! Film isn't a major, but medieval studies is! Think the several hun
dred tarp-covered seats in the football stadium are just covering up low attendance? THINK AGAIN!
It's all connected, it's all a part of the secret plot t0...
1 ley, what's going on here? Put me down! Quit pummeling me! Hey now fellas, we can talk about
this. OW! That was my drinking hand! What's this all about? Oh gee, I hope that syringe isn't full of
poiso-
