Last week, the Department of Public Safety slid
"The Stanford Safety and Security Almanac" under
the doors of most residents. This booklet contained
valuable information regarding bicycle safety, per
sonal protection and other situations that may arise
during the year here on The Farm. Unfortunately,
the almanac lacked one crucial entry; zombie attacks.
With recently reported outbreaks in England,
Southern California and the Meyer 24-hour study
room, the threat of zombie violence is real, and stu
dents must be prepared. The foolish undergrad who
escapes in a car will soon be stuck in traffic in either
San Jose or San Francisco while thousands of in
fected humans bash in their windshields in an all
too-easy attempt to gain access to delicious brains.
The automotive-deprived students will seek refuge
in the seemingly most secure areas on campus, most
noticeably, Stanford's large unpenetrable phallus.
At first glance. Hoover Tower offers ideal pro
tection from hordes of the undead in that it's large,
stone walls cannot be scaled or destroyed (remem
ber, zombies don't have super-human abilities —
they just don't feel pain) and its height makes it per
fect for signaling for help. But what happens after a
few days of sitting in the tower? What happens
when the food and water run out? The misinformed
fugitive of the zombie's wrath will either slowly
starve or leave the tower and become prey for die
masses of zombies waiting on the ground.
Most people neglect the importance of food and
water when considering hiding places from zombie
attacks, which is why they are destined to be con
sumed or to die the slow death of malnutrition. How
ever, all is not lost for residents of Stanford Universi
ty in case of a zombie attack. The single greatest place
to survive the carnage (that doesn't even require the
use of a "preferred year") is the fourth floor of Mir
rielees Apartments. Sure, nobody wants to live there
during our current peaceful times, but in the case of a
zombie attack, it's the most secure undergraduate
residence on campus.
Minielees Defense Plan
Stage 1: Fortify. The fourth floor of Minielees offers
some very easy fortification possibilities. The floor is
only accessible through staircases or elevators. Since
zombie attacks usually produce power outages, the ele
vators will most likely be inoperative. Also not operating
are die refrigerators and ovens within every apartment
unit These large, heavy objects can be placed in stair
wells with reinforcement from bunk bed frames, tables,
desks and bookshelves. Preliminary fortifications can be
completed within an hour. Note: Emergency evacua-

tions should consist of bed
sheet rope-ladders from
windows. Do not leave any
weaknesses in tlie block
ades for your own escape
purposes.
Sta|j*e i Supplies. This is
Mirrielees' greatest
strength. Being apart
ments, the building is
packed with enough food
to last for several weeks or
months if rationed proper
ly. Obtain a master key
from an RA and forage all
rooms for food and sup
plies. Anything that might
be useful for zombie de
fense should quickly be
brought to the fourth floor.
Abo, be prepared for die

water to be shut off at anytime so fill all bathtubs with us
able drinking water. With enough food and water, it is
po6siHe to out-wait the zombies.
Stage 3e Weapons. Stanford University has a noticeable
dearth d zombie-ready weaponry. Few students possess

shotguns or
chainsaws on
campus, but
this doesn't
mean that
weaponry
doesn't exist
With kitchens
in every Mir
rielees apart
ment there's
an enormous
supply of cook
ing knives. At-

tached to daset rods, these knives become usable spears
that can kill a zombie at a moderately safe distance. The
dose proximity erf the parking lot to the apartments also
means that several automobiles (and therefore gaso
line) are available for usage. By collecting empty beer
bottles (in no short supply on a college campus) and si
phoning a few gallons of gas, the deadly Molotov cock
tail can be produced in mass. Although these weapons
shouldn't encourage people to actively seek out and en
gage zombies, they do provide a last hne of defense from
theundead
The zombie threat is real, and if humans fail to re
spond rationally, they can easily infect large areas.
Stanford's proximity to two large urban centers (San
Francisco and San Jose) puts all of us at risk in the
event of an outbreak. But Stanford students are intel
ligent enough to survive an attack if they maintain
their composure and evaluate all options. Obviously,
Mirrielees is the primary location to form a defense,
and because of this all rational students should at
tempt to draw into Mirrielees no matter what their
number (I mean, really, 557, 808, Toyon and others
are all just open meals for zombies).
One final warning should be made if you want to
survive such an attack. Zombies were once human
and due to this you may recognize one of your at
tackers. Perhaps you'll get lucky and your assailant
will be a past TA, that bitch who wouldn't hook up
with you at Full Moon or the managing editor of
opinions and spedal sections of The Stanford Daily.
In these cases, you won't hesitate to indnerate them
with your gasoline-filled Corona. But if they are an
old friend or favorite professor, remember that
you'll be doing them a favor (or you will have just
killed an innocent person, but isn't that what killing
is all about anyway?).
