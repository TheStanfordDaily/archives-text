## ‘SAW’ THE MOVIE, DIDN'T LIKE IT 
### TOM HANADA INTERMISSION CO-EDITOR 
The movie opens with two men, Dr.
Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes— yep, it's Wes
ley from"The Princess Bride," just older and
fatter) and photographer Adam (Leigh Whan
nell) chained on opposite ends of an old bath
room. A dead body clutching a handgun lays be
tween them. Through a tape recorder. Dr. Gor
don receives the message that he must kill Adam
or his wife and daughter will die. The two men are
each given a hack-saw that is too weak to cut

through the
chain, but
strong
enough to
cut through
their own
foot.
This may
not sound
like enough
plot to fill
100 minutes,
but "SAW"
manages to
pass the time
with poorly
introduced
backstory
about the
past mur
ders com-

mitted by the film's deranged antagonist. Throw
in the seemingly pointless role of Danny Glover
as the obsessive police detective and the adul
terous-heavy relationships of the Gordon fami
ly, and "SAW" does manage to escape from the
dirty bathroom.
In regards to its premise, "SAW" is nothing
but a poorly contrived replication of David
Fincher's "Se7en" starring Morgan Freeman
and Brad Pitt. Both movies use nearly omni
scient killers who develop ingeniously horrific
ways to torture and murder their victims. The
psychotic killer also has some lesson he hopes

to teach humanity through the suffering in
flicted upon those unfortunate enough to he
come his victims. Only "Se7en" utilized much
stronger characters, a tighter script and ex
ceptional actors.
Leigh Whannell (who also wrote the screen
play) alternates between a whiner and a tough
guy who's almost too cool to be locked up in a

bathroom where he needs to
hack-saw off his foot. It's difficult
to tell if he's completely unsympa
thetic because his character was
written with no distinct personali
ty or history or if he just simply
cannot act well enough to make
the audience believe him.
Either way, as the writer and
actor, it is his fault. Even Cary
Elwes — who is an accomplished

actor — seems to hardly care about this role. He
occasionally switches between his American ac
cent and his English accent, but despite this, he
does not really understand who his character is.
Actually, the plot containing Whannell and
Elwes in the bathroom is the least interesting
and creative part of the movie (too bad it's the
main story). The movie manages some really
creepy moments during flashbacks to past mur
ders committed by the villain.
These scenes are not only disturbing, but
they also make the audience think about how
they would react in such demented situations.
Would you cut open a living person's stomch
and sift through their intestines to find the kev

that can prevent your head from exploding?
"Se7en" excelled at interweaving these cre
ative and purposeful homicides around a plot
that delved into Freeman's and Pitt's characters.
"SAW" simply throws in these horrific scenes to
keep the audience from realizing that they real
ly don't care about anyone in this movie.
The film continuously relies on such cheap

and cliche tricks in an at
tempt to keep the audi
ence on the edge of their
seats. Luckily for the
film's makers, these
tricks almost always
work in horror effec
tively.
People in weird
masks jumping from
dark corners will always

make someone jump. Blood and organs will al
ways make someone squeamish. Plot twists
throughout will always surprise someone. And a
character using an intermittent camera flash for
a flashlight in the dark will always make the
scene more suspense even if the entire audience
can guess where the bad guy is hiding.
Really, that's all this movie is — a dark series
of horror devices. Watching "SAW" might
make you jump or squirm, hut it's only accom
plished through cheap tricks. If you want a good
Halloween flick with horrible dialogue, terrible
acting, and massive plot holes, rent some teen
slasher movie. At least then you'll see some full
frontal.

Actually, the plot containing Whannell and
Elwes in the bathroom is the least interesting
and creative part of the movie (too bad it's the
main story). The movie manages some really
creepy moments during flashbacks to past mur
ders committed by the villain.
These scenes are not only disturbing, but
they also make the audience think about how
they would react in such demented situations.
Would you cut open a living person's stomch
and sift through their intestines to find the kev

that can prevent your head from exploding?
"Se7en" excelled at interweaving these cre
ative and purposeful homicides around a plot
that delved into Freeman's and Pitt's characters.
"SAW" simply throws in these horrific scenes to
keep the audience from realizing that they real
ly don't care about anyone in this movie.
The film continuously relies on such cheap

and cliche tricks in an at
tempt to keep the audi
ence on the edge of their
seats. Luckily for the
film's makers, these
tricks almost always
work in horror effec
tively.
People in weird
masks jumping from
dark corners will always

make someone jump. Blood and organs will al
ways make someone squeamish. Plot twists
throughout will always surprise someone. And a
character using an intermittent camera flash for
a flashlight in the dark will always make the
scene more suspense even if the entire audience
can guess where the bad guy is hiding.
Really, that's all this movie is — a dark series
of horror devices. Watching "SAW" might
make you jump or squirm, hut it's only accom
plished through cheap tricks. If you want a good
Halloween flick with horrible dialogue, terrible
acting, and massive plot holes, rent some teen
slasher movie. At least then you'll see some full
frontal.

If s like "Seven," but only it sucked. Like your mother. On my stump(s). As you wish.
