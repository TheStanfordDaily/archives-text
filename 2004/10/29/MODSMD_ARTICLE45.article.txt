### ANTHONY HA ALICE KIM INTERMISSION SCI FI GURUS 
ANTHONY: I have just had my mind blown.
You heard it here first, folks — the science fiction
mindfuck masterpiece "Primer" is better than
drugs. The film takes us into the lives of su
pergeek entrepreneurs Abe and Aaron, who are
played with low-key conviction by David Sullivan
and writer / director Shane Carruth, respectively.
The pair is hard at work in Aaron's garage on
"The Box," and they eventually realize they've
inadvertently created a time machine. (Oops!)
The first half of the story unfolds clearly and
rationally — shot with a cool beauty to match —
but, as expected, everything soon goes to hell.
You realize that you've been walking along the
edge of a narrative precipice, and you don't know
when you suddenly tumbled over, much less how
to stop the fall.
ALICE: At first, Abe and Aaron play it safe
when they go back in time — holing up in a cheap
hotel room so they won't run the risk of meeting
their doubles or creating continuity errors, only
emerging to play the stock market.
Very quickly, the infinite shit hits the recursive
fan. Ladies and gentlemen, this is an honest-to-
God time-travel film, giving us a disturbing view

of how time travel would probably end up, were
it possible.
Any real sense of causality is lost — red her
rings pop up everywhere in the plot, giving you
the unnerving sense that vital information is
being withheld. Is someone else using the time
machine? What's with the random, yet seeming
ly crucial party scene?
As Abe and Aaron loop backwards in time,
you begin to feel the immensity of their dilemma
— how the threads of their narrative spiral mess
ily into infinity. The time travel ends up under
mining the structure of the entire film.

ANTHONY: By the end, there's a
strong temptation to throw thought out
the window - everything's fucked, so
why try to piece it all together? Howev
er, Carruth has assured interviewers
that there is a (hidden) logical narra
tive, and as I play the final 15 minutes
over and over in my mind, I can almost
hear the click as clues fit into place.
Some people have called "Primer"

the new "Donnie
Darko." But Richard
Kelly's circular narrative
becomes more prosaic as
repeated viewings make
things clearer, while de-

coding the intricate logic underlying
"Primer"'s dizzying plot only deep
ens my appreciation for Carruth's
imagination.
That said, the movie — which
clocks in at a lightning-fast 78 minutes — could
have definitely used another 10 minutes or so to
reduce that narrative whiplash and to give the
final scenes a bigger emotional wallop. It's a lot
harder to appreciate the richness of character and
plot detail when you're scratching your head and
saying, "Wha - ?"

Of course, the escalating confusion is part of
the fun. and may even be "Primer'"s point.
ALICE: You can enjoy the film in either way —
as a semi-avant-garde paean to time travel and
how it irredeemably fucks your life into
smithereens, OR as a solvable puzzle of a film,
convoluted yet consistent in the end. A warning:
It ain't for people who found "Memento" a har
rowing intellectual exercise.
Finally, "Primer" 1 is admirable for being a dif-

ferent kind of science
fiction film; on a budget
of $7,000, it's science
fiction in the realm of
pure thought and spec
ulation. Not to say that I
don't love comic book
films and other effects
heavy. big budget SF,
but "Primer" fills a dif
ferent niche altogether.

It's a scientist's bad dream, something wild yet
sensible and mundane (for example, they never
use the phrase "time machine" in the film) that
soon turns utterly unfixable. "Primer" neatly
proves that science fiction doesn't always need
lasers or shape-shifting computer agents to scare
the high holy hell out of you.
