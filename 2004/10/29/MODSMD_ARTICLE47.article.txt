# Intermission makes everyone happy.

"The you in the story is the Crea
ture from the Black Lagoon, the mon
ster is Frankenstein's monster,
they're both dying, and they're head
ed west."
After this introduction, senior An
thony Ha spent four minutes address
ing his audience as though it were a
pus-00/.ing beast, traveling cross
country with its decomposing pal in
search of precious water.
And just as the rains came, his time
was up. After our journey with the
monster, senior Jennifer Carr told us
about an Atkins-dieting sex addict
who spreads guacamole on his
beloved's thighs. Kent Casimir relat
ed the tale of Soupy, a dog too stoned

to swim. And Bristin Jones confided
that she likes her men like she likes
her latte, "tail and extra hot."
Under normal circumstances, such
quick cuts between alternate realities
might have given this intrepid review
er whiplash. However, I was pre
pared. Monday night was this year's
first Four Minute Reading, an event
at which brevity is quite literally the
name of the game.
Sponsored by the Creative Writing
Program and hosted by Jones Lectur
er Tom Kealey, the Four Minute
Reading Series offers Stanford under
graduate poets and fiction writers a
chance to share short snippets of their
work. Four times a year, readers gath
er in the Terrace Room of Margaret
Jacks Hall to enjoy their four minutes
of fame. They're joined by guest read

ers from the Stanford faculty and the
Visiting Writers program — this time,
Jones Lecturer Thomas McNeeley
and Koret Young Visiting Writer
Rachel Kadish.
Despite its short duration, reading
can be a heady experience.
"I almost fainted when I was up
there," Carr confided. "I've never
been that frightened doing anything
involving acting, and I've done acting
for years."
I asked senior Jennifer Kong, a
member of the Four Minute Executive
Board, why she and fellow Board mem
bers Tom Kealey and Kaily Lam held
their readers to such strict time limits.
"Because if they suck you can ...,"
she began, "just kidding."
Actually, she said, the format pro
vides an experience both satisfying and

diverse.
"You get a very varied group of
readings," she told me, "Four minutes
are short and sweet."
Indeed, each reading was just long
enough to make an impact. After Ha's
tale of monster buddies and Carr's
chronicle of support groups gone
wrong, I felt lulled into normalcy when
Thomas McNeeley delivered four
minutes of the family troubles of young
Buddy Turner. And when Malcolm
Murdock read a poem set at Menlo
Park's Cafe Borrone, I felt positively at
home.
Then Alice Kim stepped up to the
podium.
"This isn't an homage to Stanford,"
she began, "but it's probably the clos
est thing I'll ever write."
And she read about desperate stu

dents hiding out in a chemistry build
ing, cooking up drugs and playing with
batteries while zombies rampage out
side. Four minutes is enough to give
you a sense of security — and enough
to brutally destroy it.
Happy Halloween, readers. Don't
let them get you.
Monday's performers were poets Stephanie

Adams, Alex
Rosen, Bristin
Jones, and Mal
colm Murdoch

ers Anthony Ila,
