# Jenkins makes smooth transition
## 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Switching positions in football is never easy. It can
take some major adjustments. On the other hand,
Stanford junior defensive tackle Julian Jenkins will
tell you it's no big deal.
Jenkins, who moved to tackle this season after
playing defensive end the past two years, made the
transition soun#l easy.
"It wasn't that big of a change," he said. "I just had
to get bigger. 1 had to gain 20 pounds and use my
upper body strength more."
The 6-foot-4, 260-pound Jenkins has transitioned
seamlessly to his new role on the defensive line. He is
leading the Cardinal in sacks with 4.5 on the season
and is fifth in total tackles with 34. Both match his ca
reer totals coming into this season.
In his new position Jenkins gets the opportunity to
use his size and athleticism to make things happen.
"I get to do a lot more on the defense," Jenkins
said. "I get to attack more, come off blocks and make
plays. It's a lot of fun running around out there."
Jenkins has maintained his speed despite adding
the additional muscle needed to play tackle, and that
has only furthered his ability to hassle the opposition.
"We always strive to get bigger, faster, stronger,
and that's what I've gotten this year," he said.
Jenkins, who has played in all but two games in his
Stanford career, is becoming a more mature player as
well.
"I have a better sense for the game, better intu
itions about how to play the game," Jenkins said.
It has been with the help of Jenkins that the Cardf
nal have moved into the top 20 in the nation in rush
ing defense. This is compared to a season ago, when
Stanford finished in the bottom half of the Pac-10 in
the same category.
"We're more aggressive, we're more focused and
we're more accountable," he said. "If people need
sleep, we're getting the sleep. We need to get in there
and watch the film, we're getting in there and watch
ing the film."
Jenkins also credits the coaching staff and the sys
tem for the defensive unit's newfound success.
"We're buying into the system that the defensive
coaches and Coach Teevens have set up for ufc," he
said. "We're all on the same track, we're all parallel
this year."
While Jenkins acknowledges that defense is a
team effort, he has put together some great pefsonal
performances as well. His first big game came
against BYU, when he had two fumble recoveries to
go along with three tackles. At Notre Dame four
weeks later he had a season-high two sacks and seven
tackles. However, his best performance this year
came last week in a losing effort against Oregon,
when he had 10 tackles, including 2.5 behind the line
of scrimmage.
Despite the tough defeat last week, Jenkins under
stands that the team has to learn from its mistakes and
move the focus on to the next week's opponent.
'"We go in watch film and evaluate the game we
played," he said. "But then we come out here [to prac
tice] and put that out of the way; all the disappoint
ment, all the film, and get ready for the next team."
The next team for Jenkins and the Cardinal is a
tough UCLA squad that boasts a potent offensive at
tack. But Jenkins thinks that the Cardinal are ready
for the test.
"We're just going to be more focused," he said.
"Everything is coming along. We are at the point
where we are going to put the perfect game together.
It's going to happen."
It is no surprise that Jenkins is confident in his abil

ities. As the Georgia Gatorade Player of the Year, he
was one of the top recruits in the country coming out
of Woodward Academy in Atlanta.
Like a few other Stanford players, Jenkins grew up
in a football household. His father Eddie had a brief
career in the NFL, including a rookie season with the
undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins, but Jenkins says it
was his mother who pushed him into football.
"I was about eight when I started playing," he said.
"I had a lot of energy around the house, so my mom

made sure I was doing something on the side."
Jenkins has brought that energy he had growing up
to the field for Stanford, a place with enormous po
tential fora student athlete.
"You can do whatever you set out to do on Stan
ford campus, in school, on the football field, and in
life," he said.
Jenkins and the Cardinal hope that they can bring
that same mindset to the UCLA campus tomorrow, as
they seek that "perfect" game and fifth win.

'"We go in watch film and evaluate the game we
played," he said. "But then we come out here [to prac
tice] and put that out of the way; all the disappoint
ment, all the film, and get ready for the next team."
The next team for Jenkins and the Cardinal is a
tough UCLA squad that boasts a potent offensive at
tack. But Jenkins thinks that the Cardinal are ready
for the test.
"We're just going to be more focused," he said.
"Everything is coming along. We are at the point
where we are going to put the perfect game together.
It's going to happen."
It is no surprise that Jenkins is confident in his abil

ities. As the Georgia Gatorade Player of the Year, he
was one of the top recruits in the country coming out
of Woodward Academy in Atlanta.
Like a few other Stanford players, Jenkins grew up
in a football household. His father Eddie had a brief
career in the NFL, including a rookie season with the
undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins, but Jenkins says it
was his mother who pushed him into football.
"I was about eight when I started playing," he said.
"I had a lot of energy around the house, so my mom

made sure I was doing something on the side."
Jenkins has brought that energy he had growing up
to the field for Stanford, a place with enormous po
tential fora student athlete.
"You can do whatever you set out to do on Stan
ford campus, in school, on the football field, and in
life," he said.
Jenkins and the Cardinal hope that they can bring
that same mindset to the UCLA campus tomorrow, as
they seek that "perfect" game and fifth win.

Junior Julian Jenkins is in his first season at defensive tackle after playing defensive end throughout his first
two seasons on the Farm. Jenkins, who credits his mom with pushing him into football, leads the Cardinal
with 4.5 sacks this season.
Switching positions in football is never easy. It can
take some major adjustments. On the other hand,
Stanford junior defensive tackle Julian Jenkins will
tell you it's no big deal.
Jenkins, who moved to tackle this season after
playing defensive end the past two years, made the
transition soun#l easy.
"It wasn't that big of a change," he said. "I just had
to get bigger. 1 had to gain 20 pounds and use my
upper body strength more."
The 6-foot-4, 260-pound Jenkins has transitioned
seamlessly to his new role on the defensive line. He is
leading the Cardinal in sacks with 4.5 on the season
and is fifth in total tackles with 34. Both match his ca
reer totals coming into this season.
In his new position Jenkins gets the opportunity to
use his size and athleticism to make things happen.
"I get to do a lot more on the defense," Jenkins
said. "I get to attack more, come off blocks and make
plays. It's a lot of fun running around out there."
Jenkins has maintained his speed despite adding
the additional muscle needed to play tackle, and that
has only furthered his ability to hassle the opposition.
"We always strive to get bigger, faster, stronger,
and that's what I've gotten this year," he said.
Jenkins, who has played in all but two games in his
Stanford career, is becoming a more mature player as
well.
"I have a better sense for the game, better intu
itions about how to play the game," Jenkins said.
It has been with the help of Jenkins that the Cardf
nal have moved into the top 20 in the nation in rush
ing defense. This is compared to a season ago, when
Stanford finished in the bottom half of the Pac-10 in
the same category.
"We're more aggressive, we're more focused and
we're more accountable," he said. "If people need
sleep, we're getting the sleep. We need to get in there
and watch the film, we're getting in there and watch
ing the film."
Jenkins also credits the coaching staff and the sys
tem for the defensive unit's newfound success.
"We're buying into the system that the defensive
coaches and Coach Teevens have set up for ufc," he
said. "We're all on the same track, we're all parallel
this year."
While Jenkins acknowledges that defense is a
team effort, he has put together some great pefsonal
performances as well. His first big game came
against BYU, when he had two fumble recoveries to
go along with three tackles. At Notre Dame four
weeks later he had a season-high two sacks and seven
tackles. However, his best performance this year
came last week in a losing effort against Oregon,
when he had 10 tackles, including 2.5 behind the line
of scrimmage.
Despite the tough defeat last week, Jenkins under
stands that the team has to learn from its mistakes and
move the focus on to the next week's opponent.
'"We go in watch film and evaluate the game we
played," he said. "But then we come out here [to prac
tice] and put that out of the way; all the disappoint
ment, all the film, and get ready for the next team."
