## Diversity workshop confronts assumptions 
### JENNIE KIM RISHI NATARAJAN 
Guest speaker and facilitator Dr.
Shakti Butler greeted participants at
the "Stanford Diversity 201" work
shop with a simple question:
"Why are you here?" she asked
the audience of approximately 30
student leaders and community
members at a 90-minute workshop
that was part of a four-hour pro
gram.
During the workshop, students
were directed to partner up and en
gage in a discussion regarding mat
ters of cultural identity in society.
The event was sponsored by Stan
ford's six community centers "as a
way to come together to build
bridges across all communities,"
said Frances Morales, the director of
El Centro Chicano.
The six community centers are
the Asian American Activities Cen
ter, the Black Community Services
Center, El Centro Chicano, the Les
bian, Gay, Bisexual. Transgender
Community Resource Center, the
Native American Culture Center
and the Women's Community Cen
ter.
For the first exercise, Butler
called on students to define the
meaning of their names. Butler also
asked students to identify a hero
within their cultures. Many students
cited their relatives, but some also
cited famous figures like feminist
Gloria Steinem.
Butler, a documentary filmmak
er and the executive director of the
non-profit organization World
Trust, led participants through a se
ries of questions in a group dialogue
that focused on bridge building in a
diverse society. She called the act of
questioning a "dynamic leadership
strategy" critical to understanding
social differences.
"We all judge; we are meaning
making machines," Butler said.
"We're constantly making meaning
of things with no evidence whatso
ever."
Morales said leadership develop
ment was a major goal of the work

shop.
"Leadership requires good com
munication skills, and understand
ing differences, understanding that
everybody has something of value to
contribute is a part of that," she said.
The workshop was followed by a
break for dinner and then a public
lecture and dialogue led by Butler.
The lecture began with a discus
sion of what Butler termed her
"Transformative Learning Theory,"
which she said involved "getting at
those core assumptions that we
make everyday."
"Through that, we discover 'dis
orienting dilemmas,' which is when
you find out that the world is not set
up like you thought it was," she said.
She compared the experience of
having one's assumptions chal
lenged to a house in which a piece of
the foundation has been removed.
"My hope is that we never get
comfortable, because this topic
makes us constantly reevaluate who
we are and how we fit into society
with others."
In between the two parts of her
lecture, Butler showed her docu
mentary, "Light in the Shadows,"
which portrays open discussions of
race in modern America between 10
different women of various races.
Coterminal student Donielle
Newell, a staff member at the Black
Community Services Center, said
the program touched on many issues
relevant to life at Stanford and be
yond.
"I would be here regardless of my
staff position," Newell said. "I'm al
ways interested in issues of diversity
— they're always important, and
there's always more to learn. I think
we're constantly judging and reeval
uating each other and comparing
[others'] worldview to our own."
She continued later, "We are full of
judgments — we can be open mind
ed, and we can also be very clear
about our own worldview; we're
complex beings."

cal science major, said he attended
