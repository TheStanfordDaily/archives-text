### JEFFREY ERFE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Citing the success of the Cam
paign for Undergraduate Educa
tion, University President John
Hennessy discussed at yesterday's
Faculty Senate meeting the estab
lishment of a new Commission on
Graduate Education to maintain the
vitality of Stanford's graduate pro
grams.
"The mission of the newly estab
lished Commission on Graduate Ed
ucation is to consider the question of
how we might enhance graduate ed
ucation at Stanford," said President
Hennessy. "Analogous to the CUE,
which has brought sweeping and
lasting changes, our goal here is to
ensure that Stanford stays at the
forefront of meeting the needs of its

graduate students as well."
The Senate also discussed the
creation of a new interdisciplinary
graduate program, the Institute for
Computational Mathematics and
Engineering.
The Commission on Graduate
Education will be comprised of the
dean of research, a former chair of
the University Board of Trustees,
graduate students, a staff member
and faculty representatives from the
seven graduate schools. Chuck Hol
loway of the Graduate School of
Business will serve as chair.
"We're all very excited about the
opportunity this commission pre
sents," Holloway said. "It's a good
start."
Holloway emphasized that al
though he has already consulted
with the deans of the seven graduate

schools, he needs more feedback to
make this initiative a success. He
said he hopes to discuss topics in
graduate education with senate
members in each school, faculty,
alumni and individual students.
The CGE is charged with six spe
cific responsibilities to fulfill its
Charge: to articulate an overall vi
sion of how graduate education
might be enhanced over the next five
years; to review the scope and na
ture of Stanford's Ph.D. and profes
sional degree programs; to better
conceptualize the "professional is
sues" and career choices graduate
students are likely to face; to incor
porate graduate students' desires for
educational opportunities stretching
above and beyond their individual
programs or schools; to explore fur
ther possibilities in cross-disci

plinary learning and research; and to
continue to refine its policies and
practices to ensure that its mission
stays relevant and effective.
To accomplish these tasks, the
CGE will first gather information on
the status of its graduate programs,
the expected future careers of cur
rent graduate students and the over
all graduate experience at Stanford.
Hennessy said that the new com
mission will stay in close consulta
tion with the heads of the seven
graduate schools throughout the
year.
One of the specific issues that
arose about the future of Stanford's
graduate programs was Harvard's
plans to establish a School of Engi
neering and the competition for en-
