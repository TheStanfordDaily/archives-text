# Zimbardo faults Rumsfeld for Abu Ghraib
## 
### JESSICA ZHANG 
Were the prison guards at the infamous Abu
Ghraib prison in Iraq inherently sadistic, or were
they influenced by their environment?
Although this question and the infamous Abu
Ghraib atrocities are no longer seen in national
headlines, they were very much on the minds of
those who attended Prof. Phillip G. Zimbardo's
lecture entitled "The Psychology of 'Evil' and the
Politics of Fear" last night.
Zimbardo, also described his experiences as an
expert witness in the trial of Staff Sergeant Ivan
"Chip" Frederick during his lecture in Kresge Au
ditorium.
The lecture, which ran almost an hour over
schedule, covered a variety of topics. During the
first part of his talk, Zimbardo used his notorious
1971 Stanford prison experiment to explain the
"hows" and "whys" of the Abu Ghraib scandal.
The second part dealt with the psychological di
mensions of the war on terror and the Bush Ad
ministration's use of fear in manipulating the
American people.
Psychologically, there are three conventionally
accepted reasons that people commit violence,
Zimbardo said. These reasons are dispositional
factors, such as personal pathologies or character
defects; situational factors, when the individual is
influenced by those around him; or systemic fac
tors, which are the political, strategic or economic
context in which a crime is committed.
Zimbardo challenged the dispositional notion
of "bad apples" and stated that situational influ
ences are more powerful because they involve the
"diffusion of responsibility." He claimed that the
latter occurred at Abu Ghraib because the guards
were corrupted by the behaviors of their peers.
"People are willing to do things they ordinarily
would not," Zimbardo said. "Any of us are vul
nerable to these social psychological effects, and
only by awareness can we learn to resist them."
Zimbardo showed pictures of the Abu Ghraib
atrocities as well as a video of his own Stanford
Prison Experiment, conducted in 1971. He re
marked upon the process that turned ordinary col
lege students into brutal jail guards in his experi
ment.
He compared both situations to William Gold
ing's novel, "Lord of the Flies."
"Changing one's external appearances can

trigger violence even in good boys because of the
destructive power of anonymity," he said, refer
ring to the events of the novel.
In the Stanford Prison Experiment, he dis
cussed the deindividualization of student jail
guards, who wore the same uniforms and sunglass
es; the dehumanization of the student prisoners,
whose identities were reduced to prisoner num
bers and ankle chains; and the power difference es
tablished by the rules of the experiment between
the student prison guards and the prisoners.
Zimbardo said the conditions in Abu Ghraib
were ripe for abuse. He pointed to situational sim
ilarities between Abu Ghraib and his prison ex
periment â€” American jail guards wore the same
uniforms and Iraqi prisoners were carted around
with bags on their head to erase their humanity.
Jail guards such as Frederick worked 12-hour
night shifts, seven days a week for 40 days without
a break. Frederick was responsible for 1,000 pris
oners, 12 army reserve guards and 60 Iraqi police
men. There was a constant fear of attack as well as
prison riots, and when Frederick complained,
Zimbardo said, he was reprimanded.
This was a "failure of leadership," Zimbardo
claimed, because there was no training available,
no supervision or oversight and no accountability
in how the prison was run. He also said he be
lieved that the practice of using dogs to intimidate

prisoners, forcing prisoners to strip and depriving
prisoners of sleep, were "all authorized from the
top down" by military intelligence, the CIA. Don
ald Rumsfeld and others.
He also addressed the question of what the sol
diers were thinking when they took "trophy pho
tos" of Iraqi prisoners, such as the infamous photo
of Private Lyndie England giving a "thumbs up"
over a pile of naked Iraqis.
"The soldiers were not thinking," he said.
"They were trapped in a state of deindividualiza
tion. They could act and feel, but could not think."
After a short break, Zimbardo delved into the
second part of his lecture on psychological dimen
sions of the war on terror.
He presented his hypothesis that the Bush ad
ministration manipulated national fear and anxi
ety caused by the Sept. 11th attacks to serve its
own political ambitions. It is similar to the "strict
father family metaphor" of "father knows best,"
he added, where the world is seen as dangerous
and citizens need the protection of a strong, pow
erful, moral father to defend them.
Furthermore. Zimbardo alleged that the ad
ministration is purposely instilling fear through
the Homeland Security Advisory System's color
code so that it can create an increased need for se-
