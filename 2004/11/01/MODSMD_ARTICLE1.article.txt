# Wisse: 'politics of blame' dogs Israel
## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA ANDREW BURMON 
Harvard professor Ruth Wisse
said on Friday that Israelis should
not be blamed for the hardships of
Palestinians in a talk that focused on
a speech last week by pro-Palestin
ian activist and Holocaust survivor
Hedy Epstein. On-campus flyers ad
vertising Epstein's speech two
weeks ago compared images of Jews
in Nazi Germany to Palestinians at
Israeli security check points.
The event was sponsored by
Chabad at Stanford, in conjunction
with the Jewish Law Students Asso
ciation. Jewish Med Students Asso
ciation, Jewish Business Association
and Israel Peace Initiative.
"We felt a speech by Professor
Wisse would be a constructive re
sponse to the events," said Rabbi
Dov Greenberg, director of Chabad
at Stanford.
Greenberg told The Daily that
Wisse's talk was not intended to di
rectly refute Epstein's, although in a
press release about Wisse's talk
Greenberg said that "students are
clearly outraged about Hedy Ep
stein's remarks."
While her audience ate Challah

bread and drank champagne for the
Kiddush, Wisse discussed the ori
gins and effects of anti-Semitism.
Her most pointed remarks related
to the current political situation be
tween Israel and the Palestinians.
"Of course the Palestinian peo
ple suffer — it is genuine, it is unde
niable, they can't advance; the Jews
would love to cure that suffering,
but it is not a problem that the Jews
created, and it is not a problem that
the Jews can solve," she said. "The
Jews want to do anything to accom
modate at any price, but this will not
solve the problem. We can not af
ford to do this, it does not help."
One student asked Wisse about
the extent of Israel's mistakes in its
treatment of Palestinians.
"Could we do it better? Of
course, but the one thing we cannot
bear is one who believes that we are
responsible for the suffering of the
Palestinians," Wisse said. "People
who believe this are lying, and that
lie is disastrous for both Jews and
Palestinians."
Wisse placed blame instead on
the Arab world and on Palestinian
politics.

Students in Art Prof. Matt Kahn's "Art 60: Design I" class displayed
their Jack -o-Lanterns last night at Kahn's house.
"Why have the Palestinians insisted
on keeping refugees?" she asked.
"The greatest scandal is that the
Palestinians have allowed their peo
ple to remain refugees. This is not a
creation of Israel, it is a creation of
Arab rulers."
Wisse said the Arab world con
tinuously launches attacks against
the Jews, who remain silent and
want to be accepted. She said this at
tempt to "be nice" has led many
Jews to willingly accept responsibili
ty for the Palestinian suffering.
"Anyone who takes responsibili
ty for something that they neither
did nor can correct is adding to the
sum of the evil. The Arab rulers are
responsible for the Palestinian con
flict, and they have to resolve this
problem."
Before the speech, Greenberg
acknowledged that Wisse would be
dealing with a sensitive subject.
"Religion is like a fire, " said
Rabbi Greenberg. "It is warm, but it
can burn."
The evening began with opening
prayers and the Kiddush. After sit
ting down to dinner, Greenberg in
troduced Wisse, calling her the "roar
ing intellectual jet of our time who
has thundered the Jewish world."
At the beginning of her speech.
Wisse emphasized the importance
of the Jewish Diaspora and the Jew
ish state in international political
history. She later described the Jew
ish Diaspora as a unique political ex
periment with unique political con
sequences.
"The Jews determined to live as a
people, a national community with
out the three staples of national exis
tence — without land, without a
central political authority, and with
out the means of self defense," she
said.
"The Jews succeeded because of
a combination of flexibility and in
flexibility — they learned to accom
modate to local political rules and
made themselves useful while still
remaining loyal to the Jewish reli
gion and adopting a pledge of alle
giance to the Jewish homeland."
This political experiment. Wisse

asserted, was temporary. She said
the Jews became a "convenient
scapegoat, a visible and attractive
target with no cost to be paid for
their destruction."
With the eruption of anti-Semi
tism in the beginning of the 19th cen
tury, Wisse said, European politi
cians adopted a "politics of blame"
to secure their political power.
"The politics of blame organized
an opposition to democracy; anti-
Semitism is anti-democratic," she
said. "Zionism rose as a means of es
caping it — the only solution to the
problem of European anti-Semitism

Jewish groups invite speaker
after heated talk last week

was to normalize the Jewish situa
tion once and for all by returning to
Israel. However, what no one fore
saw was that the politics of blame
had assumed a life of its own — the
Jews fulfilled that capacity to /the
Muslim and Arab rulers."
Wisse argued that the opposition
to the Jews was the one thing tfhat
the Arab world had in commoufthe
center of Arab politics became'anti-
Semitism.
"Arab rulers accused Jews of
denying the Arabs land and held Is
rael responsible for every problem
that the Arabs created."
