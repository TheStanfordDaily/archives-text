# Wisse: 'politics of blame' dogs Israel

### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA ANDREW BURMON 
Harvard professor Ruth Wisse
said on Friday that Israelis should
not be blamed for the hardships of
Palestinians in a talk that focused on
a speech last week by pro-Palestin
ian activist and Holocaust survivor
Hedy Epstein. On-campus flyers ad
vertising Epstein's speech two
weeks ago compared images of Jews
in Nazi Germany to Palestinians at
Israeli security check points.
The event was sponsored by
Chabad at Stanford, in conjunction
with the Jewish Law Students Asso
ciation. Jewish Med Students Asso
ciation, Jewish Business Association
and Israel Peace Initiative.
"We felt a speech by Professor
Wisse would be a constructive re
sponse to the events," said Rabbi
Dov Greenberg, director of Chabad
at Stanford.
Greenberg told The Daily that
Wisse's talk was not intended to di
rectly refute Epstein's, although in a
press release about Wisse's talk
Greenberg said that "students are
clearly outraged about Hedy Ep
stein's remarks."
While her audience ate Challah

bread and drank champagne for the
Kiddush, Wisse discussed the ori
gins and effects of anti-Semitism.
Her most pointed remarks related
to the current political situation be
tween Israel and the Palestinians.
"Of course the Palestinian peo
ple suffer â€” it is genuine, it is unde
niable, they can't advance; the Jews
would love to cure that suffering,
but it is not a problem that the Jews
created, and it is not a problem that
the Jews can solve," she said. "The
Jews want to do anything to accom
modate at any price, but this will not
solve the problem. We can not af
ford to do this, it does not help."
One student asked Wisse about
the extent of Israel's mistakes in its
treatment of Palestinians.
"Could we do it better? Of
course, but the one thing we cannot
bear is one who believes that we are
responsible for the suffering of the
Palestinians," Wisse said. "People
who believe this are lying, and that
lie is disastrous for both Jews and
Palestinians."
Wisse placed blame instead on
the Arab world and on Palestinian
politics.
