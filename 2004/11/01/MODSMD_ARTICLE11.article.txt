# Playing it Straight
## Bamboozled with 'Pieces of Ash' 
### 
Normally we wouldn't dare ride
out a theme, but after the over
whelming mediocrity of last
week's column (the first one we weren't
sent hate mail about) we have decided
to toss a few more unlikely stories of in
spiration your way. This time, however,
we've decided to turn our proverbial
quills toward easing the worries of
some of our younger brethren, fresh
men.
We sympathize with those rattled,
rosy-cheeked freshmen who fly by us at
breakneck speeds in the Quad. (Write
this down: No need to Lance Arm
strong around campus. It's just school.)
The first set of midterms can be a cold
blow to the fall fantasy we live in during
the first couple weeks of college life.
New Student Orientation was filled
with raucous good (sober) times: panel
discussions on how I-HUM might (but

won't) convince
you to explore
the humanities,
engaging fol
low-up discus
sions with your
housemates
about the Real
World. CoHo
hangouts and,
maybe for the
more rebel
lious, sick (ma
Chi) parties.
College couldn't
be cooler.

But then come the midterms. These
first couple are oh-so-important. You
want to get your Stanford shindig off on
the right foot and prove to all those
naysayers that you, unlike anybody else
here, actually deserved to get in.
Some of you may have already been
bamboozled by early midterms. Some
still wait to be bamboozled.
Our message to you: Don't worry
too much about your recent or pending
bamboozlement. Life goes on. In all se
riousness, college is a place to learn and
make the most of your life as a young,
hungry, budding being. Enjoy it. Do
your best. Don't stress.
Where's our evidence? Look no fur
ther than up-and-coming, hip girl-rock
er, Ashlee Simpson. Ash is just too easy
to make fun of. In case you haven't
heard yet, she was recently caught
shamelessly lip-synching on Saturday
Night Live. Unfortunately for her. it
turned out to be quite shameful.
If one of us were her father (hell,
even if we both were), we would be em
barrassed. Luckily, her real dad spends
most of his time spouting conservative
dogma while wearing sheik getups and
parading his daughters around as sex
objects (bless his heart). The guy is an
oxymoron.
But the big question here is how
things could have gone so awry on SNL.
Lome Michaels doesn't generally mess
around. It's tough to believe that his
sound guys could have legitimately
screwed up.
Well, they didn't. In fact, the plot
here is thicker than a burly beef brisket.
Remember a couple weeks back
when there were some crazy rumors
after the presidential debate that Bush
was wired to a radio transmitter that
was allegedly feeding his hungry intel
lect with much-needed answers? You
probably dismissed this as ridiculous.
However, this whole Ashlee fiasco
should make you reconsider.
Here's what happened: Bush was
supposed to be fed some lines, but
Lome Michaels, on a whimsical liberal
bent, managed to get behind the scenes
and mix up the tapes. Only he mixed up
the wrong tapes. Call it a remix, if you
will. A megamix!
As it turns out. Bush actually ended
up listening to the tape that was sup
posed to be played on SNL during Ash
lee's supposed "second song" (we don't
believe she has more than one).
In her defense, Ashlee said on her
own Web site: "There's (sic] too many
important people behind my career to
stop it now." Funny. Ash has her dad /
manager. Bush has Karl Rove.
The point of all this is that two
megawatt celebrities. Ash and W. both
were bamboozled in a big way on what
could be seen as career "midterms." an
SNL stint and three presidential debates,
respectively (but not respectably).
They'll be fine. Ashlee still has a hot sis
ter. W. even if he loses, still has Jesus.
You'll be fine. We're pulling for you.
Cheers to that. Vote or die.

Mark Slee and Evan Tana are voting for
A.S. (AlSharpton) come Nov. 2nd. Send
Mark pirated Ashlee mp3s at
mcslee@stanford.edu (and Evan pictures
of either AS. at etana@stanford.edu).
