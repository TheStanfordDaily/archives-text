# Political rivalry... The new dorm decoration
## 
### LAURA CARWILE 
Many freshmen come to Stanford worried that they will
not get along with their roommates because their music
tastes differ or because they have different sleeping sched
ules. But for freshmen coming into Stanford during a presi
dential election year, they have the additional concern that
their political views may clash.

"We make a conscious effort not
to make a big deal about politics,"
said freshman Lindsay Canfield, a
Republican whose roommate, Merrit
Kennedy, is a Democrat. "We're still
friends even though we have conflict
ing political views."
Where the two clash is on their
room door: Prominently displayed
are a "Kerry / Edwards: A Stronger
America" poster and a "Viva Bush:
W '04" poster.
Students advertise for their
president of choice
Students disagree on how their fel
low classmates and professors should
advertise and promote their political
preferences.
"I don't think there's anything
wrong with them," freshman Amy
Byrd said of displaying political signs.
"If I had any, I probably would too."
Mackenzie Cooper, a sophomore,
doesn't have any signs up, but like
Amy, it's just because she doesn't
have any.
"If I did, I would, especially this
close to the election, because the po
litical-slash-Democratic part of me
wants this election to go so well,"
Cooper said. "I just want people to
know how I feel about it."
Others choose not to decorate ei
ther because they don't have a strong
preference for one candidate or be
cause they are too involved in cam
paigns.

"I support political paraphernalia that portrays the
truth," said freshman Charley Meng. "I would usually have
some up, hut since I don't like either candidate 1 don't want
to support the voting of either one."
Kai Stinchcombe, a second-year grad student and presi
dent of Stanford Democrats, said that he doesn't decorate
his room with pro-Kerry signs.
"I get so much political stuff on a daily basis, it's nice to
come back to my room and have it free of politics," he said.
Stinchcombe said he owns roughly 40 to 50 pounds of
political paraphernalia that gets sent to him every day,
some of which he distributes to students and others he re
cycles.
There are, however, many students who openly display
their political preferences. John Petrofsky and John Mulrow,
two freshman roommates, have a pro-Republican door dis
play, complete with Viva Bush signs, an anti-Kerry bumper
sticker and even signs for local elections supporting Repub
lican State Assembly candidate Steve Poizner.
In response to the Kerry slogan "Let's quit using the Bush
and start using the John!" Petrofsky and Mulrow have a
bumper sticker proclaiming "Flush the Johns in 2004!"

"Nobody is really serious about making fun of our dis
play," Petrofsky said. "In fact, everyone is really respectful
about our political involvement."
Mulrow said that their display has led to productive polit
ical debates.
"If you know the issues, it's good to have political signs up
because then you give people someone to fight with," Mul
row said. "Plus, our dorm is pretty politically balanced, in-

eluding our resident advisors."
Some political paraphernalia "insult a candidate without
substance," Mulrow said. For example, Stinchcombe de
scribed a mailing he received containing posters that said,
"Dick Cheney eats babies." He rejected the posters because
there was not a political issue being discussed.
Faculty displuy political opinion
In such a close and controversial election, even some fac
ulty members publicly support certain political candidates.
Jeff Wachtel. special assistant to University President
John Hennessy, said that professors are allowed to display
political beliefs outside of the academic setting.
"In general, people, including faculty, are allowed to ex
press their views in the way they see fit as long as it is in their
own individual capacity and not as a department affiliated
with the University," Wachtel said. "They are also allowed to
post signs as long as they stay within the rules of the Univer
sity regarding where one can post signs. But the individual
content of the signs doesn't matter."
While many students said they would prefer that profes

sors keep their political beliefs outside of Stanford, several
students said they find it insightful to learn about their opin
ions.
"Teachers have equal rights as adults to post their politi
cal affiliations," Mulrow said. "But if it was one of my lectur
ers who 1 respected, it would make me wonder what they see
in their candidate of choice. They have much more experi
ence and intelligence than I do. and so I would want to hear

their side."
His roommate, Petrofsky, dis
agreed.
"Peers putting up political signs is
viewed differently than teachers be
cause the teachers are in positions of
authority," Petrofsky said. "Certain
ly in a classroom political signs are
never okay, and professors need to
be especially mindful between their
opinion and actual fact, because
they have the ability to influence
groups of students."
Professors and
political objectivity
Nancy Buffington, a lecturer for
the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric, said it can be difficult to
remain objective in her American
politics course.
"With a class on the American
identity during election season, it's
inevitable that questions of politics
and ideology arise," Buffington said.
"I haven't done anything like post
ing political signs in my office or
telling students who to vote for, but
I'm sure few of my students have
doubts about my political affiliation
or opinions on current events."
Even if professors do not clearly
display their political affiliation,
many students are still aware of their
professor's political views, as Buffin
gton demonstrates.
"I would say two of my three pro
fessors are openly political and joke
about Bush in class," said Cooper,

who enjoys their political openness and respects their opin
ions.
Stinchcombe agrees.
"1 actually know the political affiliation of most of my pro
fessors. and some even work in the Bush administration," he
said. "I've never felt like people were being graded on a po
litical basis. Keeping it away from the power relationship is
what's important."
Stinchcombe. a teaching assistant fora political science
course this quarter, said that he has experienced firsthand
the effects of politics in the classroom.
"I've had to be very careful." he said. "It's a challenge
keeping politics out of the classroom, and it's very important
that you aren't using your power for political things. Most of
the class isn't about only the election, but sometimes we will
discuss things relating to current politics. I read papers writ
ten by students who have a very obviously different opinion
than I do. but I always read their opinions and allow them to
speak their minds without consequence."
Meng said. "I really believe in freedom of speech, even in
the classroom." He said he probably wouldn't lose any re
spect fora teacher who didn't agree with him politically.

demonstrated by the campaign material posted on their dormroom door.
