# To reduce voter gap in East Palo Alto, students create bilingual voter guide
## 
### DEVON MAYLIE DESK EDITOR 
No Latino has sat on the East Palo Alto
City Council for the past 16 years — a result
due in large part to low voter registration and
turnout. Among the many get-out-the-vote
efforts in the town, which is approximately
60 percent Spanish-speaking, is one created
and executed by four Stanford journalism
master's students.
In an eight-page, non-partisan pamphlet
printed in both English and Spanish are pro
files of candidates, descriptions of the city
council and its responsibilities, and stories on
campaign finance. The goal: to better inform
the Spanish-speaking electorate.
Vanessa de la Torre, one of the stu
dents who produced the pamphlet,
stressed the importance of the guide from
her own experience. Raised in a town
where many of the residents are Mexican
American and speak Spanish as their first
language, de la Torre said her own grand
mother was not able to read voter's guides
that were produced only in English.
"It was a necessity to have a Spanish-lan
guage edition if we wanted our project to
carry real weight," Torre said. "At the very
least it shows Latinos that their votes do mat
ter in the East Palo Alto city council race;
votes that can significantly influence the fu
ture of their city."
Jamie Schuman, another of the project's
co-creators, said that she witnessed a posi-

tive reaction to the bilingual voter
guide.

"When I was handing out the
guides Saturday. I had both the En
glish and Spanish versions in

hand." Schuman said.
"Many people jumped
right for the Spanish.
I think that shows

how important it is to
have a Spanish-lan
guage guide."

The four stu
dents said that the
English-only local
and regional cov
erage of the city

council race was
not adequate for
the majority of

the electorate.
The idea
for the bilin
gual voter
guide was con
ceived in Prof.
Bill Woo's
Public Issues
Reporting
course, which
has focused
on political
coverage for
local elec
tions. The

class is one of the core courses for

the one-year journalism

master's program.

which enrolls

approxi
mately 15
students
each year.
The voter

guide was
published as

a special print
supplement to

the class's regu
lar online publi-

cation. "The Car
dinal Inquirer."

The journalism
master's students —

de la Torre, Schuman.
Kimberly Chase and
Ben Dimapindan — de-

cided to publish the guide
to fill a gap in election cov
erage. Both Dimapindan
and Chase said no compa
rable publication exists for
voters in East Palo Alto.
The students first wrote
the voter guide in English
and had 500 of the 1.500
translated into Spanish. On
Friday and Saturday, the stu
dents passed out the guides
to East Palo Alto residents..

"The Cardinal Inquirer" and "El Cardi
nal Inquirer" were left at City Hall, the li
brary, the senior center, popular restaurants
such as 3 Brothers Taco Restaurant and mar
kets like Las Estrellitas, churches and the
Tulip Jones Women's Club. The students
also visited a city council candidate forum
and a rally for Democratic presidential can
didate Sen. John Kerry, where many of the
candidates appeared.
"I like to think that our voter's guide was
the most in-depth and informative," said
Diniapindan. "I think it gives the readers a
real, true sense of who their candidates are,
what kind of people they are."
Nine candidates are running for three
four-year terms, and three are competing for
one two-year seat. Chase said that the East
Palo Alto community is very involved and in
terested in the outcome of the election.
She said many of the people she spoke
with while handing out the guide criticized
the current board members for being more
concerned with attracting businesses to the
area than providing services for the resi
dents. She is hoping the guide will serve as a
source to determine what the candidates rep
resent and whether the candidates will fulfill
the voters' needs.
Chase is hopeful that the guide will make
a difference in the residents' ability to make
an informed vote.
"I want to contribute to the community,"
she said. "I have an interest in making [my
work in journalism! useful to other people."

council and its responsibilities, and stories on
campaign finance. The goal: to better inform
the Spanish-speaking electorate.
Vanessa de la Torre, one of the stu
dents who produced the pamphlet,
stressed the importance of the guide from
her own experience. Raised in a town
where many of the residents are Mexican
American and speak Spanish as their first
language, de la Torre said her own grand
mother was not able to read voter's guides
that were produced only in English.
"It was a necessity to have a Spanish-lan
guage edition if we wanted our project to
carry real weight," Torre said. "At the very
least it shows Latinos that their votes do mat
ter in the East Palo Alto city council race;
votes that can significantly influence the fu
ture of their city."
Jamie Schuman, another of the project's
co-creators, said that she witnessed a posi-

tive reaction to the bilingual voter
guide.

"When I was handing out the
guides Saturday. I had both the En
glish and Spanish versions in

hand." Schuman said.
"Many people jumped
right for the Spanish.
I think that shows

how important it is to
have a Spanish-lan
guage guide."

The four stu
dents said that the
English-only local
and regional cov
erage of the city

council race was
not adequate for
the majority of

the electorate.
The idea
for the bilin
gual voter
guide was con
ceived in Prof.
Bill Woo's
Public Issues
Reporting
course, which
has focused
on political
coverage for
local elec
tions. The

class is one of the core courses for

the one-year journalism

master's program.

which enrolls

approxi
mately 15
students
each year.
The voter

guide was
published as

a special print
supplement to

the class's regu
lar online publi-

cation. "The Car
dinal Inquirer."

The journalism
master's students —

de la Torre, Schuman.
Kimberly Chase and
Ben Dimapindan — de-

cided to publish the guide
to fill a gap in election cov
erage. Both Dimapindan
and Chase said no compa
rable publication exists for
voters in East Palo Alto.
The students first wrote
the voter guide in English
and had 500 of the 1.500
translated into Spanish. On
Friday and Saturday, the stu
dents passed out the guides
to East Palo Alto residents..

"The Cardinal Inquirer" and "El Cardi
nal Inquirer" were left at City Hall, the li
brary, the senior center, popular restaurants
such as 3 Brothers Taco Restaurant and mar
kets like Las Estrellitas, churches and the
Tulip Jones Women's Club. The students
also visited a city council candidate forum
and a rally for Democratic presidential can
didate Sen. John Kerry, where many of the
candidates appeared.
"I like to think that our voter's guide was
the most in-depth and informative," said
Diniapindan. "I think it gives the readers a
real, true sense of who their candidates are,
what kind of people they are."
Nine candidates are running for three
four-year terms, and three are competing for
one two-year seat. Chase said that the East
Palo Alto community is very involved and in
terested in the outcome of the election.
She said many of the people she spoke
with while handing out the guide criticized
the current board members for being more
concerned with attracting businesses to the
area than providing services for the resi
dents. She is hoping the guide will serve as a
source to determine what the candidates rep
resent and whether the candidates will fulfill
the voters' needs.
Chase is hopeful that the guide will make
a difference in the residents' ability to make
an informed vote.
"I want to contribute to the community,"
she said. "I have an interest in making [my
work in journalism! useful to other people."
