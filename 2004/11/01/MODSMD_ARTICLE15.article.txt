## Editorial The
						Daily's 2004 California voter guide 
### 
Welcome to The Daily
Editorial Board's 2004
California voter guide.
The editorial board,
which is entirely separate from The
Daily's news department, researched
the 16 propositions on this years Cali
fornia ballot. The board's views on
seven of the 16 propositions are artic
ulated below.
NO on Proposition 63
Mental Health Services Expansion
Proposition 63 proposes to ex
pand funding for California's mental
health services and to guarantee that
current state funding levels for such
services not be lowered. If passed, the
proposition would pay for its provi
sions through an income-tax sur
charge of 1 percent on California
state residents with incomes above $ 1
million. This proposition, while well
intentioned, should not be passed be
cause it is the wrong way to fix a seri
ous state problem.
The initiative's proponents argue
that Prop. 63 would help California by
ensuring that thousands of untreated
mentally ill individuals receive appro
priate treatment, which would also
cut costs of other state government
services and make the state safer.
We strongly agree that mental
health services are underfunded in
California. More must be done to en
sure that these services are expanded.
And the benefits suggested by the ad
vocates of Prop. 63 would indeed be
realized if mental health services
funding were expanded.
But the proposition's mechanism
of raising such funds — a tax on those
with incomes above $1 million — is
an improper approach. This method
was likely decided upon by the bill's
authors in order to make it less objec
tionable to the average state resident.
After all, under the proposed ar
rangement, only a select few residents
would be forced to bear all of the costs
to implement the bill.
However, it is unusual and a bit ar
bitrary to put the burden for one spe
cific service exclusively on the shoul
ders of a small and potentially fluctuat
ing portion of the population. Caring
for the mentally ill is a responsbilitv that
should fall on all of society, not just the
richest 0.2 percent of income earners.
Furthermore, income in that tax
bracket is highly variable. With
booms and busts in the economy, the
number of people earning over $1
million changes a lot. As a result, the
funding for this critical service could
be unsteady.
In short. Prop. 63 means well, but
it falls short in how it specifically pro
poses to fund its expansion of mental
health services. These state services
desperately need more money and
must be expanded to better meet the
current demand, but a flawed initia
tive such as this is not the practical or
just way to achieve that end.
YES on Proposition 64
Private Enforcement of Unfair
Competition Laws
Proposition 64 limits the private
enforcement of unfair business com
petition laws. This proposition should
be passed because it would reduce the
number of frivolous lawsuits, en
abling small businesses to pursue
growth without having to worry
aftout settling legal suits over minor or
non-existent offenses.
Currently, the law allows lawyers
to sue on behalf of the public for busi
ness practices that are in violation of
the law. In the past, small businesses
have been sued for things as trivial as
abbreviating APR instead of spelling
it out as "annual percentage
rate.'Travel agents have also been
sued for not including their license

number on their Web sites.
These cases are often frivolous,
but because many small business lack
the money and legal resources to chal
lenge the cases, they often are forced
to settle out of court.
Much of the time, the settlement
amounts go directly to the lawyer who
filed suit, not the consumers who
were supposedly wronged.
Prop. 64 would close this loophole
by preventing this specific form of
lawsuit.
Furthermore, any settlements
awarded would go to the state of Cal
ifornia and not the lawyers.
The initiative has been supported
by many big business interests, in
cluding financial, insurance, oil and
pharmaceutical companies. That is

why some people have
decided to oppose Prop.
64 — because they think
that it would favor big
business at the expense
of consumer rights.
However, the word
ing of the proposition
prevents it from being
abased by big businesses.
It states that private
enforcement of unfair
business competition
laws would not be re
stricted if "the individu
al was actually injured
by, and suffered finan
cial / property loss be
cause of, an unfair busi
ness practice."
As a result, only
frivolous lawsuits would
be ruled out, and the con
sumer would still be pro
tected in cases when ac
tual damage is inflicted.
YES on Proposition 66
Limitations on "Three-
Strikes" Law
The three strikes law,
which was passed in
1994 increased the
penalty for repeated
crimes even if they were
nonviolent. Proposition
66 reforms that law,
making it more lenient
regarding non-violent
crimes such as petty
theft and bad check writ
ing. At the same time, it
increases the conse
quences for specified sex
crimes against children
by imposing a one-strike
law on these offenses.
The three-strikes law,
which was passed in 1994,
is badly in need of re
form. It severely punishes
repeat offenders after
three offenses. However,
some of the offenses the
law currently includes re
sults in extremely strict
sentences for individuals
engaging in relatively
minor third-offense
crimes.

Prop. 66 would save
the state of California
hundreds of millions of dollars by not
pursuing these petty criminals as vig
orously as they were prosecuted
under the three-strikes law. Murder
ers, rapists and child molesters would
still remain in jail where they belong,
but those who do not commit such
heinous crimes would receive a
lighter and more equitable punish
ment.
Aside from saving taxpayers'
money, this is also in keeping with the
notion of letting the punishment fit the
crime. Petty third-offense criminals
may still have repeatedly done wrong,
but that does not mean they should be
locked up for prolonged periods of

time at the taxpayers' expense.
Those opposed to Prop. 66 argue
that it would make the legal system
overly lenient and put criminals back
on the streets. 1 lowever. the law actu
ally stiffens the penalties for child mo
lesters, and it makes the law more le
nient only for those guilty of less seri
ous crimes.
Because it would reduce the costs
of legal and correctional facilities as
well as make the law more fair. Prop.
66 should be passed.
NO on Proposition 68
Non-Tribal Commercial Gambling
Expansion
Proposition 68 would force Indian
tribes to pay 25 percent of slot-ma-

chine- and gaming-device revenue to
the state government. If they fail to
comply, 16 specified non-tribal race
tracks and gambling establishments
would be authorized to operate 30,(XX)
slot machines and gaming devices and
pay 33 percent of net revenues to fund
government public safety, regulatory
and social programs.
We oppose the proposition' be
cause, as its opponents such as Cali
fornia Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
put it, it is "riddled" with problems.
For one, the proposition is a back
dtx)r way for non-tribal gaming inter
ests to expand their operations. In
that sense. Prop. 68 is one step closer

to legalized gambling in California.
The spread of gambling through
many major urban neighborhoods
carries many potentially undesirable
social consequences.
Gambling has often been associat
ed with crime, and many of the new
slot machines would be near schools
and other sensitive areas.
In addition, increasing taxes on
Native American casinos or legalizing
gambling are important issues that
should be considered in independent
propositions and not as a joint pack
age. There is no compelling reason for
them to be tied together as they are in
this initiative except for the fact that it
suits the purposes of the non-tribal
gaming special interests trying to pass
this proposition. These special inter-

ests expect that the
tribes will not pay the
25 percent, meaning
they will he able to
put in gambling ma
chines as the law stip
ulates.
Furthermore, al
though Prop. 68 in
creases taxes on gam
ing, it unnecessarily
protects gaming in
terests from future
tax hikes.
Proponents of
Prop. 68 argue that
Native Americans
have a gambling
monopoly in Califor
nia and that they
have not paid enough
in taxes in the past.
But Schwarzeneg
ger's negotiated
agreement with the
tribes has increased
the amount that Na
tive Americans pay
to the state, and it
seems unfair to de
mand that Native
Americans pay more
than other corpora
tions.
YES on
Proposition 69
DN A Samples
Proposition 69
would require the
collection of DNA
samples from all
felons and from
adults and juveniles
arrested for or
charged with other
specified crimes. This
information would
assist law enforce
ment officers in
catching and prose
cuting criminals, and
it should be passed.
The proposition
would cost $20 mil
lion, but it would be
funded through an in
crease in criminal
penalties, not in
taxes. In the long run,
it could even save
money, as more crim-

inals would be caught and put in jail
before committing subsequent
crimes.
Furthermore, it would bring Cali
fornia in line with other states that al
ready have more sophisticated DNA
databases. Virginia, for example, has
a population smaller than that of Los
Angeles, yet it solves over three times
as many crimes with DNA informa
tion than the entire state of California.
Some people are concerned that
Prop. 69 would infringe on individu
als' rights to privacy. In particular,
they are concerned that people ar
rested for petty crimes would have
DNA information taken from their

person and entered into a state
database.
However, arrestees can go
through a process to have their DNA
removedfrom the database, if they
believe it is merited.
Some people are also worried that
DNA would be used to wrongfully
put an innocent person in jail. How
ever, defense attorneys say that DNA
evidence is an effective method of de
termining innocence.
To better protect California citi
zens, Prop. 69 should be passed.
NO on Proposition 70
Tribal Gaming Compacts,
Contributions to the State
Proposition 70 would give Native
American tribes a 99-year compact
granting exclusive tribal gaming
rights without limits on the number of
machine facilities or types of games
on Indian land.
The tribes would contribute a per
centage of their net gaming income,
based on the prevailing state corpo
rate tax rate. These contributions
would be waived if any non-tribal
casino-type gaming were permitted.
Prop. 70 is understandable as a
counterpoint on the ballot to Prop. 68,
which would drastically hike taxes on
tribal casinos, but the status quo on
this issue is just fine. Native American
tribes have already negotiated ac
cords with Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger that set reasonble
tax rates for the casinos, and the tribes
already have a de facto monopoly. As
long as the Prop. 68 does not pass, we
see no need to pass Prop. 70, either.
NO on Proposition 71
Stem Cell Research, Funding, Bonds
Proposition 71 establishes a "Cali
fornia Institute for Regenerative
Medicine" to support and regulate $3
billion of stem-cell research in Cali
fornia over the course of 30 years. If
passed, the initiative would be funded
by state bonds rather than by taxes,
and it would require an additional $3
billion dollars in interest repayment.
The research would encompass
adult as well as embryonic stem cells
and would benefit California research
facilities, including Stanford and the
University of California. Stem-cell re
search is a relatively new area in sci
ence that is investigating the possibili
ty of replacing cells destroyed by such
diseases as Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's.
Proponents of the measure argue
that, in the wake of President George
W. Bush's curtailment on stem-cell
research, California should take mea
sures to become the vanguard of cut
ting-edge research in promising med
ical fields. They argue that in addition
to providing medical benefits and
economic profits to the state. Prop. 71
would ensure that research institu
tions conduct their studies ethically.
We believe that although stem
cell research undoubtedly deserves
more money than the $180 million
supplied by the federal government in
the year 2002, it is not the state's role
to provide for this funding. With Cal
ifornia's current budget deficit, it
would be unwise to set aside such a
large sum of money over such a long
period of time for research that scien
tists acknowledge is in its infancy.
We also believe the state should
not prioritize stem cell research over
research on equally harmful diseases
such as breast cancer or HIV.
There is no guarantee that in
creased stem cell research in Califor
nia would benefit the state's taxpay
ing public economically or socially
anytime soon. Until future prospects
in the field become clearer, it would
be wisest to wait fora more moderate
proposal.
