# Smoke and mirrors aside...
## Four more wars, or time for a change? 
### 
America's decision tomor
row will he the most influ
ential in our lifetimes. Ei
ther we'll lead the world as
a beacon ol hope and justice, or we'll be
deluged by a torrent of threats that'll
paralyze the futures we once envi
sioned.
President George W. Bush has
made this election about one thing: na
tional security. And by doing so, he has
made John Kerry the best choice.
With troops stretched thin and serv
ing multiple tours of duty, America's
voluntary' military doesn't have the
numbers, morale or resources to wage
another war today. As a result, any
threats we make have little enforce
ment value.
Diplomacy is our only weapon, and
Bush's reputation is far too blud
geoned to wield it.
From the slap-down of the Kyoto
Protocol to the attempted creation of a
"Star Wars" missile defense shield,
George Bush's early decisions reflect
ed his utter disregard for dissent and
compromise.
Sept. 11 offered the president a new
opportunity, and the world was instinc
tively at Bush's side. Yet rather than
continuing a ruthless and exhaustive
offensive against al-Qaeda, the presi
dent diverted our troops, resources
and attention to a contained and impo
tent country in the Middle East.
As the administration mobilized
troops and sharpened rhetoric against

Iraq, it diverted international attention
away from serious, graver threats in the
world.
In December 2002, three months

before the war.
North Korea
kicked out U.N.
nuclear monitors
and resumed plans
to create one or
two nuclear
weapons. We did
nothing, and now
North Korea has
nukes.
A.Q. Khan, the
father of Pak-

istan's nuclear program, continued
using his network to proliferate nu
clear secrets to an international black
market. Evidence suggests that rogue
nations and terrorists had ample op
portunity to access this network and
further their ambitions to acquire
weapons of mass destruction.
Iran, emboldened by the collapse of
Iraq and the subsequent U.S. debacle,
has furthered its uranium enrichment
program as the international commu
nity desperately tries to stop it.
The point is, these are serious times.
Threats today, unlike during the Cold
War, arise from various origins, carry
different motives and can multiply into
graver scenarios if state and non-state
agents collude.
Bush, however, has exhibited a re
markable record of incompetence. Just

two weeks ago, Pat Robertson revealed
that Bush told him "we're not going to
have any casualties" in Iraq, adding
more flack to an administration that has
produced policy blunders and stomach
churning scandals like clockwork.
Bush's tone and penchant for
hands-free delegation has created a
culture where dereliction of duty and
ethics is condoned so long as no one
knows about it; where the Department
of Justice writes papers dismissing the
Geneva Conventions; and where ide
ology and corporate cronyism take
precedence over judicious policy judg
ment and the pursuit of egalitarian
ends.
In the process, his cowboy-meets
dictator tone has alienated the world
and isolated the United States. With
Bush in power, terrorists will continue
to claim that torture at Abu Ghraib re
flects the primal nature of the United
States, and they'll punish our troops for
it.
In international relations, impres
sions are everything, and we should be
wary of a president who turns our
friends into enemies and our enemies
into friends.
Another Bush term will not only
produce more crises and increase our
unpopularity — it will also jeopardize
the future of the free world and allow
anti-United States sentiment to be re
packaged into recruitment talking
points for young and budding Islamist
militants.
Bush makes the errors, and the free
world pays the price.
We can vote for an administration
that is bankrupt in reputation and
bereft of vision, or vote fora course
that renews alliances and employs wis
dom and sacrosanct moral principles to
the fight that our generation will ulti
mately inherit.
That is the decision we make to
morrow, and the course of history will
be forever altered as a result. As Bush
once tried saying, "Fool me once,
shame on—shame on you. Fool me —
you can't get fooled again."
