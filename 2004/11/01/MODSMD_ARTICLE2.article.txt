# Students celebrate Day of the Dead

### LAURA CARWILE 
Crowds of people talked and danced in Old
Union Courtyard on Friday night. There were
decorations, performers and more than enough
food and drink to go around. At first glance, this
could have been any on-campus party, where
students would unwind after a long week of
classes.
But this fiesta had a higher purpose. The stu
dents came out to celebrate "El Dia de Los
Muertos," or "The Day of the Dead," an event

that combines indigenous Native American cul
ture with Catholic traditions.
According to legend, the holiday began as a
way for Aztecs to honor the thousands of peo
ple who lost their lives during the journey to find
their future empire. With the advent of Chris
tianity, the culture was reshaped and the ancient
tradition of honoring the dead was mixed with
the Spanish celebration of "All Souls Day."
Today, "El Dia De Los Muertos" is held in
remembrance of the deceased near the same
time of the season as Halloween.

For the occasion. 10 students from El Centro
Chicano constructed an ornate altar built so that
attendees could pay their respects.
"It gives people a good mindset, a new re
spect for the dead." said Co-Program Coordi
nator Maricela Trevino. who organized con
struction of the altar. "People who didn't have
any experience building altars came together
and created this beautiful altar in five hours.
I'm really happy that it turned out so well."
