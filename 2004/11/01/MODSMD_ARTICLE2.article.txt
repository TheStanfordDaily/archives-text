# Students celebrate Day of the Dead
## 
### LAURA CARWILE 
Crowds of people talked and danced in Old
Union Courtyard on Friday night. There were
decorations, performers and more than enough
food and drink to go around. At first glance, this
could have been any on-campus party, where
students would unwind after a long week of
classes.
But this fiesta had a higher purpose. The stu
dents came out to celebrate "El Dia de Los
Muertos," or "The Day of the Dead," an event

that combines indigenous Native American cul
ture with Catholic traditions.
According to legend, the holiday began as a
way for Aztecs to honor the thousands of peo
ple who lost their lives during the journey to find
their future empire. With the advent of Chris
tianity, the culture was reshaped and the ancient
tradition of honoring the dead was mixed with
the Spanish celebration of "All Souls Day."
Today, "El Dia De Los Muertos" is held in
remembrance of the deceased near the same
time of the season as Halloween.

For the occasion. 10 students from El Centro
Chicano constructed an ornate altar built so that
attendees could pay their respects.
"It gives people a good mindset, a new re
spect for the dead." said Co-Program Coordi
nator Maricela Trevino. who organized con
struction of the altar. "People who didn't have
any experience building altars came together
and created this beautiful altar in five hours.
I'm really happy that it turned out so well."

Students gathered in the Old Union Courtyard Friday night to celebrate 'El Dia de Los Muertos/ or The Day of the Dead/ an annual festival which hon
ors the memory of the deceased. Student performances livened the celebration, which, far from a somber affair, often features music and dancing.
In keeping with tradition, the
altar was surrounded by marigolds
and candles and contained sugar
skulls and food, such as fresh fruit
and nuts, for the dead.
Other individuals and groups on
campus contributed to the altar by
adding smaller altars within it for
people who have passed away, both
famous (Malcolm X) and personal
(grandmothers and friends).
Junior Ilder Betancourt, the
other co-program coordinator, was
in charge of putting on the celebra
tion this year.
"It's probably been at Stanford
for 20 years," he said. "It's interest
ing because the celebration focuses
on deceased family. Death is not
supposed to be a happy thing, but
we believe that it's just a part of
human life, and not necessarily a
bad thing."
The decorations, which included
skeletons and Christian crosses, also
reflected the varied sources from

which the holiday draws its origin.
"The images, like the skeletons,
are the indigenous influence," Be
tancourt said. "The crosses and the
prayer during the ceremony is a re
sult of the Catholic background. It's
a Catholic and Aztec holiday, and
you can't separate those two ele
ments."
Betancourt has a personal tie to
El Dia because two friends of his re
cently passed away.
"You go through the process of
mourning, but it's better to then look
back on their lives and celebrate," he
said. "It's better to focus on the good
things. Within the idea of death, you
celebrate life: yours and those who
have passed away," Betancourt said.
Many attendees observe the holi
day each year and could list their fa
vorite parts of the celebration.
"I love the chocolate â€” it re
minds me of home because it's a hol
iday tradition, both in my family and
in the culture in general," said co-

Students remember lost
loved ones during festival

terminal student Cristina Mercado.
"There's a lot better turnout here
this year, and that's a good way for us
to show our culture," she said.
Senior Bobby Deharo said he
came in remembrance of his father,
who was in a mariachi band like the
one that played on Friday night.
"I'm here to celebrate my father's
life, and I'm glad they do this on
campus so it is more accessible to me
as a student," he said.
Senior Silvia Cruz said she loved
the altars made for those who have
passed away.
"It's cool that other people are so
interested. It makes it a lot more
fun."
On the whole, students said they
were able to have fun even while
paying their respects, and that the
event made them feel a new respect
for their own lives.
"It's important that we are cele
brating both their lives and your
life," Betancourt said.
