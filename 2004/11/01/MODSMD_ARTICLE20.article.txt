## Handling the Middle East Conflict 
### JEN GRAHAM 
At least I had four weeks to stay
out of the fray. It was only a matter
of time, hut now The Daily's given
me a chance to write on an issue
that has come to define more than
one volume of the paper in my time
at Stanford.
The first e-mail I received as The
Daily's Readership Editor asked
me to comment on the paper's poli
cy on letters to the editor, specifi
cally regarding allegedly anti-
Semitic content that had run in past
volumes.
I responded that, in fairness to
The Daily, I would only discuss the
current volume's coverage since I
hadn't followed other volumes as
closely.
Though it took about a month,
something has finally dislodged the
pro-Bush vs. anti-Kerry vs. anti-
Bush vs. pro-Kerry back-and-forth
that has saturated The Daily for
weeks. That "something" is the
paper's coverage, broadly defined,
of "Holocaust survivor and champi
on of the Palestinian cause in Is
rael" Hedy Epstein's visit to cam
pus.
The editorial by Epstein that ran
in the Oct. 20 Daily, followed by a
news article on a speech she gave
that day and a critical op-ed on Oct.
21, have prompted more than nine
letters to the editor and five subse
quent op-eds, barely any of which
address at all decisions The Daily it
self made, instead propagating de
bate over the conflict itself.
To the chagrin of some readers,
it is not my job to weigh in on the
salience of the arguments that have
appeared in the paper's opinions
pages for the past week and a half.
To do so would be no better than
simply submitting a sixth op-ed
piece.
What I will do is discuss the three
main actions The Daily took in its
coverage of the talk, and conclude
that, in my opinion. The Daily
should be absolved of some of the
most serious charges levied by read
ers. Those three actions were: the
coverage of Epstein's speech; the
decision to run the Oct. 21 op-ed
submitted on the same day as her
speech; and its policy on printing
letters to the editor and op-eds fol
lowing these events.
One difficulty of being the read
ership editor; I was not at Epstein's
speech. This limits my ability to dis
cuss the accuracy of The Daily's re
porting. Nevertheless, I can re
spond to how the paper covered the
speech, and the focus was on con

troversy.
Whereas an average "wrap" of a
speech on campus would highlight
the message of the talk. The Daily's
coverage had the speech's theme
share the spotlight with the obser
vation that "tensions boiled." More
inches are devoted to discussing the
conflict the speech created than to
the message and substance of the
speech itself.
And, in the relatively short arti
cle, both representatives of campus
groups and disruptive off-campus
audience members critical of the
speech are quoted, whereas, save
for her introduction, Epstein is not
backed in The Daily's article by any
corroborating voice.
While controversy and tension
were a newsworthy part of the
clearly heated event. The Daily's
coverage gives plenty — if not un
fairly too much — lip service to
voices critical of Epstein, leaving
the take-away point of the article to
not be her message but rather the
extent of her opposition.
In addition to the news article on
Oct. 21, The Daily published an op
ed submitted before Epstein gave
her speech by Nathan Mintz, who
referenced and criticized her talk.
Readers have complained that this
was both confusing — how can a
writer respond to a speech that
hasn't happened yet? — and unfair.
The Daily's Opinions Department
has defended the decision by argu
ing that the piece discussed Ep
stein's broader patterns of rhetoric
and that Mintz agreed to alter his
submission if after hearing the
speech his opinions changed. This
decision was wrong.
The first issue is that, while the
last three-fourths of the Op-ed do in
fact discuss her broader rhetoric,
the first three paragraphs give the
explicit impression that the author
is responding to her talk at Stan
ford. This is misleading to readers.
Furthermore, The Daily should
be skeptical of serving as a forum
for propagating presumptions.
While Mint/, apparently did not
alter his column after hearing Ep
stein's speech, there are claims, that
I can neither confirm nor deny, that
Mintz's column factually misrepre
sents the substance of Epstein's
speech. This could have been avoid
ed if The Daily either did not bill
the op-ed as a response to Epstein's
talk or if it refused to publish pieces
that assumed knowledge of an
event before it happened.
Finally, the issue of the letters to
the editor, which The Daily has not
been in short supply of on this de

bate. There has been a call for "fair
ness" in The Daily's policy toward
letters — both in ensuring that they
represent facts fairly and in refusing
to promote anti-Semitic rhetoric.
Here's the first part of the prob
lem: The Daily has no formal letters
policy. It hasn't for as long as I've
been acquainted with the paper.
This means that what can appear on
its pages varies from editor to edi
tor. This volume's staff has told me
their ad-hoc policy takes into ac
count whether a letter is "reason
able," unique in its viewpoint and
valuable to campus dialogue,
among other considerations. They
have also told me that they do not
feel it is appropriate to print a letter
that they feel is anti-Semitic (or
anti-Palestinian for that matter) in
the name of free speech.
What is obvious is these factors
are all subjective. Especially with is
sues involving Israel and Palestine,
what is "fact" and what is "opinion"
becomes a much more contentious
debate. From my reading of the let
ters printed in the aftermath of Ep
stein's speech, I believe The Daily
has followed its reasonable policy.
Case in point: One issue brought
up both in the pages of The Daily
and in an e-mail to me was the issue
of "body counts" — specifically
whether this either accurately rep
resented the nature of the conflict
and whether it was dehumanizing
toward Jews via the implication that
fewer deaths means less suffering.
The Daily has let readers play ball
through the letters to the editor on
the first issue, and while interpreta
tions havfe differed, facts seem to
me to be accurate. Kudos.
As for the second concern, the
counterargument would be that
claiming Jews suffer more per capi
ta is dehumanizing towards Pales
tinians, so The Daily shouldn't run
anything that implies either. Taken
to their extremes, this logic would
preclude meaningful discussion in
the paper. The Daily's editors need
to draw the line between construc
tive contentious debate and unac
ceptable racial and ethnic stereo
typing; on the whole, to date this
volume has done so well.
This column will now run regu
larly on Mondays, and I plan to ad
dress The Daily's election coverage
in this space next week, so please e
mail me with your comments. And
to those who have e-mailed me be
fore and received no response,
don't be discouraged — my e-mail
has been fixed, and I will now re
ceive all messages sent to reader
ship@daily.stanford.edu.
