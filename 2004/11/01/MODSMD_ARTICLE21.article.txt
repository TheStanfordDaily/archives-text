Please note, due to a technical glitch, the readership editor's e-mail address was
not fully functioning until last week. If you sent an e-mail to
readership@daily.stanford.edu prior to last week, your message was most likely
not received. We apologize for this error on our part. However, the address
now is operational, and any e-mail that you send will be received. So be certain
to contact the readership editor with feedback on The Daily's performance.
We look forward to hearing from you.
