## Playing and losing the name game 
### YAMANDA WRIGHT 
Have you noticed there's some
thing about the Stanford culture
that requires you to memorize filo
faxes of names every day?
On top of Computer Science 107
and developing your own foreign
language, you now have to commit
to memory every student in every
section you've ever had in order to
avoid an awkward "how come you
don't know my name" glare-a-thon.
Students have now been divided
into the knows and know-nots
through this campuswide quizbowl.
One day in middle school, I was
sitting in line in gym class behind my
best friend. 1 had forgotten the
name of a girl we talked to every
day, although 1 could vividly re
member asking her name at least 10
times before. So 1 devised a sneaky
little brilliant plan.
"Okay, let's play the name
game!" I said excitedly. I first turned
to my best friend in order to escape
suspicion.
After he clearly pronounced his,
I moved on to another girl whose
name 1 obviously knew, then slyly
on to unknown girl. "Maria," she
said through an uncomfortable
laugh, unaccustomed to my ran
domness. Poor clueless child, no
idea.
Then my friend blurted "You
know, I used to do that when I didn't
know a person's name. How funny."
(Thanks for that, by the way. Re
mind me to call you when there's a
warrant for my arrest and I'm hiding

from the cops.)
Needless to say, the girl wasn't an
idiot and caught on eventually,
shooting a look of hurt at me that
cuts me to the core to this day.
Well, not really, but I felt pretty
immensely guilty. Almost guilty
enough to buy her a blowpop from
the drill team fundraiser, but not
quite.
I thought 1 had escaped these un
comfortable situations altogether
come college. 1 assumed that 19- and
20-year-old adults could handle
someone forgetting their name, and
that by livingand dining with friends
— without the pressure — I could
remember multitudes of names in
my dorm (i.e. the girl with the red
hair is Lauren because some wrens
have red feathers. Lor wren, etc.).
But despite these efforts and sev
eral late-night wanderings to price
Ginko in the pharmacy aisle of the
neighborhood drug store, I cannot
for the life of me remember this one
girl's name from my art history lec
ture. And I cannot shake the feeling
that she hates me passionately for it
every time I say "hey you," although
I doubt she remembers mine.
Have you ever reached the point
where you passed forgivable-forget
fulness land two exits ago and don't
know how to get out of having for
gotten a person's name over and
over again?
Don't think this proves any
amount of laziness on my part, be
cause 1 have tried my best Carmen
San Diego and Ghostwriter skills to
figure out names on my own to no

avail.
We sit next to them every Tues
day and Thursday, and they have yet
to flip to a page of notes with their
names written at the top — who in
this world doesn't write their name
on their notebook? I guess we all
want unclaimed tablets floating
around.
If you face this problem one day,
and after trying all of my masterful
methods still can't figure it out, next
try the infamous "How do you spell
your name, again?" and hope they
don't laugh uncontrollably because
their name is something simple like
"Kelly" or "Mike."
And when all else fails, be hon
est. Tell them about how your room
mate crashed her car into the street
light on the corner Escondido and
Campus; how it fell on your head
giving you short-term amnesia.
Tell them how you are standing
in for your twin sister who is study
ing abroad in Malaysia for the week,
so you don't know who she has had
10 sections and three lunches with.
It's a new program through the
Humßio department.
Whatever you do, don't admit
you forgot their name. Because that
would be disastrous, obviously.
