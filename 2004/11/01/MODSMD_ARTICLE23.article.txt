## Protest voter suppression Wednesday 
### KIIRA MANCASOLA 
This election year, a tremendous
amount of energy has been spent mo
tivating citizens to exercise their right
to vote. However, in a country where
voters are force-fed misleading pro
paganda. intimidated away from the
polls and required to confine their
ideology into a constricting bipartisan
system, voting is not enough.
In the 2000 presidential race,
thousands of registered black voters
were denied their rights and turned
away from the polls in Florida be
cause of alleged criminal records,
which were later proven erroneous.
President George W. Bush was not
elected by the popular vote, but was
placed in office by nine people be

hind closed doors.
The likelihood of such fraud oc
curring in this year's election is
frighteningly high. Considering the
absence of paper trails for electron
ic voting machines, the 3,700 people
hired to intimidate voters at the
polls in Ohio as well as the proposed
disposal of Ohio's absentee ballots
that were printed on the "wrong
type of paper," checking a box is not
adequate civic participation.
It is imperative that we act as re
sponsible citizens and demand our
voices be heard. There is a way to do
this outside the voting booth.
Stanford students are joining many
other activist groups from the Bay
Area to let our newly elected official
know that our participation does not

end when the polls close on Nov. 2.
We can no longer trust the elec
toral system to represent the desires
of the people. Direct action pro
vides a way of taking matters into
our own hands on a community level
instead of relying on representation
by someone with different interests.
As students and United States
citizens, we must play an important
role in shaping the future of democ
racy. Join Stanford Morning After
Collective in direct action protest in
downtown San Francisco on
Wednesday, and come to the Haas
Center tonight at 8 p.m. to he part of
this important action.
