# Op-Ed
## 'Anti-Semitism' talk was offensive By AHMED ASHRAF 
### 
I'm afraid I have to warn you be
fore I proceed. I'm a Muslim who's
lived among Arabs for most of my
life. Why should that matter?
Perhaps because the "pre-emi
nent" authority on anti-Semitism, a
Harvard professor named Ruth
Wisse, has a verdict on the hun
dreds of millions of people who
calls themselves Arab, as well as the
billion or so that identify them
selves as Muslim.
She officially came to Stanford
to talk about the persistence of anti-
Semitism. courtesy of Chabad at
Stanford and a host of other Jewish
student groups.
She might be battling Jewish
hate, but she probably assumed that
the odd splattering of anti-Arab in
vective or Islamophobic verbal di
arrhoea would escape the audi
ence's notice because, well, let's
face it. everyone does it.
In case you were ever taken in by
their charms, Wisse helpfully in
formed Stanford students that
Arabs should never be believed to
be "sweet and kind." because
they're all "evil."
Jews and Arabs. Wisse continues,
came from diametrically opposed
cultures. Jews, she insists, love and ac
commodate everyone (except maybe
the Palestinians) while those evil
Arabs are just your regular hegemon

ic, authoritarian despots.
Muslims and Arabs aren't all
that bad though. They're better
than Hitler at least because they're
"more efficient and effective," but
they're still untrustworthy and ill
worthy of any sympathy.
Wisse further establishes hatred
of Israel as the uniting factor for all
Arabs — never mind the fuzzy lan
guage, culture and history they
share. She also found it useful to use
colorful examples to illustrate her
ideology. Wisse, a professor of Yid
dish literature, insightfully analo
gizes Arab-Jewish enmity as vitri
olic Pepsi-Coke rivalry.
Arab Pepsi has constantly at
tacked Jewish Coke for the last 55
years, she pressed to the audience,
while Coke never did anything
wrong. It appears that Israel, with
its nuclear arsenal and ultra-sophis
ticated, American-taxpayer-funded
military, remains cornered by scary
Arab nations like Lebanon and Jor
dan in Wisse's global perspective.
Criticism of Israel is anti-
Semitism, Wisse asserted, but she
didn't explain whether criticism of
the NAACP makes you a KKK af
filiate, or how Jews who criticize Is
rael can hold such spitting hatred
for their own race.
Not content with offending a
sizeable chunk of humanity, she
also complained that when discrim
ination on campus is directed

against Israelis and Jews, it's con
sidered OK.
"It's not when it comes to
blacks," she reasoned.
When I mentioned "tolerated
discrimination" against Muslims
and Arabs in my op-ed last week, I
didn't expect to be slapped with it
so soon.
Two weeks ago, the Hedy Epstein
event was disrupted by pro-Israelis
outraged by Epstein's support for the
Palestinians. The Arabs and Muslims
who attended Wisse's event, in con
trast. behaved perfectly respectfully,
even as the acidic torrent of hate
rained down on them — and for that,
I'm thankful and proud.
The troubling aspect of Wisse's
lecture extends far beyond her hate
and ignorance. The sponsoring stu
dent groups and their members who
brought this travesty to campus will
never be held accountable for their
despicable actions, nor will Wisse,
who can still enjoy the plush com
forts of teaching at Harvard.
Wisse may not win the war, but
she has certainly won the battle for
now. Pointedly. Wisse's anti-Arab
comments were the only anti-
Semitic reference made that
evening.
