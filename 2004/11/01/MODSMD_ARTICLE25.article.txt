## Cardinal runners again Pac-10 champions 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This Saturday's victory at the Pacific-10
Conference Championships makes three
meets in a row where the Stanford men's
and women's cross country teams have
claimed first. Hopefully, the momentum
will carry over to Regionals and then to the
NCAA Championships, to be held Nov.
22.
At Golden Gate Park, the top-ranked
women's team and the No. 2 men's team
swept both divisions of the Pac-10 meet.
While this was the men's fifth consecutive
title. Saturday's victory was the women's
ninth straight title and 11th in 12 years. The
double wins at Pre-NCAAs and the Notre
Dame Invitational make the Cardinal one
of the top contenders for the NCAA

Championships. This weekend's Pac-10 ti
tles in San Francisco didn't hurt either.
Some of the team members enjoyed
having the meet in a location not too far
from home. Senior Jacob Gomez was
happy that he didn't have to deal with the
stress of travel.
"But it was really the difference in the
number of fans that was great," he said.
"We haven't enjoyed as much cheering in
the icy Midwest."
Senior Anita Siraki agreed: "We are all
so used to traveling for hours to get to
meets so it was pretty nice not having to
deal with (that], and it was really nice to
have a huge cheering crowd for Stanford."
Despite the number of Stanford fans,
Arizona State was not discouraged and
proved to be a worthy competitor, finish
ing as runner-up in both divisions.

The Stanford women finished with an
average time of 20 minutes. 58 seconds and
totaled 30 points â€” 17 points ahead of Ari
zona State. The men completed the race
averaging 24:18 per runner, tallying 37
points and managing to place themselves
27 points ahead of the Sun Devils.
Men's head coach Andy Gerard gives
ASU much credit for the way its teams
competed this weekend. He noted that
from the beginning, the Sun Devils raced
intensely and were probably winning the
race until "somewhere between three and
four miles."
Despite Arizona State's strong start,
Gerard thought the Cardinal men rose to
the challenge.
"I continue to be impressed with the
guys' poise and racing instincts," he said.
"Despite being behind, the guys never pan

icked, worked together, worked their way
up and closed the race well."
The teams from The Farm were able to
come out on top even without first-place
individual finishes. Arizona's Robert
Cheseret. last year's Pac-10 Newcomer of
the Year, placed first, barely edging out
last year's Pac-10 Athlete of the Year, se
nior Ryan Hall, in the 8,000 meter race.
Until the end of the race, Hall was
ahead of Cheseret and the rest of the run
ners; however, towards the conclusion,
Cheseret took over the top position and
maintained it through the finish line de
spite a surge from Hall at the last second.
Although Hall did not bring home first,
Gerard was pleased with his effort.
"While it probably wasn't in Ryan's
