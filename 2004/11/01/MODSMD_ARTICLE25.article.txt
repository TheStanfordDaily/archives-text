## Cardinal runners again Pac-10 champions 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This Saturday's victory at the Pacific-10
Conference Championships makes three
meets in a row where the Stanford men's
and women's cross country teams have
claimed first. Hopefully, the momentum
will carry over to Regionals and then to the
NCAA Championships, to be held Nov.
22.
At Golden Gate Park, the top-ranked
women's team and the No. 2 men's team
swept both divisions of the Pac-10 meet.
While this was the men's fifth consecutive
title. Saturday's victory was the women's
ninth straight title and 11th in 12 years. The
double wins at Pre-NCAAs and the Notre
Dame Invitational make the Cardinal one
of the top contenders for the NCAA

Championships. This weekend's Pac-10 ti
tles in San Francisco didn't hurt either.
Some of the team members enjoyed
having the meet in a location not too far
from home. Senior Jacob Gomez was
happy that he didn't have to deal with the
stress of travel.
"But it was really the difference in the
number of fans that was great," he said.
"We haven't enjoyed as much cheering in
the icy Midwest."
Senior Anita Siraki agreed: "We are all
so used to traveling for hours to get to
meets so it was pretty nice not having to
deal with (that], and it was really nice to
have a huge cheering crowd for Stanford."
Despite the number of Stanford fans,
Arizona State was not discouraged and
proved to be a worthy competitor, finish
ing as runner-up in both divisions.

The Stanford women finished with an
average time of 20 minutes. 58 seconds and
totaled 30 points — 17 points ahead of Ari
zona State. The men completed the race
averaging 24:18 per runner, tallying 37
points and managing to place themselves
27 points ahead of the Sun Devils.
Men's head coach Andy Gerard gives
ASU much credit for the way its teams
competed this weekend. He noted that
from the beginning, the Sun Devils raced
intensely and were probably winning the
race until "somewhere between three and
four miles."
Despite Arizona State's strong start,
Gerard thought the Cardinal men rose to
the challenge.
"I continue to be impressed with the
guys' poise and racing instincts," he said.
"Despite being behind, the guys never pan

icked, worked together, worked their way
up and closed the race well."
The teams from The Farm were able to
come out on top even without first-place
individual finishes. Arizona's Robert
Cheseret. last year's Pac-10 Newcomer of
the Year, placed first, barely edging out
last year's Pac-10 Athlete of the Year, se
nior Ryan Hall, in the 8,000 meter race.
Until the end of the race, Hall was
ahead of Cheseret and the rest of the run
ners; however, towards the conclusion,
Cheseret took over the top position and
maintained it through the finish line de
spite a surge from Hall at the last second.
Although Hall did not bring home first,
Gerard was pleased with his effort.
"While it probably wasn't in Ryan's

best interest to lead every step, we
wanted to get a hard effort, to find
out what kind of pace he could han
dle and to set the stage for
NC'AAs," Gerard said. "Quite
honestly, a slower race, even if it
meant winning, wouldn't have pre
pared him as well for NCA As."
Also running well for the Cardi
nal were junior Jacob Gomez and
senior David Vidal, who finished
fourth and seventh, respectively.
Displaying the depth of the team,
Stanford also placed three more
runners in the top 20; juniors Brett
Gotcher, Peter Meindl and Jon
Pierce finished 11th. 13th. and
16th.
The individual women's title
went to another team as well. Ari
zona State's Amy Hastings won in
the women's race as she finished the
bk in 20:1 l ), ahead of the second- and
third-place finishers, seniors Alicia
Craig and Siraki.
Before the meet. Siraki spoke

with women's head coach Dena
Evans about where she needed to
finish. She executed her plan well
on Saturday.
"I'm really happy with how I
performed this weekend, because
Dena and I talked about how I
needed to be in the top seven and
that I could potentially be in the
top three." Siraki said. "Going into
the race. I was really focusing on
being in a position where I could
finish up there."
Sophomores Amanda and Katy
Trotter also competed well and
placed in the top 10. finishing sixth
and eighth. Stanford's next three
finishers completed the race within
three seconds of each other, all fin
ishing between 21:22 and 21:24.
Sophomore Teresa McWalters
placed 11th; senior Jeane Goff
ended the race in 12th and fresh
man Lauren Centrowitz in 14th.
This weekend and throughout
the rest of the season, both teams

Both men and women
win in San Francisco

have displayed depth that other
teams do not possess. Stanford was
able to use Saturday's race to not
only rest some of its runners, but
also to gauge its standing with ap
proximately three weeks left in the
season.
"We have the advantage of
being able to do what is right for
the athletes' individual prepara
tion without compromising the
team's goals," Gerard said.
"For example, we were able to
rest several guys this weekend
while still taking home the team
title. From top to bottom on our
roster, everyone contributes some
thing positive. Unfortunately, not
everyone can race every time ...
but one of the keys is that the
whole team stays positive [and]
stays on the same page. They're
not working against each other for
a certain spot, they're all working
towards our team goals and they all
contribute — racing or not."
