## Bush, Kerry worthless to the sporting voter 
### 
I think we all know what significance this
week holds — if you flip on the telly, ev
eryone's discussing an event that will de
fine our nation. And clearly, I'm referring to
Thursday's much-anticipated return of "The
OC." People also tell me that America elects
a president tomorrow, hut this is clearly less
important than the Giants winning a World
Series, the Giants acquiring Pedro as a closer
(peep the Philadelphia Daily News for this
story). Justin Timberlake's

appearance on "The OC,"
or virtually anything else
that's remotely sports-relat
ed (like analyzing why
Bronson Arroyo has corn
rows).
Apparently people vote
for presidential candidates
based on their stances on
foreign policy, domestic pol
icy. personality and a whole

host of other factors that have been discussed
ad nauseum in my poli sci classes. But basing
your vote on such factors is completely asi
nine, and, dare I say, irresponsible. I hope we
all recognize that sports carry far greater im
plications in life than politics. Thus, for people
who agree with that view, here's my presiden
tial primer for tomorrow's election.
First, let's start with the challenger: Sena
tor John Kerry. Riding the coattails of
Boston's World Series victory, an alleged
sports fan like Kerry would seize the moment
and attack Bush's record as owner of the
Texas Rangers. But this is exactly where
Kerry goes wrong — he's a) the definition of a
bandwagon Red Sox fan and b) not really a
sports fan at all.
Let's take a look at his Boston Red Sox
knowledge. Strike one: he called Manny
Ramirez "Manny Ortiz." Strike two: He
called six-time AL walk leader and career .254
hitter Eddie "The Walking Man" Yost his fa
vorite Red Sox player, the slight problem with
this being that Eddie never played for the
BoSox. Strike three: When Kerry corrected
his Manny Ramirez / David Ortiz error, he
still conjured the gringo within and pro
nounced Ortiz as "Ortez." Strike four: He
acted as if he'd never thrown a baseball be
fore, bouncing the ceremonial first pitch be
fore the July 25 Red Sox-Yankees game.
Minor errors? Perhaps. Knowledgeable
