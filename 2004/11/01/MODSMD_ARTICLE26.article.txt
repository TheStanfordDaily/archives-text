# Fade Into Bolivian
## Bush, Kerry worthless to the sporting voter 
### 
I think we all know what significance this
week holds — if you flip on the telly, ev
eryone's discussing an event that will de
fine our nation. And clearly, I'm referring to
Thursday's much-anticipated return of "The
OC." People also tell me that America elects
a president tomorrow, hut this is clearly less
important than the Giants winning a World
Series, the Giants acquiring Pedro as a closer
(peep the Philadelphia Daily News for this
story). Justin Timberlake's

appearance on "The OC,"
or virtually anything else
that's remotely sports-relat
ed (like analyzing why
Bronson Arroyo has corn
rows).
Apparently people vote
for presidential candidates
based on their stances on
foreign policy, domestic pol
icy. personality and a whole

host of other factors that have been discussed
ad nauseum in my poli sci classes. But basing
your vote on such factors is completely asi
nine, and, dare I say, irresponsible. I hope we
all recognize that sports carry far greater im
plications in life than politics. Thus, for people
who agree with that view, here's my presiden
tial primer for tomorrow's election.
First, let's start with the challenger: Sena
tor John Kerry. Riding the coattails of
Boston's World Series victory, an alleged
sports fan like Kerry would seize the moment
and attack Bush's record as owner of the
Texas Rangers. But this is exactly where
Kerry goes wrong — he's a) the definition of a
bandwagon Red Sox fan and b) not really a
sports fan at all.
Let's take a look at his Boston Red Sox
knowledge. Strike one: he called Manny
Ramirez "Manny Ortiz." Strike two: He
called six-time AL walk leader and career .254
hitter Eddie "The Walking Man" Yost his fa
vorite Red Sox player, the slight problem with
this being that Eddie never played for the
BoSox. Strike three: When Kerry corrected
his Manny Ramirez / David Ortiz error, he
still conjured the gringo within and pro
nounced Ortiz as "Ortez." Strike four: He
acted as if he'd never thrown a baseball be
fore, bouncing the ceremonial first pitch be
fore the July 25 Red Sox-Yankees game.
Minor errors? Perhaps. Knowledgeable

sports tan? No. I lite sports fan who
enjoys windsurfing. $12.(XM) bikes,
and bird hunting? Yes.
While Kerry shows his laek of
sports knowledge. Bush's tenure as
ownei of the I'exas Rangers shows
that while he might be a good (read:
corrupt) businessman, he doesn't care
about the interests of baseball fans.
Before I even begin to discuss
Bush's ownership, let me first point
out that this is a man who choked on
a pret/el while watching a Ravens-
I )olphins playoff game in 2(X)2.1 lon
estlv. I'm pretty undecided on what
this means either this is a man
who enjoys watching football and
eating deliciously salted, football-re
lated food products (good), or this is
a man who is incapable of chewing
properly and watching sports (bad).
If you choose the latter option,
than you might agree that the multi
tasking required in leading our coun
try is slighily more difficult than
pretzel eating and football-watching
(combined!), and that Bush might be
incapable of such a task.
But his record as the owner of the
I'exas Rangers (circa 19K9-98)
shows that Mush also lacks sports
knowledge.
First, in 1994 he was the only
owner in baseball to vote against the
introduction of the wild card, and
claimed that I listory will prove me
i ight. ()nly problem is that the cruel
hands of history have worked

against Bush and have revealed that
the wild card is good for the fans —
it creates late-season excitement for
games that would otherwise be
meaningless — and for businesses,
due to the revenue generated by
extra playoff games.
Second, his intentions in buying
the Rangers were politically moti
vated (he needed exposure to run for
governor), and he extorted the tax
payers of Arlington into paying fora
new stadium by threatening to move
the team.
And third, he traded Sammy "I'll
complain about being humiliated for
batting 6th in the Cubs' order" Sosa
to the White Sox, which Bush called
"the biggest mistake of his adult
hood."
Well, as long as the biggest mis
take of his lifetime is sports-related,
I give Bush credit for admitting this
error.
In reality, your vote doesn't real
ly matter.
According to somebody who
compiles interesting factoids like
this, the outcome of Washington
Redskins football games has cor
rectly predicted the winner of every
U.S. presidential election since 1936.
In the previous 15 elections, if the
Redskins have won their last home
game prior to the election (the Skins
played at home this Sunday against
the Packers), the incumbent party
has remained in the White House.

Kerry throws like a girl,
but Bush traded Sosa

But Brett Favre and his sore wrist
came up big in D.C. last night, earn
ing Green Bay a 28-14 victory. So
based on the Packers' win. Kerry will
claim a hotly contested election that
will go back and forth right up until
the end.
Bottom line: both Presidential
candidates really aren't sports fans
(or at least don't have the interests of
sports fans in mind), and don't de
serve my vote. Perhaps they should
stick to White House games of Wiffle
ball and Easter egg hunts and debat
ing whether "the growth of spectator
sports in the western world in the last
half century is an indication of the de
cline of western civilization." some
thing Kerry resolved as a prepster at
St. Paul's in New Hampshire.
Find out for yourself when they
appear on Sports Center, as each
candidate has separate 30-minute in
terviews with Jim Gray.
So. with that said, my vote goes to
the only qualified candidate: Pedro
Sanchez, of course. Duh! Get out
and vote.

based on the Packers' win. Kerry will
claim a hotly contested election that
will go back and forth right up until
the end.
Bottom line: both Presidential
candidates really aren't sports fans
(or at least don't have the interests of
sports fans in mind), and don't de
serve my vote. Perhaps they should
stick to White House games of Wiffle
ball and Easter egg hunts and debat
ing whether "the growth of spectator
sports in the western world in the last
half century is an indication of the de
cline of western civilization." some
thing Kerry resolved as a prepster at
St. Paul's in New Hampshire.
Find out for yourself when they
appear on Sports Center, as each
candidate has separate 30-minute in
terviews with Jim Gray.
So. with that said, my vote goes to
the only qualified candidate: Pedro
Sanchez, of course. Duh! Get out
and vote.

I think we all know what significance this
week holds — if you flip on the telly, ev
eryone's discussing an event that will de
fine our nation. And clearly, I'm referring to
Thursday's much-anticipated return of "The
OC." People also tell me that America elects
a president tomorrow, hut this is clearly less
important than the Giants winning a World
Series, the Giants acquiring Pedro as a closer
(peep the Philadelphia Daily News for this
story). Justin Timberlake's

appearance on "The OC,"
or virtually anything else
that's remotely sports-relat
ed (like analyzing why
Bronson Arroyo has corn
rows).
Apparently people vote
for presidential candidates
based on their stances on
foreign policy, domestic pol
icy. personality and a whole

host of other factors that have been discussed
ad nauseum in my poli sci classes. But basing
your vote on such factors is completely asi
nine, and, dare I say, irresponsible. I hope we
all recognize that sports carry far greater im
plications in life than politics. Thus, for people
who agree with that view, here's my presiden
tial primer for tomorrow's election.
First, let's start with the challenger: Sena
tor John Kerry. Riding the coattails of
Boston's World Series victory, an alleged
sports fan like Kerry would seize the moment
and attack Bush's record as owner of the
Texas Rangers. But this is exactly where
Kerry goes wrong — he's a) the definition of a
bandwagon Red Sox fan and b) not really a
sports fan at all.
Let's take a look at his Boston Red Sox
knowledge. Strike one: he called Manny
Ramirez "Manny Ortiz." Strike two: He
called six-time AL walk leader and career .254
hitter Eddie "The Walking Man" Yost his fa
vorite Red Sox player, the slight problem with
this being that Eddie never played for the
BoSox. Strike three: When Kerry corrected
his Manny Ramirez / David Ortiz error, he
still conjured the gringo within and pro
nounced Ortiz as "Ortez." Strike four: He
acted as if he'd never thrown a baseball be
fore, bouncing the ceremonial first pitch be
fore the July 25 Red Sox-Yankees game.
Minor errors? Perhaps. Knowledgeable

sports tan? No. I lite sports fan who
enjoys windsurfing. $12.(XM) bikes,
and bird hunting? Yes.
While Kerry shows his laek of
sports knowledge. Bush's tenure as
ownei of the I'exas Rangers shows
that while he might be a good (read:
corrupt) businessman, he doesn't care
about the interests of baseball fans.
Before I even begin to discuss
Bush's ownership, let me first point
out that this is a man who choked on
a pret/el while watching a Ravens-
I )olphins playoff game in 2(X)2.1 lon
estlv. I'm pretty undecided on what
this means either this is a man
who enjoys watching football and
eating deliciously salted, football-re
lated food products (good), or this is
a man who is incapable of chewing
properly and watching sports (bad).
If you choose the latter option,
than you might agree that the multi
tasking required in leading our coun
try is slighily more difficult than
pretzel eating and football-watching
(combined!), and that Bush might be
incapable of such a task.
But his record as the owner of the
I'exas Rangers (circa 19K9-98)
shows that Mush also lacks sports
knowledge.
First, in 1994 he was the only
owner in baseball to vote against the
introduction of the wild card, and
claimed that I listory will prove me
i ight. ()nly problem is that the cruel
hands of history have worked

against Bush and have revealed that
the wild card is good for the fans —
it creates late-season excitement for
games that would otherwise be
meaningless — and for businesses,
due to the revenue generated by
extra playoff games.
Second, his intentions in buying
the Rangers were politically moti
vated (he needed exposure to run for
governor), and he extorted the tax
payers of Arlington into paying fora
new stadium by threatening to move
the team.
And third, he traded Sammy "I'll
complain about being humiliated for
batting 6th in the Cubs' order" Sosa
to the White Sox, which Bush called
"the biggest mistake of his adult
hood."
Well, as long as the biggest mis
take of his lifetime is sports-related,
I give Bush credit for admitting this
error.
In reality, your vote doesn't real
ly matter.
According to somebody who
compiles interesting factoids like
this, the outcome of Washington
Redskins football games has cor
rectly predicted the winner of every
U.S. presidential election since 1936.
In the previous 15 elections, if the
Redskins have won their last home
game prior to the election (the Skins
played at home this Sunday against
the Packers), the incumbent party
has remained in the White House.

Kerry throws like a girl,
but Bush traded Sosa

But Brett Favre and his sore wrist
came up big in D.C. last night, earn
ing Green Bay a 28-14 victory. So
based on the Packers' win. Kerry will
claim a hotly contested election that
will go back and forth right up until
the end.
