# Stanford comes up empty at UCLA
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LOS ANGELES — Stanford has played tremen
dous defense all season long, and Saturday's game
was no exception. The Cardinal held the powerful
UCLA offense to its second-lowest point total of
the season, allowing just two scores in 14 offensive
drives.
Unfortunately for Stanford — and its waning
bowl hopes — the Cardinal offense wouldn't reach
the red zone until the end of the fourth quarter. It
managed just four drives of 30 or more yards, with
each such drive ending in an interception or a
turnover on downs.
The end result was a 21-0 loss for the Cardinal
(4-4,2-3 Pacific-10 Conference), which lost by more
than a touchdown for the first time all year, and an
inspiring shutout for the Bruins (5-3.3-2), their first
in the Pac-10 since 1987.
The worst part of it was, the Bruins dared Stan
ford to attack their biggest weakness. UCLA en
tered the game allowing 227.3 rushing yards per
game, but throughout the game, they dropped five
men back in pass coverage.
"They dared us to run the ball, and we couldn't,"
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said. "In the
passing game, they had extra guys in coverage."
Stanford managed just 83 rushing yards on 33
carries, which made it a long afternoon for quarter
back Trent Edwards and his wide receivers.
"The problem is, philosophy-wise, we're going
to throw it to set up the run, and they just said, 'For
get it, we're gonna drop back,"' offensive coordina
tor Bill Cubit said.
Edwards completed 24-of-46 passes for 224
yards and was intercepted three times, completing
just three passes of 10 or more yards.
"We couldn't establish the run early, and that's
any defensive back's dream." Edwards said. "It's a
good football team. UCLA, but we're better than
that."
Stanford's defense didn't make many mistakes,
but, as Teevens said, "you can't win if you don't
score."
The Bruins made their share of mistakes — the
previously perfect Justin Medlock missed two field
goals, Maurice Drew and Drew Olson both com
mitted turnovers and the offense failed to convert a
fourth-and-three on the first drive of the game —
but they ran for 246 yards and got a serviceable per
formance out of quarterback Olson.
Olson was 17-of-28 for 177 yards, but he went 4-
of-4 for 83 yards on the Bruins' third drive, which
culminated in a 2-yard touchdown run by Manuel
White, who finished with 87 yards on just 12 carries.
After that, it was all Maurice Drew.
Early in the second quarter, Stanford punted
from its own 30-yard line. Jay Ottovegio hung up a
high. 38-yard kick, which the frighteningly fast
Drew rushed up to field in a crowd. Stanford's gun-
ners overran Drew, who bounced off a block and outraced
the coverage team to the end zone fora 68-yard touchdown
return.
Drew, who had 105 yards on just 12 carries and caught five
passes for 23 yards, would also catch a 3-yard pass from
Olson early in the fourth for the game's final touchdown.
"We put a lot of expectations on him, but he always finds
the end zone and scores touchdowns," Bruins head coach
Karl Dorrell said. "He's doing exactly what we've asked him
to do."
Stanford's defense did exactly what it was supposed to do,
limiting the Bruins' offense. It may not have won, but it
played a winning game.
"Our defense played very, very hard," said senior
linebacker David Bergeron. "That's the hallmark that we're
trying to leave as a legacy of the 2004 defense. The one thing
you can control every play is effort."
That effort was apparent throughout Saturday's contest,
whether it was Kevin Schimmelman making a backpedaling
interception and later forcing a fumble on the goal line or the
defensive line holding the Bruins to a 4-of-13 conversion rate
on third down, including several stops on third-and-short.
"Our coaches did a great job of preparing us," Bergeron
said. "We knew the majority of the time what play they were
gonna run based on how they lined up and their tendencies."
Unfortunately, the Stanford defense wasn't the only one
with a solid game plan.
"We knew this performance was coming," Dorrell said.
Against the Bruins' two-deep coverage scheme, only
flanker Greg Camarillo and tight end Alex Smith, both se
niors, were able to have any success as receivers, accounting
for 186 of Stanford's 224 passing yards.The main wideouts —
Evan Moore, Mark Bradford and Justin McCullum —
caught a combined total of three passes for 17 yards.
"They were just manning us up outside and playing zone
on the inside," Smith explained.
With UCLA's speedy cornerbacks and excellent safeties
neutralizing the outside, Edwards' only option was to try the
middle of the field, where Smith and Camarillo both proved
successful.
Smith caught 10 balls for 136 yards, including a 71-yarder
in the fourth quarter, and Camarillo had four catches for 50
yards. Also, Stanford's running backs totaled seven catches,
as Edwards rarely was able to find a man open downfield and
had to check down to his running backs under pressure.
"He was scrambling an awful lot," Smith said of Edwards,
who rushed 11 times for 28 yards. "He was just trying to find
something in that zone."
After Edwards' 71-yard strike to Smith late in the fourth,
Stanford had first-and-goal from the Bruins' 8-yard line, but

couldn't complete a pass into the end zone against a fired-up
Bruins defense.
It was a frustrating afternoon for Stanford, which now
faces difficult road games against No. 7 California and No. 20
Arizona State.
The Cardinal will need to win at least one of those games,
as well as their home game against an Oregon State squad
that's won its last three games, to secure an invitation to one
of the Pac-10's seven affiliated howl games.
"We need to win all three," Edwards said. "It's just all on
the offense. These are three great defenses ahead of us, hut
we still have confidence in the guys."
Added Bergeron: "We're not gonna finish the season like
this. We're gonna bounce back."

caught a combined total of three passes for 17 yards.
"They were just manning us up outside and playing zone
on the inside," Smith explained.
With UCLA's speedy cornerbacks and excellent safeties
neutralizing the outside, Edwards' only option was to try the
middle of the field, where Smith and Camarillo both proved
successful.
Smith caught 10 balls for 136 yards, including a 71-yarder
in the fourth quarter, and Camarillo had four catches for 50
yards. Also, Stanford's running backs totaled seven catches,
as Edwards rarely was able to find a man open downfield and
had to check down to his running backs under pressure.
"He was scrambling an awful lot," Smith said of Edwards,
who rushed 11 times for 28 yards. "He was just trying to find
something in that zone."
After Edwards' 71-yard strike to Smith late in the fourth,
Stanford had first-and-goal from the Bruins' 8-yard line, but

It was a frustrating afternoon for Stanford, which now
faces difficult road games against No. 7 California and No. 20
Arizona State.
The Cardinal will need to win at least one of those games,
as well as their home game against an Oregon State squad
that's won its last three games, to secure an invitation to one
of the Pac-10's seven affiliated howl games.
"We need to win all three," Edwards said. "It's just all on
the offense. These are three great defenses ahead of us, hut
we still have confidence in the guys."
Added Bergeron: "We're not gonna finish the season like
this. We're gonna bounce back."

Trent Edwards was under heavy pressure all afternoon, putting
up 224 yards passing but failing to provide any points.
LOS ANGELES — Stanford has played tremen
dous defense all season long, and Saturday's game
was no exception. The Cardinal held the powerful
UCLA offense to its second-lowest point total of
the season, allowing just two scores in 14 offensive
drives.
Unfortunately for Stanford — and its waning
bowl hopes — the Cardinal offense wouldn't reach
the red zone until the end of the fourth quarter. It
managed just four drives of 30 or more yards, with
each such drive ending in an interception or a
turnover on downs.
The end result was a 21-0 loss for the Cardinal
(4-4,2-3 Pacific-10 Conference), which lost by more
than a touchdown for the first time all year, and an
inspiring shutout for the Bruins (5-3.3-2), their first
in the Pac-10 since 1987.
The worst part of it was, the Bruins dared Stan
ford to attack their biggest weakness. UCLA en
tered the game allowing 227.3 rushing yards per
game, but throughout the game, they dropped five
men back in pass coverage.
"They dared us to run the ball, and we couldn't,"
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said. "In the
passing game, they had extra guys in coverage."
Stanford managed just 83 rushing yards on 33
carries, which made it a long afternoon for quarter
back Trent Edwards and his wide receivers.
"The problem is, philosophy-wise, we're going
to throw it to set up the run, and they just said, 'For
get it, we're gonna drop back,"' offensive coordina
tor Bill Cubit said.
Edwards completed 24-of-46 passes for 224
yards and was intercepted three times, completing
just three passes of 10 or more yards.
"We couldn't establish the run early, and that's
any defensive back's dream." Edwards said. "It's a
good football team. UCLA, but we're better than
that."
Stanford's defense didn't make many mistakes,
but, as Teevens said, "you can't win if you don't
score."
The Bruins made their share of mistakes — the
previously perfect Justin Medlock missed two field
goals, Maurice Drew and Drew Olson both com
mitted turnovers and the offense failed to convert a
fourth-and-three on the first drive of the game —
but they ran for 246 yards and got a serviceable per
formance out of quarterback Olson.
Olson was 17-of-28 for 177 yards, but he went 4-
of-4 for 83 yards on the Bruins' third drive, which
culminated in a 2-yard touchdown run by Manuel
White, who finished with 87 yards on just 12 carries.
After that, it was all Maurice Drew.
Early in the second quarter, Stanford punted
from its own 30-yard line. Jay Ottovegio hung up a
high. 38-yard kick, which the frighteningly fast
Drew rushed up to field in a crowd. Stanford's gun-
ners overran Drew, who bounced off a block and outraced
the coverage team to the end zone fora 68-yard touchdown
return.
Drew, who had 105 yards on just 12 carries and caught five
passes for 23 yards, would also catch a 3-yard pass from
Olson early in the fourth for the game's final touchdown.
"We put a lot of expectations on him, but he always finds
the end zone and scores touchdowns," Bruins head coach
Karl Dorrell said. "He's doing exactly what we've asked him
to do."
Stanford's defense did exactly what it was supposed to do,
limiting the Bruins' offense. It may not have won, but it
played a winning game.
"Our defense played very, very hard," said senior
linebacker David Bergeron. "That's the hallmark that we're
trying to leave as a legacy of the 2004 defense. The one thing
you can control every play is effort."
That effort was apparent throughout Saturday's contest,
whether it was Kevin Schimmelman making a backpedaling
interception and later forcing a fumble on the goal line or the
defensive line holding the Bruins to a 4-of-13 conversion rate
on third down, including several stops on third-and-short.
"Our coaches did a great job of preparing us," Bergeron
said. "We knew the majority of the time what play they were
gonna run based on how they lined up and their tendencies."
Unfortunately, the Stanford defense wasn't the only one
with a solid game plan.
"We knew this performance was coming," Dorrell said.
Against the Bruins' two-deep coverage scheme, only
flanker Greg Camarillo and tight end Alex Smith, both se
niors, were able to have any success as receivers, accounting
for 186 of Stanford's 224 passing yards.The main wideouts —
Evan Moore, Mark Bradford and Justin McCullum —
caught a combined total of three passes for 17 yards.
"They were just manning us up outside and playing zone
