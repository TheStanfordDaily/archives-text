# Stanford comes up empty at UCLA

### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LOS ANGELES — Stanford has played tremen
dous defense all season long, and Saturday's game
was no exception. The Cardinal held the powerful
UCLA offense to its second-lowest point total of
the season, allowing just two scores in 14 offensive
drives.
Unfortunately for Stanford — and its waning
bowl hopes — the Cardinal offense wouldn't reach
the red zone until the end of the fourth quarter. It
managed just four drives of 30 or more yards, with
each such drive ending in an interception or a
turnover on downs.
The end result was a 21-0 loss for the Cardinal
(4-4,2-3 Pacific-10 Conference), which lost by more
than a touchdown for the first time all year, and an
inspiring shutout for the Bruins (5-3.3-2), their first
in the Pac-10 since 1987.
The worst part of it was, the Bruins dared Stan
ford to attack their biggest weakness. UCLA en
tered the game allowing 227.3 rushing yards per
game, but throughout the game, they dropped five
men back in pass coverage.
"They dared us to run the ball, and we couldn't,"
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said. "In the
passing game, they had extra guys in coverage."
Stanford managed just 83 rushing yards on 33
carries, which made it a long afternoon for quarter
back Trent Edwards and his wide receivers.
"The problem is, philosophy-wise, we're going
to throw it to set up the run, and they just said, 'For
get it, we're gonna drop back,"' offensive coordina
tor Bill Cubit said.
Edwards completed 24-of-46 passes for 224
yards and was intercepted three times, completing
just three passes of 10 or more yards.
"We couldn't establish the run early, and that's
any defensive back's dream." Edwards said. "It's a
good football team. UCLA, but we're better than
that."
Stanford's defense didn't make many mistakes,
but, as Teevens said, "you can't win if you don't
score."
The Bruins made their share of mistakes — the
previously perfect Justin Medlock missed two field
goals, Maurice Drew and Drew Olson both com
mitted turnovers and the offense failed to convert a
fourth-and-three on the first drive of the game —
but they ran for 246 yards and got a serviceable per
formance out of quarterback Olson.
Olson was 17-of-28 for 177 yards, but he went 4-
of-4 for 83 yards on the Bruins' third drive, which
culminated in a 2-yard touchdown run by Manuel
White, who finished with 87 yards on just 12 carries.
After that, it was all Maurice Drew.
Early in the second quarter, Stanford punted
from its own 30-yard line. Jay Ottovegio hung up a
high. 38-yard kick, which the frighteningly fast
Drew rushed up to field in a crowd. Stanford's gun-
