# Bruin defense shuts down ground game
## 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Stanford, this weekend's
blowout loss to UCLA was hard to
see coming. In the three previous de
feats this season the Cardinal had
lost by a combined 14 points. Against
a team that, coming into the match
up with Stanford, was giving up 28.4
points per game and 237.3 yards per
game rushing, the Cardinal were sup
posed to get their offense back on
track after struggling last week
against Oregon.
"Am I stunned to be shut out? Yes.
We're better than that offensively,"
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens
said.
The performance by UCLA's de
fense was shocking. The Bruins were
ranked second-to-last in the Pac-10 in

passing defense and last in both rush
ing defense and total defense. This was
UCLA's first shutout since 1996 and
its first Pac-10 shutout since 1987.
The real key in the game defensive
ly for UCLA was an aspect where the
Bruins had been questionable all year
long â€” stopping the running game.
The Cardinal picked up only 88 yards
on 33 rush attempts, but many of those
came on scrambles by quarterback
Trent Edwards.
Edwards was often flushed out of
the pocket and forced to run with the
ball. He had 11 of Stanford's 33 carries
for 28 yards.
The tandem of tailbacks J. R. Lemon
and Kenneth Tolon combined for only
42 yards on 18 carries.
"We couldn't establish the run
early," Edwards said. "We were
forced to second- and third-and-long."

Once the Bruins shut down the run
they were able to sit back and defend
the pass. UCLA found success in leav
ing only four men to rush the passer
and stop the run. leaving seven players
to cover the pass.
"They played in a 2-deep cover
scheme all day," Teevens said. "They
took one guy and dropped him into
coverage and challenged us to throw
the ball."
Edwards frequently had trouble
finding open receivers with the Bruins
putting so many defensive backs into
coverage.
"It's any DB's dream to just sit
back there and not have to worry
about underneath coverage," Ed
wards said.
