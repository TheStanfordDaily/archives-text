# Bruin defense shuts down ground game
## 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Stanford, this weekend's
blowout loss to UCLA was hard to
see coming. In the three previous de
feats this season the Cardinal had
lost by a combined 14 points. Against
a team that, coming into the match
up with Stanford, was giving up 28.4
points per game and 237.3 yards per
game rushing, the Cardinal were sup
posed to get their offense back on
track after struggling last week
against Oregon.
"Am I stunned to be shut out? Yes.
We're better than that offensively,"
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens
said.
The performance by UCLA's de
fense was shocking. The Bruins were
ranked second-to-last in the Pac-10 in

passing defense and last in both rush
ing defense and total defense. This was
UCLA's first shutout since 1996 and
its first Pac-10 shutout since 1987.
The real key in the game defensive
ly for UCLA was an aspect where the
Bruins had been questionable all year
long — stopping the running game.
The Cardinal picked up only 88 yards
on 33 rush attempts, but many of those
came on scrambles by quarterback
Trent Edwards.
Edwards was often flushed out of
the pocket and forced to run with the
ball. He had 11 of Stanford's 33 carries
for 28 yards.
The tandem of tailbacks J. R. Lemon
and Kenneth Tolon combined for only
42 yards on 18 carries.
"We couldn't establish the run
early," Edwards said. "We were
forced to second- and third-and-long."

Once the Bruins shut down the run
they were able to sit back and defend
the pass. UCLA found success in leav
ing only four men to rush the passer
and stop the run. leaving seven players
to cover the pass.
"They played in a 2-deep cover
scheme all day," Teevens said. "They
took one guy and dropped him into
coverage and challenged us to throw
the ball."
Edwards frequently had trouble
finding open receivers with the Bruins
putting so many defensive backs into
coverage.
"It's any DB's dream to just sit
back there and not have to worry
about underneath coverage," Ed
wards said.

team that had given up 93 points in their last two
games.
"Our defense really came out to play at the per
fect time." UCLA coach Karl Dorrell said. "We
got a shutout against a very good offense, stopped
the running game and did great things in pass cov
erage and got some interceptions. That was a good
young defense you saw today."
UCLA's defensive effort was led by linebacker
Spencer Havner, who had a game-high 16 tackles
and one interception. Havner's interception
couldn't have come at a better time for the Bruins.
With Stanford trailing 14-0 at the half, the Car
dinal received the kickoff and drove quickly to the
UCLA 20 yard line. Havner stepped in front of an
Edwards pass intended for Evan Moore and re
turned it to near midfield. It was Edwards' third
interception of the day, and the second that was
picked in UCLA territory.
Throughout the game Stanford had chances to
score, but never could put the ball in the end zone.
"We just played terrible," said Stanford offen
sive coordinator Bill Cubit. "In the first half the
third down ratio was good, the plays were good,
the time of possession was good, we just didn't
make plays to get us into the end zone."
The Cardinal equaled the Bruins in many key
offensive categories that often decide the game,
but simply couldn't score. Edwards out-threw
UCLA quarterback Drew Olson 224 to 177 yards.
Stanford also won the time of possession battle
and had a much better third-down conversion

ratio. However, the Cardinal failed to score in two
trips into the red zone, while UCLA scored on two
of their four trips inside the 20.
The failure to successfully run the ball cost
Stanford dearly in both red-zone possessions. The
first resulted in the interception by Havner, but
the second came towards the end of the game.
After a long pass to tight end Alex Smith moved
the ball within the UCLA 10 yard line, Stanford
passed four straight downs, failing to score on
each.
"What I told the guys at the end is that it's a
team deal," Teevens said. "The offense didn't
carry its end of the bargain. Defensively, we did
what we came to do. We played hard."
After this weekend's loss to UCLA, the Cardi
nal have an uphill battle to make it to the six-win
mark needed to pick up a bowl bid. With three
contests remaining, the Cardinal have two road
games. It will be almost impossible to pick up two
more victories if the offense can't get back on
track.
Stanford linebacker David Bergeron still had
faith in the team to get it done.
"We have the tools to win games," he said.
"This was a fluke. The rest of the season isn't going
to be like this."
If the offense can't match up to the play of
Bergeron and the defense, the Cardinal face a
third consecutive losing season and another year
without a bowl berth.

After this weekend's loss to UCLA, the Cardi
nal have an uphill battle to make it to the six-win
mark needed to pick up a bowl bid. With three
contests remaining, the Cardinal have two road
games. It will be almost impossible to pick up two
more victories if the offense can't get back on
track.
Stanford linebacker David Bergeron still had
faith in the team to get it done.
"We have the tools to win games," he said.
"This was a fluke. The rest of the season isn't going
to be like this."
If the offense can't match up to the play of
Bergeron and the defense, the Cardinal face a
third consecutive losing season and another year
without a bowl berth.
For Stanford, this weekend's
blowout loss to UCLA was hard to
see coming. In the three previous de
feats this season the Cardinal had
lost by a combined 14 points. Against
a team that, coming into the match
up with Stanford, was giving up 28.4
points per game and 237.3 yards per
game rushing, the Cardinal were sup
posed to get their offense back on
track after struggling last week
against Oregon.
"Am I stunned to be shut out? Yes.
We're better than that offensively,"
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens
said.
The performance by UCLA's de
fense was shocking. The Bruins were
ranked second-to-last in the Pac-10 in

passing defense and last in both rush
ing defense and total defense. This was
UCLA's first shutout since 1996 and
its first Pac-10 shutout since 1987.
The real key in the game defensive
ly for UCLA was an aspect where the
Bruins had been questionable all year
long — stopping the running game.
The Cardinal picked up only 88 yards
on 33 rush attempts, but many of those
came on scrambles by quarterback
Trent Edwards.
Edwards was often flushed out of
the pocket and forced to run with the
ball. He had 11 of Stanford's 33 carries
for 28 yards.
The tandem of tailbacks J. R. Lemon
and Kenneth Tolon combined for only
42 yards on 18 carries.
"We couldn't establish the run
early," Edwards said. "We were
forced to second- and third-and-long."

Once the Bruins shut down the run
they were able to sit back and defend
the pass. UCLA found success in leav
ing only four men to rush the passer
and stop the run. leaving seven players
to cover the pass.
"They played in a 2-deep cover
scheme all day," Teevens said. "They
took one guy and dropped him into
coverage and challenged us to throw
the ball."
Edwards frequently had trouble
finding open receivers with the Bruins
putting so many defensive backs into
coverage.
"It's any DB's dream to just sit
back there and not have to worry
about underneath coverage," Ed
wards said.

team that had given up 93 points in their last two
games.
"Our defense really came out to play at the per
fect time." UCLA coach Karl Dorrell said. "We
got a shutout against a very good offense, stopped
the running game and did great things in pass cov
erage and got some interceptions. That was a good
young defense you saw today."
UCLA's defensive effort was led by linebacker
Spencer Havner, who had a game-high 16 tackles
and one interception. Havner's interception
couldn't have come at a better time for the Bruins.
With Stanford trailing 14-0 at the half, the Car
dinal received the kickoff and drove quickly to the
UCLA 20 yard line. Havner stepped in front of an
Edwards pass intended for Evan Moore and re
turned it to near midfield. It was Edwards' third
interception of the day, and the second that was
picked in UCLA territory.
Throughout the game Stanford had chances to
score, but never could put the ball in the end zone.
"We just played terrible," said Stanford offen
sive coordinator Bill Cubit. "In the first half the
third down ratio was good, the plays were good,
the time of possession was good, we just didn't
make plays to get us into the end zone."
The Cardinal equaled the Bruins in many key
offensive categories that often decide the game,
but simply couldn't score. Edwards out-threw
UCLA quarterback Drew Olson 224 to 177 yards.
Stanford also won the time of possession battle
and had a much better third-down conversion

ratio. However, the Cardinal failed to score in two
trips into the red zone, while UCLA scored on two
of their four trips inside the 20.
The failure to successfully run the ball cost
Stanford dearly in both red-zone possessions. The
first resulted in the interception by Havner, but
the second came towards the end of the game.
After a long pass to tight end Alex Smith moved
the ball within the UCLA 10 yard line, Stanford
passed four straight downs, failing to score on
each.
"What I told the guys at the end is that it's a
team deal," Teevens said. "The offense didn't
carry its end of the bargain. Defensively, we did
what we came to do. We played hard."
