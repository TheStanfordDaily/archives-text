# Women sweep OSU, Oregon at Maloney
## 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After taking just nine shots in two games last weekend
against UCLA and Southern California, the Stanford
women's soccer team was primed for an offensive explosion
this weekend against visiting Oregon (3-12-2, 0-6-1 Pac-10)
and Oregon State (8-9-1,2-4-1 Pac-10).
Indeed the No. 14 Cardinal (12-4-2, 4-2-1 Pac-10) looked
nothing like the team that was shut out by the Bruins just a
week ago, as they heat both the Ducks and the Beavers for
their first conference sweep of the season. The offense com
bined for 32 shots on the weekend thanks in large part to an
18-shot performance against the Ducks on Friday night.
While the offensive explosion comes against two of the
Pac-10's weakest defensive teams, the Cardinal know they
cannot take any victories for granted given the depth of the
conference this season.
With the NCAA playoffs set to begin in two weeks and the
Cardinal looking to capture their seventh straight bid. now is
as good as a time as any for the Cardinal offense to gain some
stability and momentum.
"Last weekend we came out a little timid and we probably
didn't come out with as much aggression as we needed to,"
said senior midfielder Amy Grady. "You're not to score if you
don't bring your offensive game, so we've got to keep doing
that."
The Cardinal opened up their
weekend with a late-afternoon
matchup against the Ducks on Fri
day. The Cardinal thoroughly con
trolled their last-place opponent,
out-shooting the Ducks 18-5.
Despite the aggressive attack on
the opponent's net. the Cardinal
struggled to put the game away.
They were held scoreless through
the entire first half and much of the
second as Duck goalkeeper
Domenique Lainez collected six
saves behind a resilient defense
that kept the game from getting out
of control.
However, the Cardinal knew it
was only a matter of time before
their efforts paid off. and they re
mained focused for the entire W
minutes of play.
Sophomore defender Shari
Summers finally broke the game
open in the 81st minute of regula
tion with her second goal of the sea
son. The play began when senior
forward Marcie Ward fired a long
pass to fellow senior forward Na
talie Sanderson, win) was waiting in
the far left corner of the Ducks'
zone. Sanderson booted a cross
pass to Summers, who redirected
the ball into the left side of the net
for the score.
The Cardinal weren't finished
there, however, as Ward would
find the net just two minutes later
to put her team up 2-0. Ward broke
down the field on a pass from junior
midfielder Leah Tapscott and car
ried the ball to the left corner,
where she fired off the shot for her
eighth goal of the season.
The Cardinal were able to do
two things effectively on Friday
that they have struggled to do in re
cent games. First, the Cardinal put
up a balanced offensive attack
through both halves, posting 11
shots in the first half and seven in
the second. Last week against the
Women of Troy, the Cardinal kept
the game wide open by putting up
only one shot in the second half.
The Cardinal defense also did a

better job at supporting its for
wards and midfielders on offense,
as evidenced by Summers' goal.
Against the Bruins last Friday, the
Cardinal defense did a poor job at
augmenting its offensive attack,
leading to difficulties in pushing the
ball up the field.
"1 think we're moving up as a
team," said head coach Paul Rat
cliffe. "The defenders are making a
big impact."
With 695 people on hand yester
day afternoon, the Cardinal picked
up right where they left off, posting
a 1-0 victory over Oregon State.
Tapscott scored what would turn
out,to be the game-winner in just
the 27th minute of play on an as
sisted pass from senior defender
Emilee Shim.
The day began with pre-game
ceremonies honoring the Cardi
nal's seven departing seniors in
their final game ever at Maloney
Field. Although this ceremony is
always an emotional moment for
the team, the Cardinal were able to
turn those feelings into a hard
earned win.
"It was a really good feeling,"
said Grady, one of the team's de-

parting seniors. "To get a result in
any game that you want to win is
good, but it's a little extra special
[today]."
Unlike Friday evening, the Car
dinal jumped out to an early lead
against the Beavers and never
looked back. Despite failing to
score again after Tapscott's goal,
the Cardinal kept the game under
control on both ends of the field.
The offense created several scoring
opportunities while the defense
limited the Beaver offense to just
four shots on goal.
While the Cardinal come away
with a solid sweep this weekend,
they now have to set their sights
ahead to next weekend's match-up
against the Washington schools.
The Cardinal have set themselves
up fora shot at the Pac-10 title, but
will need to come away with a
sweep in their final two Pac-10
matchups.
"Everybody in the Pac-10 has
two losses, so it was a critical win
for us," said Ratcliffe. "It's up in
the air. and it's going to go to the
last weekend here. This is a good
place."
