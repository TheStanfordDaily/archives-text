# Ruskin highlights differences in tight race
## 
### DAVID HERBERT DESK EDITOR 
In tomorrow's vote for the State Assembly in
the 21st district, pollsters say the race between
Democrat Ira Ruskin and Republican Steve
Poizner is too close to call.
Ruskin, a city councilman and former mayor
from Redwood City, has been working hard to
distinguish himself from the socially moderate
Poizner. Both are pro-choice and favor proposi
tion 71, which would cause the state to fund stem
cell research.
Poizner has also capitalized on the endorse
ment of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and has
eagerly accepted the label of "Arnold Republi
can." This moderate position, combined with
Poizner's personal wealth, have made what

looked to be an easy victory for Ruskin in the
heavily Democratic district into a nail-biter.
In an effort to break the deadlock, Ruskin,
who earned a master's degree in communication
from Stanford in 1983, has worked to define
himself as an unabashed liberal in recent weeks,
highlighting some of the social and economic
positions on which he and Foizner part ways.
The Ruskin camp has rolled out television
spots citing Poizner's donation to President
George W. Bush's re-election campaign and
sporting the slogan "Ira Ruskin: We know
where he stands," a jab at his opponent, who has
never held elected office.
In a debate with Poizner on Oct. 20, Ruskin
tried to underscore those differences, drawing
attention to what he described as one of the
biggest differences between the candidates: his

support for proposition 72, which would keep a
state law that requires large and medium-sized
companies to pay for health care coverage for
their employees and dependents. Poizner op
poses the proposition.
"To have a humane society and an advanced
society in our state, we need to address the
health care issue," Ruskin told to the San Mateo
County Times. "[Proposition 72] is not perfect,
but we need to keep it in place to negotiate fora
more universal health care system."
Ruskin also sought to contrast his experience
with that of political newcomer Poizner.
"The best gauge of what a person will do is
what they have done," Ruskin said in the debate
with Poizner. "I feel prepared and ready to go to
Sacramento to represent you there."
