After dropping their last regular season game 4-0 to
No. 15 Cal (15-4, 5-1 Northern Pacific Athletic Con
ference), the conference-winless Stanford women's
field hockey team (6-11,0-6 NorPac) hopes that it can
ambush its unsuspecting conference opponents in the
upcoming NorPac tournament.
The Cardinal lost their third game in a row on Sat
urday at Maxwell Family Field in Berkeley as the
Bears claimed the NorPac conference title. Stanford
managed to keep the score close in the first half, trail
ing 1-0 going into the locker room. The Cardinal out
shot the Bears 4-3 in the first period.
In the second half, the Bears tallied three more
goals.
"The final score today didn't really reflect the type
of game this was," said Stanford head coach Lesley
Irvine. "We had some very good moments, but we
squandered a lot of opportunities and California was
clinical with their chances."
The Bears opened the scoring with a goal in the
sixth minute from Amber Madsen on the first of three
assists from Jenna Long. The Cardinal played the
Bears even for the rest of the half as neither squad
managed tot) many scoring opportunities.
A few costly Stanford mistakes allowed the Bears
to pull away in the second half. The Bears scored with

in the first two minutes of the second half, as Maggie
Grimes converted on an assist from Valentina God
frid. Godfrid later added two goals of her own off of
penalty corners in the 57th and 59th minutes.
The match against Stanford marked Godfrid's
fourth multi-goal game of the season. With an assist
and two goals, Godfrid set school records for points in
a season and goals in a season. Her 51 points this sea
son vaulted her past current Cal assistant coach Megan
Sainsbury, who set the mark in 1999, for points accu
mulated in a single season. Godfrid's two goals give
her 20 this season, one more than the previous record
set by Renee Chatas in 1983.
With the regular season over, the Cardinal now
have the NorPac tournament to look forward to.
"It's time to recollect ourselves and get focused on
the NorPac Tournament." Irvine said. "This is a great
opportunity for us, and I have high expectations. Every
team begins this event with a shot to win it and move
on to the postseason. We get to wipe our slate clean."
As the fourth seed in the NorPac West division, the
Cardinal will face the top seed in the NorPac East.
