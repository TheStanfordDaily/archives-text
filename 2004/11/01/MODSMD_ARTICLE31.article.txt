### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he crowd al Maloney Field got its last look at the
Cardinal seniors this weekend, and witnessed both
the heartbreak ol last-minute defeat and the elation of
a crucial win. all within 72 hours.
I lie Stanford men's soccer team (7-4-5, 2-3-2 Pa
cific ID ('on fere nee) hosted No. 4 Washington (11-3-
2. 4 0-1) and Oregon State (5-10-1. 0-6-0) in its last
homestand of the regular season.
Not onl\ were the matches important as a send-off
for the senior class, but both games had postseason
implications I he Cardinal need some late-season
wins to solidify their chances fora playoff berth.
I he first test of the weekend was conference-lead
ing Washington. The game was extremely hard
fought. with the teams combining for 27 fouls and 88
minutes of deadlocked play.
"Washington is a terrific team and I think we bat
tled them pretty evenly," said head coach Bret Simon.
"We played a very good second half, but I think there
were a series of chances that we didn't capitalize on
and that hurt us."
In the BWth minute. Husky Jeff Hoover made Stan
lord pay dearly for missed chances as he tallied a goal
on a volley in the box off a pass from teammate Will
Flanagan.
With almost no time left on the clock, the Cardinal
could not even the score and suffered a last-minute 1-
0 defeat.
"If you let a team like Washington stay around
long enough, they will score a goal on you more often
than not," Simon said.
After playing the Huskies so tightly throughout
the season, the Cardinal gave credit to their opponent.

"They'll most likely win the conference, and hope
fully we'll get to see them again, though you don't
know," senior forward Matt Janusz said.
However, the Cardinal seniors were not willing to
let their years on the Farm end with such heartbreak,
as they squared off against Oregon State.
"It was a big game especially since we're trying to
put a playoff run together," Janusz said. "Also, there
were the distractions associated with Senior Day. like
a banquet last night for the whole team with our fam
ilies."
Stanford threatened the Beaver net throughout
the whole match and had a near-goal in the 22nd
minute as Janusz threaded a pass through the defense
to junior midfielder Cooper McKee. who pushed the
ball just wide of the net.
The Cardinal dodged a bullet of their own as a
Beaver forward was able to chip a shot from inside the
box over sprawling senior captain goalkeeper Robby
Fulton. Backing up the play was freshman defender
Scott Bolkan. who blocked the ball inches from the
goal line and knocked it to safety.
For the rest of the match, play was fittingly dictat
ed by Stanford seniors in their last home regular sea
son game.
"The seniors (Janusz, Fulton. Aaron Maines.Todd
Leber, Jason Griffiths and James Twellman) all had
good games, and that I think was the difference,"
Simon said. "They made the important plays in spots
where we needed them."
Fulton not only played well defensively, but also
factored into the offense. In the 28th minute. Fulton
crushed a goal kick up the field that bounced through
the Beaver defense to Janusz. who was able to capi
talize on the opportunity.
"[On the goal] Robby completely launched the

ball, and as I'm running through, I saw their goalie
coming out of the corner of my eye so I flicked the ball
up and over him into the net," Janusz said. "I got a
lucky bounce, but they say it's better to be lucky than
gtfod," he said. "It's nice that we finally got him a
point."
Fulton played a part in the second goal as he quick
ly threw the ball upfield. noticing an overstretched
Oregon State defense which led to a three-on-two
breakaway for Stanford. Freshman Dan Shapiro re
ceived the ball on the left side of the box and shot a
rocket into a Beaver defender, who struck the ball
with his hand, awarding Stanford a penalty kick.
Janusz calmly placed the ball to the right side, com
pletely fooling the keeper, who dove left.
"Robby is defensively amazing and really strong in
the air," Janusz said. "Oregon State is also really good
in the air, so it's important to have him back there
jumping around. His distribution is something he has
improved on every year."
The win was essential to Stanford's NCAA Tour
nament hopes, and now it is time for the team to look
at its tough remaining schedule and continue getting
victories.
"I suspect we must win one of the next two, though
understand, this is just a guess," Simon said. "If we
don't win either, we leave ourselves in jeopardy and
things will have to happen to help us in. It will be
tough to win both or even one game, as they are chal
lenging teams but it's a great opportunity to make a
strong case for the playoffs."
Stanford travels south next weekend to play UC-
Santa Barbara and then closes its season against Cali
fornia in Berkelev.
