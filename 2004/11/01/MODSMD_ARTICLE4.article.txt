By federal law, all college students are
eligible to vote as residents of their campus.
Voters registered as Stanford residents are
voting citizens of Santa Clara County.
According to the Sept. 3. 2(X)4 Califor
nia State Report of Registration, 79 per
cent of Santa Clara County residents were
registered to vote, 8 percent higher than the
state average.
If you're registered as a citizen of Santa
Clara County, your campus polling place
— where your name is on the roll — is as
signed by the county depending on the ad
dress you gave during registration. It's writ
ten on the back of your sample ballot,
which you should have received in early
October. (If you haven't and you should
have, see below.)
If you moved at the beginning of the
year and didn't re-register to reflect a
change of address, you may still vote at any
campus location using a provisional ballot
since you're still in the same county. So if
you're in Mirrielees this year, you don't
have to trek to Florence Moore where you
registered as a freshman.
Be prepared to fill out a form before
casting a provisional ballot to update all

your information and remember that your
name will only he on the roll at your origi
nal polling place assignment.
If you're a registered California voter,
you have the right to cast a provisional bal
lot at Stanford even if you aren't registered
in Santa Clara County. This is one of the 10
rights listed in California's Voter Bill of
Rights.
You also have the right to vote as long as
you're in line by 8 p.m., when all polling
places close. It's not like a club, where they
can tell you to go home because they closed
while you were waiting to get in.
If you make a mistake or change your
mind while voting, you have the right to ex
change your ballot fora new one. This
shouldn't be a problem for Stanford voters
because of the electronic voting system (see
directions below), but you can ask for help
if you need it to go back and change some
thing. Undecideds can remain as such all
the way into the booth, but after you final
ly cast your ballot, you can't get it back.
You have the right to ask questions
about election procedures and observe the
elections process. However, if you're a real
pain in the ass and prevent election officials
from doing their job. they have the right to
kick you out.

If you see anything fishy, you
have the right to report it to a local
elections official or to the Secretary
of State's Office. Finally, if you be
lieve you have been denied any of
these rights, call the Secretary of
State's confidential toll-free Voter
Protection Hotline: 1-800-345-
VOTE (8683).
What to expect at the polling place
According to county officials,
Stanford will vote using the elec
tronic touchscreen system. After
you check in at your polling place,
you'll get a voting card that you stick
into the voting machine like an
ATM card.
Make your choices by touching
the screen in the circle to the right of
the candidate you want in office or

the measure you want to pass.
There's also a circle for "write-in"
candidates that prompts a keyboard
screen. "Next" and "Back" options
are in the lower-right and left-hand
corners of the screen.
Make sure you touched the right
circles by reviewing your choices be
fore you cast your ballot. After you
finish, the machine spits out your
card, which you then turn in to the
polling place workers fora sticker
that says"I voted!" or something
similarly patriotic.
Make sure you arc registered
The Office of the Registrar of
Voters has received complaints
from people who registered to vote
in White Plaza with outside voter
registration groups and had their

Six polling sites on campus,
including FloMo and Wilbur

forms illegally withheld. If you
haven't received your sample ballot,
call the Office (408-299-VOTE
(8683)) right away to make sure you
are registered.
If you are not registered, and you
suspect your registration forms were
illegally discarded by a third party,
ask the registrar to fax you a "Compel
to Vote" form immediately. If you
don't have access to a fax machine,
you can give them The Daily's fax
number (650-725-1329) and pick it up
at the Daily office (Storke Publica
tions Building at the corner of Lomita
and Santa Theresa). You must submit
the completed form ASAP to the San
Jose Courthouse for judicial confir
mation (191 N. Ist St.).
For help with this process, call the
court at 408-882-2100 x 2412 (Brian)
or x 2435 (Katrina).
