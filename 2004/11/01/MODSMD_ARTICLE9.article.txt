1972 - On Nov. 1, The Daily ran a
story on presidential candidate sup
port among Stanford students. Below
is an excerpt:
"Election coverage, generally
characterized by campaign speeches
and promises, charges and counter
charges, and rallies and debates, in
cludes another important element
which the public watches closely; the
public opinion polls.
George Gallup does it, the na
tional campaigns do it, the Stanford
campaign groups have done it, and
today The Daily announces the re
sults of an independent poll it has
conducted over the past week.
Of the 200 students randomly se
lected to be polled, The Daily
reached 126, 111 of whom were reg
istered voters. Of those 111, 66.7
percent said they planned to vote for
Senator George McGovern, 22.5
percent favored President Nixon
and nine percent said they were un
decided. Both Senator Thomas F.
Eagleton (D.-Missouri) and Con
gressman John Schmitz (R.-Ca.), the
American Party's presidential can
didate, received one vote.
Fifty-five graduate students and
fifty-six undergraduates were in
cluded in the poll.
Democrats accounted for 54.1
percent of the registered voters, the
Republicans for 21.6 percent and in
dependents for 19.8 percent. One
student identified himself as a mem
ber of the Socialist Worker's Party
and 3.6 percent declined to say what
party they belonged to."

1995 - On Nov. 1, The Daily ran a
story on Stanford's gift ranking.
Below is an excerpt:
"In its recently-released annual
•Philanthropy 400' listing of private
giving to large organizations, the bi
weekly Chronicle of Philanthropy
has ranked Stanford 20th in total
amounts of donations received.
The Chronicle ranked 400 institu
tions, including such charitable
groups as the Salvation Army and
the American Red Cross, as well as
141 colleges and universities. Out of
the 400 organizations, Harvard
ranked 11th, while the University of
Pennsylvania took 16th, and Cor
nell, 19th.
it's an honor for Stanford to be
ranked so high among he nation's
leading organizations,' said David
Glen, director of principal gifts for
Stanford's Office of Development.
He added that the national insti
tutions listed in the Chronicle are
able to draw upon millions of donors
nationwide, while Stanford draws on
an alumni population of only
150.000-200,000.
Being ranked 20th on a list that
primarily includes national institu
tions with larger donor bases is a
'testament to the quality of Stanford
and its ability to raise money,' Glen
said. 'The fact that people want to
give to this university is a tribute.'
Thanks to efforts in several areas,
Stanford's donations have been
steadily rising from $29 million in
1968 to a record $226 million last
year.
