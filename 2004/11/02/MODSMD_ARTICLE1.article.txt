# Students hit Vegas to turn out the vote
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Staying up late, meeting new
people and taking risks are all stan
dard practice for college students in
Las Vegas. For 125 Stanford stu
dents, however, there was nothing
predictable about their trip to Sin
City last Friday, where they went
door-to-door in a last-minute push
to increase voter turnout in the
swing state.
Having arrived in Las Vegas late
Friday night, students began can
vassing residential areas of the city
early Saturday morning. The trip
was funded by the political advoca
cy group America Coming Togeth
er, or ACT. which supports progres
sive candidates, including Sen. John
Kerry.
ACT has helped register 100,000
new voters in Las Vegas alone in the
run-up to the election. Stanford vol
unteers on Saturday visited those
voters to remind them about the
election. After dividing the city into
blocks, ACT leaders sent trained

canvassers like sophomore Johanna
Sophie Santos Bassetti to visit spe
cific homes on each block.
Bassetti said she was "feeling a
little scared" before embarking on
her assignment, but after successful
ly reaching a potential voter, she
was more energized than anxious.
"It's stupid to he scared because
if you're really scared, then you
probably shouldn't be doing this,"
she said.
Many residents were not home
at the time of the visits; several oth
ers had already voted. Yet most res
idents Bassetti met were friendly,
she said, even though they had been
visited numerous times by previous
ACT outreach efforts or by other
political advocates.
"I love those people!" she said,
pointing to a modest grey stucco
house with bundles of sheetrock in
the front yard. "They spoke to me in
Spanish before I said anything.
They said. 'Yeah, yeah, we voted,
we voted!' I guess ACT people al


JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily
ready talked to them in Spanish."
said Bassetti, a native Spanish
speaker.
By dinnertime Saturday, most
ACT volunteers had completed
their first day's task — each
knocked on over 50 doors, encour
aging residents to vote for progres
sive candidates and telling them
where their respective polling places
were.
Some volunteers, however, were
less successful than Bassetti. Jessica
Carilli, a second-year graduate stu
dent, didn't have very myeh luck on
her first day.
"It was harder than I thought it
would be because so many people
were mean," she said. "No one I
talked to was like, 'Because you said
that, now I'm noinu to m> vote."'

The difficulty of reaching people
at home also posed a problem.
"Out of 80 people, I'd say less
than 20 were there," Carilli said.
However, in her opinion, the effort
was worth it."I think it's worth
while. At least people know we
care," she added.
The Stanford College Republi
cans opted out of a similar Nevada
campaign trip to focus on the close
State Assembly race between Re
publican Steve Poizner and Democ
rat Ira Ruskin instead.
"We think we can do a lot more
at home right now." said senior
C'app Culver, vice president of Stan
ford College Republicans. "I know a
lot of other College Republicans are
in Vegas, but we're just working re
ally hard on the Poizner campaign

right now," he added.
A recent Zogby poll gave Presi
dent George W. Bush a modest four
point lead in Nevada, a state he won
in 2000. Some pollsters have ques
tioned the accuracy of nationwide
polls like Zogby for discounting the
impact of newly registered and
young voters, since these polls tend
to focus on "likely voters" who have
a record of voting and are reachable
by landline telephone.
Voter turnout, especially among
those between the ages of 18 and 29,
many of whom only have cellular
phones, is expected to skyrocket this
year. Pollsters project a total
turnout topping 120 million, a size
able increase over the 105 million
Americans that voted in 20(H).
Democrats hope that getting

first-time voters to the booth will he
the deciding factor in this election.
Campaign volunteers aren't taking
any chances.
Senior Michael Ortiz, who is in
Las Vegas stumping for Kerry with
U.S. Senator Harry Reid, a Democ
rat from Nevada, said many con
stituents he visited had been con
tacted repeatedly about the elec
tion.
"There's nothing you can do
about it," Ortiz said of the overlap.
His campaign targeted registered
Democrats who signed up to vote
early but didn't show up to the
booth. "I think they're sick of get
ting fliers, but we've got to keep
stalking them until they vote," he
added.

Some volunteers, however, were
less successful than Bassetti. Jessica
Carilli, a second-year graduate stu
dent, didn't have very myeh luck on
her first day.
"It was harder than I thought it
would be because so many people
were mean," she said. "No one I
talked to was like, 'Because you said
that, now I'm noinu to m> vote."'

The difficulty of reaching people
at home also posed a problem.
"Out of 80 people, I'd say less
than 20 were there," Carilli said.
However, in her opinion, the effort
was worth it."I think it's worth
while. At least people know we
care," she added.
The Stanford College Republi
cans opted out of a similar Nevada
campaign trip to focus on the close
State Assembly race between Re
publican Steve Poizner and Democ
rat Ira Ruskin instead.
"We think we can do a lot more
at home right now." said senior
C'app Culver, vice president of Stan

lot of other College Republicans are

right now," he added.
A recent Zogby poll gave Presi
dent George W. Bush a modest four
point lead in Nevada, a state he won
in 2000. Some pollsters have ques
tioned the accuracy of nationwide
polls like Zogby for discounting the
impact of newly registered and
young voters, since these polls tend
to focus on "likely voters" who have
a record of voting and are reachable
by landline telephone.
Voter turnout, especially among
those between the ages of 18 and 29,
many of whom only have cellular
phones, is expected to skyrocket this
year. Pollsters project a total
turnout topping 120 million, a size
able increase over the 105 million
Americans that voted in 20(H).
Democrats hope that getting

first-time voters to the booth will he
the deciding factor in this election.
Campaign volunteers aren't taking
any chances.
Senior Michael Ortiz, who is in
Las Vegas stumping for Kerry with
U.S. Senator Harry Reid, a Democ
rat from Nevada, said many con
stituents he visited had been con
tacted repeatedly about the elec
tion.
"There's nothing you can do
about it," Ortiz said of the overlap.
His campaign targeted registered
Democrats who signed up to vote
early but didn't show up to the
booth. "I think they're sick of get
ting fliers, but we've got to keep
stalking them until they vote," he
added.

Students knock on doors
Staying up late, meeting new
people and taking risks are all stan
dard practice for college students in
Las Vegas. For 125 Stanford stu
dents, however, there was nothing
predictable about their trip to Sin
City last Friday, where they went
door-to-door in a last-minute push
to increase voter turnout in the
swing state.
Having arrived in Las Vegas late
Friday night, students began can
vassing residential areas of the city
early Saturday morning. The trip
was funded by the political advoca
cy group America Coming Togeth
er, or ACT. which supports progres
sive candidates, including Sen. John
Kerry.
ACT has helped register 100,000
new voters in Las Vegas alone in the
run-up to the election. Stanford vol
unteers on Saturday visited those
voters to remind them about the
election. After dividing the city into
blocks, ACT leaders sent trained

canvassers like sophomore Johanna
Sophie Santos Bassetti to visit spe
cific homes on each block.
Bassetti said she was "feeling a
little scared" before embarking on
her assignment, but after successful
ly reaching a potential voter, she
was more energized than anxious.
"It's stupid to he scared because
if you're really scared, then you
probably shouldn't be doing this,"
she said.
Many residents were not home
at the time of the visits; several oth
ers had already voted. Yet most res
idents Bassetti met were friendly,
she said, even though they had been
visited numerous times by previous
ACT outreach efforts or by other
political advocates.
"I love those people!" she said,
pointing to a modest grey stucco
house with bundles of sheetrock in
the front yard. "They spoke to me in
Spanish before I said anything.
They said. 'Yeah, yeah, we voted,
we voted!' I guess ACT people al

ready talked to them in Spanish."
said Bassetti, a native Spanish
speaker.
By dinnertime Saturday, most
ACT volunteers had completed
their first day's task — each
knocked on over 50 doors, encour
aging residents to vote for progres
sive candidates and telling them
where their respective polling places
were.
Some volunteers, however, were
less successful than Bassetti. Jessica
Carilli, a second-year graduate stu
dent, didn't have very myeh luck on
her first day.
"It was harder than I thought it
would be because so many people
