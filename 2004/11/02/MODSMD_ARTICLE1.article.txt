Staying up late, meeting new
people and taking risks are all stan
dard practice for college students in
Las Vegas. For 125 Stanford stu
dents, however, there was nothing
predictable about their trip to Sin
City last Friday, where they went
door-to-door in a last-minute push
to increase voter turnout in the

was more energized than anxious.
"It's stupid to he scared because
if you're really scared, then you
probably shouldn't be doing this,"
she said.
Many residents were not home
at the time of the visits; several oth
ers had already voted. Yet most res
idents Bassetti met were friendly,
she said, even though they had been
visited numerous times by previous
ACT outreach efforts or by other
political advocates.
"I love those people!" she said,
pointing to a modest grey stucco
house with bundles of sheetrock in
the front yard. "They spoke to me in
Spanish before I said anything.
They said. 'Yeah, yeah, we voted,
we voted!' I guess ACT people al
