19X4 - On Nov. 2, The Daily re
ported that the Honor Code was
being reviewed. Below is an excerpt:
"The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council intends to present leg
islation proposing changes in the
interpretations and applications of
the Honor Code next week.
The SCLC, a body that defines
misconduct and penalties resulting
from Honor Code violations, will
present the proposed changes to
University President Donald
Kennedy, the ASSII Senate, the
Faculty Senate and the Stanford
community.
The changes include redefining
the position of a proctor during an
exam and distinguishing between
'intellectual' and moral' viola
tions.
In addition, the proposed legis
lation 'would eliminate the privi
lege of a faculty member to act as a
moral judge as well as an academic
mentor in cases concerning acade
mic violations of the Honor Code
in his or her class,' according to
Sally Cole, judicial affairs officer.
For example, a professor is cur
rently allowed to devise his own
system of penalties, such as the
lowering of a grade or another sim
ilar academic penalty, if he suspects
a student has cheated.
Cole believes that it is more im
portant to stop the behavior of the
student than to penalize the stu
dent.
In her annual report for the
1983-83, Cole said: 'Some students
have already learned the lesson of a
lifetime before I even meet them.

and the self-inflicted misery they
have endured far exceeds anything
likely to be caused by institutional
sanctions.'"
1995 -On Nov. 2, The Daily ran a
story about a new Brazilian martial
arts performing group. Below is an
excerpt:
"From a distance, the crowd is
reminiscent of your typical junior
high school dance — people in a
circle chanting to a rhythmic beat,
encouraging the performer in the
middle. As you inch closer, you see
something different. You see a
roda — the crowd — prodding on
the players who are performing
capoeira, a Brazilian martial art
form which combines elements of
dance, music and a sense of com
munity among the players.
The Stanford Capoeiristas, a
new campus group, are trying to in
troduce this engaging art form to
the Stanford community.
The goal of the Stanford
Capoeiristas is "to get [experienced
Capoeiristas] playing constantly
and then start opening up to every
body," said junior Andrew Kring
stein, the founder of the group.
The objective of the group is to
gather other capoeiristas and train
together. Currently, there are five
to six diehard capoeiristas.
Although formal lessons won't
be offered by the group, there is a
mestre — capoeira teacher — in
Palo Alto who offers inexpensive
lessons.
