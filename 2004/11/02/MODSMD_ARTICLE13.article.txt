## Editorial The 						Daily's 2004 California voter guide 
### 
Welcome to The Daily
editorial board's 2004
California voter guide.
The editorial board,
which is entirely separate from The
Daily's news department, re
searched the 16 propositions on this
year's California ballot. The board's
views on seven of the 16 propositions
are articulated below.
NO on Proposition 63
Mental Health Services Expansion
Proposition 63 proposes to ex
pand funding for California's mental
health services and It) guarantee that
current state funding levels for such
services not be lowered. If passed,
the proposition would pay for its
provisions through an income-tax
surcharge of 1 percent on California
state residents with incomes above
$1 million. This proposition should
not be passed because it is the wrong
way to fix a serious state problem.
The initiative's proponents argue
that Prop. 63 would help California
by ensuring that thousands of un
treated mentally ill individuals re
ceive appropriate treatment, which
would also cut costs of other state
government services and make the
state safer.
We strongly agree that mental
health services are under funded in
California. More must be done to en
sure that these services are expanded.
And the benefits suggested by the ad
vocates of Prop. 63 would indeed be
realized if mental health services
funding were expanded.
But the proposition's mechanism
of raising such funds — a tax on those
with incomes above $1 million — is
an improper approach. This method
was likely decided upon by the bill's
authors in order to make it less objec
tionable to the average state resident.
After all, under the proposed ar
rangement, only a select number of
residents would be forced to bear all
of the costs to implement the bill.
However, what sort of tax burden
should the richest income earners re
ally have to bear? Caring for the
mentally ill is a responsibility that
should fall on all of society, not just
the richest .2% of income earners.
Furthermore, income in that tax
bracket is highly variable. With
booms and busts in the economy the
number of people earning over $1
million can change significantly. As a
result there will not be steady funding
for something that is really critical.
In short. Prop. 63 means well, but
it falls far short in terms of how it
specifically proposes to fund its ex
pansion of mental health services.
These state services desperately need
more money and must be expanded
to better meet the current demand,
but a seriously flawed initiative such
as this is not the practical or just way
to achieve that end.
YES on Proposition 64
Private Enforcement of Unfair
Competition Laws
Proposition 64 limits the private
enforcement of unfair business com
petition laws. This proposition
should be passed because it would re
duce the number of frivolous law
suits, enabling small businesses to
pursue growth without having to
worry about settling legal suits over
minor or non-existent offenses.
Currently, the law allows lawyers
to sue on behalf of the public for busi
ness practices that are in violation of
the law. In the past, small businesses
have been sued for things as trivial as
abbreviating APR instead of spelling
it out as "annual percentage
rate.'Travel agents have also been
sued for not including their license
number on their Web sites.

These cases are often frivolous,
but because many small business lack
the money and legal resources to
challenge the cases, they often are
forced to settle out of court.
Much of the time, the settlement
amounts go directly to the lawyer
who filed suit, not the consumers who
were supposedly wronged.
Prop. 64 would close this loophole
by preventing this specific form of
lawsuit.
Furthermore, any settlements
awarded would go to the state of Cal
ifornia and not the lawyers.
The initiative has been supported
by many big business interests, in
cluding financial, insurance, oil and
pharmaceutical companies. That is
why some people have decided toop-

pose Prop. 64 — be
cause they think that it
would favor big busi
ness at the expense of
consumer rights.
However, the word
ing of the proposition
prevents it from being
abused by big business
es.
It states that private
enforcement of unfair
business competition
laws would not be re
stricted if "the individu
al was actually injured
by, and suffered finan
cial/property loss be
cause of, an unfair busi
ness practice."
As a result, only
frivolous lawsuits
would be ruled out, and
the consumer would
still be protected in
cases when actual dam
age is inflicted.
YES on Proposition 66
Limitations on " Three-
Strikes" Law
The three-strikes
law, which was passed
in 1994 increased the
penalty for repeated
crimes even if they were
nonviolent. Proposi
tion 66 reforms that law,
making it more lenient
regarding non-violent
crimes such as petty
theft and bad check
writing. At the same
time, it increases the
consequences for speci
fied sex crimes against
children by imposing a
one-strike law on these
offenses.
The three-strikes
law is badly in need of
reform. It severely pun
ishes repeat offenders
after three offenses.
However, some of the
offenses the law cur
rently includes results in
extremely strict sen
tences for individuals
engaging in relatively
minor third-offense
crimes.

Piop. b6 would save the state of
C alifornia hundreds of millions of dol
lars by not pursuing these petty crimi
nals as vigorously as they were prose
cuted under the three-strikes law.
Murderers, rapists and child molesters
would still remain in jail where they
belong, but those who do not commit
such heinous crimes would receive a
lighter and more equitable punish
ment.
Aside from saving taxpayers'
money, this is also in keeping with
the notion of letting the punishment
fit the crime. Petty third-offense
criminals may still have repeatedly
done wrong, but that does not mean

they should be locked up for pro
longed periods of time at the taxpay
ers' expense.
Those opposed to Prop. 66 argue
that it would make the legal system
overly lenient and put criminals back
on the streets. However, the law ac
tually stiffens the penalties for child
molesters, and it makes the law more
lenient only for those guilty of less se
rious crimes.
Because it would reduce the costs
of legal and correctional facilities as
well as make the law more fair. Prop.
66 should be passed.
N( ) on Proposition 68
Non- Tribal Commercial Gambling
Expansion

Proposition 68 would force Indian
tribes to pay 25 percent of slot-ma
chine- and gaming-device revenue to
the state government. If they fail to
comply, 16 specified non-tribal race
tracks and gambling establishments
would be authorized to operate 30,000
slot machines and gaming devices and
pay 33 percent of net revenues to fund
government public safety, regulatory
and social programs.
We oppose the proposition be
cause. as its opponents such as Cali
fornia ( jov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
put it.it is "riddled" with problems.
For one. the proposition is a back
door way for non-tribal gaming inter

ests to expand their operations. In
that sense. Prop. 68 is one step closer
to legalized gambling in California.
The spread of gambling through
many major urban neighborhoods
carries many potentially undesirable
social consequences.
Gambling has often been associ
ated with crime, and many of the new
slot machines would be near schools
and other sensitive areas.
In addition, increasing taxes on
Native American casinos or legaliz
ing gambling are important issues
that should be considered in indepen
dent propositions and not as a joint
package. There is no compelling rea
son for them to be tied together as
they are in this initiative except for
the fact that it suits the purposes of

the non-tribal gam
ing special interests
trying to pass this
proposition. These
special interests ex
pect that the tribes
will not pay the 25
percent, meaning
they will be able to
put in gambling ma
chines as the law stip
ulates.
Furthermore, al
though Prop. 68 in
creases taxes on
gaming, it unneces
sarily protects gam
ing interests from fu
ture tax hikes.
Proponents of
Prop. 68 argue that
Native Americans
have a gambling
monopoly in Califor
nia and that they
have not paid
enough in taxes in
the past. But Gov.
Schwarzenegger's
negotiated agree
ment with the tribes
has increased the
amount that Native
Americans pay to
the state, and it
seems unfair to de
mand that Native
Americans pay more
than other corpora
tions.
YES on
Pnip<*ibon69
DNA Samples
Proposition 69
would require the
collection of DNA
samples from all
felons and from
adults and juveniles
arrested for or
charged with other
specified crimes.
This information
would assist law en
forcement officers in
catching and prose
cuting criminals, and
it should be passed.
The proposition
would cost $20 mil
lion, but it would be

uuu, uui ii wwuiu i
funded through an increase in crimi
nal penalties, not in taxes. In the long
run, it could even save money, as
more criminals would be caught and
put in jail before committing subse
quent crimes.
Furthermore, it would bring Cali
fornia in line with other states that al
ready have more sophisticated DNA
databases. Virginia, for example, has
a population smaller than that of Los
Angeles, yet it solves over three times
as many crimes with DNA informa
tion than the entire state of California.
Some people are concerned that
Prop. 69 would infringe on individu
als' rights to privacy. In particular.

they are concerned that people ar
rested for petty crimes would have
DNA information taken from their
person and entered into a state
database.
However, arrestees can go
through a process to have their DNA
removedfrom the database, if they
believe it is merited.
Some people are also worried that
DNA would be used to wrongfully
put an innocent person in jail. How
ever, defense attorneys say that
DNA evidence is an effective
method of determining innocence.
To better protect California citi
zens, Prop. 69 should be passed.
NO on Proposition 70
Tribal Gaming Compacts,
Contributions to the State
Proposition 70 would give Native
American casinos a 99-year compact
granting exclusive tribal gaming
rights without limits on the number
of machine facilities or types of
games on Indian land.
The tribes would contribute a per
centage of their net gaming income,
based on the prevailing state corpo
rate tax rate, but the contributions
would end if any non-tribal casino
type gaming were permitted
Prop. 70 is understandable as a
counterpoint on the ballot to Prop.
68, which would drastically hike taxes
on tribal casinos, but the status quo
on this issue is just fine. Native Amer
ican tribes have alread negotiated ac
cords with Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger that set reasonable
tax rates for the casinos, and the
tribes already have a de facto
monopoly.
NO on Proposition 71
Stem Cell Research, Funding, Bonds
Proposition 71 establishes a "Cal
ifornia Institute for Regenerative
Medicine" to support and regulate $3
billion of stem-cell research in Cali
fornia over the course of 30 years. If
passed, the initiative would be fund
ed by state bonds rather than by
taxes, and it would require an addi
tional $3 billion dollars in interest re
payment.
The research would encompass
adult as well as embryonic stem cells
and would benefit California re
search facilities such as Stanford and
the University of California. Stem
cell research is a relatively new area
in science that is investigating the
possibility of replacing cells de
stroyed by such diseases as Parkin
son's and Alzheimer's.
Proponents of the measure argue
that, in the wake of President George
W. Bush's curtailment on stem-cell
research, California should take mea
sures to become the vanguard of cut
ting-edge research in promising med
ical fields. They argue that in addition
to providing medical benefits and
economic profits to the state. Prop. 71
would ensure that research institu
tions conduct their studies ethically.
We believe that although stem-cell
research undoubtedly deserves more
money than the $180 million supplied
by the federal government in the year
2002, it is not the state's responsibility
to provide for this funding. With Cali
fornia's current budget deficit, it
would be unwise to set aside such a
large sum of money over such a long
period of time for research that scien
tists acknowledge is in its infancy.
We also believe the state should
not prioritize stem cell research over
research on equally harmful diseases
such as breast cancer or HIV.
There is no guarantee that in
creased stem cell research in Califor
nia would benefit the state economi
cally or socially. Until future
prospects in the field become clearer,
