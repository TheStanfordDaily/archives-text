# Sketch: Tales of Graduate Student Life
## Let's talk about politics, baby; let's talk about you and me 
### 
Voting is like sex. . . but
with fewer naked people
and less fun. Apparently
there's an election today.
I know this because while surfing for
porn last week I stumbled across a
delightful web site by the name of
http://www.votergasm.com.
The thinly veiled smut (they use
cartoons and photo diaries) is moti
vated by a desire to get out the vote
through asking people to pledge that
they will withhold sex from non-vot
ers and pay out to those who em
brace democracy.
After trawling through the site, I
can't help but wonder: Who are
these people? Where in the world
does one find people whose lives are
so full of nookie that even Kerry
versus Bush is only an opportunity
to get another shag? And why don't
I know them?
I'm not sure the concept will
work, but I like the sentiment. Any
body who will try this hard to get laid
definitely shares a worldview with
me. which brings a whole new mean
ing to "America, f*** yeah."
I am a little upset that I can't take
the pledge myself, but maybe I can
set something up for the 2005 U.K.
election...
Actually, despite my opening
words, I do see some strong similari
ties between sex and voting — espe
cially when you're in grad school.
Fora start, the frequency is about
the same.
In fact, my sample poll of physi
cists suggests that while voting every
four years is reasonable, getting laid
at that rate may be a little optimistic.
In addition, there's that vague
sense that you're not really making a
difference in bed or at the polls, so
why bother?
Plus, both voting and dating get
more complicated as you get older.

The dating rules are harder to master,
and there are ever-increasing numbers
of exes to be sympathetic about.
Likewise, one has to master the
intricacies of the democratic process.

Although at least
democracy
comes with a
handbook, the
California voter's
guide is not really
a page-turner.
As well
as reminding us
all that we don't
get laid enough,
the election does

have a wider impact. I speak, of
course, of procrastination.
Part of the art of being a grad stu
dent is knowing how to waste time
while minimizing guilt. Nobody real
ly wants to work, especially not if
you can do something else that
seems meaningful.
Normally worthwhile activities
don't include surfing the net. How
ever. "the most important election
of your life" means that you can
spend hours each day reading up on
the candidates' hairstyles and their
positions on each other's positions
(you just can't get the sexual im
agery out of politics) without any
semblance of remorse.
I n fact, if your advisor catches you
flicking between CNN and
http://www.wonkette.com, you can
reasonably assert that your contribu
tion to democracy is more valuable
than that multiloop diagram you
were supposed to calculate (that was
a physics joke — sorry, I'm a geek).
Speaking of geeks reminds me
that the election season has at least
one more serious positive for grad
students. I've mentioned previously
that we tend to obsess a little about
work. In fact we seem largely inca

pable of discussing anything else.
I had thought that this was only a
problem in the science and engineer
ing quad, but it turns out that hu
manities students aren't the urbane
and sophisticated types that I
thought they were.
Literature students peppering
their conversations with a large
number of words I've never heard of
is not necessarily a bad thing (I've al
ways been a fan of girls with a com
plex sentence structure).
The problem is that total immer
sion in one subject doesn't lend itself
very well to inter-subject interaction.
And there are only four-and-a-half
girls in the Physics Department.
Which brings me back to the
election. Politics is a universal topic
of conversation. Everyone has an
opinion.
No one has any idea what
they're talking about. It's the per
fect medium for communication,
and it's a field fueled by incompe
tence, which is really what's missing
in our lives, being the experts that
we are in the obscure corners of our
given fields.
Personally, I'm hoping that
tonight's events will involve a deli
cate balance with the advantage
switching back and forth between
the different parties, and every
thing finishing with a dramatic cli
max. So all that remains is for me to
exhort those of you who can to get
out today and exercise your demo
cratic rights. . . by sleeping with
each other.

Nav would like to assure his readers
that while he's unable to vote in the US
elections he is still a firm believer in
democracy. E-mail him at
navins@stanford.edu if you'd like a
demonstration.

cists suggests that while voting every
four years is reasonable, getting laid
at that rate may be a little optimistic.
In addition, there's that vague
sense that you're not really making a
difference in bed or at the polls, so
why bother?
Plus, both voting and dating get
more complicated as you get older.

The dating rules are harder to master,
and there are ever-increasing numbers
of exes to be sympathetic about.
Likewise, one has to master the
intricacies of the democratic process.

Although at least
democracy
comes with a
handbook, the
California voter's
guide is not really
a page-turner.
As well
as reminding us
all that we don't
get laid enough,
the election does

have a wider impact. I speak, of
course, of procrastination.
Part of the art of being a grad stu
dent is knowing how to waste time
while minimizing guilt. Nobody real
ly wants to work, especially not if
you can do something else that
seems meaningful.
Normally worthwhile activities
don't include surfing the net. How
ever. "the most important election
of your life" means that you can
spend hours each day reading up on
the candidates' hairstyles and their
positions on each other's positions
(you just can't get the sexual im
agery out of politics) without any
semblance of remorse.
I n fact, if your advisor catches you
flicking between CNN and
http://www.wonkette.com, you can
reasonably assert that your contribu
tion to democracy is more valuable
than that multiloop diagram you
were supposed to calculate (that was
a physics joke — sorry, I'm a geek).
Speaking of geeks reminds me
that the election season has at least
one more serious positive for grad
students. I've mentioned previously
that we tend to obsess a little about
work. In fact we seem largely inca

pable of discussing anything else.
I had thought that this was only a
problem in the science and engineer
ing quad, but it turns out that hu
manities students aren't the urbane
and sophisticated types that I
thought they were.
Literature students peppering
their conversations with a large
number of words I've never heard of
is not necessarily a bad thing (I've al
ways been a fan of girls with a com
plex sentence structure).
The problem is that total immer
sion in one subject doesn't lend itself
very well to inter-subject interaction.
And there are only four-and-a-half
girls in the Physics Department.
Which brings me back to the
election. Politics is a universal topic
of conversation. Everyone has an
opinion.
No one has any idea what
they're talking about. It's the per
fect medium for communication,
and it's a field fueled by incompe
tence, which is really what's missing
in our lives, being the experts that
we are in the obscure corners of our
given fields.
Personally, I'm hoping that
tonight's events will involve a deli
cate balance with the advantage
switching back and forth between
the different parties, and every
thing finishing with a dramatic cli
max. So all that remains is for me to
exhort those of you who can to get
out today and exercise your demo
cratic rights. . . by sleeping with
each other.

Nav would like to assure his readers
that while he's unable to vote in the US
elections he is still a firm believer in
democracy. E-mail him at

Voting is like sex. . . but
with fewer naked people
and less fun. Apparently
there's an election today.
I know this because while surfing for
porn last week I stumbled across a
delightful web site by the name of
http://www.votergasm.com.
The thinly veiled smut (they use
cartoons and photo diaries) is moti
vated by a desire to get out the vote
through asking people to pledge that
they will withhold sex from non-vot
ers and pay out to those who em
brace democracy.
After trawling through the site, I
can't help but wonder: Who are
these people? Where in the world
does one find people whose lives are
so full of nookie that even Kerry
versus Bush is only an opportunity
to get another shag? And why don't
I know them?
I'm not sure the concept will
work, but I like the sentiment. Any
body who will try this hard to get laid
definitely shares a worldview with
me. which brings a whole new mean
ing to "America, f*** yeah."
I am a little upset that I can't take
the pledge myself, but maybe I can
set something up for the 2005 U.K.
election...
Actually, despite my opening
words, I do see some strong similari
ties between sex and voting — espe
cially when you're in grad school.
Fora start, the frequency is about
the same.
