Middle East coverage is biased
Kudos to Jennifer Graham for
taking on the very difficult subject
of anti-Semitism in The Daily
("Handling the Middle East con
flict," Nov. 1). Graham stated that
the editors of The Daily did not
have a clear letters policy hut would
print material they reasonably
found to be free of anti-Semitism.
She says that the editors had fol
lowed their "reasonable" policy in
the letters published in the past two
weeks.
I beg to differ. The last two
weeks have been replete with in
stances of stereotyping of Jews,
which is quite different than picking
a bone with Ariel Sharon's policies.
Mehdi Javanmard complains
about how people use the"A" word
(anti-Semitism) for critiques of Is
rael, thereby stifling dissent ("Anti-
Semite label too often misused."
Oct. 27).
However, he goes on to vent his
outlook that "if the views and voic
es of Jewish people who oppose the
policies of the Israeli government
were to become public, it would be
impossible to maintain the lie that
any criticism of the Israeli govern
ment is by definition anti-Semitic."
He goes on to call Jews "Mc-
Carthyite" and "intimidating." Ja
vanmard fails to appreciate the
irony in his own letter, in which he
fantasizes that a Jewish conspiracy
prevents Jews from speaking their
mind.
In fact, many of the Jewish facul
ty at Stanford criticize Israel regu
larly, some fanatically. The Israeli
Knesset — Israel's legislature — it
self contains many points of view,
including anti-Zionist ones. So who
is being stifled?
I had e-mailed Graham about
Mark Slee's letter ("Consider the
numbers in Israel-Palestine con
flict," Oct. 28), in the message I
comment that Slee's use of body
counts as an argument for increased
Palestinian suffering could only
have come from a distressed math
major. I consider the letter

grotesque and illogical, but not anti-
Semitic and 1 would not favor sup
pressing it.
A third letter, by Uzair Khan
("Epstein's speech represented two
truths to Middle East conflict" (Oct.
26), draws directly on anti-Semitic
stereotypes. He intimates that we
"are not as free as we are led to be
lieve," presumably because of Jew
ish domination of the media.
Henry Ford might have been
proud of that letter. Khan is appar
ently unaware that Israel has a free
press, and the Palestinian Authority
does not, and that many mass media
journalists have admitted to sup
pressing stories for fear of their own
safety within Palestinian territories.
Again, this irony escaped the
opinions editors.
A fourth letter, from the last vol
ume of The Daily by Joe Webb, was
blatantly anti-Semitic yet was pub
lished. Graham refused to comment
on the old letter, even though The
Daily has yet to apologize for it.
The above-mentioned letters
(except for Slee's) should not have
passed a "reasonable" editorial pol
icy. Since some of the editorial
board may apply for national jour
nalism jobs within the next 12
months, I am worried.
Perhaps the Stanford faculty
should add segments to sensitize
students as to what constitutes anti-
Semitism.

Terror in Middle East needs analysis
In "Handling the Middle East con
flict" (Nov. 1). Readership Editor Jen
nifer Graham rightly points out that on
the issue of Israel and Palestine what is
fact and what is opinion becomes sub
ject to debate, and that for The Daily
to bar letters stressing the suffering of
one side over the other could preclude
serious discussion.
It is unfortunate, therefore, that al
though The Daily has generously cov
ered the talks by Hedy Epstein and
Ruth Wisse, there has been little dis

cussion on the opinions pages of the
actual content of these talks.
Consequently I would like to re
spond to one of the many farfetched
statements made by Ruth Wisse on
Oct. 29.
"We are not responsible for the suf
fering of the Palestinians," she said.
"The Arab rulers are responsible for
the Palestinian conflict," she went on,
and implied that Jews who take re
sp« >nsibility are only trying to "be nice."
I have no wish to defend the auto
cratic and often corrupt rulers of Arab
nations, but they are not the ones who
drove hundreds of thousands of Pales
tinians from their homes and orchards
and businesses in 1948, leveled their
villages and refused to allow them to
return.
The forced exodus was carried
out by the regular Jewish army and
the Irgun. a militia that carried out
assassinations and bombings, ac
cording to Israeli scholar Benny
Morris in"The Birth of the Pales
tine Refugee Problem."
Israeli historian Ilan Pappe
writes in"The Making of the
Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1947-51,"
that local commanders attacked
villages whether or not they were
hostile and evacuated Arabs wher
ever there was fertile land. Ac
cording lo Pappe, Jewish opera
tions were guided by the desire to
occupy the greatest possible por
tion of Palestine.
After the 1967 war. Israel contin
ued the same policy in the captured
West Bank and Gaza by rapidly
building settlements on land seized
from the Palestinians. Israel's con
tinued occupation of this land, in de
fiance of IJ.N. Security Council res
olutions and international law. is at
the heart of the Israeli Palestinian
conflict.
It is not necessary to compare the
suffering this has caused on either
side to maintain that only when this
conflict is resolved and justice is
done will both peoples be able to
live in peace and security.

Terror in Middle East needs analysis
In "Handling the Middle East con
flict" (Nov. 1). Readership Editor Jen
nifer Graham rightly points out that on
the issue of Israel and Palestine what is
fact and what is opinion becomes sub
ject to debate, and that for The Daily
to bar letters stressing the suffering of
one side over the other could preclude
serious discussion.
It is unfortunate, therefore, that al
though The Daily has generously cov
ered the talks by Hedy Epstein and
Ruth Wisse, there has been little dis

cussion on the opinions pages of the
actual content of these talks.
Consequently I would like to re
spond to one of the many farfetched
statements made by Ruth Wisse on
Oct. 29.
"We are not responsible for the suf
fering of the Palestinians," she said.
"The Arab rulers are responsible for
the Palestinian conflict," she went on,
and implied that Jews who take re
sp« >nsibility are only trying to "be nice."
I have no wish to defend the auto
cratic and often corrupt rulers of Arab
nations, but they are not the ones who
drove hundreds of thousands of Pales
tinians from their homes and orchards
and businesses in 1948, leveled their
villages and refused to allow them to
return.
The forced exodus was carried
out by the regular Jewish army and
the Irgun. a militia that carried out
assassinations and bombings, ac
cording to Israeli scholar Benny
Morris in"The Birth of the Pales
tine Refugee Problem."
Israeli historian Ilan Pappe
writes in"The Making of the
Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1947-51,"
that local commanders attacked
villages whether or not they were
hostile and evacuated Arabs wher
ever there was fertile land. Ac
cording lo Pappe, Jewish opera
tions were guided by the desire to
occupy the greatest possible por
tion of Palestine.
After the 1967 war. Israel contin
ued the same policy in the captured
West Bank and Gaza by rapidly
building settlements on land seized
from the Palestinians. Israel's con
tinued occupation of this land, in de
fiance of IJ.N. Security Council res
olutions and international law. is at
the heart of the Israeli Palestinian
conflict.
It is not necessary to compare the
suffering this has caused on either
side to maintain that only when this
conflict is resolved and justice is
done will both peoples be able to
live in peace and security.

Middle East coverage is biased
Kudos to Jennifer Graham for
taking on the very difficult subject
of anti-Semitism in The Daily
("Handling the Middle East con
flict," Nov. 1). Graham stated that
the editors of The Daily did not
have a clear letters policy hut would
print material they reasonably
found to be free of anti-Semitism.
She says that the editors had fol
lowed their "reasonable" policy in
the letters published in the past two
weeks.
I beg to differ. The last two
weeks have been replete with in
stances of stereotyping of Jews,
which is quite different than picking
a bone with Ariel Sharon's policies.
Mehdi Javanmard complains
about how people use the"A" word
(anti-Semitism) for critiques of Is
rael, thereby stifling dissent ("Anti-
Semite label too often misused."
Oct. 27).
However, he goes on to vent his
outlook that "if the views and voic
es of Jewish people who oppose the
policies of the Israeli government
were to become public, it would be
impossible to maintain the lie that
any criticism of the Israeli govern
ment is by definition anti-Semitic."
He goes on to call Jews "Mc-
Carthyite" and "intimidating." Ja
vanmard fails to appreciate the
irony in his own letter, in which he
fantasizes that a Jewish conspiracy
prevents Jews from speaking their
mind.
In fact, many of the Jewish facul
ty at Stanford criticize Israel regu
larly, some fanatically. The Israeli
Knesset — Israel's legislature — it
self contains many points of view,
including anti-Zionist ones. So who
is being stifled?
I had e-mailed Graham about
Mark Slee's letter ("Consider the
numbers in Israel-Palestine con
flict," Oct. 28), in the message I
comment that Slee's use of body
counts as an argument for increased
Palestinian suffering could only
have come from a distressed math
major. I consider the letter

grotesque and illogical, but not anti-
Semitic and 1 would not favor sup
pressing it.
A third letter, by Uzair Khan
("Epstein's speech represented two
truths to Middle East conflict" (Oct.
26), draws directly on anti-Semitic
stereotypes. He intimates that we
"are not as free as we are led to be
lieve," presumably because of Jew
ish domination of the media.
Henry Ford might have been
proud of that letter. Khan is appar
ently unaware that Israel has a free
press, and the Palestinian Authority
does not, and that many mass media
journalists have admitted to sup
pressing stories for fear of their own
safety within Palestinian territories.
