# Absentee voting frustrates students
## 
### JENNY BONILLA THE CHRONICLE (DUKE U 
(U-WIRE) DURHAM, N.C.
Keith Greenberg was rejected. The
freshman's first voting experience,
in Florida's August primaries, was
disenfranchisement, and he's one of
the few who actually know why.
Greenberg is just one of many
students who have faced challenges
in the election process. Some stu
dents, especially those from swing
states like Ohio and Florida, have
opted to take advantage of absentee
ballots in hopes that their votes will
have a stronger impact in their home
states than in North Carolina. But
many are still wary that their votes
might not be counted accurately.
In the wake of the 2(MM) presiden
tial election,the ('alTech / MI T Vot
ing Technology Project found that
between 4 and 6 million votes were
lost due to a variety of problems in
cluding voter registration mix-ups,
faulty voting equipment, confusing
ballots and polling place problems.
Several students have reported
that, in their experience, these prob
lems seem far from cured.
Greenberg's absentee ballot for
the Aug. 31 primary was thrown out
because he did not include a photo
copy of proper identification with his
vote. Not only did he fail to receive
notification until late September,
but the state also did not include any
instructions directing first-time ab
sentee voters to include a copy of
proper identification.
The law requiring that "you must
make a copy" of such information
just went into effect this past Janu

ary.
As frustrated as Greenherg was
to discover his first vote did not
count, he is glad it happened early.
"If I hadn't voted in the municipal
primary in August, I would not have
known about the law and I would
have been disenfranchised for the
crucial presidential election," he
wrote to the Florida Secretary of
State following the incident. "My
peers in high school registered with
me, and 1 am afraid that, if they vote,
their votes will be invalid, too."
In the past week. Broward Coun
ty. Fla.. which includes Green berg's
hometown of Coral Springs, has val
idated his concerns. Election offi
cials in Broward just re-sent more
than half of the requested absentee
ballots to the 76.(HX) voters who, as of
last week, had not received their ini
tial requests.
The original ballots have appar
ently vanished without any evidence
of criminal intent, according to the
Florida Department of Law En
forcement's investigation.
The only two counties in Florida
that have re-sent additional absen
tee ballots are Broward and Palm
Beach counties, according to the
Florida state department's election
division.
Since both political parties en
couraged absentee voting this year,
however, there was an unprecedent
ed surge in absentee requests, and
any problems similar to Broward's
could be compounded.
"I believe it will be even more
emotional and divisive (than the
2(XX) election| because there are al
ready reports of fraud and unethical
electoral practices," said John Tran

sue, assistant professor of political
science and an expert on public opin
ion and polling, adding that Florida
and Ohio would likely determine the
outcome of the presidential election.
Sophomore Susanna Temkin, a
Miami Shores, Fla., resident, did not
receive election materials until
Thursday, when she got two ballots
in the mail.
Freshman Katie Uutcheson, a
Carroll. Ohio, native, originally
planned to vote with an absentee
ballot, but she changed her mind
while visiting home over fall break.
When she went to the poll to vote
early an election official told Uutch
eson all she had to do was write
'void' on her absentee ballot and
mail it back, but "it never came, and
my mom told me that the Board of
Elections called her and said it had
been [voided and) returned," Uutch
eson said.
Broward native junior Carla Her
mida still had not received her ballot
as of Friday, leaving her worried that
it would never arrive at Duke, or that
if it does, that she would not be able
to get it back to Florida on time to be
counted. Hermida's ballot was sent
to her home in Ft. Lauderdale, and
her mother mailed it to her more
than two weeks ago, yet it still has
not arrived. Both Temkin and Her
mida expressed concern that Duke's
postal operations may be partially to
blame for such inefficiencies.
"1 understand why so few college
students vote — the process is really
a pain," freshman Kathryn Minshew
said. "I'm planning on doing it any
way because I feel it's so important,
but there's got to be a better way for
the government to handle this."

while visiting home over fall break.
When she went to the poll to vote
early an election official told Uutch
eson all she had to do was write
'void' on her absentee ballot and
mail it back, but "it never came, and
my mom told me that the Board of
Elections called her and said it had
been [voided and) returned," Uutch
eson said.
Broward native junior Carla Her
mida still had not received her ballot
as of Friday, leaving her worried that
it would never arrive at Duke, or that
if it does, that she would not be able
to get it back to Florida on time to be
counted. Hermida's ballot was sent
to her home in Ft. Lauderdale, and
her mother mailed it to her more
than two weeks ago, yet it still has
not arrived. Both Temkin and Her
mida expressed concern that Duke's
postal operations may be partially to
blame for such inefficiencies.
"1 understand why so few college
students vote — the process is really
a pain," freshman Kathryn Minshew
said. "I'm planning on doing it any
way because I feel it's so important,
but there's got to be a better way for
the government to handle this."
(U-WIRE) DURHAM, N.C.
Keith Greenberg was rejected. The
freshman's first voting experience,
in Florida's August primaries, was
disenfranchisement, and he's one of
the few who actually know why.
Greenberg is just one of many
students who have faced challenges
in the election process. Some stu
dents, especially those from swing
states like Ohio and Florida, have
opted to take advantage of absentee
ballots in hopes that their votes will
have a stronger impact in their home
states than in North Carolina. But
many are still wary that their votes
might not be counted accurately.
In the wake of the 2(MM) presiden
tial election,the ('alTech / MI T Vot
ing Technology Project found that
between 4 and 6 million votes were
lost due to a variety of problems in
cluding voter registration mix-ups,
faulty voting equipment, confusing
ballots and polling place problems.
Several students have reported
that, in their experience, these prob
lems seem far from cured.
Greenberg's absentee ballot for
the Aug. 31 primary was thrown out
because he did not include a photo
copy of proper identification with his
vote. Not only did he fail to receive
notification until late September,
but the state also did not include any
instructions directing first-time ab
sentee voters to include a copy of
proper identification.
The law requiring that "you must
make a copy" of such information
just went into effect this past Janu

ary.
As frustrated as Greenherg was
to discover his first vote did not
count, he is glad it happened early.
"If I hadn't voted in the municipal
primary in August, I would not have
known about the law and I would
have been disenfranchised for the
crucial presidential election," he
wrote to the Florida Secretary of
State following the incident. "My
peers in high school registered with
me, and 1 am afraid that, if they vote,
their votes will be invalid, too."
In the past week. Broward Coun
ty. Fla.. which includes Green berg's
hometown of Coral Springs, has val
idated his concerns. Election offi
cials in Broward just re-sent more
than half of the requested absentee
ballots to the 76.(HX) voters who, as of
last week, had not received their ini
tial requests.
The original ballots have appar
ently vanished without any evidence
of criminal intent, according to the
Florida Department of Law En
forcement's investigation.
The only two counties in Florida
that have re-sent additional absen
tee ballots are Broward and Palm
Beach counties, according to the
Florida state department's election
division.
Since both political parties en
couraged absentee voting this year,
however, there was an unprecedent
ed surge in absentee requests, and
any problems similar to Broward's
could be compounded.
"I believe it will be even more
emotional and divisive (than the
2(XX) election| because there are al
ready reports of fraud and unethical
electoral practices," said John Tran

sue, assistant professor of political
science and an expert on public opin
ion and polling, adding that Florida
and Ohio would likely determine the
outcome of the presidential election.
Sophomore Susanna Temkin, a
Miami Shores, Fla., resident, did not
receive election materials until
Thursday, when she got two ballots
in the mail.
Freshman Katie Uutcheson, a
Carroll. Ohio, native, originally
planned to vote with an absentee
ballot, but she changed her mind
while visiting home over fall break.
When she went to the poll to vote
early an election official told Uutch

'void' on her absentee ballot and
