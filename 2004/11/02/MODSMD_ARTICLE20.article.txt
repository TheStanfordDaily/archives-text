# The 						little people: A day in the life of a Florida campaign scrub
## 
### ERICA FINK CORNELL DAILY SUN (CORNELL U 
(U-WIRE) ITHACA, N.Y.-
"I haven't seen the guy I live with in
probably two weeks," said Cornell
University student Marc Zawel "04,
former managing editor of the Daily
Sun and a campaign worker for
Kerry-Edwards 2(X)4.
"Organized chaos," was the way
Zawel described the Orlando, Fla.,
headquarters of the Kerry-Edwards
campaign, where he is stationed.
Zawel emphasized the importance
of his particular position in Tues
day's election.
"I'm in the 1-4 Corridor. To our
north, we have the Florida Panhan
dle, which typically goes Republi
can; to our south is Miami, which
usually goes Democratic. This area
will likely decide which way Florida
goes, and could, basically, decide
the next president."
Zawel comes to work every day
to try and secure that someone new
is running the country for the next
four years.
Every day, Zawel gets to the of
fice by 8:30 a.m. That is the only
constant in his day. About once a
week for the last few weeks, the
principals — Kerry, Edwards, Bush,
and Cheney — have been down in
Orlando.

When either Kerry or Edwards
visits the area, it is Zawel's job to
help orchestrate transportation for
every part of the trip, "from the
landing pad at the airport to a fund
raiser at TD Waterhouse, to wher
ever he needs to go after that."
Celebrities have appeared in the
campaign office as well: "I've met
with Sen. Max Cleland. Jesse Jack
son Jr. and even Kirsten Dunst —
I've got to admit, the last one was
my favorite."
Usually, Zawel has a staff meet
ing at around 9 a.m. to discuss the
day's goals. When Zawel first went
down to Florida six weeks ago, the
focus was on voter registration.
The morning meeting decided
where to send canvassers to distrib
ute literature. Once a neighborhood
had been chosen, it was Zawel's job
to assign each of the 1(X) or so vol
unteers to 60 to 70 doors to distrib
ute literature.
In describing the obstacles that
arose in this part of the operation,
Zawel listed "language barriers,"
and "empty homes," but not un
friendly faces because "the cam
paign is only knocking on Democra
tic doors. There's 40,000 more De
mocrats registered in this state than
there are Republicans. In Florida,
the issue is getting people to vote."
Now that voter registration is
over, the focus has shifted to early

voting. Since the 2000 election,
some states, including Florida, have
implemented an early-voting policy
to allow voters to cast their votes as
early as Oct. 18. Since Oct. 5, can
vassers have been knocking on
doors providing information about
where and how to vote.
Canvassing ends by about 7:30
p.m., and Zawel compiles the infor
mation gathered by the volunteers
until the second daily staff meeting
at 9 p.m. "At the nine o'clock meet
ing, we talk about numbers for the
day, and then I do miscellaneous
processing until about 12:30."
The workday does not end at
12:30 a.m., however; this is just
when planning for the next day be
gins.
"I usually don't leave the office
till about 2 a.m. because 1 have to
plan things out for tomorrow. The
days of the week don't really matter
... everyday just sort of turns in to
the next one."
So why do it?
"Well, yeah, I mean it takes a hit
on your lifestyle — some days I
don't eat my first meal until 4 in the
afternoon — but 1 really believe in
what I'm doing and I want to make
sure on Nov. 2 that I've given it my
all," Zawel explained.
As for Nov. 3, Zawel told The
Sun, "I plan to sleep."

Now that voter registration is
over, the focus has shifted to early

voting. Since the 2000 election,
some states, including Florida, have
implemented an early-voting policy
to allow voters to cast their votes as
early as Oct. 18. Since Oct. 5, can
vassers have been knocking on
doors providing information about
where and how to vote.
Canvassing ends by about 7:30
p.m., and Zawel compiles the infor
mation gathered by the volunteers
until the second daily staff meeting
at 9 p.m. "At the nine o'clock meet
ing, we talk about numbers for the
day, and then I do miscellaneous
processing until about 12:30."
The workday does not end at
12:30 a.m., however; this is just
when planning for the next day be
gins.
"I usually don't leave the office
till about 2 a.m. because 1 have to
plan things out for tomorrow. The
days of the week don't really matter
... everyday just sort of turns in to
the next one."
So why do it?
"Well, yeah, I mean it takes a hit
on your lifestyle — some days I
don't eat my first meal until 4 in the
afternoon — but 1 really believe in
what I'm doing and I want to make
sure on Nov. 2 that I've given it my
all," Zawel explained.
As for Nov. 3, Zawel told The
Sun, "I plan to sleep."
