## Sailors rise to challenge in SoCal,finish fourth 
### STEPHEN HORSEY 
Stanford sent two fresh faces and
one veteran to the Sloop Pacific Coast
Championship at UC-Irvine at New
port Beach this past weekend. Having
no prior experience either with this par
ticular race or triple-handed racing, se
niors Peter Deming and Andy Mesher
sailed to a fourth-place finish with fel
low senior Jeff Allen, who has raced in
this regatta before.
While some Southern California
schools practice triple-handed sailing
during the season, it remains one of the
smaller events in collegiate sailing.
Most races are limited to double-hand
ed, single-handed and team racing.
So, going into the six-team race,
Stanford knew its lack of experience in
triple-handed sailing put the team at a
disadvantage in the meet.
"We don't have the shield boats in
our boathouse, so we did as well as we
could've done and we worked well as a

team," Allen said.
Calm winds didn't help. The Cardi
nal struggled with considerably lighter
breezes than they are used to. Maxi
mum wind speeds clocked in at only
eight or nine knots during the last two
races.
The Cardinal were further ham
pered by the fact that many of the
southern California schools had an
opportunity to sail in the triple-hand
ed keel boats the day before, at the
qualifying regatta for the Sloop Pacif
ic Coast Championship.
"We knew it would be difficult to
adapt to the different style of triple
handed boats, and since our competi
tors practiced a day earlier, we knew
that we were at another disadvan
tage," said captain Deming, "but I was
hopeful."
Deming's good attitude and the ex
perience of Allen, who sailed in the
Sloop PCC during his freshman
and sophomore years at Stanford,
was not enough to overcome USC.
The Trojans won the regatta and
qualified for Nationals in a race
that unexpectedly took just one
day.
For the three seniors enjoying
their last year on the team who had
little experience in the event, the
regatta was primarily a chance to
have fun'.
"(The regatta was about] having
a good time for us three senior boys
and it was a bonding experience,"
Deming said.
Next weekend will highlight the
PCIYRA Women's I ;tll Champi
onship at UC-Berkeley, where the
Stanford women are expected to
be one of the top competitors.
The weekend will also feature co
ed boats in a non-collegiate team re
gatta at the New Port Beach Yacht
Club in Los Angeles, in preparation
for the spring Nationals.

While most collegiate sailing features double-handed racing, pictured
