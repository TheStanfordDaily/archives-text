## Sailors rise to challenge in SoCal,finish fourth

Stanford sent two fresh faces and
one veteran to the Sloop Pacific Coast
Championship at UC-Irvine at New
port Beach this past weekend. Having
no prior experience either with this par
ticular race or triple-handed racing, se
niors Peter Deming and Andy Mesher
sailed to a fourth-place finish with fel
low senior Jeff Allen, who has raced in
this regatta before.
While some Southern California
schools practice triple-handed sailing
during the season, it remains one of the
smaller events in collegiate sailing.
Most races are limited to double-hand
ed, single-handed and team racing.
So, going into the six-team race,
Stanford knew its lack of experience in
triple-handed sailing put the team at a
disadvantage in the meet.
"We don't have the shield boats in
our boathouse, so we did as well as we
could've done and we worked well as a

team," Allen said.
Calm winds didn't help. The Cardi
nal struggled with considerably lighter
breezes than they are used to. Maxi
mum wind speeds clocked in at only
eight or nine knots during the last two
races.
The Cardinal were further ham
pered by the fact that many of the
southern California schools had an
opportunity to sail in the triple-hand
ed keel boats the day before, at the
qualifying regatta for the Sloop Pacif
ic Coast Championship.
"We knew it would be difficult to
adapt to the different style of triple
handed boats, and since our competi
tors practiced a day earlier, we knew
that we were at another disadvan
tage," said captain Deming, "but I was
hopeful."
Deming's good attitude and the ex
