# Cal drops Card in five
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It used to be different. It wasn't always
this hard. Throughout the history of their
women's volleyball rivalry, Stanford has
dominated the California Golden Bears.
Owning a 53-4 record all-time against
the Bears, the Cardinal are used to walking
on UC-Berkeley as though the team were a
doormat.
But Stanford (15-6, 7-3 Pacific-10 Con
ference) dropped a five-game thriller to
California (12-7, 7-3 Pac-10). marking the
third straight time these two teams have
gone to the decisive fifth game.
Things did not look good for the Cardi
nal from the start, as Cal tallied the first four
points of the match on its way to scoring 10
of the first 12. Stanford mustered up more
focus after an early timeout but was unable
to put together a significant run and still
trailed by eight when it called its second
timeout at 19-11.
Senior Leahi Hall, who has been out with
injury for much of the season, entered the
game at 27-15. In the first time the libero has
seen action, Stanford's defense seemed to
finally show up. as the Cardinal made a few

nice digs and blocks to take six of the next
nine points. But it was too little, too late, as
the Golden Bears took the opening game
on a kill by junior outside hitter Jenna
Brown.
In game two, the Cardinal made a line
up change as Courtney Schultz put on the
libero jersey. Though Schultz had started
the first game as an outside hitter, the ju
nior was a natural choice, having spent her
first two years on the Farm as a defensive
specialist.
Stanford took its first lead of the match
at 2-1. The teams played evenly and traded
points through the first half of game two,
and the Bears led 15-12 heading into the
media timeout.
But Cal opened up its lead to five, forc
ing Dunning to take his first timeout at 19-
14. A Cardinal run closed the game to with
in one. But after Bears head coach Rich
Feller called a timeout, Cal scored five of
the next six to take a 26-21 lead and force
Stanford's final timeout.
Trading points brought the Bears to
game point at 29-25, which they quickly
converted on a setting error and miscom-
