# Offense falters in loss to Bruins
## Water polo squad falls to No. 1 Bruins, downs UC-Santa Barbara 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
While Stanford's 7-4 loss to top-ranked
UCLA was not a complete surprise, few
expected the Bruins water polo squad to
handle No. 2 Stanford's offensive weapons
so easily.
The Cardinal (16-3, 4-1 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) knew coming into
Saturday's game that the Bruins (18-2.5-0)
would he formidable opponents: the Car
dinal showed nervousness, anxiety and ex
citement about what they were going up
against.
Heading into the game, Stanford had
won six of the last seven meetings with
UCLA. The Cardinal and the Bruins had
split two very close games, one which in
cluded double overtime play, earlier this
year. Now the season series stands at 2-1,
in favor of the Bruins.
Only one member of the Cardinal
squad, senior driver Tony Azevedo, man
aged to get past UCLA's senior goalkeep
er Joseph Axelgrad and the Bruin defense.
Azevedo scored all four of Stanford's
goals, giving him 300 career goals.
Axelgrad, ranked second in the league
in goals-against average — behind Stan
ford's junior goalkeeper Chad Taylor —
tallied a career-high 14 saves to Taylor's
five stops.
In theory, the showdown between the
top two teams in the country should have
been closer, with two U.S Olympians
(Brett Ormsby and Azevedo) taking each
other on, but the Bruins win established
that UCLA deserves its spot atop the polls.
For the first time this season, Stanford
was unable to take a lead. The Cardinal tell
behind 1-0 in the first before Azevedo
knotted the game with a six-on-five advan
tage for Stanford. The tie didn't last long
though, as 12 seconds later the Bruins'
Michael March gave his team the lead
again, 2-1.
Things looked normal up until the third
quarter when UCLA scored four unan

swered goals to pull away, one of which
was Josh Hewko's breakaway goal coming
off a steal.
"We always know that teams will get
hot and go on runs," said senior two-meter
man Greg Crum. "The key to dealing with
those hot streaks is staying composed and
playing smart. Though UCLA was playing
well in that third quarter, it was our tem
porary loss of focus that forced us into such
a deep hole."

Added junior driver Peter Varellas:
"Basically we started rushing things on of
fense. Some hurried decisions along with
some flat-out missed shots caused us to get
beat going the other way. We did what we
needed to on frontcourt defense, but we
were getting beat on the counterattack."
As noon rolled around and the game
came to an end, seven different Bruins had
scored. One highlight for the Cardinal,
however, was keeping Ormsby from scor

ing, something that had never been done
before.
The game was held at the Rose Bowl
Aquatic Center prior to the UCLA / Stan
ford football game, and the crowd was in
large force. While it wasn't the largest
crowd to watch a Stanford match, there
were an estimated 1,000 fans in atten
dance. The Cardinal have mentioned how

Redshirt sophomore Nick Wagner and the second-ranked men's water polo team never gained the lead in their loss to No. 1 UCLA.

it is tougher to play on the road be
fore, but that wasn't cited as a reason
lor the loss.
"Personally, I enjoy playing in
fiont of hostile crowds," said Crum,
who sits among the top 10 scorers in
the MPSF. "I wouldn't say that the
crowds made it harder on us; 1 would
say that UCLA was energized some
what by their fans."
The match may not have had the
back-and-forth action fans expect
ed, but there was certainly enough
drama to accompany the big game.
Aside from penalties on both
sides, there were two game ejec
tions: Chris Pulido of UCLA left on
it brutality penalty and Stanford's
Ryan Fortune was called out for mis
conduct.
In an attempt to lead a comeback,
Azevedo got two penalty shots as
well. I lis shots from the four-meter
line made the score a more re
spectable 7-4.

The win extended UCLA's win
streak, and the Bruins' victory on
Sunday pushed it to 13 consecutive
wins.
The Cardinal went on to play
UC-Santa Barbara on Sunday and
did what they had hoped to do
against the Bruins: they dominated
the game.
"We came out and smoked
UCSB, so that showed that we are
capable of bouncing back from a
tough loss," said Crum, who was part
of the Cardinal's scoring barrage.
The Cardinal jumped out to a 7-0
lead, as the Stanford defense shut
out the Gauchos in the first period.
Azevedo led the Cardinal charge
again with three goals, two of which
came in the first. Varellas and Hop
kins scored two a piece in the game
as well.
UCSB's Chris Gronow, a utility
man, finally put his team on the
scoreboard with a lob shot into the

corner. The Gauchos proceeded to
score two more goals in the second,
bringing the score up to 7-3 by the
half.
Although UCSB attempted to
make a charge in the second half.
Stanford's dominating performance
in the first half proved to be too
much. After outscoring Stanford 2-1
in the third period, the Gauchos
failed to get past the Cardinal de
fense again, and Stanford handled
IJCSB in a 10-5 win.
Two shutout quarters (the first
and fourth) secured a much-needed
win against a conference opponent
for the Cardinal. Four of Stanford's
next five games come against MPSF
rivals.
"Essentially we still control our
own destiny." Varellas said. "If we
can win seven straight games begin
ning now, we are in."
