# Offense falters in loss to Bruins
## Water polo squad falls to No. 1 Bruins, downs UC-Santa Barbara 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
While Stanford's 7-4 loss to top-ranked
UCLA was not a complete surprise, few
expected the Bruins water polo squad to
handle No. 2 Stanford's offensive weapons
so easily.
The Cardinal (16-3, 4-1 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) knew coming into
Saturday's game that the Bruins (18-2.5-0)
would he formidable opponents: the Car
dinal showed nervousness, anxiety and ex
citement about what they were going up
against.
Heading into the game, Stanford had
won six of the last seven meetings with
UCLA. The Cardinal and the Bruins had
split two very close games, one which in
cluded double overtime play, earlier this
year. Now the season series stands at 2-1,
in favor of the Bruins.
Only one member of the Cardinal
squad, senior driver Tony Azevedo, man
aged to get past UCLA's senior goalkeep
er Joseph Axelgrad and the Bruin defense.
Azevedo scored all four of Stanford's
goals, giving him 300 career goals.
Axelgrad, ranked second in the league
in goals-against average — behind Stan
ford's junior goalkeeper Chad Taylor —
tallied a career-high 14 saves to Taylor's
five stops.
In theory, the showdown between the
top two teams in the country should have
been closer, with two U.S Olympians
(Brett Ormsby and Azevedo) taking each
other on, but the Bruins win established
that UCLA deserves its spot atop the polls.
For the first time this season, Stanford
was unable to take a lead. The Cardinal tell
behind 1-0 in the first before Azevedo
knotted the game with a six-on-five advan
tage for Stanford. The tie didn't last long
though, as 12 seconds later the Bruins'
Michael March gave his team the lead
again, 2-1.
Things looked normal up until the third
quarter when UCLA scored four unan

swered goals to pull away, one of which
was Josh Hewko's breakaway goal coming
off a steal.
"We always know that teams will get
hot and go on runs," said senior two-meter
man Greg Crum. "The key to dealing with
those hot streaks is staying composed and
playing smart. Though UCLA was playing
well in that third quarter, it was our tem
porary loss of focus that forced us into such
a deep hole."

Added junior driver Peter Varellas:
"Basically we started rushing things on of
fense. Some hurried decisions along with
some flat-out missed shots caused us to get
beat going the other way. We did what we
needed to on frontcourt defense, but we
were getting beat on the counterattack."
As noon rolled around and the game
came to an end, seven different Bruins had
scored. One highlight for the Cardinal,
however, was keeping Ormsby from scor

ing, something that had never been done
before.
The game was held at the Rose Bowl
Aquatic Center prior to the UCLA / Stan
ford football game, and the crowd was in
large force. While it wasn't the largest
crowd to watch a Stanford match, there
were an estimated 1,000 fans in atten
dance. The Cardinal have mentioned how

Redshirt sophomore Nick Wagner and the second-ranked men's water polo team never gained the lead in their loss to No. 1 UCLA.
The Cardinal did, however, grab a 7-0 lead early on against UC-Santa Barbara on tfie way to a 10-5 victory.
