### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a weekend of ups and downs, featuring
strong individual performances hut a team loss,
women's swimming coach Richard Quick wast
ed no time in putting the meet in the past.
"We were disappointed we didn't come away
with a win," he said. "But that's not our goal. It's
important to race to win in every meet, hut that's
not the goal of the season. We want to huild to
ward the Pac-10 and NCAA Championships.
This was a good step toward that."
The two-day meet in Austin, Tex. featured
three head-to-head matchups. The No. 4 Stan
ford women's swimming and diving team fell to
No. 6Texas, 197-156. No. 13 Southern California
also participated in the meet and lost to Texas
230-123, hut the competition between Stanford
and USC was not scored.
Texas took a 95-72 lead on Friday and Stan
ford was unahle to close the gap on Saturday.
The Cardinal struggled partly due to the absence
of three veteran leaders: junior Kristin Caverly,
junior Dana Kirk and senior Amy Wagner.
Caverly only competed on Friday before she was
sidelined with a hack injury. Kirk was also trou
bled by back pain, and Wagner was too ill to
swim.
"Dana and Kristin both have backs that we

will need to manage through the season," Quick
said. "It can be done since they both made the
Olympics managing their backs, but we must be
careful."
The Cardinal were led in Texas — as they
were in Hawaii — by the stellar performances of
freshman Caroline Bruce. Against Texas and
USC, she claimed two individual victories Friday
and two more Saturday. Bruce took first in the
100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke as well as the
200-yard and 400-yard individual medley. Her
time in the 200 breast beat the NCAA "A" qual
ifying standard, and her other three times were
good enough for "B" standards.
After only two collegiate meets, Bruce has
seven individual wins to go along with a relay win
and several top-five finishes in other races. She
has proven capable of filling the hole left by the
graduation of Olympic medalist Tara Kirk.
Bruce's dominance was backed up by several
solid performances from her teammates in both
long and short distances.
Sophomore Desiree Stahley, who won the
first race of her career last week, also overcame
some very strong competition to take the 500-
yard freestyle, with teammates sophomore Mor
gan Hentzen and freshman Elizabeth Durot tak
ing the next two spots.
