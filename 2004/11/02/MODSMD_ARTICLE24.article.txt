# Longhorns top Stanford women despite stellar diving
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a weekend of ups and downs, featuring
strong individual performances hut a team loss,
women's swimming coach Richard Quick wast
ed no time in putting the meet in the past.
"We were disappointed we didn't come away
with a win," he said. "But that's not our goal. It's
important to race to win in every meet, hut that's
not the goal of the season. We want to huild to
ward the Pac-10 and NCAA Championships.
This was a good step toward that."
The two-day meet in Austin, Tex. featured
three head-to-head matchups. The No. 4 Stan
ford women's swimming and diving team fell to
No. 6Texas, 197-156. No. 13 Southern California
also participated in the meet and lost to Texas
230-123, hut the competition between Stanford
and USC was not scored.
Texas took a 95-72 lead on Friday and Stan
ford was unahle to close the gap on Saturday.
The Cardinal struggled partly due to the absence
of three veteran leaders: junior Kristin Caverly,
junior Dana Kirk and senior Amy Wagner.
Caverly only competed on Friday before she was
sidelined with a hack injury. Kirk was also trou
bled by back pain, and Wagner was too ill to
swim.
"Dana and Kristin both have backs that we

will need to manage through the season," Quick
said. "It can be done since they both made the
Olympics managing their backs, but we must be
careful."
The Cardinal were led in Texas — as they
were in Hawaii — by the stellar performances of
freshman Caroline Bruce. Against Texas and
USC, she claimed two individual victories Friday
and two more Saturday. Bruce took first in the
100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke as well as the
200-yard and 400-yard individual medley. Her
time in the 200 breast beat the NCAA "A" qual
ifying standard, and her other three times were
good enough for "B" standards.
After only two collegiate meets, Bruce has
seven individual wins to go along with a relay win
and several top-five finishes in other races. She
has proven capable of filling the hole left by the
graduation of Olympic medalist Tara Kirk.
Bruce's dominance was backed up by several
solid performances from her teammates in both
long and short distances.
Sophomore Desiree Stahley, who won the
first race of her career last week, also overcame
some very strong competition to take the 500-
yard freestyle, with teammates sophomore Mor
gan Hentzen and freshman Elizabeth Durot tak
ing the next two spots.

Junior Kristin Caverly was one of several Stanford swimmers plagued by ill
ness and injury in this weekend's loss to Texas.
"Stahley did a good job to win the
(X) free," said Quick, "Especially
with two Olympians in the field."
Sophomore Lauren Costella,
who was fighting an illness, hardly
cemed affected when she won the
mile race, with Stahley and Hentzen
i ight behind. All three of their times
were enough for the "B" standard.
Freshman Brooke Bishop also
posted a "B ' qualifying time with
Iter victory in the 50-yard freestyle.
Texas was led by Sarah
Wanazek, who took first in both
(lie 100-yard backstroke and 100-
vard freestyle. Hayley McGregory
:idded another victory Friday in the
-"00-yard backstroke.
Wanazek and McGregory were
ilso members of relay teams which
took first in both the 200-yard
freestyle and 400-yard medley.
On Saturday, McGregory was
the only individual winner for the
I onghorns. with a victory in the 100-
vard backstroke. The team also
idded one more relay victory in the
'00-yard medley.
The Cardinal won more races

than the Longhorns. but Texas'
depth gave the team enough points
to win the meet.
USC had only two individual
winners in the meet. Khi Jeffrey
took first in the 200-yard freestyle,
and Emily Goesch won the 200-yard
butterfly.
The Trojans, anchored by
Goesch and Rhi, also captured the
400-yard freestyle medley.
While the swimmers had some
trouble posting points, the divers
performed admirably. On Friday,
sophomore Cassidy Krug took first
in the three-meter springboard com
petition, followed closely by senior
Ashlee Rosenthal.
On Saturday, Krug and Rosen
thal again came up big. leading a
Stanford sweep of the top four fin
ishes in the one-meter springboard.
Rosenthal took first, followed by
Krug, Erin Lashnits and Katie
Lampe. Rosenthal's score was more
than fifty points higher than the best
non-Cardinal finisher.
Diving coach Rick Schavone was
pleased with his team's progress at

this point in the season. While he
was especially impressed by the per
formances of Krug and Rosenthal,
he has high hopes for his up-and
coming divers.
"I 'm really happy with the top two
right now," Schavone said. "They are
diving extremely well for this time of
year. Senior Erin Lashnits is improv
ing hand-over-foot. Freshman Katie
Lampe went out there and proved
that she's competitive."
The swimmers will have two
weeks off, while the divers will have
one more chance to improve upon
their already successful season when
they head to Los Angeles next
weekend for the Trojan Invite at
USC. It will be their final competi
tion before the middle of January.
Schavone acknowledged the diffi
culty in competing so frequently
early in the season, and looks forward
to being able to return to training.
"It's been hard to do meets three
weekends in a row." he said. "So
we're going to try to ignore the meet
and just train right through."
