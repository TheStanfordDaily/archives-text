## Vote electoral reform at its football finest: the PCS 
### 
Today is Tuesday, Nov. 2. If you are over
the age of 18, a citizen of the United
States and registered, you should put
down this article right now and go straight to
your polling place and cast your ballot. For
those of you registered back home, bike as fast
as you can to the post office and send in your
absentee ballot.
Over the past months we have all been
swamped with election-related news and pro
paganda. We are told — and

rightfully so — that this is
the most important presi
dential race in our young
lifetimes.
And yet, despite the im
portance of our vote, there is
a chance that it will not be
counted. Paper ballots might
be poorly designed, and im
properly punched chads
might result in miscounted

votes. Electronic voting machines leave no
paper trail and are prone to undetectable
fraud. Absentee ballots are at the mercy of the
Postal Service, and with the huge volume of
early ballots sent in, there is a possibility that
they will be lost in the fray.
But don't fear, America. There is a solution
to this madness.
There is a solution that has been tested for
six years and has withstood a hailstorm of un
founded criticism. There is a system in place
currently that can sort through all the conflict
ing and confusing polls and account for miti
gating factors, and it is called the B.C.S.
Gone are the days when the whims of
vengeful coaches and jealous follies of desk
bound sportswriters would determine the na
tional champion of NCAA football. An ele
ment of rationality has pervaded the glorious
world of the best sport played from Septem
ber to December.
We will never see a repeat of The Great
Debacle of 1998, when Michigan and the
vaunted defense of Charles Heisman Wood
son lost the coaches' poll vote to Nebraska be
cause sentimental favorite Tom Osborne de
cided to announce his retirement just days
after the Rose Bowl.
Granted, the B.C.S. has undergone revi
sions almost every year since its inception.
The 2004 edition no longer takes into account
strength of schedule, team record or quality
wins.
But that is neither here nor there.
What matters most is that we have a gold
en opportunity to adapt this proven method of
choosing a winner among multiple eligible
candidates for the highest office in the land.
So without further ado, I present to you the
P.C.S., the Presidential Championship Series.
Here is how it breaks down. Two polls will
factor into the election — a popular vote by
all eligible citizens will balance an Electoral
College vote by the current system. These
polls will each account for one-third of the
final ranking. The final element will be a com
puter formula that incorporates success of
campaign, difficulty of opponents, and margin
of victory in primary elections.
A sample computer result would go as fol
lows: Bush wins major points for his well-run
(rhymes with Orwellian) campaign. Kerry
gets a bonus for bouncing back from a slew of
unfounded attack ads about his Vietnam
record. Bush scores toughness points for rally
ing after disappointing debate performances.

Kerry gets a boost from his primary
defeat of mid-major darling Howard
Dean.
From the muddling melee of
numbers, out pops a final score for
each candidate. This, when factored
into the two poll results, would give
an unambiguous victor.
And for those Oregon Duck fans
who are still upset about 2(K)1, when
Nebraska was chosen to play Miami
for the national title, all I can say is

that Nebraska has a history of im
proper voting irregularities (see
Great Debacle above) and that's one
of the realities of presidential poli
tics.
An honest assessment of the
P.C.S.? It's better than leaving our
election up to the fancies of Olympic
ice-dancing judges.
In other election-related news, I
hereby officially motion to impeach
ABC Sports for an egregious offense

in violation of all things good and
just in this world.
With three minutes to go in
Michigan's record-tying 17-point
fourth-quarter comeback against
Michigan State, when the Wolver
ines were still trailing by a measly
touchdown, the network that proud
ly markets itself as the home of "the
thrill of victory and the agony of de
feat" showed us neither.
Instead, they gave us USC's

mauling of Wazzou. a game that was
14-0 after 140 seconds. Meanwhile, 1
had to watch the Maize and Blue
complete a triple-overtime thriller
on Gametracker. This is absolutely
unacceptable. At least Michigan
won.
Go. Vote. Now.
