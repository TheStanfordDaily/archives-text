# Dems, Ruskin rally in White Plaza
## Democrat looks for last-minute votes in tight State Assembly race 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD 
The Stanford Democrats rallied
for Ira Ruskin in White Plaza yes
terday in a last minute push for
votes in the tightly contested race
for the 21st State Assembly dis
trict.
More than 40 Ruskin support
ers listened intently to the three
term city councilman from Red
wood City, who underscored the
importance of this year's presiden
tial election and touted himself as
being more in touch with local vot
ers on issues such as education,
health care and the environment.
"My ideas best reflect the val
ues of the district, including the
Stanford campus," he said.
Ruskin, who earned a master's
degree in communication in 1983
from Stanford, also thanked Stan
ford students for their help.
"The Stanford Democrats have
been extremely supportive
throughout the whole election
campaign," he said.
During the hour-long rally, stu
dents danced to the politically
charged tunes of The Flying Other
Brothers Band, which has toured
with John Kerry, while Ruskin
shook hands with bystanders.
Passing out free copies of their CD
titled "No More Years," The Fly

ing Other Brothers played songs
lampooning President George W.
Bush's his past drug and alcohol
use, as well as the "travesty" elec
tion in 2000. They urged onlookers
and supporters to "take back our
country" in this year's election.
Students were energized and
outspoken heading into today's
election.
"There's so much at stake in
this year's election." said sopho
more Megan Stacy. "It's impor
tant to show support for Kerry and
Ruskin." she added, "as well as
getting people out to vote."
Others agreed.
"It's good to be visible and re
mind people about what's going
on," said sophomore Leslie Finger,
who, along with many Ruskin sup
porters, was cautiously optimistic
about today's election.
Despite this confidence, some
acknowledged that Ruskin's oppo
nent. moderate Republican Steve
Poizner, had made a surprisingly
strong showing.
"The race is really close, and
should not be in such a liberal dis
trict," said sophomore Jen
Haskell.
Ruskin supporters also tried to
ignore a pro-Poizner counter-rally
100 feet from the stage. Senior Joe
Fairbanks, the former president of
the Stanford College Republicans,
led the contingent.
"Steve has pulled off an upset,"
he said. "This district was sup
posed to be safe [for Ruskin|."
A member of the Poizner cam
paign. who would identify himself
only as "Adam," said that the Re
publican was"a perfect fit for the

district" and had received endorse
ments from traditionally liberal
newspapers throughout the area.
Others at the counter-rally said

that Poizner appealed to a broad
spectrum of voters, including sev
eral Democrats who planned to
vote for Kerry.
