# Faculty come out in support of Prop. 71
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As Stanford voters go to the
polls today, they will face a contro
versial California proposition that
could bring the University tens or
even hundreds of millions of re
search dollars annually.
If passed. Proposition 71 —
which has the support of numerous
Stanford faculty members — would
fund $3 billion of stem-cell research
over the next 10 years.
Supporters say this research
could lead to cures for diabetes,
heart disease and Parkinson's. Crit
ics, on the other hand, charge that
Prop. 71 is an unaffordable gamble
for unknown returns.
"1 believe that the passage of
Prop. 71 will reshape the national
debate on stem-cell research," said
Dr. Philip Pizzo. dean of Stanford's
School of Medicine.
"I have been a strong advocate
for stem-cell research, because I
believe this will yield fundamental
knowledge that will enhance our
understanding of developmental
biology and eventually a number of
disease processes," Pizzo said.
He is not alone in supporting the
proposition. Biochemistry Emeri
tus Prof. Paul Berg and Dr. Irving
Weissman of the Medical School
arc members of the campaign's sci
entific advisory board. Dr. Judith

Shizuru, also of the Medical
School, is on Prop. 71's executive
committee.
"The Bush administration has
blocked a promising line of re
search because of its own ethical
ideology, not because this line of
research is dangerous or likely not
to work." Weissman said. "It is crit
ical for biomedical researchers like
me to point out what would be lost,
which I did for time and time again,
to no avail."
Weissman is also the director of
Stanford's Institute for Cancer/
Stem Cell Biology and Medicine,
which was founded in December
2002 with a $12 million private
grant.
While the University has not
taken an official stance on the bal
lot measure, the administration re
leased a statement last August not
ing, "Current federal policy has sig
nificantly limited the availability of
funding to enable this research to
reach its full potential. Stanford
University strongly supports stem
cell research and believes that it
merits public funding."
Weissman acknowledged that
researchers at the institute would
be applying for funding created by
Prop. 71 if it passes, and Pizzo was
even more effusive in his descrip
tion of the potentially invigorating
effects that the funding could have
at Stanford.

"Stanford investigators have al
ready made major contributions to
stem-cell research," Pizzo said. "If
Prop. 71 were to pass, Stanford,
along with other universities in Cal
ifornia, would become havens for
basic research in this important
area of bioscience. At Stanford that
would almost certainly lead to im
portant new recruitments of faculty
and students, new and exciting col

laborations among our various
schools, and I hope ultimately in
sights that will shape new ap
proaches to the treatment of seri
ous human disorders."
The proposition's opponents
have been skeptical about re
searchers' claims that economic
and medical benefits may be right

around the corner.
"It's a $3 billion debt bond,
which will ultimately cost taxpay
ers $6 billion, and this is something
that California just can't afford,"
said Tim Rosales, a spokesperson
for the statewide "No on 71" cam
paign.
"No research program has ever
yielded substantial revenue back
to the state. Many of the million
aires who are funding this cam
paign could easily fund this re
search privately without putting it
on the backs of California taxpay
ers."
Rosales also argued that the
proposition's method for distribut
ing funding was rife with potential
conflicts of interest.
"There's no oversight from the

governor or legislature," he said.
"The corporations or researchers
receiving money would be on the
hoard that decides where the
money goes."
Rosales concluded. "If people
want the state to support stem-cell
research, this really isn't the best
way for the state to do it."
But according to Berg, Prop.
71's large bill is ultimately worth
while and necessary, particularly to
support clinical trials and to bring
new researchers into the field.
"There's going to be close to
$290 million a year," Berg said.
"That's a lot of money, and that's
going to support a lot of important
research."

71's expense
As Stanford voters go to the
polls today, they will face a contro
versial California proposition that
could bring the University tens or
even hundreds of millions of re
search dollars annually.
If passed. Proposition 71 —
which has the support of numerous
Stanford faculty members — would
fund $3 billion of stem-cell research
over the next 10 years.
Supporters say this research
could lead to cures for diabetes,
heart disease and Parkinson's. Crit
ics, on the other hand, charge that
Prop. 71 is an unaffordable gamble
for unknown returns.
"1 believe that the passage of
Prop. 71 will reshape the national
debate on stem-cell research," said
Dr. Philip Pizzo. dean of Stanford's
School of Medicine.
"I have been a strong advocate
for stem-cell research, because I
believe this will yield fundamental
knowledge that will enhance our
understanding of developmental
biology and eventually a number of
disease processes," Pizzo said.
He is not alone in supporting the
proposition. Biochemistry Emeri
tus Prof. Paul Berg and Dr. Irving
Weissman of the Medical School
arc members of the campaign's sci
entific advisory board. Dr. Judith

Shizuru, also of the Medical
School, is on Prop. 71's executive
committee.
"The Bush administration has
blocked a promising line of re
search because of its own ethical
ideology, not because this line of
research is dangerous or likely not
to work." Weissman said. "It is crit
ical for biomedical researchers like
me to point out what would be lost,
which I did for time and time again,
to no avail."
Weissman is also the director of
Stanford's Institute for Cancer/
Stem Cell Biology and Medicine,
which was founded in December
2002 with a $12 million private
grant.
While the University has not
taken an official stance on the bal
lot measure, the administration re
leased a statement last August not
ing, "Current federal policy has sig
nificantly limited the availability of
funding to enable this research to
reach its full potential. Stanford
University strongly supports stem
cell research and believes that it
merits public funding."
Weissman acknowledged that
researchers at the institute would
be applying for funding created by
Prop. 71 if it passes, and Pizzo was
even more effusive in his descrip
tion of the potentially invigorating
effects that the funding could have
at Stanford.

"Stanford investigators have al
ready made major contributions to
stem-cell research," Pizzo said. "If
Prop. 71 were to pass, Stanford,
along with other universities in Cal
ifornia, would become havens for
basic research in this important
area of bioscience. At Stanford that
would almost certainly lead to im
portant new recruitments of faculty
and students, new and exciting col

laborations among our various
schools, and I hope ultimately in
sights that will shape new ap
proaches to the treatment of seri
ous human disorders."
The proposition's opponents
have been skeptical about re
searchers' claims that economic
and medical benefits may be right

around the corner.
"It's a $3 billion debt bond,
which will ultimately cost taxpay
ers $6 billion, and this is something
that California just can't afford,"
said Tim Rosales, a spokesperson
for the statewide "No on 71" cam
paign.
"No research program has ever
yielded substantial revenue back
to the state. Many of the million
aires who are funding this cam
paign could easily fund this re
search privately without putting it
on the backs of California taxpay
ers."
Rosales also argued that the
proposition's method for distribut
ing funding was rife with potential
conflicts of interest.
"There's no oversight from the

governor or legislature," he said.
"The corporations or researchers
receiving money would be on the
hoard that decides where the
money goes."
Rosales concluded. "If people
want the state to support stem-cell
research, this really isn't the best
way for the state to do it."
But according to Berg, Prop.
71's large bill is ultimately worth
while and necessary, particularly to
support clinical trials and to bring
new researchers into the field.
"There's going to be close to
$290 million a year," Berg said.
"That's a lot of money, and that's
going to support a lot of important
research."
