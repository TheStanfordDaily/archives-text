### ALIYYA HAQUE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Going into today's election. De
mocratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer
looks assured of a consecutive third
term in a landslide victory against
her Republican opponent, former
California Secretary of State Bill
Jones.
Although Jones has the support
of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a
poll released over the weekend by
the nonpartisan Field Research
Corporation in San Francisco
shows Boxer leading Jones by al
most 20 percent. 53 to 34 percent.
This margin is even greater
among women voters, with Boxer
leading Jones 60 percent to 28 per-

cent.
Some political analysts attribute
Jones' unpopularity among voters
to his far-right stances on many is
sues, which have the potential of
alienating many liberal-leaning
Californians.
Financial problems also plague
Jones' campaign. According to an
article in the San Francisco Chron
icle, Jones may enter today's elec
tion without ever having aired a
television advertisement. By com
parison. Boxer has spent more
money on television ads than Jones
has raised during his entire cam
paign.
Other analysts attribute Boxer's
popularity to her record in the U.S.
Senate and her left-leaning posi

tions on environmental issues and
abortion rights.
Freshman Sanah Parvez has
supported Boxer since high school.
"I'm a big fan of many of her
policies, especially concerning
women's rights," Parvez said.
"And I think it says something im
portant about California voters
that both of the state's senators are
women and Democrats."
Boxer, who has statewide en
dorsements from publications
ranging from the Los Angeles
Times to the San Jose Mercury
News, has spent the last few weeks
campaigning across California on
her "Road to Victory" tour.
Senior Ellie Martin worked with
Boxer in her San Francisco office

last summer and praised her deter
mination and resolve in fighting for
what she believes.
i decided to work for Boxer
when 1 was in Washington D.C. last
fall," Martin said. "I worked in the
Senate building and would see her
on the floor, and she's one of the
most passionate senators out there.
"Although her views can be
considered as on the far left side of
the spectrum, she's not some crazy
left-wing liberal. She has a vast
number of constituents both liberal
and conservative and tackles a lot
of problems facing California
today on issues such as immigra
tion and the environment," Martin
said.
