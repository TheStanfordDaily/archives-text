# Does this make me look fat?
## On the road with Gloria Steinem 
### 
I've often thought that I'm the
luckiest person in the world.
Freshman year, I attributed
all of Kant's ideas to
Hutchinson in my I-Hum final and
still rocked an A-minus.
Sophomore year, my draw number
was 118. Junior year. I danced on a
bar in Mainland China and didn't
get arrested.
This year, I am touring swing
states with Gloria Steinem. Less

than eight
hours after
I participat
ed in Full
Moon last
week (my
boyfriend
and I
agreed —
no tongue
and only
freshmen),
and less
than three
hours after

I sobered up from it. I flew out to
Pennsylvania to join Gloria
Steinem and five other inspira
tional women on an RV traveling
from bagel shops and bowling
alleys to concert halls and hotels,
talking to voters about issues key
to this election. I am not particular
ly knowledgeable or especially per
suasive, 1 just happen to be the
daughter of a woman who co
founded Voters for Choice with
Gloria about 25 years ago. Yay for
nepotism.
For those of you who are unfa
miliar with Steinem's name,
Google it. Gloria is to the modern
women's movement what Martin
Luther King Jr. was to the civil
rights movement. Hers is a name
you should know.
More important than her name
is her message. Listening to her
speak for the last five days, I feel
like I've met Buddha. Mae West,
Gandhi and Madonna (both the
virgin and the one who most defi
nitely isn't). Here are the high
lights:
In Philadelphia, a woman came
up to her and said, "It scares me
that my daughter doesn't know
who you are."
Gloria responded, "Yes, but
does she know who she is?"
Women aren't taught to know
themselves, only to anticipate and
respond to the needs of others.. Of
any member in a family, the moth
er is the most likely to be malnour
ished because she either ignores
her own needs or never realizes
that she has them. Service is noble,
but it shouldn't be to the exclusion
of the self. It's like the airplane
advisory. "Put your own mask on
before assisting others." We must
understand ourselves and take care
of ourselves before we can be of
true service to anyone else.
"Voting isn't all that you can do,
it is the least that you can do,"
Steinem told listeners in Chicago.
For the last four years, I've been
looking forward to Nov. 2 as the end
— the end to assaults on civil rights,
the end to slackening guidelines for
the Environmental Protection
Agency, the end to bastardizing
Christianity for political gain, the
end to homophobia as a national
value — and the list goes on.
But it is not the end. Whether or
not your candidate wins, you have
a responsibility — to yourself and
to democracy as a whole —to
make your representatives repre
sent you.
If Bush wins, we are morally
obligated to oppose his dissemina
tion of hate, violence and fear
(okay, so I'm a little bit partisan). If
Kerry wins, we can't let the conser
vatives be the only voice out there.
In Milwaukee. Steinem ended
her speech by asking each person
in the audience to commit "one
outrageous act of everyday rebel
lion." Mine was to put my real
weight on my driver's license, but
you should feel free to be slightly
more outrageous.

What will be your act of outrageous
rebellion? E-mail me at
