# So who are you wearing tonight?
## Political fashion invades Stanford 
### PAM SUD 
If you went to Delta Sigma
Theta's fashion show in Lagunita
Courtyard on Saturday night, you
saw dozens of students sashaying
down the runway modeling their
original designs. But they were not
wearing dresses, skirts or even so
much as a tank top on the catwalk
— only t-shirts were allowed.
Political t-shirts. to be exact. And
behind them, projected on to a

screen, was information about
propositions and candidates.
As part of the sorority's
national "I promise to vote" ini
tiative, the fashion show was
geared to educate attendees
about political issues relevant in
this year's election. The t-shirts
were designed by members of
14 student groups.
"All of us. as students, have
special concerns in this election
that need to be addressed, and
every group on campus recog
nizes that," said Angel Davis, a
member of the public service
sorority. "Our sorority wanted
to give students a break from
the lectures and a chance to
express their creativity and their
opinion."
Off the runway, students
have been branding themselves
in the latest political fashion this
fall. T-shirts that read "The only
bush I trust is my own" and
"Viva Bush" have become as
übiquitous on campus as
"Stanford" sweatshirts.
Many students have been
sporting

Kerry/ Edwards red rubber
bracelets, similar to the yellow
Livestrong bracelets that became
popular over the summer.
Sophomore Sasha Filippova,
whose boyfriend ordered dozens of
the bracelets from a political Web
site, said that hers has been met
with approval and envy by other
Stanford students.
"When I point it out to people,
they get pretty excited," she said. "I
got one for my roommate and it

was the most excit-

ing day of her
life."
"I'm definitely
proud to wear
my Democrats t
shirt," sopho
more Jen
Haskell said. "I

don't think it's

insulting at all."
Haskell. the
membership direc-

tor of the Stanford Democrats this
year, sports a t-shirt with the word
"DEMOCRAT" plastered across
the front. The back has a picture of
a donkey, with the words "Kiss my"
written above it.
"The thing on the back is sup
posed to be a joke. I wouldn't wear it
in a situation where I felt like I was
offending people," Haskell added.
What is happening at Stanford is
part of a national trend. Shirts that
read "Vote or Die," for example.

were recently worn on television by
F. Diddy and rocker Avril Lavigne.
A similar DKNY shirt was on dis
play at the Bloomingdale's located
at the Stanford Shopping Center
last weekend. Earlier this year,
popular fashion designer Marc
Jacobs released a limited edition
collection of Hillary Clinton shirts.
Andy Leifer, also a sophomore,
made his own shirt to express his
views. The front has a big anti-W
symbol, and the back has a Thomas

Jefferson quote:
"Dissent is the
highest form of
patriotism."
"Someone
told me once that
political views
are private, and I
think that is terri
bly wrong," Leifer
said. "Political
views are the most
public of all views

that there should be. because they
are the only views that you hold
that actually affect everyone else.
Your political views matter, and
there's nothing private about it."
Other Democrats like freshman
Meri Lugo have not taken off their
John Kerry t-shirts in days.
"I finally decided to wash it
today, but you can bet I will be
wearing it again tomorrow," said
Lugo last week. Even though there
is a wide political spectrum on cam-

pus, people with political fashion
like Lugo have not received much
negative feedback.
"I've actually encountered lots
of positive feedback when I go
around the dorm or around cam
pus," said Lugo, who identifies her
self as a strong liberal.
Students on the other side of the
political spectrum have been dis
playing their red.
"I've been sporting my Bush-
Cheney '04 shirt since probably
February of this year, maybe twice
a week," Fairbanks said.
"People sometimes smirk at me
when they see the Bush shirt and
they give me bad looks. It's pretty
funny."
Freshman Emily Allegrotti said
that the liberal message was more
visible on campus.
"I've definitely seen more of a
liberal presence in regards to elec
tion paraphernalia," she said. "But
then again, the overall liberal pres
ence on campus is stronger."
Others, like Leifer, claimed that
liberals are more open about their
affiliation than conservatives.
"1 actually think there are more
conservatives than people let onto
on campus," Leifer said. "It's kind
of scary."
But there are others who don't
identify with either major candi
date.
"I just want to get it done with!"
said Rosenbaum, in reference to
all of the political sentiments and
fashions in the air right now.

Political t-shirts. to be exact. And
behind them, projected on to a

screen, was information about
propositions and candidates.
As part of the sorority's
national "I promise to vote" ini
tiative, the fashion show was
geared to educate attendees
about political issues relevant in
this year's election. The t-shirts
were designed by members of
14 student groups.
"All of us. as students, have
special concerns in this election
that need to be addressed, and
every group on campus recog
nizes that," said Angel Davis, a
member of the public service
sorority. "Our sorority wanted
to give students a break from
the lectures and a chance to
express their creativity and their
opinion."
Off the runway, students
have been branding themselves
in the latest political fashion this
fall. T-shirts that read "The only
bush I trust is my own" and
"Viva Bush" have become as
übiquitous on campus as
"Stanford" sweatshirts.
Many students have been
sporting

Kerry/ Edwards red rubber
bracelets, similar to the yellow
Livestrong bracelets that became
popular over the summer.
Sophomore Sasha Filippova,
whose boyfriend ordered dozens of
the bracelets from a political Web
site, said that hers has been met
with approval and envy by other
Stanford students.
"When I point it out to people,
they get pretty excited," she said. "I
got one for my roommate and it

was the most excit-

ing day of her
life."
"I'm definitely
proud to wear
my Democrats t
shirt," sopho
more Jen
Haskell said. "I

don't think it's

insulting at all."
Haskell. the
membership direc-

tor of the Stanford Democrats this
year, sports a t-shirt with the word
"DEMOCRAT" plastered across
the front. The back has a picture of
a donkey, with the words "Kiss my"
written above it.
"The thing on the back is sup
posed to be a joke. I wouldn't wear it
in a situation where I felt like I was
offending people," Haskell added.
What is happening at Stanford is
part of a national trend. Shirts that
read "Vote or Die," for example.

were recently worn on television by
F. Diddy and rocker Avril Lavigne.
A similar DKNY shirt was on dis
play at the Bloomingdale's located
at the Stanford Shopping Center
last weekend. Earlier this year,
popular fashion designer Marc
Jacobs released a limited edition
collection of Hillary Clinton shirts.
Andy Leifer, also a sophomore,
made his own shirt to express his
views. The front has a big anti-W
symbol, and the back has a Thomas

Jefferson quote:
"Dissent is the
highest form of
patriotism."
"Someone
told me once that
political views
are private, and I
think that is terri
bly wrong," Leifer
said. "Political
views are the most
public of all views

that there should be. because they
are the only views that you hold
that actually affect everyone else.
Your political views matter, and
there's nothing private about it."
Other Democrats like freshman
Meri Lugo have not taken off their
John Kerry t-shirts in days.
"I finally decided to wash it
today, but you can bet I will be
wearing it again tomorrow," said
Lugo last week. Even though there
is a wide political spectrum on cam-

pus, people with political fashion
like Lugo have not received much
negative feedback.
"I've actually encountered lots
of positive feedback when I go
around the dorm or around cam
pus," said Lugo, who identifies her
self as a strong liberal.
Students on the other side of the
political spectrum have been dis
playing their red.
"I've been sporting my Bush-
Cheney '04 shirt since probably
February of this year, maybe twice
a week," Fairbanks said.
"People sometimes smirk at me
when they see the Bush shirt and
they give me bad looks. It's pretty
funny."
Freshman Emily Allegrotti said
that the liberal message was more
visible on campus.
"I've definitely seen more of a
liberal presence in regards to elec
tion paraphernalia," she said. "But
then again, the overall liberal pres
ence on campus is stronger."
Others, like Leifer, claimed that
liberals are more open about their
affiliation than conservatives.
"1 actually think there are more
conservatives than people let onto
on campus," Leifer said. "It's kind
of scary."
But there are others who don't
identify with either major candi
date.
"I just want to get it done with!"
said Rosenbaum, in reference to
all of the political sentiments and
fashions in the air right now.

If you went to Delta Sigma
Theta's fashion show in Lagunita
Courtyard on Saturday night, you
saw dozens of students sashaying
down the runway modeling their
original designs. But they were not
wearing dresses, skirts or even so
much as a tank top on the catwalk
— only t-shirts were allowed.
