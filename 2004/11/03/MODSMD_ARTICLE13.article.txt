# This Man's Life: Wolff reflects on his career and why he still loves to teach
## 
### GERRY SHIH 
Tobias Wolff reclines comfort
ably in his office chair, long legs
crossed, looking towards the oppo
site wall — one big bookcase, really,
stuffed with stacks of books, some
protruding off the edges of shelves.
There's undoubtedly some Chekhov
buried in there. Wolff loves Anton
Chekhov.
As he speaks in his measured but
vivid baritone, it's hard to imagine
that 31 years ago. Wolff was a rook
ie fiction writer in the very same
Stanford program that he later
directed.
Back then, he didn't have the
remarkable accomplishments or
fame that he has picked up in the
three decades since leaving Stanford
in the mid-19705.
By 1973, Wolff had already
worked as a waiter and night watch
man. He had also spent four years in
the Army with a Vietnam tour of
duty, and his work in newspaper
reporting was going nowhere. He
was then a 30-year old high school
teacher, and not doing what he real
ly wanted to do.
"I've wanted to write for as long
as I can remember," Wolff recalls.
"Maybe since when I was 14 or 15."
Then Stanford gave him the
chance to finally pursue his dream
job. After earning the prestigious
Stegner Fellowship, he arrived at
Stanford's Creative Writing
Program to improve his craft and
begin his writing career.
In Wolffs years as a writer, he
met both popular success and criti
cal acclaim. He has become a
revered figure in literary circles as a

teacher, mentor, memoirist and
master of the short story. But there
is no doubt that Wolff ultimately
writes for himself.
"Writing helps me towards
understanding myself, the world
around me and the people around
me," Wolff explains.
Not surprisingly. Wolff's best
known work is a memoir of his own
childhood. This Boy's Life, written
in 1989, was the basis for the 1993
motion picture of the same name.
The film starred Leonardo
DiCaprio as a teenage Wolff. Ellen
Barkin as his mother and Robert De
Niro as his abusive stepfather.
Among the many accolades the
memoir garnered, it received the
Los Angeles Times Book Prize for
biography.
Wolff's following memoir. In
Pharaoh's Army: Memories of the
Lost War, a National Book Award
finalist, was an account of his prep
school-drop-out-turned-Green-
Beret Vietnam experience.
He has also authored three col
lections of short stories and a novel
la. The Barracks Thief, which earned
him the PEN / Faulkner Award for
Fiction in 1985.
Through all these years. Wolff
has seen failure as well as success.
The writing process, its rewards and
punishments, joys and pains, are all
now familiar, accepted and indis
pensable parts of his life.
"Writing's hard, very hard, but 1
love writing and it makes me very
happy to see that now and then,
something I've written seems to
have touched people," Wolff said. "If
I couldn't teach, and couldn't pub
lish anything, I would still write ...

those who do it have to do
it."
Even today, Wolff finds
writing difficult, but
believes the most chal
lenging obstacles frustrate
inexperienced writers.
"First, your writing is
never as good as you imag
ine it is or think it should
be," Wolff offered as
advice to inexperienced
writers. "Second, you have
to learn to accept rejec
tion. It will take years for
you to be accepted."
With so much personal
writing experience, it's
only natural that Wolff has
been able to continually
balance writing and teach
ing.
He taught writing at
Stanford for three years
beginning in 1975, then at
Syracuse University until
1997, when he returned as
the Ward W. and Priscilla
B. Woods Professor in the
Humanities and Sciences
in Stanford's Creative
Writing Program.
So far, Wolff has
enjoyed coming home and
teaching.
"I love teaching the
warm-hearted," he says.

"The students here are particularly
generous, warm and friendly. I like
that they work hard and they're
bright."
In a time when universities seem
to produce more and more engi
neers and computer scientists, is
English, or the humanities as a field

in general, dying? Do people still
care about literature?
"They must," Wolff said. "We get
many great students in the English
department every year. There is a
very strong impulse here at
Stanford."
Fortunately for Stanford and its
students. Wolff himself values what

he believes he gets back from teach
ing.
"Sometimes there's a shared
excitement in language and stories,"
Wolff says. "When I feel that in class.
I know this is what I'm here for.
There's more light in the world for
me at that moment."

understanding myself, the world
around me and the people around
me," Wolff explains.
Not surprisingly. Wolff's best
known work is a memoir of his own
childhood. This Boy's Life, written
in 1989, was the basis for the 1993
motion picture of the same name.
The film starred Leonardo
DiCaprio as a teenage Wolff. Ellen
Barkin as his mother and Robert De
Niro as his abusive stepfather.
Among the many accolades the
memoir garnered, it received the
Los Angeles Times Book Prize for
biography.
Wolff's following memoir. In
Pharaoh's Army: Memories of the
Lost War, a National Book Award
finalist, was an account of his prep
school-drop-out-turned-Green-
Beret Vietnam experience.
He has also authored three col
lections of short stories and a novel
la. The Barracks Thief, which earned
him the PEN / Faulkner Award for
Fiction in 1985.
Through all these years. Wolff
has seen failure as well as success.
The writing process, its rewards and
punishments, joys and pains, are all
now familiar, accepted and indis
pensable parts of his life.
"Writing's hard, very hard, but 1
love writing and it makes me very
happy to see that now and then,
something I've written seems to
have touched people," Wolff said. "If
I couldn't teach, and couldn't pub
lish anything, I would still write ...

those who do it have to do
it."
Even today, Wolff finds
writing difficult, but
believes the most chal
lenging obstacles frustrate
inexperienced writers.
"First, your writing is
never as good as you imag
ine it is or think it should
be," Wolff offered as
advice to inexperienced
writers. "Second, you have
to learn to accept rejec
tion. It will take years for
you to be accepted."
With so much personal
writing experience, it's
only natural that Wolff has
been able to continually
balance writing and teach
ing.
He taught writing at
Stanford for three years
beginning in 1975, then at
Syracuse University until
1997, when he returned as
the Ward W. and Priscilla
B. Woods Professor in the
Humanities and Sciences
in Stanford's Creative
Writing Program.
So far, Wolff has
enjoyed coming home and
teaching.
"I love teaching the
warm-hearted," he says.

"The students here are particularly
generous, warm and friendly. I like
that they work hard and they're
bright."
In a time when universities seem
to produce more and more engi
neers and computer scientists, is
English, or the humanities as a field

in general, dying? Do people still
care about literature?
"They must," Wolff said. "We get
many great students in the English
department every year. There is a
very strong impulse here at
Stanford."
Fortunately for Stanford and its
students. Wolff himself values what

he believes he gets back from teach
ing.
"Sometimes there's a shared
excitement in language and stories,"
Wolff says. "When I feel that in class.
I know this is what I'm here for.
There's more light in the world for
me at that moment."

Tobias Wolff reclines comfort
ably in his office chair, long legs
crossed, looking towards the oppo
site wall — one big bookcase, really,
stuffed with stacks of books, some
protruding off the edges of shelves.
There's undoubtedly some Chekhov
buried in there. Wolff loves Anton
Chekhov.
As he speaks in his measured but
vivid baritone, it's hard to imagine
that 31 years ago. Wolff was a rook
ie fiction writer in the very same
Stanford program that he later
directed.
Back then, he didn't have the
remarkable accomplishments or
fame that he has picked up in the
three decades since leaving Stanford
in the mid-19705.
By 1973, Wolff had already
worked as a waiter and night watch
man. He had also spent four years in
the Army with a Vietnam tour of
duty, and his work in newspaper
reporting was going nowhere. He
was then a 30-year old high school
teacher, and not doing what he real
ly wanted to do.
"I've wanted to write for as long
as I can remember," Wolff recalls.
"Maybe since when I was 14 or 15."
Then Stanford gave him the
chance to finally pursue his dream
job. After earning the prestigious
Stegner Fellowship, he arrived at
Stanford's Creative Writing
Program to improve his craft and
begin his writing career.
In Wolffs years as a writer, he
met both popular success and criti
cal acclaim. He has become a
revered figure in literary circles as a

teacher, mentor, memoirist and
master of the short story. But there
is no doubt that Wolff ultimately
writes for himself.
"Writing helps me towards
understanding myself, the world
around me and the people around
me," Wolff explains.
Not surprisingly. Wolff's best
known work is a memoir of his own
childhood. This Boy's Life, written
