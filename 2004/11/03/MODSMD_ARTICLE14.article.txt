## SIW students canvass Philly suburb for Kerry 
### SHIRIN SHIRIF STAFF WRITER 
LANSDOWNE, Penn. â€” "Have you voted
yet?"
I hat was the most-asked question by Stanford
in Washington students who swept through
Delaware County, PA., yesterday to get out the
vote. This Philadelphia suburb held a significant
Republican edge in voter registration, with two
thirds of its residents registered as Republicans.
Eleven Stanford in Washington students, in
cluding this reporter, took advantage of a bus ser
vice from Washington, D.C. to Pennsylvania that
was funded by the Kerry/Edwards campaign.
They woke up at the crack of dawn and returned
at 9:30 p.m., just in time to the watch election re
sults start to roll in.
Students took the day off from their intern
ships to participate in this last-push, get-out-the
vote effort. At the end of their day, some students
said that they thought their hard work, along with
those of many other volunteers, had paid off.
At press time, with 98.7 percent of the state re
porting, Sen. John Kerry had 50.9 percent of the
votes in Pennsylvania and President George W.
Bush had 48.5 percent. In Delaware County,
Kerry had 57.2 percent of the votes and Bush had
42.4 percent.
Even before hearing the final results, students
felt satisfied with their experience of canvassing
the streets, energizing voters as they waited in
long lines at the polls and cheering and waving
signs through the streets.
"It was amazing," said senior David Louk.'i re
ally felt like I was making a difference. And I was

glad to he doing something to help Kerry win."
The Kerry campaign instructed volunteers to
employ a four-knock system to target likely De
mocratic voters. This meant that students visited
voters up to four times until they got a "yes" an
swer to the "Have you voted yet?" question. They
also offered rides to the polls for interested voters.
"We just went door to door when we entered
apartment buildings and didn't bother with the
lists they gave us," Louk said. "It was much more
effective because we were getting people who
would have been overlooked otherwise."
Louk was able to sign up a dialysis patient for
a ride to the polls who might not have voted oth
erwise. He also answered questions about polling
places and proper forms of identification, and he
was peppered with requests for Kerry / Edwards
stickers from kids in an urban neighborhood.
Junior Scott Thompson advised an elderly
woman who was afraid to vote in the basement of
her neighbor's house, which was her assigned vot
ing place.
On the bus ride home, the students said they
were excited about their day's work. The Kerry
campaign representative even stocked the bus
with authentic Pennsylvania-brand pretzels, chips
and beer. But the excitement may have come a bit
too early, as other swing states that Kerry was
counting on, such as Florida, did not appear to
come through for the senator.
"It's great that everyone seemed empowered
by our GOTV experience," said junior Ben El
berger, who organized the trip for the Stanford
students. "It's a shame that the results of the elec
tion were not the ones we were hoping for."
