## Ruskin likely to win Assembly seat 
### JOE SEXTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Democrat Ira Ruskin appeared to have de
feated Republican Steve Poizner last night in
the race for state assembly in California's 21st
district by a margin close enough that Poizner
was not prepared to concede as of 1:30 a.m.
The Poizner camp was not reachable for com
ment. but a Ruskin campaign spokesperson
said he believed that the Republican would
not concede until all of the absentee ballots
had been counted.
With 388 of 393 precincts reporting,
Ruskin led Poizner 51.9 percent to 48.1 per
cent. a margin of about 5,000 votes.
In the days leading up to the election, sup
porters of each candidate rallied in White
Plaza to sway Stanford students in one of the
state's most hotly contested elections.
Ruskin, a former mayor of Redwood City
and current city council member who gained
the backing of educational and environmental
groups, received steady support from the
Stanford Democrats. Ruskin earned a mas
ter's degree in communication in 1983 from
Stanford.
Kai Stinchcombe, a political science doctoral

student and president of the Stanford Democ
rats, coordinated get-out-the-vote-efforts for
Ruskin both on and off campus.
"I think this election shows the power of
grassroots movements," Stinchcombe said.
"This election was all about people talking to
other people one-on-one, and you can't buy
that."
Poizner, a billionaire Silicon Valley entre
preneur, ran on a platform of economic and
political reform. His main message to voters
was that since his campaign was funded exclu
sively by private individuals, he would not be
rendered beholden to special interest groups.
Republicans hoped that Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger's endorsement would carry
the political newcomer into office. To some,
Schwarzenegger's immense popularity indi
cated that voters might favor another socially
moderate Republican with little political ex
perience. But Poizner's fresh face, hefty per
sonal bankroll and business-friendly message
did not seem to be enough to defeat the sea
soned Ruskin.
"This election shows that this is a strong
Democratic district - one that will not elect a
Republican," said Stinchcombe.

porters.
