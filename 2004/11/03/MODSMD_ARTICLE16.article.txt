### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Election Day was a good one for
local and state Democrats, even if
the party did not have the same suc
cess on the national level.
Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen
ator Barbara Boxer won a third
term; Democratic U.S. Congress
woman Anna Eshoo. also an incum

point.
Eshoo spoke to The Daily early
last night about her campaign and
the issues important to her.

"As you approach the election,
it's always exciting," she said. "That
never wears off. You place yourself
in front of 6(X),(XX) people, and you
hope they find you worthy of hold
ing the position."
"These are very sobering times,"
Eshoo continued. "The issues that
confront our country are weighty
and challenging: our position in the
world, the war in Iraq, the war on
terrorism, the fiscal condition of the
United States. Not one of those is a
small issue."
Eshoo, who was reluctant to ac
knowledge an official victory in the
race, also spoke to The Daily about
some concerns she had for the na
tion.
"At the top of my list is that our
country regain its stature at the top
of the world." Eshoo said. "We need
to shore up our reputation, and we
need to get our troops out of Iraq
within the next two years."
In her bid for re-election to the
U.S. Senate, Boxer easily defeated
her opponents, including Republi
can Bill Jones. Boxer received 56

percent of the vote as of 11:15 p.m.,
with 40 percent of precincts report
ing. Those results showed that only

Democrats who have worked their
hearts out for me three terms
now." she said to the enthusiastic
