# Prop. 71 passes
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Californians voted yesterday to
support $3 billion for embryonic
stem-cell research over the next 10
years. Despite touching on hot-but
ton ethical issues and drawing criti
cism for its high price tag. Proposi
tion 71 passed with a healthy 20 per
cent margin.
The measure could bring tens of
millions of research dollars to Stan
ford and drew strong support from
School of Medicine faculty. Advo
cates pointed to possible cures for ju
( venile diabetes, heart disease,
Parkinson's and spinal cord injury.
In addition, with President George
W. Bush's likely reelection, federal
funding for stem-cell research is ex
pected to continue to be low.
Opponents cited concerns that
those in charge of distributing the
money might also be on the receiv
ing end or have other conflicts of in
terest. These skeptics also criticized
the measure for creating a $6 billion
debt for the state.
Prop. 71 has had a solid lead in re
cent polls. Still, Dr. Irving Weiss
man, director of Stanford's new In
stitute for Cancer / Stem Cell Biolo
gy and Medicine, said that he was

"always pessimistic until the last
minute."
According to Weissman, a few key
factors led to the proposition's suc
cess: framing the issue as a medical
one, not philosophical or religious;
the support of major disease societies;
and a well-organized campaign.
"When Arnold Schwarzenegger
came out in favor of it, I think that
pretty much settled it in," Weissman
said.
The state now has 40 days to es
tablish the infrastructure for its Insti
tute of Regenerative Medicine,
which will supervise the distribution
of funds. Weissman said that he
would be pushing to ensure that
those reviewing the grants would be
scientists from outside the state
without any financial ties to compa
nies that might receive funding.
"That's the only way to do it to le
gitimately gain the respect of those
providing the funding," he said,
adding that he was optimistic that his
concerns would be addressed. "The
only way it wouldn't happen is if
there were political appointments by
those who are not the leadership that
brought the proposition forward."
Representatives from anti-Prop.
71 campaigns could not be reached
for comment.
