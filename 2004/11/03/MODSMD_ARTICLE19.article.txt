## Editorials Students have room to improve

Young Americans have a reputation for
being uninterested in political affairs. A
significant increase in the number of regis
tered young voters during this year's presi
dential election cycle might have helped undermine
that image. But even the closeness of polls prior to
yesterday's vote and the hard feelings lingering on
both sides from the bitterly close race in 2(X)0 failed
to boost the amount of young voters as a proportion
of the entire electorate.
Participation among young voters, especially stu
dents. remained poor when compared to other seg
ments of the American public. Simply put. students
can — and should — do better.
Despite a strong push on college campuses by
both parties and national mobilization drives —
some even headlined by celebrities — young people
remained about the same proportion of the elec
torate as in 2000. As in the 2(X)0 election, fewer than
one in 10 voters were between IS and 24, according
to exit polls.
Overall, more young voters cast ballots than in
2000. But apparently, the same issues that energized
young voters, such as the war in Iraq, terrorism and
the economy, equally energized other voter seg
ments, keeping the proportion of young voters
roughly the same.
Yesterday's election was one that will significant
ly impact the future of America. Some have even
proposed that it might be the most important and in
fluential electoral choice of our lifetimes. The winner
of yesterday's election — widely expected to be

President George W. Bush — will have to deal with
record budget deficits, the volatile situation in the
Middle East, the appointment of two or three
Supreme Court justices and other pressing concerns.
Given all of this, it's a shame that more students
did not choose to register their opinions at such an
important juncture in our country's history.
And with the majority of students — particularly
those on the largely liberal Stanford campus — root
ing for Kerry over Bush, this means many young
Americans were likely disappointed by the election's
results. If more students had participated in key
states such as Ohio, the nation's final electoral out
come could very well have shifted.
Students are capable of exerting more influence
than they likely assume is possible.
Yet while students did not vote in the droves that
election observers might have expected, for those
dismayed by yesterday's semi-final outcome, it is im
portant to note there is a potential silver lining:
There is plenty of room for improvement next time
around.
Millions of students still are not choosing to vote.
And it's not too late to start working on them for the
2008 election.
We applaud the young voters who did take the
time to participate in yesterday's election in order to
ensure their voices were heard. As the future of
America, hopefully we will all learn the importance
of taking a more active role in participating in the
democratic process while urging our friends to do the
same.
