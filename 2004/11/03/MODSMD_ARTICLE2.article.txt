### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” Declar
ing President George W. Bush the
victor in the election against Sen.
John Kerry, White House Chief of
Staff Andrew Card announced early
this morning he was confident that
the president had won Ohio's elec
toral votes.
Bush left 4,000 of his supporters
hanging in anticipation last night
when he opted not to appear at the
Republican National Committee's
"2004 Victory Celebration" at the
Ronald Reagan Building and Inter
national Trade Center. Most televi
sion networks' projections left Bush
short of the necessary 270 electoral
votes. Some people, including Sen.
Kerry, believe that provisional bal
lots and a few remaining districts still
uncounted in Ohio leave the swing
state too close to call.
As late as 3 a.m., Republican Na

tional Committee Chairman I d
(iillespie, who was also chairman of
the festivities for the evening, tried
to keep the crowd's energy up, ex
plaining that the remaining votes to
he counted in ()hio were not likely
to totally erase Mush's 123,()(X) vote
lead. Even though there were
12(),()(X) provisional votes that had to
be counted, (lillespie said, a large
portion would he discarded.
Still, the crowd of Hush support
ers remained confident and excited
throughout the evening.
Many in the crowd were 20-some
thing political junkies who showed
up to cheer on Hush's campaign for
four more years in office and to rub
elbows with the staffs of the White
I louse, the RNC and Hush / ( heney
1)4 campaign.
"It is only fitting that our final
stop to victory is here in the Ronald
Reagan Huilding," said Senate Ma
jority Leader Hill l rist.
The stage was draped with a giant

American llag and featured a blue
backdrop with white stars that illu
minated the arched ceiling of the
building's modern interior. Against
this setting, tiers of cheering Bush
supporters waved red and blue cylin
drical balloons declaring "(!()P Vic
tory."
1 rist praised Bush's handling of a
number of issues, including the Sept.
11 attacks. "We didn't run away
we turned and faced our enemy," he
said.
I nst also said the president had a
plan to restore economic growth and
noted the tax cuts Bush enacted all
four years in office.
After every point he made, Frist
repeated the refrain that "President
Bush has not wavered, and we will
win," and the audience chanted "we
will win" along with him.

were turned away after being told that they could only vote with
a provisional ballot in the county of their residence.
