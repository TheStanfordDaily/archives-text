# Bush camp declares victory
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Declar
ing President George W. Bush the
victor in the election against Sen.
John Kerry, White House Chief of
Staff Andrew Card announced early
this morning he was confident that
the president had won Ohio's elec
toral votes.
Bush left 4,000 of his supporters
hanging in anticipation last night
when he opted not to appear at the
Republican National Committee's
"2004 Victory Celebration" at the
Ronald Reagan Building and Inter
national Trade Center. Most televi
sion networks' projections left Bush
short of the necessary 270 electoral
votes. Some people, including Sen.
Kerry, believe that provisional bal
lots and a few remaining districts still
uncounted in Ohio leave the swing
state too close to call.
As late as 3 a.m., Republican Na

tional Committee Chairman I d
(iillespie, who was also chairman of
the festivities for the evening, tried
to keep the crowd's energy up, ex
plaining that the remaining votes to
he counted in ()hio were not likely
to totally erase Mush's 123,()(X) vote
lead. Even though there were
12(),()(X) provisional votes that had to
be counted, (lillespie said, a large
portion would he discarded.
Still, the crowd of Hush support
ers remained confident and excited
throughout the evening.
Many in the crowd were 20-some
thing political junkies who showed
up to cheer on Hush's campaign for
four more years in office and to rub
elbows with the staffs of the White
I louse, the RNC and Hush / ( heney
1)4 campaign.
"It is only fitting that our final
stop to victory is here in the Ronald
Reagan Huilding," said Senate Ma
jority Leader Hill l rist.
The stage was draped with a giant

American llag and featured a blue
backdrop with white stars that illu
minated the arched ceiling of the
building's modern interior. Against
this setting, tiers of cheering Bush
supporters waved red and blue cylin
drical balloons declaring "(!()P Vic
tory."
1 rist praised Bush's handling of a
number of issues, including the Sept.
11 attacks. "We didn't run away
we turned and faced our enemy," he
said.
I nst also said the president had a
plan to restore economic growth and
noted the tax cuts Bush enacted all
four years in office.
After every point he made, Frist
repeated the refrain that "President
Bush has not wavered, and we will
win," and the audience chanted "we
will win" along with him.

The long and winding road
Voters wait in line to vote at Florence Moore Hall. Many students
were turned away after being told that they could only vote with
a provisional ballot in the county of their residence.
School of Advanced International
Studies, said she is taking more of an
interest in the presidential election
this year than ever before.
"The world is in such an interest
ing place," she said. "We're at a turn
ing point in American history. This
election will be a mandate for more
of what [Bush] is doing or for some
thing different."
As Bush received more and more
votes throughout the evening, the
crowd of supporters continued to
cheer jubilantly.
Deafening shrieks filled the room
of the main stage when FOX News
projected that Bush would win Ohio.
At that time, Bush was still hov
ering at 246 electoral votes. Boxing
promoter Don King then graced the
stage, wielding an American flag and
a cigar, and proclaimed, "From 246
to 270 — that ain't far."
By the time 79 percent of the New
Mexico precincts had given 52 per
cent of their votes to Bush, people
were cheering through the halls
while multi-colored spotlights
scanned the crowd.
Erin Riley, a junior from Con

necticut College and an ardent Bush
supporter, was able to attend the
event through her internship at the
American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative think tank.
Early on, Riley said she was con
fident Bush would win because peo
ple valued his leadership skills.
"I know more people who voted
this year than I've ever known to be
interested in politics before," she said.
Though Tierney also interns at
the American Enterprise Institute,
she voted for Kerry. She said that
many people were shocked to learn
she would be attending the Bush
rally even after voting for the Demo
cratic candidate.
"I think the problem with this
election is that there's so much ha
tred on both sides," Tierney said.
Much of the dialogue throughout
the evening suggested that such divi
sive attitudes stemmed from peo
ple's different interpretations of
facts and which facts they choose to
acknowledge.
For instance, a tense situation
arose among a group of student vol
unteers when one declared that the

FOX News projects Ohio,
supporters celebrate victory

whole world backed Bush over
Kerry. A more moderate student ar
gued just the opposite, citing anti-
American sentiments she had faced
in Europe. The rest of the group im
mediately came to the defense of the
first student, citing the pro-Bush ad
ministrations in Russia and Mexico
as examples.
Precautions were taken in this
election to avoid the debacle of the
2000 election, especially since this
race was expected — and proved to
be — a very close race as well.
Frank Walsh, first year law stu
dent at Georgetown University, said
that when he voted on an electronic
voting machine for the primaries in
his hometown of Tampa, Florida, he
received a great deal of assistance.
"There was a long line, and a per
son walked you through it,"he said.
"At the end, they give you a pat on
the back. It's like, it's not hard, I've
used an ATM before."
After Florida's electoral votes
went to Bush. Karen Hughes, a cam
paign advisor for Bush, said, "It's

the president had won Ohio's elec
toral votes.
Bush left 4,000 of his supporters
hanging in anticipation last night
when he opted not to appear at the
Republican National Committee's
"2004 Victory Celebration" at the
Ronald Reagan Building and Inter
national Trade Center. Most televi
sion networks' projections left Bush
short of the necessary 270 electoral
votes. Some people, including Sen.
Kerry, believe that provisional bal
lots and a few remaining districts still
uncounted in Ohio leave the swing
state too close to call.
As late as 3 a.m., Republican Na

tional Committee Chairman I d
(iillespie, who was also chairman of
the festivities for the evening, tried
to keep the crowd's energy up, ex
plaining that the remaining votes to
he counted in ()hio were not likely
to totally erase Mush's 123,()(X) vote
lead. Even though there were
12(),()(X) provisional votes that had to
be counted, (lillespie said, a large
portion would he discarded.
Still, the crowd of Hush support
ers remained confident and excited
throughout the evening.
Many in the crowd were 20-some
thing political junkies who showed
up to cheer on Hush's campaign for
four more years in office and to rub
elbows with the staffs of the White
I louse, the RNC and Hush / ( heney
1)4 campaign.
"It is only fitting that our final
stop to victory is here in the Ronald
Reagan Huilding," said Senate Ma
jority Leader Hill l rist.
The stage was draped with a giant

American llag and featured a blue
backdrop with white stars that illu
minated the arched ceiling of the
building's modern interior. Against
this setting, tiers of cheering Bush
supporters waved red and blue cylin
drical balloons declaring "(!()P Vic
tory."
1 rist praised Bush's handling of a
number of issues, including the Sept.
11 attacks. "We didn't run away
we turned and faced our enemy," he
said.
I nst also said the president had a
plan to restore economic growth and
noted the tax cuts Bush enacted all
four years in office.
After every point he made, Frist
repeated the refrain that "President
Bush has not wavered, and we will
win," and the audience chanted "we
will win" along with him.

President George W. Bush takes the phone from campaign worker Mick Turner and talks with a voter during an Elec

The long and winding road
Voters wait in line to vote at Florence Moore Hall. Many students
were turned away after being told that they could only vote with
a provisional ballot in the county of their residence.
School of Advanced International
Studies, said she is taking more of an
interest in the presidential election
this year than ever before.
"The world is in such an interest
ing place," she said. "We're at a turn
ing point in American history. This
election will be a mandate for more
of what [Bush] is doing or for some
thing different."
As Bush received more and more
votes throughout the evening, the
crowd of supporters continued to
cheer jubilantly.
Deafening shrieks filled the room
of the main stage when FOX News
projected that Bush would win Ohio.
At that time, Bush was still hov
ering at 246 electoral votes. Boxing
promoter Don King then graced the
stage, wielding an American flag and
a cigar, and proclaimed, "From 246
to 270 — that ain't far."
By the time 79 percent of the New
Mexico precincts had given 52 per
cent of their votes to Bush, people
were cheering through the halls
while multi-colored spotlights
scanned the crowd.
Erin Riley, a junior from Con

necticut College and an ardent Bush
supporter, was able to attend the
event through her internship at the
American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative think tank.
Early on, Riley said she was con
fident Bush would win because peo
ple valued his leadership skills.
"I know more people who voted
this year than I've ever known to be
interested in politics before," she said.
Though Tierney also interns at
the American Enterprise Institute,
she voted for Kerry. She said that
many people were shocked to learn
she would be attending the Bush
rally even after voting for the Demo
cratic candidate.
"I think the problem with this
election is that there's so much ha
tred on both sides," Tierney said.
Much of the dialogue throughout
the evening suggested that such divi
sive attitudes stemmed from peo
ple's different interpretations of
facts and which facts they choose to
acknowledge.
For instance, a tense situation
arose among a group of student vol
unteers when one declared that the

FOX News projects Ohio,
supporters celebrate victory

whole world backed Bush over
Kerry. A more moderate student ar
gued just the opposite, citing anti-
American sentiments she had faced
in Europe. The rest of the group im
mediately came to the defense of the
first student, citing the pro-Bush ad
ministrations in Russia and Mexico
as examples.
Precautions were taken in this
election to avoid the debacle of the
2000 election, especially since this
race was expected — and proved to
be — a very close race as well.
Frank Walsh, first year law stu
dent at Georgetown University, said
that when he voted on an electronic
voting machine for the primaries in
his hometown of Tampa, Florida, he
received a great deal of assistance.
"There was a long line, and a per
son walked you through it,"he said.
"At the end, they give you a pat on
the back. It's like, it's not hard, I've
used an ATM before."
After Florida's electoral votes
went to Bush. Karen Hughes, a cam
paign advisor for Bush, said, "It's
nice to have those in President
Bush's column."
