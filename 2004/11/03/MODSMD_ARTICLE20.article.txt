# Kerry need not concede just yet
## 
### 
In a turn that many observers likely found eerily
reminiscent of the 2000 election, Democratic
candidate John Kerry declined to concede the
presidential contest last night. Instead, running
mate John Edwards briefly addressed Democratic
supporters in Boston, explaining that the Kerry camp
would make certain "every vote would count and
every vote would be counted."
As the vote tallies stand at the time of publication,
the chance of a Kerry victory in the electoral college
is slim. Some may have been frustrated at the delay
of a George W. Bush victory that appears inevitable.
But Kerry's decision to wait was the right choice for
both his campaign and the country, given the infor
mation he had available at the time.
Kerry and his supporters have worked hard dur
ing the past two years to reach this point in the race.
As of early this morning, there were potentially hun
dreds of thousands of still-uncounted ballots in tight
ly contested state. In Ohio and possibly others, the
number of uncounted votes was greater than the
margin of Bush's lead â€” and so the Kerry camp le
gitimately held on to the hope that the contest was
not yet over.
Kerry's refusal to concede has not necessarily
triggered a lengthy recount process. He and Edwards
simply believe that the race should not be called until
the outcome becomes more clear.
Though having to wait several days before a final
winner is declared might be irritating, we see no com-

pelling basis on which to demand that Kerry abandon
his presidential bid at this point. The situation could
change today as more swing-state ballots are count
ed, but as of last night, the Bush camp's allegations
that Kerry was "delusional" in contesting Ohio were
off-base.
Additionally, we question the value of having an
immediate answer if it is less likely to be the final an
swer. It could be far worse for Kerry to concede the
race early as Al Gore did in 2(M)(), only to later retract
his concession. This would place him in a disadvan
taged position from which to pursue a fair and thor
ough legal challenge in the event of a dispute. It
would also guarantee far greater confusion than
would be brought about by a delay of a few days in
Kerry offering his concession.
If Kerry continues to refuse to concede the con
test after all the votes are counted and Bush's lead in
key swing states is still sizable, then Republicans and
Democrats alike will be right to complain.
But that is not the case as of now.
This year's presidential election witnessed histor
ically high voter turnout. It would be a shame if
Kerry gave up the race before all of those voters'
preferences were tabulated. While we urge Kerry to
allow the nation to move on once a clear final result
emerges, until then, the public should remain patient
as election officials feverishly work to sum up the
voices of all the nation's voters.
