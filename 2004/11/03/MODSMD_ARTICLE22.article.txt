## The
						Osama Election 
### 
Osama bin Laden's first
video appearance in 14
months just days before
the presidential election
suggests a desire to influence the
American voters. But his message
to the voters is far from clear.
What is clear is that Osama truly
does not care which candidate wins
the election. Indeed, it is not easy
to dream up a scenario in which
Osama himself does not emerge
stronger than ever.
Let's assume that Osama is
media-savvy enough to understand
that Americans — for the most
part — will see a headline that will
read something to the tune of "Bin
Laden tape promises more at
tacks." This would indicate that the
mere presence of a message from
him is intended to scare the Amer
ican public.
But to what end? To scare peo
ple away from the polls?
The world witnessed the horrors
that played out in Madrid in the
days leading up to Spain's elec
tions, and fear of the same happen
ing here might be enough to reduce
turnout. Conventional wisdom
holds that this would help Bush.
Bush has done wonders for bin
Laden recruiting-wise, mainly in
Iraq. But Kerry could follow
through on his softer rhetoric, with
drawing U.S. troops and interna
tionalizing the effort. Osama would
credit the work of the insurgent
fighters for the U.S. retreat and
thus enhance the image and popu
larity of both him and his extremist
movement.
From this perspective it looks
like a lose-lose situation for the
American public. Either way,
Osama broadens his appeal and the
battle for the hearts and minds of
moderate Muslims — which we are
currently losing horribly — be
comes even more of a lost cause.
Some counter that Osama is in
retreat mode himself. Generals
don't call fora cease-fire when they
are winning, and in his video he
does seem to be making us a ratio
nal offer: You leave us alone, and
I'll leave you alone.
And this is a statement that the
foreign-policy left would love to
buy into. It makes our opponent in

this struggle seem more rational. It
makes it seem as though a mutually
acceptable compromise is within
reach, should the U.S. abandon its
reckless foreign policy.
This leads us to the true danger
of his words.
Should the policymakers in the
capitals of Europe seize onto the
notion that Islamic extremism can
be combated through appease
ment. the Western world becomes

divided.
A tough-on
terror United
States and a Eu
ropean Union
that increasingly
thinks we're nuts
will only serve to
embolden this
mortal enemy.
Osama's ac
tions don't mesh
with his words.

Hijacking airplanes filled with
civilians and crashing them into
buildings with the hope and intent
of killing civilians cannot be re
garded as his attempt to establish a
bargaining position.
The world cannot allow him to
use such morally abhorrent at
tacks as leverage, or else they will
continue.
In other words, he is not an
enemy with whom a mutually ac
ceptable compromise is possible.
What the United States does to
combat this bad situation will re
quire some creative thinking on the
part of whoever is entrusted with
our foreign policy in the next ad
ministration. To invade another
Muslim country under the guise of
the war on terror would ensure a
century of warfare in the Middle
East, with American casualties in
creasing by the year.
But to pull great numbers of
troops out of Iraq too early rings of
the Soviet's withdrawal from
Afghanistan in the 1980s, the last
ing consequences of which nobody
could have imagined would be as
devastating as they are today.
