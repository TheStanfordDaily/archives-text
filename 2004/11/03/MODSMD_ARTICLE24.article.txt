California should be obligated to
pioneer stem cell research
I am deeply disappointed with
The Daily's editorial board's failure
to endorse Proposition 71. which
would usher in a new era of scientif
ic discovery by supporting stem-cell
research in California.
You rightly lament that the fed
eral government is not adequately
supporting stem-cell research.
However, you are not willing to
fight for such an important program
on the state level.
The editorial board claims that it
is not the "state's obligation" to
support stem-cell research. What do
you believe excuses states from pur
suing such a noble and moral objec
tive as fighting diseases that ravage
the human body and mind and ulti
mately cause death?

California is one of the most en
lightened, compassionate and pro
gressive states in the nation. It is our
obligation to lead the country by
whole-heartedly supporting stem
cell research.
It could be years before the fed
eral government frees itself from
the clutch of ideologues who falsely
appeal to "ethics" when they bar
embryos — which arc not being put
to use — from helping people who
are suffering. In the time we spend
waiting instead of acting, people
continue to suffer and embryos
needlessly go to waste. Promoting
stem-cell research is pro-life.
You cite our state's deficit as a
reason not to fund stem-cell re
search. Our state funds many pro
grams, many of which are less im
portant than stem-cell research, an
initiative with the potential to im

prove the quality of human life.
You say that we should not sup
port stem-cell research because
such an initiative is in its infancy,
with prospects that are not clear.
These are the same excuses that our
current administration uses to shirk
moral responsibility and cynically
suppress scientific inquiry.
You also state that you do not
support the proposition because it
favors finding cures for some dis
eases over others, such as breast
cancer or HIV. How does that di
minish the need to promote stem
cell research? Isn't seeking a cure
for even one disease worth our most
determined efforts?
However, stem-cell research
doesn't just seek the cure for one
disease, but many, including
Alzheimer's, Diabetes, cancer,
paralysis and Parkinson's.

And if there were an exciting
new way to research breast cancer
and HIV. I would hope the editorial
board would support that research,
along with Prop. 71. as a moral im
perative.

People with mental illnesses
deserve respect, better treatment
Please excuse me. but there is no
"the" mentally ill. no generic,
stereotypical group of people who
can be so addressed, as there is no
"the" Jews, no "the" Blacks. Please
do not promote stereotypes.
Caring for people with illnesses
is clearly a responsibility of society,
though I am in agreement with your
recommendation that taxing some

to provide for the health gare of a
specific group is wrong.
Instead, legislators should ex
amine what created our community
health care system — among the
best in the world — and apply that
knowledge to mental health.

Jacobs's criticism of Middle East
conflict coverage out of line
I am responding to Daniel Ja
cobs's letter yesterday ("Middle
East coverage is biased," Nov. 2).
He criticizes people who have writ
ten letters and editorials to The
Daily over the past two weeks —
myself included — trying his best to
find something even slightly critical

of the Israeli government so that he
can find a way to call it "anti-
Semitic" and stifle debate on cam
pus.
Jacobs argues that my letter
"draws directly on anti-Semitic
stereotypes" when the focus of my
letter was to emphasize the shared
humanity of the Israeli and Pales
tinian people — and the impor
tance of acknowledging the casual
ties and suffering on both sides —
as a crucial step towards peace and
understanding.
He says that my comment re
garding the media ("not as free as
we are led to believe") implies Jew
ish domination, when in reality I
was simply quoting Hedy Epstein.
Epstein's intention in making
that comment was not to suggest
that there were any conspiracies,
but rather to encourage audience
members to search for the truth by
visiting the region themselves,
since she feels that much of what
she sees in the news belies her per
sonal experience. I don't see why
Jacobs feels that such a message
should not be heard.
Jacobs's personally vindictive
attitude and the general tone of his
letter reminds me of the rowdy au
dience members — most of them
non-students like Jacobs — at the
Epstein speech.
Having graduated over 20 years
ago, Jacobs has no right to insult
current students and restrain de
bate on campus. He should not
worry about the journalism careers
of the editors who seem to under
stand that silencing dialogue on
campus as Jacobs proposes is not a
"reasonable" policy.
