## America should avoid bread lines for flu vaccines 
### DAVID R. HENDERSON 
A recent New York Times article
on the shortage of flu vaccines stat
ed that "the heart of the problem,
experts say, may be that no one per
son or agency is in charge of making
sure the United States has an ade
quate vaccine supply."
In fact, the heart of the problem
is too much centralized government
control.
No one person or agency is in
charge of making sure the United
States has an adequate supply of
bread. Do you line up for hours for
bread? No one is in charge of mak
ing sure we have an adequate supply
of VCRs. TVs or computers, yet
anyone willing to pay the price can
get these easily.
The reason markets work so well
is precisely that no one is in charge.
Instead, thousands of producers and

millions of customers make deci
sions that mesh with one another.
If the price of bread is too low so
that not everyone who wants bread
at that price can get it, then produc
ers and retailers raise the price of
bread and producers make more
bread at the higher price. Vaccines
aren't any different.
It's true that flu vaccine not used
this year must be thrown out. But
bread not used this week must be
thrown out, and there's no shortage
of bread.
Indeed, the countries in the
world that have done the worst are
those in which one person or agency
is in charge. In the Soviet Union, one
agency was in charge of making sure
people had an adequate supply of
bread. The result was that bread
lines were common.
And lesser attempts at central
planning, such as government-set

price controls, have also caused
shortages. Nixon's price controls on
gasoline in 1973 and Carter's in
1979, for example, caused long lines
for gasoline.
Similarly, price controls threaten
the supply of vaccines. In 1993,
Congress passed former first lady
Hillary Clinton's Vaccines for Chil
dren program, under which the gov
ernment now purchases more than
half the national supply of children's
vaccines at a forced 50-percent dis
count and then distributes it to doc
tors who administer it to the poor
and uninsured â€” despite a General
Accounting Office report at the time
stating that "vaccines are already
free" for the truly needy.
One result of price control pro
grams and liability laws has been
that the number of vaccine produc
ers has fallen in 30 years from 25
down to five. For some vaccines.

there is only one producer.
Tommy Thompson, secretary of
the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, has urged state at
torneys general to go after those
who they think price influenza vac
cines "too high." The vaccine busi
ness is already a high-risk one, due
to a limited product shelf life, uncer
tain demand and lawsuits. Do
threats of price controls make being
in the vaccine business more attrac
tive?
The solution to our vaccine prob
lems is jiot to put one agency in
charge but instead to reduce the role
of government so that the vaccine
market acts more like the U.S. bread
market and less like the Soviet one.
