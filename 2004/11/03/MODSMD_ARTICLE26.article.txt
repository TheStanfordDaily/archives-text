## Men set sights on NCAA title 
### SAMUEL CHEN 
Coming off a nearly perfect success
story last season — which was capped off
with a second-place team finish in the
NCAA Championships — the Stanford
men's swim team is primed for another
run. This time, however, it's a run at first
place.
"Being number two does keep us hun
gry," said junior Nick Wolfe. "It should
make for some very fast swimming."
The Cardinal lost swimmers for all but
two of eight events where Stanford fin
ished in the top three in last year's NCAA
championships. This might lead skeptics
to believe that the group of men forming
this season's team is overly optimistic.
However, this sentiment isn't shared by
most.
"We certainly have lost a few of our top
swimmers, in the seniors from last year,"
admitted 2003-04 Pacific-10 Conference
Newcomer of the Year Hongzhe Sun.
"But our freshmen are coming in with a
real positive attitude, and the team as a
whole is working extra hard this year to
make up for the deficit."
Added assistant coach Ted Knapp: "1
think we have several swimmers in each of
the four classes that can step up and help
replace the points we lost to graduation."
Historically, Stanford has done well
making up for such deficits. In fact, the
2003-04 conference season was capped by
the Cardinal's unprecedented 23rd con
secutive Pac-10 title.
This extraordinary run has occurred
under head coach Skip Kenney and
Knapp, two men of numerous distinctions.
Most recently. Coach Kenney was induct
ed into the International Swimming Hall
of Fame in May. Coaching at Stanford
since 1979, Kenney has distinguished him
self as a 16-time Pac-10 Coach of the Year
and six-time NCAA Coach of the Year,
and was selected to be the coach of the
1996 Olympic team.
All the "extra hard" work mentioned
by Sun is widely predicted to pay off this
year. Already the College Swim Coaches'
Association of America's (CSCAA) first
dual meet rankings tab Stanford at second
in the nation. The Cardinal trail only
Auburn, which has a 12-point advantage
(175-163) in the poll — the exact 1 -2 rank

ing from the end of last season. Arch-rival
No. 3 California is ranked third, trailing
Stanford by only two points.
Stanford is co-captained by seniors
Jayme Cramer, the reigning NCAA 200
freestyle champion, and Matt McDonald,
the school record holder in the 100 butter
fly. Other top returnees are senior Gary
Marshall and sophomores Ben Wildman-
Tobriner, Andy Grant and distance swim
mer Shaun Phillips.
The incoming class has a lot to offer as
well.
"All the freshmen are working real

hard and have improved a lot already, but
as for surprises, we'll just have to wait until
the actual competition starts," Sun said.
Stanford's schedule, following Oct.
23's traditional Alumni meet, begins with
two home dual meets. The Cardinal first
host Cal State Bakersfield Nov. 5, and that
is followed by a date with Cal on Nov. 10.
The last scheduled meet prior to the win
ter recess is the Speedo Cup. where Stan
ford took top honors last year, gaining
1885 points, easily exceeding the next
highest total (Brigham Young) by 873
points. In early January, home dates with

Michigan and Pacific are scheduled, fol
lowed by a trip down to Arizona State and
Arizona. The Cardinal complete their
conference schedule by hosting No. 8
Southern California and conclude with a
road trip to Berkeley.
The Pac-10 Championships are sched
uled for March 2-5, in Long Beach, Calif.,
and the NCAA Championships are sched
uled for March 24-26, in Minneapolis,
Minn.
The diving team is also gearing up fora

Senior Jayme Cramer will captain the Cardinal men's swim team alongside senior Matt McDonald this year. The Cardinal hope to
reach the NCAAs and capture the first place finish that eluded them last year, when the team took second.
successful season of its own. Composing a relatively large
team of six divers are a balanced attack of two freshmen,
three seniors and one sophomore. Stanford is coached by
Dr. Rick Schavone, one of the top diving instructors in
the country and coach of both the men's and women's
teams.
With the much-anticipated upcoming season official
ly beginning this weekend at the USC Trojan Invite in
Southern California, things are not expected to be easy.
"As for Pac-10 and dual meets, the league is very com
petitive, and we'll have to step up and dive well for suc
cess," Schavone said.

Divers start the year
off at Trojan Invite

The team is led by senior Adam Peterson — coming
off an injury that kept him out of the 2(X)4 Pac-10 and
NCAA championships — the diver most likely to score
at the NCAA Championships in March
Also expected to contribute are seniors Jeff Durbin
and Jesse Former, sophomore Kevin McLean, and the in
coming freshman duo of Nathan Kim and Mark Gilbert.
For both the Stanford men's swimming and diving
teams, their seasons are predicted to be filled with
hard-fought battles for points and with prospects for
conference and national success — and it all starts this
weekend.
