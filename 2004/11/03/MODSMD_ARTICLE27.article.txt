## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was a big week in the Pacific-10 Conference in terms of
margins, as the favored teams in all five contests won convinc
ingly. Now, there are no more than three teams tied for any one
of the five possible records in the Pac-10 (all teams have played
five games).
Top-ranked Southern California and No. 4 California are
clearly the class of the conference, with No. 23 Arizona State
narrowly holding on to a national ranking. UCLA and Ore
gon State round out the five teams with winning records in
the conference.
There were two shutouts on Saturday, including Cal's second
in two weeks and UCLA's first in the Pac-10 since 1987. Every
game was decided by at least two touchdowns.
No. 1 USC 42, Washington Stale 12
The defending national champion Trojans (8-0, 5-0 Pac-10)
led 35-0 at halftime and never looked back in an easy win over
the stumbling Cougars (3-5,1-4) in Los Angeles.
Reggie Bush rushed for 57 yards and a touchdown, caught
five passes and returned a punt 57 yards for another score to
lead USC. Also, LenDale White rushed 16 times for 78 yards
and two touchdowns, and Matt Leinart completed 23-of-28
passes for 235 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions.
While the Trojans were on cruise control, the Cougars found
themselves doing damage control. Alex Brink completed just

17-of-40 passes for 165 yards, and Jerome Harrison led the team
with a mere 23 yards rushing on 11 carries. Michael Bumpus
caught six halls for 68 yards, including a touchdown, and Pat
Bennett intercepted Trojan backup Matt Cassel and returned it
28 yards fora score in the fourth quarter.
No. 7 California 27, No. 23 Arizona State 0
Aaron Rodgers completed 15-of-29 passes for only 165 yards
and one touchdown for the normally high-octane Bears (6-1, 4-
1). hut his defense and his tailback more than bailed him out.
J.J. Arrington ran 30 times for 192 yards and a score, and Tim
Mixon returned an interception 58 yards fora touchdown for
Cal, which also got two long field goals from Tom Schneider.
Robert Jordan led the Golden Bears with seven catches for 1 lo
yards and a touchdown.
Arizona State's Andrew Walter was 25-of-41 passing for 238
yards but could not find the end zone, and the Sun Devils (6-2,
3-2) lost four fumbles. Hakim Hill gained 104 yards on just nine
carries on a damp night at Memorial Stadium.
The back-to-back shutouts were the Golden Bears' first such
pair since 1968. and the Devils were held scoreless for the first
time since 1995. The Bears' new No. 4 ranking is their highest in
a half-century.
