Only two weeks into the season the No. 4 ( ardinal
women divers have a lot of competition experience
under their belts. This weekend. Stanford will head to
Los Angeles to the Southern California Trojan Invite
for its third straight weekend of competition.
Two divers have emerged early in the season as the
team leaders, and both look like potential contenders
for the national crown in March. Senior Ashlee
Rosenthal and sophomore Cassidy Krug may be the
smallest members of the Stanford team, but the num
bers they put up are consistently huge.
In the first meet of the season. No. 22 Hawaii's
OiongJie Huang won both the one-meter and three
meter competitions, but Krug and Rosenthal were
right behind her, each coming away with a second- and
a third-place finish.
Last weekend in Texas, the Stanford pair were the
ones to beat. Once again they shared the glory, as each
one took a first-place finish at one height and came in
second at the other. In the one-meter springboard,
they were joined by teammates senior Erin Lashnits
and freshman Katie Lampe to sweep the top four spots
for the Cardinal.
Head coach Rick Schavone is confident that these
four, along with Sara Bowling, a junior platform spe
cialist, and sophomore Brooke Sullivan can continue

to build upon this strong start to become one of the
strongest teams in the country. He said he would not
be surprised to see one of his girls on top of the podi
um at the NCAA Championships.
The divers have approached their training this sea
son in a somewhat different manner than in past years.
Emphasis has been placed on solidifying fundamen
tals and building strength, both of which seem to be
contributing factors to the team's early success.
"We're doing so many different things this season
from last." Krug said. "And we're definitely working
basics a lot and we need that. I actually think that that
is helping us a 10t... I feel so much stronger now than
1 did last year at this time in the season."
Rosenthal agreed and added, "We're definitely try
ing to improve more in the beginning of the season on
our skills and not worrying so much about outcome.
Thinking more towards the end of the season, we're
thinking that our skills will be there."
The improvement is most obvious in Rosenthal's
and Krug's teammates. Two weeks ago against
Hawaii. Schavone opted to take only the tandem to
the competition, keeping the rest of the team at home
to train until he felt they were ready to compete. Only
one week later, he saw two of those who had stayed at
home turn in solid performances to beat out everyone
else in Texas.
