## Anybody else still waiting for a great football turnaround?

I've been thinking about this fora while
now. It's entirely possible that I might
graduate without seeing a winning season
for the Cardinal in what might be the most
visible sport on campus, and 1 don't know
what it feels like to celebrate a Big Game vic
tory. This does not sit well with me, fora wide

variety of reasons.
After respective 2-9 and 4-
7 seasons in 2002 and 2003,
the Cardinal have already
equaled their win total from
last year. But to finish out the
season, Stanford faces two
ranked opponents on the
road (Arizona State and Cal)
and a much-improved Ore
gon State squad whose only

losses have come against ranked teams. Grant
ed, there is still the outside chance that the
Cardinal could reach a howl game if they win
two of these three matches and are selected to
play. However, from an unbiased perspective
this seems pretty unlikely based on the Cardi
nal's recent offensive performance and the dif
ficulty of their opponents.
To be honest, what appears a lot more plau
sible is another 4-7 finish punctuated by five
consecutive losses.
Granted, after Stanford's 9-3 Seattle Bowl
season in 2001, everyone knew there would be
a difficult transition following the departure of
Tyrone Willingham. Buddy Teevens was
brought in as the offensive guru from Florida
who had presided over Steve Spurrier's highly
successful scheme there, and was expected to
install his "Fun-n'-Gun" pass-heavy approach.
The Cardinal recruiting class was again strong,
and expectations were relatively high.
What was in store, however, would have
surprised even the most pessimistic of fans.
The slide to 2-9 the following year was one of
the most precipitous drops in the NCAA, and
the Cardinal have now lost back-to-back Big
Games. Furthermore, the fan base doesn't
seem to care much, as the predominant atti
tude seems to be that the football program is in
a necessary "rebuilding" phase, wherein a few
years of mediocrity must be endured in order
to return to the top of the Pac-10.
Mediocrity, though, would be a rather gen
erous assessment. The Cardinal rank fifth in
scoring and eighth in rushing yards in the con
ference, and they were shut out last week by a
UCLA defense that was previously giving up
an average of four touchdowns a game. The
Cardinal have now scored 91 points on the sea
son. a total exceeded by every Pac-10 team ex
cept Washington and Arizona. Needless to
say, this is not great resume material fora man
brought in to overhaul the offense.
The thing is, I'm sure Buddy Teevens is a
good guy. Early in his tenure here, he re
vamped the weight room and locker room and
now presides over immaculate facilities that
would satisfy most professional teams. He's
well-liked by every football player I've talked
to and is widely regarded as a players' coach.
Thus, the athletic department's decision to
stick with Teevens is completely understand
able, but it seems to have run its logical course.
When a coaching staff receives heavy fire
across the nation for the playcalling that led to
second-half collapses against USC and Notre
Dame, something is wrong. While player exe
cution was partially responsible in these cases,
it is difficult to explain the consistent failure of
the offense to adapt its strategies. Even though
Teevens is not directly responsible for calling


Dan NUCarthy
the plays, it is his supposed area of expertise, and he
has the final say over offensive coordinator Hill Cubit.
This is a program that has no shortage of top-tier
athletes. Trent Edwards is a sharp quarterback in a
conference full of them, and the running game is an
chored by J.R. Lemon and Kenneth Tolon, who have
a combined seven years of varsity experience. Fur
thermore, the defense has been outstanding recently,
allowing only 16.8 points per game on the season.
Stanford has shown repeatedly that it is capable of
producing elite teams even despite its stringent aca
demic requirements, something that is made even
more obvious by its successes in other sports.
On Nov. 20, the coaching situation will be more ap
parent than ever, when the Cardinal travel to Berke
ley to face a Bears team that has been on fire of late,
having won nine of its last 10 games (with its only loss
coming to top-ranked USC). Cal coach Jeff Tedford,
hired at the same time as Teevens, inherited a 1-10

team and turned it into a scoring machine, ringing up
the two highest point totals in school history in his first
two seasons and compiling a 21-12 record with what
was previously regarded as one of the worst football
programs in the nation. Meanwhile, Stanford contin
ues to slog through a "rebuilding" phase with no end
in sight.
The Pac-10 this year is the most difficult conference
in the nation, according to BCS analyst Jerry Palm.
I fence, the prevailing response to any questions about
the Cardinal's struggles on the gridiron is that they
play tough opponents and therefore can't expect ex
cellence all the time.
Why can't they? It seems like recently Cardinal
fans have stopped expecting it at all. Perhaps it's time
fora change.
