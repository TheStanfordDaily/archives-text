BOSTON, Mass. — Uncertainty
about the presidential vote in ()hio
prevented Sen. John Kerry from at
tending his own party.
More than 10,000 supporters
streamed into Boston's Copley
Square last night fora public rally
and party sponsored by the city for
Kerry.
But Kerry did not make it to ('op
ley Square as planned. Instead, he
sent his running mate, Sen. John 1 Ed
wards, to address the thousands of
patient supporters who remained at
2:30 a.m. EST. Edwards told the
crowd that he and Kerry were far
from conceding anything.
"It's been a long night, but we've
waited four years for this victory. We
can wait one more night," he said,
suggesting that the election results,
hinging on ()hio, would not be final
ized for at least another day.
"John Kerry and I made a promise
to the American people that in this
election every vote would count and
every vote would be counted.
Tonight we are keeping our word
and we will fight for every vote," 1 Id
wards said.
"You deserve no less," Edwards
added, echoing the sentiment of Bon
Jovi, who had ignited the crowd
hours earlier with a rousing rendi
tion of Bruce Springsteen's "No Sur
render."
Hundreds lined the street hours
before the festivities officially began
at 8 p.m. The party was a star-stud
ded event that included perfor
mances by Bon Jovi, James Taylor,
Sheryl Crow, Carole King and the
Black Eyed Peas. Partygoers also
watched live news coverage on
jumbo screens as networks projected

fall for Bush, the crowd was palpa
bly upset, and party organizers
quickly switched the station to
CNN, which maintained that the
state was still too close to call.
The crowd began thinning after
1.a.m.., as Bostonians ran to catch
the Metro before stations closed;
those who remained shouted
"Kerry, Kerry, Kerry!"
However, the subdued tone did
not prevail all night. Loud cheers
erupted across the square when
Kerry was projected to take hotly
contested states like Pennsylvania,
New Hampshire and Minnesota,
which were called for Kerry by CNN
well after 2 a.m.
Earlier in the day, Kerry lunched
with his wife Teresa Heinz-Kerry at
a popular local seafood restaurant.
Kerry is a superstitious man, who
still carries a four-leaf clover given
to him during the lowa caucus in the
pocket of the same mustard yellow
barn jacket he wore throughout the
primaries. He has eaten lunch at the

Old Union Oyster House on every
Election Day of his Massachusetts
political career.
"My dad first brought me here
when I was about 12 years old,"
Kerry told fellow diners at the bar
while enjoying a plate of littleneck
clams and a cup of chowder, his fa
vorite meal according to restaurant
manager Jimmy Malinn. A surpris
ingly energetic Kerry left his barn
jacket at home, looking well-rested
as he greeted onlookers in a navy
suit and red tie.
At the bar, Kerry also joined in a
toast "for victory," raising his Pil
sner beer high for the camera. Ma
linn noted that Kerry doesn't cus
tomarily have beer with every meal.
"He'll usually drink a diet soda or
something," he said.
Heinz-Kerry, dressed in a light
green pantsuit, left midway through
lunch while her husband continued
to socialize with restaurant patrons,
posing in photos, including one with
a 15-lb. Lobster, and shaking hands.

to have his favorite meal

"I just turned 18 yesterday," high
school student Shannon O'Reilly
told the senator while her mother
took a photo.
"Ah, but have you voted?" he
quipped after wishing her a happy
birthday.
O'Reilly sensed the excitement
ringing through the city. "First the
Sox win the World Series, and now
John Kerry is going to be the next
president — this is so cool!" she said.
Malinn said Kerry is "a fairly reg
ular fixture" at the restaurant and
often eats there unnoticed, "except
that he's quite tall."
"He's very outgoing, he makes
you feel like you've known him for
ever," Malinn said, adding that
"he's a good tipper."
Kerry spent about 45 minutes eat
ing at the bar, then left to conduct a
final series of press interviews
throughout the afternoon. He head
ed to his Boston home to have din
ner with his family and to wait for
poll results.
