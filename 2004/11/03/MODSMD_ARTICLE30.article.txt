# Tennis heads to National Indoors
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
Tomorrow, the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team heads
to the ITA/Omni Hotels National Indoor Championships,
the third of four individual tournaments held each season.
Senior Erin Burdette (5-2) and junior Alice Barnes (5-3)
are the lone Cardinal representatives among the tournament's
stringently selected. 32-member playing field in Ann Arbor,
Mich.
Barnes is seeded among Nos. 5-8 in the singles competition,
a ranking she earned by finishing second at Stanford's own
ITA Northwest Regional Championships last week.
As a duo ranked at No. 13 in the nation. Barnes and Bur
dette clinched the Northwest tournament with a nailbiting 9-7
victory over Courtney Jantz and Lucia Sainz of Fresno State.
However, they remain unseeded at Indoor, taking a back seat
to Florida's upstart freshman tandem of Whitney Benik and
Lolita Frangulyan (17-1).
The top-seeded Gators established themselves quickly at
last month's ITA All-American Championships; the team
survived seven qualifying rounds of play before unseating
Notre Dame's No. 7 Catrina and Christian Thompson in the
final. 8-3.
The Thompson twins are seeded second, followed by Flori
da's Jennifer Magley and Zerene Reyes, and Arizona's Maja
Mlakar and Dianne Hollands.


HILARY FAUST/The Stanford Daily File
Stanford has not fared well in the past four Indoor
championships, failing to get past quarterfinals.
While Barnes and Burdette are
no strangers to the Indoor game —
2(X)4 marks No. 17 Burdette's fourth
appearance at the tournament and
Barnes' third — the fledging suc
cesses which resulted in an Indoor
invitation for many competitors lend
the tournament a feeling of exciting
ambiguity.
Ultimately, the Indoor is any
one's game.
For No. 6 Barnes, the usual two
week rest between regional tourna
ments and Indoor was cut short due
to the chaos caused by nasty weath
er during the Northwest competi
tion. Last Monday. Barnes played
three consecutive matches and still
had a singles final waiting for her.
"It doesn't technically matter
who wins, since both of us qualify for
Indoor," Barnes said going into the
final.
An exhausted Barnes let the
Northwest title slip through her fin
gers as eager California freshman Suzi
Babos cruised to her l()th consecutive
victory in straight sets. 6-2.6-4.

Babos is also seeded among Nos.
5-8 at the Indoor.
Meanwhile, top-seeded Audra
Cohen of Northwestern appears un
stoppable. Just one month after the
start of the 2(X)4 season, the unranked
freshman boasts a 19-0 record and
has three titles under her belt.
Closing out all but three of her
matches in straight sets, the only two
opponents able to force a third set
have been Florida's No. 12 Jennifer
Magley. in the Round of 32 at Ail-
American. and teammate Christelle
Grier. the top-ranked singles player
in the nation.
Grier (10-3), toppled in the Mid
west Regional final. 6-2.3-6,6-0. She
is now seeded second behind Cohen.
By comparison. Grier made
quick work of Burdette in a consola
tion match at the ITA All-Ameri
can, 6-4,6-2.
Grier, a sophomore, made a
strong showing at Indoor last year,
losing in the semifinals to two-time
winner Agata Cioroch of Georgia. 6-
3.5-7.7-6(4).

Barnes and Burdette
no strangers to Indoor

II past results are any indicator,
then, the Cardinal faces tough odds
at the Ann Arbor showdown. Alum
na Laura Granville's 2(XX) victory
brought a four-year trend of Cardi
nal victors to a close.
Since then, the Cardinal have
been knocked out of the running by
the quarterfinals. Last year. Califor
nia's Sasha Podkolzina pummeled
Stanford alumna Lauren Barmkow
in the quarterfinals, 6-3.6-1. after al
lowing Barnes a meager four games
in the previous round.
Everything's not lost, however.
For instance. No. 30 Podkolzina (5-
4). described as "probably the scari
est one out there" by Stanford assis
tant coach Frankie Brennan before
the Northwest tournament, fell un
ceremoniously to Washington's No.
11 Dea Sumantri in the quarterfi
nals, 6-2,6-1.
So stick around to see just whose
game it becomes.
The action begins tomorrow at
Michigan's Varsity Tennis center at
8:30 a.m.
