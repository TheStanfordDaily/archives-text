# Tennis heads to National Indoors

### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
Tomorrow, the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team heads
to the ITA/Omni Hotels National Indoor Championships,
the third of four individual tournaments held each season.
Senior Erin Burdette (5-2) and junior Alice Barnes (5-3)
are the lone Cardinal representatives among the tournament's
stringently selected. 32-member playing field in Ann Arbor,
Mich.
Barnes is seeded among Nos. 5-8 in the singles competition,
a ranking she earned by finishing second at Stanford's own
ITA Northwest Regional Championships last week.
As a duo ranked at No. 13 in the nation. Barnes and Bur
dette clinched the Northwest tournament with a nailbiting 9-7
victory over Courtney Jantz and Lucia Sainz of Fresno State.
However, they remain unseeded at Indoor, taking a back seat
to Florida's upstart freshman tandem of Whitney Benik and
Lolita Frangulyan (17-1).
The top-seeded Gators established themselves quickly at
last month's ITA All-American Championships; the team
survived seven qualifying rounds of play before unseating
Notre Dame's No. 7 Catrina and Christian Thompson in the
final. 8-3.
The Thompson twins are seeded second, followed by Flori
da's Jennifer Magley and Zerene Reyes, and Arizona's Maja
Mlakar and Dianne Hollands.
