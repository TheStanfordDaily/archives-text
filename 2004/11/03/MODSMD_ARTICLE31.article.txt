# Crew faces early disappointment
## 
### WES MATEO 
It was not a great weekend for
the women's varsity and
lightweight crew teams, but the
good news is that it's only October.
Both teams came home mildly
disappointed from the Head of the
American regatta in Sacramento,
they also came home with a better
understanding of what improve
ments need to be made and a burn
ing desire to make them.
"We were disappointed because
we're not where we want to be,"
said junior Sam Magee, who
stroked the varsity's first eight boat
in its sixth-place finish for the
women's Open 8+ event. "We've
done a lot better in past years. We
have a lot of room for improve
ment, so we need to step it up."
Finishing seventh in the
women's Open 8+ event was the
varsity's second eight, which man
aged to pass three boats—UC-
Santa Barbara. Mills and Califor
nia's second lightweight — in post
ing a time of 18:22 minutes.
Magee also pointed out, though,
that it is still very early in the sea
son, and that fall head races, such
as the Head of the American, have
no bearing on NCAA rankings.
Magee also rowed with sopho
more Carly York in the women's
Open 2x, a sculling event in which
each rower used two oars instead
of one. Making it down the five
kilometer course in 21:08, the Stan
ford pair posted a time more than
two minutes faster than that ol run
ner-up Ashland Rowing Club.
For the lightweight women, the
highlight of the day was the team's
performance in the women's
lightweight 4+ event, in which the
team placed second behind Sacra
mento State with a course time of
23:33.
Sophomore cox Jennie
Morawetz noted the "incredible

finish," in which rowers Nicole
Pierce, Judith Pond. Renee Spell
man and Amina Richardson dug
deep to produce in the closing me
ters of the race. It was this final
push that propelled the Stanford
lightweights past two other boats
and into second place. Morawetz
underscored the effort of Pierce,
who was stroking the lightweight
four boat only hours after rowing
the five kilometer course in the
women's Open 2- event.
What made the success of the
lightweight four even more re
markable, though, was the fact that
it was only Morawetz' second time
ever sitting in a the cox seat. Nor
mally one of the lightweight team's
rowers, Morawet/ was forced into
emergency cox duty due to the last
minute absence of one of the
team's two regular coxes. And hav
ing had only one day to practice the
tricky art of steering a shell.
Morawetz responded brilliantly.
"She was amazing, even besides
the fact that it was her first time,"
Pierce said. "She brought some
stuff as a rower that really helped
her do what she wanted to do with
the boat and get the job done."
Characterizing her first coxing
experience as a blast. Morawetz
went on to express relief that her
debut hadn't resulted in the dam
age of any equipment. Still, she
said, it was not a position change
she was thinking about making
permanently.
Earlier in the day, the
lightweight team entered two pairs
into the women's Open 2- event —
one rowed by Morawetz and
Pierce, and the other by seniors
Kate Vieh and Cady kintner. Hut
in a race dominated by five Cal
open weight pairs, the value of the
race for the two Stanford tandems
lay in the opportunity to get out on
the water in a race situation and
work on technique.

The lightweight team also en
tered an eight in the women's
Open 8+ event. But unable to
match the time of rival Cal's
lightweight boat, the Stanford
lightweights came away disap
pointed from what sophomore
Meredith Coleman deemed a
"kind of poor showing." Still, with
time comes improvement, as re
flected by veteran Nicole Pierce's
assessment that the team right now
needs to develop its ability to focus
competitive energy.
"But we're just not there yet."
Pierce said.
Representing the men's team at
the Head of the American this
weekend were two novice eights,
both seeing their first competitive
action of the season. Head coach
Craig Amerkhanian decided not to
send any of his more experienced
oarsmen to the regatta, so the two
novice boats competed in two
events Saturday — the men's
Novice Collegiate 8+ and the
men's Open B+.
With a time of 17:12 minutes,
the Stanford A boat placed third in
the Novice Collegiate event, trail
ing only two Cal boats. The Stan
ford B boat finished 11th overall,
posting a 21:29 time.
In the Open 8+ event later that
morning, the two Stanford boats
faced off against much more expe
rienced collegiate varsity boats,
getting an early glimpse of a very
high level of competition. The
Stanford A boat placed 10th out of
13 entries while the Stanford B
boat dropped its time down the
course by 41 seconds, to 20:48.
The performance of the two men's
boats at such an early stage of the sea
son offers a promising prospect for
the remainder of the year.
This weekend, the women's
lightweight team heads to New
port. CA for the Newport Autumn
Fall Regatta.
