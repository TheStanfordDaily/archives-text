liager to gel out and vote, junior
John Hamilton woke upon Election
Day morning to join an hour-long
line at 8 a.m. at I Jniversity I uthcran
Church, l or many Stanford students
who began their days like I lamilton,
the excitement mounted as exit polls
around the nation indicated that
Sen. John Kerry had an early lead,
liul as the evening wore on, a frus
trated defeatism set in among Kerry
supporting students at the ('olio as
they watched key states turn red on
the electoral map.
()f 42 people interviewed after
voting at 1.1 Centro ("hicano, 3<S said
they voted for Kerry. Two said they
voted for Hush, one for independent
candidate Ralph Nader, and one for
libertarian candidate Michael Had
narik. As of 1 lp.m. last night, polls
indicated that 65 percent of Santa
Clara County had voted for Kerry.
Annie Russell, an inspectoral the
Wilbur I hill polling center, said that
she was surprised at the large voter
turnout this year; there was a contin
uous stream of voters throughout
the day. In her eight years of over
seeing voting on campus, she said
she had never seen more than 3(H) in
a single day. but at 4 p.m. yesterday,
2(X) people had already voted at
Wilbur. The polls closed at <S p.m.
Students continually checked re
sults online and started gathering at

several locations on campus as early
as 5 p.m. to watch television cover
age and discuss the results with
friends.

results of the presidential election.
said. "Hut at least Bush won Col
orado bv a smaller margin than he
did in the last election."
The only laughs at the CoHo
seemed to come from a handful of
students playing an "Electoral Col
lege" drinking game. One electoral
vote was equivalent to half an ounce
of beer. Beer pitchers and blue and
red plastic cups were scattered
around a table that was covered by a
large map of America.
Every time CNN projected that
Bush won a state, participants on
"Team Bush" drank the requisite
ounces of beer and colored the
state red. "Team Kerry" took down
just over two bottles of beer when
Kerry won California's 55 electoral
votes.
Although most participants said
they were displeased by how many
states were turning red. they were at
least happy that the race was close
enough to keep the game going.
"This is as participatory as 1 can
be in the American voting process,"
joked graduate student Jeff Shragge,
a Canadian citizen.
Steffi Dippold. another interna
tional graduate student, was not in a
laughing mood as results came in.
"We're shocked and disgusted
with the results," she said. "Now I've
seen the real face of America and
I'm thinking about leaving the coun
try."
According to the International
Herald Tribune. 74 percent of peo
ple from Dippold's home country of
Germany said they would vote for
Kerry.
At least one student at the CoHo
did not share Dippold's disappoint
ment with the results.
"I'm pleasantly surprised with the
results, but I think I'm the only
Bush-supporter in here." said senior
and former editor of the Stanford
Review Stephen Cohen.
"I voted for Bush because I'm a
long-time conservative and he will
lead the most effective war against
terrorism." Cohen said. "But I don't
think Bush is a strong enough leader
to pull the parties together after the
election. I think the country will re
main at a 50-50 split.
Resentment for Bush will likely
become more deep-seated be
cause Democrats won't even be

able to claim the popular vote this
time.
As newscasters began to lean to
ward Bush but maintained that there
would not be a clear victor tonight,
freshman Patrick Harazin. a mem
ber of Stanford Democrats who was
sporting a "Beat Bush" t-shirt, said,
"If it's another two weeks I'll just
have to worry about it for all that
time."
"It would be helpful for both par
ties to have this resolved as early as
possible," said Cohen. "Both parties
want to win. but we can at least be
civil about it."
Uncertainty at the Gruduatc
Community Center
Graduate students who gathered
in the Graduate Community Center
remained on edge as they watched
the latest exit poll results shortly
after 8 p.m.
As Bush maintained a razor-thin
lead in the electoral college, Giri
Shivaram, a medical student and
Kerry supporter, sat nervously in
front of the television as CNN an
nounced its latest projections.
"I am definitely feeling uneasy
right now," Shivaram said. "I am
definitely worried because states
like Florida and Ohio are tipping to
ward Bush, and I dislike him more
than any other incumbent president
in recent memory."
Mark Golkowski, a doctoral can
didate in Electrical Engineering, be
lieved that the closeness of the race
was forcing television news re
porters to be cautious before an
nouncing their state by state projec
tions for the presidential race.
"I think a lot of networks learned
to be more careful after the confu
sion of the 2000 election," Golkows
ki said. "Either way it goes, this elec
tion means a lot to a lot of people
with divisive issues like the war, and
I think the media realize that."
Many Kerry supporters like
Sapna Cheryan, a doctoral candi
date in psychology, maintained an
optimistic outlook despite their ner
vousness.
"Even though the early results
are showing Bush in the lead, this
night is far from over and I feel like
Kerry definitely has a shot," Sapna

added.
Other students like Golkowski
projected that Bush would be re
elected.
"Even after Kerry was strong in
the debates, he was slightly behind
Bush in a lot of polls," Golkowski
said. "Because of this, I believed and
still believe that Bush has the edge
over Kerry in this election."
Outrage sit Ujamaa
Over 50 students packed into
Ujamaa's lounge to await the results
of the presidential election. Most
students openly pulled for Kerry and
feared Bush's possible re-election. A
Washington Post exit poll reported
that l )() percent of African Ameri
cans nationwide voted for Kerry.
The crowd erupted in applause
and cheers when Kerry gained a
state, and was visibly upset when
Bush victories were announced.
"Bush has no scruples," one stu
dent yelled when CNN projected
that Florida would go in the presi
dent's favor. When CNN commenta
tor Larry King asked whether Bush
can hring the country back together
if re-elected, the room erupted with
shouts of "no."
"1 have a feeling this is the first
day of the end; I feel like this is the
end," one student remarked as an
other swing state turned red.
Near the end of the night, stu
dents said that they were placing all
of their hopes on Ohio, a state that
CNN described as "the new Flori
da."
Mixed Reactions at the Polls
Some voters at the polls on cam
pus expressed concern about poten
tial problems with ballot tampering
similar to those faced by Florida in
the last presidential election.
Freshman Alex Williamson was
wary of the touch screen machines at
the Florence Moore Hall polling
center.
"There's no way I would have
voted electronically." he said. "I had
the option of voting with the security
of the absentee ballot, so I took it."
Williamson added, however, that
he would have been less concerned
about ballot tampering in California

than he would have been in a swing
state, such as Hawaii.
Unlike Williamson, senior Jason
Fuentes said he was very comfort
able with electronic voting. "My
polling experience was quick and
easy," Fuentes said after voting at
Florence Moore's touch screen ma
chines.
"The touch screens were awe
some. You just push the buttons, it
records your vote, and you can change
any mistakes you make," he said.
A Texas native, Fuentes regis
tered in California to avoid what he
considered the hassle of an absentee
ballot.
Several Stanford students said
they experienced difficulty voting
with absentee ballots. Senior Neal
Harris received his ballot only a few
days before the election and had to
send it express mail at a cost of about
$14 so that it would make it back on
time to be counted. Other students
simply did not receive their absentee
ballots in time to vote.
Junior Brian Chang from Davis,
C'alif., chose to vote with an absentee
ballot in order to vote for local mea

sures. "I know the presidential vote
doesn't count much here in Califor
nia. but it's important to vote for
local measures, such as Proposition
71." he said.
Chang, however, did not dis
count the importance of the presi
dential election. "This election will
determine the fate of the United
States not just for the next four
years, but for generations to come,"
he said.
Many students questioned after
voting at El Centro said that the
most prominent issue of the election
was America's foreign policy to
wards Iraq.
"Our foreign policy will influence
how the rest of the world views us,
and although I agree with President
Bush on many areas, he has an in
ability to properly execute policy,"
said sixth year co-term David
Myszewski.
Senior Kiazi Malonga said that
America's involvement in Iraq
would heavily influence the vote be
cause many people would hesitate to
switch leaders in the middle of a con
flict. The situation in Iraq, however.

was not the only issue on people's
minds.
University staff member Rosa
Gonzalez said she voted for Kerry
mainly because of his stand on abor
tion and stem-cell research. Gonza
les also said that this election will
have huge implications because of
the likelihood of two Supreme Court
justices stepping down.
Freshman Brenda Barajas, how
ever, said that she disliked both can
didates and voted for Kerry simply
because he was"the lesser of two
evils."
Second year graduate student
Mike Wiser expressed his dislike for
the two main parties by voting for
Michael Badnarik. the libertarian
candidate.
"I disagree with both parties and
since California is not a swing state I
did not feel obligated to choose one
or the other," he said.

A Texas native, Fuentes regis

Several Stanford students said
they experienced difficulty voting
with absentee ballots. Senior Neal
Harris received his ballot only a few
days before the election and had to
send it express mail at a cost of about
$14 so that it would make it back on
time to be counted. Other students
simply did not receive their absentee
ballots in time to vote.
Junior Brian Chang from Davis,
C'alif., chose to vote with an absentee
ballot in order to vote for local mea

sures. "I know the presidential vote
doesn't count much here in Califor

local measures, such as Proposition
71." he said.
Chang, however, did not dis
count the importance of the presi
dential election. "This election will
determine the fate of the United
States not just for the next four
years, but for generations to come,"
he said.
Many students questioned after
voting at El Centro said that the
most prominent issue of the election
was America's foreign policy to
wards Iraq.
"Our foreign policy will influence
how the rest of the world views us,
and although I agree with President
Bush on many areas, he has an in
ability to properly execute policy,"
said sixth year co-term David

was not the only issue on people's
minds.
University staff member Rosa
Gonzalez said she voted for Kerry
mainly because of his stand on abor
tion and stem-cell research. Gonza

have huge implications because of
the likelihood of two Supreme Court
justices stepping down.
Freshman Brenda Barajas, how

The only laughs at the CoHo
seemed to come from a handful of
students playing an "Electoral Col

vote was equivalent to half an ounce
of beer. Beer pitchers and blue and
red plastic cups were scattered
around a table that was covered by a
large map of America.
Every time CNN projected that
Bush won a state, participants on
"Team Bush" drank the requisite
ounces of beer and colored the
state red. "Team Kerry" took down
just over two bottles of beer when
Kerry won California's 55 electoral
votes.
Although most participants said
they were displeased by how many
states were turning red. they were at
least happy that the race was close
enough to keep the game going.
"This is as participatory as 1 can
be in the American voting process,"
joked graduate student Jeff Shragge,
a Canadian citizen.
Steffi Dippold. another interna

laughing mood as results came in.
"We're shocked and disgusted
with the results," she said. "Now I've
seen the real face of America and
I'm thinking about leaving the coun

According to the International
Herald Tribune. 74 percent of peo

Germany said they would vote for
Kerry.
At least one student at the CoHo
did not share Dippold's disappoint
ment with the results.
"I'm pleasantly surprised with the
results, but I think I'm the only
Bush-supporter in here." said senior
and former editor of the Stanford

"I voted for Bush because I'm a

to pull the parties together after the

Resentment for Bush will likely

As newscasters began to lean to

freshman Patrick Harazin. a mem

sporting a "Beat Bush" t-shirt, said,
"If it's another two weeks I'll just

"It would be helpful for both par

Uncertainty at the Gruduatc
Community Center
Graduate students who gathered
in the Graduate Community Center
remained on edge as they watched
the latest exit poll results shortly
after 8 p.m.
As Bush maintained a razor-thin
lead in the electoral college, Giri
Shivaram, a medical student and
Kerry supporter, sat nervously in
front of the television as CNN an
nounced its latest projections.
"I am definitely feeling uneasy
right now," Shivaram said. "I am
definitely worried because states
like Florida and Ohio are tipping to
ward Bush, and I dislike him more
than any other incumbent president
in recent memory."
Mark Golkowski, a doctoral can
didate in Electrical Engineering, be
lieved that the closeness of the race
was forcing television news re
porters to be cautious before an
nouncing their state by state projec
tions for the presidential race.
"I think a lot of networks learned
to be more careful after the confu
sion of the 2000 election," Golkows
ki said. "Either way it goes, this elec
tion means a lot to a lot of people
with divisive issues like the war, and
I think the media realize that."
Many Kerry supporters like
Sapna Cheryan, a doctoral candi

optimistic outlook despite their ner
vousness.
"Even though the early results
are showing Bush in the lead, this
night is far from over and I feel like
Kerry definitely has a shot," Sapna

added.
Other students like Golkowski
projected that Bush would be re
elected.
"Even after Kerry was strong in
the debates, he was slightly behind
Bush in a lot of polls," Golkowski
said. "Because of this, I believed and
still believe that Bush has the edge
over Kerry in this election."
Outrage sit Ujamaa
Over 50 students packed into
Ujamaa's lounge to await the results
of the presidential election. Most
students openly pulled for Kerry and
feared Bush's possible re-election. A
Washington Post exit poll reported
that l )() percent of African Ameri
cans nationwide voted for Kerry.
The crowd erupted in applause
and cheers when Kerry gained a
state, and was visibly upset when
Bush victories were announced.
"Bush has no scruples," one stu
dent yelled when CNN projected
that Florida would go in the presi
dent's favor. When CNN commenta
tor Larry King asked whether Bush
can hring the country back together
if re-elected, the room erupted with
shouts of "no."
"1 have a feeling this is the first
day of the end; I feel like this is the
end," one student remarked as an
other swing state turned red.
Near the end of the night, stu
dents said that they were placing all
of their hopes on Ohio, a state that
CNN described as "the new Flori
da."
Mixed Reactions at the Polls
Some voters at the polls on cam
pus expressed concern about poten
tial problems with ballot tampering
similar to those faced by Florida in
the last presidential election.
Freshman Alex Williamson was
wary of the touch screen machines at
the Florence Moore Hall polling
center.
"There's no way I would have
voted electronically." he said. "I had
the option of voting with the security
of the absentee ballot, so I took it."
Williamson added, however, that
he would have been less concerned
about ballot tampering in California

than he would have been in a swing
state, such as Hawaii.
Unlike Williamson, senior Jason

Mark Golkowski, a doctoral can

"I think a lot of networks learned

Many Kerry supporters like

optimistic outlook despite their ner

"Even though the early results

added.
Other students like Golkowski
projected that Bush would be re
elected.
"Even after Kerry was strong in
the debates, he was slightly behind
Bush in a lot of polls," Golkowski
said. "Because of this, I believed and
still believe that Bush has the edge
over Kerry in this election."
Outrage sit Ujamaa
Over 50 students packed into
Ujamaa's lounge to await the results
of the presidential election. Most
students openly pulled for Kerry and
feared Bush's possible re-election. A
Washington Post exit poll reported
that l )() percent of African Ameri
cans nationwide voted for Kerry.
The crowd erupted in applause
and cheers when Kerry gained a
state, and was visibly upset when
Bush victories were announced.
"Bush has no scruples," one stu
dent yelled when CNN projected
that Florida would go in the presi
dent's favor. When CNN commenta
tor Larry King asked whether Bush
can hring the country back together
if re-elected, the room erupted with
shouts of "no."
"1 have a feeling this is the first
day of the end; I feel like this is the
end," one student remarked as an
other swing state turned red.
Near the end of the night, stu
dents said that they were placing all
of their hopes on Ohio, a state that
CNN described as "the new Flori
da."
Mixed Reactions at the Polls
Some voters at the polls on cam
pus expressed concern about poten
tial problems with ballot tampering
similar to those faced by Florida in
the last presidential election.
Freshman Alex Williamson was
wary of the touch screen machines at
the Florence Moore Hall polling
center.
"There's no way I would have
voted electronically." he said. "I had
the option of voting with the security
of the absentee ballot, so I took it."
Williamson added, however, that
he would have been less concerned
about ballot tampering in California

than he would have been in a swing
state, such as Hawaii.
Unlike Williamson, senior Jason
Fuentes said he was very comfort
able with electronic voting. "My
polling experience was quick and
easy," Fuentes said after voting at
Florence Moore's touch screen ma
chines.
"The touch screens were awe
some. You just push the buttons, it
records your vote, and you can change
any mistakes you make," he said.
A Texas native, Fuentes regis
tered in California to avoid what he
considered the hassle of an absentee
ballot.
Several Stanford students said
they experienced difficulty voting
with absentee ballots. Senior Neal
Harris received his ballot only a few
days before the election and had to
send it express mail at a cost of about
$14 so that it would make it back on
time to be counted. Other students
simply did not receive their absentee
ballots in time to vote.
Junior Brian Chang from Davis,
C'alif., chose to vote with an absentee
ballot in order to vote for local mea

sures. "I know the presidential vote
doesn't count much here in Califor
nia. but it's important to vote for
local measures, such as Proposition
71." he said.
Chang, however, did not dis
count the importance of the presi
dential election. "This election will
determine the fate of the United
States not just for the next four
years, but for generations to come,"
he said.
Many students questioned after
voting at El Centro said that the
most prominent issue of the election
was America's foreign policy to
wards Iraq.
"Our foreign policy will influence
how the rest of the world views us,
and although I agree with President
Bush on many areas, he has an in
ability to properly execute policy,"
said sixth year co-term David
Myszewski.
Senior Kiazi Malonga said that
America's involvement in Iraq
would heavily influence the vote be
cause many people would hesitate to
switch leaders in the middle of a con
flict. The situation in Iraq, however.

was not the only issue on people's
minds.
University staff member Rosa
Gonzalez said she voted for Kerry
mainly because of his stand on abor
tion and stem-cell research. Gonza
les also said that this election will
have huge implications because of
the likelihood of two Supreme Court
justices stepping down.
Freshman Brenda Barajas, how
ever, said that she disliked both can
didates and voted for Kerry simply
because he was"the lesser of two
evils."
Second year graduate student
Mike Wiser expressed his dislike for
the two main parties by voting for
Michael Badnarik. the libertarian
candidate.
"I disagree with both parties and
since California is not a swing state I
did not feel obligated to choose one
or the other," he said.

turnout this year; there was a contin

the day. In her eight years of over

said. "Hut at least Bush won Col
orado bv a smaller margin than he
did in the last election."
The only laughs at the CoHo
seemed to come from a handful of
students playing an "Electoral Col
lege" drinking game. One electoral
vote was equivalent to half an ounce
of beer. Beer pitchers and blue and
red plastic cups were scattered
around a table that was covered by a
large map of America.
Every time CNN projected that
Bush won a state, participants on
"Team Bush" drank the requisite
ounces of beer and colored the
state red. "Team Kerry" took down
just over two bottles of beer when
Kerry won California's 55 electoral
votes.
Although most participants said
they were displeased by how many
states were turning red. they were at
least happy that the race was close
enough to keep the game going.
"This is as participatory as 1 can
be in the American voting process,"
joked graduate student Jeff Shragge,
a Canadian citizen.
Steffi Dippold. another interna
tional graduate student, was not in a
laughing mood as results came in.
"We're shocked and disgusted
with the results," she said. "Now I've
seen the real face of America and
I'm thinking about leaving the coun
try."
According to the International
Herald Tribune. 74 percent of peo
ple from Dippold's home country of
Germany said they would vote for
Kerry.
At least one student at the CoHo
did not share Dippold's disappoint
ment with the results.
"I'm pleasantly surprised with the
results, but I think I'm the only
Bush-supporter in here." said senior
and former editor of the Stanford
Review Stephen Cohen.
"I voted for Bush because I'm a
long-time conservative and he will
lead the most effective war against
terrorism." Cohen said. "But I don't
think Bush is a strong enough leader
to pull the parties together after the
election. I think the country will re
main at a 50-50 split.
Resentment for Bush will likely
become more deep-seated be
cause Democrats won't even be

able to claim the popular vote this
time.
As newscasters began to lean to
ward Bush but maintained that there
would not be a clear victor tonight,
freshman Patrick Harazin. a mem
ber of Stanford Democrats who was
sporting a "Beat Bush" t-shirt, said,
"If it's another two weeks I'll just
have to worry about it for all that
time."
"It would be helpful for both par
ties to have this resolved as early as
possible," said Cohen. "Both parties
want to win. but we can at least be
civil about it."
Uncertainty at the Gruduatc
Community Center
Graduate students who gathered
in the Graduate Community Center
remained on edge as they watched
the latest exit poll results shortly
after 8 p.m.
As Bush maintained a razor-thin
lead in the electoral college, Giri
Shivaram, a medical student and
Kerry supporter, sat nervously in
front of the television as CNN an
nounced its latest projections.
"I am definitely feeling uneasy
right now," Shivaram said. "I am
definitely worried because states
like Florida and Ohio are tipping to
ward Bush, and I dislike him more
than any other incumbent president
in recent memory."
