### 
1988 — On Nov. 3, 1988, The Daily
ran an article on Hillel being targeted
with anti-Semitic fliers.

"An anti-Semitic flier appeared
on campus this week and has left
members shocked and upset, ac
cording to Hillel officials.
The flier, which attacks Holo
caust studies,' was slipped under the
office door of the Hillel Foundation
two nights ago. A few other copies
were distributed on campus.
Jocelyn Reisman. the program
director at Hillel, was •disgusted'
when she found the flier. People
here are pretty angry,' she said.
The fliers were published by the
German-American National Politi
cal Action Committee, a Washing
ton-based group that says its aim is
to stop prejudice against German-
Americans because of the Holo
caust.
The group supports legislation
that would require universities to ac
cept students according to strict
racial, ethnic and religious quotas.
The committee does not have an
office in the area, and its chair, Hans
Schmidt, told The Daily yesterday
that he doesn't know who distrib
uted the fliers. 'Even if I did. I would
not say,' he said."
1992 —On Nov. 3, 1992, The Daily
ran a story on Clinton holding a lead
in Ivy League schools.
"With one day left in the race for
the White House, Gov. Bill Clinton

may have to worry about voter sup
port in the South and Midwest. But
among students at America's top
universities, the Democratic nomi
nee can rest easy.
Similar to the results at Stanford,
65 percent of students at Ivy League
colleges and universities express
strong support for Clinton, accord
ing to polls conducted by individual
campus newspapers. President Bush
received the backing of 17 percent of
student voters and independent can
didate Ross Perot netted 7 percent.
Eleven percent said they were unde
cided or planned to vote for another
candidate.
Support for Clinton at individual
schools ranged from 79 percent at
traditionally liberal Brown to 51 per
cent at the University of Pennsylva
nia. Seventy-four percent of stu
dents at Harvard, 73 percent of those
at Yale, 64 percent at Princeton and
Columbia as well as 63 percent at
Dartmouth said they support the
Arkansas governor.
The president's support ranged
from 24 percent at Princeton to 9
percent at Brown.
In addition, the respondents said
that the job market, abortion, educa
tion and health care were the most
important issues influencing their
votes.
Senate hopeful Barbara Boxer
also received strong support from
USC students, with more than 60
percent supporting each candidate."
