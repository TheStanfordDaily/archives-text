In commemoration of Abdu'l-Baha
Saturday, November 6, 2004

Memorial Church
Featured musicians Talisman, Kelsey Bulkin and more....
Cosponsored by the Baha'i Association
and the Hindu Students Council
Abdu'l-Baha is a central figure in the Baha'i Faith who
came to speak at Stanford in 1912 bringing a message of
world peace, the oneness of humanity, and a vision of
how the development of the sciences and arts can bring
about the upliftment of humanity.
When a thought of war comes, oppose it by a
stronger thought of peace. A thought of hatred must
be destroyed by a more powerful thought of love.
