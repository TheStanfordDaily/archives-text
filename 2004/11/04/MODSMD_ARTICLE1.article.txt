# Calif, voters get tough on crime

### ALIYYA HAQUE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Among the 15 propositions on
this year's ballot, Californians
voted against Proposition 72,
which would extend health care
coverage requirements, and
Proposition 66, which would re
form California's "Three Strikes"
law, hut they passed Proposition
69. which requires DNA testing
for all felons and other arrested
individuals.
Opposed by various state dis
trict attorneys and Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Prop. 66 failed
with approximately 53 percent of
voters deciding against it.
Prop. 66 would have placed
limitations on the"three strikes"
law, which requires that a crimi
nal with two prior serious or vio
lent felony convictions receive a
25-year-to-life sentence if con
victed of any additional felony,
even a non-violent one. The
proposition would have amended
the law to require the longer sen
tence for the offender only if the
third offense were also fora vio
lent or serious felony.
Several Stanford students in
favor of the proposition were
disappointed with Tuesday's
outcome.
"The three strikes law favors
deterrence over just punishment
by threatening harsh punish
ments for recidivists, even if they
commit a petty or non-violent

crime," said sophomore Olivia
Sohns. "Prop. 66 would have re
formed this law so that the pun
ishment better fits the crime."
First-year graduate student
Uchenna Okoye also supported
Proposition 66 because of the
harsh penalties ascribed to the
"third strike" aspect of the law.
"1 don't think it's a good idea to
automatically lock someone away
forever if the third offense isn't a
major felony," Okoye said. "Cali
fornia is spending millions of dol
lars in keeping petty criminals in
jail that would best be spent on
other resources like education."
Prop. 72 also failed by a close
margin, approximately 51 to 49
percent.
It would have required that
large employers pay at least 80
percent of insurance coverage
costs, with a 20 percent maximum
employee contribution.
Dr. Hal Holman, professor of
immunology and rheumatology
at the School of Medicine, was in
favor of the proposition for its
move in the direction of establish
ing equity for all working people.
"As the health care crisis has
grown, the benefits that people
receive from their employers and
the health care system are being
reduced," Holman said. "This
process would have been ob
structed by Prop. 72. which pro
vides a tloor under which health
