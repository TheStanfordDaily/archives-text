# Stomach cramps? Poor digestion? It may be your midterms

Students around campus agreed that when placed under
stress, they tend to feel more discomfort and stomach pain.
"My stomach ties up in knots when I get nervous before a
midterm,"said junior Allen Huang. "That happened a lot early
on, especially freshman year. But I've just learned to relax more
and let my mojo flow."
Junior Chethana Kulkarni said she could see some of the rea
sons why Stanford students would be more likely to suffer from
abdominal pain
"I think a lot of Stanford students get so wrapped up in
studying for midterms and working on projects that they don't
take good care of themselves, [and they don't] eat right,"
Kulkarni said. "As a result, they end up with stomach prob
lems because of lack of nutrition."
Indeed, poor nutrition may be the key problem. According to
Gerson. students tend to change eating and sleeping patterns
during stressful periods. People try to stay awake by taking in
more caffeine, but drinks and foods such as coffee, tea, citrus
fruits, and fatty and spicy foods have the ability to upset the
stomach. During pressure-filled times, students should try to
avoid changing their eating behaviors and sleeping patterns, ac
cording to gastroenterology experts.
But are stomach problems always associated with stress?
No, said Dr. Anson Lowe, associate professor of gastroen
terology at the School of Medicine.
"Abdominal pain does not mean stress," Lowe said. Stom
achaches are like headaches. They are a common problem
without a specific cause, he added.
In fact, some doctors believe that limited amounts of stress
might even be a good thing.
"There is a good kind of stress," Gerson said. "Stress can be
healthy. When stress impedes performance, that's the level
where help is necessary."
Students who have suffered stomach cramps since they were
teenagers or athletes who always suffer from stomachaches be
fore a big game might be able to say they are stressed in an un
healthy way, Lowe explained, and they are the ones who should
seek help if the problem grows out of control
However, some stress is part of everyday life — it is impossi
ble to avoid, especially at Stanford. The key is to find ways to deal
with stress positively and minimize it when possible.

Midterms. I-Hum papers. Late Night fries. Coffee. Red Bull.
Stomachaches — all part of the busy lifestyle of your average
Stanford student. But wait: How did stomach problems end up
in the mix?
With the quarter going full steam ahead, work is piling up.
Students can be found in the cozy cubicles at Green Library until
the clock strikes midnight, or in the 24-hour study room at Meyer
Library during the wee hours of the morning. More can be found
downing caffeine at the Stern Cyber Cafe or Roble Late Night,
desperately trying to muster the energy to cram in four more
hours of reading.
Yet amid the frantic studying, others can be seen lying in their
dorms or at the Vaden Student Health Clinic, complaining of
stomach cramps and abdominal pain.
Stress is often related to poor digestion and stomach pains,
which may suggest that the onset of stress could bring about irri
table bowel syndrome, referred to by doctors as IBS.
IBS is a disorder that affects the large intestine's ability to
function. The large intestine normally contracts at regular inter
vals to push food through the digestive system. In people with
IBS, the contractions become spastic, leading to pain and irregu
lar digestion.
IBS is most commonly found among those around age 20, and
— for unknown reasons — is seen more commonly in women
than in men.
People suffering from IBS most often complain of abdominal
pain, bloating, constipation, cramps and diarrhea. The discom
fort may last days, weeks or months. People suffering from IBS
are more sensitive than others to alcohol, caffeine, medicines,
large meals and stress.
While Stanford students are known to be overachievers, often
taking more than 20 units and joining one too many student or
ganizations, there is no strong evidence that Stanford students
are more susceptible to IBS and other stomach disorders be
cause of stress. According to Dr. Lauren Gerson, assistant pro
fessor of gastroenterology at the school of medicine, students are
not necessarily seen more frequently in her clinic during
midterms and finals, but she said she does find that students
complain about stomach uneasiness during time of high stress.

Stressed to the max?
Students share their favorite ways to relax
Although they may be seen tossing around frisbees and fountain-hopping around with a deceptively carefree attitude. Stan
ford students are stressballs. Here are a few things students do to de-stress those crazy times wnen that midterm is due in less
than 2 hours and you still have not taken out the textbook out of its shrink-wrap:
"During the time of the quarter when I have multiple exams and several papers due, I usually find some way to
spend some time outside and enjoy our beautiful campus. Anything that gets me away from my computer is a good
way to relax.
— Laura McLendon, co-term
"I like to head out fora run when I am stressed. My favorite run around campus? The Dish loop."
— Setb Silverman, freshman
"When I have a stressful week ahead of me, I usually pick out one night where I can go to bed early. There's nothing like get
ting enough sleep to get you through the week."
— Angela Almeyda, first-year doctoral candidate
