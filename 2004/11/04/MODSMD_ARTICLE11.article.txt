## Intravenous nutrition software at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital reduces number of medical errors 
### TINA HAN 
According to the National Academy of Sci
ences' Institute of Medicine, there are up to
100,000 medical-error deaths each year, with
infant patients in the neonatal intensive care
unit being three times more vulnerable than
adult patients.
Given that nutrition is of utmost impor
tance in the first critical days of life, one com
pany decided that perhaps technology could
help in minimizing these costly — and often
fatal — human errors by letting computers
streamline the complicated process of creating
intravenous solutions for premature babies.
The software company, Monterey Medical
Solutions, has been working with the Lucile

Packard Children's
Hospital at Stanford
to provide optimal nu
tritional care to pre
mature and low-birth
weight babies through
the use of its innova
tive software, TPN
Medsoft.
The company was
cofounded by Mark
Yelderman, the cur
rent CEO, and Nick
Mackenzie, the chief
technical officer —
both Stanford alumni.
TPN Medsoft soft
ware provides general
guidelines to comple
ment the Total Par
enteral Nutrition ther
apy that supplies in
fants intravenously
with essential nutri-

ents like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins
and other needed supplements.
Intravenous nutritional therapy is an in
tricate and error-prone system because it re
quires laborious attention to the details of in
fant nutrition. The software aids in cutting
down mistakes. By automating the process
ing of physicians' prescriptions to create
easy-to-follow instructions for pharmacists,
the TPN Medsoft software makes a poten
tially dangerous procedure reliable and safe
to implement.
To catch possible errors, the software noti
fies the doctor if there are variations between
the actual amount given to a patient and the
amount listed in standard nutritional protocols.
The software was first utilized in the neona
tal intensive care unit at the Children's Hospi
tal. Doctors used it to regulate the levels of nu
trients that premature babies receive. TPN
therapy is also responsible for supplying cor
rect amounts of sophisticated drugs that some
infants may need during critical times. For ex
ample, drugs to modulate bone marrow pro
duction treatments are administered through
this method.
Now used for treating both children and
adults undergoing cancer treatment, TPN
therapy has widened its spectrum since its
original conception. Certain cancers and the

JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily

chemotherapy needed to treat them lead to a
range of intestinal problems which would re
quire the use of intravenous feedings TPN
therapy can provide. TPN has also been used
for infants who are unable to breastfeed, chil
dren who cannot orally ingest food and adults
who are unable eat normally.
Since TPN therapy can be used to treat a
variety of patients with a multitude of require
ments, TPN software accommodates this pro
cess by focusing on each patient's individual
needs. The software takes into account the
physiological composition of each distinct pa
tient — including specific nutritional require
ments — and will formulate an intravenous
solution according to that information.
All of these safeguards have been built

into the TPN soft
ware to prevent med
ical errors. Accord
ing to Yelderman,
the company that de
veloped the software,
the TPN software is
very effective in cost
ly medical mistakes.
"At Lucille
Packard, there has
been an 80 percent re
duction, in medication
errors and the TPN
software is definitely a
contributing factor,"
Yelderman said.
With medical er
rors being one of the
top 10 leading causes of
death in America, it is
one of the most contro
versial topics in health
care today, reducing

errors is an important priority at hospitals.
The software has greatly affected the
healthcare system by facilitating the process of
nutritional regulation for patients.
The software, for all its benefits, is not dif
ficult to understand and is easy for nurses and
doctors to learn. The people who are using the
software are doctors, nurses and pharmacists
who have had extensive training in nutrition
and know the specific nutritional needs of
their patients. According to Yelderman, it
would probably take only several hours to
teach someone how to use the software.
Monterey Medical Solutions, inspired by
the success of the implementation of the soft
ware at the Children's Hospital, has decided to
commercialize the software for use in other
hospitals. The Children's Hospital in Oakland
has recently started using the TPN software.
In a press release, Robert Poole, director
of pharmacy at the Children's Hospital ac
credited the TPN software with the capabili
ties of ensuring a much safer treatment plan
for infants as well as adults who need TPN
therapy. Poole also noted that even though
most hospitals know to follow strict guide
lines, many do not.
"It is with software tools like TPN Med-
Soft," Poole said "that we can make TPN ther
apy truly safe for the first time."

tient — including specific nutritional require
ments — and will formulate an intravenous
solution according to that information.
All of these safeguards have been built

into the TPN soft
ware to prevent med
ical errors. Accord
ing to Yelderman,
the company that de
veloped the software,
the TPN software is
very effective in cost
ly medical mistakes.
"At Lucille
Packard, there has
been an 80 percent re
duction, in medication
errors and the TPN
software is definitely a
contributing factor,"
Yelderman said.
With medical er
rors being one of the
top 10 leading causes of
death in America, it is
one of the most contro
versial topics in health
care today, reducing

errors is an important priority at hospitals.
The software has greatly affected the
healthcare system by facilitating the process of
nutritional regulation for patients.
The software, for all its benefits, is not dif
ficult to understand and is easy for nurses and
doctors to learn. The people who are using the
software are doctors, nurses and pharmacists
who have had extensive training in nutrition
and know the specific nutritional needs of
their patients. According to Yelderman, it
would probably take only several hours to
teach someone how to use the software.
Monterey Medical Solutions, inspired by
the success of the implementation of the soft
ware at the Children's Hospital, has decided to
commercialize the software for use in other
hospitals. The Children's Hospital in Oakland
has recently started using the TPN software.
In a press release, Robert Poole, director
of pharmacy at the Children's Hospital ac
credited the TPN software with the capabili
ties of ensuring a much safer treatment plan
for infants as well as adults who need TPN
therapy. Poole also noted that even though
most hospitals know to follow strict guide
lines, many do not.
"It is with software tools like TPN Med-
Soft," Poole said "that we can make TPN ther
apy truly safe for the first time."

According to the National Academy of Sci
ences' Institute of Medicine, there are up to
100,000 medical-error deaths each year, with
infant patients in the neonatal intensive care
unit being three times more vulnerable than
adult patients.
Given that nutrition is of utmost impor
tance in the first critical days of life, one com
pany decided that perhaps technology could
help in minimizing these costly — and often
fatal — human errors by letting computers
streamline the complicated process of creating
intravenous solutions for premature babies.
The software company, Monterey Medical
Solutions, has been working with the Lucile

Packard Children's
Hospital at Stanford
to provide optimal nu
tritional care to pre
mature and low-birth
weight babies through
the use of its innova
tive software, TPN
Medsoft.
The company was
cofounded by Mark
Yelderman, the cur
rent CEO, and Nick
Mackenzie, the chief
technical officer —
both Stanford alumni.
TPN Medsoft soft
ware provides general
guidelines to comple
ment the Total Par
enteral Nutrition ther
apy that supplies in
fants intravenously
with essential nutri-

ents like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins
and other needed supplements.
Intravenous nutritional therapy is an in
tricate and error-prone system because it re
quires laborious attention to the details of in
fant nutrition. The software aids in cutting
down mistakes. By automating the process
ing of physicians' prescriptions to create
easy-to-follow instructions for pharmacists,
the TPN Medsoft software makes a poten
tially dangerous procedure reliable and safe
to implement.
To catch possible errors, the software noti
fies the doctor if there are variations between
the actual amount given to a patient and the
amount listed in standard nutritional protocols.
The software was first utilized in the neona
tal intensive care unit at the Children's Hospi
tal. Doctors used it to regulate the levels of nu
trients that premature babies receive. TPN
therapy is also responsible for supplying cor
rect amounts of sophisticated drugs that some
infants may need during critical times. For ex
ample, drugs to modulate bone marrow pro
duction treatments are administered through
this method.
Now used for treating both children and
adults undergoing cancer treatment, TPN
therapy has widened its spectrum since its
original conception. Certain cancers and the

chemotherapy needed to treat them lead to a
range of intestinal problems which would re
quire the use of intravenous feedings TPN
therapy can provide. TPN has also been used
for infants who are unable to breastfeed, chil
dren who cannot orally ingest food and adults
who are unable eat normally.
Since TPN therapy can be used to treat a
variety of patients with a multitude of require
ments, TPN software accommodates this pro
cess by focusing on each patient's individual
needs. The software takes into account the
physiological composition of each distinct pa
tient — including specific nutritional require
ments — and will formulate an intravenous
solution according to that information.
All of these safeguards have been built

into the TPN soft
