## Don't let Darfur become another Rwanda 
### LAUREN GONG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
While the media generally tend to con
centrate on political problems in the Middle
East and in Iraq, we must not forget that
there are other countries with significant
conflicts — and corresponding health
emergencies.
One such example is the civil war in
Sudan. Over 1.8 million people have been
affected by the conflict in Darfur — a war
that has resulted in the unnecessary death
and persecution of millions of civilians.
Both Republicans and Democrats have rec
ognized the severity of the situation, pledg
ing to not let it become another Rwanda.
Darfur, located in the western region of
Sudan, is the site of conflict between the cur
rent Sudanese government — located in
Sudan's biggest city, Khartoum — and two
rebel movements, the Sudanese Liberation
Army and the Justice and Equality move
ment.
Violence in Darfur dates back to Febru
ary of last year; the situation escalated when
the armed tribal militias began organized vi
olence against civilians. The people of Dar
fur have been forced to flee their villages and
suffer through horrific campaigns of vio
lence and endless persecution.
Although politicians have promised ac
tion. disappointingly, the international re

sponse to this crisis has been lacking. The
International Crisis Group calls the global
response to Darfur "limp and inadequate."
Aside from a few humanitarian organi-

zations such as Doctors
Without Borders or The
United Nations Chil
dren's Fund providing
some aid in the form of
basic healthcare services
and food supplements,
there has been little inter
national involvement.
In a study conducted
by Doctors Without Bor
ders in the Wade Saleh
district of West Darfur,
60 percent of deaths of
people over five years of
age were due to violence,
and this number is even
higher for the 18-to-49
group, at a frightening 78
percent.
People living in areas
of conflict have to deal
with more than just the
mounting death toll.

In Darfur, the second leading cause of
death among children is malnutrition, su
perceded only to diahrreal diseases. And ac
cording to the United Nations, only 49 per
cent of the food needs in Darfur are cur

rently covered. Thousands more children
are dying of completely preventable dis
eases because of the conflict. In a statistic
produced by UNICEF, the death toll in

Darfur is up to 10 times higher than in the
rest of the Sudanese population. Mortality
rates surpass the numbers humanitarian or
ganizations label as "areas of crisis."
Overcrowding in camps for displaced

people, lack of clean water, and inadequate
sanitation facilities are grave threats to the
health of the Darfur people, specifically
women and children. Without homes, these

people live in small,
tarpaulin-covered huts
and are susceptible to
fever, respiratory dis
eases and injuries due to
violence.
Women in displaced
populations are especial
ly vulnerable to sexual
assault: They are more
likely to be sexually as
saulted when they are
away from their homes.
In August and Septem
ber of this year. Doctors
Without Borders treated
12 raped women in Dar
fur, some as young as 12
and 13 years of age. The
majority of these women
had been harshly beaten.
The situation is frus
trating, but just because
we are far away does not

mean there is nothing we can do to help.
Doctors Without Borders has made a great
effort to aid this crisis in Sudan. Their Web
site is comprehensive, listing articles and
photo essays documenting the situation in

Darfur and offering advice on what we can
do to help the situation while stuck at home.
In July, the organization shipped over
1,400 tons of supplies to the Darfur region.
They are now working with an international
staff of over 160 in 24 different locations
throughout the Sudanese region. They also
employ over 2,000 Sudanese and are able to
reach around 550,000 people in the country.
Other activist groups such as Amnesty
International have taken it upon themselves
to bring Darfur to the forefront of public
news. Just a few days ago, I received an e
mail from the Amnesty International stu
dent group on campus that said they were
organizing a meeting to educate the campus
community on the situation in Sudan. The
group's list of plans includes ideas such as a
speaker series, a fundraiser for Doctors
Without Borders and letter writing to
prominent politicians.
The crisis in Darfur will not be addressed
adequately until people take action. The
lives of millions of people in this troubled
region could be changed by students getting
involved in this issue and putting pressure
on the international community. Do your
part, and take this opportunity to get in
volved.
