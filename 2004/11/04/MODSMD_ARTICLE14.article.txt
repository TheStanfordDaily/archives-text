## Editorial Extend noise curfew until 2 a.m. 
### 
Stanford has a noise curfew of 1 a.m. on week
ends. The policy is too stringent fora Uni
versity where many students would like to
stay out for longer hours.
Parties thrown by fraternities. Row houses and
dorms are important social outlets for students to
meet and chill outside of classes or extracurricular
activities.
In particular, for freshmen who might not know
many students outside of their dorms, parties are
an important way to make new friends and social
ize in a more casual environment.
It is disappointing that these parties must end at I
a.m. when they often have only begun at 10 p.m.
And typically it is difficult for students to even
enter parties until well after they have started, as
throngs of students crowd into the few parties that
are thrown on campus every weekend.
By extending parties until 2 a.m., more students
would have the opportunity to go out to parties
without the concern that they might end up spend
ing more time waiting in line outside than actually
in the party itself.
Part of the reason there are so few parties on
campus to begin with is the strict requirements that
are placed on party planners by the Office of Stu
dent Activities.
Understandably, the rules for the parties are in
place to protect students from getting hurt, such as
concerns about party security and fire safety. How
ever, the noise curfew does little to protect students
from harm and could afford to be extended.

The Office of Student Activities claims the rea
son for the 1 a.m. weekend noise curfew is out of re
spect for the faculty, students and staff who are dis
turbed by the noise.
Their concerns are valid, as many faculty, staff
and graduate students have families — some with
young children — that they must look after at
night.
The OSA also noted that many of the people
who call in to the Stanford police to complain about
noise are students, not faculty or staff.
However, we believe that the desire of students
to have longer parties on weekends should out
weigh these concerns.
Those worried about noise on campus ought to
compromise to accommodate undergraduate stu
dents who want to engage in weekend night life.
After all, it is only for two nights each week.
And those living on a college campus should not
be surprised at having to deal with these sorts of in
conveniences. Those who are truly bothered by the
noise could purchase a pair of earplugs.
At a residential university where one of the
goals is to allow students a complete college expe
rience, it is important to recognize not only aca
demic excellence but social needs as well. Weekend
parties are a significant part of students' social
lives, giving them a chance to cut loose from the
classes and studying they have done during the
school week. The students would appreciate it if
the OSA would extend the noise curfew for just
one more hour each weekend night.
