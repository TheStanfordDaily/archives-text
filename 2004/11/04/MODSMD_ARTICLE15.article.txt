# The 						Good Life
## Bay Area locals are geography snobs 
### 
Like the New Yorkers who
think they're a little bit su
perior to everyone who
doesn't hail from the great
est city on earth. Bay Area natives at
Stanford occasionally show an ex
cessive degree of pride for their ori
gins.
Sometimes they reveal a smug at
titude toward the rest of America.
With more socioeconomic savvy
than the average member of the
population, perhaps they sense
they're above the masses. After all,
one can't help but feel a little sorry
for the students from Nowhere,
Neb., or Cow Town, Pa.
I never felt embarrassed by re
vealing my small-town origins to
anyone at Stanford, but during
freshman year I watched incredu
lously as a fellow freshman said,
"I'm a local from Palo Alto," and
eyed me with condescension after 1
said I was from a rural town in Vir
ginia.
I've listened to one of my friends
from San Jose tell me she feels sorry
for people from the middle of
nowhere "like Nebraska."
Of course I had to point out to
her that I m from about as Nowhere,
U.S.A. as you can get, and she
doesn't feel bad for me. At least, I
hope not.
But she has a point. The Bay
Area offers some things that the rest
of America usually doesn't have.
Mild weather year-round, Silicon
Valley jobs, Stanford, more hulking
shopping centers and parking lots
than your average suburban sprawl,
wealthy public schools, Stanford,
and (in great contrast to middle
class small towns) generously
stocked public libraries.
It's a nice place to raise a family if
you're a highly paid parent. College
students, too, can enjoy its many at
tractions. In the Bay Area, after all.
you can buy lots of stuff.
With greater purchasing power
than % percent of the population.

you can be an even more conspicu
ous consumer than most Americans.
With Trader Joe's nearby for
easy access to sulfur-free dried
mango strips. Tiffany and Co. for
newly minted investment-banking
boyfriends who snap up silver pen
dants, and the San Antonio Wal-
Mart for every student who wants to
get $2.50 cereal despite the fact that
the people wearing the blue vests
that say "Can 1 help you?" don't
speak English because they're prob
ably recent immigrants who can't
find a decent job, it's clear that the
Bay Area is markedly different —
and yet remarkably similar — to the
rest of America.
In contrast to the football-is-king
culture of Bible-Belt high schools.
Bay Area high school students like
my old roommate can talk about the
world of finance more readily than
they can recount their alma mater's
football games.
Occupying a surreal reality in
which "I-banking" and "dim sum"
are far less foreign concepts than
"Middle America," these kids share
the unique ignorance only one of the
wealthiest sectors of the population
— clumped and segregated into rep
utable public schools — can attain.
They live in a reality in which the
film "Election" can be viewed and
laughed at without a flicker of irony.
A Lynbrook High '02 grad watched
the scene in the gym and told me in
dignantly, "High schoolers don't
heckle!"
After I asked her what planet
she's from and laughed at her, I
found out that LHS is located in the
South Bay and 50 or 60 percent
Asian American — most of whom
aspire for acceptance to Stanford or
the UCs. So she was telling the truth,
because heckling high schoolers are
not the students seeking out stellar
college recommendation letters
from teachers.
Apparently the Bay Area is the
new New York City. Pretty soon the

natives will be remarking, "Well, it
is the greatest place on earth" in the
same way New Yorkers admit that
New York is the greatest city on
earth; the same way Americans pro
claim that the U.S. of A. is the great
est country on the planet. Notice the
undesirable pattern here?
As knowledgeable of pad thai,
Korean 880 and falafel as they are
ignorant of Bible Belt culture, these
two-buck Chuck aficionados can
hardly imagine living in small-town
America, the suburban Midwest or
the Deep South.
Because they probably haven't
spent time in these places, they just
don't know what they're like. Going
to college on their home turf often
just reaffirms their Bay Area-centric
world view.
While contrasting economic sta
tus can surely be found on campus,
representatives of the South and
rural America are harder to find. In
a way that makes them all the more
interesting and weird — like little
kids who actually know the Internet
hasn't always been around.
Whenever you catch a Bay Area
native take a distorted amount of
pride in his or her geographic posi
tioning, remind them that playing
football is — and will always be —
more important than getting an
M B.A and that there's nothing
wrong (or not much, anyway) with
saying your favorite restaurant is
IHOF or Red Lobster.
But seriously, you don't have to
embrace Friday Night Football to
see that you don't need to feel sorry
for people from the middle of
nowhere.
They're the ones who can tell you
about just how fascinating the rest of
non-urban. non-Californian Ameri
ca really is.
