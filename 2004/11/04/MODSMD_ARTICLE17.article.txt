# Brown and Out
## How are my breasts a threat to U.S. national security? 
### 
The first thought I had when
it happened was: "Oh
God." The second thought
I had when it happened
was: "Oh God, how the Arabs and
Muslims in this country will suffer."
I have often thought about why
these two thoughts were the first to
come to mind. The first one makes
sense, but I have always wondered
about the second.
What does it mean when, having
lived in this country my whole life.

the first concern
I thought of were
the repercus
sions 9/11
would have on
this country's mi
norities?
In the weeks
after 9/ 11 and as
the American
flags went up in
front of houses,

on the antennas of cars, on the skin
of American youth, I thought
about what was going on and found
myself unable to understand it.
I came to Stanford as a freshman
in 2001, mere weeks after the Twin
Towers went bye-bye, and I was re
ally worried about where history
was headed. I was 18 and entering a
world of complexities.
Two years later, the reality of
how changed my home was be
cause of this event came into sharp
focus when I left the country for
Mexico.
I remember being at a reception
for international students and talk
ing to a French student who asked
me if everyone was really all that
afraid of terrorists.
It scared me to answer yes, to re
alize that the national sentiment
was one of extreme fear.
How did we get so afraid?
As a daughter of an historian,
one lesson I will never be able to
unlearn is that history is the reason
we are where we are today. If you
look back at the history of this
country, you realize that it's based
on the fact that there is an "other"
to be hated and feared.
Unfortunately, there's a grow
ing population in this country that
has traditionally been considered
the "other," and it's growing real
fast.
And we are the country that was
mythologically founded by people

seeking freedom.
The pilgrims hated the Native
Americans, then the pilgrims' de
scendents hated the African slaves,
then their descendents hated the
Mexicans, then their descendents
hated the Irish and Italians, then
their descendents hated Jews, then
their descendents hated the Chi
nese and then the Japanese and
then their descendents hated the
Vietnamese and people from Cen
tral America, then they went back
to hating Mexicans.
And then Sept. 11 came around
and their descendents now hate
Arabs or Muslims or whatever
"looks" like a terrorist.
The problem with this fear now,
unfortunately, is that we really
don't know what we are afraid of,
and now we find ourselves in a time
when the administration blatantly
asks for the race of journalists be
fore it agrees to be photographed
— as in the case of The Arizona
Daily Star — yet does so in the
name of "security."
Where a white employee in an
airport searches six Latino men at
once in a "random" search. Where
a female airport employee had to
touch my breasts to make sure I
wasn't carrying anything threaten
ing to national security under there
when my underwire set off the
metal detector (believe me, there's
hardly any room).
1 guess the more things change,
the more they stay the same. What
would really help us here at home is
a little more attention to what race
means — aside from fear — in a
society that is constantly changing
demographically.
People from all walks of life —
from rich white investment bankers
to undocumented Mexican waiters
— died on Sept. 11, 2001.
We had the chance to redefine
our country as a space for every
one. But we blew it and decided to
be afraid. And fear never helped
anyone think straight.
Because after all, my little boo
bies have never hurt anyone, but if
they are a threat to national securi
ty, imagine what damage Dolly
Parton's boobies could do.

then their descendents hated the
Mexicans, then their descendents
hated the Irish and Italians, then
their descendents hated Jews, then
their descendents hated the Chi
nese and then the Japanese and
then their descendents hated the
Vietnamese and people from Cen
tral America, then they went back
to hating Mexicans.
And then Sept. 11 came around
and their descendents now hate
Arabs or Muslims or whatever
"looks" like a terrorist.
The problem with this fear now,
unfortunately, is that we really
don't know what we are afraid of,
and now we find ourselves in a time
when the administration blatantly
asks for the race of journalists be
fore it agrees to be photographed
— as in the case of The Arizona
Daily Star — yet does so in the
name of "security."
Where a white employee in an
airport searches six Latino men at
once in a "random" search. Where
a female airport employee had to
touch my breasts to make sure I
wasn't carrying anything threaten
ing to national security under there
when my underwire set off the
metal detector (believe me, there's
hardly any room).
1 guess the more things change,
the more they stay the same. What
would really help us here at home is
a little more attention to what race
means — aside from fear — in a
society that is constantly changing
demographically.
People from all walks of life —
from rich white investment bankers
to undocumented Mexican waiters
— died on Sept. 11, 2001.
We had the chance to redefine
our country as a space for every
one. But we blew it and decided to
be afraid. And fear never helped
anyone think straight.
Because after all, my little boo
bies have never hurt anyone, but if
they are a threat to national securi
ty, imagine what damage Dolly
Parton's boobies could do.
