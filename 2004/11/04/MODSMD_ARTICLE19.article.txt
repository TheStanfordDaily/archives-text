# Letter to the Editor

### 
Kerry and Stanford Democrats
stood up for their beliefs
This weekend, I was one of the
Stanford Democrats who went to
Las Vegas, Nev. to work with
America Coming Together.
I want to say with deep convic
tion that regardless of our defeat, I
am so proud to he a Democrat and
even prouder to be an American.
It was such a privilege to be
able to pour my heart into those is
sues I care about, and 1 was uplift
ed to see the droves of other pas
sionate people pouring their
hearts into Nevada, too.
And we didn't just protest or
make noise. We were on the
ground getting voters to the polls.
People from so many diverse

backgrounds came together for
change. America came together.
I would like to say a special
thanks to John Kerry, whether or
not he ever reads this. Thank you
for being our champion in this
election.
You stood up for that mill
worker's job; you stood up for ac
cessible health care; you stood up
for recognizing and addressing
our world's energy and environ
mental problems.
You stood up fora woman's
right to choose; you stood up for
education; you stood up fora
strong, responsible and intelligent
war on terror; and you stood up
for the dignity of homosexuality.
You argued with reason, with
intelligence, with love and with

true passion. You were my first
candidate, and you will always be
my hero.
We are in the right, and we can
not lose sight of our values. And
though we won't have a national
champion these next four years,
we will still fight and hold this
president responsible for protect
ing our future.
This letter may be too positive
for some still reeling. I know â€”
I'm still crying.
I just can't shake how proud 1
am of us Democrats.
We stood up.
