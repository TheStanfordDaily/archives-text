An infographic on the front page of The Daily yester
day incorrectly stated that Proposition 66 passed. With
46.6 percent "yes" votes and 53.4 "no" votes, the proposi
tion failed. The same infographic also incorrectly stated
that Proposition 71, which would provide funding for
stem-cell research, did not pass. With 59 percent "yes"
votes and 41 percent "no" votes, the proposition passed.
The Daily regrets the error and any confusion it caused.
