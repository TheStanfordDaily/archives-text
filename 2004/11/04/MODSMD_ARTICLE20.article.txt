## Volleyball faces two make-or-break games 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The time has come for the No. 12
Stanford women's volleyball team (15-
6. 7-3 Pacific-10 Conference) to prove
what it is made of. Only four days after
a disheartening five-game loss to No. 11
California (12-7.7-3 Pac-10), the Cardi
nal will play two matches that could de
termine their success for the rest of the
season.
On Thursday and Friday, Stanford
will host No. 16 UCLA (14-7,7-4 Pac-10)
and No. 4 Southern California (14-3,9-2
Pac-10). At the moment. Washington is
alone in first place with a record of 19-0,
11-0 in the conference, followed closely
by USC.
Stanford is currently tied for third
with Cal. both one win ahead of UCLA.
To stay among the conference leaders,
Stanford will want to come out of the

weekend with at least one win.
The last time the Bay Area and Los
Angeles schools faced each other, all
four teams came away with a win and a
loss. Stanford beat UCLA but lost to
USC, while Cal beat the Trojans but fell
to the Bruins. Since then all four teams
have been playing well, though UCLA
has lost some ground in the national
rankings.
As the second half of the season pro
gresses, every win is important, espe
cially in games where conference lead
ers duke it out. Washington is clearly in
command and has a chance to go unde
feated. The real struggle lies among the
four schools right behind the Huskies.
This will likely be the most important
weekend of the season, determining
which of these teams will stay at the top.
