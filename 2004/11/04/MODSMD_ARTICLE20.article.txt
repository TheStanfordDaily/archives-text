## Volleyball faces two make-or-break games 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The time has come for the No. 12
Stanford women's volleyball team (15-
6. 7-3 Pacific-10 Conference) to prove
what it is made of. Only four days after
a disheartening five-game loss to No. 11
California (12-7.7-3 Pac-10), the Cardi
nal will play two matches that could de
termine their success for the rest of the
season.
On Thursday and Friday, Stanford
will host No. 16 UCLA (14-7,7-4 Pac-10)
and No. 4 Southern California (14-3,9-2
Pac-10). At the moment. Washington is
alone in first place with a record of 19-0,
11-0 in the conference, followed closely
by USC.
Stanford is currently tied for third
with Cal. both one win ahead of UCLA.
To stay among the conference leaders,
Stanford will want to come out of the

weekend with at least one win.
The last time the Bay Area and Los
Angeles schools faced each other, all
four teams came away with a win and a
loss. Stanford beat UCLA but lost to
USC, while Cal beat the Trojans but fell
to the Bruins. Since then all four teams
have been playing well, though UCLA
has lost some ground in the national
rankings.
As the second half of the season pro
gresses, every win is important, espe
cially in games where conference lead
ers duke it out. Washington is clearly in
command and has a chance to go unde
feated. The real struggle lies among the
four schools right behind the Huskies.
This will likely be the most important
weekend of the season, determining
which of these teams will stay at the top.
Stanford's last match against
UCLA, an upset based on the
rankings, featured the most con
sistent and best quality play of the
season for the Cardinal. In the
loss to USC, a slow start and a late
rally that fell short doomed the
Cardinal.
The same problems appeared in
Sunday's loss to Cal, where Stan
ford dropped the first two games
(21-30, 25-30) with inconsistent
play before it managed to fight
back in the third and fourth games
(30-28,30-24).
Unforced errors on the Stan
ford side gave the Golden Bears an
8-2 lead in the fifth game, a deficit
that the Cardinal were unable to
overcome. Cal took the match with
a score of 9-15 in the fifth game.
If Stanford can come out as
strong as it did a month ago, it has
a good chance of repeating its ear
lier success against UCLA.
The last time the two faced each
other, the Cardinal came away
with a 3-1 victory, 30-24, 24-30,30-
25,30-28.
In that match, senior outside
hitter Ogonna Nnamani tallied a
career-best 36 kills, to go along

with a service ace and a block.
Sophomore outside hitter Kristin
Richards added 15 kills, while
middle blocker freshman Franci
Girard and senior opposite Jen
nifer Hucke qhipped in eight and
seven kills, respectively. Girard
also set a career high in blocks
with 10 on the evening to lead all
blockers.
The Bruins were led in that
match by Heather Cullen with 16
kills, followed by Brynn Murphy
and Becky Green with 12 apiece,
and Nana Meriwether with 10.
Meriwether also led the team in
blocks with nine.
In USC's 30-16, 30-20, 27-30,
30-26 victory over Stanford in Los
Angeles, the Cardinal play was
spotty, and they could not hold on
to a three-point lead halfway
through the fourth game.
The offensive leader for Stan
ford was once again Nnamani with
a match-high 24 kills, followed by
Richards with 17 and Hucke with
10. Each team posted nine total
blocks, and sophomore middle
blocker Lizzie Suiter led all players
with five.

USC has momentum
of five-game win streak

The Trojan attack was more
spread out. featuring five players
with double-digit kills.
Keao Burdine led the way with
18, followed closely by Sarah Flori
an with 16, Emily Adams with 15,
BibianaCandelaswith 14andStaci
Venski with 11. Overall the Tro
jans out-hit the Cardinal by 19 and
out-dug them by 11.
The Trojans come into the
weekend with a five-game winning
streak dating back to their 3-0 loss
to Cal a month ago. Since then
USC has beaten UCLA. Oregon
(9-12.1-10), Oregon State (9-11,3-
8), Arizona State (8-12, 3-8), 3-0
and No. 22 Arizona (13-8,5-6), 3-1.
Since losing to USC three
weeks ago, the Bruins swept Ore
gon and Arizona State 3-0, pulled
out a 3-2 win over Oregon State,
lost a non-conference match to
Pepperdine 3-2 and most recently
fell 3-0 to Arizona.
Both matches will be played in
Burnham Pavilion at 7 p.m.
Bleacher seating is already sold
out. but there will be student seat

spotty, and they could not hold on
to a three-point lead halfway
through the fourth game.
The offensive leader for Stan
ford was once again Nnamani with
a match-high 24 kills, followed by
Richards with 17 and Hucke with
10. Each team posted nine total
blocks, and sophomore middle
blocker Lizzie Suiter led all players
with five.

USC has momentum
of five-game win streak

The Trojan attack was more
spread out. featuring five players
with double-digit kills.
Keao Burdine led the way with
18, followed closely by Sarah Flori
an with 16, Emily Adams with 15,
BibianaCandelaswith 14andStaci
Venski with 11. Overall the Tro
jans out-hit the Cardinal by 19 and
out-dug them by 11.
The Trojans come into the
weekend with a five-game winning
streak dating back to their 3-0 loss
to Cal a month ago. Since then
USC has beaten UCLA. Oregon
(9-12.1-10), Oregon State (9-11,3-
8), Arizona State (8-12, 3-8), 3-0
and No. 22 Arizona (13-8,5-6), 3-1.
Since losing to USC three
weeks ago, the Bruins swept Ore
gon and Arizona State 3-0, pulled
out a 3-2 win over Oregon State,
lost a non-conference match to
Pepperdine 3-2 and most recently
fell 3-0 to Arizona.
Both matches will be played in
Burnham Pavilion at 7 p.m.
Bleacher seating is already sold
out. but there will be student seat
ing available first-come, first-serve
in the balcony.
The time has come for the No. 12
Stanford women's volleyball team (15-
6. 7-3 Pacific-10 Conference) to prove
what it is made of. Only four days after
a disheartening five-game loss to No. 11
California (12-7.7-3 Pac-10), the Cardi
nal will play two matches that could de
termine their success for the rest of the
season.
On Thursday and Friday, Stanford
will host No. 16 UCLA (14-7,7-4 Pac-10)
and No. 4 Southern California (14-3,9-2
Pac-10). At the moment. Washington is
alone in first place with a record of 19-0,
11-0 in the conference, followed closely
by USC.
Stanford is currently tied for third
with Cal. both one win ahead of UCLA.
To stay among the conference leaders,
Stanford will want to come out of the

weekend with at least one win.
The last time the Bay Area and Los
Angeles schools faced each other, all
four teams came away with a win and a
loss. Stanford beat UCLA but lost to
USC, while Cal beat the Trojans but fell
to the Bruins. Since then all four teams
have been playing well, though UCLA
has lost some ground in the national
rankings.
As the second half of the season pro
gresses, every win is important, espe
cially in games where conference lead
ers duke it out. Washington is clearly in
command and has a chance to go unde
feated. The real struggle lies among the
four schools right behind the Huskies.
This will likely be the most important
weekend of the season, determining
which of these teams will stay at the top.
Stanford's last match against
UCLA, an upset based on the
rankings, featured the most con
sistent and best quality play of the
season for the Cardinal. In the
loss to USC, a slow start and a late
rally that fell short doomed the
Cardinal.
The same problems appeared in
Sunday's loss to Cal, where Stan
ford dropped the first two games
(21-30, 25-30) with inconsistent
play before it managed to fight
back in the third and fourth games
(30-28,30-24).
Unforced errors on the Stan
ford side gave the Golden Bears an
8-2 lead in the fifth game, a deficit
that the Cardinal were unable to
overcome. Cal took the match with
a score of 9-15 in the fifth game.
If Stanford can come out as
strong as it did a month ago, it has
a good chance of repeating its ear
lier success against UCLA.
The last time the two faced each
other, the Cardinal came away
with a 3-1 victory, 30-24, 24-30,30-
25,30-28.
In that match, senior outside
hitter Ogonna Nnamani tallied a
career-best 36 kills, to go along

with a service ace and a block.
Sophomore outside hitter Kristin
Richards added 15 kills, while
middle blocker freshman Franci
Girard and senior opposite Jen
nifer Hucke qhipped in eight and
seven kills, respectively. Girard
also set a career high in blocks
with 10 on the evening to lead all
blockers.
The Bruins were led in that
match by Heather Cullen with 16
kills, followed by Brynn Murphy
and Becky Green with 12 apiece,
and Nana Meriwether with 10.
Meriwether also led the team in
blocks with nine.
In USC's 30-16, 30-20, 27-30,
30-26 victory over Stanford in Los
Angeles, the Cardinal play was
spotty, and they could not hold on
