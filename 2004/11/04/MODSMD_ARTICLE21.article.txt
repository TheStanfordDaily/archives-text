# One last shot for field hockey

### ANTARDEB GUHARAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
All the slates will be wiped clean on
Thursday, the records thrown out the win
dow. All that matters is the game at hand.
For the Stanford women's field hockey
team (6-11, 0-6 NorPac), a new season
starts on Thursday with the first game of
the Northern Pacific Athletic Conference
tournament.
The Cardinal begin tournament play
with a matchup against NorPac East regu
lar season champion Radford (9-9, 6-0
NorPac) at Davidson University in North
Carolina. Although Stanford hasn't en

joyed a great deal of success with league
opponents during the regular season, the
all-forgiving conference tournament gives
the CardinaNa chance to prove themselves.
The winner of the NorPac tournament gets
the opportunity to compete in a play-in
game for the NCAAs.
"We will approach it like we have every
game this year," said head coach Lesley
Irvine. "We have the potential for some big
wins in the postseason, and we will do all
we can to make it happen."
Stanford has historically been success
ful in the NorPac playoffs, winning the
event twice and finishing second three
times in the affair's brief six-year history.

The Cardinal have compiled a 12-4
tournament record and are a perfect 11-0
for the contest against all teams other
than California.
Having gone without a win in regular
season conference play, the Cardinal have
identified their weaknesses as they head
into the conference tournament.
"1 think one thing our team has been
working on is our offensive and defensive
execution," said junior goalkeeper Ana
Kralovec. "We have great offensive play
ers, but we've had some trouble scoring
this year. Hopefully our work on execution
will all come together."
The Stanford women also believe that

teams who overlook the Cardinal may be
in fora big surprise.
"It's kind of a bummer that we're going
into the [tournament] without a win in the
conference, but on the other hand it's nice
that we can come out and totally surprise
the other teams," said freshman forward
Jessica Zutz.
Stanford has faced Radford twice in
previous NorPac conference tourna
ments, recording 2-1 and 3-2 wins over
the Highlanders.
This year, the Highlanders have com
piled a perfect conference record, but have
been outscored on the season 57-21 and
have suffered two 9-0 losses. With a fast,
talented, and young group of forwards, the
Cardinal hope to take advantage of what
has been a porous defense for the High
landers at times this season.
Stanford has just one senior in midfield
er Eleanor Morgan, who was recently se
lected to play in the 2004 National Field
Hockey Coaches Association All-Star
game. Morgan will be joined by assistant
coach Jordan Steele and Irvine. Irvine was
selected as the head coach of the South
team.
"I am thrilled and honored to be asked
to coach the South team in this great
event," Irvine said. "It makes it particular
ly special having Morgan on the team and
Steele working with me as an assistant. I
welcome the opportunity to work with
some great student-athletes."
The Cardinal offense is led by Zutz and
sophomore forward Liz Robinson, both of
whom have recorded five goals and two as
sists this season fora total of 12 points. The
Cardinal defense is anchored by Kralovec
and sophomore Aska Sturdevan, who has a
team-high five defensive saves.
Stanford is coming off a 4-0 loss to No.
15 Cal at Berkeley. The Cardinal played a
statistically close game, but costly mistakes
led to the Bears running up the score in the
second half. Defending against penalty
corners will be a priority for Stanford in its
postseason play. Radford has managed just
one penalty corner goal all season, but
other teams have racked up 127 penalty
corners against the Cardinal this year and
have scored 14 times off of corners.
On Thursday, the Cardinal players can
finally wipe the painful memories of sever
al close losses off their minds and focus on
the postseason. Having enjoyed a great
deal of tournament success in previous
years, this year's Stanford team will look to
start the tournament off on a positive note
with a victory over Radford and continue
on to play the winner of the Pacific and Ap
palachian State matchup.

dow. All that matters is the game at hand.
For the Stanford women's field hockey
team (6-11, 0-6 NorPac), a new season
starts on Thursday with the first game of
the Northern Pacific Athletic Conference
tournament.
The Cardinal begin tournament play
with a matchup against NorPac East regu
lar season champion Radford (9-9, 6-0
NorPac) at Davidson University in North
Carolina. Although Stanford hasn't en

joyed a great deal of success with league
opponents during the regular season, the
all-forgiving conference tournament gives
the CardinaNa chance to prove themselves.
The winner of the NorPac tournament gets
the opportunity to compete in a play-in
game for the NCAAs.
"We will approach it like we have every
game this year," said head coach Lesley
Irvine. "We have the potential for some big
wins in the postseason, and we will do all
we can to make it happen."
Stanford has historically been success
ful in the NorPac playoffs, winning the
event twice and finishing second three
times in the affair's brief six-year history.

The Cardinal have compiled a 12-4
tournament record and are a perfect 11-0
for the contest against all teams other
than California.
Having gone without a win in regular
season conference play, the Cardinal have
identified their weaknesses as they head
into the conference tournament.
"1 think one thing our team has been
working on is our offensive and defensive
execution," said junior goalkeeper Ana
Kralovec. "We have great offensive play
ers, but we've had some trouble scoring
this year. Hopefully our work on execution
will all come together."
The Stanford women also believe that

teams who overlook the Cardinal may be
in fora big surprise.
"It's kind of a bummer that we're going
into the [tournament] without a win in the
conference, but on the other hand it's nice
that we can come out and totally surprise
the other teams," said freshman forward
Jessica Zutz.
Stanford has faced Radford twice in
previous NorPac conference tourna
ments, recording 2-1 and 3-2 wins over
the Highlanders.
This year, the Highlanders have com
piled a perfect conference record, but have
been outscored on the season 57-21 and
have suffered two 9-0 losses. With a fast,
talented, and young group of forwards, the
Cardinal hope to take advantage of what
has been a porous defense for the High
landers at times this season.
Stanford has just one senior in midfield
er Eleanor Morgan, who was recently se
lected to play in the 2004 National Field
Hockey Coaches Association All-Star
game. Morgan will be joined by assistant
coach Jordan Steele and Irvine. Irvine was
selected as the head coach of the South
team.
"I am thrilled and honored to be asked
to coach the South team in this great
event," Irvine said. "It makes it particular
ly special having Morgan on the team and
Steele working with me as an assistant. I
welcome the opportunity to work with
some great student-athletes."
The Cardinal offense is led by Zutz and
sophomore forward Liz Robinson, both of
whom have recorded five goals and two as
sists this season fora total of 12 points. The
Cardinal defense is anchored by Kralovec
and sophomore Aska Sturdevan, who has a
team-high five defensive saves.
Stanford is coming off a 4-0 loss to No.
15 Cal at Berkeley. The Cardinal played a
statistically close game, but costly mistakes
led to the Bears running up the score in the
second half. Defending against penalty
corners will be a priority for Stanford in its
postseason play. Radford has managed just
one penalty corner goal all season, but
other teams have racked up 127 penalty
corners against the Cardinal this year and
have scored 14 times off of corners.
On Thursday, the Cardinal players can
finally wipe the painful memories of sever
al close losses off their minds and focus on
the postseason. Having enjoyed a great
deal of tournament success in previous
years, this year's Stanford team will look to
start the tournament off on a positive note
with a victory over Radford and continue
on to play the winner of the Pacific and Ap
palachian State matchup.
