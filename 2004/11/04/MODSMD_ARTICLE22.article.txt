# Men's tennis sends two to ITA Indoor
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Nevermind that Stanford's Sam
Warburg is the No. 2 seed for singles
play at the ITA National Indoor Cham
pionships. Forget that he and teammate
K.C. Corkery also drew the second seed
for doubles play. After all, it's the end
result, and not the starting point, that
matters.
And for the Cardinal, a first-place
finish in either singles or doubles play is
well within reach.
For Warburg, who's ranked second
in national preseason polls, the thought
of an Indoor title has had the time to
grow over the last few weeks. After
clinching a berth for the tournament
when he landed in the final game of the
Icy Hot/ITA All-American Champi

onship. Warburg took a small break.
Because he had already qualified for
this week's events, there was no need to
play in last week's Wilson / ITA Re
gional. This doesn't mean the senior
has lost any focus on practicing, though.
"As a team we've been working
hard on fitness and the more important
things like holding serves," said War
burg. on what he has been doing to stay
focused since his last singles competi
tion Oct. 10.
No. 20 Corkery, on the other hand,
earned an at-large bid for the tourna
ment after his quarterfinals appearance
at Regionals. He will first face Duke's
Walter Ludovic Thursday. If Corkery
proceeds to the second round of play,
he will battle against top-seed Catalin
Gard, of Mississippi, to whom Warburg
lost in the Icy Hot final.

While Corkery doesn't want to look
too far ahead, he is anxious about the
possibility of playing Gard.
"I. try not to look ahead at tomor
row," Corkery said. "Every match is
going to be tough. You do notice what
part of the draw you're in. I would love
to get the opportunity and see how I
match up against [Gard]."
Warburg will square off against Indi
ana's Jakub Prabis in the first round.
Rounding out the top four seeds in
the singles field are Jesse Witten
from Kentucky and Pedro Rico of
Pepperdine.
The Indoor Championships host a
32-player singles field and a 16-team
doubles field for men and women.
Round of 32 play begins tomorrow
morning, while the round of 16 play
starts Friday and the tournament con

tinues through Sunday.
Doubles play also kicks off tomor
row with Corkery / Warburg set to
play Colorado's Marcos Digliodo and
Chad Tsuda. A funny coincidence, as
noted by Corkery, is that the Cardi
nal's assistant coach David Hodge
worked as a top assistant and recruit
ing coordinator at Colorado last sea
son. While the Stanford duo doesn't
believe this will be a great advantage,
they felt good knowing Hodge could
provide advice if the Cardinal find
themselves in a bind.
The Cardinal tandem of Corkery /
Warburg heads into the tournament
with confidence after winning last
year's NCAA title, but Stanford won't
be the only recent champion there. No.

" I'he field at the tournament is as tough as it's going
to get," Warburg said. "No match is an easy one."
But Stanford is confident in its game despite the tough
field, especially after a winning the doubles regional
championship just one week ago.
"We're not concerned," Corkery said. "I think excit

unsure. | Warburg and 1| both think we can compete with

tough as it's going to get'

anyone. No team can intimidate us.
"We're a ways away, but if we play to our ability that's
well with in our grasp," he added. "We're the favorites, if
not the favorite."
The Stanford duo arrived Tuesday in Ann Arbor,
Mich, to join the women's team's junior Alice Barnes
and senior Erin Burdette in representing Stanford tennis
in the national scene.
This weekend's championship is the second of three
national tournament titles this season, with the previous
being the All-American.
