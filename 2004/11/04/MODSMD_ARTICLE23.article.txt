# Women swing into third, men pick up sixth place
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Ever notice how a task gets easier when
you've almost finished it?
The Stanford golf teams each made a dash
for the clubhouse in their final tournaments of
the fall season. The No. 18 Stanford women,
competing at the third annual Las Vegas
Founders' Collegiate Showdown, cruised to a
third-place finish behind victorious Las Vegas
and No. 4 Washington.
The men battled brutal conditions at the
Prestige at PGA West, but rallied in their final
round to notch a sixth-place finish, 20 shots off
the winning pace of No. 11 UCLA.
At 7,156 yards, the par-72 Desert Course at
PGA West in La Quinta, Calif, is one of the
most difficult layouts that a men's college golf
team can expect to play during the course of
its season. When the course is set up to test
players qualifying for their PGA tour cards, as
it was this week, it becomes downright evil.
"Not only was the course tough from tee to

green but the greens were extremely undulat
ed, well-protected by water hazards and
bunkers, rock-hard and lightning-fast,"' said
junior Scott Mac Donald, who finished 33rd as
an individual, but whose score did not count
toward the team total.
Stanford followed the lead of sophomore
Zack Miller, who recaptured some of the
magic from his dynamic freshman season this
week. After a rough first day. Miller rebound
ed with a 69 on Tuesday to finish tied for fifth
place individually at seven over par.
"Instead of trying to shoot a low score and
be aggressive, I only tried to keep the ball in
the fairway and hit the biggest part of the
green," Miller said. "I knew there were going
to be high scores, so all I did was try to keep a
positive attitude after making mistakes."
Junior Kyle Gentry also played well, hang
ing on through a tough first day to finish in a
tie for 22nd.

Stanford junior Kelly Husted tied for 1 Otfi in Las
Vegas witfi a five over par performance.
Freshman Rob Grube might
have turned in a top-10 perfor
mance had it not been fora disas
trous second round that took him
out of contention. Grube settled
for 39th place on a course he ac
knowledged was the hardest he'd
ever played.
Senior Kevin Blue and fresh
man Teddy Collins rounded out
the scoring for the Cardinal,

with 45th- and 76th-place finish
es, respectively.
Playing as an individual, senior
Pat Phillips ended up alone in 80th
place.
Meanwhile, as many Stanford
students did their best to swing Las
Vegas, Nev. in favor of John
Kerry, the women's golf team
made its final swings of the fall sea
son count with their best finish of

Tangtiphaiboontana,
Husted tie for 10th

the year.
Junior Kelly Husted and sopho
more Jenni Tangtiphaiboontana
led the Cardinal, tying for l()th
place individually at five over par.
Tangtiphaiboontana's late rush up
the leaderboard was capped by a
final-round 70.
Sophomore Lauren Todd con
tinued her hot play from the Pepsi
Invitational, finishing just one shot
behind her teammates, tied for
14th.
Senior Wendra Liang stumbled
a bit in her second round, but re
bounded in Wednesday's final
round, recording a 43rd-place
showing.
Sophomore Jenna Seki trailed
Liang by a shot and finished in a tie
for 46th.
Stanford's third-place finish
was the latest chapter in a recent
surge that has propelled the team
back into the nation's Top 25.
More impressive is the fact that the
Cardinal have not only played, but
excelled with the minimum five
players allowed for NCAA com
petition— junior Stephanie Lue
has been sidelined with a back in
jury fora few weeks.
Both teams will now take a
break from competition until the
spring season arrives in February.
As they enter the winter training
schedule, both teams are confident
of success when the weather
warms.
With luck, the women's team
will be at full strength with Lue's
return.
The men, on the other hand,
look to build upon a solid fall
season.
"Four members of (the men's
team | have recorded at least one
Top 10 finish this fall, while last fall
only one had." Mac Donald said.
"It may take some time to learn
how to win. but if we keep building
our skills and our confidence, we
have the players to do it."

Both teams will now take a
break from competition until the

With luck, the women's team

Ever notice how a task gets easier when
you've almost finished it?
The Stanford golf teams each made a dash
for the clubhouse in their final tournaments of
the fall season. The No. 18 Stanford women,
competing at the third annual Las Vegas
Founders' Collegiate Showdown, cruised to a
third-place finish behind victorious Las Vegas
and No. 4 Washington.
The men battled brutal conditions at the
Prestige at PGA West, but rallied in their final
round to notch a sixth-place finish, 20 shots off
the winning pace of No. 11 UCLA.
At 7,156 yards, the par-72 Desert Course at
PGA West in La Quinta, Calif, is one of the
most difficult layouts that a men's college golf
team can expect to play during the course of
its season. When the course is set up to test
players qualifying for their PGA tour cards, as
it was this week, it becomes downright evil.
"Not only was the course tough from tee to

green but the greens were extremely undulat
ed, well-protected by water hazards and
bunkers, rock-hard and lightning-fast,"' said
junior Scott Mac Donald, who finished 33rd as
an individual, but whose score did not count
toward the team total.
Stanford followed the lead of sophomore
Zack Miller, who recaptured some of the
magic from his dynamic freshman season this
week. After a rough first day. Miller rebound
ed with a 69 on Tuesday to finish tied for fifth
place individually at seven over par.
"Instead of trying to shoot a low score and
be aggressive, I only tried to keep the ball in
the fairway and hit the biggest part of the
green," Miller said. "I knew there were going
to be high scores, so all I did was try to keep a
positive attitude after making mistakes."
Junior Kyle Gentry also played well, hang
ing on through a tough first day to finish in a
tie for 22nd.
