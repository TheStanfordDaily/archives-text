Ever notice how a task gets easier when
you've almost finished it?
The Stanford golf teams each made a dash
for the clubhouse in their final tournaments of
the fall season. The No. 18 Stanford women,
competing at the third annual Las Vegas
Founders' Collegiate Showdown, cruised to a
third-place finish behind victorious Las Vegas
and No. 4 Washington.
The men battled brutal conditions at the
Prestige at PGA West, but rallied in their final
round to notch a sixth-place finish, 20 shots off
the winning pace of No. 11 UCLA.
At 7,156 yards, the par-72 Desert Course at
PGA West in La Quinta, Calif, is one of the
most difficult layouts that a men's college golf
team can expect to play during the course of
its season. When the course is set up to test
players qualifying for their PGA tour cards, as
it was this week, it becomes downright evil.
"Not only was the course tough from tee to

green but the greens were extremely undulat
ed, well-protected by water hazards and
bunkers, rock-hard and lightning-fast,"' said
junior Scott Mac Donald, who finished 33rd as
an individual, but whose score did not count
toward the team total.
Stanford followed the lead of sophomore
Zack Miller, who recaptured some of the
magic from his dynamic freshman season this
week. After a rough first day. Miller rebound
ed with a 69 on Tuesday to finish tied for fifth
place individually at seven over par.
"Instead of trying to shoot a low score and
be aggressive, I only tried to keep the ball in
the fairway and hit the biggest part of the
green," Miller said. "I knew there were going
to be high scores, so all I did was try to keep a
positive attitude after making mistakes."
Junior Kyle Gentry also played well, hang
ing on through a tough first day to finish in a
tie for 22nd.
