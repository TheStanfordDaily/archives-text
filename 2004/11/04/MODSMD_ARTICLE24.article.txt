# The

## The

### CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON 
There comes a time in every sport when
someone must toss down the gloves and
throw a good old-fashioned fit. When
the team is up against it, and the breaks are
beating the boys, you've got to go out there
with all you've got and show your team you
care with a unadulterated flipout. And the best
way to do it is by willfully sloughing off your
sanity.
Though baseball (with its boys-will-be-boys
ethos) and hockey (with its unmitigated vio
lence) hold high tolerance for in-game melt
downs, no sport is above the fray. After intense
investigative reporting — the evening lineup
on ESPN Classic — The Double Clutch has
annotated some of the more famous blowups
in recent memory.
The Pine Tar Incident: In the summer of
'83, Kansas City's George Brett hit a go-ahead
two-run homer in the top of the ninth at Yan
kee Stadium. New York manager Billy Martin
calmly asked the home plate umpire to review
Brett's bat.
The ump ruled that the bat contained an ex
cessive amount of pine tar gripping agent,
waved off the home run and ended the game.
Brett stormed out of the dugout in an apoplec
tic rage, igniting a home-plate ruckus and invit
ing his own ejection.
In another bizarre step. Major League
Baseball later overruled the official's decision,
ordered Brett's home run re-scored and re
sumed the game three weeks later. Kansas
City won.
Mike Montgomery: The former Cardinal
hoops coach was not known fora demonstra
tive demeanor, but he had a particular habit to
showcase his distaste.
Stanford basketball fans know that at
Maples Pavilion there is an advertisement for
1050 AM "The Ticket" on the scorer's table,
right next to the home coaching box. When
Coach Montgomery, who is now charged with
rebuilding the moribund Golden State fran
chise, was about to tear into a player, he would
violently slap the advertisement, which rever
berated through the pavilion. Some called this
"spanking the ticket."
The Double Clutch trusts that new boss
Trent Johnson will endear himself to the stu
dents by quickly exhibiting his own brand of
steam-blowing.
Lou Piniella, Seattle Mariners: The former
