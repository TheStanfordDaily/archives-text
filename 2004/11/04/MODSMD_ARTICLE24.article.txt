# The 						Double Clutch
## The 						best of the hot-tempered sports figures 
### CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON 
There comes a time in every sport when
someone must toss down the gloves and
throw a good old-fashioned fit. When
the team is up against it, and the breaks are
beating the boys, you've got to go out there
with all you've got and show your team you
care with a unadulterated flipout. And the best
way to do it is by willfully sloughing off your
sanity.
Though baseball (with its boys-will-be-boys
ethos) and hockey (with its unmitigated vio
lence) hold high tolerance for in-game melt
downs, no sport is above the fray. After intense
investigative reporting — the evening lineup
on ESPN Classic — The Double Clutch has
annotated some of the more famous blowups
in recent memory.
The Pine Tar Incident: In the summer of
'83, Kansas City's George Brett hit a go-ahead
two-run homer in the top of the ninth at Yan
kee Stadium. New York manager Billy Martin
calmly asked the home plate umpire to review
Brett's bat.
The ump ruled that the bat contained an ex
cessive amount of pine tar gripping agent,
waved off the home run and ended the game.
Brett stormed out of the dugout in an apoplec
tic rage, igniting a home-plate ruckus and invit
ing his own ejection.
In another bizarre step. Major League
Baseball later overruled the official's decision,
ordered Brett's home run re-scored and re
sumed the game three weeks later. Kansas
City won.
Mike Montgomery: The former Cardinal
hoops coach was not known fora demonstra
tive demeanor, but he had a particular habit to
showcase his distaste.
Stanford basketball fans know that at
Maples Pavilion there is an advertisement for
1050 AM "The Ticket" on the scorer's table,
right next to the home coaching box. When
Coach Montgomery, who is now charged with
rebuilding the moribund Golden State fran
chise, was about to tear into a player, he would
violently slap the advertisement, which rever
berated through the pavilion. Some called this
"spanking the ticket."
The Double Clutch trusts that new boss
Trent Johnson will endear himself to the stu
dents by quickly exhibiting his own brand of
steam-blowing.
Lou Piniella, Seattle Mariners: The former
Reds manager brought his histrionics to Seattle, much to
the delight of fans. At the end of the 2()02 season, he ar
gued a hang-hangout at first base by throwing his hat and
drawing an ejection from the umpire. He then booted his
hat. threw it again, screamed some more and in a patent
ed display of rage, uprooted first base and threw it into
the outfield Twice. Po the otherwise genteel Seattle fans,
these were beloved images of Piniella and his intense
style.
Moving on to Tampa Hay the following season. Sweet
I.<ui showed he hadn't settled down. After right fielder
Hen Cirieve took a called third strike to end a would-be
comeback against the Yankees, he met a seething Piniel
la in the dugout.
I ou recounted his rage to reporters with words to this
effect . He said he thought the pitch was high. I asked him
why lie didn't say something to the ump. He said, "Oh, it
doesn't matter'... it does matter, it matters to me and it
matters to a lot ol damn people around here!"
Woody I la ves. Ohio State football: The late coach had
a famous temper he refused to muzzle. After an intercep
tion sealed Ohio State's 10-7 loss at Michigan in 1971,
I layes confronted the rets over what he argued was pass
interference. As 100.000 fans booed him, he stormed
across the artificial turf berating the officials and then

100,000 boos couldn't
quiet Woody Hayes

tore up the sideline markers in rage.
In the most infamous of incidents, also following an in
terception, Hayes slugged Clemson defensive tackle
Charlie Bauman on the sideline of the 1978 Gator Howl.
He never coached again. (In his defense, it is believed by
some that at the time, Hayes, a diabetic, had little concept
of what he had actually done.)
Yours Truly: As a senior, I attempted to will my high
school's volleyball team to victory in a loser-out, state
tournament qualifying game.
While the facts of the case are fuzzy, in my mind the
opponent was attempting to disrupt the game by taunting
us during our serves. When a point was over, I stepped
onto the court and shouted to the opposing bench to
knock it off. (There are people on campus who were pre
sent at this incident. They will remain unnamed for their
own protection.)
The next day at school the athletic director tracked me
down and made me write a letter of apology to one of our
biggest rivals, wishing them luck at State in the playoff
seed we should have had. Talk about shame!

hat. threw it again, screamed some more and in a patent
ed display of rage, uprooted first base and threw it into
the outfield Twice. Po the otherwise genteel Seattle fans,
these were beloved images of Piniella and his intense
style.
Moving on to Tampa Hay the following season. Sweet
I.<ui showed he hadn't settled down. After right fielder
Hen Cirieve took a called third strike to end a would-be
comeback against the Yankees, he met a seething Piniel
la in the dugout.
I ou recounted his rage to reporters with words to this
effect . He said he thought the pitch was high. I asked him
why lie didn't say something to the ump. He said, "Oh, it
doesn't matter'... it does matter, it matters to me and it
matters to a lot ol damn people around here!"
Woody I la ves. Ohio State football: The late coach had
a famous temper he refused to muzzle. After an intercep
tion sealed Ohio State's 10-7 loss at Michigan in 1971,
I layes confronted the rets over what he argued was pass
interference. As 100.000 fans booed him, he stormed
across the artificial turf berating the officials and then

100,000 boos couldn't
quiet Woody Hayes

tore up the sideline markers in rage.
In the most infamous of incidents, also following an in
terception, Hayes slugged Clemson defensive tackle
Charlie Bauman on the sideline of the 1978 Gator Howl.
He never coached again. (In his defense, it is believed by
some that at the time, Hayes, a diabetic, had little concept
of what he had actually done.)
Yours Truly: As a senior, I attempted to will my high
school's volleyball team to victory in a loser-out, state
tournament qualifying game.
While the facts of the case are fuzzy, in my mind the
opponent was attempting to disrupt the game by taunting
us during our serves. When a point was over, I stepped
onto the court and shouted to the opposing bench to
knock it off. (There are people on campus who were pre
sent at this incident. They will remain unnamed for their
own protection.)
The next day at school the athletic director tracked me
down and made me write a letter of apology to one of our
biggest rivals, wishing them luck at State in the playoff
seed we should have had. Talk about shame!

There comes a time in every sport when
someone must toss down the gloves and
throw a good old-fashioned fit. When
the team is up against it, and the breaks are
beating the boys, you've got to go out there
with all you've got and show your team you
care with a unadulterated flipout. And the best
way to do it is by willfully sloughing off your
sanity.
Though baseball (with its boys-will-be-boys
ethos) and hockey (with its unmitigated vio
lence) hold high tolerance for in-game melt
downs, no sport is above the fray. After intense
investigative reporting — the evening lineup
on ESPN Classic — The Double Clutch has
annotated some of the more famous blowups
in recent memory.
The Pine Tar Incident: In the summer of
'83, Kansas City's George Brett hit a go-ahead
two-run homer in the top of the ninth at Yan
kee Stadium. New York manager Billy Martin
calmly asked the home plate umpire to review
Brett's bat.
The ump ruled that the bat contained an ex
cessive amount of pine tar gripping agent,
waved off the home run and ended the game.
Brett stormed out of the dugout in an apoplec
tic rage, igniting a home-plate ruckus and invit
ing his own ejection.
In another bizarre step. Major League
Baseball later overruled the official's decision,
ordered Brett's home run re-scored and re
sumed the game three weeks later. Kansas
City won.
Mike Montgomery: The former Cardinal
hoops coach was not known fora demonstra
tive demeanor, but he had a particular habit to
showcase his distaste.
Stanford basketball fans know that at
Maples Pavilion there is an advertisement for
1050 AM "The Ticket" on the scorer's table,
right next to the home coaching box. When
Coach Montgomery, who is now charged with
rebuilding the moribund Golden State fran
chise, was about to tear into a player, he would
violently slap the advertisement, which rever
berated through the pavilion. Some called this
"spanking the ticket."
The Double Clutch trusts that new boss
Trent Johnson will endear himself to the stu
dents by quickly exhibiting his own brand of
steam-blowing.
Lou Piniella, Seattle Mariners: The former
Reds manager brought his histrionics to Seattle, much to
the delight of fans. At the end of the 2()02 season, he ar
gued a hang-hangout at first base by throwing his hat and
drawing an ejection from the umpire. He then booted his
hat. threw it again, screamed some more and in a patent
ed display of rage, uprooted first base and threw it into
the outfield Twice. Po the otherwise genteel Seattle fans,
these were beloved images of Piniella and his intense
style.
