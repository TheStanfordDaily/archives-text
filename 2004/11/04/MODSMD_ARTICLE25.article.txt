# Club Sports Update: Squash program generating excitement
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In IW9, a group of students formed the Stanford
Squash Program. Since then, athletes in the program
have been working hard to make Stanford "the hub of
squash on the West Coast," according to their program
vision statement, 112 ive years later, and after churning out
an elite national player, the squad is pretty close to that
goal now.
In its first year of competition, the men's team was
ranked last in the nation. Since then, the team has im
proved its ranking every year. In 2001, the men's team
won the Barnaby Trophy, given to the most improved
squ;td in the nation. Last year's men's team captain. Rich
Sherwood, won the College Squash Association's high
est individual award, the Skillman Award.
All these accomplishments came while the program
was entirely student-run. This August, Stanford Athlet
ics recogni/ed the program's potential by appointing a
full-time director, former professional player Mark Tal
bott. Squash Magazine even recently ran an article on
Talbott's arrival at Stanford.
Why the commotion? Well, Talbott isn't your ordi
nary director, lie was ranked first in the world for 12
straight years and recorded more than 2(X) tournament
wins. He is also the founder of the Talbott Squash
Academy in Newport. Rhode Island, which has become
the premier squash training center in the nation.
Meanwhile, here at Stanford, efforts are underway to
follow that example. By summer 2005, the Arrillaga
112 amily Recreational Center will be home to eight new,
glass-backed, international courts.
Squash courts are the backbone of the sport, a one

on-one competition played with a soft rubber ball and
rackets. The walls of a squash court have boundaries
where the ball must be hit, and two players must alter
nate hits.
"The combination of physical and mental skills need
ed makes it such that there is a huge variety of playing
styles and approaches to the game," said junior Aaron
Ligon.
Although squash is physically demanding with much
twisting and lunging, it is also a game of deception and
strategy. Most squash athletes agree that this is what
makes it distinctive and enjoyable.
"The mental part of the game is as important if not
greater than the physical side of it," said senior Patricia
Kwok.
For team competitions, nine players from each team
represent their school in individual matches. The first
match is played between athletes who hold the No. 1 po
sition on their teams, and the matches progress down the
ranking ladder. Victory is awarded to the school that
wins five or more matches.
The Stanford men's squash season kicks off with a
home competition this Saturday at the DeGuerre Squash
Courts. No. 15 Navy will play No. 18 Stanford at 11 a.m.,
and at 4 p.m., Stanford will return to face No. 35 Utah.
The squad is hoping fora strong student showing at the
contests.
"When you're in a long and difficult match fighting
for every point, there's nothing like a cheering crowd to
keep you going hard," Ligon said.
Although Stanford squash is only a club sport, it
plays all its matches against varsity teams. Thus, the
support of the student body is especially appreciated.
"I may pull out my signature between-the-legs shot

if enough fans show up," said men's team captain Chris
Fesenmaier.
Fesenmaier was originally a tennis player, but he start
ed playing squash in high school with the hopes of being
able to continue with the sport in college. However, as a re
sult of the relative newness of the Stanford program, his ex
perience here has been far beyond his expectations.
"Not many athletes get the chance to determine the
direction of their program, and that has given me valu
able experience and a feeling of dedication to the team."
Fesenmaier said.
That dedication is something all Stanford squash
players understand. They practice two hours a day. four
days a week. Many of the athletes also participate in in
dividual lessons and lift weights on their own time.
Some even play in a Bay Area league on top of colle
giate competitions.
The Stanford women have shown their dedication as
well, even though the team is only in its fourth year. The
women were ranked 28th in the country last year, and
their goal for this season is to break the top 20.
"The women's team was pretty ad hoc and untalented
in its first year, and only a few people had played before,"
said women's team captain Maisy Samuelson. "The se
niors on the team now who were freshmen during that
first year often look back and laugh about how far we've
come."
This year is a promising one for the women's team
with the addition of freshman Elizabeth "Brooksie"
Riley, who has played competitive squash for over eight
years. Although she will be new to the team, she is start
ing at the No. 1 position.
"Squash has been a huge part of my life, and I hope to
share my passions for the sport with others as squash

grows on the West Coast," Riley said, "I am so excited to
be a part of the beginning of a program that will become
so strong."
Another promising addition to the team this year is
freshman Esther Cheng, a former tennis player who
started playing squash just one month ago.
"[Cheng] has the potential to be the next Rich Sher
wood," Samuelson said. "Rich started playing squash as
a freshman, was cut during tryouts only to be called back
when another player quit and ended up playing No. 1 on
the team and winning the Skillman Award."
A recreational club is designed for squash players
who do not wish to take their game to a competitive level.
With over 50 members, this club helps finance the com
petition team by holding two tournaments a year.
Briefly...
The Stanford cycling club finished 13th at the Colle
giate Mountain Bike Nationals, held Oct. 28-30. Riding
in rain and mud that caked so thickly on tires that they
could barely rotate, grad student Patty Compton accu
mulated enough individual points to be named Ail-
American.
"The course consisted of mostly wet grass and mud. It
was like biking through soup," said senior cyclist Rafer
Willenberg. "It was hard to get down the Dual Slalom
course just without sliding out. It wasn't even possible to
walk down it."

Willenberg. "It was hard to get down the Dual Slalom
course just without sliding out. It wasn't even possible to
walk down it."

In IW9, a group of students formed the Stanford
Squash Program. Since then, athletes in the program
have been working hard to make Stanford "the hub of
squash on the West Coast," according to their program
vision statement, 112 ive years later, and after churning out
an elite national player, the squad is pretty close to that
goal now.
In its first year of competition, the men's team was
ranked last in the nation. Since then, the team has im
proved its ranking every year. In 2001, the men's team
won the Barnaby Trophy, given to the most improved
squ;td in the nation. Last year's men's team captain. Rich
Sherwood, won the College Squash Association's high
est individual award, the Skillman Award.
All these accomplishments came while the program
was entirely student-run. This August, Stanford Athlet
ics recogni/ed the program's potential by appointing a
full-time director, former professional player Mark Tal
bott. Squash Magazine even recently ran an article on
Talbott's arrival at Stanford.
Why the commotion? Well, Talbott isn't your ordi
nary director, lie was ranked first in the world for 12
straight years and recorded more than 2(X) tournament
wins. He is also the founder of the Talbott Squash
Academy in Newport. Rhode Island, which has become
the premier squash training center in the nation.
Meanwhile, here at Stanford, efforts are underway to
follow that example. By summer 2005, the Arrillaga
112 amily Recreational Center will be home to eight new,
glass-backed, international courts.
Squash courts are the backbone of the sport, a one

on-one competition played with a soft rubber ball and
rackets. The walls of a squash court have boundaries
where the ball must be hit, and two players must alter
nate hits.
"The combination of physical and mental skills need
ed makes it such that there is a huge variety of playing
styles and approaches to the game," said junior Aaron
Ligon.
Although squash is physically demanding with much
twisting and lunging, it is also a game of deception and
strategy. Most squash athletes agree that this is what
makes it distinctive and enjoyable.
"The mental part of the game is as important if not
greater than the physical side of it," said senior Patricia
Kwok.
For team competitions, nine players from each team
represent their school in individual matches. The first
match is played between athletes who hold the No. 1 po
sition on their teams, and the matches progress down the
ranking ladder. Victory is awarded to the school that
wins five or more matches.
The Stanford men's squash season kicks off with a
home competition this Saturday at the DeGuerre Squash
Courts. No. 15 Navy will play No. 18 Stanford at 11 a.m.,
and at 4 p.m., Stanford will return to face No. 35 Utah.
The squad is hoping fora strong student showing at the
contests.
"When you're in a long and difficult match fighting
for every point, there's nothing like a cheering crowd to
keep you going hard," Ligon said.
Although Stanford squash is only a club sport, it
plays all its matches against varsity teams. Thus, the
support of the student body is especially appreciated.
"I may pull out my signature between-the-legs shot

if enough fans show up," said men's team captain Chris
Fesenmaier.
Fesenmaier was originally a tennis player, but he start
ed playing squash in high school with the hopes of being
able to continue with the sport in college. However, as a re
sult of the relative newness of the Stanford program, his ex
perience here has been far beyond his expectations.
"Not many athletes get the chance to determine the
direction of their program, and that has given me valu
able experience and a feeling of dedication to the team."
Fesenmaier said.
That dedication is something all Stanford squash
players understand. They practice two hours a day. four
days a week. Many of the athletes also participate in in
dividual lessons and lift weights on their own time.
Some even play in a Bay Area league on top of colle
giate competitions.
The Stanford women have shown their dedication as
well, even though the team is only in its fourth year. The
women were ranked 28th in the country last year, and
their goal for this season is to break the top 20.
"The women's team was pretty ad hoc and untalented
in its first year, and only a few people had played before,"
said women's team captain Maisy Samuelson. "The se
niors on the team now who were freshmen during that
first year often look back and laugh about how far we've
come."
This year is a promising one for the women's team
with the addition of freshman Elizabeth "Brooksie"
Riley, who has played competitive squash for over eight
years. Although she will be new to the team, she is start
ing at the No. 1 position.
"Squash has been a huge part of my life, and I hope to
share my passions for the sport with others as squash

grows on the West Coast," Riley said, "I am so excited to
be a part of the beginning of a program that will become
so strong."
Another promising addition to the team this year is
freshman Esther Cheng, a former tennis player who
started playing squash just one month ago.
"[Cheng] has the potential to be the next Rich Sher
wood," Samuelson said. "Rich started playing squash as
a freshman, was cut during tryouts only to be called back
when another player quit and ended up playing No. 1 on
the team and winning the Skillman Award."
A recreational club is designed for squash players
who do not wish to take their game to a competitive level.
With over 50 members, this club helps finance the com
petition team by holding two tournaments a year.
Briefly...
The Stanford cycling club finished 13th at the Colle
giate Mountain Bike Nationals, held Oct. 28-30. Riding
in rain and mud that caked so thickly on tires that they
could barely rotate, grad student Patty Compton accu
mulated enough individual points to be named Ail-
American.
"The course consisted of mostly wet grass and mud. It
was like biking through soup," said senior cyclist Rafer
Willenberg. "It was hard to get down the Dual Slalom
course just without sliding out. It wasn't even possible to
