# Much-revised ASSU bill passes
## Senate commits to promoting dialogue when student groups are attacked 
### GERRY SHIH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Tuesday night, the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate passed a bill "to
strengthen diversity and free
speech" by a unanimous vote of 11-
0-4. Initially proposed to the Senate
on Oct. 19 by sophomore Senator
Omar Shakir. the bill had stirred

controversy within the Senate and
was revised twice before finally pass
ing on Tuesday.
Shakir, also the Senate advocacy
chair, said he was motivated by the
one-year anniversary of the public
controversy between MEChA, a
Chicano / Latino organization on
campus, and the on-campus student
publication, the Stanford Review. A
year ago, the Review published a se
ries of articles about MEChA, com
paring it to the Ku Klux Klan and
calling it"a racist organization that
advocates revolution and segrega
tion." In April, MEChA failed to re
ceive special-fees funding â€” a result
that many, including the Review, at

tribute to the published articles.
The core of the new bill is a section
resolving that the Senate "commits
to strongly and quickly supporting all
student groups by providing a forum
for open discussion of controversial
issues as they arise and highlighting
views that the Senate finds mischar
acterized or underrepresented."
The bill that was initially proposed
criticized the Review and guaran
teed the ASSU's support for Stan
ford's ethnic groups when under at
tack. It drew mixed reactions from
the Senate, as some senators were
concerned that the legislation would
attack the Review and stifle free
speech on campus.

Since then, the bill has seen
marked changes in its approach and
tone. Sophomore Senator Anita
Mukherjee opposed the original bill
but voted for the final version.
"When Omar brought up the bill,
there were concerns that the ASSU
would have to pick sides when stu
dent groups were in conflict,"
Mukherjee said. "What we ended up
with was an affirmation of what we
are committed to doing: providing a
forum if there are disagreements."
Shakir admitted that he was
"emotional" when he authored the
original bill, but said he is actually
more pleased with the final draft.
