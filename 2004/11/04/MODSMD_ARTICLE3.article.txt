# Much-revised ASSU bill passes
## Senate commits to promoting dialogue when student groups are attacked 
### GERRY SHIH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Tuesday night, the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate passed a bill "to
strengthen diversity and free
speech" by a unanimous vote of 11-
0-4. Initially proposed to the Senate
on Oct. 19 by sophomore Senator
Omar Shakir. the bill had stirred

controversy within the Senate and
was revised twice before finally pass
ing on Tuesday.
Shakir, also the Senate advocacy
chair, said he was motivated by the
one-year anniversary of the public
controversy between MEChA, a
Chicano / Latino organization on
campus, and the on-campus student
publication, the Stanford Review. A
year ago, the Review published a se
ries of articles about MEChA, com
paring it to the Ku Klux Klan and
calling it"a racist organization that
advocates revolution and segrega
tion." In April, MEChA failed to re
ceive special-fees funding — a result
that many, including the Review, at

tribute to the published articles.
The core of the new bill is a section
resolving that the Senate "commits
to strongly and quickly supporting all
student groups by providing a forum
for open discussion of controversial
issues as they arise and highlighting
views that the Senate finds mischar
acterized or underrepresented."
The bill that was initially proposed
criticized the Review and guaran
teed the ASSU's support for Stan
ford's ethnic groups when under at
tack. It drew mixed reactions from
the Senate, as some senators were
concerned that the legislation would
attack the Review and stifle free
speech on campus.

Since then, the bill has seen
marked changes in its approach and
tone. Sophomore Senator Anita
Mukherjee opposed the original bill
but voted for the final version.
"When Omar brought up the bill,
there were concerns that the ASSU
would have to pick sides when stu
dent groups were in conflict,"
Mukherjee said. "What we ended up
with was an affirmation of what we
are committed to doing: providing a
forum if there are disagreements."
Shakir admitted that he was
"emotional" when he authored the
original bill, but said he is actually
more pleased with the final draft.
which does not attack or refer to the
Review specifically and does not
guarantee unconditional ASSU
support for groups under attack.
"We took the bill out of the
MEChA / Review context, and
none of the changes took away from
the heart of the bill," Shakir said.
"We're trying to set general guide
lines for how the ASSU should act in
case another conflict arises."
There remain senators dissatis
fied and concerned with the bill, in
cluding sophomore Chris Nguyen,
who abstained during the vote.
"It;s certainly an improvement
over the original version, but it still
makes the Senate take sides when
there are two conflicting student
groups," Nguyen said. "For exam
ple, if Stanford Students for Life
and Stanford Students for Choice
come into conflict, how do we pick
which side is mischaracterized' or
'underrepresented'?"
"Honestly, we may be opening a
can of worms."
Senior Stephen Cohen, editor
emeritus and current staffer of the
Review, said he feels that the bill
was simply a direct response to
MEChA's losing funding. Cohen
said that he believes the bill is a di
rect reference to the Review's past
publications and cited a section that
requires ASSU action when there
are "calculated, deliberate attacks
on vulnerable student groups aimed
at silencing campus discourse."
"I personally find such legisla
tion distasteful and a waste of the
student body's time. Let us not for-

Some fear
slippery slope

get, the student body voted against
funding MEChA." he said. "Our in
vestigative journalism regarding
MEChA was not an attack, hut
rather an attempt to promote stu
dent discourse. But it seems the sen
ate is only interested in promoting
discourse that fits into the narrow
confines of political correctness."
Shakir maintained that that par
ticular section of the bill was in no
way referring to the Review.
"That statement reflects a more
general fear among student groups
of what may happen to them,"
Shakir said. "While the Senate did
feel the Review's characterization
of MEChA was unfair, we absolute
ly support their right to investigative
journalism and freedom of speech."
Senate Chair Chris Lin, a senior,
was one of the four who abstained
during the vote, and remains wary
of Senate partiality in student
group conflicts. However, he ex
pressed his support for the idea in
the bill that the Senate should
bring groups together for con
structive dialogue during times of
disagreement.
"In my opinion, the Senate
should not be taking sides in stu
dent group conflicts and I firmly
believe in having a very diverse set
of viewpoints expressed in publi
cations and programming," Lin
said. "We should serve to encour
age open dialogue between stu
dent groups if disagreements do
arise and we may start to ensure
that platforms are available for
civil discussion."

are committed to doing: providing a
forum if there are disagreements."
Shakir admitted that he was
"emotional" when he authored the
original bill, but said he is actually
more pleased with the final draft.
which does not attack or refer to the
Review specifically and does not
guarantee unconditional ASSU
support for groups under attack.
"We took the bill out of the
MEChA / Review context, and
none of the changes took away from
the heart of the bill," Shakir said.
"We're trying to set general guide
lines for how the ASSU should act in
case another conflict arises."
There remain senators dissatis
fied and concerned with the bill, in
cluding sophomore Chris Nguyen,
who abstained during the vote.
"It;s certainly an improvement
over the original version, but it still
makes the Senate take sides when
there are two conflicting student
groups," Nguyen said. "For exam
ple, if Stanford Students for Life
and Stanford Students for Choice
come into conflict, how do we pick
which side is mischaracterized' or
'underrepresented'?"
"Honestly, we may be opening a
can of worms."
Senior Stephen Cohen, editor
emeritus and current staffer of the
Review, said he feels that the bill
was simply a direct response to
MEChA's losing funding. Cohen
said that he believes the bill is a di
rect reference to the Review's past
publications and cited a section that
requires ASSU action when there
are "calculated, deliberate attacks
on vulnerable student groups aimed
at silencing campus discourse."
"I personally find such legisla
tion distasteful and a waste of the
student body's time. Let us not for-

Some fear
slippery slope

get, the student body voted against
funding MEChA." he said. "Our in
vestigative journalism regarding
MEChA was not an attack, hut
rather an attempt to promote stu
dent discourse. But it seems the sen
ate is only interested in promoting
discourse that fits into the narrow
confines of political correctness."
Shakir maintained that that par
ticular section of the bill was in no
way referring to the Review.
"That statement reflects a more
general fear among student groups
of what may happen to them,"
Shakir said. "While the Senate did
feel the Review's characterization
of MEChA was unfair, we absolute
ly support their right to investigative
journalism and freedom of speech."
Senate Chair Chris Lin, a senior,
was one of the four who abstained
during the vote, and remains wary
of Senate partiality in student
group conflicts. However, he ex
pressed his support for the idea in
the bill that the Senate should
bring groups together for con
structive dialogue during times of
disagreement.
"In my opinion, the Senate
should not be taking sides in stu
dent group conflicts and I firmly
believe in having a very diverse set
of viewpoints expressed in publi
cations and programming," Lin
said. "We should serve to encour
age open dialogue between stu
dent groups if disagreements do
arise and we may start to ensure
that platforms are available for
civil discussion."
On Tuesday night, the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate passed a bill "to
strengthen diversity and free
speech" by a unanimous vote of 11-
0-4. Initially proposed to the Senate
on Oct. 19 by sophomore Senator
Omar Shakir. the bill had stirred

controversy within the Senate and
was revised twice before finally pass
ing on Tuesday.
Shakir, also the Senate advocacy
chair, said he was motivated by the
one-year anniversary of the public
controversy between MEChA, a
Chicano / Latino organization on
campus, and the on-campus student
publication, the Stanford Review. A
year ago, the Review published a se
ries of articles about MEChA, com
paring it to the Ku Klux Klan and
calling it"a racist organization that
advocates revolution and segrega
tion." In April, MEChA failed to re
ceive special-fees funding — a result
that many, including the Review, at

tribute to the published articles.
The core of the new bill is a section
resolving that the Senate "commits
to strongly and quickly supporting all
student groups by providing a forum
for open discussion of controversial
issues as they arise and highlighting
views that the Senate finds mischar
acterized or underrepresented."
The bill that was initially proposed
criticized the Review and guaran
teed the ASSU's support for Stan
ford's ethnic groups when under at
tack. It drew mixed reactions from
the Senate, as some senators were
concerned that the legislation would
attack the Review and stifle free
speech on campus.

Since then, the bill has seen
marked changes in its approach and
tone. Sophomore Senator Anita
Mukherjee opposed the original bill
but voted for the final version.
"When Omar brought up the bill,
there were concerns that the ASSU
would have to pick sides when stu
dent groups were in conflict,"
Mukherjee said. "What we ended up
with was an affirmation of what we
are committed to doing: providing a
forum if there are disagreements."
Shakir admitted that he was
"emotional" when he authored the
