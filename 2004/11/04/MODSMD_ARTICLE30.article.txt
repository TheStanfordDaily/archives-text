# UC-Berkeley-area voters hit polls in record numbers

### RACHEL LUNA JACQUELINE SOOHOO DAILY CALIFORNIAN (U. CALIFORNIA-BERKELEY 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY,
Calif. - For many polling sites in
Alameda County, Calif., on Tues
day, the biggest problem was run
ning out of "I Voted" stickers, as a
record number of students and
residents turned out to cast their
votes in the presidential election,
said the Alameda County Regis
trar's office.
The registrar's office projected 75
percent of the 752.000 registered
voters would turn out to cast their
ballots. There were 669.000 regis
tered during the last presidential
election.
The boost in voter turnout Tues
day led to long lines and even longer
delays for voting.
Some voters waited in line up to
30 minutes to take place in an elec
tion that some have said is the most
important in history.
"I'd rather have too many people
around than too few," said Kate
Jenkins, a Westminster Flouse poll

worker.
Some who waited in the long lines
met administrative problems when
they got to the voting booth.
Some University of California-
Berkeley students were turned away
from the polls and issued provisional
paper ballots because their names
did not appear on the roster. Many
who signed up near the registration
deadline were not included in their
precinct rosters, said Elaine Gin
nold, assistant voter registrar for
Alameda County.
About 5,000 voters were forced to
vote with provisional ballots, Gin
nold said. But she said the registrar's
office did not receive many com
plaints.
Donna DeDiemar, a poll worker
at the Unit 3 residence hall, said she
has never seen so many people
forced to vote provisionally.
"I've worked elections for many,
many years and I've never seen one
so screwed up." she said.
Forty thousand people submitted
registration forms on the last day to
register, leading to a flood of paper
work and making fora clog in the
system, Ginnold said.

Half of those were probably peo
ple re-registering at different ad
dresses, she said.
Missing names on the roster
could also be a result of college stu
dents moving back and forth from
their home cities, creating more
paper work and slowing down the
registration process, said poll worker
Teri Piccolo.
Some people were concerned
that provisional ballots would be
thrown out.
Voters who had already sent in
absentee ballots or submitted the
provisional ballot to an incorrect lo
cation could have their provisional
ballots canceled, Ginnold said.
Because local measures differ on
each precinct's ballot, people can
only vote in their assigned precinct,
Ginnold said.
Alameda County has the ability
to cross-check to make sure voters
have not voted at more than one
place, Ginnold said.
Trained clerks at the registrar's
office will have 28 days to evaluate
whether a provisional ballot will be
thrown out, Ginnold said.
With so many ways for the bal

lot to be thrown out, some provi
sional voters say they are con
cerned their vote won't count, but
others say they have more faith in
the system.
UC-Berkeley senior Randi Naga
hori registered just four days before
the deadline and had to vote with a
paper ballot.
"I'm pretty sure (my provisional
ballot) will go through," Nagahori
said. "Plus, I'd rather be here voting
and worried than at home being apa
thetic."
Ginnold said that as long as the
forms were used correctly and in the
proper precinct, the votes will count.
Inaccuracies with voting ma
chines — one problem many people
expected after the Florida debacle in
the 2000 presidential election —
never manifested.
There were no reported problems
of this nature Tuesday, Ginnold said.
"It's this hysteria over the touch
screens over these few years or so
that has made people suspicious of
using them," Ginnold said. "I can tell
you that the touch screens are very
accurate."
