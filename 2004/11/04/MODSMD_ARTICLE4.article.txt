# Bush victory leaves many students angry, despondent
## 
### SAM FLOAM, SARAH RIZK BEA SANFORD 
Hours after Sen. John Kerry
conceded defeat in his bid for the
presidency, many students around
campus were still reeling from the
Democrat's loss to President
George W. Bush.
Emotions among Kerry sup
porters ranged from shock and
dismay to frustration and anger,
while supporters of Bush were ju
bilant at the prospect of four more
years in the White House.
"The country showed that they
believe that the president has pro
vided good leadership over the
last four years." said junior Bob
Sensenbrenner, president of the
Stanford College Republicans.
"It's America who won on Elec
tion night and today."
At dining halls across campus
last night, the election was the
topic of conversation; below are
some of the scenes from dinner ta
bles around Stanford last night.

Wilbur Marketplace
The prevalent mood in Wilbur
Dining last night was one of frus
tration and dejection. While De
mocratic tendencies were evident.
Republicans appeared notably
quiet or absent all together.
"I'm very disappointed about
the outcome of the election," said
freshman Francisco Luongo. "I
think people will realize their mis
take in four years."
Freshman Niko Malkovich
shared in this sense of disappoint
ment. describing himself as "ap
palled and disenchanted."
While still upset, some stu
dents hoped that Bush might alter
his tone in his next term.
"I'm clearly very sad about the
outcome of the election, but I'm
optimistic about the next four
years because it can't get much
worse," said junior Andrew
Ardinger. "He's either going to

become thoughtful and centrist,
or he's going to kill us all. Some
thing is going to change."
Many students said that they
expected more from the Ameri
can people, and hoped that in the
future citizens would research the
issues in more depth before head
ing to the voting booth. One inter
national student urged Americans
to examine international relations
more closely.
"I'm really upset because I
think the election results show
that Americans don't care about
international policy and about
what's going on around the
world." said freshman Melis Yil
man.
Although Republicans were
scarce, those found were opti
mistic about the future of the
country.
"I am thrilled about the re
sults of the election and believe

Center in Washington, D.C. yesterday after defeating Sen. John Kerry.
the nation will move forward with
Republican majorities in the House
and Senate," said freshman Erin
Howe.
Democrats and Republicans
alike, however, seemed to agree that
the election had made strong im
pressions on everyone involved.
"I've never seen an election affect
people in such a drastic way," said
freshman Momchil Filev.

Florence Moore Dining Hall
Students at Florence Moore Din
ing Hall at dinner last night were
somber and stunned as they con
templated Tuesday's election re
sults. While there were a handful of
satisfied or apathetic individuals,
most students were generally upset
with the outcome of the presidential
race.
Freshman Selena Simmons-
Duffin, a member of the Stanford
Democrats, said she worked hard

this quarter registering students to
vote.
"I was shocked," she said. "I can
not believe the opportunity to get
Bush out of office has come and
gone."
Freshman Matt McLaughlin was
also upset with the election results.
"The sun rose this morning, and I
was quite surprised," he said.
Freshman Dylan Gwaltney
agreed.
"I am just numb after all the an
ticipation and the stalking of
cnn.com last night," he said. "I
checked Ohio's voting percentages
and precinct percentages every 30
seconds."
Some students, like freshman
Doug Wilson, were more optimistic
about the results.
"I think that 1 am not as shell
shocked as most liberal people," he
said. "I don't believe that John Kerry
was the solution anyway. There are
a lot deeper-seated problems that
aren't going to change with just one
politician and just one vote."

Freshman Deonna Hodges said
she was happy just to know that the
election was definitive.
"I am kind of at peace because we
finally know the president of our
country," she said.
Some conservative students,
however, felt uncomfortable ex
pressing their views.
"I am happy with the results, but I
feel that I have to hold my feelings
back because of the predominantly
liberal views of the school," said
freshman Michael Bury.
Other students were simply an
noyed with the continuous political
conversations.
"I can't even pretend to care any
more," exclaimed freshman Rolf
Timp.

Toyon Eating Clubs
Anger and disappointment were
the prevailing emotions last night at
the Toyon Eating Clubs as students

Emotions run high after election

sat down for their first post-election
dinners.
Junior Josh Mendoza said he was
upset at apathy among students.
"I thought it was sad. because we
go to this liberal school, but [the elec
tion had] the same turnout for col
lege age voters as in 2000," he said.
Fifth-year co-terminal student
Emily Nahas agreed.
"I feel wronged," she said. "I was
almost in tears last night, but no one
else seemed to care."
Sophomore Alejandro De Los
Angeles criticized Kerry's cam
paign, arguing that it fell short of
expectations.
"I was upset," he said. "Kerry had
a chance to be president, but he
didn't capitalize on it."
Other students expressed more
disappointed than anger. Sopho
mores Rui Xiong Kee and Rakesh
Amaram just laughed at the mention
of yesterday's election.
"Bush sucks," Kee said.
