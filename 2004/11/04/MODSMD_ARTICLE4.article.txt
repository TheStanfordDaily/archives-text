## 
### SAM FLOAM, SARAH RIZK BEA SANFORD 
Hours after Sen. John Kerry
conceded defeat in his bid for the
presidency, many students around
campus were still reeling from the
Democrat's loss to President
George W. Bush.
Emotions among Kerry sup
porters ranged from shock and
dismay to frustration and anger,
while supporters of Bush were ju
bilant at the prospect of four more
years in the White House.
"The country showed that they
believe that the president has pro
vided good leadership over the
last four years." said junior Bob
Sensenbrenner, president of the
Stanford College Republicans.
"It's America who won on Elec
tion night and today."
At dining halls across campus
last night, the election was the
topic of conversation; below are
some of the scenes from dinner ta

The prevalent mood in Wilbur
Dining last night was one of frus
tration and dejection. While De
mocratic tendencies were evident.
Republicans appeared notably
quiet or absent all together.
"I'm very disappointed about
the outcome of the election," said
freshman Francisco Luongo. "I
think people will realize their mis
take in four years."
Freshman Niko Malkovich
shared in this sense of disappoint
ment. describing himself as "ap
palled and disenchanted."
While still upset, some stu
dents hoped that Bush might alter
his tone in his next term.
"I'm clearly very sad about the
outcome of the election, but I'm
optimistic about the next four
years because it can't get much
worse," said junior Andrew
Ardinger. "He's either going to

become thoughtful and centrist,
or he's going to kill us all. Some
thing is going to change."
Many students said that they
expected more from the Ameri
can people, and hoped that in the
future citizens would research the
issues in more depth before head
ing to the voting booth. One inter
national student urged Americans
to examine international relations
more closely.
"I'm really upset because I
think the election results show
that Americans don't care about
international policy and about
what's going on around the
world." said freshman Melis Yil
man.
Although Republicans were
scarce, those found were opti
mistic about the future of the
country.
"I am thrilled about the re
sults of the election and believe
