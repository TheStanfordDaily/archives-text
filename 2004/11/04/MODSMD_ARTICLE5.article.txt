# Big Fix may be big risk, say RCCs

Residential Computing is en
couraging students to install its anti
virus program, Big Fix. but some
Residential Computing Coordina
tors are wary of the new software,
which tracks and stores information
from client computers.
Big Fix manages Microsoft Win
dows and Symantec Antivirus, up
dating system patches and keeping
virus definition current. According
to Richard Holeton, head of
ResC'omp, Stanford's Information
Technology Systems and Services
chose to employ the commercial
program after an attack on the Uni
versity's network in August 2003
that left 7,000 computers infected
and caused $900,000 worth of pro
ductivity losses.
The failure of students, faculty
and staff to update their anti-virus
programs made the network vulner
able to attack in that case, he said.
But Big Fix has some worried
about privacy issues. The program
has the ability to track a variety of
information from computers, rang
ing from a client machine's serial
number, model type and IP address
to the versions of Windows and
Symantec running.
In an effort to allay privacy con
cerns, ITSS has stressed on its Web
site's frequently asked questions
page that the "Big Fix will permit
authorized staff to collect certain
data about your computer . . . but
does not collect data files from your
computer." Holeton added that
only a small subset of information is
being collected.
But some RCCs are discourag
ing their residents from installing
the Big Fix program.
"The program has the ability to
track a ridiculous amount of infor
mation," said senior Jamie Fitzger
ald. a RCC in Eucalipto. "The
worry is that if the school was sub
poenaed or sued, they might turn
over the data they've collected, or
maybe even use it themselves. I'm
not recommending people down
load the program, especially since
Windows updates itself automati
cally."
According to the ITSS Web site,
the information collection is in fact
"subject to University policies, laws
and subpoena power."
Qther RCCs said they alert stu-
Other RCCs said they alert stu
dents to Big Fix's potential privacy
issues.
"I inform residents about Big Fix
and the information it collects and
let the user make the choice," said
senior Kelly Garneski, a RCC in
Toyon. "If they are reasonably
savvy and don't want to install Big-
Fix for privacy or other reasons, 1
help them make sure their antivirus
software is properly installed and
set their Windows to automatically
download updates."
Holeton added that ResComp is
working to limit possible privacy is
sues.
"In the next release of Big Fix,
ResComp may be able to reduce the
information collected from student
machines to the bare minimum."
