"Canada is a great, peace-loving
country with lots of open space,
clean water, and opportunities for
the future ... but we don't have
enough people." said Manitoba Pre
mier Gary Doer during a visit to
campus last month. The purpose of
his visit was.in part, to recruit skilled
workers to emigrate to Canada upon
graduation from Stanford. His ad
dress to students was part of a work
shop called is Your Future in Cana
da?" that was sponsored by the Stan
ford Canadian Club in conjunction
with the Canadian Consulate of Los
Angeles.

All jokes aside, a fair number of
Stanford students consider relocat
ing to Canada upon graduation each
year. The option is attractive to in
ternational graduate students in
technology fields since permanent
residency is easier to obtain in Cana
da than in the United States. This im
migration policy is. in large part, a re
sult of the Canada's "brain drain" —
top Canadian students are often

as the number one place in the world
to live. He stressed the advantages of
Canada's public health care system,
the international flavor of the city of
Winnipeg and the low cost of living
in Manitoba.
"You can have a 2,500 square
foot, four-bedroom home and cot
tage on the lake for $200,000." Doer
said to a standing-room-only crowd
of more than 1(X) students in Tresid
der Oak Room West.
International graduate students,
particularly South Asian students,
comprised the majority of the audi
ence. The keynote address was fol
lowed by a presentation by immigra
tion consul David Lupul on the
process of applying for permanent
residency in Canada. Lupul said that
about 20 students remained after the

talk to ask specific questions about
the process of moving to Canada.
"We're targeting what we call a
niche market," Lupul said after the
workshop. "We're targeting people
that are the most talented among
skilled workers and who are mobile,
meaning those don't have long-term
residency in the United States."
Johnny Matta was one of those
mobile skilled workers. A Lebanese
citizen, Matta earned his masters de
gree in electrical engineering at
Stanford several years ago and
worked in the Bay Area afterward.
He started to take a serious look at
moving to Canada after Silicon Val
ley's job market took a turn for the
worse. One year and $1,000 later,
Matta achieved permanent resi
dency in Canada. He moved to

Montreal in April 2003 and plans to
become a citizen within the next two
years.
"I had family and friends in Cana
da, and immigration was easier
there," Matta said. "I experienced
some immigration difficulty in the
United States because 1 needed em
ployer sponsorship to file my papers
and I couldn't get that."
Matta reported that more than
half of his non-American friends de
cided to immigrate to Canada after
earning advanced electrical engi
neering degrees in the United States.
They cited ease of immigration as a
primary motive for their decisions.

points-based application form. Ac
cording to Lupul, applicants who
have earned a university degree and
who have a minimum of one year
working experience almost always
have enough points to qualify for
permanent residency.
The American process for skilled
workers, however, requires that the
applicant's employer essentially
prove that the prospective perma
nent resident performs a job that no
other American has the skills to per
form. The task can take more than
five years.
The Canadian immigration
process is particularly attractive for
people who want to start small busi
nesses, said Matta, who is currently a
manager at a technology start-up in
Canada. The American process in
volves employer-sponsorship, which
is unavailable for start-up entrepre
neurs by nature of their occupation.
Many Canadian and other inter
national students apply for F-l visas
upon graduation. Director of Bech
tel International Center John Pear
son explained that these visas allow
for one year of practical job training
in America. The number of F-l visas
that Stanford processes has not
changed in recent years, he said, but
opportunities for more permanent
employment visas have been re
duced.
The United States used to issue
65.000 F-l visas per year, which al
lowed immigrants to work in Ameri
ca for three years with potential ex
tensions. In the late 19905, Congress
increased that quota to up to 180,000
visas to accommodate the growing
high-tech economy. In recent years,
however, that quota has come back
down to 65,000 visas a year.
"People can begin applying for F
-1 visas beginning on October 1, but
the quota is usually full by October

3," said Lupul.
The early October rush on F-l
visas may have helped explain the
large turnout at the Canadian work
shop later that month, Pearson said.
Just as graduates are considering
a move up North. Canadian gradu
ate students are continuing to come
to American universities like Stan
ford to be on the front lines of cut
ting-edge research, said Stephan
Mcßride, who is the finance minister
for the Stanford Canadian Club and
a doctoral candidate in economics.
Canada is the fourth-best-repre
sented country in Stanford's interna
tional population, coming in behind
China, India and South Korea.
After completing his masters at
Queens College, Mcßride did not
apply to any Ph.D. programs in
Canada. Like most Canadian stu
dents looking to pursue research,
Mcßride said his advisors encour
aged him to go overseas for his doc
toral degree and then maybe come
home afterwards.
Post-doctoral student in neurolo
gy Shannon Dunn also came to Stan
ford to pursue research upon the rec
ommendation of her academic advi
sors.
"The quality of research in sci
ence in the US seems to be regarded
as the next level up," said Dunn, 'it
is strongly encouraged for Canadi
ans to do their post-doc in the Unit
ed States for experience and then
come back. There is more money
and funding here, labs tend to be big
ger, and there are generally more re
sources."
The number of Canadian stu
dents studying at Stanford has
steadily increased from 138 in 1992
to 211 in 2003. Pearson explained
that the increase followed an overall
increase in the population of inter
national students at Stanford. He

noted, however, that increases in en
rollment from most countries had
leveled off in the past two years, but
Canadian enrollment had not.
"Research opportunities avail
able at Stanford still really do dwarf
opportunities at other universities
around the world in terms of funding
and cutting-edge work," said Pear
son.
Mcßride said that Canada has
been experiencing a "brain drain"
fora number of years now — more
Canadians have been receiving
Nobel Prizes for work done at
American universities than at Cana
dian universities. People affiliated
with Canada either through birth,
citizenship or residency have re
ceived five prizes over the past 10
years, but only one has done his re
search in Canada. Two of the Nobel
laureates — Michael Spence and
Myron Scholes — are currently at
Stanford.
Many Canadian students and
scholars feel a sense of conflict be
tween their desire to pursue cutting
edge research in the United States
and their desire to return home, said
Mcßride, who said he has experi
enced this conflict himself and has
heard it from friends, particularly
those in the engineering field.
Mcßride and Dunn both said they
also felt a sense of duty to serve their
country.
"I felt some obligation to return
to Canada at the beginning of my
time here because I had been sup
ported by the Canadian government
throughout my education; they
trained me and paid for me to come
here for my first two years," Dunn
said. "But as time goes on, that's less
of a concern."
Dunn said Canada's health care
system, cost of living and environ
ment would be factors that might

Immigration offsets 'brain drain'

eventually attract her back home.
Proximity to family and the possibil
ity of a job in Canadian academia as
the baby-boomer generation begins
to retire would also be primary fac
tors to consider.
"If the worst of anything conceiv
able hit Canada, I'd be back in a sec
ond," Mcßride said. "I do feel a duty
to my country and will go home, but
if it is not pressing I won't go back
the day after I leave here."
Premier Doer had lunch with
about 25 Canadian students before
his speech earlier this month.
Mcßride said the tone at the lunch
was different than the address, which
was designed to recruit workers to
Canada.
"We really enjoyed the time to
gether and the Canadian cama
raderie," Mcßride said. "Canada
certainly has a draw fora lot of us."
Others agreed.
"I have watched students struggle
over the question of whether to stay
in America or go back to their home
county. People change as they grow
older and as more opportunities are
offered to them," said Pearson, a
British citizen who has finally decid
ed to apply for American citizenship
after becoming a permanent resi
dent in the early 19705. "Yet they
still have ties to their home country,
both familial and philosophical
obligations."
"That challenge is faced again
and again as international students
move from undergraduate to gradu
ate programs and as they move from
graduate programs to H-l visas,"
Pearson continued. "It's less com
mon to see that struggle with Cana
dians — the proximity of the coun

"You can have a 2,500 square
foot, four-bedroom home and cot
tage on the lake for $200,000." Doer
said to a standing-room-only crowd
of more than 1(X) students in Tresid
der Oak Room West.
International graduate students,
particularly South Asian students,
comprised the majority of the audi
ence. The keynote address was fol
lowed by a presentation by immigra
tion consul David Lupul on the
process of applying for permanent
residency in Canada. Lupul said that
about 20 students remained after the

talk to ask specific questions about
the process of moving to Canada.
"We're targeting what we call a
niche market," Lupul said after the
workshop. "We're targeting people
that are the most talented among
skilled workers and who are mobile,
meaning those don't have long-term
residency in the United States."
Johnny Matta was one of those
mobile skilled workers. A Lebanese
citizen, Matta earned his masters de
gree in electrical engineering at
Stanford several years ago and
worked in the Bay Area afterward.
He started to take a serious look at
moving to Canada after Silicon Val
ley's job market took a turn for the
worse. One year and $1,000 later,
Matta achieved permanent resi
dency in Canada. He moved to

Montreal in April 2003 and plans to
become a citizen within the next two
years.
"I had family and friends in Cana
da, and immigration was easier
there," Matta said. "I experienced
some immigration difficulty in the
United States because 1 needed em
ployer sponsorship to file my papers
and I couldn't get that."
Matta reported that more than
half of his non-American friends de
cided to immigrate to Canada after
earning advanced electrical engi
neering degrees in the United States.
They cited ease of immigration as a
primary motive for their decisions.

points-based application form. Ac
cording to Lupul, applicants who
have earned a university degree and
who have a minimum of one year
working experience almost always
have enough points to qualify for
permanent residency.
The American process for skilled
workers, however, requires that the
applicant's employer essentially
prove that the prospective perma
nent resident performs a job that no
other American has the skills to per
form. The task can take more than
five years.
The Canadian immigration
process is particularly attractive for
people who want to start small busi
nesses, said Matta, who is currently a
manager at a technology start-up in
Canada. The American process in
volves employer-sponsorship, which
is unavailable for start-up entrepre
neurs by nature of their occupation.
Many Canadian and other inter
national students apply for F-l visas
upon graduation. Director of Bech
tel International Center John Pear
son explained that these visas allow
for one year of practical job training
in America. The number of F-l visas
that Stanford processes has not
changed in recent years, he said, but
opportunities for more permanent
employment visas have been re
duced.
The United States used to issue
65.000 F-l visas per year, which al
lowed immigrants to work in Ameri
ca for three years with potential ex
tensions. In the late 19905, Congress
increased that quota to up to 180,000
visas to accommodate the growing
high-tech economy. In recent years,
however, that quota has come back
down to 65,000 visas a year.
"People can begin applying for F
-1 visas beginning on October 1, but
the quota is usually full by October

3," said Lupul.
The early October rush on F-l
visas may have helped explain the
large turnout at the Canadian work
shop later that month, Pearson said.
Just as graduates are considering
a move up North. Canadian gradu
ate students are continuing to come
to American universities like Stan
ford to be on the front lines of cut
ting-edge research, said Stephan
Mcßride, who is the finance minister
for the Stanford Canadian Club and
a doctoral candidate in economics.
Canada is the fourth-best-repre
sented country in Stanford's interna
tional population, coming in behind
China, India and South Korea.
After completing his masters at
Queens College, Mcßride did not
apply to any Ph.D. programs in
Canada. Like most Canadian stu
dents looking to pursue research,
Mcßride said his advisors encour
aged him to go overseas for his doc
toral degree and then maybe come
home afterwards.
Post-doctoral student in neurolo
gy Shannon Dunn also came to Stan
ford to pursue research upon the rec
ommendation of her academic advi
sors.
"The quality of research in sci
ence in the US seems to be regarded
as the next level up," said Dunn, 'it
is strongly encouraged for Canadi
ans to do their post-doc in the Unit
ed States for experience and then
come back. There is more money
and funding here, labs tend to be big
ger, and there are generally more re
sources."
The number of Canadian stu
dents studying at Stanford has
steadily increased from 138 in 1992
to 211 in 2003. Pearson explained
that the increase followed an overall
increase in the population of inter
national students at Stanford. He

noted, however, that increases in en
rollment from most countries had
leveled off in the past two years, but
Canadian enrollment had not.
"Research opportunities avail
able at Stanford still really do dwarf
opportunities at other universities
around the world in terms of funding
and cutting-edge work," said Pear
son.
Mcßride said that Canada has
been experiencing a "brain drain"
fora number of years now — more
Canadians have been receiving
Nobel Prizes for work done at
American universities than at Cana
dian universities. People affiliated
with Canada either through birth,
citizenship or residency have re
ceived five prizes over the past 10
years, but only one has done his re
search in Canada. Two of the Nobel
laureates — Michael Spence and
Myron Scholes — are currently at
Stanford.
Many Canadian students and
scholars feel a sense of conflict be
tween their desire to pursue cutting
edge research in the United States
and their desire to return home, said
Mcßride, who said he has experi
enced this conflict himself and has
heard it from friends, particularly
those in the engineering field.
Mcßride and Dunn both said they
also felt a sense of duty to serve their
country.
"I felt some obligation to return
to Canada at the beginning of my
time here because I had been sup
ported by the Canadian government
throughout my education; they
trained me and paid for me to come
here for my first two years," Dunn
said. "But as time goes on, that's less
of a concern."
Dunn said Canada's health care
system, cost of living and environ
ment would be factors that might

Immigration offsets 'brain drain'

eventually attract her back home.
Proximity to family and the possibil
ity of a job in Canadian academia as
the baby-boomer generation begins
to retire would also be primary fac
tors to consider.
"If the worst of anything conceiv
able hit Canada, I'd be back in a sec
ond," Mcßride said. "I do feel a duty
to my country and will go home, but
if it is not pressing I won't go back
the day after I leave here."
Premier Doer had lunch with
about 25 Canadian students before
his speech earlier this month.
Mcßride said the tone at the lunch
was different than the address, which
was designed to recruit workers to
Canada.
"We really enjoyed the time to
gether and the Canadian cama
raderie," Mcßride said. "Canada
certainly has a draw fora lot of us."
Others agreed.
"I have watched students struggle
over the question of whether to stay
in America or go back to their home
county. People change as they grow
older and as more opportunities are
offered to them," said Pearson, a
British citizen who has finally decid
ed to apply for American citizenship
after becoming a permanent resi
dent in the early 19705. "Yet they
still have ties to their home country,
both familial and philosophical
obligations."
"That challenge is faced again
and again as international students
move from undergraduate to gradu
ate programs and as they move from
graduate programs to H-l visas,"
Pearson continued. "It's less com
mon to see that struggle with Cana

to live. He stressed the advantages of
Canada's public health care system,
the international flavor of the city of
Winnipeg and the low cost of living
in Manitoba.
"You can have a 2,500 square
foot, four-bedroom home and cot
tage on the lake for $200,000." Doer
said to a standing-room-only crowd
of more than 1(X) students in Tresid
der Oak Room West.
International graduate students,
particularly South Asian students,
comprised the majority of the audi
ence. The keynote address was fol
lowed by a presentation by immigra
tion consul David Lupul on the
process of applying for permanent
residency in Canada. Lupul said that
about 20 students remained after the

talk to ask specific questions about
the process of moving to Canada.
"We're targeting what we call a
niche market," Lupul said after the
workshop. "We're targeting people
that are the most talented among
skilled workers and who are mobile,
meaning those don't have long-term
residency in the United States."
Johnny Matta was one of those
mobile skilled workers. A Lebanese
citizen, Matta earned his masters de
gree in electrical engineering at
Stanford several years ago and
worked in the Bay Area afterward.
He started to take a serious look at
moving to Canada after Silicon Val
ley's job market took a turn for the
worse. One year and $1,000 later,
Matta achieved permanent resi
dency in Canada. He moved to

Montreal in April 2003 and plans to
become a citizen within the next two
years.
"I had family and friends in Cana
da, and immigration was easier
there," Matta said. "I experienced
some immigration difficulty in the
United States because 1 needed em
ployer sponsorship to file my papers
and I couldn't get that."
Matta reported that more than
half of his non-American friends de
cided to immigrate to Canada after
earning advanced electrical engi
neering degrees in the United States.
They cited ease of immigration as a
primary motive for their decisions.

points-based application form. Ac
cording to Lupul, applicants who
have earned a university degree and
who have a minimum of one year
working experience almost always
have enough points to qualify for
permanent residency.
The American process for skilled
workers, however, requires that the
applicant's employer essentially
prove that the prospective perma
nent resident performs a job that no
other American has the skills to per
form. The task can take more than
five years.
The Canadian immigration
process is particularly attractive for
people who want to start small busi
nesses, said Matta, who is currently a
manager at a technology start-up in
Canada. The American process in
volves employer-sponsorship, which
is unavailable for start-up entrepre
neurs by nature of their occupation.
Many Canadian and other inter
national students apply for F-l visas
upon graduation. Director of Bech
tel International Center John Pear
son explained that these visas allow
for one year of practical job training
in America. The number of F-l visas
that Stanford processes has not
changed in recent years, he said, but
opportunities for more permanent
employment visas have been re
duced.
The United States used to issue
65.000 F-l visas per year, which al
lowed immigrants to work in Ameri
ca for three years with potential ex
tensions. In the late 19905, Congress
increased that quota to up to 180,000
visas to accommodate the growing
high-tech economy. In recent years,
however, that quota has come back
down to 65,000 visas a year.
"People can begin applying for F
-1 visas beginning on October 1, but
the quota is usually full by October

3," said Lupul.
The early October rush on F-l
visas may have helped explain the
large turnout at the Canadian work
shop later that month, Pearson said.
Just as graduates are considering
a move up North. Canadian gradu
ate students are continuing to come
to American universities like Stan
ford to be on the front lines of cut
ting-edge research, said Stephan
Mcßride, who is the finance minister
for the Stanford Canadian Club and
a doctoral candidate in economics.
Canada is the fourth-best-repre
sented country in Stanford's interna
tional population, coming in behind
China, India and South Korea.
After completing his masters at
Queens College, Mcßride did not
apply to any Ph.D. programs in
Canada. Like most Canadian stu
dents looking to pursue research,
Mcßride said his advisors encour
aged him to go overseas for his doc
toral degree and then maybe come
home afterwards.
Post-doctoral student in neurolo
gy Shannon Dunn also came to Stan
ford to pursue research upon the rec
ommendation of her academic advi
sors.
"The quality of research in sci
ence in the US seems to be regarded
as the next level up," said Dunn, 'it
is strongly encouraged for Canadi
ans to do their post-doc in the Unit
ed States for experience and then
come back. There is more money
and funding here, labs tend to be big
ger, and there are generally more re
sources."
The number of Canadian stu
dents studying at Stanford has
steadily increased from 138 in 1992
to 211 in 2003. Pearson explained
that the increase followed an overall
increase in the population of inter
national students at Stanford. He

noted, however, that increases in en
rollment from most countries had
leveled off in the past two years, but
Canadian enrollment had not.
"Research opportunities avail
able at Stanford still really do dwarf
opportunities at other universities
around the world in terms of funding
and cutting-edge work," said Pear
son.
Mcßride said that Canada has
been experiencing a "brain drain"
fora number of years now — more
Canadians have been receiving
Nobel Prizes for work done at
American universities than at Cana
dian universities. People affiliated
with Canada either through birth,
citizenship or residency have re
ceived five prizes over the past 10
years, but only one has done his re
search in Canada. Two of the Nobel
laureates — Michael Spence and
Myron Scholes — are currently at
Stanford.
Many Canadian students and
scholars feel a sense of conflict be
tween their desire to pursue cutting
edge research in the United States
and their desire to return home, said
Mcßride, who said he has experi
enced this conflict himself and has
heard it from friends, particularly
those in the engineering field.
Mcßride and Dunn both said they
also felt a sense of duty to serve their
country.
"I felt some obligation to return
to Canada at the beginning of my
time here because I had been sup
ported by the Canadian government
throughout my education; they
trained me and paid for me to come
here for my first two years," Dunn
said. "But as time goes on, that's less
of a concern."
Dunn said Canada's health care
system, cost of living and environ
ment would be factors that might

Immigration offsets 'brain drain'

eventually attract her back home.
Proximity to family and the possibil
ity of a job in Canadian academia as
the baby-boomer generation begins
to retire would also be primary fac
tors to consider.
"If the worst of anything conceiv
able hit Canada, I'd be back in a sec
ond," Mcßride said. "I do feel a duty
to my country and will go home, but
if it is not pressing I won't go back
the day after I leave here."
Premier Doer had lunch with
about 25 Canadian students before
his speech earlier this month.
Mcßride said the tone at the lunch
was different than the address, which
was designed to recruit workers to
Canada.
"We really enjoyed the time to
gether and the Canadian cama
raderie," Mcßride said. "Canada
certainly has a draw fora lot of us."
Others agreed.
"I have watched students struggle
over the question of whether to stay
in America or go back to their home
county. People change as they grow
older and as more opportunities are
offered to them," said Pearson, a
British citizen who has finally decid
ed to apply for American citizenship
after becoming a permanent resi
dent in the early 19705. "Yet they
still have ties to their home country,
both familial and philosophical
obligations."
"That challenge is faced again
and again as international students
move from undergraduate to gradu
ate programs and as they move from
graduate programs to H-l visas,"
Pearson continued. "It's less com
mon to see that struggle with Cana
dians — the proximity of the coun
try is more conducive to the feeling
that it's easier for them to get home."

salaries and research opportunities
are greater.
"Canada is a great, peace-loving
country with lots of open space,
clean water, and opportunities for
the future ... but we don't have
enough people." said Manitoba Pre
mier Gary Doer during a visit to
campus last month. The purpose of
his visit was.in part, to recruit skilled
workers to emigrate to Canada upon
graduation from Stanford. His ad
dress to students was part of a work
shop called is Your Future in Cana
da?" that was sponsored by the Stan
ford Canadian Club in conjunction
with the Canadian Consulate of Los
Angeles.
Doer pointed out that the United
Nations consistentlv ranks Canada

Her roommate, senior Ming Zhu,

All jokes aside, a fair number of
Stanford students consider relocat
ing to Canada upon graduation each
year. The option is attractive to in
ternational graduate students in
technology fields since permanent
residency is easier to obtain in Cana
da than in the United States. This im
