"Canada is a great, peace-loving
country with lots of open space,
clean water, and opportunities for
the future ... but we don't have
enough people." said Manitoba Pre
mier Gary Doer during a visit to
campus last month. The purpose of
his visit was.in part, to recruit skilled
workers to emigrate to Canada upon
graduation from Stanford. His ad
dress to students was part of a work
shop called is Your Future in Cana
da?" that was sponsored by the Stan
ford Canadian Club in conjunction
with the Canadian Consulate of Los
Angeles.
Doer pointed out that the United
Nations consistentlv ranks Canada

"I'm moving to Canada!" senior
Emily Ochoa said Tuesday night.
Her roommate, senior Ming Zhu,
chuckled and checked out a satirical
Web site called marryacandian.com
to see if she could find a cute Canuck
to take her and Ochoa up North.
All jokes aside, a fair number of
Stanford students consider relocat
ing to Canada upon graduation each
year. The option is attractive to in
ternational graduate students in
technology fields since permanent
residency is easier to obtain in Cana
da than in the United States. This im
migration policy is. in large part, a re
sult of the Canada's "brain drain" â€”
top Canadian students are often

as the number one place in the world
to live. He stressed the advantages of
Canada's public health care system,
the international flavor of the city of
Winnipeg and the low cost of living
in Manitoba.
"You can have a 2,500 square
foot, four-bedroom home and cot
tage on the lake for $200,000." Doer
said to a standing-room-only crowd
of more than 1(X) students in Tresid
der Oak Room West.
International graduate students,
particularly South Asian students,
comprised the majority of the audi
ence. The keynote address was fol
lowed by a presentation by immigra
tion consul David Lupul on the
process of applying for permanent
residency in Canada. Lupul said that
about 20 students remained after the

talk to ask specific questions about
the process of moving to Canada.
"We're targeting what we call a
niche market," Lupul said after the
workshop. "We're targeting people
that are the most talented among
skilled workers and who are mobile,
meaning those don't have long-term
residency in the United States."
Johnny Matta was one of those
mobile skilled workers. A Lebanese
citizen, Matta earned his masters de
gree in electrical engineering at
Stanford several years ago and
worked in the Bay Area afterward.
He started to take a serious look at
moving to Canada after Silicon Val
ley's job market took a turn for the
worse. One year and $1,000 later,
Matta achieved permanent resi
dency in Canada. He moved to

Montreal in April 2003 and plans to
become a citizen within the next two
years.
"I had family and friends in Cana
da, and immigration was easier
there," Matta said. "I experienced
some immigration difficulty in the
United States because 1 needed em
ployer sponsorship to file my papers
and I couldn't get that."
Matta reported that more than
half of his non-American friends de
cided to immigrate to Canada after
earning advanced electrical engi
neering degrees in the United States.
They cited ease of immigration as a
primary motive for their decisions.
