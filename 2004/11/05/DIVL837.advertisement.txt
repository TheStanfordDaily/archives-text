Tivo-SidcJ Clocks? I
One word frees us from all the weight and pain of life. That word is love.
—Sophocles
Tliis Sunday young families exploring how to make humane living more real in everyday life
gather to create two-sided paper clocks. The clocks are one way to remind family members that
no matter what is happening at any given minute, behind the daily TIME clock is an always
NOW clock of love. Every week the I lumanist Community's Family Assembly convenes to talk
together, sing songs, and read a picture book that provokes thought about living a caring and
productive life. This week's story features a little Raccoon who wants to know when exactly
during the day his mother loves him most. The theme question is, "How can we feel loved no
matter how we or others are acting?"
Family Assembly gathers from 10:45 AM to 12:15 PM
at Mitchell Park Community Center
}BCO Middlefield Road, near Charleston, in Palo Alto.
