# Down the stretch they come
## Sun Devils are the surprise of the Pac-10 thus far 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a very tight Pacific-10 Conference
race, three teams have established them
selves among the nation's elite. USC. Cal
and Stanford's opponent tomorrow, Ari
zona State, are all ranked in the Top 25
in the country. Of those three teams,
Arizona State is the lone surprise.
Granted, the Sun Devils have one of
the best quarterbacks in the Pac-10 in se
nior Andrew Walter and an offensive
unit that can put up big numbers, but
they struggled last year, finishing a dis
appointing 5-7. It did not come as a
shock to most people that the Sun Devils
were picked to finish sixth in the confer
ence in the Pac-10 Preseason Media Poll.
But things have gone better than ex
pected this season for Arizona State (6-
2,3-2), which is ranked No. 23 in the na
tion. Its only losses have come to No. 1
USC and No. 4 Cal. both on the road.
Despite the record and the ranking,
there is still concern among Arizona
State supporters. It is the way that the
Sun Devils lost the games to USC and
Cal that casts a shadow on an otherwise
terrific season.
Three weeks ago, the Trojans domi
nated the Sun Devils in almost every as
pect of the game, building a 42-7 half
time lead and ultimately winning 45-7.
Walter was held to 181 yards passing
and threw two interceptions and no
touchdowns. The defense gave up 446
yards of total offense.
Last week the Sun Devils suffered a
27-0 loss at the hands of the Bears, the
first time Arizona State was held score
less since 1995.
Again, the defense couldn't stop a po
tent offense, giving up 234 yards on the
ground, including 188 yards by star tail
back J.J. Arrington.

"Cal is a terrific football team and de
serves to be where they're at, but we did
a lot of things to beat ourselves," Ari
zona State head coach Dirk Koetter said.
"We didn't put our best foot forward in
that game. Our team should not feel
good about that."
It is surprising that both losses came
by such large margins, especially since

the Sun Devils opened the season with
five straight wins, including two over
teams that are now ranked in the Top 25
in the nation.

Arizona State defeated No. 23 UTEP
41-9 to open the season, but its biggest
win came two weeks later against then
No. 16 lowa. Walter threw for 428 yards
and five touchdowns in the 44-7 victory.
The Sun Devils also picked up two
wins to open the Pac-10 season, defeat
ing Oregon State at home before beating
Oregon at Autzen Stadium.

The biggest indicator of the Sun Dev
ils' game-by-game success this season
has been how well Walter has been able
to pass the football.

In the Sun Devils' two losses, Walter
threw for only 209.5 yards per game. In
the team's six wins, he threw for 277
yards per game. He has thrown 21 touch
down passes in six wins, hut none in two
losses. Of Walter's seven interceptions
on the season, three came against USC
and Cal.
"We just killed ourselves all day,"
Walter said about the Cal game. "When
it's your fault, you put the blame on
yourself and move on. We moved the
ball and I thought we had good play calls;
good execution on some plays and on
some drives. We just killed ourselves
when we got into scoring position."
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens
knows that Walter is the key to Arizona
State's success.
"Arizona State's offense is explosive,
and Andrew Walter is as good as any
quarterback in the league," Teevens
said. "We want to keep them on the side
lines as best we can."
Tomorrow's matchup is critical for
both Arizona State and Stanford. If Wal
ter is able to get back on track, he could
virtually end the bowl hopes of the Car
dinal single-handedly.
Though they're already bowl eligible,
a loss for the Sun Devils could drop them
to fifth or sixth in a very competitive Pac
-10 conference.
"We do have a chance to have an out
standing season," Koetter said. "Not
many people would have picked us to be
6-2 at this point of the season other than
our own players and coaches. It's way too
dangerous to look ahead any further than
one week. We have to treat this like it's the
biggest game of the year, because it is."
If the Cardinal can contain Walter
they will play the spoiler for Arizona
State while keeping their bowl chances
alive. If not, the odds of a winning season
for the Cardinal will get even slimmer.

Junior T.J. Rushing returns a kick against Oregon earlier this season. With the offense sputtering the past two weeks, the Cardinal could use a jurnpstart from their special
teams unit tomorrow in a conference showdown at Arizona State. Kickoff is scheduled for 3:30 p.m.


MATT COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily
J.R. Lemon rushed for 156 yards and two touchdowns in Stanford's 38-27 victory
over Arizona State last season. The Sun Devils are 6-2 entering tomorrow's game.
