### JESSICA LIN 
The South Asian Sister, a Bay
Area cultural group, will perform to
morrow night a South Asian version
of the Vagina Monologues in Cub
berley Auditorium. "Yoni Ki Baat:
Talks of the Vagina," is hosted by
Saheli, Stanford's South Asian
Women's Alliance, and Sanskiti. the
Stanford's South Asian cultural
group.
"The Vagina Monologues has re
ceived such positive feedback on this
campus, and we hope to create the
same sense of empowerment and
pride in the women who see this
South Asian version, particularly
those who can relate specifically to
cultural and gender issues that the
play addresses," said senior Shilpi
Agarwal, a member of Saheli.
The South Asian Sisters compiled
the script from the submissions of
various South Asian students and
adults in the Bay Area. This version
advocates sexual empowerment in
the same way that the Vagina Mono
logues does. but "Yoni Ki Baat" also
applies the concepts specifically to
South Asian women.
The performance will address the
cultural issues faced by many South
Asian women, especially those who
were raised in the United States but
whose parents immigrated to this
country. They may be conflicted
about the conservative ideas of sex

that arc an integral part of their cul
ture and the more expressive view
that is part of American society, said
Agarwal.
"It's often hard for young South
Asian women here in America to
reconcile the ideas of modesty and
relative conservatism that pervade
the Indian culture with the fact that
empowerment extends beyond just
educational achievement, hut also to
one's body," Agarwal said. "Because
sex is a relatively taboo topic in many
South Asian households, it's impor
tant to remind South Asian women
that they have the right to express
themselves sexually and should not
be ashamed of being strong women
with needs and desires."
Saheli has been advertising on

campus and around the Bay Area for
the South Asian Sister, which is mak
ing its first appearance at Stanford.
Saheli is primarily a support and dis
cussion group that holds weekly
meetings pertaining to feminism and
South Asian women.
"This show was an opportunity
we could not pass up," Agarwal said.
"We are all very excited about bring
ing 'Yoni Ki Baat' onto campus. Al
though none of us are actually in
volved in the performance, we are
advertising all around campus to en
sure that the performance gets the
attention and recognition that it de
serves.
The performance is at 8 p.m.
Tickets arc $8 presale and $10 at the
door.
