U-WIRE- WASHINGTON -
"We don't have a football team here
at [American University]," said pro
fessor James Thurber, director of
the Center for Congressional and
Presidential Studies, giving welcom
ing remarks to a large audience gath
ered to watch Wednesday's post
election forum. "What we do have is
a blood sport. And it's called poli
tics."
What followed was a political de
bate in which experts discussed the
implementation and impact of Pres
ident George W. Bush's re-election.
They covered a range of topics, from
voting machines to partial-birth
abortion, from ads to administra
tion. and from voter turnout to con
gressional redistricting.
Topics that received special focus
included what John F. Kerry and the
Democrats did wrong, and how the
election process can be improved.
Pollster Glen Bolger and professors
Karen O'Connor. Robert Pastor.
Jamin Raskin and Leonard Stein
horn responded to questions posed
by Thurber as well as members of
the public and AU community.
Asked whv Bush won the Mid

west. South and Ohio, Bolger re
sponded by stating that Bush's cam
paign displayed a clearer focus and
more discipline in its approach.
Pointing to the overwhelming pas
sage of gay marriage bans, Bolger
stated that Bush's emphasis on fam
ily values and moral issues played a
key role in his victory.
O'Connor, a government profes
sor and director of the Women's and
Politics Institute, agreed.
"Morals ended up one of the
biggest issues in this campaign," she
said, adding that this surprised
Democrats, who expected the situa
tion in Iraq and the economy to play
more important roles in the election.
According to the panelists, a
main reason this focus changed was
Bush's effective mobilization of the
Evangelical Christian vote, particu
larly in the South.
"[Senior adviser to the president!
Karl Rove understood early on that
this election would really be the cul
mination of what started in the early
1970s when Richard Nixon created
the Southern strategy." said Stein
horn, a School of Communication
professor who taught PR and the
Presidency this semester.
"Karl Rove could run up big
numbers in the South.... That's why
they had the gay marriage issues on

11 states throughout the country."
Asked later if Democrats can ap
peal to Southern, Evangelical vot
ers, O'Connor expressed doubt.
"Florida is probably [their] only
chance," she said, pointing out that
the Southwest is more likely to vote
Democratic than the South.
The panelists also expressed con
cerns about the administration and
structure of the American voting
system. "Administration was proba
bly as bad as it was in 2(XM)." said Pas
tor. director of AU's Center for
Democracy and Election Manage
ment.
Pastor added that the problems
weren't as visible because of Kerry's
quick concession. Pastor mentioned
faulty machines and provisional bal
lots as two of the largest concerns in
the election.
The lack of an impartial, nonpar
tisan commission to supervise voting
is a major problem in the United
States, said Raskin, a Washington
College of Law professor. "We have
partisan elected officials... it creates
a structural conflict of interest to
make hundreds of decisions a week
that affect the structure of voting."
Raskin said.
Expressing frustration with a
