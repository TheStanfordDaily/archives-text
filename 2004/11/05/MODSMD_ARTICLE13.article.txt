cial election results from seven main
polling locations on the University
of Michigan campus, nearly I MHM)
students voted. Overall, 120 million
people voted in the election.
"We had a great turnout, and I

this election was to our generation,"

Michigan Student Assembly's Voice
Your Vote Commission.
Voice Your Vote is a nonpartisan

group that focuses on registering
new voters and promoting political
participation on campus.

Since the 2000 election, the num
ber of youth voters at the polls in
creased by 4.6 million. The turnout
rate rose from about 42 percent to 52
percent.
"I think a lot of students were
concerned about who was going to
be the next president, which is
unique. In years past it hasn't mat
tered so much which actual candi
date won, so much as which party
was elected," said engineering fresh
man Sean Murphy, who voted ab
sentee in Massachusetts.
In some states, youth voters
turned out just as much as older vot
ers in proportion to their population.

ln the 10 most contested "battle
ground" states, youth turnout was 64
percent, up 13 percentage points
from the 20(H) election.
"Young people are definitely
more interested than they were four
years ago. They're more invested in
their community," Teresi said.
She said young people have more
concerns tied into the election, for
example the war in Iraq and how
they plan to pay for college.
The economy and the possibility
of a draft were issues that motivated
freshman George Thomas to vote.
"The issues that most concerned
me were jobs, the war in Iraq, tax
cuts for the rich and a possible
draft," Thomas said.
Other students, like freshman
Alyse Dunn, voted because of con
troversial proposals on the ballot.
"I voted in Ohio. I was most con
cerned with the proposal that would

ban gay marriage," Dunn said.
Ohio Issue 1, the proposal that
bans same-sex marriage in the state,
passed with 62 percent of the vote.
Exit polls showed that among voters
ages IK through 2 l ), 51 percent voted
'yes' and 49 percent voted 'no.'
More than KM) organizations in
the Youth Vote Coalition devoted
their efforts to raising youth partici
pation in the election. Partners in the
Coalition include MTV's "Choose
or Lose," Project Vote Smart, Speak
Out, and World Wrestling Enter
tainment's "Smackdown Your
Vote!" The organizations had a goal
of bringing 20 million youths out to
the polls.
The Youth Vote Coalition set up
field sites in Ann Arbor and East
Lansing, Mich., to help build local
coalitions, which focused mainly on
door knocking and calling young
voters.
