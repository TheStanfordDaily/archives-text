Depression is a generally taboo sub
ject that few care to discuss. But in a
panel discussion Tuesday evening,
eight women of Sigma Delta sorority
were not afraid to speak openly and
candidly about their own experi
ences with depression and the de
pression of loved ones.
Dartmouth College students
often report being ashamed to admit
going through depression and feel
alone in their experiences. Junior

Susan Gordon spoke up about her
experience with Seasonal Affective
Disorder and not believing she de
served the title, as she was able to
cope during the day until the depres
sion set in at night. Gordon spoke to
the stigma of depression and about
not wanting anyone to know that the
feeling kept her up crying late at
night.
"No one wants to be friends with
the girl with issues," Gordon said.
Senior Lauren Maynard de
scribed the difficulty she felt trying
to play the role of the Dartmouth
student she thought she should be
while suffering from depression. UI

timately, Maynard had to take two
terms of medical leave in order to
deal with her condition.
"I outwardly tried to be perfect
and ran around at a thousand miles
an hour not wanting to stop for fear
of someone seeing me make a mis
take," Maynard said, "I would look
in the mirror and see worthlessness
and couldn't deal with it."
Senior Andrea Shute spoke
about her experience in a relation
ship with someone who is depressed
and the frustration of being happy
yourself while the person you love is
miserable.
"I started to isolate myself from

my friends in order to be there for
her more and more," Shute said,
"but no matter what I did, [she] al
ways felt alone."
Dartmouth's Health Services de
partment reports signs of depression
as: impaired concentration, inability
to experience pleasure, increase in
self-critical thoughts, sleep distur
bances. change in personality, in
creased isolation, decrease in ap
petite, feelings of guilt, helplessness
or hopelessness, thoughts of suicide,
feeling fatigued after 12 hours of
sleep, missing deadlines, increased
sexual promiscuity and increased al
cohol or drug use.
