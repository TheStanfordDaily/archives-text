In yesterday's story, * u Canadian premier encourages
Stanford students to head north," The Daily incorrectly
reported that the United States issues 65,000 F-l visas per
year. The United States actually issues 65,000 H-l visas
per year. All the references to "F-l visa" in the following
three paragraphs should read "H-l visa."
