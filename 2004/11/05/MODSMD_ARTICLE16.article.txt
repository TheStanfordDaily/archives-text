# UC-Davis law school student uncovers admissions disparity

### MELISSA B. TADDEI THE CALIFORNIA AGGIE (U. CALIFORNIA-DAVIS 
(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. - Sixty
years have passed since Brown v.
Board of Education, but some insti
tutionalized inequalities have yet to
be settled. University of California-
Davis School of Law student Kweli
Coleman won first place in the sec
ond National People of Color Schol
arship Conference "Emerging
Scholars" writing competition with
her essay: "A Dream Denied"- an
expos, of the racially disparate im
pacts of the use of Advanced Place
ment courses in California universi
ty admissions.
Coleman gathered data from
California high schools, the UC sys
tem and several private California
universities, including Stanford, be
fore reaching the conclusion that the
use of AP courses in determining ad
mission disadvantages students
coming from high schools where
they are not offered. The high
schools with the smallest offering of
AP courses are predominantly at
tended by Latino and African
American students. There is a com
plicated triangle of effects precipi
tated by socioeconomics, race and
education.
Coleman found as many as 25
percent of California high schools
offered no AP courses in 2001. On
the other hand, approximately 5 per
cent offered more than 20. Coleman
said she attended a high school
where only four AP courses were of
fered. While Stanford and other pri
vate institutions were found to be
using a relatively holistic approach
in admissions, the UCs did not.
For example, according to
UCLA's 2004 first-year profile, the
average incoming student has a 4.26
grade point average and has earned
18.6 AP units. While a student's per
sonal statement and challenges play
a role, it is obvious that certain
benchmarks have to be reached to
get in — for students whose schools
offer few or no A P courses, a weight
ed GPA and tacitly expected num
ber of AP courses leave them in the
dust.
UCD has a much more feasible
average GPA — — according to
a representative from the admis
sions office. In addition. UCD does
not track the number of AP courses

that applicants or those admitted
have taken. The representative said
that AP tests are not considered in
admissions.
While having not taken AP
courses does not automatically dis
qualify an applicant from the UC
system, Coleman's paper points out
that AP courses factor into the most
important aspects of the application
- college preparatory courses, stan
dardized tests and the uncapped
CPA.
Coleman said the uncapped GPA
is only beneficial to those students
who are offered AP courses. She
also found in her research that suc
cess on standardized tests is correlat
ed with AP courses in two ways —
first, the nature of the courses better
prepares students for standardized
testing, and second, AP course
teachers are more encouraging and
push students to pursue acceptance
to prestigious colleges.
The UCs have taken action to
even out the playing field in the
wake of lawsuits aimed at Berke
ley's admissions process, but there
remains a chasm between those high
school graduates who had many
available resources and those that
had few.
Coleman recommends in her
paper that students be evaluated on
the basis of how well they utilized
the resources that were available to
them and not be measured against
students with more opportunities.
Coleman said over 50 percent of
Berkeley students come from less
than 5 percent of California high
schools. Until AP courses are of
fered on an equal basis in schools,
there needs to be a more compre
hensive approach.
Coleman wrote the essay fora
Critical Race Theory seminar taught
by Associate Law School Dean
Kevin Johnson at King Hail last
spring. Johnson said the seminar fo
cused on contemporary issues of
race relations in the United States.
After hearing about the writing
competition, Coleman decided to
enter the essay in the hopes of get
ting published in either a law journal
or review.
Coleman said this issue extends
beyond an essay topic; it is a matter
of personal concern. She said, "We
should be careful that we are re
warding merit and not just privi
lege."
