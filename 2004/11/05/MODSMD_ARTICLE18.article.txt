## The
						Zagat guide to dating grads

You've all seen him. He's well
dressed, but not exceedingly hot
— standard Stanford faire.
Overall he looks normal, maybe he has
a few more crow's feet around the eyes,
but you chalk it up to sun exposure.
Maybe he's from the Florida Keys. Or a
cattle ranch in Montana.
He and his one friend approach.
Your posse goes all atwitter, and you
rock-paper-scissors for who has to go
talk to him. You lose. You go yammer
with him fora few seconds and then out
it comes, the exculpatory statement: "I
know, I'm a sketchy grad student."
At this point, instead of appeasing

him by joining in
his awkward
laughter, we
would choose to
answer without
amusement,
"Yes, yes you
are. But accept
ance is the first
step to healing."
As seniors,
we have decided
it is okay to step
gingerly within
the bounds of
the Land

O'Grad. However, it is not wise to
taste the fruits of every graduate
province, so to aid you in your quest
we've compiled a little dining guide
for the epicurean palate's pleasure.
Let us begin with Engineering
Ph.D. candidates. That would be a
gentle but firm NO. Think week-old
tuna. Usually, these kids are foreign.
We all know what that means: a tenu
ous grasp of the English language, and
there are no cute UK-type accents
here. These are the kind of accents
that sound like they have a horrible
speech impediment, or like parts of
their mouths have been misplaced, or
they can't control how much of each
breath is coming out of their nose.
Even for the connoisseur of exotic
delicacies in all of us, these grad stu
dents are grade D meat past its prime.
Next on the list: Erin's fifth grade
social studies teacher. Dr. Scheppis,
otherwise known as the grad student
studying something utterly worthless,
like the kettle imagery found in the
early works of Ezra Pound. If the grad
you've found is getting a doctorate in
something so ridiculous that it will
only allow him to teach at the local ele
mentary school, he is on our menu at
the level of a hot dog — not a frank,
but a pig-scrap hot dog.
Now for those froofy Med School
students, with their pass / fail classes and
joy of learning. Learning, schmerning,
that's what we say. None of us got here
by not caring about grades. Gimme my
A, and leave that psychobabble bullshit
in Santa Cruz. Med students are organic
cheese. We don't know how they make
it, but it's really stupid. We'll take our 100
percent processed Kraft singles — that's
right, we got 100 percent!
The next section of the menu is not a
treat, but at least it's edible. Coterms are
the peanut butter and jelly of the grad
uate world. They don't have Bachelor's
degrees yet, so basically, they're us and
we can't rip on them.
Here at Stanford they don't even
have to write a thesis, so they're not idi
otically specialized in something (think
back to worthless Ph. D.sand Ezra
Pound's kettles ...). Ultimately, they're
trying to avoid the real world, and who
can't sympathize with that? Cut the
crusts off, and have a good time.
Law school students are a step up
because they're usually attractive
enough to be the ambulance chasers
advertised with their headshots on
paper placemats in cheap Asian din
ers. They're like a nicely arranged
sushi plate, possibly even the plastic
kind they leave in the window.
Now for dessert! Business school
students are like chocolate cake, the
really rich kind that doesn't have to
pay taxes under the Bush administra
tion. It's also the kind of chocolate
cake that the pastry chef decorated to
look all pretty, because nobody does
business with ugly cake.
In conclusion, steer clear of anyone
who lives in Escondido's family hous
ing by themselves or with a family of
four. Bon Appetit!

Unhappy with your classification? You
can write, hut we won't read it —
mhstone@stanford.edu. Grad student
who's getting a lot more looks around
campus? It could he that you 're unusu
ally ugly. E-mail lashnits@stanford.edu
to check.
