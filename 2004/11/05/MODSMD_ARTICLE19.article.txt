# Academic performance-enhancing drugs:
## The 						Stanford steroid 
### NOAH WEISS 
It's 2:30 in the morning. Your econ problem set is due at
10 a.m., and your CS midterm is at 1:15 p.m. Your evening
caffeine boost is wearing off, and Late Nite is closed. You
suddenly remember that your I-Hum paper was due yester
day. You're alone in your dorm's study lounge and the
motion-detector lights shut off every 15 minutes, forcing you
to wave your arms frantically to remind it that someone is
still awake in the dorm.
We've all been there.
When faced with midterm madness and problem-set pro
crastination, some students turn to study drugs. Medications
such as Ritalin, Adderall and Dexedrine — usually pre
scribed to treat behavioral disorders such attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder — are often used by students without
these disorders for an extra energy boost.
With these drugs, students say they find that they can
more easily cram in one last all-nighter during finals week or
write a 15-page PWR research paper in one sitting.
"For about four hours, they make everything interesting,"

said a senior who was

prescribed

Dexedrine by
her doctor to

treat attention
deficit disorder.
She said that

her friends who are not
diagnosed with attention
deficit disorder have found

Dexedrine to be effective during
crunch-time.
"Almost everyone has a hard time working for hours,"
she said. "And almost everyone can work longer on these
drugs."
This senior and her friends are not alone. Many students
— with and without prescriptions — have taken them, and
some on a regular basis.
These drugs are not without their share of harmful side
effects.
According to WebMD, an online medical information
resource, Ritalin can cause rapid heart rate, high blood pres
sure, nervousness and insomnia, as well as greater complica
tions such as heart attacks, strokes and hallucinations.
All of the drugs are classified as amphetamines — like
speed and cocaine — and have a similar impact on the body.

Ritalin and cocaine both affect the brains
dopamine system, which regulates

the release of pleasure-caus
ing neurotransmitters.
One senior recalled how
when he used Adderall in an

attempt to write a 25-page
paper freshman year, he felt so ener-
1 c i

gized and rrantic that eight hours
later he was sitting in front of a
still-blank laptop screen because
he was"a little too wired to con-

centrate."
Like all amphetamines, study drugs are habit
forming and can create physical and psychologi-

cal dependencies.
Drug and Alcohol Educator Ralph Castro
warned that study aids, like all stimulants, have a high poten-

tial for abuse and addiction.
He said that they also can mask the effects of depressants
like alcohol, making someone believe they're less drunk
than they really are. But since stimulants wear off much
faster than alcohol, a person is hit with a heavy depressant
effect that could make them sick or incapable of caring for
him or herself.

Despite these dangers, Castro said that he does not
devote substantial time or resources to the prevention of

study drug use.
"Since alcohol is the most widely
used and abused drug on campus, we tend

to focus the majority of our education
in that area," he said.

One junior attested to the poten
tially addictive qualities of study
drugs.
"Half the users I know do it
weekly. There's always an excuse, a
'tonight I have to study fora midterm'

or a 'tonight I have to do a whole
problem set,"' he said. "They become
completely dependent on it to get any

work done at all."

Often the students who need to use drugs
to help them study suffer from other substance-

dependency problems.
The junior said, "They're chemically dependent on
alcohol the night before, then they're dependent on

Adderall the next day to go to class, then they're depend
ent on sleeping pills so they can fall asleep at night."
"People go on binges of destroying their bodies fora few
days," he said. "Then they'll go for four days just on Adderall
to make up for it studying fora midterm."
Even though some students claim that study drugs signif
icantly help their ability to concentrate for hours on end,
others describe the drugs as far from prevalent on campus.
Most students interviewed had never heard of anyone using
drugs to help them study, and when informed that some do.

they were incredulous.
Junior Jimmy Caputo was skeptical that drugs could
actually aid performance.
"It's not like it'll enhance your ability to think critical
ly, and it wouldn't help someone perform well on tests,"
he said.

Even if some
students can work bet

ter on the drugs.
Junior Kristijan
Petursson said that the
crash afterwards makes

using them not worthwhile.
Some students use these drugs as party aids as well.
Especially when snorted, students say the drugs can have a
similar effect to speed or cocaine.
"Snorting is really good to start a night," one senior said.
"There's an energy all at once and you get pretty excited,
pretty ramped up."
Using study drugs recreationally can often coincide with
serious drug use. A junior remarked that every person he
knew who snorted Adderall also snorted cocaine as well. He
saw the abuse of prescription drugs like Ritalin and
Adderall as no different than the abuse of drugs like cocaine
and speed.
"Seems to me that study drugs are just like any other
[illicit] drug," he said. "But somehow they're legal."
