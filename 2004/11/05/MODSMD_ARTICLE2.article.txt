# Cardinal desperately need win in desert to keep bowl hopes alive
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford football team entered this season with high
hopes, looking to have its best season since 2001. Tomorrow,
they can achieve that goal at the same place where everything
came crashing down just over two years ago.
When the Cardinal (4-4,2-3 Pacific-10 Conference) take
on No. 23 Arizona State (6-2,3-2) tomorrow at 3:30 p.m., they
have more to play for than just a crucial win to nudge them
closer to bowl eligibility. They also have a chance to halt a
two-game losing streak, hand the Sun Devils a two-game skid
of their own and erase the bad memory of their last trip to
Tempe.
On Sept. 28,2002, the Cardinal marched into Tempe a 1-
1 squad that had already scored 90 points, but ended up on
the short end of a 65-24 score in their Pac-lOopener. They fin
ished the year 2-9.
Stanford repaid that loss last year with a 38-27 victory over
the Sun Devils at Stanford Stadium. Now, the Cardinal will
try for two in a row against a man who's given the Cardinal
secondary fits the last two years: senior quarterback Andrew
Walter.
Last year, the 6-foot-5 signal caller threw for 357 yards and
four touchdowns against Stanford, and in 2002, he passed for
414 yards and five touchdowns.
"Andrew Walter is as good as any quarterback in the
league." Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said. "We want
to eliminate the big play, and that's the challenge Andrew
Walter presents."
Walter and the Sun Devils will be itching fora win after
losing two of their last three games to No. 1 Southern Cali
fornia and No. 4 California, games in which they scored only
once.
"Every win we gel is a better bowl," Walter said. "I have
only four games left in my Sun Devil career, and 1 want to end
on a great note."
So too, though, do the Cardinal seniors, and Stanford be
lieves it can slow the prolific Sun Devil offense.
"We've been really good at keeping the point total down
this season," Teevens said. "Forcing turnovers will be criti
cal."
Coming off a shutout loss at UCLA, Stanford knows a
good defensive effort will have to start with a productive of
fense.
"We want to keep (Arizona State's offense] on the side
lines as best we can. and we want to be productive offen
sively." Teevens said. "We've been moving the football
and getting first downs, but we're not finishing drives...
it's not like everything is broken and we have huge prob
lems, it's more about correcting the little things and finish
ing."
Sophomore quarterback Trent Edwards will try to lead an
offensive resurgence. He's thrown for 205.9 yards per game
this season, completing 55.5 percent of his passes and throw
ing eight touchdowns and eight interceptions.
Edwards' top target is tight end Alex Smith, who is one

catch shy of matching the Stanford record for ca
reer receptions by a tight end. The 6-foot-5 senior
has caught 44 passes for 532 yards, both team highs.
Evan Moore (29 catches, 449 yards), Mark
Bradford (26 catches, 367 yards) and Justin Mc-
Culluni (23 catches, 329 yards) are the other lead
ing receivers for Stanford.
Seniors J.R. Lemon and Kenneth Tolon split
duties in the backfield and combine to average 95.6
yards per game. They also have combined for 18
receptions and eight rushing touchdowns.
"They're a very dangerous team on offense.
Much like us, they were very inconsistent last
week," Sun Devils head coach Dirk Koetter said.
"But over the course of the year, their wide re
ceivers have made plays, their tight end is out
standing and their quarterback, Edwards, has
made plays running and throwing."
For the Sun Devils. Hakim Hill averages 54
yards per game and has scored three times to lead
the team in rushing touchdowns, although he aver
ages only 11 carries per game in Arizona State's
pass-heavy offense, fie ran for 104 yards last week
on just nine carries.
Walter has already passed the 2,(XX)-yard mark
this season, averaging 260.4 yards per game while
completing 54.8 percent of his passes. He's tossed 21
touchdowns while being intercepted seven times.
His top targets are Derek Hagan. who has 50
catches for 735 yards and eight touchdowns, Terry
Richardson (35 catches, 493 yards) and standout
tight end Zach Miller, who has caught 32 passes for
331 yards as a true freshman.
Despite those impressive numbers, the Sun
Devils turned the ball over five times last week
against Cal. Koetter doesn't think fans should ex
pect a repeat of that, though.
"The two things we are best at are the two
things that got us beat," he said. "That's turning the
ball over, which we did five times and gave Cal 21
points. The other thing is. we have been great at
scoring in the red zone, and we were 0-for-3."
The defense played well, at least, yielding 27
points to an outstanding Cal offense and holding
Aaron Rodgers to 165 passing yards. Arizona
State's defense ranks fifth in the Pac-10. allowing
an average of 22.2 points per game.
Linebacker Dale Robinson, who has 67 tackles,
3.5 sacks and an interception, leads the Arizona
State defense. Fellow linebacker Jamar Williams
has 54 tackles, two sacks and three interceptions,
and safety Emanuel Franklin leads the team with
four interceptions.
Linebacker Kevin Schimmelman, who has 56
tackles, a sack and an interception, and safety Os
hiomogho Atogwe (51 tackles, two interceptions)
anchor the Cardinal defense. Both have forced
two fumbles.
Cornerback Leigh Torrence leads the team
with four interceptions, while defensive end Julian
Jenkins has a team-high 5.5 sacks.
"Stanford is a team that plays hard. They're
unique," Koetter said. "Defensively, they are the
only 3-4 team we play this year."
Not only is the contest the Sun Devils' home
coming and senior day, but the team will retire the
No. 42 jersey of Fat Tillman after the game. Till
man. a former Arizona State linebacker, left hisjob
with the NFL's Arizona Cardinals to join the Army
Rangers after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and was
killed in Afghanistan in April.
The game will be televised nationally on Fox
Sports Net.

things that got us beat," he said. "That's turning the
ball over, which we did five times and gave Cal 21
points. The other thing is. we have been great at
scoring in the red zone, and we were 0-for-3."
The defense played well, at least, yielding 27
points to an outstanding Cal offense and holding
Aaron Rodgers to 165 passing yards. Arizona
State's defense ranks fifth in the Pac-10. allowing
an average of 22.2 points per game.
Linebacker Dale Robinson, who has 67 tackles,
3.5 sacks and an interception, leads the Arizona
State defense. Fellow linebacker Jamar Williams
has 54 tackles, two sacks and three interceptions,
and safety Emanuel Franklin leads the team with
four interceptions.
Linebacker Kevin Schimmelman, who has 56
tackles, a sack and an interception, and safety Os
hiomogho Atogwe (51 tackles, two interceptions)
anchor the Cardinal defense. Both have forced
two fumbles.
Cornerback Leigh Torrence leads the team
with four interceptions, while defensive end Julian
Jenkins has a team-high 5.5 sacks.
"Stanford is a team that plays hard. They're
unique," Koetter said. "Defensively, they are the
only 3-4 team we play this year."
Not only is the contest the Sun Devils' home
coming and senior day, but the team will retire the
No. 42 jersey of Fat Tillman after the game. Till
man. a former Arizona State linebacker, left hisjob
with the NFL's Arizona Cardinals to join the Army
Rangers after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and was
killed in Afghanistan in April.

The Stanford football team entered this season with high
hopes, looking to have its best season since 2001. Tomorrow,
they can achieve that goal at the same place where everything
came crashing down just over two years ago.
When the Cardinal (4-4,2-3 Pacific-10 Conference) take
on No. 23 Arizona State (6-2,3-2) tomorrow at 3:30 p.m., they
have more to play for than just a crucial win to nudge them
closer to bowl eligibility. They also have a chance to halt a
two-game losing streak, hand the Sun Devils a two-game skid
of their own and erase the bad memory of their last trip to
Tempe.
On Sept. 28,2002, the Cardinal marched into Tempe a 1-
1 squad that had already scored 90 points, but ended up on
the short end of a 65-24 score in their Pac-lOopener. They fin
ished the year 2-9.
Stanford repaid that loss last year with a 38-27 victory over
the Sun Devils at Stanford Stadium. Now, the Cardinal will
try for two in a row against a man who's given the Cardinal
secondary fits the last two years: senior quarterback Andrew
Walter.
Last year, the 6-foot-5 signal caller threw for 357 yards and
four touchdowns against Stanford, and in 2002, he passed for
414 yards and five touchdowns.
"Andrew Walter is as good as any quarterback in the
league." Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said. "We want
to eliminate the big play, and that's the challenge Andrew
Walter presents."
Walter and the Sun Devils will be itching fora win after
losing two of their last three games to No. 1 Southern Cali
fornia and No. 4 California, games in which they scored only
once.
"Every win we gel is a better bowl," Walter said. "I have
only four games left in my Sun Devil career, and 1 want to end
on a great note."
So too, though, do the Cardinal seniors, and Stanford be
lieves it can slow the prolific Sun Devil offense.
"We've been really good at keeping the point total down
this season," Teevens said. "Forcing turnovers will be criti
cal."
Coming off a shutout loss at UCLA, Stanford knows a
good defensive effort will have to start with a productive of
fense.
"We want to keep (Arizona State's offense] on the side
lines as best we can. and we want to be productive offen
sively." Teevens said. "We've been moving the football
and getting first downs, but we're not finishing drives...
it's not like everything is broken and we have huge prob
lems, it's more about correcting the little things and finish
ing."
Sophomore quarterback Trent Edwards will try to lead an
offensive resurgence. He's thrown for 205.9 yards per game
this season, completing 55.5 percent of his passes and throw
ing eight touchdowns and eight interceptions.
Edwards' top target is tight end Alex Smith, who is one

catch shy of matching the Stanford record for ca
reer receptions by a tight end. The 6-foot-5 senior
has caught 44 passes for 532 yards, both team highs.
Evan Moore (29 catches, 449 yards), Mark
Bradford (26 catches, 367 yards) and Justin Mc-
Culluni (23 catches, 329 yards) are the other lead
ing receivers for Stanford.
Seniors J.R. Lemon and Kenneth Tolon split
duties in the backfield and combine to average 95.6
yards per game. They also have combined for 18
receptions and eight rushing touchdowns.
"They're a very dangerous team on offense.
Much like us, they were very inconsistent last
week," Sun Devils head coach Dirk Koetter said.
"But over the course of the year, their wide re
ceivers have made plays, their tight end is out
standing and their quarterback, Edwards, has
made plays running and throwing."
For the Sun Devils. Hakim Hill averages 54
yards per game and has scored three times to lead
the team in rushing touchdowns, although he aver
ages only 11 carries per game in Arizona State's
pass-heavy offense, fie ran for 104 yards last week
on just nine carries.
Walter has already passed the 2,(XX)-yard mark
this season, averaging 260.4 yards per game while
completing 54.8 percent of his passes. He's tossed 21
touchdowns while being intercepted seven times.
His top targets are Derek Hagan. who has 50
catches for 735 yards and eight touchdowns, Terry
Richardson (35 catches, 493 yards) and standout
tight end Zach Miller, who has caught 32 passes for
331 yards as a true freshman.
Despite those impressive numbers, the Sun
Devils turned the ball over five times last week
against Cal. Koetter doesn't think fans should ex
pect a repeat of that, though.
"The two things we are best at are the two
things that got us beat," he said. "That's turning the
