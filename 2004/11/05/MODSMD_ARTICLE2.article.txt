The Stanford football team entered this season with high
hopes, looking to have its best season since 2001. Tomorrow,
they can achieve that goal at the same place where everything
came crashing down just over two years ago.
When the Cardinal (4-4,2-3 Pacific-10 Conference) take
on No. 23 Arizona State (6-2,3-2) tomorrow at 3:30 p.m., they
have more to play for than just a crucial win to nudge them
closer to bowl eligibility. They also have a chance to halt a
two-game losing streak, hand the Sun Devils a two-game skid
of their own and erase the bad memory of their last trip to
Tempe.
On Sept. 28,2002, the Cardinal marched into Tempe a 1-
1 squad that had already scored 90 points, but ended up on
the short end of a 65-24 score in their Pac-lOopener. They fin
ished the year 2-9.
Stanford repaid that loss last year with a 38-27 victory over
the Sun Devils at Stanford Stadium. Now, the Cardinal will
try for two in a row against a man who's given the Cardinal
secondary fits the last two years: senior quarterback Andrew
Walter.
Last year, the 6-foot-5 signal caller threw for 357 yards and
four touchdowns against Stanford, and in 2002, he passed for
414 yards and five touchdowns.
"Andrew Walter is as good as any quarterback in the
league." Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said. "We want
to eliminate the big play, and that's the challenge Andrew
Walter presents."
Walter and the Sun Devils will be itching fora win after
losing two of their last three games to No. 1 Southern Cali
fornia and No. 4 California, games in which they scored only
once.
"Every win we gel is a better bowl," Walter said. "I have
only four games left in my Sun Devil career, and 1 want to end
on a great note."
So too, though, do the Cardinal seniors, and Stanford be
lieves it can slow the prolific Sun Devil offense.
"We've been really good at keeping the point total down
this season," Teevens said. "Forcing turnovers will be criti
cal."
Coming off a shutout loss at UCLA, Stanford knows a
good defensive effort will have to start with a productive of
fense.
"We want to keep (Arizona State's offense] on the side
lines as best we can. and we want to be productive offen
sively." Teevens said. "We've been moving the football
and getting first downs, but we're not finishing drives...
it's not like everything is broken and we have huge prob
lems, it's more about correcting the little things and finish
ing."
Sophomore quarterback Trent Edwards will try to lead an
offensive resurgence. He's thrown for 205.9 yards per game
this season, completing 55.5 percent of his passes and throw
ing eight touchdowns and eight interceptions.
Edwards' top target is tight end Alex Smith, who is one
