## Editorial Academic houses have failed 
### 
The priority system for academic resi
dences on campus has failed and should
be reconsidered. If students are truly in
terested in the theme of a residence,
there are other options for exploring that inter
est, such as classes and clubs.
Choosing to live in priority houses is a large
ly strategic option for students, as it allows them
to bypass the normal Draw process. Many stu
dents apply for priority to theme houses so they
are practically guaranteed a spot in the house,
even if they are not at all interested in the
themes.
This undermines the goals of the priority
dorm, leaving those few students who were ac
tually interested in the theme frustrated.
As The Daily reported last week ("After
three years, Yost still speaks English," Oct. 28),
many residents in Yost do not speak Spanish at
all, even though the house is supposed to be
Spanish-language-only.
Several residents of the house expressed frus
tration, as they had expected a Spanish-immer
sion experience when they drew into Yost.
Although the staff of the house claimed the
shortfall in Spanish usage is compensated for by
the cultural events planned that are related to
the dorm's theme, this still does not mask the
fact that the house's original objectives have
failed.
The situation is the same in many academic
theme Row houses on campus, where the objec
tives of immersing and exposing residents to a
particular theme typically are not effective.
And there is no need to have these special in
terest priority houses to lump together students
with similar interests when there are plenty of
clubs and other activities to serve the same pur
pose. Stanford offers many opportunities for
students who are interested in certain academic
fields or areas of social concern to gather to
gether and explore their interests.
Rather than having Lantana be a priority

dorm focused on community service, students
who are genuinely interested in congregating
with other like-minded volunteers can join one
of Stanford's many community service organiza
tions or even start their own group. As the situ
ation stands, many of the priority residents in
Eantana are more interested in receiving a two
room double than in helping out those in need.
And if the students living in Yost are inter
ested in an environment where they could speak
Spanish frequently, perhaps they could form a
Draw group of like-minded students. That way,
they could avoid the indifference of the resi
dents who might have drawn in the house with
no intention of speaking Spanish on a regular
basis.
It is clear that the priority system for aca
demic theme residences is failing when resi
dents of theme houses show indifference to
wards their respective houses' objectives.
The existence of the priority system brings
unfairness to the housing situation on campus.
Not only is it unfair to students whose inter
ests do not match with any of the residence
themes available, it is unfair to students whose
interests may give them priority at less desirable
residences.
For exmaple, students who are interested in
Human Biology luck out by being able to draw
priority into Storey House, which has a prime
location on the Lower Row.
However, students interested in en
trepreneurship are stuck receiving priority only
at Naranja, which is nowhere near as desirable
as Storey for most students.
There is no use in having these dorms when
the priority system can so easily be misused.
Instead of trying to reform a broken system,
academic-themed residences should be convert
ed back into normal residences, and students
who are truly interested in particular themes
should find other avenues through which to ful
fill their academic and social interests.
