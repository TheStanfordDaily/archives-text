# The
						Big Picture
## Value voting in the right-wing nation By WILL NELSON 
### 
The re-election of George W.
Bush highlights a lesson that has be
come increasingly clear over the
past two decades: The Republican
voter base can overcome truly enor
mous obstacles to get their conser
vative candidates elected.
Given all the problems facing
America, many are simply shocked
at Bush's victory.
A lot of observers will blame
John Kerry, calling him a weak can
didate or faulting his campaign.
But Kerry did about as well as
any Democratic candidate could be
expected. He really put up a fight.
Some will toss around old accu
sations that Bush won through dirty
tricks like voter disenfranchisemcnt
or invoking 9/11 for political gain
— those nasty Republicans did it
again, misleading and disenfran
chising.
Sorry, but dirty tricks did not
gain George W. Bush his comfort
able margin of victory.
Bush's re-election ultimately
comes down to the Republican image
of strength, leadership and old-fash
ioned rural American values.
Issues don't directly matter to
many voters as much as their faith
that a candidate will "do the right
thing." They choose a candidate
based on character and values and
then leave the policy details up to
him or her.
This approach to voting is not as
ridiculous as it might sound. Aver
age voters do not have the expertise
to analyze issues in anything more
than rudimentary terms.

Besides, one never knows what
issues a candidate will really face in
office. No one chose Bush in 2(XM)
for his position on fighting terror
ism, for instance.
Sizing up a candidate based on
character and values gives voters
some basic idea of how he might
lead in office.
Bush's aggressive actions in the
war on terror certainly fit his Re
publican image. Al Gore or John
Kerry most certainly would have
been less aggressive than Bush.
And in this case, image matches the
policy reality.
Some gloomily predict that vot
ing based on character and values
will be the downfall of America.
The argument is that ethereal
percept ions of character are too
susceptible to propaganda and ma
nipulation. Voting based on diffuse
judgments results in little account
ability on concrete issues.
This hasn't been a big problem
so far. Hordes of Americans have
been voting this way at least since
the Reagan years. America has
done well since then, especially in
comparison with other large indus
trialized nations.
As more and more voters choose
candidates based on values and
character, the nation moves relent
lessly to the right. As it moves to the
right, it prospers.
America has never been stronger
than right now, at the height of the
conservative ascendancy.
But America has also never been
more hated and resented abroad.
That is a serious national problem
in this age of terrorism and econom

ic interdependence.
Is voting on values and character
to blame for this? Partly yes.
Many voters choose leaders
based on American values and their
image of good leadership. As long
as the leaders match this image,
these voters don't much care how
America acts toward others around
the world.
Bush's re-election makes this
point astonishingly clear. He led us
into the war in Iraq based on wildly
incorrect intelligence about WMD.
No, he didn't lie. Maybe invad
ing Iraq was still the right course of
action. But the justification for the
war was ridiculously flawed. Sad
dam Hussein insisted he had no
weapons of mass destruction. Bush
disagreed. Saddam was right.
But Bush has the right values
and is a strong leader, so voters for
gave him. That's a big mistake to
forgive, although the fact that his
opponent threw away his war
medals and also thought Iraq had
WMD made it easier.
Voters are perfectly justified in
voting based on character and val
ues. Voting based on values works
just fine — as long as the values are
right.
But I hope respect for other na
tions and America's image in the
world soon becomes part of the
Republican portfolio of traditional
values.
