# Irrational Exuberance
## The
						ownership economy 
### 
I may he shunned hy the eco
nomics profession for saying
this, but I am a closet Marxist.
The academic economics de
partments in the top U.S. universi
ties have been the only ones to have
effectively exiled their Marxists to
peripheral schools.
What is underappreciated, how
ever, is that they have done so after
adopting and fully internalizing

what in my opin
ion is Marx's most
important contri
bution: dialectical
materialism.
Although
Marx is often as
sociated with no
tions of commu
nist ideology, the
ideological aspect
of Marxism was

actually intro
duced by his followers — such as
Gramsci — decades after Marx's
death.
Marx himself, at least in his more
academic and less rhetorical writ
ing, was a strong believer that mate
rial factors — tangible things such
as amount of labor or capital — de
termined the shape of the economy.
This materialist approach is central
to the mindset economists have
today.
One other point of agreement
between Marx and modern
economists that Martin Carnoy
likes to point out is that capitalism is
the best system of wealth creation
known to man.
The crux of Marx's argument
against capitalism is not that com
munism would provide more
wealth — only that capitalism dis
tributes wealth unfairly. Capitalism
concentrates wealth in the hands of
the capitalists.
The question I always had is, why
can't everybody be a capitalist?
I was reminded of all this by the
recent rhetoric of the Bush cam
paign and his vision of an ownership
economy.
Bush wants to create programs
that allow all Americans to have
greater ownership of their homes,
their healthcare savings and their
retirement savings — in other
words, their capital. I would argue
that this is a Marxist idea.

One simple point that is taken for
granted by economists and their
models of the economy — but is
easily forgotten or ignored by every
one else — is that corporations are
owned by people.
People seem to have a visceral
distrust of corporate profits. How
ever, corporate profits eventually
go to the owners of the corporation
— the shareholders, or as Marx
would call them, the capitalists.
In America today, over 50 per
cent of Americans own stocks. That
makes them capitalists.
I see no reason why this number
can't increase. Admittedly, Marx
and many others would point out
that ownership of capital is very un
equally distributed and that most of
these are petty bourgeois at best —
fooled into thinking they have
power but are just as oppressed as
the rest.
Yet that could change as well.
The main reason Marx's predictions
did not come to pass (he expected
England to be the first communist
country) is that workers started ac
quiring skills and education —
human capital that allowed them to
start demanding higher wages.
Though estimates of human cap
ital are imprecise at best, many esti
mate that one-third or more of any
nation's assets are in the heads of its
people — ideas, education, skills.
Marx's original theory was not
wrong but only blind to technologi
cal developments.
By improving education and
transferring ownership of assets
from the government to the people,
we potentially move toward a soci
ety where everyone's a capitalist
and everyone's equal.
1 further want to disabuse people
of the notion that capitalism re
quires inequality in order to pro
duce incentives. Untrue.
Capitalism requires only the pos
sibility of inequality. In a society
where capital is evenly distributed
and everyone works equally hard,
there is no economic reason why
capitalism would not produce an
equal society.
