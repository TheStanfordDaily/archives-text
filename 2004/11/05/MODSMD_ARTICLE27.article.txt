Close results in 2004 affirm
Electoral College system is flawed
A few weeks ago, The Daily was
kind enough to publish my modest
argument against the Electoral
College, as well as those of others.
Please, then, forgive my immod
esty now as 1 say, "1 told you so."
Even Electoral College oppo
nents have admitted that the sys
tem posseses virtues, but in this
election, its redeeming qualities
were frighteningly close to not ma
terializing.
The Electoral College is sup
posed to put a premium on geo
graphical breadth of appeal, but a
candidate with far fewer states and
counties under his belt almost won.
It claims to protect the interests
of small states, but here it almost

reinforced bi-coastalism.
Finally, thanks to the Electoral
College, the candidate with a pop
ular majority and almost 4 million
more national votes, a victory mar
gin of 3 percent, was a mere
1 (K),CKK) votes away in Ohio from
losing the White House.
We chalked up problems with
the Electoral College in 2(KK) to
that elections margin of victory
being smaller than the margin of
error. This election, while not a
landslide, was also not close. There
was a clear winner.
Yet the Electoral College acted
more as a hindrance to democracy
than as its guardian. It's time to
abolish this relic once and for all.

Daily coverage of Ruskin-Poizner
race unfair
I was a bit disappointed to see
one of your front-page stories the
other day. "Ruskin highlights dif
ferences in tight race" (Nov. 1) was
incredibly biased.
I voted for Ira Ruskin, so I don't
disagree with your politics, but they
are far too evident. I'm glad he won,
but please be reasonable in how you
cover these things. The story ran the
day before the election.
The story was essentially a mouth
piece for the candidate to explain how
liberal he is, which surely appealed to
a lot of students around here.
Your article on Poizner ran last
week. How could it possibly have
had as much impact?
Run the stories next to each
other, closer together in time or on a
special election page, but don't pre
tend that regurgitating one-sided
views the day before the election is
front-page news.
