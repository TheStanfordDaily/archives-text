## Water polo moves on in wake of loss 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
There was no time to ponder the past or
brood over the what-ifs and could-have
beens as the No. 2 Stanford men's water
polo team (16-3, 4-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) entered the pool last
Sunday. The Cardinal hit an offensive snag
the previous morning in a disheartening
loss to No. 1 UCLA, but bounced right
back by defeating UC-Santa Barbara in
dominant fashion. With three weeks re
maining in the regular season, the Cardinal
hope their loss to the Bruins will only help
them improve as a team.
"Sometimes the best losses help more
than they hurt," said senior driver Tony
Azevedo.
While it was evident that the 7-4 loss in
Los Angeles mAy have bruised the Cardi
nal's bodies and spirits, whether it has
damaged them past that point will be evi
dent in the team's next couple of matches.
"What happens now is it puts them in
the driver's seat, and it puts us at a solid
second or third kind of an area," said
Azevedo on the effects of Saturday's
match. "First is out of reach unless [the
Bruins] lose."
For the time being, Stanford is using
its loss to UCLA to propel itself into this
weekend's matches.
"It's not plaguing us right now, but it's
always going to be on our minds," Azevedo
said. "It's always going to be on our minds
when we play them, and when we play
other high-rated teams. What happened,
we can never have that happen again. I
think it is going to be on our minds for sure,
and we're going to use that for every team
we play."
But the Cardinal won't be facing any
challenges as big as the one the Bruins
posed fora while. Stanford hosts No. 15
Pacific (5-15, 0-6) and Long Beach State
(12-8, 3-2) on Saturday and Sunday, re
spectively, and the Cardinal have defeated
both schools in previous games this season
by a combined score of 42-12.
Pacific's No. 15 rank is somewhat mis
leading, as the Tigers have yet to win a con
ference tilt and are on an eight-game losing
skid. When the Cardinal and Tigers met
Sept. 26 and Oct. 2, Stanford tore apart the
Tiger defense in a pair of 13-3 and 16-6 vic
tories.
Long Beach poses a slightly more diffi

cult test. It has three wins against MPSF
opponents, including last week's one-goal,
double-overtime win against No. 4 UC-
Santa Barbara. The 49ers are coached by
Rick Azevedo, father of Tony Azevedo,
and boast four of the top 30 scorers in the
MPSF. Brett McCleave leads the 49ers
with 37 goals.
The Cardinal will counter with the
league's top goalkeeper, junior Chad Tay
lor. who holds a 4.72 goals against average.
"It's going to be a big game for us,"
Tony Azevedo said. "They're an extreme
ly smart team. That was one of our prob
lems on Saturday; we had so much talent,
so much firepower that a lot of times we'd

get ahead of ourselves. It's going to be a
good test for us against Long Beach to see
if we can play against a very smart and con
trolled team, and take care of them."
Long Beach has lost seven in a row to
Stanford with its last win against the Car
dinal coming in 2(X)0. Earlier this season,
Stanford defeated the 49ers 13-3.
Stanford is no stranger to lopsided vic
tories. The Cardinal have scored 231 goals
in 19 games and average a conference-best
12.16 goals per game. Stanford has
outscored its opponents 231-115 this sea
son, and the Cardinal are especially domi
nant in the first seven minutes of the game,
outscoring their opponents 71-25 in the

first period.
Adding another bullet to the list of rea
sons why a win should come easily to Stan
ford is that the Cardinal are playing at
home after going 4-1 on their toughest
road trip of the season.
While Stanford's four remaining games
are all conference tilts, the Cardinal are
decidedly loose heading into the season's
homestretch.
"Right now it's whatever we can do to
get our team rolling," Azevedo said. "It's
not really that nerve-racking because we
know we should go out there and win."
Both matches this weekend begin at
noon.
