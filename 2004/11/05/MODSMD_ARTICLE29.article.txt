### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Losers of seven of their last eight
games, the Stanford women's field
hockey team headed into the first
round of the NorPac Championship
at Davidson, N.C., yesterday with
what head coach Leslie Irvine de
scribed as a clean slate.
That slate now includes a tally in
the win column after sophomore Liz
Robinson gave the Cardinal (7-11)
an improbable 1-0 overtime victory
over East division champion Rad
ford (9-10) with a goal in the 71st
minute.
The game-winner was Robinson's
sixth goal of the season and came
after she gathered her own rebound
off a shot set up by a pass from fresh
man Jessica Zutz.
Stanford junior goalkeeper Ana
Kralovec picked the perfect time to
record the second shutout of her ca
reer. as she stopped seven Davidson
shots on goal.
The victory broke a three-game
losing streak for the Cardinal, which

surpassed last season's victory total
of six. Radford was a perfect 6-0
against NorPac East division compe
tition during the regular season.
"This win was great for our confi
dence, and now we need to focus on
taking care of business tomorrow
and in the rest of the tournament,"
Irvine said.
The Cardinal face a familiar op
ponent today when they take on Pa
cific at 4 p.m. Stanford lost both of its
regular season meetings with the
Tigers, falling 5-0 at Stockton in
September before suffering a 2-1 set
back in their most recent meeting,
Oct. 23 at Stanford. Pacific knocked
off Appalachian State 2-0 yesterday.
Stanford's win yesterday im
proved its record to 3-0 all-time
against Radford in the NorPac
Championship. The Cardinal have
now reached the semifinals in each of
the seven years the NorPac Champi
onship has been in existence.
In the other half of the bracket.
No. 15 Cal and Southwest Missouri
State advanced to face each other in
today's other semifinal.
