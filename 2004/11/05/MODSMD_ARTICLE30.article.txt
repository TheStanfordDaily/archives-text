# Cardinal hold on to slim hopes for Pac-10 title
## 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WHITER 
Bv this time last year, the UCLA
women's soccer team had all but clinched
the Pacific-10 Conference title. With one
weekend to go in the regular season, all
the Bruins had to do was win one of their
final two remaining games, which they
did. to beat out runner-up Arizona State
for the crown.
Things aren't quite so simple this sea
son. however, as the Pac-10 title is still up
for grabs with just one weekend of play
remaining. The No. 11 Stanford women s
soccer team (12-4-1. 4-2-1 Pac-10) is still
very much in the running as it heads
north to take on No. 25 Washington (12-
4-1, 3-3-1) and Washington State (8-6-3.
3-3-1) in its final two regular season
games.
Arizona, the Pac-10's most surprising
team this season, is in first place and can

clinch an outright title if it sweeps Oregon
and Oregon State. Nipping at the Wild
cats' heels are the Bruins. Cardinal and
Sun Devils, all of whom are within a half
game of Arizona.
Luckily for the Wildcats, the Ducks
and Beavers occupy the last two spots in
the standings and have combined for just
two conference wins on the year.
However, given how competitive the
Pac-10 has been this season, the Cardinal
are still holding out hope. Should they
steal the Pac-10 title away from the Wild
cats. it would be the team's sixth crown in
the past twelve years.
"It would be awesome to win the Pac
-10 title." said sophomore defender Shari
Summers. "We still have a great chance if
we win both our games against Washing
ton this weekend."
The Cardinal arc riding high after ex-
tending their winning streak to
three games with a sweep of the
visiting Oregon schools last week
end. Posting 32 shots over the two
game span, the Cardinal held both
opponents scoreless while putting
up three goals ol their own.
While momentum may he on
the Cardinal's side, they are not
taking anything for granted.
"We can't be too comfortable
with the wins because we still have
two more games that are even
more important." Summers said.
"II we come in too relaxed, and not
ready to play, it could be trouble."
The Cardinal will start off the
weekend tonight against Washing
ton under the lights at Husky Field.
Despite fielding a talented roster
and maintaining a national rank
ing. the Huskies have struggled in
Pac-10 play this season.
While their impressive overall
record should be good enough to
earn them an at-large bid to the
NCAA tournament, the Huskies
will be looking to solidify their spot
in the field of M.
The Huskies are one of the Pac-
Io\ most prolific offensive teams,
tied for the conference lead with
an average of 2.06 goals per game.
Recent Pac-10 Player of the Week
I'ina I rimpong leads all Husky
scorers with II goals and 25 points
on the season.
No matter how aggressive the
Husky offense is the Cardinal de
fense remains confident in its abil
ity to shut down strong offensive
opponents as it has done in the
past.
The Cardinal also know, how
ever. that defense alone won't win
big games and that they must do a
better job at converting their
strong offensive drives into goals.
Head coach Paul Ratcliffe con
tends that his team will continue

"to play the same way" it has been
playing all season long, he also
hopes that his offense will have a
solid weekend.
"We need to try to create some
good scoring chances and get some
goals," Ratcliffe said.
The Cardinal will return to ac
tion again on Sunday afternoon for
its Pac-10 finale against Washing
ton State.
Picked to finish ninth in the Pac
-10 in the preseason coaches' poll,
the Cougars have exceeded expec
tations and are still in the hunt for
an at-large tournament bid.
The game will feature two of the
Pac-10's top goalkeepers in Cardi

nal senior Nicole Barnhart and
Cougar backstop Katie Hultin.
Hultin is second in the Pac-10 in
saves, while Barnhart leads the
league with a 0.44 goals-against av
erage.
While both Washington and
Washington State are competitive
teams, the Cardinal's biggest foe
this weekend could be the weather.
"The main thing for me is we've
got to hope that the weather condi
tions are to our advantage." said
Ratcliffe. "11 it's raining, obviously
we'll have to change our style of
play a little bit and play a little bit
more direct than we like."
Kickoff tonight is set for 5 p.m.

soccer team (12-4-1. 4-2-1 Pac-10) is still
very much in the running as it heads
north to take on No. 25 Washington (12-
4-1, 3-3-1) and Washington State (8-6-3.
3-3-1) in its final two regular season
games.
Arizona, the Pac-10's most surprising
team this season, is in first place and can

clinch an outright title if it sweeps Oregon
and Oregon State. Nipping at the Wild
cats' heels are the Bruins. Cardinal and
Sun Devils, all of whom are within a half
game of Arizona.
Luckily for the Wildcats, the Ducks
and Beavers occupy the last two spots in
the standings and have combined for just
two conference wins on the year.
However, given how competitive the
Pac-10 has been this season, the Cardinal
are still holding out hope. Should they
steal the Pac-10 title away from the Wild
cats. it would be the team's sixth crown in
the past twelve years.
"It would be awesome to win the Pac
-10 title." said sophomore defender Shari
Summers. "We still have a great chance if
we win both our games against Washing
ton this weekend."
The Cardinal arc riding high after ex-
tending their winning streak to
three games with a sweep of the
visiting Oregon schools last week
end. Posting 32 shots over the two
game span, the Cardinal held both
opponents scoreless while putting
up three goals ol their own.
While momentum may he on
the Cardinal's side, they are not
taking anything for granted.
"We can't be too comfortable
with the wins because we still have
two more games that are even
more important." Summers said.
"II we come in too relaxed, and not
ready to play, it could be trouble."
The Cardinal will start off the
weekend tonight against Washing
ton under the lights at Husky Field.
Despite fielding a talented roster
and maintaining a national rank
ing. the Huskies have struggled in
Pac-10 play this season.
While their impressive overall
record should be good enough to
earn them an at-large bid to the
NCAA tournament, the Huskies
will be looking to solidify their spot
in the field of M.
The Huskies are one of the Pac-
Io\ most prolific offensive teams,
tied for the conference lead with
an average of 2.06 goals per game.
Recent Pac-10 Player of the Week
I'ina I rimpong leads all Husky
scorers with II goals and 25 points
on the season.
No matter how aggressive the
Husky offense is the Cardinal de
fense remains confident in its abil
ity to shut down strong offensive
opponents as it has done in the
past.
The Cardinal also know, how
ever. that defense alone won't win
big games and that they must do a
better job at converting their
strong offensive drives into goals.
Head coach Paul Ratcliffe con
tends that his team will continue

"to play the same way" it has been
playing all season long, he also
hopes that his offense will have a
solid weekend.
"We need to try to create some
good scoring chances and get some
goals," Ratcliffe said.
The Cardinal will return to ac
tion again on Sunday afternoon for
its Pac-10 finale against Washing
ton State.
Picked to finish ninth in the Pac
-10 in the preseason coaches' poll,
the Cougars have exceeded expec
tations and are still in the hunt for
an at-large tournament bid.
The game will feature two of the
Pac-10's top goalkeepers in Cardi

nal senior Nicole Barnhart and
Cougar backstop Katie Hultin.
Hultin is second in the Pac-10 in
saves, while Barnhart leads the
league with a 0.44 goals-against av
erage.
While both Washington and
Washington State are competitive
teams, the Cardinal's biggest foe
this weekend could be the weather.
"The main thing for me is we've
got to hope that the weather condi
tions are to our advantage." said
Ratcliffe. "11 it's raining, obviously
we'll have to change our style of
play a little bit and play a little bit
more direct than we like."
Kickoff tonight is set for 5 p.m.

Junior midfielder Leah Tapscott and the Stanford women's soccer team wrap
up the Pac-10 season this weekend against the Washington schools.
Bv this time last year, the UCLA
women's soccer team had all but clinched
the Pacific-10 Conference title. With one
weekend to go in the regular season, all
the Bruins had to do was win one of their
final two remaining games, which they
did. to beat out runner-up Arizona State
for the crown.
Things aren't quite so simple this sea
son. however, as the Pac-10 title is still up
for grabs with just one weekend of play
remaining. The No. 11 Stanford women s
soccer team (12-4-1. 4-2-1 Pac-10) is still
very much in the running as it heads
north to take on No. 25 Washington (12-
4-1, 3-3-1) and Washington State (8-6-3.
3-3-1) in its final two regular season
games.
