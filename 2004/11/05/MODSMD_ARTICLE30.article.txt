### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WHITER 
Bv this time last year, the UCLA
women's soccer team had all but clinched
the Pacific-10 Conference title. With one
weekend to go in the regular season, all
the Bruins had to do was win one of their
final two remaining games, which they
did. to beat out runner-up Arizona State
for the crown.
Things aren't quite so simple this sea
son. however, as the Pac-10 title is still up
for grabs with just one weekend of play
remaining. The No. 11 Stanford women s
soccer team (12-4-1. 4-2-1 Pac-10) is still
very much in the running as it heads
north to take on No. 25 Washington (12-
4-1, 3-3-1) and Washington State (8-6-3.
3-3-1) in its final two regular season
games.
Arizona, the Pac-10's most surprising
team this season, is in first place and can

clinch an outright title if it sweeps Oregon
and Oregon State. Nipping at the Wild
cats' heels are the Bruins. Cardinal and
Sun Devils, all of whom are within a half
game of Arizona.
Luckily for the Wildcats, the Ducks
and Beavers occupy the last two spots in
the standings and have combined for just
two conference wins on the year.
However, given how competitive the
Pac-10 has been this season, the Cardinal
are still holding out hope. Should they
steal the Pac-10 title away from the Wild
cats. it would be the team's sixth crown in
the past twelve years.
"It would be awesome to win the Pac
-10 title." said sophomore defender Shari
Summers. "We still have a great chance if
we win both our games against Washing
ton this weekend."
