# Men's soccer to make bid for NCAAs at UCSB
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After 16 grueling games and a hand
ful of nail-biters, the season has boiled
down to a critical back stretch for the
Stanford men's soccer team. With two
games to play, Stanford (7-4-5,2-3-2 Pa
cific-l() Conference) has one objective:
snagging an NCAA bid. The Cardinal
have a great chance to prove their case
fora spot tomorrow at No. 5 UC-Santa
Barbara (13-2-1.6-2-0 Big West Confer
ence).
The Gauchos have spent six weeks
this season in the top five of the nation
al polls and were at one point the top
ranked soccer team in the nation; how
ever. the daunting resume of the oppo
nent has only galvanized Stanford's re
solve.
"We desperately want to make the
NCAA tournament and progress to

the College Cup," said head Coach
Bret Simon. "I suspect this team has
several wins left in its season."
The wins will have to come early,
though, as Stanford has only one more
game after Saturday (a date with No.
24 California). After the Cardinal's
win over Oregon State last Sunday,
Simon said he suspected the team
would need to win one of the final
games fora post-season bid. but there's
no panicking yet.
"I'm not sure if this is a must-win sit
uation." Simon said. "But, a win would
go a long way toward strengthening
our case for an NCAA bid."
The uncertainty surrounding what
will get the team into the playoffs
makes this game even more vital to the
Cardinal.
"It's tough to say how many we
need to win in order to make the play-

offs," said senior captain and goalkeeper Robby Ful
ton. "I personally view it as do-or-die, or a playoff
game, which is how 1 looked at Oregon State. I want
to win so we can take the pressure slightly off us next
week, but who knows what will get you in."
Stanford will hope to ride the momentum it got
from its 2-0 win over the Beavers at Maloney Field
this past weekend. Senior contributions were key to
the victory and players like Fulton, Matt Janusz, and
Aaron Maines will need to continue their efforts.
Underclassmen must step up to the challenge as
well.
Stanford has only two wins, both against Oregon
State, since Oct. 8. In fact, the last win the Cardinal
had against a team not from Corvallis, Ore., was on
Sept. 19 against Cal State-Fullerton. Meanwhile. UC-
Santa Barbara is coming off back-to-back wins.
"Santa Barbara is an extremely intense, physical
team that is committed to competing for the entire
game," Simon said. "The best thing we can do to help
our chances to succeed is to concentrate on playing
great soccer. [That means] keeping possession, being
sharp on restarts and matching UCSB's effort."
As a non-conference opponent, the Gauchos are a
relative unknown to the Cardinal squad.
"To be honest I don't know much about them yet,"
Fulton said. "I've heard they work very hard all over
the field. They're a very solid team with no real su
perstars. We need to match their intensity. We need

to go hack to that hlue-collar work ethic we had at the
beginning of the year all over the field."
"Our training throughout the season has been at a
good level," Simon said. "So, I don't expect any
major changes down the stretch."
The UC-Santa Barbara attack is headed by Drew
McAthy, who leads the team with 12 goals and four
assists. Seven of McAthy's goals have ended up being
game-winners.
To defeat the Gauchos, who are an impressive 5-1
this season, the Cardinal likely need to play even bet
ter than they did against Oregon State.
"The teams I've coached that have experienced
success late in the season and during playoffs have
been able to find an extra gear, an added energy level
in training and games when other teams seem worn
out," Simon said.
Next weekend the Cardinal w ill get another shot at
taking down a top-level opponent as Stanford takes
on No. 24 California. The Cardinal tied the Golden
Bears at home this year with a near-miraculous two
goal comeback. This two-game stretch has the poten
tial to make or break the season for Stanford.
"Obviously, it's a great opportunity (to play UC-
Santa Barbara]," Simon said. "Thankfully, we have
two of them when you include the Cal game. That's
the advantage of having a great schedule.
Kickoff for tomorrow's match is at 7 p.m. in Santa
Barbara.

Sept. 19 against Cal State-Fullerton. Meanwhile. UC-
Santa Barbara is coming off back-to-back wins.
"Santa Barbara is an extremely intense, physical
team that is committed to competing for the entire
game," Simon said. "The best thing we can do to help
our chances to succeed is to concentrate on playing
great soccer. [That means] keeping possession, being
sharp on restarts and matching UCSB's effort."
As a non-conference opponent, the Gauchos are a
relative unknown to the Cardinal squad.
"To be honest I don't know much about them yet,"
Fulton said. "I've heard they work very hard all over
the field. They're a very solid team with no real su
perstars. We need to match their intensity. We need

to go hack to that hlue-collar work ethic we had at the
beginning of the year all over the field."
"Our training throughout the season has been at a
good level," Simon said. "So, I don't expect any
major changes down the stretch."
The UC-Santa Barbara attack is headed by Drew
McAthy, who leads the team with 12 goals and four
assists. Seven of McAthy's goals have ended up being
game-winners.
To defeat the Gauchos, who are an impressive 5-1
this season, the Cardinal likely need to play even bet
ter than they did against Oregon State.
"The teams I've coached that have experienced
success late in the season and during playoffs have
been able to find an extra gear, an added energy level
in training and games when other teams seem worn
out," Simon said.
Next weekend the Cardinal w ill get another shot at
taking down a top-level opponent as Stanford takes
on No. 24 California. The Cardinal tied the Golden
Bears at home this year with a near-miraculous two
goal comeback. This two-game stretch has the poten
tial to make or break the season for Stanford.
"Obviously, it's a great opportunity (to play UC-
Santa Barbara]," Simon said. "Thankfully, we have
two of them when you include the Cal game. That's
the advantage of having a great schedule.
Kickoff for tomorrow's match is at 7 p.m. in Santa
Barbara.

Gauchos are 5-1 at
home this season
After 16 grueling games and a hand
ful of nail-biters, the season has boiled
down to a critical back stretch for the
Stanford men's soccer team. With two
games to play, Stanford (7-4-5,2-3-2 Pa
cific-l() Conference) has one objective:
snagging an NCAA bid. The Cardinal
have a great chance to prove their case
fora spot tomorrow at No. 5 UC-Santa
Barbara (13-2-1.6-2-0 Big West Confer
ence).
The Gauchos have spent six weeks
this season in the top five of the nation
al polls and were at one point the top
ranked soccer team in the nation; how
ever. the daunting resume of the oppo
nent has only galvanized Stanford's re
solve.
"We desperately want to make the
NCAA tournament and progress to

the College Cup," said head Coach
Bret Simon. "I suspect this team has
several wins left in its season."
The wins will have to come early,
though, as Stanford has only one more
game after Saturday (a date with No.
24 California). After the Cardinal's
win over Oregon State last Sunday,
Simon said he suspected the team
would need to win one of the final
games fora post-season bid. but there's
no panicking yet.
"I'm not sure if this is a must-win sit
uation." Simon said. "But, a win would
go a long way toward strengthening
our case for an NCAA bid."
The uncertainty surrounding what
will get the team into the playoffs
makes this game even more vital to the
Cardinal.
"It's tough to say how many we
need to win in order to make the play-

offs," said senior captain and goalkeeper Robby Ful
ton. "I personally view it as do-or-die, or a playoff
game, which is how 1 looked at Oregon State. I want
to win so we can take the pressure slightly off us next
week, but who knows what will get you in."
Stanford will hope to ride the momentum it got
from its 2-0 win over the Beavers at Maloney Field
this past weekend. Senior contributions were key to
the victory and players like Fulton, Matt Janusz, and
Aaron Maines will need to continue their efforts.
Underclassmen must step up to the challenge as
well.
Stanford has only two wins, both against Oregon
State, since Oct. 8. In fact, the last win the Cardinal
had against a team not from Corvallis, Ore., was on
Sept. 19 against Cal State-Fullerton. Meanwhile. UC-
Santa Barbara is coming off back-to-back wins.
