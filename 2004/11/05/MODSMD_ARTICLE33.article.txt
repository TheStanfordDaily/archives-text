# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## Bemoaning the blasphemy of Black Tuesday 
### 
1 watched it all. I was there. I saw what hap
pened. 1 saw how the future of our coun
try fell by the wayside, how a hyped part
nership promising prosperity and success was
defeated by a polarizing incumbent, how
ridiculous numbers impacted my elation, sad
ness, and health to levels I haven't experi
enced in years.
It was really those numbers that I couldn't
believe. Thev flashed on-

uwuvvv/. VMl
screen, offensive in their
very existence, belying my
original estimations. They
were wrong: wrong color,
wrong person, wrong
amount. Everything was off.
Last Tuesday, 1 refused to
believe those numbers, re
fused to believe their results
and refused to believe in my
defeat.

Because last Tuesday, Yao Ming scored
seven points on 22 percent shooting, and he
was my second pick.
It was the first game of the NBA season,
with the Rockets taking on the defending
champion Pistons. But more importantly, it
was the first day of fantasy basketball, with my
one-two punch of T-Mac and Yao joining to
gether for the first time. But what do 1 get? T-
Mac scoring all of 18 points, hitting one of
every three shots, and Yao throwing a little
seven-point, zero-assist, zero-steal night at
me.
1 got goosed.
But to tell the truth, there was some good
news last Tuesday — 1 saved a bunch of
money on my car insurance by switching to
Geico.
Going into my fantasy draft this year, I
knew I would be a force. Oh, and by the way,
if you read the lead and are wondering when
I'm going to start talking about politics, it
ain't gonna happen, this is a fantasy basket
ball column.
Last year, I relied too heavily on high-risk
gambles (read: I drafted Darko) and was
marred by injury, with Jamal Mashburn and
Jerry Stackhouse out for the majority of the
season. So this year, I came back with a strat
egy of — get this — intelligence. It's a new
concept for me.T'm still working out the kinks.
However, when I showed up in the Kappa
Sigma kitchen a few weeks ago for our offline,
live fantasy draft. I had a plan. The plan was to
order a pineapple pizza, and that soon came to
fruition, just in time for my first-round pick.
I had the fourth pick, and after a surpris
ingly long time for newbie Gabe Pagani-Es
tevez to realize that KG is more dominant
than a bulldog at a cat parade, I made my se
lection.
On a related note, the previous joke isn't
funny.
Tim Duncan went second. Kobe third, and I
was forced to take T-Mac at No. 4. To tell the
truth, I wasn't too happy with that one, as T-
Mac will be forced to share the ball in Houston,
but if I say any more, I seriously hurt my chance
at trading him. so, you know what, he's fantas
tic. A great player. A first-ballot selection to
the"I look high all the time" Hall of Fame,
along with Mike Vick and half of Theta Delt.
Now, like any fantasy guru will tell you,
your first two picks won't make your team
great, but they could completely sink your
squad. Basically, if you can't come out of the
first two rounds with a solid big man and
guard, you're done. So when the 17th pick
snaked back to me, I had no choice but take
the Toni Kukoc to T-Mac's Michael Jordan.
Yao Ming.
Yao Ming will either have a season that
qualifies him to be in the "top three centers in


Spencer Porter
the league" argument, or will have a
season where he is cemented as a 17-
7 guy for the rest of his career. It's
that simple.
I lowever, and this is a big howev
er. Yao is reportedly looking fora
contract extension, mirroring T-
Mac's recent idea. Nothing says six
years, SO million like a nice 25-15-5-
4 stat line every once in a while.
My next pick was Lamar Odom.
who disappointed in Athens, but
qualifies lor a great fantasy year
thanks to another fantasy guideline
he's on a new team.
With the Lakers completely gut
ted. and the over-under of Brian
Grant's games played hovering

around 34, Odom is due fora huge
fantasy year. He will he the Lakers'
go-to guy in the paint, and that will
at least get him some boards and a
high field-goal percentage.
The next few rounds were largely
stale, with me just picking up the
best position players still on the
board, doing well to get Donyell
Marshall, Andre Miller, Chris Bosh
and Jason Williams.
However, my sexiest pick of the
night came in the ninth round, when
I took Troy Murphy off the board.
Murphy, who averaged a double
double two seasons ago, was hurt
with a foot injury last year. Ifowever.
with Brick Dampier gone to Dallas

(I bet you couldn't even spell
"Erick" before he decided to pull in
12 boards a game in his contract
year), Troy should be able to put up
20-11 numbers.
We'll see how it goes, but for me,
the numbers don't lie. I'll just be
watching Stat Tracker, waiting for
Mark Madsen to blow up.
Despite drafting a pair of Houston
Rockets with his first two picks,
there's no truth to the rumor that
Spencer consulted Karl Rove for fan
tasy advice before his draft. Ask him
how lie's doing in his fantasy football
league at poriers(P stanford.edu.

Trust Spencer, don't
sleep on Troy Murphy
