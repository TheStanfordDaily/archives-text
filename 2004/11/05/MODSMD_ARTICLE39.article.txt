## 'Alfie' continues our obsession with (drool) Jude Law 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION MOVIE CRITIC 
He's lying in bed. And when you
look over at him, you realize you just
woke up next to a mussy-haired sil
ver-tongued playboy. That would be
the title character, "Alfie" (Jude
Law).
It's only fitting that we meet
Alfie, the chauvinistic limo driver,
in bed, because that is where much
of the action, ahem, of the plot will
decidedly take place. Sure, he
seems cool — a good dresser who is
concerned about building his vo
cabulary (he has a "word of the
day" calendar, after all) and who is
unrelentingly tongue in cheek.

Meaning, he's clever, and yes, he'd
be happy to put his tongue in your
cheek.
After we've been formally intro
duced to Alfie, he wastes no time in
telling us exactly what he thinks.
Looking directly into the camera and
stating that his priorities are "wine
and women" (that's an exhaustive list,
by the way), Alfie takes us around
Manhattan and proves it to us.
Everywhere we go with Alfie
women stare, or wink, or flirt or re
mind us of the time they slept to
gether ... and when you start to feel
like maybe you really should hate
this slick ladies man, there is some
genuine quality that surfaces which
is enough to keep you interested. It
is perhaps this very quality that gets
Julie (Marisa Tomei), Lonette (Nia
Long), Nikki (Sienna Miller) and
Liz (Susan Sarandon) all involved
with Alfie. Or maybe it's just all the
tequila.
Through a series of vignettes,
we see that Alfie is really afraid of
commitment — to a job, to a friend

and especially to a woman.
When the going gets tough,
Alfie will just move on to some
thing else.
It's not until he encounters a
bit of erectile dysfunction that any
repercussions arise as a result of
his actions. Alfie finds himself
thinking about life, thinking
about death and befriending a
guy named Joe in the men's uri
nal. (Same thing happened to

Boh Dole.)
At times as thickly fulfilling as
reading the juicy part of a gossip col
umn, "Alfie" falls into more danger
ous territory when it concentrates on
the more "dramatic" plot elements.
The film generates an uneven feel
with its fluctuations between heavy is
sues and tawdry romance. While
"Alfie" has an ample supply of both,
the film does not use them to success
fully weave a satisfying story from
start to finish.
With "Alfie," we do get lots of
what we came for — sex, cheap
drama and Jude Law at his most pre
cocious— but ultimately," the film
leaves us on a sour note. We've fol
lowed Alfie through a lot of bed
rooms and we want to know which
one he will end up in. Will it belong to
Liz, the absinthe-drinking "older
woman"? Nikki, the retro-70s bi
polar chick? Or Julie, his "semi-regu
lar, quasi-girlfriend"?
Or will he just stand on a bridge
and ask philosophically, "What's it all
about?"
