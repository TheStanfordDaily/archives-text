"After the Sunset" — starring
Pierce Brosnan, Selma Hayek and
Woody Harrelson — opens at a Los
Angeles Lakers game. Has any movie
that starts with a sporting event (if the
movie is not about sports) been good?
It's usually compensation for some
thing that's lacking, and in this case,
the movie lacks character.
In"After the Sunset," Brosnan
and Hayek play two affectionate
lovers in retirement from a career of
diamond thievery. The have run off to
live a comfortable life in the
Caribbean away from the jurisdiction
of American law enforcement. Mean
while, FBI agent Lloyd (Harrelson)
has found them and decided to spend
some time with his arch nemesis in an
attempt to foil any further diamond
snatching attempts. Naturally, a large
cruise ship carrying a valuable dia
mond is anchored off the island. To
sum up, "After the Sunset" is a ro
mantic comedy set within a heist.
The principle actors in this movie
all play roles they are perfectly suited
for. More to the point, they play roles

they are type-casted for. Brosnan
plays a suave, intelligent robber with
an accent. Really, this is just James
Bond as a diamond thief instead of an
international espionage agent.
Harrelson takes on his standard
role as the crude, blue-color, Ameri
can slob working man. He's funny
and sleazy. It's the character you
wouldn't want to know personally,
but you always root for him to come
out on top in the end. It's also Harrel
son's primary fall-back character.
Then there's Selma Hayek's cleav
age ... errrr... Selma Hayek. She
retains her standard role as the sexy
woman who rarely speaks but can
kick any guy's ass. She struts around
the screen in skimpy bikinis. Whenev
er Brosnan — her lover — does
something she doesn't approve of,
she simply removes her clothes and

crawls on top of him (keep in mind
that it's PG-13 before you get your
hopes up, guys).
Since Brosnan can't be the only
character to get action during the
movie. "After the Sunset" throws in
Naomie Harris (known best as Selena
from "28 Days Later"). She plays a
sexy, island police officer in desperate
need of breaking a big case. She be-

comes Harrelson's completely
forced, unbelievable and incon
sequential love interest. Harris'
only purpose in the movie is to
look pretty and carry a gun.
The characters are the most
glaring weakness in"After the
Sunset." None of the characters
are well developed by their actors
— all of whom have impressive
acting resumes. The fault lies
with the script and the dialogue

that often seems unrealistic and
completely unnatural. The movie
makes poor use of talented profes
sionals who could have done much
more with better direction. Instead,
they all fall into their own caricatures.
Despite the weaknesses in charac
ter, the plot makes fora decently en
joyable 90 minutes. The few humor
ous interactions make up fora com
pletely unmemorable heist sequence.
Throw in handfuls of homoerotic
jokes, and the movie flows along.
It's not a great movie, but it's
not a terrible movie. It's just a for
gettable movie. If you watch it in
the theaters now, you won't re
member anything by the time it
shows on TNT. The ingredients for
a good movie are there (concept
and actors), but it never pulls itself
together to become a truly fun or
memorable experience.
