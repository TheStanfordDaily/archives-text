THE CAST

Writer/director Brad Bird
has one of those storied histories
that make you admire the idea of
self-determination. At age 11 he
was already making nis own
stop-motion animation films,
and by age 15 he'd found his
way into working for Disney
under the mentorsnip of one of
the company's most important
executives. He later went on to
work as a producer for both 'The
Simpsons and "King of the Hill."
His first feature-length ani
mation was 1999s "Iron Giant/'
in which he managed to craft the
simple, sweet tale of a lonely boy

and his giant robot friend from outer space. The critical success
of that film (coupled with the folding or the Warner Brothers an
imation studio) brought him to the attention of the people at
Pixar, who soon hired him to join their stable of creative talent.
In person, Bird looks not unlike one of his stylized char
acters from 'The Incredibles." With squintv eyes that peer at

you from behind glasses set

under a disheveled sweep

of sandy-blonde hair,

it's not hard to
imagine a digital

avatar of his sit
ting in a cubicle
next to the office
where Bob Parr
(a.k,a Mr. Incredi
ble) handles his
insurance claims.
Even the name
Brad Bird sounds
suspiciously like

the secret identity of
i r-\ .1 . A-

a superhero. One that flies
without a cape, almost cer-

tainly.
Much has been made of

the focus on family with 'The
Incredibles," and when
I J-i •!. r>: i •

pressed tor details Bird is
quick to reveal his inten-

tions.
"What I tried to do was hit
r• i i

on family archetypes

through the lens ot super
heroes," he explains. "So the

dad in the family is where they
always say 'You gotta be

strong, you gotta be strong
for your family!' so I made

him superstrong. Mothers

are always pulled in a mil-

lion different directions, so I .
had her be elastic. Teenagers, particularly teenage girls, are
insecure about their looks, so I had her be invisible. Ten
year-old boys are hyperactive energy balls, so I had him
nave superspeed, ana babies are kind of unrealized poten-

tial. So that's how I tried to
model it."
-I-l I* ■ • . * I *

The distinct visual im
pact of the characters
was also more than

intentional.
"Our goal was to

make something be-

lievable more than it

was to make it realistic," he
affirms. "Bob's hands are
i . .1 .. I • .1

about three times bigger than

his feet, so we had very stylized
characters, but at the same time we

wanted to make them convincing.
We wanted people to get involved

with them and believe that thev had
pasts and futures and hopes and fears,
so we had this sort of stylized world tfiat

we wanted to make convincing. The no-

tion was to capture the essence of a type
rather than the literal aspect."

It's clear whv Bird's ideas are so suited to
animation, witn both plot and character de-

sign incorporating elements of the visually fan
tastic which coula only be realized through the
magic of Pixar artists.

In the film, Mr. Incredible is whisked away to an i
archetypal island fortress that seems straight out of

James Bond super-villain territory. Again, the resem-

blance is not coincidental.

"It's really more the spy genre than it is any specific

thing. [The film's setting] was kind of meant to be the fu
ture as seen from 1960 to 66, so even though we have

technology that's more advanced than anything they had in
that time, it's meant to kind of look like it was designed in that
period. It just seemed right to me. and I also wanted that feel
ing in the music as well - kind of a brassier, jazzier ap
proach to music which many of the composers aid in the mid
605."
For all its humanity, though, 'The Incredibles" wouldn't be
complete without that staple known as the action sequence.
Bird s sequences are so neat and tightly integrated into the
story, in fact, that one sometimes forgets to appreciate them.
When asked about directorial influences he s quick to focus
on what he calls "good action direction." He names James
Cameron, Steven Spielberg and George Miller as the best
action directors: "I think that often times other people get
away with a lot of coverage and fast cutting but their stag
ing is kind of incoherent, and then they feel like if put
enough loud sound effects in there nobody will notice.'
"Iron Giant" was composed primarily with hand-drawn
animation, and when asked whether that medium will go the
way of the dinosaur, Bird is still hopeful.
'People are attributing the success of cgi films to the meat
of the technology and not to the fact that they have by and
large been more original and interesting films than the ones
done in hand-drawn. Nick Park (of Wallace and Gromit
fame) works with clay, and I don't think his films would be
any better if they were in CG. Hayao Miyazaki ("Princess
Mononoke" and "Spirited Away )works in hand-drawn,
and he uses the computer occasionally to help out the way
something looks, but I don't think his films would be any
more magical if they were in CG.
For Bird, animation of any kind seems to be the ideal
medium to allow his stories to soar.

In light of one of the most historic baseball seasons in
recent memory, perhaps it's only fitting to start off with an
overwrought metaphor for that hallowed American pas
time. No one bats a thousand. And much like the most suc
cessful sluggers in baseball, no movie studio can produce
a perfectly spotless record of bona fide box office hits.
Unless that studio happens to be Pixar. Beginning with
'Toy Story," Fixer's reputation for making heartfelt, visual
ly stunning animated features that also nappen to make
boatloads of cash has stayed picture perfect through all
five of its films.
Still, so much success seems like a setup for the obliga
tory fall. No one thinks it's possible — you can't lose a se
ries when you're up 3-0, right? — but one of these days
Pixar is destined to swing and miss.
Thankfully, that day has yet to come. 'The Incredibles"
is Pixar's first picture to actually focus on human charac
ters. Yes, these are superheroes we're dealing with, but as
this past summer's excellent "Spider-man 2" also showed
us, heroes have their problems too. Chalk up this depth to
writer/director Brad Bird, the newcomer to Pixar whose
"Iron Giant" is often citea as one of the most underrated
animated films of the 90s.
'The Incredibles" begins with a sly newsreel document-

ing the heyday of superheroes, when masked avengers
were as plentiful as popcorn. Chief among the do-good-

ers are Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl (voiced by Craig T.
k I I 111 II I I L tl I. I I

Nelson and Holly Hunter, respectively), one a dashing

strongman and the other a Gumby-like

wonderwoman. Unfortunately, a

wave of lawsuits brings down the

superhero industry and forces
everyone into hiding through the
Superhero Relocation Program.
Cut to present day, when the

now-married Mr. Incredible and

Elastigirl live out their lives as Bob and
Helen Parr. Bob works as an insurance

agent, and Helen plays doting house
wife. To add to their everyday malaise,

they've also grown a rambunc
tious but superpowered family,
including daughter Violet, son

Dash and baby Jack. The only one who
can sympathize with them is Bob's old

friend, Lucius Best (a delight-

fully indignant bamuel L
Jackson), who once can

hero Frozone.

When a mysterious
woman named Mirage

contacts Bob to do su-

Eerhero work as Mr. Incredible he signs up immediately
ut keeps his new job a secret from the rest of the family.
Eventually, Bob goes missing, and it's up to the other In
credibles to find and recover him.
The film's visual style is an appealing fusion of classic
Pixar informed by Bird's realistic environments, set in a
retro-futurist style that exudes the classic cool of old spy se
rials and the golden age of superheroes.
Despite advancements in animating realistic-looking
figures, Bird has chosen to populate his digital world witn
cartoonish caricatures. Eacn character is an exaggerated
body-type — from Frozone's impossibly oblong nead to
Bob s gnome-like work supervisor to Miraae's svelte tooth
pick figure. Bird saves all nis best lines (and his own voice)
for Edna Mode, the weirdly chic designer of all the super
heroes' costumes whose pithy one-liners are a complete
gas.
As always, though what it really boils down to is story,
and here 'The Increaibles" exhibits the same heart ana
emotional gravitas that rendered "Iron Giant" so endear
ing.
"Everyone's special, so no one's special," Dash grum
bles about the prevailing philosophy at school, and the
paradox rings true.
Ditto the relationship between Bob and Helen, who for
all their squabbles are really just another couple trying to
hold their ramily together.
"Finding Nemo seemed to universally capture audi
ences in a way that will be difficult to reproduce, and I sus
pect that for many 'The Incredibles" will inevitably be a let
down of sorts — there aren't as many cute, endearing
characters, and the film deals with crime and
.i.i 'i

violence in a way that seems
a little too simplistic for com-

fort. In truth, though, Bird has

THE CAST

Writer/director Brad Bird
has one of those storied histories
that make you admire the idea of
self-determination. At age 11 he
was already making nis own
stop-motion animation films,
and by age 15 he'd found his
way into working for Disney
under the mentorsnip of one of
the company's most important
executives. He later went on to
work as a producer for both 'The
Simpsons and "King of the Hill."
His first feature-length ani
mation was 1999s "Iron Giant/'
in which he managed to craft the
simple, sweet tale of a lonely boy

and his giant robot friend from outer space. The critical success
of that film (coupled with the folding or the Warner Brothers an
imation studio) brought him to the attention of the people at
Pixar, who soon hired him to join their stable of creative talent.
In person, Bird looks not unlike one of his stylized char
acters from 'The Incredibles." With squintv eyes that peer at

you from behind glasses set

under a disheveled sweep

of sandy-blonde hair,

it's not hard to
imagine a digital

avatar of his sit
ting in a cubicle
next to the office
where Bob Parr
(a.k,a Mr. Incredi
ble) handles his
insurance claims.
Even the name
Brad Bird sounds
suspiciously like

the secret identity of
i r-\ .1 . A-

a superhero. One that flies
without a cape, almost cer-

tainly.
Much has been made of

the focus on family with 'The
Incredibles," and when
I J-i •!. r>: i •

pressed tor details Bird is
quick to reveal his inten-

tions.
"What I tried to do was hit
r• i i

on family archetypes

through the lens ot super
heroes," he explains. "So the

dad in the family is where they
always say 'You gotta be

strong, you gotta be strong
for your family!' so I made

him superstrong. Mothers

are always pulled in a mil-

lion different directions, so I .
had her be elastic. Teenagers, particularly teenage girls, are
insecure about their looks, so I had her be invisible. Ten
year-old boys are hyperactive energy balls, so I had him
nave superspeed, ana babies are kind of unrealized poten-

tial. So that's how I tried to
model it."
-I-l I* ■ • . * I *

The distinct visual im
pact of the characters
was also more than

intentional.
"Our goal was to

make something be-

lievable more than it

was to make it realistic," he
affirms. "Bob's hands are
i . .1 .. I • .1

about three times bigger than

his feet, so we had very stylized
characters, but at the same time we

wanted to make them convincing.
We wanted people to get involved

with them and believe that thev had
pasts and futures and hopes and fears,
so we had this sort of stylized world tfiat

we wanted to make convincing. The no-

tion was to capture the essence of a type
rather than the literal aspect."

It's clear whv Bird's ideas are so suited to
animation, witn both plot and character de-

sign incorporating elements of the visually fan
tastic which coula only be realized through the
magic of Pixar artists.

In the film, Mr. Incredible is whisked away to an i
archetypal island fortress that seems straight out of

James Bond super-villain territory. Again, the resem-

blance is not coincidental.

"It's really more the spy genre than it is any specific

thing. [The film's setting] was kind of meant to be the fu
ture as seen from 1960 to 66, so even though we have

technology that's more advanced than anything they had in
that time, it's meant to kind of look like it was designed in that
period. It just seemed right to me. and I also wanted that feel
ing in the music as well - kind of a brassier, jazzier ap
proach to music which many of the composers aid in the mid
605."
For all its humanity, though, 'The Incredibles" wouldn't be
complete without that staple known as the action sequence.
Bird s sequences are so neat and tightly integrated into the
story, in fact, that one sometimes forgets to appreciate them.
When asked about directorial influences he s quick to focus
on what he calls "good action direction." He names James
Cameron, Steven Spielberg and George Miller as the best
action directors: "I think that often times other people get
away with a lot of coverage and fast cutting but their stag
ing is kind of incoherent, and then they feel like if put
enough loud sound effects in there nobody will notice.'
"Iron Giant" was composed primarily with hand-drawn
animation, and when asked whether that medium will go the
way of the dinosaur, Bird is still hopeful.
'People are attributing the success of cgi films to the meat
of the technology and not to the fact that they have by and
large been more original and interesting films than the ones
done in hand-drawn. Nick Park (of Wallace and Gromit
fame) works with clay, and I don't think his films would be
any better if they were in CG. Hayao Miyazaki ("Princess
Mononoke" and "Spirited Away )works in hand-drawn,
and he uses the computer occasionally to help out the way
something looks, but I don't think his films would be any
more magical if they were in CG.
For Bird, animation of any kind seems to be the ideal
medium to allow his stories to soar.

In light of one of the most historic baseball seasons in
recent memory, perhaps it's only fitting to start off with an
overwrought metaphor for that hallowed American pas
time. No one bats a thousand. And much like the most suc
cessful sluggers in baseball, no movie studio can produce
a perfectly spotless record of bona fide box office hits.
Unless that studio happens to be Pixar. Beginning with
'Toy Story," Fixer's reputation for making heartfelt, visual
ly stunning animated features that also nappen to make
boatloads of cash has stayed picture perfect through all
five of its films.
Still, so much success seems like a setup for the obliga
tory fall. No one thinks it's possible — you can't lose a se
ries when you're up 3-0, right? — but one of these days
Pixar is destined to swing and miss.
Thankfully, that day has yet to come. 'The Incredibles"
is Pixar's first picture to actually focus on human charac
ters. Yes, these are superheroes we're dealing with, but as
this past summer's excellent "Spider-man 2" also showed
us, heroes have their problems too. Chalk up this depth to
writer/director Brad Bird, the newcomer to Pixar whose
"Iron Giant" is often citea as one of the most underrated
animated films of the 90s.
'The Incredibles" begins with a sly newsreel document-

ing the heyday of superheroes, when masked avengers
were as plentiful as popcorn. Chief among the do-good-

ers are Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl (voiced by Craig T.
k I I 111 II I I L tl I. I I

Nelson and Holly Hunter, respectively), one a dashing

strongman and the other a Gumby-like

wonderwoman. Unfortunately, a

wave of lawsuits brings down the

superhero industry and forces
everyone into hiding through the
Superhero Relocation Program.
Cut to present day, when the

now-married Mr. Incredible and

Elastigirl live out their lives as Bob and
Helen Parr. Bob works as an insurance

agent, and Helen plays doting house
wife. To add to their everyday malaise,

they've also grown a rambunc
tious but superpowered family,
including daughter Violet, son

Dash and baby Jack. The only one who
can sympathize with them is Bob's old

friend, Lucius Best (a delight-

Jackson), who once can

When a mysterious
woman named Mirage

contacts Bob to do su-

Eerhero work as Mr. Incredible he signs up immediately
ut keeps his new job a secret from the rest of the family.
Eventually, Bob goes missing, and it's up to the other In
credibles to find and recover him.
The film's visual style is an appealing fusion of classic
Pixar informed by Bird's realistic environments, set in a
retro-futurist style that exudes the classic cool of old spy se
rials and the golden age of superheroes.
Despite advancements in animating realistic-looking
figures, Bird has chosen to populate his digital world witn
cartoonish caricatures. Eacn character is an exaggerated
body-type — from Frozone's impossibly oblong nead to
Bob s gnome-like work supervisor to Miraae's svelte tooth
pick figure. Bird saves all nis best lines (and his own voice)
for Edna Mode, the weirdly chic designer of all the super
heroes' costumes whose pithy one-liners are a complete
gas.
As always, though what it really boils down to is story,
and here 'The Increaibles" exhibits the same heart ana
emotional gravitas that rendered "Iron Giant" so endear

THE CAST

Writer/director Brad Bird
has one of those storied histories
that make you admire the idea of
self-determination. At age 11 he
was already making nis own
stop-motion animation films,
and by age 15 he'd found his
way into working for Disney
under the mentorsnip of one of
the company's most important
executives. He later went on to
work as a producer for both 'The
Simpsons and "King of the Hill."
His first feature-length ani
mation was 1999s "Iron Giant/'
in which he managed to craft the
simple, sweet tale of a lonely boy

and his giant robot friend from outer space. The critical success
of that film (coupled with the folding or the Warner Brothers an
imation studio) brought him to the attention of the people at
Pixar, who soon hired him to join their stable of creative talent.
In person, Bird looks not unlike one of his stylized char
acters from 'The Incredibles." With squintv eyes that peer at

you from behind glasses set

under a disheveled sweep

of sandy-blonde hair,

it's not hard to
imagine a digital

avatar of his sit
ting in a cubicle
next to the office
where Bob Parr
(a.k,a Mr. Incredi
ble) handles his
insurance claims.
Even the name
Brad Bird sounds
suspiciously like

the secret identity of
i r-\ .1 . A-

a superhero. One that flies
without a cape, almost cer-

tainly.
Much has been made of

the focus on family with 'The
Incredibles," and when
I J-i •!. r>: i •

pressed tor details Bird is
quick to reveal his inten-

tions.
"What I tried to do was hit
r• i i

on family archetypes

through the lens ot super
heroes," he explains. "So the

dad in the family is where they
always say 'You gotta be

strong, you gotta be strong
for your family!' so I made

him superstrong. Mothers

are always pulled in a mil-

lion different directions, so I .
had her be elastic. Teenagers, particularly teenage girls, are
insecure about their looks, so I had her be invisible. Ten
year-old boys are hyperactive energy balls, so I had him
nave superspeed, ana babies are kind of unrealized poten-

tial. So that's how I tried to
model it."
-I-l I* ■ • . * I *

The distinct visual im
pact of the characters
was also more than

intentional.
"Our goal was to

make something be-

lievable more than it

was to make it realistic," he
affirms. "Bob's hands are
i . .1 .. I • .1

about three times bigger than

his feet, so we had very stylized
characters, but at the same time we

wanted to make them convincing.
We wanted people to get involved

with them and believe that thev had
pasts and futures and hopes and fears,
so we had this sort of stylized world tfiat

we wanted to make convincing. The no-

tion was to capture the essence of a type
rather than the literal aspect."

It's clear whv Bird's ideas are so suited to
animation, witn both plot and character de-

sign incorporating elements of the visually fan
tastic which coula only be realized through the
magic of Pixar artists.

In the film, Mr. Incredible is whisked away to an i
archetypal island fortress that seems straight out of

James Bond super-villain territory. Again, the resem-

blance is not coincidental.

"It's really more the spy genre than it is any specific

thing. [The film's setting] was kind of meant to be the fu
ture as seen from 1960 to 66, so even though we have

technology that's more advanced than anything they had in
that time, it's meant to kind of look like it was designed in that
period. It just seemed right to me. and I also wanted that feel
ing in the music as well - kind of a brassier, jazzier ap
proach to music which many of the composers aid in the mid
605."
For all its humanity, though, 'The Incredibles" wouldn't be
complete without that staple known as the action sequence.
Bird s sequences are so neat and tightly integrated into the
story, in fact, that one sometimes forgets to appreciate them.
When asked about directorial influences he s quick to focus
on what he calls "good action direction." He names James
Cameron, Steven Spielberg and George Miller as the best
action directors: "I think that often times other people get
away with a lot of coverage and fast cutting but their stag
ing is kind of incoherent, and then they feel like if put
enough loud sound effects in there nobody will notice.'
"Iron Giant" was composed primarily with hand-drawn
animation, and when asked whether that medium will go the
way of the dinosaur, Bird is still hopeful.
'People are attributing the success of cgi films to the meat
of the technology and not to the fact that they have by and
large been more original and interesting films than the ones
done in hand-drawn. Nick Park (of Wallace and Gromit
fame) works with clay, and I don't think his films would be
any better if they were in CG. Hayao Miyazaki ("Princess
Mononoke" and "Spirited Away )works in hand-drawn,
and he uses the computer occasionally to help out the way
something looks, but I don't think his films would be any
more magical if they were in CG.
For Bird, animation of any kind seems to be the ideal
medium to allow his stories to soar.

In light of one of the most historic baseball seasons in
recent memory, perhaps it's only fitting to start off with an
overwrought metaphor for that hallowed American pas
time. No one bats a thousand. And much like the most suc
cessful sluggers in baseball, no movie studio can produce
a perfectly spotless record of bona fide box office hits.
Unless that studio happens to be Pixar. Beginning with
'Toy Story," Fixer's reputation for making heartfelt, visual
ly stunning animated features that also nappen to make
boatloads of cash has stayed picture perfect through all
five of its films.
Still, so much success seems like a setup for the obliga
tory fall. No one thinks it's possible — you can't lose a se
ries when you're up 3-0, right? — but one of these days
Pixar is destined to swing and miss.
Thankfully, that day has yet to come. 'The Incredibles"
is Pixar's first picture to actually focus on human charac
ters. Yes, these are superheroes we're dealing with, but as
this past summer's excellent "Spider-man 2" also showed
us, heroes have their problems too. Chalk up this depth to
writer/director Brad Bird, the newcomer to Pixar whose
"Iron Giant" is often citea as one of the most underrated
animated films of the 90s.
'The Incredibles" begins with a sly newsreel document-

ing the heyday of superheroes, when masked avengers
were as plentiful as popcorn. Chief among the do-good-

ers are Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl (voiced by Craig T.
k I I 111 II I I L tl I. I I

Nelson and Holly Hunter, respectively), one a dashing

strongman and the other a Gumby-like

wonderwoman. Unfortunately, a

wave of lawsuits brings down the

superhero industry and forces
everyone into hiding through the
Superhero Relocation Program.
Cut to present day, when the

now-married Mr. Incredible and

Elastigirl live out their lives as Bob and
Helen Parr. Bob works as an insurance

agent, and Helen plays doting house
wife. To add to their everyday malaise,

they've also grown a rambunc
tious but superpowered family,
