## Casting call: Election 2004, THE MOVIE, biatch 
### TOM HANADA INTERMISSION CO-EDITOR 
Audiences around the nation
watched for hours. There was sus
pense. There were villains and saviors.
The dialogue was filled with lies,
greed, corruption and deceit. There
were cliffhangers and surprises. And
more than a few people left with tears
in their eyes.
Yep. the presidential election of
2004 had a little bit of everything. And,
as is the case with any major historical

event, it is only a
matter of time he
fore some producer
gets his hands on
the rights and cre
ates the next Holly
wood blockbuster.
Well. Intermis
sion beat the Bruck
heimers and Wein
steins to "Election
2004: The Movie"
by already estab
lishing a cast. Relive
this timeless, classic
moment again and
again.

Bill Murray as George W. Bush: Mur
ray's talents lie in being able to portray
a fool who actually considers himself
intelligent. This role requires an actor
who can manage awkward pauses

while imitating Bush's cute little mon
key face. Murray's comedic training
would be perfect for inventing words
and making nonsensical remarks.
Anyone who has seen "Ghost
busters" or "Scrooged" knows that
Murray can walk with the arrogant
swagger Bush embodies while ad-lib-

bing the most inane
comments. If any
one can repeat the
same lines over and
over during a debate
and still look funny,
it's Bill Murray.
Kevin Costner as
John Kerry: When
casting for the role of
Kerry, one must first
find an actor who can
appear as stiff on the

screen as Kerry does.
The actor needs to infuse his speech
with false passion and a general im-

pression of deceit.
Basically, the role of Kerry
requires someone who ain't act
at all. This makes Kevin Costner
perfect for the part because nei
ther he nor Kerry is likable or in
spiring. Costner also has the cre
dentials for this role. His part as
the nomadic mutant in "Water
World" parallels Kerry's perfor
mance in "Swift Boat World"
and nobody else cares about ei
ther performance. "Field of
Dreams?" We won't even touch
that. All the director needs to do
is hand Costner his lines and he

can deliver them as unconvincingly as
Kerry without even trying.
Tom Cruise as John Edwards: This one

is too easy. That con
stant disarming grin,
lustrous wavy hair
and the impression of
an attractive, charis
matic middle-aged
(but still virile) man
makes Cruise the
perfect choice to play
Edwards. Neither
one has done much in
their careers except
look good. Cruise
could just smile his

way through the "Election 2004: The
Movie" with an occasional flirta
tious line directed at some lonely
housewife.

Steve Buscemi as Dick Cheney: Un
fortunately. this casting choice is
more about performance style than
physical appearance. It's fairly diffi

cult to find an actor who fits Dick Ch
eney's character physically, but
Buscemi can capture Dick's personal
ity better than any other actor we can

think of. What role has Busce
mi played throughout his ca
reer, whether in "Fargo" or
"Reservoir Dogs?" The
weasel. And what has Dick
Cheney been throughout his
political career? The weasel.
Talk about excellent type
casting. The two are perfect
for each other because both
Cheney's and Buscemi's
characters will do anything
to get ahead. They embody a
kind of sickening distaste for
humanity. They're both in-

telligent slimeballs. Give Buscemi
some glasses and shave his head and
he can play the Dick as well as any
one.



From IMDB com
So much sadness, and so little similarity regarding hair.

If s a tight race, kids, but whose hairline will recede first?

The long-lost weasely brothers. Eww.


Fiom IMDB.com
Both of them have the right-side part, wrong-side attitude.
