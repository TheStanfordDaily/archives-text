# Jack and Bobby: It's really not about the Kennedys — well, kinda
## 
### DARREN FRANICH INTERMISSION AVID WB FAN 
My roommate Andrew is a vi
ciously smart and intensely cultured
type. I lis wall boasts Dali, Bosch, Van
Gogh ("Starry Night." of course) and
Picasso, to say nothing of the mini-
Buddha statue and the Hindi sculp
ture. Next to all that is my corner, be
decked in Eastwood, All, Batman,
"Goldfinger," WWII propaganda
camp ("RUMORS COST US
LIVES") and the suave one-sheet for
Steven Soderbergh's pulp master
work, "The Limey."
The contrast stands out. Sort of
like a screaming idiot man-child sit
ting next to Leonardo Da Vinci. But
Andrew's very unpretentious: he
likes watching "Aqua Teen" and
telling dirty jokes and napping.
Whereas I'm the snobbiest cultural
bottom-feeder. 1 know: I throw out
phrases like "filmic aesthetic" and
"greatest BLANK of our generation"
like a preppie scumbag with a the

saurus fora brain.
An example of our ideological dif
ferentiation: Andrew loves TV be
cause it does its job: entertaining the
masses very well. I love TV because
it's an evocative, hyperreal mirror
window into humanity in all its banal,
fantastic inglory. We get along great.
A few weeks ago. I cajoled An
drew into watching "Jack & Bobby,"
the new teen drama with a killer con
cept: One of the two suggestively
named titular brothers living in pre
sent-day suburbia will become presi
dent in 2040 (Bobby, the younger and
nerdier). The show crosscuts between
the brothers' present-day high-school
travails and 204K, where talking heads
engage in A&E style discussions of
the outgoing president.
It's an intriguing gimmick, but a
gimmick nevertheless, one with the
eternal propensity for camp. It is not,
by any means, the reason to watch the
show: As Andrew notes," 'One Tree
Mill' or 'Everwood' would also be
praised for their astute political in

sights if they had come up with this
idea before." It's a hook, nothing
more: Think "24" and real-time.
What makes the show great is its
outspoken, articulate idealism: Not
since the glory days of "The West
Wing" has a show tackled such topical
ideas with such zip. Narratively. "Jack
& Bobby" is not far removed from the
average WB weep-show. Hut the the
central conceit, that Bobby's present
day experiences are all formation for
his eventual presidential self, embold
ens the show to dig into such hack-

neyed "Very-
Special-
Episode" top
ics as religion,
sexism, fami
ly, even love,
with vitality
and a dexter
ous wit.
An aver
age episode
unfolds like a
presidential

debate without time limits or social
niceties: The characters argue quite
impressively, quite often — doubly in
vigorated by the self-assurance of their
ideas and vicious thrill of their verbal
sparring. Almost everyone on the
show, conservative or liberal, is almost
always wrong but almost nearly right.
Everyone is also plagued by an in
fectious curiosity, a weird, burning
need for knowledge. It's that inge
niously democratic undertone which
makes the show the most important
political enterprise on TV right now:

Imagine if " The Daily Show" sudden
ly began wearing its heart on its
sleeve.
In the true spirit of democracy, in
all its cacophonous glory, I'm also
presenting Andrew's review of the
show.
"Its special," he admits, "because
it takes on cultural issues such as reli
gion and politics," adding, "or at least,
it's as special as 'Seventh Heaven.'"
BANG! Jack and Bobby's mom, col
lege professor and resident left
winger with an occasional hankering
fora joint, is a "pontificating, control
ling, secular-humanist she-b****" of a
woman," and "what a Hollywood
writer imagines a Midwestern viewer
imagines an East Coast professor to
be like." POW! Every episode is the
same: "It's Malibu Stacy but with a
new hat!" BOOM!
What's fascinating is that what I
love most about the show, its tenacity
in tackling intriguing issues, is ironi


From IMDC com
The real two are dead, so we got these crappy child substitutes
cally what Andrew dislikes: "Just because
the stupid liberal causes are complicated
and nuanced doesn't make this show com
plicated or nuanced. The culture and poli
tics side of the show is a lot like 'Cross-Fire'
except far more hyperbolic: a piece of the
ater where the conflict is the real engage
ment and the ideas are only props."
Like me. my roomie cares deeply about
the featured topics, but where I'm moved by
the high-intelligence drama. Andrew sees

shallow caricature and ideological lip-ser
vice. The show is "intellectually dishonest
and really, really annoying."
In short: Check out "Jack & Bobby." It
may inspire you, it may annoy you, but it's a
weird bastion of political dialogue in the net
work drama, a medium dominated by soap
operatic glamour like shows such as "The
0.C." and procedural pulp criminality (the
franchises "CSI" and "Ixiw and Order"). It'll
get vou talking.

the high-intelligence drama. Andrew sees

shallow caricature and ideological lip-ser
vice. The show is "intellectually dishonest
and really, really annoying."
In short: Check out "Jack & Bobby." It
may inspire you, it may annoy you, but it's a
weird bastion of political dialogue in the net
work drama, a medium dominated by soap
operatic glamour like shows such as "The
0.C." and procedural pulp criminality (the
franchises "CSI" and "Ixiw and Order"). It'll
get vou talking.

Jack and Bobby get it on
My roommate Andrew is a vi
ciously smart and intensely cultured
type. I lis wall boasts Dali, Bosch, Van
Gogh ("Starry Night." of course) and
Picasso, to say nothing of the mini-
Buddha statue and the Hindi sculp
ture. Next to all that is my corner, be
decked in Eastwood, All, Batman,
"Goldfinger," WWII propaganda
camp ("RUMORS COST US
LIVES") and the suave one-sheet for
Steven Soderbergh's pulp master
work, "The Limey."
The contrast stands out. Sort of
like a screaming idiot man-child sit
ting next to Leonardo Da Vinci. But
Andrew's very unpretentious: he
likes watching "Aqua Teen" and
telling dirty jokes and napping.
Whereas I'm the snobbiest cultural
bottom-feeder. 1 know: I throw out
phrases like "filmic aesthetic" and
"greatest BLANK of our generation"
like a preppie scumbag with a the

saurus fora brain.
An example of our ideological dif
ferentiation: Andrew loves TV be
cause it does its job: entertaining the
masses very well. I love TV because
it's an evocative, hyperreal mirror
window into humanity in all its banal,
fantastic inglory. We get along great.
A few weeks ago. I cajoled An
drew into watching "Jack & Bobby,"
the new teen drama with a killer con
cept: One of the two suggestively
named titular brothers living in pre
sent-day suburbia will become presi
dent in 2040 (Bobby, the younger and
nerdier). The show crosscuts between
the brothers' present-day high-school
travails and 204K, where talking heads
engage in A&E style discussions of
the outgoing president.
It's an intriguing gimmick, but a
gimmick nevertheless, one with the
eternal propensity for camp. It is not,
by any means, the reason to watch the
show: As Andrew notes," 'One Tree
Mill' or 'Everwood' would also be
praised for their astute political in

sights if they had come up with this
idea before." It's a hook, nothing
more: Think "24" and real-time.
What makes the show great is its
outspoken, articulate idealism: Not
since the glory days of "The West
Wing" has a show tackled such topical
ideas with such zip. Narratively. "Jack
& Bobby" is not far removed from the
average WB weep-show. Hut the the
central conceit, that Bobby's present
day experiences are all formation for
his eventual presidential self, embold
ens the show to dig into such hack-

neyed "Very-
Special-
Episode" top
ics as religion,
sexism, fami
ly, even love,
with vitality
and a dexter
ous wit.
An aver
age episode
unfolds like a
presidential

debate without time limits or social
niceties: The characters argue quite
impressively, quite often — doubly in
vigorated by the self-assurance of their
ideas and vicious thrill of their verbal
sparring. Almost everyone on the
show, conservative or liberal, is almost
always wrong but almost nearly right.
Everyone is also plagued by an in
fectious curiosity, a weird, burning
need for knowledge. It's that inge
niously democratic undertone which
makes the show the most important
political enterprise on TV right now:

Imagine if " The Daily Show" sudden
ly began wearing its heart on its
sleeve.
In the true spirit of democracy, in
all its cacophonous glory, I'm also
presenting Andrew's review of the
show.
"Its special," he admits, "because
it takes on cultural issues such as reli
gion and politics," adding, "or at least,
it's as special as 'Seventh Heaven.'"
BANG! Jack and Bobby's mom, col
lege professor and resident left
winger with an occasional hankering
fora joint, is a "pontificating, control
ling, secular-humanist she-b****" of a
woman," and "what a Hollywood
writer imagines a Midwestern viewer
imagines an East Coast professor to
be like." POW! Every episode is the
same: "It's Malibu Stacy but with a
new hat!" BOOM!
What's fascinating is that what I
love most about the show, its tenacity
in tackling intriguing issues, is ironi

The real two are dead, so we got these crappy child substitutes

the stupid liberal causes are complicated
and nuanced doesn't make this show com
plicated or nuanced. The culture and poli
