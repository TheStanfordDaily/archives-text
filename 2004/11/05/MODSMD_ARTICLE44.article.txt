Remember that time in the eighth grade when you had a crush on the girl who sat in front of you
in math class? Remember when she gave you that very special mixtape? Sure, it sucked, but every
one has a fond memory or two of their first experience with the art of the mix.
A good mixtape can communicate what words never could — feelings, emotions and all that
other fuzzy stuff. Stuff that you can't say to the mixtape recipient's face, like "I've had this crush on
you for three years but never had the guts to tell you, so I'm trying to convey that through this care
ful selection of songs which may include Peter Gabriel's 'In Your Eyes.'"
But music playlists have more practical purposes, too. Sometimes you need good music to study.
Sometimes, the perfect playlist can help you forget that you have no friends... and you can't seem
to get better than an A-minus in I-Hum ... and the girl you like is sleeping with the RA ... come to
think of it, what are you doing at Stanford anyway?
Playlists are amazingly adaptable. Remember when it sounded like that couple upstairs was hav
ing sex on trampolines? Well, they were, but that's not the point (although they do have our utmost
respect). If you had just switched on some bass-heavy late '90s pop-punk, you would have forgotten
about those traumatizing creaking noises and ceiling vibrations in no time.
But not everyone can design the perfect playlist, so over the next few weeks the musical genius
es here at Intermission will bring you the ideal music fora variety of occasions — some serious, some
not. So sit back, relax and enjoy our salute to the mixtape.

Remember that time in the eighth grade when you had a crush on the girl who sat in front of you
in math class? Remember when she gave you that very special mixtape? Sure, it sucked, but every
one has a fond memory or two of their first experience with the art of the mix.
A good mixtape can communicate what words never could — feelings, emotions and all that
other fuzzy stuff. Stuff that you can't say to the mixtape recipient's face, like "I've had this crush on
you for three years but never had the guts to tell you, so I'm trying to convey that through this care
ful selection of songs which may include Peter Gabriel's 'In Your Eyes.'"
But music playlists have more practical purposes, too. Sometimes you need good music to study.
Sometimes, the perfect playlist can help you forget that you have no friends... and you can't seem
to get better than an A-minus in I-Hum ... and the girl you like is sleeping with the RA ... come to
think of it, what are you doing at Stanford anyway?
Playlists are amazingly adaptable. Remember when it sounded like that couple upstairs was hav
ing sex on trampolines? Well, they were, but that's not the point (although they do have our utmost
respect). If you had just switched on some bass-heavy late '90s pop-punk, you would have forgotten
about those traumatizing creaking noises and ceiling vibrations in no time.
But not everyone can design the perfect playlist, so over the next few weeks the musical genius
es here at Intermission will bring you the ideal music fora variety of occasions — some serious, some
not. So sit back, relax and enjoy our salute to the mixtape.
