### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
I3id you ever suspect that Roxy
Sass could get off during a visit to a sci
ence museum? Well, it happened dur
ing my last trip to Los Angeles when I
stopped in at the California Science
Center and spent several hours trying
not to jump the bones of the sexiest
Germans ever. Ever wonder what
happens when you donate your body
to science? You become Roxy's latest
sex fantasy.
Leave it to German scientists to
come up with a concept like plastina
tion. currently on a display called
"Body World: An Anatomical Exhib
it of Real Human Bodies." They take

dead bodies, place them in a
vacuum to remove fat and
water, cover them with a liq
uid plastic and then pose
them in various positions he
fore they get hard. You'll
even find some lovely hunks
of meat contemplating a
chess game.
Once they're good and
rigid. I can brush up on my
anatomy. There's a lot that
Stanford boys can learn from,
these hard, plastic corpses.
For starters, plastinated
men know when not to talk.
They never talk. These guys
know the meaning of post
coital "quiet time." Instead
of indulging in cocksure
braggadocio or modestly in
secure self-deprecation,
these men just stand there
and let their bodies speak for

themselves.
Their bodies are all muscle. Sure,
their fat was sucked out with a high
intensity vacuum to ease the replace
ment of their tissues with plastic, but if
every guy had this dedication, there
would he no need for gyms. The sim
ple removal of fat and water results in
an automatic six-pack.
And this leads to the confidence
that so many men sadly lack. I didn't
hear any of these plastinated Ger
mans bitching about their bodies,
their genitalia, their lady problems or
the fact that some sick scientist ripped
off their skin and cut open their or
gans so that school kids could draw
them during field trips. Have any
Stanford men gone through that? No.

so quit whining.
Removing your fat doesn't just
make your formerly rippling muscles
stand out. it also increases your penis
size. Being an expert on phallic arts. I
immediately noticed that these men
were much more well-endowed than
the Californians I usually interact
with on campus. At first, I figured it
was just a German thing. I mean, of all
the European races, wouldn't you ex
pect the Germans to he equipped well
enough to rape the world?
But then I realized that the dan
gling inches of my plastinated lovers
was also a function of the lack of fat.
On average, two inches of the penis is
hidden beneath the surface of the skin
and thus will never service any willing
user. However, strip away the fat and
what remains is the full penis and
package in all its dried, plastinated
glory. So many men fret about cock
size— pumps, pills and faulty mea
suring techniques will never prove as
effective as letting Germans embalm
your unit with plastic.
Although "Body Worlds" aided in
further enamoring me with the penis,
it accomplished the exact opposite
with its nearby body cavity, the anus.
Maybe it was the sight of the shriveled
little tube hatch protruding out the
back of these people and turned me
off from anal sex. Perhaps the extend
ed intestines made me reconsider in
serting anything in that tunnel.
Most likely, it was the cross-section
of the constipated rectum that made
me decide that the anus is not some
thing I want to play with for the time
being. Entrance will solely be admit
ted through the front door from now
on.
Finally, plastic Germans reminded
me of some important advice: Wear a
fucking condom. The embalmed
woman reclining on her side isn't real
ly shooting you a "come hither" look
— the eight-month-old fetus inside her
engorged bellv shows the downside to
being sexually promiscuous. So if you
ever run into Roxy Sass at a party and
try to impress her with your new plasti
nated dong, you had better not fill her
uterus with a plastic embryo.
If you ever want Rosy Sass to plea
sure herself in a museum while fanta
sizing about you, donate your body to
science. Or learn how to give good
head.

If s true. White men can't jump. But skinless men — eh, it's a bit different for them.

Hey, the right one actually hangs lower!
I3id you ever suspect that Roxy
Sass could get off during a visit to a sci
ence museum? Well, it happened dur
ing my last trip to Los Angeles when I
stopped in at the California Science
Center and spent several hours trying
not to jump the bones of the sexiest
Germans ever. Ever wonder what
happens when you donate your body
to science? You become Roxy's latest
sex fantasy.
Leave it to German scientists to
come up with a concept like plastina
tion. currently on a display called
"Body World: An Anatomical Exhib
it of Real Human Bodies." They take

dead bodies, place them in a
vacuum to remove fat and
water, cover them with a liq
uid plastic and then pose
them in various positions he
fore they get hard. You'll
even find some lovely hunks
of meat contemplating a
chess game.
Once they're good and
rigid. I can brush up on my
anatomy. There's a lot that
Stanford boys can learn from,
these hard, plastic corpses.
For starters, plastinated
men know when not to talk.
They never talk. These guys
know the meaning of post
coital "quiet time." Instead
of indulging in cocksure
braggadocio or modestly in
secure self-deprecation,
these men just stand there
and let their bodies speak for

themselves.
Their bodies are all muscle. Sure,
their fat was sucked out with a high
intensity vacuum to ease the replace
ment of their tissues with plastic, but if
every guy had this dedication, there
would he no need for gyms. The sim
ple removal of fat and water results in
an automatic six-pack.
And this leads to the confidence
that so many men sadly lack. I didn't
hear any of these plastinated Ger
mans bitching about their bodies,
their genitalia, their lady problems or
the fact that some sick scientist ripped
off their skin and cut open their or
gans so that school kids could draw
them during field trips. Have any
Stanford men gone through that? No.

so quit whining.
Removing your fat doesn't just
make your formerly rippling muscles
stand out. it also increases your penis
size. Being an expert on phallic arts. I
immediately noticed that these men
were much more well-endowed than
the Californians I usually interact
with on campus. At first, I figured it
was just a German thing. I mean, of all
the European races, wouldn't you ex
pect the Germans to he equipped well
enough to rape the world?
But then I realized that the dan
gling inches of my plastinated lovers
was also a function of the lack of fat.
On average, two inches of the penis is
hidden beneath the surface of the skin
and thus will never service any willing
user. However, strip away the fat and
what remains is the full penis and
package in all its dried, plastinated
glory. So many men fret about cock
size— pumps, pills and faulty mea
suring techniques will never prove as
effective as letting Germans embalm
your unit with plastic.
Although "Body Worlds" aided in
further enamoring me with the penis,
it accomplished the exact opposite
with its nearby body cavity, the anus.
Maybe it was the sight of the shriveled
little tube hatch protruding out the
back of these people and turned me
off from anal sex. Perhaps the extend
ed intestines made me reconsider in
serting anything in that tunnel.
Most likely, it was the cross-section
of the constipated rectum that made
me decide that the anus is not some
thing I want to play with for the time
being. Entrance will solely be admit
ted through the front door from now
on.
