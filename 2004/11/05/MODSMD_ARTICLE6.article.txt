It's anybody's guess as to which of the following will he hotter tomorrow, the on-field temperature at Sun Devil Sta
dium or Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens' seat on the plane ride home. After a deflating 21-0 loss in Los Ange
les last week, Stanford (4-4.2-3) travels to the desert to take on No. 23 Arizona State (6-2,3-2) needing to win two
of its last three games to become bowl-eligible. As tall an order as a win tomorrow might be, winning in Berkeley
two weeks from now is even more daunting. Here are three key matchups to watch:

1

Stanford QB Trent Edwards vs. ASU QB Andrew Walter

The gtxxl news: Andrew Walter will likely be holding a clip
board on an NFL sideline this time next year. The bad news:
Tomorrow is not next year. Stanford will be especially glad to
see Walter go, as the fifth-year senior has torched the Cardinal
for 771 yards and nine touchdowns against just two intercep
tions the past two seasons. He is two touchdown passes shy of
breaking John El way's Pac-10 career mark of 77. Edwards has
thrown eight touchdowns and eight interceptions (including
three last week) this season. He'll need to rise to the occasion
tomorrow or the sun could soon set on the Cardinal's hopes for
a winning season.

R

Stanford Pass Rush vs. ASU Pass Rush

Should tomorrow's game turn into an Edwards-
Walter duel, putting pressure on the OB will be
come especially important for both teams' de
fensive lines. Stanford has 17 sacks this season
and Cardinal quarterbacks have been sacked 26
times. The Arizona State defense has 25 sacks to
its credit while Walter has been sacked 22 times.
Eleven of those sacks came in the Sun Devils'
two losses. If Stanford fails to land a few solid
blows on Walter, it could be a long day.

B

Stanford Secondary vs. ASU WR Derek Hagan

Hagan, a 6-foot-2 junior, has emerged as Walter's fa
vorite target after hauling in 66 passes — including
four for 138 yards and three scores against Stanford
— last season. Stanford's defense has been consis
tently solid throughout the season, allowing 16.8
points per game. The secondary has been especially
stingy, as the Cardinal have allowed just four touch
down passes. The unit will be busy tomorrow against
a pass-heavy Sun Devils attack.

It's anybody's guess as to which of the following will he hotter tomorrow, the on-field temperature at Sun Devil Sta
dium or Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens' seat on the plane ride home. After a deflating 21-0 loss in Los Ange
les last week, Stanford (4-4.2-3) travels to the desert to take on No. 23 Arizona State (6-2,3-2) needing to win two
of its last three games to become bowl-eligible. As tall an order as a win tomorrow might be, winning in Berkeley
two weeks from now is even more daunting. Here are three key matchups to watch:

1

Stanford QB Trent Edwards vs. ASU QB Andrew Walter

The gtxxl news: Andrew Walter will likely be holding a clip
board on an NFL sideline this time next year. The bad news:
Tomorrow is not next year. Stanford will be especially glad to
see Walter go, as the fifth-year senior has torched the Cardinal
for 771 yards and nine touchdowns against just two intercep
tions the past two seasons. He is two touchdown passes shy of
breaking John El way's Pac-10 career mark of 77. Edwards has
thrown eight touchdowns and eight interceptions (including
three last week) this season. He'll need to rise to the occasion
tomorrow or the sun could soon set on the Cardinal's hopes for
a winning season.

R

Stanford Pass Rush vs. ASU Pass Rush

Should tomorrow's game turn into an Edwards-
Walter duel, putting pressure on the OB will be
come especially important for both teams' de
fensive lines. Stanford has 17 sacks this season
and Cardinal quarterbacks have been sacked 26
times. The Arizona State defense has 25 sacks to
its credit while Walter has been sacked 22 times.
Eleven of those sacks came in the Sun Devils'
two losses. If Stanford fails to land a few solid
blows on Walter, it could be a long day.

B

Stanford Secondary vs. ASU WR Derek Hagan

Hagan, a 6-foot-2 junior, has emerged as Walter's fa
vorite target after hauling in 66 passes — including
four for 138 yards and three scores against Stanford
— last season. Stanford's defense has been consis
tently solid throughout the season, allowing 16.8
points per game. The secondary has been especially
stingy, as the Cardinal have allowed just four touch
down passes. The unit will be busy tomorrow against
a pass-heavy Sun Devils attack.
