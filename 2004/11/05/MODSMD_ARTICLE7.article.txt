# Card's Smith not your typical TE
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tight end is not a glamorous position. It's a demand
ing job that requires one to be both a blocker and a pass
catcher, to be both large and agile. It's also a position
that, in general, rarely sees the ball come its way. If you
watch a football game and you see a big guy wide open
in the middle of the field while the quarterback flings the
ball to a receiver streaking down the sideline, that guy is
probably a tight end.
So when you look at the stat sheet and see that Stan
ford senior tight end Alex Smith not only leads the Car
dinal in receptions (44) and receiving yards (532), but
ranks third in the entire Pacific-1() Conference in catches
and sixth in yardage, it might make you ask: Just how
good is this guy?
Well, according to the Stanford record books, he's
about to become the best ever. Bob Moore holds the
school record for career catches by a tight end (1(H)), and
Smith is right behind with 99 after catching 19 passes for
24b yards the last two weeks. Smith also has a chance at
Greg Baty's single-season record of 61 catches.
Most tight ends rarely see a pass come their way, toil
ing in relative obscurity save for the occasional goal-line
toss. Not Smith, though — he wants the quarterback to
throw him the ball, because he's going to catch it.
"When you see the ball in the air, you have to say,
'that's my ball and nobody's gonna keep me from it,"'
Smith explained. "I feel like I can always make a play."
So do his teammates. Quarterbacks Trent Edwards
and T.C. Ostrander have both repeatedly thrown
Smith's way, even when he's been closely defended or
double-covered.
Over the past two weeks. Stanford's receivers have
struggled to get open, meaning even more balls thrown
Smith's way. That's good, because Smith usually makes
the catches, but also bad. because it means the offense
has failed to stretch the field.
"Sometimes our receivers are double-covered or
having trouble getting open. So if I'm the open one, then
I just try to make a play whenever possible," Smith said.
"But at the same time, we want our receivers to be the
leading guys in every game, and any time a tight end is
the leading receiver, it's probably not boding too well for
the offense."
Of course, even as Stanford was getting off to a 3-1
start. Smith was still a focal point in the offense. After all,
he's 6-foot-5, 255 pounds, has good hands and unusual
speed for his si/e. And, being a tight end, he usually faces
coverage from linebackers or safeties, and he has ways
to get open against each one.
"I just try to use my athleticism," Smith said. "I'm a
tall guy, and whether I have to use my speed on a
linebacker or a size on a defensive back, I just try to use
whatever advantage I have to make a play."
Smith was an NFL prospect last year, but chose to re
turn to the Farm for his senior season, where his stock
has only climbed with increased exposure and opportu
nities. With a professional career all but a guarantee at
this point. Smith knows he'll be wearing a pro uniform
next year — the dream of almost every football player.
Still, his attitude seems far from complacent.
"I tried to set some goals my freshman year of where
I wanted to be at the end of my college career, and that
was definitely one of them," Smith said. "I'd be lying if I
said I never thought about it, but at the same time, I re
alize mv performance now affects what happens in the
NFL."
Smith has been a vocal leader for the Cardinal this
season, as the senior class tries to continue to build the
program under third-year head coach Buddy Tcevens.
"I think the main thing is we just try to make guys be
lieve," he said. "Believe that they're a great team and
that they're great players and can make big plays. That's

something you kind of struggle with the young team,
they have that uncertainty sometimes. But the senior
leaders have just tried to stress that as much as possible
through our play that we're gonna give 100 percent and
give it all we got, because we don't feel like we can be
stopped,"
And, as Smith has shown this season, he knows a
thing or two about not being stopped. Still, when he
looks back on his Cardinal career, which included a trip
to the Seattle Bowl his freshman season, a two-win
sophomore campaign and the progress of the last two
years, he has mixed emotions. Alter all, like any Pac-10
senior, he wanted to go out with a trip to the Rose Bowl.
Nonetheless, when he looks back at his career. Smith

knows he can take pride in the Cardinal's improvement.
"It's kind of frustrating, but at the same time, you just
try to do the best you can," he said. "We haven't been to
a bowl game in three years, so just to know that we're
turning the team in the right direction is a step forward
and something to be proud of. We're just trying to go out
on the best note we can."
Although he'll leave Stanford with his name gracing
the record book. Smith just wants to be known as some
one who played hard.
"I just want guys to know that I'm a competitor, if I had
to be known for one word. That I give my all every game,
every time I step on the field," Smith said. "And if they
can say that about me, that's the legacy I want to have."

coverage from linebackers or safeties, and he has ways
to get open against each one.
"I just try to use my athleticism," Smith said. "I'm a
tall guy, and whether I have to use my speed on a
linebacker or a size on a defensive back, I just try to use
whatever advantage I have to make a play."
Smith was an NFL prospect last year, but chose to re
turn to the Farm for his senior season, where his stock
has only climbed with increased exposure and opportu
nities. With a professional career all but a guarantee at
this point. Smith knows he'll be wearing a pro uniform
next year — the dream of almost every football player.
Still, his attitude seems far from complacent.
"I tried to set some goals my freshman year of where
I wanted to be at the end of my college career, and that
was definitely one of them," Smith said. "I'd be lying if I
said I never thought about it, but at the same time, I re
alize mv performance now affects what happens in the
NFL."
Smith has been a vocal leader for the Cardinal this
season, as the senior class tries to continue to build the
program under third-year head coach Buddy Tcevens.
"I think the main thing is we just try to make guys be
lieve," he said. "Believe that they're a great team and
that they're great players and can make big plays. That's

something you kind of struggle with the young team,
they have that uncertainty sometimes. But the senior
leaders have just tried to stress that as much as possible
through our play that we're gonna give 100 percent and
give it all we got, because we don't feel like we can be
stopped,"
And, as Smith has shown this season, he knows a
thing or two about not being stopped. Still, when he
looks back on his Cardinal career, which included a trip
to the Seattle Bowl his freshman season, a two-win
sophomore campaign and the progress of the last two
years, he has mixed emotions. Alter all, like any Pac-10
senior, he wanted to go out with a trip to the Rose Bowl.
Nonetheless, when he looks back at his career. Smith

knows he can take pride in the Cardinal's improvement.
"It's kind of frustrating, but at the same time, you just
try to do the best you can," he said. "We haven't been to
a bowl game in three years, so just to know that we're
turning the team in the right direction is a step forward
and something to be proud of. We're just trying to go out
on the best note we can."
Although he'll leave Stanford with his name gracing
the record book. Smith just wants to be known as some
one who played hard.
"I just want guys to know that I'm a competitor, if I had
to be known for one word. That I give my all every game,
every time I step on the field," Smith said. "And if they
can say that about me, that's the legacy I want to have."

Senior tight end Alex Smith needs two catches to pass Bob Moore as Stanford's all-time leader in receptions
by a tight end. Smith leads the team with 44 catches for 532 yards this season.
Tight end is not a glamorous position. It's a demand
ing job that requires one to be both a blocker and a pass
catcher, to be both large and agile. It's also a position
that, in general, rarely sees the ball come its way. If you
watch a football game and you see a big guy wide open
in the middle of the field while the quarterback flings the
ball to a receiver streaking down the sideline, that guy is
probably a tight end.
So when you look at the stat sheet and see that Stan
ford senior tight end Alex Smith not only leads the Car
dinal in receptions (44) and receiving yards (532), but
ranks third in the entire Pacific-1() Conference in catches
and sixth in yardage, it might make you ask: Just how
good is this guy?
Well, according to the Stanford record books, he's
about to become the best ever. Bob Moore holds the
school record for career catches by a tight end (1(H)), and
Smith is right behind with 99 after catching 19 passes for
24b yards the last two weeks. Smith also has a chance at
Greg Baty's single-season record of 61 catches.
Most tight ends rarely see a pass come their way, toil
ing in relative obscurity save for the occasional goal-line
toss. Not Smith, though — he wants the quarterback to
throw him the ball, because he's going to catch it.
"When you see the ball in the air, you have to say,
'that's my ball and nobody's gonna keep me from it,"'
Smith explained. "I feel like I can always make a play."
So do his teammates. Quarterbacks Trent Edwards
and T.C. Ostrander have both repeatedly thrown
Smith's way, even when he's been closely defended or
double-covered.
Over the past two weeks. Stanford's receivers have
struggled to get open, meaning even more balls thrown
Smith's way. That's good, because Smith usually makes
the catches, but also bad. because it means the offense
has failed to stretch the field.
"Sometimes our receivers are double-covered or
having trouble getting open. So if I'm the open one, then
I just try to make a play whenever possible," Smith said.
"But at the same time, we want our receivers to be the
leading guys in every game, and any time a tight end is
the leading receiver, it's probably not boding too well for
the offense."
Of course, even as Stanford was getting off to a 3-1
start. Smith was still a focal point in the offense. After all,
he's 6-foot-5, 255 pounds, has good hands and unusual
speed for his si/e. And, being a tight end, he usually faces
coverage from linebackers or safeties, and he has ways
to get open against each one.
