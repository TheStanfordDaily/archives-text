## U.N. expert cites nuclear danger 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA 
Mohamed Elßaradei, director general of
the United Nation's International Atomic En
ergy Agency, delivered the annual Drell Lec
ture yesterday about the present and future of
non-proliferation and arms control.
"According to the newly re-elected Presi
dent Bush, nuclear proliferation represents
the greatest threat to international security,"
Elßaradei said. "Most world leaders agree on
this point, hut a fundamental difference of
opinion remains on how to deal with the prob
lem."
Elßaradei said that the world has an obli
gation to agree on "benchmarks" for non-pro
liferation and disarmament.
"We must make reliance on nuclear
weapons obsolete," he said. "We have to look
at nuclear weapons the same way we look at
genocide or slavery - as taboo."
He emphasized the importance of bringing
worldwide attention back to nuclear non-pro
liferation and forming a plan to achievenucle
ar disarmament.
"Progress must be made on all fronts - po
litical, scientific, and societal," he said. "Col
lective security is the starting point. The politi
cians have an obligation to form a mechanism
for preventive diplomacy, while scientists

have a responsibility to form an intensive ef
fort to develop tools for nuclear non-prolifer
ation."
Elßaradei stressed the importance of non
violent, diplomatic methods throughout his
speech. However, he said that collective pre
eminent military actions are necessary in the
case of great danger and terrorism. In all
cases, according to Elßaradei. action must be
taken when dealing with nuclear weapons and
international security.
Elßaradei cited North Korea as an exam
ple of the danger of a lack of decisive inter
ventions by the security council.
"North Korea was allowed to withdraw
from the international Nuclear Non-Prolifera
tion Treaty and amass a large supply of nucle
ar weapons," he said. We have to break down
on such action, and make the treaty apply
equally to all. If you continue to develop nu
clear weapons, then the international commu
nity will take measures to make sure you are
not posing a danger to others."
A question-and-answer session with the
audience followed the speech. One student
asked if Elßaradei had any advice for Bush
concerning Iran and North Korea.
"We want neither Iran nor North Korea to

have nuclear weapons, nor any
other country, for that matter," he
answered. "There is no magic solu
tion to any crisis, but we need to use
incentives, provide aid, and assure
security and integration into the in
ternational community."
He also commented on the
lAEA's current relationship with
the United States government con
cerning U.S. insistence on keeping
nuclear weapons.
"We have good cooperation with
the Bush administration," he said.
"We both agree that we have to curb
nuclear proliferation and terrorism,
but we differ in our views when it
comes to nuclear disarmament."
Another student asked about the
charges that Elßaradei and the
lAEA had attempted to influence
the recent presidential election.
"It is unfortunate that our perfor
mance of our duty had been used as
part of the political hype during the
election," he said. "Some of the
media need to mature and realize

that the world does not come to a
halt when you have an American
election."
While the audience generally re
sponded positively to Elßaradei's
remarks, some believed he took too
weak a stand.
"He stuck to the idealistic goals
of the lAEA without actually going
into details on how to implement
them," said senior Frances Lewis.
The event, hosted by the Center
tor International Security and Co
operation. was held on campus at
Kresge Auditorium and broadcast
through a live Webcam to seven of
the nine University of California
campuses.
"The tradition of the annual
Drell Lecture was established in
IW4 to address important issues
concerning international security
that have scientific and technical di
mensions," said Christopher Chyba,
co-director of CISAC and associate
professor of geological and environ
mental science.
