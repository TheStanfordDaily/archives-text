## U.N. expert cites nuclear danger 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA 
Mohamed Elßaradei, director general of
the United Nation's International Atomic En
ergy Agency, delivered the annual Drell Lec
ture yesterday about the present and future of
non-proliferation and arms control.
"According to the newly re-elected Presi
dent Bush, nuclear proliferation represents
the greatest threat to international security,"
Elßaradei said. "Most world leaders agree on
this point, hut a fundamental difference of
opinion remains on how to deal with the prob

Elßaradei said that the world has an obli
gation to agree on "benchmarks" for non-pro
liferation and disarmament.
"We must make reliance on nuclear
weapons obsolete," he said. "We have to look
at nuclear weapons the same way we look at
genocide or slavery - as taboo."
He emphasized the importance of bringing
worldwide attention back to nuclear non-pro
liferation and forming a plan to achievenucle
ar disarmament.
"Progress must be made on all fronts - po
litical, scientific, and societal," he said. "Col
lective security is the starting point. The politi
cians have an obligation to form a mechanism
for preventive diplomacy, while scientists

have a responsibility to form an intensive ef
fort to develop tools for nuclear non-prolifer
ation."
Elßaradei stressed the importance of non
violent, diplomatic methods throughout his
speech. However, he said that collective pre
eminent military actions are necessary in the
case of great danger and terrorism. In all
cases, according to Elßaradei. action must be
taken when dealing with nuclear weapons and
international security.
Elßaradei cited North Korea as an exam
ple of the danger of a lack of decisive inter
ventions by the security council.
"North Korea was allowed to withdraw
from the international Nuclear Non-Prolifera
tion Treaty and amass a large supply of nucle
ar weapons," he said. We have to break down
on such action, and make the treaty apply
equally to all. If you continue to develop nu
clear weapons, then the international commu
nity will take measures to make sure you are
not posing a danger to others."
A question-and-answer session with the
audience followed the speech. One student
asked if Elßaradei had any advice for Bush
concerning Iran and North Korea.
"We want neither Iran nor North Korea to
