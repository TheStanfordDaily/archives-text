# Profs emphasize political activism in post-election U.S.
## 
### JENNIFER LIU 
Last night journalist Amy Good
man and Stanford scholars Larry Di
amond, David Dill and John Mc-
Manus stressed the importance of
grassroots activism in "Onward! A
Post-Election Town Hall Meeting."
Diamond. Dill and McManus ad
dressed the need for accountability
in Iraq, electronic voting and the ef
fects of market-driven media, re
spectively.
The dialogue focused more on
active involvement than on the elec
tion itself.
"Things don't look great right
now," said Mark Gonnerman, one
of the event's organizers. "But hope
means active participation in im
proving the political and social
world."
An attentive audience gave
Goodman, the host of the daily radio
newsmagazine "Democracy Now!",
a standing ovation as she was intro
duced by the moderator of the dis
cussion. Goodman congratulated
the audience for attending instead of
"sitting home alone, giving up."
The event consisted of a 45-
minute discussion between the three
scholars and a 45-minute question
and answer period.
Diamond, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, was a senior ad
visor to the Coalition Provisional
Authority in Baghdad from January
to April of this year. He said that

most people do not understand how
imminent and dangerous the choices
the government faces are.
The author of the article "What
Went Wrong in Iraq," published this
fall in Foreign Affairs, Diamond
said that the lack of foresight of se
nior Pentagon leaders was a "moral
outrage," and he stressed the need
fora more thorough investigation of
senior officials' involvement in the
Abu Ghraib prison scandal.
"There needs to be accountabili
ty," he said.
Dill, a computer science profes
sor. talked about the lack of reliabil
ity and accountability in electronic
voting systems, which were used at
Stanford polling places on Tuesday.
"Electronic voting technology is
inherently not transparent," he said.
Dill said that an ideal voting sys
tem would be precinct-based optical
scanning systems, which would not
only have fewer errors but would
generate a paper trail.
Although the electronic voting
systems used in several areas this
year probably made some mistakes,
he believes that these errors likely
were not important enough to
change the outcome of the election.
McManus. director of Grade the
News, a media research group that
rates the quality of the news media
in the Bay Area, said that he thinks
the the American media exploit the
public's susceptibility to images, es
pecially through political advertis
ing. Grade the News is affiliated with
and based at Stanford's Graduate
Program in Journalism.
According to McManus, many
corporate television stations using
public airwaves are willing to do
whatever it takes to improve ratings,
rather than act in the best interests of
public education.
"We can't afford this kind of air
pollution that's suffocating our
democracy," he said, and suggested
that a solution would be giving can
didates publicly funded airtime.
McManus also said he feels that
citizen activism creates pressure on
the market-driven media.
"It's sad when we have to rely on
activists to do things that federal
agencies are supposed to do." he said.
During the question-and-answer
period, many of the audience mem
bers asked questions ranging in top
ics from human rights issues to local
election results, rather than directly

addressing the topics presented in
the forum.
Freshman Kellen Schefter said
that he didn't feel that the forum
covered what he thought vnould be a
discussion of the election results.
"I expected, actually, a somber
tone of how bad the next four years
would be," he said. "But I left reas
sured that the overall election was
only a small part of the global issues.
1 do feel inspired."
Goodman emphasized what she
believes to be the promise of the
next four years and said that a mass
gathering such as "Onward!" is criti
cal for promoting change.
"You're the leader, and you have
proven what mass movements can
do," she said. "Change takes time,
but also absolute persistence and de
termination."
The event was sponsored by the
Aurora Forum, a group that pro
motes citi/.en participation in the po
litical process.

tem would be precinct-based optical
scanning systems, which would not
only have fewer errors but would
generate a paper trail.
Although the electronic voting
systems used in several areas this
year probably made some mistakes,
he believes that these errors likely
were not important enough to
change the outcome of the election.
McManus. director of Grade the
News, a media research group that
rates the quality of the news media
in the Bay Area, said that he thinks
the the American media exploit the
public's susceptibility to images, es
pecially through political advertis
ing. Grade the News is affiliated with
and based at Stanford's Graduate
Program in Journalism.
According to McManus, many
corporate television stations using
public airwaves are willing to do
whatever it takes to improve ratings,
rather than act in the best interests of
public education.
"We can't afford this kind of air
pollution that's suffocating our
democracy," he said, and suggested
that a solution would be giving can
didates publicly funded airtime.
McManus also said he feels that
citizen activism creates pressure on
the market-driven media.
"It's sad when we have to rely on
activists to do things that federal
agencies are supposed to do." he said.
During the question-and-answer
period, many of the audience mem
bers asked questions ranging in top

election results, rather than directly

addressing the topics presented in
the forum.
Freshman Kellen Schefter said
that he didn't feel that the forum
covered what he thought vnould be a
discussion of the election results.
"I expected, actually, a somber
tone of how bad the next four years
would be," he said. "But I left reas
sured that the overall election was
only a small part of the global issues.

Goodman emphasized what she
believes to be the promise of the
next four years and said that a mass
gathering such as "Onward!" is criti
cal for promoting change.
"You're the leader, and you have
proven what mass movements can
do," she said. "Change takes time,
but also absolute persistence and de
termination."
The event was sponsored by the
Aurora Forum, a group that pro
motes citi/.en participation in the po
