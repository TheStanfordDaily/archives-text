TEMPE, Ariz. — The Cardinal never stopped
fighting here Saturday, overcoming five
turnovers and a 583-283 deficit in yardage to
score 17 points in the fourth quarter and take a
31-26 lead over No. 23 Arizona State with just
two minutes and two seconds left to play.
Then they forced the Sun Devils into their
longest drive of the game, totaling 13 plays. So
when Andrew Walter found little-used wide
receiver Matt Miller in the back of the end
zone with just nine left on the clock to give Ari
zona State a 34-31 victory — and Stanford (4-
5.2-3 Pacific-10 Conference) its third consecu
tive loss — it hurt all the more.
This wasn't like the loss to UCLA, where
the offense never found the end zone, nor was
it like the loss to Oregon, where both teams
scuffled to produce. No, this was an old-fash
ioned shootout, as two teams that entered with
just 23 combined turnovers combined to cough
the ball up nine times in total, while putting

eight touchdowns, two field goals, two two
point conversions and a safety on the board.
Both teams had plenty of chances, and with
two minutes left, Stanford thought it had final
ly seized control after its final score. This was
despite the Cardinal's failure to pick up a two
point conversion that would've given them a
seven point lead that, at the worst, would force
overtime.
"There was still quite a bit of time left, but
they've got a pretty potent offense," said back
up quarterback T.C. Ostrander, who replaced
an injured Trent Edwards in the third quarter
and threw for 161 yards. "[But| our defense
had done a great job all night, so were pretty
confident that we had it."
Head coach Buddy Teevens, as shaken by
the game's cruel ending as his players, could
only praise the efforts of his and Arizona
State's players.
"I thought our guys competed hard to
the end of the ballgame," he said. "Give
credit to Andrew Walter for textbook exe
cution."

Walter completed 28-of-42 passes for 414
yards and four touchdowns, breaking Stanford
alum John Elway's Pac-10 record of 77 career
touchdown passes. He did so with a 52-yard
Hail Mary pass that landed in the portentous
arms of Matt Miller to end the first half.
"1 have never had two bigger catches in my
life," Miller said.
Arizona State (7-2,4-2) also got 186 rushing
yards on 34 carries by converted wide receiver
Rudy Burgess, a master of the cut-back.
"Think about what Rudy (Burgess) did
tonight," Arizona State head coach Dirk Koet
ter said. "He weighs 172 pounds soaking wet.
He carried the rock and took some hits ... that
guy is all heart and Til take him on my team
any day."

T.J. Rushing and the Stanford defense came up with some big plays Saturday, forcing four Sun Devil turnovers, but the combination of 415 yards
and four touchdown passes from Arizona State QB Andrew Walter and five Cardinal giveaways added up to a crushing, last-second defeat.
Mac Donald punts, setting up 6- and 18-yard Stanford
touchdown drives.
Trent Edwards found tight end Alex Smith fora
four-yard touchdown late in the first quarter to put the
Cardinal up 7-0 and give Smith a new school record for
career receptions by a tight end. With 5:21 left in the
second quarter, Kenneth Tolon ran fora 1-yard score
to make the score 14-3.
A 41-yard touchdown toss from Walter to Terry
Richardson and Miller's last-second grab would send
the Sun Devils to the locker room with a 17-14 half
time lead, something the Cardinal have not overcome
in any game this season. Arizona State would pile it on
in the third quarter, as Riccardo Stewart tackled Tolon
two yards deep in the end zone fora safety five min
utes into the period and Zach Miller caught a 7-yard
touchdown pass from Walter with 34 seconds left in
the third.
Finding itself down 26-14 as the final period began,
the Stanford offense decided it was time to finally get
something done in the second half.
"As a unit, we stay very calm and we're not trying to
do anything extra." Ostrander said. "When I got set
tled down. I felt really good and the other guys did a
great job."
After Burgess fumbled a punt return, Ostrander
drove the Cardinal 40 yards in seven plays, culminating
in a 3-yard touchdown run by Ray Jones. Greg Camar
illo made an incredible diving catch for the two-point
conversion.
The defense forced a three-and-out by the Sun Dev
ils, but David Marrero fumbled the punt, giving Ari
zona State the ball just 26 yards from the Stanford end
zone. No matter — this time, the defense stopped the
Sun Devils on four plays, forcing a turnover on downs.
"I've never been in a game quite like this," Koetter
said. "Our defense was playing great and our offense
was marching the ball on the ground but we couldn't
score."
Stanford drove 60 yards fora 47-yard Michael Sgroi
field goal, cutting Arizona State's lead to a precarious
26-25. The defense came up with another three-and
out, and then Ostrander and Smith went for the home
run.
On the only play of the Cardinal's final scoring
drive, Ostrander threw a ball deep down the center of
the field, and the senior tight end slipped a tackle and
raced 67 yards for the go-ahead score.
"We'd been looking at that play all night, because
their safeties had been playing outside more all night."

Walter, Devils
pull out victory

Ostrander explained.
What happened next, though, was something Stan
ford has been looking at all season — the tough, heart
wrenching loss. It was Stanford's third defeat by a
touchdown or less.
"You know that you're better than a team, and you
don't play the way you need to," defensive tackle Ba
batunde Oshinowo said.
While the other Cardinal knew they'd let one slip
away, they were quick to praise the effort of Oshinowo
and the Cardinal defense.
"Bend but don't break." Teevens said. "[Arizona
State] is a tough offense. They put up points on every
body."
What they don't normally do is commit four
turnovers. They entered the game with just 12
turnovers in eight games, but the Stanford defense,
while it did give up big chunks of yardage, made key
stops and forced opportune turnovers all game.
Jon Alston had four sacks. T.J. Rushing added two
more and Walter tumbled twice and threw an intercep
tion.
The Cardinal had their share of turnovers, too —
starter Trent Edwards threw three interceptions as
part of an S-of-20 passing performance for 85 yards be
fore Arizona State lineman Jimmy Verdon reaggravat
ed Edwards' left shoulder injury on the first play of the
second half —but the defense made sure they didn't
count. Five Stanford turnovers led to just 10 Arizona
State points.
"We talked about courage early this morning, and
competing and overcoming adversity and all the little
catchphrases, and today you saw all of that," Teevens
said. "You wish they had more to walk away with."
Now. the Cardinal must win their final two games —
a contest at home against Oregon State (4-5,3-3) and a
road date with a frightening No. 4 California squad (7-
1, 5-1) —to finish with a winning record and give
themselves bowl eligibility for the first time since 2001.
But. as Saturday's effort showed, this is a team that isn't
anywhere close to giving up.
"Emotionally. I was hurting pretty bad five minutes
ago." Alston said. "But I'm not gonna take this loss and
internalize it and think negatively about it.and I don't
want my teammates doing that to me. As a team, we
fought. So. that's what I'm gonna take. That's what I'm
gonna take to work with me tomorrow, and that's what
I'm gonna take into next week."

ford has been looking at all season — the tough, heart
wrenching loss. It was Stanford's third defeat by a
touchdown or less.
"You know that you're better than a team, and you
don't play the way you need to," defensive tackle Ba
batunde Oshinowo said.
While the other Cardinal knew they'd let one slip
away, they were quick to praise the effort of Oshinowo
and the Cardinal defense.
"Bend but don't break." Teevens said. "[Arizona
State] is a tough offense. They put up points on every
body."
What they don't normally do is commit four
turnovers. They entered the game with just 12
turnovers in eight games, but the Stanford defense,
while it did give up big chunks of yardage, made key
stops and forced opportune turnovers all game.
Jon Alston had four sacks. T.J. Rushing added two
more and Walter tumbled twice and threw an intercep
tion.
The Cardinal had their share of turnovers, too —
starter Trent Edwards threw three interceptions as
part of an S-of-20 passing performance for 85 yards be
fore Arizona State lineman Jimmy Verdon reaggravat
ed Edwards' left shoulder injury on the first play of the
second half —but the defense made sure they didn't
count. Five Stanford turnovers led to just 10 Arizona
State points.
"We talked about courage early this morning, and
competing and overcoming adversity and all the little
catchphrases, and today you saw all of that," Teevens
said. "You wish they had more to walk away with."
Now. the Cardinal must win their final two games —
a contest at home against Oregon State (4-5,3-3) and a
road date with a frightening No. 4 California squad (7-
1, 5-1) —to finish with a winning record and give
themselves bowl eligibility for the first time since 2001.
But. as Saturday's effort showed, this is a team that isn't
anywhere close to giving up.
"Emotionally. I was hurting pretty bad five minutes
ago." Alston said. "But I'm not gonna take this loss and
internalize it and think negatively about it.and I don't
want my teammates doing that to me. As a team, we
fought. So. that's what I'm gonna take. That's what I'm
gonna take to work with me tomorrow, and that's what
I'm gonna take into next week."
TEMPE, Ariz. — The Cardinal never stopped
fighting here Saturday, overcoming five
turnovers and a 583-283 deficit in yardage to
score 17 points in the fourth quarter and take a
31-26 lead over No. 23 Arizona State with just
two minutes and two seconds left to play.
Then they forced the Sun Devils into their
longest drive of the game, totaling 13 plays. So
when Andrew Walter found little-used wide
receiver Matt Miller in the back of the end
zone with just nine left on the clock to give Ari
zona State a 34-31 victory — and Stanford (4-
5.2-3 Pacific-10 Conference) its third consecu
tive loss — it hurt all the more.
This wasn't like the loss to UCLA, where
the offense never found the end zone, nor was
it like the loss to Oregon, where both teams
scuffled to produce. No, this was an old-fash
ioned shootout, as two teams that entered with
just 23 combined turnovers combined to cough
the ball up nine times in total, while putting

eight touchdowns, two field goals, two two
point conversions and a safety on the board.
Both teams had plenty of chances, and with
two minutes left, Stanford thought it had final
ly seized control after its final score. This was
despite the Cardinal's failure to pick up a two
point conversion that would've given them a
seven point lead that, at the worst, would force
overtime.
"There was still quite a bit of time left, but
they've got a pretty potent offense," said back
up quarterback T.C. Ostrander, who replaced
an injured Trent Edwards in the third quarter
and threw for 161 yards. "[But| our defense
had done a great job all night, so were pretty
confident that we had it."
Head coach Buddy Teevens, as shaken by
the game's cruel ending as his players, could
only praise the efforts of his and Arizona
State's players.
"I thought our guys competed hard to
the end of the ballgame," he said. "Give
credit to Andrew Walter for textbook exe
cution."

Walter completed 28-of-42 passes for 414
yards and four touchdowns, breaking Stanford
alum John Elway's Pac-10 record of 77 career
touchdown passes. He did so with a 52-yard
Hail Mary pass that landed in the portentous
arms of Matt Miller to end the first half.
"1 have never had two bigger catches in my
life," Miller said.
Arizona State (7-2,4-2) also got 186 rushing
yards on 34 carries by converted wide receiver
Rudy Burgess, a master of the cut-back.
"Think about what Rudy (Burgess) did
tonight," Arizona State head coach Dirk Koet
ter said. "He weighs 172 pounds soaking wet.
He carried the rock and took some hits ... that
guy is all heart and Til take him on my team
any day."

T.J. Rushing and the Stanford defense came up with some big plays Saturday, forcing four Sun Devil turnovers, but the combination of 415 yards
and four touchdown passes from Arizona State QB Andrew Walter and five Cardinal giveaways added up to a crushing, last-second defeat.
Mac Donald punts, setting up 6- and 18-yard Stanford
touchdown drives.
Trent Edwards found tight end Alex Smith fora
four-yard touchdown late in the first quarter to put the
Cardinal up 7-0 and give Smith a new school record for
career receptions by a tight end. With 5:21 left in the
second quarter, Kenneth Tolon ran fora 1-yard score
to make the score 14-3.
A 41-yard touchdown toss from Walter to Terry
Richardson and Miller's last-second grab would send
the Sun Devils to the locker room with a 17-14 half
time lead, something the Cardinal have not overcome
in any game this season. Arizona State would pile it on
in the third quarter, as Riccardo Stewart tackled Tolon
two yards deep in the end zone fora safety five min
utes into the period and Zach Miller caught a 7-yard
touchdown pass from Walter with 34 seconds left in
the third.
Finding itself down 26-14 as the final period began,
the Stanford offense decided it was time to finally get
something done in the second half.
"As a unit, we stay very calm and we're not trying to
do anything extra." Ostrander said. "When I got set
tled down. I felt really good and the other guys did a
great job."
After Burgess fumbled a punt return, Ostrander
drove the Cardinal 40 yards in seven plays, culminating
in a 3-yard touchdown run by Ray Jones. Greg Camar
illo made an incredible diving catch for the two-point
conversion.
The defense forced a three-and-out by the Sun Dev
ils, but David Marrero fumbled the punt, giving Ari
zona State the ball just 26 yards from the Stanford end
zone. No matter — this time, the defense stopped the
Sun Devils on four plays, forcing a turnover on downs.
"I've never been in a game quite like this," Koetter
said. "Our defense was playing great and our offense
was marching the ball on the ground but we couldn't
score."
Stanford drove 60 yards fora 47-yard Michael Sgroi
field goal, cutting Arizona State's lead to a precarious
26-25. The defense came up with another three-and
out, and then Ostrander and Smith went for the home
run.
On the only play of the Cardinal's final scoring
drive, Ostrander threw a ball deep down the center of
the field, and the senior tight end slipped a tackle and
raced 67 yards for the go-ahead score.
"We'd been looking at that play all night, because
their safeties had been playing outside more all night."

Walter, Devils

Ostrander explained.
What happened next, though, was something Stan

second quarter, Kenneth Tolon ran fora 1-yard score
to make the score 14-3.
A 41-yard touchdown toss from Walter to Terry
Richardson and Miller's last-second grab would send
the Sun Devils to the locker room with a 17-14 half
time lead, something the Cardinal have not overcome
in any game this season. Arizona State would pile it on
in the third quarter, as Riccardo Stewart tackled Tolon
two yards deep in the end zone fora safety five min
utes into the period and Zach Miller caught a 7-yard
touchdown pass from Walter with 34 seconds left in
the third.
Finding itself down 26-14 as the final period began,
the Stanford offense decided it was time to finally get
something done in the second half.
"As a unit, we stay very calm and we're not trying to
do anything extra." Ostrander said. "When I got set
tled down. I felt really good and the other guys did a
great job."
After Burgess fumbled a punt return, Ostrander
drove the Cardinal 40 yards in seven plays, culminating
in a 3-yard touchdown run by Ray Jones. Greg Camar
illo made an incredible diving catch for the two-point
conversion.
The defense forced a three-and-out by the Sun Dev
ils, but David Marrero fumbled the punt, giving Ari
zona State the ball just 26 yards from the Stanford end
zone. No matter — this time, the defense stopped the
Sun Devils on four plays, forcing a turnover on downs.
"I've never been in a game quite like this," Koetter
said. "Our defense was playing great and our offense
was marching the ball on the ground but we couldn't
score."
Stanford drove 60 yards fora 47-yard Michael Sgroi
field goal, cutting Arizona State's lead to a precarious
26-25. The defense came up with another three-and
out, and then Ostrander and Smith went for the home
run.
On the only play of the Cardinal's final scoring
drive, Ostrander threw a ball deep down the center of
the field, and the senior tight end slipped a tackle and
raced 67 yards for the go-ahead score.
"We'd been looking at that play all night, because
their safeties had been playing outside more all night."

Walter, Devils
pull out victory

Ostrander explained.
What happened next, though, was something Stan
ford has been looking at all season — the tough, heart
wrenching loss. It was Stanford's third defeat by a
touchdown or less.
"You know that you're better than a team, and you
don't play the way you need to," defensive tackle Ba
batunde Oshinowo said.
While the other Cardinal knew they'd let one slip
away, they were quick to praise the effort of Oshinowo
and the Cardinal defense.
"Bend but don't break." Teevens said. "[Arizona
State] is a tough offense. They put up points on every
body."
What they don't normally do is commit four
turnovers. They entered the game with just 12
turnovers in eight games, but the Stanford defense,
while it did give up big chunks of yardage, made key
stops and forced opportune turnovers all game.
Jon Alston had four sacks. T.J. Rushing added two
more and Walter tumbled twice and threw an intercep
tion.
The Cardinal had their share of turnovers, too —
starter Trent Edwards threw three interceptions as
part of an S-of-20 passing performance for 85 yards be
fore Arizona State lineman Jimmy Verdon reaggravat
ed Edwards' left shoulder injury on the first play of the
second half —but the defense made sure they didn't
count. Five Stanford turnovers led to just 10 Arizona
State points.
"We talked about courage early this morning, and
competing and overcoming adversity and all the little
catchphrases, and today you saw all of that," Teevens
said. "You wish they had more to walk away with."
Now. the Cardinal must win their final two games —
a contest at home against Oregon State (4-5,3-3) and a
road date with a frightening No. 4 California squad (7-
1, 5-1) —to finish with a winning record and give
themselves bowl eligibility for the first time since 2001.
But. as Saturday's effort showed, this is a team that isn't
anywhere close to giving up.
"Emotionally. I was hurting pretty bad five minutes
ago." Alston said. "But I'm not gonna take this loss and
internalize it and think negatively about it.and I don't
want my teammates doing that to me. As a team, we
fought. So. that's what I'm gonna take. That's what I'm
gonna take to work with me tomorrow, and that's what
I'm gonna take into next week."
