TEMPE, Ariz. — The Cardinal never stopped
fighting here Saturday, overcoming five
turnovers and a 583-283 deficit in yardage to
score 17 points in the fourth quarter and take a
31-26 lead over No. 23 Arizona State with just
two minutes and two seconds left to play.
Then they forced the Sun Devils into their
longest drive of the game, totaling 13 plays. So
when Andrew Walter found little-used wide
receiver Matt Miller in the back of the end
zone with just nine left on the clock to give Ari
zona State a 34-31 victory — and Stanford (4-
5.2-3 Pacific-10 Conference) its third consecu
tive loss — it hurt all the more.
This wasn't like the loss to UCLA, where
the offense never found the end zone, nor was
it like the loss to Oregon, where both teams
scuffled to produce. No, this was an old-fash
ioned shootout, as two teams that entered with
just 23 combined turnovers combined to cough
the ball up nine times in total, while putting

eight touchdowns, two field goals, two two
point conversions and a safety on the board.
Both teams had plenty of chances, and with
two minutes left, Stanford thought it had final
ly seized control after its final score. This was
despite the Cardinal's failure to pick up a two
point conversion that would've given them a
seven point lead that, at the worst, would force
overtime.
"There was still quite a bit of time left, but
they've got a pretty potent offense," said back
up quarterback T.C. Ostrander, who replaced
an injured Trent Edwards in the third quarter
and threw for 161 yards. "[But| our defense
had done a great job all night, so were pretty
confident that we had it."
Head coach Buddy Teevens, as shaken by
the game's cruel ending as his players, could
only praise the efforts of his and Arizona
State's players.
"I thought our guys competed hard to
the end of the ballgame," he said. "Give
credit to Andrew Walter for textbook exe
cution."

Walter completed 28-of-42 passes for 414
yards and four touchdowns, breaking Stanford
alum John Elway's Pac-10 record of 77 career
touchdown passes. He did so with a 52-yard
Hail Mary pass that landed in the portentous
arms of Matt Miller to end the first half.
"1 have never had two bigger catches in my
life," Miller said.
Arizona State (7-2,4-2) also got 186 rushing
yards on 34 carries by converted wide receiver
Rudy Burgess, a master of the cut-back.
"Think about what Rudy (Burgess) did
tonight," Arizona State head coach Dirk Koet
ter said. "He weighs 172 pounds soaking wet.
He carried the rock and took some hits ... that
guy is all heart and Til take him on my team
any day."
Still, despite all the offensive fireworks for
the Sun Devils, it was a slew of special-teams
mistakes by the Sun Devils that helped the
Cardinal stay in the game early. Local product

T.J. Rushing and the Stanford defense came up with some big plays Saturday, forcing four Sun Devil turnovers, but the combination of 415 yards
and four touchdown passes from Arizona State QB Andrew Walter and five Cardinal giveaways added up to a crushing, last-second defeat.
