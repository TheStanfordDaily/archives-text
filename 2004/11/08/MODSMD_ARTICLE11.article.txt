# Playing it straight
## Beer and cars 
### 
Most guys tend to spend
a fair amount of time
shooting the bull (bull
shooting, if you will)
about two things: cars and beer. We,
on the other hand, aren't particular
ly cool, and thus we spend more
time talking about awesome bike
purchases and / or finds / steals (i.e.
a 1970s Schwinn Varsity Classic or
the "Free Spirit" as we knew it).
And as far as beers go, we've tast
ed them when Dad was feeling gen
erous with his Corona at the
Mexican restaurant, but generally
we're not really man enough to truly
indulge. Regardless, here's our stab

at shoot
ing the
bull about
two sub
jects that
have fasci
nated men
for hecka
long,
dawg.
In both
classes
there are
wonderful
varieties
of styling,
price and
full-bodied

flavor. It's easy to get around with
beers, but you generally have to
stick it out with one car. If you're
lucky your best friend will let you
borrow his old brown Mercedes for
a quick "once-around-the-block"
now and then, but in the long run
you'll be driving whatever came
attached to the last lease you
signed.
Thus, the car you choose to drive
says quite a bit about the type of
person you are.
So let's start (and end) with the
Volkswagen Jetta. We've seen that,
for whatever reason, people don't
tend to think guvs who drive Jettas
are all that cool. After thoughtless
examination, however, we've con
cluded that the main shortcoming
of the Jetta is not its sleek design,
plentiful set of accessories or its
overwhelming trunk space.
No. the problem with the Jetta is
simply its lack of a Hemi. (It would
also be way cool if it had that flower
that comes with the Bug.) These
days, anybody who's nobody has a
Hemi. What is a Hemi? We don't
know, but it sounds titillating.
But the fact of the matter is that
the Jetta is a far superior vehicle to
just about any Hemi-laden piece of
garbage. Let's compare the Heavy
Duty Dodge RAM 350() (with Hemi
in tow) to the Volkwsagen Jetta GLI
1.8 (sans Hemi). The RAM is like
the Miller High Life of cars. The
Jetta is like Amstel Light, backed up
by a bunch of well-accessorized
Euro scientists with cool accents.
First, let's talk mileage. The
RAM gives you about 10 miles per
gallon. At that pace you'll really be
going places in life, which also tends
to happen when you drink a lot of
High Life. Pretty soon you. too, will
be able to mock "blue tracksuit jog
ging guy" as you perform the most
noble of household chores, such as
driving to the gas station after
downing a few bottles of High Life.
The sporty Jetta, on the other
hand, gives you a standard 20 to 30
miles to the gallon. That's
respectable. Granted, the Jetta may
not have the sheer efficiency of a
Michelob Ultra (40-50 mpg, city),
but then we don't finish up our coed
rock climbing sessions by chugging
cheap beer, even if it's masquerad
ing as gatorade. We do that while
pretending we are cool enough to
party with the Ultimate B-Team.
Cars aside, who seriously buys
High Life? Nobody.
And then there's Amstel Light,
the supposed beer drinker's light
beer. But have you ever noticed
that there doesn't seem to be a reg
ular Amstel available anywhere in
America? It seems a shame that
you can't even get the"beer
drinker's beer."
To make a shorter story shortest,
the Jetta's not a bad car. Go buy
one. Girls love them...to drive...
themselves.

attached to the last lease you
signed.
Thus, the car you choose to drive
says quite a bit about the type of
person you are.
So let's start (and end) with the
Volkswagen Jetta. We've seen that,
for whatever reason, people don't
tend to think guvs who drive Jettas
are all that cool. After thoughtless
examination, however, we've con
cluded that the main shortcoming
of the Jetta is not its sleek design,
plentiful set of accessories or its
overwhelming trunk space.
No. the problem with the Jetta is
simply its lack of a Hemi. (It would
also be way cool if it had that flower
that comes with the Bug.) These
days, anybody who's nobody has a
Hemi. What is a Hemi? We don't
know, but it sounds titillating.
But the fact of the matter is that
the Jetta is a far superior vehicle to
just about any Hemi-laden piece of
garbage. Let's compare the Heavy
Duty Dodge RAM 350() (with Hemi
in tow) to the Volkwsagen Jetta GLI
1.8 (sans Hemi). The RAM is like
the Miller High Life of cars. The
Jetta is like Amstel Light, backed up
by a bunch of well-accessorized
Euro scientists with cool accents.
First, let's talk mileage. The
RAM gives you about 10 miles per
gallon. At that pace you'll really be
going places in life, which also tends
to happen when you drink a lot of
High Life. Pretty soon you. too, will
be able to mock "blue tracksuit jog
ging guy" as you perform the most
noble of household chores, such as
driving to the gas station after
downing a few bottles of High Life.
The sporty Jetta, on the other
hand, gives you a standard 20 to 30
miles to the gallon. That's
respectable. Granted, the Jetta may
not have the sheer efficiency of a
Michelob Ultra (40-50 mpg, city),
but then we don't finish up our coed
rock climbing sessions by chugging
cheap beer, even if it's masquerad
ing as gatorade. We do that while
pretending we are cool enough to
party with the Ultimate B-Team.
Cars aside, who seriously buys
High Life? Nobody.
And then there's Amstel Light,
the supposed beer drinker's light
beer. But have you ever noticed
that there doesn't seem to be a reg
ular Amstel available anywhere in
America? It seems a shame that
you can't even get the"beer
drinker's beer."
To make a shorter story shortest,
the Jetta's not a bad car. Go buy
one. Girls love them...to drive...
themselves.
