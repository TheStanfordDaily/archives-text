# Living on the edge...
## Bike accidents abound on campus 
### CHRISTOPHER PEDREGAL 
As freshman Caroline Rodriguez was
biking to class two weekss ago, a speeding
car hit her hack wheel and sent her flying
onto the pavement. An ambulance arrived
on the scene minutes later and whisked her
to the emergency room, where she was
given extensive MRI tests and treated for
the wounds on her back.
According to the police record, the acci
dent occurred as Rodriguez exited the
Lagunita Court dormitory complex and was
turning onto Santa Theresa street. Deputy
A. James of the Stanford Police Department
called this location one of the major
hotspots for bike accidents on campus.
Bicycle accidents have become ingrained
into the Stanford culture simply because
they are so common. They pop up in the
Stanford Unofficial Guide as one of the
"101 Things to Do Before Graduating."
Some consider them a rite of passage for
freshmen. And in its fliers, the a cappella
group Fleet Street Singers say that it is "a
proud Stanford Tradition ... not unlike bike
accidents."
Getting into a real bike accident, howev
er, is no fun at all, and if you spend a day
walking around campus, you are bound to
see one — or several.
It is difficult to know exactly how many
accidents occur on campus because the
overwhelming majority of them are never
reported. Unless one of the victims is seri
ously injured and needs to be taken to the
hospital immediately, the police are rarely
contacted.
Even so, the police record reports 59
accidents last year and already 45 this year.
Dr. Rochelle Dicker, a surgeon in the
trauma department at Stanford Hospital,
feels strongly that bike accidents are a very
serious problem. Dicker says there is a lack
of awareness among the students of the real
dangers of crashes.
"Even small concussions, short losses of
consciousness, without any residual effect,
add up over time," she said. "So if you get

one on top of the other, it can have a partic
ularly terrible toll."
The hospital treated 196 severe bicycle
injuries last year, a number that has almost
doubled since 1998. Unfortunately, the hos
pital records do not distinguish between
accidents that occur on campus or else
where in the surrounding county, making it
impossible to determine how many take
place at Stanford.
Dicker said she believes bicycle accidents
are a major problem at Stanford but doesn't
think that the University is doing enough to

prevent them.
"My colleagues are continually asking
me what's being done about it on campus
because it doesn't seem to be changing, it
doesn't seem to be getting better," she said.
Carolyn Helmke, the bicycle program
coordinator at the Parking and
Transportation Department, admits that
there is a problem, but also notes the high
number of bicycles on campus — 12,000.
"Bikers assume they have the right of
way. and that leads to problems," she said.
Helmke said she wants to increase the stu

dents' understanding of traffic laws; she is
starting a new program in collaboration
with the Police Department and Vaden to
promote awareness among undergradu
ates.
Ideally, she said she would educate stu
dents when they first arrive at Stanford
during New Student Orientation, but said
that it is impossible because the NSO
schedule is already very packed.
Under the new program, information
about accidents will be gathered to deter
mine the most dangerous intersections on
campus. Then the University will take the
information to lower the number of inci
dents. In 1993. the University created a
similar program, the "Comprehensive
Bicycle Plan," which was designed to
reduce bicycle accidents and thefts. A
decade later, the number of accidents is
approximately the same, and there is still a
lack of information on the problem.
Administrators and experts agree that a
major problem with bike safety is that
Stanford students do not wear bicycle hel
mets. When used properly, bike helmets
decrease the rate of head injury at least by
a factor of 10. Under California law, it is
not mandatory to wear a bicycle helmet if
you are over the age of 18.
Donnovan Somera Yisrael, a health spe
cialist at Vaden. has worked extensively on
this problem and said he is appalled that
only 2 percent of undergraduates wear hel
mets.
"Stanford students think they are free
thinkers, that they don't give in to peer pres
sure." he said. "But when it comes to bicycle
helmets, they don't wear them just because
they look goofy. And I try to confront them
with that."
Bicycle accidents have been a problem
at Stanford for decades, and though most of
the time the injuries are minor, they have
the potential to be fatal. Sergeant Bandy of
the Police Department said, "This is a real
problem, and it isn't t>oinii to go away easi
ly."

me what's being done about it on campus
because it doesn't seem to be changing, it
doesn't seem to be getting better," she said.
Carolyn Helmke, the bicycle program
coordinator at the Parking and
Transportation Department, admits that
there is a problem, but also notes the high
number of bicycles on campus — 12,000.
"Bikers assume they have the right of
way. and that leads to problems," she said.
Helmke said she wants to increase the stu

dents' understanding of traffic laws; she is
starting a new program in collaboration
with the Police Department and Vaden to
promote awareness among undergradu
ates.
Ideally, she said she would educate stu
dents when they first arrive at Stanford
during New Student Orientation, but said
that it is impossible because the NSO
schedule is already very packed.
Under the new program, information
about accidents will be gathered to deter
mine the most dangerous intersections on
campus. Then the University will take the
information to lower the number of inci
dents. In 1993. the University created a
similar program, the "Comprehensive
Bicycle Plan," which was designed to
reduce bicycle accidents and thefts. A
decade later, the number of accidents is
approximately the same, and there is still a
lack of information on the problem.
Administrators and experts agree that a
major problem with bike safety is that
Stanford students do not wear bicycle hel
mets. When used properly, bike helmets
decrease the rate of head injury at least by
a factor of 10. Under California law, it is
not mandatory to wear a bicycle helmet if
you are over the age of 18.
Donnovan Somera Yisrael, a health spe
cialist at Vaden. has worked extensively on
this problem and said he is appalled that
only 2 percent of undergraduates wear hel
mets.
"Stanford students think they are free
thinkers, that they don't give in to peer pres
sure." he said. "But when it comes to bicycle
helmets, they don't wear them just because
they look goofy. And I try to confront them
with that."
Bicycle accidents have been a problem
at Stanford for decades, and though most of
the time the injuries are minor, they have
the potential to be fatal. Sergeant Bandy of
the Police Department said, "This is a real
problem, and it isn't t>oinii to go away easi
ly."

As freshman Caroline Rodriguez was
biking to class two weekss ago, a speeding
car hit her hack wheel and sent her flying
onto the pavement. An ambulance arrived
on the scene minutes later and whisked her
to the emergency room, where she was
given extensive MRI tests and treated for
the wounds on her back.
According to the police record, the acci
dent occurred as Rodriguez exited the
Lagunita Court dormitory complex and was
turning onto Santa Theresa street. Deputy
A. James of the Stanford Police Department
called this location one of the major
hotspots for bike accidents on campus.
Bicycle accidents have become ingrained
into the Stanford culture simply because
they are so common. They pop up in the
Stanford Unofficial Guide as one of the
"101 Things to Do Before Graduating."
Some consider them a rite of passage for
freshmen. And in its fliers, the a cappella
group Fleet Street Singers say that it is "a
proud Stanford Tradition ... not unlike bike
accidents."
Getting into a real bike accident, howev
er, is no fun at all, and if you spend a day
walking around campus, you are bound to
see one — or several.
It is difficult to know exactly how many
accidents occur on campus because the
overwhelming majority of them are never
reported. Unless one of the victims is seri
ously injured and needs to be taken to the
hospital immediately, the police are rarely
contacted.
Even so, the police record reports 59
accidents last year and already 45 this year.
Dr. Rochelle Dicker, a surgeon in the
trauma department at Stanford Hospital,
feels strongly that bike accidents are a very
serious problem. Dicker says there is a lack
of awareness among the students of the real
dangers of crashes.
"Even small concussions, short losses of
consciousness, without any residual effect,
add up over time," she said. "So if you get

one on top of the other, it can have a partic
ularly terrible toll."
The hospital treated 196 severe bicycle
injuries last year, a number that has almost
doubled since 1998. Unfortunately, the hos
pital records do not distinguish between
accidents that occur on campus or else
where in the surrounding county, making it
impossible to determine how many take
place at Stanford.
Dicker said she believes bicycle accidents
are a major problem at Stanford but doesn't
think that the University is doing enough to

prevent them.
"My colleagues are continually asking
me what's being done about it on campus
because it doesn't seem to be changing, it
doesn't seem to be getting better," she said.
