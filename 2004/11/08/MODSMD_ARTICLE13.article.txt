# Dance dance revolution, to fund AIDS research
## 
### MARK MORGAN 
In less than three months, the largest and
longest dance party in Stanford's history will
take place. Hundreds of energetic students
will get together, listen to live music and
dance for hours and hours.
This isn't your typical Saturday night frat
party, though.
Instead, 250 Stanford students will dance
for 24 hours straight — from noon on Jan. 22
to noon on the 23 — in Roble Gym to benefit
the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS
Foundation, one of the leading national
organizations dedicated to funding and con
ducting pediatric AIDS research. By January,
close to 600 people, led by Dance Marathon
co-chairs Sanjay Shah and Pat Bomhack, will
have worked for almost an entire year to
bring dance marathon to Stanford.
Even though the event won't take place for
another three months, organizers can already
be seen dancing around White Plaza — trying
to get people to volunteer — since the dead
line to sign up to dance is Nov. 17.
Although it is in its first year at Stanford,
Dance Marathon is by no means a new form
of student philanthropy. Shah was inspired by
the event held at his brother's school.
Northwestern University, which is holding its
31st Dance Marathon this year.
Today, separate Dance Marathons take
place at more than 100 college campuses
every year, funding various causes. Although
they differ from campus to campus in how
they are run and what charities they benefit,
each one has the same goal-to have fun and to
raise money fora good cause.
Shah describes Dance Marathon as the
perfect fundraiser for college students.
"It's the fundraiser that college students
love to do," he said. "They like to dance, hang
out with friends and use their energy to make
a positive impact on the world."
Northwestern graduate Katie Reibert was
involved in Dance Marathon at Northwestern
for three years and reported similar reasons
for participating.
"It was a great cause, and I knew it would
be a lot of fun," she said.
The combination of entertainment and
charity work are part of the reason why
Dance Marathons are so successful and popu
lar across the country. At Penn State, over
4.000 students work together to raise about
$3.6 million every year. Their students dance
for 48 hours. Last year at Northwestern. 500

students danced for 30 hours straight, and
raised close to $500,000.
While Shah hopes for Stanford's Dance
Marathon to eventually reach those levels, he
expects Stanford to follow the model of
UCLA. Now in its fourth year, the UCLA
Dance Marathon has doubled the money
raised each year, going from $30,000 the first
year to $60,000 the second and $ 120,(WK) last
year.
Numbers like this are exciting for Shah.
"There is potential to raise a ton of
money," he said. "The potential to grow is just
enormous."
Aside from monetary success. Shah hopes
that Dance Marathon can become an event
that unites the campus. Many different groups
and individuals will contribute, from support
provided by the President's Office, the
Alumni Association and Frosh Council to
performances by student dance groups and a
cappella groups.
That dynamic definitely exists at
Northwestern, according to Reibert.
"It is such a big campus wide event ... [it
seemed] like everyone on campus was
involved," she said.
Ultimately, the goal of Dance Marathon is
to educate and inspire the Stanford communi
ty about pediatric AIDS. In accordance with
this goal, there will be speakers who will talk
not only about pediatric AIDS in the U.S. but
also worldwide.
Shah sees Dance Marathon not only as an
event to raise money, but also as a tool to
bring students together and inspire them to
work for change. He hopes that the power of
250 students dancing in compassion and
action will be an experience that leaves a last
ing impact on all who participate.
As for the dancers, they are not worried
about the grueling 24-hour marathon since
they are dancing fora good cause.
"Sure, I will be tired, but you're helping out
little kids who through no fault of their own
have contracted a horrible virus that will
probably take their lives," said freshman
Kacey Hurlbutt, who plans to dance. "When I
look at it that way it isn't that big of a deal."
Another dancer. Freshman Kathryn
Kilner, isn't fazed either.
"Dance marathon combines my love of
dance with a good cause," she said.
For Reibert, who danced at
Northwestern's event, it was all worth it.
"It was hard, but invigorating." she said.
"Seeing all the money we raised was incredible."

Reibert said that Dance Marathon was one
of the best things she did at Northwestern.
"It was an experience that connected me to
a lot of people," she said.
No matter how the first Stanford dance

Marathon turns out. Shah is excited about
what may come in the future.
"We want to plant this seed of something
that will he huge in the years to come."


Dance Marathon organizers rally support for the event and hone their dance skills in the Claw.
