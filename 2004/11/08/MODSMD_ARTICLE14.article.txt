# Progressive groups plan better coordination in the wake of disappointing election setbacks
## 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD 
Several student groups that identify themselves
with progressive ideals have decided to hold
monthly meetings to connect and share ideas in
the wake of last week's election.
Representatives of the groups came to the de
cision at a potluck dinner held on Saturday night
at the Haas Center. More than 30 students at
tended the dinner, including representatives from
Stanford ("ommunity for Peace and Justice, Stan
ford Coalition for Investment Disclosure. Stan
ford Labor Action Committee. Greens at Stan
ford. MEChA, Students fora Sustainable Stan
ford. Stanford Democrats and Environmental
Law Society.
While attempts have been made in the past to

bring progressive groups together, the re-election
of President George W Bush seems to have pro
vided an effective motivation to unite. Event or
ganizer and Stanford Community for Peace and
Justice Naomi IJllian, a senior, set the topic by
asking, "Where do we go from here? How do we
function under this new regime ... or this old re
cycled regime?"
The resulting discussion revolved around how
best to address progressive issues in a unified
manner. Some students wanted to create a sum
mit group and others preferred a more relaxed di
alogue. hut in the end. students to stay connected
through monthly meetings and also through the
Web site for progressive activism at Stanford.
Senior Tim Telleen-Lawton, a representative
of Greens at Stanford who runs the Web site, said

that there had been efforts in the past to establish
a separate organization with a more unified mis
sion statement. This time, those present at the
meeting on Saturday decided that the combina
tion of meetings and the Web site would better
serve the progressive community.
"This way people don't have to invest too much
time in it.and it benefits them and their group," he
said. Members of individual student groups can
post issues and events that their groups are in
volved in and find out what other groups are
doing.
"It's really hard to walk that line between get
ting people to talk to each other and taking them
away from what they're already doing," Ullian
said.
Students also addressed what needs to be done
over the next four years and shared their reactions
to the election. The meeting filled what partici
pants said they saw as a gap in the progressive
community that might have contributed to such
disappointing results in the elections.
"1 don't think this election was about voter
fraud, and I don't think it was about evangelicals,"
explained second-year Ph.D. candidate Kai
Stinchcombe. who is the president of the Stanford
Democrats.
"Figuring out some way to articulate progres
sive values is the key thing we need to do over the
next four years. We don't have a catch phrase that
says this is what progressives are about, this is
what 1 believe in."
Craig Segall. a student at the Law School,
agreed and said that there seemed to be a hole in
the progressive movement. He encouraged pro
gressives to start thinking "about the idea of com
munity."
"People do not respond viscerally to medical
care." Segall said. "We need to start thinking
about our community as a human one. We talk all
too easily about programs, but not moral values."
He referred to Hush's appeal to values, while
Kerry always had "a plan" for the various issues,
and argued that those plans "need to be anchored
in this notion of justice."
