## Editorial ASSU bill is contradictory 
### 
The ASSU recently passed a new bill ("Much
revised ASSU bill passes," Nov. 4) that
claims to "strengthen diversity and free
speech" on campus.
Last spring The Review wrote an editorial accusing
MEChA of being a racist organization, likening it to the
Ku Klux Klan. When MEChA lost special-fees funding
last spring, many thought that The Review's article was
partly responsble.
Iliis new ASSU advocacy bill originated as a response
to The Review's assault on MEChA. In its original form,
the bill proposed to guarantee ASSU support for any
group that was criticized "unfairly" by another student
group. 'Hie bill also condemned the Review's article.
That bill was voted down, twice, because ASSU
senators rightly decided that it was not the Senate's
role to take sides in disputes between student
groups. The new bill avoids mentioning The Review
or MEChA directly, and does not necessarily pledge
to mount one-sided defenses of student groups.
Instead, the ASSU commits to strongly and quickly
supporting all student groups by providing a forum for
open discussion of controversial issues as they arise,
highlighting views that the Senate finds mischaracter
ized or underrepresented.
The Editorial Board is strongly in favor of tack-

ling controversial issues; however, because of the
context in which the bill was passed, we are con
cerned that these forums would be used to drown
out unpopular opinions instead of creating a truly
open atmosphere.
Clearly, in the case of the MEChA / Review dis
pute, the Senate believed that The Review was
wrong and its arguments needed to be discredited.
Though the new bill doesn't focus on this particular
dispute, it will still create difficult situations for the
ASSU, because it will force the Senate to decide
when a group has been unfairly mischaracterized by
another group.
The new bill says that the forum should highlight
views that it finds mischaracterized or underrepresent
ed. However, these goals seem to conflict with the mis
sion of sponsoring an open forum. If the debate is in
tended to highlight one side's views, how can it be an
"open discussion" at the same time?
The revised bill is an improvement from the old
version because the ASSU does not pledge to come to
the defense of certain attacked groups. However,
there are still problems with the revised bill, because
it commits the ASSU to contradictory goals: fostering
free speech, yet taking sides in an effort to support
certain groups against the arguments of others.
