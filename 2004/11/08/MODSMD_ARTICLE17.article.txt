## The 						Daily's election coverage last week 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM 
Coming into this job, I thought
that one of my main tasks would he
addressing what many students have
long asserted (and complained) is
The Daily's left-wing bias. To my
surprise, of all the e-mails I've re
ceived. only one person has made
such a claim — and he is a self-iden
tified liberal.
Whether this is because The
Daily's accusers have stopped read
ing the paper, I don't know. But
looking at the paper's election cov
erage is one way to engage this
claim, and though I didn't come out
of election day with a popular man
date. I'm going to address the issue
anyway.
Before addressing the paper's
election coverage in terms of politi
cal persuasions, though, it is worth
commenting on its breadth and
depth, which in my estimation has
been impressive. From an early-fall
mock presidential debate to both
the Democratic and Republican
election parties. The Daily sent
staffers to do original reporting on
site — a feat our "peer institution"
across the bay was unable to match.
Daily readers can appreciate the
fact that these articles, though dis
cussing national issues, featured
opinions of interviewed college stu
dents and observations specific to
college-student reporting that won't
be found in the national media.
After the election. The Daily's cov
erage of student reaction thorough
ly canvassed the campus, leaving
this reader wanting only for the per
spective of students studying abroad
and perhaps some hard data on elec
tion turnout.
While on the whole I'd say The
Daily has done an impressive job on
taking these bigger-than-campus is
sues and covering them in a way that
is relevant to its readership, there is

still room for improvement. In this
case, it may have been the paper's
coverage of local election matters.
For example, the race for mem
ber of the board of education be
tween Jeff Ota and Bill Evers — the
former a Stanford graduate and cur
rent doctoral candidate, the latter
also a Stanford graduate and current
Hoover Fellow — was never cov
ered.
Similarly, while their races were
not anticipated to be close, Con
gresswoman Anna Eshoo and State
Senator-elect Joe Simitian's races
were not covered until after election
day, though U.S. Senator Barbara
Boxer's predicted coast to victory
was covered last Tuesday.
While national election issues are
more salient for the average Stan
ford student, The Daily still has a
role to play in informing Stanford's
many student voters on the state and
local races in which they'll be casting
their ballots — especially when the
candidates are also members of the
Stanford community.
The Daily's coverage on state
and local issues was not entirely neg
ligent, though, thanks to coverage of
the high-profile and high-spending
race between Steve Poizner and Ira
Ruskin fora local state assembly
seat and of California's 15 ballot
propositions.
In terms of the propositions, The
Daily took care to cover on-campus
events related to these initiatives —
especially the high-profile stem-cell
research proposal, limitations to the
Unfair Competition Law and an
Oct. IS panel discussion on three
propositions. Of all The Daily's cov
erage. this may have been most use
ful to Stanford voters since these
state-specific initiatives aren't cov
ered in the national media and are
notoriously complex.
If anything. The Daily could have
devoted more energy to tapping
professors to share their views in an

effort to further inform students.
Nonetheless, the paper's coverage
on the propositions was a strong
point, save for erred reporting on
the outcome of two of the proposi
tions (especially unfortunate since
many students may have turned to
The Daily for these results) and the
Election-Day placement of a Prop.
71 article. That brings me to my final
point...
Was it bad form of The Daily to
run a lead story on a Ruskin rally on
Election Day without also running a
piece on Poizner, his Republican op
ponent?
I say no.
Some may say this was poor judg
ment on the part of The Daily be
cause it let the paper serve as a
mouthpiece fora single candidate
on the day students went to cast
their votes, giving the article a
boosted impact. This readership Ed
itor will admit that she stopped to re
think her votes for both state assem
bly and Proposition 71 as she read
The Daily on the way to her polling
place.
Yet the alternative, to not run
what would on any other day be a top
news story, does not make sense. If
anything, Ruskin should be com
mended for being media-saavy and
knowing how to get his name in the
headlines on election day, at least as
far as the Stanford vote is concerned.
People concerned about Tues
day's paper have a much better ar
gument in questioning why national
Green Party presidential candidate
David Cobb was relegated to a fea
ture picture on the bottom of the
page, despite being a leader of what
is arguably the nation's most rele
vant third party and someone fol
lowed by many Stanford students.
As far as Poizner-Ruskin goes,
what should rub readers the wrong
way is the article The Daily ran on
thing on Ruskin, and the story's prox
imity to Election Day was not due to
a concerted effort to impact-boost
hut rather to the difficulty (and the ul
timate impossibility) of arranging a
similar interview with Ruskin.
The Daily's commitment to bal
ance is commendable, but here it
was executed poorly. Especially
with the Ruskin rally the next day,
there was no need to publish a short
story on Ruskin in the absence of
any news or information exclusive
to The Daily. The readership editor
will side with the reader on this one
print the stories on the rallies
when they happen, but hold the
Poizner piece to run with the
Ruskin story if the ultimate goal is
true balance.
I promised to address the issue of
chronic left-wing bias here though,
and in The Daily's news coverage of
the 2004 election I think such an al
legation would be unfounded. Of
course, the articles that did run
showed a pervasive sentiment in
support of Democratic candidate
John Kerry — but this reflects the

Nov. 1. which has already been the
subject of a letter to the editor. The
story, "Ruskin highlights differ
ences in tight race," had no news
hook whatsoever.
Ruskin had not just come and
spoken at campus. I lis campaign did
not just release a newsworthy press
release. The only event referenced
in the article was an Oct. 20 debate,
which happened 12 days before this
story was published. It did not be
long in the paper.
For running this story. The Daily
has been accused of left-wing bias.
However I think this is unfair.
Before this article, the paper ran
two stories on Poizner, one follow
ing a Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
campaign appearance and the other
two days later after Poizner spoke
directly to Daily reporters, which
the paper should be commended for
arranging.
Editors have told me that the Nov.
1 Ruskin article was published be
cause the paper had not yet run any-

Relatively fair coverage

attitude of Stanford students, not an
editorial bias. Nonetheless, I'll ask
those who feel this issue still afflicts
the paper to e-mail me the next time
their red flags are raised.
Finally, an issue overshadowed
by the election was a speech given
on Oct. 29 by Harvard Prof. Ruth
Wisse on anti-Semitism. Since then,
and in the wake of Hedy Epstein's
speech, I have heard rumblings that
students feel that either or both of
the speeches were watered down in
The Daily's coverage.
If you were at either of these
speeches, please write me with your
thoughts on how accurately The
Daily's news articles reflected the
content of the speech and the atmo
sphere of the event so I can discuss
this in my next column.
If you do, after four weeks I'll fi
nally have some journalistic capital
— and I intend to spend it.
