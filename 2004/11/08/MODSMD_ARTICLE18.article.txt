Confronting excessive local pride:
Bay Area is no New York
I refer to Julie Park s article on
Thursday's edition of The Daily
("Step aside New Yorkers: The new
NYC," Nov. 4) in which she describes
how Bay Area natives show an ex
cessive degree of pride for their ori
gins.
I am most disturbed by the
thought that the natives will soon be
remarking it as "the greatest place on
earth," akin to how New Yorkers
comment their city is the greatest city
on earth.
While California is a great place to
surf and go to the beach. I fail to see
how the Bay Area can be compared
to New York City.
My girlfriend is a student at
Columbia University. She can get to

see some of the best musicals at
Broadway, shop at the most vibrant
shopping district on 34th Street close
to Times Square, eat at a wide variety
of restaurants through the night and
party at clubs. All this she can do
without a car. as there is a 24-hour
subway system, which New Yorkers
take for granted.
What is offered for Stanford stu
dents without a car? An occasional
musical from the Ram's Head The
atrical Society, the almost-empty
Stanford Shopping Center, the San
Antonio Shopping Center in the
weekends, Palo Alto restaurants that
close at 10 p.m. and frat parties that
are hardly a real club.
Park mentions the reason why na
tives can hardly imagine living in
small-town America is that they have
probably never been in these places

and just don't know what they're like.
Similarly, I would argue that the
pride shown in some Bay Area natives
derives from the fact that they have
not been to the best city in the world.
I fence, if I run into a Bay Area na
tive who has a distorted amount of
pride in his or her geographic position
ing. I would say. "Go to New York."

Intermission article on mixtapes is
insensitive to some students
I am writing to express my disbe
lief at the Intermission article last Fri
day ("Intermission's salute to the
mixtape." Nov. 5). On behalf of the
poor girl on the third floor of
Xanadu, I feel that their mocking of

her plavlist was an invasion of her pri
vacy as well as that of her boyfriend's
in London.
Clearly the two collaborative
writers have no idea what it feels like
to miss someone. I feel sorry for the
poor girl and her incredible playlist.
The writer should know that his face
is wistful and melancholy.

Doting column stereotypes
graduate students
In my opinion the article in The
Stanford Daily about "Zagat guilde to
dating graduate students'' was shallow
and inappropriate. Besides listing cut
and dried opinions and broad general
izations. I also felt personally offended

and was temped to write a much less
friendly letter than this one.

Dating column has xenophobic
undertones
I found Erin Lashnits and Mary
Stone's ("Zagat guide to dating
grads," Nov. 5) to he straightforward
ly racist and xenophobic. Their char
acterization of engineering students
— "foreign," like "grade D meat past
its prime" and with "accents that
sound like parts of their mouths have
been misplaced" — is not funny. It's
offensive and unacceptable.
