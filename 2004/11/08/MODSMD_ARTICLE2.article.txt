# Feast caps off Islamic Society Fast-a-Thon
## 
### XIN XIE 
More than 100 students enjoyed a
succulent lamb dinner, provided by
Stanford Dining, without having to
use a single dining point or Cardinal
dollar. Rather, they were being re
warded for participating in a good
cause.
"Go hungry fora day. so some
one else doesn't have to" was the slo
gan that the Islamic Society of Stan
ford University used to persuade
students to participate in its Ra
madan Fast-a-Thon yesterday.
The event raised about $750 —
exceeding the group's goal of $500
— to be donated to the Rahima
Foundation, a nonprofit organiza
tion that provides food to the desti
tute in San Jose. According to junior
Maham Abbas Mela, the vice-presi
dent of ISSU, several companies —
including Umerani Associates, In
tegnology Corporation, and Click-
Marks — donated five dollars or
more for every person who fasted.
"Instead of judging Muslims, out
siders can now identify with us by
participating in a common goal,"
said third-year masters student
Ibrahim Al-Mojel, the president of
ISSU. "We want to heighten aware
ness of our culture, one that is com
munity-based, encourages people to
live in harmony and shows toler
ance."
"Fasting itself offers everyone a
sense of unity, to experience what
1.2 billion Muslims are experiencing
at the same time around the world."
he said. " This awareness about Ra
madan and Islam will infuse individ
uals with a stronger sense of spiritu

ality, which will make them more
disciplined."
"We've [also] received a lot of
help from Stanford Dining and Stan
ford Associated Religions for which
we are very grateful." Mela said.
She said that Stanford Dining
provided the food for the event, and
both groups helped with the organi
zation.
"Fasting is a good cause, because
we are saving food for those in need
and donating to charity in the

'process," said freshman Ali Afraz
Liaqat. "Fasting has opened my eyes
to the stark reality that many people,
even in America, live in hunger."
"Whether one is rich or poor,
young or old, fasting helps one relate
to those in need," said junior Moham
mad Subeh, an event coordinator.
"Experiencing fasting even fora
day gives people an idea of what
Muslims experience fora month."
said sophomore Shelley Cheung,
vice-president of the Muslim Stu

dents Awareness Network.
A secondary purpose of the event,
according to Mela, was to enlighten
the Stanford community about Ra
madan and the Islamic religion.
"Through community gatherings
such as this one, we hope that every
one inherits an internal sense of re
sponsibility that is a keystone of
Islam," Sabeh said. "This internal
sense will show up as an external re
sult. such as feeding and building
shelters for the homeless."
