# Smoke and Mirrors Aside...
## Redefining Democrats 
### 
A week before 1 left Odessa,
Texas to begin my first
year at Stanford, I was
walking down my street
when a sweet, elderly neighbor and
family friend noticed me and gave me
this parting, final piece of advice, "I
know Stanford's up around San Fran
cisco, but remember your values and
don't become like one of them."
1 know many of you might be sur
prised, but this is the way millions of
Americans think. They are not bad
people; the people in my hometown
are actually as nice as they come. But
they've been exposed to different
things, and Republicans have molded
their view of liberals as flag-burning,
God-blaspheming, peace-flag-waving
hippies.
That's why red state Democrats
need to speak up. Many of us cam
paigned and poured our hearts out
into the last few months, and we now
wake up feeling like hell.
So as a Southerner, this is what
Democrats have to do to win back
America.
1) Have joy. Sounds simple, but in
other words, cheer up. Don't walk
around bitter that conservatives are
running this country.
History is on our side. From race
issues to feminism to gay rights, lib
erals have always stood on the fore
front of social and moral advance.
As Martin Luther King, Jr. said,
"The arc of history is long, but it
bends toward justice."
2) Fight for every race. The next
presidential election might be four
years away, but we have our work cut
out for us before then. Each race helps
frame political attitudes nationwide
and affects the whole landscape.
If the Democrats lose four more
Senate seats in the 2(X)6 elections,
they'll lose their ability to filibuster
Bush's judicial nominations, and we
can all say good-bye to affirmative ac
tion, a woman's right to choose and the
separation between church and state.
3) Define God and "moral values."
Red-state voters want to be able to
identify with candidates by knowing
how religion calculate into their think
ing. Liberals win on the issues, but we
have serious PR problems. We just
have to connect the Democratic agen
da to notions of morality, family and
God, as shameless as that might feel.
4) Get over yourself. I've been so
annoyed by those who critique Tom
Daschle, say Michael Moore's a radi
cal and try to sound smart by saying
they're fiscal conservatives. Republi
cans have something we need: party
discipline. Ronald Reagan's famous
11th amendment was, "Thou shalt not
speak ill of any fellow Republican."
It's time we quit criticizing our own in

public.
5) Dumb it down and get dirty.
That means running negative cam
paign ads that parallel the type of vi-

cious derna
gogu e r y
launched against
patriots like Max
Cleland, Bill
Clinton and John
Edwards.
The
Kerry campaign
missed its chance
to tear at Bush's
character and
honor, and in-

stead ran Brady Bunch ads that had
less resonance in voters' minds. Run
campaigns as much on character as on
the issues.
6) Play offense. The Republicans
took our legitimate disdain for Bush
and convinced the American public
that we were all just hateful people.
As a result, Kerry never made di
rect criticisms of the incumbent presi
dent during his nomination accep
tance speech, and he never nipped the
"flip-flopper" charges at the bud.
Democrats need to stand up early
and passionately, as well as stake out
issues before the Republicans beat
them to it.
7) Be proud of being a liberal. I'll
never forget listening to an audience
member at a Democratic National
Convention event choking back tears
and asking former Gore campaign
manager Donna Brazile, "When did
being liberal become so bad?"
Brazile explained how we lost the
word years ago during the Great Soci
ety reforms, when conservatives ap
pealed to voters' most sinister hatreds
toward the poor and minorities. Don't
run away from the liberal title like Kerry
did; be unapologetic and flaunt it.
8) Become more hawkish. Harry
Truman and John F. Kennedy were
more hawkish than their opponents.
Liberals will continue to lose if they
look weak on defense and have mem
bers that keep sporting those silly "war
is not the answer" bumper stickers.
"If you punch me, I'll punch you
harder." That's the saying posted in
Terry McAuliffe's office. And it ap
plies to our generation more than any
thing. For America to progress, it
needs us to fight, fight, and fight. As
Martin Luther King, Jr. said, "Our
lives begin to end the day we become
silent about things that matter."
This is our generation's cause. Let's
make sure it outlasts us.
