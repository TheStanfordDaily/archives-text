# Student Pet Peeves
## Reclaiming Stanford's roads from rodents 
### YAMANDA WRIGHT 
Exactly what have these campus
squirrels been eating?
Is there some new pollutant in the
atmosphere that they've inhaled while
scurrying that rids them of all fright and
worldly concern? When I was younger,
throwing rocks at them from the play
ground swings meant they hurried
away in fear of the human.
Sure, they danced in front of cars
like in some Dr. Doolittle adapta
tion of Russian roulette, pretending
not to see them until scurrying away
to their burrows in newly manicured
lawns across the city. And I would
exhale a sigh of relief because, after
eating a Happy Meal burger, the last
thing I needed was another dead an
imal on my conscience.
That is how it is done, you rats
with furry tails. Pay attention: You
should fear the wrath of humans and
automobiles with a terror only sur
passed by that for Sara Michelle Cel
lar movies and Martha Stewart.
Instead, last week 1 watched as
one particular idiot-squirrel pranced
in front of my bike like a rodent on a
suicide mission; like the dense char
acter in scary movies that runs up the
staircase from maniac axe-murderer

man where she is usually trapped
and killed gorily, and to which we
clever college kids mumble "That's
what you get, loserface."
I was riding down Mayfield to run
an errand Monday, but rather than
everything going as normal, a ran
dom black rodent waddled its cute
little self into the middle of the lane
behind its mother. It paused there
and then turned its back to me, and I
puckered my lips to blow out a
steady stream of air in relief at its
short attention span. I thought I
could easily navigate around him
without hurting him.
Oh-ho-ho, no no. That's how
things work out in fairytale land, and
then unicorns come out with purple
bunnies and leprechauns and 1990
gas prices. Here in reality it moved.
The squirrel walked in front of
the wheel as if to say, "I don't want
your pity. I want your soul to suffer
after a lifetime of remorse. I want
you to spend your days tracing rue
fully over cartoon drawings of
Rocky and Bullwinkle just as wid
ows reminisce over dead husbands in
old movies."
He was not fatally hurt and scur
ried away immediately, but his body
lay pasted to the gravel fora second

like a wad of used chewing gum, a few
hairs flying theatrically in the air be
fore wafting under the next bicycler.
I couldn't laugh at the irony of
having accidentally hit one of the
infamous, evil Stanford squirrels or
cry at the sadness of the rodent fur
frying on my tire in midday sun for
the gentle shame of it all. Instead. I
was forced to rest my head in my
hands in pseudo-horror as a pack of
disapproving pedestrians walked
past me at the intersection, when all
I really wanted to do was run the
stop sign and ride until riding went
out of style.
Somewhere on campus a father
squirrel is holding the family togeth
er through the healing process, and
a radical flock of rodent-insurgents
are organizing to make my Wal-
Mart bike the new dung-stop of
northern California.
But so far, I'm winning. Ms. Mer
ciless Rodent Hurter: 200 points.
The rodent population of inner-city
Palo Alto: 0 points. For now.

Yamanda Wright hates all fury little
creatures, although no rodents were
killed in the writing of this article. E
