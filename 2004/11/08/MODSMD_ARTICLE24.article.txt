## Immigration law should be skills-based 
### EDWARD P. LAZEAR 
Immigrants from Mexico do far
worse when they migrate to the Unit
ed States than do immigrants from
other countries. Those difficulties are
more a reflection of U.S. immigration
policy than they are of underlying cul
tural differences. The following facts
from the 2(XX) U.S. Census reveal that
Mexican immigrants do not move
into mainstream American society as
rapidly as do other immigrants.
1) Eighty percent of non-Mexican
immigrants are fluent in English.
Among Mexicans, the number is 49
percent.
2) Non-Mexican working immi
grants have an average wage income
of $21.(XX) a year. Mexican immi
grants have an average wage income
ofsl2,o(X)ayear.
3) The typical non-Mexican immi
grant has a high school diploma. The
typical Mexican immigrant has less
than an eighth-grade education.
4) Compared to other Hispanics,
only 49 percent of Mexican immi
grants are fluent in English, com
pared to 62 percent of non-Mexican
Hispanics.
5) Mexican average incomes are
about 75 percent that of other His
panic immigrants, and Mexican im
migrants have about two and a half
fewer years of schooling.
Two other facts are worth noting.
First. Mexican immigrants live in
communities where 15 percent of the

residents were also born in Mexico.
Non-Mexican immigrants live in
communities where fewer than three
percent of the residents are from their
native land. Second, Mexican immi
grants account fora much higher pro
portion of the immigrant population
than does any other group. 29 percent
in the 2(XX) census.
The last two points are key. Indi
viduals become assimilated when
their incentives to do so are great. An
immigrant from Mexico who moves
to East Los Angeles can survive
knowing only Spanish and interacting
primarily with people from her or his
own community. A Bulgarian immi
grant to Billings, Mont., must learn
English quickly or return to Bulgaria.
A number of studies suggest that
the most important factor in explain
ing English fluency and other aspects
of assimilation is the proportion of in
dividuals in one's community who
come from his or her native land.
When there are many, assimila
tion is slow; when there are few, as
similation is rapid. Mexicans often do
poorly because they have been part
of a large wave of immigrants who
have similar cultures, languages and
backgrounds.
One other factor is that U.S. immi
gration policy selects immigrants
from Mexico primarily on the basis of
family connection rather than skill.
Immigrants from other countries are
more likely to enter and take jobs in
highly skilled occupations.

In fact, our most able immigrants
come from North Africa: Morocco,
Algeria and Libya. Is this because
those countries have the world's best
educational systems and cultures?
No, it is because it is virtually im
possible to enter the United States
from those countries. The only North
Africans to get in are highly educated
and talented.
Nothing inherent in Mexicans
causes difficulties for them when they
come to the United Stated. Instead, it
is our immigration policy that en
courages the formation of large, insu
lar Mexican communities. Addition
ally, our policies do not employ the
same selection criteria for Mexicans
as they do for applicants from other
countries.
Moving in the direction of skills
based immigration and away from
relative-based immigration is one
step we can take to ensure that immi
grants do well and become integrated
when they come to the United States.
Moreover, a conscious policy that en
courages a more balanced distribu
tion of countries from which we draw
immigrants will improve the speed of
assimilation and raise the incomes of
both immigrants and U.S. natives.
