## Fulton, Cardinal can't stop UCSB 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Without much offensive help, senior captain and goal
keeper Rohby Fulton could only carry the team so far on
Saturday night. Fulton nearly shut out No. 5 UC-Santa
Barbara (15-2-1.6-2-0 Big West Conference) with five key
saves.
Unfortunately for the Stanford men's soccer team (7-5-
5,2-3-2 Pacific-10 Conference), the Gaucho offense finally
slipped a goal past Fulton, while the Cardinal's offense was
anemic on the night and could not tally one of its own.
The 1 -0 loss to UC-Santa Barbara was especially signif
icant because conventional wisdom says that Stanford's
chances of an NCAA bid are shrinking and will be ex
tremely slim if the Cardinal lose the season finale at No. 6
California (11-3-3,3-3-1 Pac-10).
The loss against the Gauchos was so significant because
the game was a golden chance to bolster Stanford's fading
playoff hopes.
"Obviously, we're really disappointed with a loss, espe
cially since we thought winning a game against UCSB
would've put us into the NCAA tournament," said head
coach Bret Simon.

fensive categories, as it earned six corner kicks to Stan

Junior midfielder Bronson McDonald heads the ball Saturday against UCSB
ford's one and outshot the Cardinal 11-2. This was
even more evident in the second hall when UC-Santa
Barbara ratcheted up their intensity after a dead
locked first half.
The dynamic combination for the Gauchos was
Drew McAthy and Jonathan Davis.
McAthy and Davis connected on give-and-go plays
multiple times in the game to generate scoring
chances. In the 55th minute. McAthy passed to Davis
and then bolted up the field through the Cardinal box.
Davis found his partner about fifteen yards out and
McAthy fired the ball into the net. McAthy is UC-
Santa Barbara's all-time leading scorer with 48 goals in
his college career.
In comparison, Stanford could not generate any
thing for their offense throughout the match. The Gau
cho keeper was never really threatened and had to
make only one save all day.
"I think we played hard, but we know that they
were the better team last night." Simon said.
The Cardinal remained close for much of the match
only through the stellar performance of their defense,
including Fulton. The keeper made five key saves and
was constantly threatened as he saw 11 shots. With the
impressive effort. Fulton lived up to his own expecta-

Gauchos' defense
too much for men

tion to play every game as if it is a playoff game.
"We desperately want to make the NCAA tourna
ment and progress to the College Cup," Simon said.
After the loss to the Gauchos, the Cardinal only have
one more opportunity to prove their worth over other
teams with similar records.
Stanford will see another critical game next week
end as they take on No. 6 California. However, the ri
valry will take a back seat to the business at hand.
"We have a great rivalry against Cal but that's sec
ondary to us." Simon said. "We both want to win and
end the season on a positive note hopefully entering the
NCAA's."
The Golden Bears nearly beat the Cardinal in their
last meeting at Maloney Field as Stanford scored two
second-half goals fora 2-2 come-froni-behind tie. Cal is
coming off a ()-() tie against Portland. The Bears abso
lutely dominated Portland, out-shooting the squad 22-7.
"it's my best guess that a win against Cal would get
us in," Simon said. "It's even possible that we could get
in without winning either. But for that to happen we'd
need to rely on other team's slip-ups.
"We've got one of the toughest strengths of sched
ule but you can't just say we were competitive against
the best, you need to win some games."
