Without much offensive help, senior captain and goal
keeper Rohby Fulton could only carry the team so far on
Saturday night. Fulton nearly shut out No. 5 UC-Santa
Barbara (15-2-1.6-2-0 Big West Conference) with five key
saves.
Unfortunately for the Stanford men's soccer team (7-5-

slipped a goal past Fulton, while the Cardinal's offense was
anemic on the night and could not tally one of its own.

chances of an NCAA bid are shrinking and will be ex

California (11-3-3,3-3-1 Pac-10).
The loss against the Gauchos was so significant because
the game was a golden chance to bolster Stanford's fading
playoff hopes.

would've put us into the NCAA tournament," said head
coach Bret Simon.
UC-Santa Barbara dominated the Cardinal in the of
fensive categories, as it earned six corner kicks to Stan
