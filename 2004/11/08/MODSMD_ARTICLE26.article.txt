# Card leave Pac-10 title hopes in Washington
## 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 14 Stanford women's soccer
team (12-5-3, 4-3-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
had high expectations this weekend as it
headed north to take on No. 25 Washing
ton and Washington State (8-7-4,3-4-2 Pac
-10) in its final two Pac-10 match-ups of the
season. A sweep over the conference rivals
could have meant a Pac-10 title or, at least,
a lock on earning a home bid for the up
coming NCAA tournament. But the Cardi
nal come home empty-handed after losing
in overtime to the Huskies on Friday night
and earning a draw against the Cougars on
Sunday.
It was instead No. 10 Arizona and No. 11
UCLA who captured the shared league
title following wins this weekend over Ore
gon and Southern California. While the
Bruins earned the title for the second year
in a row, it was the Wildcats who stole the
show. After spending the last few years at
the bottom of the Pac-10 standings, the

Wildcats came out of nowhere this season
and are now headed to their first-ever
NCAA tournament.
The Cardinal's loss drops them to third
in the Pac-10 standings. Because of the
competitiveness of the Pac-10 conference
this season, the Cardinal's record should be
good enough to earn them an invitation to
the NCAA tournament, which will begin
on Friday. Although their chances at being
awarded home-field advantage are slim fol
lowing this weekend, the Cardinal remain
optimistic.
"1 think if we would have won both
games, then we would have had a great
chance of having the home bid," said head
coach Paul Ratcliffe. "Obviously you have
to look at the logic of the game and realize
that they are a ranked team and they beat
us in the second overtime, so it wasn't an
easy game for them."
Indeed the Cardinal and Huskies did go
to battle on Friday night in a game that saw
two overtime sessions and last-minute action. Despite
the chilling 45-degree weather, the Cardinal played an
even match with the Huskies through two regular halves.
The Cardinal posted eight shots to the Huskies' ten
thanks to three shots apiece from senior forward Marcie
Ward and junior midfielder Leah Tapscott.
In the two overtime sessions, however, the Cardinal
offense went flat and was limited to just one shot over the
next 17 minutes of play. On the other side of the field, the
Huskies continued to apply pressure, posting four shots
on goal. Senior goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart was solid as
usual, racking up five saves until finally letting one slip
past her in the game's final minutes.
The I luskies captured a big break when forward Kim
Taylor fired a 15-yard shot that sailed over Barnhart and
into the top left corner of the net. Taylor was assisted by
Tina Frimpong. who had been an offensive force all
evening, accounting for five of her team's 14 shots.
"Washington was a good team and we played really
well against them." Ratcliffe said. "We created a few
good chances but we didn't finish our chances. It was a
really difficult loss to take."
The Cardinal put it all on the line on Sunday after
noon. as they took on Washington State in their second
game of the weekend. With the Cardinal hoping to sal
vage their weekend and the Cougars looking to make a

Overtime unkind
to Stanford women

case fora postseason bid, both teams came out hard
making for an aggressive match-up.
It was again all about overtime for the Cardinal, who
battled through 110 minutes of play to come up with a
scoreless tie.
"It was kind of the same story." Ratcliffe said. "We
created good chances again, but we just didn't have the
final touch. It's tough to tie but better than a loss after ex
periencing what we experienced on Friday."
The Cardinal put up 10 shots on the afternoon and did
a better job at creating opportunities in their two over
time sessions. The Cardinal offense, led by Ward and fel
low senior forward Martha West, collected three shots
over the final 20 minutes to the Cougars' one.
Barnhart was solid in goal, racking up five saves en
route to her ninth shutout of the season.
While disappointed about not capturing the league
title, the Cardinal remain focused on the future. Their
key to success in the NCAA tournament is to capitalize
on their offensive opportunities by scoring more goals.
"Against good teams, you're only going to get maybe
three, four good chances in a game and out of those three
or four chances, we've got to execute," Ratcliffe said.
The field of 64 will be announced tomorrow at

While disappointed about not capturing the league
title, the Cardinal remain focused on the future. Their
key to success in the NCAA tournament is to capitalize
on their offensive opportunities by scoring more goals.
"Against good teams, you're only going to get maybe
three, four good chances in a game and out of those three
or four chances, we've got to execute," Ratcliffe said.

The No. 14 Stanford women's soccer
team (12-5-3, 4-3-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
had high expectations this weekend as it
headed north to take on No. 25 Washing
ton and Washington State (8-7-4,3-4-2 Pac
-10) in its final two Pac-10 match-ups of the
season. A sweep over the conference rivals
could have meant a Pac-10 title or, at least,
a lock on earning a home bid for the up
coming NCAA tournament. But the Cardi
nal come home empty-handed after losing
in overtime to the Huskies on Friday night
and earning a draw against the Cougars on
Sunday.
It was instead No. 10 Arizona and No. 11
UCLA who captured the shared league
title following wins this weekend over Ore
gon and Southern California. While the
Bruins earned the title for the second year
in a row, it was the Wildcats who stole the
show. After spending the last few years at
the bottom of the Pac-10 standings, the

Wildcats came out of nowhere this season
and are now headed to their first-ever
NCAA tournament.
The Cardinal's loss drops them to third
in the Pac-10 standings. Because of the
competitiveness of the Pac-10 conference
this season, the Cardinal's record should be
good enough to earn them an invitation to
the NCAA tournament, which will begin
on Friday. Although their chances at being
awarded home-field advantage are slim fol
lowing this weekend, the Cardinal remain
optimistic.
"1 think if we would have won both
games, then we would have had a great
chance of having the home bid," said head
coach Paul Ratcliffe. "Obviously you have
to look at the logic of the game and realize
that they are a ranked team and they beat
us in the second overtime, so it wasn't an
easy game for them."
Indeed the Cardinal and Huskies did go
to battle on Friday night in a game that saw
two overtime sessions and last-minute action. Despite
the chilling 45-degree weather, the Cardinal played an
even match with the Huskies through two regular halves.
The Cardinal posted eight shots to the Huskies' ten
thanks to three shots apiece from senior forward Marcie
Ward and junior midfielder Leah Tapscott.
In the two overtime sessions, however, the Cardinal
offense went flat and was limited to just one shot over the
next 17 minutes of play. On the other side of the field, the
Huskies continued to apply pressure, posting four shots
on goal. Senior goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart was solid as
usual, racking up five saves until finally letting one slip
past her in the game's final minutes.
The I luskies captured a big break when forward Kim
Taylor fired a 15-yard shot that sailed over Barnhart and
into the top left corner of the net. Taylor was assisted by
Tina Frimpong. who had been an offensive force all
evening, accounting for five of her team's 14 shots.
"Washington was a good team and we played really
well against them." Ratcliffe said. "We created a few
good chances but we didn't finish our chances. It was a
really difficult loss to take."
The Cardinal put it all on the line on Sunday after
noon. as they took on Washington State in their second
game of the weekend. With the Cardinal hoping to sal
vage their weekend and the Cougars looking to make a

to Stanford women

case fora postseason bid, both teams came out hard
making for an aggressive match-up.
It was again all about overtime for the Cardinal, who
battled through 110 minutes of play to come up with a
scoreless tie.
"It was kind of the same story." Ratcliffe said. "We
created good chances again, but we just didn't have the
final touch. It's tough to tie but better than a loss after ex
periencing what we experienced on Friday."
The Cardinal put up 10 shots on the afternoon and did
a better job at creating opportunities in their two over
time sessions. The Cardinal offense, led by Ward and fel
low senior forward Martha West, collected three shots
over the final 20 minutes to the Cougars' one.
Barnhart was solid in goal, racking up five saves en
route to her ninth shutout of the season.
While disappointed about not capturing the league
title, the Cardinal remain focused on the future. Their
key to success in the NCAA tournament is to capitalize
on their offensive opportunities by scoring more goals.
"Against good teams, you're only going to get maybe
three, four good chances in a game and out of those three
or four chances, we've got to execute," Ratcliffe said.
