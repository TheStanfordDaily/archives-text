The No. 14 Stanford women's soccer
team (12-5-3, 4-3-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
had high expectations this weekend as it
headed north to take on No. 25 Washing

coach Paul Ratcliffe. "Obviously you have
to look at the logic of the game and realize
that they are a ranked team and they beat
us in the second overtime, so it wasn't an
easy game for them."
Indeed the Cardinal and Huskies did go
to battle on Friday night in a game that saw
