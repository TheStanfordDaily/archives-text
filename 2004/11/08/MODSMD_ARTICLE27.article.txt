# Volleyball sweeps in LA
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS STAFF WRITER 
In a crucial set of weekend matchups to
determine how the Pacific-10 Conference
will most likely shake out, the No. 12 Stan
ford Cardinal (17-6, 9-3 Pac-10) came out
firmly in control.
The Cardinal beat both No. 16 UCLA
(15-8,8-5 Pac-10) and No. 4 USC (15-4,10-
3 Pac-10) this past weekend, giving Stan
ford a 2-0 season sweep of the Bruins and
a split with the Women of Troy. The pair of
wins also put Stanford in a tie with USC for
second place in the conference.
UCLA, although ranked lower than the
Cardinal, proved to be the more competi
tive opponent of the weekend, stretching

Stanford to five games before the Cardinal
could claim victory. Stanford came out slug
gish in the first game, dropping 30-25 to the
Bruins and being closed out by a kill from
UCLA middle blocker Nana Meriwether,
who finished with nine kills and nine blocks.
Game two went to Stanford, as the Car
dinal flipped the score and beat UCLA,
30-25. Stanford came from behind late in
the game, trailing 24-21 before tying the
game at 25 and closing things out on an at
tack error by the Bruins.
Game three was the tightest of the
match, as the Cardinal took a 2-1 lead in
the match, but not before being pushed to
overtime by the Bruins. Stanford and
UCLA were tied at 30 after a kill from
sophomore outside hitter Kristin Richards

(who had 23 on the night) when the Cardi
nal took advantage of two attack errors by
the Bruins to take the game.
Game four saw the Bruins pull even
with another 30-25 win. The two teams
played evenly through most of the game,
but UCLA was able to put together a late
four-point run to reach game point at 29-
24. This left too big a hole for the Cardinal
to dig themselves out of, as the Bruins took
the game on a kill by Meriwether.
In the decisive game five, Stanford
came out early and knocked the Bruins
out, taking an 8-1 advantage before the
teams switched sides of the court. From
there, Stanford simply kept pace and
closed out the Bruins, 15-8, on a kill by se
nior outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani, her

24th and final kill on the night.
Stanford's defensive effort was led by a
career-high 10 blocks from sophomore
middle blocker Lizzie Suiter, part of 20
blocks by the Cardinal. In addition to a
season-high 23 kills. Richards also led the
Cardinal with 19 digs. Senior opposite
Jenn Hucke had 16 kills, the third Cardinal
to reach double digits.
On Friday, Stanford dominated USC in
all aspects of the game. Showing no signs
of the fear that handicapped them when
these teams played in L.A. earlier this
year, the Cardinal came out energized,
took the lead, and never looked back.
In game one, Stanford hit over .500 as a
team, led by a hot Richards still building
on her momentum from the UCLA match.
After playing tight through the first half of
the game, Stanford exploded on the
Women of Troy and took the game 30-18
on a kill by Hucke, who was feeling ill be
fore the game.
Game two was slightly closer, but the
Cardinal still outplayed the Women of
Troy. Stanford built a small lead early in
the game and didn't let USC come back,
opening up to a six-point victory on a kill
by freshman middle blocker Franci Gi
rard, 30-24. Stanford simply was not mak
ing mistakes, hitting a match-low .350 for
the game and not registering a service
error in the first two games.
Game three saw the Cardinal finish
what they started and sweep out USC.
With the game tied late at 26-26, Stanford
took a timeout to collect itself. The break
was apparently exactly what the Cardinal
needed, as the team scored four of the next
five points to take the game and match on
a kill by Ogonna Nnamani, her match
leading 27th.
Although the Cardinal hit extremely
well (over .400 as a team for the match),
the defense was really what gave the match
to Stanford. Led by junior libero Courtney
Schultz and Richards, the Cardinal out
dug the Ladies of Troy. Suiter and Girard,
playing against a much taller middle block
er, Emily Adams, registered 12 blocks,
double what the Women of Troy mus
tered.
Stanford next sees action against the
Oregon schools this coming weekend.
From there, the Cardinal come back
home to host the Washington schools be
fore traveling to Arizona to close out the
season.
