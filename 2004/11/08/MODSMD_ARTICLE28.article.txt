## Terrell Owens: celebrated NFL bad boy 
### 
With the Carolina Panthers placing
He Hate Me (a.k.a. Rod Smart) on
injured reserve, the XFL has finally
expired, and it's time for all former XFL fans
to find a new hero.
Unlike approximately KKJ percent of my
readership, I actually attended an XFL game

(albeit for free — thanks
Bordoni), and braved in
clement San Francisco
weather to watch the
Demons play an unmemo
rable game at the Park for
merly known as Pac Bell.
While this alone doesn't
make me a superior sports
fan (although it certainly
helps), it does show that I

like fringe sports, have an affinity fora Vince
McMahon-produced product, and like ath
letes who like style, sometimes over sub
stance.
And this is where Terrell Owens comes into
play. T.O. is like a brother to me. And to quote
Derek Zoolander. male model extraordinaire,
"when I say brother, I don't mean. like, an actu
al brother, but I mean it like the way black peo
ple use it. Which is more meaningful I think."
The beauty of T.O is the dichotomy that he
presents — he questions the sexuality of Jeff
Garcia, and yet he drives a pimped-out Volk
swagen Bug convertible. I think we all would
agree that T.O.'s bailer image portends a man
who would most likely be driving a black Es
calade (like Larry Coker), lowered, with
Sprewells, and a presidential tint. And yet,
from careful examination of T.O.'s appear
ance on MTV's Cribs, it's obvious that he
owns a red VW Bug convertible, with 81 's
stitched prominently on each seat. If it looks
like a rat, and smells like a rat, we 11...
Car choices aside, any criticism of T.O. that
focuses on his on-field behavior is absurd.
You can criticize him for wanting to spank
Pam Oliver, but you can't criticize his talent,
the entertainment he provides to the league,
his squeaky-clean off-the-field behavior, or
his ingenious on-field celebrations.
Is he an egomaniac who craves media at-
