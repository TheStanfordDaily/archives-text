## Terrell Owens: celebrated NFL bad boy 
### 
With the Carolina Panthers placing
He Hate Me (a.k.a. Rod Smart) on
injured reserve, the XFL has finally
expired, and it's time for all former XFL fans
to find a new hero.
Unlike approximately KKJ percent of my
readership, I actually attended an XFL game

(albeit for free — thanks
Bordoni), and braved in
clement San Francisco
weather to watch the
Demons play an unmemo
rable game at the Park for
merly known as Pac Bell.
While this alone doesn't
make me a superior sports
fan (although it certainly
helps), it does show that I

like fringe sports, have an affinity fora Vince
McMahon-produced product, and like ath
letes who like style, sometimes over sub
stance.
And this is where Terrell Owens comes into
play. T.O. is like a brother to me. And to quote
Derek Zoolander. male model extraordinaire,
"when I say brother, I don't mean. like, an actu
al brother, but I mean it like the way black peo
ple use it. Which is more meaningful I think."
The beauty of T.O is the dichotomy that he
presents — he questions the sexuality of Jeff
Garcia, and yet he drives a pimped-out Volk
swagen Bug convertible. I think we all would
agree that T.O.'s bailer image portends a man
who would most likely be driving a black Es
calade (like Larry Coker), lowered, with
Sprewells, and a presidential tint. And yet,
from careful examination of T.O.'s appear
ance on MTV's Cribs, it's obvious that he
owns a red VW Bug convertible, with 81 's
stitched prominently on each seat. If it looks
like a rat, and smells like a rat, we 11...
Car choices aside, any criticism of T.O. that
focuses on his on-field behavior is absurd.
You can criticize him for wanting to spank
Pam Oliver, but you can't criticize his talent,
the entertainment he provides to the league,
his squeaky-clean off-the-field behavior, or
his ingenious on-field celebrations.
Is he an egomaniac who craves media at-

tention? Undoubtedly. But he also performs on the
field with a league-leading 9 TD's (before this Sun
day), and has turned the Eagles into strong Super Bowl
contenders. Sharpie celebration, defaming the Cow
boys' star, mocking Ray Lewis'squirrel dance, shaking
the pom-poms — all brilliant. To paraphrase Tony
Kornheiser from the Nov. sth episode of PTI. Terrell
Owens is the number one stunna of the NFL. As 1 like
to say, Joe Horn's style is generic. T.O.'s authentic
made.
If the Ravens want to bash Owens for his on-field be
havior (except for Deion, who acknowledges T.O.'s
brilliance), let me remind them what Nas once said:
"you can hate me now / But I won't stop now / Cause 1
can't stop now." And try as they might, the Ravens sim
ply couldn't stop T.O. from picking up over 1 (X) yards re
ceiving, or from catching the game-winning TD.
Hate him if you want, but at least stop him on the
field before you resort to off-the-field, post-game, ad
hoc news-conference attacks on the man. He might
have killed your defense, but Ray Lewis was involved
in a double homicide case.
This leads me to a major tangent in this column.
Why is it that an athlete like Ray Lewis, who went to
trial fora double-murder charge, remains a
spokesperson for the NFL. yet a manager such as
Wally Backman gets fired for his background, which
only includes a fourth-degree assault charge, DUIs,
and bankruptcy?
For those who don't know the Backman story, the
former New York Met was recently hired by the Ari
zona Diamondbacks to be their new manager, and
fired four days later after the D-backs investigated his
background. First, why didn't the Diamondbacks run a

T. 0., not Lewis,
NFL role model

background check in the first place? And more impor
tantly, if athletes are allowed third and fourth tries
(prime example: Lawrence Phillips), why do coaches
not receive the same opportunities?
Athletes might not be role models, as Sir Charles
once stated (before possibly throwing the reporter
through a second-floor window), but as far as I know,
the law still holds an athlete responsible for his or her
actions. But not Ty Law, he's injured.
Ray Lewis may label T.O. a coward for his on-field an
tics. yet this is a man who went to a Super Bowl party in
Atlanta, went gangsta and jumped a couple of kids out
side of the nightclub, and lied in a limo to avoid arrest.
You want a true coward. Ray? Look at yourself,
and how the murder charges against you were dropped
in exchange fora guilty plea of obstruction of justice,
during which you ratted out your friends for their part
in the murder. You sold your friends out, testified
against them, so you could continue with NFL star
dom. And yet. somehow the league decides that this is
a man who they want promoting their product, who
they want as the face of the NFL.
Let's quote Owens as a means to succinctly summa
rize this article: "You have a guy like Ray Lewis, who
1 thought he was pretty much my friend. This is a guy,
double murder case, and he could have been in jail, but
it seems like the league embraces a guy like that. But
I'm going out scoring touchdowns and having fun. but
I'm the bad guy."
Preach on. Brother Owens. Preach on.
