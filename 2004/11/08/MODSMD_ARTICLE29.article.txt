# Men's water polo crushes Pacific, LBSU
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo team
left its opponents in the dust in both of this
weekend's home games, winning by seven or
more goals for the 12th time this season. Alter
defeating No. 15 Pacific 14-7 on Saturday, the
Cardinal once again reached double digits
against No. 9 Long Beach State, winning 13-3.
' The Cardinal left the Tigers and the 49ers
breathless by the end of the first half in each
game. Leading 10-3 and 6-1 at the end of the
second periods. Stanford quickly ended its op
ponents' hopes of making the game close.
"It's tough when you're down five. six. seven
goals to come back and play hard, said junior
goalkeeper Chad Taylor. "It gives us the ad
vantage in that they kind of give up."
Pacific started out with an early 1-0 lead
thanks to freshman Dragan Bakic's shot one
minute into the match, but Stanford followed
with eight unanswered goals. While there was
some back-and-forth action in the first period,
the second period highlighted the difference in
experience between the two teams.
Junior driver and All-American Thomas

Hopkins' head-on shot past two Tigers opened
up the second period. Then, senior two-meter
Greg Cruni scored his second goal of the day off
an assist from senior driver and two-time
Olympian Tony Azevedo. Junior driver Peter
Varelias pulled away to score his second goal
and Azevedo added two more goals for the
Cardinal. By the end of the second the score
read 10-3.
The Tigers failed to coordinate their attack
for the rest of the match as well. A more expe
rienced Stanford squad offered some insight as
to Pacific's deficiencies.
"I think they could have done a better job at
playing team defense." Hopkins said. "A lot of
times they left say, Greg, wide open in the mid
dle or some of our better shooters up top open
when they should have been picked up. I guess
also on offense they could work a little harder
as far as running more drives and shooting a
couple more lobs at Chad."
"Pacific is still a really young team." Azeve
do said. "They come out and play a team like us,
they're not experienced, and they make little
mistakes. We capitalize on their mistakes, and
that's exactly what happened. They come out.
they screw up here and we score, they screw up

again and we score."
The Tigers are a very green team. Their top
scorer is sophomore Matt Turnbull, but it was
the rookie Bakic who gave the Tigers another
three-goal performance.
On Sunday. Stanford faced a more experi
enced team coached by Tony Azevedo's father.
Rick. While the Cardinal held a three-point
lead over the 49ers, the game was close during
the first few minutes of action. Long Beach had
plenty of quality shots but because of Taylor's
14-save game. Stanford was able to pull away
by the half. Taylor allowed only two goals dur
ing his time of play.
"When our defense plays well they funnel
shots towards me," Taylor said. "It makes it a
lot easier on myself when I don't have to worry
about shots coming from everywhere, just one
specific point."
Hopkins scored the first goal of the game,
skipping the ball into the corner of the cage. A
steal by Hopkins set up a pass to Crum for the
Cardinal's second score. Azevedo scored a few
minutes later and senior Trent Weisen scored
on a rebound shot. With four seconds left. Long

Junior goalkeeper Chad Taylor could afford to let the offense do the work over the
weekend, as the Cardinal outscored their opponents by a total of 17 goals.
Beach finally got on the board in the first period. Stan
ford added two more goals in the second before shutting
down the 49ers in the second half.
The large margins of victory gave some of the lesser
known Cardinal more playing time. Sophomore Ryan
Fortune displayed the depth of talent the team has in
store for the future, tallying four goals in two games.
"It's our job to come out and get the job done in the
beginning," Azevedo said. "If we can do that it helps to
set up the game where guys like Ryan and Marcello
| PantulianoJ. who are important aspects of our team, in
stead of them only getting a minute in the game, now
they get a whole quarter."
Added Taylor: "It definitely helps for the future;
they've been playing great all season. They might not
have gotten the time they deserve but every time they
come in they play hard, they play good defense and add
a couple goals on top of it."

playing against the guys he had grown up with his entire
life.
Somewhat disappointed in the turnout over the week
end. Stanford is hoping for larger crowds. Those who
missed Sunday's afternoon match also missed the chance
to greet and meet the Cardinal squad.
The Cardinal signed autographs for their younger
fans during the post-game picnic.
Next weekend's game against California should give
fans plenty of reason to come out though. After the reg
ular season comes to a close. Stanford will host the MPSF
tournament.
"I think our team really is coming along, and it's going
to he scary to see us in one month, in the MPSFs,"
Azevedo said. "I hope we can get the Stanford people
out to those games."
