# Queer students outraged over marriage bans

### JENNY ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The gay marriage bans that 11
states passed on Nov. 2 have left
many queer students searching for
the proverbial rainbow after the
storm.
Members of the queer communi
ty at Stanford expressed widespread
displeasure with both the marriage
bans and the outcome of the presi
dential election. Some worried that
the bans would affect them person
ally.
"The queer community at Stan
ford is outraged by America's bla
tant lack of respect for queer people
across the country," said freshman
Amber Baysinger. "This atrocity
sends out the message that many of
our country-mates, despite queer ac
tivism and LGBT rights movements
throughout the nation, still look
down upon the queer community as
immoral, wrong and inferior human
beings."
"I am appalled, saddened and
shocked that the amendments
passed in all 11 states," said fresh
men Ingrid Fox. "Even if it had
passed in one state it would have
been too much for me. It seems like
an unparalleled step backward in
American civil rights history."

"I know the ban will affect me,"
said sophomore Katherine Roubos.
"It will galvanize me and hope
fully the entire queer community to
up the political pressure, the visibili
ty events and the educational ef
forts. Change takes time and cease
less agitation. We have both."
"The bans don't only affect me as
a queer person, they affect every
one," Fox said. "They give homo
phobes the impression that they
have a right to discriminate."
"Many queer students are of an
age where they are coming to terms
with their sexual orientation," said
Dan Shih. a second-year law student
and co-president of OUTLAW, a
student organization that hosts so
cial gatherings for the Law School's
queer community. "The bans send
the message that gay and lesbian re
lationships are inferior to straight re
lationships. That is obviously not
good for the self-esteem of these stu
dents."
Baysinger said that the bans do
not reflect the opinions of Stanford
students but that queer students
would be hurt nonetheless.
"1 have found that much of the
Stanford student body readily ac
cepts and embraces its queer com
unity directly through the thoughts
and / or actions of the straight com
munity. However, students of the
queer community who wish to get
married in the near future or any
time in their lives will definitely be
hurt by the bans. Being queer is not
a choice; it is a way of life."
Senior Hannah Leslie, a leader of
the Queer / Straight Alliance, said
she does not believe there is a con
sensus among members of her
group, the queer community or
queer-allied students on how to
move forward in the wake of the
election.
According to Ben Davidson, the
director of the LGBT-CRC, the
bans were not the only source of stu
dent disillusionment.
"I've spoken with many students
who are extremely upset — hurt,
angry, dispirited — about the out
come of the elections," Davidson
said. "My sense was that the ap :
proval of same-sex marriage bans
played a role in that reaction,
though none of the students separat
ed their reactions to the specifically
anti-LGBT legislation from more
general concerns about the reelec
tion of the incumbent."
Alumni like George Duran, the
president of Stanford Pride, a group
that connects Stanford's queer
alumni, said students should edu
cate their friends, community and
elected officials regarding the issue
of gay marriage. Duran sits on the
board of the Bay Area Municipal
Elections Committee and said he
hopes to achieve progress for the
queer community by supporting
candidates that advance LGBT is
sues.
"We were convinced that the gay
marriage bans would pass in all but
one state, Oregon," he said. "Not
only did we lose, but we lost big.
This is obviously an issue that has
united social conservatives, the
same group that awarded George
Bush a second term in office. It's
going to be very difficult to make
any progress in this area during the

Hope tempers
frustration

next four years."
With Bush's re-election, there is
also renewed concern about the pos
sibility of a constitutional amend
ment ban on gay marriage.
"I was convinced that this issue
was dead in the water, used pri
marily by the Bush campaign to
energize their political base,"
Duran said. "But now, they have
even more support in the Senate
and in the House. Personally, I
think that the states will be left to
define marriage, and this effort
will not result in an amendment to
the U.S. Constitution."
Shih said that the ratification of a
national amendment ban would be a
blight to the U.S. Constitution for
decades.
"Because it takes a super-majori
ty of states to amend the Constitu
tion, such an amendment could not
be repealed until the last of the big
oted states agreed to its repeal," he
said. "Even if decades from now
most of the country wanted to grant
equal marriage rights, such an
amendment, depending on its word
ing. could ban all states from doing
so until the handful of holdout states
progress."
Despite the outcome of the elec
tion. many queer students said they
are hopeful that bans on gay mar
riage will not last.
"I think it is inevitable that same
sex marriage will become legal in the
United States," Fox said. "History
happens in cycles, there's no straight
line of progression or acceptance.
This is just another phase in the
cycle."
"I am definitely optimistic that
one day the American public will be
ready for gay marriage," Baysinger
said. "At one point in time nobody
thought blacks could ever be regard
ed as equal to whites, yet activist
groups persisted and racism in the
country is slowly being conquered. I
feel that the same thing can happen
to the queer community. I just hope
it doesn't take another hundred
years."
