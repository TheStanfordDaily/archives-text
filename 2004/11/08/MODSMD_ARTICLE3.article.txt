The gay marriage bans that 11
states passed on Nov. 2 have left
many queer students searching for
the proverbial rainbow after the
storm.
Members of the queer communi
ty at Stanford expressed widespread
displeasure with both the marriage
bans and the outcome of the presi
dential election. Some worried that
the bans would affect them person
ally.
"The queer community at Stan
ford is outraged by America's bla
tant lack of respect for queer people
across the country," said freshman
Amber Baysinger. "This atrocity
sends out the message that many of
our country-mates, despite queer ac
tivism and LGBT rights movements
throughout the nation, still look
down upon the queer community as
immoral, wrong and inferior human
beings."
"I am appalled, saddened and
shocked that the amendments
passed in all 11 states," said fresh
men Ingrid Fox. "Even if it had
passed in one state it would have
been too much for me. It seems like
an unparalleled step backward in
American civil rights history."

"I know the ban will affect me,"
said sophomore Katherine Roubos.
"It will galvanize me and hope
fully the entire queer community to
up the political pressure, the visibili
ty events and the educational ef
forts. Change takes time and cease
less agitation. We have both."
"The bans don't only affect me as
a queer person, they affect every
one," Fox said. "They give homo
phobes the impression that they
have a right to discriminate."
"Many queer students are of an
age where they are coming to terms
with their sexual orientation," said
Dan Shih. a second-year law student
and co-president of OUTLAW, a
student organization that hosts so
cial gatherings for the Law School's
queer community. "The bans send
the message that gay and lesbian re
lationships are inferior to straight re
lationships. That is obviously not
good for the self-esteem of these stu
dents."
Baysinger said that the bans do
not reflect the opinions of Stanford
students but that queer students
would be hurt nonetheless.
