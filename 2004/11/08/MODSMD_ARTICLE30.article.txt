# Emotional ride ends in defeat
## 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It may he putting it mildly to say that this has been an
up-and-down season for the Cardinal. From the high of
a big tirst-hall lead against USC to the low of a game
tying field goal falling just short against Oregon, Stan
lord has had to deal with the whole range of emotions.
The loss to Arizona State, though was a punch in the gut
that left Stanford reeling with its third consecutive loss.
In a game that featured a safety, two blocked punts, a
completed Hail Mary, nine turnovers and a last-second,
game-winning touchdown, it's not surprising that many
on the Cardinal squad are reeling from the experience.
"There were so many emotional ups and downs," said
senior receiver Cireg Camarillo. "You think you won it
and then it just drops."
Looking at just the statistics, it is incredible that Stan
ford was competitive in the game. Arizona State racked
up 583 yards, including 414 yards through the air by se
nior quarterback Andrew Walter.
()n the other hand, Stanford consistently struggled to
move the ball on offense, accumulating only 2K3 total
yards. Without injured starting tailback J R. Lemon, the
Stanford run game stalled again this weekend. The com
bination of backups Kenneth Tolon. David Marrero,
and Ray Jones picked up only 65 yards on the ground.
Hut Stanford was able to stay with the Sun Devils be
cause for the entire night almost all the breaks went
Stanford's way.

The two blocked punts allowed the struggling offense
to put the ball into the end zone. A 15-yard leaping
penalty negated a Michael Sgroi missed field goal at
tempt and led to a short Kenneth Tolon touchdown run.
"It was a weird game," said Stanford coach Buddy
Teevens. "We had two blocked punts; the offense just
wasn't in drive situations that often."
Of course, not all the breaks were in Stanford's favor.
One of the most pivotal moments in the game came on
an Andrew Walter Hail Mary pass on the last play of the
first half.
"There was some divine intervention involved in that
one," Walter said. "Just throw the ball up there and
hopefully it comes down in our favor."
Through the emotional ride that comes with a game
like Saturday's, the Cardinal hung tough and certainly
didn't give up.
"The team competed throughout the course of the
ballgame. They laid it all out there, but we'll recover,"
Teevens said.
The hardest pill for many Cardinal players to swallow
is the fact that they were in a position to upset a nation
ally ranked team with two minutes left to play and came
up short. A victory would have been Teevens' first
against a team with a winning record.
As a head coach Teevens has also struggled to win
games down the stretch. Over the past seven years,
Teevens' teams had gone 0-21 in the final three games of
their seasons, and Saturday's loss dropped that record to
0-22.
Understandably, the loss was tough emotionally for
many of the players to handle.
"I'm hurt, hurting pretty bad," said senior linebacker
Jon Alston. "I'm going to focus on the positive things.
We came out and showed up with a lot of guys that
hadn't showed up for us who showed up tonight. As a
team we fought and played with great courage and we
played with our hearts."
"It's the story of our lives," said Stanford nose tackle
Rabatunde Oshinowo. "We'll be outplaying a team, and
we'll do something, that's the story of our lives. We
never get beat, we always lose, just give it away."
Stanford still has an outside chance fora bowl and a
winning season, but that would mean a victory over a
Oregon State team that played USC very tough this
week, followed by a huge upset win against highly
ranked C'al.
Three of Stanford's five losses this season have come
by three points. While a loss is a loss, many Stanford
players still have the confidence that they can stay com
petitive against teams as good as Arizona State or USC.
"If everybody does their jobs, there are not a lot of peo
ple that can stop us," backup quarterback T.C. Ostrander
said, 'if we keep the mentality of doing what you need to
do and staying calm we're fine in tough situations."
Calling the Cardinal's situation at this point of the
season tough is an understatement. It will take a spec
tacular finish to the season to pull out a bowl berth. But
if the Cardinal can scrap and hang tough like they did
against Arizona State, there is a chance for another ex
citing finish.
