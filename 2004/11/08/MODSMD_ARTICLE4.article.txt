### LAURA CARWILE 
It has been 92 years since
Abdu'l-Baha, the son of the
founder of the Baha'i faith, spoke at
Stanford, but some students are still
celebrating.
In commemoration of Abdu'l-
Baha's 1912 visit to campus, the
Baha'i Association and the Hindu
Students Council put on their annual
event. Prayers for World Peace, in
Memorial Church on Saturday night.
The Daily Palo Alto, precursor
to The Stanford Daily, publicized
Abdu'l-Baha's appearance in an ar
ticle published on Oct. 7, 1912
under the headline, 'Venerable
Persian Will Talk Peace in Assem
bly Tomorrow.'
Staying true to the spirit of
Abdu'l-Baha's 1912 remarks at
Stanford, Saturday's event featured
students from all religious faiths on
campus coming together to speak,
sing and pray about attaining global
peace. The performers, surrounded
by candles, sat in a semi-circle on
the altar.
"Our goal is to bring religions on
campus together," said junior Leila
Ehsani, a leader in the Baha'i Asso
ciation who helped organize the
event. All religions have a lot in com
mon, especially the need for world
peace. We want religions to work to
gether to achieve this common goal."
Ehsani said she wishes there
were more interfaith events on
other college campuses and around
the world, because of her belief
that all religions are essentially
similar.

Senior Priyanka Bakaya, presi
dent of the Hindu Students Council,
helped co-sponsor the event.
"It's personally important for
me that we hold these kinds of
events," she said. "There is a lot in
common between Hinduism and
the Baha'i faith. Events like these
bring out what religions have in
common."
She said that the organizers de
signed the event to encourage peo
ple to practice their own faiths
while uniting with other religions to
work for peace.
Readings included one by the
Hindu Students Council in Sanskrit
and a translation of a specific text
by the Jewish Community.
Members of the Baha'i. Sikh and
Hindu communities performed reli
gious chants for the audience, and
Talisman performed three acappel
la songs that complemented the
readings. Representatives of other
Stanford religious groups, including
the Catholic Community, Islamic
Society, World Peace Buddhists
and Religious Society of Friends
also performed readings.
"We are celebrating many dif
ferent faiths tonight." Bayaka said.
"We're very happy that different
religions can come together and
help a cause that we all believe in."
Bayaka also commented on the
political relevance of the event.
"We need religious understand
ing." she said, especially in a time
with a great need for world peace.
"The message is just as applicable
today as it was when Abdu'l-Baha
spoke in 1912."
