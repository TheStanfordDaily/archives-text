1988 — On Nov. 3, 1988, The Daily
ran an article on a petition being cir
culated to invite Gorbachev to speak
at graduation.

"In an attempt to persuade the
University to ask Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev to be the 1986
commencement speaker, three
Roble resident assistants are circu
lating a petition among the senior
class to support the nomination.
So far. over 2(X) signatures have
been collected, according to Mark
Fleischauer, one of the three RAs
who started the petition.
There also seemed to be 'a good
deal of student interest at Pub Night,
one of the places where the petition
was passed around, said Steve
Smith, a senior class president.
Smith is also one of the two people
on the Commencement Panel,
which is responsible for making the
final recommendation for the com
mencement speaker.
In the petition, the three RAs
state their belief that 'a gesture of
this kind will display this Universi
ty's commitment to the peaceful co
existence of the United States and
the Soviet Union on all frontiers.'
Fleischauer said.
'Even though we don't know how
realistic it is that Gorbachev would
actually come, we believe that the
University should send a message
that it recognizes the possibility of
improved relations between the two
countries, and is willing to promote
them,' he added.

1940 — On Nov. X, 1940, The Daily
ran a story about Herbert Hoover,
Stanford class of 1895, coming to
speak on campus.

"Answering questions submitted
to him by students and members of
the faculty, Herbert Hoover, Stan
ford '95, will address an all-Universi
ty assembly this morning at nine o'-
clock in the Auditorium of the
Memorial Hall. Mr. Hoover's talk
will be strictly 'off the record.' There
will be no press reports.
The speech will cover public af
fairs. This is Mr. Hoover's second
talk of the year before a Stanford au
dience, his first being given last quar
ter.
The Auditorium will be opened
at nine o'clock, and the assembly will
convene promptly at 9:10 a.m. This
will allow those people with eight o'-
clock classes ample time to get to the
Auditorium before the doors are
closed.
The questions to be answered
were submitted yesterday afternoon
so as to avoid confusion at today's
assembly.
Mr. Hoover has just returned
from an extensive trip to the East
where he delivered several cam
paign speeches in support of the can
didacy of Wendell Willkie. Mr.
Hoover is the only living ex-Presi
dent of the United States."
