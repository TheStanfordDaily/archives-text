SIDES ON A
GEOMETRICALLY
SQUARED BASE.
It takes ingenuity, teamwork and a great deal of effort to pull off some of the high-profile
engineering projects being done in the United States Air Force. Engineers who come aboard
are immediately put on the fast track and have advancement opportunities typically not
found in the private sector. From weapons systems and space station materials to the next
generation of X-planes, whatever the project is, it's always fresh, always important and
always cutting edge. If this sounds like something you might be interested in, visit our Web
site at AIRFORCE.COM or call us at 1-800-423-USAF to request more information.
