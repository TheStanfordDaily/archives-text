Wednesday
12:00 noon-1:00PM
Enjoy lunch in the Round Room (behind MemChu),
followed by a discussion on how to walk the Labyrinth in the Church.
Does Life have YOU wandering aimlessly in circles? Embark on a personal journey
that's stood the test of time.
The Labyrinth allows walkers to release stress, to be quiet, and to focus internally. The
process is a lesson in slowing down, in being mentally still enough to hear and be
receptive to more than the jostling and jarring noises of everyday life.
Please RSVP for lunch to Elena Yujuico at elenay@stanford or 723-1762.
Questions, contact Joanne Sanders at joanne.sanders@stanford.edu.
Stanford faculty, staff and students only.
