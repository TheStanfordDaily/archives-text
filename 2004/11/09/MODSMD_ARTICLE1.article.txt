# ASSU set to fill four open Constitutional Council seats
## Four nominees face votes in Undergraduate Senate and Graduate Student Council 
### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night, members of the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate and
the Graduate Student Council in
terviewed four students, who
were nominated by an indepen
dent selection committee, to fill
the four vacancies on the ASSU
Constitutional Council.
The four openings on the
Council, which sophomore Sena
tor Chris Nguyen described as
"the Supreme Court of the
ASSU," were the result of a
shakeup in the governing body
last spring.
The ASSU Senate refused to
appoint a fifth member to the
Council in May. and after a series
of suits brought against the Sen
ate by then-junior Dylan Mef
ford. three other members of the
Council resigned for personal rea
sons.
As a result of last year's con
troversy, five members of this
year's ASSU Senate put together
the Constitutional Council Selec
tion Committee, a group indepen
dent of the Senate, to select and
nominate potential Council mem
bers.
The Committee consisted of
two undergraduates, juniors
Noriko Boyd and Francisco Cen
dejas. and two graduate students,
doctoral candidate in electrical
engineering John Davis and
School of Education masters stu
dent Roger Stanley.
The Committee received 12
applications from both under
graduate and graduate students.
Of those 12 applicants, the Com
mittee interviewed six and nomi
nated four to the ASSU Under
graduate Senate and Graduate
Student Council.

The four nominees — and like
ly new Council members — in
clude two undergraduates and
two graduate students. Justin Liu
and Monica Uddin, both sopho
mores, and first-year Graduate
School of Business student
Patrick Crosetto and first-year
Law School student Jenny Allen
would join Bill Curry, a doctoral
candidate in geophysics, on the
Council. Crosetto also received
his undergraduate degree from
Stanford in 2002.
Boyd and Davis, two of the
Committee members present at
last night's informal interview
session, explained the application
process and their criteria in
choosing the nominees.
"All the people were highly
qualified, so it was hard to whittle
|the candidates] down," Davis
said. "We tried to build a team

with varying backgrounds and
balanced viewpoints to fill out the
Council."
"We drilled down through the
qualifications based on interviews
and resumes and we tried to find
balanced perspectives," Davis
continued.
When asked what they felt the
role of the Council should be, the
four nominees had different opin
ions.
"1 think it's important that [the
Council] remain an independent
body within the ASSU," Allen
said. "1 believe it's important that
the Constitutional Council appeal
directly to the student body."
The other nominees disagreed
with Allen and thought the Coun
cil should not immerse itself di
rectly into the student body. Thev

did, however, agree that it should
remain independent of the ASSU
and make quick and resolute deci
sions regarding the interpretation
of the ASSU Constitution.
All four nominees agreed that it
was important to bear in mind
precedent Council decisions in new
cases.
"I am a firm believer in prece
dents, and 1 think we should pay at
tention to those when considering
current cases," Allen said.
All four nominees told the in
terviewers that they viewed mem

bership in the Council as a long
term commitment and that they
would work well together regard
less of age differences.
"1 will not be intimidated work
ing with graduate students," Liu
said. "I think we'll be able to work
together as equal colleagues."
Uddin agreed with her fellow
sophomore.
Both the ASSU Senate and the
Graduate Student Council must
now approve the four nominees.
Each nominee needs a two
thirds majority vote in each house

Confirmations of all
four nominees expected

to be officially accepted as a new
member of the Council.
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate will vote on the nominees
tonight at its weekly meeting, while
the Graduate Student Council will
vote tomorrow night.
Nguyen said that he is hopeful
that the nominees will be approved
quickly.
"I would expect the Senate to
reach a decision regarding the can
didates tonight and the GSC to
reach its decision on Wednesday at
its meeting," he said.

to be officially accepted as a new
member of the Council.
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate will vote on the nominees
tonight at its weekly meeting, while
the Graduate Student Council will
vote tomorrow night.
Nguyen said that he is hopeful
that the nominees will be approved
quickly.
"I would expect the Senate to
reach a decision regarding the can
didates tonight and the GSC to
reach its decision on Wednesday at
its meeting," he said.
Last night, members of the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate and
the Graduate Student Council in
terviewed four students, who
were nominated by an indepen
dent selection committee, to fill
the four vacancies on the ASSU
Constitutional Council.
The four openings on the
Council, which sophomore Sena
tor Chris Nguyen described as
"the Supreme Court of the
ASSU," were the result of a
shakeup in the governing body
last spring.
The ASSU Senate refused to
appoint a fifth member to the
Council in May. and after a series
of suits brought against the Sen
ate by then-junior Dylan Mef
ford. three other members of the
Council resigned for personal rea
sons.
As a result of last year's con
troversy, five members of this
year's ASSU Senate put together
the Constitutional Council Selec
tion Committee, a group indepen
dent of the Senate, to select and
nominate potential Council mem
bers.
The Committee consisted of
two undergraduates, juniors
Noriko Boyd and Francisco Cen
dejas. and two graduate students,
doctoral candidate in electrical
engineering John Davis and
School of Education masters stu
dent Roger Stanley.
The Committee received 12
applications from both under
graduate and graduate students.
Of those 12 applicants, the Com
mittee interviewed six and nomi
nated four to the ASSU Under
graduate Senate and Graduate
Student Council.

The four nominees — and like
ly new Council members — in
clude two undergraduates and
two graduate students. Justin Liu
and Monica Uddin, both sopho
mores, and first-year Graduate
School of Business student
Patrick Crosetto and first-year
Law School student Jenny Allen
would join Bill Curry, a doctoral
candidate in geophysics, on the
Council. Crosetto also received
his undergraduate degree from
Stanford in 2002.
Boyd and Davis, two of the
Committee members present at
last night's informal interview
session, explained the application
process and their criteria in
choosing the nominees.
"All the people were highly
qualified, so it was hard to whittle
|the candidates] down," Davis
said. "We tried to build a team

with varying backgrounds and
balanced viewpoints to fill out the
Council."
"We drilled down through the
qualifications based on interviews
and resumes and we tried to find
balanced perspectives," Davis
continued.
When asked what they felt the
role of the Council should be, the
four nominees had different opin
ions.
"1 think it's important that [the
Council] remain an independent
body within the ASSU," Allen
said. "1 believe it's important that
the Constitutional Council appeal
directly to the student body."
The other nominees disagreed
with Allen and thought the Coun
cil should not immerse itself di
rectly into the student body. Thev

did, however, agree that it should
remain independent of the ASSU
and make quick and resolute deci
sions regarding the interpretation
of the ASSU Constitution.
All four nominees agreed that it
was important to bear in mind
precedent Council decisions in new
cases.
"I am a firm believer in prece
dents, and 1 think we should pay at
tention to those when considering
current cases," Allen said.
All four nominees told the in
terviewers that they viewed mem

bership in the Council as a long
term commitment and that they
would work well together regard
less of age differences.
"1 will not be intimidated work
ing with graduate students," Liu
said. "I think we'll be able to work
together as equal colleagues."
Uddin agreed with her fellow
sophomore.
Both the ASSU Senate and the
Graduate Student Council must
now approve the four nominees.
