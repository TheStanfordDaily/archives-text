# ASSU set to fill four open Constitutional Council seats
## Four nominees face votes in Undergraduate Senate and Graduate Student Council 
### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night, members of the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate and
the Graduate Student Council in
terviewed four students, who
were nominated by an indepen
dent selection committee, to fill
the four vacancies on the ASSU
Constitutional Council.
The four openings on the
Council, which sophomore Sena
tor Chris Nguyen described as
"the Supreme Court of the
ASSU," were the result of a
shakeup in the governing body
last spring.
The ASSU Senate refused to
appoint a fifth member to the
Council in May. and after a series
of suits brought against the Sen
ate by then-junior Dylan Mef
ford. three other members of the
Council resigned for personal rea
sons.
As a result of last year's con
troversy, five members of this
year's ASSU Senate put together
the Constitutional Council Selec
tion Committee, a group indepen
dent of the Senate, to select and
nominate potential Council mem
bers.
The Committee consisted of
two undergraduates, juniors
Noriko Boyd and Francisco Cen
dejas. and two graduate students,
doctoral candidate in electrical
engineering John Davis and
School of Education masters stu
dent Roger Stanley.
The Committee received 12
applications from both under
graduate and graduate students.
Of those 12 applicants, the Com
mittee interviewed six and nomi
nated four to the ASSU Under
graduate Senate and Graduate
Student Council.

The four nominees — and like
ly new Council members — in
clude two undergraduates and
two graduate students. Justin Liu
and Monica Uddin, both sopho
mores, and first-year Graduate
School of Business student
Patrick Crosetto and first-year
Law School student Jenny Allen
would join Bill Curry, a doctoral
candidate in geophysics, on the
Council. Crosetto also received
his undergraduate degree from
Stanford in 2002.
Boyd and Davis, two of the
Committee members present at
last night's informal interview
session, explained the application
process and their criteria in
choosing the nominees.
"All the people were highly
qualified, so it was hard to whittle
|the candidates] down," Davis
said. "We tried to build a team

with varying backgrounds and
balanced viewpoints to fill out the
Council."
"We drilled down through the
qualifications based on interviews
and resumes and we tried to find
balanced perspectives," Davis
continued.
When asked what they felt the
role of the Council should be, the
four nominees had different opin
ions.
"1 think it's important that [the
Council] remain an independent
body within the ASSU," Allen
said. "1 believe it's important that
the Constitutional Council appeal
directly to the student body."
The other nominees disagreed
with Allen and thought the Coun
cil should not immerse itself di
rectly into the student body. Thev

Workers cut down several trees in front of Columbae yesterday.
The trees had become infected with Dutch Elm disease, necessi
tating their removal. In unrelated news, an apparent pin worm
scare has broken out at the co-op, leading to a rash of compul
sive handwashing.
