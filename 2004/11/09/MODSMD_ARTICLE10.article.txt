# Holt's Harangue
## The
						Democrats vs. the Decepticons 
### CHRIS HOLT 
I think a microcosm for this entire
election is what happened in Franklin
County, Ohio. In Franklin County,
due to a computer glitch. Bush re
ceived 3,893 more votes than he
should have.
Rather than saying this under
mines democracy and calls into ques
tion whether or not Bush actually won
the election, I think Franklin County
speaks volumes about the coalition
Bush has formed.
He has tapped into the previously
silenced computer / robot / cyborg /
droid community. Johnny-5, Sonny
the Robot and. of course, the Termi
nator himself have been staunch con
servatives all along who really brought
out the vote this year.
This is no more apparent than in
the Deep South. There, conservatives
like Megatron rally the evangelical
transforming robot population (called
the "Deceptions")— a major group
in Bush's camp.
This coalition of evil robots is uni
fied in their support of Bush and their
hatred of gay people — 11 states
voted to ban gay marriage and nine
states voted to ban civil unions.
The robots represent a good one
fifth of the voting population that is
unified in their belief that another 10
percent of the population doesn't de
serve civil rights.
Megatron vows to embody Bush's
advice to "reach out" to disappointed
Kerry voters —but with crushing
robotic arms and a plasma rille.
Oklahoma state senator "The
Robot," a member of the Moral Ma
jority and former star from TV's "Lost
In Space." proposed a bill passed by
voters making it a misdemeanor to
issue licenses to same-sex couples.
He warns of the dangers of Will
Robinson being touched by another
man. He has rallied to ensure that

same sex showers will he banned and it
will be a capital of fense to give a play
er a pat on the butt as he runs off the
field.
In conservative Utah, the senti
ments are largely the same.
Hal, from "2001: A Space
Odyssey" is now a devout member of
the Mormon Church and an outspo
ken critic of gay marriage. He tells re
porters that he believes "any other
sexual relations, including between
persons of the same gender, under
mine the divinely created institution of
family."
He adds, "I'm sorry Dave. I cannot
allow you to do that with another
man."
Bush's supporters nationwide em
body the robotic ideal of conformity.
Seventy-five percent of Bush sup
porters reportedly believe that Iraq
provided significant support to Al-
Oueda, with M percent of this group
believing there is direct evidence to
support their belief.
In addition, 74 percent believe
mistakenly — Bush favors including
environmental and labor agreements
in trade. Bush's supporters are united,
that's for sure, as they seem to be
"staying the course" on ignorance.
However, not all red-state robots
are so keen on Bush. Bush has had dif
ficulty reaching out to the gay robot
population — he only received 20 per
cent of the gay vote.
Said Montana resident C-3PO, "I
love R2 like any humanoid would love
another humanoid, and yet our cir
cuits cannot be melded together in the
ceremony of matrimony."
R2 agreed, "Beep boop."
After last week's election results, a
lot of people have been disappointed.
Some have even threatened to leave
the country, thinking that fleeing to
Canada would be better than spend
ing another four years under George
W. Bush.

In my opinion, this is a bad idea.
Things could be worse, and the Virgin
Islands are much better this time of
year.
In all seriousness, we need people
to stay. We need people to go to these
Southern states.
The 60s saw students go down to
the South and help with political
protests to further the civil rights
movement, a tough time in America's
history. The students were not wel
comed by a predominantly racist
white population — some were at
tacked. some were killed.
Progress was slow. I lowever, even
tually. thanks to leaders like Martin
Luther King. Jr. and a grassroots cam
paign for change — change did hap
pen. The same movement needs to
happen now.
Gay marriage is a civil rights issue
and it needs to be recognized as such.
Instead of white racists entrenched in
a system born out of slavery, we have a
homophobic population entrenched
in a near-robotic evangelical Christian
system of beliefs.
I do not propose religious conver
sion; 1 propose awareness and teach
ing of tolerance.
Tolerance is something that evan
gelicals lack, unless you consider their
belief that the rest of the United States
should tolerate their ignorance on
evolution, their continued homopho
bia or their purchasing of M-lhs for
"deer hunting."
It doesn't take a supercomputer to
figure out that the next four years will
be tough. I hope many of my allies
don't leave — the evangelicals are
tough foes, but in the end. possess only
"artificial intelligence."
