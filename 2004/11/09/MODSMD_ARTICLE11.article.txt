The struggle for gay rights will
outlast Bush
I am a queer Stanford student
from Minnesota. I was deeply disap
pointed that gay marriage bans
were passed in all 11 states.
Maybe I shouldn't have been
surprised, given that most were pre
sented in fairly conservative states,
but all 11? I feel like my country
doesn't want me.
All the same, I don't understand
why gay marriage has turned into
such a giant touchy taboo topic. I
mean, gay marriage is an attempt to
take a "radical" group of people
and give them the option of con
forming or integrating into societal
norms.

More conformity — that can't
he too scary, right?
Let's look at what issues a mar
riage —or even a civil union —
would alter. There are issues of
grievance leave, hospital visiting,
and ways of filing for taxes and
healthcare, etc. All of these poten
tial benefits are vitally important,
hut to personal lives only. If I got
married to a woman, the ladv down
the street from me isn't going to feel
any tangible effects.
People are concerned for the
sanctity of marriage. I hear that and
have two responses.
First of all. not so very long ago.
marriage was a strictly political and
economic act based on diplomatic
and financial needs.

All this moral etcetera is a recent
addition of church values to a state
function.
However, even given the reli
gious and social values of commit
ment. love and fidelity that mar
riage has come to symbolize, 1
don't understand how including
gay marriage would undermine
those values.
Moreover, today, when half of
heterosexual marriages end in di
vorce. we have a group of people
(who have been denounced regular
ly for their promiscuous ways) beg
ging to make life-long commitments
to each other. And somehow that's
seen as radical.
Do I think the ban will affect me?
Yes. I know it will — its a mindset

thing.
It will galvanize me and hopeful
ly the entire queer community to up
the political pressure, the visibility
events and the educational efforts.
I do think the American public
will be ready for gay marriage, hut
unfortunately rights aren't given —
they are won.
Giving women the right to vote
was seen as a radical change likely
to undo the underpinnings of
American democracy.
But 1 voted this year, and I don't
think any underpinnings were un
done. Neither does most of the
American public.
Change takes time and ceaseless
agitation. We have both, and some
dav we'll emerge into a world in

which banning two people who
want to commit their lives to each
other seems just as irrational and
unjust as denying women the right
to vote.
1 am very concerned about
Bush's anti-gay agenda. But I have
no illusions that his legislation will
be a permanent limitation to my
rights.
Four years can do a lot. but queer
people will be fighting for their
rights until they succeed, and that
movement will outlast any presi
dential term.
