# Sketch: Tales of Graduate Student Life
## Always looking on the bright side of life 
### 
Let me tell you about a happy,
special place. Where
thoughts are unfettered and
bountiful. Where ideas, not
petty scores, are currency. Where
birds sing and children play. A land of
milk and honey. Yes. welcome to
George Bush's America ... sorry,
that should be academia.
I may have gone a little far with the
whole milk and honey thing —
though it would be an interesting
change from Krispy Kreme at group
meetings. However, there is a vague
sense that universities are these cozy
places where people wander around
thinking.
In fact, tragic as it is, this is what 1
used to dream grad school would be
like — lots of thinking... and maybe
hot Califomian blondes.
Unfortunately, it appears that I
was misled. Not so much of the think
ing or the blondes. More like confu
sion. Lots and lots of confusion. Actu
ally, I think grad school has taught me
ways to be confused that I'd never
even thought of before.
Confusion is not so bad, though.
What's really troublesome is that
nothing seems to have changed.
Once I finished my undergraduate
degree 1 was convinced that it was the
end of problem sets and exams. That
finally 1 could start on the road to
•tweed-jacket-wearing, pipe-smoking
bliss.
I was wrong. Although we're not
living a life of leisurely contemplation,
it may be that I'm being a little unfair.
The worshipping at the grade-point
average alter is, after all, a faded and
ineffectual religion these days.
On the other hand, there are quals.
Ah, quals.
So, you arrive at grad school. You
immerse yourself in work, in the oft
repeated mantra that learning is more
important than results. Then quals,
also known as conips — as if reducing
to one syllable makes these things less
intimidating — hit you. And 1 really
do mean hit.
After weeks (or months) of being
told that grades are irrelevant,
you're suddenly presented with an
exam where failure means being
bludgeoned to death, figuratively
speaking.
The pass-or-die mentality may
seem a little strange to those not in
our private little world, but 1 think
I've figured it out.
Basically, those on the "outside"
see grad school as a slacker's option.
Yes. I know, it's terribly unfair, but
such is life. Thankfully quals provide a

neat counter-argument.
The hellish struggle (and sheer
pointlessness) of an exam that takes
over your life before you take it and
that no one cares about once you've
passed provides a handy rebuttal to
anyone who claims that grad students
are inveterate idlers.
A particular irritation of quals for
me is that they stir a sense of compet
itiveness. One of the main reasons I'm

in hiding from the
real world is that
being judged on
performance
tends to encour
age a sense of one
upmanship. And
I've always felt
that trying to be
better than other
people is awfully
uncouth.

As an undergraduate I was sur
rounded by overachievers. The kind
who can play 15 musical instruments
while juggling left-handed and caress
ing their latest conquest. I thought I
had left them behind, but it turns out
they're here to stay.
What's worse is that in academia
the probability of someone being bet
ter than you is that much higher. For
reasons that seem unfathomable, a
large number of "exceptional" people
embrace the idea of being underval
ued and underpaid.
As you have guessed, I'm not real
ly a fan of exceptional people. They ir
ritate me. Largely because I'm not
one myself. At the age of two I was
not busily computing zeros of the Rie
mann zeta function. I was chewing
household objects.
(Incidentally, if you don't know
what the Riemann zeta function is,
congratulations, you have a life. I sug
gest you enjoy it and stay well away
from grad school.)
Looking on the bright side, grad
life does have a couple of pluses.
Firstly, no matter how bad things
get, you can always reassure yourself
that you're here by choice — the real
world, a proper job and 2.4 kids are
yours for the taking. If you're not here
by choice, that's just too bad.
Finally, and for me at least the best
thing about being here is... well I'll let
you know when I think of something.

Let me tell you about a happy,
special place. Where
thoughts are unfettered and
bountiful. Where ideas, not
petty scores, are currency. Where
birds sing and children play. A land of
milk and honey. Yes. welcome to
George Bush's America ... sorry,
that should be academia.
I may have gone a little far with the
whole milk and honey thing —
though it would be an interesting
change from Krispy Kreme at group
meetings. However, there is a vague
sense that universities are these cozy
places where people wander around
thinking.
In fact, tragic as it is, this is what 1
used to dream grad school would be
like — lots of thinking... and maybe
hot Califomian blondes.
Unfortunately, it appears that I
was misled. Not so much of the think
ing or the blondes. More like confu
sion. Lots and lots of confusion. Actu
ally, I think grad school has taught me
ways to be confused that I'd never
even thought of before.
Confusion is not so bad, though.
What's really troublesome is that
nothing seems to have changed.
Once I finished my undergraduate
degree 1 was convinced that it was the
end of problem sets and exams. That
finally 1 could start on the road to
•tweed-jacket-wearing, pipe-smoking
bliss.
I was wrong. Although we're not
living a life of leisurely contemplation,
it may be that I'm being a little unfair.
The worshipping at the grade-point
average alter is, after all, a faded and
ineffectual religion these days.
On the other hand, there are quals.
Ah, quals.
So, you arrive at grad school. You
immerse yourself in work, in the oft
repeated mantra that learning is more
important than results. Then quals,
also known as conips — as if reducing
to one syllable makes these things less
intimidating — hit you. And 1 really
do mean hit.
After weeks (or months) of being
told that grades are irrelevant,
you're suddenly presented with an
exam where failure means being
bludgeoned to death, figuratively
speaking.
The pass-or-die mentality may
seem a little strange to those not in
our private little world, but 1 think
I've figured it out.
Basically, those on the "outside"
see grad school as a slacker's option.
Yes. I know, it's terribly unfair, but
such is life. Thankfully quals provide a

neat counter-argument.
The hellish struggle (and sheer
pointlessness) of an exam that takes
over your life before you take it and
that no one cares about once you've
passed provides a handy rebuttal to
anyone who claims that grad students
are inveterate idlers.
A particular irritation of quals for
me is that they stir a sense of compet
itiveness. One of the main reasons I'm

in hiding from the
real world is that
being judged on
performance
tends to encour
age a sense of one
upmanship. And
I've always felt
that trying to be
better than other
people is awfully
uncouth.
