## Swimmers pummel CSU-Bakersfield in season opener 
### SAMUEL CHEN 
The season kicked off for the No. 4 Stanford
men's swimming team and continued for the div
ing team this past weekend, with a resounding
home win by the Cardinal swim team and several
solid individual performances by Stanford divers.
The tirst dual meet of the 2004-05 season for
the men's swim team started Friday afternoon at
the Avery Aquatic Center. Sophomore Hongzhe
Sun took off on the opening leg of the 400-yard
medley relay. Senior Gary Marshall followed on
breastroke, with senior Matt McDonald on but
terfly and senior Jayme Cramer anchoring the
team with freestyle.
The result of the first event didn't disappoint
the Cardinal faithful, as Stanford decimated the
A and B medley teams of the visiting Cal State-
Bakersfield by 12 and 19 seconds, respectively.
From there, the Cardinal swimmers never
looked back, going on to crush the 2004 Division II
NCAA Champion Roadrunners 157-97.
Stanford's overwhelmingly strong showing
did not translate into Cardinal complacency.
"We swim against Cal State-Bakersfield every

year, and every year they are a welcome opponent."
Marshall said. "We are used to swimming most of
our meets against the standard Pac-10 field, so
meeting a talented team from another division is
very refreshing."
The Cardinal took the top three spots in four
more individual events and finished first in all 12
individual swims.
In the 1,000-yard free, freshman Noa Sakamo
to made his first competitive mark in the minds of
spectators and teammates alike, taking first place
with a time of nine minutes, 22.97 seconds. He
was followed by sophomore Shaun Phillips and
junior Michael McLean, who turned in times of
9:33.12 and 9:37.64, respectively.
The trio made a strong impression, sweeping
away the rest of the field, as McLean finished an
entire 25-yard lap ahead of the next competitor.
But Sakamoto's day wasn't over. He placed
third in the sweep of the 200-yard butterfly, fin
ishing behind Sun and Cramer. Sakamoto also
came in second behind Stanford junior Tobias
Oriwol in the 500-yard freestyle, with fellow
freshman Daniel Beal rounding out the top three.
All eclipsed the 4:40 mark and bettered any other

swimmer by more than 10 seconds.
In such a strong team effort, the individual per
formances of Sakamoto, Sun and sophomore Ben
Wildman-Tobriner dominated.
Sun placed first in both his individual events, the
100- and 200-yard butterfly, while sprinter Wild
man-Tobriner took the 50- and 100-yard freestyle
events back-to-back.
The showing made Wildman-Tobriner opti
mistic about the future of the team.
"Getting back into competition is always ex
citing, and the team only gets more motivated
with every successive meet," he said.
The focus among athletes and coaches this
weekend was on early-season competitions as an
opportunity for experience rather than winning.
"This meet has nothing to do with winning or
losing." said assistant swimming coach Ted Knapp
on Friday. "It's about getting race-ready. It's about
getting up there with a good attitude and racing
hard, and that's what you saw today."
While the swimmers enjoyed a home-pool ad
vantage. the Cardinal divers took a trip down to
