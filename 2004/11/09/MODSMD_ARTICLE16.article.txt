## Stanford women beat Southwest Missouri State to nab third at NorPac Tournament 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's field hockey
team proved that when it comes to the post
season, the regular season goes right out the
window.
After losing all of their conference
games during the regular season, the Cardi
nal (8-12, 0-6 Northern Pacific Athletic
Conference) finished third in the NorPac
conference tournament at Davidson Uni
versity.
Stanford knocked off No. 1 seed Rad
ford (9-10. 6-0 NorPac) in its first-round
matchup before falling to Pacific (9-9, 4-2
NorPac). The Cardinal finished third after
defeating Southwest Missouri State 1-0 in
the third-place game.
The Cardinal played their third matchup
against Pacific University this season. Stan
ford took the Tigers to double overtime for
their second consecutive overtime match
before falling 2-1.
The Cardinal took a 1-0 lead during the
first period on a goal from NorPac West
Rookie of the Year Jessica Zutz.
Stanford looked to be on its way to their
second upset win in a row until Laura Mau
rer scored with just over six minutes left in
regulation.
Pacific forward Jen Chaney scored the
game winner in the 88th minute.
Junior goalkeeper Ana Kralovec posted
a career high 11 saves despite the loss, while
the Cardinal outshot the Tigers in regula
tion 12-8 and won the penalty corner battle
8-6.
"We felt like this was the best game we
played all season, so it's obviously disap
pointing that we didn't come out with the
win," said Stanford head coach Lesley
Irvine. "But I'm still really proud of the way
we played. Everyone brought their 'A'
game."
The one-goal loss marked the ninth time
out of 12 that the Cardinal have fallen by
that margin.
With the victory. Pacific completed a
three-game series sweep of the Cardinal,
having won both regular season contests by
scores of 5-0 and 2-1.
The loss for Stanford marked the first
time the Cardinal had been defeated by an

opponent other than California in the Nor-
Pac tournament, as Stanford had previously
posted a 12-0 record against all other teams
at the event.
In their final game of the season, the Car
dinal took third place with a 1-0 win over
Southwest Missouri State.
With the win, Stanford extended its
streak of finishing at least third in seven
consecutive NorPac tournaments. Junior
midfielder Missy Halliday recorded the
only goal of the game, scoring unassisted in
the 24th minute.
The Cardinal had dropped their first two
contests against the SMS Bears in tough,
close games. The third-place victory provid-

Ed the Cardinal with redemption against the
Bears and a positive end to the season.
"I'm really proud of our team to play so
well, especially after yesterday's tough loss
to Pacific," Irvine said on Saturday. "We
played some of our best field hockey of the
season in this tournament. We're disap
pointed that we weren't able to win the
event and advance in the postseason, but it
was nice to play well here and end the sea
son with a victory today.
"The future looks bright for Stanford
field hockey."
Stanford will graduate only one senior,
Eleanor Morgan. Morgan has been selected
to play in the National Field Hockey Coach

es Association All-Star game, and will be
coached by Irvine, who was selected to
coach the South Team.
Next year, the Cardinal will return lead
ing scorers Zutz and Robinson as well as a
strong veteran core of players led by goal
keeper Ana Kralovec and defender Aska
Sturdevan.
With a young, talented team the Cardi
nal hope that their postseason success will
carry over into next season.
Having silenced the critics with their
strong showing in the NorPac tournament,
the Stanford women are eager to show that
they can be consistently successful, both in
the regular and postseason next year.

Bears and a positive end to the season.
"I'm really proud of our team to play so
well, especially after yesterday's tough loss
to Pacific," Irvine said on Saturday. "We
played some of our best field hockey of the
season in this tournament. We're disap
pointed that we weren't able to win the
event and advance in the postseason, but it
was nice to play well here and end the sea
son with a victory today.
"The future looks bright for Stanford
field hockey."
Stanford will graduate only one senior,
Eleanor Morgan. Morgan has been selected
to play in the National Field Hockey Coach

es Association All-Star game, and will be
coached by Irvine, who was selected to
coach the South Team.
Next year, the Cardinal will return lead
ing scorers Zutz and Robinson as well as a
strong veteran core of players led by goal
keeper Ana Kralovec and defender Aska
Sturdevan.
With a young, talented team the Cardi
nal hope that their postseason success will
carry over into next season.
Having silenced the critics with their
strong showing in the NorPac tournament,
the Stanford women are eager to show that
they can be consistently successful, both in
the regular and postseason next year.
