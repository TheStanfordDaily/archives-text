# Women’s diving 'sub-par’ at USC's Trojan Invite
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three meets in three weeks is tough
on the body and the mind. And the Stan
ford women's divers began to show the
strain this weekend at Southern Califor
nia's Trojan Invite, a diving-only compe
tition featuring athletes from USC, Stan
ford, and Hawaii, along with the Univer
sity of Nevada-Reno and Claremont
McKenna College.
Just as she was two weeks ago on her
home turf. Hawaii's QiongJie Huang was
in command of the pool this weekend. She
went home with two first-place finishes
and one third.
In a strong, though slightly frustrating
first day. Stanford senior Ashlee Rosen
thal was once again the top performer for
the Cardinal. She stayed close to Huang
throughout the three-meter springboard
competition, but could not quite wrest
first place from her.
Huang took first place with a score of

519.60, followed by Rosenthal with
511.00. The competition turned out to be
a duel between the two of them, as the
next highest finisher, Devon Owen of
UN-R. trailed Rosenthal by more than
40 points.
Four other Stanford divers — sopho
more Cassidy Krug. senior Erin Lashnits,
freshman Katie Lampe and junior Sara
Bowling — also traveled to Los Angeles
for the meet. After Rosenthal. Krug was
the next highest finisher for the Cardinal,
taking fourth, 25 points behind Owen.
Lashnits finished ninth and Lampe 11th
in the field of sixteen.
Though head coach Dr. Rick Schavone
was satisfied with Rosenthal's perfor
mance. he was not pleased with his team's
general output.
"Ashlee Rosenthal had a good meet
and everybody else was pretty sub-par,"
he said. "Erin Lashnits dove well but has
to step up and improve her list a little bit.


Sophomore Cassidy Krug took fourth at USC's Trojan
Invite last weekend.
She did a good job in one-meter, average
in three-meter. Katie Lampe is improv
ing but still isn't diving at a level compa
rable to what we need. Sara Bowling just
came back after an injury, so she didn't
do much."
Schavone was especially disappointed
by the usually dependable Krug. whose
fourth-place finish was much lower than
what she is accustomed to. In the past two
meets alone. Krug has collected a first, two
seconds and one third-place finish.
After a disheartening Friday, the
team saw more of the same on Saturday.
Huang repeated as champion, placing
first in the one-meter springboard with a
school-record of 613.20 points. She just
edged USC's Blythe Hartley, who fin
ished five one-hundredths of a point be
hind her. Rosenthal was again Stanford's
top finisher, ending the one-meter con
test in third and trailing Huang and Hart
ley by 70 points.
The rest of the Stanford team was un
able to shake their first-day blues and
found themselves struggling on Saturday.
Krug dropped slightly after her perfor
mance in the three-meter to finish fifth in
one-meter behind UN-R's Owen. Lash
nits matched her first day performance

Hawaii's Huang
dominates Held

with a ninth-place finish, and Lampe came
in 12th out of 17 participants.
No Stanford athletes competed in the
third event of the meet, the 10-meter
platform. Rui Wang of Hawaii won the
event, followed by USC's Lindsay Drap
er, with Huang taking third.
This was the last contest of the pre
season for the divers, who will now have
two straight months of training.
They will face Pacific in a non-confer
ence meet on Jan. 15 and start the Pac-10
season at Arizona State six days later.
After three straight weekends of
competition. Schavone is looking for
ward to returning to a normal schedule,
giving his divers a chance to rest, and
working to make improvements before
getting into the next round of meets.
Schavone believes that the team has
more talent than it has displayed so far,
and the training will be focused on bring
ing that into competition.
"My biggest fear was that we'd get out
of training rhythm by being at meets three
weeks in a row, and maybe we [did]. It'll
take me a while to figure it out."
Until January, according to
Schavone, he and his divers will focus on
one thing only: "Train, train, and train."
