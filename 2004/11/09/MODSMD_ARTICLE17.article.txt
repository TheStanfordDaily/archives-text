## 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three meets in three weeks is tough
on the body and the mind. And the Stan
ford women's divers began to show the
strain this weekend at Southern Califor
nia's Trojan Invite, a diving-only compe
tition featuring athletes from USC, Stan
ford, and Hawaii, along with the Univer
sity of Nevada-Reno and Claremont
McKenna College.
Just as she was two weeks ago on her
home turf. Hawaii's QiongJie Huang was
in command of the pool this weekend. She
went home with two first-place finishes
and one third.
In a strong, though slightly frustrating
first day. Stanford senior Ashlee Rosen
thal was once again the top performer for
the Cardinal. She stayed close to Huang
throughout the three-meter springboard
competition, but could not quite wrest
first place from her.
Huang took first place with a score of

519.60, followed by Rosenthal with
511.00. The competition turned out to be
a duel between the two of them, as the
next highest finisher, Devon Owen of
UN-R. trailed Rosenthal by more than
40 points.
Four other Stanford divers — sopho
more Cassidy Krug. senior Erin Lashnits,
freshman Katie Lampe and junior Sara
Bowling — also traveled to Los Angeles
for the meet. After Rosenthal. Krug was
the next highest finisher for the Cardinal,
taking fourth, 25 points behind Owen.
Lashnits finished ninth and Lampe 11th
in the field of sixteen.
Though head coach Dr. Rick Schavone
was satisfied with Rosenthal's perfor
mance. he was not pleased with his team's
general output.
"Ashlee Rosenthal had a good meet
and everybody else was pretty sub-par,"
he said. "Erin Lashnits dove well but has
to step up and improve her list a little bit.


Sophomore Cassidy Krug took fourth at USC's Trojan
Invite last weekend.
