## Double yoi! A terrible towel and victory for the Steelers 
### 
I woke up this morning and it seemed that
my Terrible Towel was glowing in the
morning sunshine. The hideous yellow
orange terry cloth hanging on my wall was
positively radiant. And I don't mean Terry

Bradshaw cloth, though he
might have had something
to do with the phe
nomenon.
You know those awful
Thunderstix that fair weath
er Angels' fans banged mer
cilessly during their fluke
World Series victory in
2002? And how about all
those fancy dishrags that

struggling teams give away as promotional in
centives for fans to show up? They all trace
their roots back to the Terrible Towel.
Myron Cope came up with the idea back in
the 70s when the Steelers were winning Super
Bowls and Chuck Noll paced the sidelines.
Myron is the radio voice of the Steelers.
though in his senility he has been relegated to
back-up color-commentator, and his com
ments are more colorful for their unintention
al humor than for their football insight.
Myron yells things like "Yoi!". and if the
situation calls for it. "Double Yoi!" He calls
the Ravens the "Brownies" and the Bengals
the "Bungles" and he couldn't pronounce
"Jaguars" in fewer than three syllables if his
life depended on it. He gets confused and ex
claims "Hmm-hah!" as if that explained ev
erything. He regularly misses the final three
minutes of the half because he is on his way to
the concession stand to get a hot dog and a
beer and smoke a cigarette.
And his voice! This is no Jack Buck. Harry
Caray, or Ernie Harwell. Listening to Myron
is not like being gently rocked to sleep by the
soothing lilt of Jon Miller. Imagine, instead,
that Alvin and the Chipmunks have emphyse
ma from smoking too much, and that they're
singing with guest star Bob Dylan, and that all
of them have been shrunken down and placed
into a tin can, and that you put the can next to
your ear and it starts saying things like "Hmm
hah! Roethler-Brangen is tearing apart the Ig
