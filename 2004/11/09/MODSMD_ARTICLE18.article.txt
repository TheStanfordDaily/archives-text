## Double yoi! A terrible towel and victory for the Steelers 
### 
I woke up this morning and it seemed that
my Terrible Towel was glowing in the
morning sunshine. The hideous yellow
orange terry cloth hanging on my wall was
positively radiant. And I don't mean Terry

Bradshaw cloth, though he
might have had something
to do with the phe
nomenon.
You know those awful
Thunderstix that fair weath
er Angels' fans banged mer
cilessly during their fluke
World Series victory in
2002? And how about all
those fancy dishrags that

struggling teams give away as promotional in
centives for fans to show up? They all trace
their roots back to the Terrible Towel.
Myron Cope came up with the idea back in
the 70s when the Steelers were winning Super
Bowls and Chuck Noll paced the sidelines.
Myron is the radio voice of the Steelers.
though in his senility he has been relegated to
back-up color-commentator, and his com
ments are more colorful for their unintention
al humor than for their football insight.
Myron yells things like "Yoi!". and if the
situation calls for it. "Double Yoi!" He calls
the Ravens the "Brownies" and the Bengals
the "Bungles" and he couldn't pronounce
"Jaguars" in fewer than three syllables if his
life depended on it. He gets confused and ex
claims "Hmm-hah!" as if that explained ev
erything. He regularly misses the final three
minutes of the half because he is on his way to
the concession stand to get a hot dog and a
beer and smoke a cigarette.
And his voice! This is no Jack Buck. Harry
Caray, or Ernie Harwell. Listening to Myron
is not like being gently rocked to sleep by the
soothing lilt of Jon Miller. Imagine, instead,
that Alvin and the Chipmunks have emphyse
ma from smoking too much, and that they're
singing with guest star Bob Dylan, and that all
of them have been shrunken down and placed
into a tin can, and that you put the can next to
your ear and it starts saying things like "Hmm
hah! Roethler-Brangen is tearing apart the Ig


Jordi Mata-Fink
gles! What a dee-bacle! Double Yoi!"
My friend Sammy, who used to call Stan
lord baseball for KZSIJ, always talked about
the dulcet tones of Mikey, his broadcast part
ner. Myron does not have dulcet tones. Myron
probably can't even pronounce "dulcet tones."
And yet. as a Pittsburgher, I love Myron
Cope. He comes up with brilliant marketing
ploys, like his weekly post-game tailgate.
Cope's Cabana, that kicks off with him
singing about the "hottest place fora Steelers
fan-a." And speaking of singing, Myron is
the genius who invented the Macarena-in
spired, "Yoi! Steelermania!" I'm still an
guished for not picking up a tape of that clas
sic hit when it was on the shelves.
And of course. Myron invented the Terri
ble Towel. The Terrible Towel is a piece of yel
low cloth that any self-respecting Western
Pennsylvania football fan keeps enshrined
until Sunday, when it comes out of its trophy
case and is waved 111 all of its splendid glory at

Ik in/ 112 ield, at home in front of the TV, or in
my case growing up. next to the radio speakers.
They sell for $7 a pop. but that doesn't
keep people from buying them. There wasn't
a more glorious sight than the sea of gold that
engulfed Texas Stadium, home of "Ameri
ca's I'cam." a few weeks ago when the Steel
ers came to visit. Except maybe the sight of
the scoreboards the past two weeks when the
Steelers knocked off the last two remaining
unbeaten teams in the NFL.
That is why my Terrible Towel was glowing
this morning. The mourning period officially
ended when Joey Porter and the Steel Curtain
(the sportswriters bring out that nickname
every time the defense plays well, regardless of
how it compares to the legends of the glory
years) knocked Tom Brady and the Patriots
silly. It was sweet redemption against the team
that brushed the Black and Gold aside in the
AFC championship game in 2(X)2.
You see, for those of us from Pittsburgh,

Steel Curtain has fallen

the forgotten city between Philadelphia and
('hicago. Terrible Towels are all we have left.
The Pirates have been rebuilding since Sid
Bream beat Barry Bonds' throw to the plate.
The Penguins are blessed with the Greatest
Hockey Player of All Time, but even Mario is
too old to save the team from mediocrity and
worse. Pitt hasn't seen glory since a local
schoolboy quarterback from Oakland
Catholic High School who wore number 13
passed his way into the record books.
We're halfway done with the NFL season,
and the Steelers are playing the best football
of anybody in the league. Things can easily
change. Just ask last year's Chiefs. But for
now I will bask in the glory of victory, and
take my Terrible Towel down off the wall and
give it a celebratory whirl every time Sports-
Center shows highlights.

the "Bungles" and he couldn't pronounce
"Jaguars" in fewer than three syllables if his
life depended on it. He gets confused and ex
claims "Hmm-hah!" as if that explained ev
erything. He regularly misses the final three
minutes of the half because he is on his way to
the concession stand to get a hot dog and a
beer and smoke a cigarette.
And his voice! This is no Jack Buck. Harry
Caray, or Ernie Harwell. Listening to Myron
is not like being gently rocked to sleep by the
soothing lilt of Jon Miller. Imagine, instead,
that Alvin and the Chipmunks have emphyse
ma from smoking too much, and that they're
singing with guest star Bob Dylan, and that all
of them have been shrunken down and placed
into a tin can, and that you put the can next to
your ear and it starts saying things like "Hmm

Jordi Mata-Fink
gles! What a dee-bacle! Double Yoi!"
My friend Sammy, who used to call Stan
lord baseball for KZSIJ, always talked about
the dulcet tones of Mikey, his broadcast part
ner. Myron does not have dulcet tones. Myron
probably can't even pronounce "dulcet tones."
And yet. as a Pittsburgher, I love Myron
Cope. He comes up with brilliant marketing
ploys, like his weekly post-game tailgate.
Cope's Cabana, that kicks off with him
singing about the "hottest place fora Steelers
fan-a." And speaking of singing, Myron is
the genius who invented the Macarena-in
spired, "Yoi! Steelermania!" I'm still an
guished for not picking up a tape of that clas
sic hit when it was on the shelves.
And of course. Myron invented the Terri
ble Towel. The Terrible Towel is a piece of yel
low cloth that any self-respecting Western
Pennsylvania football fan keeps enshrined
until Sunday, when it comes out of its trophy
case and is waved 111 all of its splendid glory at

Ik in/ 112 ield, at home in front of the TV, or in
my case growing up. next to the radio speakers.
They sell for $7 a pop. but that doesn't
keep people from buying them. There wasn't
a more glorious sight than the sea of gold that
engulfed Texas Stadium, home of "Ameri
ca's I'cam." a few weeks ago when the Steel
ers came to visit. Except maybe the sight of
the scoreboards the past two weeks when the
Steelers knocked off the last two remaining
unbeaten teams in the NFL.
That is why my Terrible Towel was glowing
this morning. The mourning period officially
ended when Joey Porter and the Steel Curtain
(the sportswriters bring out that nickname
every time the defense plays well, regardless of
how it compares to the legends of the glory
years) knocked Tom Brady and the Patriots
silly. It was sweet redemption against the team
that brushed the Black and Gold aside in the
AFC championship game in 2(X)2.
You see, for those of us from Pittsburgh,

Steel Curtain has fallen

the forgotten city between Philadelphia and
('hicago. Terrible Towels are all we have left.
The Pirates have been rebuilding since Sid
Bream beat Barry Bonds' throw to the plate.
The Penguins are blessed with the Greatest
Hockey Player of All Time, but even Mario is
too old to save the team from mediocrity and
worse. Pitt hasn't seen glory since a local
schoolboy quarterback from Oakland
Catholic High School who wore number 13
passed his way into the record books.
We're halfway done with the NFL season,
and the Steelers are playing the best football
of anybody in the league. Things can easily
change. Just ask last year's Chiefs. But for
now I will bask in the glory of victory, and
take my Terrible Towel down off the wall and
give it a celebratory whirl every time Sports-
Center shows highlights.

Jordi Mam-Fink is a .senior who sleeps with his
towel. E-mail him at jordimf@stanford.edu.
I woke up this morning and it seemed that
my Terrible Towel was glowing in the
morning sunshine. The hideous yellow
orange terry cloth hanging on my wall was
positively radiant. And I don't mean Terry

Bradshaw cloth, though he
might have had something
to do with the phe
nomenon.
You know those awful
Thunderstix that fair weath
er Angels' fans banged mer
cilessly during their fluke
World Series victory in
2002? And how about all
those fancy dishrags that

struggling teams give away as promotional in
centives for fans to show up? They all trace
their roots back to the Terrible Towel.
Myron Cope came up with the idea back in
the 70s when the Steelers were winning Super
Bowls and Chuck Noll paced the sidelines.
Myron is the radio voice of the Steelers.
though in his senility he has been relegated to
back-up color-commentator, and his com
ments are more colorful for their unintention
al humor than for their football insight.
Myron yells things like "Yoi!". and if the
situation calls for it. "Double Yoi!" He calls
the Ravens the "Brownies" and the Bengals
the "Bungles" and he couldn't pronounce
"Jaguars" in fewer than three syllables if his
life depended on it. He gets confused and ex
claims "Hmm-hah!" as if that explained ev
