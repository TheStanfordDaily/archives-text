# Soccer team earns 2004 NCAA Tournament berth
## 
### 
Yesterday afternoon, the NCAA
announced the bracket for the 2004
women's soccer tournament — and
for the seventh time in as many years,
the Stanford women made the cut.
The Cardinal (12-5-3,4-3-2 Pacific
-10 Conference) have now surged into
the postseason 14 times since 1990 —
the squad failed to appear only in 1997
— and own a 11-12-2 record in NCAA
Tournament play.
Stanford will head to Santa Clara
for first round of a four-team regional,
where they will face Big West confer
ence champion Cal Poly (11-2-6). The
Cardinal women have never dropped
a game to the Mustangs, and have in
fact eliminated Cal Poly from NCAA
Tournament play twice, in 1999 and
2002.
Host and 16th-seeded Santa Clara
(14-4-2) and California (11-5-3) will
play the other game of the first round
on Friday night, and the victor will

face the winner of the Stanford/Cal
Poly game.
The closest the Cardinal have
come to an NCAA title was in 1993,
when the team landed in the Final
Four. Stanford battled George Mason
to a 1-1 tie and after three overtime
periods, was defeated 3-1 on penalty
kicks.
In the Cardinal's most recent post
season bid, the squad was knocked off
1-0 by Santa Clara.
If Stanford can advance past the
second round, it will certainly en
counter some of the toughest compe
tition it has seen all season. Undefeat
ed North Carolina, Penn State and
Virginia are the top three seeds in the
Tournament overall and will likely
punch through the opening rounds.
The NCAA Tournament will con
clude with the College Cup Dec. 3-5 in
Cary, N.C.
