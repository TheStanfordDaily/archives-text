# Dems regroup, look to the future
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
More than 50 students gathered
in Tresidder Oak West last night for
the first post-election meeting of
the Stanford Democrats. Less than
a week had passed since Sen. John
Kerry was solidly defeated by Pres
ident George W. Bush, but the De
mocrats focused on the future,
brainstorming for upcoming activi
ties on the national and local levels.
"A lot more people voted for the
other guy," acknowledged Stanford
Democrats President Kai Stinch
combe. "But we're not going back
to business as usual, waiting three
and a half years, then saying 'Hey,
there's an election coming." and try
ing to bail out whoever is running."
Stinchcombe, a doctoral candi
date in political science, said he had
expected involvement to drop off
substantially following the election.

noting that he reserved the room
based on an estimate of only 25 at
tendees.
"My fear was that the election
would be demoralizing and de
pressing and deactivating." he said.
"Instead, it galvanized people."
He added. "The thing about the
campaign trail is that it's very clear
what needs to happen. At this stage,
it's not exactly clear what the next
step is. There's a higher level of
commitment that people need to
put in to figure out what the next
step is and I think that people defi
nitely rose to that task."
Senior Mattie Hutton, former
president of Stanford Students for
Kerry, echoed Stinchcombe's com
ments.
"After the loss, we felt disap
pointment and outrage," she said.
"It was more than just the presiden
tial election. The whole electoral
shift was disappointing on a visceral

level. But getting active is a little
more appealing than curling up in a
corner and muttering about tax
cuts."
At the meeting, the Democrats
divided into four smaller groups,
each with a different area of focus.
One group will work to connect stu
dents with the Democratic Party. A
second will concentrate on issue ad
vocacy. A third is developing plans
fora progressive think tank to
counter the Hoover Institution.
The final group discussed how to
get more Democrats involved in
campus and local politics, particu
larly the ASSU.
"Having been on Stanford's
campus fora while, I've seen the
good and bad side of the ASSU,"
said former ASSU presidential can
didate Mark Berghausen. a junior.
"I've always been interested in

local politics because it seems to be
the area where the individual can
make the biggest difference without
being involved in an established
power organization."
Stinchcombe said that the idea to
split the Stanford Democrats into
smaller groups came from consider
able thought about what the organi
zation should do after the election.

regardless of who won. He acknowl
edged it was a potentially risky
move, but argued that the Democ
rats are energetic enough to work on
a range of projects simultaneously.
"Much more dangerous is some
one who wants to get involved find
ing that the thing that is most impor
tant to them is not something that
we're doing," he said.

election season energy

Stinchcombe concluded. "I think
it's really important to tap into this
energy right away while people have
this immediacy. Everybody's think
ing, 'Oh my God.' In a couple of
weeks, complacency's going to start
to set in. People will say that the next
election is not for another four years
and they'll start worrying about sum
mer jobs."
