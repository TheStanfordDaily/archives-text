# Grades Don't Matter, Sources Say

Palo Alto, CA (AP) -
Documents obtained by the
Associated Press indicate
that grades achieved in post
graduate classes have no
effect on future prospects for
students enrolled in
academic institutions.
According to interviews with
several current and past
graduate students, "grades
don't count," said former
grad student and now
Billionaire Jerry Yang, co
founder of Yahoo! Inc. "1 got
mostly H's in grad school,
which at Stanford was really
really bad."

A poll conducted by the Los
Angeles Times showed that
over 85% of first year grads
believe getting high marks
"is worth the effort" and"a
valuable way to spend my
time". Fewer than 10% of
fifth year students felt the
same way.
In reality, neither employers
nor your parents appear to
care if you get an A or a Bin
your advanced Nonlinear
Optimization class. "I'm just
glad I don't have to pay for
tuition any more," said a
mother who wished to
remain anonymous.

Reaction among graduate
TA's was mixed, with some
expressing shock that their
late hours grading amount to
nothing, while others
showed visible relief that
losing a student's final exam
will not really ruin their life.
Sources close to academic
faculty reveal that this fact is
well known among
professors. "Of course
grades don't matter," said
Prof. Smith, "we only care
about the lab work." Grades
only serve to "feed the ego
of the smart students, and
break the spirit of the
mediocre ones.'
