# Tamir: Israel at political crossroads, hope remains
## Knesset member says traditional political lines blurring with Gaza Strip pullout 
### DAVID HERBERT DESK EDITOR 
Yuli Tamir, a member of the Is
raeli parliament, the Knesset, de
scribed the current Israeli political
situation as in flux and at a cross
roads in a speech last night spon
sored by the Stanford Israel Al
liance.
"Things happen so quickly [in
Israel]," she said to a crowd of
more than 70 people in the History
Corner. "I've been here a week and
I've changed this talk three times."
Tamir argued that Prime Minis
ter Ariel Sharon's decision to with
draw settlers from Palestinian ter
ritory was blurring the traditional
differences in Israeli politics. That
the conservative Sharon is now
pursuing a foreign policy typically
promoted by liberals has created
confusion within the Knesset and
Israeli society at large.
"I think no one would have
guessed that Ariel Sharon would
be standing in Parliament encour
aging settlement withdrawal," she
said. "The prime minister goes
against his own party and agrees
with us. What should we do?"
The breakdown of traditional
party lines and the imminent exit of
Yasser Arafat from Palestinian
politics has created a tremendous
opportunity for peace in the re
gion. Tamir argued.
"This could be very promising,
and maybe the American adminis
tration will wake up and help the
situation," she said.

Tamir pointed to a poll released
yesterday that showed Abu Mazen,
Arafat's likely successor, enjoying
40 percent support among Pales
tinians and argued that with a new
leader, a fresh start may be possi
ble. But she also warned that Israel
must understand that any new
Palestinian state will not be able to
prevent suicide bombings entirely.
"Terrorism will not disappear
when the conflict is done, but ter
ror will be reduced significantly,"
she said.
However, Tamir added that if
the Bush administration does not
commit to the peace process, the
opportunity will be lost.
"The bottom line is simple: no
one knows what's going to hap
pen," she said.
Regarding the domestic politi
cal climate in Israel. Tamir argued
that its volatility has left many Is
raelis uncertain about their politi
cal future, but that differences be
tween the left and right wings re
main. Though conservatives and
liberals are promoting the same
Palestinian policy as of late, social
issues are helping to draw contrasts
between political factions, she said.
She estimated that over two mil
lion Israelis live in poverty, a figure
that has risen sharply over the past
few years as a result of what she de
scribed as misguided, fiscally con
servative policies. The future of the
welfare state is "the real fight for
the next few years," she said.
Stanford Israel Alliance Co-
President Adi Jakubovits, a junior,
praised Tamir's speech as critical
and thought-provoking. The
group, along with the Israel Center
of San Francisco, sponsored
Tamir's visit.
"I personally thought it was a
fabulous event," she said. "She
presented some interesting points

about the internal conflict in Is
rael."
Others said they enjoyed an in
sider's account of recent political
developments in Israel.
"What 1 thought was interesting
is the way people used to vote in Is
rael — how to deal with the Arabs

— is changing," said junior Adam
Kapelner.
Junior Adam Isen, the other co
president of the Stanford Israel Al
liance. said the speech buoyed his
optimism.
"I am more hopeful about
prospects for peace now."
