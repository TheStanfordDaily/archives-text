1967 — On Nov. 9, The Daily ran
an article about a course, Health Ed
ucation 400, that came under scruti
ny when it was found that while it was
listed as a doctoral course, the major
ity of those taking it were undergrad
uates. Also, it was found that athletes
were being recommended to take the
class to raise their grade point aver
ages. Below is an excerpt:
"Health Education 400 is listed in
the Stanford Courses and Degrees
catalogue as individual Study in
Health Sciences.' It is one of six
graduate courses offered by the de
partment and can be taken for up to
16 units a quarter, more than the av
erage student's total academic load
per quarter at Stanford.
This past summer there were 16
students enrolled in Health Educa
tion 400. One of these, a football
player, took it for eight units from
his home in Los Angeles, mailing in
the required work. He received an
A-minus, one of eleven to receive an
A or A-minus.
The University rules for study in
absentia state that such work may
be done by 'graduate students.l
Donald H. Kauffman, assistant reg
istrar. said yesterday that only in the
rarest case could an undergraduate
study in absentia. Only graduate
and terminal graduate students reg
istered in absentia his summer, he
said.
In a regular University quarter,
spring of 1966, 25 students enrolled
in health Ed 400, 17 of them taking
between five and ten units Nineteen
were undergraduates.
When presented with these facts.
Richard W. Lyman, vice-president

and provost, said, if the situation is
as described it would constitute a se
rious and unfortunate situation."
1990 — On Nov. 9, The Daily ran
an article about the NCAA's filing of
an appeal to overturn a state
Supreme Court ruling exempting
Stanford athletes from being tested
for drugs. Below is an excerpt:
"The NCAA filed an appeal last
week to try to prevent its policy
from bring undermined by challeng
ing a Sept. 25 decision of the 6th Dis
trict Court of Appeal that held its
drug-testing program violated Cali
fornia's constitutional right to priva
cy.
The testing policy requires that
athletes urinate in front of an
NCAA monitor. In 1987, Stanford
diver Simone LeVant brought a
lawsuit against the NCAA, staying
the drug-testing policy was degrad
ing and a violation of her privacy
rights. The University and two other
student athlete later joined the suit.
Commenting on the NCAA's lat
est move in a three-year legal battle.
University Counsel Debra Zumwalt
said she doubts the state Supreme
Court will accept the appeal. If it
does, Stanford can expect to win the
case within one year, she added.
In its appeal, the NCAA asserts
that the lower court did not weigh
heavily enough the 'combined judg
ment' of NCAA member schools
that drug use by student athletes is a
serious problem. It also states that
without testing, athletes can have
'no assurance' that their competi
tors are not using drugs."
