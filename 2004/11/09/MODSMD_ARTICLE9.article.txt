## Editorial Put Internet fees on Univ. bill 
### 
The current billing procedure for student use
of in-room Internet services is a cumbersome
and outdated system that could benefit from
a simple solution. Instead of charging stu
dents for their online access on a monthly basis, In
ternet charges should he lumped with University
quarterly tuition cost.
Currently. Stanford students who have an in-room
Internet connection must pay $12 each month
through a paper-based ITSS Shared Services bill,
which also includes charges for televisions and land
line phones.
Given the large number of students who only sub
scribe to the in-room Internet connection, it would
make more sense to include Internet fees in the Uni
versity bill and only allow ITSS to charge students
who elect to subscribe to a phone line or cable televi
sion on a monthly basis.
Ninety-seven percent of the graduate and under
graduate students who live on campus have an active
in-room Internet connection, but the majority does
not have an additional phone line or a television.
As a result, many students end up with the annoy
ance of having to respond to a monthly paper bill for
a relatively insignificant amount of money.
II Internet services were included in the Universi
ty bill, students and ITSS would be saved the hassle of
missed payment deadlines.
And on an administrative level, making this
change would result in greater efficiency and less
waste.

ITSS would save time and money by reducing the
amount of paper bills that it sends out by mail. And
ResComp would be able to reduce the overhead costs
of monitoring whether or not students have an in
room connection.
Adding Internet fees to the University bill would
also assist students financially.
Recipients of financial aid would no longer have to
pay for their own Internet use â€” their aid award
could cover this cost, and the money saved could con
tribute to their expenses on textbooks.
In addition, the fact that educational expenses are
tax-deductible would provide another small benefit,
since tuition costs qualify as educational expenses but
stand-alone Internet bills do not.
For the small percentage of students who do not
choose to activate an in-room Internet connection,
the monthly $12 fee could still be justified hy the fact
that it contributes to the upkeep and management of
public computers elsewhere on campus.
In recent years there has been a rise in Internet and
cell-phone use on campus, and the need for land-line
phones has subsequently decreased. Given this trend,
the inclusion of Internet services alone in the Univer
sity bill seems to be the most reasonable reform of the
current hilling system.
Although ResComp and ITSS are currently work
ing on a joint proposal to include all telecommunica
tions fees on the University bill, they should first con
sider the simpler proposal of adding only the Internet
fees to I he bill.
