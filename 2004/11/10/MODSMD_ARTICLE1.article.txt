### WILL OREMUS CYNTHIA CHO MANAGING EDITORS 
A former manager of the Pulse
Copy Center in Tresidder Union
was arrested Monday on charges of
grand theft and is scheduled to be ar
raigned today at 1:30 at the Santa
Clara County Superior Courthouse
in Palo Alto.
Authorities believe Peter Trinca,
54, of Foster City, used "creative
billingi to systematically defraud
University departments and other
clients of about $ 1.5 million between
2000 and 2003.
Santa Clara County Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Dale Lohman said
most of the money went to the
Pulse's parent company. College
Enterprises, Inc., but that Trinca
personally received tens of thou
sands in bonuses and incentives
from College Enterprises as a result
of the revenue. Neither College En
terprises nor any of Trinca's co
workers are suspected of any wrong
doing, Lohman said.
Lohman said the crimes came to
light because "there had been a
number of complaints by various de
partments at Stanford claiming
they'd been overbilled. and other
employees at the copy center were
concerned." In September 2003,
around the time that Stanford
launched an internal audit, Trinca
resigned "under a cloud of suspi
cion," Lohman said.
Lohman described Stanford as
"very cooperative" in the investiga
tion.
Debra Zumwalt. the University's
general counsel, said in a statement
that Stanford learned of the ac
counting discrepancies in October
2003. Zumwalt said Stanford's audit
confirmed losses of more than $1.5
million, most of which came from
the Stanford Hospital and Clinics.
Stanford forwarded the case to its
Department of Public Safety, whose
investigations led to Trinca's arrest.
Trinca is charged with one felony
count of grand theft for obtaining
money through false representa
tions. Compounding the grand theft
charge is an "excessive taking" alle
gation, because the extent of the
theft was more than $1 million.
If convicted. Trinca could face up
to six years instate prison.
Trinca was scheduled to appear in
court for the first time yesterday but
for unknown reasons could not be
transported to the courthouse,
Lohman said.
