Daily rim a story on University Pres
ident Kenneth Pitzer refusing to can
cel school in light of student involve
ment in the Vietnam War protests
"President Kenneth Pitzer has
refused to cancel classes during
Moratorium demonstrations on
Thursday and Friday despite a stu
dent Senate resolution urging the
president to allow members of the
community 'to be free to be politi
cal.'
Reaffirming the stance he took
during the October Moratorium,
Pitzer said. For the University, as
an institution, to take an official po
sition on an issue of public policy
not directly related to the Universi
ty would infringe on the academic
freedom of those in the community
who might disagree with that posi
tion.'
In a statement released yester
day. Pitzer cited remarks he made
in support of last month's Moratori
um. and stated. I have seen nothing
since then to cause me to change
those opinions.'

To help figure out Just what to
tackle next. Soren has taken a one
year respite from MTV to partici

fellow, Soren takes classes —
minus the responsibilities of home

New York scene.' Not surprisingly,
Stanford feels entirely new."
