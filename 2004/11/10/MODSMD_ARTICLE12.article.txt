# Does this make me look fat?
## Fis for...

You know how you remem
ber everything about the
kid who traumatized you
in middle school? Mine
was Ryder Johansen. That is his real
name, and yes, I can hold a grudge
for nearly a decade. He was 13, chub
by, wanted to join the army, and had
one of those bowl haircuts that was
hot in the mid-90s grunge period.
Within days of the beginning of
seventh grade, he had labeled me a
"femi-nazi." Given the way we all
love to reduce individuals to one
word summaries, it stuck. For the
rest of middle school I was Femi-nazi
Friedman; the alliterative quality
made it quite catchy.

I got that
nickname
after I com
plained
when our
teacher
chose only
boys for the
advanced
math group
even
though I'd
scored high
er than
three of
them.
In all
honesty, my
breed of

feminism at that time may have bor
dered a little too closely on man-hat
ing. I was 13, a head and a half taller
than all the guys, holding on to my
baby fat with a fierce grip, had
braces and used words like "allitera
tive." Boys were not nice to me. I
had every reason to hate.
In the ensuing eight years, I
evolved. I became more flexible in
my feminism â€” realizing that it isn't
and has never been about female su
periority, but that it is an inclusive
movement that welcomes all friends
of justice. And I got my braces off.
In the spirit of inclusion, I have
tried not to preach just to the choir,
but to appeal to an audience not typ
ically targeted for feminist speech
(e.g.: frat boys). For those efforts. I
received an e-mail after my last arti
cle that said that "any real feminist
would be offended" by what I write.
So apparently I'm a Faux Feminist.
And we're back to the allitera
tions. Yay.
I was asked how I reconcile being
a feminist with having long hair and
wearing makeup. I never realized
that I had to.
I own more shoes than anyone I
know and most of them have at least
a three-inch heel (so I am still a head
and a half taller, but I've never been
into short boys anyway). I love shop
ping. I want children. When they are
young, I want to stay home with
them. I make awesome Swedish
Oatmeal Cookies. I giggle. I flirt.
And I am a feminist.
I am more comfortable with
power tools than I am with eyeliner.
I love football. I don't want a family
until I am secure in my career. I hate
cleaning. I revel in fast cars. I prefer
movies with Vin Diesel to those with
Meg Ryan.
And I am still a feminist.
Feminism is about choice, not
about appearance or interests. I can
fight just as hard for birth control to
be covered by health insurance in
heels as I can in combat boots. As
long as it is my choice to wear them,
it doesn't matter what they look like.
As a feminist, I would defend a
woman's choice to be a homemaker
as passionately as I would defend
her choice to be a CEO. As a femi
nist, I would defend a man's choice
to take paternity leave as passionate
ly as I would defend his choice to
work instead.
Now I'm putting my stilettoed
foot down. We, as true feminists,
need to take this word back from
those who have co-opted it to mean
something it never has. The F-word
isn't dirty. It doesn't mean man-hat
ing. It means a belief in equality and
a respect for individual choices. If
you believe that men and women
should have equal economic, politi
cal and social rights, then you are a
feminist. If you don't, I'll bet that's
because you have a small penis.
Hmm. maybe it's comments like
that that get me labeled as a femi
nazi. Oops.

It walks, it talks, it's a feminist. You can
