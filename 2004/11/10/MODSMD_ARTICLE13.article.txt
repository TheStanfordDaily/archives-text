# First in her class...
## EPATT graduate thrives at Stanford 
### JENNY BAER 
Since the fourth grade, Irene Guerra
dreamed of going to Stanford. While some of
her elementary school classmates took, in her
words, "wrong paths and ended up in juvenile
correction facilities," Guerra realized her
dream in September of 2003.
The sophomore said she credits her sup
portive family and East Palo Alto Tennis and
Tutoring — the Stanford-based after-school
program — for her acceptance into the Uni
versity.
Guerra is the first and only EPATT stu
dent to be accepted to and attend Stanford.
"All of the staff and my friends at EPATT
supported me throughout high school and al
ways believed that 1 would achieve great
things," Guerra said. "When I lost all confi
dence in my academics, they gave me that
extra push that motivated me to work hard
er."
When Guerra was in fourth grade, she en
rolled in EPATT because her mother wanted
her to participate in an after-school program.
EPATT, started in 1990 to teach tennis to
inner-city youth, has evolved to a joint tennis
and academic tutorial program that has won
awards for its tennis instruction. EPATT
moved to Stanford in 1997 and is based at the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium. It is run by
staff and around 100 volunteers, many of
them Stanford students. Participants in
EPATT must show financial need and have
parents who want to be involved with EPATT
events.
Christina Erwin. EPATT's high school
group coordinator, stresses that EPATT's
purpose is not solely college preparation, but
is to equip students with the tools to be suc
cessful in any path they choose. Erwin said
while many students want to go to four-year
colleges, some choose to join the military,
work and earn money before being able to af
ford college or go to trade school. However,
many students, like Guerra, have dreams of
attending Stanford.
"[Guerra's] acceptance was very signifi
cant to the other participants in the program,"
Erwin said. "It sent an encouraging message
that someone they saw as a role model, who
was from their neighborhood, and came
through this program could actually get into
Stanford University."
Growing up in East Palo Alto, Guerra says
that she never felt unsafe and was virtually un
aware of her neighborhood's dangerous repu
tation. She said she attributes the dangerous
perception to media hype.
Throughout elementary school, she walked
the two blocks to and from Cesar Chavez El
ementary School by herself. Guerra was
home alone much of the time because both
her parents had full time jobs — her mother is
a housekeeper in the affluent neighborhood

of Atherton and her father is a cook.
Guerra started EPATT in 1995 and was
placed with a tutor, Jessica Mockler, who was
then a freshman. Mockler, who graduated
from Stanford in 1998, tutored Guerra for all
four years. Spending time with Mockler con
vinced Guerra that she wanted to go to Stan
ford.
"She taught me to look for the good in peo
ple and to always set the highest standardstin

everything I do, no matter how small," Guer
ra said about her tutor. "She was the first per
son to tell me that I had the potential to be a
part of the Stanford community, and that was
as a fourth grader."
Mockler and Guerra still are in touch, and
Guerra said Mockler continues to have an im
pact on her life.

Guerra attributes EPATT, and in particu
lar the tennis training, to her academic suc
cess. Through an EPATT scholarship, she
was able to attend Pinewood, a private college
preparatory school in wealthy Los Altos Hills.
All of her friends from middle school had
gone to public schools, but her mother would
not let her refuse the prestigious Pinewood
scholarship.
"Even though I was hesitant to leave my

friends, it is the best decision I have made thus
far," Guerra said.
When Guerra entered Pinewood she began
to notice differences between herself and her
peers.
"Growing up I had everything I needed,"
Guerra said. "I didni't realize what I didnit
have until I went to high school."

Since her middle school had nol offered any
advanced classes, Guerra needed to attend
after-school classes at Pinewood to catch up.
Although she was valedictorian at her middle
school, Guerra said her first year in high
school was "horrible," because she was close
to the bottom of her class.
Socially, Guerra said she was unsure how
to fit in with Pinewood students. For example,
Guerra hadm't grown up with cable television,
so felt out of the loop in discussions about
most TV shows.
However, she received extra academic help
from EPATT and she excelled on the
Pinewood tennis team. Participation in the
tennis team was a requirement for Guerrais
scholarship, and by her sophomore year she
was playing on the varsity team. Also, once on
the varsity team, Guerra started making
friends with her teammate^.
"The best thing about EPATT is having
the opportunity to be exposed to so many
wonderful people outside of the East Palo
Alto bubble, whether it is through academics
or through tennis competitions," Guerra said.
Erwin said that EPATT and Pinewood
provided assistance to an already talented stu
dent.
"At school they provided college prep
classes and an opportunity to participate in
clubs and team sports," Erwin said. "At
EPATT we provided her scholarship, tutor
ing. tennis instruction, college counseling and
a supportive academic and social outlet."
"During her eight years in the program,
Irene proved that she had the drive and sup
port necessary to go on to college," Erwin
said.
When Guerra was accepted to Stanford,
she said she felt that there was some hostility
and jealousy from other Pinewood students,
who questioned how she got into such a pres
tigious university. Guerra also said her guid
ance school counselor, in response to her
Stanford acceptance, told her that she did not
always have to follow her dreams and empha
sized Santa Clara University as a better
choice. Guerra ignored the advice.
Guerra is majoring in comparative studies
major in race and ethnicity. She is involved in
Lambda Theta Nu sorority. Project Motiva
tion and the Latino 2006 Council. She said she
plans on getting a masters degree or a Ph.D. in
counseling psychology and would like to work
as a psychologist in a juvenile correctional fa
cility.
Although she is not currently involved in
EPATT. due to a heavy workload and a sug
gested one year break by EPATT staff, the
students are still on her mind.
"I am the only EPATT graduate to attend
Stanford," Guerra said. "But I know there
are many other students who will come after
me."
