## 
### BETSY CONGDON 
Sophomore Alex Padilla works 30 hours a
week as a waitress at Chili's restaurant to pay
for part of her tuition and have extra spending
money.
When junior Da Pan worked at a public re
lations firm last year, she put her wages to
ward sorority dues. Internet / phone bills and
other general expenses. The job was an exten
sion of her summer job.
Many Stanford students take jobs off-cam
pus during the school year in order to make
some extra cash or to gain experience in a
field that they might enter in the future.
This year, the student group Stanford Fi
nance founded a program that places students
in internships at major investment banks in
the area.
"The clear advantage is getting experience
at a big firm," said senior Mike Asmar, the
president of Stanford Finance. "That is the
first big step. It's not possible without some
help."
He said that the program is also designed
to mentor and prepare finance hopefuls for
life after college.
Off-campus jobs can offer other unique
opportunities to Stanford students. For exam
ple, sophomore Kristin Richards, a member
of the women's varsity volleyball team, is
planning on coaching a club team off campus
during winter and spring quarters.
Most off-campus jobs require more time
than the average on-campus job. Students
spend more time at work and getting to work.
Richards said she biked to the Abercrombie
and Fitch at the Stanford Shopping Center
when she worked there last year.
But jobs off campus are often hard to get
to without a car. Due to the extra hassle. Pan
advises students considering off-campus jobs
to only accept positions paying at least $10 an
hour. She pointed out thai many on-campus
jobs also pay well.
According to the Career Development

Center Web site, on-campus jobs tend to pay
well over minimum wage, are easy to get to
and often have student-friendly time sched
ules.
Students can take jobs on campus as part of
the Federal Work Study program, where the
government pays part of the student's salary
for working. Yet there are limits to this pro
gram. For example, students can't work more
than 15 hours a week, and there is a salary cap
set by the government.
The additional time that a job requires, es
pecially when it involves traveling off campus,
can take away from students' academics,
grades and social lives.
Padilla said she spent most of her time at
the beginning of the year at Chili's, in class or
doing homework. She has been working on
Friday and Saturday nights because those are
the most lucrative nights fora waitress. How
ever. she said that the job has not aversely af
fected her grades and that her life has been
more balanced of late.
Of her dual commitment to her job and to
her team. Richards said, "It definitely takes
time management. But I worked when I had
time."
In spite of the added hassle. Pan and Padil
la encouraged other students to find off-cam
pus jobs. Padilla said that her job has allowed
her to "burst the bubble" of the Stanford
campus every week, a sentiment that Pan
echoed.
"It is nice to meet people not from Stan
ford and to be around people who aren't your
own age," Pan said.
Both also thought that certain off-campus
jobs could be more lucrative than on campus
jobs, although Padilla also works a few hours
a week for the Stanford Instructional Teach
ing Network taping classes.
Padilla prefers her off-campus job because
she can control all of her wages, even when
she is putting them towards her tuition. She
said the money she earns as a waitress has
given her a sense of independence.
