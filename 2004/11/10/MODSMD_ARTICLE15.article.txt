## Editorial Training Table covered by donations 
### 
A news story that ran in The Daily ("Ath
letes enjoy special food at cafe," Oct. 28)
gave some people the impression that
athletes unfairly receive preferential din
ing treatment. As a result, many students have ex
pressed discontentment regarding the exclusivity
of these special dining options offered to athletes.
Such criticisms are misguided. The Training
Table program serves an important and justifiable
role in Stanford's athletic program.
Training Table gives certain athletes free buffet
style meals at Jimmy V's Sports Cafe at Arrillaga
Center. Private contributions to the Athletic De
partment cover the entire cost of the meals, which
are designed to meet the special dietary demands
and irregular time schedules of these athletes.
Only six teams participate in the Training Table
program: men's football and basketball, and women's
basketball, gymnastics, volleyball and tennis.
These athletes receive Training Table because of
the dietary needs of their sports. For example, foot
ball players often need protein to gain weight, and
gymnasts need a low-fat diet.
These athletes also have practice and game
schedules that conflict with the operating hours of
dining halls. Women's basketball practice, for ex
ample, ends at 7:15 p.m., after most food services
have closed. After practice, athletes also take time
to shower and change. Some must go to the training
room to ice injuries and deal with sprained muscles.
Dining halls in the past have accommodated ath
letes by providing them with late plates. Although
it is a nice gesture on the part of the dining halls,
these meals often don't provide enough food for
the athletes.
Furthermore, 91 of the 144 athletes who get
Training Table live in residences that do not offer
food, like Mirrielees.
For athletes who are on full scholarship, the
meal at the Arrillaga Center is subtracted from
their aid in accordance with NCAA regulations.
Contrary to the perception some readers got from
The Daily's news story, the meal is not a supple
ment; it is a substitute.
The only people with legitimate grounds to com

plain about preferential treatment for the athletes
that receive Training Table are the athletes who do
not receive it. Many of these students are subject to
the same demands; however, many of them are not
on full scholarship, and the cost of administering
Training Table for hundreds more partial-scholar
ship or walk-on athletes would be too great, accord
ing to Assistant Athletic Director Susan Burke.
Although Training Table pulls athletes away
from their dorms, the Athletic Department does its
best to integrate them into Stanford's community.
In the past Training Table has been at Stern Dining,
but due to logistics and the importance of proximi
ty, it has moved to Arrillaga.
In fact, Stanford probably has the most well-in
tegrated student-athletes in the PAC 10, if not the
country. At other schools, football players are
placed in dorms where they all live together starting
on the first day of school. However, Stanford
spreads freshman on the football team out to many
different freshman dorms.
For some athletes, this integration into the rest
of Stanford life is one of the reasons for choosing to
come to school here, and the Athletic Depart
ment's efforts to preserve that atmosphere are
commendable.
At a school that is lauded for its intellectuals,
faculty and students sometimes too readily con
clude that athletics detract from Stanford's academ
ic mission. According to Burk, some professors sus
pect that the Athletics Department pulls money
that could otherwise be funding their research.
However, the Athletic Department receives
funding from tuition only to cover physical educa
tion classes and the cost of administering the weight
room. The salaries of the coaches, the costs of ath
letic scholarships and Training Table are all cov
ered by ticket sales and private contributions. The
Athletic Department in no way interferes with
funding for academic departments.
Training Table is not so much a special perk as a
necessary component of being on a major athletic
team. No injustice is done to non-athletes, because
the meals are covered by the Athletic Department.

country. At other schools, football players are
placed in dorms where they all live together starting
on the first day of school. However, Stanford
spreads freshman on the football team out to many
different freshman dorms.
For some athletes, this integration into the rest
of Stanford life is one of the reasons for choosing to
come to school here, and the Athletic Depart
ment's efforts to preserve that atmosphere are
commendable.
At a school that is lauded for its intellectuals,
faculty and students sometimes too readily con
clude that athletics detract from Stanford's academ
ic mission. According to Burk, some professors sus
pect that the Athletics Department pulls money
that could otherwise be funding their research.
However, the Athletic Department receives
funding from tuition only to cover physical educa
tion classes and the cost of administering the weight
room. The salaries of the coaches, the costs of ath
letic scholarships and Training Table are all cov
ered by ticket sales and private contributions. The
Athletic Department in no way interferes with
funding for academic departments.
Training Table is not so much a special perk as a
necessary component of being on a major athletic
team. No injustice is done to non-athletes, because
the meals are covered by the Athletic Department.
