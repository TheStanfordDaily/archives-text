Hennessy asks for feedback on
labor issues
The Presidential Advisory Com
mittee on Workplace Policies re
cently submitted its report on work
place issues. I asked the committee
to study four core areas: policies re
garding temporary employees and
mechanisms to ensure compliance;
the possibility of adopting a living
wage requirement and policies gov
erning subcontractors; educational
opportunities for workers; and
mechanisms to ensure compliance
with the legal rights of both workers
and the University in connection
with union organization.
The committee's membership re
flected a broad representation of the
university community. They worked
diligently over the course of many
months and produced a well-docu
mented and very thoughtful report.
I am now considering the commit
tee's recommendations and will
make final decisions concerning the
report early in winter quarter.
Before i make those recommen
dations, however, I am hoping to
hear from a wider cross-section of
the Stanford community. I am writ
ing this letter to encourage members
of the student body — as well as fac
ulty and staff — to let me know what
they think about the committee's
findings and recommendations. The
report is available online at
http://workplacepolicies.stanford.c
du. Please send your comments by
e-mail to bv
Nov. 30.
These issues are extremely im
portant to the future of the people
who work very hard to maintain the
excellence of the University and
critical to Stanford's long-term abil
ity to carry out its mission.

Hoover op-ed had racist agenda
As a Mexican American student
here at Stanford. I was disappointed
to see that The Daily would print an
article that portrays Mexicans as ig
norant. poor and adding nothing to
society ("Immigration law should be
skills based," Nov. 8). The article's
blatantly racist agenda seemed to be
ignored because of the fact that it

was written by faculty.
1 wonder if the same article
would have been printed were it
written by a student. Edward Lazear
seems to rationalize his biased per
spective by masking it as an op-ed
on U.S. immigration policy. Based
on the content of the article, he
should have just called it "Why
Mexicans don't add anything and
should not be allowed into the Unit
ed States."
By taking one group and depict
ing them as the model of a bad mem
ber of society, he is only perpetuat
ing racism that already exists toward
the Mexican community in the Unit
ed States. The most disturbing part
of the article in my opinion is that
Lazear attributes problems with
Mexican immigrant assimilation to
the immigrants themselves.
They do not want to learn; they
cannot assimilate; etc. He ignores
the obvious fact that as a group,
Mexicans are victims of institution
alized racism. Therefore society
does not allow them to assimilate
into mainstream society as easily as
they might an immigrant from a Eu
ropean country.
He attributes problems to them
being let in rather than to how they are
treated once they are here. Lazear
could take a few lessons in the long
term effects of institutionalized
racism.
I would hope that in the future The
Daily would look at the content of ar
ticles they print and consider the larg
er effects rather than just printing an
article because it is stamped with the
approval of a faculty member.

Use of Spanish by U.S. slows
Mexican American assimilation
In regard to Prof. Edward
Lazear's findings on Mexican immi
grants. we are not helping Mexicans
to assimilate ("Immigration law
should be skills-based." Nov. 8). In
fact, we hinder assimilation by print
ing everything from phone bills to
bank deposit slips in English and
Spanish and by businesses answer
ing their phones in English and
Spanish.
My mother told me when she came
to America none of our family spoke

English, hut they figured out very
quickly that unless they learned En
glish, they would not survive. It is time
to stop these anti-assimilation policies
and bring everyone into the main
stream of English-speaking citizens.

Ram ho Mirage, ( A
Economy to blame for low wages
of Mexican Americans
Prof. Edward Lazear rehashes
historical assimilation arguments
("Immigration law should he skills
based," Nov. 8). He assumes that if
Mexican American immigrants
would more readily assimilate and
move to Billings instead of East Los
Angeles, they could magically in
crease their financial success.
(Billings per capita income:
$16,186).
As a son and grandson of former
Mexican American migrant field
workers, I deplore Lazear for blam
ing Mexican American communi
ties. I suggest instead that Lazear
should point his finger of blame on
an economy oozing low-wage jobs
(You know, the jobs Americans
don't want; they prefer the increas
ingly scarce high-wage jobs) as more
responsible for the depressed wages
of Mexican American immigrants
than ethnic communities.
For example. WalMart (Billings
has two) seeks to pay minimal
wages and benefits so that we can
buy toilet paper at bargain prices.
Agribusiness in California necessi
tates large numbers of hard-work
ing individuals willing to work long
hours in the heat and dirt. Even
Stanford utilizes low-wage Mexi
cans to set up tents for homecom
ing, lean buildings and serve meals
throughout campus.
Furthermore, I suggest that the
plight of immigrants from Mexico
and elsewhere is exacerbated by poli
cies that consistently shortchange the
children of these workers. These
workers are the foundation of our
economy, and their children should
have the same opportunity to attain
the American dream that the Italians,
Irish and Chinese immigrants that
came before them had.
