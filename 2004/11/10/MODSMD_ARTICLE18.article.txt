## Blame the messenger, not the party platform 
### 
The election is over and the
Democrats were soundly de
feated. Sen. John Kerry was
beaten, plain and simple.
Who cares that the margin was a
mere hundred-and-some thousand in
Ohio. Ten million more people voted
for George Bush this time than last
time. Voter fraud? Come on.
Pundits all across the country
claim that the future of the Demo
cratic Party is in doubt. Has the
country swung that far to the right?
Have the ideas of the Democrats
been radicalized by intellectual
elites on the coasts so much as to
put the party out of touch with
America?
In a word, no. The outcome of
this election had a lot less to do with
the message of the Democrats, and
a whole lot more to do with the mes
senger and an incoherent campaign.
President George W. Bush was
able to define the campaign issues
throughout. He steered it toward his
perceived strengths, leadership and
values, and away from the tradition
al issues of jobs, healthcare and the
economy.
He labeled Kerry as a tax-and
spend liberal from Massachusetts,
and that stuck. He labeled Kerry as
a flip-flopper, and that stuck. He
turned Kerry's patient and nuanced
view of the world against him, and
that stuck.
Are such charges true? Kerry's
record in the Senate on fiscal policy
is remarkably moderate fora
Democrat. He split with his party to
balance the budget in the 1980s.
Kerry has more than enough ex
perience in foreign policy, serving
on the foreign relations committee
for 20 years. Does anybody remem
ber that in 2000 Bush's weakness
was his inability to name — much
less pronounce — foreign leaders?
The flip-flopper charge, to an ex
tent, is true. Kerry did "vote for the
$87 billion before he voted against
it." But have we forgotten Bush's
flip-flops?
He was against the Department
of Homeland Security, then for it.
He was against the 9-11 Commis
sion, then for it. He was against na
tion building in the 2000 race, but
we are currently rebuilding two na
tions (although the argument can be
made that Bush is still against nation

building, as that would require hav
ing an actual plan).
The problem for Kerry is one
that was with him from day one of
the campaign: his inability to sell

himself to the
American public.
The exit polls
indicate that
moral values
played a large
role in this elec
tion. Let's com
pare Kerry (who
lost) to Bill Clin
ton (who won
twice and re
mains wildly pop-

ular) on moral values.
Abortion: same. Gun control:
same. Stem cells: same. Civil unions
for gays: same. Death penalty: al
most the same.
Kerry failed where Clinton suc
ceeded because Kerry was weaker
as a communicator.
Bush is a cowboy, and people
like that. Bush is the first president
to have an MBA. In the business
world, people make decisions with
out always knowing all the informa
tion because time is money. This
had not been the case in national
politics until this time around, and
people did not seem to mind.
In other words, the voters elect
ed the person who they thought
could be the most apt leader, not the
one who could articulate the most
adept policy.
The sad part is that Kerry is prob
ably the better leader of the two.
Every business that Bush ever start
ed either failed, was bought by his
father's rich friends before it failed,
or ended in an SEC investigation.
Kerry was leading a swift boat full of
people down murky Vietnamese
rivers while Bush was (or perhaps
wasn't) in the National Guard in the
combat-heavy areas of Texas and
Alabama.
Kerry has the qualities of leader
ship necessary to be president of the
United States. Unfortunately for
him and the country, he did not have
the qualities necessary to communi
cate that ability effectively to the
American people.

Abortion: same. Gun control:
same. Stem cells: same. Civil unions
for gays: same. Death penalty: al
most the same.
Kerry failed where Clinton suc
ceeded because Kerry was weaker
as a communicator.
Bush is a cowboy, and people
like that. Bush is the first president
to have an MBA. In the business
world, people make decisions with
out always knowing all the informa
tion because time is money. This
had not been the case in national
politics until this time around, and
people did not seem to mind.
In other words, the voters elect
ed the person who they thought
could be the most apt leader, not the
one who could articulate the most
adept policy.
The sad part is that Kerry is prob
ably the better leader of the two.
Every business that Bush ever start
ed either failed, was bought by his
father's rich friends before it failed,
or ended in an SEC investigation.
Kerry was leading a swift boat full of
people down murky Vietnamese
rivers while Bush was (or perhaps
wasn't) in the National Guard in the
combat-heavy areas of Texas and
Alabama.
Kerry has the qualities of leader
ship necessary to be president of the
United States. Unfortunately for
him and the country, he did not have
the qualities necessary to communi
cate that ability effectively to the
American people.
