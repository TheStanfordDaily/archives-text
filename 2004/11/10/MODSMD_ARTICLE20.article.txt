## Faculty member's attack on Mexican immigrants ignores economic realities 
### DAYNA MUNIZ 
I found Prof. Edward Lazear's
column ("Immigration law should be
skills based," Nov 8) to be incredibly
troubling. First, Lazear chooses to at
tack only Mexican immigrants.
But before we can call him a
racist, he tells us that "these difficul
ties are more a reflection of U.S. im
migration policy than they are of un
derlying cultural differences." With
this sentence, Lazear cleans his
hands of any anti-Mexican sentiment
the readers might have suspected.
Clearly, his argument must be ob
jective since it is not cultural defi
ciencies guiding "the plight of Mexi
can immigrants," which is by the way,
the title of the article in the online
version of The Daily.
However, if we read the article a
little further we see that it is not a de
sire for better jobs or higher incomes
that guides his writing, but rather a
desire to see all immigrants assimi
late into American society as quickly
as possible. For Lazear, Mexicans are
a problem because we just will not as
similate.
Lazear disregards the fact that
the type of jobs awaiting many
Mexicans are often ones in which
they need little English and in
which they mostly interact with

Spanish speakers. He chooses to
put the blame on Mexicans them
selves by saying we choose to live
in insular communities.
Last time I checked, a little
practice called red-lining often
forces us to live in these communi
ties. So, should we stop all Mexican
immigration?
No. If we did. many of us would
not be able to have produce at our ta
bles — according to the Department
of Labor. 77 percent of all farm
workers are Mexican — or for that
matter clean restrooms in many
Stanford facilities. Do you really
need a statistic for that?
It becomes quite apparent that to
Lazear the only skills that we should
value are those brought to the Unit
ed States by immigrants other than
Mexicans.
Furthermore, Lazear's claim that
"our policies do not employ the same
selection criteria for Mexicans as
they do for applicants from other
countries" is plain wrong. If he was
familiar at all with immigration law.
he would know that family-based im
migration for any nationality in
volves the same paperwork.
It is true that Mexicans make up a
larger percentage of applicants, but
this has nothing to do with preferen
tial treatment, it is solely a function

of the large number of Mexicans al
ready living in this country.
This is not only a result of immi
gration hut also of the historic pres
ence of legal / United-States-born
Mexicans in this country.
Furthermore, if immigration law
gives preferential treatment to any
body, it is to other immigrants. This
preferential treatment comes in the
form of the diversity lottery.
Each year, 55,000 visas are avail
able to people other than citizens of
Canada, Mexico, China, Colombia,
Dominican Republic, Haiti. India,
Jamaica. Pakistan, Philippines, Rus
sia, South Korea, United Kingdom
and Vietnam.
Stanford faculty should have
better judgment. Lazear's pointed
attack against Mexican immi
grants is completely uncalled for.
His call for "skills-based" immi
gration is really a call against Mex
ican immigrants whose hard work
Stanford stands on. Lazear should
not forget the people who clean his
office and make his food as well as
the many Mexican students at the
Business school that pay part of his
salary.
