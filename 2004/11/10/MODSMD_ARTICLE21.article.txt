## Sailing team lives up to high expectations at Fall Championship 
### STEPHEN DORSEY 
With high expectations looming, the Stanford
women's sailing team went into the Pacific Coast
Women's Fall Championship feeling nervous. But
Stanford prevailed with a convincing performance,
dominating eight other programs, as two of Stan
ford's teams took first- and second-place finishes
over the weekend.
The women's regatta was hosted by California in
Treasure Island. San Francisco. This past weekend
also featured the Jean Schenk Memorial Co-ed
Team Race Regatta at the Newport Yaught Club,
Calif.
The women's sailing team knew that it was the
squad to beat coming into the races. After placing
sixth in last year's PC Championship, where the team
was expected to finish in the top three, the sailors did
not want to fall short once again this year.
"I knew that we were supposed to win, so it was a
little nerve-wracking being out there in the water,
but I remembered to breathe and stay confident,"
said junior captain Liz Rountree.
Rountree's determination paid off after her team
faltered in one of the last of the 14 races. Rountree
and senior crew Julie Pitts lost their concentration
during the ninth race, but they refocused and won
their last two races to finish second in division A.

Stanford's team one was also comprised of senior
Ali Salatti and sophomore Caroline Young, who
sailed in division B; and freshmen Evan Brown and
Mariana Beardsworth saiJed in division A for team
two along with freshmen Carrie Denning and
Katherine Schlosser in division B.
Salatti and Young sailed an outstanding regatta,
dominating their competitors and winning by 12
points. Their performance cushioned Stanford's 20
point lead over UC-Irvine.
"The team really came through," said headcoach
Jay Kehoe. "They have been working hard since the
summer, never missing a workout or a practice. The
sailors pushed themselves and deserved the win."
Although the team was happy after winning the
Championship, the women spent their celebration
focusing on their mistakes and discussing what they
could've done better.
"We're ready to challenge the top teams during
the spring season," Rountree said.
The weekend also included the Jean Schenk
Memorial Co-ed Team Race Regatta. Although the
event was non-collegiate, it was filled with tough
competitors from former Collegiate All Americans,
Stanford sailing alums. Southern California high
school teams. USC and UC-lrvine.
The co-ed team only had one week of practice
going into a very tactical event that may have re

quired more practices, yet the the Cardinal were still
confident.
The regatta ended earlier than expected because
of lack of winds on Sunday, leaving four incomplete
races. The standings after the first eight races placed
Stanford fourth out of 12 teams.
Stanford sent two teams to the race: team one
consisted of seniors Peter Deming, Lucy Horton and
Jeff Allen, and sophomores Joanna Madsen, Emery
Wager and Becca Levin.
Andy Mesher, a senior, Chloe Pinkerton, alum
Jen Porter, Edward Conrad, junior Anna Vu and as
sistant coach Brent Harrill. sailed for team two.
The team race regatta was good experience for
the sailors and helped them to begin preparing for
the spring season.
"We understand we have a lot to work on and a
lot of needed practice to be ready for the team racing
season," Mesher said.
Next weekend's North / South Intersectional in
Santa Barbara, Calif, is the last regatta for the sailing
team before the off season.
Kehoe has been especially pleased with the
sailors' performances during the season thus far.
"This is the best team 1 have had in the last four
years," Kehoe said. "They are a great, fun unit —
well rounded in both school work and social life
along with sailing."
