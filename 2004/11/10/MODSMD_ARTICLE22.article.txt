## ESPN is dying with every new catchphrase 
### 
How the mighty have fallen. I remember
the days when my favorite show on TV
was Sports Center. when it was the icon
of what sports programming could be.
Back when Sports Center was less about
Sports Center and more about sports, the an
chors created a rapport based on funny nick
names and innovative highlight calls that
weren't drawn entirely from a blatant effort to
develop some kind of persona. Dan Patrick
and Keith Olbermann ran the show almost
every night, and they were a team worthy of
emulating.
But the newer anchors adopted the portion

of Olbermann's style that,
left unchecked, made the
show an intolerable monu
ment to the triviality of sports
culture — the catchphrase.
Instead of using quips ap
propriately, anchors use
highlights as a sort of soap
box to try out new riffs. More
often than not. this ends up
sounding like an uninformed
comedian talking sports with-

out even paying attention to the actual informa
tion at hand.
1 don't want to go all (former Daily colum
nist ) Bret Bechis on you here, but remember the
good times? Remember Charlie Steiner in the
"Follow me! Follow me to freedom!" Y2K eom
mercial, and how insightful and elear he was on
the show? Jon Stewart is right now performing
the job that most current Sports Center anchors
seem to want by turning news into "material."
He's there purely to entertain; the news itself is
secondary.
The phalanx of new guys (and Linda Cohn,
who is the lone beacon of righteousness in this
mountain of feces) that anchor the show now
are tasteless duplicates of one another. They are
essentially drones mandated to talk over the
highlights and suek up to athletes during the
inane "Hear/Say" games, where instead of see
ing more sports analysis, we learn that NBA
players (shockingly) cannot form even the most
basic word associations. Having graduated lrom
the Craig Kilborn School of— pause, dryly de
liver line, cue sly grin — Smug Comedy, a few
have gone above and beyond in terms of being
particularly irritating.
First on the list of grievances is Neil Everett,
he of the lisping insertion of irrelevant pop cul
ture references into highlights. A particularly
egregious example of this phenomenon occurs
when Neil asserts that, say. Manny Ramirez is to
the Boston Red Sox what lead singer Brandon
Boyd is to Incubus. It's referencing things for
the sake of referencing them. To steal Neil's om
nipresent analogy, he is to Sports Center what
Jason Newsted was to Metallica — the creepy
guy that nobody really likes and whom the
group is better off without in the long run.
Everett is kind of a B-level anchor, though,
and ESPN, shrewdly realizing that if he had to
carry the show viewers would commit mass sui
cide. usually teams him with a stronger partner.
The other B guy is Steve Berthiaume, who
seems to bust out the "Say hcll-o to my little
friend!" call for everything — home runs,
dunks, crushing blocks, particularly smooth golf
shots — and is comparably annoying. If Everett
and Berthiaume ever co-hosted a show. I think
my television would choose to spontaneously
combust rather than play it.
I also almost forgot to mention Scott Van
Pelt. He doesn't appear on the show often, but if
you need to jog your memory check the dictio
nary, where his picture appears next to the word
"smarmy."
Another bellwether to prove that the show
has jumped the shark is the fact that Stuart Scott


Dan McCarthy
is one of the senior anchors.
(iod. do I hate Stuart Scott. It's not
just the obviously contrived effort to
infuse some kind of urban edge into
the show ("Look! He's black! He says
things like 'Holla!' and 'Drop it like
it's hot!' He'll connect to our black
viewers!") — it's the fact that he ap
plies irrelevant phrases to plays and
uses them over... and over... and
over. His "Hater in da house!" call for
every interception makes me want to
tear his one good eye out with an ice
cream scoop, a la "Minority Report."
I also used to look forward to Chris
Herman's "Top Plays" segment, but
even he has gone downhill faster than

Fox Sports' only up-side:
no Stuart Scott. Holla!

the post-19 l W Fred Durst. His football
calls have become a cacophony of unin
telligible growling, and his once-fa
mous nicknames have deteriorated
from the likes of HeathclilfSlocumb'if
You Got 'Em" and Amani "It's Not A"
Toomer to Ruben "High" Sierra.
The lesson here is that despite the
fact that sports are already inextrica
bly tied to pop culture, we don't have
to make them a subcategory of pop
culture. The show that was once THE
source for sports news has now be
come part reality TV show ("Dream
Job"), part relentless suck-up ("The
Hot Seat"), and part game show
("Hear / Say.")

Sports arc good. Comedy is good.
They can work together, but this
doesn't mean they should be wanton
ly smashed into one. Sports Center is
still the place to turn for sports infor
mation. but in a way, that's just a bit
twisted.
In any case, the nightly Sports Va
riety Laugh Hour marches on, re
minding us that it's an ESPN world,
and we're just living in it.

Dan McCarthy is a junior who is
probably fantasizing about stabbing
John Anderson in the heart with a tri
dent right now. E-mail him at
