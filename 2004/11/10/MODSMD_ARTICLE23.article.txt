# Close calls in Pac-10
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Pacific-10 Conference had undoubtedly its most
exciting and competitive Saturday of the season, as its five
games were decided by one, two, three, eight and 10
points.
The difference in the Oregon-California tilt ended up
being a missed extra point after a first-quarter Oregon
touchdown. Arizona State defeated Stanford with nine
seconds remaining. UCLA could have tied Washington
State with just 0:42 remaining had it converted a two-point
try. Also, Arizona scored 14 unanswered second-half
points in a comeback win over Washington and Southern
California overcame a halftime deficit to defeat Oregon
State.
No. 1 Southern California 28, Oregon State 20
The Trojans trailed 13-7 at halftime in a fog-shrouded
game at Reser Stadium. Reggie Bush's 65-yard punt re
turn fora touchdown broke the game open for the de
fending national champions (9-0,6-0 Pac-10). giving them
a 21-13 lead early in the fourth quarter.
The Beavers (4-5, 3-3) built a 13-0 lead behind two
Alexis Serna field goals and a scoring pass from Derek
Anderson to Marcel Love, but stalled in the second half.
Bush had 88 rushing yards on 11 carries. His teammate,
LenDale White, ran 25 times for 120 yards and a touch
down to lead the USC offense. Matt Leinart threw for 205
yards, two touchdowns and one interception despite the
fog. Both scoring tosses went to Dominique Byrd, who
had seven receptions for 85 yards, both team-highs.
Dwight Wright ran for 75 yards on just 12 carries for the
Beavers, but Anderson completed only 22-of-51 passes
for 330 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions.
Mike Hass had eight catches for 119 yards to lead Oregon
State.
Ryan Killeen missed two field goal attempts for the
Trojans, but Byrd, Bush and the USC defense bailed him
out. Oregon State's first seven possessions of the second
half led to one fumble, two interceptions, three punts and
a turnover on downs.
No. 4 California 28, Oregon 27
The resurgent Ducks (5-4, 4-2) saw their four-game
winning streak come to an end at Memorial Stadium, but
not before they gave the Golden Bears (7-1, 5-1) their
toughest test since their loss to USC.
Oregon's Jared Siegel — far and away the best kicker
in the Pac-10 two years ago. when he made 20-of-24 field
goals, including a 59-yarder, was named AII-Pac-10 first
team and was a finalist for the Lou Groza award — missed
an extra-point attempt in the first period, ending his streak

of 115 consecutive PATs made. He shouldn't feel too, too
bad — his Cal counterpart, Tom Schneider, missed two
field goals.
Since each team scored four touchdowns, Siegel's miss
was critical. Perhaps not as critical, though, as Tim Day's
drop of a wide-open, fourth-down pass on the Ducks' last
drive. Had he caught the ball, the Ducks' drive would have
continued. Even if it stalled, Oregon still would've been in
range for Siegel to attempt a game-winning kick.
Oregon took a 20-14 lead in the first quarter, but did not
have many chances after that, thanks to Cal's offense,
which staged drawn-out drive after drawn-out drive. The
Ducks had a mere six possessions in the final three periods.
J.J. Arrington rushed 26 times for 193 yards and a
touchdown for Cal. while Aaron Rodgers was 21-of-32
passing for 275 yards, three touchdowns and no intercep
tions. His top target, Geoff Mac Arthur, caught eight balls
for 121 yards, including the go-ahead touchdown late in
the fourth quarter — the only time either team scored in
the second half.
For Oregon. Kellen Clemens was 19-of-33 passing for
218 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. Ter
rence Whitehead led the team with 91 yards rushing on 15
carries. And. his drop notwithstanding. Day had a nice
day, catching two scoring passes.
No. 23 Arizona State 34, Stanford 31
The Cardinal faced a 26-14 deficit at the start of the
fourth quarter, but went on a 17-0 rally to take a 31 -26 lead
with just 2:13 remaining. Unfortunately for the visitors,
the Sun Devils drove 80 yards in 13 plays to win the game
on Andrew Walter's 4-yard toss to Matt Miller with just
nine seconds remaining.
T.C. Ostrander threw a 67-yard touchdown pass deep
down the middle of the field for Alex Smith on the first
play of Stanford's final scoring drive, putting the Cardinal
ahead but leaving a few too many seconds on the clock.
Ostrander came in after starter Trent Edwards was
knocked out of the game by Jimmy Verdon on the first
play of the second half and was 8-of-15 passing for 161
yards, a touchdown and an interception.
Walter finished 28-of-42 passing for 415 yards, four
touchdowns and one interception for Arizona State (7-2,
4-2). which also got 186 rushing yards on 34 carries by con
verted wide receiver Rudy Burgess. Both Derek Hagan
and Terry Richardson topped 100 yards receiving.
For Stanford (4-5, 2-4), Smith led the way with five
catches for 112 yards and two touchdowns, setting a new
school record for career receptions by a tight end (104,
breaking Bob Moore's record of 100). Michael Sgroi made
a 47-yard field goal and Kenneth Tolon rushed 18 times
fora team-high 30 yards and a touchdown.

Sophomore receiver Mark Bradford and the Cardinal offense had an interesting evening against Arizona State Stan
ford's matchup wasn't the only tight game though, as two other conference tilts were decided by one or two points.
The two teams entered with just
23 combined turnovers, hut togeth
er they coughed up the hall nine
times in total on Saturday.
Udeme Udofia blocked not one
but two Arizona State punts, both
leading to first-half Stanford scores,
but Walter completed a 52-yard
Mail Mary over four Cardinal de
fenders to Miller on the last play of
the second quarter to give the Sun
Devils a 17-14 halftime lead.
Washington State 31, UCLA 29
The Bruins trailed 31-16 in the
third quarter after Jerome Harri
son scored his third touchdown of
the day for the visiting Cougars,
but Drew Olson rallied the Bruins
(5-4,3-3) to within two points with
scoring passes of 47 yards to Tab
Perry and four yards to Manuel
White, Jr.
1 lowever, Olson's two-point pass
fell incomplete with 42 seconds left,
and Washington State (4-5, 2-4)
snapped its four-game losing streak.
Harrison carried a school-record
42 times for 247 yards to lead the
Cougar charge, and backup Allen
Thompson found time to add 49

Last-minute two-point
pass fails, Bruins lose

yards on nine carries as UCLA's
weak run defense once again proved
to be its demise.
Alex Brink was 17-of-27 passing
for 165 yards, a touchdown and no
interceptions for the Cougars. Jason
Hill caught four passes for 9K yards
and a touchdown that put Washing
ton State up, 21-7, in the second
quarter.
For UCLA, Justin Medlock
kicked field goals of 27, 47 and 47
yards and Olson was 18-of-38 for
201 yards, two touchdowns and an
interception.
However, White gained just 49
yards on 13 carries and team rushing
leader Maurice Drew carried only
one time, suffering an ankle injury
in the first half.
Arizona 23, Washington 13
The Wildcats (2-7. 1-5) won for
the first time since Sept. 4. while the
Huskies let a 13-9 halftime lead slip
away in Tucson. Cornerback Wilrey
Fontenot returned a fumble 33
yards for the go-ahead touchdown
and Mike Bell rushed for two scores
of his own as Mike Stoops earned his
first Pac-10 victory.

The Huskies (1-8,0-6), who lead
the nation in turnovers, coughed up
the hall four times in the second half
and lost their fourth straight. With
only Cal and Washington State re
maining on their schedule, the
Huskies could end the year without
a single conference win.
Arizona took a 9-0 lead after a
Bell touchdown run and a punt
block fora safety, but Shelton
Sampson rushed fora 5-yard score
and Evan Knudson kicked 43- and
34-yard field goals to put Washing
ton on top at the half.
Bell rushed 24 times for 88 yards
for Arizona, while freshman
Richard Kovalcheck was 11-of-25
passing for 164 conservative yards.
Washington's Casey Paus was
just 13-of-37 for 164 yards and an in
terception, and his replacement,
Isaiah Stanback. went 3-of-10 for 33
yards and an interception. Kenny
James led the team with 68 rushing
yards on 19 carries.

not before they gave the Golden Bears (7-1, 5-1) their
toughest test since their loss to USC.
Oregon's Jared Siegel — far and away the best kicker
in the Pac-10 two years ago. when he made 20-of-24 field
goals, including a 59-yarder, was named AII-Pac-10 first
team and was a finalist for the Lou Groza award — missed
an extra-point attempt in the first period, ending his streak

of 115 consecutive PATs made. He shouldn't feel too, too
bad — his Cal counterpart, Tom Schneider, missed two
field goals.
Since each team scored four touchdowns, Siegel's miss
was critical. Perhaps not as critical, though, as Tim Day's
drop of a wide-open, fourth-down pass on the Ducks' last
drive. Had he caught the ball, the Ducks' drive would have
continued. Even if it stalled, Oregon still would've been in
range for Siegel to attempt a game-winning kick.
Oregon took a 20-14 lead in the first quarter, but did not
have many chances after that, thanks to Cal's offense,
which staged drawn-out drive after drawn-out drive. The
Ducks had a mere six possessions in the final three periods.
J.J. Arrington rushed 26 times for 193 yards and a
touchdown for Cal. while Aaron Rodgers was 21-of-32
passing for 275 yards, three touchdowns and no intercep
tions. His top target, Geoff Mac Arthur, caught eight balls
for 121 yards, including the go-ahead touchdown late in
the fourth quarter — the only time either team scored in
the second half.
For Oregon. Kellen Clemens was 19-of-33 passing for
218 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. Ter
rence Whitehead led the team with 91 yards rushing on 15
carries. And. his drop notwithstanding. Day had a nice
day, catching two scoring passes.
No. 23 Arizona State 34, Stanford 31
The Cardinal faced a 26-14 deficit at the start of the
fourth quarter, but went on a 17-0 rally to take a 31 -26 lead
with just 2:13 remaining. Unfortunately for the visitors,
the Sun Devils drove 80 yards in 13 plays to win the game
on Andrew Walter's 4-yard toss to Matt Miller with just
nine seconds remaining.
T.C. Ostrander threw a 67-yard touchdown pass deep
down the middle of the field for Alex Smith on the first
play of Stanford's final scoring drive, putting the Cardinal
ahead but leaving a few too many seconds on the clock.
Ostrander came in after starter Trent Edwards was
knocked out of the game by Jimmy Verdon on the first
play of the second half and was 8-of-15 passing for 161
yards, a touchdown and an interception.
Walter finished 28-of-42 passing for 415 yards, four
touchdowns and one interception for Arizona State (7-2,
4-2). which also got 186 rushing yards on 34 carries by con
verted wide receiver Rudy Burgess. Both Derek Hagan
and Terry Richardson topped 100 yards receiving.
For Stanford (4-5, 2-4), Smith led the way with five
catches for 112 yards and two touchdowns, setting a new
school record for career receptions by a tight end (104,
breaking Bob Moore's record of 100). Michael Sgroi made
a 47-yard field goal and Kenneth Tolon rushed 18 times
fora team-high 30 yards and a touchdown.

Sophomore receiver Mark Bradford and the Cardinal offense had an interesting evening against Arizona State Stan
ford's matchup wasn't the only tight game though, as two other conference tilts were decided by one or two points.
The two teams entered with just
23 combined turnovers, hut togeth
er they coughed up the hall nine
times in total on Saturday.
Udeme Udofia blocked not one
but two Arizona State punts, both
leading to first-half Stanford scores,
but Walter completed a 52-yard
Mail Mary over four Cardinal de
fenders to Miller on the last play of
the second quarter to give the Sun
Devils a 17-14 halftime lead.
Washington State 31, UCLA 29
The Bruins trailed 31-16 in the
third quarter after Jerome Harri
son scored his third touchdown of
the day for the visiting Cougars,
but Drew Olson rallied the Bruins
(5-4,3-3) to within two points with
scoring passes of 47 yards to Tab
Perry and four yards to Manuel
White, Jr.
1 lowever, Olson's two-point pass
fell incomplete with 42 seconds left,
and Washington State (4-5, 2-4)
snapped its four-game losing streak.
Harrison carried a school-record
42 times for 247 yards to lead the
Cougar charge, and backup Allen
Thompson found time to add 49

Last-minute two-point
pass fails, Bruins lose

yards on nine carries as UCLA's
weak run defense once again proved

Alex Brink was 17-of-27 passing

interceptions for the Cougars. Jason
Hill caught four passes for 9K yards
and a touchdown that put Washing

quarter.
For UCLA, Justin Medlock
kicked field goals of 27, 47 and 47
yards and Olson was 18-of-38 for
201 yards, two touchdowns and an

However, White gained just 49
yards on 13 carries and team rushing
leader Maurice Drew carried only
one time, suffering an ankle injury
in the first half.
Arizona 23, Washington 13
The Wildcats (2-7. 1-5) won for
the first time since Sept. 4. while the
Huskies let a 13-9 halftime lead slip
away in Tucson. Cornerback Wilrey
Fontenot returned a fumble 33
yards for the go-ahead touchdown
and Mike Bell rushed for two scores
of his own as Mike Stoops earned his
first Pac-10 victory.

The Huskies (1-8,0-6), who lead
the nation in turnovers, coughed up
the hall four times in the second half
and lost their fourth straight. With
only Cal and Washington State re
maining on their schedule, the
Huskies could end the year without
a single conference win.
Arizona took a 9-0 lead after a
Bell touchdown run and a punt
block fora safety, but Shelton
Sampson rushed fora 5-yard score
and Evan Knudson kicked 43- and
34-yard field goals to put Washing

Saturday: Arizona @ No. 1 USC,

UCLA @ Oregon, Oregon State @
Stanford.
The Pacific-10 Conference had undoubtedly its most
exciting and competitive Saturday of the season, as its five
games were decided by one, two, three, eight and 10
points.
The difference in the Oregon-California tilt ended up
being a missed extra point after a first-quarter Oregon
touchdown. Arizona State defeated Stanford with nine
seconds remaining. UCLA could have tied Washington
State with just 0:42 remaining had it converted a two-point
try. Also, Arizona scored 14 unanswered second-half
points in a comeback win over Washington and Southern
California overcame a halftime deficit to defeat Oregon
State.
No. 1 Southern California 28, Oregon State 20
The Trojans trailed 13-7 at halftime in a fog-shrouded
game at Reser Stadium. Reggie Bush's 65-yard punt re
turn fora touchdown broke the game open for the de
fending national champions (9-0,6-0 Pac-10). giving them
a 21-13 lead early in the fourth quarter.
The Beavers (4-5, 3-3) built a 13-0 lead behind two
Alexis Serna field goals and a scoring pass from Derek
Anderson to Marcel Love, but stalled in the second half.
Bush had 88 rushing yards on 11 carries. His teammate,
LenDale White, ran 25 times for 120 yards and a touch
down to lead the USC offense. Matt Leinart threw for 205
yards, two touchdowns and one interception despite the
fog. Both scoring tosses went to Dominique Byrd, who
had seven receptions for 85 yards, both team-highs.
Dwight Wright ran for 75 yards on just 12 carries for the
Beavers, but Anderson completed only 22-of-51 passes
for 330 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions.
Mike Hass had eight catches for 119 yards to lead Oregon
State.
Ryan Killeen missed two field goal attempts for the
Trojans, but Byrd, Bush and the USC defense bailed him
out. Oregon State's first seven possessions of the second
half led to one fumble, two interceptions, three punts and
a turnover on downs.

the Sun Devils drove 80 yards in 13 plays to win the game
on Andrew Walter's 4-yard toss to Matt Miller with just
nine seconds remaining.
T.C. Ostrander threw a 67-yard touchdown pass deep
down the middle of the field for Alex Smith on the first
play of Stanford's final scoring drive, putting the Cardinal
ahead but leaving a few too many seconds on the clock.
Ostrander came in after starter Trent Edwards was
knocked out of the game by Jimmy Verdon on the first
play of the second half and was 8-of-15 passing for 161
yards, a touchdown and an interception.
Walter finished 28-of-42 passing for 415 yards, four
touchdowns and one interception for Arizona State (7-2,
4-2). which also got 186 rushing yards on 34 carries by con
verted wide receiver Rudy Burgess. Both Derek Hagan
and Terry Richardson topped 100 yards receiving.
For Stanford (4-5, 2-4), Smith led the way with five
catches for 112 yards and two touchdowns, setting a new
school record for career receptions by a tight end (104,
breaking Bob Moore's record of 100). Michael Sgroi made
a 47-yard field goal and Kenneth Tolon rushed 18 times
fora team-high 30 yards and a touchdown.

Sophomore receiver Mark Bradford and the Cardinal offense had an interesting evening against Arizona State Stan
ford's matchup wasn't the only tight game though, as two other conference tilts were decided by one or two points.
The two teams entered with just
23 combined turnovers, hut togeth
er they coughed up the hall nine
times in total on Saturday.
Udeme Udofia blocked not one
but two Arizona State punts, both
leading to first-half Stanford scores,
but Walter completed a 52-yard
Mail Mary over four Cardinal de
fenders to Miller on the last play of
the second quarter to give the Sun
Devils a 17-14 halftime lead.
Washington State 31, UCLA 29
The Bruins trailed 31-16 in the
third quarter after Jerome Harri
son scored his third touchdown of

but Drew Olson rallied the Bruins
(5-4,3-3) to within two points with

Perry and four yards to Manuel
White, Jr.
1 lowever, Olson's two-point pass
fell incomplete with 42 seconds left,

snapped its four-game losing streak.
Harrison carried a school-record
42 times for 247 yards to lead the
Cougar charge, and backup Allen
Thompson found time to add 49

Last-minute two-point
pass fails, Bruins lose

yards on nine carries as UCLA's
weak run defense once again proved
to be its demise.
Alex Brink was 17-of-27 passing
for 165 yards, a touchdown and no
interceptions for the Cougars. Jason
Hill caught four passes for 9K yards
and a touchdown that put Washing
ton State up, 21-7, in the second

in the first half.
Arizona 23, Washington 13
The Wildcats (2-7. 1-5) won for

away in Tucson. Cornerback Wilrey
Fontenot returned a fumble 33
yards for the go-ahead touchdown
and Mike Bell rushed for two scores
of his own as Mike Stoops earned his
first Pac-10 victory.

The Huskies (1-8,0-6), who lead
the nation in turnovers, coughed up

only Cal and Washington State re
maining on their schedule, the
Huskies could end the year without
a single conference win.

The Pacific-10 Conference had undoubtedly its most
exciting and competitive Saturday of the season, as its five
games were decided by one, two, three, eight and 10
points.
The difference in the Oregon-California tilt ended up
being a missed extra point after a first-quarter Oregon
touchdown. Arizona State defeated Stanford with nine
seconds remaining. UCLA could have tied Washington
State with just 0:42 remaining had it converted a two-point
try. Also, Arizona scored 14 unanswered second-half
points in a comeback win over Washington and Southern
California overcame a halftime deficit to defeat Oregon
State.
No. 1 Southern California 28, Oregon State 20
The Trojans trailed 13-7 at halftime in a fog-shrouded
game at Reser Stadium. Reggie Bush's 65-yard punt re
turn fora touchdown broke the game open for the de
fending national champions (9-0,6-0 Pac-10). giving them
a 21-13 lead early in the fourth quarter.
The Beavers (4-5, 3-3) built a 13-0 lead behind two
Alexis Serna field goals and a scoring pass from Derek
Anderson to Marcel Love, but stalled in the second half.
Bush had 88 rushing yards on 11 carries. His teammate,
LenDale White, ran 25 times for 120 yards and a touch
down to lead the USC offense. Matt Leinart threw for 205
yards, two touchdowns and one interception despite the
fog. Both scoring tosses went to Dominique Byrd, who
had seven receptions for 85 yards, both team-highs.
Dwight Wright ran for 75 yards on just 12 carries for the
Beavers, but Anderson completed only 22-of-51 passes
for 330 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions.
Mike Hass had eight catches for 119 yards to lead Oregon
State.
Ryan Killeen missed two field goal attempts for the
Trojans, but Byrd, Bush and the USC defense bailed him
out. Oregon State's first seven possessions of the second
half led to one fumble, two interceptions, three punts and
a turnover on downs.
No. 4 California 28, Oregon 27
The resurgent Ducks (5-4, 4-2) saw their four-game
winning streak come to an end at Memorial Stadium, but
not before they gave the Golden Bears (7-1, 5-1) their
toughest test since their loss to USC.
Oregon's Jared Siegel — far and away the best kicker
in the Pac-10 two years ago. when he made 20-of-24 field
goals, including a 59-yarder, was named AII-Pac-10 first
team and was a finalist for the Lou Groza award — missed
an extra-point attempt in the first period, ending his streak

of 115 consecutive PATs made. He shouldn't feel too, too
bad — his Cal counterpart, Tom Schneider, missed two
field goals.
Since each team scored four touchdowns, Siegel's miss
was critical. Perhaps not as critical, though, as Tim Day's
drop of a wide-open, fourth-down pass on the Ducks' last
drive. Had he caught the ball, the Ducks' drive would have
continued. Even if it stalled, Oregon still would've been in
range for Siegel to attempt a game-winning kick.
Oregon took a 20-14 lead in the first quarter, but did not
have many chances after that, thanks to Cal's offense,
which staged drawn-out drive after drawn-out drive. The
Ducks had a mere six possessions in the final three periods.
J.J. Arrington rushed 26 times for 193 yards and a
touchdown for Cal. while Aaron Rodgers was 21-of-32
passing for 275 yards, three touchdowns and no intercep
tions. His top target, Geoff Mac Arthur, caught eight balls
for 121 yards, including the go-ahead touchdown late in
the fourth quarter — the only time either team scored in
the second half.
For Oregon. Kellen Clemens was 19-of-33 passing for
218 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. Ter
rence Whitehead led the team with 91 yards rushing on 15
carries. And. his drop notwithstanding. Day had a nice
day, catching two scoring passes.
No. 23 Arizona State 34, Stanford 31
The Cardinal faced a 26-14 deficit at the start of the
fourth quarter, but went on a 17-0 rally to take a 31 -26 lead
