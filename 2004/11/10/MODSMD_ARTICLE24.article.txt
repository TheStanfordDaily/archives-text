# Cardinal play host to No. 4 Cal Bears at Avery Aquatic
## 
### SAMUEL CHEN 
Things are not expected to be nearly as
easy as they were at the Cardinal's first dual
meet when the No. 4 Stanford men's swim
ming squad (1-0) takes to the pool for its sec
ond official meet of the season, at the Avery
Aquatic Center this afternoon.
In this triple-distance meet, Stanford swim
mers will be taking on their cross-bay rivals,
California (1-0), for the first of two dual meets
between the teams this season.
The fact that the Golden Bears are now
tied with the Cardinal for the No. 4 ranking
going into this meet only intensifies the rival
ry. The tie was caused when the latest dual
meet rankings by the College Swimming
Coaches Association of America placed
Southern California in the No. 2 position,
bumping both Stanford and Cal out of their
former second and third spots.
"I don't know what the rivalry is like be
tween Cal and Stanford, but I'm sure I'll get a
taste of it on Wednesday," noted freshman
Noa Sakamoto, who turned out a winning
swim in the 1,000-yard freestyle on Friday.
Coming off Friday's resounding 157-97
win over last year's Division II NCAA
champion, the Cal State-Bakersfield Road
runners, the Cardinal are looking forward to
their only triple-distance meet of the season.
This is the second of two meets Stanford is
swimming prior to the eagerly awaited
Speedo Cup. Therefore it will be the Cardi
nal's last "tune-up" before it takes on a field
of numerous Division I opponents.
In the triple-distance meet, competitors
will swim in sets of three events, specific to in
dividual strokes. The 50-yard, 100-yard and
200-yard events of butterfly, backstroke and
breaststroke will require sprinters to swim
long distances and usual distance swimmers to
swim sprints.
The individual medley swimmers have a
different set, composed of the 100 IM, 200 IM
and 400 IM. The freestyle swimmers, on the
other hand, are provided with the option to ei
ther swim the 50-yard, 100-yard and 200-yard
set or the 200-yard, 500-yard and thousand
yard set. The competition formally concludes
with the 400-yard medley and freestyle relays.
The relays at this meet will show how each
team has responded to the loss of veteran ex
perience, since both Stanford and Cal lost
many swimmers off their strong relay teams of
past years.
