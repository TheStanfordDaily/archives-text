# Women's crew caps off fall season

structions to the rowers — with
1,500 meters left couldn't break the
team's rhythm. It was little sur
prise, then, that captain Kristina
Peterson noted the connection of
the boat's rowers as the defining
aspect of the varsity eight's race.
"The effort's been there all sea
son, but this weekend was the first
time we really saw results," Peter
son said.
Those results were seen when,
in addition to producing their best
race of the year, the members of
the varsity eight came away with a
first-place finish at Newport for the
second year in a row, beating the
time of San Diego State's boat by a
single second. And while a first
place finish in November ultimate
ly has no bearing on the team's
year-end standing, it is a clear indi
cation of what the lightweight
team, in only its fourth year of exis
tence at Stanford, is capable of
achieving.
In addition to the varsity eight,
the lightweight team also entered a
varsity boat into the women's
Open 4 event. The four members
of the boat — Kate Hayes, Nicole
Pierce, Judith Pond and Amina
Richardson — were all racing for
the second time in two hours, a tax
ing challenge physically and men
tally. Nevertheless, against compe
tition outside their normal weight
class, the Stanford lightweight four
put forth a very respectable perfor
mance and came away with one
more race of experience to draw
upon later this year.
Earlier in the day, a lightweight
mixed eight raced in the women's
Open Eight event, featuring a line

sity four, as well as Rene Spellman

Heading south to Newport,
Calif, this weekend, the members
of the women's lightweight crew
team knew just one thing for cer
tain — with Monday would come
the beginning of a long, intense
winter of erging, conditioning and
training. After their performance
at the Newport Autumn Rowing
Festival on Sunday, though, the
lightweights will have nothing but
motivation and inspiration before
them during the long months
ahead.
Coming off a disappointing
weekend at the Head of the Amer
ican in Sacramento, Calif., the
lightweight varsity eight entered
the women's Lightweight Eight
event focused and determined to
end their fall season on a high note.
And streaking down the 4,600
meter Newport course in 17:32
minutes, they did just that.
"From the first strokes it felt
good," said team captain Michelle
Ramirez, who rowed in the bow
seat of the varsity eight boat.
Starting first under the head
race format (in which crews cross
the start line at approximately 15
second intervals), the Stanford
lightweights distanced themselves
from their competition and never
looked back — no dramatic pass
es, just a constant focus on tech
nique and perfect unison for every
stroke, all the way down the course
from start to finish.
So coordinated were the team's
strokes that even the failure of the
boat's cox-box — the electrical
speaker unit used by the crew's cox
to issue timing and stroke rating in

and three novice rowers. Despite
again racing outside their weight
class, the mixed eight managed to
avoid being passed until after the
halfway mark of the course and
held off another crew down the
stretch until the last ten meters.
And having approached their race
as a race against the clock, the
lightweight mixed eight successful
ly broke 20 minutes with a course
time of 19:56.
"The novice rowers were really
together," said sophomore Rene
Spellman. "It felt just like a normal
varsity race."
Such an observation bodes well
for the lightweight team, which
with its current varsity roster of
two cox hands and thirteen rowers
could field two boats — an eight
and a four — with one reserve
rower.
Though the spring season is still
a long way off and the team's plans
are currently unresolved, the possi
bility of tapping the team's novice
ranks in order to field two varsity
eights remains a possibility. As a
result, any opportunity to afford
novice rowers the chance to experi
ence varsity-level competition is
valuable.
Eight novice rowers represent
ed the Stanford lightweights in the
women's Novice Eight event and
with a course time of 20:39 stroked
their way to a 14th-place finish out
of 26 entries in their first competi
tive appearance of the year.
Given the lightweight team's ex
hibition this weekend of both per
formance and potential, it's no won
der that the members of the team
are looking forward to the spring
season and to their pursuit of a
medal at National Championships.
