## 
###

door Championships last weekend at Michigan
turned out to be correct.
The tournament, which featured a field of 32 in
singles play and 16 doubles teams, seeded senior
Sam Warburg and junior KC Corkery. the reigning
NCAA doubles champions, as the No. 2 seed going
into the tournament.
The pair fell to the top-seeded duo of Scott
Green and Ross Wilson of Ohio State in the dou
bles final on Sunday by a score of 8-5. The Buckeye
pair was ranked only 34th nationally during the
pre-season.
Throughout the weekend. Warburg and Corkery
experienced more success when playing together.
In singles play, Warburg opened the tournament
with a win over Indiana's Jakub Praibis before slip

ping past Bojan Szumanski in three sets and handily
beating UCLA's Ben Kohlloeffel, 6-3, 6-3. Ulti
mately, however, the senior dropped the semi-final
match to Jesse Witten of Kentucky, 6-4,2-6,6-4.
After falling to Duke in the opening round,
Corkery swept past Indiana's Praibis, Oklahoma's
Marek Velicka, and Baylor's Lars Poerschke in
straight sets for all three matches to take the conso
lation bracket win.
The Cardinal's strong performance in doubles
play is not unusual. Warburg and Corkery captured
the doubles title at the Wilson /ITA Regional
Championships in October, a performance that
guaranteed them a berth at Indoors.
The No. 7 Stanford squad will take on Hawaii at
Honolulu in a dual match on Tuesday, Nov. 23.
