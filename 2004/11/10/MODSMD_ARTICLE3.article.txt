# Cardinal Care insurance waivers cause headaches
## 
### BEA SANFORD 
Junior Erin Hsu has extra
healthcare insurance coverage this
quarter â€” but not by choice. Hsu
forgot to waive her Stanford Cardi
nal Care insurance plan before the
fall quarter deadline and had to pay
a non-refundable $516 quarterly
fee.
Because Cardinal Care is set as
the default healthcare provider at
the beginning of each academic
year, students must waive the plan
on Axess by the first day of classes
to avoid payipg the fee.
According to Amy Baldwin, as
sociate director of Vaden Health
Center, about 6,000 out of Stan
ford's 14,000 undergraduate and
graduate students do not require
Cardinal Care because they are al
ready covered by their own health
insurance policies.
Many students with different
providers say they feel hassled by
the waiver system.
After forgetting to waive Cardi
nal Care, Hsu said she contacted
Vaden about reversing the fee but
her request was refused.
"I talked to a representative on
the phone, and she was pretty nice,
but she explained that because it

was an outside provider, Stanford
had to pay at the beginning of the
term, and 1 couldn't get a refund,"
Hsu said.
So Hsu's parents ended up pay
ing for two health insurance plans.
"They were kind of upset, but
they just said, 'Well, we learned a
lesson,"' Hsu said.
Baldwin said that Stanford tries
to give all students notice of the
waiver deadline.
"To help students remember,
we do a number of things like an in
sert in the bill, putting the health
fee waiver link on the top page of
Axess, a brochure and letter is
mailed in the spring, and new stu
dents receive material about Cardi
nal Care," Baldwin said. "In the
end, if a student misses the dead
line, they have to pay the fee."
"There are a small number of
students who miss the deadline and
end up paying the fee. But if a stu
dent misses the fall deadline, they
can waive insurance in the winter
and spring quarter."
Baldwin added that changes to
the Axess system have made filling
out the waivers easier.
"There are two noticeable im
provements that assist students
when they waive insurance. First,

students now have the ability to
waive an entire academic year on
one screen. Secondly, the link to
the health fee waiver is more
prominent [since] it can be found
on the top page in Axess."
However, students like Hsu and
sophomore Carl Cummings, who
also forgot to waive in time, said
they had not been given sufficient
warning.
"I never got any e-mails, and
didn't really receive any notice that
I had to waive Cardinal Care,"
Cummings said. "They say they
sent the thing, but I'm not sure I
ever saw it."
Unlike Hsu, Cummings man
aged to avoid the fee, even though
Baldwin called it non-refundable.
"They gave me a one-time re
fund of the fee because of extenuat
ing circumstances," said Cum
mings. who rows for the crew team.
II was communicating all this info
to the athletic department, and my
computer wasn't hooked up until
two days before the deadline. It
didn't help that Axess was on the
fritz for the beginning part of the
year."
