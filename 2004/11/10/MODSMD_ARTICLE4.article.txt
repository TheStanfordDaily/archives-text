# Pollsters explore election results
## Bush's victory strategy likened to building a plane, playing Texas Hold 'Em 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
An array of partisan and non-par
tisan polling and public opinion ex
perts gathered at Stanford yesterday
to analyze the outcome of last week's
election, including a Kerry campaign
pollster who complimented the Bush
campaign on using fear as an issue in
the election.
The experts spoke as part of a day
long conference sponsored by Stan
ford's new Institute for Research in
the Social Sciences.
The first session of the conference
featured back-to-back presentations
by Mark Mellman. chief pollster for
the John Kerry campaign, and Jan
Van Lohuizen, a top pollster from the
George W. Bush campaign. The pre
sentations offered an inside look at
the highly empirical, data-filled world
of campaign strategies.
Mellman said the Kerry campaign
concentrated its efforts in the battle
ground state; he pointed out a 1.3 per
cent increase in Democratic votes in
swing states compared to the 2(KK)
election. "Targeted focus paid off.
though not enough," he said.
He said the Bush campaign's plan
was especially effective during a time
of war.
"The Bush camp used fear to
make voters risk-averse," Mellman
said. "I mean that in a complimenta
ry. not pejorative way. There are real
things to be afraid of."
Mellman said that despite voters'
support for Kerry on domestic policy
issues like healthcare and the econo
my, the perception of an elevated

threat led to Bush's victory. He added
that while many voters agreed with
Kerry's call fora new direction, "in
the end, it was not as compelling as
steady leadership."
Van Lohuizen began his presenta
tion by explaining the role he played
in Bush's re-election plan.
"I consider myself an electoral en
gineer," he said. "My concern is not
to understand the laws of aerody
namics. My concern is to build a plane
that flies."
Mellman used a different
metaphor to describe the Bush
team's victory strategy, comparing it
to winning a popular card game.
"It's like Texas Hold 'Em. The
way to win is not to play the cards, but
to play the players." he said.
However, according to Van Lo
huizen. not all the post-election num
bers were favorable. Exit polls
showed taxes ranked last in order of
importance among voters by Van Lo
huizen's data. The drop in perceived
importance among voters was trou
bling to party officials because taxes
and Republican domestic policy are
traditionally correlated. Van Lo
huizen said.
Moral values ranked first, with 21
percent of voters saying it was the
most important issue out of a list of
seven. Van Lohuizen cautioned
against overstating the figure's signif
icance.
" There's been this huge kerfuffle
over this moral values number." he
said. " But if the highest number is 21
percent, that means there's no con
sensus. There's no leading issue."
Both Mellman and Van Lohuizen
agreed that this election was historical
ly significant for its high level of voter
turnout, sustained voter interest and
sharp polarization of the electorate.
But in the end. Van Lohuizen was
more optimistic than Mellman about
