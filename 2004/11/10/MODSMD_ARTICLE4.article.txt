# Pollsters explore election results
## Bush's victory strategy likened to building a plane, playing Texas Hold 'Em 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
An array of partisan and non-par
tisan polling and public opinion ex
perts gathered at Stanford yesterday
to analyze the outcome of last week's
election, including a Kerry campaign
pollster who complimented the Bush
campaign on using fear as an issue in
the election.
The experts spoke as part of a day
long conference sponsored by Stan
ford's new Institute for Research in
the Social Sciences.
The first session of the conference
featured back-to-back presentations
by Mark Mellman. chief pollster for
the John Kerry campaign, and Jan
Van Lohuizen, a top pollster from the
George W. Bush campaign. The pre
sentations offered an inside look at
the highly empirical, data-filled world
of campaign strategies.
Mellman said the Kerry campaign
concentrated its efforts in the battle
ground state; he pointed out a 1.3 per
cent increase in Democratic votes in
swing states compared to the 2(KK)
election. "Targeted focus paid off.
though not enough," he said.
He said the Bush campaign's plan
was especially effective during a time
of war.
"The Bush camp used fear to
make voters risk-averse," Mellman
said. "I mean that in a complimenta
ry. not pejorative way. There are real
things to be afraid of."
Mellman said that despite voters'
support for Kerry on domestic policy
issues like healthcare and the econo
my, the perception of an elevated

threat led to Bush's victory. He added
that while many voters agreed with
Kerry's call fora new direction, "in
the end, it was not as compelling as
steady leadership."
Van Lohuizen began his presenta
tion by explaining the role he played
in Bush's re-election plan.
"I consider myself an electoral en
gineer," he said. "My concern is not
to understand the laws of aerody
namics. My concern is to build a plane
that flies."
Mellman used a different
metaphor to describe the Bush
team's victory strategy, comparing it
to winning a popular card game.
"It's like Texas Hold 'Em. The
way to win is not to play the cards, but
to play the players." he said.
However, according to Van Lo
huizen. not all the post-election num
bers were favorable. Exit polls
showed taxes ranked last in order of
importance among voters by Van Lo
huizen's data. The drop in perceived
importance among voters was trou
bling to party officials because taxes
and Republican domestic policy are
traditionally correlated. Van Lo
huizen said.
Moral values ranked first, with 21
percent of voters saying it was the
most important issue out of a list of
seven. Van Lohuizen cautioned
against overstating the figure's signif
icance.
" There's been this huge kerfuffle
over this moral values number." he
said. " But if the highest number is 21
percent, that means there's no con
sensus. There's no leading issue."
Both Mellman and Van Lohuizen
agreed that this election was historical
ly significant for its high level of voter
turnout, sustained voter interest and
sharp polarization of the electorate.
But in the end. Van Lohuizen was
more optimistic than Mellman about

the direction of the electorate; Van
Lohuizen cited the strong double
digit gains among Hispanic voters
and married women for Bush in this
election.
Neil Malhotra, a doctoral student
in political science, said he appreciat
ed the unique perspective each poll
ster had to offer.
"You really got the opportunity to
get inside the campaigns and see how
they used and focused their data," he
said.
In addition to the partisan ana
lysts. several media-polling experts
discussed the election from the news
industry's standpoint.
"Why did President Bush win the
election?" asked (iary Langer, the di
rector of polling for ABC News. "I
suggest that the answer can be found
in a single phrase: 9/11."
Langer cited polling data reveal
ing that 49 percent of likely voters
said that Bush was the only candidate
they trusted on terrorism, and of that
group. 97 percent said they would
vote for him.
"That's 48 of his percentage
points," Langer said.
He also noted that 2(H)4 was the
first election since 1988 — the earliest
ye;ir that accurate data was available
in which registered Democrats did
not outnumber Republicans at the
polls. Each party accounted for 37
percent of the turnout.
Frank Dewport, the editor in chief
of the C iallup Poll, discussed what he
saw as a troubling new trend — the
politicizing of the objective data that
surfaced during the recent election.
Pollsters across the country were
charged with being biased from both
sides when the numbers did not re
flect the reality the politicians desired.

"Social science came under more
and more attack," Dewport said, em
phasizing the need for centers like In
stitute for Research in the Social Sci
ences to "apply science and national
database study rather than wild
guesses."
The Institute was established in
September to organize and develop
social science across disciplines —
ranging from communication to po
litical science to psychology — in
order "to address significant chal
lenges confronting us as a society,"
according to the Institute's mission
statement.
Yesterday's conference was a
debut of sorts for the Institute.
The event, titled "The 2(XW Amer
ican Presidential Election: Voter De
cision-Making in a Complex World."
was promoted both as a learning op
portunity about what many people al
ready view as a historically significant
election and"a kick-off for what we
hope will lead to a growth of electoral
research at Stanford," Political Sci
ence and Communication Prof. Jon
Krosnick said in his opening remarks.
"Getting a critical mass of people
together with shared interests is the
way advance happens," said Commu
nication Prof. James Fishkin. the di
rector for the Center of Deliberative
Democracy, which is housed in the
communication department. "IRiSS
provides that infrastructure. I ap
plaud the initiative."
Malhotra was equally optimistic
about the potential of the Institute.
"It's great because a lot of the de
partments are very small, so it's great
to have a center to join social science
faculty," he said. "Pooling our re
sources also makes it easier to get the
fundiim we need."
