# 'Mobile' ASSU Senate hits Toyon
## All four Constitutional Council nominees approved 
### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Residents of Toyon Hall who wan
dered into their lounge last night may
have been surprised to find members of
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
spread out on the sofas and chairs.
For the first time, the Senate held its
weekly meeting in a dorm in order to get
more students involved and educated
about the ASSU. Attendance was scat
tered at best; it was not significantly
higher than that at the Senate's meet
ings in the past, which were held in the
basement of the Law School.
Only a handful of students observed
the open meeting, even though it was
widely publicized by the Senate. While
the attendance was low. some members
of the Senate viewed the effort as a form
of progress.
"Obviously I am a little disappointed
by the turnout," said Senate Chair Chris
Lin. a senior. "However. 1 think it's a

step in the right direction."
"Not everything will be widely suc
cessful the first time around, but I look
forward to doing this again next quar
ter," he continued. "We want to hold
meetings in dorms once or twice per
quarter."
The Senate plans to rotate its dorm
meetings through the larger residences
on campus. The ASSU's outreach pro
gram is the first of its kind in the Senate's
history.
The Senate opened the meeting by
reviewing and then approving the four
nominees for the ASSU Constitutional
Council. Jenny Allen, a first year stu
dent at the School of Law; Patrick
Crosetto, a first year student at the
Graduate School of Business; and
sophomores Justin Liu and Monica
Uddin each received the necessary two
thirds majority vote to become council
members.
Twelve senators voted in favor of
each candidate, zero voted in opposi

tion, and Lin abstained in each case.
Alter the vote, at least one of the
nominees was relieved hut not sur
prised.
"The process has been very interest
ing and very thorough." Crosetto said.
"It's been reassuring because it ensures
that that we're all qualified candidates."
"I'm honored to be nominated with
the other candidates." he continued. "1
think our strengths and weaknesses will
complement each other."
Despite their near-unanimous ap
proval by the Senate, the four nominees
are not yet officially members of the
Constitutional Council.
They must wait until tonight, when
the Graduate Student Council will meet
and hold its own vote on the candidates.
If they are approved tonight, the four
nominees will officially be Constitution
al Council members. They were selected
by the Constitutional Council Selection
Committee, which was created by exec
utive members of the Senate.
