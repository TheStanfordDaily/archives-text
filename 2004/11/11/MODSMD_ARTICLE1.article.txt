# ResEd policy frustrates some student publications
## 
### JOE SEXTON contributing writer 
A Residential Education policy
that prohibits door-to-door distrib
ution of student publications with
out consent from individual dorms
is still causing concerns among stu
dents a full year after Res Ed began
enforcing of the rule more strin
gently.
After the Stanford Review pub
lished and distributed an issue last
fall that included an article that com
pared MEChA to the Ku Klux Klan.
some residence staff requested that
Res Ed hold publications account
able for distribution practices.
Since then, campus publications
have tried to distribute materials
without running afoul of the policy
while simultaneously trying to revise
the rule.

Publications like The Stanford Re
view must get approval before dis
tributing door-to-door in dorms.
"I don't think that flagrantly vio
lating University policy by distribut
ing publications door-to-door is the
way to go," said Kai Stinchcombe,
editor of The Stanford Progressive
and a doctoral candidate in political
science. "Frankly, it seems like the
solution is to convince students to
vote to allow distribution."
Others agreed.
"I don't know if [violating Uni
versity policy] is really the way to
come to an agreement with the ad
ministration." said senior Charlie
Stockman, editor of The Chaparral.
"I don't think they will buckle to our
demands. We are irritated with the
policy, but I don't know it just ignor
ing and violating it is practical."
According to ASSU Publications
Board Director Matthew Henick, a
senior, one of the chief concerns of

campus publications is that the poli
cy is limiting their circulation. Publi
cations are only allowed to be left in
stacks at dorm entranceways.
"The policy as it stands now is in
effective," he said. "If there is no
door-to-door distribution, people
don't get to see the publication.
There are no alternatives that allow
the student to receive the issue."
Some students agreed that the
policy limits their ability to enjoy the
work of their peers.
"1 feel bad that [many student
publications] get slighted so much
that not many people know about
their work and not many people get
to see it," said freshman Ryan Car
rington. "Maybe if at hall meetings
people could offer the issues — that
would be a balance of both sides."
Since the reinvigoration of Res

Ed's policy enforcement, publica
tion representatives have gone to
house meetings to lobby residents
and staff to allow door-to-door dis
tribution. According to Henick,
however, publications have not lob
bied as vigorously this fall and, as a
result, only one-quarter of dorms
have approved door-to-door distrib
ution.
The grievances of publications
have also failed to sway the staffs of
many dorms who claim that door-to
door distribution is inappropriate.
"There is certain sensitive con
tent in publications that we don't
think residents should have to deal
with in their rooms," said Roble res
ident assistant Kevin Holmes, a se
nior. "We just want to enforce what
we feel is a reasonable policy."
A handful of dorms, including

Donner. have approved door-to
door publication distribution.
"I think it is fine, because if some
one sees something that they want to
read they'll read it, and if they don't
want to read something they won't
read it." said junior Li/ Vrolyk. the
head academic peer coordinator in
Donner. "I don't really see a prob
lem with it."
Stinchcombe said that dorms that
decide to prevent door-to-door pub
lication distribution may be convey
ing dissatisfaction with the publica
tions themselves.
"If dorm residents and staff don't
want distribution, then maybe that's
something that the publications
should be thinking about."
