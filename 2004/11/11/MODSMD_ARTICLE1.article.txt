# ResEd policy frustrates some student publications

### JOE SEXTON contributing writer 
A Residential Education policy
that prohibits door-to-door distrib
ution of student publications with
out consent from individual dorms
is still causing concerns among stu
dents a full year after Res Ed began
enforcing of the rule more strin
gently.
After the Stanford Review pub
lished and distributed an issue last
fall that included an article that com
pared MEChA to the Ku Klux Klan.
some residence staff requested that
Res Ed hold publications account
able for distribution practices.
Since then, campus publications
have tried to distribute materials
without running afoul of the policy
while simultaneously trying to revise
the rule.

Publications like The Stanford Re
view must get approval before dis
tributing door-to-door in dorms.
