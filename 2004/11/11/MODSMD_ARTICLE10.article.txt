# Messenger bags
## The 						latest trend in bookbags may be bad news for your back 
### JESSICA LIN 
From stiletto heels to tongue piercings,
sometimes fashion trends verge on the side
of danger. The newest trend in backpacks —
messenger bags — may join the collection of
fashion accessories that are not optimal for
your health.
The übiquitous messenger bag, a rectan
gular pack with outer flaps and one shoulder
strap, started becoming trendy about five
years ago. The bags were first worn by most
ly by just girls and then later by both gen
ders.
Messenger bags are sold at the Stanford
Bookstore, and many people can be found
wearing them on campus. Yet despite their
popularity, they could be actually worse
for your shoulders and spine than tradi
tional backpacks.
Alina Liberman, a freshman, has been
using a messenger bag since the first day of
classes this year.
"I really regret buying my messenger
bag," Liberman said. "It's annoying and
hurts my back a lot."
Liberman and other ailing students have
a valid reason for complaining of back and
shoulder pain. David Edell, a sports
medicine specialist at Stanford Interven
tional Spine Center explained how this new
trend could be harmful.
"Despite the fact that there is not a
whole lot of research on messenger bags
and how they affect one's back, back
packs in general have been known to
cause back problems when they are not
worn properly or when they are too
heavy." he said.
Edell said that messenger bags have the
same effect as a regular two strap back
pack. except that all the weight of the bag
is concentrated on one strap and therefore

on one side of the body.
The weight is distributed
completely along one mus
cle on the back called the
trapezius muscle. Students
using messenger bags usu
ally try to compensate for
the added pressure on their
back by leaning to one side.
"In addition, a problem
arises also because a mes
senger bag is situated so
low on a student's waist
that it's usually against the
butt." Edell said. "This will
change the center of gravi
ty fora person. Whereas
the shape of a normal per
son's back is in a rough S
shape, the messenger bag
will add weight so that the
top part of the S is flat
tened and the bottom part
of the S is too curved. This
will undoubtedly cause a
lot of pain and discomfort
to the back."
Edell's ideal backpack is
one that resembles a
hiker's backpack, where
the waist strap and both
shoulder straps are worn.
This distributes the weight
evenly. The waist strap is
essential because it ensures
that the weight is distribut
ed along a person's legs,
taking pressure off the
back.
Some elementary schools
require students to use
rolling backpacks, a trend
Edell supports.
"Then when they get to

high school and college they
will be used to using rolling
backpacks, which take the
pressure off the back entire
ly," Edell added.
Tim Bowman, a physical
therapist at the Vaden Stu
dent Health Center's Physi
cal Therapy Department,
also agreed with most of
Edell's ideas. Bowman ex
plained that using a mes
senger bag is the same as
hanging your backpack by
only one strap.
"The weight should be
more evenly distributed,"
he said. "If the weight is
completely on one side of
the back and the strap keeps
falling off. then people will
keep shrugging their shoul
der up. The muscles on this
side of the back will have to
work harder to make up for
the added pressure on the
other side of the back."
Bowman also comment
ed that the way people usu
ally wear messenger bags is
incorrect. Students typically
sport the bag by wearing the
strap on one shoulder, let
ting it hang on their side.
Instead, Bowman said,
"Messenger bags should be
worn diagonally across the
back, which distributes the
weight most evenly and en
sures that the strap won't
fall off."
Bowman added that
backpacks aren't necessar
ily better than messenger

bags, especially if students place very
heavy books and water bottles in them.
"A backpack with a lot of weight in it
will have too much weight located further
out from the back, which pulls you back
and compresses the spine," he said. "Stu
dents will have to walk bent forward in this
circumstance."
Like Edell, Bowman supports the
rolling backpack, but he said he under
stands that at Stanford — where most peo
ple uses a bike — this idea might not be
practical. Bowman suggested getting a
bike basket for books and binders.
"[Using a basket for your bike] removes
the weight entirely from the back and gets
rid of the problem," he said.
Despite the potentially harmful effects
of the messenger bag proposed by these
experts, some students at Stanford report
ed that they have no problem with their
messenger packs. Helen Snodgrass, a
freshman, has two messenger bags, both of
which she has started using this year.
"I like them a lot," Snodgrass said.
"Mine are never uncomfortable simply be
cause I don't put a lot of books in them. If
I had to bring a lot of books, I would just
use my regular backpack."
Abel Romano, a freshman, said he had a
similar opinion regarding the bags. He has
been using his messenger bag for six months
and has never felt any back discomfort.
"I love my messenger bag because of its
functionality." Romano said. "It's great to
use it when you only have to bring a note
book and a few other things to class. But if
I had to bring more than one textbook, I
would use a backpack."
If they are used the proper way, mes
senger bags can be very useful and cause
few health side effects. But perhaps, to be
on the safe side, one could always stick
with the traditional backpack.
