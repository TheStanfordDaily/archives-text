# Women's health group kicks off awareness campaign
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Whenever women become in
volved with a female-focused issue,
people often deem the issue — and
those working on it — a part of the
feminist movement. But according
to the new student group "Promot
ing Women's Health and Human
Rights," the issue of women's
health touches the lives of both
men and women.
The group, founded by senior
Tiffany Castillo and junior Ariana
Fawn Milman, is planning on
holding a series of events this year
focused on educating the Stanford
community about the intricate re
lationship between women's
health and human rights around
the world.
"One of our goals with this
group is to demonstrate how every
thing is a women's issue' and en
courage students who are con
cerned about these issues to incor
porate a gender lens into their ac
tivism," Milman said.
The events will include perfor
mances. speaker series and a grant

writing campaign to fund women's
groups worldwide.
This coming Saturday, the
group will host its first event, enti
tled "The Real Story," at Toyon
Hall from 7 - 9 p.m. The evening
presentation will feature student
performances ranging from fla
menco and belly dancing to classi
cal Indian singing.
"We wanted to create a fun and
comfortable environment that
would attract a diverse audience of
students that might not have other
wise come to an informative ses
sion on women's health," Castillo
explained. "They will provide a
complementary dynamic to |the
rest of the evening.]"
The celebration will also feature
a more serious presentation on ma
ternal and child mortality in Tibet.
The speaker. Phuoc Le. a medical
student at Stanford, has spent
many years studying maternal and
infant health in the region of Tibet.
The group approached Le after
hearing him deliver a lecture in
their human biology seminar.
In order to further emphasize
the stories of suffering from women

around the world, the group has
also planned a series of spoken
word performances that night, in
cluding narrations of testimonies
from the Global Tribunal on Viola
tions of Women's Rights, held in
Vienna, Austria, in 1993.
Castillo and Milman created the
group after taking the human biolo
gy course "Critical Issues in Interna
tional Women's Health," taught by
visiting Prof. Anne Firth Murray.
"I recognized that there was not
only a tremendous lack of aware
ness on campus about global
women's health and human rights
issues, but there was also a discon
nect between students interested in
these issues and opportunities for
activism," Castillo said. "I felt that
starting a student group devoted to
promoting women's health and
human rights would be an effective
way to address these concerns and
provide a valuable resource and
support network for students."
Milman got involved with wom
en's health issues early on in her
Stanford career, starting with an in
ternational health experience.
"1 first became aware of
women's health issues the summer
after my freshman year, when I vol
unteered fora women's center in
Peru that supported victims of do
mestic violence and encouraged
solidarity and empowerment
among its members," Milman said.
"This was an incredible, transform
ing experience, and I was so lucky
to get to know some really passion
ate, intelligent, strong and loving
women."
The group is planning other
events in the winter and spring
quarters, funded by the Bingham
Fund for Student Initiative in
Human Biology.
"We also plan on being actively
involved in V-day events and to es
tablish volunteer and internship
opportunities with local women's
organizations," Castillo added.
"We can hopefully establish the
philanthropic component of our
group by beginning fundraising to
make grants to grassroots women's
groups around the world."
