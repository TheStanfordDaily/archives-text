# Feel guilty if you're not studying all the time?
## You may be a workaholic 
### CHUAN-MEI LEE 
It's 11 p.m. on a Friday night.
People are heading over to SAE
or Bob or wherever there might be
booty-shaking music.
But not the 30 or so students still
hard at work in Meyer Library.
Is it just midterm season? Or is
there a subculture of workaholism
at Stanford?
Workaholism is an actual disor
der under which an individual is
addicted to work. Few Stanford
students are willing to label them
selves or their peers as worka
holics, but striking a good balance
between work and play is a con
cern on this campus.
The culture of workaholism
extends from school to the work
place, as many companies pro
mote an atmosphere of competi
tion between their employees.
According to WebMD, an on
line health information resource,
workaholism is a form of obses
sive-compulsive disorder. It's not
the same as working hard or work
ing a lot of hours. Rather, work be
comes an all-consuming activity
and prevents a workaholic from
enjoying time outside of work.
For Stanford students, school
work is unavoidable, but most stu
dents don't view themselves as
workaholics.
"From what I see from my peers,
they work pretty hard — but we
don't make a big deal out of it," said
freshman Huong Thei, who spent
Friday night reading for I-Hum in
Meyer's 24-hour study room.
Some students said that they
think it is not cool to make a big deal
about schoolwork or to be per
ceived as someone who studies a lot.
"At Stanford there's a lot of
closet studying," said sophomore
Mastoora Nasiri.
She cited the often-heard anal
ogy that Stanford students are like
ducks — swimming along effort

lessly on the surface, but paddling
like crazy underneath.
However, Nasiri admitted that
she does study a lot and sometimes
has trouble enjoying free time.
"If I'm not studying, I feel
guilty," Nasiri said. "1 feel like I
have to be studying. Sometimes I
won't be studying, but I won't be

school. They compare

enjoying myself."
Others felt a sense of competi
tion on campus that drives some
students to work too much.
"We've all been crammed into
the same campus, and there are
enough of us to reach overachiever
critical-mass," said lan Spiro, a co
terminal student. "Chances are,
you want to be this busy. And if you
don't, then you look lazy in com
parison to your roommate, friends.
Resident Assistant, etc."
"I've gotten to the point a few
times where I realized I was just
doing too much," Spiro added.
"But I don't think it's appropriate
to up and quit at the moment you
realize you are overworked. More
important is to recognize that situ
ation and look out for the next
critical point in your life where
you'll be deciding how busy to be
for the future."
This balance is hard to estab
lish. Junior Laura Hyde, a volun

teer at the Bridge Peer Counseling
Center, said that she has coun
seled many students who were
stressed out by schoolwork.
Donnovan Somera Yisrael, a
health educator at Vaden Student
Health Center, finds that Stanford
students tend to over-commit
themselves.
"How much can you realistical
ly do?" he asked. "My lesson for
people is you can't do it all."
This tendency to over-commit
may be due a culture of achieve
ment orientation, where a per
son's self-worth is based on his or
her accomplishments.
When asked what to do if a
friend has problems related to
workaholism or academic stress,
Yisrael suggested that the worst
thing to do is stay silent.
"Confrontation at some point
needs to happen," he said. "Two
things to say are, i care about you'
and i'm concerned about you."'
Yisrael added that "You can't
change people, but you can give
them feedback."
There are a host of resources at
Stanford that can aid students in
managing academic-related issues.
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices at Vaden offers one-on-one
counseling sessions that are free to
registered Stanford students. Ad
ditionally, Health Promotion Ser
vices. also at Vaden, offers work
shops on stress management.
If students are looking for peer
support. Peer Health Educators in
student residences and the Bridge
can provide these types of services.
For those struggling with a
fear of anything less than pris
tine. Yisrael stressed that no one is
perfect.
"It's perfectionism that tears
you down," Yisrael said. "The best
students in the world, they come to
this school. They compare them
selves to everyone else, and they
feel like losers."

workaholism is a form of obses
sive-compulsive disorder. It's not
the same as working hard or work
ing a lot of hours. Rather, work be
comes an all-consuming activity
and prevents a workaholic from
enjoying time outside of work.
For Stanford students, school
work is unavoidable, but most stu
dents don't view themselves as
workaholics.
"From what I see from my peers,
they work pretty hard — but we
don't make a big deal out of it," said
freshman Huong Thei, who spent
Friday night reading for I-Hum in
Meyer's 24-hour study room.
Some students said that they
think it is not cool to make a big deal
about schoolwork or to be per
ceived as someone who studies a lot.
"At Stanford there's a lot of
closet studying," said sophomore
Mastoora Nasiri.
She cited the often-heard anal
ogy that Stanford students are like
ducks — swimming along effort

lessly on the surface, but paddling
like crazy underneath.
However, Nasiri admitted that
she does study a lot and sometimes
has trouble enjoying free time.
"If I'm not studying, I feel
guilty," Nasiri said. "1 feel like I
have to be studying. Sometimes I
won't be studying, but I won't be

Others felt a sense of competi

students to work too much.
"We've all been crammed into
the same campus, and there are
enough of us to reach overachiever

terminal student. "Chances are,
you want to be this busy. And if you
don't, then you look lazy in com

Resident Assistant, etc."
"I've gotten to the point a few
times where I realized I was just
doing too much," Spiro added.
"But I don't think it's appropriate
to up and quit at the moment you
realize you are overworked. More
important is to recognize that situ
ation and look out for the next
critical point in your life where
you'll be deciding how busy to be
for the future."
This balance is hard to estab
lish. Junior Laura Hyde, a volun

teer at the Bridge Peer Counseling
Center, said that she has coun
seled many students who were
stressed out by schoolwork.
Donnovan Somera Yisrael, a
health educator at Vaden Student
Health Center, finds that Stanford
students tend to over-commit
themselves.
"How much can you realistical
ly do?" he asked. "My lesson for
people is you can't do it all."
This tendency to over-commit
may be due a culture of achieve
ment orientation, where a per
son's self-worth is based on his or
her accomplishments.
When asked what to do if a
friend has problems related to
workaholism or academic stress,
Yisrael suggested that the worst
thing to do is stay silent.
"Confrontation at some point
needs to happen," he said. "Two
things to say are, i care about you'
and i'm concerned about you."'
Yisrael added that "You can't
change people, but you can give
them feedback."
There are a host of resources at
Stanford that can aid students in
managing academic-related issues.
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices at Vaden offers one-on-one
counseling sessions that are free to
registered Stanford students. Ad
ditionally, Health Promotion Ser
vices. also at Vaden, offers work
shops on stress management.

support. Peer Health Educators in
student residences and the Bridge
can provide these types of services.

fear of anything less than pris

perfect.
"It's perfectionism that tears
you down," Yisrael said. "The best
students in the world, they come to
this school. They compare them
selves to everyone else, and they
feel like losers."
It's 11 p.m. on a Friday night.
People are heading over to SAE
or Bob or wherever there might be
booty-shaking music.
But not the 30 or so students still
hard at work in Meyer Library.
Is it just midterm season? Or is
there a subculture of workaholism
at Stanford?
Workaholism is an actual disor
der under which an individual is
addicted to work. Few Stanford
students are willing to label them
selves or their peers as worka
holics, but striking a good balance
between work and play is a con
cern on this campus.
The culture of workaholism
extends from school to the work
place, as many companies pro
mote an atmosphere of competi
tion between their employees.
According to WebMD, an on
