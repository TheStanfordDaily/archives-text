## Editorial Demand for Big Game buses met 
### 
The Stanford Athletics Department and the
ASSU recently united to provide student
buses to Big Game, which will take place
at UC-Berkeley this year. This is a winning
plan sure to raise Stanford attendance and make
life easier for students.
In the past, the need to find a mode of trans
portation frequently deterred students from at
tending Big Games at Cal. The Athletic Depart
ment's recognition of this problem and its decision
to work with student body representatives to cre
ate a solution indicates the University's quick re
sponsiveness to this matter.
Commuting to Berkeley for Big Game common
ly presents a problem for many Stanford students.
Due to increased amount of traffic on the day of
the event, students who drive must spend extra
time getting across the bay to Berkeley.
Once there, parking is difficult to find, as the
popular event is attended by many football fans
from around the Bay Area.
For these reasons, many Stanford students
choose to watch the game on TV instead of actual
ly going to the game.

By joining forces, the Athletics Department and
the ASSU can collectively acquire funding and ar
range discounts with transportation companies,
making bus rentals cheaper for dorms and ride
tickets less expensive for individuals.
In addition to a subsidy from the Athletics De
partment, this initiative has earned substantial fi
nancial support from University departments as
well as various administrative offices.
In previous years, busing often was only an op
tion open to large dorms consisting mainly of fresh
men. These new changes, however, will allow more
upper-class students who live in other types of
housing to also attend Big Game via buses.
Furthermore, the increased number of buses
this year will ensure public transportation for many
drinking-age upperclassmen, preventing incidents
of drunk driving.
By supplying buses, students who were reluctant
to drive long distances in the past will feel more en
couraged to attend the event this year.
This is a good thing for students, and it's a good
thing for Cardinal football.
