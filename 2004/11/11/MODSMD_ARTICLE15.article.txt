## Acknowledge extraordinary professors 
### JOHN JETT 
Stanford has fabulously accom
plished faculty members. Glance at
the hard numbers: 17 Nobel laure
ates, four Pulitzer Pw/.e winners,
three Presidential Medal of Free
dom recipients, and the list goes on.
Stanford professors shine on the
world stage, and they have the ac
colades to prove it.
Über-prestigious awards, how
ever, generally reward break
through research, not superior ped
agogical prowess.
Sadly, there is no Nobel Prize
for delivering stimulating lectures,
crafting enlightening problem sets
or devoting oneself to advising stu
dents outside of class.
Nonetheless, there are profes
sors at Stanford who excel in pre
cisely those areas. In an ideal
world, they as well would receive
international prizes for their ef
forts. I am here to propose one.
Teaching is a noble profession,
so I will call the award I envision
the Noble Prize. Now that I have
settled on the perfect name, the
question arises: to whom should it
be awarded?
What criteria would students es
tablish to determine a great profes
sor? With shameless immodesty
and in the time-honored tradition
of American unilateralism, I have

appointed myself the sole member
of a committee to ascertain these
criteria.
The first criterion — admittedly
less important than those that fol
low — is that the great professor be
a leader in his or her field. On this
count, fancy awards work nicely, as
does "real world success" — for ex
ample. starting a successful busi
ness. In either case, these creden
tials lend the professor credibility
in the classroom.
The next criterion is that the
great professor invests in her stu
dents' futures. She takes a long
term view, realizing that a future
colleague, innovator or patron
might be a current student.
She treats her students with pro
fessional courtesy, builds symbiotic
relationships — think of Prof. Ter
man with the young Hewlett and
Packard — and consequently
leaves behind a legacy far greater
than her own academic contribu
tions.
Criterion number three: Truly
great professors make their materi
al come alive. They convey their
love of Kant's philosophy or the
Big Bang Theory in lucid yet often
unconventional ways. Their prob
lem sets incorporate outside mate
rial that allows students to relate
theory to practice.
In lecture settings, the great pro

lessor speaks freely, refusing mere
ly to read aloud from her notes as if
a Stanford lecture were no differ
ent than any kindergarten story
time. Great professors realize that
every class is the real thing, not a
trial run, and they pour every ounce
of themselves into teaching.
Finally, great professors do not
make excuses for their students. By
setting high standards, they show
respect for students and them
selves. Under no circumstances do
they accept laziness or lack of
preparation.
They strive to think about old
problems in different ways, and
they harness every mind in their
classroom towards that end. They
give their all and they demand the
same from their students.
Do some professors meeting the
above criteria walk the hallowed
halls of Stanford? No doubt. They
are out there.
As a student, you should cele
brate them. As a professor, you
should strive to emulate them.
They make Stanford the great uni
versity that it is, even if there is not
an international prize to acknowl
edge them.
