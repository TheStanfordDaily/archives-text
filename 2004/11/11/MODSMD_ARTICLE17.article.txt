# Brown and Out
## Who deserves to be here? 
### 
Did you ever wonder if
you deserve to be at
Stanford? And I'm defi
nitely not talking about
wondering if your grades were good
enough, or if someone made a mis
take or anything like that.
No. I'm talking about wondering
if you deserve to be at Stanford
given the fact that others worked so
hard to get you here.
You see, my grandparents are
from Mexico; they came here and

worked really
hard to be able to
give their chil
dren a better life.
Then their chil
dren gave me a
better life — a
middle class life
and I'm forev
er grateful to all
of them.
But it bothers
me that I'm wor-

tied about whether or not it should
be me here. Alter all. I wasn't the
one who sacrificed so much — 1 just
reaped the benefits.
Why is it that while my grand
parents cleaned schools, I was able
to attend a really great one?
It just doesn't seem fair.
On the one hand, my grandfa
ther is really proud of me and happy
to know that I won't have to strug
gle nearly as hard as he did — I'll
always be able to find a job, will
never go hungry and will always be
taken care of.
On the other hand, why wasn't it
him that got to come here? Doesn't
he deserve it more? Me invested his
whole life in everyone else, and I'm
just one more person who benefited
because of it. I've taken so much —
I feel like I have to give something
back.
I find with a lot of students of
color — especially students whose
parents were immigrants — they
feel the need to make the world a
better place, to give back. It's an
other type of justice.
I feel like I have to tip the scale
back to where it was before, to re
store the equilibrium that was dis

turbed when the people who
worked the hardest for everyone
else got the least back for them
selves.
Since everyone else — my
grandparents, my parents, my aunts
and uncles — worked so hard for
me to get here, I have to give some
thing back to them in order to re
store the balance, right?
Isn't that why my fourth grade
teacher read "The Lupine Lady" to
us? So that we would understand
that the world was about more than
just our needs?
And that the world is a great
place with a lot of potential, and it
was our duty to "make the world
more beautiful?"
I like to believe this is true,
though it may not be what my
grandfather would necessarily want
for me. I feel 1 have a debt to pay
(and it's not just to my university
loan sharks).
I feel like I have to justify the
privilege of being a graduate of
Stanford University.
The privilege of being affiliated
with the University is not a right, ei
ther. I feel like we as Stanford stu
dents have the duty to "lead" the
world in better directions.
In a world with over 6 billion
people, being one of a few thousand
with the esteemed privilege of at
tending Stanford University is more
than something to take advantage
of — it's something to change the
world for.
I may have very personal rea
sons why I think it's part of my life's
work to make the world a better
place — my grandfather or Ms.
Brice in fourth grade — but I feel
like it's the right thing to do.
If I can make the world just a lit
tle better, just a little, maybe some
one else's grandfather won't have
to work so hard to make sure that
his granddaughter has the chance to
attend Stanford University.
