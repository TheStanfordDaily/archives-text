## The 						Fundamental Standard's flexibility is its strength 
### LAURETTE BEESON 
I am writing in response to The
Daily's editorial run on Oct. 29,
2004, "Clarify Fundamental Stan
dard." I would like to share some
additional responses sent to the ed
itor that were unfortunately did in
cluded in the editorial.
When asked about the purpose
of the Fundamental Standard I
stated that, "The Fundamental
Standard does not exist to punish
students; instead it requires stu
dents to he thoughtful and ac
countable for their own behavior.
It is also the principle that a Judi
cial Panel will use to determine if a
student's conduct deviates from
the acceptable norms set by the
community. One could argue that
the Fundamental Standard pro
tects us all and allows us to work
and live at Stanford knowing that
others will act with integrity and
treat us with respect."
You should be proud of the fact
that very few students are accused
of, and even fewer found responsi

ble for. violating the Fundamental
Standard. It was noted that the
hope is "that the Fundamental
Standard inspires students to be
good citizens, not only within the
Stanford community but within
our larger society . . . [and that]
most Stanford students act honor
ably and fairly in keeping with
their own ideals" rather than out of
fear of punishment.
The essence of the Fundamental
Standard is its trust that students
will be good citizens. I would hope
that Stanford students would hold
themselves and their neighbors to
the same expectation.
The editorial argues that "the
way things are does not dictate the
way things should be." Indeed, tra
dition alone is a poor rationale for
any system.
But the Fundamental Standard
has remained an integral part of
Stanford's vision of itself for over
100 years not merely because of its
historical significance but because
of its continued usefulness for the
Stanford community.

The charge levied against the
Fundamental Standard, that its
"vague notions" leave students
vulnerable to "interpretation de
pending on each case" fails to rec
ognize that the central strength of
the Fundamental Standard is its
openness.
The Fundamental Standard in
18% could not have anticipated
some of the recent questions
about, among other things, illegal
file-sharing and DMCA com
plaints. or the theft and unautho
rized use of golf carts, disabled
parking privilege, or secure net
work resources. Judicial Hearing
Panels, however, are empowered
to consider whether such actions
disdain the shared ideal that a
Stanford student possess a "respect
for order, morality, personal honor
and the rights of others."
The flexibility of the Funda
mental Standard allows the exist
ing community to define contem
porary values and needs in the con
text of a distinguished, historical
tradition.

I encourage anyone who wants
clarification made about the Fun
damental Standard to be specific
about what needs to be clarified.
Before doing so. I encourage you
to take the time to familiarize
yourself with the Student Judicial
Charter of 1997 and the judicial
process as outlined on the Judicial
Affairs website.
These principles and the Char
ter itself are very relevant given the
editor's concern that the Funda
mental Standard is "convenient for
judicial officers." Neither the Fun
damental Standard nor the Judicial
Charter exists for the convenience
of Judicial Panels or the judicial of
ficer. Rather, the judicial officer
and the Judicial Panel exist to up
hold the standards of the commu
nity.
Finally. I would like to invite
any member of the Stanford com
munity who has any specific rec
ommendations for clarifying the
Fundamental Standard or improv
ing the judicial process, via either
policy changes and / or educational

efforts, to contact the Board on Ju
dicial Affairs.
You may send your suggestions
to the Office of Judicial Affairs (ju
dicialaffairs@stanford.edu) or di
rectly to the Co-Chairs, Eric
Roberts (eroberts@cs.Stanford,
edu) or Brian Chang (hrianychang
@stanford.cdu).
Anyone interested in becoming
a member of the Board on Judicial
Affairs (that promulgates judicial
policy and oversees the Office of
Judicial Affairs) or the Judicial
Panel Pool (from which judicial
panels are drawn) should contact
either the Office of Judicial Affairs
or the appropriate body directly.
Students apply through the ASSU
Nominations Commission. Faculty
are appointed by the Committee
on Committees and the staff are
appointed by the provost.

Laurette Beeson is the assistant dean
of Students / judicial advisor. She
