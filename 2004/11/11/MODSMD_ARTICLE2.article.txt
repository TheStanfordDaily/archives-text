# GSC fills four Const. Council seats
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO 
In a unanimous vote last night,
the Graduate Student Council ap
proved four nominees to the
ASSIi Constitutional Council.
These new members, who were
given the green light by the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate on Tues
day, will fill the four open seats on
the Constitutional Council that
have been vacant since May.
According to GSC Chair Mori
ah Thompson, the Constitutional
Council is "the Supreme Court at
Stanford." Since last spring, when
three Council members resigned
for personal reasons, it has consist
ed solely of Council Chair Bill
Curry, a fourth-year doctoral can
didate in geophysics. As a result,
the Council has been three mem
bers short of quorum and unable
to hear cases regarding violations
of the ASSU Constitution.

The nomination process for the
four new Council members,
sophomores Monica Uddin and
Justin Liu, first-year Law School
student Jenny Allen and first-year
Graduate School of Business stu
dent Patrick Crosetto, was rigor
ous, the nominees said. To ensure
fairness in the selection process,
the Senate created an independent
Constitutional Council Selection
Committee to nominate candi
dates to fill the four vacancies.
Once this committee was
formed, it narrowed down the pool
of 12 applicants to four nominees,
who were then interviewed by the
Senate and GSC on Monday and
voted upon on Tuesday and
Wednesday, respectively.
Uddin said she believes that the
job of the Constitutional Council is
to be nonpartisan.
"We tend to view ourselves as a
forum for arbitrating constitution
al disputes," she said. "But |we

are] not to be extremely activist in
nature or to rewrite the Constitu
tion."
Liu agreed with this view and
argued that the Constitutional
Council is mostly a passive body.
"Our job is pretty limited —
which is good since Stanford has
an executive and legislative body
already and they should be creat
ing the policy to advocate for the
students," he said. "We should just
be ensuring that they both stay
within the confines of the Consti
tution."
Despite there being only one
returning member, the new ap
pointees said they are optimistic
about the future of the Constitu
tional Council.

and we will have to go through ad
ministrative processes," Liu said.
"| But| we're all at a really good
start."
Allen agreed with this view and
said she felt that there already exists
a good relationship among the new
members of the Council.
"I see a lot of energy here and the
group is very excited about going
ahead and being an independent
body that can quickly adjudicate
cases for the student body," she said.
"We've gone through all of the
meetings together. 1 think it's im
portant to have a relationship where
you can openly communicate.
"But I think that we also don't
have a 'group-think' mentality,"

Allen continued. "Even though
we're comfortable with each other,
we're not intimidated to speak our
minds."
Liu said his primary concern is to
serve the interests of the student
body.
"We're definitely still serving stu
dent interests," he said. "Student in
terests are best served by an impar
tial. lair, and rigorous enforcement
of the Constitution."
Allen agreed.
"I'm very honored to be in this
position, and I hope to serve the stu
dent body as best as I can during my
time as a Constitutional Council
member," she said.
