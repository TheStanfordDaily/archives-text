## Cardinal struggle to keep up with Bears 
### SAMUEL CHEN 
In the only triple-distance meet of the season for
the No. 4 Stanford men's swim team, the Cardinal
faced their first true competition yesterday, taking
on California at the Avery Aquatic Center.
The Bears, tied at No. 4 with the Cardinal, may
have shown that they should be ranked higher, win
ning 12 of the afternoon's 20 events.
Needless to say, Cal gave the Cardinal a much
tougher challenge during the non-team scoring meet
than did Cal State-Bakersfield — whom Stanford re
soundingly defeated Friday.
With each swimmer competing in a sequence of
three events in a specific stroke prior to the two-med
ley finale, this was a chance for all swimmers to test
their ability to compete in a range of distances.
"This meet should give the freshmen confidence
in their ability to swim fast in season," said junior
Nick Wolfe prior to the meet.
For the butterfly competitors, senior co-captain
Matt McDonald and freshman Daniel Beal took the

first two spots in all three events, with McDonald fin
ishing in the top overall position with a combined
time of 3:04.57 for the 50-, 100- and 200-yard swims.
Beal finished right behind him with a combined time
of 3:05.38.
The next closest competitor was Cal's freshman
Justin Pollard, finishing two seconds behind Beal.
Stanford's third competitor in the set, freshman
Peter Carothers, finished fourth.
Sophomore Hongzhe Sun and senior co-captain
Jayme Cramer led the field in the backstroke set —
the only two to break the three- minute mark in their
total times. Sun finished first at 2:57.38 and Cramer
squeezed in at 2:59.99. The third and last competitor
for the Cardinal backstroke contingent, sophomore
Kyle Ransom, finished further back in the field with
his three swims totaling 3:15.20.
After tremendous success by the Cardinal in the
first two strokes, the Cal swimmers turned it on: the
Bears took overall firsts in the next four sets, starting
with breaststroke.
Despite the first-place finish in the 50-yard breast

event by Stanford's junior Ricky Eddy, the top two
overall spots went to Cal junior Henrique Barbosa
and sophomore Graham Lentz, with Barbosa finish
ing with the winning composite time of 3:25.35.
The top Stanford finisher in the category was se
nior Gary Marshall, who clocked an aggregate time
of 3:29.18. Eddy ended up completing his last three
swims at 3:33.80.
The competition continued with Cal wins in the
sprint and distance freestyle categories.
The top composite time in the 50-, 100- and 200-
yard set was turned in by Rolandis Gimbutis at
2:43.42. Cardinal sophomores Andy Grant and Ben
Wildman-Tobriner turned in strong performances,
as Grant finished just under three seconds behind the
leader, and Wildman-Tobriner came in fourth,
clocking in at 2:50.82.
In the 200-, 500- and 1000-yard freestyle category,
sophomore Shaun Phillips finished in third-place,
just over 10 seconds behind the winner, Cal's Daniel
