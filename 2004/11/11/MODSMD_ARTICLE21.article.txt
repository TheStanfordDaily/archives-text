# Win over SC has Card flying high
## Women look good after various aspects of game come together 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fresh off a dominating victory over
then- No. 4 Southern California, the Cardi
nal are flying high. After playing their best
match of the season, the No. 11 Cardinal
(16-6, 8-3 Pacific-10 Conference) head
north this weekend to take on Oregon
Thursday night and Oregon State on Fri
day night.
Stanford is now in a tie with the Women
of Troy for second place in the conference.
Meanwhile, the Oregon Ducks enter
with a 9-14 record overall, last in the Pac-10
at 1-12. Oregon State has not fared much
better this year, coming in at 10-12 overall,
tied with Arizona State for seventh in the
conference at 4-9. The two teams will face a
Stanford squad that is at its deadliest, hav
ing finally clicked on all cylinders simulta
neously last weekend.
"I don't know; no one can explain it,"ju
nior libero Courtney Schultz said. "All of a
sudden everything clicked. It's hard to
make it happen every game, but if it does,
we're pretty much unstoppable."
Schultz and the rest of the Cardinal de
fense were a huge reason that the team so
quickly and completely demolished a pow
erful Trojan team right after grinding out a
tough victory over No. 16 UCLA (15-8, 8-
5). The five-game match — the seventh of
this season to go to a decisive fifth — gave
Stanford confidence heading into Saturday
night's tilt against USC.
"I think that the night before was really
critical, and that UCLA played very well,"
head coach John Dunning said. "In order to
beat USC you have to believe you can beat
them. We played tough against both teams,
we played good defense, and our offense
worked better. Against UCLA, we played
real tough in game five, and that led to con
fidence in our next match. We were really
loose."
The defense flew around the court at
times, digging the ball extremely well, often
leaving the ground and making contact in
midair with backs turned to the net.
At the net. sophomore middle blocker
Lizzie Suiter and freshman middle blocker
Franci Girard destroyed opponents' at
tacks, especially against taller Trojan mid
dle Emily Adams.
"What made Franci and I effective was
our system of commit blocking," Suiter

said. "(USC] is not used to seeing a block
up early. Even though they are experienced
middles, they're not used to that, and we
took advantage of it."
Suiter and Girard each had five blocks
of Stanford's 20, twice as many as the Tro
jans were able to muster against the Cardi
nal attack — an attack which matched the
defense in intensity.
Led by sophomore outside hitter Kristin
Richards, who came alive for 23 kills on Fri
day and added 11 on Saturday for her most
productive weekend of the year, the team
never hit less than .350 fora single game.
The Cardinal even hit over .400 for the
match against USC.
"Kristin played unbelievably because
she knew how big the block was going to be

and tooled the block to her advantage by
swinging high," Suiter said.
"[Richards] wants to win." Dunning
added. "She wants to be a great player. At
some point you just get more motivated.
You just have to dig down and go for it
more, and that's what she's doing. She's
learning and being extremely focused."
Besides the awakening Richards, the
Cardinal also got 27 kills from Pac-10 Play
er of the Week Ogonna Nnamani.
Turning back to the upcoming match,
the Cardinal have a historical edge on this
weekend's competition.
Stanford has never lost to Oregon State,
holding a 37-0 all-time edge. Against Ore
gon. the Cardinal have lost twice (35-2), but
not in their last 30 matches.

No matter who they are playing, howev
er. if the Stanford team that showed up last
week continues to play at such a high cal
iber. it will be difficult to beat.
"It's a team that can beat anyone."
Suiter said. "No matter how the other
team plays, if we play like that, we can
beat anyone."
"I don't know where the team is on a na
tional scale," Dunning added. "We showed
ourselves we can beat anybody. If we just
keep working at getting better, then that's a
good sign for us. We tried really hard this
week and haven't settled for it. We certain
ly have more confidence; we can be in the
game with anyone.
"Our team is starting to get a smile on its
face."

tacks, especially against taller Trojan mid
dle Emily Adams.
"What made Franci and I effective was
our system of commit blocking," Suiter

said. "(USC] is not used to seeing a block
up early. Even though they are experienced
middles, they're not used to that, and we
took advantage of it."
Suiter and Girard each had five blocks
of Stanford's 20, twice as many as the Tro
jans were able to muster against the Cardi
nal attack — an attack which matched the
defense in intensity.
Led by sophomore outside hitter Kristin
Richards, who came alive for 23 kills on Fri
day and added 11 on Saturday for her most
productive weekend of the year, the team
never hit less than .350 fora single game.
The Cardinal even hit over .400 for the
match against USC.
"Kristin played unbelievably because
she knew how big the block was going to be

and tooled the block to her advantage by
swinging high," Suiter said.
"[Richards] wants to win." Dunning
added. "She wants to be a great player. At
some point you just get more motivated.
You just have to dig down and go for it
more, and that's what she's doing. She's
learning and being extremely focused."
Besides the awakening Richards, the
Cardinal also got 27 kills from Pac-10 Play
er of the Week Ogonna Nnamani.
Turning back to the upcoming match,
the Cardinal have a historical edge on this
weekend's competition.
Stanford has never lost to Oregon State,
holding a 37-0 all-time edge. Against Ore
gon. the Cardinal have lost twice (35-2), but
not in their last 30 matches.

No matter who they are playing, howev
er. if the Stanford team that showed up last
week continues to play at such a high cal
iber. it will be difficult to beat.
"It's a team that can beat anyone."
Suiter said. "No matter how the other
team plays, if we play like that, we can
beat anyone."
"I don't know where the team is on a na
tional scale," Dunning added. "We showed
ourselves we can beat anybody. If we just
keep working at getting better, then that's a
good sign for us. We tried really hard this
week and haven't settled for it. We certain
ly have more confidence; we can be in the
game with anyone.
"Our team is starting to get a smile on its
face."

If freshmen middle blocker Franci Girard, setter Bryn Kehoe and tfie rest of tfie Cardinal squad can replilcate last week's performance
against USC , Oregon and Oregon State shouldn't be hard to handle this week.
Fresh off a dominating victory over
then- No. 4 Southern California, the Cardi
nal are flying high. After playing their best
match of the season, the No. 11 Cardinal
(16-6, 8-3 Pacific-10 Conference) head
north this weekend to take on Oregon
Thursday night and Oregon State on Fri
day night.
Stanford is now in a tie with the Women
of Troy for second place in the conference.
Meanwhile, the Oregon Ducks enter
with a 9-14 record overall, last in the Pac-10
at 1-12. Oregon State has not fared much
better this year, coming in at 10-12 overall,
tied with Arizona State for seventh in the
conference at 4-9. The two teams will face a
Stanford squad that is at its deadliest, hav
ing finally clicked on all cylinders simulta
neously last weekend.
"I don't know; no one can explain it,"ju
nior libero Courtney Schultz said. "All of a
sudden everything clicked. It's hard to
make it happen every game, but if it does,
we're pretty much unstoppable."
Schultz and the rest of the Cardinal de
fense were a huge reason that the team so
quickly and completely demolished a pow
erful Trojan team right after grinding out a
tough victory over No. 16 UCLA (15-8, 8-
5). The five-game match — the seventh of
this season to go to a decisive fifth — gave
Stanford confidence heading into Saturday
night's tilt against USC.
"I think that the night before was really
critical, and that UCLA played very well,"
head coach John Dunning said. "In order to
beat USC you have to believe you can beat
them. We played tough against both teams,
we played good defense, and our offense
worked better. Against UCLA, we played
real tough in game five, and that led to con
fidence in our next match. We were really
loose."
The defense flew around the court at
times, digging the ball extremely well, often
leaving the ground and making contact in
midair with backs turned to the net.
At the net. sophomore middle blocker
Lizzie Suiter and freshman middle blocker
Franci Girard destroyed opponents' at
tacks, especially against taller Trojan mid
dle Emily Adams.
"What made Franci and I effective was
our system of commit blocking," Suiter

said. "(USC] is not used to seeing a block
up early. Even though they are experienced
middles, they're not used to that, and we
took advantage of it."
