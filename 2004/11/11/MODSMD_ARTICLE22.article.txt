# Scars optional: rough roading with Stanford cycling club
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Skiing down a black diamond slope just
isn't enough of an adrenaline rush for the
Stanford cycling club. Instead, they ride
mountain bikes down these slopes — in the
off-season, when all the rocks, roots and
drops are still exposed.
"Some dual slalom courses have 20-foot
jumps, and lots of opportunities for riders
to get tangled up." said senior Rafer Wil
lenberg. "Downhill courses sometimes
have five-foot drops and the most insane
terrain that you could imagine. Courses go
through dry waterfalls, meaning they ride
over the rocks that would otherwise make
a waterfall."
The rugged terrain of competition
courses almost guarantees a pileup of
bloody injuries. However, rather than scar
ing these athletes away, the danger of the
sport creates an adrenaline rush that keeps
them coming back for more.
"Probably the most enduring memory
thnt I'll have is regaining consciousness
after beefing the final jump of a race and
landing on my head." said sophomore

Theo Huzyk. "I see all these unfamiliar
people standing around me. and I have no
recollection of where I was or what day it
was. Soon after. I find myself strapped onto
a stretcher and loaded into a helicopter.
"Lying there, as I 'm getting one of those
thick-gauged IVs jabbed into my arm. all I
can think is, 'holy crap. "
In dual slalom races, two riders race
down a course parallel to each other, ma
neuvering through turns and jumps. The
competition is organized in brackets, and
one rider is eliminated after each race until
the winner is determined. For downhill
races, the course is run individually, and
the fastest time wins.
Dual slalom and downhill competitions
are only two types of mountain bike races,
but they are distinctive in that neither re
quires pedaling very hard.
"I came to Stanford for Admit Week
end. and I learned that there was a cycling
team." Willenberg said. "I learned that on
this team there was downhill racing, with
the uphill excluded. To me. this included all
the most fun aspects of biking, without the
sacrifice and pain of going uphill. Imagine
riding a ski lift to the top of a trail!"

The other types of mountain bike races
are cross-country and short-track cross
country. Cyclists who dislike the extreme
jumps and drops of the dual slalom and
downhill often prefer these races instead.
Cross-country races consist of two to
four laps around a roughly six-mile course.
The biggest jump or drop on a cross coun
try course is no more than two feet. These
races typically last around an hour or two.
with the winner being the first person to
finish.
Alternatively, in short-track cross-coun
try. the winner is the person who completes
the most laps. These laps are shorter, about
one mile long. They are also much less tech
nical than the regular cross-country course,
with no steep climbs or descents.
"Mountain biking is unlike most other
sports in that good physical conditioning
can only take you so far; the tricky terrain
throws in a real variable," Huzyk said.
Although this may seem daunting at
first, it also means that beginners willing to
give it a shot are more than welcome. As
the competitions are divided by gender, the
cycling club particularly needs more
women.

In the men's competitions, there are
three levels, "expert," "sport," and "begin
ner." The women's division is divided into
only two categories, due to the smaller
number of female mountain bikers.
In the top bracket of both male and fe
male races, there will generally be a few
professional bikers.
This makes for difficult competition,
but the Stanford cyclists gamely step up to
the challenge. Most women on the team
compete in the "expert" division, and
most men on the team compete in the
"sport" division.
Due to the need for off-season ski
slopes, the mountain biking season ends
before Thanksgiving. In fact. Nationals are
held before the end of the season to avoid
any chance of snow.
When the mountain biking season ends,
the road season begins, running February
through May. Many members of the cy
cling club choose to compete only in road
races.
As with mountain bike races, there are
four different types of road races. The generic road
race is an endurance event, lasting anywhere from
two to four hours. A criterium is a 30- to 90-minute
race held on a short track. Criteriums, due to their
shorter length and frequent turns, are extremely
fast and require skillful hike handling.
Both road races and criteriums are "mass start"
events, where all the cyclists race in a pack. This re
quires tight control of the hike while riding at fast
speeds.
"Unlike what many might think, road racing is
as much a game of strategy as it is a test of fitness,"
said grad student Ueyn Block. "Being able to con
serve energy by riding in the slipstream of racers
ahead of you is very important. This makes for
very tactical races, as you must make on-the-fly de
cisions about whether forming and working with a
particular group of racers is a wise move."
The other two types of road races are the indi
vidual and team time trials. These are races against
the clock, where strategy is not much of a factor.
The road racing squad has quite an impressive
record. In the past 10 years, it has won Nationals
three times and has produced seven All-Ameri
cans. Three of its alums are Olympians: Christine
Thorburn, Derek Bouchard-Hall, and Nicole
Freedman.
Club members are not required to compete in
either mountain bike or road races, but team dues
are $50 a quarter or $120 a year.
Sponsorships and discounts are only one in
centive to join the club; for many bikers, the most
important part of being in the cycling club is the
camaraderie of fellow students who enjoy the
sport.
"I grew up always trying to see what I could
ride over or through with my hike. I spent a lot of
time on university campuses playing around on
flights of stairs and other obstacles," Huzyk said.

"To see that there are people out here that em
brace this and put the skills to use in actual races
is probably the biggest factor that draws me to
compete."
Cycling is a sport where group practices are
vital, as training together helps make each rider
more competitive. Thus, the club has practice rides
leaving from the post office at 3:30 p.m. every
weekday and 9 a.m. on weekends. Mountain bik
ers carpool off-campus to practice on more rugged
terrain.
As a result, the club members have developed a
strong sense of team unity.
"Road racing is more of a team sport and a tac
tical sport than a naive spectator thinks," said grad
student ( handra Nair. "The best memories are al
ways of camaraderie and long trips and sacrifices
people make in races just to help your teammates
win."
Grad student Daniel McGarry agreed, saying
that the commutes to competitions and the friend
ship among teammates on the course make the
sport particularly worthwhile.
"Once when I crashed badly in a race, two
teammates slopped in the middle of their race to
help me out," McGarry said.
The Stanford cyclists also have fond memories
of team bonding when they least expected it.
"Returning from Conference Championships
in Reno my freshman year, a major snowstorm hit.
and 1-80 was closed down while we were still on the
highway," Willenberg said. "1 built a snowman on
the freeway. It snowed nearly two feet that night.
Our bikes were frozen to the roof rack of the car.
The picture of us digging out the car with wheels
on the roof looks fantastic."

Theo Huzyk. "I see all these unfamiliar

In dual slalom races, two riders race
down a course parallel to each other, ma
neuvering through turns and jumps. The
competition is organized in brackets, and
one rider is eliminated after each race until
the winner is determined. For downhill
races, the course is run individually, and
the fastest time wins.
Dual slalom and downhill competitions
are only two types of mountain bike races,
but they are distinctive in that neither re
quires pedaling very hard.
"I came to Stanford for Admit Week
end. and I learned that there was a cycling
team." Willenberg said. "I learned that on
this team there was downhill racing, with
the uphill excluded. To me. this included all
the most fun aspects of biking, without the
sacrifice and pain of going uphill. Imagine
riding a ski lift to the top of a trail!"

The other types of mountain bike races
are cross-country and short-track cross
country. Cyclists who dislike the extreme
jumps and drops of the dual slalom and
downhill often prefer these races instead.
Cross-country races consist of two to
four laps around a roughly six-mile course.
The biggest jump or drop on a cross coun
try course is no more than two feet. These
races typically last around an hour or two.
with the winner being the first person to
finish.
Alternatively, in short-track cross-coun
try. the winner is the person who completes
the most laps. These laps are shorter, about
one mile long. They are also much less tech
nical than the regular cross-country course,
with no steep climbs or descents.
"Mountain biking is unlike most other
sports in that good physical conditioning
can only take you so far; the tricky terrain
throws in a real variable," Huzyk said.
Although this may seem daunting at
first, it also means that beginners willing to
give it a shot are more than welcome. As
the competitions are divided by gender, the
cycling club particularly needs more
women.

In the men's competitions, there are
three levels, "expert," "sport," and "begin
ner." The women's division is divided into
only two categories, due to the smaller
number of female mountain bikers.
In the top bracket of both male and fe
male races, there will generally be a few
professional bikers.
This makes for difficult competition,
but the Stanford cyclists gamely step up to
the challenge. Most women on the team
compete in the "expert" division, and
most men on the team compete in the
"sport" division.
Due to the need for off-season ski
slopes, the mountain biking season ends
before Thanksgiving. In fact. Nationals are
held before the end of the season to avoid
any chance of snow.
When the mountain biking season ends,
the road season begins, running February
through May. Many members of the cy
cling club choose to compete only in road
races.
As with mountain bike races, there are
four different types of road races. The generic road
race is an endurance event, lasting anywhere from
two to four hours. A criterium is a 30- to 90-minute
race held on a short track. Criteriums, due to their
shorter length and frequent turns, are extremely
fast and require skillful hike handling.
Both road races and criteriums are "mass start"
events, where all the cyclists race in a pack. This re
quires tight control of the hike while riding at fast
speeds.
"Unlike what many might think, road racing is
as much a game of strategy as it is a test of fitness,"
said grad student Ueyn Block. "Being able to con
serve energy by riding in the slipstream of racers
ahead of you is very important. This makes for
very tactical races, as you must make on-the-fly de
cisions about whether forming and working with a
particular group of racers is a wise move."
The other two types of road races are the indi
vidual and team time trials. These are races against
the clock, where strategy is not much of a factor.
The road racing squad has quite an impressive
record. In the past 10 years, it has won Nationals
three times and has produced seven All-Ameri
cans. Three of its alums are Olympians: Christine
Thorburn, Derek Bouchard-Hall, and Nicole
Freedman.
Club members are not required to compete in
either mountain bike or road races, but team dues
are $50 a quarter or $120 a year.
Sponsorships and discounts are only one in
centive to join the club; for many bikers, the most
important part of being in the cycling club is the
camaraderie of fellow students who enjoy the
sport.
"I grew up always trying to see what I could
ride over or through with my hike. I spent a lot of
time on university campuses playing around on
flights of stairs and other obstacles," Huzyk said.

"To see that there are people out here that em
brace this and put the skills to use in actual races
is probably the biggest factor that draws me to
compete."
Cycling is a sport where group practices are
vital, as training together helps make each rider
more competitive. Thus, the club has practice rides
leaving from the post office at 3:30 p.m. every
weekday and 9 a.m. on weekends. Mountain bik
ers carpool off-campus to practice on more rugged
terrain.
As a result, the club members have developed a
strong sense of team unity.
"Road racing is more of a team sport and a tac
tical sport than a naive spectator thinks," said grad
student ( handra Nair. "The best memories are al
ways of camaraderie and long trips and sacrifices
people make in races just to help your teammates
win."
Grad student Daniel McGarry agreed, saying
that the commutes to competitions and the friend
ship among teammates on the course make the
sport particularly worthwhile.
"Once when I crashed badly in a race, two
teammates slopped in the middle of their race to
help me out," McGarry said.
The Stanford cyclists also have fond memories
of team bonding when they least expected it.
"Returning from Conference Championships
in Reno my freshman year, a major snowstorm hit.
and 1-80 was closed down while we were still on the
highway," Willenberg said. "1 built a snowman on
the freeway. It snowed nearly two feet that night.
Our bikes were frozen to the roof rack of the car.
The picture of us digging out the car with wheels
on the roof looks fantastic."

Skiing down a black diamond slope just
isn't enough of an adrenaline rush for the
Stanford cycling club. Instead, they ride
mountain bikes down these slopes — in the
off-season, when all the rocks, roots and
drops are still exposed.
"Some dual slalom courses have 20-foot
jumps, and lots of opportunities for riders
to get tangled up." said senior Rafer Wil
lenberg. "Downhill courses sometimes
have five-foot drops and the most insane
terrain that you could imagine. Courses go
through dry waterfalls, meaning they ride
over the rocks that would otherwise make
a waterfall."
The rugged terrain of competition
courses almost guarantees a pileup of
bloody injuries. However, rather than scar
ing these athletes away, the danger of the
sport creates an adrenaline rush that keeps
them coming back for more.
