# Scars optional: rough roading with Stanford cycling club
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Skiing down a black diamond slope just
isn't enough of an adrenaline rush for the
Stanford cycling club. Instead, they ride
mountain bikes down these slopes â€” in the
off-season, when all the rocks, roots and
drops are still exposed.
"Some dual slalom courses have 20-foot
jumps, and lots of opportunities for riders
to get tangled up." said senior Rafer Wil
lenberg. "Downhill courses sometimes
have five-foot drops and the most insane
terrain that you could imagine. Courses go
through dry waterfalls, meaning they ride
over the rocks that would otherwise make
a waterfall."
The rugged terrain of competition
courses almost guarantees a pileup of
bloody injuries. However, rather than scar
ing these athletes away, the danger of the
sport creates an adrenaline rush that keeps
them coming back for more.
"Probably the most enduring memory
thnt I'll have is regaining consciousness
after beefing the final jump of a race and
landing on my head." said sophomore

Theo Huzyk. "I see all these unfamiliar
people standing around me. and I have no
recollection of where I was or what day it
was. Soon after. I find myself strapped onto
a stretcher and loaded into a helicopter.
"Lying there, as I 'm getting one of those
thick-gauged IVs jabbed into my arm. all I
can think is, 'holy crap. "
In dual slalom races, two riders race
down a course parallel to each other, ma
neuvering through turns and jumps. The
competition is organized in brackets, and
one rider is eliminated after each race until
the winner is determined. For downhill
races, the course is run individually, and
the fastest time wins.
Dual slalom and downhill competitions
are only two types of mountain bike races,
but they are distinctive in that neither re
quires pedaling very hard.
"I came to Stanford for Admit Week
end. and I learned that there was a cycling
team." Willenberg said. "I learned that on
this team there was downhill racing, with
the uphill excluded. To me. this included all
the most fun aspects of biking, without the
sacrifice and pain of going uphill. Imagine
riding a ski lift to the top of a trail!"

The other types of mountain bike races
are cross-country and short-track cross
country. Cyclists who dislike the extreme
jumps and drops of the dual slalom and
downhill often prefer these races instead.
Cross-country races consist of two to
four laps around a roughly six-mile course.
The biggest jump or drop on a cross coun
try course is no more than two feet. These
races typically last around an hour or two.
with the winner being the first person to
finish.
Alternatively, in short-track cross-coun
try. the winner is the person who completes
the most laps. These laps are shorter, about
one mile long. They are also much less tech
nical than the regular cross-country course,
with no steep climbs or descents.
"Mountain biking is unlike most other
sports in that good physical conditioning
can only take you so far; the tricky terrain
throws in a real variable," Huzyk said.
Although this may seem daunting at
first, it also means that beginners willing to
give it a shot are more than welcome. As
the competitions are divided by gender, the
cycling club particularly needs more
women.

In the men's competitions, there are
three levels, "expert," "sport," and "begin
ner." The women's division is divided into
only two categories, due to the smaller
number of female mountain bikers.
In the top bracket of both male and fe
male races, there will generally be a few
professional bikers.
This makes for difficult competition,
but the Stanford cyclists gamely step up to
the challenge. Most women on the team
compete in the "expert" division, and
most men on the team compete in the
"sport" division.
Due to the need for off-season ski
slopes, the mountain biking season ends
before Thanksgiving. In fact. Nationals are
held before the end of the season to avoid
any chance of snow.
When the mountain biking season ends,
the road season begins, running February
through May. Many members of the cy
cling club choose to compete only in road
races.
As with mountain bike races, there are
