# The
						Double Clutch
## With the NHL out, the face of hockey is utterly unfamiliar 
### CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON 
While undertaking "research" recent
ly, the Double Clutch wandered
upon hockey highlights on Sports-
Center. 1 watched the usual skating and
checking and saw nothing odd until the final
score flashed on the screen: "New Hampshire
4. Boston University 3."
"Wait a minute." I said to the coffee table.
"Since when is college hockey on ESPN? I've
never seen them admit that it even existed."
And then it came to me. There's no Na
tional Hockey League.
See, the NHL owners said that the players
were being paid too much (which was prob
ably true). And the players said that the
owners were hoarding profits and investing
in unprofitable teams (which was also prob
ably true).
The owners reacted by taking their Zam
bonis and going home, halting league play
(technically known as a "lockout.") Basket
ball did one of these a few years back, and it
gave us the Lakers dynasty, though I will leave
the judgment of that up to the reader.
It looks as though the chickens came home
to roost on a bad gamble by Gary Bettman.
The league's commissioner built new franchis
es in non-hockey cities (Nashville. Atlanta.
Miami) and moved Canadian franchises to the
United States (Quebec to Colorado, Win
nipeg to Phoenix).
Low hockey interest in those places would
supposedly be offset by television revenue,
but as hockey is not particularly dynamic on
TV, viewership was not high enough to put
these teams in the black. (It's hard to watch
NHL hockey even if you want to, but we'll get
to that later.)
I really do feel for the inventors of the
game â€” the neighbors to the north.
Word wafted down that Canada's baseball
fans were deeply offended by the 1994 play
ers' strike. This was allegedly a prime factor in
the fall of the once-dominant Toronto Blue
Jays.
What is their reaction now that the NHL
has stripped them of two franchises and has in
flated salaries to the point where the teams
still relying on the Canadian dollar can't hope
to compete, all in the name of strengthening
their national sport?
I mean, they can't even watch notoriously
flamboyant hockey analyst Don Cherry, for
Pete's sake!
So what are we frozen-pond people left
with? Wisconsin vs. Minnesota. Michigan-
Michigan State. Maine, New Hampshire, and
Boston's Beanpot Tournament. And North
Dakota's Fighting Sioux.
All the pageanted glory we at Stanford
know from football and basketball is there in
collegiate hockey up north. A young, well-lu
bricated college crowd in one of these hotbeds
makes an NHL arena look like a Zen
monastery. Mascots slip and fall on the ice to
raucous cheers.
NCAA hockey may not be the most skilled
version of the game. 1 certainly wouldn't want
my college team to get involved with. say. the
Ukranian Junior Nationals or a Canadian club
team.
But it's got a leg up on today's NHL.
whose game plans seem to involve "someone
get the puck and try to take it all the way" for
the offense and "everybody form a scrum in
front of the net" for the defense. It resem
bles less and less the freeform game played
on natural ice all across the northern border
every winter.
Like its basketball and football counter
parts, the college game is much more fluid,
winning with finesse and teamwork in addi
tion to pure skill and brawn
