### ALIYYA HAQUE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On the heels of last week's presi
dential election, some students spent
Tuesday dressed in black to express
their disapproval of the election re
sults as part of a nationwide protest
called "Mourning the Vote." Most
students, however, did not partici
pate in the event; some said they did
not receive detailed information
about the event and others argued
that it would be ineffective.
According its Web site, the na
tional "Mourning the Vote" cam
paign was established as a platform
for those individuals unhappy with
the outcome of the election to unite
together and show their discontent
with last week's results.
"This demonstration is not an at

tempt to discredit the election or to
dispute it,"event organizers said on
their Web site. "We are only trying
to give expression to thoughts which
aren't being heard and to try and get
those around us to think about the
consequences of their actions."
Event organizers also asked
"Mourning the Vote" participants
to wear black for the entire week, if
possible.
Stanford students who participat
ed in "Mourning the Vote" said they
did not know who or what groups
had organized the event on campus.
They said they learned about the
movement from e-mails that circu
lated through dorm lists.
