# Students don black to protest election results
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On the heels of last week's presi
dential election, some students spent
Tuesday dressed in black to express
their disapproval of the election re
sults as part of a nationwide protest
called "Mourning the Vote." Most
students, however, did not partici
pate in the event; some said they did
not receive detailed information
about the event and others argued
that it would be ineffective.
According its Web site, the na
tional "Mourning the Vote" cam
paign was established as a platform
for those individuals unhappy with
the outcome of the election to unite
together and show their discontent
with last week's results.
"This demonstration is not an at

tempt to discredit the election or to
dispute it,"event organizers said on
their Web site. "We are only trying
to give expression to thoughts which
aren't being heard and to try and get
those around us to think about the
consequences of their actions."
Event organizers also asked
"Mourning the Vote" participants
to wear black for the entire week, if
possible.
Stanford students who participat
ed in "Mourning the Vote" said they
did not know who or what groups
had organized the event on campus.
They said they learned about the
movement from e-mails that circu
lated through dorm lists.

learned about the event through his
dorm chat list and decided to wear a
black shirt and sports coat for the
day.
"1 got the e-mail going around
and thought it would be a good way
to express my political beliefs and
disappointment with the results of
the election," he said.
Conservatives on campus were
skeptical about the effectiveness of
the event. Senior Alex Moore, opin
ions editor for the Stanford Review,
was initially dismayed at the "de
pressing" nature of the event, but
came to view it as a demonstration of
free speech and a harmless way for
Democrats to express their frustra
tion with the election.

"I do understand why people felt
such a huge letdown," he said. "This
president will likely choose three
Supreme Court Justices, finish the
|institution| of Iraq's democracy and
[reform] with Social Security policy.
1 think what also hurts the Democ
rats was losing seats in the Senate, so
I think mourning over losses on all
levels was appropriate."
Although "Mourning the Vote"
was targeted toward a mostly Demo
cratic and progressive crowd, several
students who support Sen. John
Kerry, who was defeated in the pres
idential election, were adamant
about not participating in Tuesday's
event.
Sophomore David Cohen, who

voted for Kerry in last week's elec
tion, did not approve of "Mourning
the Vote" because he felt that the
event itself was set up for the wrong
reasons.
"I think the people who mourned
the vote have a general dissatisfac
tion in the democratic process just
because they don't like how it turned
out," he said. "1 voted for Kerry but
decided not to wear black, since by
taking the election process to the
level of mourning, it's akin to some
horrible tragedy like death. 1 still
have faith in the democratic process,
which is more important than the re
sults, and is how we can have a dif
ferent administration in the next
four years."
