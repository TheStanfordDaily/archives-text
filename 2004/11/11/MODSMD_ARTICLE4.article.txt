# Students honor veterans, peace

### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Mel Pointer was a Vietnam veter
an from Oakland who read the
newspaper everyday and loved to
watch football. Senior Laurel Stew
art is a Stanford student from Ore
gon who majors in American Studies
and enjoys baking organic chocolate
chip cookies.
The two met and became close
friends three years ago at the Menlo
Park Veterans' Affairs Hospital
where Stewart volunteered and
Pointer was kept bedridden by ill
ness.
"Mel offered me a radically dif
ferent perspective than anything I
could find on campus," said the se
nior, who visited Pointer for an hour
every week as part of the United Stu
dents for Veterans' Health volun
teer program. "He had a genuine
hunger for life and a strong optimism
despite what most Stanford students
would consider an abominable situa
tion. Even though he was bedridden,
he would ask about my chemistry
class and my family."
Pointer passed away in January
2003. Although Stewart said she
often thinks about him, she will give
special regard to his memory today
when she attends an interfaith ser
vice at Memorial Church in honor of
Veterans' Day.
"The service will be honoring vet
erans by listening to a veteran and a
veterans' chaplain speak." said
event organizer Eric Sabelman, a
Ouaker representative to Stanford
Associated Religions, which the Of
fice of Religious Life describes as "a
membership organization of repre
sentatives from a number of self
supporting religious organizations
invited to offer their ministries to
campus."
"These people have to deal with
the inner wounds of the soldiers we
send to fight," he added. "Part of
what we're trying to do is care for
those wounded."
In addition to the interfaith ser
vice, at least five Stanford groups
have organized activities to both rec
ognize and reach out to veterans.

On the 11th hour of the 11th day
of the 11th month, members of the
Canadian Club will hold a memorial
service at the Clock Tower. Two
minutes of silence will follow six po
etry readings, the first of which is "In
Flanders Field." written during
World War I.
The popular war poem describes
the scene after the 1915 battle in the
Ypres salient. Canadian Club finan
cial manager and event organizer
Steve Mcßride, a graduate student
in economics, explained that after
the battle, wild poppies grew in the
soil that had been tilled by shells and
fertilized by human bodies. Canadi
ans now wear poppy pins in late Oc
tober and early November to re
member human service and sacrifice
in war.
"Poppies have been adopted in
the commonwealth as an emblem of
remembrance," said Mcßride whose
maternal grandfather died from in
juries incurred during World War
Two. "The red of the poppies sym
bolizes the red of the blood that has
been shed."
The Canadian Club will be dis
tributing poppy pins at the remem
brance service, which starts at 10:30
a.m.. and is open to people of all na
tionalities.
At the same time in White Plaza,
people will gather in a circle of about
40 chairs fora public Ouaker meet
ing. There are about 40 people on
the Ouaker e-mail list at Stanford,
but people of all faiths are invited to
sit in silence for an hour and focus on
ending war. Following the Ouaker
tradition, people can stand and
break the silence with speech in
spired from prayer.
"We called the meeting with a
focus on ending war," said Sabel
man, who is also organizing this
event. "We want to question our
selves and ask, 'Can I rid myself of
the sources of war, much less the rest
of the world?' Sitting in silence is
probably best way to work on that
question."
Members of the Filipino Ameri
can Student Union will also be sit
ting in White Plaza tomorrow, hut
their aim is just the opposite of si
lence. They will be manning an in
formation table to raise awareness
about the treatment of Filipino vet
erans.
Although Filipinos served with
the U.S. military in some of the
bloodiest battles in the Pacific dur
ing World War Two, Filipino veter
ans receive fewer medical benefits
and only half of the monthly disabil
ity pension received by veterans of
other countries that fought in the
U.S. military, said senior Lauren Hi
lario, who will be tabling tomorrow.
In addition to offering service to
those who served in years past, some

20 Stanford students are writing
thank you letters to military person
nel currently serving in Iraq. Senior
Joe Fairbanks, who is organizing the
letter-writing on behalf of the Stan
ford Conservative Union, will be
mailing the letters to addresses pro
vided by his brother, an army officer
currently training Iraqi police and
military in Baghdad.
"We want the soldiers there to
know that while we're spending time
in the comfort and safety of the Stan
ford campus, we appreciate them
risking their lives everyday to pro
tect the security of our country,"
Fairbanks said.
The United Students for Veter

ans' Health, the volunteer organiza
tion that brought Stewart and Point
er together, will bring about 20 vol
unteers and the Stanford Jazz band
to entertain veterans in the psychi
atric ward at the Menlo Park Veter
ans Affairs Hospital on Saturday.
"It is nice to have people go to
talk to veterans on Veterans' Day
and see what people are like post
war," said junior Evelyn Chin, who
visits the veterans' hospital every
week and is organizing Saturday's
event."For me, every day I volun
teer is Veterans' Day. I don't think
one day is enough."

ending war. Following the Ouaker
tradition, people can stand and
break the silence with speech in
spired from prayer.
"We called the meeting with a
focus on ending war," said Sabel
man, who is also organizing this
event. "We want to question our
selves and ask, 'Can I rid myself of
the sources of war, much less the rest
of the world?' Sitting in silence is
probably best way to work on that
question."
Members of the Filipino Ameri
can Student Union will also be sit
ting in White Plaza tomorrow, hut
their aim is just the opposite of si
lence. They will be manning an in
formation table to raise awareness
about the treatment of Filipino vet
erans.
Although Filipinos served with
the U.S. military in some of the
bloodiest battles in the Pacific dur
ing World War Two, Filipino veter
ans receive fewer medical benefits
and only half of the monthly disabil
ity pension received by veterans of
other countries that fought in the
U.S. military, said senior Lauren Hi
lario, who will be tabling tomorrow.
In addition to offering service to
those who served in years past, some

20 Stanford students are writing
thank you letters to military person
nel currently serving in Iraq. Senior
Joe Fairbanks, who is organizing the
letter-writing on behalf of the Stan
ford Conservative Union, will be
mailing the letters to addresses pro
vided by his brother, an army officer
currently training Iraqi police and
military in Baghdad.
"We want the soldiers there to
know that while we're spending time
in the comfort and safety of the Stan
ford campus, we appreciate them
risking their lives everyday to pro
tect the security of our country,"
Fairbanks said.
The United Students for Veter

ans' Health, the volunteer organiza
tion that brought Stewart and Point
er together, will bring about 20 vol
unteers and the Stanford Jazz band
to entertain veterans in the psychi
atric ward at the Menlo Park Veter
ans Affairs Hospital on Saturday.
"It is nice to have people go to
talk to veterans on Veterans' Day
and see what people are like post
war," said junior Evelyn Chin, who
visits the veterans' hospital every
week and is organizing Saturday's
event."For me, every day I volun
teer is Veterans' Day. I don't think
one day is enough."

Student honor vets,
celebrate peace today
Mel Pointer was a Vietnam veter
an from Oakland who read the
newspaper everyday and loved to
watch football. Senior Laurel Stew
art is a Stanford student from Ore
gon who majors in American Studies
and enjoys baking organic chocolate
chip cookies.
The two met and became close
friends three years ago at the Menlo
Park Veterans' Affairs Hospital
where Stewart volunteered and
Pointer was kept bedridden by ill
ness.
"Mel offered me a radically dif
ferent perspective than anything I
could find on campus," said the se
nior, who visited Pointer for an hour
every week as part of the United Stu
dents for Veterans' Health volun
teer program. "He had a genuine
hunger for life and a strong optimism
despite what most Stanford students
would consider an abominable situa
tion. Even though he was bedridden,
he would ask about my chemistry
class and my family."
Pointer passed away in January
2003. Although Stewart said she
often thinks about him, she will give
special regard to his memory today
when she attends an interfaith ser
vice at Memorial Church in honor of
Veterans' Day.
"The service will be honoring vet
erans by listening to a veteran and a
veterans' chaplain speak." said
event organizer Eric Sabelman, a
Ouaker representative to Stanford
Associated Religions, which the Of
fice of Religious Life describes as "a
membership organization of repre
sentatives from a number of self
supporting religious organizations
invited to offer their ministries to
campus."
"These people have to deal with
the inner wounds of the soldiers we
send to fight," he added. "Part of
what we're trying to do is care for
those wounded."
In addition to the interfaith ser
vice, at least five Stanford groups
have organized activities to both rec
ognize and reach out to veterans.

On the 11th hour of the 11th day
of the 11th month, members of the
Canadian Club will hold a memorial
service at the Clock Tower. Two
minutes of silence will follow six po
etry readings, the first of which is "In
Flanders Field." written during
World War I.
The popular war poem describes
the scene after the 1915 battle in the
Ypres salient. Canadian Club finan
cial manager and event organizer
Steve Mcßride, a graduate student
in economics, explained that after
the battle, wild poppies grew in the
soil that had been tilled by shells and
fertilized by human bodies. Canadi
ans now wear poppy pins in late Oc
tober and early November to re
member human service and sacrifice
in war.
"Poppies have been adopted in
the commonwealth as an emblem of
remembrance," said Mcßride whose
maternal grandfather died from in
juries incurred during World War
Two. "The red of the poppies sym
bolizes the red of the blood that has
been shed."
The Canadian Club will be dis
tributing poppy pins at the remem
brance service, which starts at 10:30
a.m.. and is open to people of all na
tionalities.
At the same time in White Plaza,
people will gather in a circle of about
40 chairs fora public Ouaker meet
ing. There are about 40 people on
the Ouaker e-mail list at Stanford,
but people of all faiths are invited to
sit in silence for an hour and focus on
ending war. Following the Ouaker
