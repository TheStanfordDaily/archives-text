# 15 years after Berlin Wall, remnants persist
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER 
Last night at Haus Mitteleuropa,
a panel gathered to commemorate
the 15-year anniversary of the fall of
the Berlin Wall and to reflect on the
development of Germany.
Two members of the Haus Mit
teleuropa staff — seniors Raphael
Ginsberg and Kathryn Blair —
spoke about the history of the Wall
and on how reunification has im
pacted the German people. Sylke
Tempel, a professor in the Stanford
in-Berlin program, and Jean-Fran
cois Barthe, who witnessed the wall's
destruction, both shared their expe
riences with Germany, past and pre
sent.
Since the reunification, former
East Germany has been an econom
ic burden on the country as a whole,
driving unemployment rates up and
sapping resources from the West,
said Ginsberg. Despite this econom
ic malaise, he described the phenom
enon of "Ostalgie" nostalgia for the
former socialist state. Rather than a
renewed spirit of socialism,"Ostal
gie" has taken the form of a longing
for "cult items" that Germans associ
ate with life in the East. The best ex
ample of this, he said, is the beloved
Spreewaldgurke, a brand of pickle;
mention of the brand elicited a
yearning groan from all the Ger
mans in the audience.
Ginsberg said while "Ostalgie"
commonly refers to a revival of East
German products, several members
of the audience expressed a deeper,
more political nostalgia. One at
tendee, who lived in West Berlin at
the time of reunification, said that
there are common fears that the
good parts of the East would be
"swallowed up" in the capitalist sys
tem. Another attendee asked
whether the job security under so

cialism is not something to be
missed.
These forms of identification with
the former East testify to the contin
uing sense of a Germany divided,
Tempel said.
"The borders are invisible, but
they're still there," she said.
Germans still rarely relocate to
the East or the West, she added, and
the marks of a 40-year division still
arise occasionally amid the growing
sense of a shared culture, and more

importantly, a common future.
"If it took 40 years to divide our
identities, perhaps it will take anoth
er 40 to unite them again," Tempel
said.
Erected in August ol 1%1, the
Berlin Wall was meant to keep the
citizens of socialist East Berlin from
escaping to capitalist West Berlin. In
the West, U.S. aid and the market
driven "Economic Miracle" of the
1950s had led to a bustling economy
and a promising future for West

Berliners. Over time, the wall came
to represent the oppressive nature of
socialist dictatorships and, more
generally, the bipolar system the
Cold War created.
Tensions mounted between the
two Germanys — the socialist Ger
man Democratic Republic and the
democratic and capitalist Federal
Republic of Germany — especially
when the GDR refused to recognize
