This Sunday young families exploring how to make cherished values more real in daily life convene
to explore different experiences of gratitude. Since "thanks" is what we give hack for receiving, the
morning includes the opportunity to make Shrink Art gifts that resemble stained glass.
Every week the Humanist Community's Family Assembly convenes to talk together, sing songs,
and read a picture book that provokes thought about living a caring and productive life. This
week's story tells about a father who takes a Thank You Walk every day. When asked by his child
why he does this he replies, "It becomes a habit and it makes you feel good." The discussion
centers on habits of thankfulness that help build happy families.
Family Assembly gathers from 10:45 AM to 12:15 PM
at Mitchell Park Community Center
3800 Middlefield Road, near Charleston, in Palo Alto.
