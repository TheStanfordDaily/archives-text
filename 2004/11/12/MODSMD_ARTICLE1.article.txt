# The 						Seniors' Last Stand
## Card look to end three-game skid against Oregon State 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After three frustrating losses in a row,
Stanford is down to two must-win games.
Coincidentally, so is Oregon State, the Car
dinal's opponent tomorrow at Stanford Sta
dium.
Tomorrow's 2 p.m. tilt may he free to all
students, faculty and staff with a Stanford ID
card, but neither the Cardinal nor the
Beavers will be getting a free pass into the
postseason this year. Both squads sit at 4-5
overall, needing wins in their final two games
to finish with a winning record and attain
bowl eligibility.
"As we look at Oregon State, it's a critical
game for us," head coach Buddy Teevens
said. "They're coming down to play fora
bowl opportunity, and we're doing the
same."
Stanford has lost the last three meetings
between the schools by an aggregate score of
112-30. including a 43-3 loss in Corvallis last
year that was notable for two reasons.
First, the Cardinal's 133 yards of total of
fense were the second-fewest in school histo
ry, while the Beavers' 663 were the third
most in their history. Secondly, despite lead
ing by 38 points late in the fourth quarter, the
Beavers threw three passes for 58 yards on
their final drive and would have scored a
final touchdown if not fora fumble on the
goal-line. No matter: on the next play, they
tackled David Marrero three yards deep in
the end zone fora safety.
After the game. Beavers head coach Mike
Riley was far from apologetic.
"They were talking like they were going
to win the game, which bothered me" he
said. "It made everybody mad. We came out
and put an exclamation point on a good foot
ball game."
Riley backed off those comments this
week, which the Cardinal can probably take
as a compliment.
"Their football team is a completely dif
ferent picture than it was a year ago," Riley
said Tuesday. "They have a much different,
more efficient identity on offense than they
did a year ago. Defensively, they're athletic.
They play a little different style of defense
with that 3-4 than what we're used to seeing."
Stanford would like to show Riley just
how different a team it is this year. But the

Cardinal will have to do so without a few key
components.
Leading passer Trent Edwards might not
be able to play after re-aggravating his left
shoulder injury last weekend, and leading
rusher J.R. Lemon, leading tackier Kevin
Schimmelmann and defensive end Casey
Carroll are also unlikely to play.
If Edwards cannot start, redshirt fresh
man T.C. Ostrander will start for the first
time in his career. Ostrander is 31 -of-55 pass
ing this season for 519 yards, two touch
downs and one interception, giving him a
better passer rating (144.0) than Edwards
(110.3), who's taken quite a beating this sea
son and has thrown six interceptions in the
last two games. Ostrander relieved Edwards
in the third quarter against Arizona State
and was 8-of-15 for 161 yards, a touchdown
and an interception.
"He delivered some big balls, scrambled,
picked up a first down," Teevens said after
the game. "T.C. progressed in getting rid of
the football and not taking sacks."
With Lemon out, Kenneth Tolon (3.7
yards per carry, three touchdowns) will
probably share running duties with freshman
Ray Jones (2.0 yards per carry, two touch
downs). Stanford will at least have its full
complement of receivers, including Alex
Smith (49 catches, 644 yards, three touch
downs), Evan Moore (34 catches, 533 yards,
five touchdowns) and Mark Bradford (27
catches, 378 yards).
Oregon State, as always, will lean heavily
on senior Derek Anderson's right arm. An
derson leads the Pac-10 with 285.8 passing
yards per game, but he's been intercepted a
conference-worst 12 times, completes 51.2
percent of his passes and has been sacked 26
times.
Anderson's main target, former walk-on
Mike Hass, is the real deal. He leads the
Pac-10 in both receptions (64) and yards
(1,010). He also torched the Cardinal for
225 receiving yards in last year's game, the
second-highest individual total in Oregon
State history.
"He's a very productive individual and
very effective in his route running," Teevens
said. "He's also extremely sure-handed. You
don't stop a guy like that... you just try to
limit the impact that he has."
Sophomore Joe Newton does some dam
age, too, having caught 39 balls for 492 yards,
ranking in the top 10 in conference in both
categories.
"They've opted to throw the ball exten
sively," Teevens said. "They do have a tal
ented running back and their offensive line is
performing for them, but they haven't taken
a lot of run opportunities."
Leading rusher Dwight Wright Jr. does
well when he gets a chance. He's averaged
4.0 yards per carry and 70.7 yards per game,
and has 16 catches, with six touchdowns in
total.

The contest is the final home game for 11
Cardinal seniors.
Five are defensive starters (Osh
iomogho Atogwe, David Bergeron, Jared
Newberry, Leigh Torrence and Stanley
Wilson), two are offensive starters (Smith
and Tolon), and the other four (Greg Ca
marillo, Ryan Eklund, Scott Scharff and
Will Svitek) have all received important
playing time this season as well.

The 11 seniors have played an integral
part in the Cardinal's success, and the num
bers bear that out. Between them, the senior
class is l-of-3 passing for 24 yards, has 69 re
ceptions for 880 yards and three touch
downs, has rushed 98 times for 346 yards and
three touchdowns and has 245 tackles, seven
interceptions, five forced fumbles, two fum
ble recoveries and one sack.
"They've been a special group,"

Teevens said. "They're resilient and have
tremendous character. I believe in owner
ship. accountability and leadership from
within, and these guys have responded ex
tremely unselfishly."
After Stanford, the Beavers close out
the year by hosting the Civil War against
Oregon.
After Oregon State, the Cardinal finishes
with Big Game at No. 5 California.

With senior J R. Lemon unlikely to play due to injury, fellow senior Kenneth Tolon will get the bulk of the carries tomorrow against Oregon
State. The Cardinal must win their last two games of the season to qualify fora bowl bid.
