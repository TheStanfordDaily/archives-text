# Programs aid female faculty, but not staff
## 
### NILA BALA 
"Ain't I a woman?" asked one Law School adminis
trator, commenting on the report completed last May
that found that 37 percent of female faculty members
felt they had received differential treatment based on
gender during the past three years.
Some staff and administrators say that while the re
port examined female faculty concerns — and has
spurred plans for programs to address discrimination —
it failed to address staff and administrator concerns.
Patricia Jones, vice provost for faculty development,
explained that the female faculty programs include a
new panel on gender equity and a faculty women's
forum, which had its first organizational meeting last
Thursday.
Jones believes that the separation between the facul
ty and staff has resulted because the two groups are
treated as different entities.
"There are separate ways of addressing problems
women have; even within the staff there are separa
tions," she said. "The bargaining unit is split from other
units, and so on and so forth."
Vice Provost of Campus Relations La Doris Cordell
explained that although no groups exist that are focused
exclusively on women staff issues, there are still ways to
voice concerns.
"While there are no organizations on campus specif
ically established to address the concerns of female staff
(indeed, it would be illegal to have a staff organization
that excluded men), there are organizations at which
such concerns can be raised," she wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
"Additionally, if a person believes that she has been
discriminated against because of her sex, then she may
speak with the University ombudsperson, the sexual ha
rassment policy office, the office of the general counsel,
with the human resources department, or with me to
seek redress," she said.
But the Law School administrator, who asked to re
main anonymous, disagreed and believed that a joint
coalition between staff and faculty must be formed for
any progress to take place regarding gender.
"We need a partnership between faculty and staff,"
she said. "Faculty don't tend to fraternize with staff be
cause it's simply not worth their time. They fraternize
On-campus child care
pricey for administrators

with those they publish and perish
with, other faculty. If this is a
team, women faculty have to real
ize they are on the same team."
Director of the Worklife Of
fice Teresa Rasco, who supervises
the University'schildcare centers,
explained that she does not see
the childcare centers as address
ing just faculty's concerns. Rasco
also oversees the working group
formed in response to May's re
port to evaluate the possibility for
a new childcare center.
"While the composition of the
working group is still being for
mulated. it currently has 13 peo
ple. including facuity members,
staff, students, and post-doctor
ates," she said. "Children are a
factor that levels the playing field.
First-time parents, whether facul
ty or staff, have the same con
cerns. I would hope that this

would be a place for staff to voice
opinions as well."
Michele Grason, an adminis
trator at the law school, believes
that throughout her 11 years as an
employee, the campus has be
come more responsive to her
childcare needs.
"In the beginning, it was really
hard to get daycare for my son,
who is now five years old." she
said. "I wrote letters to the Uni
versity president and responded
to a survey sent out to all employ
ees of the University. Recently,
the University has created the
childcare subsidy and flexible
spending accounts to make child
care more affordable, but I am
still one of the few administrators
that uses the on-campus child
care."
Yesenia Lewis, who works at
Stern Dining, still sees the afford

ability of childcare as a large con
cern.
"I have to speak up for myself
if I want one day off," she said. "I
have to have one day to he with
my kids, at least on the weekends.
Of course, dropping off kids to an
on-campus daycare would he
wonderful, but it might be too ex
pensive."
Prof. Deborah Rhode, who
chairs the Provost's Advisory
Committee on the Status of
Women Faculty, believes that
there should be a forum to inves
tigate gender issues for staff and
administrators as well.
"Our committee wasn't in a
position to do fact-finding on staff
because it wasn't our jurisdic
tion," she said. "There are signifi
cant issues there as well, and there
ought to be a committee to ad
dress those concerns."

explained that the female faculty programs include a
new panel on gender equity and a faculty women's
forum, which had its first organizational meeting last
Thursday.
Jones believes that the separation between the facul
ty and staff has resulted because the two groups are
treated as different entities.
"There are separate ways of addressing problems
women have; even within the staff there are separa
tions," she said. "The bargaining unit is split from other
units, and so on and so forth."
Vice Provost of Campus Relations La Doris Cordell
explained that although no groups exist that are focused
exclusively on women staff issues, there are still ways to
voice concerns.
"While there are no organizations on campus specif
ically established to address the concerns of female staff
(indeed, it would be illegal to have a staff organization
that excluded men), there are organizations at which
such concerns can be raised," she wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
"Additionally, if a person believes that she has been
discriminated against because of her sex, then she may
speak with the University ombudsperson, the sexual ha
rassment policy office, the office of the general counsel,
with the human resources department, or with me to
seek redress," she said.
But the Law School administrator, who asked to re
main anonymous, disagreed and believed that a joint
coalition between staff and faculty must be formed for
any progress to take place regarding gender.
"We need a partnership between faculty and staff,"
she said. "Faculty don't tend to fraternize with staff be
cause it's simply not worth their time. They fraternize

with those they publish and perish
with, other faculty. If this is a
team, women faculty have to real
ize they are on the same team."
Director of the Worklife Of
fice Teresa Rasco, who supervises
the University'schildcare centers,
explained that she does not see
the childcare centers as address
ing just faculty's concerns. Rasco
also oversees the working group
formed in response to May's re
port to evaluate the possibility for
a new childcare center.
"While the composition of the
working group is still being for
mulated. it currently has 13 peo
ple. including facuity members,
staff, students, and post-doctor
ates," she said. "Children are a
factor that levels the playing field.
First-time parents, whether facul
ty or staff, have the same con
cerns. I would hope that this

would be a place for staff to voice
opinions as well."
Michele Grason, an adminis
trator at the law school, believes
that throughout her 11 years as an
employee, the campus has be
come more responsive to her
childcare needs.
"In the beginning, it was really
hard to get daycare for my son,
who is now five years old." she
said. "I wrote letters to the Uni
versity president and responded
to a survey sent out to all employ
ees of the University. Recently,
the University has created the
childcare subsidy and flexible
spending accounts to make child
care more affordable, but I am
still one of the few administrators
that uses the on-campus child
care."
Yesenia Lewis, who works at
Stern Dining, still sees the afford

ability of childcare as a large con
cern.
"I have to speak up for myself
if I want one day off," she said. "I
have to have one day to he with
my kids, at least on the weekends.
Of course, dropping off kids to an
on-campus daycare would he
wonderful, but it might be too ex
pensive."
Prof. Deborah Rhode, who
chairs the Provost's Advisory
Committee on the Status of
Women Faculty, believes that
there should be a forum to inves
tigate gender issues for staff and
administrators as well.
"Our committee wasn't in a
position to do fact-finding on staff
because it wasn't our jurisdic
tion," she said. "There are signifi
cant issues there as well, and there
ought to be a committee to ad
dress those concerns."
