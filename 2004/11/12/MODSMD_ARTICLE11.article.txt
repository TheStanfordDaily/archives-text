# Programs aid female faculty, but not staff

### NILA BALA 
"Ain't I a woman?" asked one Law School adminis
trator, commenting on the report completed last May
that found that 37 percent of female faculty members
felt they had received differential treatment based on
gender during the past three years.
Some staff and administrators say that while the re

Vice Provost of Campus Relations La Doris Cordell
explained that although no groups exist that are focused
exclusively on women staff issues, there are still ways to
voice concerns.

that excluded men), there are organizations at which
such concerns can be raised," she wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.

seek redress," she said.
But the Law School administrator, who asked to re

coalition between staff and faculty must be formed for
any progress to take place regarding gender.
"We need a partnership between faculty and staff,"
she said. "Faculty don't tend to fraternize with staff be
cause it's simply not worth their time. They fraternize
