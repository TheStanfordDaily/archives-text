# Programs help students find public-sector jobs
## 
### JESSICA ZHANG 
Corporate America may lure graduates
with hefty bonuses and the promise of upward
mobility, but a trio of Stanford programs is
doing its best to support students who choose
the less-lucrative public sector as well.
A week from today, the Haas Center for
Public Service is holding its Fellowships Open
House. Also next Friday, the Career Develop
ment Center will hold a reception for students
interested in the public sector. And a program
created by Stanford alumni called the Stanford
Public Interest Network, or SPIN, places stu
dents in year-long paid positions at public in
terest organizations in New York City.
On Friday, Nov. 18. the Haas Center will
host its Fellowships Open House to showcase

opportunities through which students can gain
hands-on experience in fields such as educa
tion, law, technology, spirituality and urban is
sues. Fellowships are in the public sector and
promote civic leadership through students'
own academic interests.
"We want to facilitate professional service
experiences for students — ones where they
are well-prepared to work with attentive men
tors who guide fellows in their pursuit to learn
about and contribute to the areas in which they
are working," liana Golin. fellows program co
ordinator. wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Another goal is to match students with pub
lic service organizations at which the students
can use their skills to further the organization's

SPIN matches students

mission and programs.
"These demonstrate to stu
dents that their undergraduate
coursework can have immediate
relevance in the public sphere,"
said Golin. "Fellowships offer an
opportunity for students to deep
en their classroom learning and
give them practical experience to
draw upon in their future academ
ic endeavors."
Stipends from outside donors
are integral to making these fel
lowships a reality.
"We hope that students who
are given these opportunities are
able to do service work that they
are unable to without funding."
said Sheryl Linsky, fellowships
program assistant. "We also give
financial aid components when
appropriate."
The Haas Center has helped
enrich students' academic needs
with projects in public service
since its inception 20 years ago.
Students who participate in Haas
Center fellowships take on a di
verse array of projects.
Examples from last year in
clude a science camp in one stu
dent's hometown in Hawaii, a
health project focusing on health
problems prevalent in New York
City's South Asian community,
and riding camp for underprivi
leged youths in Jordan.
Sophomore Richard Cox par
ticipated in the Education and
Youth Development fellowship
and worked as a tutor with the
East Palo Alto Stanford Acade
my program.
"I was interested in having a
coordinator position during the
summer," he said. "I was interest
ed in tutoring during the year, so
I just wanted to further that."
As a teacher for six weeks. Cox
says that the relationships he
formed with his students have
been most endearing.
"They continue to send me e
mails; they even prank-call me,"
he said. "They look up to me. I
continue to tutor them through
the school year. The relationships

I formed exceeded all my expec
tations. It was one of the most re
warding experiences of my life."
The Haas Center, through its
fellowship programs, encourages
students to continue work in pub
lic service, even after they leave
the Farm.
• "The Haas Center hopes to in
spire students to make public ser
vice an integral part of their lives
here at Stanford and beyond,"
said Golin. "The breadth and
depth of the fellowships we offer
demonstrate that there are many,
many ways to make a difference
in this world. We provide students
the opportunity to explore a vari
ety of paths as they forge their
own trail."
For graduating students, the
Haas Center is not the only place
to find fellowships. Stanford Pub
lic Interest Network, or SPIN, is a
program founded by Stanford
Alumni Association to help grad
uating seniors land public-interest
jobs and to help alumni network
with one another.
At a short meeting Wednes
day night. Bay Area coordinators
and recent Stanford alumnae
Kate Harkness and Sheela Subra
manian, both members of the
Class of 2(X)3, spoke to a small
group of students about year-long
fellowships that take place in New
York City at the Manhattan Dis
trict Attorney's office, the New
York City Economics Develop
ment Corporation and New York
City Health and Hospitals.
Upcoming programs in the
Bay Area include work with
groups such as Second Harvest
Food Bank and Charles Schwab.
"SPIN was founded in 2003 be
cause of a lack of opportunities
out there in the public interest
field for college students." Subra
manian said. "We are a great net
work to ask people questions and
to get a feel for what other alumni
are doing in the public interest
world." she added.
SPIN "pre-qualifies" students
with organizations of interest, ac

cording to Harkness.
"SPIN not only helps students
find a substantive job with an or
ganization |lhey| have interest in,
but our hope is we'll be able to
create jobs where you'll be uti
lized more fully," Harkness ex
plained to students as she ended
their presentation.
Another resource for students
interested in public service is the
upcoming Working for Social Jus
tice Panel on Nov. 18, sponsored
by the Career Development Cen
ter. The panel will bring represen
tatives from Green Corps. Cali
fornia Public Interest Research
Group, Americorps, Rainforest
Action Network and Teach for
America, among others.
"Career panels educate stu
dents about career opportuni
ties," said Lance Choy, Director
of the CDC. "Helping students
explore different career fields is a
major goal for the CDC. Typical
ly, we have a number of students
who are exploring the area of so
cial change in public service."
Current events have led to an
increased interest in public ser
vice, according to Choy.
"After 9 /11 and during the re
cession. we noticed that there
were more students interested in
public service careers. For in
stance, there were more students
attending programs with the
Peace Corps or Teach for Ameri
ca during this period. As we move
out the recession, we're seeing
numbers return to normal levels."
Students who go to the CDC
and the Haas Center have differ
ent backgrounds and interests,
but "what is common is that they
all have a passion in some issue
and derive a great deal of satisfac
tion pursuing that issue," said
Choy.
From Haas Center to SPIN to
the CDC, opportunities at Stan
ford are indeed numerous and di
verse. All students have to do is
seek them out.

to find fellowships. Stanford Pub
lic Interest Network, or SPIN, is a
program founded by Stanford
Alumni Association to help grad
uating seniors land public-interest
jobs and to help alumni network
with one another.
At a short meeting Wednes
day night. Bay Area coordinators
and recent Stanford alumnae
Kate Harkness and Sheela Subra
manian, both members of the
Class of 2(X)3, spoke to a small
group of students about year-long
fellowships that take place in New
York City at the Manhattan Dis
trict Attorney's office, the New
York City Economics Develop
ment Corporation and New York
City Health and Hospitals.
Upcoming programs in the
Bay Area include work with
groups such as Second Harvest
Food Bank and Charles Schwab.
"SPIN was founded in 2003 be
cause of a lack of opportunities
out there in the public interest
field for college students." Subra
manian said. "We are a great net
work to ask people questions and
to get a feel for what other alumni
are doing in the public interest
world." she added.
SPIN "pre-qualifies" students
with organizations of interest, ac

cording to Harkness.
"SPIN not only helps students
find a substantive job with an or
ganization |lhey| have interest in,
but our hope is we'll be able to
create jobs where you'll be uti
lized more fully," Harkness ex
plained to students as she ended
their presentation.
Another resource for students
interested in public service is the
upcoming Working for Social Jus
tice Panel on Nov. 18, sponsored
by the Career Development Cen
ter. The panel will bring represen
tatives from Green Corps. Cali
fornia Public Interest Research
Group, Americorps, Rainforest
Action Network and Teach for
America, among others.
"Career panels educate stu
dents about career opportuni
ties," said Lance Choy, Director
of the CDC. "Helping students
explore different career fields is a
major goal for the CDC. Typical
ly, we have a number of students
who are exploring the area of so
cial change in public service."
Current events have led to an
increased interest in public ser
vice, according to Choy.
"After 9 /11 and during the re
cession. we noticed that there
were more students interested in
public service careers. For in
stance, there were more students
attending programs with the
Peace Corps or Teach for Ameri
ca during this period. As we move
out the recession, we're seeing
numbers return to normal levels."
Students who go to the CDC
and the Haas Center have differ
ent backgrounds and interests,
but "what is common is that they
all have a passion in some issue
and derive a great deal of satisfac
tion pursuing that issue," said
Choy.
From Haas Center to SPIN to
the CDC, opportunities at Stan
ford are indeed numerous and di
verse. All students have to do is
seek them out.
Corporate America may lure graduates
with hefty bonuses and the promise of upward
mobility, but a trio of Stanford programs is
doing its best to support students who choose
the less-lucrative public sector as well.
A week from today, the Haas Center for
Public Service is holding its Fellowships Open
House. Also next Friday, the Career Develop
ment Center will hold a reception for students
interested in the public sector. And a program
created by Stanford alumni called the Stanford
Public Interest Network, or SPIN, places stu
dents in year-long paid positions at public in
terest organizations in New York City.
On Friday, Nov. 18. the Haas Center will
host its Fellowships Open House to showcase

opportunities through which students can gain
hands-on experience in fields such as educa
tion, law, technology, spirituality and urban is
sues. Fellowships are in the public sector and
promote civic leadership through students'
own academic interests.
"We want to facilitate professional service
experiences for students — ones where they
are well-prepared to work with attentive men
tors who guide fellows in their pursuit to learn
about and contribute to the areas in which they
are working," liana Golin. fellows program co
ordinator. wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Another goal is to match students with pub
lic service organizations at which the students
can use their skills to further the organization's

mission and programs.
"These demonstrate to stu
dents that their undergraduate
coursework can have immediate
relevance in the public sphere,"
said Golin. "Fellowships offer an
opportunity for students to deep
en their classroom learning and
give them practical experience to
draw upon in their future academ
ic endeavors."
Stipends from outside donors
are integral to making these fel
lowships a reality.
"We hope that students who
are given these opportunities are
able to do service work that they
are unable to without funding."
said Sheryl Linsky, fellowships
program assistant. "We also give
financial aid components when
appropriate."
The Haas Center has helped
enrich students' academic needs
with projects in public service
since its inception 20 years ago.
Students who participate in Haas
Center fellowships take on a di
verse array of projects.
Examples from last year in
clude a science camp in one stu
dent's hometown in Hawaii, a
health project focusing on health
problems prevalent in New York
City's South Asian community,
and riding camp for underprivi
leged youths in Jordan.
Sophomore Richard Cox par
ticipated in the Education and
Youth Development fellowship
and worked as a tutor with the
East Palo Alto Stanford Acade
my program.
"I was interested in having a
coordinator position during the
summer," he said. "I was interest
ed in tutoring during the year, so
I just wanted to further that."
As a teacher for six weeks. Cox
says that the relationships he
formed with his students have
been most endearing.
"They continue to send me e
mails; they even prank-call me,"
he said. "They look up to me. I
continue to tutor them through
the school year. The relationships

I formed exceeded all my expec
tations. It was one of the most re
warding experiences of my life."
The Haas Center, through its
fellowship programs, encourages
students to continue work in pub
lic service, even after they leave
the Farm.
• "The Haas Center hopes to in
spire students to make public ser
vice an integral part of their lives
here at Stanford and beyond,"
said Golin. "The breadth and
depth of the fellowships we offer
demonstrate that there are many,
many ways to make a difference
in this world. We provide students
the opportunity to explore a vari
ety of paths as they forge their
own trail."
