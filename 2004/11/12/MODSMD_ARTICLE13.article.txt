Ever wonder what it would he like to
have people from all around the Peninsu
la listening to your every word? If the
idea sounds attractive, KZSU might be
for you.
"We are always interested in new
shows." said physics graduate student
and Program Director Sterling Church
man. "At KZSU we try to fill a niche that
you can't find elsewhere on the FM dial.
We won't put DJs on that will play only
music or content you hear elsewhere.
The most important thing is that our
broadcasters love what they're doing."
For years, Stanford's radio station has
given students their own weekly radio
shows. Churchman said that the only re
quirement for hosting a show is that stu
dents take a seven-week-long class that
teaches them about being on the air.
After the class, students have to submit a
demo tape and are then free to apply for
a show.
"It is very rare that a student who ap
plies fora show does not get one." said
Churchman.
Once students have a show on the air.
they have to do a minimum of 15 hours of
volunteer work per quarter around the
station. That's because the station is run
almost entirely by a volunteer staff com
prised of Stanford students, staff, and
other locals.
According to Churchman, hosting a
show on KZSU is a good opportunity
for students to reach a wide variety of

people.
"Our broadcast range is from Point
Reyes to San Jose, which makes us a firm
contributor to the Bay Area's culture
scene." he said. "We also broadcast over
the Internet to the entire world."
KZSU broadcasts three types of pro
gramming: music, news and sports. Stu
dents currently have shows in each of
these areas.
"Right now we have 20 music and

news shows run by students." Church
man said. "Tjhe sports department con
sists of only students who broadcast
many of Stanford's sports throughout the
year."
