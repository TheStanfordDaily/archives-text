Ever wonder what it would he like to
have people from all around the Peninsu
la listening to your every word? If the
idea sounds attractive, KZSU might be
for you.
"We are always interested in new
shows." said physics graduate student
and Program Director Sterling Church
man. "At KZSU we try to fill a niche that
you can't find elsewhere on the FM dial.
We won't put DJs on that will play only
music or content you hear elsewhere.
The most important thing is that our
broadcasters love what they're doing."
For years, Stanford's radio station has
given students their own weekly radio
shows. Churchman said that the only re
quirement for hosting a show is that stu
dents take a seven-week-long class that
teaches them about being on the air.
After the class, students have to submit a
demo tape and are then free to apply for
a show.
"It is very rare that a student who ap
plies fora show does not get one." said
Churchman.
Once students have a show on the air.
they have to do a minimum of 15 hours of
volunteer work per quarter around the
station. That's because the station is run
almost entirely by a volunteer staff com
prised of Stanford students, staff, and
other locals.
According to Churchman, hosting a
show on KZSU is a good opportunity
for students to reach a wide variety of

people.
"Our broadcast range is from Point
Reyes to San Jose, which makes us a firm
contributor to the Bay Area's culture
scene." he said. "We also broadcast over
the Internet to the entire world."
KZSU broadcasts three types of pro
gramming: music, news and sports. Stu
dents currently have shows in each of
these areas.
"Right now we have 20 music and

news shows run by students." Church
man said. "Tjhe sports department con
sists of only students who broadcast
many of Stanford's sports throughout the
year."

on Stanford's radio station, KSZU.
lany." She said that the inspiration for her
show came from a Chicago-based radio
program called "This American Life."
"The show is about anything I find in
teresting," she said. "Each week. 1 try to
loosely organize a set of interviews and
stories and songs around some common
idea. I did one show on wildlife, which in
cluded an interview with the City of Palo
Alto's naturalist, a story about a subur
banite's fantasies of killing the deer in her
yard and a radio play about Yogi Bear's
descent into a life of crime."
Charlotte said she enjoys producing
and hosting her own show.
"I like every part of producing the
show, from deciding on topics to record
ing interviews to editing them to picking
music to play between segments," she
said. "What I don't like is the enormous
amount of time this takes each week."
Sophomore Kathryn Rickertsen, who
hosts a show on Friday afternoons called
"Coup de Tete," agrees that having a
radio show takes a lot of work.
"It's hard to understand how much
preparation time goes into broadcasting a 45
minute news show," she said. "I spend about
five to ten hours in preparation each week."
"Coup de Tete" compiles campus,
local, national, and international news in
a series of short news briefs and inter
views. In addition, Rickertsen said that
each week she includes a "Sophomore
Salute," in which she interviews a sopho
more individual or group to highlight the
activities, extra-curricular involvement
and success stories of the class.
Rickertsen is happy to have the oppor
tunity to "get her feet wet" in the broad
casting field.
"1 am interested in pursuing a career in
broadcast journalism, and 1 feel that there
is no substitute for first hand experience."
Churchman said that KZSU encour
ages students to apply for their own shows
or simply volunteer at the station.
"Stanford students who work at
KZSU have the ability to not only make
excellent campus radio, but we can also
make an impact tin the outside world," he
said. "Our DJs have gone on to other
freeform independent radio stations,
NPR and to sports radio stations. KZSU
is an excellent opportunity for anyone in
terested in radio as a career or as a
hobby."
