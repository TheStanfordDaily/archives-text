# After quick gains, Univ. Press seeks niche

Expect to see "Stanford Universi
ty Press" across the spines of more
and more of your textbooks.
At yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting, Stanford University Press
Director Geoffrey Burn and Pub
lishing Director Alan Harvey an
nounced the results of a four-year
initiative started in 2001 to drastical
ly restructure the SUP to increase its
market share of scholarly works. Cit
ing positive results, SUP hopes to
continue to increase its output and
become even more competitive with
larger university presses.
In 2001, adverse market pressures
"made it increasingly difficult for
|SU P) to operate profitably," Burn
said. These market pressures includ
ed a decrease in library and book
store buying and a lack of a finan
cially viable e-publishing model.
Internally, SUP simply "had too
many books in too many areas,"

Harvey said. This left relatively
small amounts of revenue per title.
Moreover, weak production,
marketing and distribution systems
and processes created an inefficient
SUP. Journals, reference works and
textbooks did not generate profit.
"The decline in revenue resulting
from these market pressures, and the
increased subsidies this necessitated,
prompted Stanford to bring in a new
team four years ago to undertake a
turnaround of the press, with the
main aim of finding ways to under
write the continuation of the scholar
ly publishing program," Burn said.
"We needed to make two types of
changes — the first change was in
what we publish, and the second was
how we publish it." Harvey said.
A detailed restructuring proposal
of SUP was presented to the admin
istration in the fall of 2001. Universi
ty President John Hennessy agreed
to underwrite the costs of the plan
for four years.
"SUP reinforced |its| commit

ment to humanities and social sci
ence publishing," Harvey said. It ex
panded scholarly offerings to in
clude law, economics, education,
and business, as these areas "reflect
ed Stanford's strengths and offered
the opportunity for fairly rapid re
turn on |SUP| investment."
SUP also increased its listings of
core textbooks in the humanities and
social sciences.
"While our new areas were
picked in part because of their po
tential to launch us into the textbook
market." Harvey said, what made
them especially attractive were the
large markets they offered for pro
fessional and reference works."
At this time, SUP will not try to
expand into scientific, technical and
medical publishing — those markets
are beyond SUP's reach due to com
petition and costs.
Since 2001, SUP has increased
sales, reduced returns of unsold
books and grown 26 percent. Thanks
to the drastic overhaul of systems

and procedures mentioned in the
proposal. SUP has cut costs by over
$1 million and 64 percent.
Compared with university press
es of similar size, SUP has averaged
five times the net sales increase of its
competitors since 2001. Whereas
SUP was struggling four years ago, it
now competes with presses three to
four times its size.
Currently, SUP is developing a
new three-year plan to continue to
cut costs and stay competitive.
"We are trying to create a niche in
the university press market similar to
that of larger presses such as Har
vard, Yale, and the University of
Chicago,' Burn said. "Those other
presses have found niches in particu
lar disciplines. For example, Prince
ton and MIT dominate the publica
tion of economics literature."
SUP is trying to occupy its new
niche in scholarly, textbook and pro
fessional publications in various dis
ciplines.
