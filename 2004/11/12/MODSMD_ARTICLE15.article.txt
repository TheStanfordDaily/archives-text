# Graduates flock to Teach for America
## 
### JESSICA LIN 
Picture this: A dedicated teacher
motivates vulnerable low-income
students to study, pass an exam and
prove all naysayers wrong. It's a plot
often seen on screen (think "Dan
gerous Minds" or "Stand and Deliv
er"). hut it's also the real-life goal of
a growing number of idealistic stu
dents at Stanford and other campus
es across the country.
"Teach for America really
changes not just the lives of the stu
dents, hut also the lives of the teach
ers who participate," said Chris
Weber, the Bay Area Recruitment
Director for Teach For America.
"Our corps members love helping
students from low-income commu
nities and making a difference. The
skills that they gain as a teacher are
easily transferable into whatever
field they decide to pursue."
Last Wednesday night. Teach
For America held an informational
meeting at the Career Development
Center in an effort to attract Stan
ford students to the program. Today,
the program is holding a lunch re
ception for leaders of student groups
on campus.
"We are definitely looking for
more Stanford graduates to join,"
Weber said. "They are among the
best and brightest, and the Stanford
alumni who have participated in this
program have had amazing success.
It is truly inspiring to see their dedi
cation and leadership, and also to
see such motivated Stanford stu
dents at the meeting."
Seven Stanford students partici
pated in Teach for America last
year. Amber Saloner, who is in her
first year of teaching, teaches fifth
grade at Bedford-Stuyvesant in
Brooklyn, N.Y., while concurrently
pursuing her masters degree at Pace
University. Her tuition is covered by
the AmeriCorps education award
that she received through her partic
ipation in Teach For America.
"1 decided to join Teach For
America because it was the only job
that seemed as though it would be
rewarding in a really meaningful
way," Saloner said. "I considered

working in the financial world or for
a marketing company, hut Teach
For America was more compelling.
How else would 1 he able to make a
real impact on people? The more 1
learned about the program, the easi
er my decision became."
Saloner notes that her job does
not come without struggles, but that
seeing the progress of the students
makes everything worth it.
"Teaching my students, all of
whom either live in the projects or
shelters by my school, has been both
the most challenging and rewarding
thing I have ever done," she said.
"At the beginning of the year, all of
my students were hurtful to one an
other and were completely unmoti
vated to learn. Now all of them are
invested in their academic futures,
working hard and excited about the
prospect of going to college."
Michael Scrafford, also a first
year corps member, plans on attend
ing business school after his two
year commitment.
"A big reason 1 joined TFA be
sides it being the fastest way to get
into the classroom is the network of
people that TFA connects you
with," he said. "TFA networks you
with not only leaders, but leaders in
education, which is where I see my
life's work. Being in the classroom is
like nothing else. Having 25 to 30
kids that depend on you and react to
your urging is extremely inspiring."
Although Stanford does not have
a Teach for America group on cam
pus, there are two Stanford Teach
For America campaign managers,
sophomores Vinny Intersimone and
Jenny Zhao. They help recruit stu
dents by giving classroom presenta
tions, posting fliers and directly con
tacting students.
"1 believe the program helps end
the horrendous problem of educa
tional inequity in America," Intersi
mone said. "When Chris Weber e
mailed me and told me more about
it, I signed on almost immediately.
Having learned more about the pro
gram and what a unique opportunity
it provides to really make a differ
ence, I plan to apply."
