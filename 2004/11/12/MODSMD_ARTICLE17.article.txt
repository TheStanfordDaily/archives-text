# Touching Tongues
## What's the frequency, Kenneth?

While walking rather
incompetently past the
laundry room of a local
fraternity the other
evening, your columnists had the good
fortune of catching a glimpse, through
the window in the door, of two hump
happy youngsters perched rather awk
wardly atop a bucking washing
machine. Now. your columnists are
ancient enough to remember a time,
before capital improvement, when the

door to that
laundry room
was opaque,
wooden even,
and afforded
the appropri
ate level of pri
vacy for this
sort of intimate
and meaning
ful connection.
Of course
we stopped for
a few moments
to score their
technique and
noticed that we
each knew a

different half of that gyrating love
snare. Erin mentioned that she thought
it was just lovely that there was still so
much passion in a long-term relation
ship, to which Mary replied, "Relaysha
what? I don't think he even knows her
name."
The disparity in the status reports
we had independently received
brought our usually scintillating con
versation to a newly satisfying level.
What, we asked, are the relationship
classifications available to the average
Stanford special friend pair? After a
rousing debate involving Jim Lehrer as
moderator and a step stool for Erin
because Mary is so tall, we came up
with three and only three ways in which
males and females relate on this cam
pus.
The first type we've already touched
upon with the laundry room lovers: the
quintessential pairing of Oblivious and
Obsessed. Obsessed is usually of the
female type persuasion, but just for fun
let's steer clear of those sweeping gen
eralizations because apparently they're
"not funny" and generate psychotic
hate mail. The gist is that neutral-gen
dered Obsessed is picking out match
ing nursery furniture, while Oblivious
doesn't remember his/her name, only
pretended to enter his/her phone num
ber into her/his phone, and has only a
dim recollection of hooking up with
anyone at all in the last couple of weeks
(are you sick of not picking a gendered
pronoun yet, because we're stopping).
Oblivious finally gets fed up with
rumors about some "girlfriend" of his
killing his game, and decides to check
into it one drunken night with a hasty
e-mail inquiring as to her identity.
We can't come to a consensus as to
whether this next category is better or
worse than the first, but at the very
least, in the next case the two parties
involved are on the same page. That
page's title? Total Denial. All 57 of the
other people on campus who go out at
night know they've been doing the
sweet monkey naynay, but they do that
shruggy,"'What? No way, I'd never date
him" thing every time anybody brings
it up. It could be that one of them goes
into anaphylactic shock any time the D
word (dating) is even hinted at, or that
the other is still holding onto one of
those really awesome long distance sig
nificant others from high school. Either
way, it's fun to play these two off of
each other, and watch them freak out
all defensively.
For our returning readers, our
hatred of this next category may seem
redundant, but for the rest of you, it
may suffice to say we have a particular
aversion to the Nick and Jessica
Lacheys of this world. They're married
(gross), and they seem to like it (we
don't have the words). They kiss all
cutesy-like in public, do things you
thought no one could do in earnest —
like send Singing Telegrams — wear
truly perverse lingerie for one another
and have anal. And we think they
might even like each other's farts.
Think we haven't covered your rela
tionship status yet? Re-evaluate, and
you'll probably find yourself nicely sit
uated in the first or second category.
Sucker.
