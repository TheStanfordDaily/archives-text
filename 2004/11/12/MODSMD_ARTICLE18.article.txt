# Greek life ...
## History of fraternities and sororities 
### MEG WALTNER 
At first glance, Greek life at Stanford seems a shadow of
its past. While once all 36 houses on the Row belonged to
Greeks, now only 25 percent of them house sororities and
fraternities. Still, the Greek system remains a significant
part of social life at Stanford.
History of Greek Life
"[Fraternities and sororities] are clearly a part of our his
tory." said Nanci Howe, associate dean of students and
Director of Student activities.
Demand fora housed Greek system emerged in the
early days of the University, when students were not guar
anteed four years of on-campus housing.
The first Greek organization at Stanford was the sorori
ty Kappa Alpha Theta. Theta rented a house in Mayfield, a
town that no longer exists. Many of the other original
Greek organizations rented their houses off-campus,

although some did have on-campus
houses.
By 1898 there were five sorori
ties on campus, and by 1916 there
were 24 fraternities. By then, twice
as many students lived in sororities
and fraternities than in non-Greek
on-campus housing.
Fraternities grew much faster
than sororities, partly because there
were fewer women. Jane Stanford
had a "500" rule, which allowed no
more than 500 women at Stanford
at one time. The "500" rule was in
response to criticism the University
received for beine heavilv female

when it first opened. Since the University was founded in
the name of Jane Stanford's son, she did not want it to be
referred to as the Vassar of the West and sought to limit
female enrollment.

In the late 1910s and early 19205,
the University criticized members
of fraternities and sororities
because of their low academic per
formance. Then-University
President Ray Wilbur threatened
to ban fraternities and sororities
unless their members improved
academically.
"President Wilbur really
cracked down on sororities and fra
ternities and made them toe the
line academically," said Maggie
Kimball, an archivist for Stanford

library special collections.
The students improved and were allowed to keep their
houses.
In 1933 the "500" rule was revised in response to
increased enrollment. The number of women on campus
grew. With the influx of women came an increased demand

for sororities, but the number of
sororities did not change. This led
to a schism in the female student
body. According to Kimball, the
female student body was plagued
by excessive competition and seri
ous disunity.
Behavioral issues were also a
concern for sororities. Women's
dormitories were much stricter.

with regulations requiring girls to
sign out when leaving and saying when they would be back.
Sororities were less regulated. Some female students asked
that sororities be abolished.
"This was a way they could reunify the undergraduate
women," Kimball said.
As a result, in 1944 the Board of Trustees voted to ban
sororities. Although it has been rumored that this decision

was prompted by a suicide, Kimball
says that this was not the case.
While sororities were banned,
fraternities remained strong.
"What's unique about our frater
nities and sororities [at Stanford]..
. are that they've always been on
the cutting edge nationally," said
Joey Greenwell. assistant director
of student activities and adviser to
the interfraternity council.
In the 19605, many national
chapters had racial and religious

discriminatory policies, but several
fraternities at Stanford ignored them. In 1%5, Sigma Chi
was suspended by the national organization for pledging an
African-American member.
Fraternity Interest Declines,
Rebirth of Sororities
During the 1960s and 19705. Stanford's fraternities were
hit by a national trend — Greek life was becoming less

popular. Many fraternities had to sell their houses to the

University because of financial
hardships and the poor condition of
the buildings. Some fraternities
could not draw enough interest and
had to close. The development of
co-ed housing in the late 1960s also
contributed to a drop in Greek life
interest.
"A lot of chapters left by natural
attrition," Howe said.
However, in a Daily article pub
lished on Nov. 7. 1970, two fraterni
ty managers lamented that the
University strictness on bills and
debt was an effort to reduce the
number of housed fraternities.
"I wouldn't want to say that

Stanford is trying to cut down the
number of fraternities, but one might infer it." said Chuck
Kitsman, house manager of Delta Kappa Epsilon.
In the late 19705, students demanded that the University
allow sororities back on campus. The resurgence in sorority

interest was partly due to Title IX, which was passed in 1972

and prevented inequality in edu
cation. As a result, the ban on
sororities was lilted in 1977, but
Sororities did not regain housing
for another 20 years.
While interest in sorori
ties grew, fraternities continued
to suffer. In the 1980s student
housing was guaranteed for all
four years, which further
decreased interest in fraternities.

Also, three fraternities lost their houses because of behav
ioral issues. Howe noted that one fraternity lost its housing
privileges after someone threw a

burning couch out of a window.
Further stunting fraternity
growth, a policy known as the
"grandfather policy" was instated in
1985. This policy allowed fraternities
to keep their houses if they were
already housed, but once they lost
their houses they could not get them
back. This policy also excluded
sororities from being able to receive
on-campus housing.
Finally in 19%, the grandfather

clause was
revoked

and replaced by a policy that
allowed fraternities and sorori
ties to apply for housing.
"[This policy allows] the groups
that can be best at managing a
house, get a house," Howe said.
A Row task force rpan
dated that the Row could only be
25 percent Greek. Currently the
Row is at capacity for fraternities
and sororities, leaving much of
Stanford's Greek life unhoused.

Of Stanford's 26 sororities and
fraternities, seven fraternities and three sororities are
housed.
Un-houscd Greek Life
Many students do not feel that being unhoused is a hin
drance to Greek life.
"We do everything a housed sorority does," said Cristin

Carey, president of Omega Chi.
an un-housed sorority. "We just
don't have four walls to call our
own."
Howe said that there is a stereo
type on campus that all sororities
and fraternities are housed
organizations, hut the un-housed
Greek chapters prove this wrong.
Greenwell also stressed that,
"the individuals that [un-housed
sororities and fraternities] draw
are truly committed to their
organization."
Howe said that the increase in

other groups that could serve some of the same functions as
Greek organizations — a social network, community serv
ice, shared interests, and friendship — has decreased the
demand for Greek life.
"Initially there weren't as many groups to be a part of,"
she said. Today there are around 640 student organizations
on campus, whereas 10 years ago there were half as many.
"I think right now. the climate as is, we've reached a
dynamic equilibrium," Carey said. "We have enough [peo
ple] interested in Greek life to support the [current] sys
tem."
