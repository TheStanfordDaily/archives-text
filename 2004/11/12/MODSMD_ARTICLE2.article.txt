# Beavers have hopes for bowl bid
## 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Usually when a team starts out a season with a
1-4 record, it signals that team is in fora long, los
ing season. But Oregon State, which won only one
of its first five games, has turned its season around
and is in position to earn a third-straight bowl hid.
Like Stanford (4-5,2-4 Pacific-10 Conference),
Oregon State (4-5, 3-3) heads into tomorrow's
game at Stanford Stadium needing two wins to
finish with a winning record and become eligible.
"It's very obvious to everybody that we have
to win two games to be bowl-eligible," Oregon
State head coach Mike Riley said. "You can't win
two unless you win the next one, so that's why our
focus has to be exactly where it is."
While the Cardinal's bowl chances have dimin
ished with each passing week, Oregon State has
slowly re-entered the bowl picture. Many counted
the Beavers out after their fourth loss of the sea
son, a 49-7 defeat at the hands of California over
a month ago.
To figure out what kind of team Oregon State
\s, all one has to do is look at the teams that the
Beavers have faced. Of the team's five losses this
season, all five have come to teams ranked in the
Top 25, including three to teams ranked in the top
five at the time.
Oregon State opened the season with a heart
breaking 22-21 overtime loss to defending co-na
tional champion LSU, which was ranked No. 3 at
the time. The Beavers had a realistic chance to
win the game, but place-kicker Alexis Serna

missed three critical extra points, including one
that would have sent the game into a second over
time.
A week later, Oregon State traveled to the
blue turf in Boise, Idaho to face another highly
ranked team in Boise State. The Beavers were un
able to contain the Broncos high-octane offense,
dropping the game 55-34.
Oregon State picked up a victory the next week
over New Mexico before dropping twoÂ«more to
Arizona State and Cal.
But with the hardest stretch of the 2004 cam
paign behind them, the Beavers went on a three
game winning streak, with wins at Washington, at
home against Washington State and at Arizona.
"Our record was on the line, our support was
on the line, and we came out and really played
well," Oregon State quarterback Derek Ander
son said after the 29-24 victory over Washing
ton. It was a lot of fun."
The run of victories came to an end last week
for the Beavers, when they faced No. 1 USC.
While a dense fog rolled into Reser Stadium. Ore
gon State moved to a 13-0 lead, but couldn't hang
on and eventually lost 28-20.
"We played well, but we didn't play our best,"
Riley said. "We absolutely did not. So we've got
room for improvement and we've got a tough op
ponent. so that shifts the focus. But the motiva
tion can be that we did do some good things and
we can build on that."
The Beavers' resurgence has been led by the
number-two ranked pass offense in the Pac-10.

Derek Anderson is leading the Pac-10 in pass
ing yards per game and junior receiver Mike
Hass is first in the conference in receptions per
game and receiving yards per game.
"We're very capable," Riley said. "If we do
the things that we need to do that are necessary
to win this game, then I feel confident we can
win. If we don't, we won't."
The loser of this game will be knocked from
bowl contention and guaranteed a losing sea
son.
Oregon State wraps up its season at home
with the Civil War against in-state rival Ore
gon.
The road ahead for Stanford is clearly
tougher. After this weekend, the Cardinal
must go to Cal to face one of the nation's best
teams.
If the Beavers can pull off a victory over the
Cardinal and find a way to beat Oregon in an
always-emotional game. Oregon State could
turn what looked like a throwaway season into
a bowl berth.
