## The 						Big Picture Stem cells and over-the-top rhetoric 
### WILL NELSON 
Even in today's polarized polit
ical climate, few issues inspire
more caustic rhetoric than stem
cell research. This rhetoric often
ends up repulsing more moderates
than it persuades.
Sen. John Kerry and others ac
cuse President George W. Bush of
"turning his back on science," part
ly based on Bush's stance on stem
cell research.
However, there are a lot of mis
conceptions about Bush's policy on
stem-cell research. Scientists are
understandably excited about de
veloping new therapies using stem
cells. Already, medical researchers
have invented dozens of new ther
apies employing adult stem cells.
Adult stem cells can be harvested
with no loss of human life. In con
trast. embryonic stem cells are gath
ered by destroying human embryos.
To harvest embryonic stem
cells, a researcher grows a human
embryo until it contains a few
dozen cells. They then extract the
stem cells, causing the embryo to
be destroyed.
Many conservatives view this
process as a kind of primordial
murder and therefore oppose em
bryonic stem-cell research.
In response to conservative ap
peals. the Bush administration in
2001 directed that federal funds
cannot be used to create or exploit
new lines of embryonic stem cells.
The federal government will not
pay for research employing embry
onic stem cells harvested after the
directive came into effect.
This is not a ban on stem-cell re

search. It is not a ban on embryon
ic stem-cell research. It doesn't
even ban federal funds for embry
onic stem-cell research.
Instead, the Bush administration
found a reasonable compromise
between the desire for medical ad
vances and many Americans' deep
respect for human life in all its
forms.
Did Bush "turn his back on sci
ence" with this compromise, as his
detractors claim? No way. Not on
your life. Not on the life of an un
born human embryo.
It is easy to understand the per
spective of those opposed to Bush's
policy. A human embryo containing
just dozens of cells is microscopic
and undifferentiated. A flake of
skin floating through the air as a
dust particle might contain more
human cells than such an embryo.
On the other hand, any reason
able person must see that the con
servatives have a point. Science is
now capable of growing embryonic
human beings for use in scientific
research. Shouldn't that give us at
least some pause?
One must also respect the other
side's deeply help convictions.
These people are not anti-science.
They are not "primitivists," as
Maureen Dowd of The New York
Times would claim.
They just have deeply held con
victions about human life and the
sanctity of humanity's place in the
world.
If they err at all, it is in affording
life too much favorable treatment
rather than too little. One must
surely respect such a position,
though one may not agree with it.

We must reject over-the-top
rhetoric about Bush "turning his
hack on science" and try to under
stand both sides' opinions.
Another classic piece of rhetoric
that probably offends more people
than it persuades is many pro
choicers' claim that George W. is
"waging a war on women" in sup
porting pro-life policies.
The phrase may be catchy, but it
implies that the half of Americans
with pro-life tendencies suffer from
some type of violent misogyny.
Many conservatives oppose
abortion for the same reason they
oppose stem cell research: zealous
respect for human life. Overzeal
ous, maybe.
But their opinions are based on re
spect for human life, not misogyny.
Ultimately, Bush's compromise
policy on stem-cell research might
be too restrictive. For technical
reasons, embryonic stem-cell lines
currently eligible for federal re
search funds are limited in their
scientific value.
Perhaps a new compromise is in
order on embryonic stem cells.
How about supplying federal funds
for the creation of a small number
of new lines? Or funding research
on ways to prevent contamination
and degradation in new lines so we
won't have to destroy more em
bryos than necessary?
Finding a new compromise
would be a lot easier with a little
more respect and a lot less over
the-top rhetoric.
