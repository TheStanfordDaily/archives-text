## The 						surreal world: Life in Europe 
### JULIE PARK 
The Overseas Studies Program
at Stanford wants you to believe
that going abroad is easy, econom
ical and essential.
Sometimes people lie. I don't
care what Stanford says. If you're
not taking classes for your major
or fulfilling GERs, that's a $13,000
vacation right there, airfare not in
cluded. Still, it is easy to go, for
fuzzics. And il is essential, even for
techies.
If you don't go abroad, you are
fated to turn out like Jimmy Stew
art in It's a Wonderful Life, saying
you never got to see the world
right before you try to jump off a
bridge on Christmas Day. Or you
will become the middle-aged,
white-collar professional of mid
dling success, telling your therapist
about your unfulfilled life, saying,
I've never even been to Europe.
Then you will have a brief ex
tramarital affair, get caught, get di
vorced. mess up your kids (who
will hate you forever), die alone,
and go to hell for being a perfectly
average human being.
Don't be that person. It can all
be avoided with one single choice,
one simple imperative. Go abroad.
(See? Easy >
I will even tell you about the
greatness and craziness of the Old
World since I am in it.
First, in Florence, there's great
beauty all around you. Think red
tiled roofs, everywhere. (No. Not
like Stanford. Decrepit and gritty,
like the real world, not Disney
World.) You see loads of pretty ar
chitecture. right behind the crowds
of Lands End-wearing American
retirees following their tour
guides.
Secondly, animal abuse is clear
ly a global problem. A few Euro
peans have their own style, howev
er.
Got a fluffy little Pomeranian
on a leash? Good. Now. as you
walk, drag it along like it's not a
real animal, ignoring altogether
that its little feet are skidding
across the rough sidewalk.
Everyday living is fun. too.
Do you need to do laundry
every couple of weeks when you
run out of underwear? Me, too.
If you thought paying $2 to
wash and dry one load at Stanford
was too much (which it is), you will
enjoy knowing it costs $8 to wash
and dry one load at your neighbor
hood self-service laundromat
here. Also, it is important to ap
preciate the great enlightened na
tion where people actually own
drvers in their homes — since you

live there.
When it gets cold, which it in
variably dues, do as I do. Ask your
host family for an extra blanket.
Wear socks to bed. Turn on your
desk lamp and put your hands un
derneath the hot bulb. Use your
laptop as a hand heater by typing
on the warm keyboard.
Yes, I really did all of that. I
even wore gloves inside my room
before. 1 don't care what country
I'm in, if I'm cold, I should be able
to get warm. That's just very
wrong.
It is illegal to use heaters before
Nov. 1 in Italy. That's also very in
correct. Should you plug in a
heater and get caught, you will be
fined by the police. I know you
think otherwise, but I'll correct
you: Communism isn't dead in the
Western world. It's just called
other names in some democracies.
Italian men are well-known as
lotharios. Is it true? Yes, of course
some are. If you're blond, you'd
better watch out. Some will be
dirty, dirty, dirty. Luckily for me,
if they think you are either wholly
unattractive or a Japanese tourist,
or both, they don't bother you ex
cept to say sayonara to you on oc
casion. (I'm not really Japanese,
and 1 didn't know I was amazingly
ugly, but hey, it's much better than
being sexually harassed and
flashed.)
I am also learning about nutri
tion. Did you know that margarine
is better for your health than but
ter? Yes, that is what my European
friends tell me one evening as they
extol the benefits of the Mediter
ranean diet and feed me its an
tithesis. I am torn between telling
them the deadly truth about hy
drogenated fat and being polite,
and I choose to be polite and short
en my life span by eating the fistful
of trans fats coating the pasta.
But life in Europe is not all
about silly Americans who balk at
high prices, harassment, and pre
mature death. It's also about
Americans who fail to blend in.
Km not sure why you would care if
you didn't blend in, but if you
think Europeans dress well, or
badly for that matter, read on.
If you want to look European,
it's hard. You can't just hate Bush
like the rest of Europe. Many
Americans don't look all that dif
ferent from their European coun
terparts. unless you are one of
those American students wearing
varsity sweatshirts, nubbly fleece
pullovers and North Face back
packs. Therefore, you must be
very precise about the way you ac
cessorize. and ditch the preppy

athletic white person gear.
First, you must wear ugly-ass
sneakers. They must look like the
donkey offspring of soccer cleats
and bowling shoes. Pumas can
work. Just make sure they're in
strange, mismatched colors and
give you cloven-toed marsupial
feet. Want a dressier look? You
can also stuff your jeans into knee
high boots. Vou will think you
look good, hut really people will
just know how tall your boots are.
No matter how old you are, you
must wear a scarf. Make sure you
wear it at all times, especially when
indoors or when the weather is ex
tremely warm.
You can carry an obviously fake
Gucci bag— if you are not already
carrying a fake Louis Vuitton with
an incorrect pattern. This is impor
tant, because if you are a real, reg
ular European, you will have no
shame when it comes to toting con
spicuously fake Italian or French
designer goods.
It is better if you have a dog on
a leash. Make sure it sullies the
sidewalks everywhere it goes, and
don't bother looking back to clean
it up. Pet your dog and praise it
when it pees on lamp posts. This
way, you help the city use taxpayer
euros to hire people to pour pitch
ers of alcohol onto your dog's pet
rified stink bomb and to scrub it
away with brooms.
Lastly, whenever you take a
stroll, as Florentines so often do.
smoke your cigarettes so that the
nearly invisible yet voluminous
cloud of deadly smoke trailing be
hind you will engulf everyone fol
lowing you on the narrow side
walk.
Oh. This is clearly not why you
should come to Europe.
Beneath the smoke, the
cityscape is so beautiful you'll stop
muttering complaints even if you
don't stop coughing. You'll eat
gelato whenever you wish. You
may even end up in Paperback Ex
change on Via Fiesolana in Flo
rence thanking your lucky stars
that books in English other than
The Da Vinci Code do exist
abroad.
But most importantly, if you
live in another country at least
once in your life, you will bypass
the horrid stereotypical mid-life
crisis of an American whose two
kids, two-car dream has gone sadly
awry, knocking that whole mess
off the list of "Fates to Avoid."

you never got to see the world
right before you try to jump off a
bridge on Christmas Day. Or you
will become the middle-aged,
white-collar professional of mid
dling success, telling your therapist
about your unfulfilled life, saying,
I've never even been to Europe.
Then you will have a brief ex
tramarital affair, get caught, get di
vorced. mess up your kids (who
will hate you forever), die alone,
and go to hell for being a perfectly
average human being.
Don't be that person. It can all
be avoided with one single choice,
one simple imperative. Go abroad.
(See? Easy >
I will even tell you about the
greatness and craziness of the Old
World since I am in it.
First, in Florence, there's great
beauty all around you. Think red
tiled roofs, everywhere. (No. Not
like Stanford. Decrepit and gritty,
like the real world, not Disney
World.) You see loads of pretty ar
chitecture. right behind the crowds
of Lands End-wearing American
retirees following their tour
guides.
Secondly, animal abuse is clear
ly a global problem. A few Euro
peans have their own style, howev
er.
Got a fluffy little Pomeranian
on a leash? Good. Now. as you
walk, drag it along like it's not a
real animal, ignoring altogether
that its little feet are skidding
across the rough sidewalk.
Everyday living is fun. too.
Do you need to do laundry
every couple of weeks when you
run out of underwear? Me, too.
If you thought paying $2 to
wash and dry one load at Stanford
was too much (which it is), you will
enjoy knowing it costs $8 to wash
and dry one load at your neighbor
hood self-service laundromat
here. Also, it is important to ap
preciate the great enlightened na
tion where people actually own
drvers in their homes — since you

live there.
When it gets cold, which it in
variably dues, do as I do. Ask your
host family for an extra blanket.
Wear socks to bed. Turn on your
desk lamp and put your hands un
derneath the hot bulb. Use your
laptop as a hand heater by typing
on the warm keyboard.
Yes, I really did all of that. I
even wore gloves inside my room
before. 1 don't care what country
I'm in, if I'm cold, I should be able
to get warm. That's just very
wrong.
It is illegal to use heaters before
Nov. 1 in Italy. That's also very in
correct. Should you plug in a
heater and get caught, you will be
fined by the police. I know you
think otherwise, but I'll correct
you: Communism isn't dead in the
Western world. It's just called
other names in some democracies.
Italian men are well-known as
lotharios. Is it true? Yes, of course
some are. If you're blond, you'd
better watch out. Some will be
dirty, dirty, dirty. Luckily for me,
if they think you are either wholly
unattractive or a Japanese tourist,
or both, they don't bother you ex
cept to say sayonara to you on oc
casion. (I'm not really Japanese,
and 1 didn't know I was amazingly
ugly, but hey, it's much better than
being sexually harassed and
flashed.)
I am also learning about nutri
tion. Did you know that margarine
is better for your health than but
ter? Yes, that is what my European
friends tell me one evening as they
extol the benefits of the Mediter
ranean diet and feed me its an
tithesis. I am torn between telling
them the deadly truth about hy
drogenated fat and being polite,
and I choose to be polite and short
en my life span by eating the fistful
of trans fats coating the pasta.
But life in Europe is not all
about silly Americans who balk at
high prices, harassment, and pre
mature death. It's also about
Americans who fail to blend in.
Km not sure why you would care if
you didn't blend in, but if you
think Europeans dress well, or
badly for that matter, read on.
If you want to look European,
it's hard. You can't just hate Bush
like the rest of Europe. Many
Americans don't look all that dif
ferent from their European coun
terparts. unless you are one of
those American students wearing
varsity sweatshirts, nubbly fleece
pullovers and North Face back
packs. Therefore, you must be
very precise about the way you ac
cessorize. and ditch the preppy

athletic white person gear.
First, you must wear ugly-ass
sneakers. They must look like the
donkey offspring of soccer cleats
and bowling shoes. Pumas can
work. Just make sure they're in
strange, mismatched colors and
give you cloven-toed marsupial
feet. Want a dressier look? You
can also stuff your jeans into knee
high boots. Vou will think you
look good, hut really people will
just know how tall your boots are.
No matter how old you are, you
must wear a scarf. Make sure you
wear it at all times, especially when
indoors or when the weather is ex
tremely warm.
You can carry an obviously fake
Gucci bag— if you are not already
carrying a fake Louis Vuitton with
an incorrect pattern. This is impor
tant, because if you are a real, reg
ular European, you will have no
shame when it comes to toting con
spicuously fake Italian or French
designer goods.
It is better if you have a dog on
a leash. Make sure it sullies the
sidewalks everywhere it goes, and
don't bother looking back to clean
it up. Pet your dog and praise it
when it pees on lamp posts. This
way, you help the city use taxpayer
euros to hire people to pour pitch
ers of alcohol onto your dog's pet
rified stink bomb and to scrub it
away with brooms.
Lastly, whenever you take a
stroll, as Florentines so often do.
smoke your cigarettes so that the
nearly invisible yet voluminous
cloud of deadly smoke trailing be
hind you will engulf everyone fol
lowing you on the narrow side
walk.
Oh. This is clearly not why you
should come to Europe.
Beneath the smoke, the
cityscape is so beautiful you'll stop
muttering complaints even if you
don't stop coughing. You'll eat
gelato whenever you wish. You
may even end up in Paperback Ex
change on Via Fiesolana in Flo
rence thanking your lucky stars
that books in English other than
The Da Vinci Code do exist
abroad.
But most importantly, if you
live in another country at least
once in your life, you will bypass
the horrid stereotypical mid-life
crisis of an American whose two
kids, two-car dream has gone sadly
awry, knocking that whole mess
off the list of "Fates to Avoid."

The Overseas Studies Program
at Stanford wants you to believe
that going abroad is easy, econom
ical and essential.
Sometimes people lie. I don't
care what Stanford says. If you're
not taking classes for your major
or fulfilling GERs, that's a $13,000
vacation right there, airfare not in
cluded. Still, it is easy to go, for
fuzzics. And il is essential, even for
