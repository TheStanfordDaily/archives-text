# Irrational Exuberance
## The 						success of art in America 
### 
One underappreciated as
pect of America that al
ways amazes me starts
with the World's Fair of
1889. Paris premiers the Eiffel
Tower; the world's governments
turn out to show off their might —
all except for the United States. The
government of the United States
takes no part, and instead the U.S.
pavilion is entirely privately funded

by representa
tives of U.S. in
dustries like
Carnegie and
Rockefeller.
Flash forward
to 2(M)4: The first
thing that struck
me about the
Olympic games
this past summer
was how many
Stanford-affiliated
athletes there were

The second thing was the price
tag that Greek taxpayers had to pay.
Every man, woman and child in
Greece is paying over $600 for the
Olympics. Fora typical family of
four, that's $2,4(X).
Admittedly a lot of it is for infras
tructure, but fora country whose per
capita GDP is around $12,(XX), that's
nearly three months income.
Are the citizens of Greece well
served? Maybe.
Compare this system to the Unit
ed States, where the U.S. Olympic
Commission is entirely privately
funded and paid for only by people
who chose to do so. The games in
Atlanta are a good example of this
spirit. What is amazing is that in
America, people voluntarily con
tribute rather than being forced to.
In the arts, the U.S. government
indeed spends a paltry amount, and
we are seen as a nation of philistines
because of it. Yet, the country as a
whole spends loads more on art per
capita than any other.
This summer, 1 was visiting the
Bellagio super-hotel at Vegas,
where people are paying $15 a pop
fora small gallery filled with 15 less

er Monets, and it was crowded to ca
pacity. The price tag for the Muse
um of Modern Art in New York has
now topped $20, although it is a flex
ible price enabling people who can
not afford it to go for free on some
nights. The Metropolitan Museum
has a similar pricing policy. Ameri
can art is privately funded without
restricting access.
Nearly all the museums in Wash
ington, D.C., are open free to the
public. This level of access has re
cently been matched outside of the
United States but only in London at
considerable expense to the British
government.
The United States is a country
where the amount of money I am
forced to spend on art is minimal,
yet art flourishes — because people
choose to support what they like.
According to The Statistical Ab
stract of the United States, Ameri
cans spend more on the performing
arts than on movies or on sports.
The average American is more like
ly to attend a museum than a foot
ball game. Americans are also more
likely to attend a museum than the
average Frenchman.
On a personal note, every time
I've been to the Louvre, the number
of Americans always seemed to out
number the French.
It's amazing, but if you look at
the top-10 highest grossing movies
in France at any given time, eight of
them are American. If you walk into
a French bookstore, it seems like
most of the best-selling books are
translations of American authors. I
was once standing in the science-fic
tion section of a French bookstore
and asked someone fora recom
mendation fora French sci-fi writer
and got a laugh.
From sports to pop culture to
high art, America's hands-off, let
the-people-decide approach has al
lowed it preeminence, which is one
more thing to be proud of.
