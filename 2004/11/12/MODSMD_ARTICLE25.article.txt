Mountain biking bad for nature
How about telling the truth about
mountain biking? ("Scars optional:
rough roading with Stanford cycling
club," Nov. 11) You are, after all, a
university. Mountain biking is one of
the most destructive activities al
lowed in any park. Besides accelerat
ing erosion, creating V-shaped ruts
(making walking difficult or danger
ous). driving away wildlife and other
trail users and killing numerous small
animals and plants, it poses a big risk
to its practitioners.
Recently a biker paralyzed himself
from the neck down. This is very bad
role modeling for our children. For

People with family values should
value their families
Did you know that Massachusetts
has the lowest divorce rate in the coun
try? Try this on for size: Nine of the top
10 lowest divorce rates are in blue
states. 10 of the top 10 highest divorce
rates are in red states. Talk about fam
ily values.
Oh, and the states that voted to ban
gay marriage have a much higher di
vorce rate, on average, than the aver
age for all of America. Boy, is reality
fun.
But I suppose it is logical for the
states with the highest divorce
rates to vote for Bush based on the
morality he promises to bring.

Don't have a job? Vote for Kerry.
Don't have a conscience? Vote for
Bush.

Bush appoints minorities
I would direct Stanford students to
the fact that Republicans — Bush in
particular — appoint minorities to
high positions. Take Powell and Rice.
Democrats pander for minority
votes, but few Democrats that are mi
norites are in positions of power.
Intelligent students should
place more value on action than on
propaganda.
