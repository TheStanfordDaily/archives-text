## Jeff Dorman Sucks! There's nothing like rooting for the underdog 
### 
r l his column is for you.
Yes, you.
I'm writing this column for an audience of
one, and I want each and every one of you to
take it to heart.
I'm writing this for you, freshman guy. I see
you eating your chicken sandwich in Roble, so

modest that you still wear a
bathing suit to shower in the
coed bathroom.
I'm writing this for you,
international grad student. I
see you struggling to cross
the street, still unclear on the
concept of pedestrian right of
way. Jeff Dorman, the mas
ter's candidate who recently
propositioned my girlfriend
on thefacebook.com, I'm
writing this for you.

I'm even writing this for you, Stanford pro
fessors. I see you keeping my class late, not
noticing me play poker through lecture, and
calling my essay on the Federalist Papers "rep
rehensible" (actually happened).
I'm writing this for all of us, because we all
have to take a long, hard look at ourselves.
All across this great nation, college campuses
are gearing up for some of the most exciting
times of the year. In Norman (that's Oklahoma),
they're riding the successes of two potential
Heisman winners. In L. A., they're looking to re
peat as the true National Champion, and in
South Bend, they're trying to figure out just
"Nch Irish team is going to show up this week.
Vut in Stanford, there is more buzz about
" T aguna Beach" than Stanford Football. In
u'.st half hour, I've heard no fewer than
thsoe conversations comparing L.C. to Kris
ten, and zero mentioning that EVERY STU
DENT WITH A SUID GETS IN FOR FREE
TO SATURDAY'S GAME.
But this isn't a negative column. I'm not
here to be the curmudgeonly senior sports
columnist, angry at the sports apathy that Stan-

you're out of excuses

ford students are so often reported
as having. I'm not here to come
down on you. I'm not here to hate.
I'm here to congratulate.
Call me optimistic, call me dude,
call me bro, call me dude-bro, but
I'm here to tell you why you should
be at this Saturday's game.
Three words: underdog at home.
There is no better fan situation
than to be rooting for an underdog at
home. None.
Here's why:
It's my senior year of high school,
with the varsity basketball team aim
ing for another above-average sea
son. I was one of eight kids that reli
giously attended every game — it
was second semester of senior year,
and I was livin* it up. For those of
you keeping track, I had yet to have
a serious girlfriend.
But anyway, it was winter break
and the basketball team had a game,
a non-conference fiasco against a
team from the boonies. My high
school, with a population of 350,
wasn't in the business of attracting
large crowds to games, so when the
eight of us found ourselves facing
250 enemy students in our home
gvm, we were floored.

My high school didn't even have a
cheerleading team. Their high
school brought three — Varsity, JV,
and Frosh.
That night was the greatest night
of my sports-fanaticism life. We
were underdogs, not expecting to
even keep it close to the juvenile de
tention facility masquerading as a
high school. Every basket was a pre
sent, every steal a gift, and every mo
mentum swing for the good guys a
goddamned miracle.
And t he eight of us were living it up.
When their power forward
flashed his gold-plated teeth at us,
we chanted "dental hygiene." When
their J V cheerleading squad showed
their white panties underneath their
skirts, we yelled, "dirty diapers."
And when the chips were down, we
started screaming "toilet cleaner."
(To this day I'm not really sure what
that one was all about).
But here's the thing: With noth
ing to lose, the fans had everything
to scream for. We pulled, we yelled,
we danced and we sang.
And when the Marin Academy
Wildcats pulled it out in the final
minutes, we walked out of that gym
as the kings of Northern California

high school basketball.
The Stanford football team is 4-5,
with two games left to play. Conve
niently, we need two wins to become
bowl-eligible.
We are underdogs at home to a
very beatable Oregon State team,
and with free tickets for everyone,
there is no reason for you not to be
there.
Postpone your meetings. Call
your long-distance boyfriend after
we win. Study on Sunday. For once
in your Stanford career, get behind
a cause that you can't lead. Be part
of the pack, a faceless one of many,
and idolize those athletes. You
may not care, you may hate foot
ball, you may say that you have
three more tries.
Well, I'm a senior, two underdog
victories will get us to the Las Vegas
Bowl, and 1 've got my eyes on a suite
at the MGM Grand.
Saturday. Oregon State.
Be there.

Spencer Porter, a senior, will not be at
the game, because he'll be in Berkeley,
playing soccer against Cal in the
biggest game of his season. Score on
him at portersGPstanford.edu.

their white panties underneath their
skirts, we yelled, "dirty diapers."
And when the chips were down, we
started screaming "toilet cleaner."
(To this day I'm not really sure what
that one was all about).
But here's the thing: With noth
ing to lose, the fans had everything
to scream for. We pulled, we yelled,
we danced and we sang.
And when the Marin Academy
Wildcats pulled it out in the final
minutes, we walked out of that gym
as the kings of Northern California

high school basketball.
The Stanford football team is 4-5,
with two games left to play. Conve
niently, we need two wins to become
bowl-eligible.
We are underdogs at home to a
very beatable Oregon State team,
and with free tickets for everyone,
there is no reason for you not to be
there.
Postpone your meetings. Call
your long-distance boyfriend after
we win. Study on Sunday. For once
in your Stanford career, get behind
a cause that you can't lead. Be part
of the pack, a faceless one of many,
and idolize those athletes. You
may not care, you may hate foot
ball, you may say that you have
three more tries.
Well, I'm a senior, two underdog
victories will get us to the Las Vegas
Bowl, and 1 've got my eyes on a suite
at the MGM Grand.
Saturday. Oregon State.
Be there.

Spencer Porter, a senior, will not be at
the game, because he'll be in Berkeley,
playing soccer against Cal in the
biggest game of his season. Score on
him at portersGPstanford.edu.

Yes, you.
I'm writing this column for an audience of

take it to heart.
I'm writing this for you, freshman guy. I see
you eating your chicken sandwich in Roble, so

modest that you still wear a
bathing suit to shower in the
coed bathroom.
I'm writing this for you,
international grad student. I
see you struggling to cross
the street, still unclear on the
concept of pedestrian right of
way. Jeff Dorman, the mas

propositioned my girlfriend
on thefacebook.com, I'm
writing this for you.

I'm even writing this for you, Stanford pro
fessors. I see you keeping my class late, not
noticing me play poker through lecture, and
calling my essay on the Federalist Papers "rep
rehensible" (actually happened).
I'm writing this for all of us, because we all
have to take a long, hard look at ourselves.
All across this great nation, college campuses
are gearing up for some of the most exciting
times of the year. In Norman (that's Oklahoma),
they're riding the successes of two potential
Heisman winners. In L. A., they're looking to re
peat as the true National Champion, and in
South Bend, they're trying to figure out just
"Nch Irish team is going to show up this week.
Vut in Stanford, there is more buzz about
" T aguna Beach" than Stanford Football. In
u'.st half hour, I've heard no fewer than
thsoe conversations comparing L.C. to Kris

TO SATURDAY'S GAME.
But this isn't a negative column. I'm not
here to be the curmudgeonly senior sports
columnist, angry at the sports apathy that Stan-

you're out of excuses

ford students are so often reported
as having. I'm not here to come
down on you. I'm not here to hate.
I'm here to congratulate.
Call me optimistic, call me dude,
call me bro, call me dude-bro, but
I'm here to tell you why you should
be at this Saturday's game.
Three words: underdog at home.
There is no better fan situation
than to be rooting for an underdog at
home. None.
Here's why:
It's my senior year of high school,
with the varsity basketball team aim
ing for another above-average sea
son. I was one of eight kids that reli
giously attended every game — it
was second semester of senior year,
and I was livin* it up. For those of
you keeping track, I had yet to have
a serious girlfriend.
But anyway, it was winter break
and the basketball team had a game,
a non-conference fiasco against a
team from the boonies. My high
school, with a population of 350,
wasn't in the business of attracting
large crowds to games, so when the
eight of us found ourselves facing
250 enemy students in our home
gvm, we were floored.

My high school didn't even have a
cheerleading team. Their high
school brought three — Varsity, JV,
and Frosh.
That night was the greatest night
of my sports-fanaticism life. We
were underdogs, not expecting to
even keep it close to the juvenile de
tention facility masquerading as a
high school. Every basket was a pre
sent, every steal a gift, and every mo
mentum swing for the good guys a
goddamned miracle.
And t he eight of us were living it up.
When their power forward
flashed his gold-plated teeth at us,
we chanted "dental hygiene." When
their J V cheerleading squad showed
their white panties underneath their
skirts, we yelled, "dirty diapers."
And when the chips were down, we
started screaming "toilet cleaner."
(To this day I'm not really sure what
that one was all about).
