# Card begin NCAA Tournament play
## Women's soccer to face Cal Poly in first-round match at Buck Shaw Stadium 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's soccer team is
headed to a remarkable seventh straight
NCAA College Cup tournament after
earning an at-large bid on Monday. The
No. 25 Cardinal (12-5-3, 4-3-2 Pacific-10
Conference) join a 64-team field that in
cludes powerhouses North Carolina,
Penn State, Notre Dame and Portland.
Stanford, Washington and California,
which earned at-large bids, will join Pac
-10 co-champs and automatic bid recipi
ents UCLA and Arizona as the Pac-10's
representatives in the tournament.
The Cardinal were placed in a compet
itive but favorable opening bracket that
includes Cal Poly, Santa Clara and Cali
fornia. They will take on the Mustangs in
game one today at Buck Shaw Stadium at
Santa Clara and, should they win, will
take on the winner of the Broncos-Bears
match-up on Sunday.
"Any team will be a challenge in the
NCAA tournament because it is single
elimination/' said sophomore defender
Shari Summers. "The bracket we got is
great and we are willing to face anyone."
The Cardinal finished up their regu
lar season last weekend with a pair of
disappointing performances against
conference rivals No. 14 Washington
(14-4-1, 5-3-1) and Washington State
(8-7-4, 3-4-2). On Friday night the Car
dinal suffered a 1-0 loss to the Huskies,
who tallied the game-winner with a lit
tle under three minutes remaining in
the second overtime.
The loss may have been easier to swal
low had the Cardinal been able to salvage
their weekend with a win over the
Cougars two days later. Unfortunately,
the Cardinal offense struggled to find the
net and finished with a scoreless tie.
Despite taking 19 shots over the two
game span, the Cardinal struggled to com
plete their offensive drives with goals.
The inability to finish has plagued the
Cardinal throughout the season, as the

team finished the regular season ranked
seventh in goals per game and sixth in
total points in the Pac-10. Among the
Pac-10 teams headed to the tournament,
the Cardinal rank a distant last in all
major offensive categories.
To compete against the strong field
in the NCAA tournament, the Cardi
nal will have to do a better job of capi
talizing on their scoring opportunities.
"Offensively we need to score a lot to
give us confidence," Summers said. "De
fensively we are hoping fora shutout.
That kind of win would be a great confi
dence-booster for the following game."
Fortunately, the Cardinal are as
strong as anyone on the defensive end
of the ball, thanks in large part to senior
goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart. Stanford
recorded 12 shutouts this season and
led the Pac-10 in that category.
Today's game could prove to be a de
fensive struggle, as Cal Poly also relies
heavily on defense to win games. They
posted 10 shutouts in the regular season,
allowing just 12 goals in their final 19
games.
The Mustangs have been on a charge
of late, winning five of their final six reg
ular season match-ups. They knocked off
conference powerhouses Cal State-
Fullerton and UC-Santa Barbara in the
Big West Tournament to earn an auto
matic bid to the NCAA tournament for
the third year in a row.
The Cardinal's main goal will be to
stop forward Sharon Day, who led the
Mustangs with 11 goals and 23 points in
the regular season. The sophomore has
accounted for almost half of her team's
goals this season.
The Cardinal and Mustangs have
squared off three times in the past, with
each game going in the Cardinal's favor.
Most recently, the Cardinal grabbed a 4-
0 victory from the Mustangs in the first
round of the 2002 playoffs.
"They're a beatable team." said ju
nior defender Lindsey Hunt. "But I'm
sure they'll have a lot of energy and
fight."
Before the Cardinal-Mustang match
up. the Santa Clara and Cal will go head
to-head in their first-round game.
The two teams squared off earlier in
the season at Buck Shaw Stadium, where
the Broncos pulled off a 3-1 upset.
The Cardinal, should they make it out

of the first round, will face the winner of
that match-up on Sunday at noon. The
Cardinal played both teams earlier in the
season, finishing with a 0-0 tie against the
Broncos and a 1-1 tie against the Bears.
While disappointed not to be playing
at home this weekend, the Cardinal are
thankful they are at least still in the Bay
Area. Fellow Pac-10 conference teams

Arizona and Washington were sent to
Connecticut and Alabama, respectively,
for their first round games.
"It's a little disappointing to be away
from home, but we've played at Buck
Shaw Stadium so many times this year,
it's become familiar to all of us," Hunt
said.
Kick-off today is set for 4:30 p.m.
