## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Freshman guard Candice Wiggins and
junior center Brooke Smith provided two
reasons to buy into the excitement sur
rounding the No. 7 Stanford women's bas
ketball team's coming season.
Both players made impressive debuts in
the Cardinal's 78-48 victory over Baden
Sports in an exhibition game last night at the
Leavey Center at Santa Clara.
Wiggins, one of the Cardinal's most
highly touted recruits in recent memory,
scored on a driving layup on the game's first
possession and finished with 18 points,
seven rebounds and four blocks.
Smith, a transfer from Duke, finished
with eight points and 10 rebounds in her
Stanford debut after being forced to sit out
all of last season per NCAA rules.
Sophomore center Kristen Newlin
added 14 points and 11 boards in the victo
ry-
"We did some nice things," said head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "This was a good
learning experience and we'll continue to

work hard."
Seniors Kelley Suminski, Sebnem Kimy
acioglu, T'Nae Thiel and Azella Perryman
combined for 23 points and 15 rebounds for
the Cardinal, which shot 42 percent from the
field. Stanford outrebounded Baden 54-25.
Senior guard Susan Borchardt missed the
game due to soreness in her foot.
Stanford concludes its exhibition sched
ule this Sunday when it takes on Love & Bas
ketball at 2 p.m. The team, comprised of
Southern California residents, has posted a
4-1 record this preseason, including wins
over Pepperdine and UCLA.
Men set for tune-up
After losing four players and head coach
Mike Montgomery from last year's team,
which went 30-2 and captured the Pac-10
title, the Cardinal usher in the Trent John
son era with their only exhibition game of
the season tomorrow against Concordia
(Calif.) at 1 p.m. at Santa Clara.
Stanford, picked to finish third in the Pa
cific-10 conference behind Arizona and
Washington, will rely heavily on the veteran

leadership of seniors Rob Little and Nick
Robinson and junior point guard Chris Her
nandez this season.
"This team's going to forge its own iden
tity beyond what we did last year," Little
said. "That will start with the exhibition
game, working out kinks, getting used to
new people on the court, getting used to
being in front of a crowd and getting our
freshman on the floor for the first time."
Saturday's game will mark the collegiate
debuts of true freshmen Taj Finger and
Peter Prowitt.
In April, the NCAA passed legislation
barring men's college basketball teams from
scheduling exhibition games against non
collegiate opponents, which has made for
some lopsided scores this exhibition season.
Virginia defeated Division 111 Lehman Col
lege 121-29 last weekend.
Stanford doesn't figure to have quite as
easy a time with Concordia on Saturday.
Eagles head coach Ken Ammann, a former
Stanford guard who was captain of the Car
dinal team that captured the 1991 NIT title,
has led the Eagles to back-to-back appear
ances in the NAIA Championship game.
