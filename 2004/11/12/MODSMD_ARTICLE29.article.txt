### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The top-ranked women and No. 2 men's
cross country teams both look for their
fourth consecutive victories this weekend
as they travel to Fresno, Calif., to compete
at the West Regionals.
Hopefully the momentum from wins at
Fac-lOs and in their three previous meets
will carry over through this Saturday s
meet.
This weekend's meet is one of nine re
gional meets throughout the country held
to qualify teams for the NC AA C hampi
onships on Nov. 22 in Terre Haute, Ind.
The top two teams in each region automat
ically qualify for the championships along
with 13 teams that will be awarded at-large
berths. In addition to Stanford, schools
from Arizona, California, Oregon and
Washington comprise the West Regional
field.
The men are looking to capture their

ninth straight Western Regional crown,
while the women can claim their sixth con
secutive title and ninth in the past 10 years.
Senior Alicia Craig views this week
end's meet as a qualifying round.
"The main focus of the race is to quali
fy with as little effort as possible," Craig
said. "Therefore, it will be important in
the race for us to stay relaxed and in con
trol, while at the same time running ag
gressively enough to place us in the top
two and to finish high enough personally
to give ourselves some confidence going
into nationals."
Senior Ryan Hall agrees that the main
objective of this meet is to qualify for the
championships, which will be held a little
over one week later.
"It is treated very much like a trial of a
track race," he said. "Of course we would
love to win and are excited to compete, but
our major objective is to qualify and to run
