### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The top-ranked women and No. 2 men's
cross country teams both look for their
fourth consecutive victories this weekend
as they travel to Fresno, Calif., to compete
at the West Regionals.
Hopefully the momentum from wins at
Fac-lOs and in their three previous meets
will carry over through this Saturday s
meet.
This weekend's meet is one of nine re
gional meets throughout the country held
to qualify teams for the NC AA C hampi
onships on Nov. 22 in Terre Haute, Ind.
The top two teams in each region automat
ically qualify for the championships along
with 13 teams that will be awarded at-large
berths. In addition to Stanford, schools
from Arizona, California, Oregon and
Washington comprise the West Regional
field.
The men are looking to capture their

ninth straight Western Regional crown,
while the women can claim their sixth con
secutive title and ninth in the past 10 years.
Senior Alicia Craig views this week
end's meet as a qualifying round.
"The main focus of the race is to quali
fy with as little effort as possible," Craig
said. "Therefore, it will be important in
the race for us to stay relaxed and in con
trol, while at the same time running ag
gressively enough to place us in the top
two and to finish high enough personally
to give ourselves some confidence going
into nationals."
Senior Ryan Hall agrees that the main
objective of this meet is to qualify for the
championships, which will be held a little
over one week later.
"It is treated very much like a trial of a
track race," he said. "Of course we would
love to win and are excited to compete, but
our major objective is to qualify and to run

The Stanford women's cross country team is seek
ing its sixth consecutive Western Regionals title.
Runners hope to repeat
2003 Regionals title run

in such a way that we are prepared to
go to the well nine days later when it
really counts."
Last year, both teams secured
spots in the championships by claim
ing team titles as well as individual
titles. While Stanford had five finish
ers in the top six. all have graduated
except for Hall. Then-senior lan
Dobson ran to a first-place finish,
one second ahead of Hall. The team
finished with 18 points, placing a
huge margin between itself and sec
ond-place Cal Poly, who finished
with 110 points.
For the women, Craig captured
the individual title for the second
straight year. Senior Sara Bei
placed third, and sophomore
Amanda Trotter and seniors Jeane
Goff and Anita Siraki also finished
in the top 10.
Both the men and women are
coming off a Pac-10 Championship
victory at Golden Gate Park. In ad
dition to the team titles, Stanford

looks to claim the individual titles
this weekend. While the individual
titles eluded the team at Pac-lOs,
the Cardinal men placed six run
ners and the women placed seven
in the top 20.
Men's head coach Andy Gerard
feels as though the team has done a
good job of training and is now in the
final stages of preparation for the
conclusion of the season.
"All the physical preparation has
gone very well the last two weeks,"
Gerard said. "Now, we are just look
ing to be rested, recovered and re
freshed going into the race and
preparing emotionally and mentally
for the final two meets. All we have
to do is get mentally ready and we'll
be all set."
With the end of their Cardinal ca
reers quickly approaching, Craig
and Hall are both excited about rac
ing as part of such a talented team.
"The girls that will be racing at
Reeionals and Nationals are in

great shape and ready to run well,"
Craig said. "We are fortunate
enough to have a large group of tal
ented and hardworking girls to
draw from. I know that we are all
excited to race and count it a bless
ing to be taking such a wonderful
team to Nationals."
Hall also noted the depth, talent
and skill present on the team and
said each team member has some
thing huge to contribute.
"Our guys have run better and
better every week," he said. "I feel
like the more races we get under our
belt, the better we will be at NCA As.
It has also been exciting to see each
guy having huge races throughout
the season. Nef [Araia] and Jacob
[Gomez] ran great at (Pre-Nation
als], and David Vidal and Brett
Gotcher came up huge for us at Pac
1 Os. 1 feel like if each guy has his best
performance at NCAAs we are
going to surprise some people. It's
an exciting time of year."
