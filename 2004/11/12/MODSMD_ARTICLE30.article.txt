### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the second straight match, the
No. 11 Stanford women's volleyball

win came as no surprise.

straight games at Burnham Pavilion,

Game 2.
Stanford built an 11-7 lead in Game 3,
hut Oregon battled back to tie the game at
17 and force Stanford to call its first time
out. A kill by freshman middle-blocker
