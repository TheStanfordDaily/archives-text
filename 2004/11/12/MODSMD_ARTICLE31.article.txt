# Water polo sends off five seniors in homestand against Bears
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
As the seniors on this year's Stanford
men's water polo team (18-3, 6-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) look back on their
careers on the Farm, one game that sticks out
is the Cardinal's 7-6 victory over Cal to cap
ture the 2002 National Championship.
No. 2 Stanford need only point to that
win as proof that it's been the Bay Area's —
and perhaps the nation's — best team over
the last few years.
But No. 4 Cal (17-7,2-4) has a storied his
tory as well.
The Bears have won 11 NCAA titles
and have churned out 16 Olympians since
1924. By comparison, the Cardinal have
won 10 titles, produced over 25 Olympians
and have made three consecutive NCAA
appearances.
The two teams will face-off this weekend
on Senior Day, and what better way to send
off the seniors in their last regular season
home game than with a win. For Stanford's
five seniors, it's obvious they came to the
right school.
"You look at any other program, and
Stanford's had the most success over the past
four years, so I'm very happy with my deci
sion," said senior driver Greg Crum.
"There's no doubt actually in my mind
that I made the right decision," added senior
Sam Tyre. "I've loved everything about it,
from school to athletics. I had a great experi
ence and I'm looking forward to finishing
these last four weeks off on the same note."
Despite sharing similar histories, this
year's Stanford and Cal squads are two very
different teams.
The Cardinal are headed by strong, veter
an talent, including All-Americans,

Olympians and a large handful of former
NCAA champions. The Bears are buoyed by
their sophomore and freshman classes.
"I'd say the experience gives us an edge,
but seeing as how it's a Cal-Stanford rivalry,
anything can happen," Crum said. "Their
sophomores and their freshmen are very,
very talented players."
The Bears are one of the younger teams
in the nation — not one man on their squad
has more than two years of varsity experi
ence. Their top seven scorers are freshmen
or sophomores.
But while Cal is young, the team has
shown the proficiency and skill of an experi
enced team.
Most of its losses have come at the hands
of Southern California and Stanford, but the
green squad showed its ability when it upset
now-No. 1 UCLA, 10-9, earlier this season.
The Bears head into Saturday's game riding
a six-game winning streak.
It shouldn't be surprising, however, to see
California doing so well despite its lack of
upperclassmen. Cal's storied history has
proven that the program knows what it's
doing.
While it seems improbable that the Bears
will repeat their 2002 championship game
appearance this season, the future of the
team looks extremely bright.
Stanford has won two of its last three
matches against Cal, and the Golden Bears'
last win against the Cardinal came in sudden
death overtime in 2003.
Sophomore center John Mann leads Cal
with 54 goals, including 11 in four games last
weekend. He scored three goals in Cal's 12-7
loss to the Cardinal at the NorCal tourna
ment earlier this season.
Sophomore driver Andrija Vasiljevic has
also played an important part in keeping the

young squad afloat, providing 33 goals this
season. Three of the goals have come in
overtime. Stanford should also keep its eye
on sophomore defender Brian Bacharach,
second on the Cal team with 44 goals.
"For the most part I think we're looking
at them as a whole unit and capitalizing on
their mistakes," Tyre said. "They do have a
couple players that stand out a bit more, but
as long as we can control their tempo and dic
tate our kind of game, we should be fine."
Stanford will counter right-handed shoot
er Mann and left-hander Vasiljevic with its
own left-right punch in junior drivers
Thomas Hopkins and Peter Varellas. Senior
driver Tony Azevedo looks to add to his
team-leading 56 goals.
Azevedo, Crum, Tyre, Trent Wiesen and
Matt Moser will all be honored for their ded
ication Saturday.
Tyre reflected on his career on the Farm.
"For me in 2001, the first time we won the
title was the most memorable, just because
it's something that I had thought about since
starting to play water polo," Tyre said.
In addition to playing fora national
power, the seniors also commented on the
luxury of playing four years at Avery Aquat
ic Center, where the team is 6-0 this season.
"Everyone says it's the best in the coun
try, and I agree," Crum said.
"We love playing at home," added Tyre.
"We have the crowd on our side, and usually
we get a lot of support from both friends and
fans inside and outside the community.
There's nothing better than seeing a full
Avery, and nothing gets me more fired up
come game time when you look up at the
stands and they're completely full."
Saturday's game is scheduled for 11:30
a.m. Students get in free with an SUID.

Azevedo, Crum, Tyre, Trent Wiesen and
Matt Moser will all be honored for their ded
ication Saturday.
Tyre reflected on his career on the Farm.
"For me in 2001, the first time we won the
title was the most memorable, just because
it's something that I had thought about since
starting to play water polo," Tyre said.
In addition to playing fora national
power, the seniors also commented on the
luxury of playing four years at Avery Aquat
ic Center, where the team is 6-0 this season.
"Everyone says it's the best in the coun
try, and I agree," Crum said.
"We love playing at home," added Tyre.
"We have the crowd on our side, and usually
we get a lot of support from both friends and
fans inside and outside the community.
There's nothing better than seeing a full
Avery, and nothing gets me more fired up
come game time when you look up at the
stands and they're completely full."

Junior driver Peter Varellas and No. 2 Stanford host No. 4 Cal tomorrow at Avery Aquatic
Center. The Cardinal have won two of their last three games against the Bears.
As the seniors on this year's Stanford
men's water polo team (18-3, 6-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) look back on their
careers on the Farm, one game that sticks out
is the Cardinal's 7-6 victory over Cal to cap
ture the 2002 National Championship.
No. 2 Stanford need only point to that
win as proof that it's been the Bay Area's —
and perhaps the nation's — best team over
the last few years.
But No. 4 Cal (17-7,2-4) has a storied his
tory as well.
The Bears have won 11 NCAA titles
and have churned out 16 Olympians since
1924. By comparison, the Cardinal have
won 10 titles, produced over 25 Olympians
and have made three consecutive NCAA
appearances.
The two teams will face-off this weekend
on Senior Day, and what better way to send
off the seniors in their last regular season
home game than with a win. For Stanford's
five seniors, it's obvious they came to the
right school.
"You look at any other program, and
Stanford's had the most success over the past
four years, so I'm very happy with my deci
sion," said senior driver Greg Crum.
"There's no doubt actually in my mind
that I made the right decision," added senior
Sam Tyre. "I've loved everything about it,
from school to athletics. I had a great experi
ence and I'm looking forward to finishing
these last four weeks off on the same note."
Despite sharing similar histories, this
year's Stanford and Cal squads are two very
different teams.
The Cardinal are headed by strong, veter
an talent, including All-Americans,

Olympians and a large handful of former
NCAA champions. The Bears are buoyed by
their sophomore and freshman classes.
"I'd say the experience gives us an edge,
but seeing as how it's a Cal-Stanford rivalry,
anything can happen," Crum said. "Their
sophomores and their freshmen are very,
very talented players."
The Bears are one of the younger teams
in the nation — not one man on their squad
has more than two years of varsity experi
ence. Their top seven scorers are freshmen
or sophomores.
But while Cal is young, the team has
shown the proficiency and skill of an experi
enced team.
Most of its losses have come at the hands
of Southern California and Stanford, but the
green squad showed its ability when it upset
now-No. 1 UCLA, 10-9, earlier this season.
The Bears head into Saturday's game riding
a six-game winning streak.
It shouldn't be surprising, however, to see
California doing so well despite its lack of
upperclassmen. Cal's storied history has
proven that the program knows what it's
doing.
While it seems improbable that the Bears
will repeat their 2002 championship game
appearance this season, the future of the
team looks extremely bright.
Stanford has won two of its last three
matches against Cal, and the Golden Bears'
last win against the Cardinal came in sudden
death overtime in 2003.
Sophomore center John Mann leads Cal
with 54 goals, including 11 in four games last
weekend. He scored three goals in Cal's 12-7
loss to the Cardinal at the NorCal tourna
ment earlier this season.
Sophomore driver Andrija Vasiljevic has
also played an important part in keeping the

young squad afloat, providing 33 goals this
season. Three of the goals have come in
overtime. Stanford should also keep its eye
on sophomore defender Brian Bacharach,
second on the Cal team with 44 goals.
"For the most part I think we're looking
at them as a whole unit and capitalizing on
their mistakes," Tyre said. "They do have a
couple players that stand out a bit more, but
as long as we can control their tempo and dic
tate our kind of game, we should be fine."
Stanford will counter right-handed shoot
er Mann and left-hander Vasiljevic with its
own left-right punch in junior drivers
Thomas Hopkins and Peter Varellas. Senior
driver Tony Azevedo looks to add to his
team-leading 56 goals.
