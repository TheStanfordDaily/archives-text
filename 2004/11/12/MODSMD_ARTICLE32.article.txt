# Men face must-win finale at Cal
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's soccer team
(7-5-5,2-3-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
has had a flair for the dramatic all
season, and this Saturday's regular
season finale against arch-rival No.
7 California (11-3-3, 3-3-1 Pac-10)
has already ratcheted the intensity
to a new level.
The Cardinal faced the Bears ear
lier in the season at Maloney Field
and pulled off an improbable two
goal comeback in the closing min
utes of regulation to force a 2-2 tie.
The stakes for this weekend's
game are much higher though, as
conventional wisdom says that the
Cardinal need a win in order to get a
bid to the NCAA Tournament.
"I don't know if this is a must
win," said head coach Bret Simon.
"But it could be. So we'll treat it as
if everything is on the line. It's really
the way you should approach every
game. But, in this case we know it
could either be our last game to
gether or the start of a very special
NCAA Tournament run."
Getting a win in Berkeley will be
extremely difficult as the Golden
Bears have an impressive 7-1-1
record on Edwards Field.
"Cal is strong in a number of
areas," Simon said. "Their defensive
organization is excellent. Their com
posure in attack is impressive. Their
set plays are dangerous. Their core
group are upperclassmen with a
good understanding of each other's
abilities and strengths."
But the Cardinal believe they are
up to the challenge and have im
proved since their last meeting with
California.
"Playing a great, competitive
schedule has forced us to be aware
of areas we need to improve,"
Simon said. "1 think our biggest im
provements have been in [our) abil
ity to keep possession and defensive
organization. We are more confi
dent keeping the ball in difficult sit
uations, and we have been able to
switch formations and defensive or
ganization more effectively."
There are very few chinks in the
armor of their opponent that can be
easily exploited.
"They defend well up the middle
and through the midfield, so I think
we can be successful if we move the
ball quickly up and then out wide to
the flanks," senior forward Matt
Janusz said. "If we use the wide
areas we can get some one-on-one
plays with their defense, and I think

that brings our greatest chance for
success."
Even with the great skill of its at
tacking players, Cal also has had
problems finishing. This manifested
itself in the Bears' most recent
game, a scoreless tie in which Cali
fornia outshot Portland 22-7.
Stanford leads the all-time series
against the Golden Bears, 23-10-7.
This type of familiarity creates the
animosity and storied rivalry be
tween the teams.
"Our rivalry with Cal is based on
proximity, tradition and the quality
of the programs over the last five or
10 years," Simon said. "Stanford
and Cal know each other thorough
ly, so I don't expect that there will be
any surprises. The team that exe
cutes best and makes the fewest mis
takes in their own .half of the field
will probably be victorious."
This year the rivalry will only
serve to add a level of intensity to
the game because of the playoff im
plications.
Though the selection process is
unpredictable and Stanford may get
into the tournament with a loss, it is
widely thought that a win is a great
way to make a last push into the
postseason.
"Typically, we've been measur
ing sticks for each other and barriers
to progressing into or through the
NCAA Tournament," Simon said.
"This game is especially significant
in that it is the last game of the regu
lar season and has playoff implica
tions. The fact that we're playing our
rival school only adds an exclama

tion point to the game."
Also of note this week is senior
defender James Twellman's second
consecutive selection to the Aca
demic All-District team. The district
includes the states of Alaska, Ari
zona, Hawaii. California, Nevada,
Idaho, Oregon and Utah, in addi
tion to the Canadian province of
British Columbia.
The senior defender has not
played for the Cardinal since taking
himself out of a game against the
Washington Huskies due to a knee
injury suffered against Santa Clara.
The knee injury' turned out to be a
torn ACL, which was operated on
last week.
The Cardinal seniors have some
added incentive to win this game,
beyond the rivalry and even beyond
the playoff repercussions.
"As important as the rivalry is, I
think the playoff implications make
this game huge," Janusz said. "Also,
we [the seniors] have played some of
their guys for all four years. We've
traveled to the same tournaments as
them and it would be great to go out
on top."
And as the regular season comes
to a close, Stanford has one unifying
goal: Beat Cal.
"Yeah, I think we need to win
this game," Janusz said. "Given
the records of the teams in the
west, and the history of how many
teams the selection process lets in,
1 see a win as the only way we will
get in."
The match kicks off at 2 p.m. on
Saturday at Berkeley.

demic All-District team. The district
includes the states of Alaska, Ari
zona, Hawaii. California, Nevada,
Idaho, Oregon and Utah, in addi
tion to the Canadian province of
British Columbia.
The senior defender has not
played for the Cardinal since taking
himself out of a game against the
Washington Huskies due to a knee
injury suffered against Santa Clara.
The knee injury' turned out to be a
torn ACL, which was operated on
last week.
The Cardinal seniors have some
added incentive to win this game,
beyond the rivalry and even beyond
the playoff repercussions.
"As important as the rivalry is, I
think the playoff implications make
this game huge," Janusz said. "Also,
we [the seniors] have played some of
their guys for all four years. We've
traveled to the same tournaments as
them and it would be great to go out
on top."
And as the regular season comes
to a close, Stanford has one unifying
goal: Beat Cal.
"Yeah, I think we need to win
this game," Janusz said. "Given
the records of the teams in the
west, and the history of how many
teams the selection process lets in,
1 see a win as the only way we will
get in."
The match kicks off at 2 p.m. on
Saturday at Berkeley.

Junior midfielder Bronson McDonald and the men's soccer team travel
to Berkeley tomorrow looking to secure an NCAA bid.
The Stanford men's soccer team
(7-5-5,2-3-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
has had a flair for the dramatic all
season, and this Saturday's regular
season finale against arch-rival No.
7 California (11-3-3, 3-3-1 Pac-10)
has already ratcheted the intensity
to a new level.
The Cardinal faced the Bears ear
lier in the season at Maloney Field
and pulled off an improbable two
goal comeback in the closing min
utes of regulation to force a 2-2 tie.
The stakes for this weekend's
game are much higher though, as
conventional wisdom says that the
Cardinal need a win in order to get a
bid to the NCAA Tournament.
"I don't know if this is a must
win," said head coach Bret Simon.
"But it could be. So we'll treat it as
if everything is on the line. It's really
the way you should approach every
game. But, in this case we know it
could either be our last game to
gether or the start of a very special
NCAA Tournament run."
Getting a win in Berkeley will be
extremely difficult as the Golden
Bears have an impressive 7-1-1
record on Edwards Field.
"Cal is strong in a number of
areas," Simon said. "Their defensive
organization is excellent. Their com
posure in attack is impressive. Their
set plays are dangerous. Their core
group are upperclassmen with a
good understanding of each other's
abilities and strengths."
But the Cardinal believe they are
up to the challenge and have im
proved since their last meeting with
California.
"Playing a great, competitive
schedule has forced us to be aware
of areas we need to improve,"
Simon said. "1 think our biggest im
provements have been in [our) abil
ity to keep possession and defensive
organization. We are more confi
dent keeping the ball in difficult sit
uations, and we have been able to
switch formations and defensive or
ganization more effectively."
There are very few chinks in the
armor of their opponent that can be
easily exploited.
"They defend well up the middle
and through the midfield, so I think
we can be successful if we move the
ball quickly up and then out wide to
the flanks," senior forward Matt
Janusz said. "If we use the wide
areas we can get some one-on-one
plays with their defense, and I think

that brings our greatest chance for
success."
Even with the great skill of its at
tacking players, Cal also has had
problems finishing. This manifested
itself in the Bears' most recent
game, a scoreless tie in which Cali
fornia outshot Portland 22-7.
Stanford leads the all-time series
against the Golden Bears, 23-10-7.
This type of familiarity creates the
animosity and storied rivalry be
tween the teams.
"Our rivalry with Cal is based on
proximity, tradition and the quality
of the programs over the last five or
10 years," Simon said. "Stanford
and Cal know each other thorough
ly, so I don't expect that there will be
any surprises. The team that exe
cutes best and makes the fewest mis
takes in their own .half of the field
will probably be victorious."
This year the rivalry will only
serve to add a level of intensity to
the game because of the playoff im
plications.
Though the selection process is
unpredictable and Stanford may get
into the tournament with a loss, it is
widely thought that a win is a great
way to make a last push into the
postseason.
"Typically, we've been measur
ing sticks for each other and barriers
to progressing into or through the
NCAA Tournament," Simon said.
"This game is especially significant
in that it is the last game of the regu
lar season and has playoff implica
tions. The fact that we're playing our
rival school only adds an exclama

tion point to the game."
Also of note this week is senior
defender James Twellman's second
consecutive selection to the Aca
demic All-District team. The district
includes the states of Alaska, Ari
zona, Hawaii. California, Nevada,
Idaho, Oregon and Utah, in addi
