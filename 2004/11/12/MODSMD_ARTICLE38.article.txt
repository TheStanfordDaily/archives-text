## CROWN CITY ROCKERS KZSU Recommends ... 
### DOUGLAS WILSON INTERMISSION WRITER 
Crown City Rockers — "Earthtoncs"
(Basement Records)
"Earthtones" may very well be the
hip-hop album of the year. On this lat
est release, the Bay Area's own
Crown City Rockers (formerly called
Mission) reach back to soul, jazz and
funk, crafting feel-good hip-hop with
a strong B-boy vibe. And as if that

wasn't enough, the album features an
impressive list of guest MCs, includ
ing Scarub (of the Living Legends),
Gift of Gab (of Blackalicious) and
Zion I.
Positive, progressive lyrics ("Go to
the forefront, let love lead /1 take the
first step and I will succeed") make for
a listening experience both fun and
meaningful. Almost every track is
strong and the production is not only
solid but also goddamn infectious.
In particular, I'm obsessed with

"B-Boy," the album's standout cut.
Mixed by Thes One (of People Under
the Stairs), the track celebrates hip
hop culture over a dope mix of horns
and retro-styled "aaahs." "Balance"
blends Destani Wolf's vocals and
funk guitar into an impassioned jam
and "Fate" rocks an ill drumbeat over
delectably jazzy keys.
Savath & Savalas — "Manana"
(Warp Records)
Savath & Savalas, the side project
of visionary producer Scott Herren
(Prefuse 73), are back with another
excellent 2(K)4 release.
The group continues where they
left off on "Apropa't" — experimen
tal trip-hop beats, thick layers of
sound, folksy guitars and the enchant
ing vocals of Catalan singer Eva
Puyuelo Muns. And once again, the
mood is dreamlike and melancholy.
The nebulous nature of the group's
compositions makes the MP challeng
ing though the tracks are certainly not
"inaccessible." It's the kind of music
you'd imagine underlying an intense,
slightly tragic foreign film.
The centerpiece of the album is

certainly "Equipatge De Flors Se
ques," a fragmented, ambiguous col
lage of piano, strings and vocals. "Sola
1 / Aigua" demonstrates the sick heats
for which Herren is legendary and
"Dema Vinura" showcases the com
pelling synthesis of Muns' vocals and
the group's ambient electronics.
SlccpWalkcr — "The Voyage / Into
the Sun" 12" (Especial Records)
SleepWalker is a jazz quartet from
Osaka. Japan. Their latest release is

the de facto HP of last season and an

absolute must have for any jazz

aficionado.
The first side of the 12",

entitled "The Voyage," is a
blazing, 13-minute jazz
odyssey featuring tenor
sax legend Pharaoh
Sanders. In the first half,
the quartet slowly picks
up the initially leisurely
pace with an array of top

notch drum work and piano

solos. Then Sanders enters

with a long, wailing solo that is
simply hair-raising.

The second cut, "Into the Sun," is
slightly more controlled hut just as
soulful. A tight, upbeat jam gives way
to the classy, guest vocals of jazz
singer Bembe Segue.
Captain Dee is a Stanford undergrad and
the RPM director at KZSU. Tune in to
KZSUat9O.I FM for his electronica show
ex'ery Sunday night from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m.
