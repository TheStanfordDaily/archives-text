## Presidents really should lead the country They ‘Love Everybody' 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION WRITER 
As a native Washingtonian, the Seattle
based band The Presidents of the United
States of America have held a warm, fuzzy
place in my heart since their self-titled debut
was released way back in 1995 with super in
fectious hits like "Lump" and "Peaches".
After their nationally recognized first ap
pearance into the musical world, they retreat
ed to the local scene and even disbanded fora
short while in the late '90s. The release of
"Love Everybody" marks the band's fifth
(that's right, fifth) album to hit stores.
When I first heard that the Presidents were
reunited to create new music, I nearly shat the
proverbial brick. My childhood wouldn't have
been the same without these guys — I desper
ately needed this album.

I hurried to the local record store and got
my grubby little paws on their latest endeavor,
on my way to see them play their first live con
cert in Seattle in many, many years. I pumped
up the volume and awaited musical glory.
While "Love Everybody" marks the Presi
dents' return to their garage-band roots, it is
far from the best album they are capable of.
They retain their trademark lighthearted.
often silly lyrics ("Patch my boat with chewing
gum / this purple haze is easy on the mind"),
but the songs — with a few exceptions — are
far edgier than the ones from their earlier and
more mature album, "Freaked Out and
Small."
"Love Everybody" ranges from the punk
rock sensibilities of "Poke and Destroy"
(which aptly embodies the male psyche in only
three words) to the extremely radio-friendly
hooks of "Some Postman" to the trademark
sounds of classic Presidents.
There are even traces, albeit brief ones, of
that memorable and defining movement in
Seattle music history called grunge. It's a
shame that only a few tracks like "Some Post
man" manage to capture the sheer wacky bril
liance of their previous albums. My hopes for
songs more along the lines of "Video Killed
the Radio Star" were deflated when the
tracks veered more towards the less memo
rable strains of the President's second album,
which many argue loses much of the boys'
charm.
Despite the album's few shortcomings, it
spits out a few songs that, given loud enough
speakers, could potentially rock your frickin'
socks off. The title track not only teaches young
ones to "Love Everybody," it causes even the
most hardcore death-metal rocker to bang his

jaded head in de
light. It's a shame
that the rest of the
CD feels like a let
down.
Unless you're lucky
enough to have lived
in Seattle during the
heyday of the Presi
dents, you probably
forgot about these
guys somewhere be
tween third grade
cursive lessons and
middle school
dances. But if want to
recapture part of
your youth and sur
round yourself in
some rock nostalgia,
take a chance on
"Love Everybody".
