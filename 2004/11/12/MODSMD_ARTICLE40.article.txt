# Ted Leo shakes the sheets from here to Rio
## Go fill your 'culture' prescription 
### BONNIE JOHNSON INTERMISSION PHARMACIST 
1 first started following Ted Leo and his
crew when I moved to Washington, D.C., a
few years ago. That's when my friends and I

started behaving like a
freakish cult and
apotheosized the D.C.-
based band in a way
highly uncharacteristic
of a bunch of music
snob college kids.
We started to pre
sent the infallible Mr.
Leo with our own spe
cial creations every
time we saw him play:
Balloon lions for Leo,
origami cranes for
"The Crane Takes
Flight." He's learned
and forgotten our

names countless times in places all over the
country. His shows have become reunions and
landmarks for us, and his activities a recurring
topic of group e-mails and conversations at
holidays.
You've seen us in the audience at shows.
We are the people who dance like nutbars,
sing every lyric and engage in a mutual heck
le session with the band for the duration of its
set. We are rude to anyone we suspect of
joining the bandwagon after a recent increase
in publicity. When it comes to Ted Leo, we
are unrepentant jerks. And Ted? He's just
untouchable.
This by way of admitting that I may be too
biased to provide a straight assessment of his
new LP, "Shake the Sheets." Luckily, this
record is so damn good (saner sources concur)

that I don't need to fall back on obsession and
/ or nostalgia to give it an exultant review.
The opening single "Me and Mia" is sure to
be a favorite, but the album is so consistently
solid that it's hard to pick out highlights. Since
his Chisel days, Leo's biggest strength has
been his songwriting, and on this record it's
grown tight enough to trump just about any
one in the underground or the mainstream.
He also serves perfectly in the capacity of pub
lic poet, and the dissident declarations into
which he has increasingly channeled his pas
sion provide the ideal venue for his skills as a
lyricist.
The Pharmacists have lost their keyboards
and their second guitar but maintain a tight
trio that gets the job done more effectively
than ever, with vocals toned down slightly
from their "Hearts of Oak" levels (which, let's
face it, were just a little over the top).
The most striking thing about this record is
the constant energy — Leo's enthusiasm is
his trademark, but "Shake the Sheets" is re
markable for putting together 12 consecutive
upbeat songs without creating any sense of

monotony or
repetition.
Though I've
seen Ted Leo
play numerous
times, I can say
with certainty
that his show
at The Great
American Music
Hall on Satur
day was the
tightest, angri
est, most direct
ed performance
I've ever seen
from him. It was
a shitty week for

a lot of us, and knowing Leo's politics and his ef
forts to get out the vote, I figured he'd be pretty
pissed — but I didn't know if the aftershock of
the apocalyptic electoral crisis redux would take
on the form of dejection or rage (I've been see
ing a lot of both).
Thankfully, it turned out to be the latter.
He hit us with a rapid-fire set of four-minute
manifestos, making brief pauses to commiser
ate, exhort the crowd and expound on the
themes in his songs. It may well have been the
best I've seen him play.
My friends and I are perpetually convinced
that Ted Leo's about to appear on the cover of
"Rolling Stone." Why isn't he already as fa
mous as Ray Davies, Elvis Costello and Billy
Bragg combined? He's just too good.



If it were the 19705, tfie/d be forming Microsoft.
