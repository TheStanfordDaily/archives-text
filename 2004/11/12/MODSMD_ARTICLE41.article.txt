# Intermission Takes You into Johnny Depp's ‘Neverland’
## Can't see the Forster? 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
After hitting the big time with "Monster's
Ball" (the film that scored Halle Berry an
Oscar), Swiss director Marc Forster takes a
crack at "Finding Neverland."
Intermission sat down with Forster to see
what he had to say about his latest project.
INTERMISSION: How did you get involved
with "Finding Neverland" — a fight-hearted
drama — after directing a dark and tragic
movie like "Monster's Ball"?
MARC FORSTER: I think there are certain
parallels between "Monster's Ball" and
'Neverland." I also did a film before "Mon
ster's Ball" called "Everything put Together,"
so all three films deal with mortality. Also,
the characters themselves are, to a certain
degree, dealing with solitude or are lonely.
So for me personally, there is sort of a
thread through all these projects. But I think
this film might be a little more accessible to
people.
INT: Is that why you chose it?
M. F.: I wanted to do something different. I find
the transformation of the imagination, the cre
ative process very interesting. I'm a very big
believer that whatever we dream of as human
beings or whatever we want to do we can
manifest in our lives. And I think our imagina
tion is one of the most important key elements
to do that.
INT: What was a typical day like on the set?
M. F.: In the morning, I block the scenes with
the actors, then they go and change into hair
and make up, and at the same time I'm dis
cussing with the BP how we're going to shoot
the scene. When you're in a studio situation,
it's all pretty regulated because there's nothing
that can really ao wrong. You know, you set
up, you shoot tne scene, and you're done. If
you're outside especially in England, it's like
a nightmare because tne weather changes
constantly. And in London, the flight pattern of

the airplanes can change. It depends on how
the wind is. So suddenly, every 30 seconds,
you have a plane coming in. We had good
days, and we had bad days.
INT: How did Kate Winslet qet attached to the
film?
M. F.: Kate basically heard about it and I got a
phone call that she wants to meet me, and we
nad lunch and I just fell in love with her. She
was so what I was looking for. She had a child
herself, which was important, because she's
only 28 . . . but even though she's so young,
she comes across that she could have a 10-
year-old child.
INT: There's a large emphasis on theater in this
film, and you seem to really have an apprecia
tion for it. Do you have a theater background?
M. F.: I hate theater. (Laughs). No, I'm kidding.
I do like theater, when it's interesting theater
and fits into my attention span. I love the Eng
lish theater actors, and I'm passionate about
theater. Not that I'm interested to direct the
ater, but I just appreciate it.
INT: Were you ever concerned about how the
current events, particularly the Michael Jack
son trial, might influence tne film?
M. F.: Are you kidding? That's like the main
topic of conversation 90 percent of the time.
Basically, before I made the movie, I re
searched Barrie a lot. I made sure he was not
a pedophile. He was very much asexual. Ob
viously the whole Michael Jackson trial situa
tion gives "Neverland" more of this darker
image.
INT: Do you have a dream project?
M. F.: You know, my dreams always change
and I as a person always change. I try to very
much live in the now and I can't plan five years
from now where my career will be. We're liv
ing in such bizarre times, and there's so much
pain in the world at the moment and so much
change going on that it always affects me. It
just changes from moment to moment.
