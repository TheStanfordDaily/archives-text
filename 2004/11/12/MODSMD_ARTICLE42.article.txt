# Fly away to Neverland
## Although some prefer death to never-ending youth with 'le Pan' 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
If you lived in London in 1903 and fre
quented the theater, there's a good

ehance that you might run across a
play written by a Mr. James Bar
rie (Johnny Depp). And if you
were unfortunate enough to wit
ness one of these mediocre plays,
you might think that Mr. Barrie

would be better off changing
professions.

The beginning of "Find
ing Neverland" gives a
glimpse of the uninspired
playwright, James, strug
gling with a failing career

and disintegrating marriage to a
cold and waifish wife, Mary
(Radha Mitchell).
r\~ i

On the verge of personal
and professional collapse,
James is forced (by the un
derutilized Dustin Hoffman)
to seek out new inspiration.
So, he takes a walk in the

park.
There he meets Sylvia
Rhys-Davies (Kate Winslet)
J U C I I

and her four hoys. James
and the boys become fast

friends, as he indulges
them in constant play

time, much to the
distress of
James's ice

queen wife and
Sylvia's overbearing mother (Julie
Christie).
What then comes to pass is a scries of
unspectacular events that eventually lead
to James's professional success, as he uses
the boys as inspiration fora new play,
"Peter Pan."
"Finding Neverland" struggles be
cause the audience goes into the film
knowing what to expect. We know that

James will become friends with the boys.
We know that he will write "Peter Pan."
And we know it will be a success. We've
heard the story before.

While the film does attempt to show
the audience where James's ideas
may have come from, through inte-
I grating dream-like sequences with
P plot elements, the effect is almost

too subtle to generate a big impact.
Depp does a stellar job

of creating a whimsical
character, but James

himself never seems to
undergo any real
transformation.

Moreover, there seems
to be a lack of any real

chemistry between Depp

and Winslet, which detracts
from the relationship the two

. are supposed to form within
i the film.

While "Finding Nev
erland" does not take any

serious missteps, it doesn't
take any risks or offer any

surprises to its audience.
To tread the often-fre

quented territory of
"Peter Pan" once

again, the audience
needs to be offered

more humor, more
adventure and.

yes, more
