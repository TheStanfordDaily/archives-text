Peter Pan formed a major part of all every Stanford student's
childhood. We all saw the cartoon (and then the various Disney
sequels, as is the case with any successful story); we sat in the ride
at Disneyland; and about 10 percent of the student population
probably wore a crappy green-felt Peter Pan costume tor Hal
loween at some time.
And at this stage of our life, the lessons of Peter Pan are all the
more important. Although we were too young to appreciate these
messages before, these Disney teachings can impact the rest of
our lives. Just use Michael Jackson as an example. He named his
property Neverland; he wishes he were the eternal boy; and he's
still trying to get into Wendy's pants.
The story ctf Peter Pan has touched his life as much as it should
touch yours if you heed these lessons:
1 Life sucks when you get older.
2 The boy with the glasses is always the dork in the family.
3 Pirates are evil. Tney deserve to be killed.
4 Indians are savaqes, but this makes them funny.

5 Fish can't have sex with little boys.
6 Certain organic substances (ie "fairy dust") can help you fly.
7 Smee sucks. He just does. Nobody will hire you if you have
that name.
If you follow these teachings then you can also live like every
one's favorite eternally youthful boy with an Oedipal complex. So
the next time you aren't happy with your parents, just leave them
by jumping out the nearest window. And then you will never grow
up.


BEFORE:Awwww, so cute.


AFTER: Ewwww, so gross.
