## King keeps this ballet in 'LINES' 
### EMILY HITE INTERMISSION DANCE CRITIC 
Alonso King's LINES Ballet
opened its 2004-05 season last week
end at the Yerba Buena Center for
the Arts in San Francisco with the
world premiere of "Before the Blues"
followed by "Who Dressed You Like
a Foreigner?"
"Before the Blues" is a collabora
tion of choreography by King, music
by celebrated jazz composer and sax
ophonist Pharoah Sanders and poetry
read by actor Danny Glover. The
music includes archival field record
ings from the Library of Congress that
date back to decades following the
Civil War. The old and scratchy music
recording combined with the poetry
from the same period and some crude
video footage of barren landscape ef
fectively paints the exhaustion and
desolation of people in post-war
America. A few minutes pass before
dancers enter the dark stage that is
filled only partway with a video screen
and distant-sounding music, creating
an empty, lonely space.
To Glover reading "... They shall
run, and not be weary; they shall walk,
and not faint," dancers drag their feet
slowly with heavy hearts. A scene por
trays the capture and torture of several
people and a silencing of others by ges
tures censuring the mouth, ears or eyes.
Ghosts seem to pull dancers off
stage with a force that is invisible but
potent like the remnants of slavery. In
one break from the continuous move
ment, all the dancers shuffle in lines,
their wrists held below their waists as
though they are roped together.

A poignant moment displays a
man staggering diagonally upstage,
burdened hy a stuffed sack on his back
and weary from travel. A woman re
lieves him of his burden and leads him
to safety offstage. No sooner is the
pair gone from sight than people run
onstage from all directions to loot the
man's belongings.

To repetitions of the words "yes," "I
love you" and"I forgive you," the
dancers regained authority over the
stage space with continuous, un-har
nessed movement that emanated
their strength and freedom of spirit.
King describes a ballet as "a
thought made visible. What you are
watching onstage is really watching

someone's consciousness. You're wit
nessing what they think things are."
In the second half of the evening,
viewing "Who Dressed You Like a
Foreigner?" is like experiencing
someone else's unconscious. Just like
a dream that has no clear beginning,
the periphery of the stage is darkened
so that it had no edges. Dancers could

appear and disperse seamlessly into
the soft, misty atmosphere of yellow
light diffused from narrow rays over
head.
The dancers have body-oriented
focus, drawing the audience into their
space rather than projecting them
selves outward. Watching something
so personal, honest and natural as
dancers with spontaneous, not self
conscious style is like witnessing some
one else's dream â€” a bit invasive.
The final section of the ballet is an
emotionally evocative pas de deux be
tween Laurel Keen and Brett Con
way that portray the most tender and
trusting of all relationships, that of a
mother and child. Keen holds Con
way as he tries to sit up and supports
him from behind as she encourages
his feeble attempts to walk. Conway
ventures only a few steps away from
Keen before returning and falling
back into her arms.
She strokes his face and head and
rocks him with arms softly enveloped
about him. Keen's smiling eyes gives
her face a serene, maternally comfort
ing and knowing glow. She is unques
tionably present behind Conway at all
times and he finally returns from his
anxious separation, alone in the cold
uncertainty of the outer world, back
into her arms a final time.
