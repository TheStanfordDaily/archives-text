# ‘Seed of Chucky’: The one “must see” movie of the season
## 
### TOM HANADA INTERMISSION CO-EDITOR 
The dull possessed by the spirit of a dead, psy
chotic serial killer is back in "Seed of Chucky."
This time, him and his wife are joined by their gen
der-confused, pacifist child Glenn / Glendu. Their
plan to become a normal family is simple. They
will inhabit the bodies of movie actress Jennifer
Tilly, her boyfriend and her child. Of course, Jen
nifer Tilly has no child, so they drug her and arti
ficially inseminate her with Chucky's semen by
use of a turkey baster.
Let's be honest, there's no possible way to
make the review for this movie scathing enough.
Therefore, the following paragraphs will be the
exact opposite of what any audience member will
think while watching this movie.
"Seed of Chucky" is quite possibly the greatest
film ever. It manages to flawlessly combine ele

merits from the genres of horror, comedy and ro
mance all while staying true to its characters and
pint This film takes what was started in the first
three "Chucky" movies and expands it into a true
piece of art.
In the horror genre, "Seed of Chucky" finds
creative, new ways to thrill the audience. This
movie doesn't rely on quick turns and strange
lighting to catch the viewer by surprise. The gore
is done tastefully and never crosses the border
from gratuitous to obnoxious. In fact, these scenes
might be some of the most aesthetically pleasing
moments in cinematic history.
I feel that the wonderful suspense within the
movie was created by the fully developed charac
ters that the audience naturally grows attached to.
A lesser movie might throw in random people
with the sole purpose of having them killed in a
gruesome manner, but "Seed of Chucky" makes
sure that every single individual on screen aides in

the forward momentum of the plot.
These remarkably strong characters also make
the movie's lightheaded moments all the more in
ventive. The comedic structure will undoubtedly
propel this movie to the historic stature that it so
completely deserves. The dialogue is always witty

I 'Seed of Chuclcy'
Dir. Don Mancinj

without use of stupidly cliche and obvious
lines that have become the hallmark of the
slasher genre. While watching, I found myself
constantly laughing at the exchanges between
characters instead of laughing at my own in
eptitude for wasting 90 minutes of my life in
this theater.
But the one element that elevates this be
yond a normal movie is the sensitivity of the
story. The subtle comparison of Glenn / Glen
da to Jesus was in perfect taste and beautifully
intertwined within the plot. Even Chucky —
who usually maintains personal and emotional
barriers — has some passionately tender mo
ments. I le shows the audience his weak side as
he struggles against his addiction to killing.

This film should serve as lessons to anyone
with problems. Chucky even displays a sexual
side during the far too short scenes of him mas
turbating. All of these examples enhanced an
already powerful viewing experience.
Few works of art can make a person view
life differently. "Seed of Chucky" not only
made me a better person, but it never made
me want to shit my pants as an excuse to es
cape from the theater. 1 will commit every
moment spent in the theater viewing this
masterpiece to my memory and hope that I
carry this experience with me for the rest of
my life.
This is the greatest film ever, and this re
view is certainly not filler.
