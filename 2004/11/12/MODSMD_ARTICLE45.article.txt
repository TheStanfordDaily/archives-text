# ‘Seed of Chucky’: The one “must see” movie of the season
## 
### TOM HANADA INTERMISSION CO-EDITOR 
The dull possessed by the spirit of a dead, psy
chotic serial killer is back in "Seed of Chucky."
This time, him and his wife are joined by their gen
der-confused, pacifist child Glenn / Glendu. Their
plan to become a normal family is simple. They
will inhabit the bodies of movie actress Jennifer
Tilly, her boyfriend and her child. Of course, Jen
nifer Tilly has no child, so they drug her and arti
ficially inseminate her with Chucky's semen by
use of a turkey baster.
Let's be honest, there's no possible way to
make the review for this movie scathing enough.
Therefore, the following paragraphs will be the
exact opposite of what any audience member will
think while watching this movie.
"Seed of Chucky" is quite possibly the greatest
film ever. It manages to flawlessly combine ele

merits from the genres of horror, comedy and ro
mance all while staying true to its characters and
pint This film takes what was started in the first
three "Chucky" movies and expands it into a true
piece of art.
In the horror genre, "Seed of Chucky" finds
creative, new ways to thrill the audience. This
movie doesn't rely on quick turns and strange
lighting to catch the viewer by surprise. The gore
is done tastefully and never crosses the border
from gratuitous to obnoxious. In fact, these scenes
might be some of the most aesthetically pleasing
moments in cinematic history.
I feel that the wonderful suspense within the
movie was created by the fully developed charac
ters that the audience naturally grows attached to.
A lesser movie might throw in random people
with the sole purpose of having them killed in a
gruesome manner, but "Seed of Chucky" makes
sure that every single individual on screen aides in

the forward momentum of the plot.
These remarkably strong characters also make
the movie's lightheaded moments all the more in
ventive. The comedic structure will undoubtedly
propel this movie to the historic stature that it so
completely deserves. The dialogue is always witty
