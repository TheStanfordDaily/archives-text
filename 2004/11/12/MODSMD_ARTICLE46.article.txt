## What do you do during an all nighter? 
### DARREN FRANICH INTERMISSION FEATURES WRITER 
Kairos seems, at first, like a normal
Upper Row house. The front door is
propped open by a slightly disheveled
doormat. A pile of Stanford Reviews lays
unread by the entrance. The cluster's
token Mac doesn't work. Kairos is nonde
script. Except, of course, for the Matthias
K. Rath Museum of Destruction and Res
urrection located in Room 301.
I am greeted at the door by the mu
seum's creators, curators and tenants
— Nick Casey, Karan Mahajan, and
Ross Perlin (all Class of 2005). The trio
was motivated to create the museum

by what they perceive as the
"downfall of wonder" in the
modern world, a result of a
cultural specialization of
knowledge which creates
specific compartments of
wisdom. The museum has
no defining aspect, instead
serving as "a snapshot of a
moment."
Next to the door is a
mini-shrine to the muse
um's namesake, patron and
symbol: Matthias Rath.
"A spiritual leader of
modern times," according
to Ferlin, "a scientist and
an artist." (A casual
Google search informs me
that Rath is a pioneer in
the field of natural health
therapy, and a longtime

thorn in the side of the pharmaceuti
cal industry.)
The essence of the museum is its
titular concern with Destruction and

Resurrection, a move from
discord through to unity.
The tour begins with the
astonishing reproduction of
the "Salvatierra Walk" sign,
which sits across from the
Rath shrine. Casey tells me
of the great pains they took
to mimic the original sign,
down to the spot-on letter
ing and coloration. Indeed, I
note, my sharp journalistic
eye at the ready, "it looks
EXACTLY like the sign."
In fact, this section
is a sort of pre-memorial for
the Salvatierra region of
campus, soon to be demol
ished for grad student hous
ing. In an aesthetic choice
out of "A Beautiful Mind,"
the wall links Daily articles
about the construction with
various articles from The
New York Times and other

publications. This merges into a mas
sive collage of people affected by the
destruction of Salvatierra. Among the
afflicted: Buddy Teevins, Lee Majors,
Shakespeare and me (the collage is
cleverly built around a mirror). Deep.
Just above the main entrance is "A
Rug on the Ceiling."
"From the Caucuses collection,"
Mahajan tells me.
In the Caucuses, there is an old
saying that every now and then, one
must "walk on the ceiling." Shaman
istic. Perlin admits that they lack the
spiritual energy to keep the ceiling rug
in place.
"We used tacks."

Also filling the elevated ceiling space
are three hanging umbrellas. They are
all half open, frozen at the point Maha
jan calls, "instant evolution."
Below the rug is a copy of "The

Complete Works of Shakespeare."
The curators tell me about an old par
lor game - no doubt a favorite of the
intelligentsia — wherein one flips
through the "Complete Works" and
brings their finger down on a random
quote on a random page. That quote
holds your destiny, or your fortune. I
landed on a quote from "Henry V,"
which advised, "Be as provident as
fear will teach you."
Parts of the museum are quite per
sonalized. An example is the "Microne
sian Navigation Wall" — one of
Casey's anthropological additions to
the museum. Three-thousand years
ago, the Micronesians navigated the Pa
cific a baffling form of pre-modern nav
igation. Casey found some of these old
school voyagers, observed them and
even sailed with them, as evidenced by
the photos that adorn the wall.
With the personal comes the politi
cal. The "Dukakis Quilt" hangs on the

wall near the mid
dle of the room.
After losing the
1988 election to
George H. W.,
Michael Dukakis
moved to Tibet
and ran for local
office. The quilt,
to which the cura
tors have added a
small "Dukakis
'88" pin, figured
prominently in
his Tibetan cam
paign, which, un
believably, was
quite unsuccess
ful. Why the
quilt?
''Dukakis," they
tell me, "is part of

the destruction."
And. therefore, part of the resurrec
tion? "Dukakis '08," Casey answers.
I'm dizzy fora second.

Next to
the quilt is "A
Shopping
Cart" filled
with forgotten
technology.
There's a hu
midifier, a pen
cil sharpener,
an old laptop,
an old-school
Nintendo and a
hot-w at e r
heater from the
Kairos kitchen
(that was re
placed by a mi
crowave). It's

actually quite a
moving little trash
pile, sort of like an
unpretentious A.I.
On the far side
of the room is the li
brary, organized ac
cording to the colon
system. The litera
ture is divided into
six subsets: Energy,
Personality, Mat
ter, Space, Time,
and Space-Time
(the last for books
like "Ulysses" that
defy any rational
organization).
There are also
three books on
special display in
front of the book
case: "Parasites
Like Us," "Guro
of Love" and
"The Amazing
Adventures of
Kavalier and
Clay." All signed
by the author.
The latter is in
scribed "To Sal
vador Dali."
"We re not sure

if Dali was actually on hand for the ded
ication." Perlin says.
Next on the tour is "The Dictator
Wall," covered in maps of besieged
nations and the awful tyrants they
openly love and secretly hate. There's
Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Green
land, Egypt. Central Tokyo, Stanford
("Needs no explanation," explains
Mahajan), and California. Yes, next
to a picture of Leonid Brezhnev shak
ing hands with Commie pen pal Fidel
Castro hangs the Golden State. Casey
calls Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger a
political opportunist.
On the wall near the window hangs

an assortment of paper currency. This
is the museum's self-referential ode to
funding. There are dollar bills, English
pounds, yen and, most importantly,
pesos — the museum's preferred cur
rency for donations.
"The peso is the way to raise
funds," Casey says. Across the room is
the donor wall, whose noble patrons
include a five-year-old, a six-year-old
and Prof. James Fiskin.
The museum, which could have been a
perversely odd piece of performance art
tomf(x>lery, is endlessly filled with intriguing
connections. Most interesting is the com
plex relatioaship between the curatorial trio
and their creation.
Perlin, discussing the odd doubling

of working and living in a museum, says
offhandedly, "We are tools of the muse
um/' A statement which sounds much
less cultish than it reads.
Mahajan has considered it even
further when he says, "As the line be
tween kinetic life and the frozen mu
seum existence becomes blurred, we,
ourselves, become exhibits."
Regardless, the curators definitely
have something special. Their muse
um, with exhibits that change and shift
quite often, is quite extraordinary.
"We want to contribute to the re
animation of wonder," Perlin con
cludes. Well done.

Perlin is finally sober enough to enjoy his creation.
