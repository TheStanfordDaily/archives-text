# ROXY SASS OFFERED TOUR-GUIDE POSITION ON CAMPUS
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
"Never let schooling get in the way of your education"
— Mark Twain
Who says there aren't lessons to be learned outside of lecture?
Roxy has never been one to separate work from play, so here's
a tour around campus you can be sure Stanford Visitor Infor
mation Services will never, ever offer.
DEEP IN THE STACKS: Everyone always talks about hooking
up in the infamous Stacks of Green Library, but how many people
have fully utilized the potential of that hookup haven? The endless
rows of dingy and dilapidated bookshelves harboring dusty tomes
lend themselves to privacy from peeping pervs, but the smartest
scholars will come to realize that the shelves themselves are useful.
Your abs will thank you as you thrust against the shelf, while fac
ing the 2nd edition of "The Eastern I teartland Agricultural and
Bovine Reader." Bracing yourself against the structure for sup
port, you can increase the difficulty of this workout by facing your
partner and wrapping your legs around him / her as he / she sup
ports your weight. Books aren't so useless after all.

RODIN WOULD APPROVE: Find an Art History major who can give you an explicit lesson on the sensual pieces in the Rodin Sculp
ture Garden, right by Cantor Arts Center. You may see the occasional runner cooling down with lunges on the steps of the museum; keep
this in mind especially for quickie sessions when both partners are upright (as if musing deeply about the meaning of "The Gates of Hell")
the freedom of movement allows for artistic interpretation, especially when you have the shorter partner standing one step above the
other so that certain parts line up. The sandy sculpture garden is like a beach in your own backyard, sans ocean. Just be careful to keep
clear of more sensitive areas, which don't appreciate friction of that sort.
HISTORY UNDONE: The History Corner (Lane Hall, Building 200 in the Main Quad) is open all night long, like the Meyer 24-hour

study room — only it's not full of bleary-eyed overachievers and local
bums looking fora warm corner to curl up in. Long, sturdy wooden ta
bles and cushy carpets are crying out to be used for more than the apa
thetic discussions that take place during mostly-silent l-Hum sections.
Pull up one of those spacious wooden chairs and give your partner a lap
dance of the best kind. A position also known as "Watching the Game,"
one partner sits while the other straddles, facing each other. While
you're at it, use the projection screens in the rooms for kinky impromp
tu film fests that don't involve dead historical figures or dull dates. The
only thing you'll be remembering is your partner's name as you scream
it over and over again.

SHAK-INGUP:C ontrary to popular belief and the hopes of the University administration, the Band Shak (located on Serra next
to the Ford Center) is not condemned property — yet. Where else can you tear each other's clothes off in a flurry and not worry
about making a mess? The crazy mix of unbelievably hilarious stolen signs ("Dr. Dick Beaver, Chiropractor" for example) and
crazy Band paraphernalia, which may range from flesh-colored dildos and powder-blue velour leisure suits to overturned shop
ping carts and cases of Spam, make for an extremely fun fuck. Only it's a lot less scarier than Pee Wee's Playhouse. Consider it an
obstacle course that only the most sexually daring can conquer. Just be careful not to fall onto a wayward trumpet or broken
drumsticks, 'cause Vaden won't know how to treat those injuries. Never mind the Shak rats scurrying about the premises —
they're harmless. Three words for you: Bone, bone. bone.
IMPROVISATION 101: Don't underestimate those serious-looking music majors lugging their violas and composition books
all over campus. They may look uptight in their black turtlenecks and argue excitedly over the placement of an arpeggio, but it
doesn't mean that these kids don't know how to loosen up. It's obvious that they know how to apply their fingering skills and
amazing breath control to more than just instruments. Empty wine bottles and suspiciously wadded up paper towel balls that

litter the trashcans of Braun's
practice rooms are telltale
clues that would prompt Sher
lock Holmes to exclaim. "Ele
mentary. my dear Watson,
these kids are playing each oth
ers fiddles!" Put your own spin
on the position of the same
name (also known as "Playing

the Cello"), which involves one person on his / her back, ankles on one of his I her partner's
shoulders, while the partner penetrates from behind. Where else on campus will you find
soundproof rooms?
PUT THE)' IN THE OVAL: Always picturesque in the daytime, this pristine spot is prime
for picnics and volleyball games. After all the families have gone home, you can appropriate
the area for your own playtime. Its gently sloping sides allow some unusual angles for you to
attempt, as you pretend to be playing a moonlit game of frisbee golf. It certainly looks like
you're cuddling there in the lush grass, but you're not fooling Roxy. There's certainly more
leverage than your standard issue extra-long mattress, so amp up the often overlooked mis
sionary position. Firing your legs up and bend those knees to allow your partner deeper pene
tration. It's the position that supposedly produces the quickest male orgasm, but you over
achiever types should aim to discredit that claim. With Memorial Church in sight, you can pray
to any and all higher powers that be for the long-lasting tantric sex that will set you way above
the Stanford Sex Curve.

the area for your own playtime. Its gently sloping sides allow some unusual angles for you to
attempt, as you pretend to be playing a moonlit game of frisbee golf. It certainly looks like
you're cuddling there in the lush grass, but you're not fooling Roxy. There's certainly more
leverage than your standard issue extra-long mattress, so amp up the often overlooked mis
sionary position. Firing your legs up and bend those knees to allow your partner deeper pene
tration. It's the position that supposedly produces the quickest male orgasm, but you over
achiever types should aim to discredit that claim. With Memorial Church in sight, you can pray
to any and all higher powers that be for the long-lasting tantric sex that will set you way above
the Stanford Sex Curve.

"Never let schooling get in the way of your education"
— Mark Twain
Who says there aren't lessons to be learned outside of lecture?
Roxy has never been one to separate work from play, so here's
a tour around campus you can be sure Stanford Visitor Infor
mation Services will never, ever offer.
DEEP IN THE STACKS: Everyone always talks about hooking
up in the infamous Stacks of Green Library, but how many people
have fully utilized the potential of that hookup haven? The endless
rows of dingy and dilapidated bookshelves harboring dusty tomes
lend themselves to privacy from peeping pervs, but the smartest
scholars will come to realize that the shelves themselves are useful.
Your abs will thank you as you thrust against the shelf, while fac
ing the 2nd edition of "The Eastern I teartland Agricultural and
Bovine Reader." Bracing yourself against the structure for sup
port, you can increase the difficulty of this workout by facing your
partner and wrapping your legs around him / her as he / she sup
ports your weight. Books aren't so useless after all.

RODIN WOULD APPROVE: Find an Art History major who can give you an explicit lesson on the sensual pieces in the Rodin Sculp
ture Garden, right by Cantor Arts Center. You may see the occasional runner cooling down with lunges on the steps of the museum; keep
this in mind especially for quickie sessions when both partners are upright (as if musing deeply about the meaning of "The Gates of Hell")
the freedom of movement allows for artistic interpretation, especially when you have the shorter partner standing one step above the
other so that certain parts line up. The sandy sculpture garden is like a beach in your own backyard, sans ocean. Just be careful to keep
clear of more sensitive areas, which don't appreciate friction of that sort.
HISTORY UNDONE: The History Corner (Lane Hall, Building 200 in the Main Quad) is open all night long, like the Meyer 24-hour

study room — only it's not full of bleary-eyed overachievers and local
bums looking fora warm corner to curl up in. Long, sturdy wooden ta
bles and cushy carpets are crying out to be used for more than the apa
thetic discussions that take place during mostly-silent l-Hum sections.
Pull up one of those spacious wooden chairs and give your partner a lap
dance of the best kind. A position also known as "Watching the Game,"
one partner sits while the other straddles, facing each other. While
you're at it, use the projection screens in the rooms for kinky impromp
tu film fests that don't involve dead historical figures or dull dates. The
only thing you'll be remembering is your partner's name as you scream
it over and over again.

SHAK-INGUP:C ontrary to popular belief and the hopes of the University administration, the Band Shak (located on Serra next
to the Ford Center) is not condemned property — yet. Where else can you tear each other's clothes off in a flurry and not worry
about making a mess? The crazy mix of unbelievably hilarious stolen signs ("Dr. Dick Beaver, Chiropractor" for example) and
crazy Band paraphernalia, which may range from flesh-colored dildos and powder-blue velour leisure suits to overturned shop
ping carts and cases of Spam, make for an extremely fun fuck. Only it's a lot less scarier than Pee Wee's Playhouse. Consider it an
obstacle course that only the most sexually daring can conquer. Just be careful not to fall onto a wayward trumpet or broken
drumsticks, 'cause Vaden won't know how to treat those injuries. Never mind the Shak rats scurrying about the premises —
they're harmless. Three words for you: Bone, bone. bone.
IMPROVISATION 101: Don't underestimate those serious-looking music majors lugging their violas and composition books
all over campus. They may look uptight in their black turtlenecks and argue excitedly over the placement of an arpeggio, but it
doesn't mean that these kids don't know how to loosen up. It's obvious that they know how to apply their fingering skills and
amazing breath control to more than just instruments. Empty wine bottles and suspiciously wadded up paper towel balls that

litter the trashcans of Braun's
practice rooms are telltale
clues that would prompt Sher
lock Holmes to exclaim. "Ele
mentary. my dear Watson,
these kids are playing each oth
ers fiddles!" Put your own spin
on the position of the same
name (also known as "Playing

the Cello"), which involves one person on his / her back, ankles on one of his I her partner's
shoulders, while the partner penetrates from behind. Where else on campus will you find
soundproof rooms?
