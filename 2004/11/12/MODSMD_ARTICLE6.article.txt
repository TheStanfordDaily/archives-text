# COUNTDOWN TO KICKOFF
## Saturday, November 13, 2004 Stanford Stadium 2:00 p.m. 
### 
Stanford (4-5,2-4 Pacific-10 Conference) will not lack for sources of motivation when it hosts Oregon State (4-5,3-3) to
morrow at Stanford Stadium. The game marks the final home appearance for 11 seniors, comes on the heels of a heart
breaking loss to Arizona State and is against the team that dealt the Cardinal an embarrassing 43-3 loss one year ago. The
game also has serious bowl implications for both teams. A win keeps the Cardinal in the hunt; a loss ensures another los
ing season. Here are three key matchups to watch:

1

OSU QB Derek Anderson vs. Stanford Secondary

For the second consecutive week, senior Stanley Wilson
and the Cardinal secondary must contend with one of the
most prolific passers in Pac-10 history. Anderson, a senior,
is one of five quarterbacks in conference history to throw
for over 10,000 yards (10,026) and is the Beavers' all-time
leader in that department. His 68 career touchdown pass
es, including 18 this year, are also a school record. After
throwing nine in interceptions in his first five games, he's
thrown just three picks in the Beavers' last four.

2

OSU Secondary vs. Stanford WR Mark Bradford

Speaking of picks, the Beavers' secondary, anchored by senior cor
nerback Aric Williams, is an interception machine. Williams is the
Pac-10 leader for passes defensed with 13. including four picks, while
secondary mates Sabby Piscitelli, a sophomore, and senior Mitch
Meeuwsen have the game to match their names. Piscitelli has four in
terceptions, while Meeuwsen leads the Pac-10 and is tied for second
in the nation with five. Bradford has had a relatively quiet sopho
more season for the Cardinal, with 27 catches and no touchdowns. If
the Beavers focus on shutting down tight end Alex Smith. Bradford
and the rest of the receiving corps could have a big day.

E

OSU DE Bill Swancutt vs. Stanford O-Line

Oregon State's pass rush has improved as the season has worn on. with 13
of the team's 18 sacks coming in the last five games. Swancutt leads the
team with 6.5 sacks, and his 32 career sacks are an Oregon State record.
Tomorrow may be senior day, but the play of the Cardinal's sophomore
dominated offensive line will go along way toward determining whether
Stanford's slim hopes fora bowl-and quarterback-are still alive after to
morrow. Since giving up 10 sacks in a Homecoming loss to Oregon two
weeks ago, the unit has allowed just six the past two weeks. Junior center
Brian Head returned to the lineup last week.

Stanford (4-5,2-4 Pacific-10 Conference) will not lack for sources of motivation when it hosts Oregon State (4-5,3-3) to
morrow at Stanford Stadium. The game marks the final home appearance for 11 seniors, comes on the heels of a heart
breaking loss to Arizona State and is against the team that dealt the Cardinal an embarrassing 43-3 loss one year ago. The
game also has serious bowl implications for both teams. A win keeps the Cardinal in the hunt; a loss ensures another los
ing season. Here are three key matchups to watch:

1

OSU QB Derek Anderson vs. Stanford Secondary

For the second consecutive week, senior Stanley Wilson
and the Cardinal secondary must contend with one of the
most prolific passers in Pac-10 history. Anderson, a senior,
is one of five quarterbacks in conference history to throw
for over 10,000 yards (10,026) and is the Beavers' all-time
leader in that department. His 68 career touchdown pass
es, including 18 this year, are also a school record. After
throwing nine in interceptions in his first five games, he's
thrown just three picks in the Beavers' last four.

2

OSU Secondary vs. Stanford WR Mark Bradford

Speaking of picks, the Beavers' secondary, anchored by senior cor
nerback Aric Williams, is an interception machine. Williams is the
Pac-10 leader for passes defensed with 13. including four picks, while
secondary mates Sabby Piscitelli, a sophomore, and senior Mitch
Meeuwsen have the game to match their names. Piscitelli has four in
terceptions, while Meeuwsen leads the Pac-10 and is tied for second
in the nation with five. Bradford has had a relatively quiet sopho
more season for the Cardinal, with 27 catches and no touchdowns. If
the Beavers focus on shutting down tight end Alex Smith. Bradford
and the rest of the receiving corps could have a big day.

E

OSU DE Bill Swancutt vs. Stanford O-Line

Oregon State's pass rush has improved as the season has worn on. with 13
of the team's 18 sacks coming in the last five games. Swancutt leads the
team with 6.5 sacks, and his 32 career sacks are an Oregon State record.
Tomorrow may be senior day, but the play of the Cardinal's sophomore
dominated offensive line will go along way toward determining whether
Stanford's slim hopes fora bowl-and quarterback-are still alive after to
morrow. Since giving up 10 sacks in a Homecoming loss to Oregon two
weeks ago, the unit has allowed just six the past two weeks. Junior center
Brian Head returned to the lineup last week.
