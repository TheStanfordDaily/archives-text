# Alston brings passion to the field
## 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Among college football players, there
are certain academic majors that are far
more popular than others. Drama is not
one of them. But Stanford junior outside
linebacker Jon Alston, already a public
policy major, is set to declare drama as
his second majoj very shortly.
"Do what you like in school, do some
thing that interests you, and things will
work out from there," Alston said.
"Drama's something I've taken a pretty
good interest to. I love film; 1 love theater
and acting."
A self-described "extremely passion
ate" person, Alston brings enthusiasm to
the football field as well as the stage. As
part of a veteran linebacking corps, Al
ston is having a breakout season and is
one of the reasons the Stanford defense
has been so strong this year.
"He has played very well for us," said
head coach Ruddy Teevens. "He's a
wonderful person to work with. He's en
thusiastic. positive and optimistic, as well
as gifted athletically."
In his nine starts this season Alston
has racked up a team-high eight sacks,
third-most in the Pacific-10 Conference.
He also has 54 tackles, third-most on the
team, including 11.5 tackles fora loss.
His three forced fumbles are the second
most in the conference.
"I just feel like I've gotten an oppor
tunity to come out and play like I know I
can play," Alston said. "It's something
that I take a lot of pride in."
Alston's biggest game this season
came last weekend at Arizona State,
when he had four sacks, seven tackles, a
forced fumble and a fumble recovery.
"We get him on the field and then put
him in a one-to-one pass rush mode,"
Teevens said. "He uses his quickness and
athleticism on the tackle. We're running
that with great success."
"The coaches put me in a position to
make plays," Alston said. "I just came
into the game very focused and had a re
ally good attitude. Things just worked
out." ♦
Alston's modest attitude doesn't go
unnoticed.
"He's a fun guy with a wonderful per
sonality and is a good team player,"
Teevens said. "He'll point to everyone
else but himself in terms of taking credit
for something. He's a great leader for us
defensively."
Despite the team's struggles, Alston
has maintained a positive outlook, which
he credits fora lot of his personal success.
"To sit here and focus on the negative
things is something that I don't want to
express to my teammates or even express
to myself." Alston said about moving
past the Arizona State loss. "By staying
positive I keep a great attitude and am
able to improve throughout the week."
With fellow linebackers Jared New
berry. Kevin Schimmelmann and David
Bergeron. Alston helps form a lineback
er unit that is one of the most experi

enced groups on the Stanford squad.
"I love these guys like brothers," Al
ston said. "It's great to look into some
one's face, someone's eyes and know
that they are going to fight just like you
fight. They're going to play just like you
play."
With the offense often struggling to
move the ball, Alston and his fellow de
fenders must step up their games to a
higher level.
"During the game I only focus on
whether I'm doing my responsibility to
help the team win." Alston said.

While Stanford's record may not be
what many had hoped for at this point in
the year, Alston still feels that this team
is different from years past.
"This team is a special team, a special
group of guys," Alston said. "We love
each other to death, but at the same time
we hold each other more accountable
than we have in the past."
After a series of important games for
the Cardinal the past few weeks, tomor
row's contest is the ultimate must-win
situation. Win. and play another mean
ingful game — lose, and head into Big

Game without the possibility of qualify
ing fora howl. If the Cardinal are going
to be successful, it is crucial that Alston
and other team leaders keep the team
positive and on track.
"We have to play with faith and be
lieve in ourselves the entire game," Al
ston said. "That's really all we have to do.
If we do. we'll win."
Alston and his Cardinal teammates
are going to have to put up their best per
formances of the year to keep Stanford
in contention, right through the final
scene.

he credits fora lot of his personal success.
"To sit here and focus on the negative
things is something that I don't want to
express to my teammates or even express
to myself." Alston said about moving
past the Arizona State loss. "By staying
positive I keep a great attitude and am
able to improve throughout the week."

"I love these guys like brothers," Al
ston said. "It's great to look into some
one's face, someone's eyes and know
that they are going to fight just like you
fight. They're going to play just like you
play."
With the offense often struggling to
move the ball, Alston and his fellow de

higher level.
"During the game I only focus on
whether I'm doing my responsibility to
help the team win." Alston said.

While Stanford's record may not be
what many had hoped for at this point in
the year, Alston still feels that this team
is different from years past.
"This team is a special team, a special
group of guys," Alston said. "We love
each other to death, but at the same time
we hold each other more accountable
than we have in the past."

If we do. we'll win."

joys playing other roles and plans to declare drama as his second major.
Among college football players, there
are certain academic majors that are far
more popular than others. Drama is not
one of them. But Stanford junior outside
linebacker Jon Alston, already a public
policy major, is set to declare drama as
his second majoj very shortly.
"Do what you like in school, do some
thing that interests you, and things will
work out from there," Alston said.
"Drama's something I've taken a pretty
good interest to. I love film; 1 love theater
and acting."
A self-described "extremely passion
ate" person, Alston brings enthusiasm to
the football field as well as the stage. As
part of a veteran linebacking corps, Al
ston is having a breakout season and is
one of the reasons the Stanford defense
has been so strong this year.
"He has played very well for us," said
head coach Ruddy Teevens. "He's a
wonderful person to work with. He's en
thusiastic. positive and optimistic, as well
as gifted athletically."
In his nine starts this season Alston
has racked up a team-high eight sacks,
third-most in the Pacific-10 Conference.
He also has 54 tackles, third-most on the
team, including 11.5 tackles fora loss.
His three forced fumbles are the second
most in the conference.
"I just feel like I've gotten an oppor
tunity to come out and play like I know I
can play," Alston said. "It's something
that I take a lot of pride in."
Alston's biggest game this season
came last weekend at Arizona State,
when he had four sacks, seven tackles, a
forced fumble and a fumble recovery.
"We get him on the field and then put
him in a one-to-one pass rush mode,"
Teevens said. "He uses his quickness and
athleticism on the tackle. We're running
that with great success."
"The coaches put me in a position to
make plays," Alston said. "I just came
into the game very focused and had a re
ally good attitude. Things just worked
out." ♦
Alston's modest attitude doesn't go
unnoticed.
"He's a fun guy with a wonderful per
sonality and is a good team player,"
Teevens said. "He'll point to everyone
else but himself in terms of taking credit
for something. He's a great leader for us
defensively."
Despite the team's struggles, Alston
has maintained a positive outlook, which
he credits fora lot of his personal success.
