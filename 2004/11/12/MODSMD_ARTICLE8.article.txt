## Study prompts med schools to diversify 
### ADAM WIDMAN 
With the recent release of 2004 medical school admis
sions data, Stanford Medical School and other medical
schools across the country are again carefully measuring
the diversity of their student bodies.
According to the Association of American Medical
Colleges, a governing body for American medical schools,
this year's data suggests that several minority groups re
main underrepresented in medical schools. Both Stanford
Medical School and the A AMC have a number of policies
and initiatives designed to increase the presence of mi
norities in America's medical institutions.
"The need to have members of all our under-served
communities represented and fully participating in our
medical learning environment is clear." said Gabriel Gar
cia, associate dean of admissions at Stanford Medical
School. "We believe that diversity in our learning envi
ronment will reduce ignorance among our future health
care workers, reduce stereotyping and prejudice of their
colleagues and clients, and improve skills in interaction
and cooperation among people of different races, ethnici
ties, gender, cultures, sexual orientation, socioeconomic
status and religious beliefs."
The AAMC released a study on Oct. 14 about medical
admissions data suggesting that although students of Lati
no, African-American, and Native American heritage are
more prevalent in health education than they were last
year, they are still underrepresented in the medical com
munity.
Data from the report shows that of applicants admitted
to medical school in 2004. 7 percent were of Hispanic ori
gin, 6 percent were African American, and 0.3 percent
were Native American. All three groups are well below
the representation of their respective groups in the popu
lation.
Furthermore, the admissions rate for non-minority stu
dents is higher than the admissions rate for any ethnicity
recognized by the AAMC as a minority. The national ac
ceptance rate for non-minority students is 52.1 percent.
