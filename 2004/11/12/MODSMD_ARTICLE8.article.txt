## Study prompts med schools to diversify 
### ADAM WIDMAN 
With the recent release of 2004 medical school admis
sions data, Stanford Medical School and other medical
schools across the country are again carefully measuring
the diversity of their student bodies.
According to the Association of American Medical
Colleges, a governing body for American medical schools,
this year's data suggests that several minority groups re
main underrepresented in medical schools. Both Stanford
Medical School and the A AMC have a number of policies
and initiatives designed to increase the presence of mi
norities in America's medical institutions.
"The need to have members of all our under-served
communities represented and fully participating in our
medical learning environment is clear." said Gabriel Gar
cia, associate dean of admissions at Stanford Medical
School. "We believe that diversity in our learning envi
ronment will reduce ignorance among our future health
care workers, reduce stereotyping and prejudice of their
colleagues and clients, and improve skills in interaction
and cooperation among people of different races, ethnici
ties, gender, cultures, sexual orientation, socioeconomic
status and religious beliefs."
The AAMC released a study on Oct. 14 about medical
admissions data suggesting that although students of Lati
no, African-American, and Native American heritage are
more prevalent in health education than they were last
year, they are still underrepresented in the medical com
munity.
Data from the report shows that of applicants admitted
to medical school in 2004. 7 percent were of Hispanic ori
gin, 6 percent were African American, and 0.3 percent
were Native American. All three groups are well below
the representation of their respective groups in the popu
lation.
Furthermore, the admissions rate for non-minority stu
dents is higher than the admissions rate for any ethnicity
recognized by the AAMC as a minority. The national ac
ceptance rate for non-minority students is 52.1 percent.

The acceptance rate for Asians,
African-Americans, and Americans
of Hispanic origin are 48 percent, 41
percent and 49 percent, respectively.
To increase the number of under
served minorities, many institutions
have taken significant action. Stan
ford. for example, has committed to
creating within its medical school a
widely diverse community with indi
viduals of different perspectives and
backgrounds. Consequently, it ac
tively recruits minorities that are un
derrepresented in the medical com
munity.
Garcia said that Stanford consid
ers an applicant's potential contribu
tion to the medical school's diversity
as one of many factors in a compli
cated admissions process where
there is no specific quota for any mi
nority.
"Race and ethnicity is just one of
many factors that we consider as
contributions to diversity in our ap
plicants." Garcia said. "Our interest
is in diversity broadly defined, so it is
misleading to suggest that there is a
higher demand' for certain individ
uals. We value individuals from all
communities that are under-served
in medicine as contributors to our
learning climate."
The Medical School's policies on
diversity are reflective of a national
movement by medical institutions
and the AAMC to design policies
and initiatives that increase the pres
ence of underrepresented minorities
in the medical community.
"We must continue, for as long as
necessary, to reach out to those
whose race and ethnicity, not their
economic status alone, have subject-

Ed them to inferior academic prepa
rations. hut who by dint, character
and drive are fully prepared to suc
ceed as medical scientists," said Jor
dan Baker, president of AAMC, on
the group's website.
Students in the Stanford commu
nity have mixed reactions to the ef
forts of medical schools to recruit
minorities. Some say they feel that
because of the intense competition
to enroll in medical school, the ap
plications of all individuals should
be judged purely by academic merit.
"Having minorities well-repre
sented in American medical schools
ensures that there is no prejudice in
the admissions process and allows
for equal opportunity for pursuers of
the medical profession," said fresh
man and pre-med hopeful Ming Zhi.
"However, now that all applicants
have been presented with equal op
portunities in college, there should
be no favoring of minority appli
cants. Instead, admissions should be
based on personal merit."
Others disagreed.
"By giving attention to the admis
sion of minority students into medi
cal school, university administrators
acknowledge the importance of stu
dents being able to interact with oth
ers who have come from a complete
ly different walk of life than they
have," said junior pre-med Waasil
Kareem. "This interaction not only
fosters further understanding of
people's differences but also pro
motes the opportunity for individu
als to enrich their own educational
process through exposure to differ
ent types of students."

minorities. Some say they feel that
because of the intense competition
to enroll in medical school, the ap
plications of all individuals should
be judged purely by academic merit.
"Having minorities well-repre
sented in American medical schools
ensures that there is no prejudice in
the admissions process and allows
for equal opportunity for pursuers of
the medical profession," said fresh
man and pre-med hopeful Ming Zhi.
"However, now that all applicants
have been presented with equal op
portunities in college, there should
be no favoring of minority appli
cants. Instead, admissions should be
based on personal merit."
Others disagreed.
"By giving attention to the admis
sion of minority students into medi
cal school, university administrators
acknowledge the importance of stu
dents being able to interact with oth
ers who have come from a complete
ly different walk of life than they
have," said junior pre-med Waasil
Kareem. "This interaction not only
fosters further understanding of
people's differences but also pro
motes the opportunity for individu
als to enrich their own educational
process through exposure to differ
ent types of students."
With the recent release of 2004 medical school admis
sions data, Stanford Medical School and other medical
schools across the country are again carefully measuring
the diversity of their student bodies.
According to the Association of American Medical
Colleges, a governing body for American medical schools,
this year's data suggests that several minority groups re
main underrepresented in medical schools. Both Stanford
Medical School and the A AMC have a number of policies
and initiatives designed to increase the presence of mi
norities in America's medical institutions.
"The need to have members of all our under-served
communities represented and fully participating in our
medical learning environment is clear." said Gabriel Gar
cia, associate dean of admissions at Stanford Medical
School. "We believe that diversity in our learning envi
ronment will reduce ignorance among our future health
care workers, reduce stereotyping and prejudice of their
colleagues and clients, and improve skills in interaction
and cooperation among people of different races, ethnici
ties, gender, cultures, sexual orientation, socioeconomic
status and religious beliefs."
The AAMC released a study on Oct. 14 about medical
admissions data suggesting that although students of Lati
no, African-American, and Native American heritage are
more prevalent in health education than they were last
year, they are still underrepresented in the medical com
munity.
Data from the report shows that of applicants admitted
to medical school in 2004. 7 percent were of Hispanic ori
gin, 6 percent were African American, and 0.3 percent
were Native American. All three groups are well below
the representation of their respective groups in the popu
lation.
Furthermore, the admissions rate for non-minority stu
dents is higher than the admissions rate for any ethnicity
recognized by the AAMC as a minority. The national ac
ceptance rate for non-minority students is 52.1 percent.

recruitment

The acceptance rate for Asians,
African-Americans, and Americans
of Hispanic origin are 48 percent, 41
percent and 49 percent, respectively.
To increase the number of under
served minorities, many institutions
have taken significant action. Stan
ford. for example, has committed to
creating within its medical school a
widely diverse community with indi
viduals of different perspectives and
backgrounds. Consequently, it ac
tively recruits minorities that are un
derrepresented in the medical com
munity.
Garcia said that Stanford consid
ers an applicant's potential contribu
tion to the medical school's diversity
as one of many factors in a compli
cated admissions process where
there is no specific quota for any mi
nority.
"Race and ethnicity is just one of
many factors that we consider as
contributions to diversity in our ap
plicants." Garcia said. "Our interest
is in diversity broadly defined, so it is
misleading to suggest that there is a
higher demand' for certain individ
uals. We value individuals from all
communities that are under-served
in medicine as contributors to our
learning climate."
The Medical School's policies on
diversity are reflective of a national
movement by medical institutions
and the AAMC to design policies
and initiatives that increase the pres
ence of underrepresented minorities
in the medical community.
"We must continue, for as long as
necessary, to reach out to those
whose race and ethnicity, not their
economic status alone, have subject-

Ed them to inferior academic prepa
rations. hut who by dint, character
and drive are fully prepared to suc
ceed as medical scientists," said Jor
dan Baker, president of AAMC, on
the group's website.
