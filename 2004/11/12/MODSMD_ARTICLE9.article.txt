Stanford Medical School Dean Dr.
Phil Pizzo was the first person named to
the state committee responsible for dis
bursing the $3 billion stem-cell research
fund established by Proposition 71. State
Controller Steve Westly last Friday ap
pointed Pizzo to the 29-member Inde
pendent Oversight Committee, which
will help govern the Institute for Regen
erative Medicine, the new California
agency created by Prop. 71 that is com
parable to a state version of the National
Institute of Health.
In a press release. Westly said he se
lected Pizzo because of his reputation as

"a world-recognized leader" in the field.
"I know that he will help ensure that Cal
ifornians' investment in stem-cell re
search will be spent wisely on the science
with the highest likelihood of producing
cures for diseases." Westly said.
Pizzo said in the same release that he
was honored by the appointment and en
thusiastic about the work ahead. "The
Institute for Regenerative Medicine will
bring new funds to a field of research that
has shown the potential to change the
way we understand and treat disease."
he said.
He also said he was encouraged by the
strong margin of public support for the
initiative, which passed with 59 percent
of the vote. "Passage of the proposition is

a clear affirmation that the citizens of
California value this area of scientific in
vestigation." Pizzo said. "I look forward
to serving in this important endeavor."
Medical experts predict that the re
search money will be a boon to universi
ties like Stanford, CalTech and the five
University of California medical schools
that have already developed reputable
stem-cell research programs.
University President John Hennessy
said the initiative would further bolster
the status of Stanford's medical program
— joking that the University would soon
be able to recruit all of Harvard's top fac
ulty — at a private donor reception last
night.
He also expressed hope of construct

ing a new center dedicated to the issue.
"We have a dream to build a new
building to house a center for stem-cell
research," Hennessy said.
Westly said he expects the funds will
go further to revitalize the state economy
as a whole.
"1 am confident that the investment
California is making will serve as a mag
net to bring the best researchers in the
world to our state, and that the long-term
benefits to our economy will be signifi
cant," Westly said.
The new committee will distribute up
to $295 million in grants annually for the
next 10 years, making the stem-cell ini
tintive the largest state-run research pro
ject in U.S. history. Opponents of the bal
lot measure remain critical of the fact that
it was heavily backed by individuals who
stood to profit tremendously from its pas
sage. Venture capitalists and others con
nected to the biotechnology industry con
tributed $28 million to sponsor the initia
tive.
State officials said specific measures
have been put in place to address the po
tential conflicts of interest. Appointments
to the committee will be made by at least
seven different bodies, including Go.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, the five Univer
sities of California with medical schools,
the state treasurer and the leaders of the
state Assembly and Senate.
Board members are limited to two six
year terms. The remaining members will
be appointed over the next 40 days. The
committee will begin reviewing grant pro
posals in nud-Deccmber.
Pi/zo was appointed the Med
ical School in April 2(M)1. He is especially
well-known for his contributions as a clin
ical investigator, with an emphasis on
treating children's cancer and HIV. and he
received the U.S. Public Health Service
Outstanding Servicc Medal Award in
1995.
