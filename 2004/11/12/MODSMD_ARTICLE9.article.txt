Stanford Medical School Dean Dr.
Phil Pizzo was the first person named to
the state committee responsible for dis
bursing the $3 billion stem-cell research
fund established by Proposition 71. State
Controller Steve Westly last Friday ap
pointed Pizzo to the 29-member Inde
pendent Oversight Committee, which
will help govern the Institute for Regen
erative Medicine, the new California
agency created by Prop. 71 that is com

Institute of Health.
In a press release. Westly said he se
lected Pizzo because of his reputation as

"a world-recognized leader" in the field.
"I know that he will help ensure that Cal
ifornians' investment in stem-cell re

with the highest likelihood of producing
cures for diseases." Westly said.
Pizzo said in the same release that he
was honored by the appointment and en

University President John Hennessy

night.
He also expressed hope of construct

Westly said he expects the funds will

The new committee will distribute up
