America Recycles A
Willi the involvement and enthusiasm of people like you, recycling is back and so are thousands upon
mW
thousands of recycled products made from materials that would otherwise be piling up in our nation's land- 'y'c 'l l A s
fills. It doesn t just make sense. It makes a huge difference to our environment, our quality of life, and our 2004
country's future
Why It's Important
As stewards of the environment, we are responsible for
preserving and protecting our resources for ourselves
and for future generations.
Getting Back To Basics
Recycling is really just common sense, and until the
"modern era,'' it was a common household activity.
Before the 19205, 70% of I S. cities ran programs to
recycle certain materials. During
World War 11. industry recycled and
reused about 25% of the waste '
stream. Because of concern for the ,
environment, recycling is again on
the upswing. The nation's compost- yr
ing and recycling rate rose from
7.7% of the waste stream in 1000 to -sB
17% In 1990. It's currently up to^
around 30%. California is at about
48%.
The Garbage Crisis
The world has changed a lot in the past century. From
individually packaged food servings to disposable dia
llers. more garbage is generated now than ever before.

n| HI OH IMii I Ml K
The average American discards seven and a half pounds
of garbage every day. This garbage, the solid waste
stream, goes mostly to landfills, where it's compacted and
buried. As the waste stream continues to grow, so will the
pressures on our landfills, our resources, and our envi
ronment.
Recycling - An Important
Part Of The Solution
The more we recycle, the less garbage
winds up in our landfills and incineration
plants. By reusing aluminum, paper, glass.
% plastics, and other materials, we can save
production and energy costs, and reduce
m the negative impacts that the extraction
jfeaa and processing of virgin materials lias on
Jy the environment.

It all comes back to you.
Recycling gets down to one person taking action. New
products can be made from your recyclable waste mate
rial. Recycling is good for our environment, our com
munities, and our economy.
