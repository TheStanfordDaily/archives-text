# Munger dorm plans draw complaints
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The impending construction of the 600-occu
pant Munger Graduate Residences has raised
serious concerns among some community mem
bers who worry about the impact that such a
large, centrally located project could have on
campus. Many of these campus residents gath
ered at Chi Theta Chi on Saturday morning to
discuss their concerns with Associate Vice
Provost for Facilities Chris Christofferson and to
plan for the future.
"The residents, almost without exception,
recognize that this is an important venture, but
they're worried about the scale and scope," said
David Victor, a senior fellow in international
studies and a resident of Alvarado Row, which
runs through the proposed project site.
"We're also deeply worried about the speed
with which crucial decisions have been made."
The construction of the Munger residences
was officially announced last September. As cur
rently planned, the complex will consist of three
buildings — each of them between four and five
and-a-half stories tall — located south of Stern
Hall. The project will also entail widening parts
of Campus Drive from two to four lanes, con
structing a 750-car parking garage below the res
idences and relocating parts of Salvatierra Walk,
including the Rogers and Owens houses.
"The project is enormous for the site," Victor
said. "It's eoing to transform the feel of this side

of campus. Imagine a project three times as big
as the alumni center running through the middle
of the major campus thoroughfares."
In recent months, administration representa
tives have met with a variety of concerned facul
ty, staff, student and resident groups to discuss
the issue.
"The university has engaged in a very aggres
sive and comprehensive outreach effort with the
local community," said Vice Provost for Public
Affairs Gordon Earle. "We're listening carefully
to the issues and concerns that have been ex
pressed by homeowners and others and have es
tablished a process for ongoing communica
tions."
At Saturday's meeting, Christofferson re
sponded to concerns about both the project and
the decision-making process behind it.
"I think that there is a fair amount of time for
the design to be improved," he told the group.
Noting that community concerns had influenced
project's traffic study — which will be completed
in March — he added, "You have affected the
process already and will continue to do that."
Christofferson pointed out that the Universi
ty's General Use Permit requires the construc
tion of new academic units to be accompanied by
the addition of new housing units.
"This project allows us to front load the hous
ing requirement and get it out of the way," he
said.
One point of contention was whether donor
Charles Munger had too much influence over

the planning process. Munger donated $43.5 mil
lion for the construction, which is budgeted at
$ 1 (K) million.
"The administration did not cave into the in
terests of the donor," Christofferson said.
"Donors tend to be wealthy and successful, and
they necessarily have strong opinions. There was
a three-year back-and-forth process to reach an
acceptable agreement."
Much of the group's discussion focused on
publicizing the issue, particularly before Dec. 13,
when the project's design goes before the Board
of Trustees for approval. The group will hold a
demonstration on Nov. 30 in hopes of raising
community awareness about the project, its size
and its potential impact.
Chi Theta Chi house manager Abby Hall, a
co-terminal student, said she was skeptical about
the impact that administration meetings with the
community would have.
"It seems like it he [Christofferson] is coming
to placate us, to make us feel like the University
is listening," she said. "But it doesn't seem like
there's been a strong response from the people
with all the power."
Hall also claimed that the Munger residences
would harm Chi Theta Chi.
"It's going to cut off a main part of the campus
and isolate our community," she said. "We love
the University, and we're opposed to this project
because the integrity that has been shown in the
past is not there."

said.
One point of contention was whether donor
Charles Munger had too much influence over

the planning process. Munger donated $43.5 mil
lion for the construction, which is budgeted at
$ 1 (K) million.
"The administration did not cave into the in
terests of the donor," Christofferson said.
"Donors tend to be wealthy and successful, and
they necessarily have strong opinions. There was
a three-year back-and-forth process to reach an
acceptable agreement."
Much of the group's discussion focused on
publicizing the issue, particularly before Dec. 13,
when the project's design goes before the Board
of Trustees for approval. The group will hold a
demonstration on Nov. 30 in hopes of raising
community awareness about the project, its size
and its potential impact.
Chi Theta Chi house manager Abby Hall, a
co-terminal student, said she was skeptical about
the impact that administration meetings with the
community would have.
"It seems like it he [Christofferson] is coming
to placate us, to make us feel like the University
is listening," she said. "But it doesn't seem like
there's been a strong response from the people
with all the power."
Hall also claimed that the Munger residences
would harm Chi Theta Chi.
"It's going to cut off a main part of the campus
and isolate our community," she said. "We love
the University, and we're opposed to this project
because the integrity that has been shown in the
past is not there."
