# Best-kept secret...
## An escape from the housing draw 
### CAROLINE CICCONE STAFF WRITER 
Hidden bv trees and bushes, with only a
small sign leading to its front door, is per
haps the best-kept secret in Stanford hous
ing. Few students have heard of it, and even
fewer have visited this place.
Welcome to Kingscote.
Kingscote Gardens is on Lagunita Drive,
tucked behind the Faculty Club and
Tresidder Union. Kingscote has been owned
by Stanford since 19%, said Susan Nicholls.
landlord of the building.
The building is operated by Stanford
Management Company, but is not run by
Residential Education so word about
Kingscote is spread by mouth among
undergraduates and graduate students on
campus. Students who live in Kingscote do
not participate in the Draw. In order to get
in. you must know someone who is moving
out.
The building was originally constructed
in 1917 to house Stanford faculty and their
families: now it is occupied by faculty, grad
uate students and the occasional under
grad. Residents must be affiliated with
Stanford.
The selling point for many Kingscoters is
the location. It's sort of an on-campus off
campus residence. Kingscote has the bene
fits of off-campus housing: Residents can
live for as long as they remain affiliated with
Stanford, have independence from the
University and have all the amenities of an
apartment, including a kitchen. It is steps
away from Jamaba Juice and classes.
"I've lived in Oak Creek and in Palo
Alto." said mechanical engineering co-term
Kyle Doerksen. "But given my car-lessness
and the fact that all the buildings where I
spend my time as an ME co-term are within
a block. Kingscote is ideal."
An added bonus to Kingscote is that res
idents get a parking space there.
Comparable A permits costa Stanford stu
dent over $400 for the academic year. At
Kingscote, the monthly rent fora studio is
$675; the cost varies depending on the type
of residence.
Studnets who complain about the

"Stanford Bubble" said that Kingscote
allows them to feel like they are real
adults living independently of the
University.
"People live there, in my opinion,to pre
serve their sanity — many of the student
tenants were graduate students or seniors
writing theses that required little distrac
tion from neighbors," said senior Hunter
Hargraves, who lived in Kingscote last
year. "Kingscote is. in essence, a sanctuary
from the busy Stanford routine.
Fortunately, that sanctuary is perfectly situ
ated. and even though there is no RA to
help you out in the event of a lockout, it
does a damn good job of being an oasis
with a pretty garden."
Doerksen agrees.
"It's very quiet, the gardens are beautiful
and it's a nice place to call home."
A Kingscote apartment comes at a good
price. Last year. Hargraves' 1-bedroom
apartment shared between two people went
for $1,250 a month, including a parking spot
and utilities.
Though this rent is more expensive than
on-campus housing, comparable off-campus
apartments can go for much more.
But there's no such thing as a free lunch.
Along with location, calm and beauty comes
a cramped studio wanting renovation.
Kingscote apartments have thin walls and
show their age.
"It takes about two minutes to get hot
water in the bathroom sink, but it's a trade
off for location and convenience," Doerksen
said.
Stewart Nielson. a sociology co-term, is
living in Kingscote for his second year.
"Rent is a steal compared to Palo Alto
rates, and though my basement apartment is
kind of dark and the ceiling is a bit low and
I don't have my own in-suite bathroom,
altogether it's a very comfortable place to
live," Nielson wrote in an e-mail. "Some of
the other apartments. I'm told, are quite big
and have their own bathrooms — of course,
they go for quite a bit more."
So how do you get to live there?
Doerksen says apartments get passed
down or inherited by people who know each
other. His apartment has housed affiliated
people for the past six years.

dent over $400 for the academic year. At
Kingscote, the monthly rent fora studio is
$675; the cost varies depending on the type
of residence.
Studnets who complain about the

"Stanford Bubble" said that Kingscote
allows them to feel like they are real
adults living independently of the
University.
"People live there, in my opinion,to pre
serve their sanity — many of the student
tenants were graduate students or seniors
writing theses that required little distrac
tion from neighbors," said senior Hunter
Hargraves, who lived in Kingscote last
year. "Kingscote is. in essence, a sanctuary
from the busy Stanford routine.
Fortunately, that sanctuary is perfectly situ
ated. and even though there is no RA to
help you out in the event of a lockout, it
does a damn good job of being an oasis
with a pretty garden."
Doerksen agrees.
"It's very quiet, the gardens are beautiful
and it's a nice place to call home."
A Kingscote apartment comes at a good
price. Last year. Hargraves' 1-bedroom
apartment shared between two people went
for $1,250 a month, including a parking spot
and utilities.
Though this rent is more expensive than
on-campus housing, comparable off-campus
apartments can go for much more.
But there's no such thing as a free lunch.
Along with location, calm and beauty comes
a cramped studio wanting renovation.
Kingscote apartments have thin walls and
show their age.
"It takes about two minutes to get hot
water in the bathroom sink, but it's a trade
off for location and convenience," Doerksen
said.
Stewart Nielson. a sociology co-term, is
living in Kingscote for his second year.
"Rent is a steal compared to Palo Alto
rates, and though my basement apartment is
kind of dark and the ceiling is a bit low and
I don't have my own in-suite bathroom,
altogether it's a very comfortable place to
live," Nielson wrote in an e-mail. "Some of
the other apartments. I'm told, are quite big
and have their own bathrooms — of course,
they go for quite a bit more."
So how do you get to live there?
Doerksen says apartments get passed
down or inherited by people who know each
other. His apartment has housed affiliated
people for the past six years.
