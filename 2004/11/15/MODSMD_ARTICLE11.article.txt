"We've been trying to throw as
much out there as we can to get the
art community out in the open
instead of hiding in their dorm
rooms," said junior Megan Miller.
Student Organizing Committee for
the Arts, or SOCA. member.
SOCA offers students opportu
nities to showcase their art. whether
it's through the all-day celebration
An Art Affair or "TTie Stanford
Soundtrack." a compilation of stu
dent-written and student-recorded
songs.
"Once they get here, a lot of stu
dents lose focus of [art]," said James
Lin. senior and SOCA president. "A
lot of people are very talented in
that area and they just don't have
either the venue or the community
that supports it — we're trying to
change that."
Miller said she wants more
opportunities for students to show
case their art.
"The Stanford arts community
and music community are pretty
underground in the sense that
everyone does art or music —
everyone has a hidden talent — but
they don't get out there because
they don't have the time or there's
not an appropriate venue," she said.
As a former physics major.
Miller felt isolated from the art
community when she first arrived
on campus.
"1 was suffering from what every
other techie here suffers from — I
have an artistic side to me. and I did
n't know how to express it.and I
couldn't find a way to share it with
the rest of the Stanford
Community." she said. "I looked
around the Stanford arts communi
ty and thought, where are the con
certs. where are the shows and
where are the students?"
Many students have artistic tal
ents. but they often take a back seat
to schoolwork and other extracur

ricular activities. Lin said.
SOCA wants to bring the spot
light back to the arts by celebrating
and promoting them at Stanford.
One way is by putting on events
where people — whether profes
sors. techies or art majors — can dis-

play their art.
SOCA was created in 1999 by
Seth Cohen. Class of 2()02. during
his freshman year. ITie first SOCA
event took place in 20(X).

"I chose to develop the event
because 1 sensed Stanford was
home to a phenomenal variety of
artistic talent and endeavor"Cohen
said in a Daily article from Feb. 27,
2002. "I felt these artists deserved
some platform for expression, and

there didn't seem to he an appropri
ate opportunity available on cam
pus."
The group's primary event. An
Art Affair, takes months of plan

ning. Last year, the event consisted
of more than 90 performances on
three stages. 500 pieces of visual art.
a free gourmet dinner for 600 peo
ple and distribution of 3,000 free
copies of The Stanford Soundtrack.
"It's our way of getting together

the entire community for one day
where they can share their art with
one another," Lin said.
But Miller hopes SOCA will
become a household name and an

avenue through which students can
express their creative sides.
"When someone thinks i want
to do something creative," I want
SOCA to be the first thing that pops
into their head." Miller said. "That's
the kind of widespread association
we are trying to inspire."
The group's most recent endeav
or. SOCA Forum Nights, will focus
on one kind of art. Student artists
will he able to get together to share
ideas and critiques, but most of all
their passion. Miller also hopes to
bring in local artists to share their
work.
SOCA will also continue with
projects like The Stanford
Soundtrack, a collaboration with
the Stanford Concert Network. The
compact disc features music from
Stanford bands and songwriters.
"A lot of these musicians don't
have the time or resources to create
a CD on their own," Lin said.
Last year, 60 entrants competed
for the 18 spots on the CD. The
fourth annual CD will be passed out
at An Art Affair on April 1.
SOCA also organizes projects
aimed at introducing students to art
through performances and exhibits.
Last year. SOCA In The City
offered students opportunities to go
to art venues in San Francisco, such
as the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art. In the winter quarter,
SOCA will raffle off tickets to local
performances and exhibits online.
Also next quarter, a program
called SOCA To Go will bring art to
freshmen dorms. Events feature a
student performance at weekly
house meetings. After the act, stu
dents create their own art with
Play-Doh and the dorm favorite
receives a copy of The Stanford
Soundtrack.
"The arts have always been a big
part of my life." said Miller.
"SOCA's provided me with the
opportunity to take my passion for
all of the arts and put it to good
use."

where are the students?"
Many students have artistic tal
ents. but they often take a back seat
to schoolwork and other extracur

ricular activities. Lin said.
SOCA wants to bring the spot
light back to the arts by celebrating
and promoting them at Stanford.
One way is by putting on events
where people — whether profes
sors. techies or art majors — can dis-

play their art.
SOCA was created in 1999 by
Seth Cohen. Class of 2()02. during
his freshman year. ITie first SOCA
event took place in 20(X).

"I chose to develop the event
because 1 sensed Stanford was
home to a phenomenal variety of
artistic talent and endeavor"Cohen
said in a Daily article from Feb. 27,
2002. "I felt these artists deserved
some platform for expression, and

there didn't seem to he an appropri
ate opportunity available on cam
pus."
The group's primary event. An
Art Affair, takes months of plan

ning. Last year, the event consisted
of more than 90 performances on
three stages. 500 pieces of visual art.
a free gourmet dinner for 600 peo
ple and distribution of 3,000 free
copies of The Stanford Soundtrack.
"It's our way of getting together

the entire community for one day
where they can share their art with
one another," Lin said.
But Miller hopes SOCA will
become a household name and an

avenue through which students can
express their creative sides.
"When someone thinks i want
to do something creative," I want
SOCA to be the first thing that pops
into their head." Miller said. "That's
the kind of widespread association
we are trying to inspire."
The group's most recent endeav
or. SOCA Forum Nights, will focus
on one kind of art. Student artists
will he able to get together to share
ideas and critiques, but most of all
their passion. Miller also hopes to
bring in local artists to share their
work.
SOCA will also continue with
projects like The Stanford
Soundtrack, a collaboration with
the Stanford Concert Network. The
compact disc features music from
Stanford bands and songwriters.
"A lot of these musicians don't
have the time or resources to create
a CD on their own," Lin said.
Last year, 60 entrants competed
for the 18 spots on the CD. The
fourth annual CD will be passed out
at An Art Affair on April 1.
SOCA also organizes projects
aimed at introducing students to art
through performances and exhibits.
Last year. SOCA In The City
offered students opportunities to go
to art venues in San Francisco, such
as the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art. In the winter quarter,
SOCA will raffle off tickets to local
performances and exhibits online.
Also next quarter, a program
called SOCA To Go will bring art to
freshmen dorms. Events feature a
student performance at weekly
house meetings. After the act, stu
dents create their own art with
Play-Doh and the dorm favorite
receives a copy of The Stanford
Soundtrack.
"The arts have always been a big
part of my life." said Miller.
"SOCA's provided me with the
opportunity to take my passion for
all of the arts and put it to good
use."

"We've been trying to throw as
much out there as we can to get the
art community out in the open
instead of hiding in their dorm
rooms," said junior Megan Miller.
Student Organizing Committee for
the Arts, or SOCA. member.
SOCA offers students opportu
nities to showcase their art. whether
it's through the all-day celebration
An Art Affair or "TTie Stanford
Soundtrack." a compilation of stu
dent-written and student-recorded
songs.
"Once they get here, a lot of stu
dents lose focus of [art]," said James
Lin. senior and SOCA president. "A
lot of people are very talented in
that area and they just don't have
either the venue or the community
that supports it — we're trying to
change that."
Miller said she wants more
opportunities for students to show
case their art.
"The Stanford arts community
and music community are pretty
underground in the sense that
everyone does art or music —
everyone has a hidden talent — but
they don't get out there because
they don't have the time or there's
not an appropriate venue," she said.
As a former physics major.
Miller felt isolated from the art
community when she first arrived
on campus.
"1 was suffering from what every
other techie here suffers from — I
have an artistic side to me. and I did
n't know how to express it.and I
couldn't find a way to share it with
the rest of the Stanford
Community." she said. "I looked
around the Stanford arts communi
ty and thought, where are the con
certs. where are the shows and
where are the students?"
