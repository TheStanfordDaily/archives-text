## Editorial ASSU needs more communication 
### 
Many Stanford students do not know what the
ASSU does. Many more students, while per
haps familiar with the general purpose of
student government, are nonetheless un
clear what the ASSU is doing at any given time.
To help remedy this lack of understanding among stu
dents, the ASSI 1 has created a Communication Commis
sion, resp< msible for increasing dialogue between the gov
ernmental body and its constituents. While the commis
si( >n's plan will likely increase awareness, it does not go far
enough in ensuring that the ASSU is taking proactive and
consistent efforts to inform students of its affairs.
The commission has adopted a four-pronged ap
proach to increasing student awareness of the ASSU
and its actions. The first component of the plan is an
event entitled "donut office hours," during which ASSU
Undergraduate senators sit in White Plaza for two
hours, once a month, to talk with those who stop by. Stu
dents are free to ask questions or discuss issues with the
present representatives.
While this proposal is a good idea, only holding of
fice hours once a month is not often enough to allow for
representatives to adequately connect with students.
Instead, it would be better to hold these office hours on
a given day of the week, on a weekly basis. This would
increase opportunities for access and exposure on the
part of students.
Additionally, holding the event on a consistent week
ly basis would make it more likely that students would be
aware that the office hours were taking place. If the
ASSU already has a problem when it tries to communi
cate to students, it is unrealistic to expect the body to ef
fectively communicate to students the date of each up
coming monthly office hours event.
On the other hand, if the event were held on the same
day on a weekly basis, students would only need to be in
formed once. and they would then know when and where
they could find their representatives for the remainder of
the school year. And since the 15 senators could divide up
the meetings among themselves, with only a few present
at each office hours, it is not as if all the senators would be
required to attend the meetings every week.
The second prong of the plan is that the Senate plans
to hold its meetings in a campus dorm once a quarter in
order to encourage student participation. Although the
attendance at last week's meeting in Toyon Hall was lack
luster, having the meetings in dorms still provides an es
sential way for students to get involved. And even if few
students take advantage of the opportunity, we think the
meetings will at least help improve the image of the
ASSU by making the organization appear more accessi
ble and responsive to student needs. This is essential, for
if students do not think the ASSU is relevant to their ev
eryday life, they will be less likely to take the effort to get
involved and participate in it.

of six I ><iil\ opinions staffers ami three community members at-large. Any signed columns and contributions
are the news of their respective writers anil do not necessarily represent the views of the editorial board.

The third and most promising of the commission 'sout
lined efforts consists of a newsletter that will be posted in
dorm bathrooms across campus. The newsletter will out
line all of the ASSU'scurrent undertakings and decisions.
We believe this is an excellent way to get the word out to
students about what student government is doing and
why students should pay attention to the ASSU.
But the Senate plans to publish the newsletter only
twice a quarter. Because the purpose of the newsletter is
to keep those on campus consistently informed, we would
like to see it published on a more regular basis if possible,
such as every two weeks.
I lowever, the most important aspect of the newsletter
will be its execution. All too often, these sorts of efforts on
the part of student government start strong in the fall, only
to break down as the school year progresses. It will be crit
ical for the ASSU to make sure it follows through by reg
ularly publishing the newsletter throughout the year, or
else students will be then left in the dark as to what the
body is up to.
The fourth and final prong of the plan is for ASSU sen
ate >rs to appear at freshman house meetings to address the
purpose of the ASSU, explain how the special-fees sys
tem operates, and discuss other student government is
sues. By proactively communicating with new members
of the Stanford community in this manner, the Senate is
providing valuable information to students who will
hopefully as a result retain greater knowledge of the
ASSU's purpose and actions for the rest of their careers
at Stanford. This outreach effort should be continued in
the years to come.
The above components of the Communication
Commission's proposal are a step in the right direction.
However, none of the prongs of the commission's plan
specifically addresses the lack of communication with
student groups that has also persistently plagued the
ASSU. such as the body's failure to alert special-fees
groups that they would not receive all of their fees fund
ing at the onset of the school year. We hope the com
mission will take action to improve communication
with student groups in the near future in the same way
it is now working to improve awareness among the stu
dent body as a whole.
A lack of student interest in the ASSU is hardly a new
phenomenon. In many ways, ignorance on the part of the
community about student government arguably is as
much the fault of students as it is of ASSU officials. How
ever. given its size and impact on campus, the ASSU is in
a unique position to help inspire interest and engagement
among students if it consistently and proactively works to
connect student government with its constituents. There
fore, we hope that the ASSU will continue to do more to
communicate to the student body about why student gov
ernment is important and what students can do to make
themselves heard.

the part of student government start strong in the fall, only
to break down as the school year progresses. It will be crit
ical for the ASSU to make sure it follows through by reg
ularly publishing the newsletter throughout the year, or
else students will be then left in the dark as to what the
body is up to.
The fourth and final prong of the plan is for ASSU sen
ate >rs to appear at freshman house meetings to address the
purpose of the ASSU, explain how the special-fees sys
tem operates, and discuss other student government is
sues. By proactively communicating with new members
of the Stanford community in this manner, the Senate is
providing valuable information to students who will
hopefully as a result retain greater knowledge of the
ASSU's purpose and actions for the rest of their careers
at Stanford. This outreach effort should be continued in
the years to come.
The above components of the Communication
Commission's proposal are a step in the right direction.
However, none of the prongs of the commission's plan
specifically addresses the lack of communication with
student groups that has also persistently plagued the
ASSU. such as the body's failure to alert special-fees
groups that they would not receive all of their fees fund
ing at the onset of the school year. We hope the com
mission will take action to improve communication
with student groups in the near future in the same way
it is now working to improve awareness among the stu
dent body as a whole.
A lack of student interest in the ASSU is hardly a new
phenomenon. In many ways, ignorance on the part of the
community about student government arguably is as
much the fault of students as it is of ASSU officials. How
ever. given its size and impact on campus, the ASSU is in
a unique position to help inspire interest and engagement
among students if it consistently and proactively works to
connect student government with its constituents. There
fore, we hope that the ASSU will continue to do more to
communicate to the student body about why student gov
ernment is important and what students can do to make
themselves heard.
Many Stanford students do not know what the
ASSU does. Many more students, while per
haps familiar with the general purpose of
student government, are nonetheless un
clear what the ASSU is doing at any given time.
To help remedy this lack of understanding among stu
dents, the ASSI 1 has created a Communication Commis
sion, resp< msible for increasing dialogue between the gov
ernmental body and its constituents. While the commis
si( >n's plan will likely increase awareness, it does not go far
enough in ensuring that the ASSU is taking proactive and
consistent efforts to inform students of its affairs.
The commission has adopted a four-pronged ap
proach to increasing student awareness of the ASSU
and its actions. The first component of the plan is an
event entitled "donut office hours," during which ASSU
Undergraduate senators sit in White Plaza for two
hours, once a month, to talk with those who stop by. Stu
dents are free to ask questions or discuss issues with the
present representatives.
While this proposal is a good idea, only holding of
fice hours once a month is not often enough to allow for
representatives to adequately connect with students.
Instead, it would be better to hold these office hours on
a given day of the week, on a weekly basis. This would
increase opportunities for access and exposure on the
part of students.
Additionally, holding the event on a consistent week
ly basis would make it more likely that students would be
aware that the office hours were taking place. If the
ASSU already has a problem when it tries to communi
cate to students, it is unrealistic to expect the body to ef
fectively communicate to students the date of each up
coming monthly office hours event.
On the other hand, if the event were held on the same
day on a weekly basis, students would only need to be in
formed once. and they would then know when and where
they could find their representatives for the remainder of
the school year. And since the 15 senators could divide up
the meetings among themselves, with only a few present
at each office hours, it is not as if all the senators would be
required to attend the meetings every week.
The second prong of the plan is that the Senate plans
to hold its meetings in a campus dorm once a quarter in
order to encourage student participation. Although the
attendance at last week's meeting in Toyon Hall was lack
luster, having the meetings in dorms still provides an es
sential way for students to get involved. And even if few
students take advantage of the opportunity, we think the
meetings will at least help improve the image of the
ASSU by making the organization appear more accessi
ble and responsive to student needs. This is essential, for
if students do not think the ASSU is relevant to their ev
eryday life, they will be less likely to take the effort to get
involved and participate in it.

are the news of their respective writers anil do not necessarily represent the views of the editorial board.

The third and most promising of the commission 'sout
lined efforts consists of a newsletter that will be posted in
dorm bathrooms across campus. The newsletter will out
line all of the ASSU'scurrent undertakings and decisions.
We believe this is an excellent way to get the word out to
students about what student government is doing and
why students should pay attention to the ASSU.
But the Senate plans to publish the newsletter only
twice a quarter. Because the purpose of the newsletter is
to keep those on campus consistently informed, we would
like to see it published on a more regular basis if possible,
such as every two weeks.
I lowever, the most important aspect of the newsletter
will be its execution. All too often, these sorts of efforts on
