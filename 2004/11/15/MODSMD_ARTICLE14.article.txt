## Stem cells save lives; Bush's measures inadequate 
### OLIVER KAPLAN 
Embryonic stem-cell research is
going to happen, and it's going to
happen here at Stanford. It is impor
tant that The Daily and its reader
ship come to understand why this is
taking place and why it is so impor
tant to millions of Americans.
Columns such as "Stem Cells and
over-the-top-rhetoric" (Nov. 12).
which claim to go beyond the talk
but then tell half-truths, are not
helping in this process.
The column begins with a biased,
anti-stem-cell-research point of
view. It is also hypocritical because,
in its attempt to lower the rhetoric, it
nevertheless employs lines such as,
"Not on the life of an unborn human
embryo." Rather than limiting open
debate on this issue, it should call for
an open exchange so people can in
form themselves.
Proposition 71. which passed in
California on Nov. 2 (see The New
York Times Editorial "California to
the Rescue") with a sizable 59 per
cent of the vote — surely including a
large number of "moderates" — is
allowing and funding this research in
our state for the next 10 years under
strict ethical guidelines. Our own
Dr. Phil Piz/.0, dean of the Stanford
School of Medicine, was just ap
pointed as the first member to the
new California Institute for Recen

erative Medicine's Independent
Oversight Committee.
To promote understanding, I
would like to offer three clarifications.
First, we may never come to
agree on whether or not a blastocyst
a 12-day old clump of cells — is
actually alive. Hut the biology is cer
tain that a blastocyst, on its own. will
never become a living, breathing
human being any more than a piece
of my fingernail. It is a misnomer to
use the word "killing" in this con
text, and I urge caution against play
ing fast and loose with the term
"human life."
Second, the embryos come from
excess repositories from in vitro fer
tilization clinics (with the woman's
consent) and would normally be dis
carded. Rather than discard this po
tential. our nation's best scientists
think we can save millions of lives
and reduce the human suffering of
living, breathing people. As a major
ity of Californians have voted, this is
the "pro-life" thing to do.
Lastly, let me clarify why so many
Californians feel so passionately
that this research must go forward
and must go forward now. It's not
the scientists who are excited about
new cures as much as it is patients
and their loved ones. People with
chronic, progressive or debilitating
diseases that might be cured by stem
cell research are in a race against

time.
They cannot wait (possibly forev
er) for cures that are developed
based on political timetables.
Rhetoric about whether or not Pres
ident George W. Bush turned his
back on science is less relevant than
whether or not we continue forward
with finding cures.
What some call a "reasonable
compromise" by Bush in only using
stem-cell lines that were created be
fore 2(M)1 is completely unpalatable
to the people with such diseases, in
cluding the late Christopher Reeve
of Superman fame, who became a
quadriplegic. But. it is ever a chal
lenge to put oneself in the other's
shoes.
This is a free country, and every
one is entitled to his or her own point
of view. But it is important to recog
nize why si) many people, including
Stanford's top faculty, so strongly
support this research. And. although
it is unlikely to happen, I also cer
tainly encourage Bush to fund new
stem-cell lines.
In the meantime, great works are
about to occur right here in Califor
nia and at Stanford, and it's time The
Daily and the Stanford community
got on board.
