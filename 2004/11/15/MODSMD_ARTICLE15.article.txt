# Op-Ed
## Studying abroad should broaden perspective 
### MING ZHU 
Having just returned from an
amazing study abroad experience. 1
had a few reservations with the
comments made in Julie Park's ar
ticle on "The Surreal World: Life in
Europe" (Nov. 12). I'm the first to
admit that some of her points were

valid — it is hard to go from smoke
free California to smoke-obsessed
Italy — but most of her points
seemed a bit, well, wrong.
First, every part of your Stan
ford career is what you make of it.
If you're staying on the Farm,
soaking in the sun. enjoying every
frat party and doing the bare mini

mum to pass in every class — I'd
call that a $40.(MH) vacation. On the
other hand, if you're going to every
Lively Arts concert, making some
lifelong friends and chatting with
world-famous professors. I'd call
that a pretty great education.
