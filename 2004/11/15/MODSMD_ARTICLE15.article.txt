## Studying abroad should broaden perspective 
### MING ZHU 
Having just returned from an
amazing study abroad experience. 1
had a few reservations with the
comments made in Julie Park's ar
ticle on "The Surreal World: Life in
Europe" (Nov. 12). I'm the first to
admit that some of her points were

valid — it is hard to go from smoke
free California to smoke-obsessed
Italy — but most of her points
seemed a bit, well, wrong.
First, every part of your Stan
ford career is what you make of it.
If you're staying on the Farm,
soaking in the sun. enjoying every
frat party and doing the bare mini

mum to pass in every class — I'd
call that a $40.(MH) vacation. On the
other hand, if you're going to every
Lively Arts concert, making some
lifelong friends and chatting with
world-famous professors. I'd call
that a pretty great education.
The same is going to be true for
an overseas experience. If you sit

and wait for incredible experiences
to find you... let's just say that
you'll be waiting fora long time.
Then there's the culture shock.
Yes, we're all entitled to it. But
perhaps we should try to be a bit
more understanding when judging

others.
For example, I wonder how
breathtaking Florence's famous
churches would look if the rev
enues from its tourism industry
were taken from its renovation
budget. 1 wonder how John Locke
would react to the knowledge that
enlightenment comes from chang
ing over from hand-washed and
line-dried clothes to electric wash
ers and dryers.
1 wonder if democracy is hurt
more by national bans on preemptive

heating or by secretive surveillance
and invasion of personal privacy in
the name of preemptive defense.
And 1 have to say... if you're
going to go for gloves inside the
house anyhow — it can't hurt to
pair them with a nice matching
scarf.
Plus, I'm not sure if it's fair to
point fingers at Italians as sexists
and racists when a stroll through
any American city will give you the
same experience.
Actually, let's just talk about

Stanford. How many times have
you heard someone say "You're
Chinese? Oh yeah? Wait, wait, ni
hao!" and then sit there grinning
like a Cheshire cat?
I'll admit it. I do it all the time.
Maybe I'm just racist like the Ital
ians, but I'm intensely proud of the
five Russian and Japanese words in
my vocabulary.
In all seriousness, though, I feel
a bit sorry for Park. If this is what
she's getting out of her study
abroad period, then perhaps it
would have been better to stay in
Palo Alto and appreciate Florence
through videos and art books. No
country is going to be perfect. It
would be incredibly boring if it
were: see Pleasantville.
Studying abroad is not just a va

cation away from your studies at
Stanford — it's an opportunity to
branch out and realize that the
world outside of Stanford is differ
ent. It's an opportunity to have new
experiences, meet new people and
learn new things.
It's an opportunity for students
to reach beyond their comfort lev
els. Speak something other than
English, eat something other than
hamburgers and fries and read
something other than Dan Brown.
If you're not ready to do that...
then yeah, I agree. Perhaps study
ing abroad isn't for you.
