# Smoke and Mirrors Aside...
## Obama as a role model 
### 
Barack Obama first became a
household name when he
delivered a thoughtful and
deeply provocative speech
at the Democratic National Conven
tion. proclaiming that "there's not a
liberal America and a conservative
America â€” there's the United States
of America."
The media loved him. Newsweek's
Howard Fineman called Obama "the
best argument for the American
dream that's around in politics." We
often hear about that convention
speech and the fact that Obama, the
son of an impoverished Kenyan man
and a Midwestern white woman, will
be only the third black senator in the
past I (X) years.
However, although we get a
glimpse of the roots and the treetop,
we've missed the trunk completely.
Obama's life and philosophy is
grounded on a passion for civil rights
and racial and economic justice, and
that's why he's a breath of fresh air.
111 his 1995 memoirs " Dreams from
my Father: A Story of Race and In
heritance," Obama describes his con
frontations with racism and the expec
tations of being black while growing
up in I lawaii.
"People were satisfied so long as
you were courteous and smiled and
made no sudden moves," he writes.
His conflict of identity made his
grades fall: he began loitering out on
the basketball courts; and he escaped
reality by smoking marijuana because
"the high... could at least help you
laugh at the world's ongoing lolly and
see through all the hypocrisy and bull
shit and cheap moraiism."
Obama's father left him when he
was two, and his mother feared that if
he didn't go to a good college, he
would become uneducated like his
white revisionist grandfather. He en
rolled in Columbia, where racial ten
sions "flowed freely, not just out on
the streets but in the stalls 0f... bath
rooms as well, where, no matter how
many times the administration tried
to paint them over, the walls re
mained scratched with blunt corre
spondence between niggers and
kikes."
After graduating, Obama became
a community organizer, in debt and
too often dismissed or shunned. He
decided to go to Harvard Law School
to "learn power's currency." where he
became the first black president of the

prestigious Harvard Law Review.
Instead of signing a lucrative con
tract at nearly any firm, he decided to
work fora small civil rights firm in

Chicago, where
he applied the
lessons he
learned at an ear
lier age to creat
ing opportunities
for people other
wise lost in the
discourse of poli
tics.
At times,
Ohama's anec
dotes read like

they come from"The Invisible Man"
or "The Autobiography of Malcolm
X." But they are all recent, and they
are all real.
I write this because Obama is in
spiring largely because he isn't the
usual Washingtonian politician that
depends on being wealthy, well-con
nected and white. His journey did not
begin with his campaign, but it began
by the revelations that hit him at a
young age.
The journey continued in his late
20s when Obama was sitting between
the graves of his father and grandfa
ther in rural Kenya and wept from a
cacophony of emotion. And that jour
ney continues today as he proves to us
that politics is more than just fodder
for editorial columns. Politics is about
life and death, and it serves as a device
for social change.
And Obama is more honest for
recognizing that. He is willing to tell a
group of unionists that "there is no
body in this room who doesn't believe
in free trade," and he is willing to tell a
Jewish group that "with lots of differ
ent interests and points of view, and
they all have to be taken into consider
ation. .. we can't just [automatically]
rally around Sharon."
People support Obama for his au
thenticity. Democratic strategists de
bate about whether he should run for
president in 2012 or 2016. And people
of color believe Obama is a ray of
hope. He is one of us. And as Obama
continues his journey for answers and
meaning, we are equipped with added
inspiration to continue our own.
