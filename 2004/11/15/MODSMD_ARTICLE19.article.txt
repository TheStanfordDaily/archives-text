Going abroad requires preparation
After reading Julie Park's sarcastic
tirade against Europe, one is left won
dering why she went abroad at all ("The
Surreal World: Life in Europe," Nov.
12). If she wants the rest of the world to
he like America, why did she bother to
leave? Rather than seeing everything
she dislikes as "wrong," perhaps it
would be more rewarding to see things
as different and try to understand them
(for example, it's not "unenlightened"
to not use dryers —it's energy efficient).
The real problem here is a failure to
prepare oneself before going abroad.
Other countries are different, and to
not make efforts like informing oneself
about the culture and learning the lan
guage is a recipe for disaster. By choos
ing to reject everything unfamiliar to
her. Park does a disservice to herself.
And in closed-mindedly stereotyping
Europe, she does a disservice to those

thinking of going abroad.

If s alright to bleed for Cardinal
I his coming week. Stanford stu
dents can show their Cardinal pride in
more than one way in anticipation of
the Big Game. Throughout the week.
Stanford students are encouraged to
participate in the Stanford Medical
Blood Center's "Hemo Bowl" event,
which challenges Cal and Stanford
students to donate blood in the name
of friendly competition.
While this is meant to be a fun
event, the need is startling: During the
winter and holiday season, blood do
nations drop significantly, threatening
shortages nationwide. The entire
bl(H)d donation process takes less than
an hour to make a difference: in fact.

blood itself can be separated into three
components, and therefore has the po
tential to positively affect three lives.
Students, faculty, staff and alumni
planning to donate for this event "ded
icate" their blood to the university of
their choice at a blood drive or at a
Red Cross or Stanford Medical blood
collection center via the use of voting
cards. These will be counted at the end
of the Hemo Bowl. Currently, three
blood drives are scheduled for the
coming week: on Monday from 2- 7:30
p.m. at Branner. on Thursday 1-6 p.m.
at Sigma Nu and also on Thursday
12:30-4:30 p.m. at the Bechtel Assem
bly Room. While Cal students will be
chanting, "Get the red out," Stanford
students can be proud to say, "Red is
the color of Life." Best of luck to Car
dinal athletes and blood donors alike.
