# Grad commission must keep focus
## 
### JENNY ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The newly formed Commission
on Graduate Education (CGE) is
charged with addressing specific con
cerns raised by graduate students and
faculty members, such as examining
immigration laws that affect student
demographics. However, the com
mission's primary challenge will be to
maintain a focus on big-picture issues
amidst the great diversity of graduate
programs.
"We have the opportunity to
broaden the graduate curriculum in a
very careful and thoughtful manner,"
said Dean of Research Arthur Bi
enenstock. a commission member. "I
believe our graduate students will
take advantage of the opportunities
that result."
The commission is comprised of
the dean of research, a former chair
of the University Board of Trustees,
graduate students, a staff member,
and faculty representatives from the
seven graduate schools. Charles Hol
loway, professor emeritus at the
Graduate School of Business, will
serve as chair. The commission meets
biweekly and plans to create topic
specific subcommittees.
The commission's work will cul
minate in a report of key findings and
recommendations for the University
President by June 1,2005.
According to Association Vice
President of Strategic Planning

Roberta Katz, "The commission's
work will include gathering a body of
information about Stanford's existing
graduate programs, the expected ca
reer paths of the graduate students,
and the graduate experience in gen
eral at Stanford. Once that informa
tion is gathered, the commission will
offer recommendations that would
allow current programs to change
and evolve."
Many faculty members who will
be involved in the commission's work
have cited the success of the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education
(CUE) as a model.
"Our hope is that the commission
will be at least as successful with re
spect to graduate education as the
CUE work was with respect to under
graduate education." Katz said.
Members of the CGE and others
have already recognized areas of im
provement for graduate education.
Graduate Student Council Chair
Moriah Thomason, who is the sole
graduate student on the commission,
said that she would focus her efforts
on expanding and restructuring edu
cational programs to better suit the
wide range of graduate student
needs.
"Changes should be considerate
of not only excellence in academic
enterprise, but also the quality of life
for graduate students while they are
here." she said. "Students will thrive
when they are happy, healthy and
enriched in their day to day lives.
Stanford has an opportunity in this
commission to address scholarship
and life, both in and outside of the
classroom."
CGE Co-Chair Mark Horowitz,
a professor at the School of Engi
neering, said the University needs
more interdisciplinary classroom
opportunities and research efforts
along the lines of the BioX program
and the Institute for the Environ
ment.
"One unique feature of Stanford
is that it has top departments in all
areas that are co-located on a single
campus," Horowitz said. "Thus we
should be able to leverage the di
versity of excellence to improve all
graduate programs."
Bienenstock observed that the
commission's work would be moti
vated by the fact that many people
with doctoral degrees work in non
university institutions and that
there are research opportunities at
the boundaries of disciplines.
"Schools and departments could
provide graduate courses for stu
dents in other schools and depart
ments," he said. "Recently, for ex
ample, I spent an evening with sev
eral quite successful School of Engi
neering graduates who indicated
that their education would have
been enhanced significantly by a
course that helped them to manage
and motivate people. Such a course
might be provided by the Graduate
School of Business."
Some faculty members said
funding issues should rank among
the primary' concerns of the new
commission.
"We simply do not have enough
fellowships to put together an effec
tive cohort of graduate students,"
said History Prof. James Sheehan,
the chair of the former Commission
on Undergraduate Education
"One of the real challenges will
be stabilizing funding so the univer
sity can maintain the quality of stu
dents needed." said Prof, of Busi
ness and Political Science David
Brady.
Brady stated that the CGE
would need to locate steady sources
of funding, examine immigration
laws to ensure that the "best and
brightest" students attend Stanford
and provide more resources to aca
demic areas that do not have great
commercial appeal.
Fifth-year classics doctoral can
didate Marcus Folch believes the
CGE should focus on intellectual
development and community.
"Who we are as scholars will

have a lot to do with those who in
fluence our research, which is why it
is crucial that the commission ad
dress the kind of intellectual com
munity Stanford wants to foster,"
he said. "This means more than en
couraging lectures and presenta
tions, hut also opening room in the
curriculum for experimenting with
forms of scholarship which are gen
erally not done, such as collabora
tive projects in the humanities."
University Ombuds David
Rasch said that the CGE could also
explore the relationship between
graduate students and their advi
sors.
"Last year the Ombuds Office
opened 40 graduate student cases,"
he said. "About half of these stu
dents reported problems that in
volved their relationship with their
academic advisors. Graduate stu
dents are often reluctant to address
such complaints within their depart
ments because they fear it will neg
atively affect the recommendation
they receive from their advisor."
Members of the CGE, as well as
other faculty members, said they
expect the commission to face dif
ferent challenges than those faced
by the CUE.
"I think the biggest challenge is
really focus." Horowitz said. "The
graduate education program at
Stanford is very diverse, both in
area of specialization and in type of
degree. To be successful we need to
focus on the large issues that affect
graduate education, and not get dis
tracted by important, but more
local issues."
"The CGE will have to find a
way to focus their efforts by finding
themes that cross schools and de
partments as well as common ele
ments to give their task shape and
direction," Sheehan said.
Katz noted that the broad range
of graduate students, from master's
degree candidates in professional
schools to doctoral students, would
make the commission's work some
what complicated.
"An interesting aspect of the
work so far has been to see where
there are similarities and differ
ences in the graduate programs in
all seven of Stanford's schools as
they apply to various degrees," she
said.
Based on his experience with
CUE, Sheehan also said that the
CGE's efforts need to be as trans
parent as possible.
"The commission should seek to
engage the Stanford community
from the start and keep it informed
about its deliberations," he said. "In
an important sense, the process of
discussion and debate is as impor
tant as the product."
Brady, who also served on the
CUE, said the CGE would need to
balance idealism and reality, com
paring what is possible to what is de
sired.
Many are excited by the
prospect of the CGE continuing
Stanford's tradition of leading and
innovative research.
"I look forward to seeing the
commission work to preserve the
best features of traditional scholar
ship, to relate highly specialized re
search to current political and social
dilemmas, and, of course, to engage
in real interdisciplinarity," Folch
said.
"I'm very excited that the com
mission plans to facilitate cross-dis
ciplinary learning by expanding the
opportunities we have outside of
our own schools," said second-year
graduate student Roger Stanley,
who is pursuing both an MBA and
MA in Education at Stanford. "Asa
joint degree candidate immersed in
the culture of two different schools,
1 can think of few things that have
improved the breadth and depth of
my thinking and worldview."
"I hope and expect we will come
up with a set of goals and some first
steps to improve graduate educa
tion," Horowitz said. "Clearly we
are still working on the specifics, but
I can already sense the great interest
in the faculty, administration, and
students to make something hap
pen. This interest convinces me that
great things will happen."
Former GSC Chair Steve Alli
son said he is encouraged by the in
clusion of current GSC Chair Mori
all Thomason on the commission.
"She is in a position to make a
difference like never before," he
said. "I completely agree with her
vision to help President Hennessy
make graduate life and education
the 'legacy' that he leaves to Stan
ford."
