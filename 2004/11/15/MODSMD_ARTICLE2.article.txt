# Grad commission must keep focus
## 
### JENNY ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The newly formed Commission
on Graduate Education (CGE) is
charged with addressing specific con
cerns raised by graduate students and
faculty members, such as examining
immigration laws that affect student
demographics. However, the com
mission's primary challenge will be to
maintain a focus on big-picture issues
amidst the great diversity of graduate
programs.
"We have the opportunity to
broaden the graduate curriculum in a
very careful and thoughtful manner,"
said Dean of Research Arthur Bi
enenstock. a commission member. "I
believe our graduate students will
take advantage of the opportunities
that result."
The commission is comprised of
the dean of research, a former chair
of the University Board of Trustees,
graduate students, a staff member,
and faculty representatives from the
seven graduate schools. Charles Hol
loway, professor emeritus at the
Graduate School of Business, will
serve as chair. The commission meets
biweekly and plans to create topic
specific subcommittees.
The commission's work will cul
minate in a report of key findings and
recommendations for the University
President by June 1,2005.
According to Association Vice
President of Strategic Planning

Roberta Katz, "The commission's
work will include gathering a body of
information about Stanford's existing
graduate programs, the expected ca
reer paths of the graduate students,
and the graduate experience in gen
eral at Stanford. Once that informa
tion is gathered, the commission will
offer recommendations that would
allow current programs to change
and evolve."
Many faculty members who will
be involved in the commission's work
have cited the success of the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education
(CUE) as a model.
"Our hope is that the commission
will be at least as successful with re
spect to graduate education as the
CUE work was with respect to under
graduate education." Katz said.
Members of the CGE and others
have already recognized areas of im
provement for graduate education.
Graduate Student Council Chair
Moriah Thomason, who is the sole
graduate student on the commission,
said that she would focus her efforts
on expanding and restructuring edu
cational programs to better suit the
wide range of graduate student
needs.
"Changes should be considerate
of not only excellence in academic
enterprise, but also the quality of life
for graduate students while they are
here." she said. "Students will thrive
