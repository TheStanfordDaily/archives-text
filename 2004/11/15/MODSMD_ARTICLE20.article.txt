## Women ousted by Broncos in season finale 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's soccer team's
season came to an end yesterday, as the
No. 25 Cardinal (13-6-3, 4-3-2 Pacific-10
Conference) were knocked out of the
College Cup Tournament in the second
round by No. 4 Santa Clara (16-4-2,6-1-0-
West Coast Conference).
The Cardinal and Broncos battled it
out at Buck Shaw Stadium through two
overtimes until forward Tina Estrada
scored to give the Broncos the 1 -0 victory.
The Cardinal had advanced to the sec
ond round after defeating Cal Poly (11-2-
6,5-1-3-Big West Conference) 2-0 on Fri
day.
The second-round loss is especially
frustrating for the Cardinal given that the
Broncos handed them an early exit from
the NCAA Tournament last year as well.

In that contest, the Cardinal were downed
1-0 in the first round at Buck Shaw Stadi
um.
"Santa Clara is a huge rival in the Bay
Area for us," said head coach Paul Rat
cliffe. "We always want to beat them, and
it's tough to lose at the same place."
Coming into tournament play, there
were still lingering concerns about how
well the Cardinal offense would stack up
against the competition. Despite having a
strong defensive unit to keep games close,
the Cardinal had been plagued many
times throughout the regular season by
their inability to put the ball in the net.
Thankfully, scoring goals was not
much of a problem for the Cardinal on
Friday afternoon against Cal Poly, as they
jumped out to an early 2-0 lead and never
looked back. Freshman forward Lizzy
George put her team on the board in the
16th minute of play on a cross from team

mate Shari Summers.
Less than three minutes later, senior
forward Martha West scored the Cardi
nal's second and final goal of the evening
to give her team a 2-0 lead. The play
began when the Mustang defense failed to
clear the ball away from its own net fol
lowing a Cardinal corner kick. West con
verted the Mustang miscue into a Cardi
nal goal by intercepting a poor pass and
firing the ball into the back of the net.
"The entire season the key thing for us
has been to score a goal, because defen
sively we're very organized and we have a
great goalkeeper in Nicole Barnhart,"
Ratcliffe said. "So when we get a goal
early in the game, I think, confidence
wise, it really helps us a tremendous
amount."
The remainder of the game saw an
evenly played match-up between the two
teams, as both the Cardinal and Mustangs

finished with nine shots apiece.
Fortunately, the Cardinal defense re
mained strong, as Barnhart racked up
four saves en route to her 10th shutout of
the season. More importantly, the Cardi
nal defense made Mustang standout
Sharon Day a non-factor, limiting her
shots on goal.
The Cardinal did all of this without
their leading scorer and co-captain Mar
cie Ward, who was sidelined with a bro
ken foot suffered in practice on Wednes
day. With Ward out, the rest of the Cardi
nal offense picked up the slack.
"It really affects the team because
she's such a great player and a great lead
er for the team," Ratcliffe said. "But in
saying that, I think all the team rallied
around each other and around her and
said, 'Hey, we're going to fight that much

harder," and we got a couple of early goals be
cause the energy level was so high."
Before the Cardinal Mustang match-up,
Santa Clara and California went head-to-head
in their first-round game. The Broncos went
into halftime down by a goal, but rallied back in
the second half to grab a 2-1 victory.
This set up the Cardinal and Broncos as the
teams to square off in the second-round game
held on Sunday afternoon. The intensity was
high, as was to be expected, and the two teams
combined for 24 fouls through over 1 (K) min
utes of play.
Despite coming out strong against Cal Poly,

the Cardinal struggled against a strung Bronco
defense. They collected just two shots in the
opening half and spent much of their time play
ing defense in their own zone.
The second half followed in similar fash
ion. with the Broncos out-shooting the Cardi
nal 7-2.
However, the defense remained tough,
keeping the Broncos scoreless through regu
lation play. Barnhart collected three saves in
the first 90 minutes and nabbed one more in
overtime.
After one scoreless overtime session, the
Broncos finally found their break. Estrada

scored the game-winner just 55 seconds into
the second overtime on a pass from teammate
Megan Kakadelas.
The game-winner sent the Cardinal home
and has the Broncos advancing to the third
round, where they will take on top-ranked
North Carolina.
While the season ends on a sour note and
without a national title, the Cardinal remain
pleased with their success this year.
"1 think it was a very respectable season,"
Ratcliffe said. "I can't wait for next season he
cause I think we're going to keep getting better
and better every year."

"1 think it was a very respectable season,"
Ratcliffe said. "I can't wait for next season he
cause I think we're going to keep getting better
and better every year."
The Stanford women's soccer team's
season came to an end yesterday, as the
No. 25 Cardinal (13-6-3, 4-3-2 Pacific-10
Conference) were knocked out of the
College Cup Tournament in the second
round by No. 4 Santa Clara (16-4-2,6-1-0-
West Coast Conference).
The Cardinal and Broncos battled it
out at Buck Shaw Stadium through two
overtimes until forward Tina Estrada
scored to give the Broncos the 1 -0 victory.
The Cardinal had advanced to the sec
ond round after defeating Cal Poly (11-2-
6,5-1-3-Big West Conference) 2-0 on Fri
day.
The second-round loss is especially
frustrating for the Cardinal given that the
Broncos handed them an early exit from
the NCAA Tournament last year as well.

In that contest, the Cardinal were downed
1-0 in the first round at Buck Shaw Stadi
um.
"Santa Clara is a huge rival in the Bay
Area for us," said head coach Paul Rat
cliffe. "We always want to beat them, and
it's tough to lose at the same place."
Coming into tournament play, there
were still lingering concerns about how
well the Cardinal offense would stack up
against the competition. Despite having a
strong defensive unit to keep games close,
the Cardinal had been plagued many
times throughout the regular season by
their inability to put the ball in the net.
Thankfully, scoring goals was not
much of a problem for the Cardinal on
Friday afternoon against Cal Poly, as they
jumped out to an early 2-0 lead and never
looked back. Freshman forward Lizzy
George put her team on the board in the
16th minute of play on a cross from team

mate Shari Summers.
Less than three minutes later, senior
forward Martha West scored the Cardi
nal's second and final goal of the evening
to give her team a 2-0 lead. The play
began when the Mustang defense failed to
clear the ball away from its own net fol
lowing a Cardinal corner kick. West con
verted the Mustang miscue into a Cardi
nal goal by intercepting a poor pass and
firing the ball into the back of the net.
"The entire season the key thing for us
has been to score a goal, because defen
sively we're very organized and we have a
great goalkeeper in Nicole Barnhart,"
Ratcliffe said. "So when we get a goal
early in the game, I think, confidence
wise, it really helps us a tremendous
amount."
The remainder of the game saw an
evenly played match-up between the two
teams, as both the Cardinal and Mustangs

finished with nine shots apiece.
Fortunately, the Cardinal defense re
mained strong, as Barnhart racked up
four saves en route to her 10th shutout of
the season. More importantly, the Cardi
nal defense made Mustang standout
Sharon Day a non-factor, limiting her
shots on goal.
The Cardinal did all of this without
their leading scorer and co-captain Mar
cie Ward, who was sidelined with a bro
ken foot suffered in practice on Wednes
day. With Ward out, the rest of the Cardi
nal offense picked up the slack.
"It really affects the team because
she's such a great player and a great lead
er for the team," Ratcliffe said. "But in
saying that, I think all the team rallied
around each other and around her and
said, 'Hey, we're going to fight that much

harder," and we got a couple of early goals be
cause the energy level was so high."
Before the Cardinal Mustang match-up,
Santa Clara and California went head-to-head
in their first-round game. The Broncos went
into halftime down by a goal, but rallied back in
the second half to grab a 2-1 victory.
This set up the Cardinal and Broncos as the
teams to square off in the second-round game
held on Sunday afternoon. The intensity was
high, as was to be expected, and the two teams
combined for 24 fouls through over 1 (K) min
utes of play.
Despite coming out strong against Cal Poly,

the Cardinal struggled against a strung Bronco
defense. They collected just two shots in the
opening half and spent much of their time play
ing defense in their own zone.
The second half followed in similar fash
ion. with the Broncos out-shooting the Cardi
nal 7-2.
However, the defense remained tough,
keeping the Broncos scoreless through regu
lation play. Barnhart collected three saves in
the first 90 minutes and nabbed one more in
overtime.
After one scoreless overtime session, the
Broncos finally found their break. Estrada

scored the game-winner just 55 seconds into
the second overtime on a pass from teammate
Megan Kakadelas.
The game-winner sent the Cardinal home
and has the Broncos advancing to the third
round, where they will take on top-ranked
North Carolina.
While the season ends on a sour note and
without a national title, the Cardinal remain
pleased with their success this year.
