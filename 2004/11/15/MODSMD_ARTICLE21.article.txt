# Too little, too late for Card

### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford didn't quit Saturday at Stan
ford Stadium, fighting back from a three
point, 65-yard first-half performance to
outscore Oregon State by 13 points in the
second half. The Cardinal made it close,
but this game, like each of their last four,
ended in disappointment.
Stanford had the ball, down five, with
1:18 remaining and 77 yards to go fora
winning touchdown, but T.C Ostrander's
first pass of the drive was intercepted by
Keith Ellison. With the 24-19 loss, the
Cardinal fell to 4-6 on the season (2-5 Pa
cific-10 Conference) with only Big Game
remaining.
"It seems to be the same old pattern this
year," said Greg Camarillo, one of 11 se
niors playing his final home game. "When
you have the offense on the field with a
minute and 30 seconds left, that's what you
want."
Stanford's second-half comeback ef
fort failed largely because of its lethargic
first half, in which the Beavers mounted
touchdown drives of 34, 74 and 70 yards
while each of the Cardinal's eight posses
sions ended in either a punt or a field-goal
attempt.
"We played very poorly in the first half
offensively," head coach Buddy Teevens
said. "Nothing worked. We didn't run the
ball. We didn't throw the ball."
At halftime, Ostrander — who made his
first career start in place of an injured Trent
Edwards — was 6-of-16 passing for 52
yards, Kenneth Tolon led the team with 19
yards rushing on six carries and Michael
Sgroi had missed two field goals.
Meanwhile, Derek Anderson was 15-of
-21 for 211 yards and three touchdowns for
Oregon State, which also had 57 rushing
yards on 13 carries by Dwight Wright.
It was not a pretty picture, but the Car
dinal came to play in the second half,
outscoring the Beavers 16-3.
"I challenged the guys at the half, and
offensively, we made drastic adjustments,"
Teevens said. "I point to the way the se
niors responded. We made it a ballgame,
but unfortunately we came up short in the
end."
Ostrander was 11-of-29 in the second
half for 197 yards, as the Cardinal ran only
eight times in the second halt and finished
the contest with 21 rushes for one yard.
"[The Beavers] defended the run really
well," Teevens said. "We tried it a number
