# Too little, too late for Card
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford didn't quit Saturday at Stan
ford Stadium, fighting back from a three
point, 65-yard first-half performance to
outscore Oregon State by 13 points in the
second half. The Cardinal made it close,
but this game, like each of their last four,
ended in disappointment.
Stanford had the ball, down five, with
1:18 remaining and 77 yards to go fora
winning touchdown, but T.C Ostrander's
first pass of the drive was intercepted by
Keith Ellison. With the 24-19 loss, the
Cardinal fell to 4-6 on the season (2-5 Pa
cific-10 Conference) with only Big Game
remaining.
"It seems to be the same old pattern this
year," said Greg Camarillo, one of 11 se
niors playing his final home game. "When
you have the offense on the field with a
minute and 30 seconds left, that's what you
want."
Stanford's second-half comeback ef
fort failed largely because of its lethargic
first half, in which the Beavers mounted
touchdown drives of 34, 74 and 70 yards
while each of the Cardinal's eight posses
sions ended in either a punt or a field-goal
attempt.
"We played very poorly in the first half
offensively," head coach Buddy Teevens
said. "Nothing worked. We didn't run the
ball. We didn't throw the ball."
At halftime, Ostrander — who made his
first career start in place of an injured Trent
Edwards — was 6-of-16 passing for 52
yards, Kenneth Tolon led the team with 19
yards rushing on six carries and Michael
Sgroi had missed two field goals.
Meanwhile, Derek Anderson was 15-of
-21 for 211 yards and three touchdowns for
Oregon State, which also had 57 rushing
yards on 13 carries by Dwight Wright.
It was not a pretty picture, but the Car
dinal came to play in the second half,
outscoring the Beavers 16-3.
"I challenged the guys at the half, and
offensively, we made drastic adjustments,"
Teevens said. "I point to the way the se
niors responded. We made it a ballgame,
but unfortunately we came up short in the
end."
Ostrander was 11-of-29 in the second
half for 197 yards, as the Cardinal ran only
eight times in the second halt and finished
the contest with 21 rushes for one yard.
"[The Beavers] defended the run really
well," Teevens said. "We tried it a number
of times in the first half without suc
cess ... and that was not sufficient,
so we kind of abandoned it in the
second half."
But the passing game was giving
the offense some shots into the end
zone, and Ostrander and the wide
receivers kept working.
"In the second half, we made
some adjustments," Ostrander said.
"I felt the rhythm in the second half
and they weren't doing anything to
stop us."
With the short game not work
ing, the Cardinal chose to take their
chances downfield. Evan Moore
chased deep ball after deep ball, fin
ishing with four catches for 78
yards, including a 41-yard touch
down that pulled Stanford within
two points with 7:12 remaining in
the game. Ostrander's passing at
tempt for the tying two-point con
version glanced off Moore's finger
tips, leaving Stanford down. 21-19.
The Beavers followed with a 13-
play, 64-yard field-goal drive that
left Stanford with a long field and a
short clock, and when Ostrander's
final pass was intercepted, it lifted
the Beavers to 5-5 (4-3).
The Cardinal's loss was all the
more frustrating because of all the
missed chances they had. Sgroi
missed three field goals in total, and
the offense went for it — and failed
to convert — on fourth-and-goal on
its first two possessions of the sec
ond half. In the first half. Stanford
had two first-and-goals but man
aged only one field goal.
Stanford doesn't like to play
"what if," but there were an awful lot
of what-ifs on Saturday. Teevens de
fended the decisions to go for it on
fourth-and-goal, as did Ostrander.
"It was about field position and
an emotional surge," Teevens said.
"Knowing if we didn't convert, their
play selection would be affected [by
being backed up on the goal line], I
felt comfortable trying to get seven

[points] instead of three."
The Beavers were just happy to
escape with a win. giving them a
chance to achieve bowl eligibility
with a win over Oregon in the Civil
War next Saturday.
"We came out in the second half
and did nothing fora long time,"
head coach Mike Riley said. "I'll
give [Stanford] credit... their team
fights hard. They are a much-im
proved team."
Stanford's first-half points came
after Oshiomogho Atogwe inter
cepted Anderson on the first play of
the game and returned it 28 yards to
the Beavers' eight-yard line. Sgroi
connected on a 24-yard field goal.
The Beavers scored their first
touchdown on a well-executed
screen pass that featured a fake
end-around. Wright had four block
ers and only one defender to beat
on his 43-yard touchdown reception
as a result of the misdirection.
Early in the second period, the
Beavers put together a well-execut
ed 10-play, 74-yard drive that culmi
nated in a 13-yard touchdown loss
from Anderson to Pac-10 receiving
leader Mike Hass. With 1:33 left in
the half, Anderson's six-yard throw
over three Stanford defenders to 6-
foot-7 Joe Newton put the Beavers
up 21-3.
Stanford responded with what
looked to be a 51-yard touchdown
from Ostrander to Moore, but it
was called back on a holding penal
ty. The Beavers committed two 15-
yard penalties to move the Cardinal
into scoring range nonetheless, but
Sgroi missed a 31-yarder with 0:25
remaining.
The Beavers wouldn't score
again until Alexis Serna connected
from 36 yards with 1:23 remaining,
but Stanford was busy in the second
half.
After a 62-yard punt return by
David Marrero, Mark Bradford
caught a 15-yard touchdown, his

Stanford looking to
break Big Game streak

first of the year, with 6:48 left in the
third quarter to make it 21-13. On
the previous Stanford possession,
Sgroi had converted a career-best
50-yard field goal.
Oregon State totaled just 139
yards of offense in the second half,
but the Stanford defense wasn't
pleased with its overall effort. An
derson finished 29-of-42 for 334
yards, Hass caught eight balls for
110 yards and Anthony Wheat-
Brown had 11 receptions for 117
yards.
"We gave up 21 points in the first
half, and I don't even know the last
time we've done that," Atogwe
said. "The way we played in the sec
ond half is the way we're capable of
playing the whole game."
Atogwe had two of the Cardi
nal's four interceptions and finished
with 14 tackles. Jon Alston had his
first career pick and Jared Newber
ry had his first interception of the
season.
"Basically, we knew just from
watching film that they like to
throw a lot of outs on the far side,
and we were just trying to get un
derneath the deep out." Atogwe ex
plained.
Now, Stanford has only one
game remaining, and it's against
arch-rival California — which also
happens to be the No. 5 team in the
country.
"We've got a one-game season,
and that's it," Teevens said. "The
goals, they're all behind us now, and
it's just Big Game. It's our last one."
The Cardinal, which has lost
four consecutive games, wants to go
out on a high note.
"Sometimes, you just feel like
you're being tested from above,"
Alston said. "We've been in this po
sition over and over and over again
this year. But we can prove some
thing to ourselves by coming back
next week and bringing the Axe
back to Stanford."
