That just about does it for the Cardinal.
After Saturday's 24-19 loss to the
Oregon State Beavers, Stanford's hopes
of earning a bowl bid are gone, as are
their chances of a winning season. Of
course, there is still a chance fora huge
upset next week against Cal, but it could
be another 4-7 season for the Cardinal.
Stanford had its share of chances, but
four straight losses ended all thoughts of
a postseason berth. Each Saturday for
the past four weeks, the Cardinal have
found a new way to lose.
Four weeks ago against Oregon, it
was a defensive struggle in the rain, with

a game-tying field goal falling just short
for the Cardinal.
At the Rose Bowl against UCLA it
was a blowout loss; Stanford was never
in the game, losing 21-0.
Last week, Arizona State rallied from
down five points with a little over two
minutes left, to score the winning touch
down with nine seconds to go.
This week, it was a game where the
Cardinal had repeated chances to come
back from an early 21-3 deficit, but just
couldn't seem to put points on the score
board when it counted.
It was a comedy of errors for the Car
dinal offensively. Between questionable
coaching decisions, missed field goals,
penalties and an overall inability to

score, Stanford couldn't come back
against an Oregon State team that was
practically begging for the Cardinal to
get back in the game.
Stanford had the ball inside the 20
five times in the game and managed only
two scores â€” a touchdown and a field
goal. The squad had first-and-goal inside
the 10 four times, and each time failed to
get into the endzone.
"Offensively we have to be oppor
tunistic," Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens said. "We had an opportunity
to stick the ball after the first pick and we
don't finish off and end up with a field
goal. We missed a field goal on the next

The Stanford defense had a typically strong performance in the second half, but Oregon State built what turned out to be an in
surmountable lead early in the game. The Cardinal's fourth straight loss leaves them heading to Cal with a 4-6 record.
