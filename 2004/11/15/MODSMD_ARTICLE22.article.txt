# Second-half comeback again falls short

That just about does it for the Cardinal.
After Saturday's 24-19 loss to the
Oregon State Beavers, Stanford's hopes
of earning a bowl bid are gone, as are
their chances of a winning season. Of
course, there is still a chance fora huge
upset next week against Cal, but it could
be another 4-7 season for the Cardinal.
Stanford had its share of chances, but
four straight losses ended all thoughts of
a postseason berth. Each Saturday for
the past four weeks, the Cardinal have
found a new way to lose.
Four weeks ago against Oregon, it
was a defensive struggle in the rain, with

a game-tying field goal falling just short
for the Cardinal.
At the Rose Bowl against UCLA it
was a blowout loss; Stanford was never
in the game, losing 21-0.
Last week, Arizona State rallied from
down five points with a little over two
minutes left, to score the winning touch
down with nine seconds to go.
This week, it was a game where the
Cardinal had repeated chances to come
back from an early 21-3 deficit, but just
couldn't seem to put points on the score
board when it counted.
It was a comedy of errors for the Car
dinal offensively. Between questionable
coaching decisions, missed field goals,
penalties and an overall inability to

score, Stanford couldn't come back
against an Oregon State team that was
practically begging for the Cardinal to
get back in the game.
Stanford had the ball inside the 20
five times in the game and managed only
two scores — a touchdown and a field
goal. The squad had first-and-goal inside
the 10 four times, and each time failed to
get into the endzone.
"Offensively we have to be oppor
tunistic," Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens said. "We had an opportunity
to stick the ball after the first pick and we
don't finish off and end up with a field
goal. We missed a field goal on the next

The Stanford defense had a typically strong performance in the second half, but Oregon State built what turned out to be an in
surmountable lead early in the game. The Cardinal's fourth straight loss leaves them heading to Cal with a 4-6 record.
opportunity. When you're down
there close enough you have to
make plays."
Stanford's defense again was a
huge factor in keeping the Cardinal
in the game. The Cardinal inter
cepted Oregon State quarterback
Derek Anderson four times, each
time giving the offense the hall in
side the Beaver 40-yard line. And
yet, the Cardinal only scored 10
points off turnovers.
Kicker Michael Sgroi struggled
on the afternoon, making only two
of his five field goal attempts. Sgroi,
who has been strong since early in
the season, made a career-high 50-
yard attempt, but also missed a 31-
yard chip shot at the end of the sec
ond quarter.
Sgroi's struggles may have con
tributed to the coaching staff's deci
sion to go for it on fourth-and-goal
on two straight drives to open up
the second half.
On the first possession of the
second half, with the Cardinal
trailing 21-3, Marcus McCutcheon
fielded a short kickoff from Ore
gon State and ran the ball to mid
field. After a 41-yard pass from
redshirt freshman quarterback
T.C. Ostrander to flanker Evan
Moore, the Cardinal had first-and
goal just inside the nine-yard line.
A six-yard loss on a Kenneth
Tolon rush and two incompletions
left the Cardinal with fourth-and
goal from the 15-yard line. Stan
ford decided to go for it, and Os
trander's pass to Moore fell incom
plete.
One drive later, following a Osh
iomogho Atogwe interception, the
Cardinal again moved the ball with
in the 10-yard line, again went for it
on fourth-and-goal, and again
failed.
A drive later the Cardinal again
faced another third-and-long well
within Oregon State territory. This
time they went fora field goal,
which Michael Sgroi hit from 50
yards out.
Had Teevens taken short field
goal attempts both times earlier in
the half, the Cardinal likely would
have had a better shot at winning
the game.

"I thought they were good deci
sions," Ostrander said. "Their de
fense wasn't stopping us; we had
problems. We were making minor
mistakes. There comes a point
where everyone has to step up and
take responsibility for their jobs
and get it done. We all wanted it.
We all wanted the ball in our hands
on fourth down. I have no problem
with those calls; 1 like those calls."
Penalties also kept the Cardinal
out of the end zone. On the last
drive of the second half, a terrific
51-yard pass from Ostrander to
Moore that would have been a
touchdown was called back because
of a holding penalty. The Cardinal
won the penalty battle, with only six
for 63 yards to the Beavers' 10 for
93 yards, but Stanford's were cer-

Even when things went right for
the Cardinal, things went wrong.
After a Mark Bradford touchdown
reception cut the Beaver's lead to
21-12, a 15-yard celebration penalty
kept the Cardinal from going for
two, and they were forced to take a
long extra-point try.
With the loss, the Cardinal are

tention. but the season isn't over.
A win next week against Cal
could be one of the biggest upsets in
Big Game history and would end
the Bears' Rose Bowl hopes. A loss
would mean a second straight 4-7
campaign for the Cardinal.
If that happens, it may be time to
step back and evaluate how a
promising 4-2 start went to waste.

Stanford had its share of chances, but
four straight losses ended all thoughts of
a postseason berth. Each Saturday for
the past four weeks, the Cardinal have
found a new way to lose.
Four weeks ago against Oregon, it
was a defensive struggle in the rain, with

a game-tying field goal falling just short
for the Cardinal.
At the Rose Bowl against UCLA it
was a blowout loss; Stanford was never
in the game, losing 21-0.
Last week, Arizona State rallied from
down five points with a little over two
minutes left, to score the winning touch
down with nine seconds to go.
This week, it was a game where the
Cardinal had repeated chances to come
back from an early 21-3 deficit, but just
couldn't seem to put points on the score
board when it counted.
It was a comedy of errors for the Car
dinal offensively. Between questionable
coaching decisions, missed field goals,
penalties and an overall inability to

score, Stanford couldn't come back
against an Oregon State team that was
practically begging for the Cardinal to
get back in the game.
Stanford had the ball inside the 20
five times in the game and managed only
two scores — a touchdown and a field
goal. The squad had first-and-goal inside
the 10 four times, and each time failed to
get into the endzone.
"Offensively we have to be oppor
tunistic," Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens said. "We had an opportunity
to stick the ball after the first pick and we
don't finish off and end up with a field
goal. We missed a field goal on the next

The Stanford defense had a typically strong performance in the second half, but Oregon State built what turned out to be an in
surmountable lead early in the game. The Cardinal's fourth straight loss leaves them heading to Cal with a 4-6 record.
opportunity. When you're down
there close enough you have to
make plays."
Stanford's defense again was a
huge factor in keeping the Cardinal
in the game. The Cardinal inter
cepted Oregon State quarterback
Derek Anderson four times, each
time giving the offense the hall in
side the Beaver 40-yard line. And
yet, the Cardinal only scored 10
points off turnovers.
Kicker Michael Sgroi struggled
on the afternoon, making only two
of his five field goal attempts. Sgroi,
who has been strong since early in
the season, made a career-high 50-
yard attempt, but also missed a 31-
yard chip shot at the end of the sec
ond quarter.
Sgroi's struggles may have con
tributed to the coaching staff's deci
sion to go for it on fourth-and-goal
on two straight drives to open up
the second half.
On the first possession of the
second half, with the Cardinal
trailing 21-3, Marcus McCutcheon
fielded a short kickoff from Ore
gon State and ran the ball to mid
field. After a 41-yard pass from
redshirt freshman quarterback
T.C. Ostrander to flanker Evan
Moore, the Cardinal had first-and
goal just inside the nine-yard line.
A six-yard loss on a Kenneth
Tolon rush and two incompletions
left the Cardinal with fourth-and
goal from the 15-yard line. Stan
ford decided to go for it, and Os
trander's pass to Moore fell incom
plete.
One drive later, following a Osh
iomogho Atogwe interception, the
Cardinal again moved the ball with
in the 10-yard line, again went for it
on fourth-and-goal, and again
failed.
A drive later the Cardinal again
faced another third-and-long well
within Oregon State territory. This
time they went fora field goal,
which Michael Sgroi hit from 50
yards out.
Had Teevens taken short field
goal attempts both times earlier in
the half, the Cardinal likely would
have had a better shot at winning
the game.

"I thought they were good deci
sions," Ostrander said. "Their de
fense wasn't stopping us; we had
problems. We were making minor
mistakes. There comes a point
where everyone has to step up and
take responsibility for their jobs
and get it done. We all wanted it.
We all wanted the ball in our hands
on fourth down. I have no problem
with those calls; 1 like those calls."
Penalties also kept the Cardinal
out of the end zone. On the last
drive of the second half, a terrific
51-yard pass from Ostrander to
Moore that would have been a
touchdown was called back because
of a holding penalty. The Cardinal
won the penalty battle, with only six
for 63 yards to the Beavers' 10 for
93 yards, but Stanford's were cer-

tainly more costly.
Even when things went right for
the Cardinal, things went wrong.
After a Mark Bradford touchdown
reception cut the Beaver's lead to
21-12, a 15-yard celebration penalty
kept the Cardinal from going for
two, and they were forced to take a
long extra-point try.
With the loss, the Cardinal are
officially knocked out of bowl con
tention. but the season isn't over.
A win next week against Cal
could be one of the biggest upsets in
Big Game history and would end
the Bears' Rose Bowl hopes. A loss
would mean a second straight 4-7
campaign for the Cardinal.
If that happens, it may be time to
step back and evaluate how a
promising 4-2 start went to waste.

The Cardinal contained the Beavers' Dwight Wright on the ground, but he
caught a first-half touchdown pass as OSU outgained Stanford 370-248.
That just about does it for the Cardinal.
After Saturday's 24-19 loss to the
Oregon State Beavers, Stanford's hopes
of earning a bowl bid are gone, as are
their chances of a winning season. Of
