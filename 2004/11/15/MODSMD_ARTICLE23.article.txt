# Women sweep through hapless Oregon schools

### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In typically dominating fashion, the
No. 11 Stanford Cardinal women's volley
hall team (19-6, 11-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) rolled through Pacific-10 Confer
ence bottom-dwellers Oregon and Ore
gon State this weekend.
With the victories, the Cardinal kept
pace with No. 6 Southern California,
which was able to eke out a five-game vic
tory over cross-town rival No. 16 UCLA
this past weekend. The Cardinal and
Women of Troy are tied for second in the
Pac-10, three games behind top-ranked
Washington, which remains undefeated
on the season.
Not only did the Cardinal win this
weekend, but they did so in highly con
vincing style, not dropping a single game
to either Oregon (9-16, 1-14) or Oregon
State (10-4.4-11).
Stanford continued its historical domi

nance of Oregon State on Friday night,
defeating the Beavers for the 38th straight
time. For the record, the two teams have
only played 38 times.
Oregon State came out of the blocks
solidly, scoring the first five points of the
match before the Cardinal were on the
board. Stanford rallied to take the lead 15-
13 heading into the media timeout. The
Cardinal rolled on to a 30-21 victory,
reaching game point on a service ace by
junior libero Courtney Schultz and clos
ing out on a solo block by Nnamani.
The Beavers started the second game
strongly, leading 5-2 early. Stanford tied
the game at 14 and the teams battled back
and forth until Stanford got a game point
at 29-26 after a ball-handling error by
Oregon State. Nnamani shut the door
with a kill to take the game 30-27.
The only dark spot in an otherwise
bright weekend for the Cardinal was

Ogonna Nnamani and the Stanford women s
volleyball team picked up two victories on the
road over the weekend in convincing fashion.
when Richards went down with an ankle sprain in
the middle of game two.
That was the closest the Beavers would get, as
they were unable to halt the tide of the Cardinal at
tack in game three. Stanford mounted a match-high
21 kills, slamming the Oregon State defense with a
hitting percentage over .500. Back-to-back kills by
Nnamani gave her 23 on the night and gave the Car
dinal the game. 30-20, and the match, 3-0.
Nnamani s performance was the 53rd consecu
tive match in which she has achieved double digits
in kills. In addition to dominating on the court,
Nnamani has recently been named to the Academ
ic All-District First Team.
Stanford will next see action against the unde
feated Washington Huskies on Thursday night at 7
p.m. The Washington State Cougars will visit Fri
day night, also at 7 p.m. Both games will be at Burn
ham Pavilion.
