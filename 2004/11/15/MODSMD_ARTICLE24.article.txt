## Gather 'round for the saga of 'Gametime' 
### 
People constantly ask me who I live with.
And, although 1 live with NCAA Cham
pion Don Sage and Chemical-Engineer
ing all-star Russ Martin, people are far more
interested in my third roommate: "Gametime"
Robert Smitson.
For those in the know, Gametime Smitson
terrorized Indiana AAU Basketball from ap
proximately 1994-19%. I've seen the great In-

r" j
diana schoolboys play —
I've seen Steve Alford,
Damon Bailey, and Jimmy
Chitwood. And without a
doubt, based solely on Ga
metime's statistics and sto
ries that he has relayed to me
over the two-plus years that
I've known him at Stanford,
there's no way in hell Game
time could compare to any of
those Indiana legends.

But rest assured, dear reader, Gametime
was definitely an above-average AAU Indiana
basketball star. Surely you jest, Neil. You're
writing an article about a kid who hasn't
played competitive basketball since 9th grade?
Yes; yes I am.
Granted, I was never present fora Game
time performance, but hopefully through this
article, his legacy will live on. Through a series
of fact-or-fiction statements, let me attempt to
demystify the un-demystifiable.
Fact or Fiction: 1. He once scored 76 points
in one game.
Actually, this statement is utter fiction.
While the offense may have run through him,
and Gametime might have dropped a double
Jordan (46 points) in a 1995 season in which he
averaged 24.5 ppg. he certainly never scored
76 points in a game. To quote Smitson: "What
can I say, I was the MBP (most ballin'est play
er) during that season. Just call me the
Mayor."
2. He competed against child prodigy Chris
Thomas, in a 7th Grade A'AU tournament.
This statement has been validated by Ga
metime's coach, who in an attempt to rally the
troops, told his players that "we might not
have the best team in the tournament; but, we
have the best player." Gametime vs. Chris
Thomas? A match-up made in Heaven.
3. He gave up basketball because he real
ized that running track was a more lucrative

career choice.
Actually, that's not quite true.
Here's what high school legend Gerry
Lindgren has to say about running: "1
was a social outcast with no friends or
girls to chase around, so I ran a lot."
(Author's note: I also run, and enjoy
the social aspects of running).
Honestly, had I been his agent dur
ing this time period, I would have ad
vised him to forgo his high school eli
gibility and enter the NBA draft.
According to his high school
coach, on an AAU team that would
later produce three NCAA Division I
athletes, Gametime was a sure college
prospect. With his unique blend of
leadership, hustle, court vision, scor
ing ability, and jump shot, Gametime
had all the skills of an above-average
Indiana AAU basketball player.
Next, I would have brokered a
deal with the Warriors by explaining
the greatness of Gametime, at which
point 1 would also have had Game
time sign an endorsement deal with
Cummins Inc.
And let's look at top Warriors
draft picks without my guidance: Jeff
Foster? Todd Fuller? Clifford Rozi
er? The first Latvian player ever?
But, like past Warriors draft picks,
Gametime missed. And he missed
hard. So what happened?
Well, for starters, he refused to
grow. Point at Muggsy Bogues all you
want, but the NBA has an unwritten
rule — you're either 5' and under, or
you're at least 6'4".
Next, blame it on his whiteness,
but Gametime was never very athlet
ic. Sure his jumper was beautiful, and
he could set back screens until the
cows came home (they never did), but
in a period where style rules over sub
stance, Gametime's inability to get
rim cost him a shot at the NBA.
Somehow the league didn't have a
place fora 5'2", 1051b corn-fed white
boy. And finally, much like a young
Ron Artest, Gametime made a life-al
tering decision — he asked his middle
school coach fora month off in order
to pursue a burgeoning rap career
(wait, did Artest actually do this? You
cannot be serious).
Unlike Pacers coach Rick Carlisle,
Gametime's coach, hardened by

Smitson: AAU
Hoosier legend

years of coaching middle schoolers,
refused his request and permanently
booted him off the team.
So the last statement might he a
possible myth, but had Gametime hy
pothetically wanted to release a rap
album in Bth grade, I don't think his
coach would have looked kindly upon
this request.
So what's left of this former child
star?
In order to answer this question,
let me pose a question of my own: Re
member the 2001 VMA's. when Axl
Rose (another fine Indiana product)
appeared on stage in a Rich Gannon
Raiders jersey? Well, it happened,
trust me. The point of this allegory is
that although people want to see the
return of Guns n' Roses (only their
original lineup, please ... or at least
give me Chinese Democracy), when
Axl came back dressed for success he
flopped.
Axl Rose was a bloated, braided,
Gannon-jersey-wearing, horrible-vo
calist reincarnation of his former im
mortal self. You tell me Axl could
never sing? I'll tell you that Axl
wailed.
And thus, bringing this story to the
proper ending point, imagine if Ga
metime Smitson inflated his Reebok
Pumps, and put on a Lil' Penny jersey
today (Orlando Magic only). I would
recognize his past glory, but I would
also realize that his years of AAU
dominance have passed him by.
For the sake of Willie Mays and all
the memories of him struggling with
the Mets, I've advised Gametime to
give up on his dreams of NBA star
dom.
And yet, with a heart larger than
that of a deceased racehorse. Game
time refuses to lose. Can't nobody
keep him down. Oh no. he's got to
keep on moving. So the next time you
see him in the gym. draining trifectas,
remember what time it is and always
will be: Gametime.
