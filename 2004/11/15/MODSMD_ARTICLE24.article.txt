## Gather 'round for the saga of 'Gametime' 
### 
People constantly ask me who I live with.
And, although 1 live with NCAA Cham
pion Don Sage and Chemical-Engineer
ing all-star Russ Martin, people are far more
interested in my third roommate: "Gametime"
Robert Smitson.
For those in the know, Gametime Smitson
terrorized Indiana AAU Basketball from ap
proximately 1994-19%. I've seen the great In-

r" j
diana schoolboys play â€”
I've seen Steve Alford,
Damon Bailey, and Jimmy
Chitwood. And without a
doubt, based solely on Ga
metime's statistics and sto
ries that he has relayed to me
over the two-plus years that
I've known him at Stanford,
there's no way in hell Game
time could compare to any of
those Indiana legends.

But rest assured, dear reader, Gametime
was definitely an above-average AAU Indiana
basketball star. Surely you jest, Neil. You're
writing an article about a kid who hasn't
played competitive basketball since 9th grade?
Yes; yes I am.
Granted, I was never present fora Game
time performance, but hopefully through this
article, his legacy will live on. Through a series
of fact-or-fiction statements, let me attempt to
demystify the un-demystifiable.
Fact or Fiction: 1. He once scored 76 points
in one game.
Actually, this statement is utter fiction.
While the offense may have run through him,
and Gametime might have dropped a double
Jordan (46 points) in a 1995 season in which he
averaged 24.5 ppg. he certainly never scored
76 points in a game. To quote Smitson: "What
can I say, I was the MBP (most ballin'est play
er) during that season. Just call me the
Mayor."
2. He competed against child prodigy Chris
Thomas, in a 7th Grade A'AU tournament.
This statement has been validated by Ga
metime's coach, who in an attempt to rally the
troops, told his players that "we might not
have the best team in the tournament; but, we
have the best player." Gametime vs. Chris
Thomas? A match-up made in Heaven.
3. He gave up basketball because he real
ized that running track was a more lucrative
