# Water polo capitalizes on inexperienced Cal defense

### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Twenty-five minutes of superfluous play.
Three minutes into the first period of Satur
day's water polo match, the Cardinal's last
regular-season home win was wrapped up.
Yet another early lead by the No. 2 Stanford
men's water polo team (19-3, 7-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) in the first period

Azevedo, a two-time Olympian and
three-time Player of the Year, made things

a ball over the Bears' goalie for one score
and then stealing and driving the ball down
the pool for another. An unstoppable
