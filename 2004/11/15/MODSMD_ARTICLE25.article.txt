# Water polo capitalizes on inexperienced Cal defense
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Twenty-five minutes of superfluous play.
Three minutes into the first period of Satur
day's water polo match, the Cardinal's last
regular-season home win was wrapped up.
Yet another early lead by the No. 2 Stanford
men's water polo team (19-3, 7-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) in the first period
defined the game, as the Cardinal proceeded
to dominate No. 4 California for three more
periods on their way to a 12-7 MPSF victory.
The tilt had hardly gotten underway when
the Cardinal knew who was going to win.
Stanford opened up play on a six-on-five of
fense. The ball went from senior driver Tony
Azevedo's hands to sophomore driver J.J.
Garton, who in turn passed to junior driver
Thomas Hopkins. With a shot that bounced
around inside the left corner of the goal, the
Cardinal took a 1-0 lead.
A few minutes later Hopkins found the
goal again and Stanford held an unusually

commanding 2-0 lead.
"I've always been told, at the beginning of
the game, feel free to take a few shots, be
cause goalies aren't ready and defenses
aren't ready," Hopkins said.
And even though California's sophomore
star John Mann (56 goals) scored soon after
ward with a shot that skipped past Stanford
junior goalkeeper Chad Taylor, the Cardinal
didn't worry.
"When Hopkins put away those first two
shots, I think that really sealed the game,"'
Azevedo said. "Even though when it was a
2-0, and later 2-1, [which] isn't as big a lead. I
think that just showed right off the bat it's
going to be extremely hard to beat us."
Azevedo, a two-time Olympian and
three-time Player of the Year, made things
even harder for the young Cal squad, lobbing
a ball over the Bears' goalie for one score
and then stealing and driving the ball down
the pool for another. An unstoppable
Azevedo ended his game with six
goals for Stanford.
"I really felt on fire today."
Azevedo said. "I knew that if 1 shot
it. there would be a good chance of it
going in."
Cal followed up with a goal of its
own, but sophomore driver Tyler
Drake ended the first period with a
goal that seemed to come too easily,
putting Stanford up 5-2.
Defense marked the second
quarter; Taylor came out of the goal
to pull balls in and the rest of the
Cardinal provided plenty of steals.
Cal managed only one goal on a
man-up advantage while Stanford
added two more to build a 7-3 lead.
The Cardinal shut the door on their

longtime rivals in the second half.
Tempers flared and Cal's assis
tant coach was ejected from the
game, but that failed to energize a
deflated Bears squad.
Azevedo put on the finishing
touches by scoring three more goals,
including a backhand shot and a lob
way outside the seven-meter line
that tlew high over the head of Cal
goalkeeper Nate Bennett.
"A lot of times people are so
afraid of me coming off with a hard
shot near side that if 1 just throw it,
kind of a lob. the goalies won't be
ready for it," Azevedo said.
The Bears scored twice in the
fourth quarter, but by then there was
little to be done to get back into the

game.
Cal's young team —there are
only two juniors and one senior, and
no one on the squad has more than
two years of varsity experience —
has played well this season, but the
loss to Stanford points out a few
things the Bears still need to work on.
"A lot of times 1 feel they had a
couple wrong match-ups," Hopkins
said. "They had, say, bigger guys
guarding our smaller guys, which
messed them up, and they were get
ting kicked out a lot. Their set men
and two-meter men were guarding
our drivers, and their set men are
not that great drive defenders. It
made it a little easier for us to ex
pose their bad defense."
The Cardinal, on the other hand,
held top Cal's top three scorers —
Mann, Andija Vasiljevic and Brian
Bacharach — to just three goals.
Despite defeating the Bears by a
large margin for the second time this
season, the Cardinal are still
adamant that the cross-bay rivalry
stands strong.
"Anyone who watched the game
today saw that it was a physical
game," Hopkins said. "There's a
huge rivalry still. This year, we're a
little bit better of a team, but next
year may be different, so it's an on
going rivalry."
The rivalry continues next week
in Berkeley with the official Big
Splash. While certainly not expect
ing to lose their final match, the
Cardinal are looking for the match
to be a little harder.
"It's always between a heated ri
valry," Azevedo said. "I feel bad,
them having to come in on Senior
Day.a big day with everyone here
for us. We were fired up, but it's
going to be scary when we go there
for Big Game; they're tough to play
at home."
Stanford's last regular season
home game honored the team's five
seniors.
Azevedo, Matt Moser, Trent
Wiesen. Sam Tyre and Greg Crum
were accompanied by family and
friends. The group has gone to the
NCAA championships the past
three years and helped the Cardinal
win the 2(X)1 and 2002 National titles.
