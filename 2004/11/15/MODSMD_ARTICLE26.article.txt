# New-look Stanford beats Eagles in exhibition
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
SANTA CLARA. Calif. — In its first
public appearance under new head coach
Trent Johnson, the Stanford men's basket
ball team showed that, despite losing last
year's top three scorers, it still has plenty
of offensive punch in the cupboard.
Junior guard Dan Grunfeld, a reserve
the past two seasons, scored 22 points on
10-of-13 shooting in Stanford's XB-64 exhi
bition game victory over the Concordia
(Calif.) Eagles before 2,102 college bas
ketball-starved fans at Santa Clara's
Leavey Center.
Though he is one of the few perimeter
threats on the Cardinal roster. Grunfeld did
all of his damage inside the arc.
"I try to pride myself on being multi-di
mensional." said Grunfeld, who did not at
tempt a three-pointer. "If one thing's not
working, you've got many options. I
thought today, 'If they're giving you driv
ing lanes, you've got to take them, get to
the basket."'
Concordia gave and Grunfeld took,
again and again. He slashed to the hole
with and without the ball, converting
layups and draining short jumpers.
Grunfeld also created opportunities for

his teammates, dishing out seven assists
against one turnover, and pulled down
six rebounds.
"1 thought Danny did a good job on the
offensive end," Johnson said.
Grunfeld, who is vying for minutes at
the shooting guard position with redshirt
freshman Tim Morris and sophomore
Fred Washington, got plenty of help in the
scoring department as the Cardinal shot
an impressive 59.6 percent from the field
as a team.
Junior point guard Chris Hernandez,
who played a good deal at shooting guard,
led all scorers with 23 points to go along
with seven assists, while senior forward
Nick Robinson finished with 14 points and
a game-high 12 rebounds. Senior center
Rob Little added 10 points, and Morris
and Washington finished with four points
apiece.
Despite his team's solid offensive num
bers, Johnson made it clear the Cardinal
must continue to improve before Friday's
season opener against San Francisco.
"We've got work to do," Johnson said.
"1 don't think any of our guys are going to
lack confidence or aggressiveness at the
offensive end. I think the bottom line for
us is we have to defend with a sense of ur
gency and do the little things that turn into

big things."
The Eagles, who won the 2003 NAIA
national championship and are coached by
former Stanford guard Ken 'Ammann,
hung with the Cardinal for most of the first
half. But with Stanford leading 34-26 at the
3:21 mark. Hernandez and Grunfeld took
over.
As part of a 14-2 run to close the half,
Hernandez converted a steal into an easy
layup. fed Grunfeld fora dunk in transi
tion and drilled two of his three three
point attempts.
"We had some opportunities in transi
tion because we rebounded, got the ball
out and made some decent decisions,"
Johnson said. "If you defend and rebound,
you're going to have opportunities to
run."
Freshman forward Taj Finger looked
strong in his collegiate debut, actively
crashing the offensive and defensive glass
and finishing with three points — all from
the free throw line — and four rebounds
in 10 minutes.
Johnson used the game to experiment
with several different lineups, including
one that featured junior Jason Haas run
ning the point and Hernandez at shooting
guard.
Despite the constant substitutions, the

game had a noticeably different feel than
exhibition games in year's past, which
were traditionally against traveling teams
made up of former college players. In
April, the NCAA banned men's college
basketball teams from scheduling non-col
legiate opponents.
"I think it's a little bit more intense be
cause these guys have something to prove
and they have pride in their program,"
Grunfeld said of the difference. "When
you're playing a traveling team, guys are
getting together and playing, but maybe
there's not that sense of urgency."
With 5:19 to play in the game and Stan
ford comfortably in control, freshman center
Peter Prowitt was ejected for throwing a re
taliatory. intentional elbow at Concordia's
Clint Hull after Hull appeared to try to draw
a charge at midcourt. Prowitt left with three
points and a rebound in seven minutes.
A strong contingent of the Sixth Man
Club made the short trip to Santa Clara,
Stanford's home away from home while
renovations to Maples Pavilion are com
pleted. The red-clad students drowned
out the public address announcer with a
steady ovation during Stanford's player
introductions and Johnson was treated to
a staccato chant of "Trent! Trent!
Trent!"


Junior forward Matt Haryasz is prepared to step into
a more active role this year for the Cardinal. Haryasz
picked up four points in Saturday's 88-64 victory.

"We've got work to do," Johnson said.
"1 don't think any of our guys are going to
lack confidence or aggressiveness at the
offensive end. I think the bottom line for
us is we have to defend with a sense of ur
gency and do the little things that turn into

big things."
The Eagles, who won the 2003 NAIA
national championship and are coached by
former Stanford guard Ken 'Ammann,
hung with the Cardinal for most of the first
half. But with Stanford leading 34-26 at the
3:21 mark. Hernandez and Grunfeld took
over.
As part of a 14-2 run to close the half,
Hernandez converted a steal into an easy
layup. fed Grunfeld fora dunk in transi
tion and drilled two of his three three
point attempts.
"We had some opportunities in transi
tion because we rebounded, got the ball
out and made some decent decisions,"
Johnson said. "If you defend and rebound,
you're going to have opportunities to
run."
Freshman forward Taj Finger looked
strong in his collegiate debut, actively
crashing the offensive and defensive glass
and finishing with three points — all from
the free throw line — and four rebounds
in 10 minutes.
Johnson used the game to experiment
with several different lineups, including
one that featured junior Jason Haas run
ning the point and Hernandez at shooting
guard.
Despite the constant substitutions, the

game had a noticeably different feel than
exhibition games in year's past, which
were traditionally against traveling teams
made up of former college players. In
April, the NCAA banned men's college
basketball teams from scheduling non-col
legiate opponents.
"I think it's a little bit more intense be
cause these guys have something to prove
and they have pride in their program,"
Grunfeld said of the difference. "When
you're playing a traveling team, guys are
getting together and playing, but maybe
there's not that sense of urgency."
With 5:19 to play in the game and Stan
ford comfortably in control, freshman center
Peter Prowitt was ejected for throwing a re
taliatory. intentional elbow at Concordia's
Clint Hull after Hull appeared to try to draw
a charge at midcourt. Prowitt left with three
points and a rebound in seven minutes.
A strong contingent of the Sixth Man
Club made the short trip to Santa Clara,
Stanford's home away from home while
renovations to Maples Pavilion are com
pleted. The red-clad students drowned
out the public address announcer with a
steady ovation during Stanford's player
introductions and Johnson was treated to
a staccato chant of "Trent! Trent!
Trent!"


Junior forward Matt Haryasz is prepared to step into
a more active role this year for the Cardinal. Haryasz
picked up four points in Saturday's 88-64 victory.
SANTA CLARA. Calif. — In its first
public appearance under new head coach
Trent Johnson, the Stanford men's basket
ball team showed that, despite losing last
year's top three scorers, it still has plenty
of offensive punch in the cupboard.
Junior guard Dan Grunfeld, a reserve
the past two seasons, scored 22 points on
10-of-13 shooting in Stanford's XB-64 exhi
bition game victory over the Concordia
(Calif.) Eagles before 2,102 college bas
ketball-starved fans at Santa Clara's
Leavey Center.
Though he is one of the few perimeter
threats on the Cardinal roster. Grunfeld did
all of his damage inside the arc.
"I try to pride myself on being multi-di
mensional." said Grunfeld, who did not at
tempt a three-pointer. "If one thing's not
working, you've got many options. I
thought today, 'If they're giving you driv
ing lanes, you've got to take them, get to
the basket."'
Concordia gave and Grunfeld took,
again and again. He slashed to the hole
with and without the ball, converting
layups and draining short jumpers.
Grunfeld also created opportunities for

his teammates, dishing out seven assists
against one turnover, and pulled down
six rebounds.
"1 thought Danny did a good job on the
offensive end," Johnson said.
Grunfeld, who is vying for minutes at
the shooting guard position with redshirt
freshman Tim Morris and sophomore
Fred Washington, got plenty of help in the
scoring department as the Cardinal shot
an impressive 59.6 percent from the field
as a team.
Junior point guard Chris Hernandez,
who played a good deal at shooting guard,
led all scorers with 23 points to go along
with seven assists, while senior forward
Nick Robinson finished with 14 points and
a game-high 12 rebounds. Senior center
Rob Little added 10 points, and Morris
and Washington finished with four points
apiece.
Despite his team's solid offensive num
bers, Johnson made it clear the Cardinal
must continue to improve before Friday's
season opener against San Francisco.
"We've got work to do," Johnson said.
