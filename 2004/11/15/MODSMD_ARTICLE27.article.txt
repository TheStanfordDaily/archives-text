# Women notch back-to-back preseason wins
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Thankfully for the No. 7 Stanford women's
basketball team, the season is all about wins
and losses. In their two exhibition games last
weekend, the Cardinal went 2-0. In the style
contest, the judges may have been tempted to
disqualify them.
Stanford notched a comfortable 64-40 victo
ry against an athletic Love and Basketball team
(5-2) on Sunday after a 7K-48 triumph over
Baden Sports, but the early-season rust was ev
ident during Sunday's hot-and-cold perfor
mance by the defending Pacific-10 Conference
champions.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer summed up
the Cardinal's ups and downs: "I thought we
missed a lot of shots we need to make, but we
rebounded well. We need to have people be
much more aggressive, but overall, it was a
good start."
On offense Sunday, Stanford was unpre
dictable, to say the least. On many trips down
the court, fans were reminded of the well-oiled
machine of a year ago, as the Cardinal had
great success moving the ball and hitting open
shots.
The tandem of sophomore Kristen Newlin,
who led Stanford with nine points, and junior
Brooke Smith often looked unstoppable, as
they were able to establish excellent position
inside and convert easy chances or kick the ball
out to a wide-open senior Sebnem Kimyacioglu
fora three-point field goal. .
Yet, if that was the efficient Stanford Jekyll
on offense, an awkward, turnover-prone Hyde
was equally likely to appear.
"We turned it over too much in the first half,
but we were getting good shots, and we just
weren't making them," VanDerveer said.
"What I was happy about was our rebounding.
1 think our [offensive rebounding] was the big
difference."

Stanford's starting guards, senior Kelley
Suminski and freshman Candice Wiggins, both
struggled to keep the offense flowing in the first
half. After an excellent college debut on Thurs
day, Wiggins struggled at the point yesterday,
forcing a number of ill-advised shots in traffic
and showing her youth in a rough first half.
Wiggins will replace senior Susan King Bor
chardt at point guard while Borchardt is side
lined with a stress reaction in her left foot.
Nonetheless, there is no recovery timetable,
and she plans to start in the team's season open
er in Utah on Friday.
There was plenty of blame to go around for
the Cardinal's play on offense, however. 17
Stanford turnovers overall and 10 in the first
half kept Love and Basketball in the game and
the Cardinal's lead was just 31-23 at the half.
For their part. Love and Basketball took
what Stanford gave them and refused to lie
down. They moved the ball well and consis
tently knocked down open shots against the
Cardinal's zone defense. Michelle Greco led
the way for the visitors with 17 points and
played well on defense as well, collecting four
steals.
"This is a much better team [than Baden
Sports)," VanDerveer said. "It's a team that's
been beating everybody, and they came out
and played hard against us."
There were, however, encouraging signs in
Stanford's final tune-up before the start of the
regular season.
First, and possibly most impressive, the Car
dinal beat both of their opponents this week
end with superior effort on both offense and
defense. Against teams in the midst of their
regular seasons, Stanford won virtually every
loose ball and constantly clogged opposing
passing lanes.
"We're not always going to be hot from the
outside or inside," Newlin said. "The one thing
that's constant is our defense. We have to step it
up and make our offense run from our defense."

In addition, the Cardinal were dominant in
side all weekend. The offensive glass in partic
ular belonged to Stanford on Sunday, where it
pulled down 26 offensive rebounds and beat
Love and Basketball 60-32 in rebounds overall.
The Cardinal kick off their season this Friday
in Salt Lake City, Utah, where they will take on
Utah before returning home Sunday fora show
down with the University of the Pacific.
