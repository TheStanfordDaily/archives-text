# Postseason unlikely for Cardinal
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its regular-season finale, the Stanford men's soc
cer team (7-6-5, 2-4-2 Pacific-10 Conference) was
painfully close to a win against rival No. 7 California (12-
3-3,4-3-1 Pac-10).
One goal, two overtimes and a game-winner later,
the C ardinal had seen a final golden opportunity to
prove their case fora playoff berth slip away as they lost
3-2 in double overtime to the Golden Bears.
More important than the loss to a rival, Stanford is
now no longer in control of its playoff destiny. Many
members of the Cardinal squad predicted last week that
a win was necessary in order to convince the NCAA se
lection committee that they deserved a spot in the Tour
nament.
"1 haven't seen the scores from today [Sunday], and
I don't know who won conference tournaments and fin
ished up strongly," said head coach Bret Simon. "Our
RPI should be somewhere in the low 30s and 48 teams
get in, but with automatic bids you have no idea. Either
way, we'll be on the bubble and either barely get in or
just be left out."
Stanford played very evenly against Cal on Saturday
and gave the Golden Bears a massive scare. California
took the lead in the middle of the first half as Nick Hatze
blasted the ball into the net from 30 yards out. Stanford
went into halitime down a goal and was thoroughly out
shot, 13-2.
However, the Cardinal responded aggressively
alter halttime and put Cal on its heels with a relentless
attack.
Early in the second half, senior forward Matt
Janusz's corner kick found Stanford's leading scorer,
Darren Fernandez, who was able to put his head on it
and knock the ball past Bears keeper Eric Kronberg.
The goal was Fernandez's eighth of the year.
The second half would remain deadlocked until the
84th minute, when Stanford sophomore midfielder
Galen Thompson was able to sneak the ball into the net
from the edge of the 18-yard box with a curving shot.
The 2-1 lead was the Cardinal's first against the Bears all
season, and the Cardinal were six minutes from a victo
ry and a statement for the postseason.
California would not go quietly, likely remembering
a similar comeback charge from the Cardinal this year at
Maloney Field.
In the 89th minute, Cal's Calen Carr shot from six
yards out and the ball bounced off the post. After block
ing two scoring chances near the goal line, the Cardinal
defense could not clear the ball to safety and Yohei
Fukuda finally knocked in the equalizer.
After a scoreless first overtime, Stanford and Cali
fornia went to their second double overtime of the sea
son.
The golden goal came in the 103 rd minute. Carr was
able to break free of the Stanford defense in the penal
ty area and pass to sophomore teammate Eric Ebert,
who placed the ball in the goal.
Ebert's tally was his third game-winner of the year,
and it may very well have ended Stanford's season.
"My reaction is that we saw two relatively evenly
matched teams play an open and exciting match,"
Simon said. "We made two mistakes in key places that
may come back to haunt us, and everybody is really dis
appointed. We thought we had them where we wanted,
but the game was so open we knew they would have

more scoring opportunity. We're just going to have to
see how everything pans out on Monday."
The Cardinal will join many teams on the West Coast
as they nervously watch the revealing of the NCAA
Tournament bracket on ESPNEWS at 1 p.m. this after
noon.
One bright spot is the fact that Stanford had an ex
tremely demanding schedule that forced it to play pre
mier programs like No. 9 Washington, No. 4 UCLA and
California twice due to conference play and added non
conference teams like No. 19 Santa Clara and top
ranked UC-Santa Barbara.
Also, the Pac-10 has sent four teams to the tourna
ment for the past three seasons. UCLA, California and
Washington are all but assured a spot in the tournament,
but if Stanford does not make the tournament, it will
mark the first time that the conference has only sent
three teams since the 2000 season.
Whatever the selection results are. the coaching staff
realizes that this was a year of progress.
"I think we have brought the program back to where
we are competitive against the top teams in the coun
try," Simon said. "We're obviously not the big dog yet.
Our next goal is to play the type of schedule we've put
together and get big wins. One of the tricky things about
playing a great schedule is you can feel like you didn't
meet expectations. We had so many close games, espe
cially with injuries to key players.
"I think we will be able to look in hindsight and call
this a step in the right direction."

Maloney Field.
In the 89th minute, Cal's Calen Carr shot from six
yards out and the ball bounced off the post. After block
ing two scoring chances near the goal line, the Cardinal
defense could not clear the ball to safety and Yohei
Fukuda finally knocked in the equalizer.
After a scoreless first overtime, Stanford and Cali
fornia went to their second double overtime of the sea
son.
The golden goal came in the 103 rd minute. Carr was
able to break free of the Stanford defense in the penal
ty area and pass to sophomore teammate Eric Ebert,
who placed the ball in the goal.
Ebert's tally was his third game-winner of the year,
and it may very well have ended Stanford's season.
"My reaction is that we saw two relatively evenly
matched teams play an open and exciting match,"
Simon said. "We made two mistakes in key places that
may come back to haunt us, and everybody is really dis
appointed. We thought we had them where we wanted,
but the game was so open we knew they would have

more scoring opportunity. We're just going to have to
see how everything pans out on Monday."
The Cardinal will join many teams on the West Coast
as they nervously watch the revealing of the NCAA
Tournament bracket on ESPNEWS at 1 p.m. this after
noon.
One bright spot is the fact that Stanford had an ex
tremely demanding schedule that forced it to play pre
mier programs like No. 9 Washington, No. 4 UCLA and
California twice due to conference play and added non
conference teams like No. 19 Santa Clara and top
ranked UC-Santa Barbara.
Also, the Pac-10 has sent four teams to the tourna
ment for the past three seasons. UCLA, California and
Washington are all but assured a spot in the tournament,
but if Stanford does not make the tournament, it will
mark the first time that the conference has only sent
three teams since the 2000 season.
Whatever the selection results are. the coaching staff
realizes that this was a year of progress.
"I think we have brought the program back to where
we are competitive against the top teams in the coun
try," Simon said. "We're obviously not the big dog yet.
Our next goal is to play the type of schedule we've put
together and get big wins. One of the tricky things about
playing a great schedule is you can feel like you didn't
meet expectations. We had so many close games, espe
cially with injuries to key players.
"I think we will be able to look in hindsight and call
this a step in the right direction."

Darren Fernandez and the Cardinal were struck down by
the Golden Bears in their regular-season finale.
In its regular-season finale, the Stanford men's soc
cer team (7-6-5, 2-4-2 Pacific-10 Conference) was
painfully close to a win against rival No. 7 California (12-
3-3,4-3-1 Pac-10).
One goal, two overtimes and a game-winner later,
the C ardinal had seen a final golden opportunity to
prove their case fora playoff berth slip away as they lost
3-2 in double overtime to the Golden Bears.
More important than the loss to a rival, Stanford is
now no longer in control of its playoff destiny. Many
members of the Cardinal squad predicted last week that
a win was necessary in order to convince the NCAA se
lection committee that they deserved a spot in the Tour
nament.
"1 haven't seen the scores from today [Sunday], and
I don't know who won conference tournaments and fin
ished up strongly," said head coach Bret Simon. "Our
RPI should be somewhere in the low 30s and 48 teams
get in, but with automatic bids you have no idea. Either
way, we'll be on the bubble and either barely get in or
just be left out."
Stanford played very evenly against Cal on Saturday
and gave the Golden Bears a massive scare. California
took the lead in the middle of the first half as Nick Hatze
blasted the ball into the net from 30 yards out. Stanford
went into halitime down a goal and was thoroughly out
shot, 13-2.
However, the Cardinal responded aggressively
alter halttime and put Cal on its heels with a relentless
attack.
Early in the second half, senior forward Matt
Janusz's corner kick found Stanford's leading scorer,
Darren Fernandez, who was able to put his head on it
and knock the ball past Bears keeper Eric Kronberg.
The goal was Fernandez's eighth of the year.
The second half would remain deadlocked until the
84th minute, when Stanford sophomore midfielder
Galen Thompson was able to sneak the ball into the net
from the edge of the 18-yard box with a curving shot.
The 2-1 lead was the Cardinal's first against the Bears all
season, and the Cardinal were six minutes from a victo
ry and a statement for the postseason.
