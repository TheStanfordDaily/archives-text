Editor's Note: Although the student fea
tured in thus story gave The Daily per
mission to use his real name, we chose
not to publish it. The student is referred
to as "Neil Fisher." We agree with the
ethical guidelines set by the American
Psychiatric Association that, because of
the widespread stigma and varying cul
tural contexts associated with mental ill
ness, protecting patient confidentiality is
more important in this area than in
other areas of medicine.
When sophomore "Neil Fisher" ar
rived at Vaden Health Center fora
routine check-up on Friday, Oct. 29,
he expected to see his doctor, pick up
his prescription and be home in time
for dinner. He had no idea that the ap
pointment would end with him hand
cuffed in the backseat of a squad car
or that he would be forced to spend
the next three days at the locked inpa
tient psychiatric ward of Stanford
Hospital.
His experience highlights the deli
cate complexity of doctor-patient rela
tions in psychiatric medicine, where
doctors are sometimes forced to make
judgments they can never be sure of
and where doing nothing could, in it
self, violate the Hippocratic Oath.
"This was my fourth trip to Vaden,"
said Fisher, who was diagnosed with
clinical depression several months ago.
"I'm used to going. I didn't think I'd be
arrested,"
Fisher was not taken into custody
on criminal charges but rather under
code "5150," the section of state law
that requires physicians and peace offi
cers to hold mental patients for three
days, against their will if necessary, at a
psychiatric treatment facility, if they
believe the patient is a danger to him
self, a danger to others or gravely dis
abled.
The process was briefly explained to
Fisher on a one-page form given to him
prior to his admission to H2, the acute
inpatient psychiatry ward on the sec
ond floor of Stanford Hospital. Fisher
said that he was wrongly placed into
care and that the treatment he received
— which he described as "grossly neg
ligent" at times — left him worse off

than before he was brought into cus
tody.
Stanford students are not uncom
mon at the ward, said medical director
and assistant professor of psychiatry
Dr. Rona Hu.
"At any given time there's usually
at least one Stanford student at H2.
probably one-to-three, including both
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents."
Stanford Hospital's psychiatry cen
ter, which includes H2 and separate
outpatient facilities, ranked eighth this
year in a national survey conducted by
U.S. News and World Report.
H2 is a 16-bed locked facility that
provides medical and social care for
patients with mental disorders. Hu said
that patients are usually sent by their
doctors, peace officers or brought in by
concerned friends and family mem
bers. On the written application plac
ing Fisher into custody. Fisher's doctor
at Vaden cited "statements (Fisher)
made about increasing suicidal
ideation" and "inability to provide for
(his) own food," conditions which ful
filled two of the three possible criteria
that necessitates enacting a 5150.
Fisher called the assessment, which
followed a discussion of his school per
formance, sleep patterns and eating
habits, a "presumption rather than a
valid conclusion." Fischer said that at
no time during the discussion did he ex
plicitly tell his doctor he intended to
commit suicide.
According to Dr. John Brooks, the
co-director of inpatient psychiatry at
the veteran's hospital in Palo Alto, the
law was written precisely to allow pro
fessionals to make conservative judg
ments.
"The law is set up to protect the pa
tient... The consequences of not treat
ing a patient who actually commits sui
cide are much worse than treating a pa
tient who may only be contemplating
suicide," said Brooks, who is also an as
sistant professor of psychiatry.
"People are notterribly good at de
termining who will actually commit
suicide," he said. "For example, there
are patients who say they have no plan,
but then you find out years later they
