Editor's Note: Although the student fea
tured in thus story gave The Daily per
mission to use his real name, we chose
not to publish it. The student is referred
to as "Neil Fisher." We agree with the
ethical guidelines set by the American
Psychiatric Association that, because of
the widespread stigma and varying cul
tural contexts associated with mental ill
ness, protecting patient confidentiality is
more important in this area than in
other areas of medicine.
When sophomore "Neil Fisher" ar
rived at Vaden Health Center fora
routine check-up on Friday, Oct. 29,
he expected to see his doctor, pick up
his prescription and be home in time
for dinner. He had no idea that the ap
pointment would end with him hand
cuffed in the backseat of a squad car
or that he would be forced to spend
the next three days at the locked inpa
tient psychiatric ward of Stanford
Hospital.
His experience highlights the deli
cate complexity of doctor-patient rela
tions in psychiatric medicine, where
doctors are sometimes forced to make
judgments they can never be sure of
and where doing nothing could, in it
self, violate the Hippocratic Oath.
"This was my fourth trip to Vaden,"
said Fisher, who was diagnosed with
clinical depression several months ago.
"I'm used to going. I didn't think I'd be
arrested,"
Fisher was not taken into custody
on criminal charges but rather under
code "5150," the section of state law
that requires physicians and peace offi
cers to hold mental patients for three
days, against their will if necessary, at a
psychiatric treatment facility, if they
believe the patient is a danger to him
self, a danger to others or gravely dis
abled.
The process was briefly explained to
Fisher on a one-page form given to him
prior to his admission to H2, the acute
inpatient psychiatry ward on the sec
ond floor of Stanford Hospital. Fisher
said that he was wrongly placed into
care and that the treatment he received
— which he described as "grossly neg
ligent" at times — left him worse off

than before he was brought into cus
tody.
Stanford students are not uncom
mon at the ward, said medical director
and assistant professor of psychiatry
Dr. Rona Hu.
"At any given time there's usually
at least one Stanford student at H2.
probably one-to-three, including both
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents."
Stanford Hospital's psychiatry cen
ter, which includes H2 and separate
outpatient facilities, ranked eighth this
year in a national survey conducted by
U.S. News and World Report.
H2 is a 16-bed locked facility that
provides medical and social care for
patients with mental disorders. Hu said
that patients are usually sent by their
doctors, peace officers or brought in by
concerned friends and family mem
bers. On the written application plac
ing Fisher into custody. Fisher's doctor
at Vaden cited "statements (Fisher)
made about increasing suicidal
ideation" and "inability to provide for
(his) own food," conditions which ful
filled two of the three possible criteria
that necessitates enacting a 5150.
Fisher called the assessment, which
followed a discussion of his school per
formance, sleep patterns and eating
habits, a "presumption rather than a
valid conclusion." Fischer said that at
no time during the discussion did he ex
plicitly tell his doctor he intended to
commit suicide.
According to Dr. John Brooks, the
co-director of inpatient psychiatry at
the veteran's hospital in Palo Alto, the
law was written precisely to allow pro
fessionals to make conservative judg
ments.
"The law is set up to protect the pa
tient... The consequences of not treat
ing a patient who actually commits sui
cide are much worse than treating a pa
tient who may only be contemplating
suicide," said Brooks, who is also an as
sistant professor of psychiatry.
"People are notterribly good at de
termining who will actually commit
suicide," he said. "For example, there
are patients who say they have no plan,
but then you find out years later they
had a loaded gun in their dresser all
along but didn't want to tell you about
it."
While Fisher conceded that there
was little he could do to protest his doc
tor's professional opinion after the fact,
he remains troubled by his time at the
ward, calling it "one of the worst expe
riences of my life."
After entering 112. Fisher said he ini
tially refused to cooperate with nurses
on the basis that he had been wrongful
ly taken into custody in the first place.
I lowever, at abt>ul 2 a.m. he said." I de
cided it was in my best interest to at
least give the stall my medical informa
tion since I have asthma and high blood
pressure."
Two hours later he requested and
received a prescription for Ventolin, a

common asthma medication, after he
said he began "heaving and feeling
breathless." The medication took
three hours to arrive, he said.
"I've never been without an inhaler
when I needed it for so long," Fisher
said. "It was pretty scary."
By state and federal law. hospitals
are not allowed to release any informa
tion about specific patients being treat
ed for mental disorders. However,
healthcare workers can discuss general
hospital procedure.
Hu said the staff asks for all medical
records from each patient shortly after
they enter the ward to prevent a situa
tion like Fisher's from happening.
"We ask what their medical Condi
tit >ns are and fora complete list of med
icines they're on so we have that medi

cine ready for them well ahead of
time," she said.
Hu said that the the typical wait time
for medication varies. "It may take
longer to fill a prescription depending
on the time of day. There are fewer
people working at the pharmacy in the
middle of the night," she added.
The second night of the stay was the
worst. Fisher said. He asked a nurse for
his "Family Guy" DVD, which had
been confiscated upon his arrival.
When he was denied, he began arguing
with staff members, prompting them to
send him to solitary confinement until
8 a.m. the next morning.
Fisher called the seven-hour experi
ence "traumatic, to say the least. The
rtxmi was all white, no contrast. It was
half the size of a dorm rcx)m. and the
windows were all boarded up."
After spending a sleepless night in
the isolation room. Fisher said he
asked to see a doctor for stress-induced
hypertension and was refused access.
"I was starting to get really stressed
out and felt dizzy," he said. "When I
told the nurse about it, she wouldn't let
me see a doctor because she didn't be
lieve me."
He saw a doctor about six hours
later, shortly after his father arrived
from outside the country; he had flown
in to Stanford out of concern for Fish
er's situation.
Fisher was discharged on the Mon
day after his arrival. Just after his re
lease, his bl(X)d pressure measured 150
110, unusually high fora 19-year-old.
As he was preparing to leave he real
ized his shoes were missing — a fellow
mental patient had stolen them.
"1 had to stand out on the curb wait
ing for my ride in socks," he said.
His shoes were recovered two days
later, but another theft aggravated
Fisher even more: "I went back to
Vaden to pick up my bike, and it was
gone. Somebody stole it. I guess be
cause it was just sitting there for three
days."
Medical costs — which can be sub
stantial for inpatient care — are an
other factor patients must deal with
after their release. At a daily rate of
$2,500. Fisher said his hospital bill to
taled $7.5(X) for treatment he actively

resisted.
"Luckily my insurance will cover
most of it,"he syid. "But what if 1 didn't
have insurance? How would I be able
to pay for that?"
Because psychiatric care constitutes
medical care. Dr. Brooks said the bill is
the patient's responsibility, regardless
of the circumstances that brought him
to the hospital. "That's one unfortu
nate aspect of the U.S. healthcare sys
tem." he said.
He compared a 5150 to another life
saving medical procedure: "Let's say
you have severe abdominal pain and a
fever, and go to the hospital where you
find out your appendix has to be taken
out. Afterwards, you say. Well, I don't
think I wanted it removed, even
though I could have died otherwise.'
That doesn't relieve you of the burden
of paying for the operation."
Fisher will stop out for the remain
der of the quarter, a decision that he
said was partly induced by his experi
ence at the ward and its aftermath. "I
was so exhausted after I got home," he
said. "I missed almost a week of class."
"I talked to my advisor and my dad
about it: we thought [stopping-out]
would be the best thing to do." he said.
"You know, start fresh next quarter."
Fisher said he is considering press
ing charges, but that he really just
wants an apology from his doctor at
Vaden and the H2 staff at Stanford
Hospital.
"I want them to acknowledge that
they made a mistake. I definitely
wouldn't want this to happen to anoth
er student."
If a patient is dissatisfied with treat
ment. Hu suggested three different op
tions of recourse. The patient can leave
specific feedback on a post-treatment
survey; he or she can file a complaint with
Stanford's Ombuds Office, which acts as
a mediator and is independent of Stan
ford Hospital; or the patient can take
legal action against the hospital by re
questing a free patient advocate to help
file suit at the Santa Clara courthouse.
Hu empathized with patients who
felt they were wrongly placed in the
ward, and like Brooks, she said the pri
mary goal of the 5150 law is to save lives.
"Nobody wants to be locked up for
longer than necessary," she said.
While Fisher has negative associa
tions with the ward, he recognized its
importance.
"A lot of people in there needed to
be treated like children. I don't doubt
the fact that it's an effective system
overall, but there are flaws in that sys
tem that 1 can attest to."
"I was a sane person going into an
insane asylum — I felt lucky in a way
because I had a different perspective,"
he added.

When sophomore "Neil Fisher" ar
rived at Vaden Health Center fora
routine check-up on Friday, Oct. 29,
he expected to see his doctor, pick up
his prescription and be home in time
for dinner. He had no idea that the ap
pointment would end with him hand
cuffed in the backseat of a squad car
or that he would be forced to spend
the next three days at the locked inpa
tient psychiatric ward of Stanford
Hospital.
His experience highlights the deli
cate complexity of doctor-patient rela
tions in psychiatric medicine, where
doctors are sometimes forced to make
judgments they can never be sure of
and where doing nothing could, in it
self, violate the Hippocratic Oath.
"This was my fourth trip to Vaden,"
said Fisher, who was diagnosed with
clinical depression several months ago.
"I'm used to going. I didn't think I'd be
arrested,"
Fisher was not taken into custody
on criminal charges but rather under
code "5150," the section of state law
that requires physicians and peace offi
cers to hold mental patients for three
days, against their will if necessary, at a
psychiatric treatment facility, if they
believe the patient is a danger to him
self, a danger to others or gravely dis
abled.
The process was briefly explained to
Fisher on a one-page form given to him
prior to his admission to H2, the acute
inpatient psychiatry ward on the sec
ond floor of Stanford Hospital. Fisher
said that he was wrongly placed into
care and that the treatment he received
— which he described as "grossly neg
ligent" at times — left him worse off

than before he was brought into cus
tody.
Stanford students are not uncom
mon at the ward, said medical director
and assistant professor of psychiatry
Dr. Rona Hu.
"At any given time there's usually
at least one Stanford student at H2.
probably one-to-three, including both
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents."
Stanford Hospital's psychiatry cen
ter, which includes H2 and separate
outpatient facilities, ranked eighth this
year in a national survey conducted by
U.S. News and World Report.
H2 is a 16-bed locked facility that
provides medical and social care for
patients with mental disorders. Hu said
that patients are usually sent by their
doctors, peace officers or brought in by
concerned friends and family mem
bers. On the written application plac
ing Fisher into custody. Fisher's doctor
at Vaden cited "statements (Fisher)
made about increasing suicidal
ideation" and "inability to provide for
(his) own food," conditions which ful
filled two of the three possible criteria
that necessitates enacting a 5150.
Fisher called the assessment, which
followed a discussion of his school per
formance, sleep patterns and eating
habits, a "presumption rather than a
valid conclusion." Fischer said that at
no time during the discussion did he ex
plicitly tell his doctor he intended to
commit suicide.
According to Dr. John Brooks, the
co-director of inpatient psychiatry at
the veteran's hospital in Palo Alto, the
law was written precisely to allow pro
fessionals to make conservative judg
ments.
"The law is set up to protect the pa
tient... The consequences of not treat
ing a patient who actually commits sui
cide are much worse than treating a pa
tient who may only be contemplating
suicide," said Brooks, who is also an as
sistant professor of psychiatry.
"People are notterribly good at de
termining who will actually commit
suicide," he said. "For example, there
are patients who say they have no plan,
but then you find out years later they
had a loaded gun in their dresser all
along but didn't want to tell you about
it."
While Fisher conceded that there
was little he could do to protest his doc
tor's professional opinion after the fact,
he remains troubled by his time at the
ward, calling it "one of the worst expe
riences of my life."
After entering 112. Fisher said he ini
tially refused to cooperate with nurses
on the basis that he had been wrongful
ly taken into custody in the first place.
I lowever, at abt>ul 2 a.m. he said." I de
cided it was in my best interest to at
least give the stall my medical informa
tion since I have asthma and high blood
pressure."
Two hours later he requested and
received a prescription for Ventolin, a

common asthma medication, after he
said he began "heaving and feeling
breathless." The medication took
three hours to arrive, he said.
"I've never been without an inhaler
when I needed it for so long," Fisher
said. "It was pretty scary."
By state and federal law. hospitals
are not allowed to release any informa
tion about specific patients being treat
ed for mental disorders. However,
healthcare workers can discuss general
hospital procedure.
Hu said the staff asks for all medical
records from each patient shortly after
they enter the ward to prevent a situa
tion like Fisher's from happening.
"We ask what their medical Condi
tit >ns are and fora complete list of med
icines they're on so we have that medi

cine ready for them well ahead of
time," she said.
Hu said that the the typical wait time
for medication varies. "It may take
longer to fill a prescription depending
on the time of day. There are fewer
people working at the pharmacy in the
middle of the night," she added.
The second night of the stay was the
worst. Fisher said. He asked a nurse for
his "Family Guy" DVD, which had
been confiscated upon his arrival.
When he was denied, he began arguing
with staff members, prompting them to
send him to solitary confinement until
8 a.m. the next morning.
Fisher called the seven-hour experi
ence "traumatic, to say the least. The
rtxmi was all white, no contrast. It was
half the size of a dorm rcx)m. and the
windows were all boarded up."
After spending a sleepless night in
the isolation room. Fisher said he
asked to see a doctor for stress-induced
hypertension and was refused access.
"I was starting to get really stressed
out and felt dizzy," he said. "When I
told the nurse about it, she wouldn't let
me see a doctor because she didn't be
lieve me."
He saw a doctor about six hours
later, shortly after his father arrived
from outside the country; he had flown
in to Stanford out of concern for Fish
er's situation.
Fisher was discharged on the Mon
day after his arrival. Just after his re
lease, his bl(X)d pressure measured 150
110, unusually high fora 19-year-old.
As he was preparing to leave he real
ized his shoes were missing — a fellow
mental patient had stolen them.
"1 had to stand out on the curb wait
ing for my ride in socks," he said.
His shoes were recovered two days
later, but another theft aggravated
Fisher even more: "I went back to
Vaden to pick up my bike, and it was
gone. Somebody stole it. I guess be
cause it was just sitting there for three
days."
Medical costs — which can be sub
stantial for inpatient care — are an
other factor patients must deal with
after their release. At a daily rate of
$2,500. Fisher said his hospital bill to
taled $7.5(X) for treatment he actively

resisted.
"Luckily my insurance will cover
most of it,"he syid. "But what if 1 didn't
have insurance? How would I be able
to pay for that?"
Because psychiatric care constitutes
medical care. Dr. Brooks said the bill is
the patient's responsibility, regardless
of the circumstances that brought him
to the hospital. "That's one unfortu
nate aspect of the U.S. healthcare sys
tem." he said.
He compared a 5150 to another life
saving medical procedure: "Let's say
you have severe abdominal pain and a
fever, and go to the hospital where you
find out your appendix has to be taken
out. Afterwards, you say. Well, I don't
think I wanted it removed, even
though I could have died otherwise.'
That doesn't relieve you of the burden
of paying for the operation."
Fisher will stop out for the remain
der of the quarter, a decision that he
said was partly induced by his experi
ence at the ward and its aftermath. "I
was so exhausted after I got home," he
said. "I missed almost a week of class."
"I talked to my advisor and my dad
about it: we thought [stopping-out]
would be the best thing to do." he said.
"You know, start fresh next quarter."
Fisher said he is considering press
ing charges, but that he really just
wants an apology from his doctor at
Vaden and the H2 staff at Stanford
Hospital.
"I want them to acknowledge that
they made a mistake. I definitely
wouldn't want this to happen to anoth
er student."
If a patient is dissatisfied with treat
ment. Hu suggested three different op
tions of recourse. The patient can leave
specific feedback on a post-treatment
survey; he or she can file a complaint with
Stanford's Ombuds Office, which acts as
a mediator and is independent of Stan
ford Hospital; or the patient can take
legal action against the hospital by re
questing a free patient advocate to help
file suit at the Santa Clara courthouse.
Hu empathized with patients who
felt they were wrongly placed in the
ward, and like Brooks, she said the pri
mary goal of the 5150 law is to save lives.
"Nobody wants to be locked up for
longer than necessary," she said.
While Fisher has negative associa
tions with the ward, he recognized its
importance.
"A lot of people in there needed to
be treated like children. I don't doubt
the fact that it's an effective system
overall, but there are flaws in that sys
tem that 1 can attest to."
"I was a sane person going into an
insane asylum — I felt lucky in a way

When sophomore "Neil Fisher" ar
rived at Vaden Health Center fora
routine check-up on Friday, Oct. 29,
he expected to see his doctor, pick up
his prescription and be home in time
for dinner. He had no idea that the ap
pointment would end with him hand
cuffed in the backseat of a squad car
or that he would be forced to spend
the next three days at the locked inpa
tient psychiatric ward of Stanford
Hospital.
His experience highlights the deli
cate complexity of doctor-patient rela
tions in psychiatric medicine, where
doctors are sometimes forced to make
judgments they can never be sure of
and where doing nothing could, in it
self, violate the Hippocratic Oath.
"This was my fourth trip to Vaden,"
said Fisher, who was diagnosed with
clinical depression several months ago.
"I'm used to going. I didn't think I'd be
arrested,"
Fisher was not taken into custody
on criminal charges but rather under
code "5150," the section of state law
that requires physicians and peace offi
cers to hold mental patients for three
days, against their will if necessary, at a
psychiatric treatment facility, if they
believe the patient is a danger to him
self, a danger to others or gravely dis
abled.
The process was briefly explained to
Fisher on a one-page form given to him
prior to his admission to H2, the acute
inpatient psychiatry ward on the sec
ond floor of Stanford Hospital. Fisher
said that he was wrongly placed into
care and that the treatment he received
— which he described as "grossly neg
ligent" at times — left him worse off

than before he was brought into cus
tody.
Stanford students are not uncom
mon at the ward, said medical director
and assistant professor of psychiatry
Dr. Rona Hu.
"At any given time there's usually
at least one Stanford student at H2.
probably one-to-three, including both
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents."
Stanford Hospital's psychiatry cen
ter, which includes H2 and separate
outpatient facilities, ranked eighth this
year in a national survey conducted by
U.S. News and World Report.
H2 is a 16-bed locked facility that
provides medical and social care for
patients with mental disorders. Hu said
that patients are usually sent by their
doctors, peace officers or brought in by
concerned friends and family mem
bers. On the written application plac
ing Fisher into custody. Fisher's doctor
at Vaden cited "statements (Fisher)
made about increasing suicidal
ideation" and "inability to provide for
(his) own food," conditions which ful
filled two of the three possible criteria
that necessitates enacting a 5150.
Fisher called the assessment, which
followed a discussion of his school per
formance, sleep patterns and eating
habits, a "presumption rather than a
valid conclusion." Fischer said that at
no time during the discussion did he ex
plicitly tell his doctor he intended to
commit suicide.
According to Dr. John Brooks, the
co-director of inpatient psychiatry at
the veteran's hospital in Palo Alto, the
law was written precisely to allow pro
fessionals to make conservative judg
ments.
"The law is set up to protect the pa
tient... The consequences of not treat
ing a patient who actually commits sui
cide are much worse than treating a pa
tient who may only be contemplating
suicide," said Brooks, who is also an as
sistant professor of psychiatry.
"People are notterribly good at de
termining who will actually commit
suicide," he said. "For example, there
are patients who say they have no plan,
but then you find out years later they
had a loaded gun in their dresser all
along but didn't want to tell you about
it."
While Fisher conceded that there
was little he could do to protest his doc
tor's professional opinion after the fact,
he remains troubled by his time at the
ward, calling it "one of the worst expe
riences of my life."
After entering 112. Fisher said he ini
tially refused to cooperate with nurses
on the basis that he had been wrongful
ly taken into custody in the first place.
I lowever, at abt>ul 2 a.m. he said." I de
cided it was in my best interest to at
least give the stall my medical informa
tion since I have asthma and high blood
pressure."
Two hours later he requested and
received a prescription for Ventolin, a

common asthma medication, after he
said he began "heaving and feeling
breathless." The medication took
three hours to arrive, he said.
"I've never been without an inhaler
when I needed it for so long," Fisher
said. "It was pretty scary."
By state and federal law. hospitals
are not allowed to release any informa
tion about specific patients being treat
ed for mental disorders. However,
healthcare workers can discuss general
hospital procedure.
Hu said the staff asks for all medical
records from each patient shortly after
they enter the ward to prevent a situa
tion like Fisher's from happening.
"We ask what their medical Condi
tit >ns are and fora complete list of med
icines they're on so we have that medi

cine ready for them well ahead of
time," she said.
Hu said that the the typical wait time
for medication varies. "It may take
longer to fill a prescription depending
on the time of day. There are fewer
people working at the pharmacy in the
middle of the night," she added.
The second night of the stay was the
worst. Fisher said. He asked a nurse for
his "Family Guy" DVD, which had
been confiscated upon his arrival.
When he was denied, he began arguing
with staff members, prompting them to
send him to solitary confinement until
8 a.m. the next morning.
Fisher called the seven-hour experi
ence "traumatic, to say the least. The
rtxmi was all white, no contrast. It was
half the size of a dorm rcx)m. and the
windows were all boarded up."
After spending a sleepless night in
the isolation room. Fisher said he
asked to see a doctor for stress-induced
hypertension and was refused access.
"I was starting to get really stressed
out and felt dizzy," he said. "When I
told the nurse about it, she wouldn't let
me see a doctor because she didn't be
lieve me."
He saw a doctor about six hours
later, shortly after his father arrived
from outside the country; he had flown
in to Stanford out of concern for Fish
er's situation.
Fisher was discharged on the Mon
day after his arrival. Just after his re
lease, his bl(X)d pressure measured 150
110, unusually high fora 19-year-old.
As he was preparing to leave he real
ized his shoes were missing — a fellow
mental patient had stolen them.
"1 had to stand out on the curb wait
ing for my ride in socks," he said.
His shoes were recovered two days
later, but another theft aggravated
Fisher even more: "I went back to
Vaden to pick up my bike, and it was
gone. Somebody stole it. I guess be
cause it was just sitting there for three
days."
Medical costs — which can be sub
stantial for inpatient care — are an
other factor patients must deal with
after their release. At a daily rate of
$2,500. Fisher said his hospital bill to
taled $7.5(X) for treatment he actively

resisted.
"Luckily my insurance will cover
most of it,"he syid. "But what if 1 didn't
have insurance? How would I be able
to pay for that?"
Because psychiatric care constitutes
medical care. Dr. Brooks said the bill is
the patient's responsibility, regardless
of the circumstances that brought him
to the hospital. "That's one unfortu
nate aspect of the U.S. healthcare sys
tem." he said.
He compared a 5150 to another life
saving medical procedure: "Let's say
you have severe abdominal pain and a
fever, and go to the hospital where you
find out your appendix has to be taken
out. Afterwards, you say. Well, I don't
think I wanted it removed, even
though I could have died otherwise.'
That doesn't relieve you of the burden
of paying for the operation."
Fisher will stop out for the remain
der of the quarter, a decision that he
said was partly induced by his experi
ence at the ward and its aftermath. "I
was so exhausted after I got home," he
said. "I missed almost a week of class."
"I talked to my advisor and my dad
about it: we thought [stopping-out]
would be the best thing to do." he said.
"You know, start fresh next quarter."
Fisher said he is considering press
ing charges, but that he really just
wants an apology from his doctor at
Vaden and the H2 staff at Stanford
Hospital.
"I want them to acknowledge that
they made a mistake. I definitely
wouldn't want this to happen to anoth
er student."
If a patient is dissatisfied with treat
ment. Hu suggested three different op
tions of recourse. The patient can leave
specific feedback on a post-treatment
survey; he or she can file a complaint with
Stanford's Ombuds Office, which acts as
a mediator and is independent of Stan
ford Hospital; or the patient can take
legal action against the hospital by re
questing a free patient advocate to help
file suit at the Santa Clara courthouse.
Hu empathized with patients who
felt they were wrongly placed in the
ward, and like Brooks, she said the pri
mary goal of the 5150 law is to save lives.
"Nobody wants to be locked up for
longer than necessary," she said.
While Fisher has negative associa
tions with the ward, he recognized its
importance.
"A lot of people in there needed to
be treated like children. I don't doubt
the fact that it's an effective system
overall, but there are flaws in that sys
tem that 1 can attest to."
"I was a sane person going into an
