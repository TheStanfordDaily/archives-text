# Muslims join Hindus under the 'lights'

### ALIYYA HAQUE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At the Sanskriti Festival of Lights show on
Friday night, more than 450 people watched
Stanford students sing classic Indian songs, act
out scenes from religious mythology and dance
to the latest Bollywood tunes, all while enjoying
a catered Indian dinner.
Sanskriti. Stanford's South Asian student or
ganization. organized the event to celebrate the
religious festivals of Diwali and Eid. holy to
many South Asians. This year's event differed
from similar "Diwali shows" held in past years
by the group, which previously concentrated on
the one festival.
Senior Mehul Trivedi. one of Sanskriti's spe
cial events co-chairs and an organizer for the
Festival of Lights, said that the decision to alter
the theme for the event came as a result of the
organization wanting to reach out to as many
members of the South Asian community as pos
sible.
"The Diwali show was popular in previous
years, but we felt having this type of show was
not fair to all members of the community," he
said. "We wanted to create an event that was
more secular and South Asian rather than just
Hindu. Since lots of South Asian religions in
corporate the concept of lights into their holi
days, we thought that having a "Festival of
Lights' would be an ideal solution."
This year, Sanskriti solicited acts from a vari
ety of student organizations, including the Stan
ford India Association and the Muslim Students
Awareness Network, as well as staples from
past Sanskriti events such as Raagapella, an all
male South Asian a cappella group, and Noop
ur, an Indian classical dance team.
Sophomore Vivek Agrawal. who sings for
Raagapella, said this year's show was more sue-

cessful than last year's show.
"This year I felt that everything was very well
organized and that performing on stage was
more official and even more special than it was
last year," he said. "Last year, it seemed like the
show was thrown together a little more haphaz
ardly. It may he because Raagapella, as a group
on its own. is more official this year, but I still
feel that there was a huge difference in atmos
phere in performing on stage at Kresge last year
and performing on stage at McCaw Hall this
year."
Another major difference about the Festival
of Lights show was the change in the overall for
mat. In previous years, the Diwali show was a
performance event on stage. The Festival of
Lights, by contrast, was set up as a banquet, de
signed to invoke the experience of a family
gathering.
"It's around this time of year that people
start getting homesick and start thinking about
times spent with family and friends back home,"
Trivedi said. "We felt that the Diwali show
lacked this intimate feel, and so the banquet is
closer to what South Asians actually do during
these holidays, with good food, singing and gen
eral fun. It's our Stanford version of a family
dinner."
Several audience members who attended
both last year's and this year's shows felt that
the change to a more personal setting was a step
in the right direction.
"The smaller and less formal setting definite
ly created a warmer atmosphere." said sopho
more Taylor Penn. "The Festival of Lights was
more than just a show. We got to sit down, have
a meal and watch our friends perform on stage.
Experiencing great acts with great company
was what made the night really special."
Junior Katherine Hill also said that the set
up of the event enhanced her experience.

"The venue this year was much nicer, and it
seemed like a lot of time and effort was put into
the layout and decor of the hall. It really helped
enhance the atmosphere and make it seem all
the more special."
