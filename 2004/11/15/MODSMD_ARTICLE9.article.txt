# Playing it straight
## Lil' Coop goes north 
### 
Lil' Coop (Evan's younger
cousin) never fails to blow
our minds. After wreaking
12 years of relentless
havoc on the United States of
America, the Coopster is finally
headed north, to Canadia.
Coop, you see, is fed up with the
direction this great country of ours

has been
heading,
and 51 per
cent of his
compatri
ots recent
ly made his
decision to
bust-a
move to
Canada
real easy.
Coop,
the ever
precocious
and percep
tive prepu-

bescent, realizes that he'll have to
wait until 2012 to take part in our
haberdashery election process ...
far too long to justify being (bitch)
slapped with yet another four years
of absurd politicking.
A lot of things worry Lil' Coop
— alleged cooties, his gym teacher's
poor dental hygiene, his education
al opportunities under the No Child
Left Behind act and his civil rights
as a homosexual half Tibetan / half
Mozambique Mus-lim.The list goes
on. But this week, his worries start
and end with his impending transfer
to Canada.
We wanted to allay poor Coops
jittery jitters (Jello Jigglers) about
leaving the Land of Liberty. At the
very least, we wanted to send Coop
leavin' on a jet plane with a few
helpful tips. So we interviewed
those that might be able to offer the
most to our soon-to-be ex-patriot:
Stanford transfers.
We ravaged the halls of Arroyo,
Manzanita and FloMo for transfers
willing to share their stories. The
move to Canada may seem like a
walk in the park, but it might not be
such a lark. Likewise, coming to
Stanford might seem quite the
Jacuzzi, when it may in fact be quite
the doozie. Transfers came out of
the woodwork in impressive num
bers. but we've decided to highlight
three in particular: one from
Cornell, one from the Air Force,
and one from 'Bama. Bam!
As it turns out, the Cornell trans
fer lives with us. A couple Sundays
back. Mr. Cornell woke up. wan
dered into the common room, and
posed to us the following question:
"Did you know that you can solve n
factorial in log of n time?"
Certainly, we did not know this, but
more importantly, we did not care.
Sometimes, things are better left
unsaid.
Onto the Air Force. It's not such
a great place for the ladies. Rumor
has it there has been some sexual
harassment at the Academy.
Fortunately, safe haven from such
predatory conditions can be found
here, at such aptly themed dorms as
"Sado-Maso-Kimball." Ironi-cally,
studies have shown that no sexual
encounter has ever actually taken
place at Kimball. Sometimes, things
are not as they seem.
Finally, the guy from Bama. He
was just sick of paying and waiting
in line to go to SEC football games.
So, he actually got a scholarship to
come to Stanford and attend the
games as a fan. Next time you're at
a game (probably never),check him
out in section 103 (FREE FOR
STUDENTS!). He usually sits
alone. Sometimes, things just don't
change.
All in all. we fully support Lil'
Coop's transfer, and we wish the lit
tle guy all the best. Sometimes peo
ple just get fed up with their situa
tion and are forced to take matters
into their own hands. Mr. Cornell.
Ms. Air Force and Mr. 'Bama all
seem to be doing fine. Canucks will
certainly be hangin' with Mr.
Cooper in no time.
