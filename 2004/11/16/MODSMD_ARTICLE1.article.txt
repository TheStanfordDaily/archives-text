### DAVID HERBERT DESK EDITOR 
President George W. Bush is ex
pected to nominate National Security
Advisor Condoleeza Rice for the po
sition of Secretary of State today, a
cabinet post that will be vacated by
the resignation of Colin Powell.
Rice served as Stanford's Provost
from 1993 to 1999. If confirmed by
Congress, she would become the first
black woman and only the second fe
male appointed to the nation's top
diplomatic post.
A Hoover Fellow and staunch ad
vocate-of the Iraq war. Rice's conser
vative views have sometimes put her
at odds with Stanford students. Dur
ing her commencement address in

2002, about two dozen graduates
turned their hacks to Rice and at
tached red fliers to their mortar
boards to protest the Bush adminis
tration's policies.
Rice, 50, joined Stanford's faculty
in 1981. In 1984, she won the Univer
sity's Walter J. Gores Award for Ex
cellence in Teaching. As a political
science professor, she specializes in
Soviet affairs. She is on leave from
Stanford and the Hoover Institution.
No official announcement of
Rice's nomination had been made as
of The Daily's press time, though
ABC News, CNN and several other
news outlets cited senior administra
tion officials saying that Bush had
made his decision.
