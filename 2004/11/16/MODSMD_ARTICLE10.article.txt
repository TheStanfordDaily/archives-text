1966 — On Nov. 16, The Daily ran a
story about freshmen guarding a
bonfire to prevent a Cal sabotage.
Below is an excerpt:
"In keeping with the finest Cal
tradition, the Bears from Berkeley
are expected to try to sabotage the
bonfire and, in general, wreak mild
havoc this week on campus.
The bonfire committee, under
the able leadership of freshman Kirk
Brown, is anxious that their bonfire
will not be ignited prematurely be
fore about 7 o'clock Friday (the day
before Big Game]. Therefore, they
are taking elaborate precautions.
According to Brown, the tele
phone poles now in Lagunita, which
will serve as the bonfire's skeleton,
will be under guard 25 hours a day
this week. About a half dozen fresh
men man their posts during the day.
At night about 40 men are on duty.
Two safari tents have been set up to
accommodate the all-night men. and
periodic patrols are made around
the perimeter of Lagunita.
As of yesterday afternoon, the
Bears had made no attempts on the
telephone poles. The men on guard
said they were not expecting any
trouble, since it was broad daylight
and the fraternity clusters were just a
short distance away. The guards in
tended, nevertheless, to stay on the
alert.
While one group of freshmen is
keeping watch in Lake Lag at night,
another group will be roaming the
campus to keep an eye out for suspi
cious looking chracters. With the
guidance and encouragement of the
Axe Committee, about a dozen
freshmen per night will be co-oper
ating with the Stanford police to try
to prevent a recurrence of the sign
painting incidents of last week."
1992 — On Nov. 16 The Daily ran a
story about nearly 500 staff members
retiring early to take advantage of in
centives offered by the University.
Below is an excerpt:
"For 62-year-old Lorraine

Yahnke, who worked in the Medical
Center for 21 years, Stanford's Staff
Early Retirement Incentive (SERI)
program helped her decide to retire.
It gave [me an incentive] to leave,
and security to g on," said Yahnke,
who was employed in the Medical
Specialty and Oncology Depart
ment. "My husband asked me to do
this so we could be together."
Since her retirement Aug. 1,
Yahnke had pursued her love of art,
traveled to visit family, and bought a
van.
Faced with shrinking budgets, the
University implemented the SERI
program to decrease the amount of
money it spends on staff salaries
without having to resort to layoffs,
according to Keith Smith, manager
of Employee Relations. Officials
said the program succeeded beyond
their expectations.
SERI offered severance pay and
official retiree benefits to staff mem
bers who decided to retire before at
taining 'official retiree' status-reach
ing the age of 55 and completing at
least 10 years of service to the Uni
versity. Those employees who age
and number of years worked at the
University totaled at least 75 were
allowed to claim retiree status as
well.
Under the SERI program, 1,280
staff members were eligible to retire.
These staff members included non
tenure track faculty, senior research
associates, senior lecturers and Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
staff.
Mary Ann Mendonza, a retire
ment counselor in the Benefits Of
fice and former project manager for
the benefits program, said SERI was
very successful because more people
than expected took advantage of it.
'The goal was one-third (430) of
the 1.280 persons who met the crite
ria,' she said. 'The final count was
497. From a numbers perspective, it
was successful.'"
