## Mozilla Firefox browser blazes through globe 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Like David and Goliath, the Mozilla
Foundation — a small, nonprofit organiza
tion offering open-source software — is set
to battle the software giant Microsoft in the
realm of Internet browsers.
Mozilla's weapon of choice against its
Goliath? Mozilla Firefox 1.0: A super-fast
Web browser, in part created by Stanford
sophomore Blake Ross, set to compete
against Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
As in the parable, the little guy's chances
are looking good. Last Tuesday, the day
Mozilla Firefox was released, over one mil
lion people downloaded the browser. People
on all seven continents are downloading and
using the browser — yes, even a research
group in Antarctica is surfing the Web with
Mozilla Firefox.
Balancing his time between classes and the
development of the browser, Ross has been
working part-time at Mozilla to develop the
project and remains part of the Mozilla Firefox
core team. The release of Mozilla Firefox has
certainly made a mark in Web culture: Ross
has been interviewed by major publications
such as USA Today, as well as with online
zines such as Business 2.0.
Although the process has certainly been
exhausting, Ross said he is eager to witness his
creation take full flight.
"It's exciting because open-source soft
ware hadn't really taken off until Firefox,"
Ross said. "Other open-source products
were more for techie people and weren't re
ally developed for the user."
Ross started working on building "a bet
ter" browser while other kids were just get
ting hooked on instant messenger. He
worked on the earlier versions of Netscape at
the age of 14 and eventually interned for the
company following his freshman year of high
school.
Although he enjoyed the experience,
Ross found working at Netscape to be some
what frustrating.
"Larger open-source companies usually
have a group of 50 people making decisions
on the interface," Ross said. "Basically, if
someone wants to have something in the
software, they'll include it. There's no review
process. So a friend of mine — David Hyatt,
who now works at Apple — and I started to
work on an experimental browser based on
the Netscape code."
Their first browser came to be known as
Phoenix. The duo promoted the browser to
the Mozilla Foundation and began working on
fixing the bugs, asking a group of volunteers
around the world to help develop the software.
Phoenix developed into another version,
which they deemed Firebird, which developed
into the final version, the now-famous Mozilla
Firefox.
Open source software:
A global effort to improve technology
The Mozilla Foundation, based in Moun
tain View, Calif., was established in July of

last year and is supported by the Netscape di
vision of American Online. Unlike compa
nies such as Microsoft, which keep their in
formation closely guarded, Mozilla encour
ages programmers to nitpick through the
software and make improvements. Users
who locate bugs are highly encouraged to re
port them.
Kevin Christopher, a senior and resident

computer consultant
for Faisan. said that he
has been using
browsers other than In
ternet Explorer fora
few years and distrusts
Microsoft's products.
He said he prefers
using open-source soft
ware.
"The concern 1
share with a lot of other
people is a general lack
of confidence in Mi
crosoft's code: We
don't really know what
is well-written versus
what is held together
by duct tape." Christo
pher said. "When it
comes to the safety of
my computer, I'm
trusting the application
where independent ex
perts can examine the
source code, instead of
relying on Microsoft's
promises."
Firefox vs. Explorer:
Round one

The Mozilla Foundation is only a tiny or
ganization compared to the market-domi
nating behemoth, but Mozilla Firefox is al
ready making a dent in Web browsing usage.
Since June of this year, Mozilla's share of
Web browsing increased three percentage
points: Microsoft's share, on the other hand,
slipped three, according to the Internet
usage tracker WebSideStory.
"I think Microsoft is getting a little ner
vous," Ross said. "They aren't sleeping any
more. They're talking about us on their We
blog and have started to contact the press
about us."
Prof. Mendel Rosenbluni in the Comput
er Science Department said he thought that
Mozilla presented an interesting challenge
for Microsoft.
"Browser innovation at Microsoft pro
ceeded very rapidly up to the point they suf
ficiently crushed Netscape, and then it total
ly stopped," Rosenblum said. "Having a
good open-source browser that appears to be
evolving very quickly exposes Microsoft to
the risk that Mozilla will get good enough to
start luring folks to it."
If anything, Ross just wants to see a better
browser available for the general public. He
noted the dissatisfaction with Internet Ex
plorer among his colleagues and peers and
said he believed Internet browsing could be

faster and more efficient.
"Before Firefox. [Microsoft's] Internet
Explorer team had basically disbanded."
Ross explained. "They weren't really mak
ing any improvements on the browser be
cause they already dominated the market.
These days, we've heard that they have
about 100 people working on the team and
have started to market Internet Explorer —

something they didn't do before."
Aware of Microsoft's power, Ross is hop
ing Firefox will not fall to the same doom as
Netscape.
"The goal, though, is to build a solid base
of [Mozilla Firefox] users." he said. "I don't
think we're going to lose here — there are al
ready so many of them."
So why are people making the switch?
Mozilla Firefox has a few features that
may drag users away from Internet Explorer.
It is a fairly small file that downloads and in
stalls quickly — downloading takes about
two or three minutes — and is easy to use.
During installation, users have an option to
import preferences, stored passwords, book
marks and cookies from past versions of
Mozilla, Netscape and Internet Explorer,
making the transition seamless.
Firefox also offers a popup blocker and
includes an array of toolbars — Google,
Amazon.com, Dictionary.com, Ebay.com.
Yahoo and Creative Commons — saving
users time when searching. The partnership
with these companies benefits both the con
sumer and Mozilla itself, as it makes for easier
searching and also partly funds the browser.
One of the novel features is the tab op
tion, which allows users to open several Web
sites at once in the same window. Addition
ally, along with traditional bookmarks.

Mozilla Firefox also offers "Live Book
marks," which give people the chance to
read automated updates of sites they sub
scribe to, such as news or Weblog sites.
Perhaps one of the most compelling rea
sons to switch to Firefox, however, is securi
ty. Hackers typically attack the market giant
— Internet Explorer, in the world of Web
browsing — leaving Firefox relatively safe

and sound.
Andrew Vogel, a
senior and computer
science major, has
been using alterna
tives to Internet Ex
plorer fora while and
is strong supporter of
Firefox.
"I went through
Netscape and Opera
fora while but eventu
ally settled on Mozilla,
and then Firefox —
the quicker, more hip
version of Mozilla —
based on its speed,
size, ease of use and
tabbed browsing,"
said Vogel, who works
as an RCC at Durand.
"Recently, there
have been security
concerns over Inter
net Explorer, and that
has turned out to rein
force my decision and
prompted me to en
courage my residents
to use alternative

browsers," he added.
While Firefox could he hacked in the fu
ture, Firefox's open source feature allows for
vulnerabilities to be fixed more quickly. For
now, the fact that fewer people use Firefox
means that fewer people are actively in
volved in hacking it.
"Most people write exploits for Internet
Explorer — virus exploits, malware, spy
ware, adware, everything — and so, for now,
security-through-obscurity is still fairly ef
fective," Vogel added.
Additionally, Mozilla Firefox does not
load ActiveX controls, one of the main vul
nerabilities of Microsoft's browser. And Ac
tiveX controls are not necessary for most
Web sites. Christopher explained.
"ActiveX controls are downloadable
mini-programs that run within your web
browser — for example, the program that
detects which Windows Updates you already
have," Christopher said. "It turns out Java is
just as powerful and an easier language to
use. Plus, a bug in the security model of Ac
tiveX — and there have been several — can
allow a malicious ActiveX control to gain
control of your computer. Java has a stronger
security model."
Mozilla Firefox is not completely immune
to attacks, but the fact that it is not wholly in
tegrated into the Windows operating system
makes it more difficult to get into sensitive
files or to corrupt other Windows-integrated

programs.
"Microsoft has tried to convince users
that they need or want to have the browser
coupled into every Microsoft application and
vice versa, and tried to convince the govern
ment and European anti-trust people that
the browser needs to be strongly coupled
into the operating system," said Computer
Science Prof. David Cheriton.
"However, in my opinion, experience has
shown that this business-driven rationale has
led to software that is too integrated' to be
secure against viruses — kind of like having
a heart attack every time you have a
headache." Cheriton added.
Mozilla Firefox, for all of its merits, has
drawn its share of criticisms. One main com
plaint made by critics is that the browser
cannot open sites or requires plug-ins that
are already part of Internet Explorer.
"The biggest weakness is clearly that Web
sites design and test their site with the domi
nant browsers — different versions of Inter
net Explorer — and frequently never get
around to making sure it works with Mozil
la," Rosenblum explained. "This isn't super
common, but there are Web sites that don't
work with Mozilla"
Future of the Firefox team?
What's next for Ross and the young
Mozilla Firefox team? Fame? Fortune?
It's looking that way.
At the age of 19, Ross is busy planning a
Palo Alto-based start-up with a small group
of people, developing Mozilla Firefox fur
ther and working to partner with companies
so he can customize his software to their
needs and provide tech support.
The Mozilla Firefox team may also work
on a desktop search function, much like
Google's product.
Meanwhile. Ross will be busy promoting
his creation all over the world. He plans on ad
vertising through posters, logo merchandise,
thefacebook.com and other college sites.
"Word spreads quickly on a college cam
pus," he said. "If you can become the next
Napster or the next thefacebook.com,
you've got it made."
Stanford, a tech-savvy campus, has al
ready caught on to the trend. Several stu
dents and professors interviewed had been
using the Mozilla browser fora few years and
had recently downloaded the 1.0 version of
Mozilla Firefox.
The way most people hear about it? Word
of mouth.
"1 first made the switch to Firefox after
the security holes in Internet Explorer were
announced," said senior Brian Lichtenstein.
"It seemed to make sense to use a browser
that wasn't so faulty and I had heard good
things from my techie-er friends."
Although Ross said he is working hard to
promote the software, he is still taken aback
when he sees notice of it pop up in random
places.
"I saw someone biking in White Plaza
with a Firefox shirt the other day,"he said.
"It was cool — and — surprising. We're re
ally getting the word out there."
As much as he enjoys the fame and suc
cess of his software, Ross is looking to
enjoy the rest of his time at Stanford.
"I'm planning on working really, really
hard for six months, getting this start-up off
the ground and when we hit it big, I can live
a normal college life," Ross said. "You
know, leave my room, see people. That
would be good."

While Firefox could he hacked in the fu

vulnerabilities to be fixed more quickly. For
now, the fact that fewer people use Firefox
means that fewer people are actively in
volved in hacking it.
"Most people write exploits for Internet
Explorer — virus exploits, malware, spy
ware, adware, everything — and so, for now,
security-through-obscurity is still fairly ef
fective," Vogel added.
Additionally, Mozilla Firefox does not
load ActiveX controls, one of the main vul
nerabilities of Microsoft's browser. And Ac
tiveX controls are not necessary for most
Web sites. Christopher explained.
"ActiveX controls are downloadable
mini-programs that run within your web
browser — for example, the program that
detects which Windows Updates you already
have," Christopher said. "It turns out Java is
just as powerful and an easier language to
use. Plus, a bug in the security model of Ac
tiveX — and there have been several — can
allow a malicious ActiveX control to gain
control of your computer. Java has a stronger
security model."
Mozilla Firefox is not completely immune
to attacks, but the fact that it is not wholly in
tegrated into the Windows operating system
makes it more difficult to get into sensitive
files or to corrupt other Windows-integrated

programs.
"Microsoft has tried to convince users
that they need or want to have the browser
coupled into every Microsoft application and
vice versa, and tried to convince the govern
ment and European anti-trust people that
the browser needs to be strongly coupled
into the operating system," said Computer
Science Prof. David Cheriton.
"However, in my opinion, experience has
shown that this business-driven rationale has
led to software that is too integrated' to be
secure against viruses — kind of like having
a heart attack every time you have a
headache." Cheriton added.
Mozilla Firefox, for all of its merits, has
drawn its share of criticisms. One main com
plaint made by critics is that the browser
cannot open sites or requires plug-ins that
are already part of Internet Explorer.
"The biggest weakness is clearly that Web
sites design and test their site with the domi
nant browsers — different versions of Inter
net Explorer — and frequently never get
around to making sure it works with Mozil
la," Rosenblum explained. "This isn't super
common, but there are Web sites that don't
work with Mozilla"
Future of the Firefox team?
What's next for Ross and the young
Mozilla Firefox team? Fame? Fortune?
It's looking that way.
At the age of 19, Ross is busy planning a
Palo Alto-based start-up with a small group
of people, developing Mozilla Firefox fur
ther and working to partner with companies
so he can customize his software to their
needs and provide tech support.
The Mozilla Firefox team may also work
on a desktop search function, much like
Google's product.
Meanwhile. Ross will be busy promoting
his creation all over the world. He plans on ad
vertising through posters, logo merchandise,
thefacebook.com and other college sites.
"Word spreads quickly on a college cam
pus," he said. "If you can become the next
Napster or the next thefacebook.com,
you've got it made."
Stanford, a tech-savvy campus, has al
ready caught on to the trend. Several stu
dents and professors interviewed had been
using the Mozilla browser fora few years and
had recently downloaded the 1.0 version of
Mozilla Firefox.
The way most people hear about it? Word
of mouth.
"1 first made the switch to Firefox after
the security holes in Internet Explorer were
announced," said senior Brian Lichtenstein.
"It seemed to make sense to use a browser
that wasn't so faulty and I had heard good
things from my techie-er friends."
Although Ross said he is working hard to
promote the software, he is still taken aback
when he sees notice of it pop up in random
places.
"I saw someone biking in White Plaza
with a Firefox shirt the other day,"he said.
"It was cool — and — surprising. We're re
ally getting the word out there."
As much as he enjoys the fame and suc

enjoy the rest of his time at Stanford.
"I'm planning on working really, really
hard for six months, getting this start-up off
the ground and when we hit it big, I can live

JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily
Like David and Goliath, the Mozilla
Foundation — a small, nonprofit organiza
tion offering open-source software — is set
to battle the software giant Microsoft in the
realm of Internet browsers.
Mozilla's weapon of choice against its
Goliath? Mozilla Firefox 1.0: A super-fast
Web browser, in part created by Stanford
sophomore Blake Ross, set to compete
against Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
As in the parable, the little guy's chances
are looking good. Last Tuesday, the day
Mozilla Firefox was released, over one mil
lion people downloaded the browser. People
on all seven continents are downloading and
using the browser — yes, even a research
group in Antarctica is surfing the Web with
Mozilla Firefox.
Balancing his time between classes and the
development of the browser, Ross has been
working part-time at Mozilla to develop the
project and remains part of the Mozilla Firefox
core team. The release of Mozilla Firefox has
certainly made a mark in Web culture: Ross
has been interviewed by major publications
such as USA Today, as well as with online
zines such as Business 2.0.
Although the process has certainly been
exhausting, Ross said he is eager to witness his
creation take full flight.
"It's exciting because open-source soft
ware hadn't really taken off until Firefox,"
Ross said. "Other open-source products
were more for techie people and weren't re
ally developed for the user."
Ross started working on building "a bet
ter" browser while other kids were just get
ting hooked on instant messenger. He
worked on the earlier versions of Netscape at
the age of 14 and eventually interned for the
company following his freshman year of high
school.
Although he enjoyed the experience,
Ross found working at Netscape to be some
what frustrating.
"Larger open-source companies usually
have a group of 50 people making decisions
on the interface," Ross said. "Basically, if
someone wants to have something in the
software, they'll include it. There's no review
process. So a friend of mine — David Hyatt,
who now works at Apple — and I started to
work on an experimental browser based on
the Netscape code."
Their first browser came to be known as
Phoenix. The duo promoted the browser to
the Mozilla Foundation and began working on
fixing the bugs, asking a group of volunteers
around the world to help develop the software.
Phoenix developed into another version,
which they deemed Firebird, which developed
into the final version, the now-famous Mozilla
Firefox.
Open source software:
A global effort to improve technology
The Mozilla Foundation, based in Moun
tain View, Calif., was established in July of

last year and is supported by the Netscape di
vision of American Online. Unlike compa
nies such as Microsoft, which keep their in
formation closely guarded, Mozilla encour
ages programmers to nitpick through the
software and make improvements. Users
who locate bugs are highly encouraged to re
port them.
Kevin Christopher, a senior and resident

computer consultant
for Faisan. said that he
has been using
browsers other than In
ternet Explorer fora
few years and distrusts
Microsoft's products.
He said he prefers
using open-source soft
ware.
"The concern 1
share with a lot of other
people is a general lack
of confidence in Mi
crosoft's code: We
don't really know what
is well-written versus
what is held together
by duct tape." Christo
pher said. "When it
comes to the safety of
my computer, I'm
trusting the application
where independent ex
perts can examine the
source code, instead of
relying on Microsoft's
promises."
Firefox vs. Explorer:
Round one

The Mozilla Foundation is only a tiny or
ganization compared to the market-domi
nating behemoth, but Mozilla Firefox is al
ready making a dent in Web browsing usage.
Since June of this year, Mozilla's share of
Web browsing increased three percentage
points: Microsoft's share, on the other hand,
slipped three, according to the Internet
usage tracker WebSideStory.
"I think Microsoft is getting a little ner
vous," Ross said. "They aren't sleeping any
more. They're talking about us on their We
blog and have started to contact the press
about us."
Prof. Mendel Rosenbluni in the Comput
er Science Department said he thought that
Mozilla presented an interesting challenge
for Microsoft.
"Browser innovation at Microsoft pro
ceeded very rapidly up to the point they suf
ficiently crushed Netscape, and then it total
ly stopped," Rosenblum said. "Having a
good open-source browser that appears to be
evolving very quickly exposes Microsoft to
the risk that Mozilla will get good enough to
start luring folks to it."
If anything, Ross just wants to see a better
browser available for the general public. He
noted the dissatisfaction with Internet Ex
plorer among his colleagues and peers and
said he believed Internet browsing could be

faster and more efficient.
"Before Firefox. [Microsoft's] Internet
Explorer team had basically disbanded."
Ross explained. "They weren't really mak
ing any improvements on the browser be
cause they already dominated the market.
These days, we've heard that they have
about 100 people working on the team and
have started to market Internet Explorer —

something they didn't do before."
Aware of Microsoft's power, Ross is hop
ing Firefox will not fall to the same doom as
Netscape.
"The goal, though, is to build a solid base
of [Mozilla Firefox] users." he said. "I don't
think we're going to lose here — there are al
ready so many of them."
So why are people making the switch?
Mozilla Firefox has a few features that
may drag users away from Internet Explorer.
It is a fairly small file that downloads and in
stalls quickly — downloading takes about
two or three minutes — and is easy to use.
During installation, users have an option to
import preferences, stored passwords, book
marks and cookies from past versions of
Mozilla, Netscape and Internet Explorer,
making the transition seamless.
Firefox also offers a popup blocker and
includes an array of toolbars — Google,
Amazon.com, Dictionary.com, Ebay.com.
Yahoo and Creative Commons — saving
users time when searching. The partnership
with these companies benefits both the con
sumer and Mozilla itself, as it makes for easier
searching and also partly funds the browser.
One of the novel features is the tab op
tion, which allows users to open several Web
sites at once in the same window. Addition
ally, along with traditional bookmarks.

Mozilla Firefox also offers "Live Book
marks," which give people the chance to
read automated updates of sites they sub
scribe to, such as news or Weblog sites.
Perhaps one of the most compelling rea
sons to switch to Firefox, however, is securi
ty. Hackers typically attack the market giant
— Internet Explorer, in the world of Web
browsing — leaving Firefox relatively safe

and sound.
Andrew Vogel, a
senior and computer
science major, has
been using alterna
tives to Internet Ex
plorer fora while and
is strong supporter of
Firefox.
"I went through
Netscape and Opera
fora while but eventu
ally settled on Mozilla,
and then Firefox —
the quicker, more hip
version of Mozilla —
based on its speed,
size, ease of use and
tabbed browsing,"
said Vogel, who works
as an RCC at Durand.
"Recently, there
have been security
concerns over Inter
net Explorer, and that
has turned out to rein
force my decision and
prompted me to en
courage my residents
to use alternative

browsers," he added.
While Firefox could he hacked in the fu
ture, Firefox's open source feature allows for
vulnerabilities to be fixed more quickly. For
now, the fact that fewer people use Firefox
means that fewer people are actively in
volved in hacking it.
"Most people write exploits for Internet
Explorer — virus exploits, malware, spy
ware, adware, everything — and so, for now,
security-through-obscurity is still fairly ef
fective," Vogel added.
Additionally, Mozilla Firefox does not
load ActiveX controls, one of the main vul
nerabilities of Microsoft's browser. And Ac
tiveX controls are not necessary for most
Web sites. Christopher explained.
"ActiveX controls are downloadable
mini-programs that run within your web
browser — for example, the program that
detects which Windows Updates you already
have," Christopher said. "It turns out Java is
just as powerful and an easier language to
use. Plus, a bug in the security model of Ac
tiveX — and there have been several — can
allow a malicious ActiveX control to gain
control of your computer. Java has a stronger
security model."
Mozilla Firefox is not completely immune
to attacks, but the fact that it is not wholly in
tegrated into the Windows operating system
makes it more difficult to get into sensitive
files or to corrupt other Windows-integrated

programs.
"Microsoft has tried to convince users

Firefox vs. Explorer:
Round one

The Mozilla Foundation is only a tiny or
ganization compared to the market-domi
nating behemoth, but Mozilla Firefox is al
ready making a dent in Web browsing usage.
Since June of this year, Mozilla's share of
Web browsing increased three percentage
points: Microsoft's share, on the other hand,
slipped three, according to the Internet
usage tracker WebSideStory.
"I think Microsoft is getting a little ner
vous," Ross said. "They aren't sleeping any
more. They're talking about us on their We
blog and have started to contact the press
about us."
Prof. Mendel Rosenbluni in the Comput
er Science Department said he thought that
Mozilla presented an interesting challenge
for Microsoft.
"Browser innovation at Microsoft pro
ceeded very rapidly up to the point they suf
ficiently crushed Netscape, and then it total
ly stopped," Rosenblum said. "Having a
good open-source browser that appears to be
evolving very quickly exposes Microsoft to
the risk that Mozilla will get good enough to
start luring folks to it."
If anything, Ross just wants to see a better
browser available for the general public. He
noted the dissatisfaction with Internet Ex
plorer among his colleagues and peers and
said he believed Internet browsing could be

faster and more efficient.
"Before Firefox. [Microsoft's] Internet
Explorer team had basically disbanded."
Ross explained. "They weren't really mak
ing any improvements on the browser be
cause they already dominated the market.
These days, we've heard that they have
about 100 people working on the team and
have started to market Internet Explorer —

something they didn't do before."
Aware of Microsoft's power, Ross is hop
ing Firefox will not fall to the same doom as
Netscape.
"The goal, though, is to build a solid base
of [Mozilla Firefox] users." he said. "I don't
think we're going to lose here — there are al
ready so many of them."
So why are people making the switch?
Mozilla Firefox has a few features that
may drag users away from Internet Explorer.
It is a fairly small file that downloads and in
stalls quickly — downloading takes about
two or three minutes — and is easy to use.
During installation, users have an option to
import preferences, stored passwords, book
marks and cookies from past versions of
Mozilla, Netscape and Internet Explorer,
making the transition seamless.
Firefox also offers a popup blocker and
includes an array of toolbars — Google,
Amazon.com, Dictionary.com, Ebay.com.
Yahoo and Creative Commons — saving
users time when searching. The partnership
with these companies benefits both the con
sumer and Mozilla itself, as it makes for easier
searching and also partly funds the browser.
One of the novel features is the tab op
tion, which allows users to open several Web
sites at once in the same window. Addition
ally, along with traditional bookmarks.

Mozilla Firefox also offers "Live Book
marks," which give people the chance to
read automated updates of sites they sub
scribe to, such as news or Weblog sites.
Perhaps one of the most compelling rea
sons to switch to Firefox, however, is securi
ty. Hackers typically attack the market giant
— Internet Explorer, in the world of Web
browsing — leaving Firefox relatively safe

and sound.
Andrew Vogel, a
senior and computer
science major, has
been using alterna
tives to Internet Ex
plorer fora while and
is strong supporter of
Firefox.
"I went through
Netscape and Opera
fora while but eventu
ally settled on Mozilla,
and then Firefox —
the quicker, more hip
version of Mozilla —
based on its speed,
size, ease of use and
tabbed browsing,"
said Vogel, who works
as an RCC at Durand.
"Recently, there
have been security
concerns over Inter
net Explorer, and that
has turned out to rein
force my decision and
prompted me to en
courage my residents
to use alternative

browsers," he added.
While Firefox could he hacked in the fu
ture, Firefox's open source feature allows for
vulnerabilities to be fixed more quickly. For
now, the fact that fewer people use Firefox
means that fewer people are actively in
volved in hacking it.
"Most people write exploits for Internet
Explorer — virus exploits, malware, spy
ware, adware, everything — and so, for now,
security-through-obscurity is still fairly ef
fective," Vogel added.
Additionally, Mozilla Firefox does not
load ActiveX controls, one of the main vul
nerabilities of Microsoft's browser. And Ac
tiveX controls are not necessary for most
Web sites. Christopher explained.
"ActiveX controls are downloadable
mini-programs that run within your web
browser — for example, the program that
detects which Windows Updates you already
have," Christopher said. "It turns out Java is
just as powerful and an easier language to
use. Plus, a bug in the security model of Ac
tiveX — and there have been several — can
allow a malicious ActiveX control to gain
control of your computer. Java has a stronger
security model."
Mozilla Firefox is not completely immune
to attacks, but the fact that it is not wholly in
tegrated into the Windows operating system
makes it more difficult to get into sensitive
files or to corrupt other Windows-integrated

programs.
"Microsoft has tried to convince users
that they need or want to have the browser
coupled into every Microsoft application and
vice versa, and tried to convince the govern
ment and European anti-trust people that
the browser needs to be strongly coupled
into the operating system," said Computer
Science Prof. David Cheriton.
"However, in my opinion, experience has
shown that this business-driven rationale has
led to software that is too integrated' to be
secure against viruses — kind of like having
a heart attack every time you have a
headache." Cheriton added.
Mozilla Firefox, for all of its merits, has
drawn its share of criticisms. One main com
plaint made by critics is that the browser
cannot open sites or requires plug-ins that
are already part of Internet Explorer.
"The biggest weakness is clearly that Web
sites design and test their site with the domi
nant browsers — different versions of Inter
net Explorer — and frequently never get
around to making sure it works with Mozil
la," Rosenblum explained. "This isn't super
common, but there are Web sites that don't
work with Mozilla"
Future of the Firefox team?
What's next for Ross and the young
Mozilla Firefox team? Fame? Fortune?
It's looking that way.
At the age of 19, Ross is busy planning a
Palo Alto-based start-up with a small group
of people, developing Mozilla Firefox fur
ther and working to partner with companies
so he can customize his software to their
needs and provide tech support.
The Mozilla Firefox team may also work
on a desktop search function, much like
Google's product.
Meanwhile. Ross will be busy promoting
his creation all over the world. He plans on ad
vertising through posters, logo merchandise,
thefacebook.com and other college sites.
"Word spreads quickly on a college cam
pus," he said. "If you can become the next
Napster or the next thefacebook.com,
you've got it made."
Stanford, a tech-savvy campus, has al
ready caught on to the trend. Several stu
dents and professors interviewed had been
using the Mozilla browser fora few years and
had recently downloaded the 1.0 version of
Mozilla Firefox.
The way most people hear about it? Word
of mouth.
"1 first made the switch to Firefox after
the security holes in Internet Explorer were
announced," said senior Brian Lichtenstein.
"It seemed to make sense to use a browser
that wasn't so faulty and I had heard good
things from my techie-er friends."
Although Ross said he is working hard to
promote the software, he is still taken aback
when he sees notice of it pop up in random
places.
"I saw someone biking in White Plaza
with a Firefox shirt the other day,"he said.
"It was cool — and — surprising. We're re
ally getting the word out there."
As much as he enjoys the fame and suc
cess of his software, Ross is looking to
enjoy the rest of his time at Stanford.
"I'm planning on working really, really
hard for six months, getting this start-up off
the ground and when we hit it big, I can live
a normal college life," Ross said. "You
know, leave my room, see people. That
would be good."


JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily
Like David and Goliath, the Mozilla
Foundation — a small, nonprofit organiza
tion offering open-source software — is set
to battle the software giant Microsoft in the
realm of Internet browsers.
Mozilla's weapon of choice against its
Goliath? Mozilla Firefox 1.0: A super-fast
Web browser, in part created by Stanford
sophomore Blake Ross, set to compete
against Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
As in the parable, the little guy's chances
are looking good. Last Tuesday, the day
Mozilla Firefox was released, over one mil
lion people downloaded the browser. People
on all seven continents are downloading and
using the browser — yes, even a research
group in Antarctica is surfing the Web with
Mozilla Firefox.
Balancing his time between classes and the
development of the browser, Ross has been
working part-time at Mozilla to develop the
project and remains part of the Mozilla Firefox
core team. The release of Mozilla Firefox has
certainly made a mark in Web culture: Ross
has been interviewed by major publications
such as USA Today, as well as with online
zines such as Business 2.0.
Although the process has certainly been
exhausting, Ross said he is eager to witness his
creation take full flight.
"It's exciting because open-source soft
ware hadn't really taken off until Firefox,"
Ross said. "Other open-source products
were more for techie people and weren't re
ally developed for the user."
Ross started working on building "a bet
ter" browser while other kids were just get
ting hooked on instant messenger. He
worked on the earlier versions of Netscape at
the age of 14 and eventually interned for the
company following his freshman year of high
school.
Although he enjoyed the experience,
Ross found working at Netscape to be some
what frustrating.
"Larger open-source companies usually
have a group of 50 people making decisions
on the interface," Ross said. "Basically, if
someone wants to have something in the
software, they'll include it. There's no review
process. So a friend of mine — David Hyatt,
who now works at Apple — and I started to
work on an experimental browser based on
the Netscape code."
Their first browser came to be known as
Phoenix. The duo promoted the browser to
the Mozilla Foundation and began working on
fixing the bugs, asking a group of volunteers
around the world to help develop the software.
Phoenix developed into another version,
which they deemed Firebird, which developed
into the final version, the now-famous Mozilla
Firefox.
Open source software:
A global effort to improve technology
The Mozilla Foundation, based in Moun
tain View, Calif., was established in July of

last year and is supported by the Netscape di
vision of American Online. Unlike compa
nies such as Microsoft, which keep their in
formation closely guarded, Mozilla encour
ages programmers to nitpick through the
software and make improvements. Users
who locate bugs are highly encouraged to re
port them.
Kevin Christopher, a senior and resident

computer consultant
for Faisan. said that he
has been using
browsers other than In
ternet Explorer fora
few years and distrusts
Microsoft's products.
He said he prefers
using open-source soft

pus," he said. "If you can become the next
Napster or the next thefacebook.com,
you've got it made."
Stanford, a tech-savvy campus, has al
ready caught on to the trend. Several stu
dents and professors interviewed had been
using the Mozilla browser fora few years and
had recently downloaded the 1.0 version of
Mozilla Firefox.
The way most people hear about it? Word
of mouth.
"1 first made the switch to Firefox after
the security holes in Internet Explorer were
announced," said senior Brian Lichtenstein.
"It seemed to make sense to use a browser
that wasn't so faulty and I had heard good
things from my techie-er friends."
Although Ross said he is working hard to
promote the software, he is still taken aback
when he sees notice of it pop up in random
places.
"I saw someone biking in White Plaza
with a Firefox shirt the other day,"he said.
"It was cool — and — surprising. We're re
ally getting the word out there."
As much as he enjoys the fame and suc
cess of his software, Ross is looking to
enjoy the rest of his time at Stanford.
"I'm planning on working really, really
hard for six months, getting this start-up off
the ground and when we hit it big, I can live
a normal college life," Ross said. "You
know, leave my room, see people. That
would be good."
