# Buy? Sell? How do you make up your mind? Students and researchers explore the field of neuroeconomics

Consider a familiar scene: You walk into
the supermarket and head for the beverage
aisle in hopes of quenching your thirst. In
front of you lies a myriad of choices. Coke and
Pepsi sit before you — nearly identical colas.
In your mind, however, an area of your
brain has preferentially chosen Coke — and
your choice was not wholly associated with
taste. Brand loyalty, it turns out, may be
etched into your brain.
How do researchers look at brand loyalty,
purchasing decisions and risk taking in busi
ness? Using the rapidly emerging field of neu
roeconomics.
A fairly new area of study, neuroeco
nomics combines economics, neuroscience
and psychology to examine how the brain
makes economic decisions and acquires per
sonal preferences. The fusion of these two
fields — neuroscience and economics — has
implications that affect all types of people,
from the everyday consumer to the corporate
head to the political candidate.
The common individual might learn that
his or her shopping habits, movie reactions or
investment decisions are a matter of brand
loyalty. The CEO of a company may gain
powerful insight into the way advertising im
presses or turns off the public. A political
campaign could discover the secrets to gar

nering extra votes on election day.
A neuroeconomics course is offered for
the first time at Stanford by the Psychology
and Economics Departments, introducing
undergraduate and graduate students to this
new field. Taught by Economics Asst. Prof.
Antonio Rangel and Psychology Assoc. Prof.
Brian Knutson, the course is a research-based
seminar and consists of 30 students, half un
dergraduates and half graduates. Students
have experience and expertise in the areas of
biology, economics, neuroscience, psycholo
gy and symbolic systems, making for interdis
ciplinary class discussions.
According to Rangel, the class examines a
broad range of topics. Students discuss how
people evaluate goods and keep in mind
things that might not be in front of them when
making decisions. They study risk-taking be
havior, decision-making processes and addic
tion. The course attempts to apply the re
searchers' understanding of neuroscience
concepts to economic and social policy deci
sions.
Cliff Baum, a senior who once declared
himself an economics major but has since
switched over to psychology, is taking the
course.
"It's an interesting topic." Baum said. "It
integrates every thing I've studied in my track
at Stanford."
Eva Patil, a senior majoring in psychology

with an emphasis in neuroscience, agreed.
"I needed a class to fulfill my neuroscience
track, and neuroeconomics seemed very dif
ferent from the other classes," Patil said. "It
was intriguing."
Although Patil has never taken an eco
nomics course on the college level, she finds
the class consists of a good mix of economics
in psychology.
"It's interesting, much more applicable
than I thought it would be," she said. "A lot of
what we study is policy-oriented. |We deal
with the topic of] addiction — do I use the
drug again? How should the government deal
with addiction and drugs?"
Baum said he thought the development of
the field just made common sense.
"How the brain makes decisions is implic
it in the realm of economics," he said.
According to Rangel. the excellent labora
tory facilities at Stanford make it possible to
engage in the research associated with this
emerging field. Like biology, chemistry and
physics, neuroeconomics requires experi
mentation. Studies of neuroeconomics often
use state-of-the-art technology, including a
machine that can map activity in the brain
during decision making or thought processing
using functional magnetic resonance imaging
— better known as fMRI.
On the other hand, there are other experi
ments that do not require the use of such high

technology. To analyze the extent to which ir
relevant emotional shocks move economic
decisions, neuroscientists have subjects trade
in stock simulations while music is played to
control emotions. The belief is that trading
may be affected as music affects people's
emotions.
Stanford is not the only university intro
ducing neuroeconomics to its students. The
California Institute of Technology and New
York University have also begun to study this

area. Papers about the topic are emerging in a
series of scientific and economic journals, as
scientists and economists are delving eagerly
into the many facets of this new field.
Yet the implications of the studies will take
many years to process. After all. what do you
do once you know the area of the brain that is
activated when you choose a certain brand of
toothpaste?
As Rangel stated: "The ratio of what we
know to what we want to know is so small."
