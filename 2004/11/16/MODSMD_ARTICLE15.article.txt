## Editorial Make door-to-door the default 
### 
It has been just over a year since the Office of
Residential Education decided to strictly en
force its policy prohibiting student groups from
distributing their publications door-to-door in
dorms. The current policy requires dorms to opt-in if
they want to receive publications, but it would be
more desirable to change this to an opt-out policy.
Before last fall, it was not uncommon for students
to return to their dorm rooms and find publications —
such as a new issue of The Chaparral, a humor maga
zine, or The Stanford Progressive, a liberal newspa
per — in front of their doors. Students who did not
want to read these publications could simply toss
them in their recycling bins.
But after The Stanford Review published a con
troversial article drawing paralells the student group
MEChA to the Ku Klux Klan. Res Ed responded by
enforcing the no-distribution rule, only allowing stu
dent groups to place their publications in the entry
ways dI residences, unless residences said otherwise.
As a result, student organizations have suffered a
significant loss of voice on campus. Not only does the
policy negatively affect these groups, it also detracts
from the average student's ability to experience intel
lectual diversity on campus.
In theory, student publications can still be placed
in front of individual doors if a resident fellow or a
dorm vote decides to opt out of the no-distribution
policy.
Yet a lack of initiative from students and residen
tial stall results in many dorms never even addressing
the question of whether they want to overrule the Res

Ed procedure.
This system is unfairly loaded against student
groups. Res Ed should revise its policy so that only
dorms that feel strongly about not having door-to
door distribution should be participating in to the no
distribution policy.
While we agree that the concern over possible of
fensive content in student publications is justified, we
believe that repressing controversial voices does
nothing to stop the occurrence of potentially hurtful
dialogue taking place on campus in the first place; it
only arbitrarily limits it from extending into dorms via
print media.
Whether they are in front of rooms or in an entry
way. divisive opinions on campus will still exist. It is
only in exposing students to these opinions that they
will be able to respond and initiate conversations on
important issues.
It is much more difficult to create such dialogue if
the voices of student groups arc relegated to the un
noticed corners of dorm entryways.
Res Ed should encourage free speech on campus
by allowing door-to-door distribution by default and
by letting dorms vote to opt out of this policy only if
their residents find it to be a great enough nuisance or
moral offense so that they decide to take action.
One of the reasons that students come to Stanford
is to participate in a diverse forum in which intelligent
and respectful parties can come together to debate
topics that they are passionate about. It would be a
shame to stifle this dialogue even before it has the
chance to become more developed.
