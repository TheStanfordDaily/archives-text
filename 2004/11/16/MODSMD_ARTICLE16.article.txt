# Holt's Harangue
## Big Game rivalry: A Freudian analysis 
### CHRIS HOLT 
In order to look at Big Game this
year, I've decided to do a completely
unbiased, objective, psychological
analysis of the two schools' student
bodies. Using Freud's theory of de
fense mechanisms, I examine a rival
ry lor the ages:
1) Repression.
At Stanford, this is most apparent
in the curtailment of attempts at
stealing the Axe. a discouragement of
sabotage at the UC-Berkeley campus
and our systematic cutting of funding
to Axe Comm. To Cal, we give the big
"F-U" by iurgetting.
At Cal. the seething rage is re
pressed into a mascot that is both
unassuming and dispassionate. Also,
bulbous.
Oski, who resembles that
wannabe-hip 40-something at a col
lege party, is the symbol of their
school. The scary things about him
are his behavior around little children
and seeing him dance the Macarcna.
2) Compensation.
To compensate for having a clever
student section, a unique mascot and
awesome spirit. Stanford created
Cardinal Competitive Cheer — you
know, just to even things out.
3) Reaction formation.
This defense mechanism is basi
cally manifesting the exact opposite
behavior of latent undesirable feel
ings.
By this logic, although Cal stu
dents claim to hate everything Cardi
nal, they actually are in love with us.
In fact, they probably want to be us,
and attend Stanford instead of —
well — their second choice.
4) Regression.
To defend the ego, sometimes the

mind regresses to a safer stage in life.
Usually, this means childhood, which
would explain why students from
both schools regress to a third-grade
spelling level: "Beat Kal" vs. "Beat
Stanlurd." Spelling each other's
names wrong really gets 'em where it
hurts.
5) Displacement.
Basically, displacement is putting
one's desires towards something
more acceptable — like instead of
Oprah eating children, she eats
twinkies.
Where is all that hatred and mean
spiritedness that should be directed at
Cal? Look no further than the most
hated-on dorm on campus, Branner
Branner sucks. Go Cardinal.
At Cal, displacement of hatred for
Stanford is placed on Cal's own stu
dent population and facilities. How
else do you explain the terrible wait
lists for classes or the fact that they
tore down their own field goal posts
two years ago?
6) Transubjumigation.
A real-sounding but made-up
word describing the discrepancy be
tween Cal and Stanford students' re
gard to each other. Stanford students
will throw curses and mocking chants
at Cal students. Cal students will
throw curses and frozen fruit at Stan
ford students. One group can inflict
deep emotional trauma, the other can
inflict massive head trauma and an
ER visit.
7) Teleportation.
The act of transporting one's un
desirable elements to another's cam
pus at 4 a.m., playing all of one's fight
songs off-key (see: Cal Band Trum
pet section last Sunday night).
X) Intellectualization.
This is the process of excusing

your thoughts or undesirable feelings
through intellectual exercise. So basi
cally, this entire column.
9) Sublimation.
This last one wasn't actually a de
fense mechanism, as it is considered
mentally healthy.
Sublimation is the process of
putting bad thoughts and curtailing
them into constructive behavior. For
instance, any gripes we might have
about a losing season and C'al having
the Axe can be sublimated by show
ing support for the team.
Go to the Big Game, of course, but
first, go to the rally on Thursday. Axe
Comm needs money for such an
event, yet we somehow didn't give
them special-fees money this year.
Cal, on the other hand, has a huge
rally at Haas Pavilion. Their fervor
grows — they have our Axe, they're
playing at home. Maybe they're com
pensating for something—l don't
know.
But that doesn't mean we
shouldn't have our own rally. It 'll lack
the seriousness and over-the-top
zealousness of Cal's rally, but it might
have that cheeky silly spirit we've al
ways had. And hopefully better at
tendance.
Maybe we could get an old yell
leader to do the Axe cheer, get the
yell/ to rev up the crowd, have the
Band play and the Tree dance. Then,
light a fire.
It's in many ways a symbol of our
rivalry — every so often it needs to be
rekindled.
Go Card.

X) Intellectualization.
This is the process of excusing

your thoughts or undesirable feelings
through intellectual exercise. So basi
cally, this entire column.
9) Sublimation.
This last one wasn't actually a de
fense mechanism, as it is considered
mentally healthy.
Sublimation is the process of
putting bad thoughts and curtailing
them into constructive behavior. For
instance, any gripes we might have
about a losing season and C'al having
the Axe can be sublimated by show
ing support for the team.
Go to the Big Game, of course, but
first, go to the rally on Thursday. Axe
Comm needs money for such an
event, yet we somehow didn't give
them special-fees money this year.
Cal, on the other hand, has a huge
rally at Haas Pavilion. Their fervor
grows — they have our Axe, they're
playing at home. Maybe they're com
pensating for something—l don't
know.
But that doesn't mean we
shouldn't have our own rally. It 'll lack
the seriousness and over-the-top
zealousness of Cal's rally, but it might
have that cheeky silly spirit we've al
ways had. And hopefully better at
tendance.
Maybe we could get an old yell
leader to do the Axe cheer, get the
yell/ to rev up the crowd, have the
Band play and the Tree dance. Then,
light a fire.
It's in many ways a symbol of our
rivalry — every so often it needs to be
rekindled.
Go Card.

In order to look at Big Game this
year, I've decided to do a completely
unbiased, objective, psychological
analysis of the two schools' student
bodies. Using Freud's theory of de
fense mechanisms, I examine a rival
ry lor the ages:
1) Repression.
At Stanford, this is most apparent
in the curtailment of attempts at
stealing the Axe. a discouragement of
sabotage at the UC-Berkeley campus
and our systematic cutting of funding
to Axe Comm. To Cal, we give the big
"F-U" by iurgetting.
At Cal. the seething rage is re
pressed into a mascot that is both
unassuming and dispassionate. Also,
bulbous.
Oski, who resembles that
wannabe-hip 40-something at a col
lege party, is the symbol of their
school. The scary things about him
are his behavior around little children
and seeing him dance the Macarcna.
2) Compensation.
To compensate for having a clever
student section, a unique mascot and
awesome spirit. Stanford created
Cardinal Competitive Cheer — you
know, just to even things out.
3) Reaction formation.
This defense mechanism is basi
cally manifesting the exact opposite
behavior of latent undesirable feel
ings.
By this logic, although Cal stu
dents claim to hate everything Cardi
nal, they actually are in love with us.
In fact, they probably want to be us,
and attend Stanford instead of —
well — their second choice.
4) Regression.
To defend the ego, sometimes the

mind regresses to a safer stage in life.
Usually, this means childhood, which
would explain why students from
both schools regress to a third-grade
spelling level: "Beat Kal" vs. "Beat
Stanlurd." Spelling each other's
names wrong really gets 'em where it
hurts.
5) Displacement.
Basically, displacement is putting
one's desires towards something
more acceptable — like instead of
Oprah eating children, she eats
twinkies.
Where is all that hatred and mean
spiritedness that should be directed at
Cal? Look no further than the most
hated-on dorm on campus, Branner
Branner sucks. Go Cardinal.
At Cal, displacement of hatred for
Stanford is placed on Cal's own stu
dent population and facilities. How
else do you explain the terrible wait
lists for classes or the fact that they
tore down their own field goal posts
two years ago?
6) Transubjumigation.
A real-sounding but made-up
word describing the discrepancy be
tween Cal and Stanford students' re
gard to each other. Stanford students
will throw curses and mocking chants
at Cal students. Cal students will
throw curses and frozen fruit at Stan
ford students. One group can inflict
deep emotional trauma, the other can
inflict massive head trauma and an
ER visit.
7) Teleportation.
The act of transporting one's un
desirable elements to another's cam
pus at 4 a.m., playing all of one's fight
songs off-key (see: Cal Band Trum
pet section last Sunday night).
