# Sketch: Tales of Graduate Student Life
## Youth: How I came to be a grumpy old man 
### 
It was my birthday yesterday.
I'm 25. Which is a quarter of a
century. And definitely grown
up.
Of course by any reasonable
measure, 25 isn't old at all. If we
had more conventional roles in life,
I could still claim to be young.
However, with thousands of gig
gling children running around. I'm
feeling ever more adult as time
marches on.
They say you're only as old as
the women you feel. This unfortu
nately would mean that my age is
not well-defined this week.
However, 1 take a different
view: You're always as old as youth

would have you
be. And youth
are far from gen
erous.
I really don't
like young peo
ple. Actually,
that's a little un
fair — 1 don't re
ally like anybody
but in general
1 find people
under the age of

21 particularly irritating.
While in absolute terms I'm not
exactly aged myself, I'm finding
that the aforementioned circum
stances are giving me a more ma
ture outlook. In fact, despite my
youthful good looks I'm proudly on
my way to becoming a curmud
geon.
I'm easily annoyed by groups of
smiling undergrads, I haven't
bought a single piece of music from
this millennium and I have never
watched "The 0.C."
Now, I don't want you to get the
idea that my views on young folk
are motivated solely by the fact
that I have more developed tastes.
Rather, it's something very specif
ic that's been bothering me.
Earnestness.
You're all so terribly keen and
enthusiastic. Whatever happened
to good, healthy cynicism? Cast
your mind back a few weeks, be
fore the rains came, to when the
campus pavement was adorned
with chalk scribblings.
1 fully understand the need for
people to make their mark on the
world they live in. no matter how
transient or how insignificant. I can
even accept that the perennial
struggle for morning slogan
supremacy has its place.
However, whoever wrote the
message wishing students good
luck in their I-Hum class needs

help. It makes one cringe to see the
noble art of graffiti subverted to
such pathetic endeavors.
Where's your anger? Your
sense of humor? Your dissatisfac
tion? Also, why is your handwriting
so neat?
The undergraduates at Stanford
almost make me feel like I'm living
in some kind of commune. The
scrawling on the ground is so re
lentlessly positive it's like they've
all been brainwashed.
Many of the conversations that I
overhear while sipping my after
noon cup of joe in the CoHo are
particularly demonstrative of the
disturbing sincerity of youth.
It's troubling to hear young
people wax lyrical about how much
they enjoy their classes. This is a
University, not a place of learning.
I am willing to concede that this
might just be a particular gripe of
mine; after all, there are some peo
ple who feel that cynicism is the
wrong way to view the world.
They're just wrong.
Speaking of cynicism. I wasn't
always this way. The greater part of
my distrust of earnestness stems
from the fact that I used to be like
that.
Actually, even after dropping
the positive outlook on day-to-day
life I still retained a sense of opti
mism about the future, perpetually
believing that life would get better
at 18. at 20, at 21. and so on.
I mention this because the last
incarnation of "it'll get better in the
future" was a rash promise that,
come 25. life would be perfect.
I would be dating a string of su
permodels, my first novel would be
getting rave reviews (it's about a
bitter grad student who finds re
demption through a supermodel)
and I would have money — lots
and lots of money.
Needless to say. I've yet to find a
supermodel, my novel is held back
by an inability to construct multi
ple-sentence paragraphs and as for
money, well at least I'm eating two
meals a day.
However, the birthday was only
yesterday and I figure maybe one
more shot at optimism might be in
order. After all, things could be
worse. I could be young again.

Disagree with Nav's assessment of
young folk. Willing to show him that
undergraduates aren't completely
worthless? E-mail navinsQPstan
