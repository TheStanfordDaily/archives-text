# Network news chiefs discuss future
## News division chiefs at ABC, NBC and CBS examine coverage, threat from cable news 
### JOE SEXTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The presidents of ABC News,
CBS News and NBC News
weighed in on the present and fu
ture role of their organizations,
discussing their efforts to uphold
journalistic standards in covering
the Iraq war and presidential
elections while competing with
cable news stations for ratings.
Before a packed Cubberley
Auditorium last night, the pan
elists expressed a shared concern
over the status of journalistic in
tegrity and the presentation of
news today, especially on cable
news channels like FOX News.
"FOX has added an important
new ingredient to the news sys
tem: they mix news and opinion,"
said CBS News President An
drew Hayward. "Fox is a blend of
news and talk radio on TV. That
is a powerful dimension."
ABC News president David
Westin agreed.
"The problem is when jiews
and opinion are mashed togeth
er," he said. "It is starting to push
out the truth telling, which is un
dermining our core mission. We
have to keep the central goal
telling the truth as we see it."
Although each network exec
utive voiced wariness about cable
news' current direction, none
could deny the growing impact of

channels such as CNN and FOX
News.
The moderator, Richard
Wald, a professor of journalism
at Columbia University, high
lighted the growing popularity of
cable news, pointing to statistics
that showed that news shows ac
counted for nine out of the 10
highest rated cable programs
during election week, whereas
none of the most watched pro
grams on network television
were news-related.
"It used to be that people
would rearrange their lives to sit
down in their Barcalounger at
6:30 p.m. and watch a half hour of
news," Westin said. "The chal
lenge is that now, we have to
come to them."
According to Westin, the chal
lenge for network news organiza
tions is how to appeal to people in
a society saturated by 24-hour
cable and Internet news sites. All
three panelists, however, seemed
optimistic that their networks
will always have a future in news
reporting.
"People can access things in all
different ways, but I think there
will always be a market for the
evening news," Hayward said.
Despite low ratings, the exec
utives were pleased with their
stations' election-night coverage,
claiming that they met core jour
nalistic standards.
"I was very encouraged by
[CBS's election night coverage),"
Hayward said. "I though that the
election coverage was a harbin
ger of the future of election cov
erage. I was happy with the cau
tion our reporters displayed in re
porting the results. They re
frained from calling it at half

time."
The audience seemed pleased
with the panelists' discussion of
election-night reporting, as
Westin even admitted that popu
lar shows such as "ER" bring
higher ratings and more advertis
ing dollars, but that networks
have a responsibility to broadcast
important events.
"I was very impressed," said
junior Aron Kirshner. "I thought
it was most interesting when they
said that on election night that
they were willing to set aside the
need to make money by airing
more mainstream programming
in order to cover something that
they feel is important."
The executives also discussed

their stations' coverage leading
up to the war in Iraq and failure
to more carefully examine the
Bush administration's claim that
Iraq had weapons of mass de
struction.
"[ABC] let down the Ameri
can people," Westin said. "I sin
cerely regret that."
NBC News President Neal
Shapiro added, however, that
some public attacks on the
media's lack of vigilance have
been misguided.
"Some of the things we cov
ered just didn't resonate with the
public," he said. Shapiro men

prominent military leader who
"put it out every day that there
wouldn't be enough troops in Iraq.
This didn't seem to resonate with
the American people."
Others agreed.
"We reported again and again
that we didn't see evidence of Sad
dam's complicity in 9/11, nor did
we ourselves find evidence of
weapons of mass destruction."
Westin said. "We reported this

again and again and again and yet
polls show that an alarming num
ber of people still believe there
were weapons of mass destruction
in Iraq."
Most in the audience applauded
the discussion as frank and
thoughtful.
"I am generally somewhat skep
tical of the news I'm exposed to,"
said junior Will Levi. "1 was very
impressed tonight, however. They

Wald, the moderator, closed the
discussion with a similar endorse
ment.
"There are no stupid presidents
of network news."
