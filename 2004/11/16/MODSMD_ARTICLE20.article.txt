Mexican immigrants must work
hard to make a living in America
After having read Prof. Edward
P. Lazear's column and ihe respons
es from several students — Dayna
Muniz. Cristina Mercado and Julian
Vasquez — I feel the need to pro
vide another point of view on the
originating factors of the particular
controversy of Mexican immigrants,
as opposed to other immigrants.
They speak less English, they
make less money, and their level of
education is lower than other Latino
immigrants; therefore, they are un
able to take part of this country's
culture.
This sounds almost discriminato
ry — if you don't know the actual
conditions in which thousands of

Mexican immigrant workers live in
this country.
I want to point out the ways in
which the immigration policies of
this country marginalize us: We
don't qualify as refugees, for politi
cal asylum, as victims of war or natu
ral disasters.
There are people who have lived
in this country for more than 10 or 15
years and who are not even tempo
rary residents or permanent resi
dents. and much less American citi
zens.
It's important to know that if you
don't have the right papers to work,
you don't get good jobs — or good
salaries. T his is something that came
into even sharper focus after Sept.
11, and it is the reason why the ma
jority of Mexican immigrants work

as dishwashers, janitors and car
washers.
Sometimes these workers earn
less than $8 an hour, so we know that
for janitorial companies, restaurants
and many other businesses, it's con
venient to hire undocumented
workers and pay them low salaries
— without any type of benefits —
under conditions that are often un
just.
These types of workers are neces
sary. In a modern society they will
always exist, as one of the conse
quences of increasing globalization
in rich nations, as long as the laws of
the international market arc con
trolled by huge transnational com
panies that leave us with no work in
our countries of origin.
We all came looking for the op

portunity this country reserves espe
cially for us — cheap labor.
I also want to clarify for Prof.
La/ear that the ABM janitors of this
university are taking English classes
with students in two programs:
Habla La Noehe and Habla F.I Dia,
in HI Ccntro Chicano.
Lastly. I want to thank the Stan
ford students that encouragc people
in our situation as immigrant work
ers.

Pursuit of moderation fruitless in
determing policy for moral issues
The pursuit of moderation is a
quickly deteriorating art in Ameri

can politics. Those who seek to re
move hvberbole from the tone of
discourse should be commended.
Nevertheless, when it comes to poli
cy itself, we should never fall into the
trap of thinking that the compro
mise solution is necessarily the right
one.
Will Nelson's article last Friday is
a perfect example. He's dead on
about the need for mutual under
standing in the stem-cell debate;
however, some of his arguments
about Bush's policy demonstrate a
lack of that very understanding.
Stem-cell research is one of the
only debates today where people
with the same priorities of values
and principles can fall on complete
ly opposite sides. To opponents, em
brvonic stem-cell research is tacit

murder of the unborn. To propo
nents, a lack of funding for medical
breakthroughs is de facto murder of
the invalid.
It's not enough to argue over
pure scientific merits; for example,
that adult stem-cell research is ade
quate for our current health needs.
You might as well tell the computer
science department that there
wouldn't have been a significant in
novation trade-off had computer
manufacteurers stuck with vacuum
tubes. Go ahead. I dare you to try it.
That Bush sought a compromise
early on in his administration is,
again, to his credit. As policy
though, his decision was craven am
bivalence.
If you are an opponent of embry
onic stem-cell research, how could
any amount of federal funding
going toward what you believe to be
murder be acceptable? If you're a
proponent, how can you accept a
policy based on a blatant overesti
niation of the number of viable cell
lines, thus slowing such research to a
trickle?
While these positions on embry
onic stem-cell research have equal
validity. Bush's policy goes a step

Stem-cell
research

further and treats them as if they're
both right. Clearly, though, the two
can't coexist in the same moral uni
verse.
Civility in politics is noble, but
not at the expense of good policy.
We should accept that fora rare set
of issues, like stem-cell research, a
reasonable middle ground just
doesn't exist.
