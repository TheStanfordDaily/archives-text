# Harvard had ties to Nazis in 1930s
## 
### ARUNA PRABHALA THE DAILY FREE PRESS (BOSTON U 
(U-WIRE) BOSTON — Univer
sity of Oklahoma professor Stephen
Norwood presented his controver
sial research on unsettling ties be
tween Harvard University and Ger
many's Nazi regime in the 1930s at
the School of Management Sunday.
During his hour-long speech
based on an academic paper he re
cently wrote, Norwood said the Har
vard community promoted the Nazi
regime in Germany.
The conference, sponsored by the
David S. Wyman Institute for Holo
caust Studies, featured several
speakers discussing America's re
sponse to the Holocaust.
Norwood's findings have recently
received attention from news
sources across the country including
The Boston Globe and The Wash
ington Post.
Saturday's criticism was focused
on former Harvard President James
Bryant Conant.
"He was not silent in the face of
discrimination," Norwood said. "He
actively collaborated in it."
Norwood criticized not only the
Harvard administration but also its
student-run newspaper, The Crim
son. for its series of anti-Semitic edi
torials during the 19305.
He said the paper's editorial
board had suggested that Harvard
award an honorary degree to Ernst
Hanfstaengl, one of Adolf Hitler's
earliest financial supporters and his
foreign press secretary. The Harvard
alum's 1934 visit sparked large
protests in the city and at the univer
sity, Norwood said.
Norwood said The Crimson ar

gued Hanfstaengl "deserved an hon
orary degree because of his high po
sition in a friendly country."
Elizabeth Theodore, the current
managing editor of The Crimson,
spoke at a panel after Norwood's
speech.
"The position that The Crimson
editorial board took then weren't
necessarily reflective of the whole
student body," Theodore said.
Norwood used Harvard's own
archives, letters written by adminis
trators and newspaper articles, to
argue that Conant and other univer
sity administrators collaborated with
the Nazis.
Norwood accused Harvard of
sending delegates in 1936 to Heidel
berg University; a German universi
ty he said was responsible for "some
of the vilest anti-Semitic propagan
da."
Norwood said the university had
welcomed Harvard delegates after a
history of openly discriminating
against Jewish students and firing all
Jewish professors.
In 1934, Harvard entertained
sailors on a German warship called
the Karlsruhe, a vessel that later
fought Allied forces near Nor
mandy, Norwood said.
Conference Chair Lance
Kawesch said Harvard's current
president, Lawrence Summers, was
invited to speak at the conference,
but declined because of scheduling
conflicts.
Kawesch said the intent of the
conference was education, not criti
cism.
"The purpose of this event is not
to bash the former Harvard presi
dent." he said. "The former Harvard
president did inappropriate things
for his time but hopefully we can

learn from it and, in the future, if a
comparable issue arises, we can act
differently."
A 30-minute question and answer
session with a four-person panel fol
lowed Norwood's speech.
David Wyman, author of the
renowned 1985 book. The Aban
donment of the Jews that is credited
with having altered common under
standing of America's response to
the Holocaust, spoke on the panel.
Wyman, who opened the confer
ence with a speech on immigration
limits for German- Jewish refugees
during the 19305, later praised Nor
wood's research and speech.
"I think it is very revealing and I
wasn't surprised by it — except to
the large extent of what had hap
pened," Wyman said.
Jeff Jacoby, a Globe columnist
and panel member, also praised the
thoroughness of Norwood's re
search.
"This truly demonstrates the dis
connect that sometimes exists be
tween education and morality," Ja
coby said.
Norwood is currently working on
a book detailing the prevalence of
anti-Semitism in American universi
ties that have a particular responsi
bility to uphold moral standards.
"They are supposed to be an ex
ample for students and the general
public, yet where is the leadership?"
Norwood asked.
Norwood emphasized a growing
importance today for studying and
understanding the Holocaust and
the circumstance surrounding it.
"We are in danger of having the
knowledge lost as time goes on,"
Norwood said. "1 think there is a
general lack of awareness in today's
students on the Holocaust."
