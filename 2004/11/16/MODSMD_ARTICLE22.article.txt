"I can be conducting three to five
conversations at once, which took a
little practice, but I understand now
that students are also doing other
things," Sidel said. "Students will
send me something, do something
else, and I will send them something
and go off and talk to another stu
dent. Frankly I think it is a wonder
ful thing to service our student needs
in a way that meets their culture."
The School of Journalism and
Mass Communications is taking it
one step further, offering Journal
ism 201 class online, taught by pro
fessor R. Thomas Berner from his
house in New Mexico. The class,
scheduled for next semester, meets
online three times a week.
The professor assigns students to
peer groups, who will meet online
on Mondays and Tuesdays to discuss
assigned questions. Fridays, stu
dents meet to discuss questions from
the entire semester. Students have a
window, usually about two days, to
log into their discussion forum and
post comments.
Students earn one point each for
their posted comments and can earn
up to 82 points toward a class partic
ipation grade. The other 200 points
come from midterm and final
exams. The concept of a virtual pro
fessor was appealing to first-year
print journalism student Caroline
DeSanctis, who takes Sidel's 201
class. She has chatted with Sidel
once to ask him about an assignment
from her room in Laßorde.
"I've never been to his office,"
DeSanctis said. "I would have to go
there and try to find it. It's more con

Kent Sidel's office is tucked away in
the bowels of the Carolina Coliseum
— a tiny cinderblock space in a hall
way of a hallway — the only sign of
life a plastic placard bearing his
name pasted on the wall by his door.
But on any given weekday, Sidel
meets with the more than 230 stu
dents in his University of South Car
olina Journalism 201 class one on
one, sometimes five at a time. That's
because Sidel has discovered instant
messaging, and his virtual office
hours are changing the way he inter
acts with students.
It started three semesters ago
when one of Sidel's colleagues, Tim
Brown, mentioned he used instant
messaging to communicate with his
students. Sidel decided to check it
out, and was amazed at the technol
ogy. So he set up virtual office hours
— Monday through Thursday, 2
p.m. to 4 p.m. — and excitedly told
his class about this new way of com
municating.
"Laughter throughout the hall,"
Sidel said of their reaction.
While students have been using in
stant messaging for years, the con
cept of instant messaging a professor
is relatively new to USC. But after
three semesters of use. Sidel said
only a handful of students have
made the trek to his coliseum office,
while hundreds have chatted with
him online about homework and
tests.
But with more than 230 students
in just one of his classes, it takes

venient to try to reach him online."
Another benefit for students —
Sidel doesn't know who they are
"because as students are want to do,
the names used on AOL accounts
don't always represent somebody
their mother would recognize."
Sidel said this puts most students at
ease, making them more willing to
ask what he called "honest ques
tions." DeSanctis, who said she
identified herself as "Caroline"
while talking to Sidel online, said it
was very informal.
"There's no intimidation factor
at all," she said.
But Sidel has to be careful he
doesn't give away sensitive informa
tion. such as grades, when talking
online.
"Everything that I write to a stu
dent through instant messaging I'm
prepared to see in tomorrow morn
ing's metro section," he said.
But the concept of a virtual class
room isn't new to USC. Blackboard,
a sort of online meeting place for
students, has been around for at
least four years. There, professors
can post assignments and get feed
back from students from discussion
forums.
But Sidel said he has been disap
pointed with Blackboard's capabili
ties, finding students don't use the
message boards and that the soft
ware is "not as robust enough to
handle what it claimed it could han
dle."
So Sidel is content to use Black
board as an electronic billboard for
his students, choosing to use an in
stant messaging service to talk to
students from his Apple computer in
an isolated office.

identified herself as "Caroline"

was very informal.
"There's no intimidation factor
at all," she said.

But the concept of a virtual class

a sort of online meeting place for
students, has been around for at
least four years. There, professors

some juggling to reach out to every
one.
"I can be conducting three to five
conversations at once, which took a
little practice, but I understand now
that students are also doing other
things," Sidel said. "Students will
send me something, do something
else, and I will send them something
and go off and talk to another stu
dent. Frankly I think it is a wonder
ful thing to service our student needs
in a way that meets their culture."
The School of Journalism and
Mass Communications is taking it
one step further, offering Journal
ism 201 class online, taught by pro
fessor R. Thomas Berner from his
house in New Mexico. The class,
scheduled for next semester, meets
online three times a week.
The professor assigns students to
peer groups, who will meet online
on Mondays and Tuesdays to discuss
assigned questions. Fridays, stu
dents meet to discuss questions from
the entire semester. Students have a
window, usually about two days, to
log into their discussion forum and
post comments.
Students earn one point each for
their posted comments and can earn
up to 82 points toward a class partic
ipation grade. The other 200 points
come from midterm and final
exams. The concept of a virtual pro
fessor was appealing to first-year
print journalism student Caroline
DeSanctis, who takes Sidel's 201
class. She has chatted with Sidel
once to ask him about an assignment
from her room in Laßorde.
"I've never been to his office,"
DeSanctis said. "I would have to go
there and try to find it. It's more con

(U-WIRE) COLUMBIA, S.C. -
Kent Sidel's office is tucked away in
the bowels of the Carolina Coliseum
— a tiny cinderblock space in a hall
way of a hallway — the only sign of
life a plastic placard bearing his
name pasted on the wall by his door.
But on any given weekday, Sidel
meets with the more than 230 stu
dents in his University of South Car
olina Journalism 201 class one on
one, sometimes five at a time. That's
because Sidel has discovered instant
messaging, and his virtual office
hours are changing the way he inter
acts with students.
It started three semesters ago
when one of Sidel's colleagues, Tim
Brown, mentioned he used instant
messaging to communicate with his
students. Sidel decided to check it
out, and was amazed at the technol
ogy. So he set up virtual office hours
— Monday through Thursday, 2
p.m. to 4 p.m. — and excitedly told
his class about this new way of com
municating.
"Laughter throughout the hall,"
Sidel said of their reaction.
While students have been using in
stant messaging for years, the con
cept of instant messaging a professor
is relatively new to USC. But after
three semesters of use. Sidel said
only a handful of students have
made the trek to his coliseum office,
while hundreds have chatted with
him online about homework and
tests.
But with more than 230 students
in just one of his classes, it takes

venient to try to reach him online."
Another benefit for students —
Sidel doesn't know who they are
"because as students are want to do,
the names used on AOL accounts
don't always represent somebody
their mother would recognize."
Sidel said this puts most students at
ease, making them more willing to
ask what he called "honest ques
tions." DeSanctis, who said she
identified herself as "Caroline"
while talking to Sidel online, said it
was very informal.
"There's no intimidation factor
at all," she said.
