## Double Trouble Both men's and women's cross country win NCAA West Regionals 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Double team titles. Double individual titles.
This is becoming routine for the Stanford cross
country teams.
On Saturday, the top-ranked women's team
and the No. 2 men's squad raced to victory once
again at West Regionals in Fresno, Calif, at
Woodward Park. Leading the Cardinal to victory,
seniors Alicia Craig and Ryan Hall placed first in
each of their respective divisions.
Saturday's victory was the sixth straight title
for the women and marked the ninth consecutive
season in which the Stanford men have nabbed
the top finish at West Regionals.
The women competed in the 6.000-meter race
and finished ahead of 27 other teams, while Ari
zona State placed second. The Sun Devils took
second in the men's division as well.
The top two teams in each of nine regions qual
ify for NCAAs. so both Stanford and Arizona
State earned spots at the meet to be held next
week. Thirteen other teams will also earn at-large
berths to the Championships.
Not only did Craig set the pace for the Stanford
women, she also claimed her third consecutive
Regionals title. At the Pac-10 Championships
held earlier this month, she came in second to Ari
zona State's Amy Hastings; however, this week
end. Craig managed to finish the race 11 seconds
ahead of her.
In the 2003 West Regionals, Craig outran sev
eral of her teammates, including seniors Sara Bei,
Jeane Goff and Anita Siraki, on her way to first
place; in 2002, Craig broke the 6,000-meter course
record with a time of 20 minutes and 39 seconds.
Craig looks to run well at this season's NCAA
Championships and improve on her sixth-place

finish from 2003.
Despite her stellar performance this weekend,
Craig did not feel that her main objective was to
place high individually.
"Our main team goal was to get in the top two
in order to qualify," she said. "Individually win
ning wasn't the main focus; next week will be the
time to really focus on individually doing well so
the team can finish with as few points as possible."
Also competing well for the Cardinal women
were Siraki, freshman Teresa McWalters and
sophomore Katy Trotter. Siraki placed third with
a time of 20:17, and McWalters and Katy Trotter
placed fifth and seventh.
Siraki has had a notable senior season. In addi
tion to placing third this weekend and at Pac-lOs,
she has also had two wins, and this weekend marks
her fifth top-10 finish this season.
"I think Anita did a great job," said women's
head coach Dena Evans. "She's been improving
every week and has been showing the maturity of
a senior, which is great as you get into the post
season."
The women knew that their odds of qualifying
for NCAAs were strong.
"We weren't over-confident going into the
race, but we knew that we had a really strong
group of seven girls towing the line and it would
be hard for another team to beat us," Craig said.
The men's team showed equally impressive
strength.
Although Hall did not participate in the earlier
meets of this season, he has more than made up
for lost time. Arizona's Robert Cheseret, last
year's Pac-10 Newcomer of the Year, barely
edged out Hall two weeks ago at the Pac-10
Championships in the 8,000-meter race. Howev
er, just like Craig turned the tables on Hastings,
Hall learned from his previous race and defeated
Cheseret and 149 other runners. In Saturday's
10,000-meter race, the Stanford senior cruised
through the finish line, placing a five second mar
gin between himself and Cheseret.
