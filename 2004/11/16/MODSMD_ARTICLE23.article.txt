## Double Trouble Both men's and women's cross country win NCAA West Regionals 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Double team titles. Double individual titles.
This is becoming routine for the Stanford cross
country teams.
On Saturday, the top-ranked women's team
and the No. 2 men's squad raced to victory once
again at West Regionals in Fresno, Calif, at
Woodward Park. Leading the Cardinal to victory,
seniors Alicia Craig and Ryan Hall placed first in
each of their respective divisions.
Saturday's victory was the sixth straight title
for the women and marked the ninth consecutive
season in which the Stanford men have nabbed
the top finish at West Regionals.
The women competed in the 6.000-meter race
and finished ahead of 27 other teams, while Ari
zona State placed second. The Sun Devils took
second in the men's division as well.
The top two teams in each of nine regions qual
ify for NCAAs. so both Stanford and Arizona
State earned spots at the meet to be held next
week. Thirteen other teams will also earn at-large
berths to the Championships.
Not only did Craig set the pace for the Stanford
women, she also claimed her third consecutive
Regionals title. At the Pac-10 Championships
held earlier this month, she came in second to Ari
zona State's Amy Hastings; however, this week
end. Craig managed to finish the race 11 seconds
ahead of her.
In the 2003 West Regionals, Craig outran sev
eral of her teammates, including seniors Sara Bei,
Jeane Goff and Anita Siraki, on her way to first
place; in 2002, Craig broke the 6,000-meter course
record with a time of 20 minutes and 39 seconds.
Craig looks to run well at this season's NCAA
Championships and improve on her sixth-place

finish from 2003.
Despite her stellar performance this weekend,
Craig did not feel that her main objective was to
place high individually.
"Our main team goal was to get in the top two
in order to qualify," she said. "Individually win
ning wasn't the main focus; next week will be the
time to really focus on individually doing well so
the team can finish with as few points as possible."
Also competing well for the Cardinal women
were Siraki, freshman Teresa McWalters and
sophomore Katy Trotter. Siraki placed third with
a time of 20:17, and McWalters and Katy Trotter
placed fifth and seventh.
Siraki has had a notable senior season. In addi
tion to placing third this weekend and at Pac-lOs,
she has also had two wins, and this weekend marks
her fifth top-10 finish this season.
"I think Anita did a great job," said women's
head coach Dena Evans. "She's been improving
every week and has been showing the maturity of
a senior, which is great as you get into the post
season."
The women knew that their odds of qualifying
for NCAAs were strong.
"We weren't over-confident going into the
race, but we knew that we had a really strong
group of seven girls towing the line and it would
be hard for another team to beat us," Craig said.
The men's team showed equally impressive
strength.
Although Hall did not participate in the earlier
meets of this season, he has more than made up
for lost time. Arizona's Robert Cheseret, last
year's Pac-10 Newcomer of the Year, barely
edged out Hall two weeks ago at the Pac-10
Championships in the 8,000-meter race. Howev
er, just like Craig turned the tables on Hastings,
Hall learned from his previous race and defeated
Cheseret and 149 other runners. In Saturday's
10,000-meter race, the Stanford senior cruised
through the finish line, placing a five second mar
gin between himself and Cheseret.

Sophomore Katy Trotter placed seventh at the West Regionals in Fresno last
weekend. Both the men sand women's cross country squads took home
first place individual and team wins.
Men's head coach Andy Gerard
believes that Regionals established
a great precedent for next week's
meet.
"I think Ryan is, and should be,
very confident going into the
NCAAs," Gerard said. "Physical
ly, he's peaking, and the race last
weekend was a really controlled ef
fort, so we're very happy with
where we are heading."
Gerard also thought the team
had no trouble transitioning from
the B,(XK) meters that they have
been running in the past few meets
to the 10,000 meters this weekend.
"We train for 10,000 [meters]
since the NCAA is our ultimate
goal," Gerard said. "The only ad
justment for the guys is getting
used to the idea of being out there
fora bit longer."
Hall made the change in dis
tance seem effortless.
"For the most part, I think the
guys really enjoyed 10,000 meters
this weekend," he said. "From the
beginning of the season. Coach
Gerard has been preparing us for
10k, not Bk, so I feel that the transi-

2,000 meter increase
no problem for men

tion was a welcome one and one
that [the team was] physically well
prepared for."
Showing no signs of trouble
with the difference in distance,
sophomore Nef Araia placed third
with a time of 30:16 and junior
Jonathan Pierce placed 10th.
Araia has improved this season,
placing third at the Notre Dame In
vitational and fifth at Pre-Nationals.
Pre-Nationals were held in Terre
Haute, Ind., the site for the upcom
ing NCAA Championships. Pierce
placed 16th at Pac-lOs and 17th
when the Cardinal raced at the
home of the Fighting Irish.
As one of the team's veterans,
Hall commented on how the team
has matured since the beginning of
the season.
"It was really exciting running
this last weekend because our team
is feeling more and more like past
Stanford teams that I have been a
part of," he said. "I feel the same
sense of confidence and enthusi
asm growing with every meet that
goes by. It was great to get in an
other racing experiencing to learn

more about how to race against our
competitors and how to run the
later stages."
While the women are the top
ranked team, Evans is slightly cau
tious with her predictions for
NCAAs.
"There are three or four teams
who definitely have a shot to win the
meet if they run well, and I think
that we're one of them," she said.
"We benefit from having a few
members of our seven who have run
there before. It's definitely going to
be a tough fight, and it's going to be
close all the way to the finish."
However, before the Champi
onships arrive on Monday, the teams
have about a week to rest up and re
flect on this weekend's performance.
"I don't want to sound arrogant
or proud, but there was never a
time when I thought this team
wouldn't advance to NCAAs,"
Hall said. "When you run hun
dreds of miles with guys over a sea
son you learn to develop a deep
trust in one another. We're like
brothers out there."

"I think Anita did a great job," said women's
head coach Dena Evans. "She's been improving
every week and has been showing the maturity of
a senior, which is great as you get into the post
season."
The women knew that their odds of qualifying
for NCAAs were strong.
"We weren't over-confident going into the
race, but we knew that we had a really strong
group of seven girls towing the line and it would
be hard for another team to beat us," Craig said.
The men's team showed equally impressive
strength.
Although Hall did not participate in the earlier
meets of this season, he has more than made up
for lost time. Arizona's Robert Cheseret, last
year's Pac-10 Newcomer of the Year, barely
edged out Hall two weeks ago at the Pac-10
Championships in the 8,000-meter race. Howev
er, just like Craig turned the tables on Hastings,
Hall learned from his previous race and defeated
Cheseret and 149 other runners. In Saturday's
10,000-meter race, the Stanford senior cruised
through the finish line, placing a five second mar
gin between himself and Cheseret.

Sophomore Katy Trotter placed seventh at the West Regionals in Fresno last
weekend. Both the men sand women's cross country squads took home
first place individual and team wins.
Men's head coach Andy Gerard
believes that Regionals established
a great precedent for next week's
meet.
"I think Ryan is, and should be,
very confident going into the
NCAAs," Gerard said. "Physical
ly, he's peaking, and the race last
weekend was a really controlled ef
fort, so we're very happy with
where we are heading."
Gerard also thought the team
had no trouble transitioning from
the B,(XK) meters that they have
been running in the past few meets
to the 10,000 meters this weekend.
"We train for 10,000 [meters]
since the NCAA is our ultimate
goal," Gerard said. "The only ad
justment for the guys is getting
used to the idea of being out there
fora bit longer."
Hall made the change in dis
tance seem effortless.
"For the most part, I think the
guys really enjoyed 10,000 meters
this weekend," he said. "From the
beginning of the season. Coach
Gerard has been preparing us for
10k, not Bk, so I feel that the transi-

2,000 meter increase
no problem for men

tion was a welcome one and one
that [the team was] physically well
prepared for."
Showing no signs of trouble
with the difference in distance,
sophomore Nef Araia placed third
with a time of 30:16 and junior
Jonathan Pierce placed 10th.
Araia has improved this season,
placing third at the Notre Dame In
vitational and fifth at Pre-Nationals.
Pre-Nationals were held in Terre
Haute, Ind., the site for the upcom
ing NCAA Championships. Pierce
placed 16th at Pac-lOs and 17th
when the Cardinal raced at the
home of the Fighting Irish.
As one of the team's veterans,
Hall commented on how the team
has matured since the beginning of
the season.
"It was really exciting running
this last weekend because our team
is feeling more and more like past
Stanford teams that I have been a
part of," he said. "I feel the same
sense of confidence and enthusi
asm growing with every meet that
goes by. It was great to get in an
other racing experiencing to learn

more about how to race against our
competitors and how to run the
later stages."
While the women are the top
ranked team, Evans is slightly cau
tious with her predictions for
NCAAs.
"There are three or four teams
who definitely have a shot to win the
meet if they run well, and I think
that we're one of them," she said.
"We benefit from having a few
members of our seven who have run
there before. It's definitely going to
be a tough fight, and it's going to be
close all the way to the finish."
However, before the Champi
onships arrive on Monday, the teams
have about a week to rest up and re
flect on this weekend's performance.
"I don't want to sound arrogant
or proud, but there was never a
time when I thought this team
wouldn't advance to NCAAs,"
Hall said. "When you run hun
dreds of miles with guys over a sea
son you learn to develop a deep
trust in one another. We're like
brothers out there."
Double team titles. Double individual titles.
This is becoming routine for the Stanford cross
country teams.
On Saturday, the top-ranked women's team
and the No. 2 men's squad raced to victory once
again at West Regionals in Fresno, Calif, at
Woodward Park. Leading the Cardinal to victory,
seniors Alicia Craig and Ryan Hall placed first in
each of their respective divisions.
Saturday's victory was the sixth straight title
for the women and marked the ninth consecutive
season in which the Stanford men have nabbed
the top finish at West Regionals.
The women competed in the 6.000-meter race
and finished ahead of 27 other teams, while Ari
zona State placed second. The Sun Devils took
second in the men's division as well.
The top two teams in each of nine regions qual
ify for NCAAs. so both Stanford and Arizona
State earned spots at the meet to be held next
week. Thirteen other teams will also earn at-large
berths to the Championships.
Not only did Craig set the pace for the Stanford
women, she also claimed her third consecutive
Regionals title. At the Pac-10 Championships
held earlier this month, she came in second to Ari
zona State's Amy Hastings; however, this week
end. Craig managed to finish the race 11 seconds
ahead of her.
In the 2003 West Regionals, Craig outran sev
eral of her teammates, including seniors Sara Bei,
Jeane Goff and Anita Siraki, on her way to first
place; in 2002, Craig broke the 6,000-meter course
record with a time of 20 minutes and 39 seconds.
Craig looks to run well at this season's NCAA
Championships and improve on her sixth-place

finish from 2003.
Despite her stellar performance this weekend,
Craig did not feel that her main objective was to
place high individually.
"Our main team goal was to get in the top two
in order to qualify," she said. "Individually win
ning wasn't the main focus; next week will be the
time to really focus on individually doing well so
the team can finish with as few points as possible."
Also competing well for the Cardinal women
were Siraki, freshman Teresa McWalters and
sophomore Katy Trotter. Siraki placed third with
a time of 20:17, and McWalters and Katy Trotter
placed fifth and seventh.
Siraki has had a notable senior season. In addi
tion to placing third this weekend and at Pac-lOs,
she has also had two wins, and this weekend marks
her fifth top-10 finish this season.
"I think Anita did a great job," said women's
head coach Dena Evans. "She's been improving
