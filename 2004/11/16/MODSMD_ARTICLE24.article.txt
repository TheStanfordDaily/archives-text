# After Head of the Lake, crew poised for NCAAs
## 
### WES MATEO 
In a sense, it was a do-or-die weekend
for the members of the women's varsity
crew team — not in the sense that the fate
of their entire season rested on their per
formance, but in the sense that Sunday
marked the last chance of the fall season
for the Cardinal to prove to themselves,
and to every other collegiate crew in the
nation, that they will be a force to be reck
oned with in the NCAA title pursuit later
this year.
And with top-three finishes in both
their events at the Head of the Lake Re
gatta in Seattle, Wash., the Stanford
women proved just that.
The first challenge of the day lay in the
Women's Championship Eight event. The
women's boat was slated to start one spot
behind the University of Victoria, a consis
tently fast Canadian crew from British
Columbia, and one ahead of Washington,
one of Stanford's main West coast rivals.
Looking to make a statement against such
top-notch competition, the Stanford
women stroked their way to a second-place
finish, posting a time nearly 10 seconds
faster than Victoria and just three and a
half seconds off the pace set by the Wash
ington boat.
Contending also with choppy waters for
the last mile of the three mile course, the
Stanford women fought to maintain their
coordination and rhythm. But it was an ob
stacle they came into the race expecting
and prepared for.
"We approached [our race) knowing
that not every stroke was going to be per
fect," said junior Alexis Peterson, who

rowed in the four-seat of the women's
eight. "We knew we were going to have to
regroup, forget about the last stroke and
focus on making the next one as good as
possible." ,
Clearly, though, the strokes they did
pull for 16 minutes and 13.93 seconds were
the best they had pulled all season.
"This was exactly the 180 we needed,"
said senior captain Missy Fiesler, referring
to the team's turn-around from its sub-par
performance two weeks ago at the Head of
the American in Sacramento, Calif. "Up
until now we weren't really performing,
but today we finally pulled it together."
Accenting the performance of the eight
was the women's four, who raced to a solid
third-place finish out of a field of 17 crews
in the Women's Championship 4+ event.
After fighting through what junior three
seat Abby Loughrey called a "rough" first
500 meters, the boat fell into a rhythm on
its way to a 19:01.79 finish that trailed only
Washington and Gonzaga.
"We were really proud of the level of
our intensity," Loughrey said. "That's real
ly what we went in aiming for, and we
maintained it all the way."
But in addition to exhibiting their abili
ty to remain mentally tough, the Stanford
women also demonstrated an ability to
make improvements on the fly during a
race. Freshman stroke Kelly Foster noted
that she and her three boat-mates made an
early effort to refocus their stroke length,
an adjustment that proved critical in en
abling the women to beat out Oregon's
time by .06 seconds.
But more importantly, the effort of
both women's boats at the Head of the

Lake sent a very clear message to the rest
of their NCAA competition — that come
the spring competitive season, the Stan
ford women would be right in the midst of
the race to the NCAA Championships.
Two years ago, the women's varsity
team won the PAC-10 championship and
finished third at NCAAs. Peterson, a
member of the 2(X)2-03 team, is now one of
the veteran leaders of this year's crew. And
after acknowledging the fall season as an
early point to be drawing comparisons, she
went on to liken the potential of the two
teams.

"The team two years ago had a lot of fire
beneath them, really making them push in
every practice and every race," she said.
"This past week lit that fire for us."
And that fire should burn even more
strongly this off-season, given that the
team was not one of the 16 crews invited to
NCAAs last year, despite finishing 15th in
the coach's poll.
Having been with the team for only a
month and a half, Foster noted the team's
common commitment to its goal.

The Head of tfie Lake Regatta marked the end of the fall season for both the men and
women's crew teams. Stanford will begin its spring season in March.
"Everyone wants to work," she
said. "And after not getting the re
sults they wanted last year, every
one wants to go for it."
But critical to the team's suc
cess in the spring will be the de
velopment of its novice recruits.
The Stanford women's final
spring ranking will he deter
mined by the performance of
three boats — its two varsity
eights and its varsity four. The
varsity four's lineup will most

likely be filled out by newer
members of the team.
Consequently, the perfor
mance of the women's novice
boat at the Head of the Lagoon
Regatta in Foster City, Calif, was
another shining source of opti
mism this weekend. Also con
cluding their fall season, the
novice women edged the time of
Santa Clara's boat by one second
to take first-place in their only
event.

in the Women's Championship 4+ event.
After fighting through what junior three
seat Abby Loughrey called a "rough" first
500 meters, the boat fell into a rhythm on
its way to a 19:01.79 finish that trailed only
Washington and Gonzaga.
"We were really proud of the level of
our intensity," Loughrey said. "That's real
ly what we went in aiming for, and we
maintained it all the way."
But in addition to exhibiting their abili
ty to remain mentally tough, the Stanford
women also demonstrated an ability to
make improvements on the fly during a
race. Freshman stroke Kelly Foster noted
that she and her three boat-mates made an
early effort to refocus their stroke length,
an adjustment that proved critical in en
abling the women to beat out Oregon's
time by .06 seconds.
But more importantly, the effort of
both women's boats at the Head of the

Lake sent a very clear message to the rest
of their NCAA competition — that come
the spring competitive season, the Stan
ford women would be right in the midst of
the race to the NCAA Championships.
Two years ago, the women's varsity
team won the PAC-10 championship and
finished third at NCAAs. Peterson, a
member of the 2(X)2-03 team, is now one of
the veteran leaders of this year's crew. And
after acknowledging the fall season as an
early point to be drawing comparisons, she
went on to liken the potential of the two
teams.

"The team two years ago had a lot of fire
beneath them, really making them push in
every practice and every race," she said.
"This past week lit that fire for us."
And that fire should burn even more
strongly this off-season, given that the
team was not one of the 16 crews invited to
NCAAs last year, despite finishing 15th in
the coach's poll.
Having been with the team for only a
month and a half, Foster noted the team's
common commitment to its goal.

The Head of tfie Lake Regatta marked the end of the fall season for both the men and
women's crew teams. Stanford will begin its spring season in March.
"Everyone wants to work," she
said. "And after not getting the re
sults they wanted last year, every
one wants to go for it."
But critical to the team's suc
cess in the spring will be the de
velopment of its novice recruits.
The Stanford women's final
spring ranking will he deter
mined by the performance of
three boats — its two varsity
eights and its varsity four. The
varsity four's lineup will most

likely be filled out by newer
members of the team.
Consequently, the perfor
mance of the women's novice
boat at the Head of the Lagoon
Regatta in Foster City, Calif, was
another shining source of opti
mism this weekend. Also con
cluding their fall season, the
novice women edged the time of
Santa Clara's boat by one second
to take first-place in their only
event.

Novice boat takes first

After a weekend marked by both
improvement and accomplish
ment. the women's team heads
into its off-season confident but
well aware that their work is far
from done.
"It's early," Fiesler said, "but
anything's possible for us as long as
we keep our heads in it."
The Cardinal will open their
spring season in March when they
take on the University of British
Columbia.
In a sense, it was a do-or-die weekend
for the members of the women's varsity
crew team — not in the sense that the fate
of their entire season rested on their per
formance, but in the sense that Sunday
marked the last chance of the fall season
for the Cardinal to prove to themselves,
and to every other collegiate crew in the
nation, that they will be a force to be reck
oned with in the NCAA title pursuit later
this year.
And with top-three finishes in both
their events at the Head of the Lake Re
gatta in Seattle, Wash., the Stanford
women proved just that.
The first challenge of the day lay in the
Women's Championship Eight event. The
women's boat was slated to start one spot
behind the University of Victoria, a consis
tently fast Canadian crew from British
Columbia, and one ahead of Washington,
one of Stanford's main West coast rivals.
Looking to make a statement against such
top-notch competition, the Stanford
women stroked their way to a second-place
finish, posting a time nearly 10 seconds
faster than Victoria and just three and a
half seconds off the pace set by the Wash
ington boat.
Contending also with choppy waters for
the last mile of the three mile course, the
Stanford women fought to maintain their
coordination and rhythm. But it was an ob
stacle they came into the race expecting
and prepared for.
"We approached [our race) knowing
that not every stroke was going to be per
fect," said junior Alexis Peterson, who

rowed in the four-seat of the women's
eight. "We knew we were going to have to
regroup, forget about the last stroke and
focus on making the next one as good as
possible." ,
Clearly, though, the strokes they did
pull for 16 minutes and 13.93 seconds were
the best they had pulled all season.
"This was exactly the 180 we needed,"
said senior captain Missy Fiesler, referring
to the team's turn-around from its sub-par
performance two weeks ago at the Head of
the American in Sacramento, Calif. "Up
until now we weren't really performing,
but today we finally pulled it together."
Accenting the performance of the eight
was the women's four, who raced to a solid
third-place finish out of a field of 17 crews
in the Women's Championship 4+ event.
After fighting through what junior three
seat Abby Loughrey called a "rough" first
500 meters, the boat fell into a rhythm on
its way to a 19:01.79 finish that trailed only
