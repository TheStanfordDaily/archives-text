## 
### STEPHEN DORSEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Preparation, tranquility and confidence
were the keys to Stanford's second-place
finish at the North-South Pacific Coast
Championships in Bakersfield. Calif, on
Saturday. The Cardinal posted many up
sets, beating No. 5 Georgetown and edging
top-ranked Southern California by two
points.
This past weekend's regatta was highly
competitive, with a small margin of nine
points differentiating fourth place from the
eventual winner, Hawaii. The sailors were
welcomed to Lake Isabella with warm
weather and late winds on each day of com
petition.
The PC Championship is one of the
largest sailing events of the season. The in
tersectional regatta had four divisions —
two double-handed and two single-hand
ed. Stanford sent seniors Peter Deming,

Lucy Horton and sophomore Becca Levin
for division A. Deming and Horton sailed
the first five races, and then Horton was re
placed by Levin in the final two.
Division B consisted of Eddy Conrad
and Anna Vu. while sophomore Emery
Wager sailed in the single-handed division
C and Andy Mesher sailed in division D for
single-handed.
Deming and Wager sailed particularly
well during the close regatta, with Wager
winning his division.
"We didn t have any fears going into the
Championship, and we did what we had to
do," Deming said.
Leading into the seventh and final race,
the Cardinal looked toward Mesher, Con
rad and Vu to maintain their second-place
position, and possibly allow the team to
surpass first place Hawaii.
"We were hoping that we could hold off
USC going into the last race," captain
Deming said. "Mesher, Conrad and
Vu's ability to perform well under
pressure saved the regatta."
Mesher began the race in 17th
place — last — but with determina
tion he (ought back to finish third,
helping Stanford to beat out most of
its competitors. Conrad and Vu also
finished third in their final sailing
event.
Head sailing coach Jay Kehoe
was proud of the team, which sailed
extremely well in the regatta.
"They just gelled, coming togeth
er as one unit at the right time,"
Kehoe said.
Kehoe credits the sailing team's
performance to its strength trainer,
Juan Papo, known as "JP." He
worked the sailors into great shape,
preparing them well for the entire
season.
Despite falling short of winning
the regatta by only three points, the
Cardinal are happy with their accom-

plishment. By placing second in the
PC Championship, Stanford is eligi
ble to participate in any regatta of its

choice during the spring season.
"We ended the fall season on a
very high note," Kehoe said.
