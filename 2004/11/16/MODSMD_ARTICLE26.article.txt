## Hats off to Card women's soccer despite 1-0 loss to Santa Clara 
### 
Playoff soccer is the tabula rasa of the
sporting world. Previous disappoint
ments are wiped away, and prior victo
ries are worth no points. Once the tournament
starts, every team's season begins anew.
Last weekend the Stanford women's soc
cer team entered the first round of the NCAA
playoffs for the seventh consecutive year. The
Cardinal concluded the regular season the
week before with a disappointing series at the
Washington schools, and the winless northern
road trip dropped the team into a fourth-place

tie in the hotly contested
Pac-10 Conference.
Despite their 12-5-3
record, the Cardinal found
themselves seeded in the
toughest regional of the
toughest bracket in the
country, with projected
games against Santa Clara
and unbeaten North Car
olina in the second and third

rounds.
The NCAA selection committee was not
kind to Stanford. Rather than letting the Car
dinal host an opening round at sunny, new,
fan-friendly Maloney Field, the faithful had to
pilgrim down Highway 101 to the old, rickety
baseball diamond known as Buck Shaw Stadi
um.
The soccer field at Buck Shaw doubles as
left field of the baseball diamond. The dirt in
field wreaks havoc on innocent visitors who
expect the ball to roll according to the laws of
Newtonian physics. The wooden bleachers
offer terrible sight lines and gigantic splinters.
And the home team, the Santa Clara Broncos,
is the Cardinal's nemesis.
Santa Clara is the premier women's soccer
program on the West Coast, and while Stan
ford has challenged that dominion in recent
years, it takes time and victories to change na
tional perception. The Broncos were crowned
national champions in 2001. Since then Stan
ford has had several very talented sides, but
none have been quite good enough to unseat
the leaders.
The torch was almost passed in 2002 when
Brittany Oliveira scored in a 3-0 rout at Buck
Shaw Stadium and celebrated by sliding
through the brand new "National Champi
ons" logo painted on the field. But that season
ended abruptly in the NCAA quarterfinals on
penalty kicks against Portland.
Last year the Broncos sent a young Cardi
nal team home in the first round, 1-0.
This year's team took its lumps during the
regular season, losing several late leads and
falling three times in overtime, but it also
showed flashes of brilliance, including a
seven-game streak where it went 6-0-1 and
gave up no goals.
In the week preceding the tournament,
Stanford suddenly found itself at a disadvan
tage when two key players, senior co-captain
and scoring leader Marcie Ward and junior
defender Jenny Farenbaugh. were lost to in
juries. Though undermanned, the Cardinal
found their offensive touch against Cal Poly in
the first round, setting up the much-awaited
rivalry rematch with Santa Clara on Sunday.
The victor would win — or be sentenced to,
depending on how you look at it — a trip to
Chapel Hill to take on a Tar Heels squad that
had outscored its playoff opponents 12-0.
If you read yesterday's sports page you
know what happened, and there's no need for
me to drag out the drama any longer. In sud
