# Swimmers take their marks for Speedo Cup
## 
### SAMUEL CHEN 
The confident group of swimmers
composing the No. 4 Stanford men's swim
team (1 -0) feels like it can take on and de
feat anyone in the pool.
In the squad's upcoming meet at the
Speedo Cup at the Belmont Plaza in Long
Beach, Calif., the Cardinal will have a
chance to prove it against a group of chal
lengers that will include a number of
strong Division I and II schools.
Needless to say, as the first big road
meet of the season rolls in for the Cardinal
on Nov. 18-20, the Cardinal swimmers are
excited.
"The Speedo Cup is something every
one looks forward to in kicking off the
season." sophomore Hongzhe Sun said.
"It gives the team an opportunity to get
out and race in a preliminary and final for
mat."
If past years are of any indication. No.
22 BYU will likely be the closest competi
tor. In the 2003 Speedo Cup on the cam
pus of UC-Irvine. when Stanford com
pletely blew away the rest of the crowd in
the three-day meet. BYU took second.

That year, the Cardinal finished with
1,885 points, over 800 more points than
the Cougars' 1,012.
The team that Stanford handily beat in
its first and only scored dual meet of the
season this year, the reigning Division II
Champion CSU-Bakersfield, came in
third at last season's Speedo Cup with
950.5 points. UC-San Diego and Air
Force rounded out the top five.
However, essential to Stanford's suc
cess at last year's Speedo Cup was the
then-senior, now-graduated Marcus
Rogan, who was crowned the Most Valu
able Swimmer of the meet.
Despite considerable losses from last
year's lineup. Stanford isn't too concerned
about a drop-off in performance for the
team's first significant invitational of the
season. In fact, the swimmers' outlook is
quite the opposite.
"With a few days rest for the Speedo
Cup. we can take advantage of the hard
training and post some great times." said

mid-season rankings ... the top."
Stanford has continually vied for
the nationally top-ranked spot on
the College Swimming Coaches As
sociation of America Poll, hut has
not attained it since the 2(X)2-03 sea
son. when the Cardinal entered the
NCAA championships ranked No. 1
and emerged with a disappointing
third-place finish.
Even with the rankings becoming
more perceptible as the season pro
gresses, they are not the team's main
concern.
Rather, it is the goal for the Car
dinal swimmers to swim their best,
post fast times, win races and see
where the coaches who vote to de
termine the rankings in the CSCAA
poll put them.
"Our team has worked hard up to
this point and is simply itching to get
out there and race," Sun said, echo
ing the team's position going into
the meet.

This "itching" sensation worked
for the Cardinal last year, as several
Speedo Cup records were broken by
Stanford swimmers, and top times
were turned in by seniors and non
seniors alike.
Sun remembers last year when
the team embarked on its first travel
meet of the season to southern Cali
fornia for the annual Speedo Cup.
"As a freshman. I remember we
were all excited to see how fast we
could go with a couple months of
college swimming under our belts."
Sun said.
The tough jump between pre
college and college swimming lias
been emphasized again and again
this season.
However, strong performances
have been displayed by freshmen
so far this year, and with several in
juries to upperclassmen. the team
will be counting on some freshmen
to step up.

Freshmen expected to
contribute at meet

Assistant swimming coach Ted
Knapp said that not only were the
freshmen are recruited to help out
immediately, as red-shirting is not a
common practice in this sport.
Among classes, though, Mar
shall. as a senior, commented that
this year's team is "very tightly
knit," and this is displayed in the
confidence level of the team.
At this multi-squad competition,
the preliminary swims for each
event will commence at 8 a.m. and
the top 16 who qualify for the finals
will swim for points at races begin
ning at 6 p.m. on each of the three
days of competition.
"While we are again looking to
gauge our fitness level, we are also
confident that our results will be
good," Marshall said.

This "itching" sensation worked
for the Cardinal last year, as several

Stanford swimmers, and top times
were turned in by seniors and non
seniors alike.

the team embarked on its first travel

the top 16 who qualify for the finals
will swim for points at races begin

"While we are again looking to

good," Marshall said.
The Speedo Cup is scheduled for

The confident group of swimmers
composing the No. 4 Stanford men's swim
team (1 -0) feels like it can take on and de
feat anyone in the pool.
In the squad's upcoming meet at the
Speedo Cup at the Belmont Plaza in Long
Beach, Calif., the Cardinal will have a
chance to prove it against a group of chal
lengers that will include a number of
strong Division I and II schools.
Needless to say, as the first big road
meet of the season rolls in for the Cardinal
on Nov. 18-20, the Cardinal swimmers are
excited.
"The Speedo Cup is something every
one looks forward to in kicking off the
season." sophomore Hongzhe Sun said.
"It gives the team an opportunity to get
out and race in a preliminary and final for

pletely blew away the rest of the crowd in
the three-day meet. BYU took second.

That year, the Cardinal finished with
1,885 points, over 800 more points than
the Cougars' 1,012.
The team that Stanford handily beat in
its first and only scored dual meet of the
season this year, the reigning Division II
Champion CSU-Bakersfield, came in
third at last season's Speedo Cup with
950.5 points. UC-San Diego and Air
Force rounded out the top five.
However, essential to Stanford's suc
cess at last year's Speedo Cup was the
then-senior, now-graduated Marcus
Rogan, who was crowned the Most Valu
able Swimmer of the meet.
Despite considerable losses from last
year's lineup. Stanford isn't too concerned
about a drop-off in performance for the
team's first significant invitational of the
season. In fact, the swimmers' outlook is
quite the opposite.
