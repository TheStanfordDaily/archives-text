# New bill closes loophole for loan companies
## 
### ERIK J. HOPE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A bill passed by Congress last
month will close a loophole that al
lowed student loan vendors to take
advantage of government subsidies
for their own profit, but Stanford
financial aid officers say the law
will not make new student loans
more expensive.
According to Acting Associate
Dean and Director of Financial
Aid Karen Cooper, the bill should
not affect Stanford students.
"The financial aid community
has been very supportive of the
Taxpayer-Teacher Protection Act
of 2004," she said. "We believe that
there will be no impact to the avail
ability of federal student loan
funds now or in the future as a re
sult of this bill."
The Taxpayer-Teacher Protec
tion Act, proposed by Sen. Judd
Gregg (R-NH) and Rep. John
Boehner (R-OH), passed unani
mously in both the House and the
Senate.
The legislation ends a policy
that guaranteed loan vendors a 9.5
percent rate of return on loans

even though students only pay
about 3.4 percent themselves. As a
consequence, the government has
been paying the leftover 6.1 per
cent to a cost of more than $1 bil
lion over the last 10 years. The 9.5
percent guarantee was first estab
lished as an incentive to nonprofit
organizations to issue student
loans by making it financially pos
sible for them to do so.
Congress stopped guaranteeing
9.5 percent returns on loans in 1993
because the high guaranteed rate
was no longer necessary, but it al
lowed companies to continue to
collect the high rate on existing
loans. This opened a loophole for
companies to continue receiving
the 9.5 percent interest rate on new
loans by opening them under old
accounts.
In the last three years, the
amount paid by the government to
student lenders has grown from
$209 million to $634 million.
"Exploiting a loophole in cur
rent law, some lenders, including
for-profits that have acquired non
profits, have been rolling new

loans into old accounts, some
times for as little as a day, to qual
ify for the subsidy," said Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy (D-MA) in a state
ment on the floor of the Senate re
cently.
Under the new legislation,
more than $250 million that would
otherwise have gone to subsidize
student loan companies will in
stead be used to help college stu
dents and new teachers pay off
their outstanding student loans.
"The savings from the tempo
rary closure of this loophole will
be used to expand loan forgive
ness for student borrowers who
teach math, science and special
education in high-poverty K-12
school districts," Cooper said.
While the bill was passed unan
imously, Congressional Democ
rats believe that more can be done

to save taxpayers money, since
the bill expires in 2005 and still al
lows banks to "recycle" some
loans at the old 9.5 percent rate.
"There is just one problem with
(the| bill," said Sen. Christopher
Dodd (D-CT) in an article in the
New York Times. "It does not
close the loophole completely,
and it does not close the loophole
permanently. If we were to shut
down the loophole completely, we
would achieve a $400 million sav
ings within the same time frame.
That would amount to an addi
tional $115 million for student fi
nancial aid."
As far as the lenders are con
cerned, Cooper believes they will
be fine.
"Lenders have other options
for financing the loans," she said.
