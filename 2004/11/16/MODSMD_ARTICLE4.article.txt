## 
### GERRY SHIH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Former U.S. Congressman
Michael Huffington, Class of 1970,
spoke yesterday about the difficul
ties of balancing his background as a
"very religious. Orthodox Christian,
conservative Republican who went
through a military academy" life
with his bisexual identity.
In a speech sponsored by the
Haas Center for Public Service and
the Office for Religious Life. Huffin
gton said that since his days as a
Stanford undergraduate, he has felt
disparate. He said that when he was
at Stanford, because students were
involved in so many activities, they
were "like fragmented people walk
ing around."
From the Round Room in
Memorial Church, Huffington en
couraged gays and lesbians to "lead
a full and open life" by reconciling
their sexual life with their religious
and family life.
He also spoke about religion's

role in shaping identity.
"God created me in his image,"
he said. "He created everyone in his
image. His image is so broad. Gay
ness fits in that image."
An Orthodox Christian. Huffing
ton recalled his coming out as a big
decision but a painless process. He
said he hopes that young gays and
lesbians who are troubled by "enor
mous grief" know that there are gays
of all walks of life — including poli
tics.
"No one said a negative thing,"
he said. "I was welcomed whole
heartedly by my congregation. Many
people wrote me letters of congratu
lations, telling me 'That took
courage' and 'Now you can be who
you want to be."'
While acknowledging that his
party has not been as supportive of
gay and lesbian rights as the Democ
ratic party has been, he maintained
his allegiance to the Republican
party. But he added that he has op
posed legislation aimed at outlawing
gay marriage.
"I put my money where my
mouth is," Huffington said. "I put
my financial and political capital on
the line when I spoke out against the
ban on gay marriage."
He reminded the audience that
since the House of Representatives
was dominated by Republicans,
without Republican votes that sup
ported gays, the bill would have
passed.
"It would be a disaster if all les
bians and gays are in one party," he
said.
Donnovan Yisrael, community
health specialist at Vaden Health
Center, said that while he is a Demo

crat, he appreciated Huffington s
advocacy of sexual expression with
out religious or political restraints.
" The intersection of sexuality
and religion is a meaningful issue for
me," said Yisrael, who added that he
converted to Judaism because of the
"sexual tolerance issue." He also
agreed with Huffington's take on
politics.
"Democrats stereotype Republi
cans and Republicans stereotype
Democrats," Yisrael said. "(Huffin
gton is] someone who is so different
and with complexity. Having a Re
publican with these interests is so im
portant."
