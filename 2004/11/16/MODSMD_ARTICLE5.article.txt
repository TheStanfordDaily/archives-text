# Thieves make off with $20,000 in computers
## 
### XIN XIE 
Nearly $20,000 worth of equip
ment was stolen from the computer
lab in the Mechanical Engineering
Building on Nov. 6. The thieves
made away with seven flat-screen
monitors, central processing units
and memory components from the
computers, although the hard drives
and cables were left intact.
Research assistant Jonathan
Fiene, a fourth-year graduate stu
dent in mechanical engineering, said
that he thought the thieves must
have had some time to commit their
crime.
"It takes some time to disassem
ble the computer, remove the mem
ory and the CPU, and make it look as
though nothing happened," Fiene
said.
According to Sergeant Tim Han
rahan of the Stanford Department of
Public Safety, the equipment was
stolen sometime between 7:30 p.m.

Nov. 6 and 9:30 a.m. Nov. 7.
Fiene said the he checked the lab
before leaving at 7:30 on Nov. 6 and
did not see anything missing.
"But when I came back the next
morning, I noticed that the seven
monitors were gone and reported it
to Chris Crismon. the building man
ager," Fiene said.
According to Fiene, Crismon ini
tially did not think anything was
amiss; he thought that the flat
screens were being serviced. But
when Lab Manager Steve Jones was
informed by the pair about the miss
ing computers. Jones knew that a
crime had occurred and decided to
call the police.
What makes the case especially
puzzling, according to research assis
tant Katherine Kuchenbecker, a
fifth-year graduate student, is that
there was no record of any overnight
entries through the front door of the

Thieves stole $20,000 worth of computers arid flat-screen monitors Nov. 6
from the Mechanical Engineering Building. Stanford police have few leads.
Mechanical Engineering Building,
which is accessed by a card-scanner.
However, the thieves could have
obtained easy access into the lab in
question once they had entered the
building.
"In the process of talking to Steve
Jones and other sources, we found
that someone found the door to the
lab propped open Saturday night,"
Hanrahan said.
When they arrived at the lab on
Sunday, the police promptly took
fingerprints on the hard drive boxes
but found none, according to
Kuchenbecker.
"The facts that no fingerprints
were found and that there was no
record of entries suggests that this

may have been a professional job,"
she said.
Stanford police are not divulging
much information about the case.
"It's an open investigation, and at
this point there's no further details
regarding the investigation." said
Deputy Ken Bates. He added that
the release of specific information
could compromise the integrity of
the investigation.
This recent theft comes on the
heels of a lock malfunction in anoth
er mechanical engineering building
a week earlier. Kuchenbecker said
that in that case, the key access sys
tem was broken.
"A locksmith inspected the sys
tem and said it looked like someone

was trying to commit forced entry,"
she said. "These two events may or
may not be connected, hut since the
security system in the two buildings
are the same, the first event may
have taught the thieves how the se
curity system worked so they could
plan the most recent crime."
These recent thefts have high
lighted the difficulty in providing
easy access to resources while main
taining security.
"The University wants to provide
resources that students can easily ac
cess. but unfortunately that also
makes the resources vulnerable to
thieves." Kuchenbecker said.

lab have been reminded not to prop
open doors, to make sure all doors
are locked and to take other security
measures.
"We will take security measures
to make sure that doors are locked
in order to make sure this doesn't
happen again." Crismon said.
Still, some students think that
more steps should be taken.
"I would hope to see security
cameras installed," said Ethan Bar
bour, a third-year graduate student
in mechanical engineering. "I think
it is worth it to spend money on se
curity because things like this can
only lead to increased tuition."

crime.
"It takes some time to disassem
ble the computer, remove the mem
ory and the CPU, and make it look as
though nothing happened," Fiene
said.
According to Sergeant Tim Han
rahan of the Stanford Department of
Public Safety, the equipment was
stolen sometime between 7:30 p.m.

Nov. 6 and 9:30 a.m. Nov. 7.
Fiene said the he checked the lab
before leaving at 7:30 on Nov. 6 and
did not see anything missing.
"But when I came back the next
morning, I noticed that the seven
monitors were gone and reported it
to Chris Crismon. the building man
ager," Fiene said.
According to Fiene, Crismon ini
tially did not think anything was
amiss; he thought that the flat
screens were being serviced. But
when Lab Manager Steve Jones was
informed by the pair about the miss
ing computers. Jones knew that a
crime had occurred and decided to
call the police.
What makes the case especially
puzzling, according to research assis
tant Katherine Kuchenbecker, a
fifth-year graduate student, is that
there was no record of any overnight
entries through the front door of the

Thieves stole $20,000 worth of computers arid flat-screen monitors Nov. 6
from the Mechanical Engineering Building. Stanford police have few leads.
Mechanical Engineering Building,
which is accessed by a card-scanner.
However, the thieves could have
obtained easy access into the lab in
question once they had entered the
building.
"In the process of talking to Steve
Jones and other sources, we found
that someone found the door to the
lab propped open Saturday night,"
Hanrahan said.
When they arrived at the lab on
Sunday, the police promptly took
fingerprints on the hard drive boxes
but found none, according to
Kuchenbecker.
"The facts that no fingerprints
were found and that there was no
record of entries suggests that this

may have been a professional job,"
she said.
Stanford police are not divulging
much information about the case.
"It's an open investigation, and at
this point there's no further details
regarding the investigation." said
Deputy Ken Bates. He added that
the release of specific information
could compromise the integrity of
the investigation.
This recent theft comes on the
heels of a lock malfunction in anoth
er mechanical engineering building
a week earlier. Kuchenbecker said
that in that case, the key access sys
tem was broken.
"A locksmith inspected the sys
tem and said it looked like someone

was trying to commit forced entry,"
she said. "These two events may or
may not be connected, hut since the
security system in the two buildings
are the same, the first event may
have taught the thieves how the se
curity system worked so they could
plan the most recent crime."
These recent thefts have high
lighted the difficulty in providing
easy access to resources while main
taining security.
"The University wants to provide
resources that students can easily ac
cess. but unfortunately that also
makes the resources vulnerable to
thieves." Kuchenbecker said.
In an effort to prevent future
break-ins. students who work in the

lab have been reminded not to prop
open doors, to make sure all doors
are locked and to take other security
measures.
"We will take security measures
to make sure that doors are locked
in order to make sure this doesn't
happen again." Crismon said.
Still, some students think that
more steps should be taken.
"I would hope to see security
cameras installed," said Ethan Bar
bour, a third-year graduate student
in mechanical engineering. "I think
it is worth it to spend money on se
curity because things like this can
only lead to increased tuition."
