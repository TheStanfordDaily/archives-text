Nearly $20,000 worth of equip
ment was stolen from the computer
lab in the Mechanical Engineering
Building on Nov. 6. The thieves
made away with seven flat-screen
monitors, central processing units
and memory components from the
computers, although the hard drives
and cables were left intact.
Research assistant Jonathan
Fiene, a fourth-year graduate stu
dent in mechanical engineering, said
that he thought the thieves must
have had some time to commit their
crime.
"It takes some time to disassem
ble the computer, remove the mem
ory and the CPU, and make it look as
though nothing happened," Fiene
said.
According to Sergeant Tim Han
rahan of the Stanford Department of
Public Safety, the equipment was
stolen sometime between 7:30 p.m.

Nov. 6 and 9:30 a.m. Nov. 7.
Fiene said the he checked the lab
before leaving at 7:30 on Nov. 6 and
did not see anything missing.
"But when I came back the next
morning, I noticed that the seven
monitors were gone and reported it
to Chris Crismon. the building man
ager," Fiene said.
According to Fiene, Crismon ini
tially did not think anything was
amiss; he thought that the flat
screens were being serviced. But
when Lab Manager Steve Jones was
informed by the pair about the miss
ing computers. Jones knew that a
crime had occurred and decided to
call the police.
What makes the case especially
puzzling, according to research assis
tant Katherine Kuchenbecker, a
fifth-year graduate student, is that
there was no record of any overnight
entries through the front door of the
