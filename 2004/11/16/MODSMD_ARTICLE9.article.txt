# Holistic health pioneer blasts societal emphasis on 'technical know-how'
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Dr. Rachel Remen, one of the pi
oneers of the holistic health move
ment, spoke last night about how
people can "bless" others in their
daily lives and criticized society's em
phasis on technical expertise over
personal kindness.
"Our culture has such respect for
expertise and technical know-how."
she said. "What 9-11 made clear were
the limitations of expertise. We can
design buildings, build planes, make
fuel — we even have people who can
talk to others during their final mo
ments through cell phones. But ex
pertise has not made us whole, has
not made the world whole. We have
delegated so much of our power to
make a difference to leaders and gov
ernments and they have failed us."
Remen, a bestselling author and a
clinical professor at the University of
Calilbrnia-San Francisco School of
Medicine, sprinkled her talk with sto
ries about her life and her experi
ences as a doctor. She drew frequent
ly from her work with cancer patients.
"Cancer strips life down to its es
sentials," she said. "What seems to
matter is simpler and much more ac
cessible. What matters is who we
have touched, what we have left be
hind in the hearts of others, and in the
end what matters is knowing we have
been a blessing."
The talk was sponsored by Camp
Kesem, a program staffed by Stan
ford students for children whose par
ents have died of cancer, are in remis
sion or have cancer. Remen praised
the camp, saying, "Camp Kesem rep
resents the power of people to help
other people, even when very

young.
Remen told the story of one of her
colleagues, who worked with victims
of domestic abuse. The colleague had
been physically and emotionally
abused by her spouse had been con
vinced that she deserved it — until a
pivotal visit to New York City.
While on a street corner, she
praised the beauty of a nearby build
ing, and when her husband insulted
her, a passerby commented, "What?
That's a perfectly beautiful building.
She's right. And you, sir, are a horse's
ass."
According to Remen, this is the
moment her colleague realized she
had the strength to leave her hus
band.
"This isn't really a story about my
colleague," she said. "This is a story
about the stranger. If we found her
now and asked her, 'Have you ever
saved anyone's life?' she would prob
ably ask, 'What?' But we have all
blessed the life of many more people
than we know."
Remen also described the final
day of the class she directs at UCSF,
"The Healer's Art." On that day,
each student writes and shares a per
sonal Hippocratic Oath.
"When they read the statements,
if you close your eyes you can't tell
the difference between first-year stu
dent and experienced surgeon," she
said. "We have gone beyond the divi
siveness of our expertise, and
touched the common place of service.
All of our tasks are only one task —
the task of healing the world."
Camp Kesem was founded in the
spring of 2(XX) as a Hillel social action
project. More than 1(X) students and
staff are involved in organizing the
camp each year.
