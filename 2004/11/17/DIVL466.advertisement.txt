Dear University Community:
The "Big Game''' is one of the greatest rivalries in college
football.
The 107 th meeting between Stanford and Cal will provide fierce
competition on the field, but it will be guided by sportsmanship
and mutual respect displayed by both teams.
As the head football coaches of these two great institutions, it is
our hope that the students, alumni, fans and boosters can follow
the example set forth by both teams, and that they will display
a spirited but friendly environment. Our goal for this year's
Big Game is for it to be a well played game on the field and an
enjoyable experience for fans of both teams.
We ask that you do not engage in "pranks" or other activities
that may require the attention of police or public safety officials.
These activities may needlessly distract officers and prevent
them from responding to true emergencies.
All bags measuring smaller than 14" x 14" x 6" will be allowed
into Memorial Stadium, but will be subject to search. Cans,
glass bottles, water bottles, coolers, and video cameras are not
permitted into the stadium. Stanford Students will enter at gate
7 only.
Come to the game, root hard for your team, and practice
good sportsmanship.
