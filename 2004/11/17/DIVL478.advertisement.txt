We invite all Cal and Stanford fans to bring a
non-perishable canned food item on Big Game Day to
help support the Alameda County Food Bank.
Collection bins will be located in and around
Memorial Stadium before the game.
Thank you for supporting the community during this
Thanksgiving season!
Go Cardinal!
