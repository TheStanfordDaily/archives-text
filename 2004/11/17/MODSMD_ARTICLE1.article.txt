# Students rally for disclosure
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Attracting attention in White
Plaza with a milk carton sculpture
and flyers, the Stanford Coalition
for Investment Disclosure began
collecting signatures yesterday
from Stanford community mem
bers to petition for disclosure of
University investments.
The group's efforts yesterday
were part of the UnFarallon Cam
paign's National Day of Action.
The UnFarallon Campaign is a
coalition of national and college
based organizations seeking to
make private capital investments
more transparent. The Day of Ac
tion was coordinated to raise
awareness about investment dis
closure at universities around the
country.
"We did manage to hand out
several hundred flyers," said SCID
member Kate Skolnick, a senior.
"The petition is in its nascent
stages. However, we have been
reaching out to graduate and un
dergraduate student groups, pro
gressive faculty and staff, and also
to alumni in the hope that they will

soon sign.
Skolnick and other SCID mem
bers placed a giant paper milk carton
in front of Old Union around noon
yesterday that read "Missing: $12.2
billion, one endowment. Do you
know where it is invested?" They
handed our fliers with additional in
formation and a link to a Web site on
which students could sign the peti
tion, which is addressed to the Board
of Trustees.
The UnFarallon Campaign has
two goals, according to SCID mem
ber and co-terminal student Anna
Mumford. Its first goal is to have
Farallon Capital Management, one
of the world's largest hedge funds,
which invests money for several uni
versities such as Stanford, agree to
more disclosure.
Second, the UnFarallon Cam
paign wants each university to dis
close which funds, such as Farallon.
handle their endowments and where
these funds invest.
The UnFarallon Campaign sent a
letter to Farallon founder and senior
managing member Tom Steyer on
Nov. 9 asking Farallon to disclose its
investments and to let universities
that invest with Farallon disclose in
vestment information without the
risk of litigation.
Steyer responded to the group on
Monday with a letter that said, "We
communicate extensively with our

investors, including your universi
ties, on our investments and policies.
As investors, we cannot comment on
the appropriate approaches for uni
versities to take regarding issues of
community oversight — this is not a
matter for us to decide."
According to Mumford, SCID's
third goal is to change the structure
of investment oversight at Stanford
so that it allows for more decision
making power from students, facul
ty, staff and alumni.
The University's Advisory Panel
for Investment Responsibility re
views allegations of unethical invest
ment decisions, but SCID claims the
panel is ineffective because neither
its members nor the outside public
have any access to information re
garding Stanford's investment in pri
vate equities.
Mumford is a student representa
tive on APIR this year and said that
the panel will hold its first meeting
for the year on Nov. 22.
Skolnick said that the milk carton in
stallation captured the attention of
passers-by and elicited varied re
sponses. including amusement, cu
riosity and dismissal.
"A group of business students
seemed to disagree with our aim. but
we were able to engage them in a
meaningful discussion." she said.
"The responses we received did con
firm that we had met our goal, which

Students want Univ. to
disclose its investments

was to place the issue of investment
disclosure and responsibility on the
radar of Stanford community mem
bers."
By the end of the afternoon, the
petition Web site had a little over
two dozen signatures.
"I think that the investments the
University makes affect all of us, and
we all have the right to know what
decisions are being made and how
they're being made and how they
could affect us," said Matthew Poliz
zotto, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate
in the department of Geological and
Environmental Sciences who signed
the petition.
Polizzotto said he had not been
aware of SCID's campaign until this
afternoon but was familiar with the
issue of investment disclosure from
his years as an undergraduate at the
University of Rochester.
SCID will continue to collect sig
natures for the petition throughout
the quarter and possibly into next
quarter.
Ten other colleges participated
in the Day of Action, including Yale
University, where students brought
attention to the issue through the
use of street theater with giant pup
pets, according to Mumford. The
students at Yale also delivered a pe
tition to the university's chief finan
cial officer yesterday, Mumford
said.

"I think that the investments the
University makes affect all of us, and
we all have the right to know what
decisions are being made and how
they're being made and how they
could affect us," said Matthew Poliz
zotto, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate
in the department of Geological and
Environmental Sciences who signed
the petition.
Polizzotto said he had not been
aware of SCID's campaign until this
afternoon but was familiar with the
issue of investment disclosure from
his years as an undergraduate at the
University of Rochester.
SCID will continue to collect sig
natures for the petition throughout
the quarter and possibly into next
quarter.
Ten other colleges participated
in the Day of Action, including Yale
University, where students brought
attention to the issue through the
use of street theater with giant pup
pets, according to Mumford. The
students at Yale also delivered a pe
tition to the university's chief finan
cial officer yesterday, Mumford
said.
Attracting attention in White
Plaza with a milk carton sculpture
and flyers, the Stanford Coalition
for Investment Disclosure began
collecting signatures yesterday
from Stanford community mem
bers to petition for disclosure of
University investments.
The group's efforts yesterday
were part of the UnFarallon Cam
paign's National Day of Action.
The UnFarallon Campaign is a
coalition of national and college
based organizations seeking to
make private capital investments
more transparent. The Day of Ac
tion was coordinated to raise
awareness about investment dis
closure at universities around the
country.
"We did manage to hand out
several hundred flyers," said SCID
member Kate Skolnick, a senior.
"The petition is in its nascent
stages. However, we have been
reaching out to graduate and un
dergraduate student groups, pro
gressive faculty and staff, and also
to alumni in the hope that they will

soon sign.
Skolnick and other SCID mem
bers placed a giant paper milk carton
in front of Old Union around noon
yesterday that read "Missing: $12.2
billion, one endowment. Do you
know where it is invested?" They
handed our fliers with additional in
formation and a link to a Web site on
which students could sign the peti
tion, which is addressed to the Board
of Trustees.
The UnFarallon Campaign has
two goals, according to SCID mem
ber and co-terminal student Anna
Mumford. Its first goal is to have
Farallon Capital Management, one
of the world's largest hedge funds,
which invests money for several uni
versities such as Stanford, agree to
more disclosure.
Second, the UnFarallon Cam
paign wants each university to dis
close which funds, such as Farallon.
handle their endowments and where
these funds invest.
The UnFarallon Campaign sent a
letter to Farallon founder and senior
managing member Tom Steyer on
Nov. 9 asking Farallon to disclose its
investments and to let universities
that invest with Farallon disclose in
vestment information without the
risk of litigation.
Steyer responded to the group on
Monday with a letter that said, "We
communicate extensively with our

investors, including your universi
ties, on our investments and policies.
As investors, we cannot comment on
the appropriate approaches for uni
versities to take regarding issues of
community oversight — this is not a
matter for us to decide."
According to Mumford, SCID's
third goal is to change the structure
of investment oversight at Stanford
so that it allows for more decision
making power from students, facul
ty, staff and alumni.
The University's Advisory Panel
for Investment Responsibility re
views allegations of unethical invest
ment decisions, but SCID claims the
panel is ineffective because neither
its members nor the outside public
have any access to information re
garding Stanford's investment in pri
vate equities.
Mumford is a student representa
tive on APIR this year and said that
the panel will hold its first meeting
for the year on Nov. 22.
Skolnick said that the milk carton in
stallation captured the attention of
passers-by and elicited varied re
sponses. including amusement, cu
riosity and dismissal.
"A group of business students
seemed to disagree with our aim. but
we were able to engage them in a
meaningful discussion." she said.
"The responses we received did con
firm that we had met our goal, which

Students want Univ. to
disclose its investments

was to place the issue of investment
disclosure and responsibility on the
radar of Stanford community mem
bers."
By the end of the afternoon, the
petition Web site had a little over
two dozen signatures.
"I think that the investments the
University makes affect all of us, and
we all have the right to know what
