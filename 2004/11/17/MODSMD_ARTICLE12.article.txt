1983 - On Nov. 17, The Daily ran a
story about two student groups that
took different sides on the creation of
a Reagan library. Below is an excerpt:
"For senior Robert Larkins, the
founder of and prime mover behind
a pro-Reagan library student group,
there is no question that a Reagan
presidential library complex should
be established here — as soon as
possible.
Another senior, Luke Cole, sees
it differently. For him and other stu
dents working against the proposed
complex, there is no question that
establishing the library complex
here would further identify "this
University with the right wing of the
Republican Party."
Larkins' group, which calls itself
Students fora Presidential Complex
at Stanford (SPC), can see no reason
why the University shouldn't accept
the entire proposal fora Reagan
complex-a library, a museum and a
center for public affairs run by the
Hoover Institution.
Another group, Stanford Com
munity Against Reagan University
(SCAReU), for which Cole is a
spokesman, believes Stanford
should not accept any of the complex
at this time because Reagan's re
election campaign is underway, and
Hoover's role within the University
is being reassessed by the Board of
Trustees.
What is in question in this battle
of young activists is whether their ef
forts will make any difference at all.
In the campus debate over
whether to establish a Reagan com

plex here, which began last spring
and has been raging since August,
student input — solicited student
input, to be exact — has been no
ticeably lacking.
Neither the Board Committee on
the Hoover Institution, which is con
sidering the matter for trustees nor
the University President Donald
Kennedy-appointed advisory com
mittee on the issue, had any student
members.
A resolution by the ASSU Senate
addressing the issue has gone pub
licly unacknowledged. And no Uni
versity official has yet agreed to an
swer questions at tin open forum to
students.
By now, even input from faculty
members, which continues to trickle
in through the mail or public state
ments. seems to have become sub
stantially less important since
Kennedy has made his position clear.
But that hasn't stopped either
student group from trying to wield
its influence.
The composition of the groups is
strikingly similar. In each, the bulk
of work is done by a small inner core
— of four students for the SPC and
eight for the SCAReU. Most are se
niors or graduate students in law or
business.
Both Larkin and Cole claim
memberships of about 70 students
but admit that the most these mem
bers have done is to attend meetings,
make telephone calls or distribute
petitions.
