# Does this make me look fat?
## Confessions of a feminist 
### 
I was born with a birth defect. It is
a genetic disease, and my dad was
a carrier for it. I don't resent my
birth, nor do I wish this hadn't hap
pened to me, but I'm reminded of my
disability every day. I see it mirrored
in people's eyes with their well
meaning offers of assistance or their
insulting assumptions of my incom
petence. I'm a stronger person for it.
I'm used to the prejudice I must

overcome to
be recog
nized as an
able adult,
and I'm
used to the
disappoint
ment when
that recogni
tion never
comes.
People
look at me
and assume
I'm fragile,
that I need to

be protected and taken care of.
People assume that it impairs mv
spatial reasoning, and makes me
moody and irrational.
The scariest part of all this is that
my disease is a pandemic afflicting
about 50 out of every 100 babies. I
was born without a penis.
When the doctor unenthusiasti
cally confirmed that "it's a girl," no
one broke out any cigars. My parents
knew that the conspicuous absence
that got me swathed in a soft, pink
blanket would be the same that
meant I'd have to work harder and
produce better results to get a frac
tion of the praise heaped upon my
male counterparts.
My worth would be inversely pro
portionate to my waistline, and if I
wasn't a pretty face, I wasn't much. I
wouldn't be allowed to be angry
because everyone knows that anger
is distinctly unfeminine. Saying "I'm
angry." feels as foreign as some
dialect spoken by three members of
a dying African tribe.
Well, I am angry. I am angry that
no matter what I accomplish, society
still considers me a failure because I
don't wear a size 2. I am angry that
after years of experience building
everything from sets to houses, when
I walk into a hardware store employ
ees talk to me like they are teaching
a kindergarten class of hearing
impaired and slightly dim students. I
am angry that osteoporosis claims
far more victims than erectile dys
function. but because it is a woman's
disease, there is no money for
researching a cure.
But you know what I'm most
angry about? I'm most angrv that
I've accepted, and worse, internal
ized it. I've surrendered my thoughts
to the brainwashing of Cosmo and
Glamour.
Yeah. I write a column on
"women's issues" and I talk about
being a feminist, but my arguments
are naive.
I don't giggle because it is natural
for me. I giggle because boys like it. I
wear high heels not because I like
the way I look, but because I know
men do. I make cookies not because
I love to bake, but because it's a cru
cial part of creating an image of per
fect domesticity so I can eventually
be considered "marriage material."
I make these choices not because
they are who 1 am, but because they
are what I'm supposed to be: part
mother, part virgin, part whore.
I'm not a victim. I'm my own cap
tor. My boyfriend was the one telling
me I was beautiful when I was hating
myself for having eaten dessert and
my dad was the one who drove me to
softball practices before I quit
because I thought it was too mascu
line a sport. It was my choice to heed
the messages transmitted in
Victoria's Secret ads, and it's my
choice to stop.
To those of you who miss my
Feminism-lite, let's-make-fun-of
men-with-small-penises articles, give
me another week to get over the elec
tion. And if it doesn't make you angry
that being female can be appropriate
ly compared to having a birth defect,
you probably have a small penis.

penis-envy, e-mail me at annekficstan

cial part of creating an image of per
fect domesticity so I can eventually
be considered "marriage material."
I make these choices not because
they are who 1 am, but because they
are what I'm supposed to be: part
mother, part virgin, part whore.
I'm not a victim. I'm my own cap
tor. My boyfriend was the one telling
me I was beautiful when I was hating
myself for having eaten dessert and
my dad was the one who drove me to
softball practices before I quit
because I thought it was too mascu
line a sport. It was my choice to heed
the messages transmitted in
Victoria's Secret ads, and it's my
choice to stop.
To those of you who miss my
Feminism-lite, let's-make-fun-of
men-with-small-penises articles, give
me another week to get over the elec
tion. And if it doesn't make you angry
that being female can be appropriate
ly compared to having a birth defect,
you probably have a small penis.

If you think this is just another case of
penis-envy, e-mail me at annekficstan
