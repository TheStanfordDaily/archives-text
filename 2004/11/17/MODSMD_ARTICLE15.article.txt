# Battling the burden of body image...
## The
						healing power of journal writing 
### KILLEEN HANSON 
Every Thursday evening, a small group
of women gather to explore, through writ
ing, their attitudes toward their bodies.
Seated in a circle on the couches in the
Women's Community Center, the women
use meditation and writing exercises to
fight and resist what they call the
"destructive and disempowering voices of
society."
Merrill Devito, class of 1997, founded
Hungry Women Writing in the spring of
last year to help women struggling with
issues of food, confidence and self-image.
The enthusiasm of the members led them
to remain at Stanford through the summer
and has carried the meetings into this
year.
"This group has a unique approach to
helping women heal their relationships to
food and their bodies," Devito said. "It
integrates spiritual, emotional and mental
aspects of the self by combining medita
tion with writing. Journal writing, in par
ticular, is a powerful way to bridge our
thoughts and our feelings. In this way the
class helps heal the divide that character
izes the food-body imbalances associated
with modern lifestyles."
"It's a great group because it is an open
forum for women to exchange their ideas
and experiences on the topic of disor
dered eating and body image," said one
sophomore who asked to remain anony
mous. "It is a group that brings together
women's struggles in an accepting and
supportive environment."
"This group is unlike other sources that
troubled women might seek help from for
disordered eating because the goal for
women participating is not necessarily to
lose weight or change their ways of eat
ing," she added. "Rather the goal of par
ticipants is to become empowered and
overcome negative thoughts."
Devito formed the group in response to
what she said was"a very real threat to
women's self-confidence and empower
ment."
She graduated from Stanford with
bachelor's degrees in English and Spanish

literature but is now no longer
directly affiliated with the school.
"Writing is very intuitive," she
explained. "It's a very powerful form
of personal exploration."
While the group is open to anyone
at Stanford, those who join must
commit to attending meetings regu
larly because building trust among
members is essential. Thus, this
reporter was not allowed to sit in on
a meeting.
"Anyone is welcome," Devito
explained. "I just ask that if you do
join, you come every week and be
willing to commit to the group . . .
Having people come and go threat
ens the feeling of safety and privacy
we are trying to cultivate."
"I don't want to be identified with
this group out of fear that others will
know that I have issues with eating
and body image," said the sopho
more member, explaining her reason
for remaining anonymous. "I only
disclose such information with my
closest friends."
Members described the meeting
as consisting of a series of self-explo
ration exercises, including a short
meditation, a group check-in where
the women share their experiences
during the past week and a guided
journal exercise.
They must also complete a writ
ing assignment between meetings. A
typical writing assignment could be a
letter to your hunger, be it for food,
attention, respect or love.
Another sophomore who asked to
remain anonymous explained that
the women who choose to attend
these gatherings each week do so
because it is a chance to grow out
side the academic institution.
She said that the meeting is a
union of "spirituality, self-reflection
and introspection .. . It's a low-pres
sure experience in a high-pressure
environment."
"The group does not focus on eat-

ing disorders or disease hut on recogniz
ing your inner thoughts and finding what's

positive within yourself," Devito
explained. "We focus on relationships, to

our selves, our bodies, others. It is not a
class on body image and nutrition."
