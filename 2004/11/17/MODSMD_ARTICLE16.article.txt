# Ongoing project to keep Stanford modern

### KAT LEWIN 
Do people prowl around your dorm with tape meas
ures? Have you ever seen someone staring intently at fire
sprinklers in the lounge? No, it's not a government con
spiracy. Chances are. your dorm is one of those being sur
veyed for renovation by workers from Student Housing's
Capital Improvement Program.

The CIP is a $637-million program designed to system
atically update student residences and dining halls across
campus. According to Rodger Whitney, executive director
of Student Housing, the objectives of the project include
upgrading and modernizing older graduate and under
graduate buildings. Also, CIP will guarantee four-year on
campus housing to all undergraduates by building addi
tional residences. Finally, safety issues, infrastructure

renewal and code compliance will be addressed and
improved.
The program began in 1992 and was scheduled to be
completed over the course of 19 years. Residences ren
ovated in order of need, according to Alicia Restrepo Z.,
manager of CI P. While all houses are inspected for safety
and comfort, design varies according to the building's
needs.
"Everv vear we take a hard look at trends in

material, program needs and any other factor that
should be incorporated into one of the CIP renova
tions," Restrepo said.
In addition to maintaining basic components like
heating and plumbing. CIP makes an effort to pro
vide amenities for student convenience.
"We are now seeing a high demand for multime
dia in clusters and more space for group efforts,"
Restrepo added.
In order to keep Stanford's housing modern after
the CIP completes its work. Student Housing man
agement created the Student Housing Asset
Renewal Program (SHARP). Using a mathematical
model, SHARP has determined a 50-year schedule
to keep residences up to date. Furthermore, the
funding for SHARP is built directly into the Student
Housing budget, rather than raising additional debt,
according to Whitney. Because of this, it will have
the ability to make changes that the CIP could not.
"This is a very progressive approach to the prob
lem facing all housing and dining buildings in higher
education and Stanford is at the forefront of this
approach," Whitney said.
In order to chart the success of the CIP. students
in renovated houses are surveyed upon the comple
tion of each project, as well as in the annual Student
Housing service survey in February.
According to Imogen Hinds, manager of
Undergraduate Housing Operations, feedback has
ranked 4.5 overall on a 5.0 scale of excellence. All
comments are reviewed and taken into considera
tion for further projects. Also. Housing supervisors
and student housing associates cooperate to make
sure any student complaints are addressed and to
see that buildings are kept in good shape.
Restrepo said that because it is imperative that
buildings be thoroughly examined before renova
tion takes place, CIP staff works with Housing
supervisors to accommodate students' schedules
during such times as midterms. Dead Week and
Finals Week.
The CIP is in its 13th year and is two-thirds done
with renovation. Upcoming projects include work at
Roble Hall over the course of the next three years,
and renovations at Row houses 717 Delores and
Columbae.
