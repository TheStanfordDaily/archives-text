## Editorial Library hours are not adequate 
### 
Green Library's current hours of operation do
not sufficiently meet students' needs. Because
the library closes early on Fridays and Satur
days, students lose a place to study and access
to the resources they need to complete work over much
of the weekend.
(ireen closes at 6 p.m. on Friday and at 9 p.m. on Sat
urday although the library extends its hours during Dead
Week. This compares to Princeton's Firestone Library,
which closes at 11:45 p.m. on Friday and Saturday; I lar
vard's Lamont Library, which closes at 9:45 p.m. on Fri
day and Saturday; and Berkeley's Moffitt Library, which
closes at 10 p.m. weekend nights.
Because the campus can be loud on the weekends
with people attending athletic events and parties, there
are often lew quiet places to study. (ireen's early closure
takes away one more quiet place to get work done.
Although Meyer is next door, it is not a fair substi
tute. Meyer does not have the books and microfilm
that students need to complete their work. Whereas
Green has personal desks and cubicles for students,
Meyer only has big wide open hallways.
The Green library staff said it determined the li
brary's current hours based on the number of students
in the library. The library has used low attendance on
Friday and Saturday evenings to support the early clos
ing hours.
I lowever. this approach may underestimate real de
mand for library services, because it does not consider
student schedules. For example, the library's b p.m.
closing time on Fridays is well before many students

have had an opportunity to arrive at the library alter
dinner. Evening classes, athletic practice and extracur
ricular commitments often run past the library's closing
time. Because these students do not have the opportu
nity to go to the library before it closes, demand could
appear artificially low, and admittedly, studying late
nights on weekends might not appeal to all students.
But even if there is not the same demand for the li
brary on the weekends, many students could still bene
fit from it being open. Students that work on Friday or
Saturday are able to sleep in the following day, and so
they can afford to work later into the evening. The
weekend is also the best time for students to complete
research-intensive assignments. Required resources
are often only available through Green, and finding
them can require hours qf work, available only on
weekends.
The amount of money required to keep Green open
longer would not be a big problem. According to Asso
ciate Librarian Catherine Tierney, the library can oper
ate with limited resources with only five employees. The
cost of their salaries and of electricity for the building is
small compared to the good that longer hours could do
for students. If recent budget shortfalls have made
longer hours prohibitive, the University should rethink
the amount of money allocated to the library.
The library plays a critical role in any student's un
dergraduate education. Without access to a library, stu
dents lose valuable time over the weekend that they
could be devoting to their studies. The library's hours
should be extended, even if it costs more money.
