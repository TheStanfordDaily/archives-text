# Student Pet Peeves
## Clearly, we should all just get married 
### YAMANDA WRIGHT 
Once upon a time, we mostly
worried about chicken pox and from
which direction the ice cream truck
came each day — a time when love
meant purposely missing a signifi
cant other during dodge ball and
marriage was something your par
ents did on the weekends with the
bedroom door locked.
Then came "dating," an ambigu
ous activity indicating anything
from habitually going to the movies
for regular people to an ominous
lifelong union between two kindred
souls for Stanford students. From
the moment when during your
Admit Weekend tour someone told
you that 75 percent of Stanford stu
dents find their future husbands and
wives here, you have been secretly
obsessed with meeting them at the
bookstore.
Every male children's book
browser could make a good father
rather than just being a guy with a lim
ited vocabulary, and every woman
with more than three course readers
in her basket could talk too much
while she's cooking your supper.
You might disagree with me. You
may even yell from the top of your
lungs, "1 never want to get married.

1 am the anti-faithful."
But that is not evident in the dat
ing scene at this university. Do the
notions that no one dates here and
everyone marries from here seem
counterintuitive to anyone else?
Indeed, how can we reserve a
nuptial service at MemChu three
years in advance if we can't even
muster the energy to ask someone to
Flicks at MemAud now.
Perhaps it is because — like with
nearly every other activity at this
school — we take dating seriously
and then try to give the impression
that it means little. We engage in a
careless make-out session with a
random party-goer at Fratapalooza
and then examine it every day there
alter, picking at it with tweezers,
rewriting and reevaluating it like the
honors thesis of the century.
I for one don't need another as
signment, so I propose a revival of ca
sual dating applicable to whatever
" dating" means for you. I suggest that
every one take his or her appropriate
dose of chill pills and ask someone
out for the sake of going out.
As radical as it may feel the first
time, it is quite normal outside of the
bubble. Young people actually ask
each other to dance at parties and
then see one another the next day

without the whole ''What did that
mean? Should we open a joint ac
count now or wait until after gradu
ation?" awkward fest.
And on the flip side, this revolu
tion requires that the askee not gawk
at the asker and deem him (or her)
sketchy. Just because they want to
spend a day with you does not mean
they wear brown shoes with black
belts, collect STDs like coins and eat
newborn babies in bouillabaisse
sauce. Pressure-free environments
mean that everyone takes dating at
face value; not assigning to it some
caricature meaning unique to Stan
ford and suburban preschool.
This is not to say that 1 am not a
participant in the ridiculousness of it
all — just that at times I feel outside
of myself, hovering above this
ridiculous world, glaring down on all
of the little ant-idiots and their
strange behavior. And that I'd like
to change it before I leave.

any ideas on how to revive casual
dating at Stanford or just want some
good pick-up lines.
