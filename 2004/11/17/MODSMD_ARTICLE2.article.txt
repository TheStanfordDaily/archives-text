### LAURA CARWILE 
Panelists, invited to speak as part
of the third annual International Hu
manitarian Law Seminar at the Law
School, decried last night the Bush
administration's human rights abus
es in its war on terror.
"The United States used to be
seen throughout the world as a pio
neer of human rights," said Jonathan
Greenberg, who is the director of In
ternational Graduate Studies at
Stanford Law School and introduced
the three panelists. "Under current
circumstances, other countries are
saying that America is torturing peo
ple too."
Panelist Jim Armstead, a profes
sor at the U.S. Naval War College,
argued that while there are wartime
cases where constitutional rights
were suspended, that has been the
exception, not the rule.
"The real crutch of democracy is
freedom, and freedom can only suc
ceed when some balance exists
where the individual can go to some

institution and complain that their
rights have been violated," he said.

"As long as there has been war,
there have been laws of war," she

The Geneva Conventions and their
protection of prisoners of war ap
plies even today to individuals in

Afghanistan."
Katie Zoglin, who has taught in
ternational human rights law at
Stanford and the University of Cali

ed States takes a unique interpreta
tion of international law in order to
get around loopholes in dealing with
the enemies and prisoners of war in
times of war.
"Our administration is very se-
