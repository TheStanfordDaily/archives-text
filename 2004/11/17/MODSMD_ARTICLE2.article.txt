### LAURA CARWILE 
Panelists, invited to speak as part
of the third annual International Hu
manitarian Law Seminar at the Law
School, decried last night the Bush
administration's human rights abus
es in its war on terror.
"The United States used to be
seen throughout the world as a pio
neer of human rights," said Jonathan
Greenberg, who is the director of In
ternational Graduate Studies at
Stanford Law School and introduced
the three panelists. "Under current
circumstances, other countries are
saying that America is torturing peo
ple too."
Panelist Jim Armstead, a profes
sor at the U.S. Naval War College,
argued that while there are wartime
cases where constitutional rights
were suspended, that has been the
exception, not the rule.
"The real crutch of democracy is
freedom, and freedom can only suc
ceed when some balance exists
where the individual can go to some

institution and complain that their
rights have been violated," he said.

Panelists blasted the Bush administration, arguing that it had turned its back
on the Geneva Convention to the detriment of democracy and freedom.
