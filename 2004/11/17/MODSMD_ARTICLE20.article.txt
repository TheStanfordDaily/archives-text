## Thanksgiving holiday rife with negative stereotypes of Native Americans 
### AMANDA BURLEY JACKSON BROSSY 
Becausc November is American
Indian Heritage Month, we want to
share with the greater Stanford campus
known issues and events that are cur
rently affecting our Native community
here on the Farm. As early as
there was a nationwide push fora holi
day observing the "First Americans."
even though Native Americans were
not granted citizenship until 1924.
Although countless Native leaders
throughout the decades championed
the cause, it was not until President
George H.W. Bush signed a joint reso
lution in IWO that November would be
the designated month that American
Indian heritage would be recognized.
In IW4. President Bill Clinton

began the trend of re-issuing the na
tional recognition each year of Ameri
can Indians. 'Itiis year, the theme for
American Indian Heritage Month is
"( elebrating ()ur Strengths." This past
Nov. 2 not only marked one of the most
important election days in history, but
it also marked the B<)th anniversary of
American Indians being granted the
right to vote.
The Stanford American Indian Or
ganization has made several strides to
publicize the importance of our culture
and highlight our presence on this cam
pus throughout this month, as it holds
special significance for our community.
The acclaimed Native American poet.
Simon Ortiz, agreed to speak and share
his life experiences and work at .Stan
ford on Nov. 17 and 18.
I le played an integral role through

out the Native American Renaissance
and is still a leader in Native American
politics and the arts. Ortiz, is holding a
reading of his works on Nov. 17 at 7
p.m. in the Old Union Ballroom di
rectly across from the A3C.
Additionally, he will be holding a
writing workshop on Nov. 18 at 4 p.m.
in the Native American Cultural Cen
ter. Other events we have in the works
are a dinner and question and answer
session with political activist Rigober
ta Mcnch and the Intertribal "Un-
Thanksgiving" Feast in Oakland.
This time of year can be disheart
ening to our community because of the
Native stereotypes that surround the
Thanksgiving holiday. Sadly, the ab
breviated elementary sch<x>l history
lessons have left a perception of Na
tive people that is untrue of most tribes

anil watered down to the extent of
degradation.
However, the realities of the early
"Thanksgiving" leasts would disillu
sion young children, so over time, the
stories have been doctored to highlight
an episode of integration — Pilgrims
and Natives getting along and eating
dinner. Children are not taught the
tribes of the surrounding areas called
Pilgrims the "Cutthroat People" in
their various languages because of the
massacre of Native elders, women and
children earning food baskets at the
second "Thanksgiving."
Oversimplifying the actions and re
alities of American history to
schwlchildren is wrong, and it has in
filtrated the American mainstream, in
cluding Stanford. The "Indian" was
the University's mascot for 42 years

until when 55 Native students
and staff petitioned President Lyman
to remove any and all "Indian" images
as the mascot of this university. The
ASSU and University officials sup
ported Native students and the newly
formed SAIO in this cause by voting
against reinstatement of the "Indian"
mascot in subsequent years.
Unfortunately, some students
groups have yet to realize the racist,
stereotypical — not to mention —
hurtful effects of continuing to use the
"Stanford Indian." The Stanford Re
view is one such group. With the re-ap
pearance of their so-called "Smoke Sig
nals" column complete with a grotesque
caricature of the "Stanford Chief." the
staff of The Review has refused to dis
continue its use since January of this
year despite numerous requests, pcti

tions and individual meetings.
Our Native community at Stanford
may be small in comparison to others,
but that does not mean we do not de
serve equal respect. We are proud of
our culture and heritage, just as we
hope that you are. but we cannot allow
individual, personal prides tocloud the
value of those around us.
So please think twice about those
Native stereotypes that are in full
force this holiday season, which so
ironically coincides with American In
dian Heritage month — you may
come across them within the confines
of Campus Drive. Thank you.
