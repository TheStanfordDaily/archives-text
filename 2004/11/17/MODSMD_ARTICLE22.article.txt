## Do not build Munger Residences as planned 
### 
In understanding Stanford's
need to expand housing for
graduate students and in under
standing the conditions of the
University's General Use Permit
with the County of Santa Clara. 1 re
spectfully disagree with and reject
the proposed construction of the
Munger Graduate Residences.
The location is problematic. The
residence would split the undergrad
uate campus in two It would create a
traffic and parking nightmare about
it. especially during construction.
Alvarado Row would be demol
ished, making students' access to
their dorms and Resident Fellows'
access to their homes grossly diffi
cult. Munger would also require the
relocation of the Owen and Rodgers
historical houses, which would in
crease the cost and time of the pro
ject and create the difficulty of hav
ing to find new places to put them.
The Disability Resource Center
would be surrounded by construc
tion for years, making it even more
difficult for people who may already
have some trouble with mobility to
reach the center.
Most importantly, the residences
would place a significant strain on
green and open spaces in the area.
The already-busy Wilbur field would
have to accommodate an additional
(->()() people.
The design does not have the best
interests of the proposed residence's
neighbors in mind. Stern is three sto
ries. while the proposed residences
are five and five-and-a-half stories
tall. The tallest undergraduate resi
dence. Mirrielees. is four stories tall.
The only taller residences are the
high rises in Escondido Village,
which are far away from the center of
campus and not visually pleasing.
Furthermore, the design is to be
done by the same architect that de
signed the Arrillaga Alumni Center,
which is cold and imposing.
The private decision-making pro
cess has been most troubling of all.
According to a Daily article, the Uni
versity claims to have consulted with
Resident Assistants, but that has not
been the case. The University's at
tempt at outreach amounts to an at
tempt to placate affected students.
Affected RFs have only been
minimally consulted. These people's

homes would be ground zero for
noise, dust and disruption during
construction. The home of the Zapa
ta RF would he destroyed. And the
plan shows a paucity of respect for

the RFs whose
homes would be
impacted on a
permanent basis.
The Universi
ty has an obliga
tion to engage in a
constructive dia
logue with donor
Charles T.
Munger that pro
vides for give and
take. This dia-

logue needs to represent the inter
ests of affected community members
in a meaningful way.
The University should also hold
open and publicized sessions where
any and all community members are
welcome to discuss the shortcomings
of the proposed residence. And the
University needs to listen to the con
cerns that affected parties raise, not
sweep them aside in an attempt to
pander to the desires of a wealthy
donor.
A plan that would close Serra and
Zapata to undergraduates, divide
the undergraduate campus and cut
off Chi Theta Chi and Ham
marskjold does not have the interests
of undergraduate students at heart.
Graduate students are not the
enemy, and their housing needs re
quire serious and immediate atten
tion. I would also like to thank
Munger for his generous donation to
the University and desire to improve
Stanford housing.
Unfortunately, the plans as they
now stand would devastate the cam
pus as a whole.
In conclusion, the plans — most
especially the set location — need
to be changed. Not doing so seri
ously jeopardizes the wonderful and
caring undergraduate experience
that Stanford has come to be known
for around the country and the
world and risks diminishing the loy
alty of the current undergraduate
population.
