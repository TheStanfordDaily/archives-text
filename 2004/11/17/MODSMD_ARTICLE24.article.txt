# Commitment of student sparks debate
## Op-Ed Vaden doctors are there to help 
### IRA FRIEDMAN ALEJANDRO MARTINEZ 
A recent Daily article ("Vaden
doctor sends depressed student to
psychiatric ward." Nov. 15) raises
important issues about contem
porary mental health care, but we
fear that it could misinform stu
dents and cause a student in dis
tress to delay or avoid getting'
help. That would be a great dis
service when help is both needed
and available.
Our on-campus counseling
serves have at their core two
principles: providing care and
concern for the welfare of the in
dividual student, and promoting
the sense of control that a student
has over his or her life. For the
vast majority of students who
seek counseling, these goals can
be accomplished through talking
therapy, working toward in
creased understanding of one's
thoughts and feelings. Occasion

ally, the student and therapist
may agree to a trial of medica
tions as an adjunct.
In rare instances, mental
health counselors consider hospi
talization to assist with stabilizing
an individual's life situation. This
approach is taken only if abso
lutely necessary to relieve distress
or to interrupt a self-destructive
downward spiral. Typically, stu
dent and therapist come to agree
ment on the decision and the
goals of the hospital admission.
On occasion, a student may un
derestimate the danger that ac
companies his or her inner dis
tress. A student in such a state of
distress cannot look out for his or
her own welfare and sometimes
may be a threat to someone else's
well-being. To remove a student
from this danger becomes the
most immediate concern.
Involuntary hospitalization
under these circumstances is a
caring and compassionate act at a

time of tremendous inner turmoil,
pain and distress. It is a step never
undertaken lightly. The immedi
ate protection sets the stage for
students to regain the capability
for self-care and independent de
cision making.
This is our message to any stu
dent who is in distress: You do not
need to bear it alone. Seek help
from friends and those whom you
trust and respect. Use profession
al services, such as our counseling
center. Have confidence that your
welfare and autonomy will be our
highest concerns. We will do our
best to help.
