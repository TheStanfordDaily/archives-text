## Patient's well-being is top priority 
### DONALD BARR 
The story about the pseudony
mous Neil Fisher demonstrates lit
tle understanding of Section 5150 of
the California Welfare and Institu
tions Code and of the legal and eth
ical obligations under which it
places physicians.
In authorizing physicians to hos
pitalize patients involuntarily fora
maximum of 72 hours, the state
does not ask the physician to wait
until the patient is certain that a
dangerous mental illness exists —
dangerous either to the patient or to
others that patient may come in
contact with. The law specifically
asks that a physician act "upon
probable cause" that such a condi
tion may exist.
In my 20 years as an emergency
physician. I have invoked Section
5150 on multiple occasions. I have
also had many patients spit angry
epithets in my face far worse than
Neil's. I acted only after careful

consideration — but always under
the clear mandate from the state
that I do so not if I am convinced the
patient is a danger, but because I
have a reasonable concern that the
patient may be a danger.
The last time I did so was a few
months ago. The patient — an edu
cated, middle-class woman about
whom I was deeply concerned —
looked over her shoulder as the po
lice and paramedics wheeled her
out the door and shared with me a
rather unpleasant piece of her
mind. It wasn't until days later that
I received a message containing the
heartfelt thanks of the patient's
family for intervening in a situation
they had felt powerless to change.
The law prevented the treating
physician from contacting Fisher's
parents to discuss the potential dan
ger that Fisher might commit suicide,
unless Fisher had provided written
permission to do so. Had the physi
cian on duty been able to call and
share his or her concerns about the

safety of Fisher's condition, what
would Fisher's father have said?
Had it been my son, I would have
been incensed if the physician had
not placed safety above all other
concerns. Suicide is forever.
In addition. I believe the re
porter erred in reporting only one
side of the story. Had Fisher come
to me as a reporter and asked me to
publish his angry accusations, I
would first have asked for written
permission to discuss his case with
his physicians and to share that in
formation publicly (Editor's Note:
The physician said he could not dis
cuss the case even with permission).
To report only Fisher's side
while leaving the other side unspo
ken does not appear to me to meet
the threshold of journalistic respon
sibility I have come to expect from
The Daily.
