# Op-Ed
## A 						patient's personal experience: Doctors often act in patients' interests 
### 
Editor's Note: Given the unusual
circumstances surrounding the
news article that ran Nov. 15, The
Daily agreed to permit the author of
this op-ed to remain anonymous.
I was upset by The Daily's one
sided. inadequately researched ar
ticle "Vaden doctor sends de
pressed student to psychiatric
ward" (Nov. 15), which failed to
give any backstory, giving the im
pression Neil was headed toward
Vaden for something on the order
of a routine check-up. 5150 — a
law allowing doctors to commit
people for up to three days against
their will — is an important law
that has saved many lives. 1 do not
believe this only in the abstract —
it saved my life freshman year
when I was admitted to Stanford

Hospital and placed in H2.
I initially fought against being
committed. 1 thought I was think
ing rationally and tried to argue
with the doctor, insisting that 1 be
put in the unlocked psychiatric
ward. G2, although I had already
tried to harm myself. 1 was in no po
sition to be making decisions about
my own health, and I was fortunate
enough to have friends willing to
err on the side of caution.
While 1 was frustrated to be in
the hospital. 1 am now thankful for
the experience because it forced
me to acknowledge that 1 could no
longer judge what was best for my
health. It also interrupted my un
healthy behavior patterns and con
nected me with many campus re
sources.
When 1 was released. I felt frag

ile and disoriented, but knew I had
to take the initiative to follow upon
the resources that I had been of
fered. I was able to finish that quar
ter with the support of my profes
sors, residence dean and dorm staff
and by taking several incompletes.
The article took at face value ev
erything that "Neil Fisher" pur
ported to have experienced, with
minimal independent investiga
tion. For example. 1 doubt that a
Daily reporter would have de
scribed H2's isolation unit as Fisher
did, as "all white... and the win
dows were all boarded up." I also
find it difficult to believe that he
was put in to solitary confinement
for only arguing with nurses over a
confiscated DVD.
And while 1 have no doubts
that Fisher was competent enough

to safely handle a DVD. the staff
on H2 must consider all patients
in the ward. Who's to say that an
other patient wouldn't have got
ten hold of the DVD and injured
himself or someone else? If Fisher
had truly been as healthy as he as
serts, then perhaps he would have
understood why the ward has cer
tain rules that they enforce re
gardless of the state of the individ
ual patient.
In addition, most of Fisher's
complaints seemed fueled by anger
and resentment, and many were
not even related to the hospitaliza
tion — For example, the theft of
his bike likely had little to do with
the hospital and more to do with
how he locked it. I wonder if you
were to speak to Fisher a year from
now, rather than a week and a half

after his hospitalization, if he
would view it differently.
The fact that I was in H2 fora
week and in Stanford mental health
facilities fora total of two weeks
does not mean that I am, was or
ever will he insane. Fisher should be
careful about judging his fellow pa
tients so quickly. Two years later. 1
no longer feel the need to try and
justify why I was the one patient
who did not belong there.
Every patient on H2 thought that
they were the unit's sane exception,
from the heroin-addict who wanted
his doctors to prescribe him mor
phine for "pain" to the anorexic
who. in refusing to eat, met only
one of the two criteria used for
Fisher's 5150.
Many people are hesitant to
seek help for mental health issues

because of the stigma attached
and because of an irrational fear
(supported by this article) that
they will be immediately carted off
to a loony bin. The truth is that
5150 is rarely used, and when it is
used to admit students to the hos
pital for their own safety. H2 is
hardly, as Fisher called it, "an in
sane asylum."
I am terribly sorry if Fisher was
wrongly committed, but every doc
tor has a responsibility to protect
their patients from harm, and suici
dal ideation is neither normal nor is
it something to take lightly.

The author was a patient admitted
to the same psychiatric ward as
"Neil Fisher." According to the au
thor, the experience saved the au
thor's life.
