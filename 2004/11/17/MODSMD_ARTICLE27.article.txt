## How to de-polarize the electorate and fix the broken election system 
### EMMA STEWART 
You don't need to be a conspira
cy theorist to have doubts about the
American election system. America
has a decentralized system that is
designed, implemented and over
seen by partisan officials whose suc
cess is often tied to the outcome of
elections.
These same officials choose, cer
tify and operate the equipment that
counts your vote, and then they ver
ify that the count was right. Much of
the equipment they have chosen
provides no way for election moni
tors to insure the machines work
right or for the public to audit the
reported results. We are left with no
choice but to doubt whether our
votes counted and whether the win
ner actually won.
How did the world's greatest
democracy get to this point? Inch by
inch. Efforts meant to modernize
and reform the system, including
the Help America Vote Act. moved
ahead without ensuring the funda
mental tenets of transparency and
auditability.
Electronic voting machines in
use across the country flunk both
tests. Many run on software not
open to public review and don't
allow monitors to insure they->'re
working correctly (Did they start at
zero? Do 10 votes for candidate Z
add 10 votes to that candidates
tally? Both of these were problems
on Nov. 2). Most importantly, many
don't provide any way to reliably
audit or recount the votes.
Doing so requires a paper trail
â€” a printed ballot that a voter can

use to confirm their vote registered
accurately and that can he deposit
ed in a ballot box. This paper trail
allows us to audit our system, ran
domly counting a small percentage
of districts' results to ensure that the
system is working (it is said that au
diting one tenth of 1 percent of the
vote would be enough).
Of course in extremely close
races, it also provides a mechanism
fora recount, but this is not our
chief concern here. The system just
has to be auditable. This is simple
stuff, but it is absolutely critical to
ensure that the machines work and
that no one rigs an election.
In the absence of an auditable
paper trail, we have to rely on exit
polls to verify results. Non-partisan
organizations that specialize in mon
itoring elections across the world use
exit polls to detect fraud and irregu
larities. Without the obstacles of
guessing who will show up (why pre
election polls are often erratic), exit
polling is a highly accurate way to
predict and verify results.
Many industrialized countries
rely almost entirely on exit polls to
call the results, even in close races.
When exit polls and actual vote tal
lies don't produce the same results,
there is reason to be suspicious.
This year exit polls and vote tallies
in Florida and Ohio did not match,
but instead of raising concerns
about the results, some Republi
cans have called for the elimination
of exit polls. The discrepancy and
this reaction does not add to our
confidence in our system or the re
sults of the most recent election.
The first step is acknowledge

ment. Our election system is bro
ken. The next step is to set goals.
We need to take control out of the
hands of partisan officials and put it
in the hands of nonpartisan com
missions. perhaps made up of re
tired judges.
We need every last election ma
chine to be easy to monitor and
audit, with a paper trail as an abso
lute requirement. We need to ran
domly the results in enough districts
to be able to detect fraud. We need
to expand and improve exit polling
so that we have real-time verifica
tion of results and another effective
audit layer. And we need to do it
now.
There is no excuse for America
to be so far behind many new
democracies in this regard. It's em
barrassing, it's discouraging, and
it's just plain wrong.
We believe that we need to re
store confidence in our democracy,
and that the next step is action. We
should start by auditing the results
in Florida and Ohio. We don't be
lieve this audit will change the re
sult. We're not conspiracy theorists.
But we do believe that it will
launch our effort to fix our fatally
flawed system, and it will help to
heal a polarized electorate. Only
then can we all feel secure that our
leaders were and are elected right
fully and fairly. Only then can we
call ourselves a democracy worth
emulating.
