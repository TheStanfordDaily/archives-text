## Approach stem cell research carefully 
### REX GREENE 
The following is an open letter to
Dr. Phillip Pizzo, dean of the Stan
ford School of Medicine.
Dear Dean Pizzo,
Congratulations on your ap
pointment to the Institute for Re
generative Medicine. I'm sure you
will guide this impressive body with
wisdom and vision. However, as
someone who opposed Proposition
71,1 hope that you will take the time
to step back and question the as
sumptions that drive its mission.
The recent political debate made
clear that the initiative was intend
ed to help California "corner the
market" on embryo-derived cellu
lar therapies.
What wasn't so clear was the fact
that embryonic cells may be
uniquely dangerous. Rather than
the area of science "with the highest
likelihood of producing cures for
diseases," it is an unexplored realm
of developmental therapeutics,
which may take decades for conclu
sive evidence of safety and efficacy
— if ever.
It would be a mistake to popu
late the governance of the Institute
with "true believers." The societal,
ethical and scientific implications of
this endeavor may be as momen
tous as the Manhattan Project. Few
people understand that in July 1945
we were uncertain whether we
would destroy the planet with the
first test of a nuclear weapon,
prophetically called the "Trinity
Shot."
In the spirit of scientific curiosity
(and under the exigencies of
wartime) we proceeded and then
experienced a larger epiphany —
recognizing the dreadful threat that
these weapons hold for all of
mankind's future. No less is at stake

with embryonic stem-cell therapies.
No doubt in studying embryonic
cells much will be learned about cel
lular biology, but the stated intent of
the Institute is to produce cell lines
programmed to restore damaged
organs and tissues. During the cam
paign. proponents were not candid
about the medical risks of such ther
apies: introduction of oncogene mu
tations that become malignancies,
incorporation of mutations into ger
minal tissues, transmission of infec
tious diseases, immunological disor
ders and a host of as yet unimagined
iatrogenic diseases.
The history of bioethics is lit
tered with examples of well-intend
ed scientists overstepping their
bounds. The Code of Federal Regu
lations enacted the findings of the
Belmont Report issued nearly 25
years ago in response to concerns
over the expansion of human re
search. It is worrisome that the ini
tiative permits the Institute to
amend federal standards of in
formed consent and IRB protection
of human subjects to suit its "mis
sion and objectives."
This sounds like a rush to be first
to market with a new product. If so,
what risks will be conveyed to phase
one and two human subjects along
the way?
Last year demonstrated the find
ings of SB 322 (Ortiz) that no com
prehensive state or federal regula
tions exist to oversee embryo re
search. For example, the drive for
cloned cell lines leads inevitably to
the question of where all those
human eggs are coming from. Will
the Institute sanction the exploita
tion of women in the interest of sci
ence?
Ramping up for large-scale re
search also calls into question pro
hibitions on financial incentives for
IVF embryo donation. If we're al

ready across the Utilitarian thresh
old, why not permit the market
place to determine the availability
of eggs and embryos? In fact, why
not permit embryo / egg donors to
participate in downstream profits
from the sale of their progeny?
How will a working group that
has four "medical ethicists" out of
19 members satisfy federal require
ments for independent ethical re
view of embryo research? In view of
the complexity of the interests at
stake this seems wholly inadequate.
(Five years ago, the Geron Corpo
ration's ethics advisory board also
recommended independent ethical
review).
Ultimately, embryo research
asks profound questions of the role
of science in society. Has the scien
tific endeavor no limit? Is curing
disease the only end of medicine?
Does a tsunami of commercialism,
desperation and self-interest trump
ethical concerns for the protection
of vulnerable populations?
While religious views differ as to
the moral status of embryos, it is
nonetheless clear that they are alive
and human; otherwise they have no
value.
Throughout history, classes of
humans have been exploited for the
benefit of others. To make Califor
nia the Mecca for an industry that
uses live human embryos for its raw
material should give us pause.
This is a unique opportunity for
the top academics in this state to do
the right thing in the right way, to
engage in thoughtful deliberation
about the strictures that must be in
place before launching this new
venture in commercial embryology.
It's worth the extra time and effort.

Last year demonstrated the find
ings of SB 322 (Ortiz) that no com
prehensive state or federal regula
tions exist to oversee embryo re
search. For example, the drive for
cloned cell lines leads inevitably to
the question of where all those
human eggs are coming from. Will
the Institute sanction the exploita
tion of women in the interest of sci
ence?
Ramping up for large-scale re
search also calls into question pro
hibitions on financial incentives for
IVF embryo donation. If we're al

ready across the Utilitarian thresh
old, why not permit the market
place to determine the availability
of eggs and embryos? In fact, why
not permit embryo / egg donors to
participate in downstream profits
from the sale of their progeny?
How will a working group that
has four "medical ethicists" out of
19 members satisfy federal require
ments for independent ethical re
view of embryo research? In view of
the complexity of the interests at
stake this seems wholly inadequate.
(Five years ago, the Geron Corpo
ration's ethics advisory board also
recommended independent ethical
review).
Ultimately, embryo research
asks profound questions of the role
of science in society. Has the scien
tific endeavor no limit? Is curing
disease the only end of medicine?
Does a tsunami of commercialism,
desperation and self-interest trump
ethical concerns for the protection
of vulnerable populations?
While religious views differ as to
the moral status of embryos, it is
nonetheless clear that they are alive
and human; otherwise they have no
value.
Throughout history, classes of
humans have been exploited for the
benefit of others. To make Califor
nia the Mecca for an industry that
uses live human embryos for its raw
material should give us pause.
This is a unique opportunity for
the top academics in this state to do
the right thing in the right way, to
engage in thoughtful deliberation
about the strictures that must be in
place before launching this new
venture in commercial embryology.
It's worth the extra time and effort.

The following is an open letter to
Dr. Phillip Pizzo, dean of the Stan
ford School of Medicine.
Dear Dean Pizzo,
Congratulations on your ap
pointment to the Institute for Re
generative Medicine. I'm sure you
will guide this impressive body with
wisdom and vision. However, as
someone who opposed Proposition
71,1 hope that you will take the time
to step back and question the as
sumptions that drive its mission.
The recent political debate made
clear that the initiative was intend
ed to help California "corner the
market" on embryo-derived cellu
lar therapies.
What wasn't so clear was the fact
that embryonic cells may be
uniquely dangerous. Rather than
the area of science "with the highest
likelihood of producing cures for
diseases," it is an unexplored realm
of developmental therapeutics,
which may take decades for conclu
sive evidence of safety and efficacy
— if ever.
It would be a mistake to popu
late the governance of the Institute
with "true believers." The societal,
ethical and scientific implications of
this endeavor may be as momen
tous as the Manhattan Project. Few
people understand that in July 1945
we were uncertain whether we
would destroy the planet with the
first test of a nuclear weapon,
prophetically called the "Trinity
Shot."
In the spirit of scientific curiosity
(and under the exigencies of
wartime) we proceeded and then
experienced a larger epiphany —
recognizing the dreadful threat that
these weapons hold for all of
mankind's future. No less is at stake

with embryonic stem-cell therapies.
No doubt in studying embryonic
cells much will be learned about cel
lular biology, but the stated intent of
the Institute is to produce cell lines
programmed to restore damaged
organs and tissues. During the cam
paign. proponents were not candid
about the medical risks of such ther
apies: introduction of oncogene mu
tations that become malignancies,
incorporation of mutations into ger
minal tissues, transmission of infec
tious diseases, immunological disor
ders and a host of as yet unimagined
iatrogenic diseases.
The history of bioethics is lit
tered with examples of well-intend
ed scientists overstepping their
bounds. The Code of Federal Regu
lations enacted the findings of the
Belmont Report issued nearly 25
years ago in response to concerns
over the expansion of human re
search. It is worrisome that the ini
tiative permits the Institute to
amend federal standards of in
formed consent and IRB protection
of human subjects to suit its "mis
sion and objectives."
This sounds like a rush to be first
to market with a new product. If so,
what risks will be conveyed to phase
one and two human subjects along
the way?
