(U-WIRE) ITHAC A, N Y
Given the current circumstances
surrounding the national shortage of
influenza vaccinations, Cornell Uni
versity's Gannett Health Center has
taken multiple precautions in pro
tecting the community against an
outbreak of influenza in the region.
Gannett received only one
eighth of its usual yearly supply and
had to cancel its 40 flu vaccination
clinics, originally available every
year around this season. It must also
follow the new guidelines set by the
U.S. Center for Disease Control in
administering the vaccine, which in
clude factors such as age and under
lying medical conditions.
As a result of the shortage, this
year Gannett has had to scale back
the number of flu shots given to ( or
nell's faculty and staff.
"Many faculty and staff members
are used to getting the shot every
year, and they called every day when
news of the vaccine shortage first
broke, wanting to know whether and
when they could get a flu shot," said
Sharon Dittman. associate director
of university health services.
Dittman added. "Not all people
in the high-risk category have cho
sen to get [the llii vaccine]."
She also explained that because
of the shortage. Gannett has had to
cancel its promotional activities,
such as advertisements encouraging
the community to get the vaccine.
Upon receiving its supply of vaccina
tions, Gannett also had to work with
the Tompkins County Health De
partment to assess the need for the
vaccine locally before being able to
administer the vaccine.
Though most students at a col
lege campus do not qualify for the
vaccinations under the CDC guide
lines. there are still many who are el

igible.
In fact, about two weeks ago
Gannett contacted over I.(MX) stu
dents on campus who may be in the
high-risk category for the disease.
These students may qualify if they
indicated any asthmatic or other
health conditions on their health his
tory form. Those who received this
letter of notification in the mail are
encouraged to contact Gannett to
get the vaccine.
One version of the letter stated.
"The 11 u vaccine offers an extra mea
sure of protection that will help you
reduce the likelihood of experienc
ing lost time, sick days, and health
complications. In spite of rumors to
the contrary, getting a flu vaccine
does not give you the flu or even flu
like symptoms. You may have a sore
spot on your arm fora day or two.
but it won't set you back on your
study, work or fun."
According to (iannett's Web site.
Cornell employees and students
aged 65 years or older, or are 2 to 65
years of age with chronic medical
conditions, should contact Gannett
to schedule a vaccination.
Other factors also determine eli
gibility. For details. (iannett encour
ages direct consultation with them.
"We encourage anybody who
wonders if they qualify for the vac
cine to come in and talk to us about
getting it." Dittman said.
Members of the Cornell commu
nity can also do their part to prevent
exposure to the disease.
"With fewer people protected by
the vaccine, there's a higher chance
individuals will be exposed if the flu
comes to Cornell." Dittman said.
She pointed out that simple tasks
such as frequently washing one's
hands, avoiding close contact with
people who are sick, avoiding shar
ing utensils, or covering one's mouth
when coughing or sneezing can help
a lot in preventing the flu.
