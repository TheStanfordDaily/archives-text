# Stanford, Cal join forces to ensure succesful Big Game weekend
## 
### MARINA LIEBAN 
Few of the thousands of Cardinal
fans who will travel across the Bay
this weekend are aware of the in
tense planning required to make Big
Game a reality.
Planning for the game begins
long before kickoff. with two fall
quarter meetings held by the Big
Game Joint Committee, a group
formed in the early 19905.
The committee consists of game
management personnel from the
Stanford and Cal athletic depart
ments. police deputies, chairs of spir
it groups like Axe Conim and band
leaders from both schools. At these
meetings, each side explained its
plans for Big Game in an effort to
foster a cooperative working rela
tionship.
"At that level it doesn't become
Stanford versus Cal," said Stanford
Police Deputy Ken Bates, a member
of this year's committee. "It's what
can we do to ensure that everybody's
having a good time, that the event is
a success and everybody's safe."
The overarching goals and gener
al agreements reached at this year's
meetings were "basically the same as
every other year," said Axe Com
mittee Chairman Amy Daley, a ju

nior. "The agreements [were] that
the students will conduct themselves
in a reasonable manner, that there
will be no alcohol allowed in [Memo
rial Stadium|... and there will be
lots of security around, especially in
the student sections, trying to keep
things under control."
Student conduct is a main con
cern for the Stanford Athletic De
partment. which, in The Daily last
week, published an advertisement in
which football head coach Buddy
Teevens asked students to "remain
respectful" at this year's Big Game.
"Stanford should always remain a
classy institution and be presented
by the students in such a fashion,"
Teevens wrote.
Shocked at the behavior of Cal
students during Big Game 2002,
Teevens said he hopes students will
remain considerate of all fans at Sat
urday's game.
"I've been in some wild rivalries
and I've never seen anything like
that," Teevens said of the problems
two years ago. "People swearing at
the Stanford people and just flipping
them off... just classless, and they
were all students, and that to me is
not us as an institution." he said.

Members of the Axe Committee sound the Train Whistle to signify that there are only 87 hours until Big Game.
Some students, however, argued
that fan behavior is not something
that can he controlled.
"Regardless of what Coach
Teevens requests. I feel like our be
havior will be dictated by the flow
of the game," says a senior, who
asked to remain anonymous. "If
Stanford is winning, we'll let Cal
hear about it. if we are getting
crushed you won't hear anything
from our section."
At Memorial Stadium, a police
force consisting of officers from

both Stanford and Cal will work to
gether to keep the peace Saturday.
"It's kind of like a collaboration
between the two agencies," Bates
said. "We will send a delegation of
officers and support staff over to
Cal to assist them wherever they
need." Besides the two police de
partments. a private security com
pany has also been hired to keep
the event peaceful, said Gordon
Bayne. assistant athletic director
for event management at Cal.
Police will be searching fans for

restricted items, which include
video cameras, coolers and any
beverages.
"In the past. [Stanford students)
have taken items of contraband
over there ... and it's not going to
be tolerated," Bates said. "(Stu
dents found with inappropriate
items] could suffer the ramifica
tions of law enforcement or the in
ternal systems, be it of Cal or Stan
ford University, for any breach of
violations," he added.

Nothing is sacred in Gaieties this year, with issues ranging from the random hook-ups at
frat parties to the peanut-free Ricker Dining Hall and everything in between.
