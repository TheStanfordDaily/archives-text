# U. Penn drinking policy shifts from hands-off to prevention, teaching

lift was considered, the ban re
mained in place that Spring Fling
weekend.
Many students were outraged by
the ban — which was enacted with
out seeking undergraduate input —
and staged a massive protest with
over 1,000 participants on College
Green.
During the ban, Rodin and then-
Provost Robert Barchi started the
Working Group on Alcohol Abuse,
composed of 15 students and seven
faculty members, to consider a new
campuswide policy.
The group's composition differed
significantly from that of previous
committees, which had placed
greater emphasis on faculty and ad
ministrative input.
"I think |Barchi] knew that at this
time ... it needed to be student-dri
ven. or it wasn't going to be able to
happen," Director of Alcohol Policy
Initiatives Stephanie Ives said.

Ultimately, the group produced
44 policy proposals and initiatives.
These recommendations supplanted
Penn's existing alcohol and drug pol
icy and the Greek Alcohol Manage
ment policy, which had held Greek
students to a much stricter standard
than the rest of the campus.
"The University's alcohol policy
essentially reflected what was in the
Greek alcohol policy," Office of Fra
ternity and Sorority Affairs Director
Scott Reikofski said.
The new measures focus on alco
hol abuse rather than use, thereby
defining the University's goal as
managing undergraduate consump
tion rather than attempting to elimi
nate it.
One major change to the policy
was the creation of a new position of
director of alcohol policy initiatives,
signaling Penn's greater commit
ment to proactive alcohol monitor
ing.

The University of Pennsylvania's ap
proach to student drinking has gone
through a series of drastic changes
over the past decade. Prior to 1999,
Penn had a hands-off policy that
merely reiterated state law. The cur
rent policy is more comprehensive,
approaching the issue from a per
spective of education, prevention
and enforcement.
The policy has been in flux since
March 1999, when Penn alumnus
Michael Tobin died at the Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity house after
consuming large amounts of alcohol.
Within days of Tobin's death,
then-University President Judith
Rodin enacted a campus-wide ban
on alcohol that lasted until April 28
of that year. Though a temporary

At that time, a campus-wide
"Bring Your Own Beer" policy was
also instated, requiring students to
bring their own drinks to campus
registered parties if they chose to
drink.
Yet, after alcohol monitors re
peatedly reported widespread viola
tions of the BYOB policy — recog
nizing that the majority of party
throwers provided alcohol for their
guests — the rule was taken off the
books only one year after its imple
mentation.
"The BYOB policy is actually the
only policy clause that was changed .
.. Organizations were still providing
alcohol at parties, and we didn't
want to have policy on the books that
wasn't working," Ives said.
While Ives stressed that fhe alco
hol policy is a living document under
constant review, no changes have
been made to the official guidelines
since that change in 20(H).
