## Two bowl berths nailed over Pac-10 weekend 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Pacific-10 Conference will quali
fy only five teams for bowl games this
year (the conference has seven affilia
tions), and for Oregon and Oregon State
it all comes down to the Civil War.
Both the Ducks (who lost Saturday)
and the Beavers (who won) are 5-5, and
when they play Saturday in C'orvallis,
only one of them will qualify fora bowl
berth.
While the Oregon schools have to
wait, several teams' postseason destinies
were settled Saturday. Washington State
is out, having lost to Arizona State;
UCLA is in, earning its sixth win with a
victory over the Ducks; Stanford is out,
after a loss to the Beavers. And, finally.
Southern California clinched the Pac-10
title and a berth in — at the worst — the
Rose Bowl.
It is in part a function of the strong
teams atop the Pac-10 — USC is perfect
in the Pac-10, while California has only
lost to LISC. and Arizona State has only
lost to Cal and USC — that the confer
ence will only qualify five bowl teams.

Another factor was the tough out-of
conference schedules that both Oregon
schools played.
Without 112 urther ado, let's take a clos
er look at last weekend in the Pac-10.
No. 1 USC 49, Arizona 9
The Wildcats never stood a chance in
Los Angeles, as the defending national
champions steamrolled them en route to
their 10th win. LenDale White led the
Trojans with 119 yards rushing and three
touchdowns on 16 carries. Four different
players had passing performances, in
cluding Matt Leinart's 27-of-35 effort
for 280 yards, three touchdowns and no
interceptions.
Dwayne Jarrett led the Trojans with
six receptions for 144 yards and two
touchdowns, as USC scored 35 second
half points to bounce back from a 3-0 sec
ond-quarter deficit.
Richard Kovalcheck was 15-of-32
passing for 165 yards and a third-quarter
touchdown to Steve Fleming (who led
the Wildcats with 35 yards receiving), but
was intercepted twice. Mike Bell had a
solid effort against the Trojans' staunch

defense, carrying 15 times for 83 yards.
No. 5 Cal 42, Washington 12
Cal admittedly sleep-walked through
the first half in Seattle, entering the
break with a slim 7-6 lead. But it scored
five second-half touchdowns to quickly
put away the Huskies, the Pac-10's lone
team without a conference win.
Marshawn Lynch had a 29-yard
touchdown catch in the first half for Cal
and broke loose on 32- and 70-yard scor
ing runs in the second half. Lynch fin
ished with 122 yards on 12 carries, while
J.J. Arrington ran 22 times for 122 yards
of his own and one touchdown. Aaron
Rodgers was just 12-of-23 for 161 yards,
two touchdowns and two interceptions.
The Huskies got two field goals from
Evan Knudson and a 77-yard scoring pass
from Casey Paus to Craig Chambers in
the third quarter to cut Cal's lead to 14-
12, but that was all they would manage.
Paus was 20-of-44 for 328 yards, but
he was intercepted three times. Kenny
James led the Huskies with 99 yards
