# Cardinal's training put to the test in Long Beach
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a two-week break from competi
tion, the No. 4 Stanford women's swim
team is ready to dive back into the pool. It
will have that chance at this weekend's
Speedo Cup in Long Beach. Calif., which
runs Thursday through Saturday.
Following two straight weeks of racing,
which brought a victory over No. 22
Hawaii and then a loss to No. 6 Texas, the
Cardinal had a two-week hiatus.
While the Cardinal's focus during the
break was on training for this weekend
and the rest of the season, the squad's ul
timate aims are still strong performances
at the Pacific-10 Conference meet in
February and the NCAA Champi
onships in March.
The Speedo Cup, hosted by UC-Irvine.
will feature female swimmers from 20

schools, including No. 13 USC and Pacific
— teams Stanford will face in dual meet
competition come January.
Head coach Richard Quick is happy
about the opportunity this meet will give
his team to assess its progress and to pre
view the kind of competition Stanford is ul
timately working toward.
"The Speedo Cup meet is a pretty good
way to evaluate our fall training because
the competition is a little bit like the Pac-10
and NCAA Championships in that it is a
three-day preliminary and final meet,"
Quick said.
The meet will consist of preliminary
qualifying rounds and will culminate with
final races where each event winner will
be crowned. While the team always wants
to win. victory is not the sole focus of the
competition.
"This weekend I hope to get a couple of
'A' cuts out of the way so I can take a little

hit of the pressure off the rest of the season,
and I can just focus on training and getting
ready for NCAAs," said sophomore De
siree Stahley.
Stahley has been surprisingly successful
in preseason competition so far. taking top
honors for the first time in her collegiate
career with the 500-yard freestyle in
Hawaii and then repeating in Texas.
"I am really happy with where 1 am
right now," Stahley said. "I've done some
[races] close to my personal best times
ever. That's exciting. I have a couple of my
B' standards out of the way. so I'm pretty
happy with where the fall is heading."
Senior backstroker Amy Wagner
agrees that the team is focusing on more
than winning races in Long Beach.
"We've been training really hard, and
it's a training meet," Wagner said. "We're
not expecting to go out and put all person
al best times, but I think we're preparing to

do great things and have a really good end
of-season meet."
This is a team that from the very be
ginning has focused on success in March's
National Championships. While presea
son and Pac-10 meets are important, they
are only stepping stones toward the na
tional championship.
The Stanford women have been disap
pointed with their last two national finish
es, sixth in 2002-03 and fifth in 2003-04 —
the team's lowest finishes in all the years it
has competed at NCAAs. Stanford's last
national championship team took the title
in 1997-98 and marked the Cardinal's sixth
victory in seven years.
This year's squad believes that it has
what it takes to return to the podium at the
end of the season.
"As a team we want to be NCAA cham
pions this year," said Wagner. "It's been
too long since we've been champions, so
that's what we're looking for. I think we
can do it."
Stahley added: "This year we are ex
tremely focused for NCAAs. I think that
we have a great shot at being the top team
there. Training-wise everything looks
wonderful. Everybody is putting in amaz
ing work, and our mindset is really positive
and really focused right now."
With some major players recovered
from injury and illness — setbacks that
hurt the team in Texas — the swimmers
are looking to turn their positivity and
hard work into victory this weekend. It
will be a chance for Stanford to put up
good times and chip away at the qualify
ing standards before taking a two
month break from competition over the
holidays.
More importantly, according to Quick,
"It's really a great opportunity to evaluate
our training."
Before heading to Long Beach, Quick
and Stanford's Olympians, junior Dana
Kirk, junior Kristen Caverly, and fresh
man Caroline Bruce, along with 2004
graduate Tara Kirk, went to New York
Monday to attend the Golden Goggle
Awards, given to the nation's top swim
mers in several categories.
The entire 2004 Olympic team was in at
tendance to honor the stars among them.
Among the winners were multiple medal
ists Michael Phelps, for Male Athlete of
the Year and Male Race of the Year, and
Natalie Coughlin, who was named Female
Athlete of the Year.
After this short break, the Olympians
are back in the pool and once again train
ing for this weekend's meet.

Sophomore Anna Strohl will travel to Long Beach, Calif, tomorrow with the rest of the Stanford women's swim team. The Cardinal are
hoping the Speedo Cup will show them how much progress they have made during the preseason.
After a two-week break from competi
tion, the No. 4 Stanford women's swim
team is ready to dive back into the pool. It
will have that chance at this weekend's
Speedo Cup in Long Beach. Calif., which
runs Thursday through Saturday.
Following two straight weeks of racing,
which brought a victory over No. 22
Hawaii and then a loss to No. 6 Texas, the
Cardinal had a two-week hiatus.
While the Cardinal's focus during the
break was on training for this weekend
and the rest of the season, the squad's ul
timate aims are still strong performances
at the Pacific-10 Conference meet in
February and the NCAA Champi
onships in March.
The Speedo Cup, hosted by UC-Irvine.
will feature female swimmers from 20

schools, including No. 13 USC and Pacific
— teams Stanford will face in dual meet
competition come January.
Head coach Richard Quick is happy
about the opportunity this meet will give
his team to assess its progress and to pre
view the kind of competition Stanford is ul
timately working toward.
"The Speedo Cup meet is a pretty good
way to evaluate our fall training because
the competition is a little bit like the Pac-10
and NCAA Championships in that it is a
three-day preliminary and final meet,"
Quick said.
The meet will consist of preliminary
qualifying rounds and will culminate with
final races where each event winner will
be crowned. While the team always wants
to win. victory is not the sole focus of the
competition.
"This weekend I hope to get a couple of
'A' cuts out of the way so I can take a little

hit of the pressure off the rest of the season,
and I can just focus on training and getting
ready for NCAAs," said sophomore De
siree Stahley.
Stahley has been surprisingly successful
in preseason competition so far. taking top
honors for the first time in her collegiate
career with the 500-yard freestyle in
Hawaii and then repeating in Texas.
"I am really happy with where 1 am
right now," Stahley said. "I've done some
[races] close to my personal best times
ever. That's exciting. I have a couple of my
B' standards out of the way. so I'm pretty
happy with where the fall is heading."
Senior backstroker Amy Wagner
agrees that the team is focusing on more
than winning races in Long Beach.
"We've been training really hard, and
it's a training meet," Wagner said. "We're
not expecting to go out and put all person
al best times, but I think we're preparing to

do great things and have a really good end
of-season meet."
This is a team that from the very be
ginning has focused on success in March's
National Championships. While presea
son and Pac-10 meets are important, they
are only stepping stones toward the na
tional championship.
The Stanford women have been disap
pointed with their last two national finish
es, sixth in 2002-03 and fifth in 2003-04 —
the team's lowest finishes in all the years it
has competed at NCAAs. Stanford's last
national championship team took the title
in 1997-98 and marked the Cardinal's sixth
victory in seven years.
This year's squad believes that it has
what it takes to return to the podium at the
end of the season.
"As a team we want to be NCAA cham
pions this year," said Wagner. "It's been
too long since we've been champions, so
that's what we're looking for. I think we
can do it."
Stahley added: "This year we are ex
tremely focused for NCAAs. I think that
we have a great shot at being the top team
there. Training-wise everything looks
wonderful. Everybody is putting in amaz
ing work, and our mindset is really positive
and really focused right now."
With some major players recovered
from injury and illness — setbacks that
hurt the team in Texas — the swimmers
are looking to turn their positivity and
hard work into victory this weekend. It
will be a chance for Stanford to put up
good times and chip away at the qualify
ing standards before taking a two
month break from competition over the
holidays.
More importantly, according to Quick,
"It's really a great opportunity to evaluate
our training."
Before heading to Long Beach, Quick
and Stanford's Olympians, junior Dana
Kirk, junior Kristen Caverly, and fresh
man Caroline Bruce, along with 2004
graduate Tara Kirk, went to New York
Monday to attend the Golden Goggle
Awards, given to the nation's top swim
mers in several categories.
The entire 2004 Olympic team was in at
tendance to honor the stars among them.
Among the winners were multiple medal
ists Michael Phelps, for Male Athlete of
the Year and Male Race of the Year, and
Natalie Coughlin, who was named Female
Athlete of the Year.
