Hey, you. Yes, you, the freshman girl in
Wilbur who can't correctly identify a curl pat
tern. I see you, drinking your outrageously
overpriced Snapple in the dining hall and
snickering about teen drama with your re
markably unattractive friends. You need to
learn a few things about life. More specifical
ly, you need to learn about football.
It has recently come to my attention that a
large portion of the Stanford student body is
pitifully uninformed when it comes to sports. I
learned this when a friend of mine (yes, a girl)
corrected me when I said something about the

New York Giants. "You
mean the Jets," she said.
"The New York football
team is the Jets."
Football, particularly
with the recent success of the
men's basketball team, has
become the ugly duckling of
sports on campus in terms of
attention devoted to it. (1
could mention field hockey
here, but that would actually

— j
imply that it had a following to begin with.)
Of course, we expect this to suddenly
change when Stanford travels to Cal this
weekend.
We've all heard the history of the Stanford-
Cal rivalry as a part of the RA indoctrination
program during freshman year, when we were
shown yellowing newspapers hailing the re
turn of the Axe in larger type than the first
moon landing warranted.
However, since then the antagonism has
cooled off to the point where most students at
either institution cannot typically identify
their team's record. The only "beat Cal" sen
timent around Stanford outside of the Yell
Leaders— when they're not busy standing
with their backs to the game and bringing
more shame to Stanford than the Serial Grop
er — is expressed on the back of Pizza My
Heart shirts.
Stanford loves to build up Big Game,
rolling out a big (but not too big, that might of
fend the trustees) bonfire and a loud (but not
too loud, that might wake the law students)
rally that is usually attended by a vast army ap
proaching one hundred students.
The centerpiece of this carefully controlled
outpouring of lukewarm emotion is the Band.
Boy, do we love our Band. So much, in fact,
that we're willing to use it as the focal point of
our quirky image, so long as it doesn't actual
ly do anything so offensive as to be funny.
Luckily, during my three-year tenure here,
the Band hasn't done anything that is even ar
guably funny, so the administration can rest
easy on that front.
What all this is saying is that the school
can't make you care about football. One of the
first lessons you learn as a student or employ
ee is that, by and large, any sort of party or
rally organized by the governing body is
bound to suck. It's like having your parents
plan your 21st birthday party. The emotion
around Big Game should come from an envi
ronment populated by students who genuine
ly HATE Cal and dream of strafing Telegraph
Avenue from a B-52 bomber, not from Admit
Weekend and Stanford pamphlets chronicling
a tasteful and respectful rivalry. You should
get out there and spread the hate.
Because, let's be honest, nobody respects
you. You're a Stanford student. You are a
smug, sycophantic tool who was a nerd in high
school and wears a "West Lag" T-shirt around
campus. You put trite quotes about procrasti
nation in your IM profile and drink overpriced
soy lattes. This is exactly what Berkeley thinks
of you, and with good reason, because you
don't know anything about football, and you
aren't going to Big Game. They look down on
you. and you are doing nothing about it.

So prove them wrong. Go to Berkeley this weekend,
see the sights, smell the smells, ignore a homeless person
and take in a football game.
Like the team, we have a chance to turn things around
as fans on Saturday. The SEC thinks the Pac-10 and all
its denizens have a compendium of football knowledge
that could be inscribed on a fortune cookie slip. (This is
to say nothing of the difficulty of the majors in Cattle In
semination and Moonshine Brewing that these universi
ties hand out, but a valid criticism nonetheless.)
We can show that we want to be there, that ours is a
real rivalry and not a burnt-out. laid-back version of the
football wars in the South.
I'm asking you, freshman girl, to care.
Care because the Stanford football team is represen
tative of something good that's about more than sports.
Care because these are your friends, your brothers. Care
because they could deny Cal its first Rose Bowl bid in al
most 50 years.
Care because it's your school that's being mocked by
thousands of people in a city across the Bay that repre
sents everything that is awful about California. Care be
cause right now, you are the reason why other people

Leave the bubble: Cal
(which sucks) awaits

mock Stanford — the uninformed, sports-unconscious
dork who DOESN'T care.
On Saturday the Cardinal will go into Berkeley as
huge underdogs. Your background in high-school tennis
may not help them on the field, hut you can sure as hell
help them in other ways. Go to Big Game and show Cal
that our student body isn't the socially retarded, superi
ority-complex mass that they make us out to be.
Sit up on the hill with the proletariat, wear something
red, and bring some batteries to throw at Oski the Bear
and some brass knuckles to fight off the blue and gold.
And scream at Aaron Rodgers until your throat is raw,
until we can bring back something we haven't had in two
years.
We may be dorks now, but we can turn it around. But
there is one universal truth that will continue to live on
through the echelons of history.
Cal sucks.

Dan McCarthy is a junior who forgot that if yon really
don't know anything about football, you have no idea who
Aaron Rodgers is. Look it up, schmuck. Or ask Dan at
