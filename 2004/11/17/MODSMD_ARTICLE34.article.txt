# Our Big Game barely rivals some other collegiate rivalries
## 
### CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON 
It's the most wonderful week of the year.
Rivalry weekend. Most football teams
end their regular season with a tilt against
their natural enemy, fighting for wins and
bragging rights along with weird baubles
like the Old Oaken Bucket (Indiana-Pur
due) and the Golden Egg (two very forget
table Mississippi and Mississippi State
teams.)
I'm going to leave the Big Game trash
talking to my colleague Spencer Porter. (I as
sume he will not let me down.) I would like to
think the band conductor's impalement of a
stuffed bear onto the White Plaza fountain
will not be Stanford's best achievement this
week.
But we must wait and see. Between now
and then, there are too many choice story
lines across the nation to ignore.
For starters, the Utah-BYU game has a
somewhat incestuous bent, as Mormon pa
triarch Brigham Young helped to found the
U of U.

Undefeated Utah is looking to this game
as its last chance to make the statement that
could vault it into the Fiesta Bowl. Last sea
son. the Utes ended BYU's 261-game scor
ing streak with a 3-0 victory.
To add more lire, three years ago Utah al
most handed the Cougars their first defeat
before coughing it up at the end. B YU would
love to close the deal this time around and
earn a bowl trip in the pr<Kess.
There is apparently no truth to rumors
that the Stanford Band has been solicited to
needle BYU fans.
Washington State has not won the Apple
Cup against Washington since 1997. when it
clinched a Rose Bowl bid on UW's turf.
While this game will be fiercely contested,
it's too bad the teams have a combined five
wins. No one will be going anywhere after
wards except, hopefully, the shower.
Last November, the visiting Florida
State Seminoles felt that they had so
emasculated the Florida Gators in their
controversially officiated, last-minute 38-
34 win. that thev could dance on the mid

field logo.
It's not hard to imagine that Florida play
ers weren't very happy about that, and they
responded with a violent confrontation. One
player took a swing at an opponent with his
helmet.
This was the third all-out brawl between
the two teams in their past seven meetings.
I'm looking forward to the fourth — they're
getting so coordinated it looks like a Jackie
Chan movie.
As for USC-UCLA. which isn't even
going to be played for two more weeks. let's
be honest... who really cares?
Everyone knows No. 1 USC is going to
roll like Nightrider and end up in the nation
al championship Orange Bowl game. Why
waste time analyzing a one-sided matchup?
(My guarantee: if I'm wrong on this one, I'll
drink that wheat-grass smoothie from Jamba
Juice.)
No trophy or trinket could add to the in
tensity of college football's most dignified ri
valry. Mighigan-Ohio State, played with un
matchable fire but tempered with mutual re

spect and Midwestern pride.
Michigan quarterback Chad Henne
summed it up this way: "They hate us and we
hate them."
The run-up to the game has been tainted
by allegations of improper benefits given to
Ohio State players, including disgruntled ex
tailback Maurice Clarett. I'm really shocked
by all that — I figured that the Buckeyes
would clean up their act after 2000, when a
starter was kicked off the team with a 0.0
grade-point average.
Having already clinched a share of their
42nd Big Ten title, the Wolverines can lock
up their second straight Rose Bowl by win
ning in Columbus.
The Iron Bowl — Auburn-Alabama —
may be the nastiest game of them all, di
viding the state into two partisan pockets
and leaving acrimony in its wake for the
entire year. The Tuscaloosa afternoon will
be searing with 10-0 Auburn's National
Championship hopes in the balance.
The score will be closer than it should be,
which may matter to poll voters, but who

scored what against whom will he a moot
point within three weeks.
If Auburn heats the conference's best de
fense in Alabama and then defeats a Ten
nessee team it already beat 34-10, and
doesn't make the Orange Bowl, mark my
words: the South will burn again.
The coolest rivalry game, though, has
sadly already been played.
lowa and Minnesota play fora pig. That's
right — Floyd of Rosedale, a bronze likeness
of the original hog that was bet between state
governors so many years ago.
Floyd has already been sent back down
to lowa City, where he is quietly relaxing
and getting ready to watch this week's
games.
And that's what I'll be doing after I get
back from Berkeley. Somebody better de
frost the Buffalo wings.

Christopher P. Anderson tried to buy one day
of cable service for this Saturday. E-mail him
to see how that worked out for him at cpan

clinched a Rose Bowl bid on UW's turf.
While this game will be fiercely contested,
it's too bad the teams have a combined five
wins. No one will be going anywhere after
wards except, hopefully, the shower.
Last November, the visiting Florida
State Seminoles felt that they had so
emasculated the Florida Gators in their
controversially officiated, last-minute 38-
34 win. that thev could dance on the mid

field logo.
It's not hard to imagine that Florida play
ers weren't very happy about that, and they
responded with a violent confrontation. One
player took a swing at an opponent with his
helmet.
This was the third all-out brawl between
the two teams in their past seven meetings.
I'm looking forward to the fourth — they're
getting so coordinated it looks like a Jackie
Chan movie.
As for USC-UCLA. which isn't even
going to be played for two more weeks. let's
be honest... who really cares?
Everyone knows No. 1 USC is going to
roll like Nightrider and end up in the nation
al championship Orange Bowl game. Why
waste time analyzing a one-sided matchup?
(My guarantee: if I'm wrong on this one, I'll
drink that wheat-grass smoothie from Jamba
Juice.)
No trophy or trinket could add to the in
tensity of college football's most dignified ri
valry. Mighigan-Ohio State, played with un
matchable fire but tempered with mutual re

spect and Midwestern pride.
Michigan quarterback Chad Henne
summed it up this way: "They hate us and we
hate them."
The run-up to the game has been tainted
by allegations of improper benefits given to
Ohio State players, including disgruntled ex
tailback Maurice Clarett. I'm really shocked
by all that — I figured that the Buckeyes
would clean up their act after 2000, when a
starter was kicked off the team with a 0.0
grade-point average.
Having already clinched a share of their
42nd Big Ten title, the Wolverines can lock
up their second straight Rose Bowl by win
ning in Columbus.
The Iron Bowl — Auburn-Alabama —
may be the nastiest game of them all, di
viding the state into two partisan pockets
and leaving acrimony in its wake for the
entire year. The Tuscaloosa afternoon will
be searing with 10-0 Auburn's National
Championship hopes in the balance.
The score will be closer than it should be,
which may matter to poll voters, but who

scored what against whom will he a moot
point within three weeks.
If Auburn heats the conference's best de
fense in Alabama and then defeats a Ten
nessee team it already beat 34-10, and
doesn't make the Orange Bowl, mark my
words: the South will burn again.
The coolest rivalry game, though, has
sadly already been played.
lowa and Minnesota play fora pig. That's
right — Floyd of Rosedale, a bronze likeness
of the original hog that was bet between state
governors so many years ago.
Floyd has already been sent back down
to lowa City, where he is quietly relaxing
and getting ready to watch this week's
games.
And that's what I'll be doing after I get
back from Berkeley. Somebody better de
frost the Buffalo wings.

It's the most wonderful week of the year.
Rivalry weekend. Most football teams
end their regular season with a tilt against
their natural enemy, fighting for wins and
bragging rights along with weird baubles
like the Old Oaken Bucket (Indiana-Pur
due) and the Golden Egg (two very forget
table Mississippi and Mississippi State
teams.)
I'm going to leave the Big Game trash
talking to my colleague Spencer Porter. (I as
sume he will not let me down.) I would like to
think the band conductor's impalement of a
stuffed bear onto the White Plaza fountain
will not be Stanford's best achievement this
week.
But we must wait and see. Between now
and then, there are too many choice story
lines across the nation to ignore.
For starters, the Utah-BYU game has a
somewhat incestuous bent, as Mormon pa
triarch Brigham Young helped to found the
U of U.

Undefeated Utah is looking to this game
as its last chance to make the statement that
could vault it into the Fiesta Bowl. Last sea
son. the Utes ended BYU's 261-game scor
ing streak with a 3-0 victory.
To add more lire, three years ago Utah al
most handed the Cougars their first defeat
before coughing it up at the end. B YU would
love to close the deal this time around and
earn a bowl trip in the pr<Kess.
There is apparently no truth to rumors
that the Stanford Band has been solicited to
needle BYU fans.
