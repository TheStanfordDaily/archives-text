# Going to Big Game? Still need a ride? It's not too late.

On Saturday morning, stu
dents will be able to take one of
30 56-person charter buses to
Berkeley. Though individual
tickets sales started yesterday -
tickets are $6 each - many dorms
have either bought bulk tickets or
entire buses. Already, 27 buses
have been allocated to dorms.
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate spent $15,000 in acquiring
the buses for the day; the Senate
expects to recoup most, if not all,
of the cost from ticket sales as
well as financial support from the
Athletics Department, the office
of the Vice Provost of Student
Affairs and the office of Fresh
men and Transfer Students. Two
years ago, Stanford Student En
terprises offered a similar pro
gram.
Tickets are on sale for the rest
of the week at the Office of Stu
dent Activities, located in Tresid
der Union, from 5-7 p.m.
