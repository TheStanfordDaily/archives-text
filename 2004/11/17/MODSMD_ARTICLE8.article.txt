### BRENDAN SELBY DESK EDITOR 
President George W. Bush made
public yesterday his choice of Na
tional Security Advisor and former
Stanford Provost Condoleezza Rice
to succeed Colin Powell as secretary
of state.
Rice rose to the nation's most vis
ible diplomatic post just five-and-a
half years after resigning as Stan
ford's provost in 1999, a post she
held for six years. She is currently on
leave from her professorship in the
political science department and her
senior fellowship at the Hoover In
stitution.
In his announcement. Bush
called her "a recognized expert in in
ternational affairs, a distinguished
teacher and academic leader and a
public servant with years of White
House experience."
Faculty who worked alongside
Rice at Stanford said they were not
surprised by her nomination, but
they had varying expectations of
how she will lead the State Depart
ment in the coming years.
Coit Blacker, director of the
Stanford Institute for International
Studies, said that Rice has had to
keep her political identity "some
what private" because of her role as
national security advisor.
"The general view outside is that
she's quite conservative, maybe
even a member of the neo-conserva
tive wins*," he said in an interview

with The Daily. "For the first time,
she's going to be in a high-visibility
position, and people are going to ex
pect that she will have her own
views."
"She won't disappoint," he
added.
Blacker said he does not see
Rice's views as strictly neo-conserv
ative, but rather as a blend between
neo-conservatism and more tradi
tional Republican views.
Simon Jackman, associate pro
fessor of political science, said Rice
might be less independent than
Powell because of her close personal
ties and loyalties to the President.
"Unlike Powell, Rice brings no
political capital independent of her
ties to the president," Jackman
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Via a long and distinguished mili
tary career, Powell had a public pro
file and reputation independent of
Bush that brought him space to
voice and sometimes walk a some
what independent line in intra-ad
ministration politics. That will large
ly disappear with Condi as secretary
of state."
Prior to Rice's nomination, there
had been talk in the media that Rice
hoped to succeed Donald Rumsfeld
as secretary of defense.
" By virtue of her background and
training, she would be a more natur
al choice for defense than state,"
Blacker said.
