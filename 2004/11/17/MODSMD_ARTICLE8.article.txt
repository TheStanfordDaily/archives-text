## 
### BRENDAN SELBY DESK EDITOR 
President George W. Bush made
public yesterday his choice of Na
tional Security Advisor and former
Stanford Provost Condoleezza Rice
to succeed Colin Powell as secretary
of state.
Rice rose to the nation's most vis
ible diplomatic post just five-and-a
half years after resigning as Stan
ford's provost in 1999, a post she
held for six years. She is currently on
leave from her professorship in the
political science department and her
senior fellowship at the Hoover In
stitution.
In his announcement. Bush
called her "a recognized expert in in
ternational affairs, a distinguished
teacher and academic leader and a
public servant with years of White
House experience."
Faculty who worked alongside
Rice at Stanford said they were not
surprised by her nomination, but
they had varying expectations of
how she will lead the State Depart
ment in the coming years.
Coit Blacker, director of the
Stanford Institute for International
Studies, said that Rice has had to
keep her political identity "some
what private" because of her role as
national security advisor.
"The general view outside is that
she's quite conservative, maybe
even a member of the neo-conserva
tive wins*," he said in an interview

with The Daily. "For the first time,
she's going to be in a high-visibility
position, and people are going to ex
pect that she will have her own
views."
"She won't disappoint," he
added.
Blacker said he does not see
Rice's views as strictly neo-conserv
ative, but rather as a blend between
neo-conservatism and more tradi
tional Republican views.
Simon Jackman, associate pro
fessor of political science, said Rice
might be less independent than
Powell because of her close personal
ties and loyalties to the President.
"Unlike Powell, Rice brings no
political capital independent of her
ties to the president," Jackman
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Via a long and distinguished mili
tary career, Powell had a public pro
file and reputation independent of
Bush that brought him space to
voice and sometimes walk a some
what independent line in intra-ad
ministration politics. That will large
ly disappear with Condi as secretary
of state."
Prior to Rice's nomination, there
had been talk in the media that Rice
hoped to succeed Donald Rumsfeld
as secretary of defense.
" By virtue of her background and
training, she would be a more natur
al choice for defense than state,"
Blacker said.

Former Stanford Provost Rice is poised to become the nation's top diplomat.
Jackmun said that "replacing a
loyalist like Rumsfeld would imply
that the military campaigns in Iraq
and Afghanistan weren't going well,
and that's not the party line."
Many media outlets reported that
Rice had wanted to return to acade
mic life, hut according to Assoc.
Prof, of Political Science Michael
McFaul. Rice is too valuable to Bush
for him to let her get away.
"Condi has become the presi
dent's most trusted advisor on for
eign policy," he wrote in an e-mail.
"Consequently, he would have been
a fool to let her go back to Stanford
at this critical moment."
Rice now faces the challenge of
replacing Powell, who has won the
trust of many people within the State
Department. According to Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State Randall
Shriver, who teaches a course this
quarter at the Stanford in Washing
ton program. Rice has "big shoes to
fill."
"Any administration that is

minus Colin Powell is by definition a
lesser administration," he said in an
interview with The Daily. "He's pop
ular not just because of charisma and
charm, but he's popular because he
has invested his political capital for
meaningful improvements in the de
partment."
Powell has increased budgets,
provided more resources for training
development and worked for facili
ties improvements, he added.
Shriver, who handles East Asian
affairs at the State Department, said
that he does not yet know whether
he will continue in the same diplo
matic position under Rice.
"I'm a little further down the food
chain, so whether or not she wants
me on her team will be on her agen
da at some point," he said.
Nonetheless, McFaul said that
"those who work at the State De
partment would do well to think of
this new situation as an opportunity
to play a greater role in the making
of foreign policy."

It could also be an opportunity
for certain Stanford faculty mem
bers. For example, now that she is
moving to a more prominent role.
Rice could enlist the help of some of
her former colleagues.
"She has very, very deep relation
ships here," Blacker said. "She is
going to have to draw in people from
various stages of her life, including
Stanford."
Though he is a Democrat, Black
er is a friend of Rice and worked
closely with her in the field of inter
national politics. Because of this
connection. Blacker said he spent
much of yesterday fielding questions
from several major news outlets, in
cluding The New York Times, News
Hour with Jim Lehrer and BBC
World.
Blacker said that Rice is "very ar
ticulate" and that he believes she will
do well as secretary of state because
of the "significant management ex
perience" she gained at Stanford.
Junior Albert Chang, who is

Faculty: Rice has 'big shoes to
fill,' but is ready for the challenge

studying in Washington. D.C., this
quarter and interning for the State
Department, said he believes people
there will be ready to work with
Rice.
"Now that Powell is gone, I think
she is the best choice to fill the
spot." Chang said. "I saw Powell as
the pragmatist in the administra
tion. and I think that she will be the
next pragmatist in the administra
tion."
University President John Hen
nessy also expressed high hopes for
Rice in her new position. In a written
statement to The Daily, Hennessy
said. "Condoleezza Rice served
Stanford with distinction as a scholar
and provost."
"Her intellect and strategic vision
were of tremendous value to the
University during her tenure here,"
he added. "1 have no doubt that Pro
fessor Rice will be a great asset to
our nation as it faces serious chal
lenges in the international arena."
