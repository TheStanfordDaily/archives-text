## 
### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate last night voted unanimously to
support Cardinal Competitive
Cheer's request for Athletic Depart
ment funding.
Cardinal Competitive Cheer is a
voluntary student organization that
performs at many athletic events, in
cluding football and men's basket
ball games, but does not receive
funding from the Athletic Depart
ment.
The group gets limited funding
from the ASSU general fee and The
Stanford Fund, and members make
up the difference by paying hefty
quarterly dues.
This year Cardinal Competitive
Cheer has fallen $1,200 short of the
money it needs to stay afloat.
The bill, proposed by Senator
Lauren Graham, a sophomore, and
Senator Shani Fregia, a senior, offi
cially throws the support of the Sen

ate behind Cardinal Competitive
Cheer and recommends that the
Athletic Department fund the
group.
The bill states that "the financial
needs of the group exceeds [sic] that
of available aforementioned funding
[ASSU General Fee, The Stanford
Fund] and group members are re
quired to each supplement outstand
ing cost on their own to meet their
budget."
It goes on to recommend that the
Athletic Department provide the
group with "$lO,OOO to cover their
outstanding costs and to relieve their
members of hefty membership
dues."
Cardinal Competitive Cheer rou
tinely travels with athletic teams to
away games, but its expenses are not
paid by the Athletic Department.
Last year, at the request of the
Athletic Department, the group
traveled with the football team to
UCLA because the Stanford Band
was prohibited from attending the

game.
Though it specifically asked the
members of Cardinal Competitive
Cheer to come to the game to pro
vide support for the team, the Ath
letic Department did not fund the
group's expenses for the trip, forcing
its members provide their own trans
portation and pay for their own lodg
ing.
Senate Advocacy Chair Omar
Shakir, a sophomore, supported the
bill, arguing that support from the
Athletic Department is overdue.
"Cardinal Competitive Cheer
provides a vital service to the Athlet
ic Department and the student body
in terms of boosting school spirit at
athletic events," Shakir said. "We
hope that meeting with the Athletic
Department with this bill in hand
will encourage them to consider op
position."
Eleven senators voted in favor of
the bill, with none in opposition and
Senate Chair Chris Lin. a senior, ab
staining.
