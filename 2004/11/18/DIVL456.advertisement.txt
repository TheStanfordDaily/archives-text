ON INTELLIGENCE
by Jeff Hawkins
Inventor of the Palm Pilot
Thursday, November 18, 2004 • 7PM
Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
Jeff Hawkins, the man who
created the Palm Pilot, Treo smart
phone, and other handheld
devices, has reshaped our
relationship to computers. Now
he stands ready to revolutionize
both neuroscience and
computing in one stroke, with
a new understanding of
intelligence itself. Hawkins
develops a powerful theory of
how the human brain works,
explaining why computers are
not intelligent and how, based on
this new theory, we can finally
build intelligent machines. In an
engaging style that will captivate
audiences from the merely
curious to the professional
scientist, Hawkins shows how
a clear understanding of how
the brain works will make it
possible for us to build
intelligent machines, in silicon,
that will exceed our human
ability in surprising ways.
Written with acclaimed science
writer Sandra Blakeslee,
On Intelligence promises to
completely transfigure the
possibilities of the technology
age. It is a landmark book in its
scope and clarity.
