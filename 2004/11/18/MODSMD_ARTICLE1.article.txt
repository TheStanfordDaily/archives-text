### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The death of Palestinian Authority
leader Yasser Arafat last week has
drawn a wide range of emotional re
sponses from people across the globe,
including Stanford students with per
sonal ties to the Arab / Israeli conflict.
The Daily spoke with two such stu
dents — Marwan Hanania, a doctoral
student in history from Jordan, and Adi
Greif, an Israeli-born junior and presi
dent of the Middle East Issues Dialogue
Group — to get their reactions to
Arafat's death.
Hanania and Greif are not spokes
people for either Palestinian or Israeli
causes, but they offer two perspectives
on a subject that concerns many stu

Hanania, whose father was close

friends with Arafat, visited the Palestin
ian leader at his Ramallah compound
about three years ago and fondly re
membered him as "very gracious, a kind
man and personally very charming."
"He actually offered me an apple,"
Hanania said with a laugh. "He was al
ways interested in the youth."
Greif said she saw Arafat "as a more
isolated figure" toward the end of his
life and didn't realize how relevant he
still was to the Palestinian cause until
after she witnessed the outpouring of
emotion for him after his death.
"No matter how it was before. Pales
tinian nationalism is definitely a real
movement," she said. "It doesn't need
Arafat just to keep going."
Hanania said he wants people to re

Palestinian cause.
"Ultimately, his legacy, in my opin
