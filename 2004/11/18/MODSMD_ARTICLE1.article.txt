# Perspectives on Arafat's death
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The death of Palestinian Authority
leader Yasser Arafat last week has
drawn a wide range of emotional re
sponses from people across the globe,
including Stanford students with per
sonal ties to the Arab / Israeli conflict.
The Daily spoke with two such stu
dents — Marwan Hanania, a doctoral
student in history from Jordan, and Adi
Greif, an Israeli-born junior and presi
dent of the Middle East Issues Dialogue
Group — to get their reactions to
Arafat's death.
Hanania and Greif are not spokes
people for either Palestinian or Israeli
causes, but they offer two perspectives
on a subject that concerns many stu
dents at Stanford. They discussed rele
vant issues over the course of the inter
views, including Arafat's legacy. Secre
tary of State Colin L. Powell's recent

resignation and the future of the peace
process.
Hanania met Arafat twice within the
last six years and said he was "very
upset" when he heard of Arafat's death.
"I was very saddened by it. It was
something we had been expecting fora
while because he'd been ill for years, but
when it actually did happen it was a little
surreal," he said.
"He was a big symbol for the Pales
tinian movement," he said, pausing fora
moment before adding, "so it was quite
sad."
Greif said she was struck by the news
of Arafat's passing, but like Hanania,
she wasn't completely surprised.
"In honesty, my first reaction was
just that he was an old man, and he had
been sick," she said.
The two students offered different
opinions about Arafat as a person and a
leader.
Hanania, whose father was close

friends with Arafat, visited the Palestin
ian leader at his Ramallah compound
about three years ago and fondly re
membered him as "very gracious, a kind
man and personally very charming."
"He actually offered me an apple,"
Hanania said with a laugh. "He was al
ways interested in the youth."
Greif said she saw Arafat "as a more
isolated figure" toward the end of his
life and didn't realize how relevant he
still was to the Palestinian cause until
after she witnessed the outpouring of
emotion for him after his death.
"No matter how it was before. Pales
tinian nationalism is definitely a real
movement," she said. "It doesn't need
Arafat just to keep going."
Hanania said he wants people to re
member Arafat's role in shaping the
Palestinian cause.
"Ultimately, his legacy, in my opin
ion. is that he was able to put the
Palestinians' aspirations in front of
the world. The Palestinian state has
been imbued in the international
conscience, even within the U.S. If
you look back 15 or 2(3 years, that
was anathema."
Both Cireif and Hanania ex
pressed regret over Powell's recent
lesignation. Powell will be replaced
by National Security Advisor and
former Stanford Provost Condoleez
za Rice, pending confirmation by the
Senate.
"I think that, at least at one point,
Powell was really respected by a lot
of Israelis," Cireif said. "I saw him as
an honest military man you could
trust, even though he wasn't always
pro-Israel on every issue. It seemed
that when he made a promise, he was
willing to keep it."

"It's not a good sign," said Hana
nia of the resignation. "Powell was
seen as one of the more moderate
and sympathetic leaders in the Bush
administration. He was more en
gaged than some others who pre
ferred to abandon the conflict and
turn their attention to Iraq and the
war on terror."
Hanania said he hoped Rice
would bring more attention to the
conflict. "My hope is that she will
enact a much more vigorous effort to
get the U.S. involved in the peace
process, and that it will be more fair
to both sides."
But the region's bloody history
has tempered both students' hopes
fora renewed peace effort in the
wake of Arafat's death.
"At this point the conflict has
been going on for so long that I'm

very hesitant to jump to any conclu
sions," Cireif said. "It's hard for me
to be particularly optimistic — it's
hard to be optimistic and then always
be disappointed."
Hanania said the prospects for
peace would depend on the nature of
the future leadership. "If the person
who's elected is able to bring in
Hamas and Islamic Jihad and Pales
tinian groups within the leadership,
then there might be some hope,
some reason for optimism," he said.
"But either way, it's going to take
a while. After four years of blood
shed on both sides, attitudes have
hardened."
Speaking candidly about the
Arab / Israeli conflict carries risks.
Grief said, because many students
are personally invested in the issue.
"It's scary for me because I'm not an
expert," she said. "Even referring to

Powell's departure lamented

which 'side' I'm on feels wrong be
cause I don't believe there is just one
side or just two sides. It's a complex
issue that's more than a matter of
sides."
She said she got involved in the
Middle East Issues Dialogue Group,
an on-campus organization, to en
courage discussion of these contro
versial issues in a neutral setting.
Hanania also emphasized the
value of seeking different points of
view.
"The first thing to do is to look be
yond the flashy headlines in the
media. Students should look for al
ternative sources of information."
Coincidentally. both students rec
ommended "Palestine and the Arab-
Israeli Conflict: A History with Doc

Palestinians' aspirations in front of
the world. The Palestinian state has
been imbued in the international
conscience, even within the U.S. If
you look back 15 or 2(3 years, that
was anathema."
Both Cireif and Hanania ex
pressed regret over Powell's recent
lesignation. Powell will be replaced
by National Security Advisor and
former Stanford Provost Condoleez
za Rice, pending confirmation by the
Senate.
"I think that, at least at one point,
Powell was really respected by a lot
of Israelis," Cireif said. "I saw him as
an honest military man you could
trust, even though he wasn't always
pro-Israel on every issue. It seemed
that when he made a promise, he was
willing to keep it."

"It's not a good sign," said Hana
nia of the resignation. "Powell was
seen as one of the more moderate
and sympathetic leaders in the Bush
administration. He was more en
gaged than some others who pre
ferred to abandon the conflict and
turn their attention to Iraq and the
war on terror."
Hanania said he hoped Rice
would bring more attention to the
conflict. "My hope is that she will
enact a much more vigorous effort to
get the U.S. involved in the peace
process, and that it will be more fair
to both sides."
But the region's bloody history
has tempered both students' hopes
fora renewed peace effort in the
wake of Arafat's death.
"At this point the conflict has
been going on for so long that I'm

very hesitant to jump to any conclu
sions," Cireif said. "It's hard for me
to be particularly optimistic — it's
hard to be optimistic and then always
be disappointed."
Hanania said the prospects for
peace would depend on the nature of
the future leadership. "If the person
who's elected is able to bring in
Hamas and Islamic Jihad and Pales
tinian groups within the leadership,
then there might be some hope,
some reason for optimism," he said.
"But either way, it's going to take
a while. After four years of blood
shed on both sides, attitudes have
hardened."
Speaking candidly about the
Arab / Israeli conflict carries risks.
Grief said, because many students
are personally invested in the issue.
"It's scary for me because I'm not an
expert," she said. "Even referring to

Powell's departure lamented

which 'side' I'm on feels wrong be
cause I don't believe there is just one
side or just two sides. It's a complex
issue that's more than a matter of
sides."
She said she got involved in the
Middle East Issues Dialogue Group,
an on-campus organization, to en
courage discussion of these contro
versial issues in a neutral setting.
Hanania also emphasized the
value of seeking different points of
view.
"The first thing to do is to look be
yond the flashy headlines in the
media. Students should look for al
ternative sources of information."
Coincidentally. both students rec
ommended "Palestine and the Arab-
Israeli Conflict: A History with Doc
uments" by Charles D. Smith as a
good primer for those interested in
learning more about the issue.
The death of Palestinian Authority
leader Yasser Arafat last week has
drawn a wide range of emotional re
sponses from people across the globe,
including Stanford students with per
sonal ties to the Arab / Israeli conflict.
The Daily spoke with two such stu
dents — Marwan Hanania, a doctoral
student in history from Jordan, and Adi
Greif, an Israeli-born junior and presi
dent of the Middle East Issues Dialogue
Group — to get their reactions to
Arafat's death.
Hanania and Greif are not spokes
people for either Palestinian or Israeli
causes, but they offer two perspectives
on a subject that concerns many stu
dents at Stanford. They discussed rele
vant issues over the course of the inter
views, including Arafat's legacy. Secre
tary of State Colin L. Powell's recent

resignation and the future of the peace
process.
Hanania met Arafat twice within the
last six years and said he was "very
upset" when he heard of Arafat's death.
"I was very saddened by it. It was
something we had been expecting fora
while because he'd been ill for years, but
when it actually did happen it was a little
surreal," he said.
"He was a big symbol for the Pales
tinian movement," he said, pausing fora
moment before adding, "so it was quite
sad."
Greif said she was struck by the news
of Arafat's passing, but like Hanania,
she wasn't completely surprised.
"In honesty, my first reaction was
just that he was an old man, and he had
been sick," she said.
The two students offered different
opinions about Arafat as a person and a
leader.
Hanania, whose father was close

friends with Arafat, visited the Palestin
ian leader at his Ramallah compound
about three years ago and fondly re
membered him as "very gracious, a kind
man and personally very charming."
"He actually offered me an apple,"
Hanania said with a laugh. "He was al
ways interested in the youth."
Greif said she saw Arafat "as a more
isolated figure" toward the end of his
life and didn't realize how relevant he
still was to the Palestinian cause until
after she witnessed the outpouring of
emotion for him after his death.
"No matter how it was before. Pales
tinian nationalism is definitely a real
movement," she said. "It doesn't need
Arafat just to keep going."
Hanania said he wants people to re
member Arafat's role in shaping the
Palestinian cause.
"Ultimately, his legacy, in my opin
ion. is that he was able to put the
Palestinians' aspirations in front of
the world. The Palestinian state has
been imbued in the international
conscience, even within the U.S. If
you look back 15 or 2(3 years, that
