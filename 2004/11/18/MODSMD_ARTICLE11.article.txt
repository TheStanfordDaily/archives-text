# Vitamin ABCs:
## What does your body need? 
### CHUAN-MEI LEE 
Walking down the vitamin aisle at Safeway can
be a baffling experience. Should you take a multi
vitamin? Separate supplements? There are
dozens of different vitamins and dietary supple
ments being sold. Given all of these choices, it's
often hard for even the smartest Stanford student
to know what to take.
Although many Stanford students do take vi
tamins, most don't take vitamins daily. Those
who do regularly take vitamins generally use a
multi-vitamin. While taking a multi-vitamin sup
plement daily is generally not harmful, it may not
be too helpful either, according to some experts.
Senior Alec Clowes takes a multi-vitamin and
Vitamin C occasionally.

"I take [vitamins] when it
occurs to me," Clowes said.
"Either they're going to
help, or your body will flush
them out. For that reason,
shall we say, 1 take them
recreationally. As a recre
ational drug."
Missy Halliday, a junior
and an athlete on the Stan
ford Women's Field Hockey
team, stated that she takes a
Vitamin B complex during
field-hockey season because
it gives her more energy.

"A teammate told me that B-complex con
verts food into energy," she said. "I feel like I had
more energy during practice or games."
However, there are a number of students, such
as junior Rusty Camden, who do take vitamins
everyday.
Camden said he takes vitamins "because 1
don't eat enough. When 1 wake up, and I haven't
eaten, I take a vitamin."
According to a Vivian Crisman, a nutritionist
at the Vaden Student Health Center, taking vita
mins does not compensate fora poor diet. She
suggested that this "band-aid approach" is not a
good health practice. Crisman stated that fruits
and vegetables, for example, contain naturally oc
curring phytochemicals that can never be found
in pill form.
"Nutrients are most absorbable and available
to the body if eaten as a food, as they are found
naturally in food," she said.
She advised that students eat a well-balanced
and varied diet. Crisman usually only recom
mends multi-vitamins to students when she coun
sels those who are on a restrictive diet or who are
recovering from disordered eating.
But Crisman also observed that a sizable por
tion of Stanford students — about a quarter to a
third — do take vitamins, mirroring the propor
tion of those that take vitamins in the U.S. popu
lation. She found that most of the time it is the
parents of students who buy vitamins, not the stu
dents themselves.
"If you really want to [take a dietary supple
ment], take a multi-vitamin with 50 to 100 percent
of the recommended daily value," Crisman said.
She suggested that students buy the generic,
grocery store brand, rather than a brand name

version.
"Don't break the piggy bank," she said.
Crisman stated that taking a multi-vitamin
daily is not generally harmful. But she noted that
if a student is "boutique-ing" — that is, taking
several different vitamin pills without profession
al advice — she see reason for concern.
And sometimes, the problem isn't undernutri
tion but overnutrition. Taking too many vitamins
is just as dangerous as taking too few, explained
Nancy Bough, a clinical dietician at Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital.
"When people start taking large doses of vita
mins and minerals, there's always a risk of that
being a problem," Bough said. "1 would warn
people against taking mega-doses of vitamins and
minerals."

Too much of fat-solu
ble vitamins-such as Vita
mins A, D, E and K and
some minerals can be
toxic.
Chi Theta Chi, a coop
erative house on campus,
provides its residents with
a selection of vitamins. Ju
nior Nick Hollon, a kitchen
manager at Chi Theta Chi,
is responsible for keeping
the house's vitamin shelf
stocked.

"I feel like it's good to
have vitamins for the house," Hollon said. "Peo
ple think it's healthy. I usually just get the daily
multi-vitamin and the chewable vitamin C. Some
times people ask for specific things like echi
nacea."

While echinacea is not a vitamin, this sort of
herbal supplement comes to mind when students
think about vitamins. According to Hollon, many
students lump the two together because both vi
tamins and herbal supplements are often found in
the same aisle at the grocery store.
"Everyone considers them all the same thing,"
Hollon said. "I figure people think that they're all
health pills."
While vitamins have documented benefits, the
effects of herbal supplements are generally not
well-researched. Echinacea, a plant-derived sup
plement, is often taken by people looking to
shorten or avoid a cold.
Claudia Deffenbaugh, a day-hospital pharma
cist at Lucile Packard Hospital, explained that
conclusive tests for the effects of echinacea have
not yet been published.
"I don't think (echinacea has] been proven to
be effective," she said, citing a report from the
Review of Natural Products, a well-known publi
cation on natural substances.
According to the Review, there is some evidence
showing that echinacea is effective in shortening the
duration of upper respiratory infections — includ
ing the common cold — but it is not effective as a
preventative measure. In clinical trials on rodents,
echinacea has shown no acute toxic effects.
English coterminal student Gabe Rosen said
that he used to take echinacea for colds but later
decided that it was not helpful. He added. "I'm
suspicious of anything processed."
