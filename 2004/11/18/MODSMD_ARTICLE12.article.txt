# Advocacy group for child survival holds conference at Stanford
## 
### TINA HAN 
When Laura Shipler-Chico and her husband Matt Chico
stopped in Madison, Kentucky, to chat with a woman about
their country-wide trek to raise money for measles vaccina
tions, the woman became so inspired she helped them raise
$13,000 in little time. By the time the two had finished their
four-and-a-half month journey, the two had raised $40,000 for
the cause.
Shipler-Chico and Chico came to speak at Stanford as part
of a conference held by the Stanford chapter of Student Cam
paign for Child Survival advocacy group. A nationwide net
work, the Student Campaign for Child Survival has been dedi
cated to reducing the number of cases of easily preventable
childhood diseases by increasing awareness and supporting im
proved policies regarding children's health and human rights.
The Stanford chapter of the SCCS held the group's first re
gional conference this past weekend. Representatives from
schools all across California attended the conference to learn
more about the roles that students can take on to effect change.
The two-day conference featured workshops examining
the sources of fatal childhood diseases, discussions outlining
procedural steps to take when starting a school chapter, and
presentations from keynote speakers Dr. Kelly Murphy,
Shipler-Chico and Chico, who described projects they have
undertaken to help the cause.
On Friday night at Wallenberg Hall, Murphy, an associate
professor of surgery at the Stanford School of Medicine,
spoke to a group of students about his experiences in Papua
New Guinea. Murphy is a founding member of the Papua
New Guinea Medical Project, which started in 1996. Murphy
took a group of Stanford students to the area and set up mo
bile clinics in the Sepik River Region to provide health ser
vices to the local community.
Shipler-Chico and Chico presented on Saturday afternoon
in the Tresidder Oak West room. The couple described their
3,973 mile cross-country trek to mark the 10th anniversary of
the Rwandan genocide and to raise money for the American
Red Cross Measles Initiative. The main goal of the initiative
is to provide vaccinations to prevent this highly contagious
disease. Shipler-Chico and Chico are continuing their

fundraising efforts for the Measles Ini
tiative and the Rwanda Friends Peace
House.
The duo started their journey on
June 3 of this year in front of their house
in Silver Springs. Maryland. Riding her
new touring hike. Shipler-Chico hiked
the journey, while Chico ran alongside,
pushing a baby jogger full of supplies.
The couple traveled through Washing
ton. D.C., Virginia. Kentucky, Illinois,.
Missouri. Kansas, Colorado, Utah.'
Nevada and California, finally ending at
the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francis
co. Averaging about 35 miles a day.the
two were met with "cascading generosi
ty" everywhere they went as they pro
moted their cause.
Chico said he saw the American
Red Cross's Measles Initiative as a wor
thy cause for their journey because, al
though most Americans no longer think
of measles as being fatal today, the dis
ease still wreaks havoc in regions such as
Africa. The American Red Cross states
that this disease kills more children
worldwide than malnutrition, tuberculo
sis and HIV/AIDS — killing about
one-million children each year.
A poignant meeting with a Ugan
dan woman in Washington. D.C., solidi
fied the decision for Shipler-Chico to con-

tinue along the journey. The Ugandan_
woman, who had first-hand knowledge of the devastation that
the disease has caused in her country, described it to Shipler-'
Chico as the "thorough disease." According to Shipler-Chico,
most Americans know of the measles as merely uncomfortable
skin rashes — in reality, it can be much worse.
"Measles devastates the body from the inside out, and the
rash is only one of the symptoms." Shipler-Chico said. "It can
affect so many different bodily functions."
According to the American Red Cross, it costs less than a
dollar to vaccinate one child. And even though the cost is rel
atively small, there are over 200-million children in Africa who
are at risk for catching the disease. Measles has already hit
Africa hard, causing the deaths of more than 450,000 children.
Shipler-Chico and Chico expressed their gratitude to
groups like SCCS for doing its part to educate students as well
as the general public.
"Advocacy and awareness raised is even more important
in the bigger picture," Chico said, as he urged SCCS to remain
strong in its effort to bring about change. "The job isn't done
in raising awareness because the need still exists"
When asked how youth can affect the cause, Shipler-Chico
answered by saying, "Sometimes because people underesti
mate youth, youth then start to underestimate themselves.
Look at the history of the world, almost every country — this
country included — the most important changes in societies
and in dynamics happen on college campuses. It's when peo
ple like you get together to think outside just their next class,
their next paper, their next exam. You all are here building
that momentum toward something concrete."
Students said they were stirred by the experiences of the
presenters.
"I admire their passion, and 1 am now inspired to do some
thing to make the world a better place," said Anushka Fernan
do, a student representative from Mount St. Mary's College.
Senior Alex Mainiero, a co-president of the Stanford Chap
ter of SCCS, described the speech as inspirational and said she
feels that SCCS can definitely make a concrete change.
"It's hard for us sometimes to think that we can really make
a change," Mainiero said, "but we've raised money for the
Measles Initiative last year and were able to help vaccinate
2.000 children."
