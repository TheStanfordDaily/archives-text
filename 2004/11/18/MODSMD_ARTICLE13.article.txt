## Feeling passive-aggressive? Blame your culture, not your genes 
### LAUREN GONG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
Alright, we've all done it —
made a snide remark to an irritat
ing roommate, vented behind an
other friend's back, done a sub-par
job at work because you don't like
your boss. Passive-aggressive be
havior is something nearly every
one has taken part of at some point.
Did you know it used to be con
sidered a psychiatric disorder? It
was recently taken off of the Amer
ican Psychiatry Association's list of
behavioral disorders. It is too nar
row to warrant a full-blown diag
nosis, as well as too common and
variable for psychiatrists to weed
out of other mental ailments.
To clarify, passive-aggressive
disorder is actually distinguished
from the run-of-the-mill passive
aggressive outbursts we experience
every day. It is described as in
grained and habitual behavior.
The interesting thing about
passive-aggressive behavior is that
whether it is considered a psychi
atric disorder or it is just an infre
quent occurrence, the symptoms

find their roots in childhood.
It has been described by ex
perts as a coping mechanism. It
can stem from trying to reduce
conflict at home, avoiding making
mistakes or preserving self-re
spect. Many people stereotype
women as being passive, which
may be more of a cultural artifact
than a proven fact. After all, you
always hear about girls being catty
or talking behind another friend's
back.
This behavior contrasts with
the stereotypical male behavior of
outward aggressive outburts. Yet
is passive-aggressive behavior ac
tually a genetically based trait, or
is it something that has been cul
turally ingrained?
I would argue it is to some ex
tent cultural. Psychologists ana
lyze passive-aggressive behavior
as "an effort to preserve some in
dependence amid extreme pres
sure to conform."
I'm not trying to say that boys
do not experience pressure to fit in
as girls do, but perhaps the social
role of women throughout history
has been so structured that this be

havior may be a result of how
women cope with feeling con
strained. Constraint can come in
all shapes and forms, from the
unattainable body image present
ed by the media that forces women
to restrict dietary habits to the pro
motion of "typically female" pro
fessions to young girls, women are
told over and over they should act
/ think / look a certain way.
When I was little, I did those
annoying little kid things such as
yelling out comments because I
felt like it, without any worry that
they were out-of-the-blue or flat
out wrong. I was just a kid with a
lot of confidence — gender
stereotypes didn't apply just yet.
As I got older, however, these acts
were no longer "socially appropri
ate." I now feel myself censoring
my words out of fear that 1 will be
judged harshly by my society,
fearful of the condescension often
applied to women.
Prior to thinking about how
self-conscious and self-censoring
we have all become — especially
females in our society — I never
realized how many people pref

ace their comments in classes with
an "I feel that" or "1 kind of think
that." People are afraid to express
an opinion without a caveat
downplaying the strength of one's
statement.
How does this all relate to pas
sive-aggressive behavior? The
actions associated with passive
aggressive behavior are a conse
quence of a woman's desire to
not ruffle too many feathers. It is
a result of the social pressure
women face to be demure and
avoid conflict. Feelings of anger
and frustration are kept inside
and then manifested in passive
aggressive ways.
My point is that everyone is
guilty of passive-aggressive be
havior. But the key to getting
around it is to recognize its root:
Rather than blaming genes, claim
ing that that's just the way women
are, realize that history has shaped
who we all are — for better or for
worse.

applied to women.
Prior to thinking about how
self-conscious and self-censoring
we have all become — especially
females in our society — I never
realized how many people pref

ace their comments in classes with
an "I feel that" or "1 kind of think
that." People are afraid to express
an opinion without a caveat
downplaying the strength of one's
statement.
How does this all relate to pas
sive-aggressive behavior? The
actions associated with passive
aggressive behavior are a conse
quence of a woman's desire to
not ruffle too many feathers. It is
a result of the social pressure
women face to be demure and
avoid conflict. Feelings of anger
and frustration are kept inside
and then manifested in passive
aggressive ways.
My point is that everyone is
guilty of passive-aggressive be
havior. But the key to getting
around it is to recognize its root:
Rather than blaming genes, claim
ing that that's just the way women
are, realize that history has shaped
who we all are — for better or for
worse.
