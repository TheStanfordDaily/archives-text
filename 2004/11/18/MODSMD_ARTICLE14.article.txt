## The 						Good Life Don't burn my house down just yet; no offense to Europeans intended 
### JULIE PARK 
I received my first hate mail ever
this week. Here is my reply:
Florence is the grand city where
you can see Botticelli's Mowing and
ethereal masterpiece, "The Birth of
Venus," in the Uffizi instead of
looking at a print glued onto a cruise
ship banquet wall.
It is a city where musicians per
form daily in historic piazzas. The
white grapes from the fruit stands
taste like the Tuscan sun gently
ripened them to golden, nuanced
sweetness. They are so much better
than American grapes.
These are just a few of the many
reasons why I love Florence. Now
that you've read my abridged ver
sion of Fodor's Italy or Kick Steve's
Florence, I will stop boring you with
the cliched "Why I Love Europe"
spiel.
Everything I said above about
Italy is nice and known and true. But
everything 1 said about Italy in my
column last Friday is true, too.
On Nov. 15, in response to my
Friday column "The Surreal World:
Life in Europe," an angry mob tried
to impale me on a sharpened pencil
by writing hateful retorts via e-mail
and campus newsprint — all be
cause I sarcastically criticized a soci
ety that isn't Arrogant America.
They sneered and jeered with vit
riol. "Open your eyes and write with
substance," wrote one. Worse, those
angry people either lied about or to
tally misunderstood my column.
One well-publicized leader of the
wolf pack falsely alleged that I dis
missed Italians as racists. That per
son even claimed that I wanted to
read a book by Dan Brown.
Note to the politically-correct
police on campus: Please get your
facts straight before you try to bring
me down. I laud your skillful efforts
to try to manipulate my words, but
please, don't lie. I would never want
to read "The Da Vinci Code," thank
you very much.
Am I really "well, a bit wrong"?
A current Stanford-in-Florence stu
dent read my Europe column and
told me that she thinks what 1 said is
true and funny. A current Stanford
in-Paris student said the same thing.
Thanks, fellow Stanford-in-Europe

students who know what I m talking
about.
Thanks, readers, who under
stood my column wasn't a hateful di
atribe against Europe, unlike the
mob of people who implied that 1
am so close-minded that I won't or
can't speak a language other than
English while overseas. For the
record, I love speaking my fumbling
Italian to real Italian people.
And they love giving me a combi
nation of friendly replies and blank
stares.
So eat it, scary people who bit my
head off with relish.
Still, I admit that the scathing,
siz/ling rebukes 1 received from the
intellectual high horses blew me
away with their swift, cutting lin
guistic prowess. Stanford students
are quite talented and articulate. I
guess that explains why the Admis
sions Office sometimes lets in peo
ple who don't have a sense of
humor.
So I made fun of another society.
Big whoop. Those who police sar
castic comments about human ways
of living need to lighten up. If I
made fun of big bad America or
Korea in the same way, no one
would blink twice because I'm a Ko
rean American. Some people just
hate it when outsiders talk about
mildly embarrassing realities of in
side worlds.
The tone of some of the rebukes
I received was catty and vicious to
the point where I wondered if the
writers were actually talking about
my silly little facetious column.
But the most remarkable thing
about Monday's onslaught was that
no one sent me any physical threats.
While emotionally trampled, the
only physical strain I suffered from
was a sore throat because I forgot to
wear my cute Italian "scarf" on a
cold and windy day.
I've never been so harshly chas
tised for speaking my mind since I
was in a Bible Belt high school and
made off-hand remarks about how
football is just a game. Getting the
evil eye from the football team and
coaches (a.k.a. my teachers) didn't
really bother me.
But I used to joke with my high
school friends about how my house
would get burned down if I didn't

keep my mouth shut. While we
laughed, I was met with nodding
agreement.
Nowadays, my mother wishes I
would say only nice things in my col
umn, but hack then Mom told me
flat out to keep my mouth shut —
out of fear for what would happen if
I didn't.
1 learned that you risk a lot trying
to get away with undermining the
pigskin-passing pillar of civil society
in a community where high school
football, personal pride and religion
are not all that different.
Back then I kept my mouth
halfway shut because I didn't want
to be ostracized and attacked with
more than words.
All I was talking about then was
football, but it held such deep mean
ing for others that my opinions in
flamed those people. And all I was
talking about last week was the way
people live. We're all people, after
all, and we all have some question
able ways of doing things.
I understand why some people
were offended by my column. But I
hope they understand that I don't
truly view Europeans with disdain. I
was in no way writing "Here Is Why
I Hate Europe."
Every society has its positive and
negative aspects, and since the
world has already praised Europe
endlessly, why not poke some fun at
the less positive?
Although the responses I re
ceived from some fellow Stanford
students were a bit fictitious and
way harsh, and even though I could
feel their flared nostrils and glares
Fed Ex-ed to me all the way from
California, 1 must say that their use
of intellectual weapons was a far
more responsible way to voice dis
agreement than arson.
Words cut my heart and scratch
my eyes out. But my friends— fire
kills. With all the sparks in the air on
Monday, I'm just glad no one tried
to burn my house down.

Monday, I'm just glad no one tried
to burn my house down.

you can refrain from treating her the

please e-mail her at ajapark@stan

I received my first hate mail ever
this week. Here is my reply:
Florence is the grand city where
you can see Botticelli's Mowing and
ethereal masterpiece, "The Birth of
Venus," in the Uffizi instead of
looking at a print glued onto a cruise
ship banquet wall.
It is a city where musicians per
form daily in historic piazzas. The
white grapes from the fruit stands
taste like the Tuscan sun gently
ripened them to golden, nuanced
sweetness. They are so much better
than American grapes.
These are just a few of the many
reasons why I love Florence. Now
that you've read my abridged ver
sion of Fodor's Italy or Kick Steve's
Florence, I will stop boring you with
the cliched "Why I Love Europe"
spiel.
Everything I said above about
Italy is nice and known and true. But
everything 1 said about Italy in my
column last Friday is true, too.
On Nov. 15, in response to my
Friday column "The Surreal World:
Life in Europe," an angry mob tried
to impale me on a sharpened pencil
by writing hateful retorts via e-mail
and campus newsprint — all be
cause I sarcastically criticized a soci
ety that isn't Arrogant America.
They sneered and jeered with vit
riol. "Open your eyes and write with
substance," wrote one. Worse, those
angry people either lied about or to
tally misunderstood my column.
One well-publicized leader of the
wolf pack falsely alleged that I dis
missed Italians as racists. That per
son even claimed that I wanted to
read a book by Dan Brown.
Note to the politically-correct
police on campus: Please get your
facts straight before you try to bring
me down. I laud your skillful efforts
to try to manipulate my words, but
please, don't lie. I would never want
to read "The Da Vinci Code," thank
you very much.
Am I really "well, a bit wrong"?
A current Stanford-in-Florence stu
dent read my Europe column and
told me that she thinks what 1 said is
true and funny. A current Stanford
in-Paris student said the same thing.
Thanks, fellow Stanford-in-Europe

students who know what I m talking
about.
Thanks, readers, who under
stood my column wasn't a hateful di
atribe against Europe, unlike the
mob of people who implied that 1
am so close-minded that I won't or
can't speak a language other than
English while overseas. For the
record, I love speaking my fumbling
Italian to real Italian people.
And they love giving me a combi
nation of friendly replies and blank
stares.
So eat it, scary people who bit my
head off with relish.
Still, I admit that the scathing,
siz/ling rebukes 1 received from the
intellectual high horses blew me
away with their swift, cutting lin
guistic prowess. Stanford students
are quite talented and articulate. I
guess that explains why the Admis
sions Office sometimes lets in peo
ple who don't have a sense of
humor.
So I made fun of another society.
Big whoop. Those who police sar
castic comments about human ways
of living need to lighten up. If I
made fun of big bad America or
Korea in the same way, no one
would blink twice because I'm a Ko
rean American. Some people just
hate it when outsiders talk about
mildly embarrassing realities of in
side worlds.
The tone of some of the rebukes
I received was catty and vicious to
the point where I wondered if the
writers were actually talking about
my silly little facetious column.
But the most remarkable thing
about Monday's onslaught was that
no one sent me any physical threats.
While emotionally trampled, the
only physical strain I suffered from
was a sore throat because I forgot to
wear my cute Italian "scarf" on a
cold and windy day.
I've never been so harshly chas
tised for speaking my mind since I
was in a Bible Belt high school and
made off-hand remarks about how
football is just a game. Getting the
evil eye from the football team and
coaches (a.k.a. my teachers) didn't
really bother me.
But I used to joke with my high
school friends about how my house
would get burned down if I didn't

keep my mouth shut. While we
laughed, I was met with nodding
agreement.
Nowadays, my mother wishes I
would say only nice things in my col
umn, but hack then Mom told me
flat out to keep my mouth shut —
out of fear for what would happen if
I didn't.
1 learned that you risk a lot trying
to get away with undermining the
pigskin-passing pillar of civil society
in a community where high school
football, personal pride and religion
are not all that different.
Back then I kept my mouth
halfway shut because I didn't want
to be ostracized and attacked with
more than words.
All I was talking about then was
football, but it held such deep mean
ing for others that my opinions in
flamed those people. And all I was
talking about last week was the way
people live. We're all people, after
all, and we all have some question
able ways of doing things.
I understand why some people
were offended by my column. But I
hope they understand that I don't
truly view Europeans with disdain. I
was in no way writing "Here Is Why
I Hate Europe."
Every society has its positive and
negative aspects, and since the
world has already praised Europe
endlessly, why not poke some fun at
the less positive?
Although the responses I re
ceived from some fellow Stanford
students were a bit fictitious and
way harsh, and even though I could
feel their flared nostrils and glares
Fed Ex-ed to me all the way from
California, 1 must say that their use
of intellectual weapons was a far
more responsible way to voice dis
agreement than arson.
Words cut my heart and scratch
my eyes out. But my friends— fire
kills. With all the sparks in the air on
Monday, I'm just glad no one tried
to burn my house down.
