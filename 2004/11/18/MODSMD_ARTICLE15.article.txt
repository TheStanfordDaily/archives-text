## Bin Laden tape raises questions about America's Middle East policy 
### ROHAM GHAREGOZLOU 
A few days ago, Osama bin
Laden released yet another one of
his infamous tapes to the public,
making Americans uneasy by stand
ing behind a podium in a clean tunic
and robe, perfectly groomed and
standing straight and tall.
He did not give the impression of
being a man on the run but rather
that of a stately professor in his
classroom, lecturing to his students.
And indeed. I am sure, he made sure
that this was the impression he
would give: It should not be forgot
ten that bin Laden seeks above all
leadership of the Arab world, and he
needs to be presentable to appeal to
the Arab public as a winner.
But bin Laden's marketing tac
tics aren't my concern here, I want
to talk about a very interesting mes
sage present in his tape: the offer of
peace to America.
Bin Laden quite clearly states,
"your security depends not on
Bush, Kerry or Al-Oaida ... any
nation who docs not attack us will
not be attacked." The significance
is two-fold: He for the first time
presents peace as an option to
America, and second, he plays
down the importance of his own or
ganization, saying in effect that
even if he were taken out. the

"light" would continue.
Not to support "negotiating with
terrorists," but I think that bin
Laden's words should give policy
makers pause: What if American
policy were non-interventionist and
not domineering? What if America
did allow true democracy in its allied
states, primarily in Saudi Arabia?
What if an American-engineered
peace came to Palestine? What if
American armies got out of contest
ed territories?
I would argue that this would in
deed lead to peace, not only with bin
Laden, but with a key region in the
world — a region whose people are
constantly being alienated by cur
rent American policy.
In the years since President
George W. Bush took office, bin
Laden's claims have become more
true than ever: It is now very easy to
convince a Muslim youth that
America is indeed at war with his
people.
U.S. troops occupy two Muslim
countries — one of them with mas
sive oil reserves and heavy historical
importance.
Reports of casualties because of
American troops unceasingly blare
out of the Muslim press.
An increasingly oppressive and
disliked regime is held in place by
U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.

Reports of Muslims being unjust
ly oppressed in America itself are
rampant.
And still the administration is
making aggressive noises towards
two other Muslim states, Syria and
Iran.
In this atmosphere of hatred and
tension, it is doubtful that a lasting
peace could come to fruition; the
only thing the Americans can do is
build the walls already existent
around their nation even higher.
1 think that it's time fora policy
change in America. I think it is time
that America started caring what its
friends and enemies think of it.
For decades in the Middle East,
America had been viewed as a liber
ator, a moral force in opposition to
the imperialism of Britain and Rus
sia. Today, accusations of imperial
ism are levied against the United
States, even by Europeans.
America needs to go back to a
righteous peace- and aid-centric for
eign policy — one that will ensure
its dominance in the world not only
as superpower, but protector and
guardian of liberty.
