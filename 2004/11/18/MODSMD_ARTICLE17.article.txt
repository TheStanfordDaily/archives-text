# Brown and Out
## More than just a name 
### 
My father has a tape
recording of me when I
was little baby girl. He
asks me what my name
is, and I reply in that cute little kid
voice, "Baby Sarines."
Now aside from the fact that's it's
really cute that I said "baby" before
the contraction of my name, it also
says a lot about the way my parents
raised me. You see, if you ask any
one who knows me, they'll easily be
able to describe

to you "the name
thing."
My name is
emphatically not
"Sarah" (pro
nounced in En
glish). my name is
"Saralnes"(pro
nounced in Span
ish). That's it, end
of story.

And I know a lot of people think
that I'm just being a hard-ass, trying
to give people a bad time. It's not
that at all.
Rather, my parents, and my fa
ther especially, raised me to be
proud of who and what 1 am: Mexi
can-American.
While the recording story is cute,
there are bountiful examples in my
life where my parents made a point
to teach me to be proud of who I
was. When my father taught me to
write my name (eight whole letters)
he was very explicit: My name was
two names.
So where do people get the im
pression that they can change my
name without my consent?
1 don't call John "Juan."
1 don't call Mary "Maria."
And so it's really hard for me to
understand how and why someone
would call me "Sarah" after I intro
duce myself as "Sara Ines."
I know it may seem like no big
deal to a lot of people, but I was
named after important people for
important reasons.
My great-grandmother's nick
name was Sara, not Sarah. 1 was
named after Sor Juana Ines de la
Cruz, a relentless and brave spirit,

and so it's not okay to drop her
name off of mine.
In a lot of ways my name has be
come symbolic of how 1 see myself.
The fact that I make a point about
my name just means that I am not
willing to sacrifice who I am for any
one. I don't think anyone has the
right to deny anyone else's identity.
It may seem like a picky and ob
scure thing to care about, but it's
bigger than just letters of the alpha
bet.
There are important scholars
(read: Samuel P. Huntington) in this
country who are of the opinion that
it's more important to forget differ
ences than understand them.
I beg to differ.
If there's anything I have learned
at Stanford, it's that there's so much
I don't know about other people's
cultures. Even differences between
Northern and Southern California,
the West and East coasts, the Mid
west and Texas, Argentines and
Mexicans — there's no end to what
I don't know about.
It's presumptuous to claim that
so many differences shouldn't mat
ter — that assimilation is the only
and best road for the United States.
This especially considering how
making such a statement — that this
country has successfully "assimilat
ed" its immigrant groups — is a du
bious claim in the first place.
I freely admit that I have trouble
pronouncing some people's names,
but I am willing to learn them. I
think it's important to learn the
names people call themselves, but
also to learn why those names are
important to them.
I don't expect everyone to be
able to pronounce my name on the
first try (you don't have to "roll your
r's" to do it), but don't give me a new
one; my parents did a good job the
first time around.
