Did we dodge a bullet this time,
or just ignore one?
This year the litigation expected
post-election did not take place be
cause Bush's victory in Ohio had a
margin just large enough to discour
age disputes. Had his margin been
30.000 votes, the election would
likely have been contested in the
courts for months.
Meanwhile, many voters had to
use computerized voting machines
— "black boxes" with software that
is secret and easy to hack, and with
producers who openly professed a
wish for Bush and the Republicans
to win.
What kind of democracy are we
exporting to the Middle East and
elsewhere if Americans cannot even
have faith in the integrity of their
own electoral system?
What kind of mandate can a
president claim if his constituents
observed fraud and irregularities on
election day?
How can voters trust the results
of elections if the officials who run

them are openly partisan?
In an era when the country is so
evenly divided that many races are
close, it is essential that we all have
faith in, and take pride in.the sys
tem we have to elect our leaders.
It is our responsibility to our
selves, as well as to those who emu
late us, to fix a system that is fatally
flawed. In the long term, the United
States needs to meet the interna
tional standards developed by the
Carter Center.
In the short term, what is needed
is a non-partisan investigation of
voting irregularities this year in
Ohio and Florida by the Federal
Election Commission together with
the organization Election Protec
tion, and a Congressional re-assess
ment of the Help America Vote Act
of 2002 in order to make future
changes in voting procedures
straightforward, lasting and, most
importantly, fair to all parties.
