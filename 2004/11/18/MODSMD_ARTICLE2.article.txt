# Creating dialogue amid an intifada
## 
### ZEWDE YERASWORK 
One of the "major diseases" among outsiders fol
lowing the Israeli / Palestinian conflict is the tenden
cy to pick an opinion and stand by it close-mindedly,
according to Dr. Sylke Tempel, who presented read
ings from her book "We Just Want to Live Here: A
Palestinian Teenager, An Israeli Teenager — An
Unlikely Friendship" at the Women's Community
Center last night.
With the help of two students, Tempel, who
teaches at the Stanford center in Berlin, presented
excerpts from her book to a crowd of about 40 peo
ple. The book offers a view of the Israeli / Palestinian
conflict as seen through a dialogue between two
young women who exchanged letters for several
months.
Tempel said she wanted to communicate through
the book that "it is not too easy to take sides" on the
conflict. "Everyone seems to have an opinion," she
said, but she urged audience members to seek more
knowledge and information about the situation.
She said that over-exposure to news and opinions
about Middle Eastern conflicts can lead to a kind of
apathy. That is in part why she focused on young
people in her book, she said, who would still be open-

minded about the problem.
In deciding who she would use to
set up the dialogue, Tempel said she
considered several different factors.
She decided to have two women
from different neighborhoods in
Jerusalem who were "two worlds
apart," separated physically as well
as by their cultures and by the con
flict. But she also wanted women
who knew one another and had a
basis for trust.
Both Odelia, the Israeli voice in
the book, and Amal, her Palestinian
counterpart, were part of a Theatre

Project together and met on a trip to
Switzerland where they formed "a
wonderful friendship," according to
Tempel. Many of their letters of fo
cused on the current intifada, which
broke out during the exchanges.
Students from the Women's
Community Center read excerpts of
both women's letters.
Tempel described the two women
as very different. She said Odelia is
outspoken, independent and critical
of her government, despite enlisting
in the army. Odelia, Tempel said,
takes her place within the historical
movement of individualism in Israel.
On the other hand, Tempel said
Amal is a traditional Palestinian
woman who relates the Palestinian
"collective narrative" without the
same emphasis on the individual.
Response to both the event and
to Tempel's book specifically was
positive among audience members.
Senior Susan Su said she felt that
Tempel gave an "easy mental exer
cise by scaling the contlict down to
two people avoiding a confusing his
tory," and junior Tanya Haj-Hassan
said she appreciated that the book
was never censored in any way,
claiming the "editors did not force
their opinion onto the women's voic
es."
Prior to last night's event, Tempel
spoke with The Daily about how the
conflict might evolve after Arafat's
death and with the pending Israeli
plan to withdraw from Gaza.
"Every once in a while a new op
portunity opens for solving the polit
ical conflict," she said. "Whether it
can be solved depends on how
quickly a new Palestinian govern
ment will be formed."
Tempel has researched attitudes
of American-Jewish organizations
toward Germany and currently
teaches courses on anti-Semitism in
Germany and post-war German lit
erature at Stanford's Berlin center.
In IW4, she began writing for Ger
man weeklies and magazines as a
Middle East correspondent.
In June 2002, she said she decided
there had been enough op-ed pieces
and media coverage to frustrate the
casual observer and that it was time
to get a perspective on youth in Is
rael and Palestine in order to create
a dialogue between individuals on
both sides.
Even if the political conflict in be
tween Israelis and Palestinians is re
solved. she said. "It will take time to
heal its effects on the people." Re
calling the situation after Europe
after World War 11, Tempel said that
"it would take quite some time fora
friendly relationship to evolve."

Amal is a traditional Palestinian
woman who relates the Palestinian
"collective narrative" without the
same emphasis on the individual.
Response to both the event and
to Tempel's book specifically was
positive among audience members.
Senior Susan Su said she felt that
Tempel gave an "easy mental exer
cise by scaling the contlict down to
two people avoiding a confusing his
tory," and junior Tanya Haj-Hassan
said she appreciated that the book
was never censored in any way,
claiming the "editors did not force
their opinion onto the women's voic
es."
Prior to last night's event, Tempel
spoke with The Daily about how the
conflict might evolve after Arafat's
death and with the pending Israeli
plan to withdraw from Gaza.
"Every once in a while a new op
portunity opens for solving the polit
ical conflict," she said. "Whether it
can be solved depends on how
quickly a new Palestinian govern
ment will be formed."
Tempel has researched attitudes
of American-Jewish organizations
toward Germany and currently
teaches courses on anti-Semitism in
Germany and post-war German lit
erature at Stanford's Berlin center.
In IW4, she began writing for Ger
man weeklies and magazines as a
Middle East correspondent.
In June 2002, she said she decided
there had been enough op-ed pieces
and media coverage to frustrate the
casual observer and that it was time
to get a perspective on youth in Is
rael and Palestine in order to create
a dialogue between individuals on
both sides.
Even if the political conflict in be
tween Israelis and Palestinians is re
solved. she said. "It will take time to
heal its effects on the people." Re
calling the situation after Europe
after World War 11, Tempel said that
"it would take quite some time fora
friendly relationship to evolve."
