# Johnson, Card ready for takeoff
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Trent Johnson left Stan
ford to take over the head coaching
reins at Nevada six years ago, Mike
Montgomery teased his assistant of
three years that he could eventual
ly get a better job by sticking
around the Farm.
"I gotta go to work, this thing's
on auto-pilot around here," John
son recalls telling Montgomery at
the time, referring to Stanford's
nationally established basketball
program, which made its 10th con
secutive NCAA Tournament ap
pearance last season.
Well, Johnson's work at Neva
da helped turn a perennial door
mat into a national contender in
the span of half a decade. The
Wolf Pack's record improved in
each of his five years in Reno, cul
minating with a 25-win season and
the school's first Sweet Ift appear
ance last March.
Now, Johnson is back at Stan
ford, set to begin his first season as
head coach after Montgomery,
who won 393 games in 18 seasons
on the Farm, took over as head
coach of the NBA s Golden State
Warriors. Upon congratulating
Johnson after he was given the
Stanford job, Montgomery jok
ingly reminded his good friend of
what he said six years ago, telling
Johnson, "Don't screw it up, it's
on auto-pilot."
"Sustaining a level of excellence
is always the biggest challenge,"
said Johnson, who admits he is eat
ing his words after inheriting a pro
gram that has won 20-plus games in
each of the past 10 seasons. "It's

tough to remain at an elite level, but
we're going to do everything to sus
tain that level, and in my own mind
I think we'll be okay."
If Saturday's 88-64 exhibition
game victory and the Cardinal
players' accounts of the past four
weeks of official practice are any
indication, the Stanford basket
ball program's auto-pi!ot controls
are in good hands heading into to
morrow night's season opener
against San Francisco at The
Arena in Oakland.
"There's been no real adjust
ment." senior center Rob Little said.
"Coach Johnson has the same phi
losophy as Coach Montgomery and
it's been business as usual. Every
thing's been real smooth. Coach
Johnson has just really added a
spark to this team, an element of in
tensity that's been real positive."
"I think the first week was a lit
tle rough, as everyone was getting
a feel for Coach Johnson," said ju
nior point guard Jason Haas. "But
now, I think everyone, including
the assistant coaches, knows their
role and what to expect out of each
other."
Many factors have facilitated
the smooth, natural transition pe
riod for both Johnson and his
players. The short list of those fac
tors includes the retention of Stan
ford assistant coaches Tony Fuller
and Eric Reveno and the lack of
wholesale changes to the team's
offensive and defensive system.
There's a prevailing sense at Stan
ford, from talking to Johnson and
the team, that the system is bigger
than any one player or coach.
"Most everything is run pretty
similar," said junior forward Matt

Haryasz. "The practices are a little
shorter and more intense. There's
a little less teaching and a little
more go. go, go. He's made a little
of his own tweaks here and there,
but it's basically the same system."
The tweaks, according to John
son, primarily have to do with per
sonnel, as Stanford must make up
for the loss of four key ingredients
from last year's team that won the
Pac-10 title and a school-record 30
games. The most notable, Ail-
American swingman Josh Chil
dress, left for the NBA. But Stan
ford also lost a dependable big man
in Justin Davis, a fiery sharp-shoot
er in Matt Lottich and an underrat
ed reserve in Joe Kirchofer to grad
uation.
Junior point guard Chris Her
nandez, who averaged 10 points
per game last season, will be the
team's offensive catalyst this sea
son. More of the scoring burden
will also fall on versatile senior
Nick Robinson, whom Johnson
helped recruit, and Haryasz, who
could be primed fora breakout
season in his first year as a starter
alongside Little down low.
The losses of Childress and Lot
tich leave Stanford without many
experienced long-range threats,
but Johnson downplayed the idea

of a competition for the starting
spot at shooting guard thought to
be between junior Dan Grunfeld,
sophomore Fred Washington and
redshirt freshman Tim Morris.
"The amount of minutes that
any of those guys get is going to be
predicated off how well they de
fend." Johnson said. "I've been
pleased with all three of them. I
think they're all more worried
about being the best possible play
er for 40 minutes combined as op
posed to who's going to be 'the
guy' so to speak."
Grunfeld got the starting nod
against Concordia on Saturday and
responded by scoring 22 points, but
Washington and Morris, along
with Haas, will see a lot of time off
the bench. With Evan Moore and
Mark Bradford yet to join the team
due to football commitments, the
Cardinal are not particularly deep
entering the season.
What Stanford has lost in the
way of scoring and athletic ability
in the case of Childress, Johnson
hopes to make up for, at least in
the first part of the season, with a
strong, aggressive defense.
"1 think we have a chance to be
a pretty good team defensively,"
Johnson said. "That could be one
of our strengths. Offensively, I

think those roles are going to have
to develop with time."
While the national media
haven't dropped the Cardinal
eompletely off the radar, expecta
tions are understandably lower
than last season. Stanford has been
picked to finish third in the Pac-1()
in the Preseason Media Poll be
hind Arizona and Washington and
is No. 25 in the first ESPN / USA
Today Coaches Poll. Stanford
opened last season at No. 20.
" This is old hat for us, not being
ranked [high] at the beginning of
the season." Haryaszsaid. "I think
every year we kind of go in with
something to prove, and this year
probably even more so."
In his office last week, Johnson
reiterated something he said at the
Pac-10 Men's Basketball Media
Day earlier this month.
"I told guys in the first meeting,
don't worry about the end of the
year, don't worry about the middle
of the year and don't worry about
the start of the year," he said. "Just
worry about every day in practice,
trying to be as aggressive as possible
and somehow enjoy it. And at the
end of the year, let the chips fall
where they may."

riod for both Johnson and his
players. The short list of those fac
tors includes the retention of Stan
ford assistant coaches Tony Fuller
and Eric Reveno and the lack of
wholesale changes to the team's
offensive and defensive system.
There's a prevailing sense at Stan
ford, from talking to Johnson and
the team, that the system is bigger
than any one player or coach.
"Most everything is run pretty
similar," said junior forward Matt

Haryasz. "The practices are a little
shorter and more intense. There's
a little less teaching and a little
more go. go, go. He's made a little
of his own tweaks here and there,
but it's basically the same system."
The tweaks, according to John
son, primarily have to do with per
sonnel, as Stanford must make up
for the loss of four key ingredients
from last year's team that won the
Pac-10 title and a school-record 30
games. The most notable, Ail-
American swingman Josh Chil
dress, left for the NBA. But Stan
ford also lost a dependable big man
in Justin Davis, a fiery sharp-shoot
er in Matt Lottich and an underrat
ed reserve in Joe Kirchofer to grad
uation.
Junior point guard Chris Her
nandez, who averaged 10 points
per game last season, will be the
team's offensive catalyst this sea
son. More of the scoring burden
will also fall on versatile senior
Nick Robinson, whom Johnson
helped recruit, and Haryasz, who
could be primed fora breakout
season in his first year as a starter
alongside Little down low.
The losses of Childress and Lot
tich leave Stanford without many
experienced long-range threats,
but Johnson downplayed the idea

of a competition for the starting
spot at shooting guard thought to
be between junior Dan Grunfeld,
sophomore Fred Washington and
redshirt freshman Tim Morris.
"The amount of minutes that
any of those guys get is going to be
predicated off how well they de
fend." Johnson said. "I've been
pleased with all three of them. I
think they're all more worried
about being the best possible play
er for 40 minutes combined as op
posed to who's going to be 'the
guy' so to speak."
Grunfeld got the starting nod
against Concordia on Saturday and
responded by scoring 22 points, but
Washington and Morris, along
with Haas, will see a lot of time off
the bench. With Evan Moore and
Mark Bradford yet to join the team
due to football commitments, the
Cardinal are not particularly deep
entering the season.
What Stanford has lost in the
way of scoring and athletic ability
in the case of Childress, Johnson
hopes to make up for, at least in
the first part of the season, with a
strong, aggressive defense.
"1 think we have a chance to be
a pretty good team defensively,"
Johnson said. "That could be one
of our strengths. Offensively, I

think those roles are going to have
to develop with time."
While the national media
haven't dropped the Cardinal
eompletely off the radar, expecta
tions are understandably lower
than last season. Stanford has been
picked to finish third in the Pac-1()
in the Preseason Media Poll be
hind Arizona and Washington and
is No. 25 in the first ESPN / USA
Today Coaches Poll. Stanford
opened last season at No. 20.
" This is old hat for us, not being
ranked [high] at the beginning of
the season." Haryaszsaid. "I think
every year we kind of go in with
something to prove, and this year
probably even more so."
In his office last week, Johnson
reiterated something he said at the
Pac-10 Men's Basketball Media
Day earlier this month.
"I told guys in the first meeting,
don't worry about the end of the
year, don't worry about the middle
of the year and don't worry about
the start of the year," he said. "Just
worry about every day in practice,
trying to be as aggressive as possible
and somehow enjoy it. And at the
end of the year, let the chips fall
where they may."

New head coach Trent Johnson led Nevada to the Sweet 16 last season.


LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily
The starting five, from left: Dan Grunfeld, Rob Little, Nick Robinson, Chris Hernandez and Matt Haryasz.
When Trent Johnson left Stan
ford to take over the head coaching
reins at Nevada six years ago, Mike
Montgomery teased his assistant of
three years that he could eventual
ly get a better job by sticking
around the Farm.
"I gotta go to work, this thing's
on auto-pilot around here," John
son recalls telling Montgomery at
the time, referring to Stanford's
nationally established basketball
program, which made its 10th con
secutive NCAA Tournament ap
pearance last season.
Well, Johnson's work at Neva
da helped turn a perennial door
mat into a national contender in
the span of half a decade. The
Wolf Pack's record improved in
each of his five years in Reno, cul
minating with a 25-win season and
the school's first Sweet Ift appear
ance last March.
Now, Johnson is back at Stan
ford, set to begin his first season as
head coach after Montgomery,
who won 393 games in 18 seasons
on the Farm, took over as head
coach of the NBA s Golden State
Warriors. Upon congratulating
Johnson after he was given the
Stanford job, Montgomery jok
ingly reminded his good friend of
what he said six years ago, telling
Johnson, "Don't screw it up, it's
on auto-pilot."
"Sustaining a level of excellence
is always the biggest challenge,"
said Johnson, who admits he is eat
ing his words after inheriting a pro
gram that has won 20-plus games in
each of the past 10 seasons. "It's

tough to remain at an elite level, but
we're going to do everything to sus
tain that level, and in my own mind
I think we'll be okay."
If Saturday's 88-64 exhibition
game victory and the Cardinal
players' accounts of the past four
weeks of official practice are any
indication, the Stanford basket
ball program's auto-pi!ot controls
are in good hands heading into to
morrow night's season opener
against San Francisco at The
Arena in Oakland.
"There's been no real adjust
ment." senior center Rob Little said.
"Coach Johnson has the same phi
losophy as Coach Montgomery and
it's been business as usual. Every
thing's been real smooth. Coach
Johnson has just really added a
spark to this team, an element of in
tensity that's been real positive."
"I think the first week was a lit
tle rough, as everyone was getting
a feel for Coach Johnson," said ju
nior point guard Jason Haas. "But
now, I think everyone, including
the assistant coaches, knows their
role and what to expect out of each
other."
