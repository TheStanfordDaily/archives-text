# Frosh bring in East Coast flair

### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
To Stanford basketball fans still lament
ing the loss of Josh Childress, Justin Davis
and Joe Kirchofer, three talented and pop
ular frontcourt players: Help is on the way.
And it may look more like the team's past
than its future.
Freshman center Peter Prowitt has
drawn comparisons to former Stanford Ail-
American Mark Madsen with his physical
post play.
"He has got Madsen-esque qualities
about him." said associate head coach Eric
Revino. "He plays really hard and enjoys
doing the dirty work."
And freshman power forward Taj Finger
has drawn attention for his fastidious ap
proach to basketball fundamentals. He
spent part of his summer running through
drills in the driveway of a man known as
"The Shot Doctor," dribbling through
cones and pulling up for jumpers in an at
tempt to improve his shot off the dribble.
Finger and Prowitt, who are from New
York and Pennsylvania, respectively, bring
with them a hard-nosed East Coast mental
ity, and the team will rely on their old
school styles of play to provide precious
depth at the positions where the team needs
it most. The adjustment from high school to
college ball is a big one, but Prowitt and Fin
ger will likely be asked to contribute right
away.
That fact was evident in the Cardinal's
first exhibition game against Concordia last
Saturday. Finger played 10 minutes, scored
three points and pulled down four re
bounds. He played aggressive defense on
the interior and around the perimeter, al
tering several shots and forcing a turnover.
Prowitt tallied three points in seven min
utes and played solid defense in the paint
against Concordia's overmatched big men.
"It's definitely a learning curve," Prowitt

said of the adjustment to college ball. "It
feels like the whole world has been dumped
on your shoulders in the first few weeks of
practice."
Finger added, "There has been a big
change in intensity from high school. We
work hard during every second of practice."
Both said that that they have had to ad
just to a faster and more physical style of
play. But if there is one indicator that they
will have success at this level, it is that each
is eager to learn.
Prowitt says that senior center Rob Little
has taken him under his wing and taught
him how to play in the Pac-10.
"Rob is one of the most fundamentally
sound centers in the Pac-10, if not in the en
tire nation, and he tcaches you all of the lit
tle things," Prowitt said.
Finger has been working on his game
with fellow power forward Matt Haryasz.
After spending the summer working on his
outside touch, he has been trying to im
prove his low-post moves.
"Finger has been very impressive in terms
of how he battles Matt Haryasz every day,"
said head coach Trent Johnson. "He's tough
kid, and his slight build is very deceiving."
Finger is stronger than he looks, but he will
need to bulk up on his 6'B", 185-pound frame
if he hopes to become a force down low.
On the other hand, Prowitt, who at 6' 10"
and 250 pounds is already bigger {Kan Mad
sen was, might have to pull in the reins at
times on his physical play, according to his
coach.
"Peter Prowitt is your ultimate banger,"
said Johnson, before adding, "We've got to
do a better job as a staff of getting him to un
derstand when to be physical and when
not."
Prowitt's physical play got him in trouble
in the exhibition when he was ejected for
throwing a retaliatory elbow at Concordia's
Chris Hull near the end of the game.
"The game didn't go the way I wanted it

to," Prowitt said afterwards. "Hopefully it
won't happen again."
The Cardinal will need Prowitt to be
available for every game because he and
Little are the team's only true centers.
Haryasz can also play the position, as he did
occasionally in the exhibition, but he will
have his hands full in his first year as a full
time starter.
"It's really in my own hands whether I
play or not," Prowitt said.
Finger will also be expected to contribute
from the get-go. As long as the 6'7" Evan
Moore is catching passes for the football
team. Finger will be the only option off the
bench at the power forward position. He
hopes to eventually be able to switch be
tween the forward positions, but for now he
will remain directly behind Haryasz on the
depth chart.
"They're going to have to play," Johnson
said. "1 have enough confidence in Peter
and Taj that they'll be ready to go. They
didn't come here to sit and watch."
Prowitt and Finger will be thrown into
the fire, there is no doubt about it, but
they have earned the opportunity. Finger
posted gaudy statistics in high school and
was a menace on defense, averaging eight
blocks and five steals per game. He led
his team. Fox Lane High, to a sectional
championship.
Prowitt comes highly recommended as
well; he was a pre-season McDonald's Ail-
American and one of the most sought-after
centers in the nation. And when it comes to
battling in the low post, who couldn't use a
little "Mad Dog" in them?
"I love Madsen's game," said Prowitt,
before adding, "but we're not the same
player. We do a lot of things differently."
The team does not need another Mad
sen, it just needs a little depth. And if
Prowitt and Finger can provide that, the
Cardinal faithful might be seeing visions of
seasons past a lot sooner than expected.

Chris Hull near the end of the game.
"The game didn't go the way I wanted it

to," Prowitt said afterwards. "Hopefully it
won't happen again."
The Cardinal will need Prowitt to be
available for every game because he and
Little are the team's only true centers.
Haryasz can also play the position, as he did
occasionally in the exhibition, but he will
have his hands full in his first year as a full
time starter.
"It's really in my own hands whether I
play or not," Prowitt said.
Finger will also be expected to contribute
from the get-go. As long as the 6'7" Evan
Moore is catching passes for the football
team. Finger will be the only option off the
bench at the power forward position. He
hopes to eventually be able to switch be
tween the forward positions, but for now he
will remain directly behind Haryasz on the
depth chart.
"They're going to have to play," Johnson
said. "1 have enough confidence in Peter
and Taj that they'll be ready to go. They
didn't come here to sit and watch."
Prowitt and Finger will be thrown into
the fire, there is no doubt about it, but
they have earned the opportunity. Finger
posted gaudy statistics in high school and
was a menace on defense, averaging eight
blocks and five steals per game. He led
his team. Fox Lane High, to a sectional
championship.
Prowitt comes highly recommended as
well; he was a pre-season McDonald's Ail-
American and one of the most sought-after
centers in the nation. And when it comes to
battling in the low post, who couldn't use a
little "Mad Dog" in them?
"I love Madsen's game," said Prowitt,
before adding, "but we're not the same
player. We do a lot of things differently."
The team does not need another Mad
sen, it just needs a little depth. And if
Prowitt and Finger can provide that, the
Cardinal faithful might be seeing visions of
seasons past a lot sooner than expected.
To Stanford basketball fans still lament
ing the loss of Josh Childress, Justin Davis
and Joe Kirchofer, three talented and pop
ular frontcourt players: Help is on the way.
And it may look more like the team's past
than its future.
Freshman center Peter Prowitt has
drawn comparisons to former Stanford Ail-
American Mark Madsen with his physical
post play.
"He has got Madsen-esque qualities
about him." said associate head coach Eric
Revino. "He plays really hard and enjoys
doing the dirty work."
And freshman power forward Taj Finger
has drawn attention for his fastidious ap
proach to basketball fundamentals. He
spent part of his summer running through
drills in the driveway of a man known as
"The Shot Doctor," dribbling through
cones and pulling up for jumpers in an at
tempt to improve his shot off the dribble.
Finger and Prowitt, who are from New
York and Pennsylvania, respectively, bring
with them a hard-nosed East Coast mental
ity, and the team will rely on their old
school styles of play to provide precious
depth at the positions where the team needs
it most. The adjustment from high school to
college ball is a big one, but Prowitt and Fin
ger will likely be asked to contribute right
away.
That fact was evident in the Cardinal's
first exhibition game against Concordia last
Saturday. Finger played 10 minutes, scored
three points and pulled down four re
bounds. He played aggressive defense on
the interior and around the perimeter, al
tering several shots and forcing a turnover.
Prowitt tallied three points in seven min
utes and played solid defense in the paint
against Concordia's overmatched big men.
"It's definitely a learning curve," Prowitt

said of the adjustment to college ball. "It
feels like the whole world has been dumped
on your shoulders in the first few weeks of
practice."
Finger added, "There has been a big
change in intensity from high school. We
work hard during every second of practice."
Both said that that they have had to ad
just to a faster and more physical style of
play. But if there is one indicator that they
will have success at this level, it is that each
is eager to learn.
Prowitt says that senior center Rob Little
has taken him under his wing and taught
him how to play in the Pac-10.
"Rob is one of the most fundamentally
sound centers in the Pac-10, if not in the en
tire nation, and he tcaches you all of the lit
tle things," Prowitt said.
Finger has been working on his game
with fellow power forward Matt Haryasz.
After spending the summer working on his
outside touch, he has been trying to im
prove his low-post moves.
"Finger has been very impressive in terms
of how he battles Matt Haryasz every day,"
said head coach Trent Johnson. "He's tough
kid, and his slight build is very deceiving."
Finger is stronger than he looks, but he will
need to bulk up on his 6'B", 185-pound frame
if he hopes to become a force down low.
On the other hand, Prowitt, who at 6' 10"
and 250 pounds is already bigger {Kan Mad
sen was, might have to pull in the reins at
times on his physical play, according to his
coach.
"Peter Prowitt is your ultimate banger,"
said Johnson, before adding, "We've got to
do a better job as a staff of getting him to un
derstand when to be physical and when
not."
Prowitt's physical play got him in trouble
in the exhibition when he was ejected for
throwing a retaliatory elbow at Concordia's
Chris Hull near the end of the game.
"The game didn't go the way I wanted it

to," Prowitt said afterwards. "Hopefully it
won't happen again."
