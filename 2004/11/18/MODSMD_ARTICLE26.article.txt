# Is there a Pac-10 rebound on the horizon?
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last year was a down year for the Pacif
ic-10 Conference as a whole. Only three
teams received bids to the NCAA Tourna
ment, and two of those were eliminated in
the first round (Arizona and Washington).
Even top-seeded Stanford couldn't make it
to the second weekend of the Big Dance,
dousing the flames of Pac-10 fans who
screamed of an East Coast media bias and
ACC love affair during the regular season.
So will the Pac-10 rebound this year?
Arizona head coach Lute Olson thinks so.
At the Pac-10 men's basketball preseason
media day, he declared that this year the
conference is the best it's been in the 22
years he's been in Tucson. That's a ringing
endorsement from a wise man, but only
time will tell if Olson is on point. Here's a
preview of all the Pac-10 teams, listed in
order of their predicted finish by the Pre
season Media Poll.
No. 10 Arizona Wildcats
(20-10,11-7 Pac-10/3rd)
While the hype is subdued this season
with triple-double threat Andre Iguodala

now in the NBA, head coach Lute Olson re
turns one of the most experienced and ath
letic lineups in the nation. All-Conference
forward Channing Frye anchors a front
court that is bolstered by the return of Isa
iah Fox from a knee injury. Forward Has
san Adams is Pac-10 POY material, and se
nior guard Salim Stoudamire is one of the
conference's most dangerous scorers when
his head is in the game.
The difference-maker for the Wildcats
this season will be sophomore point guard
Mustafa Shakur, who has looked excellent
in the early going. He dropped 23 points,
grabbed eight rebounds and dished out
seven assists against San Diego.
No. 22 Washington Huskies
(19-12,12-6 Pac-10/2nd)
There wasn't a hotter team to be found
toward the end of last season than Lorenzo
Romar's Huskies, who started the confer
ence season 0-5 only to win 14 of their final
17 games of the season to make its first
NCAA Tournament appearance since
1999. All five starters — all of whom aver
aged double-figures — return. High-flying
little-man Nate Robinson, Brandon Roy
and Will Conroy form one of the best back

courts in the Pac-10.
Like Arizona, Washington should have
no trouble reaching the 80-point plateau on
a consistent basis, but there are legitimate
concerns about the team's interior defense
and ability to control the boards. New Mex
ico transfer Jamaal Williams, a 6-foot-5,
240-pound forward, should provide much
needed frontcourt help.
Stanford Cardinal
(30-2,17-1 Pac-10/lst)
Will the Cardinal go 17-1 in the Pac-10
and win 30 games again? No, but that
doesn't mean this is a rebuilding year on the
Farm. New head coach Trent Johnson
learned a lot about the program and coach
ing during his three years at Stanford as an
assistant under former head coach Mike
Montgomery, and the Cardinal's tradition
of basketball excellence shouldn't skip a
beat with him at the helm. What the Cardi
nal have lost is well documented, but Stan
ford returns a solid nucleus of veterans that
know how to win — seniors Nick Robinson
and Rob Little and junior Chris Hernandez
— and a talented group of underclassmen.
Hernandez will set the tone on both ends of
the floor. The 2004-05 Cardinal are deter
mined to form their own identity, which
they hope includes an 11th consecutive
NCAA Tournament bid.
Oregon Ducks
<18-13,9-9/4 th)
The Ducks must replace All-American
Luke Jackson, which is no easy task consid
ering the mop-topped All-Pac-10 selection
was the team's leading scorer, rebounder
and assist man. Oregon also said goodbye
to seniors Andre Joseph and James Davis,
two of the Pac-10's best three-point shoot
ers the past few years, as well as forward
Jay Anderson.
All told, the Ducks return only 38 per
cent of their scoring from a year ago, so why
is everyone still relatively high on Oregon?
Two words: impact recruits. Malik Hair
ston, who figures to be the fourth recent
Duck to be selected in the first round, gets
most of the press, but fellow freshman
guard Bryce Taylor is considered the
squad's best shooter and should also make
an immediate impact.
UCLA Bruins
(11-17,7-11/T-7th)
Last season marked the first time in over
60 years that the Bruins had consecutive
losing seasons. With the return of Dijon
Thompson, who toyed with the idea of re
maining in the NBA draft before ultimately
withdrawing his name, and the addition of a
star-studded recruiting class, a third consec
utive losing season seems highly unlikely.
In fact, the Bruins think they have a real
istic shot at making the NCAA Tourna

ment, which might not be so far-fetched
given their blend of experienced seniors
and talented freshmen. McDonald's All-
Americans Jordan Farmar and Arron Af
flalo, the two gems of head coach Ben How
land's 2004 class, will form UCLA's starting
backcourt. Seven-foot seniors Ryan Hollins
and Michael Fey, who Howland would like
to see become more aggressive, will anchor
the frontline along with Thompson. They'll
have to step up with the departure of T.J.
Cummings and Trevor Ariza.
USC Trojans
<13-15,8-10/6IH)
All across the Pac-10, student sections
are mourning the loss of USC guard
Desmon Farmer, the easily ridiculed up
side-down-headband-wearing leader of the
Trojans. Without Farmer, who scored 40
points in a game against Arizona last sea
son, USC will likely turn to reigning Pac-10
Newcomer of the Year Jeff McMillan as its
go-to guy. The transfer from Fordham
recorded 10 double-doubles last season.
The Craven twins (Errick and Derrick)
form a strong backcourt, to which Allegany
Junior College transfer Dwayne Shackle
ford will add depth and play-making ability
when he returns from an ankle injury. The
Trojans' defense was one of the Pac-10's
weakest last season.
California Golden Bears
(13-15,9-9 Pac-10/T-4th)
Normally, after a season in which fresh
man account for 52 percent of your team's
offense, your prospects for improving the
following year are very good. Then again,
it's not every day that your best player is lost

for the season to a knee injury. Head coach
Ben Braun's troops are learning to adjust to
life without reigning Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year Leon Powe, and as the Bears
learned in a home loss to Saint Mary's last
week, it won't be easy. Powe's injury, cou
pled with the graduation of Amit Tamir,
means the Bears need more production out
of sophomore forwards Marquise Kately
and Dominic McGuire. For the second con
secutive season, Cal's freshmen — Eric
Vierneisel, Kevin Langford and DeVon
Hardin — will be forced to grow up fast.
The future is bright in Berkeley, but this
could be a rough year.
Oregon Stale Beavers
(12-16,6-12/9 th)
With head coach Jay John returning all
five starters and 11 lettermen overall, Ore
gon State entered the preseason as a team
with the potential to surprise some people
this year. That was until All-Pac-10 senior
forward David Lucas underwent surgery to
repair a tendon in his right big toe. It is not
known when Lucas, who played with pain in
the same toe last seen, will return. Guards
J.S. Nash and Chris Stephens should put up
good numbers, as the Beavers will also look
for forward Kyle Jeffers, who bulked up
during the offseason, to increase his pro
duction with Lucas out.
It's been 14 seasons since the Beavers
finished with a winning record and that
probably won't change this year, unless
Oregon State plays significantly better on
the road. The Beavers were 1-10 away from
Gill Coliseum last season.
Washington State Cougars
(13-17,7-117T-7th)

Freshmen could turn Bruins around

Head coach Dick Bennett did a remark
able job during his first season in Pullman,
transforming the Cougars from Pac-10
doormat (two conference wins in 2002-03)
to a team that plays everyone close. Ben
nett's system regularly frustrated and rat
tled opposing team's offenses, as the
Cougars held opponents to a Pac-10 best
59.7 points per game.
Of course, Washington State was also the
lowest-scoring team in the Pac-10 and now
must replace all-conference guard and of
fensive leader Marcus Moore. Thomas Ke
lati and Jeff Varem are the team's top scor
ing threats entering the season. Freshman
point guard Derrick Low, who led his high
school team to three Hawaii state titles, suf
fered a broken foot and will be out at least
another month. The Cougars could struggle
early on as they try to find consistent scor
ing options, but their defense will keep
them in most games.
Arizona State Sun Devils
(10-17,4-14 Pac-10/lOth)
Where would this team be without junior
pre-season All-American Ike Diogu? Hon
estly, it might finish 11th in the Pac-10. The
Sun Devils can take solace in the fact that
there is nowhere to go but up, but another
season in the conference cellar seems more
likely. Stevie Moore, who established him
self as one of the conference's best three
point shooters last season, and fellow senior
guard Jason Braxton hope to take some of
the burden — and defenders — off Diogu,
while sophomores Kevin Kruger, Wilfried
Fameni and Serge Angounou look to put up
better numbers with a year of experience
under their belts. JuCo transfers Tyrone
Jackson and Bryson Krueger will see quite
a bit of playing time.
