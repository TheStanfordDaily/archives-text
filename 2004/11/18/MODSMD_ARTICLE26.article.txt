# Is there a Pac-10 rebound on the horizon?
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last year was a down year for the Pacif
ic-10 Conference as a whole. Only three
teams received bids to the NCAA Tourna
ment, and two of those were eliminated in
the first round (Arizona and Washington).
Even top-seeded Stanford couldn't make it
to the second weekend of the Big Dance,
dousing the flames of Pac-10 fans who
screamed of an East Coast media bias and
ACC love affair during the regular season.
So will the Pac-10 rebound this year?
Arizona head coach Lute Olson thinks so.
At the Pac-10 men's basketball preseason
media day, he declared that this year the
conference is the best it's been in the 22
years he's been in Tucson. That's a ringing
endorsement from a wise man, but only
time will tell if Olson is on point. Here's a
preview of all the Pac-10 teams, listed in
order of their predicted finish by the Pre
season Media Poll.
No. 10 Arizona Wildcats
(20-10,11-7 Pac-10/3rd)
While the hype is subdued this season
with triple-double threat Andre Iguodala

now in the NBA, head coach Lute Olson re
turns one of the most experienced and ath
letic lineups in the nation. All-Conference
forward Channing Frye anchors a front
court that is bolstered by the return of Isa
iah Fox from a knee injury. Forward Has
san Adams is Pac-10 POY material, and se
nior guard Salim Stoudamire is one of the
conference's most dangerous scorers when
his head is in the game.
The difference-maker for the Wildcats
this season will be sophomore point guard
Mustafa Shakur, who has looked excellent
in the early going. He dropped 23 points,
grabbed eight rebounds and dished out
seven assists against San Diego.
No. 22 Washington Huskies
(19-12,12-6 Pac-10/2nd)
There wasn't a hotter team to be found
toward the end of last season than Lorenzo
Romar's Huskies, who started the confer
ence season 0-5 only to win 14 of their final
17 games of the season to make its first
NCAA Tournament appearance since
1999. All five starters — all of whom aver
aged double-figures — return. High-flying
little-man Nate Robinson, Brandon Roy
and Will Conroy form one of the best back

courts in the Pac-10.
Like Arizona, Washington should have
no trouble reaching the 80-point plateau on
a consistent basis, but there are legitimate
concerns about the team's interior defense
and ability to control the boards. New Mex
ico transfer Jamaal Williams, a 6-foot-5,
240-pound forward, should provide much
needed frontcourt help.
Stanford Cardinal
(30-2,17-1 Pac-10/lst)
Will the Cardinal go 17-1 in the Pac-10
and win 30 games again? No, but that
doesn't mean this is a rebuilding year on the
Farm. New head coach Trent Johnson
learned a lot about the program and coach
ing during his three years at Stanford as an
assistant under former head coach Mike
Montgomery, and the Cardinal's tradition
of basketball excellence shouldn't skip a
beat with him at the helm. What the Cardi
nal have lost is well documented, but Stan
ford returns a solid nucleus of veterans that
know how to win — seniors Nick Robinson
and Rob Little and junior Chris Hernandez
— and a talented group of underclassmen.
