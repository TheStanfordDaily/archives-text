# Three other fresh faces to know
## 
### 
1. Malik Hairston, Oregon
A 2004 McDonald's Ail-American
and member of the USA Junior Na
tional Select Team, Hairston was
tabbed by some recruiting services as
the top shooting guard prospect in
the nation. The 6-foot-5, 190-pound

Detroit prod
uct has some
huge shoes to
till in Eugene
with all-every
thing Luke
Jackson now in
the NBA. While
Hairston won't
immedi at e 1 y
put up Jack
son-e s q u e
numbers, head
coach Ernie

Kent says he is more mature as a
freshman than Jackson and the two
first-round selections that left before
him — Luke Ridnour and Freddie
Jones — were.

2. Jordan Far mar, UCLA
Like Hairston, Farmar was a 2004
McDonald's All-American and a
member of the USAJunior National
Select Team. The 6-foot-2, 170-
pound shooting guard once scored
54 points in a high school game and
will be relied upon to help revive a
Bruins offense that averaged only 66

points per
game last
season.
Farmar av
era g e d
14.5 points
and 5.5 as
sists per
game in
the Bruins'
two exhibi
tion con
tests.

3. Arron Afflalo, UCLA
Talk about a coach's dream. After
scoring a team-high 17 points in an ex
hibition game last week, all Afflalo
wanted to talk about was his defense.
That's good news for Ben Howland
and the Bruins, who lost their best de
fender. Cedric Bozeman, for 6-to-8
months to a knee injury. Bozeman's

injury means
major minutes
for Afflalo, but
the 6-foot-5,
206-pound
Compton na
tive and 2004
McDonald's
All-Arnerican
should answer
the challenge
