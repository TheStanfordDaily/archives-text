# Around the nation: Five storylines to watch out for this season
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
1. THE STACKED ACC
A Final Four with every team from the same conference? It's
an unlikely scenario but not unfathomable, thanks to the At
lantic Coast Conference. The ACC has, by most accounts, three
of the nation's top four teams in Wake Forest, North Carolina
and national runner-up Georgia Tech. No. 11 Duke and No. 19
North Carolina State could also compete for the No. 1 ranking
and don't forget about ACC Tournament champion Maryland.
The ACC is loaded with proven players, including five of the na
tion's best — Wake Forest's guard tandem of Chris Paul and
Justin Gray, N.C. State swingman Julius Hodge, Duke guard J.J
Redick and North Carolina guard Rashad McCants.
Due to a scheduling change, we may never know who
true champion of the ACC is. The additions of Virginia Tech
and Miami to the conference this year mean that the A (as
traditional round robin schedule of a home-and-home series
with every team will not be possible.
2. JAYHAWKS' LAST STAND
Kansas is the only team that stands in the way of turning the
Final Four into an ACC reunion. In the age of players using col
lege as a one-year pit stop on their way to the pros, the three best
players on the best team in the country are seniors. Kansas will
start pre-season All-American forward Wayne Simien, along
with Keith Langford and Aaron Miles in the backcourt.
Anything less than a National Championship would be a

disappointment for this grottp, which has come tantalizingly
close to cutting down the nets without actually following
through for three consecutiyeyears. They have played in three
Elite Eights, two Final Fours and one National Championship
game, but the trio didn't stay in school for another second
place finish.
3. FAB FROSHi^
Carmelo Anthony upset Kansas' title bid in 2003, and there
is a chance that a freshman might do it to them again this sea
son. No. 9 Kentucky and No. 8 Connecticut, the defending Na
tional Champion, wiliixjth use the opposite of Kansas' mold
and feature freshraqptf prominent roles.
Kentucky's Randolph Morris, a <>10.270-pound center and a
bf Tubby Smith's best player. He al
most tOtojppPWfTteammate Josh Howard to the draft, but
dmOTone wanted to try to win a National Championship and
claims that he won't leave Kentucky until he's done so.
The Huskies' an explosive above-the-rim player,
is a 6'9" swingmaiyppho can play either shooting guard or small
forward. He has drawn raves from his own coach, Jim
who hopes that Gay will develop the ability to take over a game
and carry the Huskies on his shoulders this season.
4. ROOKIE COACHES
A number of major programs outside of Stanford also
made coaching changes in the off-season, including St. John's,*
which picked Norm Roberts to succeed Mike Jarvis and

UNLV, which tapped former Atlanta Hawks coach Lon
Kruger to take over for Charlie Spoonhour.
The Runnin' Rebels were 18-13 last year under Spoonhour,
who left for health reasons, and they have been picked to win
the Mountain West Conference this year. The Rebels return
three double-digit scorers and are expected to improve upon a
. good year. Kruger is a good coach; he flopped in the NBA, but
the Hawks would have flopped with John Wooden at the helm.
The Johnnies have fallen far and fast since their 1999 Elite
Eight appearance. Jarvis was fired only six games into the sea
son last year, and things only got worse from there. Six players
were kicked off the team after an embarrassing sex scandal,
one was suspended and another got the boot for smoking mar
ijuana. St. John's finished an anemic 1-15 in the Big East,
going 4-17 overall after Jarvis's firing.
5. THE RISE OF THE "MID-MAJOR"
What is a (so-called) mid-major, you ask? It is the team (or
teams) that gives you fits when filling out your tournament
bracket because you weren't even aware the school existed.
|pSee Weber State, lona, Creighton, Austin Peay and, most
memorably, Gonzaga. Tlie Southern Illinois Salukis have had
such success as a mid-major that they have lost two coaches in
two years to bigger schools.
The latest mid-sensation is St. Mary's, which upset Berke
i ley to advance to the semis in the Coaches vs. Cancer Classic.
| As the season progresses, there will be more mid-majors who
■ *fall into the national radar. It might be wise to remember their
names come tournament time.
