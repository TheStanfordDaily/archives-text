# Free speech shouldn't be sacrificed, scholar says

### SARAH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
Leading First Amendment schol
ar Geoffery Stone argued that the
United States has "a long history of
overreacting in wartime" in a speech
at the Law School last night. Stone's
thesis is that there is a causal rela
tionship exist war and infringement
of civil liberties. Citing six historical
examples, Stone's speech mirrored
the argument he proposed in his re
cent book "Perilous Times: Free
Speech in Wartime."
Stone asserted that in times of
war, the government wants the na
tion's undivided support with few
restrictions placed on its processes.
In order to achieve this goal, politi
cians restrict civil liberties â€” often
limiting freedom of speech and oc
casionally suspending the writ of
habeas corpus (which prohibits the
government from detaining people
without judicial regulation).
Stone said that some his oppo
nents argue that normal citizens
should be willing to sacrifice some of
their civil liberties in the name of the
wartime effort, in light of the larger
sacrifices made by military person
nel. Stone countered this theory by
pointing out the importance of free
dom of speech in discussing and in
fluencing governmental policies.
"Freedom of speech is not only
an individual freedom," Stone said.
"It is essential to the functioning of
government."
Stone said that the government is

currently infringing on many civil
liberties in the name of the war on
terrorism. He cited the Patriot Act,
the treatment of Guantanamo Bay
detainees and the "unprecedented
degree of secrecy" given to govern
mental proceedings.
The historical examples Stone pro
posed to support his theory extended
all the way back to the late 1700s,
when the U.S. Congress passed the
Sedition Act to limit opposition.
During World War I, the govern
ment convicted 2,000 people under
the Espionage Act of 1917 and Sedi
tion Act of 1918, both of which Stone
said allowed the government to im
pose fines and jail time on those who
influenced people not to enlist or
who spoke out against the govern
ment in any way.
Stone also drew examples from
the arrests during the Cold War and
resulting red scare, as well as from
the FBl's proceedings during the
Vietnam War.

Speaker discusses
historical lessons

Stone said that although civil lib
erties were sacrificed in these times
of crisis, the government later apolo
gized for the overreaction and re
stored the rights to the citizens.
"There's lots of information that
was gained after the fact that wasn't
publicly released or known at the
time," Stone said.
"I think [the historical evidence)
is a good reminder of the importance
of civil liberties in the context of per
ceived social crisis," said Eric Sapp, a
community member who attended
the speech. "It's important to re
member that the U.S. does have a
history of undermining free speech."
"This is a lot to take in, and most
of us do not think very much about
history on a day-to-day basis," said
Jefferson Schier, an alumnus of the
Law School. "If we do think about it,
we think in terms of five or 10 years
ago. Listening to the mistakes of the
past, one would hope that we will not
repeat them all in the future."
