# Rookie quartet adds depth to Cardinal
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Their athletic ability and poise
on the court make them a night
mare to defend. Their all-out ef
fort and love for the game make
them a pleasure to watch.
Seeing freshmen Cissy Pierce
and Candice Wiggins clown
around after practice, you might
think the two were lifelong
friends. Watching Pierce fly off a
screen to take a Wiggins pass and
knock down a 15-foot jumper, you
might suspect they had been team
mates since they first learned to
dribble. On both counts, you'd be
right... sort of.
When the two arrived at the
Farm this fall, it was not the first
time they had played together.
Having already committed to at
tend Stanford in the fall, Wiggins,
a native of San Diego, Calif., and
Pierce, from Littleton, Colo.,
teamed up as McDonald's Ail-
Americans in the spring.
"[Playing together on the West
team | was awesome," Wiggins
said. "There's definitely a sense of
pride knowing that for the next
four years you're going to be play
ing with that person, trying to help
a program win."
As for being friends. Pierce and
Wiggins, along with fellow fresh
men Jessica Elway and Christy
Titchenal, are already more than
that. From the way they work to
gether on the court to the way they
socialize off it, it's clear that they
are the playful younger siblings in
a tight-knit family.
"They're typical freshmen, just
taking everything in," senior Kel
ley Suminski said. "It's really fun
to see them interact with the
coaches. I think they're having a
really good freshman year."

With their skill and athleticism,
these four make up a very promis
ing incoming class that comple
ments the experience of Stan
ford's five seniors. For much of the
preseason, VanDerveer has com
mented on the difference between
this year's Cardinal and her
squads of the past.
"With our overall speed, I think
we'll be able to run the floor more,
be more aggressive defensively, be
more disruptive to other teams,"
VanDerveer said. "On some
teams that we've had, I think
we've been more conservative."
What will this mean for Stan
ford as it tries to defend to its Pa
cific-10 Conference champi
onship? There will be options.
VanDerveer couldn't be happi
er that her team will be one of the
deepest in the country this year.
She expects to show opponents as
many as 10 or 11 players per game,
and Pierce and Wiggins will certain
ly play a large part in that strategy.
"(In the past) we've had one
person we didn't want to get in
foul trouble and counted on to
play a lot of minutes," Van-
Derveer said. "I think we can be a
more risk-taking team."
The youngsters, for their part,
relish the opportunity to play a
prominent role and compete
against the best in country.
"It's a learning experience,"
Pierce said. "If we aren't playing
well, our seniors have a lot of
great experience, and if our se
niors aren't playing well, then we
can step up and help."
I'hus far, the freshmen have
certainly had the chance to show
what they can do. Wiggins, Cali
fornia's Ms. Basketball for 2004,
has started both exhibition games
and will start Friday's season
opener at guard in place of injured

senior Susan King Borchardt.
In her 53 combined minutes of
playing time, fans have begun to
understand what VanDerveer al
ready knew:
"She brings high energy all the
time," Suminski said. "She's al
ways going hard and strong."
in her first two contests, Wiggins
excelled in the "effort" categories.
Playing tenacious defense, she col
lected four steals last weekend and
created loose balls for teammates.
On the boards, she pulled down an
impressive 13 rebounds.
Pierce, on the other hand, has
contributed excellent minutes off
the bench for VanDerveer. In the
Cardinal's rotation-happy scheme,
which VanDerveer calls a "tag
team" approach. Pierce scored six
points and grabbed three rebounds
in just 13 minutes last Sunday.
On a team full of great athletes,
Colorado's Gatorade Player of the
Year for 2(X)4 draws special praise
for her physical gifts.
"Cissy definitely does things no
other human being can do," Wig
gins said, grinning at her team
mate. "It's the things, like her ath
leticism, that you can't teach."
- - Each player's role may expand
over the course of the season, as
the Cardinal will work in some
three-guard sets to take advantage
of their depth and individual
strengths. The team's new "trian
gle" offense, too, should provide
both players with ample opportu
nity to succeed.
"It's a good offense for us be
cause we're so deep," Wiggins
said. After working on it over the
summer, "I really got to under
stand the triangle. It's fun, and
everyone gets equal opportunity."
Despite playing different games
and having individual strengths,
VanDerveer sums up Wiggins' and

Pierce's most important attribute
in one word: confidence.
"(They have) a confidence in
their own game — not a cocki
ness, but a confidence — and
they're able to take very pointed
criticism," VanDerveer said. "A
lot of times you have to sugarcoat
things for freshmen, but it's great
that they're mature and secure

enough in their own games that
they can take [criticism]."
While the jury won't reach a ver
dict on this freshman class for anoth
er four years, it seems Stanford's se
nior class has little to worry about
after they leave. These players will
be frustrating opponents and de
lighting Cardinal fans for quite a
while.
