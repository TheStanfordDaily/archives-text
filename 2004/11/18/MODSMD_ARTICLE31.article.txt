Pacific-10 Conference women's basket
ball isn't just looming over the horizon â€”
it's knocking on the door. And this season
should provide more competitive play, high
emotions and enthralling storylines that
have become synonymous with the confer
ence.
With most records still unblemished,
each team has high hopes, some more realis
tic than others, for taking the conference
crown. Here's a quick look around the
league, listed in order of their predicted fin
ish by the Preseason Media Poll.
No. 7 Stanford Cardinal
<27-7,14-4 Pac-10/T-lst)
Ranked No. 7 in the preseason polls, the
Cardinal look to repeat last year's success
and carry themselves even deeper into this
postseason this year. Returning for the Car
dinal are guards Susan King Borchardt and
Kelley Suminski and forward T'Nae Thiel.
Stanford lost its star player from last year.

2003-04 Pac-10 Player of the Year Nicole
Powell.
Stanford finished last season with a 27-7
record, a Top 10 ranking, an Elite Eight ap
pearance, its third straight Pac-10 title and
second straight Pac-10 Tournament title.
Needless to say, the expectations for this
year are high.
The Cardinal welcome a strong fresh
man class, including Jessica Elway and Mc-
Donald's All-Americans Candice Wiggins
and Cissy Pierce. Stanford is expected to
win at least a share of the conference title
this year.
No. 24 Arizona Wildcats
<24-9,14-4 Pac-10/T-lst)
One of the few teams to have already
begun play, the Wildcats have not disap
pointed, winning their first two games of the
season.
After making it to the NCAA Tourna
ment for the second year in a row, Arizona
returns four of five starters, including cen
ter Shawntinice Polk and All-Pac-10 point
guard Dee-Dee Wheeler. Both players

have been named preseason candidates for
the Wade Trophy, given to the Division I
player of the year. Polk, a junior, has aver
aged a double-double in each of her two
seasons as a Wildcat, while Wheeler led the
team in scoring last year.
Arizona also brings in a strong freshman
class headlined by forward Chari Smith and
Tucson native guard Jessica Arnold. Both
players are expected to make immediate
impacts on the team.
Although the Wildcats have a challeng
ing schedule, including games against eight
of last year's postseason participants, look
for Arizona to finish towards the front of
the pack again.
UCLA Bruins
(17-13,11-7 Pac-10/T-3rd)
The Bruins welcome back three starters
from last year's team, which advanced to
the NCAA tournament. The Bruins will be
led by those veterans: Nikki Blue, a first
team all-conference guard, Pac-10 Fresh
man of the Year Noelle Quinn and honor
able mention all-conference player Lisa

Willis. The trio averaged over 45 points per
game last season, along with 18.7 rebounds,
8.4 steals, and 10.2 assists.
The Bruins hope to maintain their status
as a tough defensive team after ranking sev
enth nationally in steals per game last year.
Freshman Lindsey Pluimer headlines the
incoming freshman class. Pluimer, a 6-foot
-3 forward from San Clemente, Calif., aver
aged almost 25 points a game in high school
and was named a McDonald's and Parade
All-American.
Arizona State Sun Devils
(17-12,11-7 Pac-10/T-3rd)
The Sun Devils return all five of their
starters from last year, including senior
guard and All Pac-10 selection Kylan Loney.
Loney led the team in assists and three-point
shooting last year. Fellow senior guards Car
rie Buckner and Betsy Boardman, with 54
and 44 steals, respectively, last year, lead the
Arizona State defense.
The Sun Devils lost to No. 3 LSU 65-54
