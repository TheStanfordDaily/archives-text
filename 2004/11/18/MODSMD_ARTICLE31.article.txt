### ANTARDEB GUHARAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Pacific-10 Conference women's basket
ball isn't just looming over the horizon —
it's knocking on the door. And this season
should provide more competitive play, high
emotions and enthralling storylines that
have become synonymous with the confer
ence.
With most records still unblemished,
each team has high hopes, some more realis
tic than others, for taking the conference
crown. Here's a quick look around the
league, listed in order of their predicted fin
ish by the Preseason Media Poll.
No. 7 Stanford Cardinal
<27-7,14-4 Pac-10/T-lst)
Ranked No. 7 in the preseason polls, the
Cardinal look to repeat last year's success
and carry themselves even deeper into this
postseason this year. Returning for the Car
dinal are guards Susan King Borchardt and
Kelley Suminski and forward T'Nae Thiel.
Stanford lost its star player from last year.

2003-04 Pac-10 Player of the Year Nicole
Powell.
Stanford finished last season with a 27-7
record, a Top 10 ranking, an Elite Eight ap
pearance, its third straight Pac-10 title and
second straight Pac-10 Tournament title.
Needless to say, the expectations for this
year are high.
The Cardinal welcome a strong fresh
man class, including Jessica Elway and Mc-
Donald's All-Americans Candice Wiggins
and Cissy Pierce. Stanford is expected to
win at least a share of the conference title
this year.
No. 24 Arizona Wildcats
<24-9,14-4 Pac-10/T-lst)
One of the few teams to have already
begun play, the Wildcats have not disap
pointed, winning their first two games of the
season.
After making it to the NCAA Tourna
ment for the second year in a row, Arizona
returns four of five starters, including cen
ter Shawntinice Polk and All-Pac-10 point
guard Dee-Dee Wheeler. Both players

have been named preseason candidates for
the Wade Trophy, given to the Division I
player of the year. Polk, a junior, has aver
aged a double-double in each of her two
seasons as a Wildcat, while Wheeler led the
team in scoring last year.
Arizona also brings in a strong freshman
class headlined by forward Chari Smith and
Tucson native guard Jessica Arnold. Both
players are expected to make immediate
impacts on the team.
Although the Wildcats have a challeng
ing schedule, including games against eight
of last year's postseason participants, look
for Arizona to finish towards the front of
the pack again.
UCLA Bruins
(17-13,11-7 Pac-10/T-3rd)
The Bruins welcome back three starters
from last year's team, which advanced to
the NCAA tournament. The Bruins will be

able mention all-conference player Lisa

Willis. The trio averaged over 45 points per
game last season, along with 18.7 rebounds,
8.4 steals, and 10.2 assists.

as a tough defensive team after ranking sev
enth nationally in steals per game last year.

defensive weapon in Cathrine
Kraayeveld. a 6-foot-4 senior forward.
Kraayeveld averaged 17.2 points and 8.6

and quick spin moves.
Washington Huskies
(18-13,9-9 Pac-10/6th)
The Huskies will be relying on youth to

youngest team in the conference. The
Huskies have gotten solid contributions

from their freshmen in their first two vic
tories of the season.
USC Trojans
<15-13,11-7 Pac-10/3rd-lie)
The Trojans welcome new head coach
Mark Trakh this season. In his 11 years as

foot-10 Brynn Cameron, a four-year letter
winner at Newbury Park High School in
Calif., where the guard set a school record
for both boys and girls with 1,754 career
points.

adjusting to their loss of veteran play and to
finish in the middle of the conference.

The Golden Bears are riding the mo
mentum of last year's strong finish and this
preseason's performance into this season.
The Bears return three senior starters,
guard Kristin Iwanaga and forwards Leigh
Gregory and Kiki Williams. Gregory led
the team in scoring, rebounding, steals,
blocks, and field goal percentage.

New Mexico Gatorade Player of the Year,
who will see time at the small forward and
off-guard spots this year.
Oregon Slate

first time since 1982 last year, but bid
farewell to three of the starters that helped
it achieve the feat.

40 points in a single game. She reached dou

Washington Slate Cougars
(6-22,2-16 Pac-10/lOth)
The Cougars enter the 2004-2005 season
with an experienced sophomore class and
with expectations of improvement from last

son Stephanie Singer, and Nikki Stratton.
The group played in 105 games last year,

nior transfers —Keisha Moore, Ariana
Scales and Crystal Blue — and two fresh
men, Jordan McCormick and Dani Mont
gomery. Montgomery was named second
team All-State in leading her team to the
Southern Oregon Conference Champi
onship. Washington State should improve,
but will likely still finish at the bottom of the
Pacific-10 Conference women's basket
ball isn't just looming over the horizon —
it's knocking on the door. And this season
should provide more competitive play, high

(17-12,11-7 Pac-10/T-3rd)
The Sun Devils return all five of their
starters from last year, including senior
guard and All Pac-10 selection Kylan Loney.
Loney led the team in assists and three-point
shooting last year. Fellow senior guards Car
rie Buckner and Betsy Boardman, with 54
and 44 steals, respectively, last year, lead the
Arizona State defense.
The Sun Devils lost to No. 3 LSU 65-54
last Saturday.
Oregon Ducks
<14-15,6-12 Pac-10/8lh)
The Ducks go into this season with a hand
ful of talented players that they hope will lead
them hack into the postseason for the first
time since winning the WNIT in 2(X)2.
The Ducks have a potent offensive and
defensive weapon in Cathrine
Kraayeveld. a 6-foot-4 senior forward.
Kraayeveld averaged 17.2 points and 8.6
rebounds a game last year before she was
lost to injury. Oregon's success will also
hinge on the performance of center An
drea Bills. Bills has developed into one of
the premier post players in the Pac-10.
with her arsenal of turnaround jumpers
and quick spin moves.
Washington Huskies
(18-13,9-9 Pac-10/6th)
The Huskies will be relying on youth to
carry them through the season. With only
three juniors and not a single senior on
the team, Washington is by far the
youngest team in the conference. The
Huskies have gotten solid contributions

from their freshmen in their first two vic
tories of the season.
USC Trojans
<15-13,11-7 Pac-10/3rd-lie)
The Trojans welcome new head coach
Mark Trakh this season. In his 11 years as
head women's basketball coach at Pepper
dine, Trakh guided his team into postseason
play each of the past six seasons and won
four conference titles. The Trojans hope
that he is the man to get their team "back on
Trakh."
USC lost four seniors and with them,
lost three-fourths of its scoring and re
bounding. Leading the way for the re
turnees are senior forward Rachel Wood
ward and senior center Kim Gipson. both
co-captains for 2004.
The freshman class is highlighted by 5-
foot-10 Brynn Cameron, a four-year letter
winner at Newbury Park High School in
Calif., where the guard set a school record
for both boys and girls with 1,754 career
points.
Look for the Trojans to have a tough time
adjusting to their loss of veteran play and to
finish in the middle of the conference.

California Golden Bears
(12-17,4-14 Pac-10/9th)
The Golden Bears are riding the mo
mentum of last year's strong finish and this
preseason's performance into this season.
The Bears return three senior starters,
guard Kristin Iwanaga and forwards Leigh
Gregory and Kiki Williams. Gregory led
the team in scoring, rebounding, steals,
blocks, and field goal percentage.
The Bears introduce a strong freshman
class highlighted by Brio Rode, a two-time
New Mexico Gatorade Player of the Year,
who will see time at the small forward and
off-guard spots this year.
Oregon Slate
(17-15,8-10 Pac-10/7th)
After graduating three starters from last
year's squad, the Beavers are in a bit of a
quandary heading into the 2004-05 season.
OSU won a pair of postseason games for the
first time since 1982 last year, but bid
farewell to three of the starters that helped
it achieve the feat.
The Beavers return starting guards
Shannon Howell and Mandy Close. Howell

Trakh takes over as USC head coach

was the first OSU player since 1996 to score
40 points in a single game. She reached dou
ble figures in scoring in 15 games, and
scored 20 or more on seven occasions. OSU
brings in freshmen Tiffany Ducker and
Claire Pallansch to add athleticism and re
bounding to its post play.
Washington Slate Cougars
(6-22,2-16 Pac-10/lOth)
The Cougars enter the 2004-2005 season
with an experienced sophomore class and
with expectations of improvement from last
year's abysmal 6-22 overall record. The
quartet of returning freshmen include for
ward Kate Benz and guards Adriane Fergu
son Stephanie Singer, and Nikki Stratton.
The group played in 105 games last year,
collecting 62 starts.
The newcomer class includes three ju
nior transfers —Keisha Moore, Ariana
Scales and Crystal Blue — and two fresh
men, Jordan McCormick and Dani Mont
gomery. Montgomery was named second
team All-State in leading her team to the
Southern Oregon Conference Champi
onship. Washington State should improve,
but will likely still finish at the bottom of the
