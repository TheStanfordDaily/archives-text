# No. 7 women aim for Final Four
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Want a sign of a great college
athletics program? You graduate
arguably the best player in the
country, and you come back as a
better team the next year.
When Nicole Powell was
drafted by the WNBA's Char
lotte Sting after last season, she
took with her a truckload of
hardware and a lofty spot on
nearly every page of the Stanford
record book. The Cardinal's
leader in career rebounds and the
program's first three-time Kodak
All-American is certainly diffi
cult to replace.
Nonetheless, No. 7 Stanford
begins the season tomorrow with
good reason to believe that the
long road ahead will end in April
and Indianapolis, lnd. There, the
Cardinal hope to enjoy some
Midwestern hospitality and their
first Final Four appearance since
1997.
"I'm really happy with how
hard everyone is working and the
cohesiveness of the team on the
floor," said head coach Tara Van-

Derveer. now in her 19th season at
the Farm. "I think this is one of the
most competitive teams we've
ever had."
Few teams in the nation figure
to have stronger veteran leader
ship than the Cardinal this year.
Stanford returns five seniors this
season, including guard Kelley
Suminski, who was nominated to
the preseason watch list for the
John R. Wooden Award, given
each year to the top player in col
lege basketball.
In addition to Suminski,
T'Nae Thiel, Azella Perryman,
and Sebnem Kimayacioglu re
turn at the forward position,
while fifth-year senior Susan
King Borchardt will start once
again at guard.
Each of Stanford's returning
seniors averaged better than five
points per game a year ago and
will look to fill the scoring void
left by departed seniors Powell
and Chelsea Trotter. Further
more, the team's veterans will
work to keep the team focused
and playing hard throughout the
season.
"We've got a great senior

class," Perryman said. "We defi
nitely want to go out as a class
that's remembered not only for
what we brought to the stat sheet,
but what we did off the court as
well."
In addition to their strong and
experienced senior class, the Car
dinal receive an infusion of new
blood in the form of a promising
group of freshmen, headlined by
McDonald's All-Americans Cissy
Pierce and Candice Wiggins. Join
ing them are first-year players
Christy Titchenal and Jessica
Elway.
"They're all doing very well
because they have such positive
role models in the upperclass
men," VanDerveer said. "[Bor
chardt] and [Wiggins] go head
to-head and compete every day.
They're all excellent players, and
they're constantly being chal
lenged and mentored at the same
time."

The freshmen, for their part,
are working hard to adjust to a
new setting and new brand of
basketball.
"The game is so much more
physical and fast-paced," Pierce
said. "Every drill is fast-paced, and
everything moves faster than it did
in high school."
Many pundits have already
tabbed the Cardinal, with their
great blend of youth and experi
ence, to claim their fourth consec
utive Pacific-10 Conference regu
lar-season crown.
Yet the team itself isn't about
to give in and start making hotel
reservations for the postseason.
"Every single game the other
team's going to come out excited,
and we've got a target on our
back," Perryman said. "Every
body wants to beat us, so we've got
to make sure we go game by
game."
This year's Pac-10 schedule

will be demanding, highlighted
by contests with No. 24 Arizona
and an improved UCLA team.
"I think a lot of teams [in the Pac
10] are good this year," VanDerveer
said. "We don't get the respect na
tionally that 1 think we deserve, but
that's not going to change, so we just
have to keep [playing well in the
NCAA Tournament]."
Stanford's tough non-confer
ence schedule will present both
challenges and opportunities for
the team, as it will face off against
No. 1 Tennessee in Knoxville and
No. 9 Texas Tech and No. 18
Boston College at home.
"We're getting better every
day," Suminski said. "It's a great
atmosphere to play in, and our
depth is pretty amazing."
Expect the Cardinal to use
every bit of that depth this year,
and with a little luck, they might
just be shaking up Indianapolis
come spring.

Sophomore center Kristen Newlin averaged 11.5 points per game in the Car
dinal's two exhibition games. With the departure of 2003-04 leading scorer
Nicole Powell, Newlin will be relied upon to score more this season.
