# International relations: Stanford branches out
## Hennessy seeks to give the University an 'audience' in China, India and Spain. 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
During a trip to Beijing earlier this year.
University President John Hennessy ap
peared as a guest on Dialogue, a talk show
produced and aired by China Central Televi
sion. Invited to discuss academic matters, he
didn't expect the show to garner much interest
from viewers. Still, curious as to just how
many people were expected to tune in, Hen
nessy asked the host of the program what their
typical audience size was. The reply? Oh, just
about one billion.
Aside from Hennessy's visit to China, there
are many signs that Stanford is trying to in
crease its visibility around the world, from the
opening of a new Overseas Studies Program
center in Beijing this quarter to the possibility
of opening centers in Spain and India.
Top University administrators hope to forge
stronger relationships with nations of growing
importance, like China, at a time when nations
are becoming increasingly connected. Addi
tionally, they hope to develop an larger interest
in international study among Stanford stu
dents.
"The next generation is going to need to be
much more capable in international interac
tions, whether they're involved in business en
deavors or foreign policies," Hennessy said in
an interview with The Daily, specifically noting
Asia's growing importance. "We need to have
more students thinking about studying
abroad."
Though the show Dialogue often covers is
sues related to the growth and transformation
taking place in China, the fact that it is pro
duced by the national television station — in a
country that only recently shifted from central
planning and where anti-government views are
still often considered unpatriotic — is a con
stant reminder that the momentous changes
occurring in China are only just beginning.
"It's a fascinating experiment carrying out
right before our eyes, with regards to the rule of
law. democracy, cultural development." Hen
nessy said.

Sizing up Stanford's overseas programs
Stanford stands out among its peer institu
tions for the emphasis it has placed on its over
seas programs. According to OSP Director
Amos Nur, Harvard University is just begin
ning to implement an overseas program after
conducting a three-year study to evaluate the
value of such a program. The University of Cal
ifornia system sends three to four percent of its
students abroad — a large number considering
the size of its student population — but Stan
ford sends 10 times more students percentage
wise, according to Nur.
"1 would say we're perceived in general as
pne of the top programs in the country because
we have our own faculty and staff participate,"
Nur added.
The Beijing center opened this fall in collab
oration with Peking University, one of the top
universities in China. OSP is also exploring the
possibility of opening centers in India and
Spain.
Nur said a large number of students have
shown interest in studying in Spain, and that a
program in India would be beneficial for stu
dents for some of the same reasons a program
China is — because of its rich culture and his
tory and its growing economic and political im
portance.
"I just came back from India two days ago
— it looks like it's doable," Nur said. "Person
ally, I'm convinced that it could be a great
learning experience. It could be really life

changing to spend time in India."
Hennessy will also be traveling to
India in a matter of weeks, both to
visit alumni and to consider the pos
sibilities for opening an OSP center
there.
Kxainining the demographics
Five percent of the permanent
undergraduate students and 30 per
cent of graduate students are inter
national students. The majority
study science or engineering, accord
ing to John Pearson, the director of
Bechtel International Center.
The student body includes stu
dents from six continents, according
to Associate Director of Admission
Anna Takahashi, who coordinates
admission efforts for international
students.
Due to costs, international re
cruiting efforts are not as extensive
as domestic recruiting, Takahashi
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Takahashi said staff from the ad
missions office traveled to Canada
and Mexico this fall to introduce the
University to prospective students
from those countries, and that the of
fice staff hopes to increase the
amount of international traveling its
staff does in the future.
"International students are at
tracted to Stanford for the same rea
sons that students from the U.S. are
attracted to Stanford." Takahashi
said. "Stanford stands out around
the world for its breadth of excel
lences, strong focus on undergradu
ate education and research and com
mitment to innovative interdiscipli
nary study."
Even so. there are specific demo
graphic trends among students ad
mitted from overseas.
"If you look 30 years ago we had
very few students from China —
now China is the number-one coun
try represented at Stanford," Pear
son said. "A lot depends of global
politics and economics."
With a shift toward a market
economy and a rapidly changing atti
tude toward modes of communica
tion. everything from politics to
everyday lifestyles is evolving in
China. For instance, China's urban
population is expected to double in
the coming decades.
And. although the government
systematically monitors all content
made available through the Internet,
the number of people using the In
ternet in China is increasing rapidly.
"Ten or fifteen years ago. infor
mation flow was limited," Nur said.
"Today, the whole [Peking Universi
ty] campus is covered by wireless
and students can access anywhere,
worldwide. There's hardly any
blocking of anything."

The rise of technological industry
is having tremendous impacts in
India as well.
According to the International
Data Corporation, a market re
search firm that specializes in infor
mation technology and telecommu
nications, India is expected to have
the highest growth rate among Asia-
Pacific countries in e-commerce rev
enues between 2003 and 2008. even
exceeding China's growth rate.
Reaching out in foreign countries
Nur said there are many reasons
to have an OSP center in India in ad
dition to its growing economic rele
vance.
"First of all. about 16 percent of
mankind lives there," Nur said. "The
culture and way of life are really dif
ferent from what we are used to here
in the West. The mixing of wealth
and poverty in itself is something to
see — they manage things much dif
ferently than we do.
"It's the largest democracy on
earth, and it kind of works," he said.
"The religions are so different than
anything we know and believe in the
West. To compare and to under
stand how such differences repre
sent the way humans think would be
a tremendous benefit."
Hennessy said that with further
outreach to countries like China and
India, current and future Stanford
alumni in those places could play a
more active role in educating stu
dents and assisting them in their ca
reer aspirations.
"We have alumni in China who
are playing a role in shaping China,"
Hennessy said. "We take advantage
of alumni in Washington to illumi
nate to students the complexity of
our government and how it operates,
and we'd like to see the same thing in
China."
Stanford has 45 international
alumni clubs that host social and in
tellectual events for alumni.
"Most people in Hong Kong have
heard of Stanford, and increasingly
in professional circles in China as
well," said Hong Kong Alumni Club
President Karin Ann. who received
her bachelor's degree in 1990 and
her master's degree in 1991. "I think
our profile has been raised by Stan
ford's center in Beijing as well. I
would say that Stanford continues to
be perceived as one of the top uni
versities in the U.S.. but the overall
impression would still be that Har
vard has the highest profile."
China's economic growth has fa
cilitated improvements in the coun
try's educational institutions.
In fact, Hennessy said, just last
week, representatives from Chinese
universities visited Stanford to dis-

Hennessy: foreign alumni
could play a more active role

cuss how to structure their under
graduate and graduate programs.
They discussed how to manage
everything from finance, research
and intellectual property rights to
curriculum — "a whole range of
things they're just beginning to grap
ple with now," Hennessy said.
Why are fewer foreign students
applying?
The improved quality of higher
education in other countries could
affect the number of foreign stu
dents interested in studying at Stan
lord.
The United States registered a 2.4
percent decline in foreign enroll
ment in the fall of 2003 — the first
decline since according to the
Institute of International Education.
Additionally, the Council of Gradu
ate Schools concluded that the num
ber of graduate school applications
from Chinese students fell 45 per
cent from last fall among its member
institutions. Applications from Indi
an students fell 28 percent.
At Stanford, the percent of inter
national students in the overall stu
dent population has not changed sig
nificantly in the last few years, ac
cording to Pearson, of the Bechtel
International Center, although the
number of international applications
has declined by around 4 percent
over the last two years.
Some educational experts have
attributed the declines to the in
creased difficulties students have
faced in applying for visas since Sept.
11.2001.
The improved quality of foreign
institutions, though, has also been
listed as a reason for the declining in
terest in American institutions from
international students.
"As the quality of their institu
tions improves, some students will
opt to stay there," Hennessy said.
"At the same time, there will be
more students looking to go abroad.
For higher education in China, this is
an interesting time. The demand is
growing by leaps and bounds as peo
ple change from traditional careers
to careers that require [higher edu
cation)."
Both Pearson and Hennessy said
the institutional changes occurring
in Asia and elsewhere will not lessen
Stanford's appeal, and that the Uni
versity's image will continue to im
prove internationally.
"Certainly, 1 think we'd like to
be known as a high-quality institu
tion known for our research and
teaching," Hennessy said. "It's
quite important not to be seen as
isolationist."

"The next generation is going to need to be
much more capable in international interac
tions, whether they're involved in business en
deavors or foreign policies," Hennessy said in
an interview with The Daily, specifically noting
Asia's growing importance. "We need to have
more students thinking about studying
abroad."
Though the show Dialogue often covers is
sues related to the growth and transformation
taking place in China, the fact that it is pro
duced by the national television station — in a
country that only recently shifted from central
planning and where anti-government views are
still often considered unpatriotic — is a con
stant reminder that the momentous changes
occurring in China are only just beginning.
"It's a fascinating experiment carrying out
right before our eyes, with regards to the rule of
law. democracy, cultural development." Hen
nessy said.

Sizing up Stanford's overseas programs
Stanford stands out among its peer institu
tions for the emphasis it has placed on its over
seas programs. According to OSP Director
Amos Nur, Harvard University is just begin
ning to implement an overseas program after
conducting a three-year study to evaluate the
value of such a program. The University of Cal
ifornia system sends three to four percent of its
students abroad — a large number considering
the size of its student population — but Stan
ford sends 10 times more students percentage
wise, according to Nur.
"1 would say we're perceived in general as
pne of the top programs in the country because
we have our own faculty and staff participate,"
Nur added.
The Beijing center opened this fall in collab
oration with Peking University, one of the top
universities in China. OSP is also exploring the
possibility of opening centers in India and
Spain.
Nur said a large number of students have
shown interest in studying in Spain, and that a
program in India would be beneficial for stu
dents for some of the same reasons a program
China is — because of its rich culture and his
tory and its growing economic and political im
portance.
"I just came back from India two days ago
— it looks like it's doable," Nur said. "Person
ally, I'm convinced that it could be a great
learning experience. It could be really life

changing to spend time in India."
Hennessy will also be traveling to
India in a matter of weeks, both to
visit alumni and to consider the pos
sibilities for opening an OSP center
there.
Kxainining the demographics
Five percent of the permanent
undergraduate students and 30 per
cent of graduate students are inter
national students. The majority
study science or engineering, accord
ing to John Pearson, the director of
Bechtel International Center.
The student body includes stu
dents from six continents, according
to Associate Director of Admission
Anna Takahashi, who coordinates
admission efforts for international
students.
Due to costs, international re
cruiting efforts are not as extensive
as domestic recruiting, Takahashi
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Takahashi said staff from the ad
missions office traveled to Canada
and Mexico this fall to introduce the
University to prospective students
from those countries, and that the of
fice staff hopes to increase the
amount of international traveling its
staff does in the future.
"International students are at
tracted to Stanford for the same rea
sons that students from the U.S. are
attracted to Stanford." Takahashi
said. "Stanford stands out around
the world for its breadth of excel
lences, strong focus on undergradu
ate education and research and com
mitment to innovative interdiscipli
nary study."
Even so. there are specific demo
graphic trends among students ad
mitted from overseas.
"If you look 30 years ago we had
very few students from China —
now China is the number-one coun
try represented at Stanford," Pear
son said. "A lot depends of global
politics and economics."
With a shift toward a market
economy and a rapidly changing atti
tude toward modes of communica
tion. everything from politics to
everyday lifestyles is evolving in
China. For instance, China's urban
population is expected to double in
the coming decades.
And. although the government
systematically monitors all content
made available through the Internet,
the number of people using the In
ternet in China is increasing rapidly.
"Ten or fifteen years ago. infor
mation flow was limited," Nur said.
"Today, the whole [Peking Universi
ty] campus is covered by wireless
and students can access anywhere,
worldwide. There's hardly any
blocking of anything."

The rise of technological industry
is having tremendous impacts in
India as well.
According to the International
Data Corporation, a market re
search firm that specializes in infor
mation technology and telecommu
nications, India is expected to have
the highest growth rate among Asia-
Pacific countries in e-commerce rev
enues between 2003 and 2008. even
exceeding China's growth rate.
Reaching out in foreign countries
Nur said there are many reasons
to have an OSP center in India in ad
dition to its growing economic rele
vance.
"First of all. about 16 percent of
mankind lives there," Nur said. "The
culture and way of life are really dif
ferent from what we are used to here
in the West. The mixing of wealth
and poverty in itself is something to
see — they manage things much dif
ferently than we do.
"It's the largest democracy on
earth, and it kind of works," he said.
"The religions are so different than
anything we know and believe in the
West. To compare and to under
stand how such differences repre
sent the way humans think would be
a tremendous benefit."
Hennessy said that with further
outreach to countries like China and
India, current and future Stanford
alumni in those places could play a
more active role in educating stu
dents and assisting them in their ca
reer aspirations.
"We have alumni in China who
are playing a role in shaping China,"
Hennessy said. "We take advantage
of alumni in Washington to illumi
nate to students the complexity of
our government and how it operates,
and we'd like to see the same thing in
China."
Stanford has 45 international
alumni clubs that host social and in
tellectual events for alumni.
"Most people in Hong Kong have
heard of Stanford, and increasingly
in professional circles in China as
well," said Hong Kong Alumni Club
President Karin Ann. who received
her bachelor's degree in 1990 and
her master's degree in 1991. "I think
our profile has been raised by Stan
ford's center in Beijing as well. I
would say that Stanford continues to
be perceived as one of the top uni
versities in the U.S.. but the overall
impression would still be that Har
vard has the highest profile."
China's economic growth has fa
cilitated improvements in the coun
try's educational institutions.
In fact, Hennessy said, just last
week, representatives from Chinese
universities visited Stanford to dis-

Hennessy: foreign alumni
could play a more active role

cuss how to structure their under
graduate and graduate programs.
They discussed how to manage
everything from finance, research
and intellectual property rights to
curriculum — "a whole range of
things they're just beginning to grap
ple with now," Hennessy said.
Why are fewer foreign students
applying?
The improved quality of higher
education in other countries could
affect the number of foreign stu
dents interested in studying at Stan
lord.
The United States registered a 2.4
percent decline in foreign enroll
ment in the fall of 2003 — the first
decline since according to the
Institute of International Education.
Additionally, the Council of Gradu
ate Schools concluded that the num
ber of graduate school applications
from Chinese students fell 45 per
cent from last fall among its member
institutions. Applications from Indi
an students fell 28 percent.
At Stanford, the percent of inter
national students in the overall stu
dent population has not changed sig
nificantly in the last few years, ac
cording to Pearson, of the Bechtel
International Center, although the
number of international applications
has declined by around 4 percent
over the last two years.
Some educational experts have
attributed the declines to the in
creased difficulties students have
faced in applying for visas since Sept.
11.2001.
The improved quality of foreign
institutions, though, has also been
listed as a reason for the declining in
terest in American institutions from
international students.
"As the quality of their institu
tions improves, some students will
opt to stay there," Hennessy said.
"At the same time, there will be
more students looking to go abroad.
For higher education in China, this is
an interesting time. The demand is
growing by leaps and bounds as peo
ple change from traditional careers
to careers that require [higher edu
cation)."
Both Pearson and Hennessy said
the institutional changes occurring
in Asia and elsewhere will not lessen
Stanford's appeal, and that the Uni
versity's image will continue to im
prove internationally.
"Certainly, 1 think we'd like to
be known as a high-quality institu
tion known for our research and
teaching," Hennessy said. "It's
quite important not to be seen as
isolationist."
During a trip to Beijing earlier this year.
University President John Hennessy ap
peared as a guest on Dialogue, a talk show
produced and aired by China Central Televi
sion. Invited to discuss academic matters, he
didn't expect the show to garner much interest
from viewers. Still, curious as to just how
many people were expected to tune in, Hen
nessy asked the host of the program what their
typical audience size was. The reply? Oh, just
about one billion.
Aside from Hennessy's visit to China, there
are many signs that Stanford is trying to in
crease its visibility around the world, from the
opening of a new Overseas Studies Program
center in Beijing this quarter to the possibility
of opening centers in Spain and India.
Top University administrators hope to forge
stronger relationships with nations of growing
importance, like China, at a time when nations
are becoming increasingly connected. Addi
tionally, they hope to develop an larger interest
in international study among Stanford stu
dents.
"The next generation is going to need to be
much more capable in international interac

conducting a three-year study to evaluate the
value of such a program. The University of Cal
ifornia system sends three to four percent of its
students abroad — a large number considering
the size of its student population — but Stan
ford sends 10 times more students percentage
wise, according to Nur.
"1 would say we're perceived in general as
pne of the top programs in the country because
we have our own faculty and staff participate,"
Nur added.
The Beijing center opened this fall in collab
oration with Peking University, one of the top
universities in China. OSP is also exploring the
possibility of opening centers in India and
Spain.
Nur said a large number of students have
shown interest in studying in Spain, and that a
program in India would be beneficial for stu
dents for some of the same reasons a program
China is — because of its rich culture and his
tory and its growing economic and political im
portance.
"I just came back from India two days ago
— it looks like it's doable," Nur said. "Person
ally, I'm convinced that it could be a great
learning experience. It could be really life

changing to spend time in India."
Hennessy will also be traveling to
India in a matter of weeks, both to
visit alumni and to consider the pos
sibilities for opening an OSP center
there.
Kxainining the demographics
Five percent of the permanent
undergraduate students and 30 per
cent of graduate students are inter
national students. The majority
study science or engineering, accord
ing to John Pearson, the director of
Bechtel International Center.
The student body includes stu
dents from six continents, according
to Associate Director of Admission
Anna Takahashi, who coordinates
admission efforts for international
students.
Due to costs, international re
cruiting efforts are not as extensive
as domestic recruiting, Takahashi
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Takahashi said staff from the ad
missions office traveled to Canada
and Mexico this fall to introduce the
University to prospective students
from those countries, and that the of
fice staff hopes to increase the
amount of international traveling its
staff does in the future.
"International students are at
tracted to Stanford for the same rea
sons that students from the U.S. are
attracted to Stanford." Takahashi
said. "Stanford stands out around
the world for its breadth of excel
lences, strong focus on undergradu
ate education and research and com
mitment to innovative interdiscipli
nary study."
Even so. there are specific demo
graphic trends among students ad
mitted from overseas.
"If you look 30 years ago we had
very few students from China —
now China is the number-one coun
try represented at Stanford," Pear
son said. "A lot depends of global
politics and economics."
With a shift toward a market
economy and a rapidly changing atti
tude toward modes of communica
tion. everything from politics to
everyday lifestyles is evolving in
China. For instance, China's urban
population is expected to double in
the coming decades.
And. although the government
systematically monitors all content
made available through the Internet,
the number of people using the In
ternet in China is increasing rapidly.
"Ten or fifteen years ago. infor
mation flow was limited," Nur said.
"Today, the whole [Peking Universi
ty] campus is covered by wireless
and students can access anywhere,
worldwide. There's hardly any
blocking of anything."

The rise of technological industry
is having tremendous impacts in
India as well.
According to the International
Data Corporation, a market re
search firm that specializes in infor
mation technology and telecommu
nications, India is expected to have
the highest growth rate among Asia-
Pacific countries in e-commerce rev
enues between 2003 and 2008. even
exceeding China's growth rate.
Reaching out in foreign countries
Nur said there are many reasons
to have an OSP center in India in ad
dition to its growing economic rele
vance.
"First of all. about 16 percent of
mankind lives there," Nur said. "The
culture and way of life are really dif
ferent from what we are used to here
in the West. The mixing of wealth
and poverty in itself is something to
see — they manage things much dif
ferently than we do.
"It's the largest democracy on
earth, and it kind of works," he said.
"The religions are so different than
anything we know and believe in the
West. To compare and to under
stand how such differences repre
sent the way humans think would be
a tremendous benefit."
Hennessy said that with further
outreach to countries like China and
India, current and future Stanford
alumni in those places could play a
more active role in educating stu
dents and assisting them in their ca
reer aspirations.
"We have alumni in China who
are playing a role in shaping China,"
Hennessy said. "We take advantage
of alumni in Washington to illumi
nate to students the complexity of
our government and how it operates,
and we'd like to see the same thing in
China."
Stanford has 45 international
alumni clubs that host social and in
tellectual events for alumni.
"Most people in Hong Kong have
heard of Stanford, and increasingly
in professional circles in China as
well," said Hong Kong Alumni Club
President Karin Ann. who received
her bachelor's degree in 1990 and
her master's degree in 1991. "I think
our profile has been raised by Stan
ford's center in Beijing as well. I
would say that Stanford continues to
be perceived as one of the top uni
versities in the U.S.. but the overall
impression would still be that Har
vard has the highest profile."
China's economic growth has fa
cilitated improvements in the coun
try's educational institutions.
In fact, Hennessy said, just last
week, representatives from Chinese
universities visited Stanford to dis-

could play a more active role

cuss how to structure their under
graduate and graduate programs.
They discussed how to manage
everything from finance, research
and intellectual property rights to
curriculum — "a whole range of
things they're just beginning to grap
ple with now," Hennessy said.
Why are fewer foreign students
applying?
The improved quality of higher
education in other countries could
affect the number of foreign stu
dents interested in studying at Stan
lord.
The United States registered a 2.4
percent decline in foreign enroll
ment in the fall of 2003 — the first
decline since according to the
Institute of International Education.
Additionally, the Council of Gradu
ate Schools concluded that the num
ber of graduate school applications
from Chinese students fell 45 per
cent from last fall among its member
institutions. Applications from Indi
an students fell 28 percent.
At Stanford, the percent of inter
national students in the overall stu
dent population has not changed sig
nificantly in the last few years, ac
cording to Pearson, of the Bechtel
International Center, although the
number of international applications
has declined by around 4 percent
over the last two years.
Some educational experts have
attributed the declines to the in
creased difficulties students have
faced in applying for visas since Sept.
11.2001.
The improved quality of foreign
institutions, though, has also been
listed as a reason for the declining in
terest in American institutions from
international students.
"As the quality of their institu
tions improves, some students will
opt to stay there," Hennessy said.
"At the same time, there will be
more students looking to go abroad.
For higher education in China, this is
an interesting time. The demand is
growing by leaps and bounds as peo
ple change from traditional careers
to careers that require [higher edu
cation)."
Both Pearson and Hennessy said
the institutional changes occurring
in Asia and elsewhere will not lessen
Stanford's appeal, and that the Uni
versity's image will continue to im
prove internationally.
"Certainly, 1 think we'd like to
be known as a high-quality institu
tion known for our research and
teaching," Hennessy said. "It's
quite important not to be seen as
isolationist."
During a trip to Beijing earlier this year.
University President John Hennessy ap
peared as a guest on Dialogue, a talk show
produced and aired by China Central Televi
sion. Invited to discuss academic matters, he
didn't expect the show to garner much interest
from viewers. Still, curious as to just how
many people were expected to tune in, Hen
nessy asked the host of the program what their
typical audience size was. The reply? Oh, just
about one billion.
Aside from Hennessy's visit to China, there
are many signs that Stanford is trying to in
crease its visibility around the world, from the
opening of a new Overseas Studies Program
center in Beijing this quarter to the possibility
of opening centers in Spain and India.
Top University administrators hope to forge
stronger relationships with nations of growing
importance, like China, at a time when nations
are becoming increasingly connected. Addi
tionally, they hope to develop an larger interest
in international study among Stanford stu
dents.
"The next generation is going to need to be
much more capable in international interac
tions, whether they're involved in business en
deavors or foreign policies," Hennessy said in
an interview with The Daily, specifically noting
Asia's growing importance. "We need to have
more students thinking about studying
abroad."
Though the show Dialogue often covers is
sues related to the growth and transformation
taking place in China, the fact that it is pro
duced by the national television station — in a
country that only recently shifted from central
planning and where anti-government views are
still often considered unpatriotic — is a con
stant reminder that the momentous changes
occurring in China are only just beginning.
"It's a fascinating experiment carrying out
right before our eyes, with regards to the rule of
law. democracy, cultural development." Hen
nessy said.

Sizing up Stanford's overseas programs
Stanford stands out among its peer institu
tions for the emphasis it has placed on its over
seas programs. According to OSP Director
Amos Nur, Harvard University is just begin

conducting a three-year study to evaluate the
value of such a program. The University of Cal
