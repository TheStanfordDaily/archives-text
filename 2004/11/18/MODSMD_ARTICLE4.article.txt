# International relations: Stanford branches out
## Hennessy seeks to give the University an 'audience' in China, India and Spain. 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
During a trip to Beijing earlier this year.
University President John Hennessy ap
peared as a guest on Dialogue, a talk show
produced and aired by China Central Televi
sion. Invited to discuss academic matters, he
didn't expect the show to garner much interest
from viewers. Still, curious as to just how
many people were expected to tune in, Hen
nessy asked the host of the program what their
typical audience size was. The reply? Oh, just
about one billion.
Aside from Hennessy's visit to China, there
are many signs that Stanford is trying to in
crease its visibility around the world, from the
opening of a new Overseas Studies Program
center in Beijing this quarter to the possibility
of opening centers in Spain and India.
Top University administrators hope to forge
stronger relationships with nations of growing
importance, like China, at a time when nations
are becoming increasingly connected. Addi
tionally, they hope to develop an larger interest
in international study among Stanford stu
dents.
"The next generation is going to need to be
much more capable in international interac
tions, whether they're involved in business en
deavors or foreign policies," Hennessy said in
an interview with The Daily, specifically noting
Asia's growing importance. "We need to have
more students thinking about studying
abroad."
Though the show Dialogue often covers is
sues related to the growth and transformation
taking place in China, the fact that it is pro
duced by the national television station — in a
country that only recently shifted from central
planning and where anti-government views are
still often considered unpatriotic — is a con
stant reminder that the momentous changes
occurring in China are only just beginning.
"It's a fascinating experiment carrying out
right before our eyes, with regards to the rule of
law. democracy, cultural development." Hen
nessy said.

Sizing up Stanford's overseas programs
Stanford stands out among its peer institu
tions for the emphasis it has placed on its over
seas programs. According to OSP Director
Amos Nur, Harvard University is just begin
ning to implement an overseas program after
conducting a three-year study to evaluate the
value of such a program. The University of Cal
ifornia system sends three to four percent of its
students abroad — a large number considering
the size of its student population — but Stan
ford sends 10 times more students percentage
wise, according to Nur.
"1 would say we're perceived in general as
pne of the top programs in the country because
we have our own faculty and staff participate,"
Nur added.
The Beijing center opened this fall in collab
oration with Peking University, one of the top
universities in China. OSP is also exploring the
possibility of opening centers in India and
Spain.
Nur said a large number of students have
shown interest in studying in Spain, and that a
program in India would be beneficial for stu
dents for some of the same reasons a program
China is — because of its rich culture and his
tory and its growing economic and political im
portance.
"I just came back from India two days ago
— it looks like it's doable," Nur said. "Person
ally, I'm convinced that it could be a great
learning experience. It could be really life
