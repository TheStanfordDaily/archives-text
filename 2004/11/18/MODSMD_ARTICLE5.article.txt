# Not paying ITSS bills makes economic sense
## 
### MEGAN WATKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sophomore Sasha Filip
pova has stopped paying her
ITSS bills regularly this
year, hut she has yet to suf
fer any repercussions from
her decision.
Filippova is one of a
growing number of students
who are realizing that there
are few consequences for
missing monthly payments
for their telephone and in
ternet connections, long-dis
tance calls and cable televi

Economics Prof. David
Johnson, these students are

Neither Student Financial
Services nor Information
Technology Systems and

Services (ITSS) assigns financial
penalties to students who do not
pay their ITSS bills, and representa

they do not know who sets policy to

"It's annoying to have to pay a bill
every month, and with ITSS there's
no penalty, so why not just pay it
once a year?" she said. "I'm so sick
of getting those stupid pink en

inefficient system ever. Isn't the
raise in prices due to billing?"
Junior Nancy El-Sakkary avoids
her bills for purely practical reasons.
"I don't pay them because I don't
get charged if I don't," she said. "I

just pay them at the beginning of the
quarter. There is no point in leaving
your room every month to pay the
bill."
Fred Hansson, acting director of
finance for ITSS, said that his office
does not handle late payments â€”
the Bursar's Office handles all ITSS
fee collections.
"There is no financial penalty for
late payments," Hansson said.
"There is an academic hold for the
very chronic non-payers. Student Fi
nancial Services does our collec
tions. If they feel a student is blowing
them off or not working with them in
good faith they will place a hold to
bring payments current or get their
