# Not paying ITSS bills makes economic sense
## 
### MEGAN WATKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sophomore Sasha Filip
pova has stopped paying her
ITSS bills regularly this
year, hut she has yet to suf
fer any repercussions from
her decision.
Filippova is one of a
growing number of students
who are realizing that there
are few consequences for
missing monthly payments
for their telephone and in
ternet connections, long-dis
tance calls and cable televi
sion services. According to
Economics Prof. David
Johnson, these students are
merely being economically
rational.
Neither Student Financial
Services nor Information
Technology Systems and

Services (ITSS) assigns financial
penalties to students who do not
pay their ITSS bills, and representa
tives from each organization say
they do not know who sets policy to
deal with these students.
Filippova said that skipping her
monthly payments is an act of
protest.
"It's annoying to have to pay a bill
every month, and with ITSS there's
no penalty, so why not just pay it
once a year?" she said. "I'm so sick
of getting those stupid pink en
velopes every month. It's the most
inefficient system ever. Isn't the
raise in prices due to billing?"
Junior Nancy El-Sakkary avoids
her bills for purely practical reasons.
"I don't pay them because I don't
get charged if I don't," she said. "I

just pay them at the beginning of the
quarter. There is no point in leaving
your room every month to pay the
bill."
Fred Hansson, acting director of
finance for ITSS, said that his office
does not handle late payments —
the Bursar's Office handles all ITSS
fee collections.
"There is no financial penalty for
late payments," Hansson said.
"There is an academic hold for the
very chronic non-payers. Student Fi
nancial Services does our collec
tions. If they feel a student is blowing
them off or not working with them in
good faith they will place a hold to
bring payments current or get their

However. Mansoor Rahman, reg
ulatory compliance officer for Stu
dent Financial Services, said that his
office does not place academic holds
on students who have a history of
not paying their hills. He said that
SFS only enforces late penalties for
"term-based charges" like tuition
and ASSU fees.
Hansson and Rahman both said
that their organizations do not set
policy on the matter.
William Clebsch. executive director
of strategic planning and acting direc
tor of engineering & projects for ITSS,
also said that ITSS does not make its
own policy for late payments.
"While ITSS does not determine
the policy for late payments, we
work very closely with Student Fi
nancial Services (SFS) to make sure
that the University is consistent in its
policies towards students on all bill
payments," he said.
Johnson explained in an e-mail to
The Daily that there are clear finan
cial advantages to avoiding I TSS bill
payment.
"The longer you can postpone
paying a bill, the more that money
can work for you in the interim
although unless these amounts are
substantial, that money won't be
working all that hard, but hey, time
is money," he said.
He also said that any policy lacks
force if it does not have adequate
and consistent penalties.
"If those believe the rules change
once you graduate — namely, the
University loses interest in going
after you once you leave with your
degree — then it is economically ra
tional not to pay the fee," he said.
"Thus, you're assuming that the
University has one rule when you're
here (pay the fee) and another rule
when you leave (ah. the hell with it.
stop trying to get the fee from some
one's who's left). Once it's known
that they won 't come after you if you
don't pay. no one will pay."
Clebsch said that the University
is considering moving ITSS charges
to students' quarterly bills. "This has
the advantage of students not being
nickel-and-dimed with monthly bills
to pay. as well as students being able
to apply financial aid to these
charges."
