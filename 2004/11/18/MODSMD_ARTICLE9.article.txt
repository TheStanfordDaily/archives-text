1964 — On Nov 18, 1964, The Daily
ran a blurb on Big Game Activities.
Below is an excerpt:
"Big Game Week festivities get
underway with 'Red and White Day'
today.
'Students are encouraged to wear
red and white and especially not
blue,' said Leslie Ott, publicity chair
man of the Cardinals Board, which,
together with the Axe Commission,
is handling the week's activities.
A mock trial for 'unfortunates'
caught wearing blue or gold (Cal col
ors) will be held in front of the book
store at noon today following a short
rally. The pompon girls and the
Stanford Band will appear at the
rally.
Throughout the day freshman
dollies will distribute 'Beat Cal' but
tons and matchbooks.
At 4:30 p.m. films from the 1962
Cal-Stanford Big Game will be
shown in Tresidder. The films from
the game last year will be shown
Thursday.
Tonight members of the Stanford
football team will eat supper in
women's residences. Also tonight
will be the second showing of the Big
Game 'Gaieties,' stage production
of Ram's Head.
More activities are planned for
the week on 'Axe Day' Thursday
and on 'Burn the Bear Day' Friday.
The football game between Stan
ford and the University of California
will be held Saturday at Berkeley."
1996 — On Nov 18, 1996, The Daily
ran a story on Stanford students serv
ing as extras fora major motion pic
ture. Below is an excerpt:

"Stanford students and staff got a
taste of Hollywood Friday night, and
they didn't even have to leave cam
pus.
Nearly 700 people from Stanford
and the surrounding communities
worked as extras in Walt Disney's
new movie, 'Flubber.'
The movie, which stars Robin
Williams, is a remake of The Ab
sent-Minder Professor." It will be re
leased next fall.
The site of Friday's shoot. Maples
Pavilion, was transformed into the
movie's fictional Rutland Arena by
Flubber' crew, who arrived at 5 a.m.
Friday.
A plaque reading 'Rutland
Arena' and an enormous R' were
placed on the outside wall of the
building. The crews also replaced
the lights outside the pavilion with
photographically correct light bulbs.
The night was spent filing only
two scenes, one in which extras are
entering Maples Pavilion and anoth
er in which the extras and Williams
leave the pavilion.
However, the extras found that
movie-making isn't as glamorous as
it seems.
By the end of the filming, extras
were cold and exhausted by the rep
etition. i feel like I'm in the movie
'Groundhog Day," said freshman
Aaron Bell.
'It was pretty grueling,' said doc
toral student Richard Benjamin,
who left at 2:30 a.m. I'd do it again
but not as an extra, as a director. As
an extra it was a one-time experi
ence."'
