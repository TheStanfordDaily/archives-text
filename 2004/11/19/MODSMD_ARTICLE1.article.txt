# An Axe To Grind
## Card look to dash Cal's Rose Bowl hopes 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It all comes down to this.
Stanford. California. The Axe.
Yes. Cal is ranked No. 4in the nation and is in the na
tional championship hunt. Yes, Stanford has already
been assured of a losing record and a third-straight sea
son without a howl berth.
But then again, so what?
This is Big Game, the one game a year for which
Stanford students will not only show up but scream for
victory. Maybe that seems a little hollow on the heels of
four losses in a row, including two poorly attended
home games, but the fact remains that Stanford — the
traditional dominator of the cross-Bay rivalry, with an
all-time 54-41 -3 edge — has a chance to, in essence, ruin
the Golden Bears' season.
Cal (8-1, 6-1 Pacific-1 () Conference) is seeking its
first Rose Bowl berth since 1959. And though they'd
have to leapfrog two of the three teams ahead of them,
they still have an outside chance at playing for the Na
tional Championship.
The Cardinal (4-6,2-5) have a chance to ruin all that.
While the Golden Bears would still finish second in the
Pac-10, a loss to the Cardinal would be quite unpalat
able to the computers and pollsters and could drop Cal
out of the Bowl Championship Series entirely.
Fora team that's been talking about a national
championship for much of the year — with the Rose
Bowl practically as a contingency plan —a loss to Stan
ford would be nothing short of devastating.
It would turn the world of Bay Area football upside
down. Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens, who once
again faces rumors of dismissal, would almost assured
ly return for at least one more season, while Cal's Jeff
Tedford — one of the hottest coaches in the country
right now — would, for the first time in his tenure, seem
mortal.
"We may not have the wins this year, but our kids
were competitive the whole year." said Teevens, whose
six losses this year have been by a total of just 43 points.
"To get a chance to play a team like Cal is an honor and
certainly a challenge. We're looking forward to the op
portunity."
Lastly, for the 11 Cardinal seniors, who've suffered
quite a lot since reaching the Seattle Bowl as freshmen
under Tyrone Willingham, securing the first Big Game
win of the Teevens era would validate the improvement
process through which they have led the team over the
past three years.
Okay, so it's clear that if Stanford defeats Cal, it
would be one of the greatest moments in recent Big
Game history. But how can they upend the powerful
Golden Bears?
Well, that's the problem — no one seems quite sure
how to stop Tedford's Bears.
They shut out the powerful Arizona State offense on
Oct. 30. 27-0, one week after blanking Arizona, for the
only consecutive shutouts in the Pac-10 this year. They
scored 122 total points in defeating UCLA, Oregon and

Oregon State, teams
against which Stanford
was 0-3 with 32 points
scored.
But, on the plus side,
Stanford lost to USC by
only three points, while
Cal lost by, well, six
points.
Cal's offense is one of
the best in nation, scoring
a Pac-10 best 38.1 points
per game. To make mat
ters worse for Stanford,
the Bears' defense ranks
second in conference, al
lowing just 13.9 points per
game.
"The most impressive
way they play is on the
defensive side of the foot
ball," Teevens said.
"They're a very cohesive
group."

Stanford scores only 23.6 points per game (seventh),
but its defense, despite spending a lot more time on the
field that Cal's ever does, ranks third with 19.2 points al
lowed per game.
Stanford hasn't run the hall effectively in a month,
will he starting a redshirt freshman quarterback and is
facing a tremendous defensive unit. In other words: if

the Cardinal is going to win Big Game, they will do so
on the backs of their veteran defense.
Leading the Stanford secondary is senior safety Os
hiomogho Atogwe. who is tied with senior Leigh Tor
rence for the team lead in interceptions (four). Atogwe
has 70 tackles and seven passes defensed, both team
highs.
Jon Alston leads the linebackers in the Cardinal's
unique 3-4 scheme, which has applied effective pres
sure on the passer this season. Alston has 8.5 sacks and
three forced fumbles, both team highs.
Up front, nose tackle Babatunde Oshinowo has
been a monster in the trenches, racking up 36 tackles
and 2.5 sacks, both impressive totals for his position.
He's been augmented by end Julian Jenkins and his 5.5
sacks.
They form a solid unit, which has allowed multiple
touchdowns in only five on its ten games this year. But
even they will need to bring their best effort of the sea-

son if they want to keep pace with Aaron Rodgers. J.J.
Arrington and Geoff McArthur.
Arrington leads the Pac-10 in rushing, averaging 6.9
yards per carry. 157.2 yards per game and having scored
a conference-best 13 touchdowns.
The Cardinal held him to 33 yards on 14 carries in
last yeans Big Game.

Rodgers, meanwhile, leads the Pac-10 in passing ef
ficiency, having completed an amazing 68.5 percent of
his passes for 219.7 yards per game, 20 touchdowns and
just six interceptions. He passed fora career-high 359
yards in Cal's 28-Hi win over the Cardinal last season.
McArthur had a slow start to this year, so he merely
ranks as the third-best receiver in the Pac-10, having
caught 46 balls for 670 yards and six touchdowns. This
is, by the way, the same McArthur who set a Cal record
with 16 catches for 245 yards in last year's Big Game.
The second-stringers are good, too — Marshawn
Lynch averages 8.5 yards per carry and has scored five
touchdowns. Jonathan Makonnen led the team in re
ceiving two years ago and Reggie Robertson is an im
pressive 92-of-166 for 1159 yards. 11 touchdowns and
just four interceptions in his career.
"Offensively, they're immaculate," Teevens said.
"Their running game has been formidable this year,
and their passing game as well."

On defense, senior
safety Ryan Gutierrez
leads the team with 59
tackles and senior de
fensive end Ryan Rid
dle has a team-best
10.5 sacks. Sophomore
cornerback Tim
Mixon has three inter
ceptions to lead the
Bears.
So, with what will
the Cardinal counter?
If things go well, a dan
gerous vertical passing
game, a healthy mix of
running plays and
strong special teams.
With Trent Ed
wards still nursing his
left shoulder, redshirt
freshman T.C. Os
trander will get the

start, although Ed
wards has not been ruled out for relief duty. Ostrander
is 48-of-100 passing this season for 766 yards, four
touchdowns and two interceptions and has shown a
willingness to take repeated shots downfield.
He takes most of those shots to 6-foot-7 Evan

While they're guaranteed to finish with a losing record for the third consecutive season, junior cornerback and
kick returner TJ. Rushing and the Cardinal can dull some of the pain with a victory in the 107 th Big Game. Kick
off is set for 12:30 p.m. tomorrow at Cal's Memorial Stadium.
Moore, who has 38 catches for 611
yards and six scores this season.
Tight end Alex Smith leads the
team and ranks fourth in the Pac-10
with 51 catches for 676 yards and
three touchdowns, while Mark
Bradford has 32 receptions for 431
yards and one score.
Rushing leader J.R. Lemon is
doubtful for Big Game, so senior
Kenneth Tolon will probably see
most of the action. Tolon averages
3.6 yards per carry and 38 yards per

Tolon expected to get
most of the carries

game and has scored three touch
downs.
A winning Cardinal effort
would probably include strong ef
forts by T.J. Rushing, who leads
the Pac-10 in kickoff-return aver
age (29.6 yards per return, includ
ing one touchdown) and Michael
Sgroi, who leads the conference in
field-goal attempts (22) and field
goals made (14) and has connected
from distances out to 50 yards this
year.

Whatever happens tomorrow,
there's a chance it could be worth
remembering fora long, long
time.
"This is special," Tedford said.
"It is just a tremendous game. It al
ways has been a great game and a
very, very close game, so I think that
it is probably going to be a very, very
close game again."
Stanford would like nothing better.
"I expect it to be a tremendous
ballgame," Teevens said.
