# Activists march on Hennessy's office
## 
### MIKI SOFER 
Yesterday at noon, members of the Stanford
Labor Action Committee marched from White
Plaza to University President John Hennessy's of
fice in the Main Quad to deliver letters demand
ing the implementation of what it calls "fair labor
standards."
Since its establishment in 1998, SLAC has ad
vocated for the economic and unionizing rights of
workers on campus. In the past, students have
challenged University policy by organizing a
march that shut down Campus Drive as part of the
Justice for Janitors Campaign. They also held a
four-day "sleep-out" in the Main Quad to support
fair wages for Tresidder cafe workers.
More recently, through a week-long hunger
strike in the spring of 2003, SLAC and another
student activist group, the Coalition for Labor
Justice persuaded Hennessy to establish a com
mittee to examine labor practices at Stanford. The
Presidential Committee on Labor Policies re
leased its recommendations this past summer, but
they have yet to be put into action.
"We need to work closely with the administra
tion to get the ball rolling on implementing the
recommendations from Hennessy's committee,"
said sophomore Rebecca Pratt, a member of
SLAC. She explained that the march is a show of
solidarity and a reminder that SLAC is trying to

work within Hennessy's system and that he
needs to respond.
"President Hennessy asked for feedback, so
we're trying to make our voices heard," said
SLAC member Percy Link, a senior. "I know
there are other more severe injustices in the
world, but we need to start at home. Stanford
should be a model institution."
The march commenced with a chant by junior
Joseles De La Cruz.
"What do we want? Justice! When do we want
it? Now!" he said.
When students arrived at the Main Quad yes
terday, however, they said they were disappoint
ed to find that Hennessy was not in his office and
they were not permitted to enter the building.
"If it is done in a non-violent way, we should be
allowed to go inside the office of President Hen
nessy," Pratt said.
Senior Assistant to the President Jeff Wachtel
accepted the letters on Hennessy's behalf.
Wachtel assured the students that the Universi
ty has respect for its staff and employees.
In the letters submitted to Hennessy, the stu
dents urged that he enforce four key recommen
dations made by the Presidential Committee on
Labor Policies: wage parity for temporary and
casual workers, educational opportunities, pro-

tection of the right to organize, and

ed and directly hired temporary
workers.
SLAC members said that an
other crucial goal for the group is
to establish a living wage standard
for on-canipus workers.
"Stanford has a big responsibil
ity in making sure that workers are
paid living wages," De La Cruz
said. "People don't have to suffer.

Alter exiting the Quad, students
marched to the office of Shirley
Everett, associate vice provost for
Residential and Dining Enterpris
es. to deliver a petition signed by
more than 3(H) people in support of
the rights of workers at Subway,
the sandwich chain, to wear their
union buttons.
When the students arrived, the
door was closed and Rafi Taheri-

an, the acting executive director of
Stanford Dining Services, request
ed that the group step outside.
Some SLAC students voiced
their dissatisfaction by asking
Taherian why Stanford felt it was
acceptable to violate labor laws.
The conversation became heat
ed when Kennedy Helm, an orga
nizer for United Stanford Work
ers, interjected.
"Dining management told Sub
way workers that they cannot wear
|union | buttons, but they aren't
giving any legal reasons," Helm ar
gued.
Taherian did not respond to this
comment and said that "the button
is a contractual issue." As a result,
he explained, the union would
have to go through a grievance fil
ing process, since open dialogue is
in direct violation of the contract.
Taherian agreed to schedule a
meeting with SLAC students in the
coming weeks.
