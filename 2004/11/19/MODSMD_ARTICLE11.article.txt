# Groups use Big Game to raise spirit

### JENNIFER LIU 
The teddy bears hanging from noos
es around campus are only one indica
tion that Big Game Week has under
gone a change this year. The Axe Com
mittee, the ASSU, class presidents and
even dorms are holding activities in at
tempts to foster school spirit. In antici
pation of the upcoming football match
against Cal tomorrow, student groups
on campus have modified the tradition
al activities of Big Game Week to create
excitement not only about Big Game,
but about Stanford in general.
Several changes and additions have
been made to Big Game Week this year,
culminating in the pre-game rally in
front of Hoover Tower last night. Ju
nior Amy Daley, chair of the Axe Com
mittee, said that alterations were neces
sary to boost enthusiasm for the football
game.
"Last year we had hardly any people
at the rally," said Daley. "This year, we
want to get people out and support the
football team."
The Axe Committee changed the lo
cation of the rally and increased public
ity about the event. Also, students re
ceived free t-shirts from the Stanford
Athletic department and free food do
nated by Stanford Dining at the rally.
"There's been a lot of vandalism
around campus by Cal supporters,"
Daley said. "We want to at least get peo
ple excited about the rivalry."
In addition to the traditional skewer
ing of the teddy bear atop the Claw in
White Plaza, one new addition to Big
Game Week is "abuse-a-bear," in which
students can buy a miniature stuffed
bear with a Cal ribbon and a noose
around its neck and torment them as
they see fit. The "abused bears" are

being sold by the Axe Committee.
"School spirit in recent years hasn't
been very impressive," Daley added.
"Be proud you go to Stanford, and have
fun this week."
Sophomore Emma Vaughn, a class
president, said that other changes to Big
Game Week include a "Beat the Sheet
out of Cal" contest, which was orga
nized by the Student Life Committee of
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate, in
which students compete to create the
best anti-Cal banner out of a bed sheet.
Also, throughout the week, adver
tisements about Big Game ran on the
Innovative Student Information Ser
vices (ISISHIat screens across campus,
and many professors performed stunts
in their bigger lectures.
These new activities were created to
encourage Big Game enthusiasm and to
"get Stanford students away from their
books fora little while," Vaughn wrote
in an e-mail.
She added that activities are not class
specific. "The goal of the week is to
unify Stanford as a whole," Vaughn
said. "If we separated [ Big Game Week]
into class events, I think things would
become more convoluted and com
plex."
Several dorms have been capitalizing
on Big Game to increase their own spir
it. Freshmen in particular have several
such opportunities, including the com
petition to achieve the highest percent
age of dorm residents attending the Gai
eties performance, for which the win
ners are awarded the best seats in the
house.
Donner, the freshman dorm in Stern,
has even turned Big Game Week into an
enterprise by selling T-shirts for $10
each. On the back of several designs that
