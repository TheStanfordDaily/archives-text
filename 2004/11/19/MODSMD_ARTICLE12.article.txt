# BASES kicks off Social E-Challenge

### PATRICK FITZGERALD 
Whether in it for the fame, fortune or so
cial consciousness, Stanford students gath
ered last night at the Graduate Community
Center to kick off the annual Social En
trepreneurial Challenge sponsored by the
Business Association of Stanford Engineer
ing Students, also known as BASES.
The mixer was designed to help students
meet and form groups to participate in the
competition, known as the Social-E Chal
lenge. It is one of the first steps in a process
that will ultimately result in the creation of

for-profit and non-profit social and environ
mental ventures.
Along with the Social E-Challenge,
BASES also sponsors similar contests such as
the traditional for-profit E-Challenge, and
the technological, research-oriented Innova
tor's, or I-Challenge.
"The competition is the defining event of
the group," said Dimitri Dadiomov. BASES
vice president of marketing. "There is noth
ing more basic than starting your own idea."
New to this year's Social E-Challenge is a
partnership with the IDEAS competition at
MIT.

"We found that many students at Stanford
and MIT were coming up with similar
themes," said Ashwin Mahalingam. BASES
vice president and head of the Social E-Chal
lenge. "We are merging, but not in a complete
sense. We are encouraging collaboration be
tween people at Stanford and MIT if they
both have the same ideas."
Mahalingam also hopes that the recent ad
dition of Social Entrepreneurship as a minor
in the Urban Studies program galvanizes stu
dent interest in the competition.
