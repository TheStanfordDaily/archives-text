# BASES kicks off Social E-Challenge
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD 
Whether in it for the fame, fortune or so
cial consciousness, Stanford students gath
ered last night at the Graduate Community
Center to kick off the annual Social En
trepreneurial Challenge sponsored by the
Business Association of Stanford Engineer
ing Students, also known as BASES.
The mixer was designed to help students
meet and form groups to participate in the
competition, known as the Social-E Chal
lenge. It is one of the first steps in a process
that will ultimately result in the creation of

for-profit and non-profit social and environ
mental ventures.
Along with the Social E-Challenge,
BASES also sponsors similar contests such as
the traditional for-profit E-Challenge, and
the technological, research-oriented Innova
tor's, or I-Challenge.
"The competition is the defining event of
the group," said Dimitri Dadiomov. BASES
vice president of marketing. "There is noth
ing more basic than starting your own idea."
New to this year's Social E-Challenge is a
partnership with the IDEAS competition at
MIT.

"We found that many students at Stanford
and MIT were coming up with similar
themes," said Ashwin Mahalingam. BASES
vice president and head of the Social E-Chal
lenge. "We are merging, but not in a complete
sense. We are encouraging collaboration be
tween people at Stanford and MIT if they
both have the same ideas."
Mahalingam also hopes that the recent ad
dition of Social Entrepreneurship as a minor
in the Urban Studies program galvanizes stu
dent interest in the competition.
Thirty to 40 teams are expected to enter the
Social E-Challenge, according to Ma
halingam. A team usually consists of three to
six people, although there is no limit. It often
includes students from departments like law
and business as well as engineering.
"We welcome anyone at Stanford," Da
diomov said. "The teams are more diverse and
mixed recently, [but| there is still a focus on
high-tech."
The BASES challenges are run only by un
dergraduates, whereas those at most other
schools are organized by MBA students.
Dadiomov added that although the organi
zation is undergraduate-based, teams can in
clude undergraduates, graduate students, fac
ulty, and non-Stanford affiliated individuals.
The competition only requires that at least
half of the team members be full-time Stan
ford students. It allows and even encourages

E-Challenge draws
diverse participants

potential entrepreneurs to come to Stanford
and form a team with students to enter their
ideas in the challenge.
The Social E-Challenge is completely fund
ed by private or federal sponsors, according to
Mahalingam. Each of the three challenges has
its own budget and prize money from its own
individual sponsors.
"The three competitions are run by differ
ent BASES teams," Dadiomov said. "They do
not really interact that much."
Social E-Challengers compete for $18,000
in funding prize money for their ideas. Teams
are judged on such measures as concept, mar
ket, social and environmental investment re
turn and financial sustainability.
"Judges are usually high-profile venture
capitalists happy to meet Stanford students,"
Dadiomov said.
