# Poet explores Native American culture
## 
### LAURA CARWILE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Award-winning poet and writer Simon
Ortiz said yesterday in a speech at the Stan
ford Bookstore that the Native American
culture has been hindered by its encounters
with mainstream "Euro-American" culture.
Ortiz encouraged people to use literature
as a means to celebrate a culture that has
been too often neglected.
"Poetry drives our spirits," Ortiz said.
"This is a force that is innately a part of us. We
can specifically address concerns that we may

have through poetry."
Ortiz's poems deal with Native Americans
and their struggles in modern American soci
ety. He shared his own experiences in his
birth-town of Acoma Pueblo, New Mexico.
Additionally, he spoke of the poor treatment
that Native Americans deal with in a culture
that does not actively embrace them.
"That is what literature is," he said. "In
sight into things that have to do with the com
munity."
Although known for his poetry. Ortiz is
also a children's writer, essayist, storyteller
and singer. He said his life experiences pro

vide the driving force behind his work.
His poems focus on Native Americans'
stories about the lands, culture and commu
nity values. He said he sees this history as
marred by the social, political, economic and
cultural conflict with what he calls "Euro-
American culture."
Ortiz draws out some of the less-discussed
aspects of Native-American and mainstream
American life in his works. One of his poems
spoke of his time working as a miner on land
that had originally belonged to his city but
was taken by the government because it was
found to contain uranium.
"People think we aren't here anymore," he
said. "Not that we left, but that we were killed,
that genocide got rid of us."
Ortiz attempted to make a connection between
the genocide of Native Americans by the govern
ment and the current war in Iraq.
"As students and citizens, you should be con
cerned with the state of Stanford, the state of Palo
Alto, the state of California, but mainly the state
of the world."
While he highlighted Native American cul
ture, Ortiz emphasized that he touches on other
topics, as well.
"I'm a native writer, but that's not all I write,"
he said.
A father of three and a grandfather, he at
tributed the inspiration for his first poem about
baby birds learning to fly to the experience of
watching his two older children mature into
young adults.
The intimate gathering in the Stanford Book
store yesterday was part of Ortiz's brief stay at
Stanford to promote and sign his latest collection
of poems, "Out There Somewhere." His visit in
cluded Wednesday's poetry reading and yester
day's writing workshop.
