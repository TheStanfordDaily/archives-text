# Black students silently make voices heard at UC-Berkeley's Sproul Plaza
## 
### SONJA SHARP DAILY CALIFORNIAN (U. CALIFORNIA-BERKELEY 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif.—
Foot traffic on the University of Cal
ifornia-Berkeley's Sproul Plaza was
hottlenecked at noon Wednesday,
when nearly 100 black students
dressed head to toe in black-blocked
Sat her Gate as part of a daylong
silent protest against the drop in
black student enrollment over the
last few years.
The demonstration, which was
called "Blackout," began in the
morning with demonstrators in
groups of five and 10 entering class
rooms. The students later stood on
Sproul Plaza, where they remained
blocking the thoroughfare until the
afternoon.
Many students had to travel
through the sides of Sproul Plaza or
avoid Sather Gate altogether.
Demonstrators, who came from a
number of black student organiza
tions, wore bandannas over their
noses and mouths to symbolize
being silenced by the campus com
munity. said Raniyah Abdus-
Samad, executive director of the
Black Recruitment and Retention

Center.
"We feel silenced by the adminis
tration. but we feel more silenced by
our peers and the ASUC," Abdus-
Samad said. "Our population is so
small that our voice doesn't matter."
She said the campus climate for
black students has become increas
ingly uncomfortable as fewer black
students enroll every year.
"It's hard when you're one of two
or three black people in a large
class," she said. "It's hard when my
professor starts talking about slav
ery and he looks straight at me.
We're looked at to explain all black
issues."
Campus administrators estimate
there are 108 black freshmen this
fall, said Richard Black, associate
vice chancellor of admissions and
enrollment.
"How can we recruit people
when we can't even retain our
selves?" Abdus-Samad said.
In a flier distributed at the after
noon demonstration, students de
manded that the administration
form relationships with the black
student community, recruit more
black faculty, have mandatory diver
sity training for students and create a
task force to study reasons for the

decline in black enrollment.
The demonstrators later repeat
ed their complaints during the
ASUC Senate meeting and stood
silently to protest their belief that
their concerns have fallen on deaf
ears in the ASUC.
"It's just not a drop in enroll
ment, that happens every year," said
CaISERVE Senator Brent Kasten
baum, who participated in the
demonstration. "We have a hostile
environment to learn in. The ASUC
continues to disrespect this commu
nity."
Other student reactions ran the
spectrum from bewildered to an
noyed to awed.
"It's powerful — I'm glad they're
doing it." said UC Berkeley junior
Wale Forrester.
Several student groups were also
affected by the congestion on Sproul
Plaza.
Three Heuristic Squelch writers
said they were verbally assaulted
while trying to distribute their maga
zine. They said they were forced to
set up approximately 100 feet from
their usual distribution spot, said
Simon Ganz, the Squelch's deputy
creative editor.
A man who campus officials later

said was unaffiliated with the Black
Recruitment and Retention Center
physically threatened Squelch dis
tributors and flicked burning
cigarette ash on them, said
SQUELCH! Senator Ben Narodick.
"We couldn't set up our booth in
our usual spot," Ganz said. "I'm
sympathetic to the issues, but I'm
not fond of the censorship."
UC Berkeley administrators are
working to address the issues raised
by the demonstrators, said UC
Berkeley spokesperson Janet
Gilmore.
"Chancellor Birgeneau shares
the students' concerns. In fact, he
met with representatives of the
group last week to discuss these is
sues," Gilmore said.
But responsibility for the prob
lem may not fall solely on the uni
versity's shoulders. According to
professor Gibor Basri, problems
with primary and secondary educa
tion are culprits in lower admissions
rates among underrepresented mi
nority students.
"The real problem is how many
minority students are UC-eligible,"
Basri said, "And that's a problem
with the K through 12."

manded that the administration
form relationships with the black
student community, recruit more
black faculty, have mandatory diver
sity training for students and create a
task force to study reasons for the

decline in black enrollment.
The demonstrators later repeat
ed their complaints during the
ASUC Senate meeting and stood
silently to protest their belief that
their concerns have fallen on deaf
ears in the ASUC.
"It's just not a drop in enroll
ment, that happens every year," said
CaISERVE Senator Brent Kasten
baum, who participated in the
demonstration. "We have a hostile
environment to learn in. The ASUC
continues to disrespect this commu
nity."
Other student reactions ran the
spectrum from bewildered to an
noyed to awed.
"It's powerful — I'm glad they're
doing it." said UC Berkeley junior
Wale Forrester.
Several student groups were also
affected by the congestion on Sproul
Plaza.
Three Heuristic Squelch writers
said they were verbally assaulted
while trying to distribute their maga
zine. They said they were forced to
set up approximately 100 feet from
their usual distribution spot, said
Simon Ganz, the Squelch's deputy
creative editor.
A man who campus officials later

said was unaffiliated with the Black
Recruitment and Retention Center
physically threatened Squelch dis
tributors and flicked burning
cigarette ash on them, said
SQUELCH! Senator Ben Narodick.
"We couldn't set up our booth in
our usual spot," Ganz said. "I'm
sympathetic to the issues, but I'm
not fond of the censorship."
UC Berkeley administrators are
working to address the issues raised
by the demonstrators, said UC
Berkeley spokesperson Janet
Gilmore.
"Chancellor Birgeneau shares
the students' concerns. In fact, he
met with representatives of the
group last week to discuss these is
sues," Gilmore said.
But responsibility for the prob
lem may not fall solely on the uni
versity's shoulders. According to
professor Gibor Basri, problems
with primary and secondary educa
tion are culprits in lower admissions
rates among underrepresented mi
nority students.
"The real problem is how many
minority students are UC-eligible,"
Basri said, "And that's a problem
with the K through 12."
