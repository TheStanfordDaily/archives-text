N.J. — A large and diverse group of
students bubbling with anticipation
for free vegetarian food and religious
debate on Tuesday filled the Busch
Campus Center.
Religious Vegetarianism drew
about 70 people to the event, put to
gether by Rutgers University Humans
Against Meat, a Rutgers College veg
etarian group. The event was in con
junction with the Hindu Student
Council to explore how "vegetarian
ism fits into the moral framework of
various religions," said Rutgers Col
lege junior Dcepa Sannidhi, co-presi
dent of RU HAM.

The first speaker of the night was
Edwin Bryant, a University professor
who has written various hooks about
Hinduism. He explained how religion
in India went from its sacrificial Vedic
tradition, which in at least one in
stance included a sacrifice of 168 ani
mals, to the concepts of nonviolence
and universal respect for life that
characterize the Hindu religion today.
Bryant said the transition was
marked by a refusal of the sacrificial
content of the Vedic texts, which al
lowed for the consumption of meat,
with a claim this was "not for progres
sive, enlightened people interested in
spirituality."
Richard Schwartz, a University
alumnus and professor emeritus at the
College of Staten Island, spoke of the

compassionate nature of Judaism and
the global impact of meat eating.
Schwartz said the Old Testament
puts animals under the responsible
stewardship of man. He concluded
with the adage, "If slaughterhouses
had glass walls, there would be a lot
more vegetarians." He encouraged
everyone to get vegetarianism on the
political agenda for its potential to
end hunger and save rainforests.
Rutgers College 2004 alumnus
Ethan Genauer said, "1 live with Indi
an people, and this event has helped
me to better understand their Hindu
principles." He said he came to enjoy
the event as not a vegan, but a "free
gan" — one who loves free food, es
pecially the vegetarian kind
