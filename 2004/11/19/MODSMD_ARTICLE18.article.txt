# Touching Tongues
## Paint By Nipple Number 
### 
You and your special man friend
have been bumbling along in typical
Stanford relationship ineptitude fora
few weeks when your roommate
leaves for some sort of engineering
conference-really-cool-thing y.
Returning from a romantic candlelit
dinner at Pasta?, you step inside and
turn off the overhead Chiclet light,
bathing your half of the blindingly
white cinder-block-walled room in a
sexy computer screen glow.
"Yes!" you think, "I'm finally
going to see it!" He takes off his shirt,
and that's

when you
realize that
"it" is in fact
seeing you.
That's right,
Romeo has a
third nipple.
Or maybe
(even more
horrifyingly)
he only has
one, dead
center on his
chest, and you
think it might
have winked

at you. That, my friends, is the text
book definition of a deal breaker, the
subject your columnists would like to
tackle this week.
A deal breaker is that one thing
about an otherwise decent human
being that makes it simply impossible
for you to pursue any type of sexual
relationship with him. You can be best
friends forever with nipple-boy, but
any attraction that might have been
there in the first place went up in a
puff of nipple-shaped smoke the sec
ond he stripped.
Just in case you've never met any
one with an odd number of nipples let
us provide a few more common exam
ples, of deal-breaking attributes.
First and most übiquitous on a
campus of this size: history. A poten
tial suitor approaches, you chat,
you're getting a frisky vibe, and then
your vibe turns a little deja vu-ish.
"Where do I know this kid from?"
you wonder. Then it slaps you in the
face like a drunk and belligerent Erin
(no really, true story). He was naked
in your roommate's bed a few months
ago. If you like your roommate, then
this is an issue of honor and you must
immediately cut your losses. If you
don't like said roommate you should
run away even faster, because you
now have confirmation that the per
son you're talking to has absolutely
no standards.
Next on the list: body hair. Now for
some sharing. Last year, a young man
called Mary after an evening of
delightful conversation. Mary was
primed to call him back (after the
appropriate number of days of
course), when she happened to drive
past him and catch a glimpse of the
boy, shirtless, outside of an unspeci
fied house on campus. She could not
see his back for the hair, and despite
the screaming of her scandalized con
science, she simply could not bring
herself to return aforementioned
young man's phone call. We object to
all inappropriately placed body hair
— from backmat, unibrows and style
able nose tufts, to flavor-savers and
1970's pedophiliac mustaches. A fine
sprinkling on the pectorals is nothing
to write home about. However, a
mink stole of chest plumes protruding
from one's collar is, for us at least, a
deal breaker.
Last but not least, we have deal
breaking amounts of intensity. When
you wake up to the Mariachi Band
serenading you from yon grassy knoll
by Stern, and you have seven missed
calls during one 50-minute lecture,
you might begin to question your
relationship. However, when the kid
that you hooked up with last weekend
wheels one of those wrinkly little dogs
into your room in a pram so that you
can "try out" being a parent, that
might give you good cause to run
screaming.
And remember, if anyone EVER
offers anal in lieu of losing their vir
ginity, back away, because their sense
of logic has obviously gone all wonky.
And insanity is an extra-special deal
breaker.

1970's pedophiliac mustaches. A fine
sprinkling on the pectorals is nothing
to write home about. However, a
mink stole of chest plumes protruding
from one's collar is, for us at least, a
deal breaker.
Last but not least, we have deal
breaking amounts of intensity. When
you wake up to the Mariachi Band
serenading you from yon grassy knoll
by Stern, and you have seven missed
calls during one 50-minute lecture,
you might begin to question your
relationship. However, when the kid
that you hooked up with last weekend
wheels one of those wrinkly little dogs
into your room in a pram so that you
can "try out" being a parent, that
might give you good cause to run
screaming.
And remember, if anyone EVER
offers anal in lieu of losing their vir
ginity, back away, because their sense
of logic has obviously gone all wonky.
And insanity is an extra-special deal
breaker.
