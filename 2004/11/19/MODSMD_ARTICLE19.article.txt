# Beating the Bears since 1892... A history of Big Game
## 
### REBECCA A. JACOBS 
With less than 24 hours to before the 107 th Big Game,
a Stanford student waits for the AXE committee's hourly
countdown in White Plaza wearing her Cardinal t-shirt and
clutching a hideously molested teddy bear. Why? Because,
as her t-shirt reads, "Stanford Has Standards." Now, go back
to a time before the Big Game had a name, before the Axe,
before the t-shirt was appropriate attire and before teddy
bears existed.
The Birth of Rig Game
According to the Handbook of Stanford University, pro
duced by Axe Comm. the first Big Game occurred on
Dec. 17, 1892. UC Berkeley's seven-years-in-training foot
ball team challenged Stanford's infant club to a match in
San Francisco. The Oakland Tribune called it"The Great
Football Game."
Both teams arrived at the intersection of Haight and
Stanyan Streets to play in front of 20.000 spectators, but
neither team remembered to bring a ball. Fortunately, the
teams were saved by the goodwill of a local sporting goods
outfitter who brought a ball within an hour of the start time.
Stanford won the match, 14-10, and Berkeley faced the
shame of losing to an inexperienced team.
That's how the long-standing Stanford-Cal rivalry began.
The Stanford fans of 1892 initiated a tradition of
school spirit that continues through today. Just as some of
us will board our dorm and ASSU-chartered buses, the
first fans boarded a specially chartered train decked in
cardinal colors.
According to a student's letter home written following
the 1892 game, the engine "whistled the college yell all the
way up" to San Francisco and "students chimed in with
horns of every description."
Immediately upon disembarking, students "monopo
lized" the city, decorating the streetcars, marching down

Market Street and sending horses
and chariots streaming red ribbons
through the Grand Court of the
Palace Hotel.
The "Great Game" brought
intensity from both campuses. The
same spectator observed. "A
Stanford man was not to be [seen
without] a yard or two of streaming
cardinal ribbon in his buttonhole."
Similarly, a Berkeley student was
not caught without blue and gold
paraphernalia, and "whenever a
number of both parties met on the
street, there was a clash."
A student street brawl usually
began by one party "hissing" at
another or by a group of Stanford
students shouting, "Three Cheers
for Stanford! Hip, Hip, Hurrah!"
Even though Stanford original
ly opened as a co-educational insti
tution. some activities were
deemed too masculine for the
women. "All the pretty girls stood
in second-story windows and
waved cardinal handkerchiefs," the
student wrote.
A Gruesome Past
The rivalry remained spirited
but relatively tame until 1897,
when during what was then called
the Thanksgiving Game, the roof of
the grandstand collapsed and
injured eight spectators. The Nov.
30 issue of the Daily Palo Alto —

now the Stanford Daily — reported that several people
who wanted a good view of the game but did not want to
pay $2 fora grandstand ticket climbed onto the roof, caus
ing it to collapse.
As it turns out, the Big Game has quite a morbid histo
ry. Three years later, at a match held at 16th and Folsom
Streets in San Francisco, the rooftop of S.F. and Pacific
Glass Works collapsed under several hundred ticket-evad
ing spectators, killing 13 and injuring 78.
Tailguiting for rugby?
That year, 1900, also marked the first use of the term
"Big Game." According to Stanford magazine, the choice of
the word "Big" was meant to evoke the Harvard-Yale rival
ry — not the number of casualties. Nevertheless, between
1900 and 1905, people across the nation condemned foot
ball as an inherently violent sport.
Even former President Theodore Roosevelt demanded
rule changes that would prevent the rising death toll of high
school and college players injured on the field. Universities
across the country scrutinized the safety issues concerning
football and big rivalries. Between 1906 and 1913, rugby
replaced football as the official Big Game sport.
In 1964, the violence occurred far from the field. After
student leaders from Stanford and Cal negotiated the
return of goods pilfered from earlier pranks, Stanford fresh
men intercepted the Cal truck, whose driver pulled a
loaded gun on the students. Police intervened and no one
was hurt.
The University's attempts to cope with raucous fan
behavior throughout the years have a fascinating legacy of
their own. In 1975,The Daily reported that several drunken
youths threw rocks and bottles at police and firefighters
after the annual bonfire at Lake Lagunita.The centerpiece
tradition of Big Game week, which began in 1898 when stu
dents dragged wood into the dry lake bed to create an
emblematic funeral pyre for the Golden Bear, was replaced

with fireworks in 1978 for what the administration termed
"environmental and safety reasons."
In 1979, the University took more drastic measures.
According to The Daily, the list of pre-Game festivities was
limited to "singing, bowling, and...a record-breaking bunny
hop." The rumba line was cancelled due to "potential secu
rity problems."
Many Stanford students escaped with the Stanford Band
to San Francisco where the party must have been livelier
because the Daily reported that a week later, the city
threatened to bill the Band for "excessive damage to
Aquatic Park."
In 1982, five students were injured at the San Francisco
Big Game rally when a driver plowed his car through the
end of the march. The following year, the organizers of the
rally took out a $1 million insurance policy in response to
the San Francisco Police Department's threat "to arrest the
entire band" if festivities got out of hand. On the scene
were 300 uniformed and plainclothes officers; no arrests
were made.
Fans for life
Several matches were cancelled over the years fora vari
ety of reasons. The return of the Big Game after a dry spell
was always a celebrated event. In November 1926, Sports
Illustrated announced "The Second First Big Game" and in
November 1928, the Big Game gained historic importance
when the sports magazine published "The Big Game 25
Years Ago."
Marshall Small, Class of 1947, recalled the particularly
historic 1947 game in which Stanford had not won a game
all year and Cal was headed for Rose Bowl.
"Cal had just run up a big score on Idaho not long
before, and Jackie Jensen, All-American running back for
Cal, said that while Cal was sorry that the score was so high
against Idaho, against Stanford Cal didn't care how high the
score went," Small said.

Instead, Stanford managed to
win 21-18.
Small said that not much has
changed in the stands since
1947.
"In those days, we were sit
ting on the other side, the east
side," he said. "If you
approached the Cal rooting sec
tion in anything red, it was your
peril."
Richard Hung, Class of 1994,
remembered a bet wtih a friend
at Cal in which the losing party
had to wear the opposing
school's colors to school the
Monday after Big Game.
"My friend paid up on the bet
by wearing Stanford red and
white and skipping all classes
that day," Hung said. "The Cal
people take it a lot more serious
ly than we do, I think."
The personal importance
fans attach to Big Game is at
times immeasurable. Connie
Chen, Class 1989, remembered
sitting in the stadium, waiting to
hear word on her bar exam
results.
"I was convinced that the
results of the Big Game were
tied to or indicative of my bar
scores, something totally irra
tional like that," she said.
Stanford won — and Chen is
now a litigator practicing at
Morrison & Foerster.

With less than 24 hours to before the 107 th Big Game,
a Stanford student waits for the AXE committee's hourly
countdown in White Plaza wearing her Cardinal t-shirt and
clutching a hideously molested teddy bear. Why? Because,
as her t-shirt reads, "Stanford Has Standards." Now, go back
to a time before the Big Game had a name, before the Axe,
before the t-shirt was appropriate attire and before teddy
bears existed.
The Birth of Rig Game
According to the Handbook of Stanford University, pro
duced by Axe Comm. the first Big Game occurred on
Dec. 17, 1892. UC Berkeley's seven-years-in-training foot
ball team challenged Stanford's infant club to a match in
San Francisco. The Oakland Tribune called it"The Great
Football Game."
Both teams arrived at the intersection of Haight and
Stanyan Streets to play in front of 20.000 spectators, but
neither team remembered to bring a ball. Fortunately, the
teams were saved by the goodwill of a local sporting goods
outfitter who brought a ball within an hour of the start time.
Stanford won the match, 14-10, and Berkeley faced the
shame of losing to an inexperienced team.
That's how the long-standing Stanford-Cal rivalry began.
The Stanford fans of 1892 initiated a tradition of
school spirit that continues through today. Just as some of
us will board our dorm and ASSU-chartered buses, the
first fans boarded a specially chartered train decked in
cardinal colors.
According to a student's letter home written following
the 1892 game, the engine "whistled the college yell all the
way up" to San Francisco and "students chimed in with
horns of every description."
Immediately upon disembarking, students "monopo
lized" the city, decorating the streetcars, marching down

Market Street and sending horses
and chariots streaming red ribbons
through the Grand Court of the
Palace Hotel.
The "Great Game" brought
intensity from both campuses. The
same spectator observed. "A
Stanford man was not to be [seen
without] a yard or two of streaming
cardinal ribbon in his buttonhole."
Similarly, a Berkeley student was
not caught without blue and gold
paraphernalia, and "whenever a
number of both parties met on the
street, there was a clash."
A student street brawl usually
began by one party "hissing" at
another or by a group of Stanford
students shouting, "Three Cheers
for Stanford! Hip, Hip, Hurrah!"
Even though Stanford original
ly opened as a co-educational insti
tution. some activities were
deemed too masculine for the
women. "All the pretty girls stood
in second-story windows and
waved cardinal handkerchiefs," the
student wrote.
A Gruesome Past
The rivalry remained spirited
but relatively tame until 1897,
when during what was then called
the Thanksgiving Game, the roof of
the grandstand collapsed and
injured eight spectators. The Nov.
30 issue of the Daily Palo Alto —

now the Stanford Daily — reported that several people
who wanted a good view of the game but did not want to
pay $2 fora grandstand ticket climbed onto the roof, caus
ing it to collapse.
As it turns out, the Big Game has quite a morbid histo
ry. Three years later, at a match held at 16th and Folsom
Streets in San Francisco, the rooftop of S.F. and Pacific
Glass Works collapsed under several hundred ticket-evad
ing spectators, killing 13 and injuring 78.
Tailguiting for rugby?
That year, 1900, also marked the first use of the term
"Big Game." According to Stanford magazine, the choice of
the word "Big" was meant to evoke the Harvard-Yale rival
ry — not the number of casualties. Nevertheless, between
1900 and 1905, people across the nation condemned foot
ball as an inherently violent sport.
Even former President Theodore Roosevelt demanded
rule changes that would prevent the rising death toll of high
school and college players injured on the field. Universities
across the country scrutinized the safety issues concerning
football and big rivalries. Between 1906 and 1913, rugby
replaced football as the official Big Game sport.
In 1964, the violence occurred far from the field. After
student leaders from Stanford and Cal negotiated the
return of goods pilfered from earlier pranks, Stanford fresh
men intercepted the Cal truck, whose driver pulled a
loaded gun on the students. Police intervened and no one
was hurt.
The University's attempts to cope with raucous fan
behavior throughout the years have a fascinating legacy of
their own. In 1975,The Daily reported that several drunken
youths threw rocks and bottles at police and firefighters
after the annual bonfire at Lake Lagunita.The centerpiece
tradition of Big Game week, which began in 1898 when stu
dents dragged wood into the dry lake bed to create an
emblematic funeral pyre for the Golden Bear, was replaced

with fireworks in 1978 for what the administration termed
"environmental and safety reasons."
In 1979, the University took more drastic measures.
According to The Daily, the list of pre-Game festivities was
limited to "singing, bowling, and...a record-breaking bunny
hop." The rumba line was cancelled due to "potential secu
rity problems."
Many Stanford students escaped with the Stanford Band
to San Francisco where the party must have been livelier
because the Daily reported that a week later, the city
threatened to bill the Band for "excessive damage to
Aquatic Park."
In 1982, five students were injured at the San Francisco
Big Game rally when a driver plowed his car through the
end of the march. The following year, the organizers of the
rally took out a $1 million insurance policy in response to
the San Francisco Police Department's threat "to arrest the
entire band" if festivities got out of hand. On the scene
were 300 uniformed and plainclothes officers; no arrests
were made.
Fans for life
Several matches were cancelled over the years fora vari
ety of reasons. The return of the Big Game after a dry spell
was always a celebrated event. In November 1926, Sports
Illustrated announced "The Second First Big Game" and in
November 1928, the Big Game gained historic importance
when the sports magazine published "The Big Game 25
Years Ago."
Marshall Small, Class of 1947, recalled the particularly
historic 1947 game in which Stanford had not won a game
all year and Cal was headed for Rose Bowl.
"Cal had just run up a big score on Idaho not long
before, and Jackie Jensen, All-American running back for
Cal, said that while Cal was sorry that the score was so high
against Idaho, against Stanford Cal didn't care how high the
score went," Small said.

Instead, Stanford managed to
win 21-18.
Small said that not much has
changed in the stands since
1947.
"In those days, we were sit
ting on the other side, the east
side," he said. "If you
approached the Cal rooting sec
tion in anything red, it was your
peril."
Richard Hung, Class of 1994,
remembered a bet wtih a friend
at Cal in which the losing party
had to wear the opposing
school's colors to school the
Monday after Big Game.
"My friend paid up on the bet
by wearing Stanford red and
white and skipping all classes
that day," Hung said. "The Cal
people take it a lot more serious
ly than we do, I think."
The personal importance
fans attach to Big Game is at
times immeasurable. Connie
Chen, Class 1989, remembered
sitting in the stadium, waiting to
hear word on her bar exam
results.
"I was convinced that the
results of the Big Game were
tied to or indicative of my bar
scores, something totally irra
tional like that," she said.
Stanford won — and Chen is
now a litigator practicing at
Morrison & Foerster.
