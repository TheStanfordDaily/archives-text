# Buddy and Jeff: A three-year tale of two coaches
## 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In 2001, the college football landscape was relatively
similar to today. Things in the Bay Area, however, have
changed drastically in the last three years. In 2001, Stanford
was howl-hound, finishing the season with a 9-3 record.
Cal. on the other hand, was one of the worst teams in the
NCAA, finishing the season at 1-10.
But heading into tomorrow's Big Game, Cal is ranked
No. 4 in the country, looking to make its first BCS bowl
game. Stanford sits at 4-6. reeling after four straight losses.
The last three years have been as different as possible
for the Cardinal and the Bears. In 2002, Cal had the biggest
positive turnaround of any team in the country, moving to
7-5, while Stanford had the biggest negative turnaround,
falling to 2-9.
Head coaching changes coincided with the team's sud
den reversal of fortunes over the past three seasons. In
2002, Cal head coach Jeff Tedford replaced Tom Holnioe.
Previously, Tedford served as offensive coordinator at
Oregon, which finished the 2001 season ranked No. 2 in the
nation.
Stanford also made a coaching change after the 2001
season. When Tyrone Willingham left to take the head
coaching job at Notre Dame, the Cardinal hired Buddy
Teevens. In 2001, Teevens served as the assistant offensive
coordinator fora Florida team that finished the season
ranked No. 3.
Both coaches were touted as offensive masterminds
coming into their respective positions, but the programs
have clearly not performed at the same level.
In 2001, the Cardinal averaged 451.5 yards per game and
scored 408 points. In 2002, Teevens' first season, Stanford
only picked up 311.4 yards per game and scored 225 points.
Those numbers fell even further in 2003.
For the Bears, the offensive statistics have gone the
other way. In 2001. Cal's offense managed only 349.6 yards
per game and scored an anemic 201 points. Jump ahead to
2004 and the Bears' offense is one of the most potent in the
nation.
This year, Cal is averaging a little over 490 yards per
game and has scored 343 points, with two games still left to
play. They are averaging an astounding 247.8 yards per
game on the ground and have scored less than 27 points
only once this year.
It is no wonder that there is talk on the Farm of a possi
ble coaching change. Teevens took over a program that
went to the Rose Bowl during the 1999 season and the Seat
tle Bowl in 2001. and turned it into a Pac-10 bottom

dweller.
Granted, Teevens' teams have
shown improvement over the last
three seasons. In 2003, the Cardinal
won two more games than in 2002,
and while this year might end with
another 4-7 season, the team has
certainly improved. This said, his
10-22 record in three years at Stan
ford leaves many with a sour taste in
their mouth.
At Cal there is talk of Tedford
leaving, but for very different rea
sons. Many are concerned that Ted
ford could depart from the program
fora higher-profile school that
could add a few more zeros to his
contract.
Regardless of whether Tedford
stays or goes, and for how long, he
has done an amazing job in turn
ing the Cal football program
around.

they've kind of seen it come full
circle," Tedford said during a press
conference this week. "I know
they're tremendously proud and
they should be because of their
hard work and dedication and trust
in one another. One thing about
our team that I'm really proud of is
the belief and trust the kids have in
one another.
"That's what I've seen that has
been the difference in these three
years."
Tedford is also looking to win his
third straight Big Game over
Teevens and the Cardinal, an ac
complishment that could be as im
portant as his 23-12 record at
Berkeley.
"This is special, this has a differ
ent flavor, a healthy environment
that a lot of people get very, very ex
cited about — this fall especially.

and the excitement just conies
along with that." Tedford said. "It is
just a tremendous game."
If Cal is able to finish out the sea
son with wins over Stanford and
Southern Miss, the transition from
last in the Pac-10 to Rose Bowl
would be complete.
Obviously, for Stanford, the game
has a different meaning. If the Cardi
nal were able to pull off what would
be one of the biggest upsets in Big
Game history, not only would it ruin
Cal's bid to play in the Rose Bowl
and bring the Axe back to Stanford,
but it could save Teevens his job.
As always with Big Game, the
passion on both sidelines to win
will be strong. But for the first
time in recent memory, it is the
Bears, not the Cardinal, who are
playing for something more than
the Axe.

were part of that 1-10 season, so
they've kind of seen it come full
circle," Tedford said during a press
conference this week. "I know
they're tremendously proud and
they should be because of their
hard work and dedication and trust
in one another. One thing about
our team that I'm really proud of is
the belief and trust the kids have in
one another.
"That's what I've seen that has
been the difference in these three
years."
Tedford is also looking to win his
third straight Big Game over
Teevens and the Cardinal, an ac
complishment that could be as im
portant as his 23-12 record at
Berkeley.
"This is special, this has a differ

that a lot of people get very, very ex
cited about — this fall especially.

having a full house of 74,000 fans
and the excitement just conies
along with that." Tedford said. "It is
just a tremendous game."
If Cal is able to finish out the sea
son with wins over Stanford and
Southern Miss, the transition from
last in the Pac-10 to Rose Bowl
would be complete.
Obviously, for Stanford, the game
has a different meaning. If the Cardi
nal were able to pull off what would
be one of the biggest upsets in Big
Game history, not only would it ruin
Cal's bid to play in the Rose Bowl
and bring the Axe back to Stanford,
but it could save Teevens his job.
As always with Big Game, the
passion on both sidelines to win
will be strong. But for the first
time in recent memory, it is the
Bears, not the Cardinal, who are
playing for something more than
the Axe.
In 2001, the college football landscape was relatively
similar to today. Things in the Bay Area, however, have
changed drastically in the last three years. In 2001, Stanford
was howl-hound, finishing the season with a 9-3 record.
Cal. on the other hand, was one of the worst teams in the
NCAA, finishing the season at 1-10.
But heading into tomorrow's Big Game, Cal is ranked
No. 4 in the country, looking to make its first BCS bowl
game. Stanford sits at 4-6. reeling after four straight losses.
The last three years have been as different as possible
for the Cardinal and the Bears. In 2002, Cal had the biggest
positive turnaround of any team in the country, moving to
7-5, while Stanford had the biggest negative turnaround,
falling to 2-9.
Head coaching changes coincided with the team's sud
den reversal of fortunes over the past three seasons. In
2002, Cal head coach Jeff Tedford replaced Tom Holnioe.
Previously, Tedford served as offensive coordinator at
Oregon, which finished the 2001 season ranked No. 2 in the
nation.
Stanford also made a coaching change after the 2001
season. When Tyrone Willingham left to take the head
coaching job at Notre Dame, the Cardinal hired Buddy
Teevens. In 2001, Teevens served as the assistant offensive
coordinator fora Florida team that finished the season
ranked No. 3.
Both coaches were touted as offensive masterminds
coming into their respective positions, but the programs
have clearly not performed at the same level.
In 2001, the Cardinal averaged 451.5 yards per game and
scored 408 points. In 2002, Teevens' first season, Stanford
only picked up 311.4 yards per game and scored 225 points.
Those numbers fell even further in 2003.
For the Bears, the offensive statistics have gone the
other way. In 2001. Cal's offense managed only 349.6 yards
per game and scored an anemic 201 points. Jump ahead to
2004 and the Bears' offense is one of the most potent in the
nation.
This year, Cal is averaging a little over 490 yards per
game and has scored 343 points, with two games still left to
play. They are averaging an astounding 247.8 yards per
game on the ground and have scored less than 27 points
only once this year.
It is no wonder that there is talk on the Farm of a possi
ble coaching change. Teevens took over a program that
went to the Rose Bowl during the 1999 season and the Seat
tle Bowl in 2001. and turned it into a Pac-10 bottom

Granted, Teevens' teams have
shown improvement over the last
three seasons. In 2003, the Cardinal
won two more games than in 2002,
and while this year might end with
another 4-7 season, the team has
certainly improved. This said, his
10-22 record in three years at Stan
ford leaves many with a sour taste in
their mouth.
At Cal there is talk of Tedford
leaving, but for very different rea
sons. Many are concerned that Ted
ford could depart from the program
fora higher-profile school that
could add a few more zeros to his
contract.
