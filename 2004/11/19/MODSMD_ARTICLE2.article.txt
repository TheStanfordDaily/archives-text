# Buddy and Jeff: A three-year tale of two coaches
## 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In 2001, the college football landscape was relatively
similar to today. Things in the Bay Area, however, have
changed drastically in the last three years. In 2001, Stanford
was howl-hound, finishing the season with a 9-3 record.
Cal. on the other hand, was one of the worst teams in the
NCAA, finishing the season at 1-10.
But heading into tomorrow's Big Game, Cal is ranked
No. 4 in the country, looking to make its first BCS bowl
game. Stanford sits at 4-6. reeling after four straight losses.
The last three years have been as different as possible
for the Cardinal and the Bears. In 2002, Cal had the biggest
positive turnaround of any team in the country, moving to
7-5, while Stanford had the biggest negative turnaround,
falling to 2-9.
Head coaching changes coincided with the team's sud
den reversal of fortunes over the past three seasons. In
2002, Cal head coach Jeff Tedford replaced Tom Holnioe.
Previously, Tedford served as offensive coordinator at
Oregon, which finished the 2001 season ranked No. 2 in the
nation.
Stanford also made a coaching change after the 2001
season. When Tyrone Willingham left to take the head
coaching job at Notre Dame, the Cardinal hired Buddy
Teevens. In 2001, Teevens served as the assistant offensive
coordinator fora Florida team that finished the season
ranked No. 3.
Both coaches were touted as offensive masterminds
coming into their respective positions, but the programs
have clearly not performed at the same level.
In 2001, the Cardinal averaged 451.5 yards per game and
scored 408 points. In 2002, Teevens' first season, Stanford
only picked up 311.4 yards per game and scored 225 points.
Those numbers fell even further in 2003.
For the Bears, the offensive statistics have gone the
other way. In 2001. Cal's offense managed only 349.6 yards
per game and scored an anemic 201 points. Jump ahead to
2004 and the Bears' offense is one of the most potent in the
nation.
This year, Cal is averaging a little over 490 yards per
game and has scored 343 points, with two games still left to
play. They are averaging an astounding 247.8 yards per
game on the ground and have scored less than 27 points
only once this year.
It is no wonder that there is talk on the Farm of a possi
ble coaching change. Teevens took over a program that
went to the Rose Bowl during the 1999 season and the Seat
tle Bowl in 2001. and turned it into a Pac-10 bottom

the tutelage of head coach Jeff Tedford, who took over a
Cal team that went 1-10 in 2001.
