## Editorial Grad commission has potential 
### 
University president John Hennessy recently
announced the creation of the Commis
sion on Graduate Education. By July of
next year, the Commission will articulate
"an overall vision of how graduate education at
Stanford's various schools might be enhanced over
the next five years."
This is an ambitious and worthwhile task, consid
ering the diversity of graduate programs and the vast
potential to innovate an education system that has
been left to develop on its own, without a coherent
vision, over the last century.
Shortly after the Commission on Undergraduate
Education submitted its recommendations in 1994,
then-University President Gerhard Casper and
then Provost Condolee/za Rice created a new posi
tion of vice provost for undergraduate education.
A few years later, the University embarked on
the Campaign for Undergraduate Education was
created in order to fund the initiatives recommend
ed by the commission.
Perhaps the Commission on Graduate Education
will recommend that the University also create a po
sition that focuses on the education of graduate stu
dents. We might also expect a new campaign for
graduate education to raise funds that will support
the commission's recommendations.
Two months ago, the Japanese education min-

istry announced that it would spend $110 million
next year to encourage innovative programs in grad
uate education. To obtain the two-year grants, the
Chronicle of Higher Education said, Japanese uni
versities must "show how they plan to create prac
tice-oriented curricula, foster competition among
students, improve research opportunities for stu
dents, and retrain professors to interact more with
students and respond to their needs."
The motives for the Japanese education ministry
are similar to those of Stanford: The job market has
evolved, and so must the education of graduate stu
dents.
Interdepartmental collaboration should enhance
the scholarly efforts of departments as well as the
education of graduate students. It may even improve
the social life of graduate students.
The commission should carefully poll graduate
students, undergraduate students and alumni of
Stanford's graduate programs.
It is possible that some graduate programs should
remain unaltered. However, all departments may
benefit from cooperating with and comparing their
programs to those of other disciplines.
We applaud the creation of the Commission on
Graduate Education and are optimistic that it will
have a positive impact on the education of graduate
students at Stanford and beyond.
