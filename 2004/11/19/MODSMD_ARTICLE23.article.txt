# The 						Big Picture
## Does the world still believe in democracy? 
### WILL NELSON 
Many people around the world
tacitly support the Iraqi Sunni in
surgents and their terrorist allies.
They heap criticism on the occupa
tion while treating the insurgents'
barbaric tactics as inevitable con
sequences of American arrogance,
as if the insurgents have no choice
but to kidnap and kill innocents.
Arab media reports lionize the
insurgents and blame their atroci
ties on criminal gangs unleashed by
the occupation, while exaggerating
every American transgression or
weakness.
European and U.N. officials
routinely opine on the illegitimacy
of the occupation but say nothing
about the insurgency's plans to re
instate tyranny in Iraq.
Their disgust for America blinds
them to the fact that their tacit sup
port of the insurgency amounts to
rooting for continued bloodshed
and Saddam-style oppression in
Iraq.
They have given up on democ
racy, preferring instead contempt
for America. They want America
to bleed, no matter how many in
nocent Iraqis must also bleed with
them.
It's no secret that many around
the world emphatically object to
the legitimacy of the American oc
cupation. No doubt the world will
debate the wisdom and legitimacy
of the invasion for decades to
come.
But what is done is done. At this
point, more people must realize
that the insurgency is a disaster for

Iraqis and their best hope now is
total victory by the occupation.
I can only imagine the bitterness
and outrage many would feel to
read such a comment by an arro
gant American. They insist the oc
cupation is the real disaster in Iraq,
not the insurgency.
I can understand their fury, but
what would happen if the insurgen
cy prevailed today? And what if
the insurgency ended today?
The insurgents rally around one
goal: ending the occupation. It is
axiomatic to them and many others
that the occupation is evil. The
sooner it ends, the better — with
out exception.
But if the occupation ended
today, the Sunni hegemony would
be reborn — they seem to have all
the weapons and aren't too keen
on democracy. A new dictator
would rise to occupy Saddam's
palaces, toy with the United Na
tions and oppress the Iraqi people.
Many Iraqi Shiites and Kurds
realize this. They don't like the oc
cupation, but they support elec
tions. Their patience and foresight
on this matter is admirable.
The administration's goal for
Iraq is clear: It wants democracy.
Bush is betting the ranch on Jan
uary elections to choose a national
assembly that will draft a perma
nent constitution.
Sure, the administration has
other goals in mind. Going into the
war. Bush wanted to remove a bru
tal dictator who defied the United
Nations and threatened the United
States fora decade. He wanted to
destroy stockpiles of weapons of

mass destruction that turned out
not to exist. These goals are long
behind us.
The administration also would
like to see Iraq become an Ameri
can ally and make peace with Is
rael. It wants to see a stable Iraq
that pumps oil to feed the world
economy, not to mention Ameri
can SUVs.
These goals sound terribly sinis
ter to many around the world. But
America is not coercing Iraq to
meet these goals. It is coercing the
Iraqi people to accept democracy
— which many accept anyway —
with the hope that the Iraqi people
will freely choose more amicable
economic and foreign policies.
But America cannot coerce Iraq
to pump cheap oil or to be nice to
Israel.
This strategy may or may not be
naive. But letting the people of
Iraq choose the fate of their nation
for the first time in their history is
decidedly not sinister.
The time has long since passed
for the world to take the right side
on the Iraq war. Political leaders
around the world must finally call
the insurgency what it is — a
movement for the return of tyran
ny and the continuation of may
hem in Iraq. They must put aside
their scorn for America and reaf
firm their belief in democracy.

meet these goals. It is coercing the
Iraqi people to accept democracy
— which many accept anyway —
with the hope that the Iraqi people
will freely choose more amicable
economic and foreign policies.
But America cannot coerce Iraq
to pump cheap oil or to be nice to
Israel.
This strategy may or may not be
naive. But letting the people of
Iraq choose the fate of their nation
for the first time in their history is
decidedly not sinister.
The time has long since passed
for the world to take the right side
on the Iraq war. Political leaders
around the world must finally call
the insurgency what it is — a
movement for the return of tyran
ny and the continuation of may
hem in Iraq. They must put aside
their scorn for America and reaf
firm their belief in democracy.
