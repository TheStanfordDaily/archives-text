# Irrational Exuberance
## Why America's media sucks 
### 
Media herding is some
thing that always
piqued my interest.
During the Clinton ad
ministration, church burning sud
denly became a big issue. It seemed
like the news was reporting a new
incident every other week.
They held Congressional hear
ings. Important men fulminated
about the rampant problem of
racism.

Then you look
at the data, and
the number of
church burnings
had been de
creasing mono
tonically for as
long as data was
available. In fact,
it was at an all
time low that year.

The only thing
that changed was the media cover
age.
A few years ago, the big media
story was shark attacks; lots of scary
articles warning about shark at
tacks. Yet again, looking at the data,
the numbers were tiny — less than
the chance of getting struck by light
ening — and again, there were
fewer attacks than in previous years.
A year ago, it was kidnappings of
young white girls, though once
again, the number of kidnapping
has also been declining.
Court cases are particularly
amusing. Why is Scott Peterson so
prominent, when there are lots of
murders each year that people ig
nore?
One possible explanation is that
the media is only giving the public
what it wants to hear.
When one media outlet figures
out a story that resonates with the
people, the others just jump on the
bandwagon and copy it. Once the
media makes a big fuss, people start
to think the story is important, and it
feeds on itself — a vicious cycle of
triviality.
The question to ask is how prob
lematic is it?
Having this deluge of stories
around a few select anecdotes often
gives very wrong impressions about
the actual state of the world.
The problem is that statistics and
data are boring. They lack salience.
People are much more likely to re
member the poor woman with
ragged clothes and disheveled hair
than arcane numbers about those in
poverty.
I read Time magazine every
week. I am bothered by the fact that

most of their news articles are pri
marily based on random quotes
from random people across the
country.
Who are these people? In a story
about unemployment, they inter
view three random people and
somehow think they have provided
a complete picture of the problem.
I remember a few years ago,
there was the Million Mom March
in Washington, D.C. where women
showed up protesting the lack of
child safety locks on guns. They
probably had in mind the horrible
stories they saw in papers about lit
tle kids who accidentally shoot
themselves.
Economist Steven Levitt finds
that, statistically, having a swim
ming pool in a house is 100 times
more deadly to children than having
a gun. Levitt's point is not that we
should have more guns, but that we
spend so much time worrying about
guns that we forget about safe
guarding our children from far more
significant dangers.
Hepatitis and malaria — both
preventable diseases — kill more
people a year in Africa than AIDS,
yet AIDS gets all the media atten
tion and more funding. AIDS is just
a sexier disease than malaria. Lack
of awareness has serious conse
quences.
Despite my general pessimistic
view on the selective focus on social
issues by the American populace,
this is one area where I do think ed
ucation can work.
It needs to start here. Harvard
— yes, the Stanford of the East —
actually had the good idea in re
quiring a statistics class for all of its
undergraduates. The university
wants its students to find meaning
in statistics and be aware of their
potential misuse.
An old definition of a scientist is
someone who can get excited by a
page of numbers. But we need ev
eryone to get excited.
An informal poll of federal
judges found that the great majority
could not define the following
words; mean, mode and median.
At the very least, we need re
porters to be educated. It may be
that salient anecdotes are the only
means to get their point across. So
far, they haven't been driving the
right point home.

ragged clothes and disheveled hair
than arcane numbers about those in
poverty.
I read Time magazine every
week. I am bothered by the fact that

most of their news articles are pri
marily based on random quotes
from random people across the
country.
Who are these people? In a story
about unemployment, they inter
view three random people and
somehow think they have provided
a complete picture of the problem.
I remember a few years ago,
there was the Million Mom March
in Washington, D.C. where women
showed up protesting the lack of
child safety locks on guns. They
probably had in mind the horrible
stories they saw in papers about lit
tle kids who accidentally shoot
themselves.
Economist Steven Levitt finds
that, statistically, having a swim
ming pool in a house is 100 times
more deadly to children than having
a gun. Levitt's point is not that we
should have more guns, but that we
spend so much time worrying about
guns that we forget about safe
guarding our children from far more
significant dangers.
Hepatitis and malaria — both
preventable diseases — kill more
people a year in Africa than AIDS,
yet AIDS gets all the media atten
tion and more funding. AIDS is just
a sexier disease than malaria. Lack
of awareness has serious conse
quences.
Despite my general pessimistic
view on the selective focus on social
issues by the American populace,
this is one area where I do think ed
ucation can work.
It needs to start here. Harvard
— yes, the Stanford of the East —
actually had the good idea in re
quiring a statistics class for all of its
undergraduates. The university
wants its students to find meaning
in statistics and be aware of their
potential misuse.
An old definition of a scientist is
someone who can get excited by a
page of numbers. But we need ev
eryone to get excited.
An informal poll of federal
judges found that the great majority
could not define the following
words; mean, mode and median.
At the very least, we need re
porters to be educated. It may be
that salient anecdotes are the only
means to get their point across. So
far, they haven't been driving the
right point home.
