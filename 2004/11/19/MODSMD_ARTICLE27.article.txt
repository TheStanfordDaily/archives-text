Humor targeted at minorities not
wortny of publication
As members of the Black Stu
dent Union, reading the editorial by
Amanda Burley and Jackson
Brossy truly "hit home" for us.
Once a people represented by
pictures of "Jamimas" and "Sam
bos," we fully throw our support
behind SAIO in their thus far on
going struggle to have The Review
and its constituents respond to
their pleas with cultural sensitivity.
The Stanford Review notes that
we still don't know what our mascot
is, but we still feel it is important to
note that we know very clearly what
it is not.
Unfortunately, current students
lack institutional memory to fully
understand the great lengths the

Native American community went
through over 30 years ago.
Students forget that the latest in
cidents of hate speech were not 20
or 50 years ago hut documented
within the past five years.
Students forget that humor tar
geted at minority groups — be it
women, ethnic or otherwise — is
not worthy of publication. Freedom
of speech is one thing, yet it is igno
rance that makes necessary the end
less race dialogues and the Cultural
Awareness Associate program on
this campus.
The idea that today on Stan
ford's campus. The Review feels
comfortable publishing "Smoke
Signals" says something about our
campus.
We commend the Stanford
America Indian Organization re

sponding to this ignorance with its
only cure — knowledge.

Stanford should continue to
promote diversity and community
The historical oppression that
Native Americans have endured
and continue to experience is a
negative aspect still prevalent in
today's society. It is a sad fact that
discrimination has been a factor
since the beginning of America's
history.
It is important to acknowledge
the injustices that have surrounded
the Native American community

and to work towards fostering a
comfortable environment — espe
cially here at Stanford.
The Stanford community prides
itself in promoting diversity and in
being a welcoming community. It
is supposed to provide an environ
ment where everyone is accepted
and cultures are embraced, rather
than attacked or ignored.
Although there has been some
progress, there have also been
some deterrents and obstacles in
achieving these goals.
The fact that a conservative
newspaper, which uses the Stan
ford name, can use a Native
American caricature to depict
negative stereotypes is proof that
Stanford's goal of providing a wel
coming environment is far from
being a reality.

As part of the Stanford commu
nity, it is essential for us to provide
an appropriate setting where ev
eryone is welcome and feels as
though they belong.
It is important to learn about
the continuing pejorative portray
als of Native Americans that are
present both on and off campus.

Review should have greater
respect for Native Americans
As fellow members of the minor
ity student community, we agree
with the sentiments expressed in
Amanda Burley and Jackson
Brossy's Nov. 17 op-ed.
As an institution, Stanford

prides itself on the diversity of its
student body. And as students, we
interact daily with peers of differ
ent backgrounds.
Stanford students owe it to their
peers to be ever-conscious of the
impact that hurtful stereotypical
images, such as the repeatedly
published "Smoke Signals" insert
by The Review, have on the
greater community.
We join SAIO in asking that the
entire Stanford community and
the Stanford Review in particular
afford greater respect to students
of all backgrounds.
