## Cardinal topple UW 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team has officially hit its stride.
If the No. 1 team in the nation is the
pinnacle of volleyball, then the No. 9
Cardinal climbed Mount Everest and
jammed their flag in its peak last night.
Stanford knocked off top-ranked and
previously undefeated Washington 3-2
(28-30, 11-30, 30-27, 34-32, 20-18), in a
five-game thriller at Burnham Pavilion.
Stanford improves to 20-6 overall (12-3
Pacific-10 Conference), while the
Huskies drop to 22-1 (14-1 Pac-10).
Trailing 14-13 in the decisive fifth
f ,..me, Stanford tied the game to force
overtime. Washington had five match
points and Stanford three before the
Cardinal finally capped their dramatic
comebac — from being down two
games to none and 8-3 in game five —
with an ace off a jumpserve from senior
outside hitter Jenn Hucke.
Washington looked like it would
leave the Farm with an easy victory
after taking the first two games. The
Huskies had some breaks go their way

in the early going of game one, as they
seemed to catch all the lines in taking a
9-4 lead before Stanford called its first
timeout.
Stanford came charging back out of
the timeout, passing crisply, using the
block, and picking up four straight
points to force a Washington timeout,
trailing by only one at 14-13. Stanford
took its second timeout after tying the
score at 15, only to fall back to 20-16.
Stanford tied it as late as 26, but saw
Washington put together a small run to
reach game point at 29-26. A kill from
freshman outside hitter Christal Morri
son finished the Cardinal off in game
one.
Game two was an abomination for
Stanford. The Cardinal were unable to
put a good pass on the ball because of
tough serving by Washington and fell
behind 21-10 before Dunning made a
lineup change.
