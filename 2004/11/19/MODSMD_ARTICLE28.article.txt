## Cardinal topple UW 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team has officially hit its stride.
If the No. 1 team in the nation is the
pinnacle of volleyball, then the No. 9
Cardinal climbed Mount Everest and
jammed their flag in its peak last night.
Stanford knocked off top-ranked and
previously undefeated Washington 3-2
(28-30, 11-30, 30-27, 34-32, 20-18), in a
five-game thriller at Burnham Pavilion.
Stanford improves to 20-6 overall (12-3
Pacific-10 Conference), while the
Huskies drop to 22-1 (14-1 Pac-10).
Trailing 14-13 in the decisive fifth
f ,..me, Stanford tied the game to force
overtime. Washington had five match
points and Stanford three before the
Cardinal finally capped their dramatic
comebac — from being down two
games to none and 8-3 in game five —
with an ace off a jumpserve from senior
outside hitter Jenn Hucke.
Washington looked like it would
leave the Farm with an easy victory
after taking the first two games. The
Huskies had some breaks go their way

in the early going of game one, as they
seemed to catch all the lines in taking a
9-4 lead before Stanford called its first
timeout.
Stanford came charging back out of
the timeout, passing crisply, using the
block, and picking up four straight
points to force a Washington timeout,
trailing by only one at 14-13. Stanford
took its second timeout after tying the
score at 15, only to fall back to 20-16.
Stanford tied it as late as 26, but saw
Washington put together a small run to
reach game point at 29-26. A kill from
freshman outside hitter Christal Morri
son finished the Cardinal off in game
one.
Game two was an abomination for
Stanford. The Cardinal were unable to
put a good pass on the ball because of
tough serving by Washington and fell
behind 21-10 before Dunning made a
lineup change.
Sophomore outside hitter Njideka
Nnamani came in for fellow sophomore
outside hitter Kristin Richards, but the
switch did not help. A frustrated Cardi-
nal team went on to drop game two, as a block by the
Huskies mercifully ended the frame, 30-11.
Stanford left whatever was on its mind during game
two in the locker room at halftime. The competitive
team that almost took game one was back on the court
for game three. Led by Ogonna Nnamani, who tallied a
career-high 37 kills, the Cardinal played the Huskies
tight through the first half of the game. Trailing 15-13
coming out of the media timeout, the Cardinal record
ed three consecutive kills to a take a one-point lead.
Ogonna Nnamani tallied three of her 12 kills in the
game after Washington used its final timeout with the
game tied at 24, and senior defensive specialist Leahi
Hall dropped in a service ace for the 30-27 win.
Game four saw four ties as neither team led by
more than two points. Washington called the first
timeout of the game trailing 12-10 after a sneaky kill
by freshman setter Bryn Kehoe. With the Cardinal
leading 15-14, McLaughlin made a substitution, plac
ing senior outside hitter Sanja Tomasevic, who was
nursing an injured hand, into the game for the first
time. Washington opened up a 25-Ilead, but Stan
ford wasn't done just yet. Three consecutive Cardinal
points forced a Huskies timeout, and Stanford contin
ued to roll, tying the game at 25. Washington scored
four of the next five points, however, to reach match
point. But the Cardinal battled back once again to
force overtime and used a miraculous dig by Richards
and a battle at the net won by Kehoe to set up the de
cisive final game.
Stanford will be back in action tonight at 7:00 p.m.
against Washington State. The home crowd will say
goodbye to the Cardinal's three seniors: Hall, Hucke
and Ogonna Nnamani.

trailing by only one at 14-13. Stanford
took its second timeout after tying the
score at 15, only to fall back to 20-16.
Stanford tied it as late as 26, but saw
Washington put together a small run to
reach game point at 29-26. A kill from
freshman outside hitter Christal Morri
son finished the Cardinal off in game
one.
Game two was an abomination for
Stanford. The Cardinal were unable to
put a good pass on the ball because of
tough serving by Washington and fell
behind 21-10 before Dunning made a
lineup change.
Sophomore outside hitter Njideka
Nnamani came in for fellow sophomore
outside hitter Kristin Richards, but the
switch did not help. A frustrated Cardi-
nal team went on to drop game two, as a block by the
Huskies mercifully ended the frame, 30-11.
Stanford left whatever was on its mind during game
two in the locker room at halftime. The competitive
team that almost took game one was back on the court
for game three. Led by Ogonna Nnamani, who tallied a
career-high 37 kills, the Cardinal played the Huskies
tight through the first half of the game. Trailing 15-13
coming out of the media timeout, the Cardinal record
ed three consecutive kills to a take a one-point lead.
Ogonna Nnamani tallied three of her 12 kills in the
game after Washington used its final timeout with the
game tied at 24, and senior defensive specialist Leahi
Hall dropped in a service ace for the 30-27 win.
Game four saw four ties as neither team led by
more than two points. Washington called the first
timeout of the game trailing 12-10 after a sneaky kill
by freshman setter Bryn Kehoe. With the Cardinal
leading 15-14, McLaughlin made a substitution, plac
ing senior outside hitter Sanja Tomasevic, who was
nursing an injured hand, into the game for the first
time. Washington opened up a 25-Ilead, but Stan
ford wasn't done just yet. Three consecutive Cardinal
points forced a Huskies timeout, and Stanford contin
ued to roll, tying the game at 25. Washington scored
four of the next five points, however, to reach match
point. But the Cardinal battled back once again to
force overtime and used a miraculous dig by Richards
and a battle at the net won by Kehoe to set up the de
cisive final game.
Stanford will be back in action tonight at 7:00 p.m.
against Washington State. The home crowd will say
goodbye to the Cardinal's three seniors: Hall, Hucke
and Ogonna Nnamani.
