# STANFORD vs. USF
## 
### 
Stanford and San Francisco
will renew an old rivalry with new
head coaches when they meet for
the 64th time — but the first time
since 1995 — at the Pete Newell
Challenge in Oakland. Stanford
coach Trent Johnson hopes he
doesn't have to wait as long to
pick up his first regular-season
win with his new team as the man
he replaced (Mike Montgomery
started 0-6 with the Warriors),
while former Louisiana-Lafayette
coach Jessie Evans takes over for
Phil Matthews at USF.
The Cardinal are 6-0 all-time
in the Pete Newell Challenge, in
cluding an 87-80 victory over
Gonzaga last season and a mem
orable last-second win over
then-No. 1 Duke in 2000. Santa

Clara will take on No. 3 North
Carolina in the first game of the
double-header.
