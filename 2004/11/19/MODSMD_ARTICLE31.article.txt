# Wrestling opens dual season
## Stanford hopes to build on last season's success in 2004-05 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming off a 10-win season and the
crowning of its first individual national
champion in school history, expecta
tions are even higher for the Stanford
wrestling team as the Cardinal open
their dual-meet season tonight at Cal
State-Fullerton. Stanford will compete
in the California Open on Saturday.
This weekend will mark the second
competition of the season for 13 Cardi
nal wrestlers who competed at the
Central Missouri Open last Sunday.
Stanford finished fourth overall at the
event.
"The team and the coaches were very
pleased with our results at the Central
Missouri Open," said head coach Steve
Buddie. "We like to start with an open
tournament because it gives us an op
portunity to look at our conditioning
and progress. I am very excited that this
year we doubled the number of place
winners from last year."
Success came in bunches in Missouri,
as the Cardinal's place winners included
freshmen Scott Loescher (fifth at 165)
and Josh Zupancic (second at 149), ju
niors Ryan Hagen (sixth at 184) and
Imad Kharbush (fourth at 174) and se
nior Nathan Peterson (fourth at 125).
Sophomore Tanner Gardner took home
first-place honors with a 2-1 win over
Missouri's Austin Devoe.
Senior co-captain Matt Gentry, who
did not compete in Missouri, went 42-0
last season en route to the Pac-10 and
NCAA titles at 157 pounds. Gentry has
his sights set on a return trip to NCAAs
and enters the season tied with Buddie
for the most career wins in school histo

ry (109).
While Gentry and his fellow upper
classmen should carry the team, the Car
dinal's underclassmen will also con
tribute, as exemplified by the strong
showings of Gardner, Zupancic and
Loeshcer.
"One of our challenges is we have a
lot of new faces on the team," Buddie
said. "But we have a very strong
strength of schedule, and seeing Michi
gan and lowa State during the season
will give us a lot of experience. We want
to get experience, be injury free and im
prove."
The Cardinal finished 10-4 in dual
meets and 6-2 in the Pac-10 last season
and placed fifth at the Pac-10 tourna
ment. Stanford finished 19th as a team at
NCAAs, primarily thanks to Gentry's
historic run.
"I think that we're very talented top
to bottom," Buddie said. "Add to that
the great work ethic our wrestlers have,
and our expectations are high."
This season the Cardinal coaching
staff is trying to encourage its wrestlers
to focus on how they wrestle instead of
strictly on results.
"We used to set really specific goals
but we've realized that it's better to just
try and wrestle a certain way," Buddie
said. "We want to go out and have dy
namic and exciting wrestling. If we wres
tle that way we'll have success. In a more
concrete sense, our ultimate goals are to
win our first Pac-10 title and finish in the
top 20 of the national rankings."
Stanford's first challenge will be Cal
State-Fullerton, which is coming off a
23-12 loss to Navy.
"Cal State-Fullerton has three re
turning NCAA qualifiers," Buddie said.
"We're not going to take them lightly,
because it could be pretty even. But
every time we go out we expect to win."
On Saturday, Stanford will compete
in the California Open at Fullerton.
"The great thing about the tourna

ment is everyone who wants to wrestle
gets to this weekend," Buddie said.
"Having the whole team compete is a
morale-booster for the season. It's also
nice to be able to see a lot of the Pac-10
teams at the California Open. We've got
a team of believers this year."
The season will be a long haul, and
staying injury-free is of paramount im
portance to the Cardinal. All the old

sports cliches apply as Stanford at
tempts to continue building as a na
tional power.
"A lot of teams start strong and then
get worse," Buddie said. "We want to
keep making progress and going for
ward."
Stanford's push starts today at 2:30
p.m. at Titan Gym in Fullerton and con
tinues Saturday at 9 a.m.
