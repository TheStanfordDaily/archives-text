# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## Reflections from the back of the bus 
### 
I'm in a bus right now. That's where I'm
spending the last moments of my career. In a
bus driving back from Berkeley, with my last
game for the Stanford soccer team ending like
a terrible first date, the worst loss I've felt in
five years. In a game that would decide our

NCAA tournament fate, we
lost 3-2 in double overtime.
I used to cry in these situ
ations. I used to get so emo
tionally invested in my teams
that the end of the season
would get me to break down.
Even if we won our last
game, I wouldn't be able to
take it. I would privately, or
more often publicly; in front
of beautiful women, just put

my head in my hands and let it all go.
But my eyes are dry as we hit the Dumbar
ton Bridge, passing the abandoned radio
tower sitting in the silt, the soft yellow spill of
the freeway allowing me to see my teammates
sitting in front of me.
I'm in a bus right now. I'm sitting in the
back corner of the back row, looking ahead to
29 of my friends, teammates and coaches, and
the only sounds getting to me are the tires hit
ting the expansion gaps on the road below.
I'm in a bus with some of my best friends,
some teammates that I will draw upon for the
rest of my life, and coaches that stuck their
hand out fora walk-on third-string goalkeep
er with questionable skills.
I'm in a bus with an athletic trainer who is
waiting for us at 5 a.m., who takes no vacation,
and who says he is atheist only because Sun
days are game days.
I'm in a bus with a coach whose wife opens
up her house for us to eat on Sunday morn
ings, on Thanksgiving afternoons, but really,
any time.
I'm in a bus with a New Zealander, a Mis
sissippian and a Jamaican, and they're all in
my fantasy basketball league. I'm with
friends, I'm with classmates, I'm with co
workers.
But right now, and it pains me so much to
say this, I'm in a bus with my team, and we
came up short. I'm in a bus with a team that


Spcncer Porter
should have made the tournament,
that should have had a shot at the na
tional title, that should have beaten
Cal. But we didn't; they won, and I'm
just in the back of the bus, hoping no
body talks to me.
I just can't escape the loss.
Five years ago, 1 was a junior on my
high school varsity team. Throughout
the season, we had been playing on
our new Field Turf, an artificial field
that perfectly replicates grass — soft
bounces, true rolls and perfect lines.
We had played well, well enough to
make the state section playoffs, which
mandated that we travel three hours
north to Boonville for our first-round
game.

'Twas a sad, sad ride home

Boonville, 120 miles north of San
Francisco, is exactly how it sounds.
Boonville. It's an isolated ranching
community in the. well, boonies, so
remote that locals speak in a bona fide
dialect of English. But the locals don't
play soccer — their employees do, ex
plaining how the largely Hispanic
squad is motivated by giant posters
proclaiming ";Si Se Puede!" all along
the tield.
Well, it wasn't much of a field, as
most of the rodeo stadium (that's right,
rodeo stadium) had a floor of dirt —
the chalk lines indistinguishable against
the burned outline of the field.
The game was close, mostly a physi
cal battle between two unrelenting

sides. I was sitting on the sidelines for
this one as well, unable to do a god
damned thing when they got a counter
attack. I could only watch from the end
of the bench as their attacker handled
the ball, pushed it past our defender,
laid it on his right foot and slotted it past
our goalkeeper. I could only scream as
the referee awarded the goal. I could
only hang my head when their coach
met ours after the game, embarrassed
that they could only win by a mistake.
I was in a van then, surrounded by
crying teenagers, all of whom were
crushed by the loss. But I didn't break
down until the next day, when our team
captain went around to every single
player, handing out a quote by Jacob

Riis. The quote? "Some defeats are
only installments to victory."
It's tough to see that as Cal scores in
the 88th minute to tie it up. It's tough to
see that as we don't get selected to the
NCAA tournament. But it's toughest to
see that from the back of the bus, at the
end of your career.
Nuke LaLoosh will tell you, "Some
times you win, sometimes you lose,
sometimes it rains," but sometimes,
you're in the back of the bus, and
there's nothing you can do about it.

Spencer Porter hopes you will be in the
back — or middle, or front — of a bus to
Berkeley tomorrow. E-mail him at
