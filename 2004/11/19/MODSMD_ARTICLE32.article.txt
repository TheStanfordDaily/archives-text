# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## Reflections from the back of the bus 
### 
I'm in a bus right now. That's where I'm
spending the last moments of my career. In a
bus driving back from Berkeley, with my last
game for the Stanford soccer team ending like
a terrible first date, the worst loss I've felt in
five years. In a game that would decide our

NCAA tournament fate, we
lost 3-2 in double overtime.
I used to cry in these situ
ations. I used to get so emo
tionally invested in my teams
that the end of the season
would get me to break down.
Even if we won our last
game, I wouldn't be able to
take it. I would privately, or
more often publicly; in front
of beautiful women, just put

my head in my hands and let it all go.
But my eyes are dry as we hit the Dumbar

waiting for us at 5 a.m., who takes no vacation,
and who says he is atheist only because Sun
days are game days.
I'm in a bus with a coach whose wife opens
up her house for us to eat on Sunday morn
ings, on Thanksgiving afternoons, but really,
any time.
I'm in a bus with a New Zealander, a Mis
sissippian and a Jamaican, and they're all in
my fantasy basketball league. I'm with
friends, I'm with classmates, I'm with co
workers.
But right now, and it pains me so much to
say this, I'm in a bus with my team, and we
came up short. I'm in a bus with a team that
