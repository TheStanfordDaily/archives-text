# No. 2 Cardinal travel to Cal for Big Splash
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Would it be presumptuous to
say that the outcome of tomor
row's California / Stanford
matchup is predictable? Of course
not — Stanford is clearly the fa
vorite. And just to make things
clear, we're talking about the Stan
ford's No. 2 men's water polo team
(19-3, 7-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation).
Before Big Game, there's Big
Splash, which will also be held at
Berkeley. The Cardinal are ex
pected to rack up their third win
against the No. 4 Golden Bears
this season. Aside from previously
dominating Cal (18-8, 3-5 MPSF)
12-7 twice this season, Stanford
has the top scoring and goalkeep
ing tandem in the MPSF for the
Bears to contend with.
Despite their success against
Cal and the majority of the other
teams they have faced, however,

the Cardinal are second in the
MPSF standings and national poll
behind conference leader and top
ranked UCLA. That won't change
unless the Cardinal can get to the
NCAAs.
Stanford, which was assured the
second seed in next week's MPSF
Tournament after the Bruins'
swept a pair of conference games
last weekend, could get another
crack at UCLA (21-2, 8-0 MPSF)
in the championship game. By
avenging a 7-4 loss to the Bruins
three weeks ago, the Cardinal
would secure a berth in the NCAA
Tournament in December.
But first, the Cardinal must deal
with the Bears. While Cal isn't a
walk in the park like No. 13 Pacific
or No. 14 UC-Davis (teams Stan
ford crushed this season), it cer
tainly isn't a tremendous chal
lenge. The Bears are just one more
stop for the Cardinal, one more
team the Cardinal have to take
care of on the schedule before

reaching their ultimate postseason
goal.
"Big Splash is always good
because it has the spirit, but in
terms of importance of our sea
son it's not as big because we
need to do well in the MPSF
Tournament to make it to
NCAAs," said junior goalkeeper
Chad Taylor. "Yet again, we
have to win this game before we
can play the rest."
A win in their regular-season fi
nale would help the Cardinal's
chances for an at-large berth
should they not win the MPSF
Tournament.

Stanford will use the game against
Cal to tinker with a few last things
before ending regular-season play.
The squad will be running out
new defenses and working with
six-on-five and five-on-six strate

gies.
All this doesn't mean that Cal
doesn't have any impressive talent
of its own. John Mann has 58 goals
this season (to Azevedo's 62),
scoring at least once in 25 games
this year. Brian Kinsel, Andre
Vasilijevic and Brian Bacharach
(42 goals) have also played well
this season.
"They're going to come out
going hard," said junior driver
Peter Varellas. "They've got a lot
of subs and they can keep guys
fresh. They're going to keep on
going on counterattack the whole
time, swimming as hard as they
can, trying to wear us down."

sophomores and freshmen, the

ence Stanford displays. While

ranked opponents.
"1 think they're young," Taylor said.
"They're still kind of figuring [it] out... That
comes with time; that comes with experience.
They should get better the more and more they
play."
Much of the responsibility to improve in de
fense lies on the shoulders of sophomore center
defender Marty Matthies, Cal's best defender,
and goalkeeper Nate Bennett, whose 6.88 goals
against average places him seventh in the league.
Stanford has scored on the Bears' defense at will
this season.
"I don't think they have enough dimension to
counter the defense, as far the combination that
we have (in] perimeter, two-meters plus goalies,"
Varellas said. "They just don't have the all
around weapons."
The tilt between the cross-bay rivals will be
their second in as many weeks. Stanford domi
nated last Saturday, due in large part to Azeve
do's six-goal performance.
The teams will play for the annual Steve Heas
ton Trophy (which Cal has won three of the past
five times) and for the advantage in the Lexus
Gauntlet series.
"This is obviously an important game fora
couple reasons," Varellas said." It's to kind of
fine-tune ourselves before heading into the
league tournament, and also it's important to win
the game because it really helps us get that mo
mentum to go to the tournament."
Big Splash is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m.

Gauntlet series.
"This is obviously an important game fora
couple reasons," Varellas said." It's to kind of
fine-tune ourselves before heading into the
league tournament, and also it's important to win
the game because it really helps us get that mo

Big Splash is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m.
Would it be presumptuous to
say that the outcome of tomor
row's California / Stanford
matchup is predictable? Of course
not — Stanford is clearly the fa
vorite. And just to make things
clear, we're talking about the Stan
ford's No. 2 men's water polo team
(19-3, 7-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation).
Before Big Game, there's Big
Splash, which will also be held at
Berkeley. The Cardinal are ex
pected to rack up their third win
against the No. 4 Golden Bears
this season. Aside from previously
dominating Cal (18-8, 3-5 MPSF)
12-7 twice this season, Stanford
has the top scoring and goalkeep
ing tandem in the MPSF for the
Bears to contend with.
Despite their success against
Cal and the majority of the other
teams they have faced, however,

the Cardinal are second in the
MPSF standings and national poll
behind conference leader and top
ranked UCLA. That won't change
unless the Cardinal can get to the
NCAAs.
Stanford, which was assured the
second seed in next week's MPSF
Tournament after the Bruins'
swept a pair of conference games
last weekend, could get another
crack at UCLA (21-2, 8-0 MPSF)
in the championship game. By
avenging a 7-4 loss to the Bruins
three weeks ago, the Cardinal
would secure a berth in the NCAA
Tournament in December.
But first, the Cardinal must deal
with the Bears. While Cal isn't a
walk in the park like No. 13 Pacific
or No. 14 UC-Davis (teams Stan
ford crushed this season), it cer
tainly isn't a tremendous chal
lenge. The Bears are just one more
stop for the Cardinal, one more
team the Cardinal have to take
care of on the schedule before

reaching their ultimate postseason
goal.
"Big Splash is always good
because it has the spirit, but in
terms of importance of our sea
son it's not as big because we
need to do well in the MPSF
Tournament to make it to
NCAAs," said junior goalkeeper
Chad Taylor. "Yet again, we
have to win this game before we
can play the rest."
A win in their regular-season fi
nale would help the Cardinal's
chances for an at-large berth
should they not win the MPSF
Tournament.

leads the conference's No. 1 of

heads a stalwart Cardinal defense.
Stanford will use the game against
Cal to tinker with a few last things
before ending regular-season play.
The squad will be running out
new defenses and working with
six-on-five and five-on-six strate

gies.
All this doesn't mean that Cal
doesn't have any impressive talent
of its own. John Mann has 58 goals
this season (to Azevedo's 62),
scoring at least once in 25 games
this year. Brian Kinsel, Andre
Vasilijevic and Brian Bacharach
(42 goals) have also played well
this season.
"They're going to come out
going hard," said junior driver
Peter Varellas. "They've got a lot
of subs and they can keep guys
fresh. They're going to keep on
going on counterattack the whole
time, swimming as hard as they
can, trying to wear us down."

sophomores and freshmen, the

ranked opponents.
"1 think they're young," Taylor said.
"They're still kind of figuring [it] out... That
comes with time; that comes with experience.
They should get better the more and more they
play."
Much of the responsibility to improve in de
fense lies on the shoulders of sophomore center
defender Marty Matthies, Cal's best defender,
and goalkeeper Nate Bennett, whose 6.88 goals
against average places him seventh in the league.
Stanford has scored on the Bears' defense at will
this season.
"I don't think they have enough dimension to
counter the defense, as far the combination that
we have (in] perimeter, two-meters plus goalies,"
Varellas said. "They just don't have the all
around weapons."
The tilt between the cross-bay rivals will be
their second in as many weeks. Stanford domi
nated last Saturday, due in large part to Azeve
do's six-goal performance.
The teams will play for the annual Steve Heas
ton Trophy (which Cal has won three of the past
five times) and for the advantage in the Lexus
Gauntlet series.
