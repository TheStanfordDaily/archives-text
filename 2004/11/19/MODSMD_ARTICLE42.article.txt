# What the... ? Big Game traditions

### TAM VO INTERMISSION EDITOR 
It even game
was Big Game
week, we'd all be
dead. On the plus
side, there's a
seemingly endless
round of free fcxxJ
and T-shirts to be
had. I lere are a
few reasons why
we may not live to
see Sunday:
1) Please don't
dioo-choo choose
me: You're ready
to gouge your cars
out with 2B pen
cils after the shrill
sound of the Axe
Com in train whis
tle pierces the air,
hour after hour,
day alter endless
day. All of your
dreams are inter-

rupted by images of railroad tycoons and robber barons for some rea
son. Your pen skitters across your notebook after the noise startles you
out of accidental sleep. The stillness of Stanford's campus is shattered
by the hourly countdown down to victory — that is, victory for that
school across the bay.
You might be able to smack the snooze button on your alarm when

it goes off in the ttk >rning. but
you can't do a damn thing
about the whistle being
blown at 4 in the morning,
and then again at 5,6 and 1...
There's a reason why Axe
Comm didn't get special tees,
and maybe this is it.
2) Flying navels: Due to the
oblivious security guard id
iots at k;il, their student body
is able to sneak in frozen or
anges to pelt Stanford's sec
tion with. Don't you think
that a third breast or oddly
bulbous lump in the crotch
area would call any atten
tion 9 Jesus tapdancing

Girist, it's not a tumor. The object of Kal student s fury is mainly the
energetic Stanford Band — its spirit refuses to he dampened, and it
continues to rock out long after the rest of the Cardinal seetk >n lias left
during the third quarter. There's something about its sheer irreverence
and rousing renditions of "The Dirty Golden Bear" that pisses off the
siifety-school kids.
If you find yourself in the 5()-fcx->t radius of the Band, please arm
yourselves with protective headgear such as hard hats and motorcy
cle helmets. Feel free to accessorize with items such as baseball bats
and potato guns to promptly return the frozen fruit to its rightful
owners.
3) Cal sniper attacks Your REM cycles have been interrupted by
these visits from our friendly neighbors, who may consist of hcx>ligans
who attempt to break into the Band Shak to steal the Tree costume or
rouse you out of bed at 3 a.m. with poorly tuned trumpets playing what

we know as "The Dirty Golden Bear" and
other unmemorable fight songs. Don't
they have anything better to do than to
drive all the way here on a Sunday night? I
guess we prefer them to U$C. These wee
nies have been leaving spray-painted and
chalked messages of "Go Cal" all over our
school, and no Cardinal has gone to paint
Kal's "C" red yet?
4) Replays upon replays of "The Play:"
Stop beating this dead horse. Unless you're
the ghost of last year's infamous mountain
lion who was shot down by Palo Alto po
lice. In that case, we won't complain.
5) Lions Tiger (Salamanders) and liears,
oh my: This whole Bonfire nonsense is get
ting out of hand. All this fuss over the en-

dangered species has got to end. Oh wait, that's why we've gotten rid
of the Bonfire rally altogether. Save the salamanders.
The backlash is that recent reports indicate that the Tiger Sala
mander population has reproduced at such rapid rates in recent years
that our campus will soon be overrun with these wonderful animals,
which are capable of obliterating the pesky black squirrels. And that
they are coated in antidote-resistant poison that will kill even the most
hardy Stanford student.
6) We really just don't give a damn: Apathy kills people. Yep. We'll
just retreat to our dorms and hit the books right after another
spanking from Oski the Bear, no doubt about it. This general stu
dent apathy is most likely due to the overwhelming spirit-rousing
originality of our traditional Big Game cheer: "Give 'em the Axe,
the Axe, the Axe, give 'em the Axe, the Axe ... right in the neck,
the neck, the neck, right in the neck, the neck, the neck!"


The Tree: More offensive than Indians, but
not as cool as robber barons.


What's funny is that he probably got hurt
