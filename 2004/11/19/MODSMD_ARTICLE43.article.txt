## NATIONAL TREASURE This is why Washington and Franklin are dead 
### TOM HANADA INTERMISSION EDITOR 
The pieces arc in place. The cred
its of the people who created "Na
tional Treasure" are just amazing. It
stars Nicholas Cage. It's directed by
Jon Turteltaub whose fame comes
from "Cool Runnings." The writers
collectively turned out works such as
"Taxi" and "Charlie's Angles: Full
Throttle." The male supporting
character's (Justin Bartha) last
major movie was a role in "Gigli."
And the producer (Jerry Bruck
heimer) also produced "Kangaroo
Jack." Clearly, all the elements have
combined to create what will surely
be great cinema.
Cage plays a historian from a fam
ily searching fora great treasure that
was hidden by the founding fathers of
the United States within historical
monuments and artifacts. He is
joined by Riley Poole (Bartha), the
sarcastic comedic relief who (luckily
for the audience) doesn't know any
thing about history and forces Cage
to explain the entire plot to him.
Their search leads them to the Decla
ration of Independence where, while

stealing it, they run into
the attractive curator of
the National Archives.
During the entire hunt,
they arc pursued by
Sean Bean's character,
lan Howe, who also
wants the treasure.
Bruckheimer has at
tempted to capitalize
on the succcss of Dan
Brown's "The Da Vinci
Code" by creating a
story where historians
find hidden clues
among well-known ar
tifacts. The conceptual

thievery is blatant
enough to even in
clude the Knights
Templar as the an
eient creators of

the clues and puyy.les. But while
"The Da Vinci Code" shocks
the reader by revealing actual
unnoticed secrets (I immediate
ly had to look at copies of "The
Last Supper" after reading),
"National Treasure" just de
cides to make up its own myths
surrounding national artifacts.
Don't expect any revelations
from this movie.
But one thing txx)k and movie
have in common is bad writing.
I*he characters are weak with lit
tle personality or depth, the plot is
predictable and the whole story
lacks any believability.
Despite these major script
flaws, Bruckheimer has once
again created a stereotypical
Hollywood movie that the au
dience can enjoy if they com
pletely suspend their disbelief.
The action line of the movie has
a little bit of everything. It starts
with an explosion that quickly
leads into a heist. The heist lasts
for all of 20 minutes before
being replaced by a car chase
which gives way to treasure
hunting. This transitions into a

pursuit and some cops against rob
bers action. It finally reaches the In
diana Jones stage before ending with
some poor character revelation.
With so many different types of
action movies slammed together,
no particular sequence stands out.
Yet, the action, in traditional
Bruckheimer style, ties the movie
together and makes the entire ex
perience forgettable but enjoyable.
So turn off your logical mind, stop
caring about characters and walk in
with low expectations. Enjoy a con
trived, forgettable but exciting ac
tion movie.
