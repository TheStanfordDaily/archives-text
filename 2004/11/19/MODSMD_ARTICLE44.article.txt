# BRIDGET JONES
## THE
						EDGE OF REASON Renee Zellweger puts the junk back in her trunk 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
Just when you thought you'd seen the last
of your favorite neurotic English weight-ob
sessed female, Bridget Jones pops up with a
brand new diary. And this time, not only will
she be taking you to the Turkey Curry Buf
fet, but she'll be accompanied by a
boyfriend. Hurrah! Cue "Sound of Music"
dream-sequence.
As you may recall, when we last left Brid
get (Renee Zellweger), she had just gotten
herself a new job at "Sit Up Britain" and was
happily attached to

none other than the
dreamy Mr. Mark
Darcy (Colin Firth).
He's a human rights
lawyer, you know.
But if you were
worried that Brid
get would settle
down — eschewing
man-chasing, hair
brained weight-loss

schemes, and/or Daniel Cleaver (Hugh
Grant) — never fear. Bridget will not let you
down.
Instead of settling into a ho-hum pattern
of lovey-dovey duplicity in her relationship
with Mark, Bridget is just as neurotic and ex
travagant as ever. Trying to impress Mark's
fellow lawyers and colleagues, especially one-
Ms. Rebecca Giles (Jacinda Barrett), Brid
get spends the majority of the first half of the
film sticking her foot in her mouth.
As you might guess, this inevitably leads
to disaster, break-up and incarceration in
Thailand. Actually, alleged drug smuggling
and Daniel Cleaver lead to incarceration in
Thailand.

That's right, ever one to show up at the
most inappropriate of moments, Bridget's
bad-boy boss from the first film. Daniel
Cleaver, resurfaces as the host of a popular
television program, "The Smooth Guide."
And boy, is he sm(X)ther than ever. So
smooth that he almost seduces Bridget as
they travel Thailand as part of their televi
sion series. Almost.
The difference between the first and sec
ond "Bridget Jones" films, then, is that the
characters have been allowed to grow and
change. Bridget may be just as psychologi
cally screwed up as she always has been, but

at least she's learned
from her mistakes. Not
only is this a pleasant
surprise, but it is a true
sequel rarity.
While the tone of the
movie fluctuates a bit
unevenly between the
relationship-heavy
focus of the first half of
the film to the Thai
land-action-adventure
I h iir •'RrirW.t Innnc"

focus of the second half. "Bridget Jones"
never falters in its dead-on comic delivery.
Both the deft Ms. Zellweger and the pol
ished Mr. Firth make the romance of the film
highly satisfying, and Hugh Grant practical
ly steals the show (once again) as the delight
fully despicable ex-boyfriend you love to
hate.
In the end. "Bridget Jones" is highly suc
cessful. both as an adaptation of Helen Field
ing's beloved novels and as a film in general
because it is smart, witty, hilarious and em
barrassing. In short, the gang's back, intact
and sparkling — and if you'd like to come
over for turkey curry, they'd love to have
you.
