### JESUS H. CHRIST INTERMISSION SPONGEOPHILE 
Q: Wluit are some of the difficulties in transferring what Ls essentially a
20-minute cartoon into an hour-and half movie? How do you keep
people who have ADD from leaving the theater?
STEPHEN HILLENBERG: It definitely is a greater challenge in
some ways. Our experience was really writing 11-minute shows,
not even 22-minute. In the series we focused a lot on trying to keep
it very simple and do these storylines where there are not a lot of
B-plots in a way. I think that is what can be charming about the
show. But when you do a 75-minute movie, that becomes difficult.
And the reason we did the movie was we wanted to try to tackle a
larger story with greater stakes. We tried to write a story that had
an art for "Spongeßob," something where he actually goes
through a growth in the movie, where he has an arc, which was a
challenge we never had to deal with before. With animation, I
think, the challenge is to keep people interested for an hour and 15
minutes.
0:1 heard that David I lasselhoff will lx' in the movie. Was it hard get
ting him? Was he keen on it'? Or who came to who?
SH: It was great. David, we basically wrote him into the story without
asking him. which Ls a really dangerous tiling to do when you are under
a tight deadline like we are. But we built the story. We found this s|X)t
where we wanted a human and we needed a person that we associated
with the ocean like Jacques Cousteau or something and David Hassel
hoff Ix'came the person to represent basically the quintessential lite
guard in media. So, we wrote him into the story and—crossing our fin
gers — I just called. And he was. th;uik goodness, he was 1()0 percent
behind it, 110 percent. He said, "I would love to do it." 1 le didn't even
think about it. He has kids <ind they love the show.
Q: Does the Hoff sing in the movie?
SH: 1 le doesn't. We talked about asking him to sing in the credits, al
though we have other great music in the credits. 1 think we didn't want

to go too far with the Hasselhoff spice. I tliink it worked out great I
don't think we needed any songs from him because his performance is
so over the top and really funny, in our opinion.
Q: Will Sponge Bob ever grow up in TV or in film? Don't sponges have
expiration dates?
SH: Well, technically the way we U eat him in the series and in the movie
is that he Ls a man. I mean, I don't know wliat liis age is exactly, but he
is wliat you would call a boy man. He Ls a man in that he has a job and
he pays the rent and he is not staving with his parents, so technically I
think most people consider that to be an adult. He Ls a man but he is a
childlike one, and 1 think he will always be like that. Ultimately this
movie Ls reinforcing the importance of a childlike perspective and
keeping it in life. In a sense, they go to save the town and they do be
cause of what they are and how they act and I think ultimately in the
movie, we are saying,' "There Ls a great resource in our upcoming gen
erations of kids. They have all the new ideas."
Q: There are a lot of mature a) ncepts in the show that are definitely
not something I'd understand as a six-year old. How do you manage
to make those so funny to kids?
SH: I think that we just try to. My answer really is that we write for our
selves. I have a team of very talented, very imaginative writers that also
draw ;ind we usually try to make ourselves laugh. We are not neces
sarily trying to be "intelligent" but I think we try' to write things that are
more about humorous situations and about characters and their flaws.
If it works, I think it is the best fomi of humor in that it is more ever
lasting. We really try to focus on character driven humor and trying to
stay away from topiail humor.
(£You studied natural resource planning, marine biology ;uid you ex
periment with animation techniques. How the hell did all these things
combine in "Spongeßob"?
SH: It Ls a really odd thing. I have iilways been interested in painting and
have drawn and been an artist my whole life. But when I went to school
I was interested in science, trying to do sometliing else, something I

guess you could say was m< >re academic. 11umboldt
State University has a program in their natural
resources department that you can design —
my program was called Natural Resource Plan
ning and Interpretation with an Emphasis in
Marine Resources. Technically, it's not a ma
rine biology degree but most of the curriculum
was what you would take for marine biology
minus some of the chemistry. Later, I worked
in the field of marine science education at the
Ocean Institute in Dana Point, but after a while
1 really wanted to get back to the arts and ani
mation was becoming really interesting to me
because it just seems like there is a limitless po
tential and so I looked into schools. I went Cal
Arts, studied experimental animation and af
terwards 1 worked at that [Nickelodeon] show,
"Rocko's Modern Life." and learned a lot
about making animation. And at a certain point
there it dawned on me that if 1 were to do an an
imal show there was all this stuff that I am in
terested in that really no one has ever animat-

ed. Things like plankton and just an entire undersea world, so it
just collided at a certain point in my head.
Q: Are you surprised with the suocess of "Spongeßob"?
SH: To give a short answer to that — you have to imagine you write a
show about a sponge and you think that maybe a few people will think
it is funny, some college students, but it takes off. It Is truly shocking. Yes.
I mean it is to the point where it is bizarre.

where we wanted a human and we needed a person that we associated
with the ocean like Jacques Cousteau or something and David Hassel
hoff Ix'came the person to represent basically the quintessential lite
guard in media. So, we wrote him into the story and—crossing our fin
gers — I just called. And he was. th;uik goodness, he was 1()0 percent
behind it, 110 percent. He said, "I would love to do it." 1 le didn't even
think about it. He has kids <ind they love the show.
Q: Does the Hoff sing in the movie?
SH: 1 le doesn't. We talked about asking him to sing in the credits, al
though we have other great music in the credits. 1 think we didn't want

to go too far with the Hasselhoff spice. I tliink it worked out great I
don't think we needed any songs from him because his performance is
so over the top and really funny, in our opinion.
Q: Will Sponge Bob ever grow up in TV or in film? Don't sponges have
expiration dates?
SH: Well, technically the way we U eat him in the series and in the movie
is that he Ls a man. I mean, I don't know wliat liis age is exactly, but he
is wliat you would call a boy man. He Ls a man in that he has a job and
he pays the rent and he is not staving with his parents, so technically I
think most people consider that to be an adult. He Ls a man but he is a
childlike one, and 1 think he will always be like that. Ultimately this
movie Ls reinforcing the importance of a childlike perspective and
keeping it in life. In a sense, they go to save the town and they do be
cause of what they are and how they act and I think ultimately in the
movie, we are saying,' "There Ls a great resource in our upcoming gen
erations of kids. They have all the new ideas."
Q: There are a lot of mature a) ncepts in the show that are definitely
not something I'd understand as a six-year old. How do you manage
to make those so funny to kids?
SH: I think that we just try to. My answer really is that we write for our
selves. I have a team of very talented, very imaginative writers that also
draw ;ind we usually try to make ourselves laugh. We are not neces
sarily trying to be "intelligent" but I think we try' to write things that are
more about humorous situations and about characters and their flaws.
If it works, I think it is the best fomi of humor in that it is more ever
lasting. We really try to focus on character driven humor and trying to
stay away from topiail humor.
(£You studied natural resource planning, marine biology ;uid you ex
periment with animation techniques. How the hell did all these things
combine in "Spongeßob"?
SH: It Ls a really odd thing. I have iilways been interested in painting and
have drawn and been an artist my whole life. But when I went to school
I was interested in science, trying to do sometliing else, something I

guess you could say was m< >re academic. 11umboldt
State University has a program in their natural
resources department that you can design —
my program was called Natural Resource Plan
ning and Interpretation with an Emphasis in
Marine Resources. Technically, it's not a ma
rine biology degree but most of the curriculum
was what you would take for marine biology
minus some of the chemistry. Later, I worked
in the field of marine science education at the
Ocean Institute in Dana Point, but after a while
1 really wanted to get back to the arts and ani
mation was becoming really interesting to me
because it just seems like there is a limitless po
tential and so I looked into schools. I went Cal
Arts, studied experimental animation and af
terwards 1 worked at that [Nickelodeon] show,
"Rocko's Modern Life." and learned a lot
about making animation. And at a certain point
there it dawned on me that if 1 were to do an an
imal show there was all this stuff that I am in
terested in that really no one has ever animat-

ed. Things like plankton and just an entire undersea world, so it
just collided at a certain point in my head.
Q: Are you surprised with the suocess of "Spongeßob"?
SH: To give a short answer to that — you have to imagine you write a
show about a sponge and you think that maybe a few people will think
it is funny, some college students, but it takes off. It Is truly shocking. Yes.
I mean it is to the point where it is bizarre.

Spongeßob pom — "ooming" to theaters near you.


Contrciry to popular belief, the dude on ihe right does nof enjoy S&M.
Q: Wluit are some of the difficulties in transferring what Ls essentially a
20-minute cartoon into an hour-and half movie? How do you keep
people who have ADD from leaving the theater?
STEPHEN HILLENBERG: It definitely is a greater challenge in
some ways. Our experience was really writing 11-minute shows,
not even 22-minute. In the series we focused a lot on trying to keep
it very simple and do these storylines where there are not a lot of
B-plots in a way. I think that is what can be charming about the
show. But when you do a 75-minute movie, that becomes difficult.
And the reason we did the movie was we wanted to try to tackle a
larger story with greater stakes. We tried to write a story that had
an art for "Spongeßob," something where he actually goes
through a growth in the movie, where he has an arc, which was a
challenge we never had to deal with before. With animation, I
think, the challenge is to keep people interested for an hour and 15
minutes.
0:1 heard that David I lasselhoff will lx' in the movie. Was it hard get
ting him? Was he keen on it'? Or who came to who?
SH: It was great. David, we basically wrote him into the story without
asking him. which Ls a really dangerous tiling to do when you are under
a tight deadline like we are. But we built the story. We found this s|X)t
