# Intermission sits down with James Mercer
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN TAM VO INTERMISSION MUSIC ELITISTS 
We recently sat down fora chat with James Mercer, lead vo
calist and guitar player of The Shins, an incredibly intimate expe
rience. That is, it took the form of a conference call with writers
from other colleges who took turns asking Mercer insightful ques
tions such as "How do you

feel about indie rock?"
and "1 heard you first on
the "Garden State" sound
track, and Natalie Port
man says you changed her
life — are you guys com
ing to Canada?" We'll
spare you the pain, so
here's the best of the inter
view.
Q: How do you feel about
being on the Spongebob
soundtrack with The

Flaming Lips, Ween, Motorhead and,.. Avril Lavigne?

JAMES MERCER: The Avril Lavigne thing was a surprise. We
were told that somebody is going to sing the theme song... and it
was going to be somebody who has been a major influence on all
of us. They wouldn't tell us who it was going to be. There were ru
mors that it was going to be the Red Hot Chili Peppers and then it

turned out to be Avril
Lavigne. That's cool.
1 am happy to be with
all these people on
this record, especially
Motorhead.
Q: How did you get
inspired to write a
song for Spongeßob?
JM: 1 had watched the
show a number of
times... I love the
show. Also, Steve [Hil
lenburg] liked the Shins
independently . . .
when he was ready to
do this movie he
asked me to be part of
it and I was happy [to
do it].

Q: If you could be a
part of any soundtrack growing up, what would you choose?
JM: I do not know if the Shins would fit in there but we could prob
ably do something for"A Clockwork Orange." I love that sound
track.
INTERMISSION: Your song "New Slang" that was featured on
the McDonalds commercial featured the lyric "new slang when
you notice the stripes, the dirt in your fries / Hope it's right when
you die, old and bony." How in the world did that song get picked

for the commercial?
JM: A Chicago ad agency called us up right about the time we got
signed to Sub Pop, and when we were all still living in Albu
querque. We were, for obvious reasons, very hesitant to do this.
This was before there was real conspicuous press about McDon
alds. The "Fast Food Nation" book had not been such a big thing
yet. We were really nervous about it and we decided to basically
triple the amount of money they said they were willing to pay and
ended up doing it because they came back with a price that was re
ally, really close to this ridiculous thing that we had [asked for]. We
thought that was kind of funny too that there is that line in the
song. They ended up using the intro to the song, so there are no
lyrics unfortunately.
INTERMISSION: You recently collaborated with Matt Mc-
Cormick on Towlines for the score. How does that process differ
from going into the studio and recording an album?
JM: It's very different. One of the habits 1 have as a songwriter who
spent the last 10 years writing pop songs is that I want to come up
with a chorus and a bridge and verses and make it all make tidy
sense. I really have to learn if I am going to continue doing these
movies that you cannot really write a song because that distracts
the viewer. You do not want to have anything that leads them
astray from the narration ...
Q: The "Garden State" soundtrack was great publicity for you.]
Are you and Zach Braff buddies?
JM: I met him but onstage at the Jimmy Kimmel show. It was this
really quick thing in front of the cameras and then he ran off so 1
have not ever really talked to him at all. 1 think the other guys did.
They were down in the green room and he was down there and
they had a while to talk...
0: What was the first band or album that you ever truly connected
with?
JM: "Dark Side of the Moon." 1 was pretty young but I had this
friend who was 14 years old and I was 10 — he loved Pink Floyd
and would play that album all the time.
Q: What was the craziest experience you have had while on tour?
JM: We got pulled over in Oklahoma and our roadie unfortunate
ly had some drugs on him, so we all got arrested.
Q: Is there anyone that you would like to collaborate with?
JM: I would love to work with Wayne from the Flaming Lips... I
am going to be collaborating with Jimmy Tamborello from Dntel.
He is also from The Postal Service.
INTERMISSION: Did you have any embarrassing band names
that you picked along the way?
JM: At one time I wanted to have a band called The Squirrels,
which I actually still think is cool but I think there was a Squirrels
out there. 1 was in a band one time called Orange Little Cousins. I
was in a band called Blue Roof Dinner. I think the worst band
name of all that 1 was ever involved with ... was called Subculture,
which is just so lame and pretentious.



So sad, yet still in a sweater.

lenburg] liked the Shins
independently . . .
when he was ready to
do this movie he
asked me to be part of
it and I was happy [to
do it].

Q: If you could be a
part of any soundtrack growing up, what would you choose?
JM: I do not know if the Shins would fit in there but we could prob
ably do something for"A Clockwork Orange." I love that sound
track.
INTERMISSION: Your song "New Slang" that was featured on
the McDonalds commercial featured the lyric "new slang when
you notice the stripes, the dirt in your fries / Hope it's right when
you die, old and bony." How in the world did that song get picked

for the commercial?
JM: A Chicago ad agency called us up right about the time we got
signed to Sub Pop, and when we were all still living in Albu
querque. We were, for obvious reasons, very hesitant to do this.
This was before there was real conspicuous press about McDon
alds. The "Fast Food Nation" book had not been such a big thing
yet. We were really nervous about it and we decided to basically
triple the amount of money they said they were willing to pay and
ended up doing it because they came back with a price that was re
ally, really close to this ridiculous thing that we had [asked for]. We
thought that was kind of funny too that there is that line in the
song. They ended up using the intro to the song, so there are no
lyrics unfortunately.
INTERMISSION: You recently collaborated with Matt Mc-
Cormick on Towlines for the score. How does that process differ
from going into the studio and recording an album?
JM: It's very different. One of the habits 1 have as a songwriter who
spent the last 10 years writing pop songs is that I want to come up
with a chorus and a bridge and verses and make it all make tidy
sense. I really have to learn if I am going to continue doing these
movies that you cannot really write a song because that distracts
the viewer. You do not want to have anything that leads them
astray from the narration ...
Q: The "Garden State" soundtrack was great publicity for you.]
Are you and Zach Braff buddies?
JM: I met him but onstage at the Jimmy Kimmel show. It was this
really quick thing in front of the cameras and then he ran off so 1
have not ever really talked to him at all. 1 think the other guys did.
They were down in the green room and he was down there and
they had a while to talk...
0: What was the first band or album that you ever truly connected
with?
JM: "Dark Side of the Moon." 1 was pretty young but I had this
friend who was 14 years old and I was 10 — he loved Pink Floyd
and would play that album all the time.
Q: What was the craziest experience you have had while on tour?
JM: We got pulled over in Oklahoma and our roadie unfortunate
ly had some drugs on him, so we all got arrested.
Q: Is there anyone that you would like to collaborate with?
JM: I would love to work with Wayne from the Flaming Lips... I
am going to be collaborating with Jimmy Tamborello from Dntel.
He is also from The Postal Service.
INTERMISSION: Did you have any embarrassing band names
that you picked along the way?
JM: At one time I wanted to have a band called The Squirrels,
which I actually still think is cool but I think there was a Squirrels
out there. 1 was in a band one time called Orange Little Cousins. I
was in a band called Blue Roof Dinner. I think the worst band
name of all that 1 was ever involved with ... was called Subculture,
which is just so lame and pretentious.



So sad, yet still in a sweater.
We recently sat down fora chat with James Mercer, lead vo
calist and guitar player of The Shins, an incredibly intimate expe
rience. That is, it took the form of a conference call with writers
from other colleges who took turns asking Mercer insightful ques
tions such as "How do you

feel about indie rock?"
and "1 heard you first on
the "Garden State" sound
track, and Natalie Port
man says you changed her
life — are you guys com
ing to Canada?" We'll
spare you the pain, so
here's the best of the inter
view.
Q: How do you feel about
being on the Spongebob
soundtrack with The

Flaming Lips, Ween, Motorhead and,.. Avril Lavigne?

JAMES MERCER: The Avril Lavigne thing was a surprise. We
were told that somebody is going to sing the theme song... and it
was going to be somebody who has been a major influence on all
of us. They wouldn't tell us who it was going to be. There were ru
mors that it was going to be the Red Hot Chili Peppers and then it

turned out to be Avril
Lavigne. That's cool.
1 am happy to be with
all these people on
this record, especially
Motorhead.
Q: How did you get
inspired to write a
song for Spongeßob?
JM: 1 had watched the
show a number of
times... I love the
show. Also, Steve [Hil
lenburg] liked the Shins
independently . . .
when he was ready to
do this movie he
asked me to be part of
it and I was happy [to
