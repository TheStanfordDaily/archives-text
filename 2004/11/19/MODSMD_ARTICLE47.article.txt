Stanford Can't Lose!
Many of you Cardinal fans are
probably thinking that there's no
point to going to Big Game. Nobody
wants to watch the team that always
finds a way to screw up a potential vic
tory be destroyed by the fourth-best
team in the nation. But there is hope
for Stanford football. Since so much of
our reality is based through cinema.
Hollywood must hold the outcome to
Big Game. After extensive viewing of
Hollywood sports movies, 1 have con
cluded that the Stanford football team
will undoubtedly emerge victorious.
The Underdog Factor:
Has there ever been a movie
where the underdog loses (besides in
dependent films that make try so hard
to display the pointlessness of life)?
Every sports film has the team over
come the impossible to defeat their
evil opponents. "Miracle," the film
about the American ice hockey team
beating the Soviets, displays this. Of
course, naturally, Cal will have to
jump out to an early lead that forces
Buddy Teevens to make a passionate
ly inspired speech at halftime. The
Cardinal will then fight their way back
into the game with Cal scoring just
enough points to keep the contest out
of reach. A miraculous last second
score on an inventive play will give
Stanford the unlikely victory.
The Unexpected Hero Factor
"Varsity Blues" and "Any Given
Sunday" have taught us that when sec
ond or third string players get a chance,
they can change the game. In the past.
Chris Lewis could come in as quarter
back during an emergency and win the

game. These days, it could be anyone
on the team, but they must be a pure of
heart person who staves off some
temptation right before the game and
thus grows into a better person. Our
unexpected hero will get Stanford
back in the game and graciously let the
winning play be scored by someone
who has been racially discriminated
against by the Athletic Department.
The Good vs. Evil Factor
In"The Mighty Ducks," why was it
more fitting that the Ducks won in
stead of the Hawks? It was more than
the underdog factor. This was because
the coach and the children playing for
the Hawks were pure evil. They were
dirty, mean players who wore black
uniforms. In the case of Big Game, no
body can deny that the Stanford team
represents all the purity and goodness
in the world while the Golden Bears
are simply seeds of Satan.
The Singing Factor:
This is the most powerful force on
athletic performance of all. The Car
dinal can still lose Big Game despite
all the other factors in their favor.
However, no team has ever lost if they
sing or cheer before the game. "Re
member the Titans" showed the team
going undefeated and overcoming
race tensions because of singing.
Could the Mighty Ducks have won if
they hadn't started quacking? Could
the Jamaican bobsled team in "Cool
Runnings" out perform everyone's
expectations without song? Even
Rudy would never have played with
out a chant. If the Stanford team starts
singing, the game is over.
So go to Big Game and watch as the
Stanford team reaffirms my belief in
Hollywood. The game is really theirs
to lose at this point. Victory is ours!
