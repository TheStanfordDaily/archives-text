## GAIETIES A 						freshman's first time with Gaieties should involve more nudity 
### ZACH PODELL-EBERHARDT INTERMISSION FRESHMAN MUSICAL CRITIC 
Being a freshman, I had no preconceived notions about Gai
eties. I had high hopes for the production — sadly, they were
instantly deflated.
8:00 p.m.: Gaieties dress rehearsal begins.
8:02 p.m.: LSJUMB* enters the balcony. Proceeds to make
better, wittier jokes than dialogue ensuing on stage.
8:03 p.m.: Shiny colors appear on stage, accompanied by music
and a loose definition of "choreography."
8:03-fitty p.m.: Nobody has taken their shirt off yet.
8:06 p.m.: Apparently it is normal for people run around Stan
ford with signs advertising blowjobs and Penis Clubs.
8:09 p.m.: Shiny colors end. I'm almost sad.
8:09 plus a hit p.m.: Scene change — OMG GUYS!!! We're ;it
CALM! And there's an evil Stewie Griffin-wannabe warbling
a quaint little ditty. (Please replace "quaint" with "horribly
cringe-inducing").
8:11 p.m.: The Band determines said evilness of Gaieties stems

from the fact that nobody has taken their off shirt yet.
8:12 p.m.: Evil Stewie Griffinwannahe still singing.
8:13 p.m.: He's still singing. And singing. And singing.
Then he gives his cane a handjob. Mormons everywhere
cover their ears, because the fucker really fucking likes to
fucking say the word "fuck" a whole fucking lot.
8:15 p.m.: For the love of God, why won't anybody take
their shirt off?
8:17 p.m.: Shamelessly violating Calvin and / or Hobbes'
patent, cast members run into a Transmogrofier (tm) and
run out looking like retarded zombies who then proceed
to dance maniacally — I start to wonder why the hell am
I still here and when will the pain end.
8:18 p.m.: Evil-Dude sings a reprise. WHY??!!!
WHY??!!!
8:19 p.m.: Whoopsies! We're back at Stanford, and peo
ple are talking on stage. Exactly what they are saying, no
one knows. Or cares. Light technician is receiving projec
tion-booth head, causing stage lights to erratically swivel.

What the hell's happening in this picture? Oh, it's just Gaities.
8:21 PM: Nobody is naked. Not
even one person.
8:23 PM: The Band's friendly con
structive criticism makes people
angry. People like the director and
executive producers.
8:24 PM: The Band is kicked out of
MemAud. Finally, a Big Game tra
dition that is actually welcomed.
Conclusion: Gaieties is terrible. No
body took off their shirt, the girl
holding the blowjob sign ran off
stage and Bill Watterson is rolling in
his grave. Luckily, we got kicked out
after 24 minutes. But that shouldn't
stop you, average Stanford student,
from seeing it. After all, it is quite
funny — just remember to laugh at
the actors instead of with them,
*Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band — what sort of
Stanford student are you if you don't
recognize this acronym?
