# A 						Conversation with Hilton Obenzinger
## 
### ANNA NORTH INTERMISSION ENGLISH GURU 
For Prof. Hilton Obenzinger,God
is a duck. At least, that's what he
thought when he stepped out of the
shower a few months ago to hear a
disembodied quacking in what he
thought was an empty house. The
quacker turned out to be his son,
cursing at the computer, but the inci
dent stuck with Obenzinger — "God
Is A Duck" will be the title of his next
novel.
While this might strike some as
blasphemous, it's nothing compared
to his most recent work, originally ti
tled "Satan's Asshole." His publisher
convinced him to moderate it to
"A*hole," but its subject matter — a
journey through Hell culminating in
the Devil's anus — remains the
same.

Actually, Satan's colon is only part
of Obenzinger's story. His tale also
includes Patty Hearst, a hoy who be
lieves he is sinking through the side
walk, and the running verse com
mentary of a character named St.
John the Asshole.
Stanford students may know
Obenzinger best as the I Jndergradu
ate Research Programs' associate di
rector for honors writing or as the
host of "How 1 Write," a series of
conversations with Stanford faculty
about their composition processes.
Given this scholarly background,
many may be surprised by the pro
fane phantasmagoria that is
"A*hole." But the novel is actually
intimately connected to Oben
zinger's Stanford experience.
Personal tragedy played a role in
the conception of "A*hole": Oben
zinger was inspired in part by his son's

psychological crisis. However, he
also drew inspiration from his stu
dents' experiences. One segment of
the novel chronicles an unpleasant
encounter in a Los Angeles depart
ment store, related to Obenzinger by
student Yolanda Ochoa.
While Obenzinger finds student
writing an important source of mate
rial. he also draws on his studies of
history and literature. References to
Melville and Twain crop up in
"A*hole," as do Obenzinger's mus
ings on the past and future of our
species.
We humans have "a tendency to
look at the past with a great deal of ar
rogance," Obenzinger says.
We shake our heads at the mis
takes of our forebears, asking "how
come those people didn't know?"
Part of his goal in fiction is to "under
stand what it's like to be in the past."

In previous works this has meant
telling the story of New York from
the point of view of its fires, or pulling
together a novel from a series of in
vented documents. In "A*hole" it
means creating characters so "seri
ously flawed, perverse" that they
challenge our arrogance, showing us
that "humans are always stupid."
With this sentiment in mind, it's
not surprising that Obenzinger finds
inspiration in what he calls bad writ
ing, such as a book of one-minute
mysteries. Trashy publications, he
says, are "filled with wonderful idio
syncrasies, cliches" and "rich, inad
vertent language."
"Writers need to steal." he says,
and he's just a likely to steal from a
hack as from Herman Melville.
Though the multiple narrators and
interlocking storylines of "A*hole"
may earn it the designation "postmod-

em." Oben
zinger andhis
friends "just
kincLt giggle"
at thai label
He praises
the "open
ness iind free
dom" of
postmod
ernism, but
cautions
those who
seek to put lit
erature into

neat categories. He's hesitant even to call
"A*hole" a novel, preferring to think of
it as a hvbiid of many genres.
This hybrid essentially "wrote it
self'; sometimes, he says,"it felt like
the hook was writing me."
He wrote around and around peo
ple at home and at work, and over
time, the fragments of the story began
to coalesce.
Obenzinger himself doesn't quite
understand yet how these fragments
fit together. Iliat's where critical
readers, he says, could help him: he
invites his audience to offer their take
on the discordant voices of Patty, St.
John and the boy in the sidewalk.
He'll read from the novel at the Stan
ford Bookstore on Dec. 2.
Then you can travel through
Satan's asshole with Obenzinger,
and tell him what you think of the
ride.

ride.







Hey asshole, read my book!
For Prof. Hilton Obenzinger,God
is a duck. At least, that's what he
thought when he stepped out of the
shower a few months ago to hear a
disembodied quacking in what he
thought was an empty house. The
quacker turned out to be his son,
cursing at the computer, but the inci
dent stuck with Obenzinger — "God
Is A Duck" will be the title of his next
novel.
While this might strike some as
blasphemous, it's nothing compared
to his most recent work, originally ti
tled "Satan's Asshole." His publisher
convinced him to moderate it to
"A*hole," but its subject matter — a
journey through Hell culminating in
the Devil's anus — remains the
same.

Actually, Satan's colon is only part
of Obenzinger's story. His tale also
includes Patty Hearst, a hoy who be
lieves he is sinking through the side
walk, and the running verse com
mentary of a character named St.
John the Asshole.
Stanford students may know
Obenzinger best as the I Jndergradu
ate Research Programs' associate di
rector for honors writing or as the
host of "How 1 Write," a series of
conversations with Stanford faculty
about their composition processes.
Given this scholarly background,
many may be surprised by the pro
fane phantasmagoria that is
"A*hole." But the novel is actually
intimately connected to Oben
zinger's Stanford experience.
Personal tragedy played a role in
the conception of "A*hole": Oben
zinger was inspired in part by his son's

psychological crisis. However, he
also drew inspiration from his stu
dents' experiences. One segment of
the novel chronicles an unpleasant
encounter in a Los Angeles depart
ment store, related to Obenzinger by
student Yolanda Ochoa.
While Obenzinger finds student
writing an important source of mate
rial. he also draws on his studies of
history and literature. References to
Melville and Twain crop up in
"A*hole," as do Obenzinger's mus
ings on the past and future of our
species.
We humans have "a tendency to
look at the past with a great deal of ar
rogance," Obenzinger says.
We shake our heads at the mis
takes of our forebears, asking "how
come those people didn't know?"
Part of his goal in fiction is to "under
stand what it's like to be in the past."

In previous works this has meant
telling the story of New York from
the point of view of its fires, or pulling
together a novel from a series of in
vented documents. In "A*hole" it
means creating characters so "seri
ously flawed, perverse" that they
challenge our arrogance, showing us
that "humans are always stupid."
With this sentiment in mind, it's
not surprising that Obenzinger finds
inspiration in what he calls bad writ
ing, such as a book of one-minute
mysteries. Trashy publications, he
says, are "filled with wonderful idio
syncrasies, cliches" and "rich, inad
vertent language."
"Writers need to steal." he says,
and he's just a likely to steal from a
hack as from Herman Melville.
Though the multiple narrators and
interlocking storylines of "A*hole"
may earn it the designation "postmod-

em." Oben
zinger andhis
friends "just
kincLt giggle"
at thai label
He praises
the "open
ness iind free
dom" of
postmod
ernism, but
cautions
those who
seek to put lit
erature into

neat categories. He's hesitant even to call
"A*hole" a novel, preferring to think of
it as a hvbiid of many genres.
This hybrid essentially "wrote it
self'; sometimes, he says,"it felt like
the hook was writing me."
He wrote around and around peo
ple at home and at work, and over
time, the fragments of the story began
to coalesce.
Obenzinger himself doesn't quite
understand yet how these fragments
fit together. Iliat's where critical
readers, he says, could help him: he
invites his audience to offer their take
on the discordant voices of Patty, St.
John and the boy in the sidewalk.
He'll read from the novel at the Stan
ford Bookstore on Dec. 2.
