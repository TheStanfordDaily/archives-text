## Majoring in Rockstar Studies Part Three: David Jacobs-Strain 
### BONNIE JOHNSON INTERMISSION WRITER 
They appear in fanzines; they tour inces
santly; they live in the dorms. Who are these
mysterious stars of the underground? Stanford
students.
It's a little known fact that rock lives here at
Stanford and that at least a few here live to
rock. A handful of Stanford students have pur
sued their music like the crazy folks they are
and made it in their respective scenes thanks to
distinctive styles and a whole lot of hard work.
This week: David Jacobs-Strain.
Stanford junior David Jacobs-Strain hails
from Eugene, Ore., where he first learned to
play blues guitar. He started recording at 14

and started teaching at blues workshops at 16,
signing to Northern Blues and releasing
"Stuck on the Way Back" in 2002. His new
album, "Ocean or a Teardrop," is available in
stores.
INTERMISSION: Performing in a genre that
draws lyrically on life experience, do a lot of
people give you a hard time about your age?
JACOBS-STRAIN: Some background infor
mation might be useful — you know, Robert
Johnson died by 30.1 work in and around the
blues, but I'm not of the blues. I'm not from
that first generation like Tommy Johnson and
Fred McDowell; I'm drawing from those inno
vations as well as the second generation of in
fluence. Music has depth when it's related to
other specific music. That's why the Grateful
Dead has had a strong spiritual resonance with
so many people: They were very much aware
of American "roots" music in a way that a lot
of other jam bands haven't been.
Similarly, Bob Dylan studied Woody
Guthrie very closely ... Age has nothing and
everything to do with it. I was very lucky in that
when I started playing the guitar at eight, 1 was
encouraged to emote freely and to sing what I
felt. That's the core of what 1 do onstage — I
may not smash guitars, but I try to give myself
over to the songs. I think that when people say,
"You're too young to sing the blues," they
mean "too young to sing them with convic
tion." But I use the intensity of the blues as a
way to express what's inside of me. Demon
strating feelings is a skill.
INT: "Sleepless Dream" from your new record
is a little less bluesy and a little more contem
porary-sounding — is it the radio single?
J-S: I didn't mean it to be; I wrote it because I
had a concept and a guitar part. I used to play
in the bathroom in the dorm because the

acoustics were best in there, and people start
ed coming in to listen when I played that song,
so that by the time I finished it there would be
ten or twelve people in the bathroom ... One
blues magazine gave the album a great review
but hated "Sleepless Dream," and yet that's
the song they put on their sampler CD. Also,
"Ocean or a Teardrop" is in Borders listening
stations all fall, and the write-up there tells
people to listen to "Sleepless Dream." It's
playing on K.FOG, too. The song is probably
the least representative of the album, but it's
also the most intimate. This album is more in-

timate and also more political than my previ
ous ones. And it's not a genre record, but there
are no superficial songs.
INT: Tell me about the musicians with whom
you work.
J-S: This record is the first one I've done with

a band. All of the musicians were people I had
jammed with, but they had never played with
each other or rehearsed as a band until we got
into the studio. Kendrick Freeman plays
drums, and Joe Craven plays fiddle, mandolin,
and the Turkish oud — he used to play with
Jerry Garcia. Mark Clark plays drums too; he
used to play with James Taylor. Kenny Pas
sarelli is the producer and bassist — he's
played on something like 23 gold records; he's
played with John Hammond and with Crosby,
Stills and Nash, and lots of other people...
Peter Burtt, who co-wrote a couple of songs on

the album with me, plays the kora,
the West African harp.
He works a lot in the tradi
tion of northern Mississippi blues,
but also West African music, and
they're different, complementary
textures. He has an amazing depth
of musical knowledge, and I've
learned a lot from playing with
him.
INT: 1 know that you stopped out
fora quarter last year to record
"Ocean or a Teardrop." What's it
like balancing Stanford with your
music? Do you travel a lot to play
shows?
J-S: It's a challenge, to say the
least! I've played about 50 shows
per year for the past four years,
mostly festivals. I'm planning a

tour, so right now I'm working on
putting together a tour band and booking gigs
for the summer. I'll probably do a lot of solo
shows.
