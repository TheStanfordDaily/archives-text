# Talib Kweli keeps the beats flowing and flirts with the mainstream
## 
### JOHN HOLGATE INTERMISSION DJ 
The slippery slope of commercial success is crying
out to Talib Kweli, begging to expose his masterful flow
to the masses.
"If skills sold, truth be told / I'd probably be, lyrical
ly, Talib Kweli," dropped Jay-Z on his Black Album.
Who is this man that the Jigga praises so highly?
Talib Kweli has long been a music-critic favorite, lay
ing out thoughtful rhymes in a smooth conversational
tone and staying clear of commercial rap's penchant for
bailers, booze and bitches. As part of Brooklyn's Native
Tongues crew, he honed his rhymes amongst some of
hip-hop's freshest talents (De la Soul. A Tribe Called
Quest), rapping about political activism and personal

struggles in sophisticated language. Now poised for both
critical and commercial acclaim, a much wider audience
has the chance to hear a master of his craft.
"The Beautiful Struggle" is Talib Kweli's third solo
album and witnesses both a return to roots and explo
ration of the treacherous commerciality he seems des
tined for. This album demonstrates all the qualities that
garnered Talib Kweli peer respect. He has teamed up
once again with DJ Hi-Tek, his steady beat-maker from
the early '90s, when he worked alongside Mos Def in
Black Star. Lyrically, Kweli raps with an unrivaled con
viction. His flow represents everything that hip-hop as
pires to be: a poem, a personal confession, a political
statement.
Perhaps sensing a chance at stardom, he has also
asked for help from some of today's hottest artists, in-

eluding contribu
tions from Mary J.
Blige and Faith
Evans. Among the
guest producers are
Kanye West, the
Ncptunes and Just
Blaze, today's
biggest names in the
studios. Where does
this leave Talib
Kweli? Attempting
to straddle the two
pillars of commercial
and critical success.
"Going Hard."
