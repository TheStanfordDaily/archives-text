# Talib Kweli keeps the beats flowing and flirts with the mainstream
## 
### JOHN HOLGATE INTERMISSION DJ 
The slippery slope of commercial success is crying
out to Talib Kweli, begging to expose his masterful flow
to the masses.
"If skills sold, truth be told / I'd probably be, lyrical
ly, Talib Kweli," dropped Jay-Z on his Black Album.
Who is this man that the Jigga praises so highly?
Talib Kweli has long been a music-critic favorite, lay
ing out thoughtful rhymes in a smooth conversational
tone and staying clear of commercial rap's penchant for
bailers, booze and bitches. As part of Brooklyn's Native
Tongues crew, he honed his rhymes amongst some of
hip-hop's freshest talents (De la Soul. A Tribe Called
Quest), rapping about political activism and personal

struggles in sophisticated language. Now poised for both
critical and commercial acclaim, a much wider audience
has the chance to hear a master of his craft.
"The Beautiful Struggle" is Talib Kweli's third solo
album and witnesses both a return to roots and explo
ration of the treacherous commerciality he seems des
tined for. This album demonstrates all the qualities that
garnered Talib Kweli peer respect. He has teamed up
once again with DJ Hi-Tek, his steady beat-maker from
the early '90s, when he worked alongside Mos Def in
Black Star. Lyrically, Kweli raps with an unrivaled con
viction. His flow represents everything that hip-hop as
pires to be: a poem, a personal confession, a political
statement.
Perhaps sensing a chance at stardom, he has also
asked for help from some of today's hottest artists, in-

eluding contribu
tions from Mary J.
Blige and Faith
Evans. Among the
guest producers are
Kanye West, the
Ncptunes and Just
Blaze, today's
biggest names in the
studios. Where does
this leave Talib
Kweli? Attempting
to straddle the two
pillars of commercial
and critical success.
"Going Hard."

Kweli-ty show this Saturday; be sure to check er out after watching Stanford lose (d'oh)

the opening track, kicks off the album and im
mediately throws up a bold horn section before
Kweli sets in with verses crying out against child
labor and the hardships of poverty in third world
countries. The Neptunes show off their infec
tious beats on "Broken Glass," a song that fea
tures more cowbell than a cattle farm. A groov

ing lyrical (low outlines the struggles of a small
town girl learning about life in the big city, her
dreams shattered like broken glass. Kweli s
earnest rhymes keep the song from becoming
cliche, but on other tracks things simply fall
apart.
"We Got the Beat" is based around the cheesi

est '80s metal guitar solo this side of Poison, then
tries to switch gears and does an awful a capella im
itation of Afrika Bambaataa's "Planet Rock."
When executed this poorly, imitation is not a form
of flattery at all.
Talib Kweli, though, has far too much integrity
to allow the entire album to slip into mediocrity.

Nobody can cry "sellout" on this man. Should you
be lucky enough to have tickets for his post-Big
Game concert on Saturday evening, you'll be
treated to a display of lyrical brilliance. His intelli
gent examination of the ills in today's society is de
livered so effortlessly, you'll almost forget about
the thumping we're gonna get from Cal.
