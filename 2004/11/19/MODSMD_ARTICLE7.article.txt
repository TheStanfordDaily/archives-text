Big Game is a storied rivalry between Stanford and
California that defies odds and ignores logic. Nobody on
earth ever knows who will win the game. Even in this,
the I()7th meeting between the rival schools, hope
springs eternal, despite a lopsided matchup on paper.
For Stanford and Cal fans. Big Game transcends the
sport of football.
Throughout the past two decades. Big Game has be
come a way for Stanford fans to forget about the first 10
games of the season and demonstrate Stanford's superi
ority over its long-time rival, representing the salvation
of the football team's season. This season is no excep
tion.
Outside the campuses of Stanford and Cal, Big Game
has become overshadowed by other rivalry-week games
like Michigan-Ohio State.
Yet Big Game used to have a tremendous impact, not
only for the two Bay Area rivals, but also for the entire
West Coast. Because the Bay Area did not have any pro
fessional sports teams at the turn of the century. Big
Game became the biggest sporting event on the West
Coast for many years, drawing thousands of fans from
all over California.
The 106-game-old series began during the 1891-1892
school year after a veteran California football team chal
lenged newborn Stanford University to a football game
in the fall of 1891. John Whittemore, a transfer student
who began to organize a football team at Stanford, de
clined the challenge at first but accepted it later in the
spring.
The two schools met at a sandlot near Haight and
Stanyan Streets in San Francisco on March 19. 1892.
About 20.000 spectators crowded the field that day as
Stanford student manager and future President Her
bert Hoover collected a stunning $30,000 in gate re
ceipts.
The game was about to begin when the referee dis
covered that neither club brought a football to the field
(Some sources say it was Hoover who forgot to bring the
ball). Luckily, the owner of a local sporting goods store
was in the crowd, and while he rode off on horseback to
get a ball, the crowd waited anxiously for more than an
hour.
Once the game started, Stanford leaped out to a 14-0
lead and held on fora 14-10 upset of the heavily favored
and much more experienced Cal squad, beginning Stan
ford's long-standing tradition of defeating the Golden
Bears (Stanford leads the all-time Big Game scries 54-
39-11).
Even then, Cal fans found creative ways to justify
their losses. Following a controversial Stanford touch

down in 1894. a Cal student newspaper reporter wrote,
"[Stanford] won by a fluke and a referee ... that is the
only just verdict that can he passed. I do not mean to in
sinuate that the referee was in any way influenced to
take a Stanford view of the game, hut I do mean he does
not know a touchdown when he sees it."
Perhaps tired of losing to Stanford at football, Cal
proposed to change the sport of the Big Game from
football to rugby in 1904. Fearing that football was
too violent, Cal President Benjamin Wheeler validat
ed Cal's derogatory nickname — "The Weenies" —

when he said, "The game of football must be entirely
made over or go."
From 1906 to 1914. Rugby — which was apparently a
less violent sport back then — became the official sport
of Big Game. Stanford also dominated Cal at rugby,
posting a 5-3-1 record.
During the 1920s and 19305, the popularity of Big
Game grew tremendously throughout the West Coast.

forcing the Cardinal to build Stanford Stadium, then the
biggest sporting venue west of New York, in 1921.
That year, 62.740 fans packed the newly built stadium
for Big Game, setting an attendance record for the West
Coast.
However, Stanford Stadium was still not large
enough to fit the trainloads of fans who came to watch
Big Game from all across California, and in 1924 Cal
built Memorial Stadium.
Marking the debut of Stanford coaching legend Pop
Warner, Stanford and Cal played to a 20-20 tie in front

of 77,(XX) fans in what some considered the greatest of all
Big Games. The Oakland Tribune reported that in the
parking lot. scalpers were getting $1(X) for a pair of tick
ets. during an era when a hot dog cost 15 cents.
On the field, Stanford — playing without injured Ail-
American Ernie Nevers — trailed 20-6 with less than six
minutes remaining in the game. Ouarterhack Ed Walk
er threw two touchdown passes, one to Murray Cuddc

back, who had been knocked unconscious earlier in the
game after colliding with a camera tripod, and Stanford
escaped with a tie.
Two years later. Stanford and Cal competed in
what was arguably the most important Big Game
ever. Both teams entered the game tied for the lead in
the conference with perfect 10-0 records. The winner
would go to the Rose Bowl and contend fora nation
al championship.
As 90,000 people watched the game at Memorial Sta
dium. Stanford defeated Cal 13-6. The attendance set a
Big Game record that is still intact today. Stanford went
on to tie Alabama 7-7 in the Rose Bowl, and Stanford
and Alabama shared the national championship.
While Cal has fringe hopes of a national champi
onship this season. Stanford can only play for pride —
and the storied Axe.
And. as Big Game history shows, anything can
happen.
