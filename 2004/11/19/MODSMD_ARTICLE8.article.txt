## Stanford Hospital faces influx of trauma patients 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Beginning Dec. 9, the Stanford
Medical Center will be one of only
two licensed trauma centers in
Santa Clara County.
The medical center recently an
nounced that it would take on extra
patients and add facilities in order
to ensure continued emergency dare
to area residents in light of the up
coming closure of the San Jose
Medical Center emergency care di
vision due to financial difficulties.
Dr. David Spain, chief of trauma
care, said that the Stanford Medical
Center already has about 2,000 trau
ma patients a year and will now be
receiving an extra 800. The Valley
Medical Center, the third trauma
hospital in Santa Clara County, will
take on an extra 1,200 trauma pa
tients per year.
"The patients that the San Jose
Medical Center cares for need to be
redistributed to the two remaining
trauma centers," Spain said. "How
ever, most of the patients in San
Jose will have to go to the Valley
Medical Center because it would
take too long to bring them up here.
This was as equitable a split as we
could come up with given the geo
graphic and transport time restric
tions."
The Stanford Medical Center
will accept new trauma patients
from southern San Mateo, northern
Santa Clara, San Benito, Monterey

and Santa Cruz counties. Patients
from San Jose and southern Santa
Clara County will be transported to
the Valley Medical Center.
Stanford Hospital said it won't
have to make major adjustments to
accomodate the influx of patients.
"This is an average of only about
two new trauma patients per day, so
we really won't have to add more
staff or equipment," Spain said.
"Most of our effort has been spent
on improving the process of care so
that throughput in our trauma cen
ter improves."
Along with the redistribution of
patients to the two remaining trau
ma centers, the Regional Medical
Center, which is currently not a cer
tified trauma center, has applied to
the Santa Clara County Emergency
Medical Services agency to become
a Level Two trauma center in order
to ease the difficulties caused by the
San Jose hospital's closure.
If granted its request, the Re
gional Medical Center will not be
required to have an ongoing pro
gram of research or a surgical resi
dency program like that of a Level
One center. Instead, it would pro
vide comprehensive trauma care to
supplement the clinical expertise of
a Level One institution, such as the
Stanford Hospital.
Because the closure of the San
Jose Medical Center was originally
planned for 2007, however, the Re
