Corporate presentation and reception
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2004
6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.
Mac Arthur Park - Julia Morgan Room
The year 1873 witnessed a severe economic shock to the Uriited States. Railroads, expand
ing greatly after the Civil War, had pushed new construction in un[rrecedented amounts.
Too much of this construction was huilt on a financial house of cards.
On September 8, 1873, the New York Warehouse and Securities Company failed; less than
two weeks later, the powerful hanking firm of Jay Cooke and Company closed its doors.
Trade on the New York Stock Exchange was suspended for 10 days, hut nothing could pre
vent the cumulative effect of the collapse. By the end of the year, over 5,000 businesses had
failed and almost 100 railroads defaidted on their bonds.
The many bankruptcies from the depression (1873-1878) brought opportunities for those
with money to pick up these defunct organizations. Apparently, WW Cargill had
enough confidence, and money, to engage in substantial amounts of this distress
buying. -Excerpt from Wayne G. Broehl's Cargill: Trading the World's Grain
Today, WW Cargill's 140-year tradition continues in Cargill Value Investment
(CVI). Investing in corporate credit, loan portfolios, real estate and other special
opportunities across four continents, CVI is a world-leading investor in management
and credit-intensive assets. With approximately 60 investment professionals, CVI
has acquired more than $70 billion in more than 1,000 transactions, and today man
ages over $4 billion in assets. Please visit www.carLMllvalueinvestment.com for more
information.
As a principal investing business, CVI does not sponsor a formal training program but
rather seeks to hire one or two experienced MRAs as junior investment managers for
either a summer or full-time position. Historically, most full-time hires have previ
ously been summer interns for CVI.
Candidates interested in learning more about CVI are encouraged to attend our cor
porate presentation and reception on Thursday, December 2, 2004, from 6:00 p.m.
to 8:00 p.m. at Mac Arthur Park in the Julia Morgan Room, and to forward a cover
letter and resume to Lisa_Reberg@cargill.com. CVI does not intend to conduct on
campus interviews, but rather schedules telephone interviews with qualified candi
dates and then invites a select few to visit our headquarters in Minneapolis,
Minnesota.
