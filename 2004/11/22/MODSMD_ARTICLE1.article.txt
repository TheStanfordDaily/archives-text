condition. As of last night, the of

Before their daughter came to
Stanford, Annan's parents had wor
ried that her asthmatic conditions
could give her trouble, according to
Courtland Lewis, the peer health
educator of IJjamaa.
Annan, a Baltimore, Md.. native,
had a great love for music and dance
and was also involved in a variety of
campus organizations, including the
Stanford Gospel Choir, the
Caribbean Students' Association,
the Stanford Democrats and the
Stanford Steppers.
Annan is survived by her parents
and two siblings. Annan's family
came directly to campus upon hear
ing of her death.
"Shanta's parents are of course
just devastated," said Jamila Ru
faro, residence dean for Lagunita,
Roble and Florence Moore halls.
"But they've spent a lot of time here
reminiscing about her many accom
plishments, such as captain of her
mock trial team in high school and
her dedication to the gospel choirs
of which she was a part."
Lewis said that though the entire
dorm was devastated. Ujamaa resi
dents have united to provide a
strong network of support in the af
termath of Annan's death.
"Shanta was one of those girls
who was always in a good mood,
enjoying herself and was always
smiling," Lewis said. "She was in
volved in a lot of clubs and had so
many friends across the university.
Even though her asthma was an
issue, she really wanted to come to
Stanford."
Annan was close to many resi
dents in Ujamaa, who spoke of her
warmth and friendly personality.
"I'll always remember her
smile," said freshman Jared Mur
phy. "Shanta would always talk to
people and kept in touch with a lot
of Stanford students. Shanta just
had a great character; she was a re
ally good person."
Freshman Melissa Nsiah praised
Annan's religious and moral charac
ter.
"We were blessed to have Shanta
in our presence, if only fora short pe
riod of time," she said. "She made a
great impact of the rest of our lives,
keeping us on track. We are thankful
to God for sending her to us, and we
know that she is in a better place,
smiling down on us."

er of Annan's friends, said, "Shanta
was very honest person and was
never unkind." She spoke her mind
and was so smart and boisterous. She
would put me to shame because she
was always doing something, while I
was lazing around. And because of
her, I know that I really will do
something productive with my life
and complete my time here in the
best way that 1 can."
Sunday night's "Hip Hop Extrav
aganza," hosted by the dance group
Jam Pac'd, included a moment of si
lence for Annan at the beginning of
the event as well as a performance
dedication by the Stanford Steppers
dance group.
"Shanta was an inspiration, and
she was truly brilliant," said fresh
man Naima Green. "She had a great
sense of humor, and just thinking of
her brings a smile to my face. We'll
never forget her."
Brittani Jackson, Annans' room
mate, described her as a very spiritu
al and intelligent person who knew
what she wanted in life.
"I just want people to know
that Shanta was a beautiful per
son inside and out," she said.
"I'm just blessed to have known
her so personally."
