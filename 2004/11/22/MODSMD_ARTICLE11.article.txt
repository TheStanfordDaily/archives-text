This weekend, Cal dominat
ed our football team. No
big surprise. Irrelevant.
This column is not about
football. Spencer Porter's got us
beat when it comes to sport. He also
has us beat when it comes to Friday
recess.

Enough ballyhoo. What we're
here to say is that Stanford's Cal
bashing is a load of nonsense.
Rubbish. Malarkey. It's more reflec
tive of a pervasive inferiority com-

plex than
of any sup
posed
superiority.
The fact
is this:
Berkeley is
pretty
much
unequivo
cally better
than
Stanford.
That's a
bold state
ment. and
we're here

to make it. If anything, Berkeley
does not need to "Burst any
Bubbles." They're living in the real
world, not this palm tree-laden,
Sunday brunch-studded adventure
of ours.
Let's start by comparing each
college's college town.
University Avenue is littered
with overpriced chic restaurants
catering to yuppie 20-something
folk, no fewer than three Persian
rug stores and multiple independ
ent theaters. We like independent
theaters. So we've bat one for three.
Not bad in baseball. Bad by any
Stanford grading standard.
Telegraph Avenue offers restau
rants with the finest five-dollar
plates of ethnic cuisine, record
shops with sounds the likes of
which your Dashboard Confe
ssional-loving emo self has never
heard and homeless drug addicts,
not the entrepreneur-gone-bust-in
the-dotcom-boom vagrants of Palo
Alto. Something about Berkeley's
homeless reeks of legitimacy.
Let's continue by comparing
each institution's academics.
You're not smarter than the
Berkeley crowd. Remember all that
crap they feed you freshman year
about how you all really deserve to
be here? Wake up. kiddos. Reality:
it's all a load of bulwarky. There's
someone at Berkeley way more
qualified than you. but less willing
to shell out the big bucks for private
school. Or they were less approved
of by our admissions department.
Those of us that are from out of
state are lucky not to have to deal
with the guilt of knowing we're pay
ing three times as much fora less
rigorous education. They actually
have to do some hard work to get
good non-inflated grades across the
bay. They sink or swim over there. If
we don't swim, we get to sit down
with our friendly advisors from the
UAC for milk, cookies and a pep
talk at the CoHo.
Anyways, onto our good point
(as if we ever have such a thing).
How do we psvch ourselves up for
Big Game? Gaieties. Now. we hate
to hate on Gaieties, but how the hell
is a musical theater production sup
posed to get people psyched up for
a football game? Imagine if some
one told you that Cal was organiz
ing a sick mass ballet routine to get
revved up for Big Game. What
would you think? I know ... let's
sign up fora five-unit yoga class
next quarter.
This all begs the question: why
haven't the two of us just gotten
into our bumbling brown Mercedes
and skedaddled up 1-880?
You're right. We haven't, and we
won't. We're walking ironies. In
fact, we can't wait to stay here
another year. As much as this place
pales in comparison to Berkeley,
we'd still rather be here than there.
It's kind of like belonging to a coun
try club. You recognize that you're
an undeserving privileged young
ster and that everyone else is prob
ably a hell of a lot more genuine
and interesting than you. but shit,
your membership was by invitation
only. Suck on that.

Send Mark and Evan hate mail at
mcslee@stanford, edit and etana@
stanford.edu. They are sick of only
hearing how crappy their columns
are in non-electronic form.
