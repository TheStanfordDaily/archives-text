# Habla la noche...
## Students tutor janitors in English 
### CYNTHIA H. CHO MANAGING EDITOR 
Every Monday and Tuesday night at 10 p.m., Evaristo
Zavaleta walks across campus from the Ginzton laboratory
building, where he works the nightshift as a janitor, to El
Centro Chicano to meet with Hada Flores during his lunch
break. For the past two years, he has been meeting with
Flores, one of 25 students who volunteer to teach English to
Stanford's janitors through Habla la Noche.
Zavaleta used to repair refrigerators in Mexico, before he
emigrated with his wife and two children four years ago. He
has had to abandon his trade in the United States because of
his limited English skills — and that is one of the reasons why
he began attending Habla la Noche.
"I want to better my English to have more jobs opportuni
ties in the future," he says, adding that working as a refrigera
tor repairperson is more lucrative than working as a janitor.
But the English that he learns, he says, is useful at work
now. If there is a coffee spill, for example, that someone needs
to have cleaned up, he can understand what he is being asked
to do. In addition to going over what is covered in the pre-set
curriculum, Zavaleta and Flores go over different workplace
scenarios such someone asking him to clean up a drink spill.
Flores, a sophomore, is a native Spanish speaker who
learned English in school, where she received a bilingual edu
cation. and from watching American TV shows.
While Zavaleta regularly reads Time and Sports
Illustrated magazines, he says he can't understand everything
he sees and hears on American TV. because "people speak
really fast." But Flores says that Zavaleta is improving.
"He is more comfortable speaking in English and he is
learning how to have conversations with non-Spanish speak
ers," she says.
Of the more than 100 janitors who clean campus build
ings at nighttime, about 15 to 20 participate in Habla la
Noche. That number has been as high as 30 at the beginning
of the quarter, and there are plans to draw as many as 60 to
80 janitors to the program throughout the rest of the academ
ic year.
Working with the Leadership Training and Education
Fund, a non-profit organization that provides worksite
English classes for janitors throughout Northern California,
Habla la Noche will add a third class time on Thursday nights
starting next week.
On Mondays and Tuesdays, janitors will .still meet with
their student tutors individually, which is the way the pro
gram has been structured since its inception three years ago.
On Thursdays, a professional instructor,Tanya Rose, a gradu
ate of the School of Education, will teach the entire group.
When Stanford students are away on breaks. Rose will teach
all three days by herself.
"I think that until they get used to having two different
setups — meaning the more informal tutoring session and
the more formal classes with me — it might seem strange to
them," Rose says. But I think the [different] structures are
complimentary because ... it may be difficult for me to give
them the individual attention they need."
To build relationships with the students is one of the rea
sons that the workers participate in the program.
Rafel Ramos has been attending tutoring sessions at
Habla la Noche for all of the three years he has been work
ing at Stanford. Ramos, who is 20 years old. is hard to single
out from the group of sophomores he regularly talks to when
he comes to El Centro. One Monday night two weeks ago. he

and his tutors were talking about movies and girls.
"I consider them to be my friends," Ramos says of his
tutors. Ramos came to the United States from Mexico four
years ago with his mom and aunt. Though his mom returned
to Mexico, he stayed so that he could help support his family;
he sends a part of his paycheck home each month.
Margarita Rodriguez, a mother of four who has been
working at Stanford for four years, has been attending Habla
la Noche for two years. She says she likes the program
because she likes getting to know the other janitors and the
students.
"1 like [to] talk with students and workers," Rodriguez
says."I like conversing with them. I like feeling like I have
friends on campus."
She once invited one of her former tutors, senior Paty
Hernandez, to her house for dinner and to her kids' birthday
parties. Hernandez says that the two "became good friends."
Rose, who is a research assistant for the Center on
Adolescence at the School of Education, will begin teaching
on Tuesday. Nov. 30. Throughout the year, she will also help
train the tutors.
"I am linking the tutors to more effective teaching prac
tices. I've been getting e-mails from the tutors because I
asked them to tell me about the janitors they are tutoring so
I can develop a curriculum," Rose said. "They've been asking
for suggestions on lessons. They don't have a lot of experi
ence but they obviously care about what's going on. That's
one of the most important components of this program."
In addition, the Leadership Training and Education Fund
has arranged with American Building Maintenance, which
employs Stanford's janitors, to give janitors who participate
in Habla la Noche an extra 30 minutes of break time. Using a
$500,000 California state grant that it received, the non-prof

it will pay American Building Maintenance so that extra peo
ple can be hired as janitors.
"We found that they found it difficult to have to give up
their whole lunch break to come to Habla la Noche," says
Alison Webber, executive director of the Leadership Training
and Education Fund." Also, they had to walk across campus
[which can take a long time] and since it was only twice a
week, it was hard to make progress."
Habla la Noche became a voluntary student organization
last year and received ASSU funding for the first time. The
group was started three years ago by the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition. But as an offshoot of another organization,
Habla la Noche was not very organized. That's when Nico
Sanchez, now a senior, and two friends heard about the pro
gram.
"During my freshman year, we wanted to help out."
Sanchez says. "We noticed that it was disorganized and we
asked SLAC if we could take it over. SLAC was cool
about it."
Since then, the group has matured and established a name
for itself on campus. At the beginning of the year, more than
100 students showed up to a meeting, and about 240 students
are on the group's e-mail list.
"Looking at three years ago. we didn't think that it would
get this big, this quickly ... the presence is absolutely unbe
lievable," Sanchez says. "More people know about it and
more people respect it. Incoming freshmen are very motivat
ed to be a part of it."
"You can say 'Habla la Noche' and people know about it.
Three years ago, we didn't have a name [and had to say] we
were doing this ESL program in El Centro," Sanchez adds.
The name, Habla la Noche, means "the night speaks" in
Spanish.
"The name just fits." says Hernandez, who used to tutor
and is now one of the coordinators of the program. "We meet
at night, and the students and workers are talking."
"Who ever hears them [the janitors]? Do people ever take
the time to listen to them?" Hernandez added.
Sanchez also emphasized the importance of helping
janitors.
"It's important that we are trying to make a part of the
community on campus more visible than it is. It's a communi
ty that helps us when we're not looking and we want to help
them back," says Sanchez, who is no longer involved with
Habla la Noche but is involved with a similar program, Habla
el Dia, which offers tutoring in English to daytime janitors.
Jessica Harris, a sophomore who is one of the coordinators
of Habla el Dia. says that the program is "an expansion" of
Habla la Noche and "reaches another population on cam
pus." Harris says that 95 percent of daytime janitors partici
pate in the program.
In addition. Harris says that it allows students who can't
tutor at 10 p.m. to become involved during the day.
The program, which launched spring quarter of last year,
uses the same curriculum that Habla la Noche uses. Harris
says the two programs have the same format and goals.
Habla la Noche has become a model for similar programs
at other universities, including nearby University of
California, Berkeley and Santa Clara University.
"Stanford's program has planted a seed to expand this
model," Webber, of the non-profit Leadership Training and
Education Fund. says. The organization runs on-site English
classes at 15 locations in the Bay Area, including the Hewlett-
Packard building in Cupertino. In 2005. the group plans to
add another 30 sites.

"During my freshman year, we wanted to help out."
Sanchez says. "We noticed that it was disorganized and we
asked SLAC if we could take it over. SLAC was cool
about it."
Since then, the group has matured and established a name
for itself on campus. At the beginning of the year, more than
100 students showed up to a meeting, and about 240 students
are on the group's e-mail list.
"Looking at three years ago. we didn't think that it would
get this big, this quickly ... the presence is absolutely unbe
lievable," Sanchez says. "More people know about it and
more people respect it. Incoming freshmen are very motivat
ed to be a part of it."
"You can say 'Habla la Noche' and people know about it.
Three years ago, we didn't have a name [and had to say] we
were doing this ESL program in El Centro," Sanchez adds.
The name, Habla la Noche, means "the night speaks" in
Spanish.
"The name just fits." says Hernandez, who used to tutor
and is now one of the coordinators of the program. "We meet
at night, and the students and workers are talking."
"Who ever hears them [the janitors]? Do people ever take
the time to listen to them?" Hernandez added.
Sanchez also emphasized the importance of helping
janitors.
"It's important that we are trying to make a part of the
community on campus more visible than it is. It's a communi
ty that helps us when we're not looking and we want to help
them back," says Sanchez, who is no longer involved with
Habla la Noche but is involved with a similar program, Habla
el Dia, which offers tutoring in English to daytime janitors.
Jessica Harris, a sophomore who is one of the coordinators
of Habla el Dia. says that the program is "an expansion" of
Habla la Noche and "reaches another population on cam
pus." Harris says that 95 percent of daytime janitors partici
pate in the program.
In addition. Harris says that it allows students who can't
tutor at 10 p.m. to become involved during the day.
The program, which launched spring quarter of last year,
uses the same curriculum that Habla la Noche uses. Harris
says the two programs have the same format and goals.
Habla la Noche has become a model for similar programs
at other universities, including nearby University of
California, Berkeley and Santa Clara University.
"Stanford's program has planted a seed to expand this
model," Webber, of the non-profit Leadership Training and
Education Fund. says. The organization runs on-site English
classes at 15 locations in the Bay Area, including the Hewlett-
Packard building in Cupertino. In 2005. the group plans to
add another 30 sites.

In El Centro Chicano, a student tutors a nighttime janitor in
English through Habla la Noche.
Every Monday and Tuesday night at 10 p.m., Evaristo
Zavaleta walks across campus from the Ginzton laboratory
building, where he works the nightshift as a janitor, to El
Centro Chicano to meet with Hada Flores during his lunch
break. For the past two years, he has been meeting with
Flores, one of 25 students who volunteer to teach English to
Stanford's janitors through Habla la Noche.
Zavaleta used to repair refrigerators in Mexico, before he
emigrated with his wife and two children four years ago. He
has had to abandon his trade in the United States because of
his limited English skills — and that is one of the reasons why
he began attending Habla la Noche.
"I want to better my English to have more jobs opportuni
ties in the future," he says, adding that working as a refrigera
tor repairperson is more lucrative than working as a janitor.
But the English that he learns, he says, is useful at work
now. If there is a coffee spill, for example, that someone needs
to have cleaned up, he can understand what he is being asked
to do. In addition to going over what is covered in the pre-set
curriculum, Zavaleta and Flores go over different workplace
scenarios such someone asking him to clean up a drink spill.
Flores, a sophomore, is a native Spanish speaker who
learned English in school, where she received a bilingual edu
cation. and from watching American TV shows.
While Zavaleta regularly reads Time and Sports
Illustrated magazines, he says he can't understand everything
he sees and hears on American TV. because "people speak
really fast." But Flores says that Zavaleta is improving.
"He is more comfortable speaking in English and he is
learning how to have conversations with non-Spanish speak
ers," she says.
Of the more than 100 janitors who clean campus build
ings at nighttime, about 15 to 20 participate in Habla la
Noche. That number has been as high as 30 at the beginning
of the quarter, and there are plans to draw as many as 60 to
80 janitors to the program throughout the rest of the academ
ic year.
Working with the Leadership Training and Education
Fund, a non-profit organization that provides worksite
English classes for janitors throughout Northern California,
Habla la Noche will add a third class time on Thursday nights
starting next week.
On Mondays and Tuesdays, janitors will .still meet with
their student tutors individually, which is the way the pro
gram has been structured since its inception three years ago.
On Thursdays, a professional instructor,Tanya Rose, a gradu
ate of the School of Education, will teach the entire group.
When Stanford students are away on breaks. Rose will teach
all three days by herself.
"I think that until they get used to having two different
setups — meaning the more informal tutoring session and
the more formal classes with me — it might seem strange to
them," Rose says. But I think the [different] structures are
complimentary because ... it may be difficult for me to give
them the individual attention they need."
To build relationships with the students is one of the rea
sons that the workers participate in the program.
Rafel Ramos has been attending tutoring sessions at
Habla la Noche for all of the three years he has been work
ing at Stanford. Ramos, who is 20 years old. is hard to single
out from the group of sophomores he regularly talks to when
he comes to El Centro. One Monday night two weeks ago. he

and his tutors were talking about movies and girls.
"I consider them to be my friends," Ramos says of his
tutors. Ramos came to the United States from Mexico four
years ago with his mom and aunt. Though his mom returned
to Mexico, he stayed so that he could help support his family;
he sends a part of his paycheck home each month.
Margarita Rodriguez, a mother of four who has been
working at Stanford for four years, has been attending Habla
la Noche for two years. She says she likes the program
because she likes getting to know the other janitors and the
students.
"1 like [to] talk with students and workers," Rodriguez
says."I like conversing with them. I like feeling like I have
friends on campus."
She once invited one of her former tutors, senior Paty
Hernandez, to her house for dinner and to her kids' birthday
parties. Hernandez says that the two "became good friends."
Rose, who is a research assistant for the Center on
Adolescence at the School of Education, will begin teaching
on Tuesday. Nov. 30. Throughout the year, she will also help
train the tutors.
"I am linking the tutors to more effective teaching prac
tices. I've been getting e-mails from the tutors because I
asked them to tell me about the janitors they are tutoring so
I can develop a curriculum," Rose said. "They've been asking
for suggestions on lessons. They don't have a lot of experi
ence but they obviously care about what's going on. That's
one of the most important components of this program."
In addition, the Leadership Training and Education Fund
has arranged with American Building Maintenance, which
employs Stanford's janitors, to give janitors who participate
in Habla la Noche an extra 30 minutes of break time. Using a
$500,000 California state grant that it received, the non-prof

it will pay American Building Maintenance so that extra peo
ple can be hired as janitors.
"We found that they found it difficult to have to give up
their whole lunch break to come to Habla la Noche," says
Alison Webber, executive director of the Leadership Training
and Education Fund." Also, they had to walk across campus
[which can take a long time] and since it was only twice a
week, it was hard to make progress."
Habla la Noche became a voluntary student organization
last year and received ASSU funding for the first time. The
group was started three years ago by the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition. But as an offshoot of another organization,
Habla la Noche was not very organized. That's when Nico
Sanchez, now a senior, and two friends heard about the pro
gram.
"During my freshman year, we wanted to help out."
Sanchez says. "We noticed that it was disorganized and we

Habla la Noche for all of the three years he has been work
ing at Stanford. Ramos, who is 20 years old. is hard to single
out from the group of sophomores he regularly talks to when
he comes to El Centro. One Monday night two weeks ago. he

and his tutors were talking about movies and girls.
"I consider them to be my friends," Ramos says of his
tutors. Ramos came to the United States from Mexico four
years ago with his mom and aunt. Though his mom returned
to Mexico, he stayed so that he could help support his family;
he sends a part of his paycheck home each month.
Margarita Rodriguez, a mother of four who has been
working at Stanford for four years, has been attending Habla
la Noche for two years. She says she likes the program
because she likes getting to know the other janitors and the
students.
"1 like [to] talk with students and workers," Rodriguez
says."I like conversing with them. I like feeling like I have
friends on campus."
She once invited one of her former tutors, senior Paty
Hernandez, to her house for dinner and to her kids' birthday
parties. Hernandez says that the two "became good friends."
Rose, who is a research assistant for the Center on
Adolescence at the School of Education, will begin teaching
on Tuesday. Nov. 30. Throughout the year, she will also help
train the tutors.
"I am linking the tutors to more effective teaching prac
tices. I've been getting e-mails from the tutors because I
asked them to tell me about the janitors they are tutoring so
I can develop a curriculum," Rose said. "They've been asking
for suggestions on lessons. They don't have a lot of experi
ence but they obviously care about what's going on. That's
one of the most important components of this program."
In addition, the Leadership Training and Education Fund
has arranged with American Building Maintenance, which
employs Stanford's janitors, to give janitors who participate
in Habla la Noche an extra 30 minutes of break time. Using a
$500,000 California state grant that it received, the non-prof

it will pay American Building Maintenance so that extra peo
ple can be hired as janitors.
"We found that they found it difficult to have to give up
their whole lunch break to come to Habla la Noche," says
Alison Webber, executive director of the Leadership Training
and Education Fund." Also, they had to walk across campus
[which can take a long time] and since it was only twice a
week, it was hard to make progress."
Habla la Noche became a voluntary student organization
last year and received ASSU funding for the first time. The
group was started three years ago by the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition. But as an offshoot of another organization,
Habla la Noche was not very organized. That's when Nico
Sanchez, now a senior, and two friends heard about the pro
gram.
"During my freshman year, we wanted to help out."
Sanchez says. "We noticed that it was disorganized and we
asked SLAC if we could take it over. SLAC was cool
about it."
Since then, the group has matured and established a name
for itself on campus. At the beginning of the year, more than
100 students showed up to a meeting, and about 240 students
are on the group's e-mail list.
"Looking at three years ago. we didn't think that it would
get this big, this quickly ... the presence is absolutely unbe
lievable," Sanchez says. "More people know about it and
more people respect it. Incoming freshmen are very motivat
ed to be a part of it."
"You can say 'Habla la Noche' and people know about it.
Three years ago, we didn't have a name [and had to say] we
were doing this ESL program in El Centro," Sanchez adds.
The name, Habla la Noche, means "the night speaks" in
Spanish.
"The name just fits." says Hernandez, who used to tutor
and is now one of the coordinators of the program. "We meet
at night, and the students and workers are talking."
"Who ever hears them [the janitors]? Do people ever take
the time to listen to them?" Hernandez added.
Sanchez also emphasized the importance of helping
janitors.
"It's important that we are trying to make a part of the
community on campus more visible than it is. It's a communi
ty that helps us when we're not looking and we want to help
them back," says Sanchez, who is no longer involved with
Habla la Noche but is involved with a similar program, Habla
el Dia, which offers tutoring in English to daytime janitors.
Jessica Harris, a sophomore who is one of the coordinators
of Habla el Dia. says that the program is "an expansion" of
Habla la Noche and "reaches another population on cam
pus." Harris says that 95 percent of daytime janitors partici
pate in the program.
In addition. Harris says that it allows students who can't
tutor at 10 p.m. to become involved during the day.
The program, which launched spring quarter of last year,
uses the same curriculum that Habla la Noche uses. Harris
says the two programs have the same format and goals.
Habla la Noche has become a model for similar programs
at other universities, including nearby University of
California, Berkeley and Santa Clara University.
"Stanford's program has planted a seed to expand this
model," Webber, of the non-profit Leadership Training and
Education Fund. says. The organization runs on-site English
classes at 15 locations in the Bay Area, including the Hewlett-
Packard building in Cupertino. In 2005. the group plans to
add another 30 sites.
