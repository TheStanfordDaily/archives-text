# Navigating the campus blind, senior excels
## 
### CHRIS PEDREGAL 
You've probably seen Tyler Dumm some
where on campus. He walks with a deter
mined stride, whistling as he goes. If you stop
and talk to him. you will find that his voice is
deep and welcoming. And when you shake
his hand, it is strong and steady.
With his cane leading the way, Dumm
finds his way through crowds of people or
rogue bicycles, going from check point to
check point — never missing a step, never
hesitating. In the lecture hall, he moves
down the aisle row by row, asking if there is
space. When he finds a seat, he takes out his
Braille computer and is ready for class.
Dumm, a senior majoring in human biol
ogy with a minor in psychology, grew up in
Carpinteria, a small town not far south of
Santa Barbara. When he was one-and-a-half
years old he was diagnosed with retinal blas
toma, a soft tissue cancer of the retina.
Radiation therapy was unsuccessful, and
when the tumor spread to his left eye, the
doctors had no choice but to operate. Both of
his eyes were removed and replaced by pros
thetic implants, making him blind for life.
Dumm speaks about his new eyes with a
touch of pride.
"My parents decided to make them a mix
of the whole family," Dumm said. "So in my
eyes, you can see the green from my brother,
the patterns from my mother, and some blue
from my Dad."
Dumm still remembers some colors from
before the operation, especially greens and
blues.
"As I get older, the memories fade
because they are not reaffirmed and
enforced by everyday reality. They become
more of a concept of color than a memory."
When Dumm was ten years old. he was
diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a related type
of cancer, in his left leg. After a round of
chemotherapy, he decided to have his leg
amputated instead of pursuing other possi

ble treatment plans.
"I saw amputation as a way to resume my
normal, active life as quickly as possible,"
Dumm said.
After the operation, it took him three
months to learn how to walk, and a few
years for it to become second nature. Since
then. Dumm has been cancer-free.
His parents decided to put him in the
public school system, and he loved it. With
support from his parents and a specialist
who taught him how to get around and func
tion as a blind individual. Dumm had what
he describes as an "awesome experience."
Dumm was salutorian of his high school
graduating class and captain of the track
team his senior year.
"Everybody knew who 1 was.and
respected me for that rather than categoriz
ing me," he said.
Stanford was Dumm's top choice for col
lege, a decision influenced in part by the
quality of the Disability Resource Center,
which provides services for about l )(X) stu
dents.
"Stanford is far and above the best in
terms of disabled student accommodation."
he said.
At first, mobility was an issue for Dumm
since he had to learn his away around the
large, open campus. Over the years, howev
er. he has learned new paths and can now go
virtually anywhere.
Dumm believes moving to Stanford was
easy because his parents did a great job at
exposing him to diverse situations and
opportunities.
"I definitely consider most of my experi
ences freshman year and sophomore year,
when 1 was getting used to Stanford, as unre
lated to being blind." he said.
For example, during his freshman year he
was part of the wrestling club and now goes
rock climbing several hours every week.
However, classes take up most of
Dumm's schedule.
"If I am reading Braille or listening

through a document, it just invariably takes
me more time than other people," Dumm
said. "So I'm not always able to do all the fun
things like go to Monterey or go to some
party."
While some of his textbooks are in
Braille, most of the time they are recorded
on tape. Dumm works on his laptop using a
program called Jaws, which lets him navigate
menus using audio prompts.
One thing that has frustrated Dumm is
that often he cannot access class materials
on time. Professors do not always send the
materials to the disability center in time for
them to be adapted, which is particularly
hard during midterms or finals. He fre
quently has to push and remind the profes
sors.
"I don't want to blame anybody for who
I am. that's just ridiculous." Dumm said. "So
1 have to walk the line between being
assertive and yet learn to be accommodating
at the same time, because people are accom
modating my needs."
Some people don't always know how to
act towards him, but most are very open.
Dumm said.
"I really appreciate it when people come
up to me and are like, hey how do you do
this? Who are you? What kind of person are
you?" Dumm said. "Because that means that
they are willing to get to know me on neutral
ground."
Dumm has made many close friends at
Stanford and has just celebrated his one
year anniversary with his girlfriend. Dumm
plans on going to graduate school for three
years, and after that, he is not really sure
where he is headed. At some point, he hopes
to become a physical therapist.
He says that if he were given the option
to see again, he would turn it down.
"For me, to all of a sudden switch to hav
ing vision would be at odds with everything
that 1 have come to understand and use to
define my reality." he said. "Changing that
would mean changing who 1 am."

when 1 was getting used to Stanford, as unre
lated to being blind." he said.
For example, during his freshman year he
was part of the wrestling club and now goes
rock climbing several hours every week.
However, classes take up most of
Dumm's schedule.
"If I am reading Braille or listening

through a document, it just invariably takes
me more time than other people," Dumm
said. "So I'm not always able to do all the fun
things like go to Monterey or go to some
party."
While some of his textbooks are in
Braille, most of the time they are recorded
on tape. Dumm works on his laptop using a
program called Jaws, which lets him navigate
menus using audio prompts.
One thing that has frustrated Dumm is
that often he cannot access class materials
on time. Professors do not always send the
materials to the disability center in time for
them to be adapted, which is particularly
hard during midterms or finals. He fre
quently has to push and remind the profes
sors.
"I don't want to blame anybody for who
I am. that's just ridiculous." Dumm said. "So
1 have to walk the line between being
assertive and yet learn to be accommodating
at the same time, because people are accom
modating my needs."
Some people don't always know how to
act towards him, but most are very open.
Dumm said.
"I really appreciate it when people come
up to me and are like, hey how do you do
this? Who are you? What kind of person are
you?" Dumm said. "Because that means that
they are willing to get to know me on neutral
ground."
Dumm has made many close friends at
Stanford and has just celebrated his one
year anniversary with his girlfriend. Dumm
plans on going to graduate school for three
years, and after that, he is not really sure
where he is headed. At some point, he hopes
to become a physical therapist.
He says that if he were given the option
to see again, he would turn it down.
"For me, to all of a sudden switch to hav
ing vision would be at odds with everything
that 1 have come to understand and use to
define my reality." he said. "Changing that
would mean changing who 1 am."

Tyler Dumm, senior, plays a game of chess.
You've probably seen Tyler Dumm some
where on campus. He walks with a deter
mined stride, whistling as he goes. If you stop
and talk to him. you will find that his voice is
deep and welcoming. And when you shake
his hand, it is strong and steady.
With his cane leading the way, Dumm
finds his way through crowds of people or
rogue bicycles, going from check point to
check point — never missing a step, never
hesitating. In the lecture hall, he moves
down the aisle row by row, asking if there is
space. When he finds a seat, he takes out his
Braille computer and is ready for class.
Dumm, a senior majoring in human biol
ogy with a minor in psychology, grew up in
Carpinteria, a small town not far south of
Santa Barbara. When he was one-and-a-half
years old he was diagnosed with retinal blas
toma, a soft tissue cancer of the retina.
Radiation therapy was unsuccessful, and
when the tumor spread to his left eye, the
doctors had no choice but to operate. Both of
his eyes were removed and replaced by pros
thetic implants, making him blind for life.
Dumm speaks about his new eyes with a
touch of pride.
"My parents decided to make them a mix
of the whole family," Dumm said. "So in my
eyes, you can see the green from my brother,
the patterns from my mother, and some blue
from my Dad."
Dumm still remembers some colors from
before the operation, especially greens and
blues.
"As I get older, the memories fade
because they are not reaffirmed and
enforced by everyday reality. They become
more of a concept of color than a memory."
When Dumm was ten years old. he was
diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a related type
of cancer, in his left leg. After a round of
chemotherapy, he decided to have his leg
amputated instead of pursuing other possi

ble treatment plans.
"I saw amputation as a way to resume my
normal, active life as quickly as possible,"
Dumm said.
After the operation, it took him three
months to learn how to walk, and a few
years for it to become second nature. Since
then. Dumm has been cancer-free.
His parents decided to put him in the
public school system, and he loved it. With
support from his parents and a specialist
who taught him how to get around and func
tion as a blind individual. Dumm had what
he describes as an "awesome experience."
Dumm was salutorian of his high school
graduating class and captain of the track
team his senior year.
"Everybody knew who 1 was.and
respected me for that rather than categoriz
ing me," he said.
Stanford was Dumm's top choice for col
lege, a decision influenced in part by the
quality of the Disability Resource Center,
which provides services for about l )(X) stu
dents.
"Stanford is far and above the best in
terms of disabled student accommodation."
he said.
At first, mobility was an issue for Dumm
since he had to learn his away around the
large, open campus. Over the years, howev
er. he has learned new paths and can now go
virtually anywhere.
Dumm believes moving to Stanford was
easy because his parents did a great job at
exposing him to diverse situations and
opportunities.
"I definitely consider most of my experi
ences freshman year and sophomore year,
