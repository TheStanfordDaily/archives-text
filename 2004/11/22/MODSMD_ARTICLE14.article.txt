## Readership Editor Psychiatric ward story a questionable priority 
### JEN GRAHAM 
Last Monday, The Daily's read
ers looked one of two ways: deeply
troubled or deeply enthralled.
What eould simultaneously cause
furrowed brows and bugged-out
eyes? A juicy tale about a Stanford
student's trip to the psychiatric ward.
I'he headline "Vaden doctor sends
depressed student to psychiatric
ward" led the Nov. 15 paper, creat
ing a buzz around campus — some
thing (no offense, guys) most Daily
stories just don't do.
Some readers found it fascinating.
It had all the components of a good
narrative: an angry victim, yet anoth
er example of Vaden's incompetence,
theft and a look into the scary world
of a mental hospital. What a fun read
on a Monday morning.
But other readers seemed con
tused. not understanding why a sin
gle student's trip to the hospital was
so important to campus, and
whether it was truly even "news."
And beyond whether it was news,
was it any of The Daily's or its read
ers' business?
In the past, largely because of the
taboo surrounding mental health.
The Daily has avoided addressing
such issues — either out of a sense of
privacy for the students involved or
because piecing together a story
when no one will talk is impossible.
I can't remember the last time an
article about an attempted suicide at
Stanford ran in The Daily, though
these attempts happen, and about
once or twice a year The Daily's staff
catches wind of them.
This sort of self-censorship is un
fortunate. because it brushes under
the rug many pertinent issues that ul
timately are not discussed because
people are too afraid to bring them
up. Some readers have a visceral
negative reaction to seeing someone
ma delicate state exposed to campus
but if the story is handled well, is
the alternative of entirely ignoring
the issue a better solution?
1 argue not, and for that reason
commend the staff of this volume's
Daily for finally tackling the sensitive

issue of mental health on campus.
However — and this is a big how
ever — The Daily's attempt missed
the mark. It focused on a single, un
corroborated incident; it focused
more on a exceptional tale than on
the broader trends and problems;
and in the end, it seemed like the
paper made a mountain out of a
molehill.
In doing so, the story may have
damaged future attempts The Daily
makes to discuss mental health by
failing to show readers that these is
sues can be addressed in a way that is
both sensitive and constructive —
not sensationalist.
The question here is not "Are
mental health issues at Stanford
news." They are. But they're only
newsworthy if they are presented
and focused on in a manner worthy
of The Daily and its readership. On
this point. The Daily fell short on
several counts.
The first decision deals with what
kind of story this was — a hard news
story, or a feature? By placing it as
the paper's lead article. The Daily
presented this story as "hard news"
— an event that just happened and is
of consequence or a pressing issue
that readers need to be aware of.
It's hard to claim that this article,
a story about a student who felt mis
treated by Vaden, is pressing or
hard-hitting news — especially
when the student had been released,
and in the short term the matter had
been resolved. Mis-marketing this
story probably attributed to some of
the negative reaction surrounding it,
since it didn't feel like a "news" story
to readers.
Beyond marketing the story, an
important question is, did it focus on
what mattered? There are aspects of
this story that were newsworthy. Un
fortunately. they weren't the focus of
this article.
For example, that there are be
tween one and three Stanford stu
dents at Stanford Hospital's inpa
tient psychiatry ward at any given
time is a story. The fact that Vaden
doctors can and do use their legal
ability to commit students who they

fear may he a danger to themselves
or to others is also a story.
Editors at The Daily argue that
this was precisely what they tried to
convey in this story.
That's not what I got. Instead. I
read a play-hy-play of a single stu
dent's bad experience, with no sug
gestion that his story pointed to a
chronic issue or even that his account
was representative.
It's also hard to argue that the
focus of the story is on the way Stan
ford deals with mental health when
the headline on the inside page reads
"Student loses shoes, bike." While
such a headline is not necessarily
representative of a story as a whole,
the bulk of the story on page two is
an extensive list of the students'
grievances. If there is nothing more
salient to highlight than a stolen pair
of shoes, is the story really achieving
the editors' intended goals?
In many ways, this story was an
anomaly. For one, the student who in
the story was sent to the psychiatric
ward came to The Daily with the
story and offered to go on record,
under his own name. While he didn't
see privacy as an issue, none of the
medical professionals involved with
the incident could be interviewed be
cause of concerns for privacy. Thus
the bulk of this story became a one
source diatribe.
As a result, the paper focused on
the student's story, and it's not clear
to me this story was newsworthy.
As a reader, 1 can't put much
stock in a story where the credibility
hinges on one unnamed source. Fur
thermore, without proof that the
issue is one affecting more people
than just a single student, a story that
I may have appreciated as an inter
esting look at depression at Stanford
instead rubs me the wrong way be
cause I feel the paper is exploiting
the hardship of an individual student
— for nothing more than a juicy
story.

but if the story is handled well, is
the alternative of entirely ignoring
the issue a better solution?
1 argue not, and for that reason
commend the staff of this volume's
Daily for finally tackling the sensitive

issue of mental health on campus.
However — and this is a big how
ever — The Daily's attempt missed
the mark. It focused on a single, un
corroborated incident; it focused
more on a exceptional tale than on
the broader trends and problems;
and in the end, it seemed like the
paper made a mountain out of a
molehill.
In doing so, the story may have
damaged future attempts The Daily
makes to discuss mental health by
failing to show readers that these is
sues can be addressed in a way that is
both sensitive and constructive —
not sensationalist.
The question here is not "Are
mental health issues at Stanford
news." They are. But they're only
newsworthy if they are presented
and focused on in a manner worthy
of The Daily and its readership. On
this point. The Daily fell short on
several counts.
The first decision deals with what
kind of story this was — a hard news
story, or a feature? By placing it as
the paper's lead article. The Daily
presented this story as "hard news"
— an event that just happened and is
of consequence or a pressing issue
that readers need to be aware of.
It's hard to claim that this article,
a story about a student who felt mis
treated by Vaden, is pressing or
hard-hitting news — especially
when the student had been released,
and in the short term the matter had
been resolved. Mis-marketing this
story probably attributed to some of
the negative reaction surrounding it,
since it didn't feel like a "news" story
to readers.
Beyond marketing the story, an
important question is, did it focus on
what mattered? There are aspects of
this story that were newsworthy. Un
fortunately. they weren't the focus of
this article.
For example, that there are be
tween one and three Stanford stu
dents at Stanford Hospital's inpa
tient psychiatry ward at any given
time is a story. The fact that Vaden
doctors can and do use their legal
ability to commit students who they

fear may he a danger to themselves
or to others is also a story.
Editors at The Daily argue that
this was precisely what they tried to
convey in this story.
That's not what I got. Instead. I
read a play-hy-play of a single stu
dent's bad experience, with no sug
gestion that his story pointed to a
chronic issue or even that his account
was representative.
It's also hard to argue that the
focus of the story is on the way Stan
ford deals with mental health when
the headline on the inside page reads
"Student loses shoes, bike." While
such a headline is not necessarily
representative of a story as a whole,
the bulk of the story on page two is
an extensive list of the students'
grievances. If there is nothing more
salient to highlight than a stolen pair
of shoes, is the story really achieving
the editors' intended goals?
In many ways, this story was an
anomaly. For one, the student who in
the story was sent to the psychiatric
ward came to The Daily with the
story and offered to go on record,
under his own name. While he didn't
see privacy as an issue, none of the
medical professionals involved with
the incident could be interviewed be
cause of concerns for privacy. Thus
the bulk of this story became a one
source diatribe.
As a result, the paper focused on
the student's story, and it's not clear
to me this story was newsworthy.
As a reader, 1 can't put much
stock in a story where the credibility
hinges on one unnamed source. Fur
thermore, without proof that the
issue is one affecting more people
than just a single student, a story that
I may have appreciated as an inter
esting look at depression at Stanford
instead rubs me the wrong way be
cause I feel the paper is exploiting
the hardship of an individual student
— for nothing more than a juicy
story.

Last Monday, The Daily's read
ers looked one of two ways: deeply
troubled or deeply enthralled.
What eould simultaneously cause
furrowed brows and bugged-out
eyes? A juicy tale about a Stanford
student's trip to the psychiatric ward.
I'he headline "Vaden doctor sends
depressed student to psychiatric
ward" led the Nov. 15 paper, creat
ing a buzz around campus — some
thing (no offense, guys) most Daily
stories just don't do.
Some readers found it fascinating.
It had all the components of a good
narrative: an angry victim, yet anoth
er example of Vaden's incompetence,
theft and a look into the scary world
of a mental hospital. What a fun read
on a Monday morning.
But other readers seemed con
tused. not understanding why a sin
gle student's trip to the hospital was
so important to campus, and
whether it was truly even "news."
And beyond whether it was news,
was it any of The Daily's or its read
ers' business?
In the past, largely because of the
taboo surrounding mental health.
The Daily has avoided addressing
such issues — either out of a sense of
privacy for the students involved or
because piecing together a story
when no one will talk is impossible.
I can't remember the last time an
article about an attempted suicide at
Stanford ran in The Daily, though
these attempts happen, and about
once or twice a year The Daily's staff
catches wind of them.
This sort of self-censorship is un
fortunate. because it brushes under
the rug many pertinent issues that ul
timately are not discussed because
people are too afraid to bring them
up. Some readers have a visceral
negative reaction to seeing someone
ma delicate state exposed to campus
but if the story is handled well, is
the alternative of entirely ignoring
the issue a better solution?
