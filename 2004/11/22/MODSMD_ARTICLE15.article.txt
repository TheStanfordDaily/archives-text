## Don't shirk your obligation to pay ITSS bills 
### JONATHAN HAYNES 
Last Thursday, The Daily ran a
cover story suggesting that not paying
ITSS bills makes economic sense
("Not paying ITSS bills makes eco
nomic sense?" Nov. 18). ITSS
presently does not charge late fees or
interest on past-due phone, cable and
Internet service balances. The article
notes that one student stopped paying
her ITSS bills regularly this year since
"it's annoying to have to pay a bill
every month and with ITSS there's no
penalty, so why not just pay it once a
year?"
A junior says,"I don't pay them
because I don't get charged if I don't."
A Stanford economics professor
explains this behavior as students
"merely being economically ratio
nal." He goes on to say "Once it's
known that they [the University]
won't come after you if you don't pay.
no one will pay."
The truth is, paying ITSS bills not
only makes economic sense, it's also
the right thing to do if you care about
the Stanford community. Here are
the facts: ITSS increased in-room net
work connection fees from $10 to $12
this year tocover unfunded facility (or
overhead) costs.
They have been running an opera
tional deficit the last few years to keep

costs down while looking for ways to
further contain costs to keep our bills
low. As the financial officer of the
Graduate Student Council. I can tell
you first-hand that ITSS has some ex
tremely sharp and dedicated staff who
give their all every day to keep costs as
low as possible for all of us living on
campus.
Not paying your ITSS bill means
the University has to waste staff time
and money to collect on chronically
delinquent accounts and / or must
write-off uncollectible accounts.
It may be the University doesn't
charge penalties on over-due ITSS ac
counts out of good faith toward the
student community or, "rationally"
speaking as a former IT strategy con
sultant, I know it is expensive to col
lect on delinquent accounts. Either
way, all the free riders out there
among us are increasing ITSS costs
for everyone who does pay his bill on
time.
But there's a much more impor
tant principle at stake here than the
eventual triviality of an ITSS bill. In
last week's article, a Stanford eco
nomics professor not only supports
students not paying bills if you can get
away with it. but provides legitimacy
for this given his status as a Stanford
faculty member.
If ITSS has increased uncollectible

accounts after last week's article, I
suggest ITSS send the bill to the De
partment of Economics along with
the note, "Rationalize this."
Just because there are no personal
consequences to an action doesn't
make the action right.
A degree from a selective universi
ty and the operating principle, "It's
not wrong if there aren't conse
quences,' is the same combination
that gave us Enron. Tyco, World Com
and many more corporate scandals
over the last few years. Was Andy
Fastow, Enron's CFO, "merely being
economically rational" when he con
cealed off-balance sheet accounts in
an effort to inflate his own personal
wealth, given he didn't believe there
would be consequences since it was
unlikely such complicated transac
tions would be caught?
The most important lesson of a lib
eral arts education should be teaching
character and ethics through the per
sonal example of all Stanford faculty
members, as personal integrity
among future generations will pay
dividends to our society as a whole.
