Palestinian leadership should not
include terrorist groups
A quote from Thursday's article
("Students React To Arafat's
Death." Nov. 18) summed up the
whole problem with the revisionist
version of "Arafat the statesman."
Marwan Hanania states that "If the
person who's elected is able to bring
in Hamas and Islamic Jihad and
Palestinian groups within the leader
ship. then there might be some hope,
some reason for optimism."
I think that an inclusive Palestini
an constituency is a good idea in prin
ciple. But why on earth should Hamas
or Islamic Jihad, groups chiefly asso
ciated with murdering civilians, be in
cluded? Terrorism, besides killing
people, means giving up on legitimate
political processes. To legitimize ter
rorists as "leadership" can do nothing
but d(x>m the peace process.

Did Arafat's own reign teach us
anything, if not that?

Football team needs adjustments
Three years. Three losing seasons.
Three losses in Big Game, each one
worse than its predecessor. Three sea
sons of finishing worse than they
started. Three years of poor disci
pline. Three years of poor halftime
adjustments. Three years of inconsis
tent. uninspiring football. Three years
of some of the worst college football
coaching Stanford has seen in at least
a quarter-century.
I feel genuinely sorry for the stu
dent-athletes who have played under
the Buddy Teevens regime.
The lack of discipline is what both
ers me most. Stanford football

showed little class in Saturday's loss at
Cal — and it wasn't the only time in
the Teevens era. Coach Teevens did
not bench any of the three players
who committed dead-ball personal
fouls in Big (lame, even though two
of them were in the final five minutes
when the game's outcome was al
ready decided. 1 doubt whether
Teevens would have benched Leigh
Torrence had he not been ejected
after his second personal foul.
This is losing without class, and ap
parently Teevens tolerates it. By
sharp contrast. Cal Coach Tedford
was in the face of his player who com
mitted a personal foul late in the
game, and Tedford benched him.
Ted Leland. can you hear me?
You should be able to at least hear the
echo of my voice in the emptiness that
was Stanford Stadium this fall.
You want to fill it back up? Fire
Buddy Teevens and bring in a head

football coach with a record of suc
cess, progress, discipline, class and
achievement in Division I-A.

Poor sportsmanship is worse than
poor Big Game performance
While 1 am disappointed at the loss
to Berkeley, I am more disappointed
at the conduct on the field.
Heretofore the cheap shots and
the hooliganism were pretty much the
purview of "them," not us.
As an adjunct, a lot of the errors
were pure coaching errors. The entire
coaching staff is not without blame —
not only for the loss but also for the
conduct.
1 hope as the members of the foot
ball varsity team start to grow up. they
will outgrow the antics and act like

true representatives of the University.

Support the president in wartime
Will Nelson's opinion in Friday's
Daily is superb ("Does the world still
believe in Democracy?" Nov. 19). He
has described expertly a major prob
lem of perspective present both in the
American and foreign media's cover
age of the Iraqi insurgency. What's
even more harrowing to me is a grow
ing political association between the
U.S. military and President George
W. Bush
Coming from a military family,
this reminds me all too much of the as
sociations drawn by the anti-war
movement during the Vietnam War.
Up to this point, critics of the Bush ad
ministration have been careful to toe

the patriotic line in public, but I sus
pect that as it becomes evident that
Bush's political credibility is tied to
the success of Iraqi liberation, there
will be a growing trend among the left
to exaggerate U.S. failure for their
own political gain.
This is a dangerous slippery slope,
and I fear that soon we'll have an op
position party holding no punches —
aimed at discrediting both the present
administration and the United States
itself in foreign affairs.
This is where I hope Democratic
leadership will step up to the chal
lenge of supporting a wartime presi
dent. despite his political affiliations.
In short. I'm asking LX*mocrats to ask
not what their country is doing wrong,
but what wrong is being done to their
country.

Will Nelson's opinion in Friday's
Daily is superb ("Does the world still
believe in Democracy?" Nov. 19). He
has described expertly a major prob
lem of perspective present both in the
American and foreign media's cover
age of the Iraqi insurgency. What's
even more harrowing to me is a grow
ing political association between the
U.S. military and President George
W. Bush
Coming from a military family,
this reminds me all too much of the as
sociations drawn by the anti-war
movement during the Vietnam War.
Up to this point, critics of the Bush ad
ministration have been careful to toe

the patriotic line in public, but I sus
pect that as it becomes evident that
Bush's political credibility is tied to
the success of Iraqi liberation, there
will be a growing trend among the left
to exaggerate U.S. failure for their
own political gain.
This is a dangerous slippery slope,
and I fear that soon we'll have an op
position party holding no punches —
aimed at discrediting both the present
administration and the United States
itself in foreign affairs.
This is where I hope Democratic
leadership will step up to the chal
lenge of supporting a wartime presi
dent. despite his political affiliations.
In short. I'm asking LX*mocrats to ask
not what their country is doing wrong,
but what wrong is being done to their
country.

Palestinian leadership should not
include terrorist groups
A quote from Thursday's article
("Students React To Arafat's
Death." Nov. 18) summed up the
whole problem with the revisionist
version of "Arafat the statesman."
Marwan Hanania states that "If the
person who's elected is able to bring
in Hamas and Islamic Jihad and
Palestinian groups within the leader
ship. then there might be some hope,
some reason for optimism."
I think that an inclusive Palestini
an constituency is a good idea in prin
ciple. But why on earth should Hamas
or Islamic Jihad, groups chiefly asso
ciated with murdering civilians, be in
cluded? Terrorism, besides killing
people, means giving up on legitimate
political processes. To legitimize ter
rorists as "leadership" can do nothing
but d(x>m the peace process.

Did Arafat's own reign teach us
anything, if not that?

Football team needs adjustments
Three years. Three losing seasons.
Three losses in Big Game, each one
worse than its predecessor. Three sea
sons of finishing worse than they
started. Three years of poor disci
pline. Three years of poor halftime
adjustments. Three years of inconsis
tent. uninspiring football. Three years
of some of the worst college football
coaching Stanford has seen in at least
a quarter-century.
I feel genuinely sorry for the stu
dent-athletes who have played under
the Buddy Teevens regime.
The lack of discipline is what both
ers me most. Stanford football

showed little class in Saturday's loss at
Cal — and it wasn't the only time in
the Teevens era. Coach Teevens did
not bench any of the three players
who committed dead-ball personal
fouls in Big (lame, even though two
of them were in the final five minutes
when the game's outcome was al
ready decided. 1 doubt whether
Teevens would have benched Leigh
Torrence had he not been ejected
after his second personal foul.
This is losing without class, and ap
parently Teevens tolerates it. By
sharp contrast. Cal Coach Tedford
was in the face of his player who com
mitted a personal foul late in the
game, and Tedford benched him.
Ted Leland. can you hear me?
You should be able to at least hear the
echo of my voice in the emptiness that
was Stanford Stadium this fall.
You want to fill it back up? Fire
Buddy Teevens and bring in a head

football coach with a record of suc
cess, progress, discipline, class and
achievement in Division I-A.

Poor sportsmanship is worse than
poor Big Game performance
While 1 am disappointed at the loss
to Berkeley, I am more disappointed
at the conduct on the field.
Heretofore the cheap shots and
the hooliganism were pretty much the
purview of "them," not us.
As an adjunct, a lot of the errors
were pure coaching errors. The entire
coaching staff is not without blame —
not only for the loss but also for the
conduct.
1 hope as the members of the foot
ball varsity team start to grow up. they
will outgrow the antics and act like

true representatives of the University.
