## World needs a stronger stance against radicalism 
### 
The slayings of Dutch film
maker Theo van Gogh and
Iraqi CARE Director Mar
garet Hassan should em
bolden Europe and the free world to
take a stronger, less tolerant stance to
ward Islamic radicalism. It makes no
sense to denounce brutal acts of ter
rorism and then allow countries to be
porous to the extremists who commit
them.
Make no mistake about it: The
perpetrators of these crimes are evil,
and their sympathizers in the Nether
lands should leave the country. As
Dutch right-wing lawmaker Geert
Wilders put it."The Netherlands has
been too tolerant to intolerant people
for too long."
Wilders and the Dutch are out
raged by the slaying of van Gogh, the
great-grandson of the legendary artist
and a controversial filmmaker whose
works have often been critical of or
ganized religion. Van Gogh recently
produced a television drama criticiz
ing the treatment of women in some
Muslim countries, and was subse
quently stabbed and shot in the head
by radical Islamists in an Amsterdam
street as he pleaded for his life. A note
was left by his body threatening to kill
politicians who rubbed them the
wrong way, as well.
A video posted online offers par
adise for the beheading of Wilders.
who is currently being hidden and
protected by government authorities.
Wilders should be lauded for hav
ing the courage to speak up. Much of
his concern stems frc>m studies that re
veal that 10 percent of the Dutch
Muslim population — or 100,000
people — support Islamist views.
Free democracies that value diver
sity and dissent cannot tolerate mur
derers and apologists who believe in
timidation and violence are justified
means to accomplishing fascist ends.
They should be deported or prosecut
ed immediately.
Islamic fanaticism did not start on
Sept. 11 and won't stop with an inci
dent m I lolland. It has traumatized in
nocents in Spain, Bali, Turkey, In
donesia and a slew of other nations,
and it threatens anyone who believes
that their rights to free speech and in

We owe it to ourselves, and to

to speak up. Europe should act to
close down radical mosques and ar
rest or deport imams who speak of
jihad and reprisal against the West.
As Wilders said, "If in a mosque
there is recruitment for jihad, it's not a
house of prayer.

It's a house of war.
If it's not a house
of prayer, it
should he closed
down."
Europe must
do what it can to
preserve its val
ues. territorial in
tegrity and way of
life without im
pinging on the lib-

erties and democratic foundations the
free world is fighting to protect.
Strong U.S. and European collabora
tion is key to shutting down institu
tions and schools that teach anti-
Western. anti-"infidel" hatred to chil
dren.
No other people have more at
stake than Muslims. It goes without
saying that radical Islamists should
not be considered Muslims. Yet these
radicals are setting the agenda in the
Muslim world and producing harmful
images and representations of Mus
lims globally.
The Oct. 30 car bombings at al-
Arabiya's Baghdad offices under
score the dangers posed to Muslims.
Though al-Arabiya, meaning "the
Arab one." has consistently opposed
the war, it was attacked by radicals
presumably for not airing coverage as
harsh, incendiary and senseless as al-
Jazeera's. Seven people died in those
attacks, which drew consternation
throughout the Muslim world.
As one Iraqi woman asked,
"When you enter the Islamist Web
sites and you find those militants say
ing 'In the name of God and Islam,'
what Islam are they talking about?"
Both Muslims and non-Muslims
have much at stake. Democratic gov
ernments committed to the values of
freedom, human dignity and pluralist
discourse must work together, and the
free world must take action to stop
those who are inclined to use terror to
advance heinous ends.

people — support Islamist views.
Free democracies that value diver
sity and dissent cannot tolerate mur
derers and apologists who believe in
timidation and violence are justified
means to accomplishing fascist ends.
They should be deported or prosecut
ed immediately.
Islamic fanaticism did not start on
Sept. 11 and won't stop with an inci
dent m I lolland. It has traumatized in
nocents in Spain, Bali, Turkey, In
donesia and a slew of other nations,
and it threatens anyone who believes
that their rights to free speech and in
dependent deliberation are inalien
able and nonnegotiable.
We owe it to ourselves, and to
moderate and liberal Muslims being
squeezed out and silenced by terror.

to speak up. Europe should act to
close down radical mosques and ar
rest or deport imams who speak of
jihad and reprisal against the West.
As Wilders said, "If in a mosque
there is recruitment for jihad, it's not a
house of prayer.

It's a house of war.
If it's not a house
of prayer, it
should he closed
down."
Europe must
do what it can to
preserve its val
ues. territorial in
tegrity and way of
life without im
pinging on the lib-

erties and democratic foundations the
free world is fighting to protect.
Strong U.S. and European collabora
tion is key to shutting down institu
tions and schools that teach anti-
Western. anti-"infidel" hatred to chil
dren.
No other people have more at
stake than Muslims. It goes without
saying that radical Islamists should
not be considered Muslims. Yet these
radicals are setting the agenda in the
Muslim world and producing harmful
images and representations of Mus
lims globally.
The Oct. 30 car bombings at al-
Arabiya's Baghdad offices under
score the dangers posed to Muslims.
Though al-Arabiya, meaning "the
Arab one." has consistently opposed
the war, it was attacked by radicals
presumably for not airing coverage as
harsh, incendiary and senseless as al-
Jazeera's. Seven people died in those
attacks, which drew consternation
throughout the Muslim world.
As one Iraqi woman asked,
"When you enter the Islamist Web
sites and you find those militants say
ing 'In the name of God and Islam,'
what Islam are they talking about?"
Both Muslims and non-Muslims
have much at stake. Democratic gov
ernments committed to the values of
freedom, human dignity and pluralist
discourse must work together, and the
free world must take action to stop
those who are inclined to use terror to
advance heinous ends.
