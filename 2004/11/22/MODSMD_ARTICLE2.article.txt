## Players lose their cool as Cal dominates, 41-6 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal rolled into Berkeley Saturday
seeking a tremendous upset. But they never found
the end zone and lost their composure in the sec
ond half.
By the time the dust settled on the overcast,
windy afternoon matchup. No. 4 California stood
on the strong side of a 41-6 score.
Stanford ended the season with its fifth consec
utive loss, while the Bears earned their fifth
straight victory. It was by far the Cardinal's worst
loss of the season — as well as their worst Big
Game loss since they were defeated 41-0 all the
way back in 1930.
"This one certainly was embarrassing," head
coach Buddy Teevens said.
There were few positive words spoken by Stan
ford after the game, and understandably so. After
playing 30 minutes of inspired defense against the
Pacific-10 Conference's top-ranked offense, the
Cardinal self-destructed in the second half, allow

ing four touchdowns and committing several bla
tantly intentional personal fouls. Meanwhile, the
Stanford offense managed just 180 yards of of
fense in 58 plays against the Pac-10's second
ranked defense.
Despite Saturday's loss — which, it should he
remembered, did come at the hands of one of the
nation's best teams — it's clear that Stanford is a
better team this year than last. But it will nonethe
less finish with the same record (4-7,2-6 Pac-10) as
that squad.
"I guess to everyone else, we are the same
team (as last year]," receiver Evan Moore said.
"The way things were going at the end is just dis
gusting. Four-and-seven is not gonna cut it, es
pecially at a university like this that can get the
very best athletes."
Cal (9-1, 7-1), of course, is most certainly not
the same team it was last year. Barrin" n cata
strophic upset at the hands of Southern Miss, the
Golden Bears are a lock for the Rose Bowl —
which sent three officials to watch Big Game —
and could still move up to the national champi
onship game if two of Oklahoma, Auburn and
Southern California should falter.

T.J. Rushing and the Cardinal couldn't keep up with the Golden Bears' offense on Saturday,
suffering the worst Big Game loss since 1 930. The Cardinal close out the season at 4-7.
