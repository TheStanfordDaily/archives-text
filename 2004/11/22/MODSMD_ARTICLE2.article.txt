## Players lose their cool as Cal dominates, 41-6 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal rolled into Berkeley Saturday
seeking a tremendous upset. But they never found
the end zone and lost their composure in the sec
ond half.
By the time the dust settled on the overcast,
windy afternoon matchup. No. 4 California stood
on the strong side of a 41-6 score.
Stanford ended the season with its fifth consec
utive loss, while the Bears earned their fifth
straight victory. It was by far the Cardinal's worst
loss of the season — as well as their worst Big
Game loss since they were defeated 41-0 all the
way back in 1930.
"This one certainly was embarrassing," head
coach Buddy Teevens said.
There were few positive words spoken by Stan
ford after the game, and understandably so. After
playing 30 minutes of inspired defense against the
Pacific-10 Conference's top-ranked offense, the
Cardinal self-destructed in the second half, allow

ing four touchdowns and committing several bla
tantly intentional personal fouls. Meanwhile, the
Stanford offense managed just 180 yards of of
fense in 58 plays against the Pac-10's second
ranked defense.
Despite Saturday's loss — which, it should he
remembered, did come at the hands of one of the
nation's best teams — it's clear that Stanford is a
better team this year than last. But it will nonethe
less finish with the same record (4-7,2-6 Pac-10) as
that squad.
"I guess to everyone else, we are the same
team (as last year]," receiver Evan Moore said.
"The way things were going at the end is just dis
gusting. Four-and-seven is not gonna cut it, es
pecially at a university like this that can get the
very best athletes."
Cal (9-1, 7-1), of course, is most certainly not
the same team it was last year. Barrin" n cata
strophic upset at the hands of Southern Miss, the
Golden Bears are a lock for the Rose Bowl —
which sent three officials to watch Big Game —
and could still move up to the national champi
onship game if two of Oklahoma, Auburn and
Southern California should falter.

T.J. Rushing and the Cardinal couldn't keep up with the Golden Bears' offense on Saturday,
suffering the worst Big Game loss since 1 930. The Cardinal close out the season at 4-7.
-ing for 120 yards and a touch
down, but Pac-10 rushing leader
J.J. Arrington ran 27 times for 169
yards and a touchdown, Mar
shawn lynch had 122 yards on
just nine carries plus a trick-play
touchdown pass, and Geoff
Mac Arthur had a game-high live
catches for 47 yards.
"Arrington and I.ynch are very,
very talented players and Rodgers
plays well within the system,"
I'eevcns said. " They're smart with
the football, they're balanced,
they're consistent, they play well as
a group."
Arrington broke Chuck
Muncie's single-season rushing
record of 1,460 yards, Geoff
Mac Arthur broke Dameane Dou
glas' career record of 195 recep
tions and C "al set a school record for
average attendance while going un
beaten at Memorial Stadium for
the first time since 1950. Arrington
also extended his school-record
streak of 10 consecutive 100-yard
games.
While ( al was shattering age
old records, Stanford was strug
gling against familiar problems.
I hc Cardinal gained just 24
yards on 30 carries, including
minus-10 yards on 12 second-half
rushes. The predictable passing
game (another deep out, anyone?)
failed to fool Cal's defenders, who
deflected 10 of the 26 passes I.('
()strander threw.
()strander, starting again for the
injured Trent 1 dwards, connected
on X-of-26 throws for I4S yards,
while taking six sacks. No receiver
had more than two catches.
"They brought a variety of
blii/cs, it was plenty loud out there,
it was hard to communicate and

they were mixing up their cover
ages," Ostrander said. "|But| we
did not exeeute as well as we should
have."
It was a sloppy game all around,
and the Pac-1() officiating erew
didn't help matters. In total, Stan
ford was penalized 14 times lor 126
yards, while Cal was flagged 12
times for 102 yards.
"The refs were being overly sen
sitive," said linebacker David
Bergeron, one of 11 seniors who
played his final game for Stanford.
" lliey started calling stuff that hap
pens in every Pac-10 game every
weekend for 15-yard Hags."
Penalties hurt the Cardinal on
( al's first drive of the second half.
Holding just a 10-3 lead, Cal drove
71 yards fora field goal, 30 yards of
which came thanks to Stanford per
sonal fouls.
"We're far more disciplined
than those |penalties| showed,"
Teevens said. "Amotions certainly
took over on both sides of the game
with the personal fouls."
Stanford's next drive stalled on
its own 42-yard line, and Cal re
sponded quickly, as Lynch slipped
a tackle in the backfield, cut up the
left sideline, slipped another tackle
and won a footrace to the right cor
ner of the end /one to put Cal up
20-3 late in the third quarter.
The Cardinal came back with a
10-play, 52-yard drive ending in a
44-yard Michael Sgroi field goal,
his seeond in two tries. But Cal
would need only seven rushes (and
nary a pass play) to go <X7 yards and
take a 27-6 lead with 12:53 remain
ing in the final period.
"They started running the /one
play and cutting it back to a gap we
didn't have covered," Bergeron

Rose Bowl near
guarantee for Cal

said. "Schematically, they did a
great job."
I.ater in the fourth, Reggie
Robertson had a five-yard touch
down run and Burt Toler caught
I.ynch's 20-yard pass for the final
Cal score.
Cal scored first in the game, as
I'im Mixon returned a punt 51
yards and Rodgers connected with
Robert Jordan on a 29-yard touch
down 6:45 into the game. Tom
Schneider and Sgroi traded field
goals to complete the first-half
scoring.
With the season over, Teevens
now must turn his efforts toward
recruiting, while Athletic Director
led I.eland will review the perfor
mance of the team and its coaches,
as he does after each sport's season
concludes.
Alston endorsed Teevens, say
ing that "Coach Teevens has been
nothing but great to me. He's one
of the nicest people I've ever met.
I'd like to see him back, but I know
that's not my place to comment."
Said Teevens, signed through
2006: "I'm under contract. I expect
to |and| I want to [be retained|."
Tor everyone involved, though,
it was a painful end to what seemed
such a promising season when the
Cardinal was 4-2 overall and 2-1 in
Conference following a win at
Washington State. But, after a se
ries of narrow, frustrating losses,
the year came to an end in Berke
ley with a blowout.
"People wanna act like, oh, it's
okay, you guys were a little bit clos
er this year, but that's not a winning
attitude," Moore said. "I hope
that's not a consolation to every
one that we were close, because
that's not good enough."
