## Men earn overtime win over USF 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
OAKLAND, Calif. â€” For parts of Friday
night's dramatic regular-season men's bas
ketball opener, Stanford played more like a
team running through a dress rehearsal
than one making its grand debut.
But when the curtain finally fell on the
opening performance of the Trent Johnson
era, the Cardinal retreated to their dressing
room with a 93-83 overtime victory over
USF in the second game of the Pete Newell
Challenge at The Arena in Oakland.
Stanford outscored USF 17-7 in the
extra period to give Johnson a win in his
Cardinal head coaching debut while spoil
ing head coach Jessie Evans' opener with
the Dons.
Junior point guard Chris Hernandez,
who scored nine of his career-high 30 points
in overtime, was 17-for-18 from the free
throw line and stripped USF's Jason Gaines
as he drove into the lane fora potential
game-winning shot at the end of regulation.
The Dons had a final chance to win in
regulation after a Stanford turnover on the
ensuing inbounds play, but John Cox's shot
from the left corner hit the side of the back

board as time expired.
With the game tied 11 seconds earlier,
Stanford put the ball in Hernandez's hands
for what it figured would be the final pos
session in regulation. But Hernandez, who
was critical of his performance afterward,
stepped on the sideline on the right wing for
one of his seven turnovers.
"1 don't know, I think we should have
had someone else bring the ball up this
game," said Hernandez, whose three-point
er 30 seconds into overtime gave the Cardi
nal a lead they would not relinquish. "I
played a horrible game."
Hernandez admitted feeling better con
ditioning-wise than he did in the exhibition
game a week prior, after missing the first
part of preseason practice due to a sprained
ankle. Still, it could be some time before he
returns to last season's form.
"I still have a lot of rust to get out of my
game," Hernandez said. "I'm playing like a
rookie right now."
Stanford finished with 20 turnovers and
gave up 17 offensive rebounds. As a result,
the Dons attempted 25 more shots than the
Cardinal, which helped offset their tepid
