## Men earn overtime win over USF 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
OAKLAND, Calif. — For parts of Friday
night's dramatic regular-season men's bas
ketball opener, Stanford played more like a
team running through a dress rehearsal
than one making its grand debut.
But when the curtain finally fell on the
opening performance of the Trent Johnson
era, the Cardinal retreated to their dressing
room with a 93-83 overtime victory over
USF in the second game of the Pete Newell
Challenge at The Arena in Oakland.
Stanford outscored USF 17-7 in the
extra period to give Johnson a win in his
Cardinal head coaching debut while spoil
ing head coach Jessie Evans' opener with
the Dons.
Junior point guard Chris Hernandez,
who scored nine of his career-high 30 points
in overtime, was 17-for-18 from the free
throw line and stripped USF's Jason Gaines
as he drove into the lane fora potential
game-winning shot at the end of regulation.
The Dons had a final chance to win in
regulation after a Stanford turnover on the
ensuing inbounds play, but John Cox's shot
from the left corner hit the side of the back

board as time expired.
With the game tied 11 seconds earlier,
Stanford put the ball in Hernandez's hands
for what it figured would be the final pos
session in regulation. But Hernandez, who
was critical of his performance afterward,
stepped on the sideline on the right wing for
one of his seven turnovers.
"1 don't know, I think we should have
had someone else bring the ball up this
game," said Hernandez, whose three-point
er 30 seconds into overtime gave the Cardi
nal a lead they would not relinquish. "I
played a horrible game."
Hernandez admitted feeling better con
ditioning-wise than he did in the exhibition
game a week prior, after missing the first
part of preseason practice due to a sprained
ankle. Still, it could be some time before he
returns to last season's form.
"I still have a lot of rust to get out of my
game," Hernandez said. "I'm playing like a
rookie right now."
Stanford finished with 20 turnovers and
gave up 17 offensive rebounds. As a result,
the Dons attempted 25 more shots than the
Cardinal, which helped offset their tepid

34.6 percent field-goal percentage.
USF actually shot better from
three-point range (36.4 percent)
than they did inside the arc.
While turnovers and second
chance opportunities kept the
Dons within striking distance
(Stanford's largest lead was 10
points), it took a gutsy perfor
mance from Cox to force overtime.
The senior all-conference guard
launched his fair share of ill-ad
vised three-pointers (he was 6-for
-16 from long range), but after two
Hernandez free throws put the
Cardinal ahead by seven with 2:19
to play, he drained three three
pointers and scored USF's next 11
points to pull the Dons to within
one.
After another pair of Stanford
free throws, Tyrone Riley sank
three free throws after he was
fouled outside the arc to tie the
game with 11 seconds to play.
Cox finished with 33 points, in
cluding six three-pointers, while
Riley scored 21 points and grabbed
10 rebounds.
"They were a lot more aggres
sive than we were," Johnson said.
"But we found a way to win. A lot
of these guys are stepping into new
roles, and that's going to take some
time."
Junior Dan Grunfeld appeared
comfortable in his new role as
starting shooting guard, with the
man he replaced, Matt Lottich, in
attendance along with former
Stanford and current Golden State
Warriors head coach Mike Mont
gomery.
Picking up right where he left
off after scoring 22 points in an ex
hibition victory against Concordia,
Grunfeld scored 15 first-half points
— including 10 straight during one
stretch — and finished with a ca
reer-high 23 points. Once again, he
did the majority of his damage
around the basket, and also added
11 rebounds.
"I 'm just trying to play my game
and be aggressive," said Grunfeld.

Junior forward Matt Haryasz

baseline jumper to extend Stan
ford's lead to six and all but seal the
game with 45 seconds to go in over
time. He also had 11 rebounds.
As he did in the exhibition
game, Johnson used several differ

and moved Hernandez to shooting
guard with Haas in the game.

Senior Nick Robinson struggled
mightily from the field (1 -for-10)
