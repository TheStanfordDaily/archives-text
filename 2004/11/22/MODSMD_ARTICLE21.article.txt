# Cardinal women pick up opener against Utah
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
So much for those first-game freshman
jitters then, huh?
On Friday, freshman guard Candice
Wiggins scored a career-high 24 points to
lead the No. 7 Cardinal to a come-from-be
hind 63-57 victory over a feisty Utah team
in their season opener at the Huntsman
Center in Salt Lake City, Utah.
"Candice did a great job tonight," head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We have a
few injured players who we are hoping to
get back soon, and we are looking forward
to putting them back in the lineup."
For the third consecutive game, the Car
dinal was forced to play without one of its
key players, senior Susan King Borchardt,
who has been sidelined with a stress reac
tion in her left foot.
However, for the third consecutive
game, Wiggins filled in admirably, starting
alongside senior Kelley Suminski and lead
ing Stanford to its fourth consecutive victo

ry in a season opener.
The Utes also came out ready to play
against what may be their toughest oppo
nent of the season. Utah held a lead with
eight minutes remaining in the game, and
almost came away with an early-season
upset.
"We came in, and we were prepared
tonight," said Utah head coach Elaine El
liott. "We had the chances to beat this
team, but we just couldn't put it together."
Kim Smith, Utah's dynamic junior for
ward, led the team with 15 points and nine
rebounds, demonstrating the skills that
made her the best player in the Mountain
West Conference last year.
"We wanted this game, and I think we
showed that we can be a top-10 team,"
Smith said. "We hung with them the entire
game, and I think that shows something
about our program."
Initially, Stanford looked like it might
run away from Utah, riding a 6-0 run to a
Stanford regains
momentum late

2K-1 1 ) lead with 4:41 remaining in the first half. Then, the
river ran dry for the Cardinal.
Stanford went scoreless for the remainder of the half.
The team's halftime meeting changed little. The Cardi
nal's struggles continued until Wiggins finally ended the
scoreless streak with a pair of free throws at the 15:22
mark.
All in all. Stanford went 9:19 without a point, watch
ing a 17-0 run by Utah that handed all the momentum to
the home squad.
However, that "No. 7" next to Stanford's name is
there fora reason.
After Wiggins' free throws cut the deficit to six
points, the Cardinal slowly battled back on the
strength of solid defense and excellent play off the
bench from senior Azella Ferryman and junior
Brooke Smith.
"I think our pressure really turned it around for us.
We were down six or eight and that brought back the
momentum. We had been working hard on our pressure,
and it really worked out for us."
Both Ferryman and Smith gave VanDerveer more
than 20 minutes on the floor, making key contributions
during the stretch run.
Ferryman pulled down a team-leading six boards,
while collecting eight points. Smith, meanwhile, was a
perfect five-for-five from the field with 11 points and
added a block.
As the game wound down, Stanford's depth was too
much to handle. Seven players saw more than 10 minutes
of playing time for the Cardinal, and the Stanford bench
outscored the Utes', 24-7.
"We did a nice job most of the game, but that last six
minutes, their post game really played well," Elliott said.
"Our young players got tired and weren't able to with
stand their momentum."
