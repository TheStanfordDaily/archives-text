# Big Splash ends in upset loss
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR STAFF WRITER 
With less than three minutes left in the
game, the Cardinal found themselves in a
position that they had only stood in twice
this season: they found themselves facing
an upset. And they were on the wrong side
of it.
California's fourth-ranked men's water
polo team defeated No. 2 Stanford (19-4,7-
2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) by a
narrow margin, 6-5, in Saturday's Big
Splash. The one-goal victory gave the
Bears (19-8, 4-5 MPSF) one final win for
their regular season and handed Stanford
its second conference loss of the season.
"We made some key physical errors
that aren't exactly typical of our team,"
said junior driver Peter Varellas. "We ac
tually played some great defense, but
couldn't quite put it together on the offen
sive end."
Every time the Cardinal closed in on the
Bears, Cal would respond quickly and pull
away. Sophomore drivers Andre Vasiljevic
and Brian Bacharach led the way for Cal
with two goals apiece, but it was
Bacharach's final goal in the fourth period
that won the game for the Bears.
Vasiljevic's goal with 2:23 left in the
match put the Bears up 6-4. The Cardinal
made one last threat when junior driver
Thomas Hopkins' shot into the cage a few
minutes later made the match an exciting
6-5 back-and-forth battle. But missed and
blocked shots on Stanford's part prevented
Stanford from getting any closer to a win.
The first period also played a vital part
in the Cardinal's loss. Having proven itself
to be a first period juggernaut, outscoring
opponents 85-30 in the first seven minutes
of the game this season, Stanford was sur
prisingly out of rhythm Saturday morning.
In front of a sold-out Berkeley crowd, the
Cardinal could only score once in the first.
After senior driver Tony Azevedo
opened the game with his first goal,
Bacharach, Vasiljevic and center defender
Marty Matthies all scored to give Cal a 3-1
lead as it entered the second period.
Azevedo scored again in the second, but
the Bears kept doing just enough on de
fense to hold a powerful Cardinal offense
at bay.
Cal goalkeeper Nate Bennett, whom
Stanford has said and shown it could man
age well against, recorded 12 saves on the

game. The loss was a surprise for Stanford:
The Cardinal beat the young Cal squad
twice this season — including 12-7 last
week — and saw a lot of glaring mistakes
in the Bears' play, citing that the Cal squad
didn't have the offensive weapons to
counter the Cardinal defense and noting
that Cal's defense seemed to have the
wrong matchups.
Cal, however, came into Big Splash
after making some adjustments on its
counterattack and six-on-five offense. Ac
cording to Cal coach Kirk Everist, the ad
justments helped balance the frontcourt
offense and made the Bears more defen
sive.
Stanford did make a strong attempt to
come back in the third period. After ending

the half 4-2, the Cardinal made things close
with goals from Varellas and Azevedo.
After Azevedo tied the match 4-4 with 2:04
left in the period, though, Bacharach's shot
skipped into the goal to give the Bears the
lead once and for all.
As two of the top three scorers for Cal,
Bacharach and Vasiljevic were on the Car
dinal radar prior to Saturday's tilt, as were
Matthies and Brian Kinsel, who scored in
the second. But the only other top Cal play
er Stanford was able to dominate was John
Mann, the Bears' leading scorer.
With its win Cal received the Steve He
ston Trophy, which goes to the winner of
Big Splash, for the fourth time in the tro
phy's six-year history.
Stanford's onlv other MPSF loss this

year was against No. 1 UCLA.
Stanford was looking at the game as a
good tune-up before the MFSF tourna
ment starts on Friday. Despite ending its
regular season with an impressive record,
Saturday's upset showed the team might
have a few things left to work out before
conference playoffs begin. But the Cardi
nal were short and to the point on what
they have to do.
"In the context of the season, we can
only look ahead now," Varellas said. "Win
three games, go to NCAAs, period. That's
the goal, and that's our path to get there.
Yes, we learn from mistakes, but we now
have to focus our effort on the upcoming
week and tournament."
