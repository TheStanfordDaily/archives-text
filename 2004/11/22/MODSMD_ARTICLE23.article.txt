# Fade into Bolivian
## Ron Artest will get plenty of time off now 
### 
By now, everyone's seen the brouhaha,
he it live or via Sports Center. Luckily I
watched the action live, since I tend to
be at home on Friday nights watching regular
season Indiana vs. Detroit NBA games.
Words have been written, press confer
ences have been held, suspensions have been

dealt and lawsuits will soon
be filed.
Speaking of lawsuits, the
dude who came onto the
court and got punked by Jer
maine O'Neal should have
absolutely no case to file
charges against Jermaine.
The key point here is if you
enter the field of play, you
deserve anything coming to

you.
Yet people are still missing key points of
the situation. Allow me to rectify their errors,
and in doing so, it's time to play the blame
game.
First off, this is by no means a historic, gen
eration-changing event. Leave it to ESPN to
put the hype in hyperbole and ponder whether
or not "The Culture of Sports has Changed
Forever." This is an absolutely ridiculous
statement that suggests that an event that only
led to one hospitalization and the major sus
pension of four players somehow has changed
sports permanently.
1 can only imagine European soccer (err,
football) hooligans ridiculing American
sports fans for not instigating further violence.
Detroit: if you're going to try to incite a riot,
please choose a different person to initiate the
violence and not rely on nerdy, Poindexter
esque white boys to lead the cavalry. That's
like replacing Sir William Wallace with Elton
John; I'm guessing it might not have the same
impact.
But, questions do need to be asked —
questions such as: Who throws $12 beers?
Who throws $8 buckets of popcorn? Who
wastes $10 sodas? Trust me, I understand the
desire to throw objects at players; back during
the Candlestick days, San Francisco Giants
fans used to love chucking batteries at oppos-


N*il Davis
ing players. At least New York fans
were clever enough to throw bat
teries and other objects in the form
of snowballs. By throwing expen
sive food products instead of bat
teries, quarters, and other metal
objects, lower-level Detroit fans
showed their sports elitism.
Essentially, you have the insti
gator (dude with the blue cup), and
escalators (Artest and Jackson,
who both entered the crowd look
ing for mayhem). I guess what I
don't really understand is why. with
45 seconds remaining in the game,
the fan was a) sober enough to tar
get and actually hit Artest and
b)had a full cupof $12 beer remain
ing. This really goes back to my last
point: if you're going to drop exces
sive sums of money on overpriced
food and beverages, please do not
throw them at players.
Also, allow me to point to the
poor play of the Detroit Pistons as
one of the main causes of this event.
The impetus for this idea is Ga
metime Smitson's (yes, the same
Gametime) "old and rich buffer"
theory. The theory works likes this:
rich octogenarians sit courtside
and, pending close scores at the end
of a game, will generally stay in
their seats and not leave early.

However, in Friday's game, with
little time remaining and Indiana
up big. these fans had left the build
ing. and the buffer between the
players and people who throw ob
jects had been eliminated. Enter
Artest laying on the scorer's table,
and the not-drunk-enough-dude
lobbing a beer at a supine Artest.
With the "old and rich buffer"
gone, there was absolutely nothing
to either stop the blue-cup guy
from throwing his beer and, more
importantly, prevent Artest from
entering the crowd. I know Artest
is loco at times, but I don't think
he'd trample over some 75-year
old grandmother in order to bring
da ruckus.
From a rational standpoint, the
easiest solution to situations such as
these is twofold: the raising of food
prices while not allowing outside
food into the stadium, and close re
view of the tape in order to revoke
the season tickets of fans who
threw items at the players.
Ideally, 1 would so overprice
food at games that nobody, not
even fans sitting courtside, would
be able to purchase food. If you're
not going to eat it, you can't buy it.
Bottom line.
In conclusion, people are way

Fans, not players,
primarily to blame

too focused on the negatives in
this situation. Allow me to point
out the positives—Ron Artest
gets ample time to promote his
R&B album. We no longer need
to hear about the poor shooting in
the NBA, as the league will now
be known as the National
Brawlers Association. Also, we
are no longer subjected to the Ter
rell Owens Monday Night Foot
ball controversy, which received
far too much media attention.
Come Christmas Day, look for
another heaping of brotherly love,
as the Pacers once again match up
against Detroit.
Shaq-Fu might star in excellent
video games and claim to be am
phibious, but his prediction that his
match-up against Kobe would draw
the highest ratings in the history of
an NBA regular season game
shows that his attempt to emulate
Nostradamus has succeeded:
they're both wrong. A lot.

After this incident, Neil is definitely
going to buy Ron Art est's R&H
album. With his newfound free time
A rtest is going to promote this album
ad nauseam. E-mail Neil at
neild@stanford.edu to tell him when
this album drops.
