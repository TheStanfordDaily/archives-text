By now, everyone's seen the brouhaha,
he it live or via Sports Center. Luckily I
watched the action live, since I tend to
be at home on Friday nights watching regular
season Indiana vs. Detroit NBA games.
Words have been written, press confer
ences have been held, suspensions have been

dealt and lawsuits will soon
be filed.
Speaking of lawsuits, the
dude who came onto the
court and got punked by Jer

absolutely no case to file

The key point here is if you
enter the field of play, you

Yet people are still missing key points of
the situation. Allow me to rectify their errors,
and in doing so, it's time to play the blame
game.
First off, this is by no means a historic, gen

put the hype in hyperbole and ponder whether
or not "The Culture of Sports has Changed
Forever." This is an absolutely ridiculous
statement that suggests that an event that only
led to one hospitalization and the major sus

sports permanently.

football) hooligans ridiculing American
sports fans for not instigating further violence.
Detroit: if you're going to try to incite a riot,
please choose a different person to initiate the
violence and not rely on nerdy, Poindexter
esque white boys to lead the cavalry. That's
like replacing Sir William Wallace with Elton
John; I'm guessing it might not have the same
impact.
But, questions do need to be asked â€”
questions such as: Who throws $12 beers?
Who throws $8 buckets of popcorn? Who
wastes $10 sodas? Trust me, I understand the
desire to throw objects at players; back during
the Candlestick days, San Francisco Giants
fans used to love chucking batteries at oppos-
