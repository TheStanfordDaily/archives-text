# Stanford runners prepare for Nationals
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
This is what it all comes down to. The ath
letes. The coaches. The training. The meets. Ev
erything finally comes together at the end of the
season in the NCAA Division 1 National C ham
pionships.
The top-ranked women's cross-country team
and the No. 3 men's squad will compete today at
the LaVern Gibson Championship Course in
Terre Haute, IN. The women will race first
today in the 6,000 meter competition, and the
men's 10.000 meter race will follow.
Both teams are defending champions â€” the
men placed first last year and in 2002. The
women have had top-three finishes, including
two titles, in seven of the last eight years, and the
men have run away with four victories in the
same amount of time.
In addition to placing four C ardinal runners
in the top ten. the men made history several
times during last year's win at the C hampi
onships. The men's score of 24 points was the
second lowest in history to UTEP s 17 points in
1981. Stanford also managed to place 150 points

between itself and second-place finisher Wis
consin. The margin of victory was the largest in
NCAA Division I history and greater than the
122-point victory Arkansas had over BYU in
1993.
While the temperatures dropped to as low at
18 degrees last year, the weather looks to be a bit
milder this year.
"The course is kind of wet but it shouldn't be
remarkably cold," head women's coach Dena
Evans said. "The signs do indicate that it should
be fairly mellow weather, and so that's probably
great for the race. We're looking forward to
that."
The women collected all of the first-place
votes in the most recent Finish Lynx poll to claim
the top spot over Providence, Colorado, Michi
gan, and Duke, respectively. The team has had a
strong season, winning all six of the meets it has
competed in in 2(X)4. including most recently the
win at West Regionals.
While the men have recently slipped to No. 3
behind Wisconsin and Arkansas in the most re
cent Mondo Men's NCAA Division I poll, their
chances look promising as well today. The
team's most notable victories this year include

NCAA West Regionals, Pac-lOs and Pre-Na
tionals, which were also held in Terre Haute.
Men's head coach Andy Gerard puts little
stock in the rankings.
"It doesn't really make any difference," he
said, "nor does it have any hearing on the race.
We're still going to go out and do what we are
prepared to do."
Similarly, the women's team feels that the top
ranking that it has held the whole season will not
affect its performance in the final meet.
"Many runners have run in this meet before
and we haven't paid much attention [to the rank
ings]," Evans said. "It's a question of really run
ning well, and if we do that, then we'll be happy
with the result regardless of the place we get."
Not only did Stanford claim team victories
last week in Fresno at West Regionals, but the
teams also both walked away with individual
first-place finishes from seniors Alicia Craig and
Ryan Hall. Craig and Hall look to make waves
again today as they are among a number of run
ners who have previously competed in the final
meet of the season.
In 2003. Hall was the NCAA runner-up,
