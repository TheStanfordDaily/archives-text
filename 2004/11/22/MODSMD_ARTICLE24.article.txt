# Stanford runners prepare for Nationals
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
This is what it all comes down to. The ath
letes. The coaches. The training. The meets. Ev
erything finally comes together at the end of the
season in the NCAA Division 1 National C ham
pionships.
The top-ranked women's cross-country team
and the No. 3 men's squad will compete today at
the LaVern Gibson Championship Course in
Terre Haute, IN. The women will race first
today in the 6,000 meter competition, and the
men's 10.000 meter race will follow.
Both teams are defending champions â€” the
men placed first last year and in 2002. The
women have had top-three finishes, including
two titles, in seven of the last eight years, and the
men have run away with four victories in the
same amount of time.
In addition to placing four C ardinal runners
in the top ten. the men made history several
times during last year's win at the C hampi
onships. The men's score of 24 points was the
second lowest in history to UTEP s 17 points in
1981. Stanford also managed to place 150 points

between itself and second-place finisher Wis
consin. The margin of victory was the largest in
NCAA Division I history and greater than the
122-point victory Arkansas had over BYU in
1993.
While the temperatures dropped to as low at
18 degrees last year, the weather looks to be a bit
milder this year.
"The course is kind of wet but it shouldn't be
remarkably cold," head women's coach Dena
Evans said. "The signs do indicate that it should
be fairly mellow weather, and so that's probably
great for the race. We're looking forward to
that."
The women collected all of the first-place
votes in the most recent Finish Lynx poll to claim
the top spot over Providence, Colorado, Michi
gan, and Duke, respectively. The team has had a
strong season, winning all six of the meets it has
competed in in 2(X)4. including most recently the
win at West Regionals.
While the men have recently slipped to No. 3
behind Wisconsin and Arkansas in the most re
cent Mondo Men's NCAA Division I poll, their
chances look promising as well today. The
team's most notable victories this year include

NCAA West Regionals, Pac-lOs and Pre-Na
tionals, which were also held in Terre Haute.
Men's head coach Andy Gerard puts little
stock in the rankings.
"It doesn't really make any difference," he
said, "nor does it have any hearing on the race.
We're still going to go out and do what we are
prepared to do."
Similarly, the women's team feels that the top
ranking that it has held the whole season will not
affect its performance in the final meet.
"Many runners have run in this meet before
and we haven't paid much attention [to the rank
ings]," Evans said. "It's a question of really run
ning well, and if we do that, then we'll be happy
with the result regardless of the place we get."
Not only did Stanford claim team victories
last week in Fresno at West Regionals, but the
teams also both walked away with individual
first-place finishes from seniors Alicia Craig and
Ryan Hall. Craig and Hall look to make waves
again today as they are among a number of run
ners who have previously competed in the final
meet of the season.

narrowly missing the top spot by a
little over a second. In 2004, Hall
has claimed the West Regional and
Pre-National titles along with a sec
ond-place finish at Pac-lOs. He is
the only returning member of last
year's championship team, all
seven of whom were named Ail-
Americans.
Although they were not a part of
last year's dominant NCAA team,
senior David Vidal, juniors Jake
Gomez and Jonathan Pierce and
sophomore Nef Araia have all flour
ished in the 2004 season.
Gomez helped the Cardinal de
feat Arizona State and emerge
victorious at Pac-lOs with his top
ten finish, and he also claimed an
other top-ten finish at Pre-Na
tionals. Araia also competed well
at Pac-lOs and Pre-Nationals, fin
ishing third in the former and fifth

in the latter.
Craig, a three-time All Ameri
can, had an impressive run at
NCAAs in 2003 with her sixth
place finish. The senior has really
sparkled this year, bringing home
her third straight Regional win by
completing the 6k course in 20:03.
She also claimed another win at
Pre-Nationals and a second-place
finish at Pac-lOs.
Other runners who have previ
ously competed at NCAAs include
seniors Sara Bei, Jeane Goff and
Anita Siraki, and sophomores Ari
anna Lambie and Amanda and Katy
Trotter. Bei, Craig, Lambie and
Katy Trotter all received All-Amer
ican honors in 2003.
Bei finished third overall in the
2003 Championships. The senior ran
a conservative race last year until
close to the finish line. Bei has had

two victories this year, including one
at the Notre Dame Invitational.
As long as both teams give their
best possible performances, both
coaches will be satisfied regardless of
the results.
"We always speak about doing
what we're prepared to do, control
ling what we can control, and run
ning the best race that we are capa
ble of on that particular day," Ger
ard said. "If someone beats us and
we can [sayj that we did those things,
then so be it."
"I think that's what you're look
ing for all year, to compete and be
successful," Evans agreed. "It's a
question of getting everybody to
have a good race, and if a couple
people have a great race then
maybe we'll have a really exciting
result."
