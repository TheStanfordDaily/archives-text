# Penalties make for ugly game
## 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was an ugly way to end what
turned out to be an ugly season for
the Stanford ( 'ardinal.
Saturday's 41-6 loss at the hands
of the California Hears officially
closes the book on a season that
started strong for Stanford, but
ended with the same disappointing
4-7 record as a year ago.
This weekend's game was excep
tional not only in the magnitude ol
the loss to the rival Hears, but also in
the general ugliness of the whole af
lair.
Not only did the game feature
Stanford struggling to move the ball,
a trend that has been very visible in
the Cardinal's live straight losses,
but also 26 total penalties on both
teams.
Stanford again failed to pick up
2(H) yards of total offense, with only
IXO total yards, including just 24
yards on the ground.
"Offensively, we didn't have the
ability to control the ball," Stanford
head coach Huddy Teevcns said. "In
the end that was very damaging to
us."
(liven the way the Cardinal of
fense has played the last few weeks
and the strength of the Hears' de
le nse, the o ffe nsi ve trouble s we re ex
pected. l/nlbreseen were the penal
ties and the lack of sportsmanship
displayed by both teams, especially
near the end of the game.
I'he Cardinal were penalized 14
times for 126 yards, while the Hears
were flagged 12 times for 102 yards.
The game was called very tight
ly by the officials throughout the
entire contest, with 11 penalties
coming in the first half, but towards
the end of the game things began to
get rough.
With a little over nine minutes left
to go in the game and ( al leading 27-
6, the Hears ran a halfback pass play,
and backup tailback Marshawn
I.ynch threw a 26-yard strike fora
score to Hurl l'oler.
It was after that point that many
players from both Cal and Stanford
started getting more aggressive.
On the next Stanford possession
the ( ardinal went threc-and-out. ()n
the ensuing punt, Stanford senior
corncrback I cigh lorrence laid a
monstrous hit on punt returner Tim
Mixon before the ball had even
reached the helpless player.
"1 was really disappointed in the
way that went down," junior
linebacker Jon Alston said. "I was
disappointed in the fact that we were
getting personal fouls. 1 was disap
pointed al what they were doing.
That's not what the game is about.
1 hat's not the way to play football."
The frustration was obvious
among Stanford players, many of
whom have never beaten ('al in a Hig
(lame.

"As far as emotions go, they're al
ways high," said redshirt lreshman
quarterback T.C. Ostrander. "l or
this game they're even higher. I don't
think we were too emotional, we just
got frustrated at the end of the
game."
It wasn't only the Cardinal who
were playing dirty at the end of the
game.
Defensive tackle Habatunde
()shinowo was injured on what he
thought was a dirty block by the
Cal offensive line late in the game.
While the Cardinal did pick up a
lot of personal fouls, a good num
ber were offset by personal fouls
on the Hears.
"It was emotional," said Cal
linebacker Joe Maningo. "People
were flying mad. The Big Game is
emotional, what can you say."
Teevcns said, "Amotions certain

ly took over on both sides at the end.
That's not us, and that's not them."
Senior linebacker David Berg
eron saw the cnd-of-the-game antics
in a different way.
"It was a very chippy game,"
Bergeron said. "But it was just guys
having fun. It's a bunch of 22- and 21-
ycar-old guys playing the game that
they love and talking to each other
about it. It really wasn't even any
thing negative. It wasn't even as
much negative sentiment going back
and forth as it was trying to get in
each other's head and getting each
other riled up."
Hither way the 107 th Big Game
did not go the way the Cardinal
would have liked.
Unfortunately for Stanford, they
are going to have to wait until next
season to get back on the winning
track.

Ca! quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw for only 167 yards on Saturday, but
he didn't need a big performance as the Bears' running game crushed Stan
ford, gaining 307 yards to the Cardinal's 24.
