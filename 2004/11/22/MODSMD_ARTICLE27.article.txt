# Volleyball downs Cougars
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It wasn't nearly as exciting as
knocking off previously undefeat
ed, top-ranked Washington the
night before, but the Stanford Car
dinal (21-6, 13-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) still took care of business Fri
day night against conference door
mat Washington State (4-25, 1-15).
Stanford rolled through the
Cougars in straight games, never
letting their opponent score more
than 22 in any frame.
From the onset, the match was
never really in question. The Cardi
nal, although not as crisp as they
had been the night before against
the Huskies, did not need to be.
The Cougars were able to keep

the score competitive through the
first half of game one. but once the
Cardinal eliminated their early er
rors, things were just too much for
Washington State.
Game two was more of the
same, as the Cardinal eased their
way to a 30-22 victory. Stanford
was also able to play with its lineup
a bit, playing sophomore outside
hitter Njideka Nnamani in place of
her older sister, senior outside hit
ter Ogonna Nnamani.
Sophomore middle blocker
Michelle Mellard also received
playing time, as fellow sophomore
middle blocker Lizzie Suiter got a
well-deserved break.
By game three, a pattern had
been clearly set, and there was little
deviation. Washington State did

take an early lead, forcing head
coach John Dunning to take a time
out with Stanford trailing 8-3.
The Cardinal snapped out of it
though, tying the game at 12 and
taking their first lead at 16-15. A
kill from Kristin Richards made the
score 23-17 in favor of Stanford.
As the Cardinal pulled away,
sophomore middle blocker Jen
nifer Wilson and freshman defen
sive specialist Kirsten Hornbeak
saw action, giving time to everyone
on Stanford's roster for the
evening.
Washington State was plainly
outclassed. Stanford reached
match point on a kill by Ogonna
Nnamani. and two points later, sis
ter Njideka Nnamani closed out
the game and match in favor of the
Cardinal, 30-22.
While the match was not as
thrilling as the previous evening,
there was still a buzz, around Burn
ham as Stanford said goodbye to
three stellar seniors playing in their
last Pac-10 home match.
Senior Leahi Hall came to the
Cardinal as a defensive specialist
her freshman year with aspirations
of becoming Stanford's libero.
While Dunning initially thought
Hall would never fill that role, her
hard work and determination won
her the starting position this year.
In addition to being a force on de
fense. Hall developed a nasty serve
capable of providing aces, holding
one of the highest service-aces-per
game averages.
Senior outside hitter Jenn
Hucke has quietly put together
her best season with the Cardi
nal. Hucke averages nearly three
kills, a block and two digs a
game. and. like Hall, has a great
serve. She has five double-dou
bles this year, the most recent
coming last weekend against the
Oregon Ducks.
Finally, senior outsider hitter
Ogonna Nnamani was introduced.
Not only is she the most prolific
killer in Cardinal history. Nnamani
sits just 21 kills short of her own sin
gle-season Stanford record and 22
kills short of the all-time Pac-10 ca
reer lead. The team captain, Nna
mani played with the U.S. national
team in Greece this past summer,
along with former Cardinal stand
out Logan Tom.
Stanford will host No. 23
Santa Clara in its final home
game of the season this Tuesday
at 7 p.m. at Burnham Pavilion.
From there, the Cardinal head to
Arizona and Arizona State this
coming weekend and then to the
NCAA Tournament.
