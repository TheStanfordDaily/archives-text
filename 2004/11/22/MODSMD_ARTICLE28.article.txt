### MIKE DESTASIO THE DAILY WILDCAT (U. OF ARIZONA 
U-WIRE â€” University of Arizona
athletic director Jim Livengood told
the Arizona Board of Regents yes
terday he projects the athletics de
partment to have a surplus of more
than $1 million at the end of the
year.
Athletic directors from the UA,
Arizona State University, and North
ern Arizona University presented re
ports on their financial status as well
as how their student-athletes are far
ing to the regents yesterday.
"Things look pretty good. We've
been able to operate with a positive
fund balance," Livengood said.
"Our expenditures are covered
by our revenues," said UA President
Peter Likins.
The UA athletic budget has fin
ished with a surplus every year for
about two decades.
UA's athletic department even
managed to escape debt last year de
spite firing head football coach John
Mackovic and hiring current head
coach Mike Stoops.
ASU, on the other hand, had a
$400,000 deficit in their athletic de
partment budget during the last fis
cal year, said Gene Smith. ASU ath
letic director.

Smith also said the ASU athletic
budget has a continuing deficit of
$1.6 million.
To help cut athletic expenditures,
the UA athletic department has cut
about 15 full-time positions, accord
ing to the Arizona Daily Star.
Livengood told the Arizona
Daily Star those employees were not
necessarily laid off and some were
positions that remained unfilled
after employees left the UA.
Athletic director Jim Livengood
also reported the UA has been suc
cessful in graduating its student
athletes.
The graduation rate is on the rise,
increasing from 60 percent last year.
"This past year our graduation
rate has risen to 65 percent," Liven
good said.
That mark is 10 percent higher
than the average for all students at
tending the UA.
Student-athletes in 12 of 19
sports had a 2.75 or better cumula
tive grade point average last year,
Livengood said.
Last year student athletes had an
overall GPA of 2.8. The average UA
student GPA was 2.86.
In comparison. ASU student ath
letes maintained an overall GPA of
2.85 last year, but only had a 58 per
cent six-year graduation rate.
One of the reuents voiced con

cern over the zero percent six-year
graduation rate for the UA men's
basketball freshman class who en
rolled in the 1997-98 school year.
The zero percent rate indicates that
of those players who began six years
ago, none of the players graduated
from the UA within six years.
Livengood attributed this per
centage to many players departing
early for the NBA. Likins added that
players transferring away from the
UA count against graduation rates -
even if those players leave in good
academic standing.
In recent years, the UA men's
basketball team has seen the de
parture of Dennis Latimore. who
transferred to Notre Dame a year
ago, and Will Bynum, who trans
ferred to Georgia Tech midway
through the 2002-03 season. Both
left in good academic standing,
Likins said.
Livengood reported UA stu
dent athletes also give back to the
community.
Last year, they donated 1,875
hours of service to 22.000 communi
ty members. Livengood said. 339. or
79 percent, of UA student athletes
participated.
By comparison. ASU student
athletes have completed 1,300 hours
of community service over the past
year.
