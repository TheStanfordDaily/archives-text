# File sharing integrated with Thefacebook.com
## 
### JENNY ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Wirehog, a file-sharing computer application
that is integrated with Thefacebook.com. was re
leased to Stanford users last week. The program
allows users to share and transfer documents,
movies and music over the Internet. But some are
concerned about copyright infringement when
using this service.
It was initially released to Harvard and Stan
ford to test how the network would scale once in
troduced to other universities.
Mark Zuckerberg. the founder of Theface
book.com and one of the Wirehog's three devel

opers, said that the feedback he has received
about the program has been overwhelmingly pos
itive.
"The reactions we've received range from 'this
is the coolest program ever' to 'what do I do with
this?'" Zuckerberg said in an interview with The
Daily.
Some students have been unclear about how
to use the application because of its innovation.
Zuckerberg said.
"We really made something original, which was
our goal," he said. "For the next release of Wire
hog to other schools, we've cleaned up many as
pects of the program that people weren't used to
in order to make them easier to navigate."

Zuckerberg and others view Wirehog as hav
ing the potential to improve student life.
"An important aspect of communication is
sharing information, and with Wirehog, transfer
ring files between friends will be much easier than
it is today," Zuckerberg said. "I also think Wire
hog will enable friends to share parts of their lives
through pictures, videos, and other media, which
hopefully will make computer use a richer social
experience."
"Sharing files with friends isn't an entirely new
concept, since things like Ofoto.com and iTunes
have been trying to do that for quite some time
now," said junior Julie Zhuo, the co-president of
Women In Computer Science.
"Thefacebook integration is pretty cool. I think
that this integration will probably be a big selling
point for people interested in downloading Wire
hog."
Despite concerns about the likelihood that
students will use the new program to share copy
righted materials, Zuckerberg said that recent
court cases involving the Morpheus and Grokster
file-sharing services indicate that Wirehog is
legal.
"I think the concern from the RIAA [Record
ing Industry Association of America] and MPAA
|Motion Picture Association of America] is over
individuals using Wirehog to distribute songs and
movies to which they don't own the copyrights,"
he said.
"However, Wirehog is designed to facilitate
transfers of socially relevant media, like photos,
home videos, music by local artists who tend to
want their music distributed freely on the Inter
net, and documents, so I doubt the RIAA or
MPAA will have a problem with that."
Fred von Lohmann, Stanford alumnus and se
nior intellectual property attorney for the Elec
tronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-profit
group dedicated to protecting "digital civil liber
ties," said that students should be cautious about
copyright infringement when using Wirehog to
transfer music and movie files.
"The entertainment industries have begun fil
ing thousands of lawsuits against people that they
catch uploading their music and movies on public
P2P networks like Kazaa and eDonkey," he said.
"Obviously, you are less likely to get caught if you
only share with friends using software like Wire
hog, but there is no guarantee that investigators
might not start trying to infiltrate large semi-pub
lic networks, including those that might be created
using Wirehog and social networks like the The
facebook."
Von Lohmann said that Wirehog can and
should be utilized for many legal uses, such as
sharing non-infringing files available on the Inter
net Archive collection of over 17,(XX) live concert
recordings from more than 7(X) bands.
"As with many other things, students who are
interested in file sharing should get educated
about the issue — what the law says, what copy
right owners are doing about it.and exactly how to
configure and use the various software applica
tions," von Lohmann said.
Von Lohmann added that on his group's Web
site, students can get information to help them un-

derstand "their
rights and re
sponsibilities
online ... (and)
the important
policy issues at
the intersection
of copyright,
free expression,
and new digital
technologies.
After all, copy
right laws get
made by the
people we all
just sent back to
Congress. If you
don't like the
way the laws are
working, let
them know
about it."
As a matter
of policy, the
111 forma t ion
Technology
Systems and
Services (ITSS)
department at
Stanford does
not comment
on particular
systems.

"If members
of the Stanford community are considering using
a particular method, they should ensure that in
doing so they comply with Stanford's computer
policies and all applicable laws," said Nancy
Ware, director of business planning and commu
nication at ITSS.
" They should also ensure that they do not create
a risk of harm to their computers or of exposure of
private information about themselves or others."
Wirehog was developed by three college stu
dents — Mark Zuckerberg and Andrew McCol
lum of Harvard and Adam D'Angelo of Caltech
— during the summer and fall of 20()4. Zucker
berg and McCollum have taken time off of school
this year to work in Palo Alto, Calif.
According to Zuckerberg, Thefacebook cur
rently has over 840,000 members, with an antici
pated one million users by year end, and Wirehog
has thousands of users to date.
Zuckerberg hopes to never include advertising
on Wirehog.

"The project will need money to run, but I
think we'll be able to come up with something
more creative and less annoying than advertising
to keep ourselves afloat," he said.
Only time will tell whether Thefacebook users
at Stanford and universities nationwide go wild
over Wirehog.
"Since Wirehog hasn't been released at USC
yet, I haven't gotten a chance to use it," said com
puter science and engineering senior Scott
Callaghan at the University of Southern Califor
nia. "But most of the files 1 get from my friends we
just send over AIM, so I don't think that's likely to
change. Besides, opening up your computer to
sharing does increase security risks."
The Wirehog software, once downloaded
onto a computer, allows you to choose which
files to make available via the Internet. Because
Wirehog is integrated with Thefacebook.com,
you can access friends' Wirehogs from their
profiles and the Wirehog connects you to your
friend's computer.

"Since Wirehog hasn't been released at USC
yet, I haven't gotten a chance to use it," said com

just send over AIM, so I don't think that's likely to
change. Besides, opening up your computer to
sharing does increase security risks."
The Wirehog software, once downloaded
onto a computer, allows you to choose which

Wirehog is integrated with Thefacebook.com,
you can access friends' Wirehogs from their
profiles and the Wirehog connects you to your
friend's computer.

Wirehog, a file-sharing computer application
that is integrated with Thefacebook.com. was re
leased to Stanford users last week. The program
allows users to share and transfer documents,
movies and music over the Internet. But some are
concerned about copyright infringement when
using this service.
It was initially released to Harvard and Stan
ford to test how the network would scale once in
troduced to other universities.
Mark Zuckerberg. the founder of Theface
book.com and one of the Wirehog's three devel

opers, said that the feedback he has received
about the program has been overwhelmingly pos
itive.
"The reactions we've received range from 'this
is the coolest program ever' to 'what do I do with
this?'" Zuckerberg said in an interview with The
Daily.
Some students have been unclear about how
to use the application because of its innovation.
Zuckerberg said.
"We really made something original, which was
our goal," he said. "For the next release of Wire
hog to other schools, we've cleaned up many as
pects of the program that people weren't used to
in order to make them easier to navigate."

Zuckerberg and others view Wirehog as hav
ing the potential to improve student life.
"An important aspect of communication is
sharing information, and with Wirehog, transfer
ring files between friends will be much easier than
it is today," Zuckerberg said. "I also think Wire
hog will enable friends to share parts of their lives
through pictures, videos, and other media, which
hopefully will make computer use a richer social
experience."
"Sharing files with friends isn't an entirely new
concept, since things like Ofoto.com and iTunes
have been trying to do that for quite some time
now," said junior Julie Zhuo, the co-president of
Women In Computer Science.
"Thefacebook integration is pretty cool. I think
that this integration will probably be a big selling
point for people interested in downloading Wire
hog."
Despite concerns about the likelihood that
students will use the new program to share copy
righted materials, Zuckerberg said that recent
court cases involving the Morpheus and Grokster
file-sharing services indicate that Wirehog is
legal.
"I think the concern from the RIAA [Record
ing Industry Association of America] and MPAA
|Motion Picture Association of America] is over
individuals using Wirehog to distribute songs and
movies to which they don't own the copyrights,"
he said.
"However, Wirehog is designed to facilitate
transfers of socially relevant media, like photos,
home videos, music by local artists who tend to
want their music distributed freely on the Inter
net, and documents, so I doubt the RIAA or
MPAA will have a problem with that."
Fred von Lohmann, Stanford alumnus and se
nior intellectual property attorney for the Elec
tronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-profit
group dedicated to protecting "digital civil liber
ties," said that students should be cautious about
copyright infringement when using Wirehog to
transfer music and movie files.
"The entertainment industries have begun fil
ing thousands of lawsuits against people that they
catch uploading their music and movies on public
P2P networks like Kazaa and eDonkey," he said.
"Obviously, you are less likely to get caught if you
only share with friends using software like Wire
hog, but there is no guarantee that investigators
might not start trying to infiltrate large semi-pub
lic networks, including those that might be created
using Wirehog and social networks like the The
facebook."
Von Lohmann said that Wirehog can and
should be utilized for many legal uses, such as
sharing non-infringing files available on the Inter
net Archive collection of over 17,(XX) live concert
recordings from more than 7(X) bands.
"As with many other things, students who are
interested in file sharing should get educated
about the issue — what the law says, what copy
right owners are doing about it.and exactly how to
configure and use the various software applica
tions," von Lohmann said.
Von Lohmann added that on his group's Web
site, students can get information to help them un-

derstand "their
rights and re
sponsibilities
online ... (and)
the important
policy issues at
the intersection
of copyright,
free expression,
and new digital
technologies.
After all, copy
right laws get
made by the
people we all
just sent back to
Congress. If you
don't like the
way the laws are
working, let
them know
about it."
As a matter
of policy, the
111 forma t ion
Technology
Systems and
Services (ITSS)
department at
Stanford does
not comment
on particular
systems.

"If members
of the Stanford community are considering using
a particular method, they should ensure that in
doing so they comply with Stanford's computer
policies and all applicable laws," said Nancy
Ware, director of business planning and commu
nication at ITSS.
" They should also ensure that they do not create
a risk of harm to their computers or of exposure of
private information about themselves or others."
Wirehog was developed by three college stu
dents — Mark Zuckerberg and Andrew McCol
lum of Harvard and Adam D'Angelo of Caltech
— during the summer and fall of 20()4. Zucker
berg and McCollum have taken time off of school
this year to work in Palo Alto, Calif.
