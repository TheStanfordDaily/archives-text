Wirehog, a file-sharing computer application
that is integrated with Thefacebook.com. was re
leased to Stanford users last week. The program
allows users to share and transfer documents,
movies and music over the Internet. But some are
concerned about copyright infringement when
using this service.
It was initially released to Harvard and Stan
ford to test how the network would scale once in
troduced to other universities.
Mark Zuckerberg. the founder of Theface
book.com and one of the Wirehog's three devel

opers, said that the feedback he has received
about the program has been overwhelmingly pos
itive.
"The reactions we've received range from 'this
is the coolest program ever' to 'what do I do with
this?'" Zuckerberg said in an interview with The
Daily.
Some students have been unclear about how
to use the application because of its innovation.
Zuckerberg said.
"We really made something original, which was
our goal," he said. "For the next release of Wire
hog to other schools, we've cleaned up many as
pects of the program that people weren't used to
in order to make them easier to navigate."

Zuckerberg and others view Wirehog as hav
ing the potential to improve student life.
"An important aspect of communication is
sharing information, and with Wirehog, transfer
ring files between friends will be much easier than
it is today," Zuckerberg said. "I also think Wire
hog will enable friends to share parts of their lives
through pictures, videos, and other media, which
hopefully will make computer use a richer social
experience."
"Sharing files with friends isn't an entirely new
concept, since things like Ofoto.com and iTunes
have been trying to do that for quite some time
