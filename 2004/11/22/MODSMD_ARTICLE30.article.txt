# Stoudamire leads Wildcats
## 
### ROMAN VEYTSMAN THE DAILY WILDCAT (U. OF ARIZONA 
U-WIREâ€” The Arizona men's
basketball team's senior leaders
did more than just lead in Thurs
day night's game against Wright
State. They dominated, scoring 37
points on 14-of-22 shooting in the
Wildcats' 83-66 win in McKale
Center.
Senior guard Salim
Stoudamire hit 3-pointer after 3-
pointer in the first half en route to
24 points, 17 of which came in the
opening period.
"My teammates were finding
me," Stoudamire said. "I felt good,
it was one of those games where it
was just a huge bucket."
He spotted up from the left side
of the court on a consistent basis
and drained contested shots in the
face of the Raider defenders. In
transition, and in halfcourt sets,
against man and against zone,
Stoudamire ran to that left wing
and punished Wright State for not
getting their hands close enough to
his face.
"I run the left lane, so it just
happens to be that spot,"
Stoudamire said nonchalantly. "I
was just shooting it."
After fellow senior Channing
Frye's sub-par performance
against San Diego, the big man
returned to what the Wildcats ex
pect. collecting 13 points and two
blocked shots in just 25 minutes.
Frye made 6-of-10 shots from the

floor, and took better shots, ac
cording to head coach Lute
Olson.
"Every time someone was going
to the bucket, he did a good job of
challenging shots," Olson said.
Frye was the leading scorer for
Arizona in the Wildcats' two exhi
bit ion games but has struggled
somewhat in the lirst two Presea
son NIT games.
"He needs to run the court a lit
tle better," Olson said. "But it's
not his shot selection that's the
problem."
"You won't see him go 3-for-12
very often," Olson said. " The shots
he had against San Diego are the
shots we want him to take."
While Frye played better, he
openly handed over the scoring
reins to his classmate.
Stoudamire's barrage not only
helped the offense score 83 points,
hut it energized the defense, allow
ing for more full-court pressure
after made baskets.
The Wildcats gave up less than
70 points for the second straight
game and held Wright State to 37.5
percent from the floor in the first
half.
"When Salim got hot, you can
feel the momentum shifting," said
junior guard Chris Rodgers. "All
the guys got really excited and we
picked up our defensive intensity."
Stoudamire's defense was su
perb, keeping Raider star
DaShaun Wood in check, holding
him to just two first-half points.
"I want to establish everything

on the defensive end first of all,"
Stoudamire said.
Wood gave Stoudamire a cheap
shot in the first half, but
Stoudamire didn't retaliate, choos
ing instead to shut him down.
"I just wanted to get into him
defensively," Stoudamire said.
"Defensively, he was the best
player on the floor," Olson added.
"He did an unbelievable job on
Wood."
In addition to his shooting,
Stoudamire took over the point
guard duties when Mustafa Shakur
was out of the game. While not his
natural position, he played the role
well, turning the hall over only
once.
"Salim will do a great job at the
point," Olson said. "I feel very,
very comfortable with him when
we're resting Mustafa. Salim will
run the show and do a good job."
Stoudamire made 6-of-7 shots
(5-for-6 on 3-pointers) in the first
half, missing only a 3-point attempt
from NBA range.
The Wildcats as a team shot

first 3-point attempt of the game,
Stoudamire overtook third place
on UA's career 3-point attempts
list from Jason Terry.
Stoudamire is also third in 3-
point makes, putting him behind
his cousin Damon Stoudamire and
Jason Gardner. His 3-point shoot
ing percentage is 43.8 percent, sec
ond all-time on the UA list, behind
Steve Kerr's 57 percent.
