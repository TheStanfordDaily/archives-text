# 'Stanford nights': Social dance culture thrives
## 
### BEA SANFORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Amid the thousands of Stanford
students who take Social Dance I at
some point in their Stanford career, a
small group of students waltz through
every dance class that Stanford offers
and spend their weekends hopping
from one dance event to another. They
are the core group of Stanford's thriv
ing dance community.
Weekly events like the Ragtime
Ball held on Nov. 12 give evidence of
Stanford's unique dance culture.
Many students credit the popularity of
social dance on campus to the teaching
of Richard Powers, who has taught
dance at Stanford since 1992.
Powers, who teaches all of the so
cial dance classes, said he has seen a
dramatic change in the dance commu
nitv over the 13 years he has taught at

Stanford.
"When I was [first] hired, classes
were small, about 20 students. (Now),
between daytime and nighttime class
es, 1 have about 1,0()() students per
quarter."
Stanford's core dance community
has many students who took one or
two classes and wound up addicted to
dancing.
Sophomore Cailin Creighton was
one student who started out innocu
ously enough taking Social 1 in fall
quarter of her freshman year, going to
Dance Lab on Fridays, and attending
an occasional dance. A year later,
Creighton now runs Dance Lab and
says she dances about ten hours a
week between going to on-campus
dance classes, the Ballroom Dance
Supply on Thursday nights and on

Junior Jon Gaw also came to
Stanford with relatively little dance
experience and quickly became in
volved in the dance community.
Gaw said he got into dancing be
cause he "had some really good
friends who started dragging [him]
to things." Gaw now dances for the
student-led dance group Swingtime.
Held autumn quarter of each
year, the Ragtime Ball is a prime
opportunity for beginning
dancers to practice newly ac
quired moves.
Freshman Danielle Piatt, who is
taking Social Dance I this quarter,
said the Nov. 12 ball was a good
chance to see more of what dance at
Stanford is like.
"I've been to Jammix before, but
I was really amazed to see the peo
ple who came to Ragtime Ball from
all ages and backgrounds."
With attendance required for all
students in Social Dance I and 11, the
ball sold out quickly. About 370
people attended, according to Ju
nior Dominika Sudomir, who
chaired the Ragtime Ball Team.
Powers attributed the popularity
of dance at Stanford to the unique
approach his classes take toward
dance.
"This is the only program like this
in the country, that emphasizes ver
nacular social dance."
Students choose to take Social
Dance fora variety of reasons.
Some, like Piatt, take the class be
cause they heard it was fun. Others,
said Powers, initially sign up for So
cial Dance I because friends made
them agree to.
"The students who take Social I
often got their arms twisted into it.

This makes it harder on me as a
teacher, hut they soon find out how
much they like it, and then really
start enjoying the class."
Although avid dancers like
Creighton and Gaw first got into
dance through Stanford's classes,
they both said that on-campus class
es can only take a dancer so far.
"A lot of people get really into
dancing and take all of Richard's
classes, and so they start going off
campus," said Creighton. Gaw
said that dancing off-campus is
necessary to gain experience: "So
cial dance off-campus is very dif
ferent in style and attitude than
on-campus."
Graduate student David Kale,
who has taken many classes under
Powers and also dances for Swing
time, said he felt that Stanford stu
dents are more prepared than most
to adapt their style of dance to out
side influences.
"The best dancers I've ever met
are Stanford dancers, because
they're conscious of their partners."
Powers makes a point in his class
es to emphasize consideration of
one's partner.
"Dance teaches connecting to
people, especially flexibility-adapt
ing to people, to situations.... Social
dance is a way to find out if it doesn't
work out one way, it'll work out an
other."
Kale said he sees flexibility as cru
cial in partnering.
"It's not about following the rules
and doing [moves], but about expe
riencing your partner." Kale de
scribes some moments in dance as "a
flow state. You're just unconscious,
the dance takes over.... That's a mo
ment of grace, when you overcome
estrangement."
