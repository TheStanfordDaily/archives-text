# 'Stanford nights': Social dance culture thrives
## 
### BEA SANFORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Amid the thousands of Stanford
students who take Social Dance I at
some point in their Stanford career, a
small group of students waltz through
every dance class that Stanford offers
and spend their weekends hopping
from one dance event to another. They
are the core group of Stanford's thriv
ing dance community.
Weekly events like the Ragtime
Ball held on Nov. 12 give evidence of
Stanford's unique dance culture.
Many students credit the popularity of
social dance on campus to the teaching
of Richard Powers, who has taught
dance at Stanford since 1992.
Powers, who teaches all of the so
cial dance classes, said he has seen a
dramatic change in the dance commu
nitv over the 13 years he has taught at

Stanford.
"When I was [first] hired, classes
were small, about 20 students. (Now),
between daytime and nighttime class
es, 1 have about 1,0()() students per
quarter."
Stanford's core dance community
has many students who took one or
two classes and wound up addicted to
dancing.
Sophomore Cailin Creighton was
one student who started out innocu
ously enough taking Social 1 in fall
quarter of her freshman year, going to
Dance Lab on Fridays, and attending
an occasional dance. A year later,
Creighton now runs Dance Lab and
says she dances about ten hours a
week between going to on-campus
dance classes, the Ballroom Dance
Supply on Thursday nights and on
