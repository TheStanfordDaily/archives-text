The United States must pursue a
more aggressive policy in Sudan, in
cluding an embargo and sanctions, if
the violence there is to end, accord
ing to John Prendergast, special ad
visor to the president of the Interna
tional Crisis Group, an independent,
non-profit conflict-prevention orga
nization.
Prendergast was one of three pan
elists who discussed the genocide un
folding in the Darfur region of
Sudan at an event in the Hewlett
Teaching Center last night. The dis

cussion focused on the need for pub
lic involvement and the lack of deci
sive action from the international
political community.
Organized by the freshman intro
ductory seminar "Contemporary
African Politics," the event opened
with a screening of footage from the
recent "60 Minutes" documentary
on the Sudan crisis. The producer of
the documentary, Bill Owens, was
among the panelists, as was Cather
ine Wiesner, a UNICEF delegate in
the Sudan.


Panelists urged more international involvement in the continuing
genocide in Sudan at the Hewlett Teaching Center last night.
