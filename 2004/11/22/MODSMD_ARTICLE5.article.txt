# U.S. must get tough with Sudan, says discussion panelist

### SIMON SHUSTER 
The United States must pursue a
more aggressive policy in Sudan, in
cluding an embargo and sanctions, if
the violence there is to end, accord
ing to John Prendergast, special ad
visor to the president of the Interna
tional Crisis Group, an independent,
non-profit conflict-prevention orga
nization.
Prendergast was one of three pan
elists who discussed the genocide un
folding in the Darfur region of
Sudan at an event in the Hewlett
Teaching Center last night. The dis

cussion focused on the need for pub
lic involvement and the lack of deci
sive action from the international
political community.
Organized by the freshman intro
ductory seminar "Contemporary
African Politics," the event opened
with a screening of footage from the
recent "60 Minutes" documentary
on the Sudan crisis. The producer of
the documentary, Bill Owens, was
among the panelists, as was Cather
ine Wiesner, a UNICEF delegate in
the Sudan.


Panelists urged more international involvement in the continuing
genocide in Sudan at the Hewlett Teaching Center last night.
Owens spoke about the logistical challenges
and emotional strain of making the "60 Minutes"
special, while Wiesner emphasized the scope of
the humanitarian crisis in Darfur.
Wiesner said that aid resources are stretched
extremely thm, citing the 200,000 refugees in
neighboring Chad and another 23,000 trapped at
the border with no supplies. Although some prob
lems have been partly addressed — such as the
140 refugee camps, steady inflow of provisions
and basic medical care — she said the humanitar
ian workers "totally dropped the ball in terms of
rape prevention."
For example, many female refugees have been
raped while gathering firewood, Wiesner said, so
"the problem of providing fuel sources should be
prioritized as much as, say, blankets."
Like the other panelists, her biggest frustrations
were with what she perceived as the inaction of
policy makers. She recalled a "sinister quality in
the lack of urgency felt when meeting with gov
ernment officials."
Prendergast focused on the failure of interna

tional diplomacy thus far in halting the crisis, par
ticularly the "deep division" that has kept the
U.N. Security Council from taking an assertive
stance. He claimed that Russia and China have
been the main opponents to intervention, largely
due to their fears of weakening the Sudanese oil
and weapons markets.
To complicate the crisis further, Prendergast
said the Sudanese government has openly sup
ported the Janjaweed militia in carrying out this
genocide, calling it"a government at war with its
own people."
Prendergast expressed disappointment specifi
cally with U.S. policy on the Sudan crisis, singling
out Secretary of State Colin Powell's carrot-and
stick policy of "constructive engagement" for not
sending a strong enough message. Under that pol
icy, he said. Sudanese officials have "consistently
pocketed incentives offered by the United States
while going on with genocidal policies."
Prendergast proposed a strategy for the Bush
administration that includes an international arms
embargo, travel sanctions on Sudanese officials

Meetings with government officials have
'sinister quality,' UNICEF delegate says

and the freezing of the officials' assets. He also
urged that the U.S. government use its influence in
the U.N. Security Council to "call China and Rus
sia's bluff" on intervention.
"If they threaten to veto intervention in Sudan,
then make it public that China seems to prioritize
oil policy over preventing humanitarian crisis."
Still, Prendergast had doubts about the Bush
administration's sway in the United Nations.
"Our moral authority, our leverage in the Se
curity Council is so compromised because of Iraq
that we might not be able pass the necessary mea
sures."
In the end, the message conveyed by each of the
panelists was the need for public awareness and,
more importantly, active involvement.
Prendergast encouraged students to join the
"Save Darfur Coalition," and outside the audito
rium, audience members lined up to make dona
tions and sign up for mailing lists.
"Genocide will be responded to only when
there is a political cost for not responding, and
that's up to us," Prendergast urged.
