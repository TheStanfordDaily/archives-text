# Stanford senior wins Rhodes scholarship
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY DESK EDITOR 
After a grueling six-month
process of filing applications, at
tending receptions and complet
ing interviews, senior Sarah Schul
man and 14 other finalists decided
to take refuge in a classic board
game as they waited to find out the
winners of this year's Rhodes
Scholarship from their district.
"We waited for three hours
while the judges deliberated,"
Schulman said. "We tried to occu
py ourselves. We played a rousing
game of Trivial Pursuit. Certainly
all of us were very nervous about
the outcome. It's awkward when
there can only be four winners but
there are 14 very qualified candi
dates."
Schulman emerged a big win
ner Saturday as one of 32 Rhodes
Scholars selected nationwide. She
is the only Stanford student to re
ceive the honor this year.
A human biology major, Schul
man will spend the next two to
three years studying Comparative
Social Policy at Oxford Universi
ty. She said her intellectual pas
sion lies at the intersection be
tween public health and educa
tion.
She is also completing a mas
ter's program in education policy
this year. A Texas native. Schul
man said she got her first taste of
working in public policy at age
seven.
"I saw this horrible advertise
ment on television picturing a
black cancerous lung, and I was so
disgusted by the picture that I sent
a letter to the school nurse asking,
'How could people smoke, and
what can I do to help?"'
The nurse forwarded the letter
to the Texas Department of
Health, which enlisted Schul
man's help to fight underage
smoking. At age 10, she did under
cover tobacco buys and discov
ered that every store she visited

was willing to sell her tobacco
products.
Schulman is still working down
in the trenches. She is on the board
of directors of the Texas March of
Dimes, and four years ago, she
founded a nonprofit consulting
firm called Youth Infusion to en
courage organizations to involve
young people in decision-making
processes.
"We're working with the De
partment of Health in Rhode Is
land to build a statewide youth ad
vocacy network," Schulman said
of her firm. "We'll go in and do a
three-month evaluation process
and then provide a series of rec
ommendations."
She is also in the process of re
searching and writing her senior
thesis, for which she received
grants totaling $10,000 from Stan
ford and the William T. Grant
Foundation. Her thesis will exam
ine how health departments in
four states organize adolescent
healthcare.
And, to top it all off, Schulman
is working as a research assistant
in the Division of Adolescent
Medicine at the School of Medi
cine, where she is designing an in
teractive website for obese adoles
cents as part of a study.
Dr. Rebecka Peebles, a re
search associate and clinician edu
cator with the Division of Adoles
cent Medicine, is working with
Schulman on the project.
"I think she's very bright, she
works extraordinarily well inde
pendently, and she has a very
strong moral code," Peebles said.
"She's very committed to advoca
cy in all forms, and she is commit
ted to effecting global change."
Schulman, who worked for the
U.S. assistant surgeon general last
summer, said the surgeon general
position is her ultimate career
goal.
"If she wants to be Surgeon
General. I'm sure she will become
Surgeon General," Peebles said.
