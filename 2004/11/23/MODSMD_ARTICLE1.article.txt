# Pro-Bush political signs vandalized
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD 
Before and after the heated
2004 presidential election, a string
of vandalism acts to Bush para
phernalia around campus left
many conservative students red in
the face.
"You can hate Bush all you

want, but you should
still at least be re
spectful," said Bush
support senior Silvia
Cruz, who lives in
Roble Hall.
Within several
weeks of moving in,
Cruz returned to her
room one day to find
a Bush flyer on her
door defaced. The
vandals left an
anonymous, obscen
ity-laced note
chastising Cruz for
her support of the

president and calling her an
"idiot."
"Why don't [they] come talk to
me face to face?" she said. "The
lack of respect is really annoying."
According to President of the
Stanford College Republicans Bob
Sensenbrenner. a junior, Cruz is

not the only conservative student
to have experienced intolerance.
"I've heard a lot of students
complain that things they value
have been defaced," he said. "It's
been a problem before, but espe
cially this election year."
As a result of potential backlash
and property damage, Sensenbren-

ner said some con
servative students
are afraid to speak
out in support of
Bush and Republi
cans.
"A lot of peo
ple who are Re
publican have to
live in a culture of
fear," he said.
"People are afraid
to say that they are
Republican be
cause their views
are not respected."
Cruz agreed.

"Personally, I'm not intimidat
ed," she said. "Other Republicans
don't speak out because of the
backlash. People hesitate to say
they're conservative on campus
because they're annoyed with the

responses they get."
Some conservative students
have also complained of property
damage.
Brian Hoggs, a junior living in
Toyon Hall, had his Bush bumper
slicker torn off his door after the
election.
"It's perfectly fine to disagree
with people's political views," he
wrote in an e-mail to the Toyon
dorm list. "But destruction of pri
vate property is definitely not
cool.'' Boggs added in his e-mail
that he hoped the culprit would
come forward to replace the sticker
.ind pay for any fines resulting from

the damaged door.
Some dorms, like Roble, will
pay for property damage caused by
vandalism.
"We would ask for money from
dorm government to make sure
students aren't victimized," said
Roble resident assistant Eli Ca
marillo, a senior.
As far as residential policy goes,
however, there is no campus-wide
guideline for how to handle van
dalism, he added.
"They are normally handled on a
case-by-case basis," Camarillo said.
He added that damage to pri
vate property is "taken very seri

ously" by dorm staff. "This is a
problem for the community in gen
eral, Acts of intolerance create
problems in the dorm."
President of the Stanford De
mocrats Kai Stinchcombe, a doc
toral student in political science,
condemned vandalism targeted at
conservatives.
"However much people dislike
Bush and Cheney, everyone should
respect people's right to support
the candidate of choice," he said.
"Everyone has a right to free
speech and political expression,
and anyone who's trying to deny
that right, to coerce and influence

that right, should be ashamed of
themselves."
Stinchcombe, however, dis
missed conservative claims that the
Stanford campus is oppressive to
Republicans.
"There's no conspiracy," he
said, adding that most student-van
dals "are likely drunk."
"Conservatives think that
everyone hates them, but that's not
the case," Stinchcombe added.
"Election years always highlight
differences, and make them bigger
than they actually are. I'm not sur
prised tensions are high."
