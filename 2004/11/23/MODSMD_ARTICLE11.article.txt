1970 - On Nov. 23, The Daily ran a
story about the Stanford Band's run
through San Francisco before the Big
Game. Below is an excerpt:
"Police, a more-than-topless
dancer, several dazed alumni, and
over 3,000 rooters, revelers, and as
sorted parade chasers frolicked in
the streets Friday night as the In
comparable Stanford Band went on
its annual pre-game lurch through
the City of San Francisco.
"The parade originated in the
plush halls of the Fairmont Hotel
and culminated in North Beach,
where the band accompanied a lush
dancer who was, to say the least,
scantily dressed.
"In point of fact, she wore noth
ing at ail save a pair of gold-spangled
spike-heeled shoes. One bandsman
later remarked in disgust, 'And me
with my foot fetish.'
"As the police - San Francisco's
stalwart guardians of the public
morals - opened a path for the
dancer, the expression on Drum
Major Geordie Lawry's face was one
of supreme amazement and mortifi
cation. What Lawry said at the exact
moment the girl stepped out of her
rode was not recorded for posterity,
but it was probably unprintable any
way."

1999 - On Nov. 23, The Daily ran a
story about Stanford's Catholic
Community's decision to re-open its
ministry to gays and lesbians. Below
is an excerpt:
"The organization was started
two-and-a-half years ago, primarily
among graduate students. Com
posed of half-a-dozen students, it
was nevertheless very active.
"Last year, however, the group
closed after several members gradu
ated. In response to the renewed in
terest of students, the Gay and Les
bian Catholic Community re
opened its doors at an organization
al meeting Nov. 15.
"it's a good place to meet les
bians and gays who are Catholics,'
said Father Patrick Laßelle, chap
lain to Stanford's Catholic commu
nity. 'Conversation is helpful in pro
viding solidarity.'
Rev. D. Maurice Charles, associ
ate dean for Religious Life, empha
sized similarity. 'What I can say is
that at least 15 to 20 students have
told me that they would like to have
a group to discuss queer/religious is
sues and also to have the freedom to
pray and worship together without
having to hide or bracket their sexu
ality.'"
