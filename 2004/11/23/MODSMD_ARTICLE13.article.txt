# Cooling technology helps athletes Improve strength, endurance

### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
When a sweaty, shirt-soaked soccer play
er heads out to the field to score a goal, he's
busy thinking about his opponents' moves,
his team's strategy and his personal plan of
action. His body, however, is concentrating
on another goal: lowering his rising body
temperature.
As the muscles in the soccer player's body
work hard, either during cardiovascular ex
ercise or weight training, they produce heat,
forcing his body to work hard to cool him
down. Millions of specialized skin glands
produce sweat that cools down his body as
the liquid evaporates. And as his body gets
hotter and hotter, athletic performance and
endurance usually suffer.
In order to help people engaged in stren
uous activity cool down quickly, two Stan
ford researchers, biological sciences Prof.
Craig Heller and senior researcher Dennis
Grahn, have developed a new body cooling
technology that can extend endurance and
enhance athletic performance.
The technology was licensed to AVAcore
Technologies, Inc., an Ann Arbor-based
company that is developing the product for
use in professional sports as well as for cer
tain medical conditions that require the cool
ing of the body temperature.
How does it work? Alter engaging in
physical activity, an athlete sticks his or her
hand into the device. An airtight seal is
made around the wrist, and the device pulls
some air out of the chamber. More blood is
pulled into the hand from the body as a re
sult of the pressure differential. The device
circulates cold air over the palm of the hand
and the blood in the hand cools down. The
result: The cooler blood will eventually cir
culate back to the heart, reducing core
body temperature.
"Heat is the limiting factor in the ability to
increase strength and endurance," said Dr.
Allan Dumont, a researcher at AVAcore
Technologies Inc. "By taking heat away
from the core, people can increase their
strength faster and last longer. For example,
football players who have used the technolo
gy are able to play as well in the fourth quar
ter as they played in their first quarter."
The device works for high-intensity active
sports such as running and cycling as well as
activities such as weight-lifting.
Heller and Grahn, animal physiologists,
were originally working on finding ways to
regulate the body temperature of patients
undergoing anesthesia, when they realized

that their device could be used for perfectly
healthy people in need of rapid temperature
cooling.
" The original effort was to warm patients
undergoing anesthesia by circulating warm
air instead of cold air in the device," Heller
said. "After we licensed that technology to a
company that didn't do much with it, we
turned to the problem of heat extraction, or
cooling."
Heller and Grahn asked one of their lab
assistants to do 10 sets of pull-ups to exhaus
tion. In each successive set, the number of
pull-ups decreased as the lab assistant got
more and more tired.
" Then we cooled him down with the de

vice," Heller said. " The number of pull-ups
he could do after cooling went right back up
to the number he could do at the first set, and
we said, 'Oh my God, there is something re
ally going on here." "
Impressed with the initial results. Heller
and Grahn decided to push their instincts
further. They had the same assistant undergo
six weeks of pull-up workouts without cool
ing and then six weeks of cooling following
every set. T he results were dramatic: In the
first six weeks, he went from doing 100 to 180
pull-ups, while during the cooling program,
his pull-up capacity skyrocketed from 180 to
600 pull-ups.
Since then, the researchers have worked

with a variety of competitive sports teams
to improve performance.
"As of now, we haven't done the defini
tive study to demonstrate that this works, but
we've seen results from the athletes that
shows promise," (irahn said.
Many Stanford athletes have tried the
cooling device.
"We've worked with the track team, foot
ball team, swimming teams, and we're just
starting a program with the crew team,"
Heller said.
The device has also been used by profes
sional sports teams such as the San Francisco
49ers, the Oakland Raiders and the Miami
Hurricanes.

One of the problems of working with ath
letes, however, is that either that they don't
like to do the same workout every day or
they have strength training problems de
signed by someone other than the re
searcher.
"I'm eertainly not going to tell the head
strengthening trainer for the 49ers that his
athletes need to follow our program so that
we get some numbers," (irahn explained. "It
is very difficult to do anything definitive with
athletic teams — you have to leave it up to
them."
The researchers hope to extend the use of
the technology to people involved in strenu
ous professions, such as firefighters, con
struction workers and even soldiers. In fact,
the research is now partly funded by the re
search section of the Department of Defense
— the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency — for use in military operations.
"Soldiers are often exposed to very ex
treme environments," Heller said. "They
have to carry heavy packs and wear a lot of
protective gear. We are trying to design
systems that will both protect and cool mil
itary personnel, improving performance
and endurance."
AVAcore will also continue to refine the
technology for medical use. People with mul
tiple sclerosis — an often debilitating dis
ease that affects the protective tissue of the
nervous system — are able to increase mus
cle performance when they use the tempera
ture-cooling unit.
"People with multiple sclerosis can have
heat-related disabilities," Dumont said.
" Their nerves are exposed, and when the
body heats up, it can impede with the nerve
signal, making it more difficult to get a ner
vous signal across."
Over the years, the research team has
worked to reduce the size of the unit in order
to make it easier to carry around and use in
the field, hospital and eventually in extreme
environments.
"We've made significant improvements
of the last four years," he said. "Our latest
version weighs about eight pounds, and our
goal is to get it down to two pounds."
Regular people looking to get their own
version so that they too can dramatically in
crease performance will have to wait a few
years.
"For now, the unit isn't quite ready for the
market," Dumont said. "We have to im
prove our quality control, increase produc
tion so that the unit is less expensive and
make it more portable. Hut when it is ready,
it has the potential to be very successful."
