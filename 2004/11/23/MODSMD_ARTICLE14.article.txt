## Research on supersonic planes could revolutionize air travel

Weary of long airplane flights? Wish you could jot
from New York to China in less time than it takes to
take a road trip to Los Angeles?
Last Tuesday, researchers came one step closer
to making that a reality. NASA's successful test
Hight of an experimental plane called the X43A
achieved speeds of 7,200 miles per hour — a speed
known as Mach 10, or 10 times the speed of sound
and demonstrated the future possibilities for less
expensive satellite launches, quicker rockets and
maybe even supersonic commercial travel.
Since the 19505, governments and aeronautic sci
entists around the world have explored options to
make planes go faster — much faster. Presently, av
erage commercial planes fly at 550 to 600 m.p.h., and
with the official retirement of the Concorde in 2003,
the Boeing 747 is narrowly the fastest commercial air
liner, capable of speeds up to 720 m.p.h.
Within military technology, the fastest jet is the
SR-71 — unofficially known as the "Blackbird" —
capable going up to 2,400 m.p.h. Originally created
for long-range reconnaissance missions, the planes
are now mostly used for high-speed, high-tempera
ture aerodynamics research, according to the Drv
den Flight Research Center. Yet the SR-71 is rela
tively inefficient in fuel use. making it unviable for
commercial use.
The X43A, utilizing supersonic combination ram
jet—or scramjet — technology proposes to take
the next aeronautic leap. Scramjet technology dra
matically increases speeds and has the possibility of
greater fuel efficiency than the technology used in
the military's SR-71.

Scramjet technology used in the X43A operates in
a manner very different from traditional planes or
rockets. The engine occupies the entire lower surface
of the airplane body, as opposed to the sides of a typ
ical aircraft.
Once the plane achieves speeds of approximately

2,800 m.p.h., the scramjet compresses the air passing
through the engine, allowing combustion to occur. It
is believed that this technology has the potential of
achieving speeds up to 10,000 m.p.h.
At Stanford, Mechanical Engineering Profs. M.
Godfrey Munual and Ron Hanson are leading re

search that will further improve on scramjet technol
ogy. The team is looking at different flame-holding
and mixing enhancement concepts involved in super
sonic combustion.
One specific area of research the team is looking at
involves the Stanford expansion tube — a low-impulse
flow device that mixes gases of different pressures to
achieve a mixture that can reach a high velocity. ITie re
search lab is also using super-fast imaging techniques to
study the physics of scramjet technology.
Besides the speed, the greatest advantage of
scramjet technology is that it doesn't require addi
tional oxygen, carried in oxygen canisters. Currently
used to achieve speeds above Mach 3, oxygen canis
ters are typically used for booster rockets.
Scramjet technology allows oxygen to be taken di
rectly from the atmosphere, lightening the load nec
essary for flight. In turn, the vehicle can carry heavier
payloads, including larger satellites.
Even though there have been significant ad
vances in scramjet technology, much progress is
needed prior to the implementation of the tech
nology.
First, the speeds of the X43A create incredible
amounts of heat and tension. Additionally, the de
sign of the craft — including the materials and de
sign — requires more research and development.
The prototype used in the testing was unable to
hold a payload, and more resembled a two-dimen
sional plane than a jumbo jet, so there is a lot of
work to be done.
"What we're trying to do is really get to the reality
of flight: 112 ind out what does work, what doesn't
work," said Vince Rausch, program manager of the
X43A, in an interview with the Associated Press. "So
there is risk in this program."
While the X43A continues to advance, not all ex
perts believe it will ever be usable for commercial
flight. Many people cite the Concorde as an example
of the inefficiencies in fuel usage of supersonic com
mercial flight. The Concorde's inaugural commercial
flight in 1976 came after seven years of testing. Before
its retirement, the Concord was only taking three
flights a day due to its heavy fuel consumption.
As oil prices continue to fluctuate, it is unlikely that
the airline industry will invest in a fuel-inefficient
plane. I lowever, if the scramjet technology continues
to develop and can attain fuel costs lower than the
Concorde, it holds the possibility of revolutionizing
the airline industry.

NASA's experimental plane, the X43A, was able to reach flight speeds of over 7,000 miles per hour.
Some believe that scramjet technology has the potential to revolutionize the airline industry in the decades to come.
