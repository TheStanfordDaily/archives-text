## Editorial Dorm-based advisor is useful 
### 
For several years now. Stanford students have
generally agreed that undergraduate advising
at the Farm is unreliable and ineffective. Due
to the persistence of these complaints, the
University decided to take an aggressive approach to
ward reforming the undergraduate advising program
this year. Among other changes, the most innovative
has been the creation of the Academic Director posi
tion at Wilbur Hall.
The position, currently filled by Christina Mesa, a
former lecturer in the Humanities Department, an
swers to the need fora more professional and accessi
ble advising resource for Stanford undergraduates.
However, the lack of awareness of this new resource
shows that the improvements made in undergraduate
advising remain far from complete.
The Academic Director's purpose is to serve as an
on-site advising resource and to handle any matters
the Academic Advisors, Head Peer Academic Coor
dinators and Peer Academic Advisors cannot ad
dress.
With the Academic Director present five days a
week from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., students are likely to feel
more encouraged and eager to seek advice from such
a University faculty member who might offer a fresh
perspective that may not be available from their stu
dent counterparts.
And as a full-time University employee, the Aca
demic Director has connections to other University
faculty and resources that remain inaccessible to stu
dent advisors.
Current undergraduate and faculty advisors are
spread out across a variety of disciplines, making it
sometimes difficult for students to receive the advis
ing they want in their desired field of study. However,
since the Academic Director's main role is to advise

students, no matter what their background, she pos
sesses familiarity with the University's wide range of
academic programs.
Most importantly, the Academic Director's longer
and daily office hours allow students to have someone
readily available whenever they face an academic cri
sis that demands immediate attention. Students not in
Wilbur have to make an appointment with their aca
demic advisor or someone from the UAC to resolve
their concerns, which is not nearly as easy or conve
nient.
Despite the position's apparent success, the new
reforms have problems the University must address.
While Wilbur's Academic Director has proven help
ful to many, a significant number of Wilbur freshmen
with whom The Daily spoke had little idea who she
was.
Although several of the freshmen said they had
been introduced to her at the beginning of the year,
many did not know the advising service was available
at Wilbur. This shows the University has failed to
properly inform students about an invaluable re
source that exists only a few steps away.
Wilbur's pilot program proves that a full-time ad
visor fulfills a pertinent need among Stanford under
graduates for more guidance and support. In creating
this position, the University is on the right track to
ward undergraduate advising reform. We would sug
gest it should continue expanding the program into
other freshmen-concentrated dormitories.
However, if the University does choose to partake
in this expansion, those in charge must take care to
publicize this advising service properly so that the
program's potential beneficiaries will not be short
changed of the opportunity for an improved advising
experience.
