# Pet Peeves
## Following your passion isn't always easy 
### YAMANDA WRIGHT 
According to teen magazines and
my mother, choosing a major in col
lege is one of those decisions that
will change the course of your life
forever. Once you put your passion
down on paper, you'll be forced to
"love what you do" fora number of
years before retiring in Florida with
your cat.
Should you become famous and
affect the world in some legendary
fashion, the made-for-TV movie
about your life will center on the one
crucial moment sophomore year
when you signed your soul over to a
Stanford department.
So it's important that you select
an area of knowledge perfect for
your ambitions and customized to fit
your personality. Otherwise, you
might end up some washed-up En
glish major working at Barnes &
Noble for the rest of your life be
cause you were the only one in the
group interview who knew that
"One Hundred Years of Solitude" is
not a self-help book.
Apparently, this is the time when
what you want to be when you grow
up comes into effect. Despite the

University's emphasis on following
your passion — whatever that high
ly ambiguous and low-income term
means — it translates into a major,
which translates to a career, and ev
erything is surprisingly linear.
I've wanted to be anything and
everything from a dermatologist to a
background dancer for Janet Jack
son. but 1 could not give you a rea
son for every whim if my life de
pended on it, nor could I commit to
my passions for longer than three
days.
"What are you majoring in?" de
mands the grandmother/cashier /
advisor. Why not cut to the chase
and ask "What is the meaning of
life?" or "How do you plan to die?"
We are 19 and 20 years old. How
should we know?
It's one of those annoying, me
chanical questions people constant
ly ask you as a college student like
"How's school, genius?" or
"When's the last time you called
your father?" And feeling com
pelled to say something, 1 resort to
pulling an answer out of my ass.
Why, just last week, I was online
for hours searching fora laser tag
place and pushing my hamper of

dirty clothes under my bed. and you
expect me to show that much matu
rity? I still laugh hysterically at Jim
Carrey movies, get embarrassed
when someone points out phallic
imagery in a comparative literature
class and concoct disturbing mix
tures with everyone's leftover food
at restaurants.
Your choices are as follows: You
could subscribe to a lifelong rela
tionship with the popular major X
and rake in the dough like leaves
upon graduation.
You could also become what is
safe or what is expected by nestling
yourself in mediocre suburbia with a
white picket fence and a two-car
garage.
Or you could take whatever
classes your heart desires and hope
they fall into some major by the end
of your senior year.
I choose option three.
