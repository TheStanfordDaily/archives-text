# Sketch: Tales of Graduate Student Life
## Mmm ... free donuts 
### 
Food, glorious food. There's
nothing quite like it. Ex
cept free glorious food. Or
for that matter just ordi
nary food, so long as it's free. In
fact, we could he talking about
four-day-old, semi-congealed
pizza, and for your average grad
student, there would still be noth
ing quite like it.
I must confess I never really un
derstood the appeal of free food.
Well, that's not true. I understand
the appeal — it's the obsession
that I don't get.
It's one thing to take the oppor
tunity fora complimentary meal
every now and again, but the re
lentless pursuit of grub can be
taken too far.
For example, should you find
yourself torn between the slightly
stale donuts at a Wednesday after
noon CS colloquium or a back rub
from Inga the Swedish exchange
student, you're probably putting a
little too much emphasis on the
donuts.
Actually, that's a little bit of an
exaggeration: I've never met any
one who turned down Inga.
However, 1 do have a number of
friends who will sacrifice more ful
filling social engagements (i.e.
things where they might have had
fun) at the mere hint of a gratis
snack.
Now, don't get me wrong, I like
food. I even prefer not to pay for it.
However, unlike many other areas
of my life, when it comes to what I
eat, I have standards.
I find that constructing a diet
around the typically available
sources of free nourishment is
often a little less than satisfying.
While the major food groups of
donuts, bagels and other topologi-
non-trivial fodder are well
covered, that doesn't seem truly
sufficient fora healthy and varied
diet.
Even the more upscale events
that one goes to lose their distin
guishing touches after awhile.
There are, on balance, only a finite
number of ways to combine cheese
with puff pastry before it becomes
a tad repetitive.
The thing that really bothers me
is that chasing after food seems so
terribly desperate. It's difficult not
to appear like a Victorian street
urchin relying on the largesse of
the passing gentry.
This apparent lack of self-suffi
ciency is particularly galling be
cause it fuels our graduate student
status as being not quite grown up.

After all, it's hard to claim control
over one's destiny if one deterio
rates into a frantic wreck at the
mention of a free meal.
What's more, contrary to popu
lar perception (including our own),
grad students are not inordinately
impoverished.
Sure, we're not raking in invest-

ment banking
salaries —
though if there
are any recruiters
out there, 1 reck
on a physics doc
toral is great
preparation for
the world of fi
nance. However,
we're not quite in
the bread line ei
ther, and I'm not

sure it behooves us to behave as if
we were.
Of course, to be fair, there are
some fringe benefits that arise
from chasing every morsel of free
food.
Parcelling out sustenance is the
principal mode of engagement for
grad student events, and while
these occasions leave a lot to be de
sired as social gatherings, they do
have the advantage of attracting a
varied selection of people.
Thankfully, even attractive and
entertaining folk get hungry. And,
if you are willing to lower yourself
to the level of the feeding trough,
you too can enjoy their company.
Actually, now that we've sunk
into the 11-and-a-half-month lull
in the graduate school social calen
dar, it may be that group eating is
all we have left for awhile.
This Thursday sees the annual
GSC Thanksgiving dinner, which
I'm certain will be a wonderful way
to meet new and interesting peo
ple. Of course, if you are attending
the "buffet-style" dinner at Wilbur
Hall, it probably means that your
only other option was staying
home.
Don't feel too bad. though — at
least you're not paying for it.
Well, it's been a delight as al
ways. Enjoy the long weekend and
whatever cuisine it may bring. 1
have to dash off now — apparently
they're handing out free candy at
the children's hospital...

Nav will be spending his Thanks
giving at home with several bottles
of two-buck Chuck. E-mail

Food, glorious food. There's
nothing quite like it. Ex
cept free glorious food. Or
for that matter just ordi
nary food, so long as it's free. In
fact, we could he talking about
four-day-old, semi-congealed
pizza, and for your average grad
student, there would still be noth
ing quite like it.
I must confess I never really un
derstood the appeal of free food.
Well, that's not true. I understand
the appeal — it's the obsession
that I don't get.
It's one thing to take the oppor
tunity fora complimentary meal
every now and again, but the re
lentless pursuit of grub can be
taken too far.
For example, should you find
yourself torn between the slightly
stale donuts at a Wednesday after
noon CS colloquium or a back rub
from Inga the Swedish exchange
student, you're probably putting a
little too much emphasis on the
donuts.
Actually, that's a little bit of an
exaggeration: I've never met any
one who turned down Inga.
However, 1 do have a number of
friends who will sacrifice more ful
filling social engagements (i.e.
things where they might have had
fun) at the mere hint of a gratis
snack.
Now, don't get me wrong, I like
food. I even prefer not to pay for it.
However, unlike many other areas
of my life, when it comes to what I
eat, I have standards.
I find that constructing a diet
around the typically available
sources of free nourishment is
often a little less than satisfying.
While the major food groups of
donuts, bagels and other topologi-
non-trivial fodder are well
covered, that doesn't seem truly
sufficient fora healthy and varied
diet.
Even the more upscale events
that one goes to lose their distin
guishing touches after awhile.
There are, on balance, only a finite
number of ways to combine cheese
with puff pastry before it becomes
a tad repetitive.
The thing that really bothers me
is that chasing after food seems so
terribly desperate. It's difficult not
to appear like a Victorian street
urchin relying on the largesse of
the passing gentry.
This apparent lack of self-suffi
ciency is particularly galling be
cause it fuels our graduate student
status as being not quite grown up.

After all, it's hard to claim control
over one's destiny if one deterio
rates into a frantic wreck at the
mention of a free meal.
What's more, contrary to popu
lar perception (including our own),
grad students are not inordinately
impoverished.
Sure, we're not raking in invest-

ment banking
salaries —
though if there
are any recruiters
out there, 1 reck
on a physics doc
toral is great
preparation for
the world of fi
nance. However,
we're not quite in
the bread line ei
ther, and I'm not

sure it behooves us to behave as if
we were.
Of course, to be fair, there are
some fringe benefits that arise
from chasing every morsel of free
food.
Parcelling out sustenance is the
principal mode of engagement for
grad student events, and while
these occasions leave a lot to be de
sired as social gatherings, they do
have the advantage of attracting a
varied selection of people.
Thankfully, even attractive and
entertaining folk get hungry. And,
if you are willing to lower yourself
to the level of the feeding trough,
you too can enjoy their company.
Actually, now that we've sunk
into the 11-and-a-half-month lull
in the graduate school social calen
dar, it may be that group eating is
all we have left for awhile.
This Thursday sees the annual
GSC Thanksgiving dinner, which
I'm certain will be a wonderful way
to meet new and interesting peo
ple. Of course, if you are attending
the "buffet-style" dinner at Wilbur
Hall, it probably means that your
only other option was staying
home.
Don't feel too bad. though — at
least you're not paying for it.
Well, it's been a delight as al
ways. Enjoy the long weekend and
whatever cuisine it may bring. 1
