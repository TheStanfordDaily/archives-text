# Law prof boosts clinical education
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Many professors cover the walls
of their offices with floor-to-ceiling
bookshelves packed with academic
journals and books. But in Larry
Marshall's office at the Law
School, the walls are covered by
framed newspaper articles from
the Chicago Tribune, a courtroom
sketch and a poster that reads, "74
innocent men sentenced to death
row. Come meet them."
Marshall, a visiting professor at
Stanford and director of clinical
education at the Law School, is
known for his work at Northwest
ern Law School's Center for
Wrongful Convictions. His work at
that center has helped exonerate
nine death row inmates on claims
of factual innocence and led to Illi
nois Gov. George Ryan's decision
to commute the death sentences of
167 men on the state is death row in
2002.
But Marshall did not come to
Stanford with the specific goal of
starting a similar center in Califor
nia, a state that boasts a death-row
population of about 635, the
largest in the nation. Nor did the
Boston native come to escape Illi
nois' cold weather.
"I've come to Stanford because
it seems to me that Stanford is
primed fora great opportunity to
innovate in the area of clinical edu
cation in a way that makes a signif
icant impact on education both

here and nationally," Marshall
said.
Clinical education. Marshall ex
plained, began in the l%os as a
way to integrate the study and
practice of law. By offering clinics
on topics like wrongful convic
tions, law schools give their stu
dents the opportunity to work on
actual cases under the close super
vision of a professor. This kind of
clinical experience serves two ped
agogical goals — to help students
integrate academic knowledge into
practice and to expose students to
social justice work.
Stanford offers eight such clin
ics, ranging from a community law
clinic that works on housing and
employment in East Palo Alto to a
Supreme Court litigation clinic.
Seven years ago, however, the situ
ation at Stanford was quite differ
ent.
"Stanford was the only top law
school that didn't have a clinical
education program and had a repu
tation of being less than interested
in public interest law," said former
director of clinical education
David Mills, who took the reigns of
the program in 1997.
Both former Law School Dean
Kathleen Sullivan and current
Dean Larry Kramer have made
building the clinical education pro
gram at Stanford's Law School a
priority. Sullivan hired a group of
clinical faculty and secured Mar
shall's visit so that he could direct a
larger program.
"Clinical education is a crucially
important part of the education we
want to give our students," Kramer
said. "Because it helps them put
everything they are learning in
class into a fuller context in prac
tice and it helps give them a fuller
sense of how important law is to
people, particularly underserved
comrn unities."
Despite the strides Stanford has
made to expand its clinical educa
tion program in past years, Mills
said the program is still inferior
and under-funded compared to
programs at other top law schools.
"We're getting there, hut we're
still not there," he said.
This is where Marshall wants to
make his mark.
"We're hoping that with Larry
we will build the best clinical pro
gram in country," said Kramer. "It
won't be the biggest, that would go
to NYU or Georgetown, but we
hope to have the best quality pro
gram and the most well-integrated
program."
Marshall wants to integrate clin
ical education into mainstream
legal education so that it becomes a
central part of law schools nation
wide, starting at Stanford, as op
posed to simply an appendage. He
sees the role of clinical education
in law schools as ideally mirroring
the residency component of med
ical schools. Accordingly, he said
his "goal is that every graduate of
law school will have had a substan
tial clinical experience. It would be
a bold move for Stanford."
Marshall's commitment to clin
ical education grew out of his expe
rience at the Center for Wrongful
Convictions at Northwestern. As
he worked alongside students to
represent innocent men on death
row. he watched his students come
to realize firsthand the power that
lawyers have to make a positive
difference in the world.
The power of law became in
creasingly clear to Northwestern
graduate Steven Miller as he
worked in Marshall's clinic about
ten years ago. Beginning in the fall
of his freshman year. Miller
worked on the case of death-row

inmate Rolando Cruz. An article
detailing Cruz's exoneration now
hangs on Marshall's wall.
"Many students come into law
school wanting to make a differ
ence, but become jaded through
studying the law," he said. "They
begin to acquiesce, to think they
can't fight the system. But when
they see the entire state pitted
against one man and then watch
that man walk out of prison, they
realize the potential of their power
as lawyers."
The importance of learning this
lesson, which cannot be found in a
law book, cannot be underestimat
ed. Marshall said.
"Fora misperceived sense of
impotence is the biggest obstacle to
progress — whether it's in regard
to problems in the death penalty or
in East Palo Alto housing pro
jects."
Marshall does not expect all stu
dents to go into public interest law
after a clinical experience. But he
says he is most proud when former
students call him to say that they
are taking up pro bono criminal de
fense work, litigation for small
community businesses or other
public-interest projects. These stu
dents often tell him that such pro
jects are the most fulfilling parts of
their careers, because if they
hadn't done the work, they doubt
that anyone else would have taken
it up.
"Clinical education is a wonder
ful medicine for lawyers them
selves," Marshall said, after re
marking that lawyers surveyed as a
group notoriously report low satis
faction with their work. "Clinic ex
periences sow the seeds for stu
dents to find real fulfillment from
the law not just through intellectu
al challenges, but through reaching
out to help people."
Miller, the Northwestern grad
uate, agrees that clinical experi
ences help make for happy lawyers.
His experience working with Mar
shall motivated him to become a
federal prosecutor so that he could
prevent incidences of prosecutorial
misconduct and neglect like those
he saw in the Cruz case.
"Although I'm working hun
dreds more hours as a prosecutor
than I did in private practice, I'm so

much happier," Miller said from
his prosecutor's office in New York
City.
Marshall now appears to be at a
potential turning point in his ca
reer. The Law School administra
tion recently invited him to extend
his yearlong visit at Stanford into a
full faculty appointment to further
develop the clinical education pro
gram. He is deciding whether to
stay or to return to his work in Illi
nois at the Center for Wrongful
Convictions.
As he makes his decision, he is
taking a good look at his finger
prints — no, the police haven't
found them at a crime scene.
Fingerprints have a deeper sig
nificance for Marshall. He grew up
under the tutelage of a rabbi who
often wondered why God gave
people distinct fingerprints. His
idea was that "the world is full of
flaws and voids that need to be
plugged by different people, by dif
ferent fingerprints," explained
Marshall.
"Our mission, I believe, is to
find the distinct role we all play in
leaving our fingerprints," he con
tinued. "It is part of the Jewish idea
of Tikum Olam — to be partners
with God in repairing the flaws in
the world ... it is a prescription for
fulfillment in life, for happiness."
We each have 10 fingerprints,
however, and for Marshall that
means we have a number of areas
in life to make our mark — on our
families, communities, and profes
sions. Marshall is currently assess
ing whether to keep leaving his
prints on the Illinois death penalty
system or to leave new prints in
clinical education here at Stanford.
Sullivan said she is rooting for
Stanford.
"If we invented the perfect di
rector of clinical education from
scratch, we could not do better
than Larry Marshall," she said.
"He is a brilliant scholar and
teacher who also knows how to
touch the heart and soul of his
cases. Death row inmates across
Illinois have been spared by his
tireless efforts. We hope very much
he will stay on our faculty perma
nently after his visit this year."
