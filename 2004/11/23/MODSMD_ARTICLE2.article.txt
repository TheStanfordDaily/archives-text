# Law prof boosts clinical education
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Many professors cover the walls
of their offices with floor-to-ceiling
bookshelves packed with academic
journals and books. But in Larry
Marshall's office at the Law
School, the walls are covered by
framed newspaper articles from
the Chicago Tribune, a courtroom
sketch and a poster that reads, "74
innocent men sentenced to death
row. Come meet them."
Marshall, a visiting professor at
Stanford and director of clinical
education at the Law School, is
known for his work at Northwest
ern Law School's Center for
Wrongful Convictions. His work at
that center has helped exonerate
nine death row inmates on claims
of factual innocence and led to Illi
nois Gov. George Ryan's decision
to commute the death sentences of
167 men on the state is death row in
2002.
But Marshall did not come to
Stanford with the specific goal of
starting a similar center in Califor
nia, a state that boasts a death-row
population of about 635, the
largest in the nation. Nor did the
Boston native come to escape Illi
nois' cold weather.
"I've come to Stanford because
it seems to me that Stanford is
primed fora great opportunity to
innovate in the area of clinical edu
cation in a way that makes a signif
icant impact on education both

here and nationally," Marshall
said.
Clinical education. Marshall ex
plained, began in the l%os as a
way to integrate the study and
practice of law. By offering clinics
on topics like wrongful convic
tions, law schools give their stu
dents the opportunity to work on
actual cases under the close super
vision of a professor. This kind of
clinical experience serves two ped
agogical goals â€” to help students
integrate academic knowledge into
practice and to expose students to
social justice work.
Stanford offers eight such clin
ics, ranging from a community law
clinic that works on housing and
employment in East Palo Alto to a
Supreme Court litigation clinic.
Seven years ago, however, the situ
ation at Stanford was quite differ
ent.
"Stanford was the only top law
school that didn't have a clinical
education program and had a repu
tation of being less than interested
in public interest law," said former
director of clinical education
David Mills, who took the reigns of
the program in 1997.
Both former Law School Dean
Kathleen Sullivan and current
Dean Larry Kramer have made
building the clinical education pro
gram at Stanford's Law School a
priority. Sullivan hired a group of
