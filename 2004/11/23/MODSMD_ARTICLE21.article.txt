Hamania clarifies context of auote
in article on Arafat's deatn
I am grateful to The Daily for in
terviewing me for its generally bal
anced and well-written article "Stu
dents respond to Arafat's death"
(Nov. 18).
Before I am misunderstood I
wish, however, to clarify my posi
tion on two issues.
First, the author quotes me re
garding my belief that Hamas and
Islamic Jihad need to be brought
within the Palestinian leadership.
The quote is correct, but it is taken
out of a context that is crucial to un
derstanding my position and that of
many other Palestinians and Arabs

regarding the role of Hamas and Is
lamic Jihad in the Israeli-Palestini
an conflict.
Although I deplore and reject
Hamas and Islamic Jihad's cruel,
immoral and unjustifiable policy of
suicide bombing, I do think that
bringing them on board into the po
litical system and into a collective
leadership with secular Palestinian
groups such as Fateh would make it
much harder for the Islamists to
pursue suicide bombings. It would
also force them to re-think their ul
timate political goals, especially re
garding the future of Israeli-Pales
tinian relations. I do think that if
this occurs. Hamas will no longer be
able to play the role of the spoiler

and would have to accept more real
istic and constructive goals that are
consistent with the views of the vast
majority of Palestinians and Is
raelis. Similarly, it is my hope that
Ariel Sharon and the Likud party's
extreme, unjust, racist and violent
policies will he countered by the re
emergence of a strengthened Labor
government in Israel committed to
recognizing the inalienable Pales
tinian right to self-determination
and independence.
Second, while I admire many of
Yasser Arafat's achievements and
while I appreciated Arafat's incred
ible kindness to me on a personal
level. I think history will pass a
mixed verdict on the milestones set

during his leadership of the Pales
tinian cause, a point I made during
my interview but was not quoted on.
Like other leaders. Arafat com
mitted several mistakes. During his
latter years, first as the signatory to
the premature and incomprehen
sive Oslo Accords, and second as
the legitimately elected president of
a nonetheless undemocratic Pales
tinian Authority, he made the error
of ignoring the criticisms levelled at
him by key Palestinian intellectuals
and leaders such as the prolific and
highly respected Palestinian author,
the late Edward W. Said, and the
talented Palestinian legislator
Hanan Ashrawi.
Moreover, during his long vears

of struggle. Arafat should have pur
sued greater efforts to effectively
promote a mass, non-violent strug
gle for Palestinian rights that allied
itself with moderate Israelis and
sympathetic Americans on the left
of the political spectrum.
Despite these shortcomings,
Arafat's role as the father of the
Palestinian struggle must be ac
knowledged and remembered. Any
judgment of his legacy must recog
nize the fact that the Palestinian
movement, unlike other move
ments of national liberation and
human rights, had to make do with
what little was available in the be
ginning and had to confront what
seemed like a litanv of vast and im

movable roadblocks.
The Palestinians are. as Edward
Said used to say. the tragic and mis
understood "victims of the victims."
As such. Arafat and the Palestinian
nation he represented had to spend
many years struggling to get a place
at the table.
Now we do have a place at the
table and.in many ways, Yasser
Arafat's single-minded and ener
getic devotion to the cause is re
sponsible for this achievement, de
spite his well-known eccentricities,
deficiencies and mistakes.
