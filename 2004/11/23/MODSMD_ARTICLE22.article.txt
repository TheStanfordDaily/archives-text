## 
### NAOMI MIYAKE DAILY ILLINI (U. ILLINOIS 
(U-WIRE) CHAMPAIGN, 111. -
Instead ol humming on the couch,
watching television or playing
video games after school, some Ur
hana Middle School students are
preparing for college.
The National Society of Collegiate
Scholars (NSCS) at the University
of Illinois, honors organization
with 205 college chapters across
the country, organized a program.
Planning for College Success
(PFCS), to help middle school stu
dents get ready for their college ex
perience. PFCS, which had its first
of four sessions of this semester in
October, is being implemented at
various middle schools in the Unit
ed States.
The members mentor middle
school students to help them with
deciding what they might want to
major in, what dorm life is like,
study skills and issues with moving
away from home.
The NSCS president, Anna Da
diomov, hopes the program will

make college appealing to stu
dents.
"The goal is (to) get students to de
sire to go to college, no matter
what obstacles they may face," Da
diomov said. "Also (to get kids) to
develop interest in college way be
forehand and.in turn, try to do well
in high school."
The sessions include games, one
on-one mentoring sessions and
snacks to make the program fun as
well as educational.
Last Friday's activity involved a
guessing game where kids drew a
picture of what they want to be
when they grow up while other stu
dents try to guess.
Carson Lewis, 13, said the game
was his favorite part of the day.
"1 drew handcuffs because I want
to be a cop," he said.
Arielle Bennett, 12, said the best
part was talking to the mentors.
"You can tell them what you want
to do when you grow up, and it's
just fun," Bennett said.
Dadiomov said in the very begin
ning, it's a challenge to get the kids
to talk.
"At first they are shy, but then they

open up once they can feel that the
mentor really is interested in them
and their lives," she said.
Lewis expressed his interest in
math and science to Robert
Griegoliet, sophomore in NSCS,
during their session.
"I talked to him about how math
and science filters into engineer
ing, but if he has a lot of other in
terests, he should consider them all
and not just pinpoint down to one
thing right away," Griegoliet said.
Aside from academics, mentors
and students talk about the social
aspects of college like making new
friends, living in the dorms and get
ting involved in student organiza
tions on campus.
"It's kind of like big brother meets
school counselor," said Griegoliet.
"It's preparing them on a social
and academic level, which gives
them a spectrum of college life."
Not only does the program benefit
students, but it is gratifying for the
mentors as well.
"It's rewarding to see how these
kids really appreciate someone
that is there to answer their ques
tions which may not ordinarily be

discussed in their own home," Da
diomov said.
Griegoliet also enjoys connecting
with the students.
"I like seeing kids that are kind of
in the same place I was,"he said.
"They have a lot of interest like I
had when I was their age, so it's in
teresting to see where I was at their
point in time."
Though the main focus is on col
lege-related issues, mentors and
students enjoy talking about their
favorite TV shows, sharing stories
and laughing over pop and cookies.
Future plans include taking the stu
dents to various places on the Uni
versity campus such as the Illini
Union, various lecture halls, the
Krannert Center for the Perform
ing Arts, the ice arena and the
Union bowling alley.
Dadiomov hopes the program is
successful.
"I want to have the satisfaction that
I was able to prepare these kids in
some way for what is to come in the
future and spark interest in them to
continue their education," Da
diomov said.
