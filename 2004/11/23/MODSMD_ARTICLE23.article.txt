# Pets make good roommates for some George Washington U. students
## 
### CASEY POND THE GW HATCHET (GEORGE WASHINGTON U 
(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON - In
dorm life, roommates can be a
source of social anguish or cost stu
dents valuable study time.
But for some George Washington
University students, different
kinds of roommates — pets — pro
vide relaxation and are constant
sources of support.
One City Hall resident said she is
comforted by the very manageable
fish she keeps in her room, though
she chooses to ignore GW rules
against having pets in residence
hall rooms. A 20-gallon tank in the
student s bedroom, which houses
two catfish and other fishes, is clut
tered with algae that give the
aquarium a green hue. The fish are
named after reality show charac
ters such as "Jacquese," from
MTV's "Real World," and
Omarosa, of "The Apprentice"
fame.
"1 missed being around animals,
and I had always grown up with an
imals, so it didn't feel right to be
living somewhere and not have a
pet." said the student.
"If the room was available, I'd
have as many pets as space would
allow." she added. "But it's just not
possible when you live in a double
in HOVA or even a triple in City
Hall."
One student said she and her
roommates kept a cat in their quad
last year.
"It was a kitten when we got it. so it
was small and easy to manage, and
it seemed like it would be some
thing exciting, and something we
all had together, a room pet," said
the student, who asked to remain
anonymous to avert questioning by
GW officials.
Keeping another living creature
can pose its problems, but the stu
dent said her cat never caused any
difficulties.
"I mean, we considered the conse
quences, but we really didn't think
anything would happen, and
throughout the year we never had
a single problem." she said. "It was
a cat, so it didn't have to go outside
much, but when it did we would
just take it inside and outside in a
small carrier. It was never a big
deal."
The former fish owner said she
considered the responsibilities of
having a pet. Before buying her
newest pet. she was worried about

the university's finding out about
the animal. GW policy states that
students cannot keep pets in their
residence halls.
"If (Student Judicial Services)
learned that a student had a pet in
his room. SJS would direct the stu
dent to remove it," SJS Director
Tara Woolfson said. "If the student
failed to comply with this directive,
he would be charged with non
compliance and receive an appro
priate sanction." SJS does not com
ment about specific sanctions,
which are doled out on a case-by
case basis.
Having pets in residence halls
poses a threat to students' health
and safety, possibly making rooms
unsanitary and aggravating the al
lergies of other residents, Woolf
son said.
"Allowing pets in the residence
halls would significantly increase
the cost of maintenance by further
ing the pace of normal deprecia
tion and by creating more in
stances when special maintenance
is required," she added.
But officials at Stephens College in
Missouri said they have experi
enced no severe maintenance
problems in an experimental pro
ject that allows students and pets to
coexist in one dormitory.
"Stephens strives as a student-cen
tered college to meet the needs and
wants of our students," said Deb
Duren, vice president for Student
Services at Stephens. "One of the
main reasons students provide for
moving off campus is that pets are
not allowed in on-campus living
environments."
Duren added that as far as she
knows, the Missouri college is one
of only a few in the country that
allow students to bring pets to
school with them. Despite threats
of sanctions and room inspections,
the fish-owning student reported
no problems evading GW's no-pet
policy last year.
"I thought I was going to have to
come up with some elaborate plan
to get a 20-gallon tank through the
door and past the security guard,
but I just walked right on in and no
one said anything," she said. "I re
ally wasn't worried about the con
sequences."
She added that even her communi
ty facilitator was supportive of the
pet.
"At the end of the year," she said.
"I used her car to move my fish
tank to another location."
