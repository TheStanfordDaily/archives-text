# Founder of U. Arizona gay frat wants it to be revived
## 
### JENNIFER AMSLER ARIZONA DAILY WILDCAT (U. ARIZONA 
(U-WIRE) TUCSON. Ariz. - The
founder of the first gay fraternity
at the University of Arizona en
couraged gay students Friday to
bring it back to help unify the gay
student population.
Dominick DeCarlo said creating a
Delta Lambda Phi chapter was the
most controversial thing to happen
at the UA during the early '90s.
He began the fraternity in 1990 but
it stopped operating in 1993, just
one year after DeCarlo graduated.
Although the UA Delta Lambda
Phi chapter stopped operating
more than a decade ago. DeCarlo
encouraged gay men at the U A Fri
day to start it up again. About 10
men attended DeCarlo's speech,
and some expressed interest in
doing that.
"I would love to see it back," De-
Carlo said. "It was about learning
about yourself and giving thanks to
the older generation that paved the
way for us."
DeCarlo stressed the need fora
gay fraternity because many gay
men want a fraternal experience,
but often times feel the need to act
the part of a heterosexual.
Some men at the gathering Friday
agreed the reason they did not join
fraternities was because they
didn't want to feel pressure to "fit
that mold."
DeCarlo said he started the chap
ter after he was kicked out of
Kappa Sigma Fraternity in 1990
two weeks prior to initiation be
cause he was at a local gay bar.
DeCarlo, an openly gay student
when he joined the fraternity, said
a rule in Kappa Sigma stated that
members weren't allowed to wear
their pins while they were drink
ing. DeCarlo, however, said he
wasn't drinking and believes the
reason for his dismissal was be
cause he was gay.
"I had the highest GPA of any
pledge. I kept probing them for an
swers, and I never really got one."
he said.
Undaunted by the incident, De-
Carlo still wanted a fraternal expe
rience so he started UA's first gay
fraternity shortly after the inci
dent.
Ten percent of the population is
gay, but 30 percent of men in fra
ternities are gay, DeCarlo said. He
said the reason for this is fraterni

ties are a good way to bond and be
around other men.
He said when he attended the UA
from 1990 to 1992, many fraternity
men were gay and he even dated a
few of them, including the then
president of Pi Kappa Alpha.
"There was a lot of us floating
around the fraternal community,"
DeCarlo said.
DeCarlo said he had to overcome
the stereotypes of creating a gay
fraternity because many people
thought it was just an attempt to
create a dating circle.
Eventually, people came around to
accepting the fraternity and even
received a standing ovation from
fraternity and sorority presidents
when he formally addressed them
during a panel that Delta Lambda
Phi had been approved fora char
ter.
DeCarlo said the members of the
fraternity had a great experience
and got along well with all of the
sororities, especially when they
went to serenade the women to
Madonna's "Express Yourself."
"One of the lines was, 'You don't
have to worry about pregnancy
tests with us,"' he said.
DeCarlo also stressed the impor
tance of uniting the gay communi
ty on campus with the rest of the
students. He said bringing back
Delta Lambda Phi would help ac
complish that.
Pepper Mache, an entertainer who
sang the theme song to "Queer as
Folk," a television show about gay
men, said she and DeCarlo are
working together to begin a talk
show that targets the lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgendered com
munity.
"It would be a showcase for tal
ent," she said.
Mache said there are many LGBT
individuals who are talented enter
tainers but don't have the opportu
nity to be seen or heard because
their sexual orientation is not
mainstream.
Ben Rieck, a finance senior, is a
member of Campus Crusades for
Christ and said he sees a barrier be
tween the Christian community
and the gay community. Although
Rieck is heterosexual, he said has
been working with Pride Alliance,
a group that fosters a safe and edu
cational environment for LGBT
individuals, to break down that
barrier.
"It's been an overwhelmingly posi
tive experience." Rieck said.

doing that.
"I would love to see it back," De-
Carlo said. "It was about learning
about yourself and giving thanks to
the older generation that paved the
way for us."
DeCarlo stressed the need fora
gay fraternity because many gay
men want a fraternal experience,
but often times feel the need to act
the part of a heterosexual.
Some men at the gathering Friday
agreed the reason they did not join
fraternities was because they
didn't want to feel pressure to "fit
that mold."
DeCarlo said he started the chap
ter after he was kicked out of
Kappa Sigma Fraternity in 1990
two weeks prior to initiation be
cause he was at a local gay bar.
DeCarlo, an openly gay student
when he joined the fraternity, said
a rule in Kappa Sigma stated that
members weren't allowed to wear
their pins while they were drink
ing. DeCarlo, however, said he
wasn't drinking and believes the
reason for his dismissal was be
cause he was gay.
"I had the highest GPA of any
pledge. I kept probing them for an
swers, and I never really got one."
he said.
Undaunted by the incident, De-
Carlo still wanted a fraternal expe
rience so he started UA's first gay
fraternity shortly after the inci
dent.
Ten percent of the population is
gay, but 30 percent of men in fra
ternities are gay, DeCarlo said. He
said the reason for this is fraterni

ties are a good way to bond and be
around other men.
He said when he attended the UA
from 1990 to 1992, many fraternity
men were gay and he even dated a
few of them, including the then
president of Pi Kappa Alpha.
"There was a lot of us floating
around the fraternal community,"
DeCarlo said.
DeCarlo said he had to overcome
the stereotypes of creating a gay
fraternity because many people
thought it was just an attempt to
create a dating circle.
Eventually, people came around to
accepting the fraternity and even
received a standing ovation from
fraternity and sorority presidents
when he formally addressed them
during a panel that Delta Lambda
Phi had been approved fora char
ter.
DeCarlo said the members of the
fraternity had a great experience
and got along well with all of the
sororities, especially when they
went to serenade the women to
Madonna's "Express Yourself."
"One of the lines was, 'You don't
have to worry about pregnancy
tests with us,"' he said.
DeCarlo also stressed the impor
tance of uniting the gay communi
ty on campus with the rest of the
students. He said bringing back
Delta Lambda Phi would help ac
complish that.
Pepper Mache, an entertainer who
sang the theme song to "Queer as
Folk," a television show about gay
men, said she and DeCarlo are
working together to begin a talk
show that targets the lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgendered com
munity.
"It would be a showcase for tal
ent," she said.
Mache said there are many LGBT
individuals who are talented enter
tainers but don't have the opportu
nity to be seen or heard because
their sexual orientation is not
mainstream.
Ben Rieck, a finance senior, is a
member of Campus Crusades for
Christ and said he sees a barrier be
tween the Christian community
and the gay community. Although
Rieck is heterosexual, he said has
been working with Pride Alliance,
a group that fosters a safe and edu
cational environment for LGBT
individuals, to break down that
barrier.
"It's been an overwhelmingly posi
tive experience." Rieck said.
