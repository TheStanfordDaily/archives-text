## Swimmers win Speedo Cup by over 500 points 
### SAMUEL CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Skeptics have had their reasons to
question the strength of the No. 4 Car
dinal swim team, which is coming off of
an unconvincing non-team scoring meet
with co-No. 4 California and a rather
meaningless dominating performance
over the Division II Cal State-Bakers
field Roadrunners.
"There are not many expectations
for this team [from others] on the na
tional level," said senior co-captain
Jayme Cramer. "People have been say
ing we are done after the people we
graduated last year. That adds fuel to
our fire."
At the three-day 2004 UC-Irvine
Speedo Cup at the Belmont Plaza
Olympic Pool in Long Beach, Calif., the
Cardinal swimmers finally showed that
competitive fire and provided answers
to some of the questions. Stanford won
the 13-squad invitational with 1,595

total points, making the only close race
the one for second between UC-San
Diego and No. 22 Brigham Young.
UCSD narrowly won that duel, finish
ing with 1049.5 points compared to 1046
for BYU.
Air Force finished fourth with 796.5
points and host UC-Irvine rounded out
the top five with 680 points.
Sophomore Hongzhe Sun, winner
of two individual events and a member
of winning relays, was named Swim
mer of the Meet at the conclusion of
the competition.
Despite what were obviously strong
individual performances by many Stan
ford swimmers, the Cardinal were fo
cused on the performance of the team
as a whole.
"Our individual roles as part of the
collective unit were strengthened this
weekend," Cramer said.
The Stanford men started off the
competition in impressive fashion,
taking first place in the 200-yard
freestyle relay with a time of
1:21.49. holding off BYU and host
Irvine, who finished with times of
1:22.76 and 1:24.80. respectively.
The Cardinal team went on to fin
ish with the top times in all but one
event in each of the three days of
competition.
Following the 500 freestyle
event, where Cramer and sopho
more Shaun Phillips finished third
and fourth, respectively. Sun led
the group of Cardinal swimmers to
take three of the top four finishes
of the 200 individual medley,
touching the wall at 1:47.29. Two
juniors followed the standout
sophomore, as Tobias Oriwol
clocked a 1:49.90 to finish third and
Mark Stephens finished fourth
with a time of 1:50.30.
The first day concluded with
two more Stanford victories, as
sophomore Ben Wildman-To
briner won the final in the 50 free at
20.27 and Stanford prevailed in the
400 medley relay, clocking a time
of 3:17.71, more than four seconds
ahead of its nearest competitor,
UCSD.
At the end of the day. Stanford
had already amassed 492 points,
with the next four of the top five
collecting total scores ranging from
218 by Irvine to 283 by BYU.
In the second day of competi
tion, Stanford extended its domi
nance. emphatically winning six
of the seven events of the day.
In the first event of the day, the
200 medley relay, Stanford beat
out BYU and Irvine, finishing at

Stanford continued its domi
nance as Oriwol and Stephens fin
ished 1-2 in the 400 IM, clocking
3:53.47 and 3:55.05, respectively.
In the 1(X) butterfly, the Cardi
nal failed to win their first event of
the day, as UCSD senior Kurt
Boehm edged Stanford senior co
captain Matt McDonald in a close
race 48.64 to 48.90.
The next event was redeeming,
however, as sophomore Andy

Grant, junior Michael McLean,
freshman Daniel Beal and sopho
more Kyle Ransom swept the top
four positions in the 200 free event.
Grant led the field with a 1:37.75.
The top two spots in the next

mate Gary Marshall to win the
event, finishing at 55.75, with Mar
shall touching the wall a quarter
second behind. In the 100 back. Sun
put together another strong perfor
mance, teaming with Cramer to fin
ish on top, with times of 47.72 and
47.88, respectively.
Another successful day con
cluded with Stanford's win of the
800 freestyle relay, as the Cardinal
finished at 6:37.53, winning by
more than six seconds.
Going into the third and final
day of competition, Stanford led by
more than 400 points and cruised to
wins in all events in which it partic
ipated. taking at least two of the top
three positions in five of the six
events.
In the first event, Phillips won
the 1650 distance freestyle event,
finishing at 15:14.57.

som took the top two spots, clocking

other event the Cardinal swept —
senior Gary Marshall touched the
wall first, finishing with a time of
2:01.90. with junior Nick Wolfe and
Stephens also turning in impressive
times to take the second and third
spots.
In the final event that the Cardi
nal swam, McDonald and Marshall
finished 1-2 in the 200 butterfly,
clocking times of 1:48.15 and
1:48.57. respectively. The Cardinal
did not swim in the 400 freestyle
relay.
Team leader Javme Cramer
notes that the result of this meet
may be a glimpse of what is to
come. With their next meet com
ing when the Cardinal hosts
Michigan on January 7, Cramer
said, "As long as we continue to
improve and grow in confidence,
this team will surprise a lot of peo
ple around the country."

l"he Cardinal men dominated the competition all weekend, going 1-2
n several events and taking three of the top three spots in the 200 IM.
Skeptics have had their reasons to
question the strength of the No. 4 Car
dinal swim team, which is coming off of
an unconvincing non-team scoring meet
with co-No. 4 California and a rather
meaningless dominating performance
over the Division II Cal State-Bakers
field Roadrunners.
"There are not many expectations
for this team [from others] on the na
tional level," said senior co-captain
Jayme Cramer. "People have been say
ing we are done after the people we
graduated last year. That adds fuel to
our fire."
At the three-day 2004 UC-Irvine
Speedo Cup at the Belmont Plaza
Olympic Pool in Long Beach, Calif., the
Cardinal swimmers finally showed that
competitive fire and provided answers
to some of the questions. Stanford won
the 13-squad invitational with 1,595

total points, making the only close race
the one for second between UC-San
Diego and No. 22 Brigham Young.
UCSD narrowly won that duel, finish
ing with 1049.5 points compared to 1046
for BYU.
Air Force finished fourth with 796.5
points and host UC-Irvine rounded out
the top five with 680 points.
Sophomore Hongzhe Sun, winner
of two individual events and a member
of winning relays, was named Swim
mer of the Meet at the conclusion of
the competition.
Despite what were obviously strong
individual performances by many Stan
ford swimmers, the Cardinal were fo
cused on the performance of the team
as a whole.
"Our individual roles as part of the
collective unit were strengthened this
weekend," Cramer said.
The Stanford men started off the
competition in impressive fashion,
taking first place in the 200-yard
freestyle relay with a time of
1:21.49. holding off BYU and host
Irvine, who finished with times of
1:22.76 and 1:24.80. respectively.
The Cardinal team went on to fin
ish with the top times in all but one
event in each of the three days of
competition.
Following the 500 freestyle
event, where Cramer and sopho
more Shaun Phillips finished third
and fourth, respectively. Sun led
the group of Cardinal swimmers to
take three of the top four finishes
of the 200 individual medley,
touching the wall at 1:47.29. Two
juniors followed the standout
sophomore, as Tobias Oriwol
clocked a 1:49.90 to finish third and
Mark Stephens finished fourth
with a time of 1:50.30.
The first day concluded with
two more Stanford victories, as
sophomore Ben Wildman-To
briner won the final in the 50 free at
20.27 and Stanford prevailed in the
400 medley relay, clocking a time
of 3:17.71, more than four seconds
ahead of its nearest competitor,
UCSD.
At the end of the day. Stanford
had already amassed 492 points,
with the next four of the top five
collecting total scores ranging from
218 by Irvine to 283 by BYU.
In the second day of competi
tion, Stanford extended its domi
nance. emphatically winning six
of the seven events of the day.
In the first event of the day, the
200 medley relay, Stanford beat
out BYU and Irvine, finishing at
1:29.53.
Stanford continued its domi
nance as Oriwol and Stephens fin
ished 1-2 in the 400 IM, clocking
3:53.47 and 3:55.05, respectively.
