The first games of the season for any
sports team are important. They set the
tone for the year, get the competitive juices
flowing, and sometimes, most importantly,
highlight weaknesses the team must work
on.
But if highlighting weaknesses was the
Cardinal's goal in their game against Pacif
ic, they failed. If starting their season with
the type of bang that shouldn't even be legal
was their goal, they were successful.
The Cardinal (2-0) trounced Pacific (1 -1)
by a score of 82-26. Stanford allowed its
third-lowest point total in school history.
Going into Sunday's matchup at Santa
Clara, Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer
had made clear that playing time on such a
deeply talented team would be determined
by defensive intensity. After the Pacific
game, it seems as though everyone is going
to play.
Stanford forced 18 steals — including a
game-high five steals from freshman Cissy
Pierce — and caused 27 turnovers.
"We worked very hard defensively,"
VanDerveer said. "We're doing some new

things and we're doing them really well."
On the offensive end, Candice Wiggins
led the scoring charge with 15 points. All 13
Cardinal players on the roster scored in the
Stanford rout.
The victory over Pacific marked the sixth
straight time the Cardinal have won in the
series, including a 61-point win the last time
the teams met.
Stanford was without fifth-year senior
guard Susan King Borchardt, who is out
with a stress fracture to her left foot. Even
without her, the Cardinal did not allow a
single Tiger player to score more than five
points, and held Pacific to an abysmally low
seven points in the first half.
Stanford really showed off its collective
defensive presence fora stretch of almost
eight minutes in the second half during
which the team held the Tigers scoreless.
The Cardinal stretched their lead to 57-11
during that time.
"We're a young team, and this is a les
son we must learn," Pacific coach Craig
Jackson said. "They were just so much
more physical than we were. For us it's
about getting better."

Sophomore center Kristen Newlin contributed
seven points, two blocks and a steal in the Cardi
nal's victory over Pacific last night.
Pacific could not manage to score
a single field goal for the final 11
minutes of the half, making only 3-
of-20 shots before halftime to trail
36-7 at the break.
"The good thing about our team
is we have an all-around game,"
Wiggins said. "You can try to close
one thing, but it's not just one thing
we are doing. We kind of do every
thing."
In blowing out their opponent,
the Cardinal managed to play every
player on their roster, including the
four freshmen.
Guard / forward Jessica Elwav

converted 1 -of-2 field goal attempts
and hit 2-of-3 free throws to con
tribute four points for Stanford.
Cissy Pierce led the defensive
charge with five steals and three re
bounds.
Christy Tichenal played 16 valu
able minutes, contributing both on
the offensive and defensive ends
with two points, a rebound and a
blocked shot.
Standout freshman guard Can
dice Wiggins headlined the fresh
man performances by scoring 15
points on 6-of-l I shooting. She also
added two steals and a blocked shot

on the defensive end.
The Cardinal will ride the waves
of this win into a matchup with
Eastern Washington on Tuesday
night in their first game of the
Alaska Shootout tournament. If
the Cardinal win, they will go on to
face the winner of Alaska and
ULL.
After the Alaska Shootout, Stan
ford will head into the meatier part
of its schedule with a game against
nationally ranked Texas Tech and
the first-ever game at the new
Maples Pavilion against a talented
Pepperdine team.
