## The
						emotions of a sports fan: elation, sorrow ... shame? 
### 
I was proud to he a Stanford fan until the
opening drive of the third quarter of Big
Game, when Stanford gave away 35 yards
on a false start and two personal fouls for late
hits, allowing Cal to get a field goal and break
the game open.
Penalties happen. Tempers flare in rivalry
games. Frustration mounts when you play
hard all season and results don't follow. But
there is no excuse for the ugliness on the field
in the second half of Big

Game.
I wasn't on the field. I
don't know if these were re
taliatory attacks for prior ag
gressions. All I know is that
Stanford gave away the
game with those senseless
fouls on the game-changing
drive in the third quarter.
And Stanford gave up its
dignity with the series of

cheap shots as the game wound down.
I never thought I'd say this, but by the end
of the game I was ashamed to have my face
painted red and white. I can imagine being on
the other sideline, watching my superior team
be subjected to injurious dirty hits, and losing
respect for both the opposing team and the
fans that support them.
Cal fans are not perfect. The long walk
back to the buses down Fraternity Row re
minded me of that. But I would have expected
more from Stanford. In all. Big Game was a
fitting cap to a pretty miserable sports week.
Being a sports fan carries with it the poten
tial for both immense joy and disappointment.
There's the thrill of watching the players you
emulate succeed against bitter rivals. There's
the dejection that accompanies painful losses.
And this week I have just discovered a
third emotion â€” shame. Not shame at out
comes, but shame at the way the team I sup
port and the fans I identify with act on the
field.
Friday night my hometown Detroit Pistons
defended their NBA championship against
the Indiana Pacers. A brawl broke out with 45
seconds remaining featuring scary scenes of
players fighting fans in the seats and fans rush
ing the court to attack players. The league sus
pended nine players for more than 140 games,
including Ron Artest, who was banished for
the remainder of the season, and Jermaine
O'Neal and Stephen Jackson, who will sit out
for 25 and 30 games respectively.
There has been a lot of commentary since
the incident analyzing the emotional wall that
separates players and fans, and examining
how the physical wall was so easily broken.
My perspective is that the athletes have re
ceived their sanctions, but we Detroit fans
have nothing but our shame to show for the
lack of decency shown at the Palace.
I am not one of the miserable few who
threw beer and instigated the riot. I didn't
even see the altercation until the 11 p.m.
Sports Center. But by virtue of supporting the
team I put myself in the same vein as the of
fending group that showed no restraint and
heartlessly showered the athletes with trash
even as they were leaving the court.
The awful week started on Wednesday
night when Spain hosted England in an inter
national friendly, the country's 500 th interna
tional match. What was supposed to be a
harmless tune-up for the 2006 World Cup
qualifiers turned hideous when Spanish sup-
