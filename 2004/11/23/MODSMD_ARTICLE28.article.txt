# UNHAPPY ENDING FOR CARD
## Top-ranked women finish fifth, No. 3 men pick up sixth place at NCAA Championship 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford cross country wins are usually
dominating. Often predictable. So com
mon that you expect them long before they
hit the pages of the record books.
Yesterday, the two Cardinal squads re
turned home from the NCAA Champi
onships in Terre Haute, Ind. without a win
between them. Without any individual ti
tles. Even without a top-three team finish.
Both Stanford teams were fresh off of
Pacific-10 Conference team crowns and
not only West Regional team titles, but
double individual wins as well. The men
were two-time defending NCAA champi
ons, and the women were looking to de
fend their 2003 championship as well.
But despite the momentum going into
yesterday's meet, the Cardinal just weren't
able to execute their game plan when it
came down to go-time: the Stanford men
placed sixth and the women finished fifth.
Because of steady rains Sunday and
early yesterday morning, the runners com
peted on a muddy LaVern Gibson Cham
pionship Cross Country Course. The top
ranked Stanford women ran in the 6.000
meter race around 11 a.m. EST yesterday,
and the No. 3 Cardinal men competed in
the 10,000 meter race shortly afterwards at
12:15 p.m..
In 2003, Stanford had sweeping victo
ries in both the men's and the women's di
visions. This year, that same glory be
longed to Colorado. While the Buffalo
men were ranked fourth and the women
were voted third in the most recent polls,
they came out and won decisive victories.
The Buffalo men finished with 90
points, and while the margin of victory was
nowhere near Stanford's 150-point margin
in 2003, it was enough to edge out runner
up Wisconsin by four points. The Col
orado women finished with a low 63
points, 81 under second-place Duke.

This was Buffaloes' second-ever
NCAA Division I Championship in cross
country. The men placed three runners in
the top 25, including fourth-place finisher
Brett Vaughn and Bret Schoolmeester in
fifth. The Colorado women finished strong

with three top 10 finishers, and five in the
top 25.
Simon Bairu of top-ranked Wisconsin
captured the men's individual title with a
time of 30 minutes and 37.7 seconds. Last
year's NCAA runner-up, Kim Smith of

second-ranked Providence finished in first
place with a time of 20:08.50, almost 18 sec
onds ahead of second-place finisher Renee
Metevier of Colorado. Going into the race.
