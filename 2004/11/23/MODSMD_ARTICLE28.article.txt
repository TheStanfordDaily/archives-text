# UNHAPPY ENDING FOR CARD
## Top-ranked women finish fifth, No. 3 men pick up sixth place at NCAA Championship 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford cross country wins are usually
dominating. Often predictable. So com
mon that you expect them long before they
hit the pages of the record books.
Yesterday, the two Cardinal squads re
turned home from the NCAA Champi
onships in Terre Haute, Ind. without a win
between them. Without any individual ti
tles. Even without a top-three team finish.
Both Stanford teams were fresh off of
Pacific-10 Conference team crowns and
not only West Regional team titles, but
double individual wins as well. The men
were two-time defending NCAA champi
ons, and the women were looking to de
fend their 2003 championship as well.
But despite the momentum going into
yesterday's meet, the Cardinal just weren't
able to execute their game plan when it
came down to go-time: the Stanford men
placed sixth and the women finished fifth.
Because of steady rains Sunday and
early yesterday morning, the runners com
peted on a muddy LaVern Gibson Cham
pionship Cross Country Course. The top
ranked Stanford women ran in the 6.000
meter race around 11 a.m. EST yesterday,
and the No. 3 Cardinal men competed in
the 10,000 meter race shortly afterwards at
12:15 p.m..
In 2003, Stanford had sweeping victo
ries in both the men's and the women's di
visions. This year, that same glory be
longed to Colorado. While the Buffalo
men were ranked fourth and the women
were voted third in the most recent polls,
they came out and won decisive victories.
The Buffalo men finished with 90
points, and while the margin of victory was
nowhere near Stanford's 150-point margin
in 2003, it was enough to edge out runner
up Wisconsin by four points. The Col
orado women finished with a low 63
points, 81 under second-place Duke.

This was Buffaloes' second-ever
NCAA Division I Championship in cross
country. The men placed three runners in
the top 25, including fourth-place finisher
Brett Vaughn and Bret Schoolmeester in
fifth. The Colorado women finished strong

with three top 10 finishers, and five in the
top 25.
Simon Bairu of top-ranked Wisconsin
captured the men's individual title with a
time of 30 minutes and 37.7 seconds. Last
year's NCAA runner-up, Kim Smith of

second-ranked Providence finished in first
place with a time of 20:08.50, almost 18 sec
onds ahead of second-place finisher Renee
Metevier of Colorado. Going into the race.

The Cardinal women's cross country team suffered a huge upset in Terre Haute, Ind. yesterday morning, finishing in fifth place and fail
ing to defend Stanford's 2003 championship title.
both runners had been undefeated,
but after today, only Smith finishes
the 2004 season having placed first in
every race.
The only Stanford runner to
break the top 25 was sophomore Nef
Araia, who finished eighth with a
time of 31:05. Senior Ryan Hall fin
ished the race in 31:35 and placed
26th. Senior Chris Emme and ju
niors Jon Pierce and Brett Gotcher
rounded out scoring for the Cardi
nal, arriving in 65th, 124 th and 138 th,
respectively. Senior David Vidal
and junior Peter Meindl also com
peted for the Cardinal, finishing in
33:38 and 33:45.
"[With] tough conditions like
today, you have to be at the top of
your game," men's head coach Andy
Gerard said in a press release.
"We're an inexperienced team and
that lack of experience really
showed today."
The Cardinal women's results
were only slightly better than the
men's. Senior Alicia Craig finished
26th, sophomore Teresa McWalters
placed 46th, and senior Anita Siraki
cross the finish line in 47th, only one
second after McWalters. Sopho
mores Katy and Amanda Trotter

finished 60th and 74th to complete
the scoring for the women. Senior
Jeane Goff and freshman Lauren
Centrowitz clocked in with times of
21:58 and 22:32.
Despite yesterday's surprising
finish, the Cardinal have had a
successful season overall in 2004.
Included in their team wins are
the NCAA West Regionals, the
Pac-10 Championships, and Pre-
Nationals.
Especially interesting to note
are the finishes of Craig and Hall
â€” in their final seasons, their simi
lar results have been uncanny.
Both finished first in Pre-Nationals
in October but then fell to second
place finishes at Golden Gate Park,
where Pac-lOs were held. Howev
er, at West Regionals, both
bounced back to come out victori
ous in their respective races. Yes
terday, both finished with unantici
pated 26th-place finishes.
"We didn't perform the way we
expected to," Craig admitted in a
press release. "Things didn't seem
together for us, but we're not dis
couraged. We just need to regain
focus and figure out what went
wrong today."
