# Wrestlers drop first dual meet 23-14 to Cal Fullerton
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The season's first dual meet proved to be
a tough test of youth while showcasing the
reemergence of a champion.
The Stanford wrestling team (0-1, 0-1 Pa
cific* 10 Conference) evened the score in its
Cal State-Fullerton (1-1, 1-1 Pac-10) dual
meet with four matches to go, only to drop
three of the final four weight classes and
eventually fall 23-14 at Titan Gym.
"The dual meet was frustrating," said
Stanford head coach Steve Buddie. "Howev
er, since it was the first one of the year, it was
also the very first dual meet for some of our
wrestlers in front of a big crowd, so it can be
a good stepping stone. If we learn something,
we can take the loss on the chin and move
on."
Stanford's first two victories came from
125-pound senior Nathan Peterson who
earned a 7-5 win, and 149-pound redshirt
freshman Josh Zupancic, who bested Titan
Jeff Silva in the tightest contest of the meet,
an 8-7 decision.
The Cardinal's returning national cham
pion. senior co-captain Matt Gentry, won his
first real match at 157 since earning the
NCAA crown. The 8-0 major decision

against Angelo Lago was especially signifi
cant because Gentry passed Buddie as the
winningest Cardinal wrestler of all time at
110 career wins. Gentry also continues to im
prove on his Stanford record for consecutive
wins without a loss, which now stands at 43.
A turning point in the meet was the match
between the squad's 174-pounders. Stanford
had just fallen behind Fullerton after fresh
man Scott Loescher lost a 7-3 decision to
Risto Marttinen at 165. Stanford junior Imad
Kharbush held the early lead against highly
regarded Leonel Sanchez, but Sanchez came
back to win the decision by a thin 8-6 margin.
"Some things didn't go our way," Buddie
said. "Down the stretch we needed a crucial
takedown and couldn't get it. All in all, I
think Fullerton out-wrestled us."
Once the Cardinal had dropped the ago
nizingly close match, they could not make up
the deficit. Fullerton's 184-pounder Jesse
Taylor put the meet out of reach with a 13-3
major decision over Stanford junior Mark
Egesdal.
The Cardinal closed out the dual meet
with a highlight, though. Stanford sopho
more lan Bork. a 197-pounder. had a domi
nating 17-3 win over Titan Charlie Walz.

The Stanford wrestling team took its first loss of the season to conference rival Cal State-
Fullerton, but several of the Cardinal avenged their individual losses at the California
Open the following day
"We weren't satisfied |with our perfor
mance]," said senior heavyweight Shawn Ritzen
thaler. "But we haven't peaked as a team, and
we're steadily improving. We need to come back
and wrestle tough and compete to the best of our
abilities."
The California Open on Saturday continued a
similar theme of underclassmen contributions
and dominance by Gentry. Gentry was the Car
dinal's sole tournament champion with a record
of 5-0. The impressive run included two pins and
two wins against Pac-10 opponents — the
Titan's Lago and Brian Stith of Arizona State.
"The tournament is great because we get to
preview West Coast wrestling," Buddie said.
The Cardinal also sent other wrestlers to the
podium, including redshirt sophomore Tanner
Gardner who competed unattached and placed

second in the 125-pound weight class.
"I think we did a pretty good job bouncing
back after the Fullerton loss," Ritzenthaler said.
"We sent people to the podium, and even those
who did not place won matches. I'm excited
about wrestling as the season progresses."
The youth movement continued for the Car
dinal as Zupancic got fourth and true freshman
Rafael Chavez took third place and retribution.
"I think it was great that Rafael Chavez, a
true freshman was able to avenge his loss in the
dual meet and win against a Fullerton wrestler,"
Buddie said.
Next up for the Cardinal is Division II oppo
nent San Francisco State (0-0), which visits
Burnham Pavilion tonight at 7 p.m.
"We expect to win our matches," Buddie said.
"Tomorrow is no exception. [San Francisco

State is] on the young side, but they're very well
coached and we can never take them lightly."
Ritzenthaler added, "The home opener is im
portant. We want to keep the support of our fans
because we're very appreciative of them. We
want to show them exciting wrestling. We want
to start picking up momentum in this little mini
season we have before we come back for the
main season."
After the match tonight, the Cardinal do not
wrestle again until Dec. 19 fora tournament in
Reno. Nev. This break will help heal some nag
ging injuries from fatigue like sore knees and
shoulders. But, the break will not dampen the
enthusiasm.
"I'm really proud of the excitement in the
team," Ritzenthaler said. "We want to improve
on our great season last year."

team," Ritzenthaler said. "We want to improve
on our great season last year."

Gentry rolls to 5-0 record at
Saturday's California Open
The season's first dual meet proved to be
a tough test of youth while showcasing the
reemergence of a champion.
The Stanford wrestling team (0-1, 0-1 Pa
cific* 10 Conference) evened the score in its
Cal State-Fullerton (1-1, 1-1 Pac-10) dual
meet with four matches to go, only to drop
three of the final four weight classes and
eventually fall 23-14 at Titan Gym.
"The dual meet was frustrating," said
Stanford head coach Steve Buddie. "Howev
er, since it was the first one of the year, it was
also the very first dual meet for some of our
wrestlers in front of a big crowd, so it can be
a good stepping stone. If we learn something,
we can take the loss on the chin and move
on."
Stanford's first two victories came from
125-pound senior Nathan Peterson who
earned a 7-5 win, and 149-pound redshirt
freshman Josh Zupancic, who bested Titan
Jeff Silva in the tightest contest of the meet,
an 8-7 decision.
The Cardinal's returning national cham
pion. senior co-captain Matt Gentry, won his
first real match at 157 since earning the
NCAA crown. The 8-0 major decision

against Angelo Lago was especially signifi
cant because Gentry passed Buddie as the
winningest Cardinal wrestler of all time at
110 career wins. Gentry also continues to im
prove on his Stanford record for consecutive
wins without a loss, which now stands at 43.
A turning point in the meet was the match
between the squad's 174-pounders. Stanford
had just fallen behind Fullerton after fresh
man Scott Loescher lost a 7-3 decision to
Risto Marttinen at 165. Stanford junior Imad
Kharbush held the early lead against highly
regarded Leonel Sanchez, but Sanchez came
back to win the decision by a thin 8-6 margin.
"Some things didn't go our way," Buddie
said. "Down the stretch we needed a crucial
takedown and couldn't get it. All in all, I
think Fullerton out-wrestled us."
Once the Cardinal had dropped the ago
nizingly close match, they could not make up
the deficit. Fullerton's 184-pounder Jesse
Taylor put the meet out of reach with a 13-3
major decision over Stanford junior Mark
Egesdal.
The Cardinal closed out the dual meet
with a highlight, though. Stanford sopho
more lan Bork. a 197-pounder. had a domi
nating 17-3 win over Titan Charlie Walz.

The Stanford wrestling team took its first loss of the season to conference rival Cal State-
Fullerton, but several of the Cardinal avenged their individual losses at the California
Open the following day
"We weren't satisfied |with our perfor
mance]," said senior heavyweight Shawn Ritzen
thaler. "But we haven't peaked as a team, and
we're steadily improving. We need to come back
and wrestle tough and compete to the best of our
abilities."
The California Open on Saturday continued a
similar theme of underclassmen contributions
and dominance by Gentry. Gentry was the Car
dinal's sole tournament champion with a record
of 5-0. The impressive run included two pins and
two wins against Pac-10 opponents — the
Titan's Lago and Brian Stith of Arizona State.
"The tournament is great because we get to
preview West Coast wrestling," Buddie said.
The Cardinal also sent other wrestlers to the
podium, including redshirt sophomore Tanner
Gardner who competed unattached and placed

second in the 125-pound weight class.
"I think we did a pretty good job bouncing
back after the Fullerton loss," Ritzenthaler said.
"We sent people to the podium, and even those
who did not place won matches. I'm excited
about wrestling as the season progresses."
The youth movement continued for the Car
dinal as Zupancic got fourth and true freshman
Rafael Chavez took third place and retribution.
"I think it was great that Rafael Chavez, a
true freshman was able to avenge his loss in the
dual meet and win against a Fullerton wrestler,"
Buddie said.
Next up for the Cardinal is Division II oppo
nent San Francisco State (0-0), which visits
Burnham Pavilion tonight at 7 p.m.
"We expect to win our matches," Buddie said.
"Tomorrow is no exception. [San Francisco

State is] on the young side, but they're very well
coached and we can never take them lightly."
Ritzenthaler added, "The home opener is im
portant. We want to keep the support of our fans
because we're very appreciative of them. We
want to show them exciting wrestling. We want
to start picking up momentum in this little mini
season we have before we come back for the
main season."
After the match tonight, the Cardinal do not
wrestle again until Dec. 19 fora tournament in
Reno. Nev. This break will help heal some nag
ging injuries from fatigue like sore knees and
shoulders. But, the break will not dampen the
enthusiasm.
"I'm really proud of the excitement in the
team," Ritzenthaler said. "We want to improve
on our great season last year."
