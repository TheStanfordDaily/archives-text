### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The season's first dual meet proved to be
a tough test of youth while showcasing the
reemergence of a champion.
The Stanford wrestling team (0-1, 0-1 Pa
cific* 10 Conference) evened the score in its
Cal State-Fullerton (1-1, 1-1 Pac-10) dual
meet with four matches to go, only to drop
three of the final four weight classes and
eventually fall 23-14 at Titan Gym.
"The dual meet was frustrating," said
Stanford head coach Steve Buddie. "Howev
er, since it was the first one of the year, it was
also the very first dual meet for some of our
wrestlers in front of a big crowd, so it can be
a good stepping stone. If we learn something,
we can take the loss on the chin and move
on."
Stanford's first two victories came from
125-pound senior Nathan Peterson who
earned a 7-5 win, and 149-pound redshirt
freshman Josh Zupancic, who bested Titan
Jeff Silva in the tightest contest of the meet,
an 8-7 decision.
The Cardinal's returning national cham
pion. senior co-captain Matt Gentry, won his
first real match at 157 since earning the
NCAA crown. The 8-0 major decision

against Angelo Lago was especially signifi
cant because Gentry passed Buddie as the
winningest Cardinal wrestler of all time at
110 career wins. Gentry also continues to im
prove on his Stanford record for consecutive
wins without a loss, which now stands at 43.
A turning point in the meet was the match
between the squad's 174-pounders. Stanford
had just fallen behind Fullerton after fresh
man Scott Loescher lost a 7-3 decision to
Risto Marttinen at 165. Stanford junior Imad
Kharbush held the early lead against highly
regarded Leonel Sanchez, but Sanchez came
back to win the decision by a thin 8-6 margin.
"Some things didn't go our way," Buddie
said. "Down the stretch we needed a crucial
takedown and couldn't get it. All in all, I
think Fullerton out-wrestled us."
Once the Cardinal had dropped the ago
nizingly close match, they could not make up
the deficit. Fullerton's 184-pounder Jesse
Taylor put the meet out of reach with a 13-3
major decision over Stanford junior Mark
Egesdal.
The Cardinal closed out the dual meet
with a highlight, though. Stanford sopho
more lan Bork. a 197-pounder. had a domi
nating 17-3 win over Titan Charlie Walz.
