LAHAINA, Hawaii — In a high-school
like atmosphere at the cozy Lahaina Civic
Center, Stanford handled the ball like a
high school team in a 69-57 loss to Ten
nessee in the first round of the EA Sports
Maui Invitational last night.
After surviving a scare and 20
turnovers in Friday night's overtime win
over San Francisco, the Cardinal (1-1)
turned the ball over 24 times against Ten
nessee, and the Volunteers made them
pay. Tennessee scored 28 points off
turnovers, including 21 in the first half
alone, to help build a 32-20 lead. The Vol
unteers withstood a late Stanford surge to
win their season opener.
Stanford junior point guard Chris Her
nandez, who had 30 points and seven
turnovers against USF, finished with 10
points, four turnovers and four assists
against the Volunteers.
"Slowly I'm improving, but definitely
we can't win the game when we have 24
turnovers," Hernandez said. "We've got
to try to really appreciate a possession."
Tennessee senior guard Scooter Mc-
Fadgon led all scorers with 21 points on 7-
for-13 shooting and added eight rebounds
for the Volunteers (1-0). The transfer
from Memphis, who worked out with for
mer Tigers teammate DaJuan Wagner
and NBA All-Star Allen Iverson this sum
mer, scored six straight points to extend

the Volunteers' lead to 51-31 with 11:52 to
play in the game.
Trailing 53-33, Stanford went on a 12-0
run, which included two put-backs inside
by junior Matt Haryasz (10 points, seven
rebounds) and was capped by a three
pointer from Chris Hernandez from the
top of the key. The run turned the mo
mentum in Stanford's favor and prompted
Tennessee head coach Buzz Peterson to
call a timeout with 7:45 to play.
But out of the timeout, the Cardinal re
verted to their first-half ways, turning the
ball over three times in the next three min
utes and failing to take advantage of a
Tennessee cold spell to cut further into the
lead.
Tennessee forward Major Wingate fi
nally put an end to the Volunteers' five
minute scoring drought with a layup in the
lane with five minutes to play, and a
jumper by junior point guard C.J. Watson,
who finished with 16 points and five steals,
extended the lead back to 10. Stanford re
sponded with four straight points but
would get no closer than six the rest of the
way.
Even when the Cardinal held on to the
ball long enough to get open looks at the
basket, their shots wouldn't fall. Stanford
did not make a three-pointer until four
minutes into the second half, finished 2-
for-12 from long range and shot 42.1 per
cent as a team after shooting 53 percent

Junior Dan Grunfeld posted 19 points and eight rebounds in
last night's game, but turnovers gave the Vols the win.
against USF. A particularly low
point came when a Haryasz free
throw late in the first half was nul
lified by a Stanford lane violation.
"Our emphasis has been to go
inside," Johnson said. "I'm not
concerned about our ability to
shoot the basketball. We dug our
selves a hole."
McFadgon helped the Volun
teers build a 17-6 lead by scoring
seven points, including an NBA
range three-pointer as part of an
11-0 first-half run.
Minutes later, Tennessee ex
tended its lead to 12 in rim-rock
ing fashion.
Freshman shooting guard
Chris Lofton picked off a pass at
half-court, raced into the front
court and fed a streaking McFad
gon for an acrobatic alley-oop
dunk that brought the Tennessee

faithful in attendance to their
feet.
"They got on top of us pretty
good," Johnson said. "They
changed defenses and got us out
of rhythm early. We dug our
selves a hole. That's not the bas
ketball team I've been seeing in
practice, but all the errors we
made are correctable."
Senior forward Rob Little
added,"We need to get in an ag
gressive mindset that we don't
have yet. We're still trying to form
an identity with this team."
Little finished with eight points
and six rebounds.
Junior guard Dan Grunfeld led
the Cardinal with 19 points— 15
after halftime — with his father
Ernie, the second-leading scorer
in Tennessee history, in atten
dance. Grunfeld also added eight

rebounds.
Johnson sat with his arms
crossed, visibly disgusted with his
team's play for the final minutes of
the first half. The 12-point deficit
could have been worse, but Wat
son's heave from just in front of
half-court rattled in and out as the
horn sounded.
