Yes, still you.
I'm still writing this column for
an audience of one, and I still want
each and every one of you to take it
to heart.

times of the year. In Gilroy, they're
taking stock to see if they've got the
cojones to stand up to No. 1 seed
Oak Grove. In Burlingame, they are
looking to get after Santa Cruz in a
mid-afternoon affair. But I'm inter
ested in Palo Alto, where Paly High
is riding the coattails of the most
thrilling win in view of Hoover
Tower this season.
You see friends, you know what I
have done? That's right. I have given
up. Gone to the dark side. I have
been to the place where teenagers
hatch plans to get into our frat par
ties, where braces run free and where
there is enough glitter to choke a
donkey, and I liked it. No. I loved it.
I went to Paly High's first round
playoff game against Monterey, and
let me tell you, it was incredible.
Do you miss players playing as
hard as they can on the field, and
then as accessible as your long lost
best friend off it? Do you want to
watch gutsy play calls that could
make or break a season? Do you
need a quarterback that also plays
defensive back and kicks field goals?
Well I did. and I found it all at
Paly High last Saturday night. So
while Ron Artest was behind on
points, only to come back to KO a
Pistons fan. 1 was in the sixth row of
the bleachers, watching a fantastic
comeback against a formidable
Monterey team.
Let me set the stage. After nei
ther team could score in the first half
— with Monterey mostly running
the option, but Paly with a variety of
offensive sets and plays — the sec

ond half came alive. Monterey
scored first, only to be quickly
matched by Paly, tying the game at
seven. But after a Monterey score
with about four minutes left looked
like it would seal the deal, Nathan
Ford said hello.
Ford, a senior at Paly, the quar
terback, a defensive back and their
kicker, simply took over the game
when it mattered the most. Driving
down the field with the season on
the line. Ford launched a bomb to a
wide receiver with a name that I was
way too excited to note down, such
was my emotion and lack of journal
istic skill. The receiver broke free
after a 30-yard toss, breaking a tack
le to score the biggest touchdown of
his career.
Put yourself in Ford's shoes now.
14-13. A minute and a half left in the
game. What do you do? Do you go
for one, to send it to OT, or do you
go for glory?
After sending on the field goal
unit, for which Ford was of course
the kicker. Coach Hansen called a
timeout, talked it over with his team
and decided to go for it all.
"I thought we were going to go
for one," Ford said after the game,
"but Coach decided to go for two. I
was kind of relieved, actually."
Relieved? Relieved? You were
relieved to put it all on the line, to
risk it against a team you couldn't
score on in the first half?
Well, I sure wasn't relieved! I
was standing up, knees knocking,
teeth chattering, assuming every
thing was going to go wrong — and

I'm still writing
this for you, sopho
more guy. 1 see you
eating your grilled
cheese sandwich in
Soto, bemoaning
your perfect SAT
score and matching
draw number.
I'm still writing
this for you, hel
met e d grad stu-

dent. I see you eating at Tresidder,
counting off the seconds before your
precious wrap station opens, laugh
ing at us undergrads that have to
(hah!) bathe on a regular basis. Jeff
Dorman, the master's candidate who
recently propositioned my girlfriend
on thefacebook.com, I'm still writing
this for you.
I'm even still writing this for you,
Stanford professors. I see you not
returning my midterm until dead
week, not noticing me put my back
pack under my jacket as I ditch
class, hoping to make it seem like
I'm just going to the bathroom.
I'm still writing this for all of us,
because we all have to take a long,
hard look at ourselves.
All across this great Bay Area,
high school campuses are gearing
up for some of the most exciting

this was my first time on campus!
But Ford was cool under pres
sure, executing a little play action to
a wide open flanker, uncovered by
linebackers who bought the run.
Shows how much I know.
Paly ended up winning the game.
15-14, advancing to the section
semifinals against Westmont at Mil
pitas High, Saturday at 7 pm.
So 1 still say to you: "Postpone
your meetings. Call your long-dis
tance boyfriend after we win. Study
on Sunday. For once in your Stan
ford career, get behind a cause that
you can't lead. Be part of the pack, a
faceless one of many, and idolize
those athletes. You may not care,
you may hate football, you may say
that you have three more tries."
Well. I'm a senior, two victories
will get us to the State Section title,
and I've got my eyes on a suite at the
Sheraton Hotel... you know, the
one on El Camino. No, not the one
by 101, the one by Town and Coun
try. No, you're thinking of the
Cabana. I'm talking about the Sher
aton, right where University and El
Camino . . . you know what. I'll
Map Quest it for you.
Saturday. Westmont.
Be there.
