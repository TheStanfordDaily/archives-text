# Women face Hawaii over Thanksgiving break
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
With Thanksgiving just around
the corner, even the tireless No. 1
Stanford women's tennis team must
give in to the simple joys in life:
turkey, stuffing and gravy with all
the fixins. And don't forget the
pumpkin pie.
But leave it to the title-winning
squad to mix business with pleasure,
as the Cardinal devote part of their
weeklong. Big Island vacation to a
match against Hawaii.
The Rainbow Wahine, though
an NCAA Division I contender, is
expected to continue its trend of
shutout losses to Stanford. Decade
long records show Hawaii has yet to
notch a single team win against
Stanford.
Individual match wins over Stan
ford. likewise, have been few and far
between. Last season, Kana Aikawa
captured the lone singles wins for the
Rainbow Wahine, defeating junior
Jessica Leek twice in the No. 6 sin
gles position.
Leek fell to Aikawa at Kaplua
Tennis Gardens, 6-4,6-4.
Leek suffered her next straight
set loss two months later, at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, 6-1,6-4.
Leek is currently studying abroad
in Florence, leaving freshmen Whit
ney Deason (9-1) and Lejla Hodzic
(5-2) more playing opportunities in
their first collegiate team tennis
match.
Based on their recent individual
triumphs, neither Deason nor Hodz
ic should have trouble with Hawaii.
Two weeks ago. Deason claimed
her first tournament title at the Ari
zona State Thunderbird Invitation
al, where she was seeded fourth.
Deason battled past four rounds
of opponents in straight sets, includ
ing the Sun Devils' top seed. No. 52
Josslyn Burkett (5-4), in the semifi
nals. Deason clinched a 6-3, 6-0 vic
tory over Burkett to face off against
Hodzic in the final.
After a weekend of rain delays,
the two teammates returned home
for their three-set battle for the
crown. Deason emerged victorious.
6-2,2-6,6-3.
Unseeded Hodzic had her own
share of challenges at the tourna
ment, overpowering third seed

Maria Rosenberg of Kansas State, 6-
3,6-3 in the quarterfinals.
In doubles, the freshman duo is
fast developing into a force to be
reckoned with. Together, Deason
and Hodzic enjoyed three easy wins
at Arizona State before inclement
weather took over, and the pair con
tributed to an all-Stanford doubles
semifinal at last month's ITA North
west Regional Championships.
The No. 13 team of senior Erin
Burdette and junior Alice Barnes (9-
1) posted an 8-1 victory over Deason
and Hodzic before claiming the
Northwest doubles title from Fresno
State.
While today's match against
Hawaii may not prove to be the most
challenging, it does mark the start of
regular season, the start of a increas
ingly high-pressure race to the
NCAA finish line.
For Barnes, who stands at 5-4 in
singles, it will be a chance to hold
onto her No. 6 national ranking and
start improving her mediocre record
with one of the undefeated runs
we've seen in past seasons.
Lest the Cardinal get ahead of
themselves, however, rest assured
that there will be gravy enough for
all at the Thanksgiving dinner table
and a vacation destination most of us
can only dream of.
Big Island action begins today at
noon.
