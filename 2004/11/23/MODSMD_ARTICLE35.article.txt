# Card victorious in Long Beach
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a disappointing loss to No. 6
Texas in Austin two weeks ago, the
No. 4 Stanford women's swim team
went into training with renewed
vigor. The squad's hard work paid
off this weekend as it won the 2(X)4
UC-Irvine Speedo Cup in dominat
ing fashion.
The Cardinal finished with 1211.5
points, beating out second-place
Oregon State by nearly 90 points.
The gap would have been much larg
er, but the Cardinal had decided
ahead of time to leave early and skip
the finals on Saturday. In several of
these races, Stanford swimmers had
the top qualifying times.
Freshman Caroline Bruce, an
Olympian who was expected to
make a big impact on the team, was
named Swimmer of the Meet for her
phenomenal performance.
"It was pretty exciting," Bruce
said. "I didn't even know about it be
cause we left early. This was the first
meet where they've had anything
like that, so I'm really honored."
Bruce took first in the 100-yard
breaststroke and in the 200-yard in
dividual medley, both in NCAA "A"
qualifying times. She picked up an
other "A" time in the preliminaries
of the 200-yard breaststroke, as the
top qualifier, but the team left before
the Saturday finals. Her second
place finish in the 100-yard back
stroke was good enough fora "B"
qualifying mark.
In the three-day meet, junior

Laura Davis posted NCAA "B"
times in her victory in the 400-yard
IM, her second-place finish behind
Bruce in the 200-yard IM and in her
preliminary swim in the 100-yard
butterfly.
Freshman Elizabeth Durot
swam on a winning relay and post
ed a second-place finish, only .09
seconds behind the winner, in the
500-yard freestyle. Fellow fresh
man Erica Liu also achieved a "B"
time in the preliminaries of the
200-yard IM before finishing sixth
in the final.
As she has in every meet so far,
freshman Brooke Bishop took first
in the 50-yard freestyle, this time
with a "B" qualifying time.
Head coach Richard Quick was
very pleased with his team's finish
and especially impressed by the
standout performances of the fresh
men who, on Thursday alone, con
tributed two first-place and two sec
ond-place finishes in only three indi
vidual events.
"It bodes well both for the future
of our program and for this year to
have our freshmen performing so
well," Quick said. "They can make a
real difference not only in the future
but in this year's team."
In addition to a slew of personal
victories, the Stanford women post
ed two relay wins, first in the 800-
yard freestyle relay, swum by Durot,
sophomore Morgan Hentzen,
sophomore Desiree Stahley and se
nior Lacey Boutwell. Bruce added to
her string of individual wins, swim
mint' one lee of the winning 400-vard

medley relay, joined by Bishop, ju
nior Dana Kirk and Boutwell.
Kirk and Boutwell each added an
individual win, both with "B" quali
fying times. Kirk took first in the
100-yard butterfly; and Boutwell
won the 200-yard freestyle, as well as
posting two other "B" times in the
preliminaries of the 100-yard and 50-
yard free races.
Heading into the competition,
the team's main objective was to as
sess the effectiveness of its training
to this point. After the Cardinal's
commanding victory, they were
happy with what they saw.
"We had some very good perfor
mances and some that weren't quite
so good," Quick said. "It gave us a
real good indication of our
strengths and weaknesses, and we
still have a lot of time to work on
our weaknesses. I felt like it was a
great learning experience. And a
pretty good early-season dress re
hearsal for the Pac-10 Champi
onships and the NCAAs."
The Cardinal women are well on
their way to NCAAs, having gotten
quite a few qualifying standards out
of the way in the first three meets of
the fall season. The focus from now
on will be on working with each
swimmer's ability to maximize her
potential.
"Some people need to keep
doing the kind of things we've been
doing and other people need to do
a slightly different approach based
on the results we've seen," Quick
said.
As for Bruce, she plans to contin
ue to work on quite a few events.
"Before the season started 1 was
planning to do the 100 and 200
breaststroke and the 2(X) and 400 IM
throughout the year," she said. "But
now that Kristen Caverly is injured. I
might be doing some more back
stroke. It depends. Hopefully, she's
not out that long. Basically I'll be
training a lot of I Ms so I can keep all
of my strokes."
Junior Caverly. an Olympian in
the backstroke, has been troubled by
back pain which has kept her out of
competition in the last few weeks,
but her condition is improving and
the team hopes to have her back very
soon.
This was the team's last competi
tion of the fall preseason. When
Stanford returns to action following
winter break, the team will face Pa
cific on Jan. 15 and then kick off the
conference season in Arizona the
following weekend.

tributed two first-place and two sec
ond-place finishes in only three indi
vidual events.
"It bodes well both for the future
of our program and for this year to
have our freshmen performing so
well," Quick said. "They can make a
real difference not only in the future
but in this year's team."
In addition to a slew of personal
victories, the Stanford women post
ed two relay wins, first in the 800-
yard freestyle relay, swum by Durot,
sophomore Morgan Hentzen,
sophomore Desiree Stahley and se
nior Lacey Boutwell. Bruce added to
her string of individual wins, swim
mint' one lee of the winning 400-vard

medley relay, joined by Bishop, ju
nior Dana Kirk and Boutwell.
Kirk and Boutwell each added an
individual win, both with "B" quali
fying times. Kirk took first in the
100-yard butterfly; and Boutwell
won the 200-yard freestyle, as well as
posting two other "B" times in the
preliminaries of the 100-yard and 50-
yard free races.
Heading into the competition,
the team's main objective was to as
sess the effectiveness of its training
to this point. After the Cardinal's
commanding victory, they were
happy with what they saw.
"We had some very good perfor
mances and some that weren't quite
so good," Quick said. "It gave us a
real good indication of our
strengths and weaknesses, and we
still have a lot of time to work on
our weaknesses. I felt like it was a
great learning experience. And a
pretty good early-season dress re
hearsal for the Pac-10 Champi
onships and the NCAAs."
The Cardinal women are well on
their way to NCAAs, having gotten
quite a few qualifying standards out
of the way in the first three meets of
the fall season. The focus from now
on will be on working with each
swimmer's ability to maximize her
potential.
"Some people need to keep
doing the kind of things we've been
doing and other people need to do
a slightly different approach based
on the results we've seen," Quick
said.
As for Bruce, she plans to contin
ue to work on quite a few events.
"Before the season started 1 was
planning to do the 100 and 200
breaststroke and the 2(X) and 400 IM
throughout the year," she said. "But
now that Kristen Caverly is injured. I
might be doing some more back
stroke. It depends. Hopefully, she's
not out that long. Basically I'll be
training a lot of I Ms so I can keep all
of my strokes."
Junior Caverly. an Olympian in
the backstroke, has been troubled by
back pain which has kept her out of
competition in the last few weeks,
but her condition is improving and
the team hopes to have her back very
soon.
This was the team's last competi
tion of the fall preseason. When
Stanford returns to action following
winter break, the team will face Pa
cific on Jan. 15 and then kick off the
conference season in Arizona the
following weekend.

Junior Kristen Caverly did not swim at the Speedo Cup due to a back in
jury, but the Cardinal pulled out a commanding victory anyway.
After a disappointing loss to No. 6
Texas in Austin two weeks ago, the
No. 4 Stanford women's swim team
went into training with renewed
vigor. The squad's hard work paid
off this weekend as it won the 2(X)4
UC-Irvine Speedo Cup in dominat
ing fashion.
The Cardinal finished with 1211.5
points, beating out second-place
Oregon State by nearly 90 points.
The gap would have been much larg
er, but the Cardinal had decided
ahead of time to leave early and skip
the finals on Saturday. In several of
these races, Stanford swimmers had
the top qualifying times.
Freshman Caroline Bruce, an
Olympian who was expected to
make a big impact on the team, was
named Swimmer of the Meet for her
phenomenal performance.
"It was pretty exciting," Bruce
said. "I didn't even know about it be
cause we left early. This was the first
meet where they've had anything
like that, so I'm really honored."
Bruce took first in the 100-yard
breaststroke and in the 200-yard in
dividual medley, both in NCAA "A"
qualifying times. She picked up an
other "A" time in the preliminaries
of the 200-yard breaststroke, as the
top qualifier, but the team left before
the Saturday finals. Her second
place finish in the 100-yard back
stroke was good enough fora "B"
qualifying mark.
In the three-day meet, junior

Laura Davis posted NCAA "B"
times in her victory in the 400-yard
IM, her second-place finish behind
Bruce in the 200-yard IM and in her
preliminary swim in the 100-yard
butterfly.
Freshman Elizabeth Durot
swam on a winning relay and post
ed a second-place finish, only .09
seconds behind the winner, in the
500-yard freestyle. Fellow fresh
man Erica Liu also achieved a "B"
time in the preliminaries of the
200-yard IM before finishing sixth
in the final.
As she has in every meet so far,
freshman Brooke Bishop took first
in the 50-yard freestyle, this time
with a "B" qualifying time.
Head coach Richard Quick was
very pleased with his team's finish
and especially impressed by the
standout performances of the fresh
men who, on Thursday alone, con
