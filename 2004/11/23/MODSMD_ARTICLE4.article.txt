# Prof says Quran promotes equality between genders
## Barlas blames false readings of Quran 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Asma Barlas argued yesterday
that, contrary to popular belief, the
Quran is a "radically egalitarian
and liberating text" and does not
condone misogynistic treatment of
women.
During her lecture and the
sometimes contentious question
and-answer session that followed.
Barlas challenged many of the
dominant interpretations of the
Quran and offered an alternative
reading, one that puts patriarchal
societies in opposition to true
Islam.
"There is not a single verse in
the Quran that grants men that
power over life and death." she
said.
Barlas, a professor of politics at
Ithaca University, spent the first 33
years of her life in Pakistan. Her

hook " Believing Women' in Islam:
Unreading Patriarchal Interpreta
tions of the Quran" was released in
2002.
"Muslims have not dealt in a
fine way with the Quran itself," she
said. "There is a tendency to be
crude and arbitrary."
Barlas said she based her inter
pretation on her belief that "the
Quran as God's word is eternal and
perfect, but our readings of it are
not."
She said that while there are
texts that interpret the Quran as
supporting a patriarchal society,
the Quran itself does not.
"We must read the Quran for its
best meaning and as a whole," Bar
las said.
She also argued that Muslims
must address the relationship be
tween "knowledge and the means
of its production. The Quran was
revealed to a patriarchy and inter
preted within the context of that
patriarchy."
Barlas' own reading of the
Quran begins, in her words, with "a
sound theological understanding

of God." In Barlas' view, the "just
God" described in the Quran —
one who would not transgress
against others — would not ap
prove of "patriarchies that trans
gress against the rights of women .
. . Divine sovereignty and male
sovereignty are not compatible."
After the lecture, some atten
dees praised Barlas and her ideas,
while others were more critical.
One listener, after saying that
he agreed with many of Barlas'
points and even found them "obvi
ous," complained at length about
Barlas' negative portrayal of the
men who created Islamic laws.
"If your goal is reform, why de
monize good men?" he demanded.
Barlas responded, "I have not
demonized anybody. I have just
said that in the formation of the
law, many non-Quranic sources
have creeped in."
Another attendee defended the
behavior of most Muslim men, say
ing that the incidents of male vio
lence against women and children
that Barlas described were not typ
ical of educated Muslim men.

"Lots of men in Pakistan are
perfectly kind to their wives." Bar
las acknowledged. "I'm not inter
ested in quantifying goodness or
badness in Muslim societies, but I
think their tendency is to oppress
women, be it in a genteel or more
brutal fashion. Misogyny is not just
peasants in the street."
Barlas, whose talk was spon
sored by the Muslim Student
Awareness Network, concluded
her lecture by broadening her cri
tique from the Islamic world to
global society, focusing particular
ly on the United States.
"Violence against women is uni
versal," she said. "What 1 find most
discouraging is not Muslim soci
eties that mistrust and abuse
women, but rather U.S. support of
those regimes."
She added, "I do not believe in
the legitimacy of the Afghan and
Iraq wars or the broader neocon
servative agenda for the Middle
East. I do not believe that the Unit
ed States has developed a viable
policy vis-a-vis Muslims."
