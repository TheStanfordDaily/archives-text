# Cingular users get discounts on plans
## 
### SAMANTHA FLOAM 
As a result of the acquisition of
AT&T Wireless by Cingular last
month, Cingular customers on campus
can now receive the discounted cell
phone plans that have been offered
since September to Stanford students
who have AT&T Wireless service.
"The discount sponsorship plan
will continue under the Cingular and
AT&T merger, giving students the
best prices for services," said Teresa
Janeway, director of marketing ser
vices of Information Technology
Systems and Services, which negoti
ated the Stanford-AT&T Wireless
Sponsorship Program.
The plans offer Stanford AT&T
and Cingular users a 15 percent
monthly discount on their plans and

a 50 percent discount on the pur
chase of a new phone. Users sign up
to take advantage of these discounts
through the Stanford ITSS Web site.
Janeway said that AT&T Wireless
and Cingular customers will receive
numerous benefits from the merger.
All service holders will have access to
a network that is twice as large as the
current AT&T Wireless network, a
larger local calling area and free mo
bile-to-mobile calls to Cingular and
AT&T Wireless customers.
AT&T Wireless users' plans will
not be impacted, but they will have
to purchase a new Cingular phone to
be able to use some of the technolo
gy that had previously been exclu
sive to Cingular users.
Some AT&T users were unaware
that the merger occurred and did not
notice a change in their service.
"I had no idea because my service
has been so good," said freshman
John Wear, 'i was not inconve
nienced at all by the merger."
Stanford has used AT&T as its
primary service provider for the past
four years. The exact percentage of
students who use AT&T and their
account information is not accessible
to ITSS because the information is
private between AT&T and its
users.
However, a sales representative
from the Wireless Resource store in
Palo Alto said that the most popular
cell phone providers among his cus
tomers are Verizon and T-Mobile.
Some students with other service
plans complained of the poor recep
tion they receive on campus. The
benefits of the merger and the im
proved service may persuade stu
dents to change their phone service.
Junior Eugene Kim stated.
"Everybody knows that Verizon has
very bad reception on campus. I was
planning on switching to AT&T be
cause of the student discount, but
now that 1 know that it is merging
with Cingular, the incentive to
switch is even greater."
