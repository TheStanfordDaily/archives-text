1975— On Nov. 24, an intoxicated
group of students and youngsters
turned on police and firefighter who
came to douse the pre-Big Game
Bonfire. Below is an excerpt:
"A drunken crowd composed
mainly of youths hurled bottles and
rocks at firefighter and injured one
police officer following last Friday
night's Big Game Bonfire at Lake
Lagunita.
Robert McKenzie, 20, of Los
Altos Hills, was booked early Satur
day morning at the North Santa
Clara County jail tin one charge of
assault with a deadly weapon on a
police officer.
Five juveniles were cited with
failing to disperse and resisting ar
rest and were released to their par
ents' custody.
The problems began around L )
p.m., when most of the Bonfire's
5000 spectators had left. 'At that
time there were only 500 to 800 peo
ple remaining. They were all drunk
or stoned, throwing things and run
ning into the fire," said Bob Ottilie,
Inter Fraternity Council president.
Ottilie said the 20 fraternity secu
rity men and five hired police offi
cers were unable to restrain the
crowd. Bonfire organizers had esti
mated that there would only be a
bout 50 people still at the Bonfire
around y p.m., just as with last year's
crowd.
After the police and fire trucks
arrived, the firefighter found them
selves targets of the crowd. Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer of Stanford Police
Services then declared the gathering
an unlawful assembly, and most of
the juveniles left the area.

19X3 — On Nov. 24, long before
Stanford professors launched Gravi
ty Probe B, The Daily ran a story
about a professor who blasted off
into the space with experimental
equipment, including an "electron
gun." Below is an excerpt:
"Weather permitting, the space
shuttle Columbia will blast off at 8
a.m. today carrying a Stanford pro
fessor and an experiment prepared
by the University and Japanese
scholars.
NASA officials said yesterday
that 'questionable' weather might
force postponement of the launch.
Owen Garriott, a consulting pro
fessor of electrical engineering here,
will conduct electron detection ex
periments and run the first outer
space amateur radio during the nine
day mission. He will also operate an
electron gun to study the nature of
the earth's upper atmosphere in a
project designed by Stanford scien
tists and Tatsu Obayashi of the Uni
versity of Tokyo.
The Stanford-Japanese electron
beam experiment will involve a
10.000-watt electron gun with a di
ameter of 30 centimeters. The gun
will create an artificial aurora by
shooting electrons to an altitude of
approximately 220 miles.
The shuttle will also carry Space
lab. the most expensive and sophisti
cated research facility ever sent into
space.
The 17-ton, $1.1 billion Spacelab
contains equipment for more than
70 scientific experiments. It is a step
toward the construction of a perma
nent manned space station."
