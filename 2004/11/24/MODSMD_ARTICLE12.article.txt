Last night I auditioned for the
Vagina Monologues. I haven't audi
tioned for anything in years, but I
stepped out of dramatic retirement
because I have so much respect for
this play and the movement sur
rounding it. When Eve Ensler began
performing this one-woman show, she
forced newscasters, suburban house
wives and politicians to say the word
"vagina."
The Vagina Monologues brought
"vagina" into the vocabularies of peo
ple who only referred to that part of a

woman's
body as"you
know." I am
embarrassed
to admit that
I am one of
those peo
ple. I can't
say "vagina."
I can barely
even write it.
Anytime
I need to
talk about
vaginas I say,
"Well, um
(hand ges
ture, head

nod) you know." I can typically get
away with that, because how often
does one really need to talk about
vaginas? Everyone seems to be a lot
more comfortable if the subject is
never broached.
How can you talk about something
if you don't have a word for it?
In this column, I've spent a lot of
time talking about the power of
words. Usually, I'm arguing to reclaim
words that have been stolen and bas
tardized. Not this time. I want "femi
nism" back, but you can keep "vagi
na."
It's an ugly word. It sounds like a
disease.
"Angina" is a serious heart condi
tion. but "vagina" is supposed to be a
friendly, non-threatening word?
Hardly The consonants are too harsh,
it's multi-syllabic and it requires the
tongue to do too much work. Isn't
that just like a vagina?
I won't use "vagina," so what am I
left with?
Pussy? First of all, saying that
makes me feel like an amateur porn
star. You can't say "pussy" to a doctor.
You can't say it to a priest. Why you'd
be saying it to a priest is a pretty good
question, since the recent scandals
seem to have shown that priests
aren't interested vaginas no matter
what you call them, but I digress.
"Pussy" has very limited contexts
in which it can be used appropriately,
and even in those, it is still awkward.
Second, it is used as an insult. Since
"pussy" has been taken to disparage
cowardly men, I don't want it back. If
having a "pussy" makes me a "pussy,"
maybe I'll start using "twat."
Like hell I will. Twat? Right,
because I want to sound like the
opening credits of the batman car
toons. Bang! Snap! Woosh! Twat!
How about Honey Pot? I hadn't
even heard this one until my friend's
boyfriend said it in a car on the way to
pub night. Suddenly I had all these
childhood memories from the ani
mated movies of Winnie the Pooh
getting his head caught in the honey
pot. Women already have enough
issues with oral sex that they should
n't have to worry about suffocating
Pooh bear.
Cooter? Coochie Snorcher? Box?
Bearded Clam? Punani? Rebecca?
There are thousands of options,
and none of them are good.
But maybe the problem isn't the
word. I think I'd like "punani" if it
referred to some tropical flower or
Asian dessert. It's pretty, with soft
vowels and unassuming consonants.
All in all, it's a good word.
The truth is, the reason we're not
talking about vaginas is not because
we're lacking vocabulary. Why are
vaginas considered dirty, smelly and
impolite, while phalluses are respect
ed, honored and praised? Hello,
Hoover Tower?
Why are vaginas are Lord
Voldemort of genitalia? Why must
she not be named?
I don't know. Maybe it's leftovers
from Eve and that damned apple. Or
maybe it's because of the power that
comes with pussy. Men have fought
many a war over a good woo-hoo.
The question remains: Why can't
we talk about women's sexuality?
