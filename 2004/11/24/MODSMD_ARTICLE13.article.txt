# Class for slackers?
## EDGE prof cracks down on attendance 
### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Engineering 297A: Ethics of Development in a Global
Environment. It's a mouthful of a name fora course.
The course, commonly called EDGE, is described in
the Stanford Bulletin as a Wednesday evening seminar
covering world affairs that brings in "expert speakers
from Stanford and other institutions who deal directly
with world policy makers through research and advisory
activities."
Most students, however, would highlight other aspects
of the class if asked to describe it. Of six current EDGE
students interviewed, only one cited course content as the
primary reason for taking the class. Others said they were
interested in the light workload and relaxed pace of the
course — and a boost in their grade point averages.
The class has been around since 1970, when it was
founded by Ken Cooper of the Bechtel International
Center anil Malcolm McWhorter from the Electrical
Engineering Department. Bruce Lusignan, also from the
Electrical Engineering Department, has taught the class
since 1986. Over the years, EDGE has become increasing
ly popular.
"When I took over EDGE there were about 40 or 50
students each quarter," Lusignan said. "Now there are
about 150, 200 and 250 in the autumn, winter and spring
quarters."
Many students who currently take EDGE say they
were attracted to it because the workload is not very
demanding. The requirements are a weekly lecture and
one 15 to 20-page final paper.
"Anyone would tell you that this class is designed for
engineers who need a break," said junior Babatunde
Oshinowo Jr., who is taking the class this quarter. "I feel
like the class is meant to be somewhat relaxed."
Attendance is mandatory. To enforce this policy,
Lusignan began having the siudents sign in during each
lecture.The rule, instituted live years ago, is also designed
to prevent students from fraudulently signing in for one
another, although until recently this part of the policy
was not strictly enforced.
But some students do not take this policy seriously
and have found a way around it.
"When the attendance sign in book is passed around,
each person has the book for at least a couple minutes,
flipping through to find the names of friends to sign in,"
sophomore Adrienne Keene said. "I'd say the majority of
the class signs in more than one person."
An EDGE student who wished to remain anonymous
said that it is easy to sign someone else's name at lecture.
"There are definitely people who sign each other in.
It's fairly simple," the student said. "You just have to get
a friend to do it each time, or just use your initials to
make it easier."
In order to curb this practice, Lusignan checks over
the sign-in sheets and puts a question mark by signatures
that varv from week to week, which mav lead to the stu

dent receiving an incomplete in the course. He believes
that this warning sends a message and has pretty much
solved the problem.
"Although there are over 100 students enrolled in the
course. I never see more than 40 or 50 in lectures on
Wednesday nights," an anonymous EDGE student said.
"People must be signing their friends in, but with the
stricter attendance enforcement policy, 1 think a lot more
people are being scared into going to class, including me
and my friends. So I think the new policy where the pro
fessor checks over signatures is pretty effective."
According to Assistant Dean and Judicial Advisor to
the Judicial Affairs Office Laurette Beeson, it is up to the
faculty to set rules regarding class attendance.
"If [professors] say that class attendance is mandatory
or that missing class affects their grade, that's certainly
within their prerogative to do so," Beeson said. "It would
be inappropriate to sign someone in fora class if they
were not in fact present. It's a form of misrepresenta
tion."
There seemed to be a mix of feelings among students

about the mandatory attendance policy for EDGE.
"The mandatory policy is a little silly because people
come but aren't held responsible for the information,"
another EDGE student said.
Others find merit in the attendance policy.
Junior Mohammad Subeh, who is taking this class in
order to complement his health and global policy area of
concentration in Human Biology, feels that attendance
should be mandatory, since speakers would be offended
and not want to return next year if people left or didn't
show up at all.
"1 personally think mandatory attendance is a good
idea, because otherwise the class would have no point, it
would be simply based on a paper," Keene said.
"On the other hand, it creates a lecture hall full of stu
dents who have no desire to be there, and are either
sleeping, doing other homework, or surfing the Internet.
If attendance were optional, the group of students in
attendance would be there to actually listen to the speak
ers — who I must say are surprisingly interesting."

faculty to set rules regarding class attendance.
"If [professors] say that class attendance is mandatory
or that missing class affects their grade, that's certainly
within their prerogative to do so," Beeson said. "It would
be inappropriate to sign someone in fora class if they
were not in fact present. It's a form of misrepresenta
tion."
There seemed to be a mix of feelings among students

about the mandatory attendance policy for EDGE.
"The mandatory policy is a little silly because people
come but aren't held responsible for the information,"
another EDGE student said.
Others find merit in the attendance policy.
Junior Mohammad Subeh, who is taking this class in
order to complement his health and global policy area of
concentration in Human Biology, feels that attendance
should be mandatory, since speakers would be offended
and not want to return next year if people left or didn't
show up at all.
"1 personally think mandatory attendance is a good
idea, because otherwise the class would have no point, it
would be simply based on a paper," Keene said.
"On the other hand, it creates a lecture hall full of stu
dents who have no desire to be there, and are either
sleeping, doing other homework, or surfing the Internet.
If attendance were optional, the group of students in
attendance would be there to actually listen to the speak
ers — who I must say are surprisingly interesting."

Engineering 297A: Ethics of Development in a Global
Environment. It's a mouthful of a name fora course.
The course, commonly called EDGE, is described in
the Stanford Bulletin as a Wednesday evening seminar
covering world affairs that brings in "expert speakers
from Stanford and other institutions who deal directly
with world policy makers through research and advisory
activities."
Most students, however, would highlight other aspects
of the class if asked to describe it. Of six current EDGE
students interviewed, only one cited course content as the
primary reason for taking the class. Others said they were
interested in the light workload and relaxed pace of the
course — and a boost in their grade point averages.
The class has been around since 1970, when it was
founded by Ken Cooper of the Bechtel International
Center anil Malcolm McWhorter from the Electrical
Engineering Department. Bruce Lusignan, also from the
Electrical Engineering Department, has taught the class
since 1986. Over the years, EDGE has become increasing
ly popular.
"When I took over EDGE there were about 40 or 50
students each quarter," Lusignan said. "Now there are
about 150, 200 and 250 in the autumn, winter and spring
quarters."
Many students who currently take EDGE say they
were attracted to it because the workload is not very
demanding. The requirements are a weekly lecture and
one 15 to 20-page final paper.
"Anyone would tell you that this class is designed for
engineers who need a break," said junior Babatunde
Oshinowo Jr., who is taking the class this quarter. "I feel
like the class is meant to be somewhat relaxed."
Attendance is mandatory. To enforce this policy,
Lusignan began having the siudents sign in during each
lecture.The rule, instituted live years ago, is also designed
to prevent students from fraudulently signing in for one
another, although until recently this part of the policy
was not strictly enforced.
But some students do not take this policy seriously
and have found a way around it.
"When the attendance sign in book is passed around,
each person has the book for at least a couple minutes,
flipping through to find the names of friends to sign in,"
sophomore Adrienne Keene said. "I'd say the majority of
the class signs in more than one person."
An EDGE student who wished to remain anonymous
said that it is easy to sign someone else's name at lecture.
"There are definitely people who sign each other in.
It's fairly simple," the student said. "You just have to get
a friend to do it each time, or just use your initials to
make it easier."
In order to curb this practice, Lusignan checks over
the sign-in sheets and puts a question mark by signatures
that varv from week to week, which mav lead to the stu

dent receiving an incomplete in the course. He believes
that this warning sends a message and has pretty much
solved the problem.
"Although there are over 100 students enrolled in the
course. I never see more than 40 or 50 in lectures on
Wednesday nights," an anonymous EDGE student said.
"People must be signing their friends in, but with the
stricter attendance enforcement policy, 1 think a lot more
people are being scared into going to class, including me
and my friends. So I think the new policy where the pro
fessor checks over signatures is pretty effective."
