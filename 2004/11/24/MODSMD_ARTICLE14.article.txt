# Global justice, war crimes convictions...
## All in a day's work for Prof. Terry Karl 
### COURTNEY WEAVER 
In the early 1980s, Political
Science Prof. Terry Karl was visiting
El Salvador when she stumbled
across a tortured body lying in a
McDonald's parking lot.
Karl, who at the time was a pro
fessor at Harvard, soon started trav
eling regularly back to El Salvador
and documenting human rights
abuses. Since then, her research has
led her to acquire the title of "expert
witness" in key human rights trials
involving murder and terrorism in
South America.
Karl has served as a major force
in helping to prosecute two
Salvadoran human rights violators
and recruited the help of a number
of Stanford undergraduate and
graduate students to help with her
research.
Though Karl had dealt with a
series of smaller legal cases, her first
big trial occurred in 2002 when she
helped to prosecute the Salvadoran
Generals Garcia and Vides
Casanova — who had retired and
were living in Florida — for leading
the Salvadoran military in crimes
against humanity. Karl focuses much
of her work on enforcing command
responsibility, the notion that top
military officials should be held
responsible for the crimes of their
subordinates.
The law firm which requested
Karl's help for prosecuting Garcia
and Vides warned her that it would
be an extremely difficult case
because of a lack of evidence against
the generals.
Karl cited another difficulty the

case posed.
"It was such a terrible complaint
that some of the lawyers hadn't even
been able to finish reading it." she
said.
Three years of researching her
testimony, which included reading
10,000 declassified government doc
uments with the help of several
Stanford graduate students, helped
Karl win the first command-respon
sibility case ever.
"In my view the generals who
were convicted were the leading
perpetrators of human rights abuse
in El Salvador," she said. "To see a
little justice was very gratifying."
After her win. Karl immediately
set to work on her next case regard
ing the 1980 assassination of
Salvadoran human rights activist
Archbishop Oscar Romero.
Last school year and this past
summer, Gina Bateson, Class of
2004, helped Karl piece together a
case to prove that Modesto, Calif,
resident Alvaro Saravia had been
involved in Romero's murder.
"My primary role was to gather
and synthesize information for
Professor Karl to use in her expert
witness testimony at the trial,"
Bateson said.
Bateson found that the hardest
part of her experience was not the
quantity of the research but the sub
ject matter itself.
"If you're spending many hours a
day investigating disappearances,
torture and killings, it really weighs
you down." she said. "The stories
you've heard or the images you've
seen that day stay in your mind,
even when you're not working.'"
"I also had nightmares about the

events I was researching," she
added. "But I suppose that's only
natural. I would be concerned if I
wasn't bothered by reading about
such disturbing things."
Bateson's research culminated in
the trial this summer. There, she got
to meet the Salvadoran witnesses
she had been learning about all year.
"Even though on the surface this
trial was about the death of one
man, it was tremendously important
to millions of Salvadorans." she said.
Bateson said that the moment
when the judge was to rule — to fine
Saravia $10 million — was "an
unforgettable moment."
"At that point, the energy in the
courtroom was amazing," Bateson
said. "People began chanting,
Romero! Presente! Romero!
Presente!' It was an unforgettable
moment."
Karl is again working with a team
of undergraduates for her next trial,
which is scheduled for next
September. She will serve as a wit
ness for the prosecution of a man
she believes to have been one of the
leading commanders in Salvadoran
state terror who has since retired to
Memphis. Tenn.
Karl is continuing to work full
time as a professor at Stanford and
has worked on all of three cases pro
bono.
"[Every victim] I worked with
was murdered, and I don't really
want to profit from that," she said.
Like Bateson, Karl feels the emo
tional taxation of her research.
"It's very hard to hear and see
and be a part of [these trials]," she
said. "It's very grueling work; it's
also very inspiring work."

state terror who has since retired to
Memphis. Tenn.
Karl is continuing to work full
time as a professor at Stanford and
has worked on all of three cases pro
bono.
"[Every victim] I worked with
was murdered, and I don't really
want to profit from that," she said.
Like Bateson, Karl feels the emo
tional taxation of her research.
"It's very hard to hear and see
and be a part of [these trials]," she
said. "It's very grueling work; it's
also very inspiring work."

With the help of many Stanford undergraduate and grad
uate students, Political Science Prof. Terry Karl has helped
to prosecute Salvadoran human rights violators.
In the early 1980s, Political
Science Prof. Terry Karl was visiting
El Salvador when she stumbled
across a tortured body lying in a
McDonald's parking lot.
Karl, who at the time was a pro
fessor at Harvard, soon started trav
eling regularly back to El Salvador
and documenting human rights
abuses. Since then, her research has
led her to acquire the title of "expert
witness" in key human rights trials
involving murder and terrorism in
South America.
Karl has served as a major force
in helping to prosecute two
Salvadoran human rights violators
and recruited the help of a number
of Stanford undergraduate and
graduate students to help with her
research.
Though Karl had dealt with a
series of smaller legal cases, her first
big trial occurred in 2002 when she
helped to prosecute the Salvadoran
Generals Garcia and Vides
Casanova — who had retired and
were living in Florida — for leading
the Salvadoran military in crimes
against humanity. Karl focuses much
of her work on enforcing command
responsibility, the notion that top
military officials should be held
responsible for the crimes of their
subordinates.
The law firm which requested
Karl's help for prosecuting Garcia
and Vides warned her that it would
be an extremely difficult case
because of a lack of evidence against
the generals.
Karl cited another difficulty the

case posed.
"It was such a terrible complaint
that some of the lawyers hadn't even
been able to finish reading it." she
said.
Three years of researching her
testimony, which included reading
10,000 declassified government doc
uments with the help of several
Stanford graduate students, helped
Karl win the first command-respon
sibility case ever.
"In my view the generals who
were convicted were the leading
perpetrators of human rights abuse
in El Salvador," she said. "To see a
little justice was very gratifying."
After her win. Karl immediately
set to work on her next case regard
ing the 1980 assassination of
Salvadoran human rights activist
Archbishop Oscar Romero.
Last school year and this past
summer, Gina Bateson, Class of
2004, helped Karl piece together a
case to prove that Modesto, Calif,
resident Alvaro Saravia had been
involved in Romero's murder.
"My primary role was to gather
and synthesize information for
Professor Karl to use in her expert
witness testimony at the trial,"
Bateson said.
Bateson found that the hardest
part of her experience was not the
quantity of the research but the sub
ject matter itself.
"If you're spending many hours a
day investigating disappearances,
torture and killings, it really weighs
you down." she said. "The stories
you've heard or the images you've
seen that day stay in your mind,
even when you're not working.'"
"I also had nightmares about the

events I was researching," she
added. "But I suppose that's only
natural. I would be concerned if I
wasn't bothered by reading about
such disturbing things."
Bateson's research culminated in
the trial this summer. There, she got
to meet the Salvadoran witnesses
she had been learning about all year.
"Even though on the surface this
trial was about the death of one
man, it was tremendously important
to millions of Salvadorans." she said.
Bateson said that the moment
when the judge was to rule — to fine
Saravia $10 million — was "an
unforgettable moment."
"At that point, the energy in the
courtroom was amazing," Bateson
said. "People began chanting,
Romero! Presente! Romero!
Presente!' It was an unforgettable
moment."
Karl is again working with a team
of undergraduates for her next trial,
which is scheduled for next
September. She will serve as a wit
ness for the prosecution of a man
she believes to have been one of the
leading commanders in Salvadoran
state terror who has since retired to
Memphis. Tenn.
Karl is continuing to work full
time as a professor at Stanford and
has worked on all of three cases pro
bono.
"[Every victim] I worked with
was murdered, and I don't really
want to profit from that," she said.

tional taxation of her research.
