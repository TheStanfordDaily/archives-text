## Editorial Cheer team deserves funding 
### 
Recently the ASSU passed a hill recom
mending that the Athletic Department
fund Cardinal C ompetitive Cheer hy giving
it $1().(HM) a year to cover its expenses. The
Athletic Department should seriously consider the
recommendation, as the group not only performs at
various sports games during the school year hut also
competes against other cheerleading programs at the
national level.
According to head coach Gina Sanchez, the squad
spends $3.()(H) each year to cover its uniforms and
coaching expenses every year. The rest of the budget
goes toward funding the team's annual berth at USA
Cheerleading Nationals.
Currently, the squad fundraiseson its own in order
to cover its expenses, from writing Stanford Fund let
ters to earning money by setting up for gymnastics
meets.
If the Athletic Department funded even just the
uniforms and coaching expenses for the group, which
are one-third of its expenses, it would allow them to
devote their fundraising efforts solely on expenses to
USA Cheerleading Nationals. This would lift a
tremendous burden off of the shoulders of the group's
members.
1 he Athletic Department gives funds to the Band
and Dollies to perform at athletic events, supple
menting their traveling expenses on trips to other
schools. ( ardinal Competitive Cheer cheers at many
athletic events for free on a voluntary basis.

At the recent Stanford-UCLA football game, the
Athletic Department asked the cheerleading squad
to come cheer at the game because the Band is not al
lowed inside the UCLA stadium. Yet the Athletic
Department did not cover any of the team's travelling
expenses, even though it did set the cheerleaders up
with a paid gig at an alumnus's wedding party.
Although we stand by our previously stated posi
tion that Competitive Cheer should not usurp the
Band or the Dollies' positions at sports games, it is
clear that the Athletic Department is utilizing the
group's services and consequently should fund them
the same way they fund the Band and Dollies.
Officials from the marketing division of the Ath
letic Department said that funding down the road for
the squad is a possibility. However, there are many
factors that would have to be considered in that deci
sion. including the value of having the cheerleading
team on the field.
This is understandable, as Cardinal Competitive
Cheer is a relatively new student group on campus,
having existed only three years, and it needs to time to
reach its full potential.
The Athletic Department should at least cover the
expenses for the group's uniforms and coaching, even
it it does not fund their way to nationals. I'he Depart
ment should seriously consider the ASSU's resolu
tion to give more funding to the squad, as it is offering
them similar services to other groups that are cur
rently funded.
