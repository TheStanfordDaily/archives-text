## America training terrorists in Georgia 
### RYAN SCHWARTZ MARIANA HUERTA 
As the "war on terror" continues
to he acted out across the globe, we
have forgotten our own role in the
creation of terrorists who have
killed and tortured tens of thou
sands of innocent people. With our
preoccupation with radical "Islami
cists" in the Arab and Muslim
worlds, we are neglecting American
involvement in the recent bloody
history of Latin America.
In utter hypocrisy, our tax dollars
continue to fund an institute that is
responsible for the creation and
training of ruthless paramilitaries.
School of the Americas graduates
have committed massacres, assassi
nations, kidnappings and torture in
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile.
Colombia, Id Salvador, Guatemala,
Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay,
Uruguay and Peru.
The SOA, now known as the
Western Hemisphere Institute for
Security Cooperation, trains Latin
American soldiers in Fort Benning,
Ga. Through an annual budget of
$5.6 million, paid by public tax dol
lars. SOA instructs Latin American
commandos in various warfare tech
niques, from raiding to interrogation.
"In IW>. the U.S. government

was forced to release seven of the
school's training manuals. Among
other top tips for terrorists, they rec
ommended blackmail, torture, exe
cution and the arrest of witnesses'
relatives," according to The
Guardian.
Graduates have included Pana
ma's Manuel Noriega, El Salvador's
Roberto D'Aubuisson and Argenti
na's Leopoldo Galtieri.
In Guatemala. Lima Estrada and
two other S( )A graduates led the so
called D-2 campaigns that "obliter
ated 44S Mayan Indian villages and
murdered tens of thousands of peo
ple." according to The C Juardian.
Forty percent of the cabinet
members that served in the coun
try's genocidal regimes were trained
in warfare at S()A.
The infamous death squads in El
Salvador, which murdered thou
sands of innocent men, women, and
children, were also made possible by
SOA instruction. In 1993, the U.N.
Truth Commission on F.I Salvador
report named the officers that were
responsible for these atrocities.
Two-thirds of them were trained at
SOA. Pinochet's secret police and
concentration camps in Chile were
also formed by SOA graduates.
The training of Latin American
terrorists continues todav. and the

U.S. State Department, as well as
groups such as Human Rights
Watch, has named recent SOA
graduates as responsible for assassi
nations, massacres and kidnappings
in Columbia and Mexico.
As stated in a recent letter signed
by 142 Brazilian Human Rights
groups, political parties and reli
gious groups, "The mark of the
School of the Americas is engraved
in the minds and bodies and in the
histories of the families of the tor
tured. killed, and disappeared."
Our hypocrisy about terror must
no longer continue.
Congressman Joseph Kennedy
said, "A story comes out about vio
lence or oppression in Latin Ameri
ca.and the names of School of the
Americas graduates emerge. Once
again the United States is shamed.
Graduates of the SOA will come
back to haunt us every year, in dif
ferent countries and under varied
circumstances. It is time we disasso
ciate ourselves with the School of
the Americas once and for all."
