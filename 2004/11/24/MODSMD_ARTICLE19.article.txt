## Bush must earn his mandate from voters 
### 
In introducing President
George W. Bush at his victory
rally on Nov. 3, Vice President
Dick Cheney used the word
mandate to describe the outcome of
the elections.
This week's poll indicates that
the administration is as out of touch
with the people as ever.
The first New York Times / CBS
poll since the election came out yes
terday, revealing that Bush's self
proclaimed decisive victory is in fact

anything but.
The nation re
mains divided as
ever on most
every issue, from
the economy to
Iraq.
Bush's ap
proval rating re
mains hovering
around 50 per
cent. The number
of people who

think the country is going in the
right direction is down to 40 per
cent. Only 44 percent of Americans
approve of the administration's
handling of foreign policy and 42
percent of the economy.
All of these numbers are histori
cally low. especially fora winning
incumbent.
Yet 51 percent of the voters
voted for Bush. 60.5 million people.
There is no easy way to reconcile
this. Are American voters con
sciously voting against their self-in
terest? Was the alternative — John
Kerry — really that bad? Are the
polls lying?
The most plausible explanation
is that people are hoping that things
are going to get better, and they
trust Bush to best improve the coun
try.
There was a time when Bush's ap
proval rating was near 90 percent.
At one point in the past four years,
64 percent of the people thought the
country was on the right track. Once
upon a time, 75 percent thought the
administration was doing a good job
of handling foreign policy and 64
percent for the economy.
The people want Bush to be the
one to restore the nation to its for
mer glory, but by no means do they
approve of the way that his cronies

in Washington are currently run
ning things.
Cheney's speechwriter must not
have passed "Reality 101" to have
interpreted the numbers the way he
did. Fifty-one percent of the popu
lar vote is only the slightest of ma
jorities. Something closer to 60 per
cent has historically been consid
ered a mandate, and this is rarely
achieved.
The poll did, however, reveal two
issues on which the administration
should see itself as having an obliga
tion to take action.
The first concerns the way the
government spends its money. A
full 67 percent of respondents — a
mandate majority — said that re
ducing the federal budget deficit
should be a higher priority than cut
ting taxes.
This has several implications for
the next four years.
It means that the public will ex
pect Bush to live up to his rhetoric
and — if we're lucky — veto a
spending bill or two, something he
has not done at all in this term. Fur
thermore, it means that the public
no longer sees cutting taxes as the
magical economic cure-all that Bush
once did.
And the second point is that the
country is in fact looking for some
change in direction. That the people
think that Bush deserves to be pres
ident more than Kerry is clear. But
that the people believe Bush needs
to make some changes in the way he
is running things is equally as clear.
Naming White House staffers to
run the Department of Justice and
Department of State, however, is
not a good sign that Bush plans on
making any meaningful changes.
If Bush is to live up to his promise
of being a uniter and not a divider,
he needs to listen to what the people
are really thinking and stop sub
scribing to the Cheney method of in
terpreting reality.

Americans who believe in creation
ism and the 65 percent who think that
