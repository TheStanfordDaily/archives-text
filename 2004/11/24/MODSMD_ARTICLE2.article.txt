# Getting turkey without going home
## 
### JENNIFER LIU 
For many out-of-state or interna
tional students who prefer staying
on campus to spending time travel
ing during this Thanksgiving holi
day, campus and community groups
are offering several options to enjoy
a traditional Thanksgiving dinner.
"It's not worth it to fly home to
New York," said freshman Mike
Ramm. "It's nice to have a break
from classes, but the flights will take
too long and I'll lose more time with
the time difference."
Stanford Dining has abridged
hours for the weekend, with dining
hall closures beginning tonight and
ending on different times over the
weekend. However, the ASSU and
the GSC are sponsoring a Thanks
giving meal at the Wilbur dining hall
on Thursday for the seventh year.
All Stanford students, as well as
their family and friends, can attend
the buffet-style meal from 1 p.m. to 4
p.m.

Although the registration period
for the Wilbur buffet has already
ended, students can still sign up to
pick up box lunches from Wilbur to
morrow. The ASSU and the GSC
are also sponsoring a canned food
drive for the Second Harvest Food
Bank of Santa Clara and San Mateo
Countries during the buffet.
Several resident fellows are host
ing Thanksgiving dinners for their
residents at their apartments as well.
Patrick Young, resident fellow of
West Florence Moore Flail, is hold
ing a Thanksgiving dinner for the
first time.
"I believe that dinner in the RF
apartment will provide fora more
personal, family-like atmosphere
than dinner in the dining hall,"
Young wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily.
Young estimates that about 20 to
30 students will stay in West Flo for
Thanksgiving, with more returning
on Friday and Saturday. He believes
that campus or staff-sponsored

events make a big difference in stu
dents' holidays.
"Thanksgiving is a family-orient
ed holiday and it can be hard on stu
dents that aren't able to go home to
see friends and family," he wrote.
"Providing dinner in the RF apart
ment or even in Wilbur dining goes a
long way to letting the students
know that they are cared for."
The Stanford Parents' Club is
also sponsoring a series of Thanks
giving dinners at the homes of local
students for the second year in a row.
"The dinners are hosted by par
ents who want to welcome Stanford
students into their homes," said
Marijke Vallaeys, the president of
the club. The idea for this program
was proposed by Dean of Freshman
and Transfer Students Julie Lyth
cott-Haims.
"We immediately responded,"
Vallaeys said.
Although the program is promot
ed by both the Office of Freshmen
and Transfer Students and the Bech
tel International Center, not very
many students participate in the pro
gram, according to Vallaeys.
"It's not really a success, maybe
because students haven't heard of
it," she said. She acknowledged that
the idea of spending an evening with
strangers may be off-putting to some
students, but she believes that the
dinners can be a way of meeting new
people.
"We would love to have students
come (to our house]," she said. "I
bought a big turkey, but the two stu
dents who signed up are no longer
coming."
Several students are going to the
houses of friends for Thanksgiving
dinner. Ramm plans on spending
Thursday evening at the home of
Evan Kutter, a fellow freshman who
lives in the nearby town of Saratoga,
with a few other dormmates.
"I don't really care about the sig
nificance of the holiday," Ramm
said. "But it would be a lot nicer to
eat dinner with a friend's family."
