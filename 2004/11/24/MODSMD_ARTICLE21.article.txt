'Radical Islamists' illustrate the
dangers of religious faith
Amit Patel writes, "It goes with
out saying that radical Islamists
should not be considered Muslims."
("World needs a stronger stance
against terrorism," Nov. 22) This is
one of the most preposterous asser
tions I have ever seen in print.
Not Muslims? Prominent Islamic
scholars disagree. Millions of chil
dren in madrassas disagree. The
mosques that fund suicide / homi
cide bombings disagree. The imams
who preach jihad all around me dis
agree.
Judging by the well-documented
support by most Muslims worldwide
for the 9 / 11 attacks and for attacks
directed toward innocent civilians in

principle — attacks conducted in
the name of God — most Muslims
disagree that "fadical Islamists
should not he considered Muslims."
What is "not Muslim" about truly
believing that the Qu'ran is the word
of God? Radical Islamists actually
believe in the Qu'ran as the literal
word of God. It is their answer to
every question; it is their sole source
of guidance; it is all they believe —
and such is what the Ou'ran com
mands.
The Qu'ran. including the con
cepts of jihad and martyrdom, is
their necessary and sufficient justifi
cation for all their beliefs and ac
tions. Islam is all they are. and that is
what God demands of them. No one
could be more true to Islam.
If there is anv ambiguity about

who is and who is not a Muslim, it
applies to the "moderate, liberal"
Muslim.
There is nothing moderate or lib
eral about believing that God wrote
a book for us, or that God even ex
ists. The same should be said of any
religious moderate.
But moderate Muslims conve
niently evade the word of God in
order to live coherently in Western
civilization, which is an affront to
the Oil'ran in every way.
What's radical about radical Is
lamists is that they truly believe in
their book and in their god. which
happen to be wholly unjustified fig
ments of the imagination.
Patel clearly has an understand
ing of and connection to Islam. Re
gardless. the opinion that "radical

Islamists should not he considered
Muslims" is deluded.
We cannot afford to maintain
these delusions any longer. We can
not afford to evade reality. Contrary
to what Patel says, "radical Islam" is
not the problem. The problem is
Islam and religion itself.

Columnists who prefer Col don't
deserve to be at Stanford
When I was at the Farm (IW4
tol998), the articles in the opinion
section were more sensibly written
and interesting than the garbage
that was put out by Mark Slee and
Evan Tana yesterday.

So Stanford lost the Big Game ..
. so what?
Does the loss merit such a base
less opinion piece filled with trash
talk? I would expect at least a little
more maturity from the columnists.
Furthermore, I usually don't read
The Daily online, but to have this
forwarded to me by Cal alumni is
disheartening.
To the featured columnists:
If Stanford pales in comparison,
why don't you transfer? If you're
smart enough, maybe you'd fill out
your transfer application, pack your
bags and leave the Farm. If you can't
appreciate what you have, and can't
appreciate Stanford for what it is, go
to your "real world." So you're
telling me the pot-reeking, shroom
infested Berkeley campus is closer

to reality?
I've had a great time at Stanford
— I know it's a bit of a country club,
but it's still a great place. And it's
taught me a lot in life and brought
me very far.
If you hate it and think it pales in
comparison to Berkeley, do yourself
a favor. Transfer out. and let a more
deserving Cal student transfer into
Stanford.
And by the way, what has an un
surprising defeat to Cal in football
got anything to do with them being
"unequivocally better." Now you're
definitely starting to sound like Cal
students.

ments of the imagination.
Patel clearly has an understand
ing of and connection to Islam. Re
gardless. the opinion that "radical

Islamists should not he considered
Muslims" is deluded.
We cannot afford to maintain
these delusions any longer. We can
not afford to evade reality. Contrary
to what Patel says, "radical Islam" is
not the problem. The problem is
Islam and religion itself.

Columnists who prefer Col don't
deserve to be at Stanford
When I was at the Farm (IW4
tol998), the articles in the opinion
section were more sensibly written
and interesting than the garbage
that was put out by Mark Slee and
Evan Tana yesterday.

So Stanford lost the Big Game ..
. so what?
Does the loss merit such a base
less opinion piece filled with trash
talk? I would expect at least a little
more maturity from the columnists.
Furthermore, I usually don't read
The Daily online, but to have this
forwarded to me by Cal alumni is
disheartening.
To the featured columnists:
If Stanford pales in comparison,
why don't you transfer? If you're
smart enough, maybe you'd fill out
your transfer application, pack your
bags and leave the Farm. If you can't
appreciate what you have, and can't
appreciate Stanford for what it is, go
to your "real world." So you're
telling me the pot-reeking, shroom
infested Berkeley campus is closer

to reality?
I've had a great time at Stanford
— I know it's a bit of a country club,
but it's still a great place. And it's
taught me a lot in life and brought
me very far.
If you hate it and think it pales in
comparison to Berkeley, do yourself
a favor. Transfer out. and let a more
deserving Cal student transfer into
Stanford.
And by the way, what has an un
surprising defeat to Cal in football
got anything to do with them being
"unequivocally better." Now you're
definitely starting to sound like Cal
students.
