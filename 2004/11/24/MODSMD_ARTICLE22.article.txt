# Eating turkey does not cause lethargy

(U-WIRE) LUBBOCK. Texas -
Holiday food fans do not have to
worry about driving home sleepy
after eating turkey on Thanksgiving.
Turkey does not cause drowsiness
any more than chicken, beef or nuts,
said Patty Vickers, registered dieti
cian and director of Texas Tech Uni
versity Diabetes Education Center.
"Many people have thought it was
an amino acid called tryptophan that
was thought to cause sleepiness, but
more recent research shows that is
not true," she said. "Turkey is not the
only food that contains tryptophan."
Other food items, including dairy
products, contain the amino acid and
have not been reported or known to
instigate lethargy, Vickers said.
"Scientists don't feel that it's
tryptophan (that causes sleepi
ness)," she said. "If we get sleepy on
Thanksgiving Day, it's probably be
cause of the amount of food we're
eating."
Mashed potatoes, green beans,
pumpkin pie, rolls and turkey will
promote tiredness if eaten in large

quantities, Vickers said, but not be
cause of what is in them.
"When you have a huge meal,
blood is drawn from the brain and
delivered to the stomach to help with
the digestion of the food," she said.
"There is really no reason to think
turkey causes sleepiness."
Controlling the amount of food
one eats is the key to remaining
awake and alert after a Thanksgiving
feast, she said.
"Eat in moderation and don't try
to stuff yourself," Vickers said.
Drinking liquid with a meal may
lessen the amount of food one con
sumes. Vickers said.
"If your stomach is full of liquid,
you would feel fuller sooner," she
said. "We'd have to be careful what
(people) are drinking."
Since alcohol is a sedative, Vick
ers said it would only elevate one's
level of lassitude.
Though Vickers said turkey does
not contain enough tryptophan to
cause sleepiness, according to how
stuffworks.com, the tryptophan in
turkey can be useful.
Leftover turkey is the perfect
late-night snack for someone having
problems getting to sleep because it

may contain the correct amount of
tryptophan on an empty stomach to
induce sleep, according to the Web
site.
One way to avoid becoming tired
after eating on Thanksgiving is to en
gage in mild physical activity. Vick
ers said.
"Try to do light exercise after the
meal," she said, "like go on walks."
Thanksgiving is a day to spend with
family and friends, and moderating
the amount of food eaten may allow
one to be more alert. Vickers said.
"I think (Thanksgiving) is the one
day that most everyone can enjoy
their favorite foods," she said.
Amalia Aguero, a senior adver
tising major from Lubbock, said she
rarely gets to have the benefit of
home-cooked food, so Thanksgiving
is a time to indulge.
"I don't get to eat good food
much," she said, "so this is the one
day to just eat."
Aguero said she usually gets
drained after the holiday meal, but
like Vickers, does not blame the
turkey.
"I don't think that has much to do
with it," she said. "1 think it is more
because you eat too much."
