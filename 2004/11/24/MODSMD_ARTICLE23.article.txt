## 
### DONN M. FRESARD MICHIGAN DAILY (U. MICHIGAN 
(U-WIREi) ANN ARBOR. Mich.
— This year's college graduates may
have an easier time finding jobs than
any graduates since the dot-com
boom of the late 19905.
Overall hiring of new college
graduates nationwide will increase
by 20 percent this year, according to
a survey released last week by Michi
gan State University's Collegiate
Employment Research Institute.
And despite recent losses in auto
motive jobs, which are expected to
continue over the next two years.
Michigan's economy is set to reverse
its four-year trend of net job losses
this year, according to a new forecast
by University economists.
The economists, Joan Crary,
George Fulton and Saul Hymans,
predicted an overall increase of
132,100 jobs in the state through

2006. with 60 percent of those jobs in
the service industry. The service in
dustry includes professional, busi
ness, leisure and hospitality services.
The University's senior class this
year is already seeing the benefits of
increased hiring, said Lynne Seville-
White, assistant director of recruiter
services at the University Career
Center.
"We're definitely seeing more se
niors with offers in hand by the end
of first semester than we've seen in
the last couple of years," Seville-
White said.
"We have seen more consulting
firms on campus, more financial in
stitutions and investment banks."
Eun Ja Yu. associate director of
the Stephen M. Ross School of Busi
ness's Office of Career Develop
ment. said students graduating with
business degrees this year have seen
more offers, more choices and high
er starting salaries than graduates in
recent years.
"We're cautiously optimistic."

Seville-White said. "Things seem to
be going in a positive direction, but
we're not at the levels that we were
at in 1999, when there was some as
tronomical hiring because of dot
coms and some other reasons."
The industries in Michigan that
reported the greatest hiring increas
es include retail, professional ser
vices, management consulting, ac
counting and pharmaceutical, ac
cording to the report. The automo
tive industry and other manufactur
ing sectors have failed to add jobs,
said Phil Gardner, the author of the
MSU report.
Gardner said the decline of man
ufacturing jobs relative to service-in
dustry jobs is part of a long-term
trend caused by improvements in
technology, which allow for increas
es in worker productivity.
He also cautioned that many of
the hiring increases this year are due
to a need for companies to fill gaps in
employment and may not represent
"real job growth or expansion."
