# iPods, condoms and CDs: Web site lures Dukies looking for freebies
## 
### TIFFANY WEBBER THE CHRONICLE (DUKE U 
(U-WIRE) DURHAM. N.C.—
For all those upperclassmen who
have tried to coerce unsuspecting
freshmen to give up their iPods to
no avail, there's another way to get
the goods without shelling out the
dough.
Gratis Internet, a Washington,
D C.-based company, launched
Freeipods.com last June with the
express intent of sending free iPods
to its users — or so the sales pitch
goes. Gratis Internet started its first
Web site, freecondoms.com. less
than five years ago, and as a result of
high demand, launched 10 other
websites that aim to give away items
like flat-screen televisions, CDs,
DVDs, video games, condoms and,
yes, iPods.
Although many are skeptical of
the promotion at first — calling it a
scam or condemning it as a pyramid
scheme — Duke users claim further
investigation shows the terms and
conditions appear completely legiti
mate. In fact, student users at peer
institutions like Harvard University
have been signing up for the promo
tion in droves.
Freeipods.com promises a free
iPod to any user that signs up for
one of 10 easily cancelable promo
tional offers and gets five other peo
ple to do the same. The offers range
from newspaper subscriptions to
online movie rentals.
"Basically, the users help us mar

ket." said Peter Martin, co-founder
of Gratis Internet.
Martin added that the decision to
give away iPods was a relatively
easy one.
The user base was interested in
bigger-ticket items," he said. "The
iPod was a natural choice for brag
ging rights and obvious sex appeal."
Freeipods.com has shipped out
7.500 iPods — nearly $3 million in
merchandise — since its founding
only five months ago. Martin noted
that the company has sent "a hand
ful" of iPods to Duke but also said
Gratis Internet has sent other prod
ucts such as flatscreen TVs and con
doms to the University.
Although the company experi
enced some complaints early on
concerning shipping time and fraud,
Martin described those problems as
"outdated."
"There was a fulfillment prob
lem early on," he said. "We've had
to grow to sustain the volume of
users. Fraud is also a big concern —
we've seen it all. Unfortunately,
people try to get a free product with
out playing the game. We're very
strict about any type of abuse and
fraud."
Martin was quick to add that al
though shipping time has improved
immensely, users should expect to
receive the product in no less than a
few weeks as "back-orders" and
U.S. Customs can delay the over
seas shipping process.
Some users of the site, including
Duke junior Andrew Todd, had to
wait several months after complet

ing the process before receiving
their iPods.
"I can't he frustrated for some
thing that only cost me $14," said
Todd, who placed an ad at a popular
news website soliciting help from
anyone willing to give the promo
tion a try. "I knew it was a pyramid
scheme going in. but 1 figured I'd
give it a shot."
Other students, like junior
Kosha Tucker, still have not ob
tained their iPods as they have ex
perienced difficulty finding five
other people to participate in the
program. But students' hesitancy to
sign up is understandable, she said.
"iPods are pretty expensive, so
when you see a 'get a free iPod' [on
the computer screen], you think it's
a scam," said Tucker, who signed up
for the promotional offer Oct. 31.
Still, some Duke students en
courage others to try the promotion.
"You have to put in the work,"
sophomore Alec Macaulay said.
"It's difficult to see it through to
completion, but it is legitimate.
Most people see that there's no easy
way out."
Even though Macaulay has yet to
hear tunes on any iPod he can call
his own. he has nothing but praise
for the company.
"I only did one offer, but I didn't
get the five other people to sign up,
so they never have to send me the
iPod," he said. "Anything half-done
is complete profit for them. It's a
brilliant marketing scheme."

give away iPods was a relatively
easy one.
The user base was interested in
bigger-ticket items," he said. "The
iPod was a natural choice for brag
ging rights and obvious sex appeal."
Freeipods.com has shipped out
7.500 iPods — nearly $3 million in
merchandise — since its founding
only five months ago. Martin noted
that the company has sent "a hand
ful" of iPods to Duke but also said
Gratis Internet has sent other prod
ucts such as flatscreen TVs and con
doms to the University.
Although the company experi
enced some complaints early on
concerning shipping time and fraud,
Martin described those problems as
"outdated."
"There was a fulfillment prob
lem early on," he said. "We've had
to grow to sustain the volume of
users. Fraud is also a big concern —
we've seen it all. Unfortunately,
people try to get a free product with
out playing the game. We're very
strict about any type of abuse and
fraud."
Martin was quick to add that al
though shipping time has improved
immensely, users should expect to
receive the product in no less than a
few weeks as "back-orders" and
U.S. Customs can delay the over
seas shipping process.
Some users of the site, including
Duke junior Andrew Todd, had to
wait several months after complet

ing the process before receiving
their iPods.
"I can't he frustrated for some
thing that only cost me $14," said
Todd, who placed an ad at a popular
news website soliciting help from
anyone willing to give the promo
tion a try. "I knew it was a pyramid
scheme going in. but 1 figured I'd
give it a shot."
Other students, like junior
Kosha Tucker, still have not ob
tained their iPods as they have ex
perienced difficulty finding five
other people to participate in the
program. But students' hesitancy to
sign up is understandable, she said.
"iPods are pretty expensive, so
when you see a 'get a free iPod' [on
the computer screen], you think it's
a scam," said Tucker, who signed up
for the promotional offer Oct. 31.
Still, some Duke students en
courage others to try the promotion.
"You have to put in the work,"
sophomore Alec Macaulay said.
"It's difficult to see it through to
completion, but it is legitimate.
Most people see that there's no easy
way out."
Even though Macaulay has yet to
hear tunes on any iPod he can call
his own. he has nothing but praise
for the company.
"I only did one offer, but I didn't
get the five other people to sign up,
so they never have to send me the
iPod," he said. "Anything half-done
is complete profit for them. It's a
brilliant marketing scheme."
