# Dartmouth imports labyrinths for finals
## 
### KEVIN GARLAND THE DARTMOUTH (DARTMOUTH COLLEGE 
(U-WIRE) HANOVER, N.H. -
Finals are here, and upperclass dean
Lisa Thum is bringing out the big
guns — labyrinths — to combat fi
nals stress.
These labyrinths, large mats that
will appear in Col I is Common
Ground, will be available for stu
dents to use at the end of Novem
ber. Thum may not be able to get to
the root of students' anxiety and
rushed lifestyles, but she hopes this
"spiritual, meditative, reflective
tool" will encourage individual
change during what tends to be a
busy and stressful examination peri
od.
Labyrinths are not to be con
fused with mazes, according to
Thum. as they have no vertical
structure, such as hedges, to define
the path and no dead ends or wrong
turns. Instead, the labyrinth is a
floor structure with a path that
"winds back and forth and becomes
a metaphor for our lives," she said.
Students will be encouraged to
walk along the path as a type of

study break. Thum said.
Labyrinths have a past rooted in
a plethora of religions, from Bud
dhism to Christianity to Judaism,
Thum noted.
"The labyrinth has some acade
mic underpinnings, there's a whole
thing on the sacred geometry of the
labyrinth — it's very mathemati
cal," Thum said.
A National Association of Stu
dent Personnel Administrators con
ference last spring inspired Thum to
bring labyrinths to Dartmouth. She
said many of the ideas at the confer
ence had too much religious context
to bring back to the College, but
that the contemporary usage of
labyrinths made it an appropriate
stress reliever and meditative tool
for college students.
Thum ordered the labyrinths
from The Labyrinth Company for
use from Nov. 29 to Dec. 3. David
Tolzmann a self-titled Chief
Geometer and Labyrinth Builder,
owns the company.
"After the conference 1 came
back here and ... got on a couple of
different Web sites and I found this
one that was really wonderful,"
Thum said about the alumnus

owned company.
Two labyrinths will be avail
able to students: one named
"Chartres Replica" will be 30 feet
in diameter, while "Vision Quest"
is 24 feet.
"Research has found focused
walking meditations are highly effi
cient at reducing anxiety and elicit
ing what Dr. Herbert Benson at
Harvard Medical School's
Mind/Body Medical Institute calls
the 'relaxation response,"' accord
ing to The Labyrinth Company pro
motional material.
Thum cited other uses for the
labyrinths. A local one at Dart
mouth-Hitchcock Medical Center is
utilized by terminally ill patients.
Noting Dartmouth's hectic
schedule for professors and admin
istrators alike, Thum said she thinks
the labyrinth can be useful to others
in the Dartmouth community as
well.
Thum hopes students take ad
vantage of this opportunity, even
contacting professors who are
teaching classes with possible inter
est in labyrinths.
"I'm hoping professors might
bring over classes," Thum said.
