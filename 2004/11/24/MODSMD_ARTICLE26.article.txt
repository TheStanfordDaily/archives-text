## Men look to secure NCAA bid at MPSF conference tourney 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's water polo team currently
has the nod for an NCAA at-large bid, but that
doesn't make the team a shoe-in for the national
tournament. Ranked second in the nation with a
19-4 record — 7-2 in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation — the Cardinal must win all three of
their matches this weekend to firmly secure a
berth.
Whether Stanford enters next week as the con
ference champion, the at-large winner, or stays
home for the first time in four years will be decid
ed by Sunday night.
But before then, the Cardinal squad will give
thanks for what has been another good season.
"The MPSF Tournament is always the week
end after Thanksgiving, so we're having a team
dinner Thursday night," said sophomore driver
Ryan Fortune. "All the families are going to be
there so it's a good way to get ready."

Stanford entered the season ranked No. 1 and
stayed on top for three weeks before moving
down to the second slot for the remainder of the
season. Given their impressive play this season,
including wins against No. 3 Southern California
(20-4, 5-3) and top-ranked UCLA (21-2,8-0). the
Cardinal's path to the NCAAs has been fairly
smooth.
But if there happens to be an upset and the
Cardinal fail to make it to the final game or the
Bruins fail to win Sunday, things could get messy.
Stanford's best bet would be to win the MPSF
Tournament this weekend, as the Tournament
champion automatically goes to the national
championships Dec. 4-5.
"That's our goal this weekend." Fortune said.
"It's better if we don't leave anything to chance ..
. Really there's no way to know [what will be
enough to secure a berth], but hopefully it will be
just enough to make it to the finals."
Momentum will be key in this weekend's
games. UCLA heads into the tournament with a

16-game win-streak, the program's longest win
streak since 1990. Pepperdine (14-2. 3-5). whom
Stanford will face in its first match Friday evening,
heads into the tilt with a string of three upset wins.
No. 4 California (19-8.4-5) will still have momen
tum after last week's 6-5 upset over the Cardinal,
and the Trojans put together two wins before end
ing their regular season.
The Cardinal on the other hand, are the only
top contender to enter the Tournament with a
loss. Stanford should bounce back against No. 7
Pepperdine, but the momentum the squad had
been hoping it would have entering tournament
play took a hit after Big Splash, where MPSF play
er of the Week Nate Bennett and the Bears stifled
the league's top offense.
So, while playing the Waves and their top scor
er Grant Miller, Stanford is keeping an eye out for
other potential upsets.
"We're not overlooking Pepperdine," said
