# Cardinal down BYU in Maui
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LAHAINA, Hawaii â€” While Stanford
can relate to Brigham Young's unenvi
able task of replacing three full-time
starters and a Top-10 NBA draft pick,
yesterday's second-round matchup in the
EA Sports Maui Invitational was no time
to empathize with the Cougars.
After a humbling loss to Tennessee on
Monday night in which the Cardinal
looked more helpless than a first-time
surfer, Stanford (1-1) bounced back with
a 62-53 win over BYU (0-2) at the La
haina Civic Center.
Stanford relied on another superb
performance from junior guard Dan
Grunfeld, solid team defense and pro
duction from its thin and inexperienced
bench.
While Grunfeld stole the show offen
sively with a game-high 20 points, it was
the play of his unheralded and little
known supporting cast that made the dif
ference for Stanford. Head coach Trent
Johnson was forced to go to his bench
early and often when junior forward
Matt Haryasz picked up his second per
sonal foul less than four minutes into the
game.
The Cardinal's reserves responded,
helping Stanford to a 28-25 halftime lead
with Haryasz on the bench, and finishing
with 14 points in 61 minutes after ac
counting for just two points in 35 minutes
on Monday.
"1 thought Jason Haas, Tim Morris,
Peter Prowitt and Taj Finger were excep
tional," Johnson said. ' Last night I don't
think I did a very good job of getting those
guys in the game in crucial situations."
Finger finished with four points and
two rebounds, while Prowitt grabbed two
rebounds in his regular-season debut, but
it was Morris, a redshirt freshman, who
provided the biggest spark. The explosive
guard scored 10 points, including a pretty
reverse layup in transition, and dished out
four assists without a turnover.
"When he's making good decisions in
the half-court, he has a chance to be a
pretty good basketball player." Johnson
said. "In transition he's a pretty good
player right now in using his athleticism to
get to the basket."
Grunfeld continued his hot start to the
season by sticking to his attack-the-basket
mentality. The Cardinal's best pure
shooter had more three-point plays of the
traditional and-one variety (two) than
three-pointers made (one), and his ag

gressiveness and positioning on both ends
of the floor netted him seven rebounds.
"When you have the ability to shoot
the ball it opens up some sort of driving
lanes, but I think it's a matter of being ag
gressive," Grunfeld said. "Whether the
jump shot is there or the driving lane is

there, you've got to take what you're
given, but also sometimes force the action
a little bit."

Forward Taj Finger was one of three freshmen who contributed greatly to the Cardinal's
62-53 win yesterday. Finger scored four points and recorded two rebounds.
while maintaining control. Stanford
cut its turnover total down to 11
after committing a dismal 24
turnovers against Tennessee.
Defensively, Stanford gave the
Cougars fits all morning, forcing l l >
turnovers and holding BYIJ to 35.4
percent shooting.
With Haryasz back on the floor
to start the second half. Stanford
went on an 11-0 run to take a 39-25
lead with 16:13 to play.
Stanford went on a 10-0 run in
the first half after Johnson inserted
Haas in the game to run the point
with Chris Hernandez sliding over
to shooting guard.
With just over eight minutes to
play. Haryasz made a tough catch of
a Morris pass in transition, spun into
the lane and delivered an emphatic
dunk to put the Cardinal ahead by
12. The lead would remain in dou
ble digits for most of the remainder

of the game.
Haryasz finished with six points
and eight rebounds, but his defen
sive presence inside, including
three blocks, was of paramount im
portance.
"We talked about it last night,
how offensively things are going to
go up-and-down," Grunfeld said.
"But one guarantee in the game of
basketball is that you can give 100
percent on defense. 1 think we tried
to come out with that mentality,
whether it's getting a loose ball,
taking a charge or getting a big re
bound."
The Cougars, which shot 31.6
percent in an 86-50 first-round loss
to North Carolina, have had less suc
cess filling vacant scoring roles than
the Cardinal thus far this season.
The team sorely misses center
Rafael Araujo, who averaged 18.4
points and 10.1 rebounds per game

and was the No. K pick in the NBA
draft.
Stanford will take on No. 12
Louisville today at 11 a.m. PST.
While the early-morning tip-off
(9 a.m. local time) leaves more time
for the Cardinal to hit the beach af
terward. one has to wonder how
much juice is left in the tank of a
team that has already endured one
overtime game, a full day of travel
and two tournament games in the
past five days.
"I think our energy level is pret
ty high." said senior forward Nick
Robinson, who finished with eight
points and eight rebounds. "We've
got a lot of adrenaline; just the op
portunity to be in the tournament is
really something special. I think
we've got about 24 hours to relax
and get off our feet, which is less
time than we had from yesterday to
today."
