# Cardinal down BYU in Maui
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LAHAINA, Hawaii â€” While Stanford
can relate to Brigham Young's unenvi
able task of replacing three full-time
starters and a Top-10 NBA draft pick,
yesterday's second-round matchup in the
EA Sports Maui Invitational was no time
to empathize with the Cougars.
After a humbling loss to Tennessee on
Monday night in which the Cardinal
looked more helpless than a first-time
surfer, Stanford (1-1) bounced back with
a 62-53 win over BYU (0-2) at the La
haina Civic Center.
Stanford relied on another superb
performance from junior guard Dan
Grunfeld, solid team defense and pro
duction from its thin and inexperienced
bench.
While Grunfeld stole the show offen
sively with a game-high 20 points, it was
the play of his unheralded and little
known supporting cast that made the dif
ference for Stanford. Head coach Trent
Johnson was forced to go to his bench
early and often when junior forward
Matt Haryasz picked up his second per
sonal foul less than four minutes into the
game.
The Cardinal's reserves responded,
helping Stanford to a 28-25 halftime lead
with Haryasz on the bench, and finishing
with 14 points in 61 minutes after ac
counting for just two points in 35 minutes
on Monday.
"1 thought Jason Haas, Tim Morris,
Peter Prowitt and Taj Finger were excep
tional," Johnson said. ' Last night I don't
think I did a very good job of getting those
guys in the game in crucial situations."
Finger finished with four points and
two rebounds, while Prowitt grabbed two
rebounds in his regular-season debut, but
it was Morris, a redshirt freshman, who
provided the biggest spark. The explosive
guard scored 10 points, including a pretty
reverse layup in transition, and dished out
four assists without a turnover.
"When he's making good decisions in
the half-court, he has a chance to be a
pretty good basketball player." Johnson
said. "In transition he's a pretty good
player right now in using his athleticism to
get to the basket."
Grunfeld continued his hot start to the
season by sticking to his attack-the-basket
mentality. The Cardinal's best pure
shooter had more three-point plays of the
traditional and-one variety (two) than
three-pointers made (one), and his ag

gressiveness and positioning on both ends
of the floor netted him seven rebounds.
"When you have the ability to shoot
the ball it opens up some sort of driving
lanes, but I think it's a matter of being ag
gressive," Grunfeld said. "Whether the
jump shot is there or the driving lane is

there, you've got to take what you're
given, but also sometimes force the action
a little bit."
When the Cardinal did force the action
against BYU. they managed to do so
