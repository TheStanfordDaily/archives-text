# Stanford takes on No. 14 Cardinals in final game of Invitational
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Stanford will get a crack at No. 12
Louisville in the final game of the Maui In
vitational, but it won't be the way the Car
dinal had originally envisioned it. Instead of
competing fora tournament championship,
the teams will be battling for fifth place
after losing their first-round contests.
The Cardinal slipped by Brigham
Young yesterday afternoon, 62-53, after
losing the tournament's opening game to
Tennessee.
Earlier in the day. Rick Pitino's Cardi
nals recovered from their first-round upset
at the hands of lowa to beat tournament
host Chaminade, 93-63.
Louisville began last season much like
Stanford did, winning 16 of its first 17
games, but the team took a tumble after
that. It lost nine of its final 13 and finished
9-7 in Conference USA.
The Cardinals' rejuvenation will de
pend largely upon junior point guard
Taquan Dean, who played through excru
ciating pain, the result of a hernia during
the last half of the season.
Dean, a three-point shooter and the
team's leading scorer with 15.7 points per
game, filled it up against Chaminade, scor
ing 21 points and sinking three of five shots
from long range.
The other main offensive weapons in
Pitino's arsenal are junior forward Francis
co Garcia, who led the team with 16.4
points per game last year, and senior guard
Larry O'Bannon. Both players can also
light it up from the outside.
Louisville features a relatively small
lineup, but Stanford might have trouble
defending against the Cardinals' up-tempo
offense, keyed by Dean. Louisville is hard
to beat when its outside shooters get hot,
as they did yesterday, sinking 9-of-23
three-point attempts. The team can fill it
up in a hurry, and all of its starters average
double digits in scoring.
Pitino, a notorious perfectionist, says
that his team still has a lot of work to do.
"We're nowhere near where we want to
be," he said.
Stanford head coach Trent Johnson
might say the same thing about his team. A
win against Louisville would be a big
step in the right direction.
Johnson said the Cardinal will
be facing a diligent-working group
in Pitino's squad.
"His teams always play ex
tremely hard, they're going to come
with a lot of pressure and score
from all five spots," Johnson said.
"We'll have an opportunity as a
Staff to watch a lot of videotape
from now until tomorrow."

Cardinal to face Santa Clara after
return from Hawaii
After spending Thanksgiving in
Hawaii, the Cardinal will return to
play Santa Clara at the Leavey
Center on Sunday.
It will be the first of three away

games before the Cardinal's home
opener in the renovated Maples
Pavilion against UC-Davison Dec.
IS.
Though the team used the
Leavey Center as its home for its
lone exhibition game against Con
cordia. it should not expect much
hospitality from the Broncos.
Santa Clara pulled off the upset
of the year thus far. defeating then-
No. 4 North Carolina, 77-66, in the
Pete Newell Challenge on Nov. 22.
In the nightcap of that tournament,
the Cardinal struggled to dispatch
San Francisco.
Santa Clara is much improved
from last year's 16-16 squad. It re
turns four of its starters, its top
three scorers and 77 percent of its
scoring overall.
The team is led by an all-Alaskan
backcourt of Doron Perkins and
Kyle Bailey that has combined for
one-third of the team's scoring and
rebounding and has dished out two
thirds of its assists.
The Broncos' most potent of
fensive weapon has been junior
power forward Travis Niesen, who
dropped 26 points on the Tar Heels
and leads the team in scoring with
15.5 points per game.
Niesen has been one of the
team's best players, but he also
points out the biggest problem
Santa Clara will face against the

Cardinal — a dearth of height. The
6-foot-7 Niesen might have a
match-up problem with the 6-foot
-11 Matt 1 laryasz.
With projected starting center
Sean Denison out until late De
cember, Santa Clara will start 6-
foot-8 Jordan Legge at center.
Stanford's ability to exploit this
mismatch will be key.
Against North Carolina, Santa
Clara was physically mismatched at
every position but managed to
make up for it in hustle. Niesen is
indicative of the Broncos' hard
working approach.
"1 don't think I'm very good, 1
just play really hard," he said after
the North Carolina game. "I'm not
afraid of anyone."
Santa Clara will definitely not
be afraid of the Cardinal, and the
game may come down to hustle.
It will be the teams' first meeting
since the 2000-2001 season, a con
test that Stanford won, 78-63, in
Maples.

Card to square off with
Santa Clara over break
Stanford will get a crack at No. 12
Louisville in the final game of the Maui In
vitational, but it won't be the way the Car
dinal had originally envisioned it. Instead of
competing fora tournament championship,
the teams will be battling for fifth place
after losing their first-round contests.
The Cardinal slipped by Brigham
Young yesterday afternoon, 62-53, after
losing the tournament's opening game to
Tennessee.
Earlier in the day. Rick Pitino's Cardi
nals recovered from their first-round upset
at the hands of lowa to beat tournament
host Chaminade, 93-63.
Louisville began last season much like
Stanford did, winning 16 of its first 17
games, but the team took a tumble after
that. It lost nine of its final 13 and finished
9-7 in Conference USA.
The Cardinals' rejuvenation will de
pend largely upon junior point guard
Taquan Dean, who played through excru
ciating pain, the result of a hernia during
the last half of the season.
Dean, a three-point shooter and the
team's leading scorer with 15.7 points per
game, filled it up against Chaminade, scor
ing 21 points and sinking three of five shots
from long range.
The other main offensive weapons in
Pitino's arsenal are junior forward Francis
co Garcia, who led the team with 16.4
points per game last year, and senior guard
Larry O'Bannon. Both players can also
light it up from the outside.
Louisville features a relatively small
lineup, but Stanford might have trouble
defending against the Cardinals' up-tempo
offense, keyed by Dean. Louisville is hard
to beat when its outside shooters get hot,
as they did yesterday, sinking 9-of-23
three-point attempts. The team can fill it
up in a hurry, and all of its starters average
double digits in scoring.
Pitino, a notorious perfectionist, says
that his team still has a lot of work to do.
"We're nowhere near where we want to
be," he said.
Stanford head coach Trent Johnson
might say the same thing about his team. A
win against Louisville would be a big
step in the right direction.
Johnson said the Cardinal will
be facing a diligent-working group
in Pitino's squad.
"His teams always play ex
tremely hard, they're going to come
with a lot of pressure and score
from all five spots," Johnson said.
"We'll have an opportunity as a
Staff to watch a lot of videotape
from now until tomorrow."

Cardinal to face Santa Clara after
return from Hawaii
After spending Thanksgiving in
Hawaii, the Cardinal will return to
play Santa Clara at the Leavey
Center on Sunday.
It will be the first of three away

games before the Cardinal's home
opener in the renovated Maples
Pavilion against UC-Davison Dec.
IS.
Though the team used the
Leavey Center as its home for its
lone exhibition game against Con
cordia. it should not expect much
hospitality from the Broncos.
Santa Clara pulled off the upset
of the year thus far. defeating then-
No. 4 North Carolina, 77-66, in the
Pete Newell Challenge on Nov. 22.
In the nightcap of that tournament,
the Cardinal struggled to dispatch
San Francisco.
Santa Clara is much improved
from last year's 16-16 squad. It re
turns four of its starters, its top
three scorers and 77 percent of its
scoring overall.
The team is led by an all-Alaskan
backcourt of Doron Perkins and
Kyle Bailey that has combined for
one-third of the team's scoring and
rebounding and has dished out two
thirds of its assists.
The Broncos' most potent of
fensive weapon has been junior
power forward Travis Niesen, who
dropped 26 points on the Tar Heels
and leads the team in scoring with
15.5 points per game.
Niesen has been one of the
team's best players, but he also
points out the biggest problem
Santa Clara will face against the

Cardinal — a dearth of height. The
6-foot-7 Niesen might have a
match-up problem with the 6-foot
-11 Matt 1 laryasz.
With projected starting center
Sean Denison out until late De
cember, Santa Clara will start 6-
foot-8 Jordan Legge at center.
Stanford's ability to exploit this
mismatch will be key.
Against North Carolina, Santa
Clara was physically mismatched at
every position but managed to
make up for it in hustle. Niesen is
indicative of the Broncos' hard
working approach.
"1 don't think I'm very good, 1
just play really hard," he said after
the North Carolina game. "I'm not
afraid of anyone."
Santa Clara will definitely not
be afraid of the Cardinal, and the
game may come down to hustle.
It will be the teams' first meeting
since the 2000-2001 season, a con
test that Stanford won, 78-63, in
Maples.
