Stanford will get a crack at No. 12
Louisville in the final game of the Maui In
vitational, but it won't be the way the Car
dinal had originally envisioned it. Instead of
competing fora tournament championship,
the teams will be battling for fifth place
after losing their first-round contests.
The Cardinal slipped by Brigham
Young yesterday afternoon, 62-53, after
losing the tournament's opening game to
Tennessee.
Earlier in the day. Rick Pitino's Cardi
nals recovered from their first-round upset
at the hands of lowa to beat tournament
host Chaminade, 93-63.
Louisville began last season much like
Stanford did, winning 16 of its first 17
games, but the team took a tumble after
that. It lost nine of its final 13 and finished
9-7 in Conference USA.
The Cardinals' rejuvenation will de

Taquan Dean, who played through excru

the last half of the season.
Dean, a three-point shooter and the
team's leading scorer with 15.7 points per
game, filled it up against Chaminade, scor
ing 21 points and sinking three of five shots
from long range.
The other main offensive weapons in
Pitino's arsenal are junior forward Francis
co Garcia, who led the team with 16.4
points per game last year, and senior guard
Larry O'Bannon. Both players can also
light it up from the outside.
Louisville features a relatively small
lineup, but Stanford might have trouble
defending against the Cardinals' up-tempo
offense, keyed by Dean. Louisville is hard
to beat when its outside shooters get hot,
as they did yesterday, sinking 9-of-23
three-point attempts. The team can fill it
up in a hurry, and all of its starters average
double digits in scoring.
Pitino, a notorious perfectionist, says
that his team still has a lot of work to do.
"We're nowhere near where we want to
be," he said.
Stanford head coach Trent Johnson
might say the same thing about his team. A
