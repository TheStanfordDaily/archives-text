### ANTARDEB GUHARAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball
team will soon find that there's more than
one meaning to the phrase "cold turkey."
Over Thanksgiving break, the Cardi
nal (2-0) will continue participation in the
Alaska Shootout tournament, following
up yesterday's first-round 91-50 demol
ishing of Eastern Washington with a
game against ULL.
Freshman guard Candice Wiggins led
the Cardinal against the Eagles with 18
points and five steals while junior center
Brooke Smith finished with 17 points.
Though the game was close in the open
ing minutes. Smith's free throws spurred
a 11-0 run that secured a Stanford win.
The young players on the Cardinal
team have stepped up in the early games.
Freshman Cissy Pierce has been an asset
on the defensive end of the floor with a
team-high five steals, and Wiggins has

been phenomenal in her first two games,
scoring 24 and 15 points. Wiggins was the
team leader in scoring for both games,
and her 24 points in the effort against
Utah helped stave off a feisty Utes team
in the last minutes.
"I'm pretty new at this college game,
so I'm not really sure what kind of pres
sure we were under," Wiggins said at the
conclusion of the Utah game. "I 'm kind of
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed right now."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer added:
"(Candice is) really a phenom. I think a
lot of it really is her competitive desire.
She has great poise. She's something.
We're excited about that."
The talented freshman class of the
Cardinal is complemented by the veteran
savvy of several returning players from
last year's Pac-10 Champion and Elite-
Eight team. When senior guard Susan
King Borchardt returns from a foot in-
jury, the Cardinal will boast a
formidable freshman-senior tan
dem in the backcourt in Borchardt
and Wiggins.
Senior Kelley Suminski, an in
strumental player in last year's high
achieving team, is also expected to
be a big factor this season.
Eastern Washington (0-1) lost a
close game against Cal State
Northridge, 69-66 in its first game of
the season. The Eagles have no
standout or specific superstar on
their roster but believe they can do
without one. Eastern Washington

finished 13-16 overall and 5-8 in the
Big Sky Conference last year.
The Eagles were -ho match for
the Cardinal last night, as Stanford
held a 20-point lead at halftime.
Now that the Cardinal have ful
filled expectations and disposed of
Eastern Washington, they will
move on to face the Ragin' Cajuns
of Louisiana-Lafayette (3-0). The
Cajuns handled Alaska-Anchorage
in the first game of the Alaska
Shootout tournament, 88-48. The
Cajuns were led by talented junior
guard Ashley Blanche, who scored

a career high 20 points and dished
out six assists in 28 minutes of play.
After the Alaska Shootout, the
Cardinal will travel to take on a na
tionally ranked Texas Tech team
before returning to Stanford to
christen the new Maples Pavilion
with a game against Pepperdine.
But before the Stanford women
can start looking ahead in their sea
son. they need to pick up some
steam, take some of the rage out of
the Cajuns and get hot in the tundra
of Alaska.
